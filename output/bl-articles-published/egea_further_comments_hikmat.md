Introduction

One of the themes expounded in the Law˙-i-Óikmat — a
Tablet of the ‘Akká period revealed in honour of Nabíl-i-Akbar
— is the way in which philosophical wisdom is ultimately
dependent on revealed religion. Bahá’u’lláh states:

> The sages aforetime acquired their knowledge from the
> Prophets, inasmuch as the latter were the Exponents of
> divine philosophy and the Revealers of heavenly
> mysteries. Men quaffed the crystal, living waters of
> Their utterance, while others satisfied themselves with
> the dregs. Everyone receiveth a portion according to
> his measure. Verily He is the Equitable, the Wise.
Furthermore, Bahá’u’lláh adds that “the essence and the
fundamentals of philosophy have emanated from the Prophets”.
This principle is illustrated with some examples from well-
known figures of classical philosophy:

> Empedocles, who distinguished himself in philosophy,
> was a contemporary of David, while Pythagoras lived
> in the days of Solomon, son of David, and acquired
> Wisdom from the treasury of prophethood. It is he
> who claimed to have heard the whispering sound of the
> heavens and to have attained the station of the angels.
> In truth thy Lord will clearly set forth all things, if He
> pleaseth. Verily, He is the Wise, the All-Pervading.
> Consider Hippocrates, the physician. He was one of
> the eminent philosophers who believed in God and
> acknowledged His sovereignty. After him came
> Socrates who was indeed wise, accomplished and
> righteous. He practised self-denial, repressed his
> appetites for selfish desires and turned away from
> material pleasures. He withdrew to the mountains

> where he dwelt in a cave. He dissuaded men from
> worshipping idols and taught them the way of God, the
> Lord of Mercy, until the ignorant rose up against him.
> They arrested him and put him to death in prison. Thus
> relateth to thee this swift-moving Pen. What a
> penetrating vision into philosophy this eminent man
> had! He is the most distinguished of all philosophers
> and was highly versed in wisdom. We testify that he is
> one of the heroes in this field and an outstanding
> champion dedicated unto it. He had a profound
> knowledge of such sciences as were current amongst
> men as well as of those which were veiled from their
> minds. Methinks he drank one draught when the Most
> Great Ocean overflowed with gleaming and life-giving
> waters. He it is who perceived a unique, a tempered,
> and a pervasive nature in things, bearing the closest
> likeness to the human spirit, and he discovered this
> nature to be distinct from the substance of things in
> their refined form. He hath a special pronouncement
> on this weighty theme. Wert thou to ask from the
> worldly wise of this generation about this exposition,
> thou wouldst witness their incapacity to grasp it.
> Verily, thy Lord speaketh the truth but most people
> comprehend not.
> After Socrates came the divine Plato who was a pupil
> of the former and occupied the chair of philosophy as
> his successor. He acknowledged his belief in God and in
> His signs which pervade all that hath been and shall be.
> Then came Aristotle, the well-known man of
> knowledge. He it is who discovered the power of
> gaseous matter. These men who stand out as leaders of
> the people and are pre-eminent among them, one and all
> acknowledged their belief in the immortal Being Who
> holdeth in His grasp the reins of all sciences.1
Nabíl-i-Akbar was probably not unfamiliar with this
correlation between ancient Greek philosophy and the Jewish
religion. In fact, as Bahá’u’lláh states, He is following “some
accounts of the sages”, accounts that actually represent a long
historiographical Muslim tradition of which Abu’l-Fat-i-
Sháhristání (1076–1153 CE) and Imádu’d-Dín Abu’l-Fidá (1273–
1331 CE) — from whose histories Bahá’u’lláh seems to quote —
are two representatives.

For a Western reader, however, the implications of the
words of Bahá’u’lláh may pose a challenge to the long-standing
assumption that Greek philosophy — considered for many the
bedrock of Western civilization — developed in the absence of
any influence from foreign religions or philosophical schools.

Three decades ago, Juan Cole presented some of the Muslim
sources of this tradition pointing also to a chronological
inconsistence from the perspective of modern scholarship in
regards to the statement about Empedocles and Pythagoras2.
More recently, Peter Terry approached the subject from a
different angle and, aside from analysing the Muslim sources —
adding more to the list presented by Cole — left room for a
literal reading of this tradition in the context of the fragility of
ancient chronologies and the infallibility of Bahá’u’lláh as the
Manifestation of God 3. Both positions represent, to some
extent, the sides of the dialogue that over the years has been held
among Bahá’í scholars in formal and informal discussions
about the historicity of the tradition.

The focus in the chronological issues of the Tablet has, to a
certain extent, deviated attention from the theme presented by
Bahá’u’lláh, that “the essence and the fundamentals of
philosophy have emanated from the Prophets”. Whether such
transmission really happened and, if so, where and how it can
be traced, are issues independent of the chronological
plausibility of the tradition quoted by Bahá’u’lláh regarding
Empedocles and Pythagoras.

Moreover, other questions may rise that seem important for
a deeper appreciation of the theme underlying this section of
the Tablet of Wisdom. Was this transmission limited only to
the sages mentioned in the Law˙-i-Óikmat or did it extend to
other philosophers and other schools of ancient philosophy in
the West? Did such transmission from revealed religion to
Greek philosophy occur only via Judaism or had other origins
as well?

This presentation does not intend to fill these gaps but it
will try, however tentatively, to examine some of the ancient
sources that may allow for the idea of foreign religious inputs
into the development of Greek philosophy. It will also survey
some of the conclusions that present-day scholarship has to
offer about this subject and lastly it will suggest some links
between ancient and Muslim sources for the tradition under
review.

Greek philosophy and Persia

Ancient Greek literature offers a large amount of accounts
about Zoroaster, Persian religion and the practices and
customs of the Magi as is shown by Franz Cumont and Joseph
Bidez in their monumental Les Mages Hellénisés4 . More
recently, Albert de Jong has synthesised some Greek and Latin
sources offering an interesting picture of the Persian religion
as it was seen in ancient times 5.

The oldest known Greek record about Zoroastrianism
belongs to the book Lydiaka. In a particular section known as
Magika (On the Magi) its author, the Lydian historian Xanthus
(fifth century BCE), mentioned Zoroaster in connection with
the doctrines of the Persians 6 and placed him six thousand
years before the second of the Graeco-Persian wars7.
Unfortunately, only a few lines of his work have survived in the
books of Clement of Alexandria and Diogenes Laertius, among
others. A cotemporary of Xanthus, the historian Herodotus
(484-425 BCE), despite not mentioning Zoroaster by name, also
paid some attention to the religious customs of the Persians in
his History. The interest for the religion of Zoroaster and the
Magi was to be present throughout the history of Greek
literature and thought.

That there was some knowledge of Zoroastrianism at that
stage should not come as a surprise. The Ionian region, on the
Aegean coast of the Anatolian peninsula, was always under the
influence of the neighbouring Persian Empire. Eventually (545
BCE) the entire region became subjugated to the Persians.
Other evidence, moreover, reveals that during the Achaemenid
dynasty the Magi were established well inside territory under
the Greek cultural orbit. For instance, in Dascylium (modern
Ergili, Turkey), a bas-relief from the fifth century BCE shows a
group of Magi performing a ritual. Historical accounts
mention also that a temple dedicated to Anahita was built by
Cyrus in Lydia8 .

This contact between both civilizations in Ionia is of
particular relevance to our subject, especially when considering
that during the sixth and fifth centuries BCE the region was a
crucible where the first philosophical ideas of the Western
world were developing in places such as Miletus or Ephesus.

The earliest preserved record explicitly linking a particular
philosopher to Zoroastrianism can be dated back to the fourth

century BCE. Aristoxenus of Tarentum, a disciple of Aristotle
with interest in Pythagorean ideas, wrote a biography of
Pythagoras which was subsequently used by later biographers9.
One of the few fragments that have survived for us is quoted by
Hippolytus (170-236 CE) who quotes Aristoxenus together with
an unknown Diodorus the Eretrian, stating that “Pythagoras
came to Zaratas10 , the Chaldean”11 who imparted to him a
doctrine that clearly resembles Persian dualism.

Evidently,   Zoroaster    and    Pythagoras      were    not
contemporaries. Aristoxenus’ statement is, however, the
expression of a firmly rooted tradition, transmitted in
different versions, according to which Pythagoras learnt the
doctrines of the Zoroastrians from the Magi in Babylonia or
from their prophet Himself. As Kingsley convincingly shows,
even the dating by some Greek historians of Zoroaster in the
sixth century BCE may have been the result of an effort to make
Him coincide in time with Pythagoras12 .

All the surviving biographies of Pythagoras agree in this
influence into his thought. Thus, Diogenes Laertius (probably
third century CE), the author of the Lives and opinions of
eminent philosophers, states that “… [Pythagoras] was a young
man, and devoted to learning, he quitted his country, and got
initiated into all the Grecian and barbarian sacred mysteries.
Accordingly, he went to Egypt, on which occasion Polycrates
gave him a letter of introduction to Amasis; and he learnt the
Egyptian language, as Antipho tells us in his treatise on those
men who have been conspicuous for virtue, and he associated
with the Chaldaeans and with the Magi.”13

The Neoplatonic Porphyry of Tyre (233-305 CE) wrote in his
Life of Pythagoras that the sage, while in Babylon, “associated
with the other Chaldeans, especially attaching himself to
Zaratus, by whom he was purified from the pollutions of his
past life, and taught the things from which a virtuous man
ought to be free. Likewise he heard lectures about Nature, and
the principles of wholes. It was from his stay among these
foreigners that Pythagoras acquired the great part of his
wisdom.”14

In discussing Pythagoras’ thought, Porphyry also states that
he learnt from the Magi “secrets concerning the course of life”15
and adds the following: “Such things taught he, thought
advising above all things to speak the truth, for this alone
deifies men. For as he had learned from the Magi, who call God

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                     10

Horomazda, God’s body is like light, and his soul is like
truth.”16

Iamblichus (250-325 CE), a disciple of Porphyry and one of
the outstanding figures of Neoplatonism, states in his
biography of the Samian that in his search for wisdom
Pythagoras travelled to Egypt and afterwards to Babylon where
he met the Magi: “He was taken captive [from Egypt] by the
soldiers of Cambyses, and carried off to Babylon. Here he was
overjoyed to be associated with the Magi, who instructed him
in their venerable knowledge, and in the most perfect worship
of the Gods. Through their assistance, likewise, he studied and
completed arithmetic, music and all other sciences. After
twelve years, about the fifty-sixth year of his age, he returned
to Samos.”17

While describing the teachings of Pythagoras, Iamblichus
mentions, moreover, that “his divine philosophy and worship
was compound, having learned much from the Orphic
followers, but much also from the Egyptian priests, the
Chaldeans and Magi…”. He also links some of the Pythagorean
rules with Zoroastrian practices: “The bodies of the dead he did
not suffer to be burned, herein following the Magi, being
unwilling that anything (so) divine (as fire) should be mingled
with mortal nature. He thought it holy for the dead to be
carried out in white garments; thereby obscurely prefiguring
the simple and first nature, according to number, and the
principle of all things.”18

Besides his biographers 19 , many other Greek and Latin
authors mention in their writings a sojourn of Pythagoras with
the Magi. Cicero (106-43 CE)20 , Valerius Maximus (first
century CE)21 and Philostratus (170-247 CE)22 are some Latin
examples. The Platonic philosopher Apuleius (124?-170? CE)
makes a comment similar to that written later by Iamblichus:
“There are some who assert that Pythagoras was about this time
carried to Egypt among the captives of King Cambyses, and
studied under the magi of Persia, more especially under
Zoroaster the priest of all holy mysteries; later they assert he
was ransomed by a certain Gillus, King of Croton.”23

The Christian teacher Clement of Alexandria (?-215 CE) also
mentions this connection and affirms that: “He [Pythagoras]
held converse with the chief of the Chaldean and the Magi; and
he gave a hint of the church, now so called, in the common hall
which he maintained”24 .

Another pre-Socratic philosopher who is linked with Persia
in ancient sources is Democritus (460-370 BCE), one of the
earliest, probably the first, of the atomists. Historian Claudius
Aelianus (second century CE) mentions that “it is reported that
Democritus the Abderite was wise, besides other things, in
desiring to live unknown, and that he wholly endeavoured it. In
pursuit whereof he travelled to many countries; he went to the
Chaldeans, and to Babylon, and to the Magi, and to the Indian
Sophists.”25

Furthermore, in an interesting text in which fragments from
Democritus are quoted, Clement of Alexandria states:

> … pluming himself on his erudition, he says, “I have
> roamed over the most ground of any man of my time,
> investigating the most remote parts. I have seen the
> most skies and lands, and I have heard of learned men
> in very great numbers. And in composition no one has
> surpassed me; in demonstration, not even those among
> the Egyptians who are called Arpenodaptæ, with all of
> whom I lived in exile up to eighty years.” For he went to
> Babylon, and Persia, and Egypt, to learn from the Magi
> and the priests. 26

Diogenes Laertius begins his biography on Democritus stating
the following:

> [Democritus] was the son of Hegesistratus, but as
> some say, of Athenocrites, and, according to other
> accounts, of Damasippus. He was a native of Abdera,
> or, as it is stated by some authors, a citizen of
> Miletus.
> He was a pupil of some of the Magi and Chaldaeans,
> whom Xerxes had left with his father as teachers, when
> he had been hospitably received by him, as Herodotus
> informs us; and from these men he, while still a boy,
> learned the principles of astronomy and theology.
> Afterwards, his father entrusted him to Leucippus, and
> to Anaxagoras, as some authors assert, who was forty
> years older than he… And Demetrius in his treatise on
> ‘People of the same Name’, and Antisthenes in his
> ‘Successions’, both affirm that he travelled to Egypt to
> see the priests there, and to learn mathematics of them;
> and that he proceeded further to the Chaldeans, and
> penetrated into Persia, and went as far as the Persian
> Gulf. Some also say that he made acquaintance with the

> Gymnosophists in India, and that he went to
> Aethiopia. 27
Empedocles is also said to have visited the Magi. Thus, in his
biography on Apollonius of Tyana, Philostratus (179-247 CE)
states: “For Empedocles and Pythagoras himself and
Democritus consorted with wizards [magoi] and uttered many
supernatural truths, yet never stooped to the black art…”28

Diogenes Laertius quotes the following about Socrates:
“Aristotle tells us that a certain one of the Magi came from
Syria to Athens, and blamed Socrates for many parts of his
conduct, and also foretold that he would come to a violent
death.”29 Similarly the pseudo-Platonic work Axiochus (c. 300
BCE) portrays Socrates as saying that he learnt about the
existence of an afterlife from the Magi Gobryas, grandson of a
companion of Xerxes.

Plato, Socrates’ pupil, is also said to have had some interest
for Persian religion. Seneca (4 BCE-65 CE), for instance,
explains that at the time of his passing, Plato was accompanied
by a group of Magi 30 . Diogenes Laertius states that “Plato had
also formed the idea of making the acquaintance of the Magi;
but he abandoned it on account of the wars in Asia.”31

Clement, mistakenly following one of the many pseudo-
Zoroastrian works that circulated during his time, identifies
Er, the personage of a late Platonic myth present in the
Republic, with Zoroaster 32 :

> And the same [Plato], in the tenth book of the
> Republic, mentions Eros the son of Armenius, who is
> Zoroaster. Zoroaster, then, writes: “These were
> composed by Zoroaster, the son of Armenius, a
> Pamphylian by birth: having died in battle, and been in
> Hades, I learned them of the gods.” This Zoroaster,
> Plato says, having been placed on the funeral pyre, rose
> again to life in twelve days. He alludes perchance to the
> resurrection, or perchance to the fact that the path for
> souls to ascension lies through the twelve signs of the
> zodiac; and he himself says, that the descending
> pathway to birth is the same. In the same way we are to
> understand the twelve labours of Hercules, after which
> the soul obtains release from this entire world.33
Dealing also with the myth of Er, Proclus informs of a
certain Colotes, a third century BCE Epicurean, who

Further Comments on a Passage of the Law˙-i-Óikmat             13

questioned the originality of the myth in his anti-Platonic
polemics and accused Plato of plagiarism from Zoroastrian
ideas 34 .

Clement also notes that “it is well known that Plato is found
perpetually celebrating the barbarians, remembering that both
himself and Pythagoras learned the most and the noblest of
their dogmas among the barbarians. Wherefore he also called
the races of the barbarians, ‘races of barbarian
philosophers’…”35

Another Christian writer, Lactantius (260-330 CE), asserted:
“Whence I am accustomed to wonder that, when Pythagoras,
and after him Plato, inflamed with the love of searching out the
truth, had penetrated as far as to the Egyptians, and Magi, and
Persians, that they might become acquainted with their
religious rites and institutions (for they suspected that wisdom
was concerned with religion), they did not approach the Jews
only, in whose possession alone it then was, and to whom they
might have gone more easily.”36

In the twentieth century, scholars in the field of classical
studies, ancient history and Greek and Latin philology have
done important research into the Eastern influences on Greek
thought. In some cases this research has confirmed some of the
ancient records quoted above and in others it has offered new
and fascinating theories. This interest for the Oriental
influence on Greek thought rose partly after the reconstruction
by Jaeger of some parts of a lost work by Aristotle. Jaeger’s
conclusions followed by the publication of Les Mages
Hellenises and Bidez’s Eos ou Platon et l’Orient shook some of
the assumptions held at the time in Western scholarship and
opened a whole new vista in the field of classical studies.

The most important intellectual achievement of the pre-
Socratics was to arrive to the notion of the existence of a
universal principle or arkhé, from which all existence is derived
and to which all existence can be reduced. Interestingly, there is
evidence enough to conclude that at least in the case of some of
the pre-Socratics this idea of an arkhé may had its origin in
Persian religion.

While Pherecydes is not generally included as one of the pre-
Socratics his was at least a role of transition between the
mythical thinkers and the early philosophers. He is also said to
have been the first Greek author to write in prose. Martin L.
West 37 notes that some features of Pherecydes’ system had no

precedent in Greek thought but rather seem to have some
counterparts in Persia and India. Pherecydes’ conception of
Chronos would be one case: “Pherecydes’s Time, like Zurván
and Kála, always existed. He too creates out of his seed,
without a consort, we don’t know exactly how. Our world is
fashioned not by him but by Zas [i.e. Zeus]. Zas, it is true,
does not spring from Chronos’s seed… Pherecydes prefers to
say that he too always existed, and that again has Iranian
parallels.”38

Anaximander’s (610-546 BCE) astronomy is also thought to
have certain elements of Iranian origin 39 . He seems to be the
first Greek in ordering the celestial bodies — with doctrinal
rather than astronomical purposes — in the sequence ‘stars-
moon-sun’ placing therefore the stars in the first place above
the earth: “…the stars were hoop-like compressions of air, full
of fire, breathing out flames at a certain point from orifices.
The sun was highest of all, after it came the moon, and below
these the fixed stars and the planets.”40

This scheme has parallels only in Persian religion and it is
possible to find Avesta and Pahlavi texts where this order is
reproduced in different contexts, such as descriptions of the
ascension of the soul. In some cases, a fourth level above the
sun, the ‘endless stars’, is added 41 :

> … for in the Dámdád Nask it is revealed that when they
> sever the consciousness of men it goes out to the
> nearest fire, then out to the stars, then out to the
> moon, and then out to the sun; and it is needful that
> the nearest fire, which is that to which it has come out,
> should become stronger. (Sháyást Lá- Sháyást 12.5,)42
> …’Thereupon, when Ohrmazd had produced the
> material (dahisno) of Zartosht, the glory then, in the
> presence of Ohrmazd, fled on towards the material of
> Zartosht, on to that germ; from that germ it fled on,
> on to the light which is endless; from the light which is
> endless it fled on, on to that of the sun; from that of
> the sun it fled on, on to the moon; from that moon it
> fled on, on to those stars; from those stars it fled on,
> on to the fire which was in the house of Zoish; and
> from that fire it fled on, on to the wife of
> Frahimrvana-zoish, when she brought forth that girl
> who became the mother of Zartosht.’ (Denkard, 7.2.3)43

> I announce (and) carry out (this Yasna) for these places
> and these lands… and for the stars, moon, and sun, and
> for the eternal stars without beginning, and self-
> disposing, and for all the Asha-sanctified creatures of
> Spenta Mainyu, male and female, the regulators of
> Asha. (Yasna 1.16)44
> And we sacrifice to all the springs of water, and to the
> water-streams as well, and to growing plants, and
> forest-trees, and to the entire land and heaven, and to

> We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of

> moon, the sun, and the endless lights, that had stood
> before for a long time in the same place, without
> moving forwards, through the oppression of the
> Daevas and the assaults of the Daevas. (Yasht, 13.57)46
Interestingly, Anaximander’s arkhé and key concept of the
Infinite or Boundless (to apeiron)47 , shares also some of the
features of the Persian ‘endless stars’48 . Both are designated as
the principles of all things, are ‘self-disposing’, and have a fixed
duration49 .

All these coincidences induce West to state that:
“Anaximander’s conceptions cannot be derived from Greek
antecedents, and to suppose that they chanced to burgeon in
his mind without antecedents, at the very moment when the
Persians were knocking at Ionian doors, would be as
preposterous as it was pointless.”50

Just as fire plays a major role in Zoroastrian doctrine, for
the Ephesian Heraclitus (540-475 BCE) fire it is the arkhé of all
things:

> This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or
> men has made; but it was ever, is now and ever shall be
> an ever-living fire, with measures kindling and
> measures going out. (Fr. 30)
> All things are exchanged for Fire, and Fire for all things,
> even as wares for gold, and gold for wares. (Fr. 90)51
It is in fragments like these that Duchesne-Guillemin sees
connections between the Heraclitean fire and Zoroaster’s

Asha. Both fires play the role of cosmological principles, both
share also eschatological implications (“fire in its advance will
judge and convict all things”, fr.66) and both inspire the deeds
of men 52 . West points to several other coincidences between
Zoroastrian and Heraclitean ideas some of which can be
mentioned here 53 :
Treatment of corpses:

> Fr. 96             Vendidad 3.8
> Corpses    are     O Maker of the material world, thou Holy
> more fit to be     one! Which is the second place where the
> cast out than      Earth feels sorest grief? Ahura Mazda
dung.              answered: ‘It is the place wherein most

corpses of dogs and of men lie buried.’

The souls of the dead can smell:

> Fr. 98             Yasht 25-32
> Souls smell in At the end of the third night, O holy
Hades (hell).  Zarathustra! when the dawn appears, it

> seems to the soul of the faithless one as if

> that wind blow, the foulest-scented wind
> that I ever inhaled with my nostrils?’

Non-adoration of figures:

> And they pray to these images, as if one were to talk with a

The philosopher and mathematician Whitehead once
described philosophy as a series of footnotes to Plato, a
statement that well describes the magnitude of the influence
Plato has had on Western thought. For some modern scholars
however, Plato drunk, in turn, from Eastern systems of
thought, particularly Persian religion. As has already been
noted, even some ancient sources point to that direction.

In 1923, Jaeger published his Aristotle, Fundamentals of the
history of his development. In its fourth chapter, the German
scholar reconstructs from different fragments part of the ideas
presented in a lost early Aristotelian work, On Philosophy (peri
philosophia), which “holds a unique place in Aristotle’s
development”54 . As the title portrays this piece — originally
presented in dialogue form — contained Aristotle’s ideas on
philosophy and its history. His thesis was that “the same truths
reappear in human history, not merely once or twice but
indefinitely often”55 . Following a chronological order Aristotle
deals first with some Eastern forms of thought, including
Zoroastrianism, and proceeds afterwards with the Greek sages.

A fragment from On Philosophy dealing with the Magi
survives in Diogenes’ Lives. In it, Aristotle assimilates the
Persian divinities with the Greek. Diogenes, in turn, compares
this view with that of other authors:

> But Aristotle, in the first book of his Treatise on
> Philosophy, says, that the Magi are more ancient than
> the Egyptians; and that according to them there are
> two principles, a good demon and an evil demon, and
> that the name of the one is Jupiter or Oromasdes, and
> that of the other Pluto or Arimanius. And Hermippus
> gives the same account in the first book of his History
> of the Magi; and so does Eudoxus in his Period; and so
> does Theopompus in the eighth book of his History of
> the Affairs of Philip; and this last writer tells us also,
> that according to the Magi men will have a resurrection
> and be immortal, and that what exists now will exist
> hereafter under its own present name; and Eudemus of
> Rhodes coincides in this statement. 56
In another fragment, contained in Pliny’s Natural History,
Aristotle is reported as giving a date for Zoroaster: “Eudoxus,
who wished it to be thought that the most famous and most
beneficial of the philosophical sects was that of the Magi, tells

us that this Zoroaster lived 6,000 years before the death of
Plato. Aristotle says the same.”57

This fragment proofs some knowledge of the Persian
division of time in intervals of 3,000 years, successively ruled
by Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu. By placing Plato as a
reference for dating Zoroaster, Aristotle is establishing a link
between both. Plato’s doctrine is thus represented as the
cyclical return of ancient doctrines brought first by Zoroaster.
In a section of Metaphysics58 , moreover, Aristotle mentions
the Magi as an intellectual precedent in discussing Plato’s
dualism. This remarkable fact seems to further corroborate
Jaeger’s theory which was afterwards accepted by other
scholars like Nyberg59 , Bidez60 and Cumont 61 among many
others. With all this evidence Jaeger states that “the Academy’s
enthusiasm for Zarathustra amounted to intoxication…It
heightened the historical self-consciousness of the school to
think that Plato’s doctrine of the Good as a divine and
universal principle had been revealed to eastern humanity by an
Oriental prophet thousands of years before.”62

Eudoxus of Cnidus (408-355 BCE), mentioned earlier, has
been identified by some as the possible channel for this
transmission. He was well versed in Chaldean astronomy and is
said by ancient sources to have performed extended travels. His
role in the Academy was not minor and during an absence of
Plato, he even assumed its direction. His origin from Cnidus is
of especial importance since the place had significant
connections with the Persian Empire63 . There is further
evidence of students in the Academy of ‘Chaldean’ origin 64 .

On the other hand, it must be noted that the Magi living in
the Western part of the Persian Empire soon assimilated
Babylonian religion and science. These Magi, or best called
Maguseans, incorporated into the Persian religion notions of
astrology, astronomy and other concepts that were alien to
what was professed by the Magi in the East. Thus, with the
expansion of the Persian territory, its religion evolved into a
Babylonian version. It is the Magusean’s heterogeneous version
of Persian religion that later philosophers like Eudoxus may
have encountered. This may explain the use of the Semitic name
‘Zaratas’ for Zoroaster as well as the ancient notion of
Zoroaster as a Chaldean astrologer or the many references to
Chaldean Magi. It is difficult, therefore, to segregate what was
purely Zoroastrian from what was Babylonian in the doctrines
incorporated into his thought by Plato65 .

The myth of Er66 may stand as an example of such a
phenomenon. It contains an imagery that is clearly Babylonian
in origin but includes, at the same time, eschatological
elements that may be traced till the Avesta 67 . Similarly, the
Phaedrus — a work with strong Babylonian influences as can be
gathered from its many astrological elements — also contains
some elements that can be found in works circulated by the
Maguseans68 .

At some point in the Statesman Plato uses a myth involving
the god Chronos to explain why humans are mortals. For this
purpose, Plato goes on to use a rich set of dualistic concepts.
While Bidez does not rule out the possibility of an influence on
Plato from Empedocles, in any case he seems to agree with
Reitzenstein in ascribing a Persian origin to some of the
elements present in the myth: “The idea that generation depends
on the movement of stars; the reference to the earthborn men
with no offspring; the intercalation in between each of the
great periods of Time of moments of catastrophic oscillations
and earthquakes, when stars suffer chaotic perturbations and
collide in a way similar to the fight described in the Bundahishn
(with the zodiac commanded by Ormurzd and the planets
leaded by Ahriman placed face to face); and last but foremost
the hypothesis envisaged at some point by Plato of the
alternative predominance of a god of Good and a god of Evil,
such are the principal elements of the myth that can make the
pan-Iranian thesis plausible.”69

In addition to the Statesman, there are also clear
occurrences of this dualism in Timaeus, Laws and Epinomis:

> And therefore, since we now claim that, as the soul is
> cause of the whole, and all good things are causes of
> like things, while on the other hand evil things are
> causes of other things like them, it is no marvel that
> soul should be cause of all motion and stirring — that
> the motion and stirring towards the good are the
> function of the best soul, and those to the opposite are
> the opposite — it must be that good things have
conquered and conquer things that are not their like.

> (Epinomis, 988d)
> …and since He perceived that all soul that is good
> naturally tends always to benefit, but the bad to
> injure, — observing all this, He designed a location for
> each of the parts, wherein it might secure the victory of

> goodness in the Whole and the defeat of evil most
> completely, easily, and well. (Laws, X 904b)71
> One soul, is it, or several? I will answer for you —
> “several.” Anyhow, let us assume not less than two —
> the beneficent soul and that which is capable of
> effecting results of the opposite kind. (Laws, X 896e)72
When analysed against the background of Aristotle’s
statement in On Philosophy and in Metaphysics, these texts
become appealing arguments in support of the thesis that the
Platonic thought of the late period, which incorporates into its
system a form of dualism of opposites which is so
characteristic of Plato’s doctrine, may have its intellectual
origins nowhere else than in Persian religion 73 .

The Greek notion of the human body as a microcosm
presenting in itself the order or parts of the greater cosmos
appears in a particular passage of Plato’s writings 74 . This is a
concept on which there is a consensus in that it has a Persian
parallel in the Greater Bundahishn 75 but opinions differ when
establishing who first incorporated this idea. Duchesne-
Guillemin sees rather an influence into Persian religion from
Greece or from India 76 and adduces, among other reasons, the
later date of the Bundahishn. On the other hand, Bidez,
following Göetz, believed in an influence in the opposite
direction and considered the passage in the Bundahishn as likely
having its origin in the Avesta. In this way, the pseudo-
Hippocratic Peri Ebdomádon (On the weeks), where this
notion is also present, and the Platonic Timaeus may have
drunk from the doctrine reproduced later in the Greater
Bundahishn which would have reached Greece through the
Cnidean physicians serving the Persian kings 77 .

Against the theories linking Plato with the East, other
authors like Koster, Festugière, Spoerri and Dodds 78 deny or at
least suspend the possibility that Plato ever incorporated
Persian doctrines into his thought. The arguments put forth
are varied, but a common feature is that they rely mostly, it
should be noted, on distinct interpretations of Platonic
thought rather than on alternative comparisons between
Persian and Platonic texts. In some cases, it has been rightly
noted that some of the Platonic doctrines that Bidez and others
have traced back to Persia have instead immediate precedents
in Greek soil and especially in Pythagoras but have avoided the

question of where Pythagoras or others acquired those ideas
from.

Regardless of how indebted Plato was to Zoroaster’s
religion, it is manifest that a considerable interest for the
Persian religion aroused in his Academy. Two of Plato’s
disciples, Hermodorus of Syracuse and Heraclides of Pontus
are said to have written works dealing with the Eastern religion
or at least entitled under the name of its founder. As has
already been noted, two other disciples of Plato, Aristotle and
Eudoxus, proved to have some knowledge of the Zoroastrian
doctrines.

The Alexandrian conquests strengthened Greek and Persian
cultures and a large amount of documentation about the
Zoroastrian religion began to proliferate. Books on
astronomy, astrology, botany and mineralogy79 ascribed to the
Prophet Himself or to the semi-legendary Magi Ostanes,
perhaps parts of the Avesta80 and philosophy treaties
summarizing some of the Zoroastrian doctrines became more
and more available in the Greek world. According to Plyny the
Elder, Hermippus of Smyrna (third century BCE) compiled
over two million lines of Zoroastrian texts81 . These apocryphal
books — the work of Maguseans in most cases — had in turn an
impact on the neo-Pythagorean, neo-Platonic and Stoic schools
as well as on Hellenistic Judaism82 .

Greek philosophy and the Jewish religion

Today, it is widely recognized that ancient Greek mythology
and theology received a notable input from Semitic ideas and
imagery — particularly from Phoenicia and Babylonia — in the
second and the end of the first millennium BCE 83 . Traditionally
however, the possibility of a later Jewish influence on Greek
culture has been overlooked or considered by many as simply an
invention by Jewish and Christian apologists.

Just as was the case with Persian religion, ancient Greek and
Latin literature provide a no less relevant catalogue of records
concerning Judaism84 . Many of those records are the
manifestations of the antisemitic trends that had started in
Alexandria during the second century BCE and invaded the
Roman Empire. As a consequence, a second type of records
covers the apologetic efforts of Jewish and Christian scholars

to lessen the effect of the many defamations circulating at the
time.

There is, however, a third category of ancient records. These
have a rather positive tone, comprise the earliest mentions to
Jewish religion and, therefore, precede and are independent of
any later vituperative or apologetic literature. As Martin
Hengel has noted “…the earliest Greek witnesses, for all their
variety, present a relatively uniform picture: they portray the
Jews as a people of ‘philosophers’. From this it is clear that the
intellectual ‘encounter’ between Greeks and Jews did not take
place only from the Jewish side, and that the Greeks took and
interest in meeting this people with its religion that sounded so
‘philosophical’”. 85

To a certain extent these records implicitly assumed that an
exchange of ideas from the Hebraic world into the Greek was a
matter of fact. It is in this context that some classic authors
held a respect for the Jewish religion as an ancient and
influential philosophical system of thought just as it happened,
as has been shown previously, with Persian religion.

One of the earliest Greek accounts on the practices of the
Jews is attributed to one of Aristotle’s disciples, Theophratus
(372-287 BCE)86 , who in discussing about sacrifices portrays
the Jews as a philosophical people: “During this whole time,
being philosophers by race, they converse with each other about
the deity, and at night-time they make observations of the
stars, gazing at them and calling on God by prayer. They were
the first to institute sacrifices both of other living beings and
of themselves; yet they did it by compulsion and not from
eagerness for it.”87

Origen tells us about a now lost work by Hecateus of Abdera
(fourth century BCE) dedicated to the Jewish religion: “And
there is extant a work by the historian Hecataeus, treating of
the Jews, in which so high a character is bestowed upon that
nation for its learning, that Herennius Philo, in his treatise on
the Jews, has doubts in the first place, whether it is really the
composition of the historian; and says, in the second place,
that if really his, it is probable that he was carried away by the
plausible nature of the Jewish history, and so yielded his assent
to their system.”88

Megasthenes (c. 300 BCE), who spent some years in India
where he was at the service of Seleucus Nicator I, is quoted
from his book Indica as stating that: “All the opinions

expressed by the ancients about nature are found also among
the philosophers outside Greece, some among the Indian
Brahmans and others in Syria among those called Jews”89 .

Pythagoras was said to also have had contacts with the Jews.

Some fragments by the Peripatetic historian Hermippus of
Smyrna (third century BCE) and preserved by Josephus and
Origen point in that direction. The reference quoted by
Josephus is from Hermippus’ De Pythagora:

> Pythagoras, therefore, of Samos, lived in very ancient
> times, and was esteemed a person superior to all
> philosophers in wisdom and piety towards God. Now
> it is plain that he did not only know our doctrines, but
> was in very great measure a follower and admirer of
> them. There is not indeed extant any writing that is
> owned for his but many there are who have written his
> history, of whom Hermippus is the most celebrated,
> who was a person very inquisitive into all sorts of
> history. Now this Hermippus, in his first book
> concerning Pythagoras, speaks thus: “That Pythagoras,
> upon the death of one of his associates, whose name
> was Calliphon, a Crotonlate by birth, affirmed that
> this man’s soul conversed with him both night and day,
> and enjoined him not to pass over a place where an ass
> had fallen down; as also not to drink of such waters as
> caused thirst again; and to abstain from all sorts of
> reproaches.” After which he adds thus: “This he did and
> said in imitation of the doctrines of the Jews and
> Thracians, which he transferred into his own
> philosophy.” For it is very truly affirmed of this
> Pythagoras, that he took a great many of the laws of the
> Jews into his own philosophy. 90
The passage alluded by Origenes seems to refer to a different
work of the same author: “It is said that also Hermippus, in his
first book on legislators, related that Pythagoras brought his
own philosophy from the Jews to the Greeks.”91

Later biographers of Pythagoras also described some
connections between him and the Jews. Thus Porphyry,
quoting a certain Antonius Diogenes, says: “He sent de boy
[Pythagoras] to a lyre player, a gymnast and a painter. Later he
sent him to Anaximander at Miletus, to learn geometry and
astronomy. Then Pythagoras visited the Egyptians, the
Arabians, the Chaldeans and the Hebrews from whom he

acquired expertise in the interpretation of dreams, and
acquired de use of frankincense in the worship of divinities.”92

Iamblichus offers further information on this contact and
explains that Pythagoras spent some time in solitude on Mount
Carmel:

> Enjoying such advantages, therefore, he sailed to
> Sidon, both because it was his native country, and
> because it was on his way to Egypt. In Phoenicia he
> conversed with the prophets who where descendants of
> Moschus93 the physiologist, and with many others, as
> well as with the local hierophants. He was also initiated
> into all the mysteries of Byblos and Tyre, and in the
> sacred function performed in many parts of Syria…
> After gaining all he could from the Phoenician
> mysteries, he found that they had originated from the
> sacred rites of Egypt… Therefore following the advice
> of his teacher Thales, he left, as soon as possible,
> through the agency of some Egyptian sailors, who very
> opportunely happened to land on the Phoenician coast
> under Mount Carmel where, in the temple of the peak,
> Pythagoras for the most part had dwelt in solitude…
> They [the sailors] began to reflect that there was
> something supernatural in the youth’s modesty, and in
> the manner in which he had unexpectedly appeared to
> them on their landing, when, from the summit of
> Mount Carmel, which they knew to be more sacred
> than other mountains, and quite inaccessible to the
> vulgar, he had leisurely descended without looking
> back… 94
Both Porphyry and Iamblichus detail Pythagoras’ visit to
Egypt. Laertius also alludes to this episode95 . This was an old
tradition that can be traced as far as Isocrates in the fifth
century BCE 96 and that has especial relevance for the
understanding of later views held by Christian and Muslim
historians. Eusebius, for instance, in his Praeparatio
evangelica considers that Pythagoras’ learning from the Jews
could have occurred during his sojourns in Egypt or in
Babylonia 97 : “Pherecydes also is recorded to have been a Syrian,
and Pythagoras they say was his disciple. He is not, however,
the only teacher with whom, as it is said, Pythagoras was
associated, but he spent some time also with the Persian Magi ;
and became a disciple of the Egyptian prophets, at the time

when some of the Hebrews appear to have made their settlement
in Egypt, and some in Babylon.”98

Regarding Plato, Numenius of Apamea (second century CE)
is quoted as having made the following striking comments:

> Also from the Pythagorean philosopher himself, I mean
> Numenius, I will quote as follows from his first book
> On the Good: ‘But when one has spoken upon this
> point, and sealed it by the testimonies of Plato, it will
> be necessary to go back and connect it with the
> precepts of Pythagoras, and to appeal to the nations of
> good repute, bringing forward their rites and
> doctrines, and their institutions which are formed in
> agreement with those of Plato, all that the Brahmans,
> and Jews, and Magi, and Egyptians arranged.’99
> Thus then speaks Numenius, explaining clearly both
> Plato’s doctrines and the much earlier doctrines of
> Moses. With reason therefore is that saying currently
> attributed to him, in which it is recorded that he said,
> ‘For what else is Plato than Moses speaking Attic
> Greek?’100
The peripatetic Clearchus of Soli (c. 300 BCE) is one of the
earliest authors known for having established a sort of link
between the Jewish religion and a particular Greek philosopher.
In a book discussing the phenomenon of dreams, he reproduces
a dialogue between Aristotle and a Jew which has been
preserved in Josephus’ Contra Apionem:

> For Clearchus, who was the scholar of Aristotle, and
> inferior to no one of the Peripatetics whomsoever, in
> his first book concerning sleep, says that “Aristotle his
> master related what follows of a Jew,” and sets down
> Aristotle’s own discourse with him. The account is
> this, as written down by him: “Now, for a great part of
> what this Jew said, it would be too long to recite it;
> but what includes in it both wonder and philosophy it
> may not be amiss to discourse of. Now, that I may be
> plain with thee, Hyperochides, I shall herein seem to
> thee to relate wonders, and what will resemble dreams
> themselves.     Hereupon      Hyperochides      answered
> modestly, and said: For that very reason it is that all of
> us are very desirous of hearing what thou art going to
> say. Then replied Aristotle: For this cause it will be the
> best way to imitate that rule of the Rhetoricians, which

> requires us first to give an account of the man, and of
> what nation he was, that so we may not contradict our
> master’s directions. Then said Hyperochides: Go on, if
> it so pleases thee. This man then, [answered Aristotle,]
> was by birth a Jew, and came from Celesyria; these
> Jews are derived from the Indian philosophers; they are
> named by the Indians Calami, and by the Syrians
> Judaei, and took their name from the country they
> inhabit, which is called Judea; but for the name of their
> city, it is a very awkward one, for they call it
> Jerusalem. Now this man, when he was hospitably
> treated by a great many, came down from the upper
> country to the places near the sea, and became a
> Grecian, not only in his language, but in his soul also;
> insomuch that when we ourselves happened to be in
> Asia about the same places whither he came, he
> conversed with us, and with other philosophical
> persons, and made a trial of our skill in philosophy;
> and as he had lived with many learned men, he
> communicated to us more information than he
> received from us.” This is Aristotle’s account of the
> matter, as given us by Clearchus; which Aristotle
> discoursed also particularly of the great and wonderful
> fortitude of this Jew in his diet, and continent way of
> living, as those that please may learn more about him
> from Clearchus’s book itself; for I avoid setting down
> any more than is sufficient for my purpose. 101
While it is attested that Aristotle spent a part of his life
living in Asia some authors 102 consider this encounter with a
Jew as fictitious. This conclusion is reached on the grounds
that placing a hellenized Jew as a contemporary of Aristotle is
an anachronism. Paradoxically, the argument can be applied to
Clearchus himself. 103

There is direct evidence of various ancient authors having
incorporated notions of Jewish religion into their works.
Thus, some scholars see traces of a passage from Genesis (I.28)
in the De universi Natura written around the second century
BCE by the Pythagorean Ocellus Lucanus104 .

In his Res Divinae, the Latin Varro (116-27 BCE) assimilates
the god Jupiter with Yahweh and extols the way in which the
Jews worship their God. Augustine quotes from him:

> He [Varro] also says that for more than one hundred
> and seventy years the ancient Romans worshipped the
> gods without and image. ‘If this usage had continued
> to our own day’, he says, our worship of the gods
> would be more devout’. And in support of his opinion
> he adduces, among other things, the testimony of the
> Jewish race. And he ends with the forthright statement
> that those who first set up images of the gods for the
> people diminished reverence in their cities as they
> added to error, for he wisely judged that gods in the
> shape of senseless images might easily inspire
> contempt.105
> Yet Varro — one of themselves — to a more learned man
> they cannot point — thought the God of the Jews to be
> the same as Jupiter, thinking that it makes no
> difference by which name he is called, so long as the
> same thing is understood. I believe that he did it being
> terrified by his sublimity. Since the Romans habitually
> worship nothing superior to Jupiter, a fact attested
> well and openly by their Capitol, and they consider him
> the king of all the gods, and as he perceived that the
> Jews worship the highest God, he could not but
> identify him with Jupiter.106
The anonymous pseudo-Longinus author of the De
Sublimitate — written around the first century CE — also
quotes from Genesis and praises Moses: “A similar effect was
achieved by the lawgiver of the Jews — no mean genius, for he
both understood and gave expression to the power of the
divinity as it deserved — when he wrote at the very beginning of
his laws, I quote his words: ‘God said’ -what? ‘Let there be light.
And there was. Let there be earth. And there was’”. 107

And Porphyry, who also quoted from the book of Genesis 108 ,
is said by Lydus to have assimilated Yahweh with the Platonic
Demiurge: “But Porphyry in the Commentary on the Oracles
says that the god worshipped by the Jews is the second god, the
creator of all things whom the Chaldaean in his discourse on
the gods counts to be the second from the first god, i.e. the
Good.”109

Of course, modern scholarship has offered different theories
about a possible Hebraic influence on Greek philosophy but a
general consensus as to how and when it happened is still
lacking.

In recent times, for instance, West has detected some
common features between the biblical giant Og and the Greek
Ogygos. The biblical Leviathan and Rahab also seem to have a
counterpart in Pherecydes’ Ophioneus but the possibility exists
that both the biblical and the Greek mythical beings have a
common origin in the ancient Middle East. 110

For Stern, the fact that some Pythagoreans like Ocellus were
aware of some Jewish doctrines may be proof of a Hebraic
influence on neo-Pythagorean circles. 111 And Hengel considers
that the personification of “Wisdom” as it appears in Proverbs
(8.22-31) and Job (28) can not be the result of an influence from
Greek culture. Rather, the personification of Sophia in Greek
thought, which is later, seems of Oriental influence.112
Similarly, Hengel points to the possibility that many of the
themes and concepts present in the Estoic school had the same
origins. One wonders if Hengel means Hebraic when he says
Oriental. 113

As has been shown earlier, the Platonic myth of Er has been
considered by some as an element with strong Persian roots.
But for others, however, the myth may be Semitic in origin. The
name Er, for instance, is a Semitic name (Lc. 3,28). Gómez de
Liaño points out the striking similarities in the structure and
imagery used by Ezekiel in his vision of the Chariot (1.4-28) and
Plato’s symbols in Er’s myth (Rep. X.617). Common features
appear also between Plato’s description of the ideal city and
Ezekiel’s vision of the Holy City. Gómez admits, however, that
despite the common features of both texts, the possibility
exists that its authors followed a common Babylonian text or
scheme not yet identified. 114

The Muslim sources

Juan Cole lists a number of Muslim authors that reproduce
the tradition alluded to by Bahá’u’lláh in the Tablet of
Wisdom. The names and works of some of them are:

> Sa’id al-Andalusí (1029-1070 CE): Kitáb Tabaqát al-Umam
> Abu’l-Fat˙-i-Sháhristání (1076–1153 CE): Kitáb al-Milal
> wa al-Nihal
> Jamálu’d-Dín al-Qiftí (1172-1248): Táríkh al-Hukamát

> Muwaffaqu’d-Dín ibn Abí Usaybiah (1194-1270): Uyun Al-
> Anba Fi-Tabakat Al-Attibba
> Imádu’d-Dín Abu’l-Fidá (1273–1331 CE): Al-Mukhtasar fi
Akhbar Al-Bashar

Walbridge115 and Terry116 mention an earlier writer, the
Persian Abú’l Hasan al-’Ámirí (d. 992), that also used the
tradition in his Al-Amad ‘Alá al-Abab117 . Being the earliest
known Muslim author to treat the issue, it will be worth
reproducing his words as translated by Rowson:

> The first one to whom wisdom was attributed was
> Luqmán, the Sage, as God says: “And verily we gave
> Luqmán wisdom” (Q 31:12). He lived at the time of the
> prophet David; they where both residents of the land of
> Syria.
> It is said that Empedocles the Greek used to keep
> company with Luqmán and learn from his wisdom. But
> when he returned to the land of Greece, he spoke on his
> own authority about the nature of the world, saying
> things which, if understood literally, offend against
> (the belief) of the Hereafter. The Greeks attributed
> wisdom to him because of his former association with
> Luqmán; indeed, he was the first Greek to be called a
> Sage. A group of the Bátinites claim to be followers of
> his wisdom and speak of him with high esteem. They
> claim that he wrote in symbols whose hidden meanings
> are rarely comprehended.
> Another Greek who was described as wise was
> Pythagoras. In Egypt he kept company with the
> companions of Solomon son of David, after they
> moved there from the land of Syria. Having (already)
> learned geometry from the Egyptians, he then learned
> the physical and divine/metaphysical sciences from the
> companions of Solomon. These three sciences — that is,
> geometry, physics, and the science of religion — he
> transferred to the land of Greece… He claimed that he
> had acquired these sciences from the niche of prophecy.
> After him, another Greek who was described as wise
> was Socrates. He derived (his) wisdom from
> Pythagoras, but limited himself to the divine sciences…
> Then, after him, another one described as wise was
> Plato. He was of noble lineage and pre-eminent among

> them. He agreed with Socrates in deriving (his) wisdom,
> and with Pythagoras…
> Another of the Greeks after Plato who was described as
> wise was Aristotle… [He] studied with Plato for nearly
> twenty years in order to derive wisdom (from him)…118
Accordingly, Rowson sees the origin of the reference to
Empedocles — actually the Muslimized pseudo-Empedocles —
to traditions circulating among the batínís119 .

Similarly, he traces the reference to Pythagoras back to
Eusebius (see quotation in the precedent section)120 , a
reasoning which is quite convincing. But there is also a passage
from Porphyry, an author widely used and quoted by Muslim
historians, that also fits well as the source for ‘Al-Amirí’s
passage on Pythagoras: “As for his knowledge, it is said that he
learned the mathematical sciences from the Egyptians,
Chaldeans, and Phoenicians; for of old the Egyptians excelled
in geometry… and the Chaldeans in astronomical theorems,
divine rites, and worship of the Gods.”121 Both ‘Al-Amirí’s and
Porphyry’s texts coincide in mentioning the Egyptians as
Pythagoras’ teachers in geometry while Porphyry mentions the
Chaldeans as the instructors of the Samian in divine matters.
Since sometimes the identification of the Chaldeans with the
Jews was, to a certain extent, common in medieval times it
may be assumed that some readers of Porphyry, including ‘Al-
Amirí or his source, may have understood this reference to the
Chaldeans as a reference to the Jews. What is more probable is
that a combination of Christian (be it Eusebius, Augustine or
both) and Pagan texts took place.

Furthermore, it is also worth noting that ‘Al-Amirí’s text
does not portray Empedocles and Pythagoras as meeting with
David and Solomon but rather as meeting their followers. In
the case of Pythagoras, this is consistent with pre-Islamic
texts.

The information as it appears in ‘Al-Amirí was afterwards
used by other historians such as Al-Andalusí and Al-Sijistání (c.
932- c. 1000, Siwán al-Hikma). From Sijistání it passed to
Sháhristání and from him to other writers like Abu’l-Fidá. From
Al-Andalusí the text passed to al-Qiftí and ibn Abí Usaybiah.122
As for Al-Andalusí, it interesting to note, that among the many
books he cites in his work, he does not make any mention of
‘Al-Amirí’s. It should not be discarded, therefore, that both

authors used a common source or that there was an
intermediary between both.

The tradition quoted by Bahá’u’lláh, while widely used in
Muslim scholarship seems therefore, in the absence of further
evidence pointing to a different direction, to be not a
repetition but an evolution of previous traditions. At its core,
it derives in last term from the many Pagan sources referring,
on the one hand, to the stay of Pythagoras in Egypt and, on the
other, to his contact with the Jews. At a second level we find
both traditions linked in a single one by some Christian
authors like Eusebius or Augustine who locate Pythagoras’
contacts with the Jews in Egypt. At a third level, we have ‘Al-
Amirí or one of his sources rescuing this Christian tradition
and adding to it comments about Empedocles — with no
precedent in ancient writers — and data extracted from Pagan
historians like Porphyry. At a fourth level, we find historians
like Sháhristání and Abu’l-Fidá — authors probably quoted by
Bahá’u’lláh — using ‘Al-Amirí’s version and adding to it little
variations like the one describing Pythagoras as living in the
days of Solomon.

Conclusion

Ancient records and modern scholarship offer us an
enormous amount of information about a possible
transmission of ideas from Eastern religions into Greek
thought. This data help us to better understand the
implications of Bahá’u’lláh’s statement that “the essence and
the fundamentals of philosophy have emanated from the
Prophets”. The arkhé of some of the pre-Socratics or the
dualism of Plato with its notion of a supreme Good, may stand
as just two examples of such phenomenon.

To prove or to discard a chronological synchrony between
Empedocles and King David or between Pythagoras and
Solomon, becomes, therefore, a very secondary matter, just as
for the question of whether the tradition quoted by Bahá’u’lláh
needs to be interpreted literally or not. Of course, it could be
interpreted literally and hopefully future research will uncover
new documents backing this approach. But in any case, what is
important from the passage under study are not the examples
cited by Bahá’u’lláh from some historians but the statement
that the Manifestation Himself is presenting and that underlies
the whole passage.

When an individual approaches the history of ancient
philosophy from the standpoint marked by Bahá’u’lláh then he
or she is confronted with a whole new picture, one that
questions many of the prevalent paradigms in present-day
Western scholarship. It also transcends the traditions present
in Muslim historiography, for it forces the researcher to take
into account besides Jewish religion, other ancient religions
such as Zoroastrianism or even Hinduism or Buddhism123 , and
to consider the cases, not only of the most popular figures of
Greek philosophy, but also of their predecessors and
successors.

\[97\] Besides the fragments from pagan writers there are also abundant

> philosophy on revealed religion and avoiding any notion in the mass of
> believers of incompatibility between reason and faith, between
> religion and philosophy. For some authors theology and philosophy
> were not only compatible but rather the same thing.
Clement says of Aristobulus: “Aristobulus, in his first book addressed to

> Philometor, writes in these words: Plato too has followed our
> legislation, and has evidently studied carefully the several precepts
> contained in it. And others before Demetrius, and prior to the
> supremacy of Alexander and of the Persians, have translated both the
> narrative of the Exodus of our fellow countrymen the Hebrews from
> Egypt, and the fame of all that happened to them, and their conquest
> of the land, and the exposition of the whole Law. So it is perfectly
> clear that the philosopher before-mentioned has borrowed much, for he
> is very learned; as also was Pythagoras, who transferred many of our
> precepts into his own system of doctrines” (Stromata I.22). Eusebius
> quotes Eupolemus as saying that Moses invented the alphabet that was
> afterwards taught to the Phoenicians who in turn transmitted it to the
> Greeks (Praep. IX.26).
Christian authors, especially Clement of Alexandria, Eusebius, Origen and

> Pseudo-Justin followed also this trend and dedicated whole chapters
> showing supposed examples of plagiarism made by Greek philosophers
> from the revealed Scriptures. In some cases, like in Pseudo-Justin, this
> endeavour reached the point of exaggeration in attempting to detect
> references to the cross or the trinity in the works of Plato.
> Paradoxically, some authors, as was also the case with Pseudo-Justin,
> combined these ideas with harsh antisemitism.

\[98\] Praeperatio X. IV (trans. E.H. Gifford 1903). Interestingly, Alexander

> Polyhistor may have identified the prophet Ezekiel with Zoroaster. This
