            THE CRISIS IN BABI AND BAHA'I STUDIES:
PART OF A WIDER CRISIS IN ACADEMIC FREEDOM?

Denis MacEoin

Bad reviews, like death and taxes, come to us all. But whereas we can hire
undertakers to box up our mortal remains and accountants to plead with the
faceless minions at Cumbernauld, it falls to ourselves to respond to the bad
reviews. Good manners and, indeed, self-interest-for which of us has not
written our share?-suggest that it is better, on the whole, to ignore them:
there are better things to do with one's time. But sometimes the bad reviews
are just a bit too unfair or misleading to be left alone.

For someone like myself, working in an apparently esoteric but increasingly
important field, the dilemma is particularly sharp. The bulk of my academic
work has been concerned with two religious movements originating in Iran-
Babism and Baha'ism. Not vastly important topics in themselves, I hear you
say. But with the recent burgeoning of interest in Iranian Shi'ism, they seem
likely to attract more and more attention from Islamicists. Baha'ism in
particular is a growing movement, whose size and paradigmatic qualities
recommend it as a fruitful field of study for sociologists of religion and
scholars in religious studies generally.

The biggest problem with BabT/Baha'Istudies at the moment is that the
entire field is dominated by practising adherents of the Baha'i movement. All
the big names-Momen, Smith, Amanat, Cole, Lambden-are Baha'is of long
standing. Not that that is a bad thing in itself: the work of all these individuals
is, broadly speaking, of a very high standard. Where the problem comes in is
that, myself excepted, there are no non-Baha'Tswriting seriously on the subject.

This means that there are few balances or objective criteria operating within
the field. More narrowly, it means that there is no-one out there capable of
making intelligent and informed estimates of the accuracy, originality,
controversiality, or significance of the work that is being produced.
Unconscious (and conscious) distortions, diplomatic silences, woolly
generalizations, plain exaggerations, misstatements of fact, significant
omissions-all can (and often do) pass unobserved and uncommented.

This can be particularly frustrating for the lone wolf like myself on whose
shoulders falls the responsibility to challenge received opinion. The field of
Babi and Baha'i historical and textual studies is one in which controversies
abound. Inevitably, the non-Baha'i researcher will disagree with at least some
Baha'i accounts or interpretations of the movement's history and doctrine
(otherwise, he would, presumably, join the movement).

If there were dozens of non-Bahia's working in the field, some sort of broad
consensus would no doubt emerge. But, as a solitary worker, I cannot create a
consensus of one. My fellow-workers in the field-the Baha'is, that is-by
virtue of their allegiance to a single ideology, have their own ways of arriving
at a consensus. And it takes little imagination to see what sort of problems that
may lead to.

Being the only person expressing any informed view about Babism or
Baha'ism that differs from or at times openly contradicts officially-sanctioned
Baha'i opinion carries with it several penalties. One, quite obviously, is a sense
of isolation. No Baha'i will espouse one's views in print-although plenty will
take up their pens to condemn them. No-one else is in much of a position to
offer praise for an original thought or criticism that is not ideologically
motivated. So it is easy to feel out on a limb and left with largely negative
impressions of one's own work.

This much can be suffered in silence. But it can become unusually galling
when certain Baha'is-some of them academics-seek to undermine one's
published work using tactics that few people outside the field are in a position
to appreciate or question. There is no-one out there to rise to one's defence, so
one is forced to take on the critics alone-and after a while it begins to look
more like an inability to take criticism than a legitimate reaction to partisan
sniping.

The most recent attempt to portray my work on Babism and Baha'ism as
inadequate, biased and unreliable has appeared in a review by Juan Cole, a
Baha'Tacademic from Michigan University, published in a recent volume of
this Bulletin, (14 (1988), pp.230-1). The review is devoted to a compilation of
essays on BabTand Baha'i studies (In Iran: Studies in Babi and Baha'i History
vol.3), but almost a third of it is given over to a discussion of my own
contribution, 'Hierarchy, Authority and Eschatology in Early Babi Thought'.

Cole's first paragraph on my article presents an ad hominem argument that
feels out of place in an academic review. He reveals that I was a Baha'i 'for
thirteen years' (it was more like fifteen, in fact) and after leaving the movement
began to write bitterly about it. Leaving aside Cole's somewhat loaded use of
the term 'bitterly'-I would have preferred something like 'critically' or 'with
less than fulsome praise'-I find myself troubled by his motives in dragging
this fact so far to the forefront of his discussion.

All the other articles discussed by Cole were penned by convinced Baha'is.

It should be clear that they too have their biases (in some cases apparent, in
others less so). But Dr. Cole chooses to single out my bias for special
comment, treating the other contributors as ordinary academics whose
convictions are immaterial to their work. And, of course, he omits to mention
the important fact that he is himself an active member of the Baha'i
community.

At this point, Cole's argument becomes somewhat subtle. He states that I
now say I am 'an objective non-Baha'i' but argues that I am in reality 'still very
involved in the subject emotionally' and 'about as objective as a former spouse
after a messy divorce'.

Not only is this argument somewhat offensive, but even on the simplest
level, I find its logic flawed. I have to assume that those Baha'i scholars who
have remained committed to belief in the religion are also 'involved in the
subject emotionally'. As a matter of fact, in most cases I know they are. So, in
the end, Cole's argument really cancels itself out. Or is there an ever-so-faint
suggestion here that Baha'is have a healthy and respectable sort of emotional
involvement that is a positive asset in academic work, whereas someone as

misguided as myself can only possess rather nasty and clouding emotions?

But let me return for a moment to the statement that I now give myself out
as 'an objective non-Baha'i'. This is genuinely loaded and needs careful
examination, chiefly for its methodological implications. The first point that
has to be stressed is that I have never actually claimed the sort of absolute
objectivity Cole seems to attribute to me. In an early article on the topic, I
clearly stated: ' ... it is undeniable that my own rejection of the values and
categories of the Baha'i system inevitably colours my thinking about it'. I have
never sought to conceal my position vis-a-vis Baha'ism or the biases inherent in
it.

But what Dr. Cole seems to be saying is that my lack of objectivity is so
great as to disable and invalidate my academic work. This I have to dispute. If
by 'objective' we mean 'attaining to a Platonic ideal of detachment', clearly I
do not qualify. Nor, I suppose, does anybody else. But if the term is taken to
mean that, like other academics, I endeavour to work with respect for the facts
(and for the problems of determining them), with rigour, self-awareness, and a
sense of fairness coupled with a critical temperament, then I would hope to be
granted some credence.

Peter Smith, a Baha'i sociologist whose work is also represented in the
volume under review, is someone whose work I have often praised for its
general freedom from the many biases that, I believe, mar the work of many
other Baha'i writers. In the preface to his recent introduction to the subject
(The BabTand Baha'TReligions, Cambridge, 1987), he states his aim of writing
'without conscious bias and with a general sense of questioning the taken-
for-granted assumptions which form part of my background as a Baha'i' (an
aim in which, incidentally, I happen to think he has by and large succeeded).

Now, Cole seems prepared to take Smith at face value, for he nowhere
suggests that his commitment to Baha'ism has unduly interfered with his
academic approach. I, however, am not to be accorded this courtesy. Why? I
rather think that, whereas Smith writes with respect for the facts yet in a vein
that is, inevitably, openly sympathetic to his subject, I tend to concern myself
more with the problems the facts throw up and to be more critical of Baha'i
attitudes to those problems.

Why do I choose to do this? Partly because it happens to be the way I see
things: it was, after all, a growing awareness of those problems that led to my
withdrawal from the movement. But more importantly, I think, it is precisely
because I am the only person in the field in a position to do it. If I were to stop
writing on the subject (as Cole, Momen, and others have suggested I do), the
field would be left entirely open to the Baha'is themselves. For obvious
reasons, that would, I believe, be deleterious to serious scholarship.

It would, indeed, be deleterious for a less obvious but more critical reason,
to which I have referred on more than one occasion and which it may be useful
to repeat here. All Baha'i writers, whether academics or not, are obliged, on
pain of severe penalties, to submit anything destined for publication, even in
an academic journal, for approval by official Baha'i 'reviewing committees'.
This approval may be withheld, or granted on condition changes are made.
The system is not one of peer approval, nor is it designed to promote academic

standards; its stated purpose (as set out in official guidelines) is simply to
ensure doctrinal uniformity and dignity of presentation.

While Baha'l academics like Dr. Cole remain willing to submit their work to
non-academic bodies for approval, emendation, or even withdrawal, I have to
regard it as my duty, whatever my own failings in the realm of objectivity, to
continue to write critically on the subject.

Perhaps the matter should be left here, with Dr. Cole asserting my lack of
objectivity and me insisting that I do my best to work within academic norms.
That would, however, leave untouched a most disturbing use of what is, to all
intents and purposes, a straightforward criticism of the actual content of my
article. This is his contention, outlined in his second paragraph, that, in my
recent work (including the piece under review), I tend 'to accept Azali accounts
of primitive Babism rather too uncritically'. What Dr.Cole means is that I have
used a version of early BabThistory contained in sources belonging to the Azali
sect of Babism.

At the risk of getting involved in a technicality likely to be of limited interest
to others, I would like to examine this statement more closely, chiefly because
it contains the sort of argument that works by assuming ignorance on the part
of the reader. It sounds good, looks convincing, and, since there are no non-
Baha'i experts in the field, is likely to go unchallenged. The point is of little
interest for its own sake, but it does serve as a lively example of the ways in
which ideology can distort academic judgement.

Why the fuss about Azali sources anyway? The simple answer is that the
Azalis were the rival sect of Babism with whom the Baha'is competed in the
last century. Azali sources are, for Baha'Ts, by definition corrupt and
unreliable. This same accusation was also levelled at E.G. Browne, another
non-Baha'i academic whose work has been much maligned over the years by
the Baha'Ts,and the French scholar A.L.M. Nicolas. For many Baha'is, simply
to use an Azali source is to be uncritical.

Is Dr. Cole even fair in levelling this criticism? The facts are rather against
him. The article under review is, in fact, the first of my published works in
which I have made any extensive use of Azali material at all (if we exclude
from this definition early Babywritings published but not written by the Azalis
in modern Iran).

More critically, it is worth actually looking at the ratio of AzalTto Baha'i
works used as sources for the chapter he refers to. On the basis of cited
references, I refer to Azal works a total of twelve times, to Baha'i sources no
fewer than fifty-four. Further, I refer to only three Azali sources directly (as
distinct from using quotations from other works cited in Azall books), but to
thirty-five Baha'Tworks. That does not seem to me to be the sort of balance
one might expect from someone accepting Azali accounts 'uncritically'.

What worries me more is that Cole straight-facedly admits that 'Baha'i
MSS can be equally suspect'. As any historian knows, all sources are in some
sense suspect, especially where partisan considerations and religious rivalries
have played a major role in their creation. In the case of Baha'l versus Azali
works, Babi historical studies are too much in their infancy to allow us to
make any generalizations as yet as to their relative merits or demerits.

Certainly, I cannot see how anyone could hope to do any useful research on
Babi history without depending to some extent on Azali material. If that
occasionally leads to conclusions that some Baha'is find disquieting, it is up to
them to demonstrate academically (and not emotionally) that the sources are
faulty.

This point deserves to be taken a stage further, since it reveals a serious
logical flaw in Cole's argument. It seems that, if I rely on Azali works, I am to
be regarded as 'uncritical'. Very well. But if as an alternative I rely on Baha'i
sources (which are, broadly speaking, the only others available to me for
certain periods), I am using materials which are, as Cole admits, 'equally
suspect'. In that case, surely I am being equally uncritical. I cannot see how I
am expected to get out of this dilemma other than by doing what I have, in
fact, done-namely, to use both Azali and Baha'i materials with as much
critical finesse as I can bring to bear on them.

Let me look finally at Cole's claim that I tend to be 'unduly dismissive of
the work on the Babi and Baha'i faiths produced by scholars who happen to be
Baha'Ts'.This is rather disingenuous. As Dr. Cole himself well knows, very few
Baha'i scholars, whether in the West or Iran, have ever carried out research on
the subject using modern critical approaches. Most Baha'i 'scholars' are
essentially learned apologists, a fact underlined by their willingness to accept
prior censorship of their work to ensure its conformity with official Baha'i
positions.

I have certainly criticized (and shall continue to criticize) the work of soi-
disant scholars who slavishly follow a party line while pretending to the world
at large to represent the values of independent scholarship. Equally, I am and
shall always be willing to speak highly of the work of those Baha'i academics
who show themselves ready to adopt independent and critical positions-in
evidence of which, I suggest Dr. Cole read my reviews of Peter Smith's recent
study.

Now, where is this rather long-winded piece of self-defence getting us? I
know it is helping me get some things off my chest that might otherside lead to
my strangling the cat and, as a consequence, to my wife strangling me. But
what about the ordinary Middle East scholar or Islamicist who has
inadvertently ended up reading it and persevered this far? A little
enlightenment about the state of BabT/Baha'istudies, perhaps. Maybe some
encouragement to get personally involved in research on the field, thereby
introducing another balance into the equation. And possible a little insight into
some problematic aspects of method in the study of religion.

If that were all, this rejoinder would scarcely have been worth writing. But I
think that even more serious issues are involved. Readers of this Bulletin who
also read the academic press will know something of the circumstances
surrounding the termination of my lectureship in Islamic Studies at Newcastle
University as the result of a decision taken by the Saudi Ministry of Education.
According to the Saudi Assistant Educational Attache, his superiors were
disturbed that I was teaching, among other things, courses on Shi'ism, Sufism,
and (to a much smaller degree), Babism and Baha'ism (as part of a course in
the sociology of religious movements).

On the one hand, then, my teaching and research is disrupted by the
sectarian disapproval of a hardline Sunni regime that disapproves, inter alia, of
Babism, Baha'ism and Sufism and that holds the purse-strings of a British
academic post. On the other, my integrity as an academic is questioned by Dr.
Cole, as it has previously been questioned by other Baha'is, who happen to
dominate the field.

Some years ago, in this country, the Baha'! authorities attempted to prevent
a leading publisher from including a chapter by me in a compilation edited by
a non-Baha'i academic. More recently, in the United States, their counterparts
refused permission to a Baha'i publisher to publish anything written by me,
regardless of content. A full-length study of sources for early Babi history and
doctrine, accepted and edited by that publisher, has now had its publication
blocked on the grounds that the text is 'disrespectful' to certain holy figures.
The chairman of the body responsible for the ban is a professor of history at
Yale University.

This, if my instincts are right, is a confirmation of my basic moderateness as
a scholar. It is also a cleft stick in which, if I am not mistaken, more and more
unaffiliated academics may find themselves caught as the autonomy and
disinterestedness of our university system are further undermined by outside
bodies. In Newcastle, I was replaced as a teacher of Islamic Studies by a Saudi
Muslim with no academic qualifications in the subject. In that same
department last year, a professorial fellow was appointed to carry out research
on aspects of the modern church in Britain: it was a stipulation of his
appointment that he be 'a committed Christian'.

In the US alone, the Baha'is, as Dr. Cole attests in his review, rival the
Quakers in numbers. They are, by my own estimate, the largest and the
fastest-growing of the New Religious Movements. They have growing funds
and a deep interest in the promotion of studies on their religion. Already, I
understand that a few posts in Third World universities are funded by them.
They have active quasi-academic associations in several countries, including a
particularly effective one in Canada. It cannot be long before they seek,
through conferences, publications and, finally, university appointments, to
influence the course of academic work on their faith.

This is a path that has already been successfully trodden by the Unification
Church (the 'Moonies') and criticized by a handful of academics such as
Horovitz in the United States and Beckford in this country. The effects of cuts,
loss of tenure, and government insistence on self-help are such as to render our
institutions of higher education particularly vulnerable to such attempts to
influence the tenor and direction of scholarship. Those of us who work in fields
like Islamic studies (or Babi and Baha'i studies) are particularly at risk. The
vested interests involved are many and powerful, our defences against them
weak and easily suborned. And if legislation is passed making blasphemy
against any faith a punishable offence, it may soon be impossible to write
openly about Islam, Baha'ism, or any other religion.

That is why I find Dr. Cole's review so disturbing. He is a serious, reputable
and honest academic. He is also committed to an ideology that affirms that the
truth is manifest. As Popper has often pointed out, the adherents of such

ideologies must inevitably conclude that those who fail to see or who dispute
their truth do so out of moral perversity and a wilful urge to conceal it.

Reviews like Dr. Cole's are designed primarily to short-circuit a perfectly
valid academic debate by introducing ad hominem arguments and red herrings
(in this case, my use of Azali sources). I respect Dr. Cole's right to defend his
chosen beliefs from what he perceives to be distorted presentations of them.
But he (and others) must learn to do so openly and in the context of
apologetics, not under the guise of academic argument.
