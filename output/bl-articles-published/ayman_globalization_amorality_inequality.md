> **Abstract:** The tremendous strides made in globalization, especially since WWII, have converged with a trend in growing amorality as the fabric of international business conduct in society. This convergence has led to extreme inequality within majority of nations in the world at a time when on aggregate wealth inequality between nations actually has been falling at impressive rates. Here, we shall discuss the impact the rise of amorality and globalization have had on wealth inequality and the guidance we observe in the Baha’i scriptures to alleviate extremes of wealth and poverty in the context of a world that increasingly selects amorality and acting in self interest as its new ethical foundation and globalization as its tool to optimize wealth concentration.

     Addressing the Rising Tide of
Globalization and Amorality in the
Present World Order and Its Implications

on Extremes of Wealth and Poverty 1

Rama Ayman

Over the past few decades, we have witnessed a simultaneous
rise in “Globalization” and “amorality” in the world—the
combination of these two trends has been the principal
contributor to the extreme inequality of wealth distribution we
witness in most regions of the world.

Bahá’u’lláh, in one of his Tablets, calls upon us to “Be
anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in, and
center your deliberations in its exigencies and requirements.”2
Although the history of wealth inequality and poverty can be
traced back throughout much of human history as witnessed in
patterns of colonialism, conquests of nations and oppression of
peoples, and dominion of tyrannical governments dating back
to the early civilizations that arose in Mesopotamia over 4000
BC and perhaps ever since early societies were formed, near
river banks, over 10,000 years ago, we shall focus here on
developments in the past few decades as the extreme level of
inequality in wealth distribution has now emerged as one of the
key concerns of 21st century, and it will be our duty to center

10                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

our deliberations in understanding its causes and identify
potential remedies.

We shall examine the state of globalization and its darker
side, the concept of amorality and its hold on our physical
reality, the extent of inequality in the world, and the potential
remedies that we need to seriously consider in order to
eventually eliminate extreme poverty and wealth. These topics,
as we shall see, are quite complex and inter-connected, and
require a multi-disciplinary approach, including sociology,
political and behavioral economics and finance, technology and
ethics, to be adequately examined, which render simple
conclusions largely erroneous.

Our thesis, explored herein, is that in the absence of a strong
moral foundation, globalization, largely driven by profit
maximization, could further lead to increased extremes of
wealth and poverty regardless of regulatory framework.

This is not an academic research paper, but a practitioner’s
viewpoint focused on the inter-play between globalization and
amorality, and on formulating a thesis based on an
understanding of the Bahá’í Writings, which would subsequently
require much needed in-depth academic research, and detailed
statistical studies to test our thesis and substantiate potential
causalities among concepts discussed herein. Moreover, this
article does not attempt to provide a formal Bahá’í point of
view, but should be considered an attempt to explore some of the
manifold layers of a very complex issue based on the author’s
experience in the fields of international business and economics
and his understanding of the writings of the Bahá’í Faith.

Globalization

Globalization, according to the Universal House of Justice
(the International governing body of the Bahá’í Faith), “itself is
an intrinsic feature of the evolution of human society. It has
brought into existence a socio-economic culture that, at the

Rising Tide of Globalization                                   11

practical level, constitutes the world in which the aspirations of
the human race will be pursued in the century now opening” [CL

\[134\] 
Globalization is complex and not easily packaged in one
definition, but it encompasses the trend of businesses and
technologies to spread beyond national borders and across the
time zones—this trend often creates opportunities for further
integration and attainment of economies of scale, previously
unimaginable, limited only by the extend regulations allow for
free flow of trade, labor and capital. This “free” flow of goods
and services and labor around the world could be positive for
the global economy, but its impact on wealth distribution could
be adverse if exploitation of either labor or capital by business
enterprises takes hold as a sacrifice for profit maximization as
their only objective.

It is no longer possible to compartmentalize globalization
outside of our lives, in fact, globalization today impacts most
aspects of our life—it is front and center in our lives; from
being a fringe topic only 30-40 years ago, it has entered popular
discourse on mainstream media and has penetrated our
collective psyche.

Globalization has enhanced cross border integration of value
added economic activity through increased super-mobility of
labor, capital, goods, and services which, in turn, have made
them widely accessible. Consequently, globalization has
increased our economic interdependence, which in turn, might
have helped avert WWIII. Global trade is now a necessity for
most countries, and for existential reasons, countries have come
to rely more on globalization to facilitate their commerce and
ensure their economic survival. Nations around the world
witnessed the harmful effects of isolationism that had
devastating impact on economies of Eastern Europe an Former
Soviet Union until 1990s, and continued to destroy the
economies North Korea, Iran and Cuba where global sanctions
have isolated them from much of global trade until presently

12                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

when many of these sanctions are being removed presently in
the case of the latter two countries.

The best example of the positive impact of globalization can
be clearly seen in terms of physical progress made in China over
the past two decades. China’s population today is 1.3 billion,
which equals the world population of 200 years ago. Since early
1990s, with the help of globalization, China was able to build
effectively mega cities (2 of the world’s top 10 cities are in
China) as well as over 40 cities of over 1 million in population,
with related infrastructure, benefiting inter alia from iron ore
and coking coal imports from Australia and other needed
natural resources from Africa and Latin America to build out.
Over the past two decades, China has also emerged as number 2
manufacturer in the world with market share of over $3 trillion.
Share of China’s global exports grew form 6% to 18%, while
during the same period, US’s share went from 18% to 9%.
China, in December 2014, surpassed the US, as the Number 1
economy in the world on a purchasing power parity basis at
$17.6 trillion versus the US at $17.4 trillion, and in the process,
it brought over 800 million people out of poverty.

Another well-known example of globalization is how the US
is financed. The US National Debt is $19 trillion: $6 trillion is
inter-governmental debt, $13 trillion is outstanding debt, 50%
of which is owned by foreigners. Namely, as a result of
globalization, foreign lenders provide funds to the US so it can
rebuild its roads, telecom infrastructure, and finance its social
security and healthcare. Without Globalization, these funds
would likely not be available.

Many tools have helped increase the rate of globalization,
including: Internet, travel, communication, technologies, which
when considered together, often generate a mood which is one
of ebullience and a sense of “shared community”, but much of
globalization we observe on a daily basis is actually an
illusionary material uniformity, especially as promoted by
fashion, tourism and entertainment industries that have

Rising Tide of Globalization                                     13

encouraged people to wear similar clothes, play with the similar
toys (PlayStation or Xbox), drive similar cars, go to similar
vacation destinations, enjoy similar foods, utilize similar mobile
phones and social networking applications—materially, it
certainly appears as though we have emerged united as
“consumers of one country”.

Amorality

Although globalization can facilitate equity, global peace and
eventually world unity, our thesis is that without strong moral
fabric, Globalization can yield global crises and ever increasing
inequality. Conversely, globalization can not be sustained if
amorality dominates social and commercial relationships.

Here, we have defined “amorality” as acting under strict rules
of law but without any moral considerations; acting morally is
not the objective as long as legally the act is legally allowed in a
given jurisdiction. By extension, acting without moral
consideration, or acting amorally, is to act only out of self-
interest as long as the act complies with legal framework—the
key word here is “only”, i.e. if benefitting the self is the only
objective, the associated act could be considered as amoral3.

One can distinguish an amoral act from a moral act if the act
has been done completely out of self-interest and without any
consideration for others (amoral), instead of an act, which has
been centered on the interest of others (moral). Defining sole
pursuit of self-interest as amoral may go against the grain for
many economists who have long held the belief that pursuing
self-interest generates economic benefits in the broader
context, and in fact, legitimizes selfish behaviour—a theoretical
notion which has formulated our economic thought since Adam
Smith linked self-interest to economic activity in the 18th century.

Although it is empirically challenging to embark on gathering
statistical data to measure the trends of amorality over the
course of human history, we can certainly witness its

14                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 17

prominence in global business and finance evidenced by most
global companies which hold maximization of shareholder value
as their primary objective—an objective that is deemed not only
legitimate but thought in business schools as a core virtue, in
managing a business, throughout the world. This objective is
based on a fundamental belief, prevalent in many societies, that
acting in self-interest is a necessity and a sufficient goal, and by
extension this belief is applied by executives and businesses
alike. The result has been manifold and omnipresent: the spread
of tax haven jurisdictions around the world, the movement of
capital to jurisdictions that facilitate tax avoidance, the
smallness of corporate contributions to social improvement
causes, the exploitative rush of global corporations to regions
that have cheaper labor force are among a few of the examples
that can be considered. While these trends are not necessarily
illegal, they are driven largely out of self interest of companies
on behalf of their shareholders.

It is over the past century that trends in globalization and
amorality, for the first time in history, have coincided and have
jointly become so prominent, leading to the disastrous effect on
inequality of wealth we witness in most countries. The
intriguing moral question remains, if within the current rapid
rise of globalization, would acting in “self-interest” for short
term gains dissipate as the benefits of longer term global
interdependence become apparent.

Extreme Inequality

World population today is 6 times larger than the world
population in the middle of 19th century; i.e. the past century
has seen an unprecedented rise of human population—it took
over 3 million years for human population to grow to 1 billion,
and in a space of less than 200 years, the world population
surpassed 7 billion. However, the fast growth of population,
especially since WWII, has now slowed down, and with it the
world economic growth rate may continue to be more limited,

Rising Tide of Globalization                                   15

contributing further to the severity of wealth inequality in the
world in the coming years.

Today, without any exaggeration, we witness extreme
inequality of wealth across the world, both in wealthy countries
like the US (the richest nation) and in the poorest countries. The
numbers are staggering: Top 5% of the population in the US
own 63% of national wealth; The top 1% now own over 41
percent of all the wealth in the country4—during post WWII
years, partly due to rise in population and high rate of economic
growth, the top 20% of the population’s wealth was 3x the
bottom 20% in 1970s; this ratio has risen to 8x today.

1800 individuals in the world have a wealth of $7 trillion or
about 10% of world GDP5—this number represents a record
1,826 billionaires with an aggregate net worth of $7.05 trillion,
up from $6.4 trillion a year ago.

The richest 85 individuals in the world control as much
wealth as the lowest 3.5bn people (bottom half of the world
population)6.

These extremes of wealth and poverty have created unequal
societies around the world, with devastating results across a
broad range of vital indicators—the link between extremes of
wealth inequality and these indicators has been substantiated by
many, including research by Richard Wilkinson7, who has shown
that unequal societies rank lowest on multiple factors that can
directly contribute to extreme poverty:

> o Life expectancy
> o Infant mortality
> o Homicide
> o   Trust
> o   Imprisonment
> o   Obesity
> o   Addiction
> o   Health issues
16                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> o Social mobility
> o Intergenerational mobility
Unequal societies rank worse on psycho-social values, and as
such will be a threat to globalization itself and in turn to
durability of growth in the long term. When these values worsen
to alarming degrees8, sustaining peace within or without the
countries becomes far more challenging, and achieving unity of
humankind becomes a distant goal until these great disparities in
wealth dissipate.

Since 1980s, free flow of capital, increasing competition
between nations to attract investments, declining population
growth, technological revolution and increase in productivity
have increased concentration of wealth. Thomas Piketty, a well-
known French economist, has studied 20 countries, income and
wealth distribution in the past 200 years and has demonstrated
that when rate of return (“r”) exceeds growth rate (“g”), wealth
concentration increases9:

Seeking r > g; result in accelerated wealth concentration

There has been much debate on how to reduce inequality—
current debate revolves around:

> o Progressive global wealth tax
> o Authoritarian capital controls: expropriation
> o Mutlilateral and Bilateral Grants
Rising Tide of Globalization                                  17

o Role of multi-lateral financial institutions: World Bank,

> International Monetary Fund, International Finance
> Corporation, European Bank for Reconstruction and
> Development, European Investment Bank, Asian
> Development Bank and numerous others, as well as the
> newly established Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank
o Philanthropic wealth distribution
Although there has been some success in increasing
transparency, and reducing inequality through progressive
taxation and eliminating tax havens and tax avoidance by the
wealthier sections of society, in general, there has been little
impact on extreme inequality of wealth we see today in the
society. Given the stance of amorality, taxes will be avoided as
long as a legal solution can be found, and legal solutions have
always been in abundance. As taxes are raised, new financial and
tax innovations are developed to assist tax avoidance. As long
as taxes are forced on people, tax avoidance can not be
prevented. Thomas Picketty’s own solution to establish a Global
net worth tax will likely end with the same tax avoidance issues.

Jeffrey Sachs, another renowned economist and specialist on
poverty, in his book End of Poverty 2005, outlined 10 action
plans to raise 0.7% of global GDP and reduce poverty; this plan
was partially adopted in the UN Millennium Plan whose goal
was to reduce extreme poverty by 50% by 201510:

> o   Improve agriculture
> o   Improve basic health
> o   Invest in education
> o   Bring power
> o   Provide clean water and sanitation
To achieve these lines of action, the Plan called for:

> o Unified plan of action
> o Promote sustainable development
> o Improve science
18                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> o Make personal commitments
> o Gain public acceptance
> o Strengthen UN and global agencies
However, Sachs is silent on necessity for spiritual and moral
education, and without a moral grounding, personal commit-
ments, public acceptance and unified plan of action would not
be possible. Nothing short of a moral education that would help
the individual combat acting only on self interest, transforming
of hearts of men one by one, can adequately address the
prerequisites for such global plans to eradicate poverty.

The Dark Side of Trends in Globalization and
Amorality

Acting only in self-interest, instead of then striving towards
helping others, eradicating poverty, and eventually achieving
greater degrees of world unity, promotes actions that only see
profit maximization (or “creating shareholder value”), as the
only existential goal, which under the framework of
globalization effectively means:
o Access to cheaper labor / cheaper sources of raw

> materials / cheaper feedstocks for their companies to
> maximize profits
o Access to more markets for their products to maximize

profits
o Access to jurisdictions with more favorable tax policies

to maximize profits
This is the effect of the convergence of globalization and
amorality that allows actions, which are legal but not necessarily
always “moral” (as defined by acting in the interest of others),
with respect to equity and justice, on a global scale.

The now omnipresent mantra of many businesses “go global”
has gained acceptance, because from their respective personal
standpoint, “going global” benefits “me”, not because of

embracing some utopian ideology of global unity. In aggregate,
acting in self interest (at individual level) or for companies
(acting for their shareholders) or for governments (acting in
their national interest) lead to a vicious cycle of zero:sum game,
creating and perpetuating strategies that are in contradiction
towards working for global equity, and instead we are on a
downward trajectory that will lead to more inequality and
human suffering.

To address the amorality of acting only in self interest, a
fundamental transformation, at individual and at collective
levels, is required—at the individual level, moral conviction is
needed that acting on self interest is wrong, and in turn, this
conviction at aggregate would transform shareholders of
companies, members of unions, technocrats in governments,
leading to policies that would consider interest of others as
priority. In such a context, this transformation would lead to:

> o Stronger global institutions who are empowered
> o More effective global security that can be relied upon
Given the vital importance of this individual conviction and
its subsequent implications on world order, globalization brings
us face to face with very existential questions about the
assumptions we have regarding human nature and whether
humans are inherently “Selfish” and “Material”, seeking material
accumulation as the ultimate goal in life, or whether humans are
inherently “Selfless” and “Spiritual”, seeking higher virtues of
love and fellowship and helping humanity as their ultimate goal
in life. Depending on which set of assumptions we subscribe, in
aggregate, societies are either doomed to be driven towards
competition and ultimately mutual destruction if the former set
of assumptions prevail, or can learn to work in cooperation if
individuals are inherently orientated not towards self but
towards helping others.

According to the Bahá’í belief system, human nature is
inherently spiritual. Any human has the capacity for turning

20                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

towards God or turning away from Him. During this physical
life, any human being can acquire spiritual qualities, and this
stands in contrast to the perspective that human nature is
inherently and essentially selfish. Therefore, human beings have
the capacity to be selfless in character, and ultimately be
capable of having the conviction to act in others’ interests, and
subsequently, work towards mutually beneficial goals of the
Unity of Humankind and the Most Great Peace.11 The Bahá’í
Faith’s principles of a united world order stand in contrast to
today’s world order where there is:
o No global leadership, no legitimacy for any one country

> or a small group of countries to lead (failure of G7 or
> even G20 to act definitively on any global decision
> regarding security, environment, distribution of
> resources etc.).
o No global vision regarding how to bring the diverse

> nations together to solve complex economic and
> financial issues facing most countries.
o No truly empowered global executive, legislative, or

> judiciary bodies for implementing authoritatively and
> with legitimacy equitable global laws (e.g. global welfare
> tax, standardization of policies, criminality, human
> rights violations).
o Inadequacy of exiting global institutions to effectively

> confront global challenges facing humankind—World
> Bank and its affiliates, United Nations, International
> Monetary Fund, World Court in Hague, though having
> been major steps in humanity’s progress towards global
> governance, nevertheless, have not yet eradicated
> poverty.
o No will to unify and coordinate response and adequately

> address global challenges:
> o environment,
> o resource management,

o Infrastructure demand: $57 trillion needed by 2030

(energy, water, transport, social projects),
> o health,
> o immigration,
> o poverty,
> o corruption
We can clearly witness the lack of fundamental spiritual
values of Trust, Truthfulness, Justice in both economic and
political circles, in the current global world order, and
understand that various forms of adherence to “Game Theory”:
if “I” act selflessly, and others don’t, “I” will lose, so “I” have
to act selfishly to get a minimum prosperity, is structurally
deficient to institute the necessary principles and governing
institutions that would eventually bring about the desired world
unity, which in turn is a pre-requisite to eliminate extremes of
wealth and poverty.

Furthermore, we can also witness that the “Rule of Fear” and
a deep sense of insecurity underlie the current global world
order, which inherently perpetuates the existing animalistic
behavior towards self-preservation, rather than addressing first
the needs of others. The effect of this “Fear” has only deepened
the darkness of a globalized world, where sovereign self interest
would not allow for fiscal and eventually political union in
Europe while their monetary union has been inadequate to solve
their economic problems, where self interest of nations would
not allow for equitable global distribution of natural resources
to eradicate poverty; where the search for super profits, as
opposed to responsible use of technological and scientific
discoveries has diminished positive impact that science could
have on society.

Globalization has been in fact moving in a trajectory that is
in many ways counter-productive to the realization of a more
united world order. Relative absence of moral and spiritual
values and lack of any consultative framework has weakened the

22                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 17

efficacy of today’s global institutions to adequately address its
concerns—a state of existence that has frustrated many political
leaders. For example, interestingly, President Putin made the
following statement during his speech in Sochi in October 2014:

> Sadly there is no guarantee and no certainty that the
> current system of global and regional security is able to
> protect us from upheavals. This system has become
> seriously weakened, fragmented and deformed.

The Response of the Bahá’í Faith

The Bahá’í Faith addresses the issue of extremes of wealth
and poverty, in the context of globalization and morality, in a
comprehensive fashion with allocated responsibilities for the
Wealthy, the Poor, the Society and the Global Institutions. All
responsible stakeholders must do their part. Any one
stakeholder acting in isolation will not yield satisfactory results.
It is the integrated action of all these stakeholders, benefiting
from positive global forces, under a moral umbrella, that will
ultimately eradicate poverty.

1\. Transformation of the Individual

For effects of Globalization to be more equitable in terms of
wealth distribution, and lead to the eradication of poverty, the
Bahá’í Faith calls for transformation of individuals to act
morally (i.e. act in the interest of others) instead of acting
amorally (i.e. act in the interest of self)—according to
Bahá’u’lláh:

> That one indeed is a man who, today, dedicateth himself
> to the service of the entire human race. The Great Being
> saith: Blessed and happy is he that ariseth to promote the
> best interests of the peoples and kindreds of the earth.
> In another passage He hath proclaimed: It is not for him
> to pride himself who loveth his own country, but rather

> for him who loveth the whole world. The earth is but
> one country, and mankind its citizens. [GWB 249-250]

The call for service and its importance to derive universal
benefits, was again discussed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

> Universal benefits derive from the grace of the Divine
> religions, for they lead their true followers to sincerity
> of intent, to high purpose, to purity and spotless honor,
> to surpassing kindness and compassion, to the keeping
> of their covenants when they have covenanted, to
> concern for the rights of others, to liberality, to justice
> in every aspect of life, to humanity and philanthropy, to
> valor and to unflagging efforts in the service of
> mankind. [SDC 98]

In fact, to pursue one’s own interest ahead of others is likened
to the behavior of animals and not worthy of human nature:

> If man were to care for himself only he would be
> nothing but an animal for only the animals are thus
> egoistic. If you bring a thousand sheep to a well to kill
> nine hundred and ninety-nine the one remaining sheep
> would go on grazing, not thinking of the others and
> worrying not at all about the lost, never bothering that
> its own kind had passed away, or had perished or been
> killed. To look after one's self only is therefore an
> animal propensity. It is the animal propensity to live
> solitary and alone. It is the animal proclivity to look
> after one's own comfort. But man was created to be
> a man—to be fair, to be just, to be merciful, to be kind
> to all his species, never to be willing that he himself be
> well off while others are in misery and distress—this is an
> attribute of the animal and not of man. Nay,
> rather, man should be willing to accept hardships for
> himself in order that others may enjoy wealth; he should
24                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> enjoy trouble for himself that others may enjoy
> happiness and well-being. [FWU 42]

This elevated status of human nature, the purpose of human
beings in this life, and in fact the purpose or goal of his
creation in general is core to the Bahá’í Faith’s theological and
existential beliefs and centers squarely around service to
humanity.

All men have been created to carry forward an ever-
advancing civilization. [GWB 215]

Given the centrality of placing the individual’s conviction in
“service to humanity” and considering interests of others above
self-interest, as the very purpose/goal of creation, in Bahá’í
theology, the transition from self-centeredness towards human
society-centeredness is an outcome that is self evident. The
implications of this belief system are enormous, and in stark
contrast against the belief system prevalent in modern society
where the basic assumption about the human nature is in fact
that individuals act selfishly, and in this context, individuals in
aggregate would feel insecure about their future as they believe
no one would consider their interest—this feeling of insecurity
about their well-being, leads to self-accumulation of wealth and
power as means for safeguarding security, and in turn, on
aggregate, such acting in self-interest leads to harmful
competition and lack of true cooperation—seeking super
returns above economic growth, as discussed previously, would
lead to extremes in distribution of wealth and poverty. Thomas
Piketty stated that “there is no natural force that would bring
inequality under control”. As such, concentration of wealth
grows till it is unacceptable, but in the meantime such extremes
of wealth and poverty shall undermine institutions and
democracies around the globe.

On the other hand, under the world view of the Bahá’í Faith,
where individuals act out of interest for others, each individual,
in turn, becomes a recipient of selfless acts, which on aggregate

shall result of feelings of security rather than insecurity, thus
creating a virtuous cycle of everyone behaving selflessly in
service of others and enhancing social security at large and
eliminating extremes of wealth and poverty.

On the other hand, if we see ourselves as alone and view the
world as hostile, we see lack of social security, become fearful,
and only consider self-interest. To act selflessly today takes
courage and an enormous Faith in spiritual character of
humanity and a single-minded purpose to fearlessly act—any
slight giving to fear would accelerate our behavior towards
acting out of self-interest.

The implication of this core issue regarding morality and
amorality in a global context can be realized when Globalization
is viewed as an opportunity to help less materially fortunate
communities—in the longer term these communities will develop
and become significant markets by themselves: 6 countries of
Brazil, Nigeria, Indonesia, Pakistan, Ethiopia and Bangladesh,
with a total population of 1bn (equaling world population of
less than 200 years ago), and incomes of $500-3000 per year,
once empowered, these countries, as we have seen much
progress over the past 2 decades, develop businesses and
contribute to science and education. The “game” changes from
“zero:sum” to “win:win”12, and the trend shifts towards having
less inequalities in the world.

In order to achieve this “win-win” scenario, we need to
achieve a proper balance between material progress and
corresponding emphasis on morality. Without observing moral
standards of Justice and Equality, globalization can have
perverse outcomes—“spiritual” and “moral” forces must play an
essential role in achieving solutions to such urgent problems [CL

\[59\] 
When morality is compromised or neglected, regardless of
the legal framework, the dark side of globalization looms ever
larger and in extreme cases globalization, when unchecked, will

institutions into the hands of those with no moral compass.
Examples of these situations have been outlined in a recently
published book “Deviant Globalization”13:

> o Illegal smuggling of labor
o Sex trade reaching 10s of millions, creating multi-billion

dollar global industry
> o Black market for human organs—kidney
> o Semi-slave labor
> o Waste Trade
o Drug trade—the failed US war on drugs since 1970s has

costed $2.5T
> o Weapon Trade
> o Global criminal organizations
> o Global terrorism
Another major pre-requisite for the transformation of the
individual is the leap from nationalism to world-citizenship—a
true belief in world citizenship, rather than seeking only
national interest, is a core and uncompromising precondition
without which a balanced globalization would not be possible.
The founding principle of world citizenship is real belief in
Oneness of Humankind:

> The principle of the Oneness of Mankind—the pivot
> round which all the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh revolve—is
> no mere outburst of ignorant emotionalism or an
> expression of vague and pious hope. Its appeal is not to
> be merely identified with a reawakening of the spirit of
> brotherhood and good-will among men, nor does it aim
> solely at the fostering of harmonious cooperation among
> individual peoples and nations. Its implications are
> deeper, its claims greater than any which the Prophets of
> old were allowed to advance. Its message is applicable
> not only to the individual, but concerns itself primarily
> with the nature of those essential relationships that must

> bind all the states and nations as members of one human
> family.... It implies an organic change in the structure of
> present-day society, a change such as the world has not
> experienced.... It calls for no less than the
> reconstruction and the demilitarization of the whole
> civilized world—a world organically unified in all the
> essential aspects of its life, its political machinery, its
> spiritual aspiration, its trade and finance, its script and
> language, and yet infinite in the diversity of the national
> characteristics of its federated units. [WOB 42-43]

2\. Responsibility of the Wealthy

Bahá’u’lláh on numerous occasions discusses the status and
importance of taking care of the poor “Bestow wealth upon the
poor”; the “Poor are My Trust”. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also encouraged
the wealthy to provide for the poor, exulting them to “not be
intent on your own ease”; “expend on philanthropic purposes”
[SDC 24].

This willingness to help those less fortunate should become
an innate desire. The wealthy are to expend on the poor out of
their own volition, without being pressured legally or forcefully
to do so; otherwise, they would spend their wealth trying to find
loopholes to avoid giving.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá himself states that one should not imagine that
his remarks

> constitute a denunciation of wealth or a commendation
> of poverty. Wealth is praiseworthy in the highest degree,
> if it is acquired by an individual's own efforts and the
> grace of God, in commerce, agriculture, art and
> industry, and if it be expended for philanthropic
> purposes. Above all, if a judicious and resourceful
> individual should initiate measures which would
> universally enrich the masses of the people, there could
> be no undertaking greater than this, and it would rank in

> 24]

The “giving” of the wealthy would come naturally as the
fundamental thesis of society would be transformed from being
self centered towards considering the interests of others before
self as previously explained. As mentioned before, this requires
a spiritual transformation of individuals.

3\. Responsibility of the Poor

Within the larger context of the responsibility of society and
the wealthy to ensure that all have the opportunity to do useful
work, there is a complementary obligation to work and the
prohibition of begging in the Bahá’í Writings where it does
discuss how we are forbidden to idly “sit and beg” [KA 30]. These
teachings of the Bahá’í Faith should not be taken out of
context, and must be treated as part of the more global solution
of eliminating poverty—the obligation to work and the
prohibition of begging are not meant to blame the poor for
their own fate because they chose to beg (or, in countries with
social safety nets, receive welfare) rather consider their
responsibility, in relation to their capacity, to be productive
members of society. Bahá’u’lláh, thus, proclaims that it is
“incumbent to engage in crafts and profession”14. In fact, in the
same paragraph, Bahá’u’lláh further elaborates that work is
elevated to the status of worship if done in the spirit of service.

In this regard, society also has direct responsibility for the
poor, especially in the case of those who cannot take care of
themselves—here, Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, further

clarifies: “All have been enjoined to earn a living, and as for
those who are incapable of doing so, it is incumbent on the
Deputies of God15 and on the wealthy to make adequate
provision for them.” This is further elaborated upon in note 62
of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas: ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explained that “The object
is to uproot mendicancy altogether. However, if a person is
incapable of earning a living, and is stricken by dire poverty or
becometh helpless, then it is incumbent on the wealthy or the
Deputies to provide him with a monthly allowance for his
subsistence....” The note continues, “The prohibition against
giving charity to people who beg does not preclude individuals
and Spiritual Assemblies from extending financial assistance to
the poor and needy or from providing them with opportunities
to acquire such skills as would enable them to earn a
livelihood.” Note 56 of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas elaborates further on
the duty to engage in a trade or profession, and quotes a letter
written on behalf of the Guardian stating: “It is the duty of
those who are in charge of the organization of society to give
every individual the opportunity of acquiring the necessary
talent in some kind of profession, and also the means of
utilizing such a talent, both for its own sake and for the sake of
earning the means of his livelihood.”

As such, one can study the responsibility of the poor in
eradication of poverty is equally important and goes hand in
hand with the responsibilities of the wealthy and of the society.

4\. Responsibility of the Society

The role of Huqúqu’lláh

The society, and the wealthy, as ‘Abdul-Bahá advised, should
“initiate measures that would universally enrich the masses”.
One important instrument founded by Bahá’u’lláh exactly to
improve distribution of wealth and eradicate poverty is the
institution of Huqúqu’lláh,16 which would be an important
source of funds for enriching the masses.

30                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

The key distinguishing factor between Huqúqu’lláh and the
Global Net Worth Tax suggested by economists and policy
makers is the spiritual and voluntary nature of Huqúqu’lláh,
unique in the annals of history, and its spiritual obligation on
the individual without any one or any institution having the
right to police its compliance—although it is calculated as 19%
of a person’s increase in wealth or assets after necessary
expenses are deducted, it is deemed to be a spiritual exercise
since what constitutes as “necessary” is left to the consciousness
of the individual, and furthermore the very fact that its
compliance can not to be imposed or scrutinized by anyone
means that avoidance, unlike the case of taxation which is
imposed and heavily scrutinized, is a non-issue.

Along with the important institution of Huqúqu’lláh, Shoghi
Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith, called for
coordination of economic resources of the world: “The
economic resources of the world will be organized, its sources
of raw materials will be tapped and fully utilized, its markets
will be coordinated and developed, and the distribution of its
products will be equitably regulated” [WOB 203-204]. Clearly, this
would require striking the balance between national ownership
and utilization of natural resources globally. However, in the
context of the universally accepted principles of world
citizenship, striking this balance would not be as challenging.

The role of laws, regulations, taxation

As part of the role of Society and its responsibilities,
fundamental changes in laws, regulations and economic
structures must take place that would directly address the
relationship between capital and labor. In a statement of the
Bahá’í International Community, February 12, 1993, “Human
Rights and Extreme Poverty” it is noted that the economic
system shall evolve to adequately address the issues of wealth
distribution: “Although it will resemble the present system in
many ways, the evolving economic system which Bahá’ís

envision will have significant points of distinction.” One of the
key points of distinction is the Bahá’í view on income
distribution, which allows for differences in wealth between
individuals, but would also allow for societies to eliminate both
extreme wealth and extreme poverty.

The accumulation of excessive fortunes by a small number of
individuals, while the masses are in need, is, according to Bahá’í
teachings, an inequity and an injustice. Moderation should,
therefore, be established by means of laws and regulations that
would hinder the accumulation of excessive fortunes by a few
individuals and provide for the essential needs of the masses.
Among the methods that future societies may adopt in order to
achieve this objective is a modification in the taxation system—
‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke about an innovative and revolutionary
method of taxation to eliminate extremes of wealth and
poverty:

> Each person in the community whose need is equal to his
> individual producing capacity shall be exempt from
> taxation. But if his income is greater than his needs, he
> must pay a tax until an adjustment is effected. That is to
> say, a man’s capacity for production and his needs will
> be equalized and reconciled through taxation. If his
> production exceeds, he will pay a tax; if his necessities
> exceed his production, he shall receive an amount
> sufficient to equalize or adjust. Therefore, taxation will
> be proportionate to capacity and production, and there
> will be no poor in the community. [PUP 217]

Clearly, future generations of economists, lawyers, tax
accountants, and policy makers would have to devise a fair
regulatory regime that would consider needs of individuals as
well as their capacity for income generation. This is another
example of how legal or structural solutions must be developed
as part of a society’s responsibility to eliminate extremes of
wealth and poverty.

5\. Role of Global Institutions and their
responsibilities

In addition to detailing the responsibilities at the individual
and societal levels, Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá’í
Faith, called upon the creation of world institutions with
powers far surpassing the present day international institutions:
o A world legislature, whose members will, as the trustees

> of the whole of mankind, ultimately control the entire
> resources of all the component nations, and will enact
> such laws as shall be required to regulate the life, satisfy
> the needs and adjust the relationships of all races and
> peoples.
o A world executive, backed by an international Force, will

> carry out the decisions arrived at, and apply the laws
> enacted by, this world legislature, and will safeguard the
> organic unity of the whole commonwealth.
o A world tribunal will adjudicate and deliver its

> compulsory and final verdict in all and any disputes that
> may arise between the various elements constituting this
> universal system....
o Strong globally-empowered world institutions that can

> coordinate universal ownership of resources and their
> fair distribution internationally [Call to Nations]
It is now universally accepted that the current global
institutions do not have the mandate or the resources to be
effective in addressing global problems like poverty. Much
stronger empowered institutions are needed to adequately
address global issues and eradicate arbitrage opportunities.
Without adequately empowered global institutions, the
economic resources of the world cannot be organized and
managed in a manner that shall be conducive to the realization
of the unity of human race.

> The unity of the human race, as envisaged by
> Bahá’u’lláh, implies the establishment of a world
> commonwealth in which all nations, races, creeds and
> classes are closely and permanently united, and in which
> the autonomy of its state members and the personal
> freedom and initiative of the individuals that compose
> them are definitely and completely safeguarded. [WOB
> 203]

> The economic resources of the world will be organized,
> its sources of raw materials will be tapped and fully
> utilized, its markets will be coordinated and developed,
> and the distribution of its products will be equitably
> regulated. [WOB 203-204]

According to a statement prepared under the supervision of
the Universal House of Justice:

> Yet, the unification of humankind under a system of
> governance that can release the full potentialities latent
> in human nature, and allow their expression in programs
> for the benefit of all, is clearly the next stage in the
> evolution of civilization. The physical unification of the
> planet in our time and the awakening aspirations of the
> mass of its inhabitants have at last produced the
> conditions that permit achievement of the ideal,
> although in a manner far different from that imagined
> by imperial dreamers of the past. To this effort the
> governments of the world have contributed the founding
> of the United Nations Organization, with all its great
> blessings, all its regrettable shortcomings....Somewhere

Present day attempts by policy makers to address extremes of
wealth and poverty lack a coherent approach and have been
short on results. It is the integrated holistic approach of the
Bahá’í Faith, providing, at once, (i) a robust set of core
principles for individuals to transform, (ii) an exacting set of
directives for the rich and the poor, (iii) a just allocation of
responsibilities at individual and societal levels, and (iv) the
creation of empowered global institutions, that collectively can
adequately reverse the rise of amorality, and in turn, effectively
address the complexities surrounding our trajectory towards
extremes of wealth and poverty in a world that is rapidly
becoming globalized and in want of equitable distribution of
resources.
