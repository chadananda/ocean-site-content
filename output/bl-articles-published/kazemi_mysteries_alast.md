Mysteries of Alast:
The Realm of Subtle Entities (‘Ālam-i dharr) and the Primordial Covenant in the
Babi-Baha’i Writings

Farshid Kazemi

Abstract

One of the more esoteric terms in Shi‘i-Shaykhi thought that has found its way into the
vast corpus of the Babi-Baha’i sacred scriptures is called ‘the realm of subtle entities’ or
‘ālam-i dharr (lit. world of particles). The source of inspiration for this term (dharr) in the
early Shi’i cosmology and cosmogony lies in one of the more important and dramatic
scenes which informs the whole spectrum of Islamic thought, namely the primordial
covenant of Qur’an 7:171-2. It is there, in what seems to be pre-existence, that God
addresses humanity in the form of particles or seeds (dharr) saying, ‘Am I not your
Lord?’ (alastu bi-rabbikum) while the archetype or potential of all future generations of
humanity responds with the loving reply, ‘Yes.’ (balā) In light of the significance of this
term for the Covenant in the Babi-Baha’i revelations it is surprising that there has only
been but passing references to it in some secondary Baha’i sources. In this paper we will
outline the history and background of this term and examine some of the interpretations
or hermeneutics accorded to it by select examination of its use in Shi‘ism, Shaykhism,
and the Babi-Baha’i religions. Among other themes that will be touched upon in relation
to ‘alam-i-dharr is the hermeneutics of the pre-existence of souls, the question of free will
and predestination, the seven stages of creation (marātib-i sab‘ih), and the mystic colour
hierarchies (alwān).

‘Hast thou forgotten the covenant that thou made with God before the creation of the
universe—in the realm of the timeless [dharr al-baqā]?’1

Among the cryptic terms which one encounters not infrequently throughout the whole
corpus of the Babi-Baha’i Scriptures, is one which designates a mysterious region known
as ‘ālam-i dharr (in Arabic ‘ālam adh-dharr), the ‘realm of subtle entities’2, or more
literally ‘the world of particles’. This enigmatic term, which has its origins in a
primordial covenant (‘ahd/mithāq) between God and humanity in the Qur’an, has a long
heritage in early primitive Shi‘ism3 (tashayyu‘), Sufism (tassawuf),4 and Shaykhism
(shaykhiyya). Indeed there exists a certain homology between primitive Shi‘ism,
Shaykhism, and the Babi-Baha’i hermeneutics of ‘alam-i dharr, yet with the writings of
the Bab, Baha’u’llah and Abdu’l-Baha, this term - among many other Islamic categories -
undergoes a subtle transformation by way of a new and novel divine hermeneutics
(ta’wīl-i ilāhī).

In primitive Shi‘ism ‘alam-i dharr is situated in meta-history and is subdivided into two
metaphysical worlds. It is there, in pre-existence, that the covenant between God and
humanity was first drawn up, not only regarding God, but with regard to the Prophet
Muhammad, Imam ‘Ali and all the Imams, as well as the daughter of the Prophet, Fatima,
namely the Fourteen Pure Ones (chahārdah ma‘sūmīn). In Shaykhi metaphysics this
same covenantal element is continued but with a clearer situating of ‘alam-i dharr in the
emanative stages of creation or arc of descent. Also, the dialectic of free will and
necessity is worked out in relation to this realm and the corresponding existentiation of
creatures according to their response. Finally, in Babi-Baha’i hermeneutics though all
these elements are more or less present, they are radically reinterpreted so that the meta-
history of the Primordial Covenant paradoxically becomes situated in the fact of history,
in the historical appearance of the person of the Manifestation of God. It is through this
cyclical theophanic advent that this Primordial Covenant is perpetually renewed and
whereby beings are existentiated and differentiated according to their response to the
divine call. Their ontological priority or pre-existence is therefore only in relation to the
acknowledgment of the covenant of love which is ‘outside time’. In this study we will
briefly outline, by way of an introduction, this background of the term ‘alam adh-dharr

elements, rather than the later influence of systematic and rational theology. See

and its relation to the Primordial Covenant by select examinations of texts in Shi‘ism,
Shaykhism and finally its use and hermeneutics in the Babi-Baha’i writings.

‘Alam-i dharr and the Primordial Covenant in Shi‘ism

The word dharr under discussion here which variously means seed, particle, mote, or
atom, has its origin in Qur’an 7:171-2 (henceforward Q 7:171-2), and is related to a meta-
temporal and meta-historical event: Sacred Time (in illo tempore). It was there that God
entered into a Primordial Covenant with the particles or seeds or potentialities (dharr) of
humankind (Adamic anthropos) :

> And when thy Lord took from the Children of Adam,
> From their loins, their seed [dhurriyyatahum],
> And made them testify concerning themselves,
> ‘Am I not your Lord?’ [alastu bi-rabbikum]
> They replied, ‘Yes, we bear witness’ [balā shahadnā]

This mytho-history of the Primordial Covenant, which is often referred to as yawm al-
mīthāq or the ‘Day of the Covenant’ has been the source of endless contemplation in
Islamic thought both among the Sunni and the Shi‘i, and especially among the Sufis, who
longed to return to this state of pre-existential being, and among whom it was lovingly
referred to as ‘the Day of Alast’ (Rūz-i alast).5 It has spurred such varied discussions as
the problematic of the pre-existence of souls, the dialectic of free will versus
predestination,6 God’s omnipotence and humankind’s loving reply.7 Though the term

\[5\] The designation ‘the Day of Alast’ appears particularly among the Persian poets, such
as Attar, Rumi, and Hafiz. Various formulations of Alast, such as the ‘wine of Alast’ or
‘the call of Alast’, or ‘the song of Alast’, which have a long history in Persian mystical
poetry are also found in the Baha’i scriptures. It was the Sufi Sahl b. Abdullah Tustari (d.
283/896) who in his meditations on the Primordial Covenant (Q 7:172) first placed the
Platonic recollecting of knowledge of this pre-existential condition of souls in the world
of dharr at the centre of his theoretical conceptions of dhikr (remembrance of God). See
Gerhard Böwering, The Mystical Vision of Existence in Classical Islam (Berlin: de Gruyter,
1980) 45-9, 201-7; also G. Böwering, ‘Ideas of Time in Persian Sufism’, in Leonard
Lewisohn, ed., The Heritage of Sufism, vol. 1 (Oxford: Oneworld, 1999) 219-20. The
idea of recollection of the pre-existential state of gnosis is also mentioned by the Sufi
Dhu’l-Nun al-Misri (d.246/861) who is cited in this connection by perhaps the most
influential Sufi theoretician in Islam, namely Muhyi al-Din Ibn al-‘Arabi (d. 638/1240);
see William C. Chittick, The Sufi Path of Knowledge (Albany : State University of New
York Press, 1989) 155-5, 399. This element of pre-existential knowledge in Shaykhi,
Babi, and Baha’i hermeneutics is discussed below.

\[6\] Regarding the issue of free will versus predestination in Shi‘ism, Daniel Gimaret (‘Free
Will in Twelver Shi‘ism’, in Encyclopedia Iranica at http://www.iranica.com/newsite),
citing Kulayni and Ibn Babawayh, states, ‘On the question of free will, the whole view of
the Imams amounts to a famous saying by Imam Ja’far al-S@ādiq (d. 148/765): lā jabr
wa lā tafwīd@ wa lākin amr bayn amrayn “neither complete constraint nor complete

‘Covenant’ (‘ahd/mithaq) does not appear in this passage, it has nevertheless been
conceptually linked to it for centuries by all subsequent Islamic commentary.

In Shi‘ism, this mytho-history of the Primordial Covenant is extended to the
Fourteen Pure Ones. It is captured in the idea of walāyah, which is the quintessential
feature of Shi‘i religious consciousness. The term walayah is often inadequately
translated as ‘sainthood’, and is notoriously difficult to render into a single English word,
as it has the various shades of meanings of love, fidelity, friendship, guardianship, etc. In
Shi‘ism it is the idea of the continuation of religio-charismatic authority after the Prophet
through the person of the Imam, to whom fealty, loyalty, and love is owed by the faithful
just as it is to God and the Prophet. It is the idea of the successorship and guardianship
after the Prophet’s death, of the Imam as Divine Guide, within whom lies deposited the
inner mysteries and esoteric (bāt@in) understanding of God’s revelation, and upon whom
its elucidation and elaboration devolves. The Imam is then at once the interpreter and
expounder of the Word of God (i.e. the Qur’an). It is he who is called the Speaking Book,
whilst the Qur’an is called the Silent Book.8 It was these twin repositories of guidance,
namely the Qur’an and his Household (ahl-i bayt), which according to Shi‘i tradition, the
Prophet left the community after his ascension.

The beginning of this covenant of the walayah on the horizontal plane, the plane
of history, is first reflected in the event of Ghadir Khum in an oasis outside Mecca, where
in the Shi‘i liturgical calendar it is known as the ‘Day of the Covenant’ (yawm al-
mithaq). It was there that the Prophet entered into a covenant with the Islamic community
(umma) regarding the Walaya/Guardianship and Successorship of ‘Ali (d. 40/661) as the
spirituo-temporal leader of the community after himself. In a famed Tradition (hadith, a
traditional utterance of the Prophet Muhammad, which in a Shi‘i context also includes the
sayings of the Imams and is as often referred to as akhbār), which is attributed to the
Prophet by both the Sunni and the Shi‘i sources, this event is described thus:

> We were with the Apostle of God in his journey and we stopped at Ghadir
> Khumm. We performed the obligatory prayer together . . . And then he took ‘Ali
> by the hand and said to the people: ‘Do you not acknowledge that I have a greater
> claim on each of the believers then they have on themselves?’ And they replied:
> ‘Yea verily’ [bala]. And he took ‘Ali’s hand and said: ‘Of whomsoever I am lord

freedom but something in between”.’ This same middle view is espoused and elaborated
in the Babi-Baha’i writings.

[mawla], then ‘Ali is also his lord. O God! Be Thou the supporter of whoever
supports ‘Ali and the enemy of whoever opposes him.’9

As is plain from the above passage the word ‘Yea verily’ (bala), which is precisely the
assent of humanity at the scene of the Primordial Covenant (Q 7:171-2), is uttered by the
Muslim faithful in recognition of ‘Ali as their Lord or Master after the Prophet. It should
also be mentioned that here the word mawla is related to the word wali or walayah,
which according to a characteristically Shi‘i interpretation of this event demonstrates the
incontrovertible fact of the walayah of ‘Ali, his Guardianship and designation as such by
the Prophet.

On the vertical plane, however, this event is said to have its archetype in pre-
existence, in the realm of ‘alam-i dharr, where the covenant was taken for the walayah of
Ali before all existence, as Kohlberg states,

> In other traditions it is stated that the walaya (principle of loyalty to Ali and the
> other Imams) existed before the creation, and that the formula ‘‘Ali amir al-
> mu’minin’ is engraved on the upper part of God’s throne. [Kulayni, Kafi 1:224.]
> After the creation of Adam, when all future generations of man were assembled at
> ‘Arafa in the form of atoms (. . . dharr), they solemnly acknowledged not only
> Allah’s divinity (as stated in Qur’an 7:172), but also Muhammad’s prophethood
> and ‘Ali’s walaya.10

Thus in a long Tradition, God addresses the Prophet and the Imams in the ‘alam-i dharr
(the world of the primordial covenant), thus: ‘I have appointed you intercessors for Me.
All things are passing away except My face, and you are My face which never perishes
[cf. Qur’an 28:88], and he who turns toward you will likewise never perish.’11

One of the important motifs underlying the whole of these arcane Traditions, is
not only that the Prophet and the Imams were pre-existent in the world of dharr, but that
the votaries of the Imams, the Shi‘i faithful, or mu’minīn, are also pre-existent in that
world, as Corbin observed: ‘By contrast, the awareness that the mu’min or believer has of
his origins, and of the future on which the meaning of his present life depends, is centred
on facts which are real, but which belong to metahistory. The sense of his origin is
perceived in the question which God, on the ‘Day of the Covenant’, asked of Adamic
humanity, before this humanity was transferred to the terrestrial plane. No system of
chronology can fix the date of this ‘Day of the Covenant’, which takes place during the

time of that pre-existence of souls which Shi‘ism in general affirms.’12 In one tradition
reported on the authority of Bukayr ibn A’yan this premise seems to be demonstrated:

> Verily God, blessed and exalted is He, took the Covenant from our Shi‘is for
> walayah toward us when they were particles (dharr) on the day when He took the
> Covenant of the particles [dharr] to affirm Himself, as Lord, and Muhammad as
> Prophet. And He showed Muhammad his community (ummatahu) in the clay
> (t@īnah), and they were shadows (az@illah), and He made them from the clay
> from which He created Adam; and He created the spirits (arwāh@) of our Shi‘is a

> were recognized by the Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) and
> by ‘Ali b. Abi Talib (peace be upon him) and we recognize them by the peculiar
> nature of their speech (lah@n).13

Similarly, Newman states: ‘. . . the Imams alluded to a pre-existential world in which
Allah agreed with the Shi‘ah, when they existed in the form of particles (dharr), a pact in
which they pledged their affection (al-walayah) for the Imams. Allah then gave them
form using the same clay that He used for Adam and the other prophets.’14

In primitive Shi‘i cosmology and cosmogony ‘alam adh-dharr therefore is
envisaged as a metaphysical world. Again and again the earliest Shi‘i Traditions from the
Imams relate to the pre-existence of the Prophet Muhammad and the Imams, as well as
worlds (‘awālim) which they and the essence of their faithful inhabited before the
creation of the world. In these traditions as we have seen, reference is made to ‘alam adh-
dharr al-awwal, or the first world of particles, which is precisely one of these pre-
existential worlds in which the Prophet and the Imams exist as shadows (az@illa) or
silhouettes of light (ashbāh) before the creation of the world and wherein they enter into
a covenant (mithaq/‘ahd) with their votaries before the creation of all things. In this early
Shi‘i cosmology the worlds are respectively named:

1\. Mother of the Book (Umm al-Kitab)
2\. The first world of particles/the world of shadows/the world of the covenant
3\. The second world of particles
4\. The material sensible world

The first metaphysical world is then the world of the Mother of the Book. It is in this
world that the subtle light of Muhammad first emanated forth from God and from which
the light of ‘Ali originated thereafter. Amir-Moezzi indicates that the ‘second world,’

called in the texts ‘the first world of shadows’ (‘alam al-az@illa al-awwal) or ‘the first
world of particles’ (‘alam adh-dharr al-awwal), is also the same ‘stage that the divine
throne15 was created’. Furthermore, ‘the first world of shadows’ is also known in the texts
as the ‘world of the covenant’ (‘alam al-mithaq), for it was in this first world of particles
in which God concluded the primordial covenant with the ‘pure beings.’ These ‘pure
beings’ were the shadows of future spiritual beings and non-human entities, which
include the Prophets and the believers.16 Amir-Moezzi continues, stating that, ‘this
covenant encompassed four solemn oaths…the promise to adore God and the promises of
love for and fidelity (walaya) to Muhammad and his prophetic mission, to the imams and
their sacred cause, and to the Mahdi, the universal saviour at the end of time.’ It was also
in the first world of particles/shadows/covenant that ‘the shadows of the “pure beings”
are said to have been initiated by the luminous entities of the immaculate ones [The
fourteen Pure Ones] into the secrets of the two sacred sciences of unification and
glorification, well before the creation of the other shadows… these secrets were the four
sacred formulas lā elāha ellā’llāh, sobh@āna’llāh, al-h@amdo le’llāh, and Allāho
akbar.’ In this regard Amir-Moezzi rightly observes that, ‘even the number of these
formulas [i.e. four], which contain the most sublime mysteries, has a cosmic value, for it
is because of these four that the throne and all the sanctuaries occupying the
superimposed centers of the seven heavens and the seven earths are cubical.’17 Then
comes the last stage before the creation of the sensible world, which is called ‘the second
world of particles’ (dharr) where the creation of the descendants of Adam in the form of
particles (dharr) takes place and where they are ‘divided into “people of the right”
(as@h@āb al-yamīn), characterized by their obedience to God, and “people of the left”
(as@h@āb al-shemal), who refused to obey the divine order.’18

In light of the above it is interesting to note that in a sermon attributed to Imam
‘Ali called Khutbat al-Tutanjiyya, (Sermon of the Gulf) reference is also made to the first
world of particles (adh-dharr al-awwal). Here the Imam in a series of profound
theophanic utterances states: ‘I know of the wonders of God’s creation, which none save
God knoweth, and with me is the knowledge of what hath been and what shall be and
what transpired with those who preceded the time of the first particles (adh-dharr al-
awwal) which belongeth to the First Adam (adam al-awwal).’19

\[15\] See discussion of the Divine Throne below

\[16\] In this connection, in reply to the question ‘How then did they [the pure beings]
respond if they were only particles (dharr)’, Ja‘far al-Sadiq said: ‘In the world of the Pact
[al-mithaq], [God] instilled in them that which they needed to answer his question.’;
Amir-Moezzi, Divine Guide 163n.182. Note here that Ja‘far al-Sadiq clearly equates the
stage of particles (dharr) with the world of the covenant (mithaq).

\[17\] This quaternary or four solemn oaths/pact/covenant has significant typological
ramifications in the idea of the covenant in the Babi-Baha’i Revelation (see below).

The whole primordial drama of the covenant is brought onto the plane of history
in the episode in which the ‘People of the Cloak’ (ahl al-kisā’), namely the prophet
Muhammad, ‘Ali, Fatimah, Hasan and Husayn, (which Persian tradition calls the panj tan
or the Temple of the Pentad) were present when the famous debate (mubahalah)
occurred between the Prophet and the Christian delegation from Najran. Here the motifs
of the Imams as silhouettes of light (ashbah) and shadows (azilla, azlal) which we
encountered in the pre-existential time of the first world of particles serve as symbolic
signifiers to locate the primordial in the temporal. It was upon the visionary topography
of the Crimson Sandhill or kathīb ah@mar20 that the luminous forms of the ‘People of
the Cloak’ irradiated forth before the delegation. Massignon relates this initiatory scene
in this manner:

> The Shi‘ite school of the Mukhammisa was interested in interpreting in all of its
> symbolism, the mubahala scene. At the cemetery in Medina, at the bottom of the
> Baqi‘, on the red dune (kathib ahmar), we see the Five standing under the Mantle,

> of the amazed Najranian Christians. At the call of the Initiator, they recognize the
> Five in their glorious transfiguration (tajalli). Their halo of lightning flashes

> bodies are shadows (azilla, azlal) cast by Divine Light, silhouettes (ashbah)
> temporarily outlined in the divine emanation, exempted from the generation and
> corruption of suffering and death.21

In this episode we see that the People of the Cloak are described as having manifested the
same form of apparitional lights and luminous forms that they are said to have possessed
in pre-existence in ‘alam adh-dharr and yet this event is precisely situated in history in

\[20\] The Crimson Sandhill (kathib-i ahmar) refers to one of the way stations of the
pilgrimage (hajj). It is also mentioned in some of the early Traditions, in which it is
related to the tomb of Moses. However, its visionary dimension maybe discerned in the
fact that the Prophet saw Moses by his tomb during his Night Journey (‘isra). According
to tradition, it is also said to be located in the holy hand between Jerusalem and Jericho;
see Moshe Sharon, Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum Palaestinae, vol. 3 (Brill: Leiden,

what is described as the Crimson Sandhill (kathib ahmar). It is here that we may discern
the seeds of the Babi-Baha’i hermeneutics of ‘alam adh-dharr (see below) and of the
initiatory covenant of love drawn up with the faithful regarding him and the succession of
lights after him, namely the covenant of faithfulness to the reality of walayah.

Another Tradition attributed to Ja‘far al-Sadiq which has similar implications for
our theme, is one in which at once both the theophanic station of the Imam as the locus of
the knowable or revealed aspect of God is announced and the whole pre-existential drama
of the primordial covenant (Q 7:171) is historicized.

> Abu Basir has related that he said to Abu ‘Abdallah [Ja‘far as-Sādiq] – upon
> whom be peace – ‘Tell me about God, the Mighty, and Majestic. Will believers
> see Him on the Day of Resurrection?’ He answered, ‘Yes, and they have already
> seen Him before the Day of Resurrection.’ Abu Basir asked, ‘When?’ The Imam
> answered, ‘When He said to them, “Am I not your Lord?” They said: “Yes,
> verily”’ (VII, 172). Then he was quiet for a time. Then he said, ‘Truly the
> believers see Him in this world before the Day of Resurrection. Dost thou not see
> Him now?’22

Here the Imam is stating that he is the locus of the manifestation (mazhar) of God or
Deus revelatus, and that seeing him in this station is to see God.23 It is also important to
note that since the Resurrection will be heralded with the advent of the Qa’im, the
Twelfth Imam, it is he who is the locus of the manifestation of God, Deus revelatus and it
is this that mankind will see God on the Day of Resurrection, and not the essence of God,
who is Deus absconditus, the unknowable God. Here then the whole covenantal drama
has the effect of being situated in the eschatological advent of the Qa’im, which is as the
day of the primordial covenant. It is in this light that the advent of the Bab as Qa’im and
as the Manifestation of God may be discerned.

It is of interest to note that that the fourth oath in the world of the
particles/shadows/covenant (see the above quotation from Amir-Moezzi) is regarding the
Mahdi and that the form of its expression is Allāhu akbar (God is Great!). It is here that
we may discern the profundity of Corbin’s observation that Shaykhism was the ‘revival
of primitive Shi‘ite Gnosis’,24 that is, the pure teachings of the Imams. As we shall see
these four oaths are revived in Shaykhism and in the writings of the Bab, who is precisely
the promised Mahdi/Qa’im. Indeed the new initiatory salutation of the faithful (Babis) of

pertaining to the Mahdi.25 It is not difficult to see that the Shaykhi-Babi doctrine of the
Fourth Support is already present here. This quaternary of ‘an oath of worship
(‘ubudiyya) of God, oaths of love and fidelity (walaya) toward Muhammad and his
prophetic mission, toward the imams and their sacred Cause, and also toward the Mahdi
as universal saviour at the end of time’26, is therefore revived once again in a novel
hermeneutical turn in the quaternary structure of the covenant in the Babi-Baha’i
revelation vis-à-vis the conceptual framework of dharr.

The Shaykhi background of ‘Alam al-dharr and the Primordial Covenant

The powerful and charismatic figure of Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa’i (d. 1242/1826) and his
disciple and successor Sayyid Kazim Rashti (d.1259/1843) are considered by Baha’is to
be the twin heralds of the Babi-Baha’i religions.27 Their profound works, which have as
yet remained under-studied, form the immediate background for understanding some of
the more philosophically abstruse and difficult aspects of the Babi-Baha’i scriptures, not
least the concept of ‘alam adh-dharr. In the works of Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa’i, ‘alam adh-
dharr is precisely linked to his meditations on the Primordial Covenant and the related
problematic of free will and predestination, good and evil, and are developed on this basis
via a complex alchemical physiology, soteriology, and eschatology grounded in his
contemplations and exegesis of Qur’an 7:171.

In one of his major works called al-Fawá’id al-H@ikmiyyah, Shaykh Ahmad
refers to two distinct stages of the coming into being of creation, called the ‘first creation’
(al-khalq al-awwal) and the ‘second creation’ (al-khalq al-thānī). The ‘first creation’ may
be said to belong to the stages of Will (mashiyyat) and Purpose (irādah), and the ‘second
creation’ to the stage of Predestination (qadar) and Fate (qad@ā).

The Shaykh’s cosmogony starts the process of creation not in the essence of the
Godhead, which for him is pure unbelief (shirk), but in the Primordial Will of God
(mashiyyat). In the Shaykh’s lexicon this Primal Will is coterminous with the
Muhammadan Reality, and is designated variously as the Command (amr) of God, the

\[25\] Persian Bayan, 6:5, cited in Denis MacEoin, Rituals in Babism and Bahaism (London:
British Academic Press, 1994) 14. It is interesting to note here that in Shaykh Ahmad’s
colour mysticism, the four oaths of primitive Shi‘ite cosmology and cosmogony are
assigned respectively the four colours of the Hadith of the Throne: subh@āna-llah
[White], al-hāmdu li’llāh [Yellow], lā ilāha illā’llāh [Green], and in particular Allāhu
akbar is related to the colour Red or Crimson; see Stephen Lambden, ‘Kaleidoscope:

Crimson in relation to ‘alam adh-dharr will become more evident below.

Word (kalimah) of God and the Muhammadan Light.28 Among the many reported
sayings of the Shi‘i Imams which informs the metaphysics and cosmology of Shaykh
Ahmad, one of the utterances of Imam Ja‘far al-Sadiq is of particular importance in this
regard, namely, the famed Tradition of mashiyyat (Will). Jafar al-Sadiq states, ‘God
created the Will through its own self (bi-nafsihā), and created all things (al-ashyā’),
through the Will.’29 For Shaykh Ahmad the process of creation, is precisely a process of
action (fi‘l) that takes place through four stages, which are most crucial for the coming
into existence of any ‘thing’ (shay’)30. The Shaykh states:

> …the creative action that is connected to existence is the Will, and by the
> archetype (al-‘ayn), i.e. the species form (al-surat al-naw’iyah), it becomes
> Purpose (iradah), and by the [intelligible] limitation of the created, i.e. design,
> like length and breadth, stability and change, fixed time, and the like, it becomes
> Predestination (qadar), and by the realization of the act of creation and the thing
> itself, it becomes Fate (qada)…. The fashioning of each existent is completed by
> these four actions [i.e. Will, Purpose, Predestination, and Fate].31

According to Shaykh Ahmad ‘alam adh-dharr pertains to the ‘second creation’. Shaykh
Ahmad states that the second creation begins in the stage of Predestination (qadar).

> … predestination [qadar], which is the stage of existentiational topography

magnitudes, temporal and atemporal modes . . . The beginning of the second
creation occurs in this stage [qadar], the start of felicity and misery.32

Shaykh Ahmad refers to the attribute of existence of a thing as proceeding from the
actional Will of God and its essence as proceeding from the stage of Purpose. He
maintains that every created thing is a composite of existence and essence, the aspect of
existence being derived from the actional Will of God and being the cause of matter
(māddah), and the essence being derived from Purpose and being the cause of form
(sūrah), which is related to the creatures own potentiality and receptivity (i.e. essence).
Here Shaykh Ahmad radically turns the traditional Aristotelian doctrine of hylomorphism
on its head by making form receptive and matter active, instead of the traditional formula
of matter/receptive and form/active.33 Vahid Brown, has noted that early Isma‘ili
philosophers such as Nasafi and Sijistani were perhaps early proponents of the reversal
theory,34 but a more detailed study is required to establish this interesting theory.
However, it seems that all the sources necessary for the Shaykh’s novel formulation are
already present in the Traditions of the Imams, as Corbin has rightly observed regarding
Shaykh Ahmad’s inspiration, ‘The meaning of the terms of Peripatetic hylomorphism is
reversed: matter is light, being itself, existence. Form is quiddity, compassion, the
shadowy dimension which fixes and defines this light. This is why matter is the father,
the masculine aspect, while form is the mother or feminine aspect, and the ‘imaginal
Form’ (sūrah mithāliyah) is the principle of individuation. Thus the Tradition of the sixth
Imam Ja‘far al-Sādiq finds its justification: “The believer is the brother of the believer
because of their father and mother. Their father is the Light, their mother is Mercy.”
Shaykh Ahmad used the Traditions of the holy Imams in the same creative way to
construct the anthropology characteristic of his school.35

The Shaykh calls the composite of existence and essence Man’s hyle. He states
that ‘this hyle composed of existence and essence is suitable to both the faithful and the
denier; they are only distinguishable by the second form which is the second creation’
[i.e. in the first creation they are indistinguishable and undifferentiated].36 Shaykh Ahmad
goes on to say that, ‘the act of becoming generated constitutes an act of choice on the part
of the created entity in the second creation . . .’37 It is precisely here that the Shaykh in his

\[33\] The term ‘hylomorphism’ comes from the Greek hyle meaning matter, and morphe

Ahmad’s metaphysics, was first noticed by Henry Corbin. See Corbin, History 355. See

reading of the Primordial Covenant of Q 7:171, which includes the covenant of the
Prophet and the walayah of Imam Ali, starts his complex anthropology, soteriology, and
eschatology which ends with situating ‘alam adh-dharr in the ‘second creation’. Here is
an extended passage:

> So when they requested that He [God] question them, He, in His knowledge of
> them, questioned them. So He said to them, ‘Am I not your Lord, and Muhammad
> your Prophet, and ‘Ali your Guardian?’ Then they said altogether, ‘Yes, indeed!’
> [bala] Among them were those who, on the basis of their knowledge, each said it
> with his tongue and heart . . . So He [God] created them from the form [sura] of
> affirmation and cognizance . . . Those are the messengers, the prophets, the
veracious, the martyrs, and the righteous.

And among them were those who each said it with his tongue while his

These forms created from either positive response or denial constitute the
> clay [tīnah]. It is the mother in whose belly the felicitous become felicitous; and
> the miserable become miserable . . .38

Then Shaykh Ahmad concludes his profound exegesis with this statement: ‘So this is the
second creation, under the green light, in the world of shadows, in the leaf of myrtle, thus
they were, in the world of motes [‘alam adh-dharr]…. Then He differentiated them in the
red light; this is the meaning of his saying (peace be upon him): then He returned them to
clay, that is the clay of nature.’39

It is interesting to note that Shaykh Ahmad equates the world of shadows (alam
al-azilla) and the world of particles (‘alam adh-dharr) just as it is in the akhbar of the

\[38\] Hamid, Metaphysics 309-10. The Shaykh virtually repeats the same argument in his
Sharh@ al-‘Arshiyya (commentary on the Throne), which he wrote as a critique of Mulla
Sadra, while again mentioning Qur’an 7:171 and ‘alam adh-dharr; see Corbin, Spiritual
Body 219-221.

\[39\] Hamid, Metaphysics 311.
Imams in primitive Shi‘i cosmogony and cosmology. He also gives two stages to the
world of particles, one undifferentiated and the second differentiated. The first is
distinguished with symbolism of the green light, which in the Shaykh’s lexicon
corresponds to ‘ālam al-malakūt (world of the Kingdom) and the stage of Predestination
(qadar), where creatures remain undifferentiated. In the second stage it is distinguished
by the symbolism of the red clay (red light), or the clay of nature (al-tabi‘at). It
corresponds to ‘ālam al-nāsūt (the physical world), and the stage of Fate (qada), where
creatures are differentiated according to their own volition. The mystical symbolism of
colour acts as a signifier for designating the proper hierarchy of worlds, and is also
repeated in the Babi-Baha’i sacred texts (see Figure 1).40

It is worth mentioning here that the colour crimson also frequently occurs in the
Shaykh’s alchemical theories and forms the basis of his novel contemplations on the
resurrection body. In one passage, Shaykh Ahmad states that if the white elixir acts upon
tin, which corresponds to the elemental body, it will become silver, which corresponds to
body which survives ‘in the tomb’ and into which the spirit enters from the paradise of
this world. If the red elixir then acts upon this, it becomes gold, which corresponds with
the body which departs with the spirit from the corporeal body after death and enters the
paradise of this world. If the red elixir is projected onto it a second time, it becomes an
elixir itself, which corresponds to the essential resurrection body which will gain
admittance into the paradise of the hereafter. That this gold has become an elixir is a sign
and proof that this was latent in the reality of the tin.41 It is clear that the Shaykh wishes
to situate the whole process of resurrection as a spiritual process occurring within the
individual, for just as gold is hidden and latent within the reality of tin, so the resurrection
body is hidden within the reality of the individual. It is a transformation or transmutation
occurring within the same substance/person via the red elixir that brings about the
resurrection. It was this profound transformation of the notion of the resurrection, which
was to prove one of the most troubling doctrines for the more exoteric ‘ulama who were
to renounce our Shaykh as a heretic. It is here as well that we may discern that the
Shaykh’s correspondence of the transmutation of the resurrection body through the
symbolism of the red elixir42 is precisely linked to the red clay/red light related to the

\[40\] This mystical symbolism of colour has its origin in the Tradition of the Throne (al-
‘arsh) ascribed to Imam ‘Ali (cf. the Imam’s interpretation of the Throne as ‘the Religion
of Truth’; see note 66 below). For an excellent treatment of the motif of mystic colour
symbolism in the Babi-Baha’i writings, see Vahid Rafati, Alvān dar Āthār-i Bahā’ī

Brown in ‘Some Alchemy Texts of Shaykh Ah@mad’,
http://users.sisqtel.net/kevenbrown/ShaykhAhmadAlchemy.htm. See also Henry Corbin,
Spiritual Body and Celestial Earth 180-221. In the Babi-Baha’i writings the elixir has
various shades of meaning and is at times equated with the person of the Bab and
Baha’u’llah or their scriptures.

\[42\] The alchemical concept of the red elixir (iksīr ah@mar) may be said to be conceptually
linked with the famed red sulphur (kibrīt ah@mar), which has a long heritage in Islamic

world of nāsūt (nature), and to the stage of Fate/Decree (qad@ā) in the seven stages of
creation and finally to the earth of ‘alam adh-dharr, or the pleroma of the covenant.

Idris Hamid in his reading of Shaykh Ahmad’s discussion of alam ad-dharr
correctly states that:

> . . .the world of motes (‘alam ad-dharr) is the universe in which the question,
> ‘Am I not your Lord?’ is asked at the moment of the creation of each individual
> soul. This world, for Shaykh Ahmad, lies in the lower regions of the mundus
> intelligibilis, where the oneness of the ‘universal soul’ (an-nafs al-kulliyyat, in the
> ‘green light’), gives way to the diversity of individual souls in the world of nature
> (at-tabi‘at, in the ‘red light’).43

Regarding Shaykh Ahmad’s discussion of Q 7:172, Hamid further observes that, ‘God’s
question symbolizes the giving of existence. The affirmative reply (yes/bala) symbolizes
the receiving of this existence (i.e. via the essence).’44 He concludes that,

> According to Shaykh Ahmad, the act of becoming-generated constitutes an act of
> choice on the part of the created entity in the second creation. In the inner reality
> of things, each of us chooses, at the very moment of our creation, whether we
> accept our existentiation or not. This accepting or rejecting is regarded as
> constituting an essential modality of a quintessence’s act of becoming. In other
> words, essences are in a sense acts of self-creation.’45

It is also noteworthy that Shaykh Ahmad’s first creation seems to correspond to the first
world of particles/shadows/covenant in the primitive Shi‘ite gnosis of the Imams, and his
second creation seems to echo the second world of particles where distinctions are made

alchemy and is attested in the spiritual lexicon of Shi‘ism and Sufism; see Abu ar-Rayhan

the Red Sulphur (Cambridge : Islamic Texts Society, 1993) 112n.10. Baha’u’llah often in
his writings equates rarity with the red sulphur; for example the station of martyrdom

‘Alam adh-dharr and the Primordial Covenant in the Writings of the Bab

According to Baha’i belief, the Bab (d. 1850), is the martyr-herald of the Baha’i Faith
and at once the promised one of Islam, the Qaim/Mahdi, and a Manifestation of God. He
forms with Baha’u’llah the Twin Manifestations of God in the Baha’i Dispensation. The
writings of the Bab are often enigmatic and difficult to understand as they are couched in
the mystical and esoteric lexicon of its Shi‘i-Shaykhi milieu, and also because the Bab
himself at times deliberately made out of his writings an elaborate cipher only to be
properly decoded by the promised messianic figure of the Bayan, namely, ‘Him whom
God shall make manifest’ (man yaz@harullāh), whom Baha’is believe to be Baha’u’llah.
Indeed the decoding and unveiling of the true intent and nature of his revelation and
writings itself was to be one of the supreme signs of ‘Him whom God shall make
manifest’. In the early writings of the Bab, the concept of dharr, echoing the Shaykhi
heritage of the Fourth Support, is situated in the conceptual framework of the covenantal
quaternary of Divine Unity, Prophethood, Imamate, and the Shi‘a, which may be termed
the quaternal logic of the covenant. In his later writings, such as the Persian Bayan, the
Bab situates ‘alam adh-dharr in relation to the appearance of the Manifestation of God
(i.e. himself) on the plane of history, and discusses the spiritual correspondence and unity
between the heavenly worlds and the earthly domain, or what may be termed the
Hermetic dictum of ‘as above, so below’, or the doctrine of tashrī‘ and takwīn (see
below). Let us now first turn to the Shaykhi background and the early writings of the Bab
in which the term dharr appears in the quaternal framework of the covenant.

As we have seen one of the emblematic paradigms of Shi‘i spirituality lies in the
concept of walayah, so much so that Corbin called Shi‘ism ‘the religion of Walaya’.47 In
the five pillars of Shi‘i belief (us@ul ad-din), three of which it shares with Sunnism, the
added pillars of Justice (‘adl) and the walayah of the Imamate were the defining character
of Shi‘i mythos. The five pillars being:

1\. Tawhid (Divine Unity)
2\. Nubuwwah (Prophethood)
3\. Imamate
4\. Resurrection
5\. Justice

These five pillars or usul were the foundation of Shi‘ite religious consciousness for
centuries until in the works of Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa’i (less clearly pronounced) and
Sayyid Kazim Rashti (more clearly pronounced) these five pillars were in a radical turn
reduced to four, corresponding to the primitive Shi‘ite gnosis of the Imams, by the
conjoining of divine unity with justice, and prophethood with resurrection and by adding

\[47\] Henry Corbin in Shi‘ism: Doctrines, Thought, and Spirituality (ed. Seyyed Hossein
Nasr, Hamid Dabashi, Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr, New York, 1988) 167. Here the Arabic
word madhhab (school/branch) for Shi‘ism would be more proper, rather than religion
(din) as such.

the doctrine of the Fourth Support (Rukn-i Rāb‘ih) otherwise called the Perfect Shi‘i
(Shi‘i Kāmil), or Gates (Abwāb).48 The four Shaykhi pillars are thus:

1\. Tawhid
2\. Nubuwwah
3\. Imamate
4\. Perfect Shi‘i, The Fourth Support, The Gates

This Shaykhi quaternal structure of the covenant is again and again repeated in the
writings of the Bab and often within the conceptual framework of dharr. The motif of the
quaternary structure as a whole has a cosmic value in the numerico-alphabetic
hermeneutics of the Bab, and profoundly informs his entire scriptural cosmos, and is
directly related to the mysteries of the covenant and its quaternal unity.49 In the Persian
Bayan, the Bab in his discussion of the four words (h@urūf) that constitute bismi llāh al-
man‘a al-quds (In the name of God, the Inaccessible, the Holy) gives a veritable list of
quaternities that form unities (vāh@id) such as: essence, attributes, actions, ‘ibadat
(worship); creation, rizq (sustenance), life, and death; fire, air, water, earth (the four
elements); heart, spirit, soul, inner body (the human reality); white, yellow, green, and
red (the mystic lights).50 Not least among them is the quaternary of Will, Purpose,
Predestination, Fate/Decree. These quaternities as we shall see are often juxtaposed with
each other typifying the homology and correspondence that exists between all the worlds.

In one of the earliest works of the Bab called Risālat as-sulūk ilā ‘Allāh (The
Epistle of Spiritual journey towards God), the Bab mentions the interrelationship of the
covenantal quaternary:

> Indeed Religion is supported by four pillars (bi-arkān arba‘ah): Tawh@īd
> (Divine Unity), Nubuwwa (Prophethood), Walaya (Guardianship), and Shi‘ah (the
> community of true believers).51 These are four gates (abwāb) of which no one is
> of any use without the others. And all of this is the Face of God (wajh allāh),
> which will never perish. And it (i.e. the ‘Face of God’) is the love of the Family of
> God (h@ubb āl Allāh) which is the same as the love of God.52

repr. East Lansing, Mi.: H-Baha’i, 2006). J. Vahid Brown presented a paper ‘Quaternities
of the Writings of the Bab: A Study in Babi and Baha'i Symbolism’, at the Irfan
Colloquia Session, no. 44, Louhelen Bahá'í School: Michigan, USA, October 11-14,
2002, but we have not seen this paper.

\[51\] In yet another place the Bab explicitly mentions Sayyid Kazim Rashti as the pure or
true Shi‘i; see Fadil Mazandarani, Tārīkh-i Z@uhūr al-H@aqq vol. 3 (East Lansing, Mi.:
H-Bahai, 2000) 223.

\[52\] Cited in Lawson, ‘The Bab’s Epistle on the Spiritual Journey towards God’ in Momen,
Baha’i Faith (pp. 231-47) 237. This is an Imamological interpretation of Qur’an 22:88.

It is important to note that the above quaternary is mentioned in light of the dialectic of
the spiritual journey or mystic voyage (sulūk) towards God. It is through the recognition,
or rather gnosis (‘irfān) of the inseparable and conceptual unity of these four oaths of
initiation that one attains the imperishable Face of God, which the Bab affirms is naught
but the love of the Family of God (āl Allah), that is the walayah of the Imamate, or the
covenant of succession after the Prophet, which is the love of God. In this precise sense
the secret of the gnosis of the Divine (‘irfān illāhī, ma‘rifat Allāh) lies in the recognition
of this covenantal quaternary.

Now it is important to state here that in the lexicon of the Bab, mashhad (place of
testimony), rukn (support) and dharr are often used interchangeably in his writings and
are coextensive with one another in his discussions of the tetrad of the covenant.53 The
Bab in his second work, named Tafsir Surat al-Baqara, substitutes the term rukn for
dharr in his discussion of the same quaternary covenant. Here he also equates each stage
with a subtle mystical physiology typifying the spiritual organ relating to the various
stages. This is a subtle juxtapositioning of the arc of ascent or qaws s@u‘ūd (the spiritual
journey) and the arc of descent or qaws nuzūl (descent of creation).

> These signs were placed within (fī) the dimension (dharr) of the hearts [which
> represents] the station (maqam) of Divine Unity (tawhid), and [in] the dimension
> [dharr] of the intellects [which represents] the level (rutba) of Prophethood
> (nubuwwa), and [in] the atoms [dharr] of souls [which represents] the abode of
> the Imamate (imama) and [in] the dimension [dharr] of the bodies [which
> represents] the place (mahall) of the love of the Shi‘a after God imposed this
> solemn binding upon all created things [which is] faith (iman) in Muhammad,
> ‘Ali, Hasan, Husayn, Ja‘far, Musa, and Fatima.54

Thus in the above passage the affirmation of tawhid is equated to the heart, prophethood
to the intellect, Imamate to the soul, and the Shi‘ah to the body. In another terse passage
in the Tafsir Surat al-Baqara, the Bab explicitly alludes to the transcendent scene of the
Primordial Covenant in the Qur’an whilst discussing the same quaternary structure of the
covenant, the importance of the walayah and its appearance on the horizontal plane of
history in the event of Ghadir Khum.

> That place of testimony is the same as the ‘dimension’ (dharr) of the primordial
> covenant (Q 7:171), when the covenant of lordship was taken: whoever was
> recognized [then] was recognized [for all time]. Indeed, ‘those possessed of mind’
> know what happened there by what happened here (Ghadir Khumm), the realm of
> this world (or ‘religion’, tashrī‘) is in accord with the realm of that world (or
> ‘divine creation’ takwīn). But this place of testimony (viz. the Day of al-Ghadir)

\[53\] For the same covenantal quaternary in which mashhad is used in the Bab’s Sura wa l-
‘asr, see Todd Lawson, ‘The Dangers of reading: Inlibration, communion and
transference in the Qur’ān Commentary of the Bāb’ in Scripture and Revelation (ed.
Moojan Momen, London: George Ronald, 1997) 185-91.

> word of magnification in the midmost sanctity of praise.55

Here then, the quaternary structure is repeated once again in the framework of dharr. It is
important here to mention the four solemn oaths (mithaq) of primitive Shi‘i cosmology
and cosmogony – which as we have seen were drawn up in the first world of particles
(‘alam adh-dharr al-awwal) – are repeated verbatim here by the Bab. It was there that the
fourth oath was precisely the oath of allegiance to the Qa’im /Mahdi. Here the Bab also
makes the fourth oath/covenant co-incident with the Qa’im and in a radical turn equates it
with the Shaykhi Fourth Support. In this pre-proclamatory work, the Bab’s novel
hermeneutical turn opens the exegetical gate to his future declaration to be the
Mahid/Qa’im, the eschatological Lord of the Age (sahib zaman).

In the above, the Bab also mentions the doctrine of tashrī‘ (revelation) and takwin
(creation)56, or what we have termed the Hermetic dictum of ‘as above, so below,’ which
is one of the foundational hermeneutical categories that lies at the heart of the Babi-
Baha’i scriptural cosmos. This hermeneutical category may be said to permeate the whole
of the Babi-Baha’i textual universe. At the very centre of its axis, is the autonomous
figure of the Manifestation of God (maz@har ilāhī), the Primal Will (mashiyyat
awwaliyya), the axis mundi, whose cyclical theophany on the plain of history enacts, or
rather re-enacts events of cosmological and cosmogonic order, for which he, as the
epiphany of the Primal Will, is the motive force in the processio-perpetual creation of the
world. However, it should be noted that the Bab as well as Baha’u’llah radically reverse
this Hermetic dictum, so that it is properly ‘as below, so above,’ first rather than ‘as
above, so below.’ This is based on the insight that all that can be known
epistemologically of the spiritual and heavenly worlds is primarily gained through the
historical advent and lives of the Manifestations of God and not vice versa. This will be
born out more clearly in the Bab’s hermeneutics of ‘alam adh-dharr in the Persian Bayan
(see below).

\[55\] The Bāb, cited in Lawson, ‘Fatima’s’ 107.

\[56\] The principle of tashrī‘ (revelation) and takwin (creation) is often mentioned in the
Babi-Baha’i scriptures. Another word often used interchangeably with tashrī‘ is tadwīn
(i.e. tadwin and takwin). This doctrine is mentioned as one of the principle beliefs of the
Shaykiyya and by extension that of the Shi‘a, by Sayyid Kazim Rashti in Us@ūl al
‘Aqā’id; see Nusratu’llah Muhammad-Hussaini, Had@rat-i Bab (Dundas, Ont.: Institute
for Bahā’ī Studies in Persian, 1995) 122. For the alchemical and cosmogonic background
of takwin in the works of Jabir Ibn Hayyan and early Islamic alchemy, see Kathleen
Malone O’Connor, ‘The alchemical creation of life (takwin) and other concepts of
Genesis in medieval Islam’, PhD thesis, University of Pennsylvania, 1994.

The Bab in the Sah@īfih-yi ‘Adliyyih, or the Book of Justice, before mentioning
the same quaternary of the covenant, discusses the subject of free will (tafwīd@) and
predestination/compulsion (jabr) and like Shaykh Ahmad, affirms that God’s Will brings
forth creation via the seven stages of creation (maratib sab‘ih). He affirms that this
quality of will is inherent in all things, that is to say that each thing (shay’) is an event of
the Will, and is existentiated according to its own volition. The Bab states:

> Verily, He [God] is cognizant of the choices of all things and creates all in
> accordance to their choices and rewards them according to their act of choosing
> and if He should create them not according to the degree of their
> receptivity/capacity, verily He has committed an injustice towards them.57 For, He
> hath created all for the sake of His love, and the love of His friends (awliya).
> Therefore, the decree of fate (qad@ā’) hath been established through His
> execution (imd@ā), so that all may receive their share. In the four mashhads
> (places of testimony) of Command (amr), He hath created all through His Will
> (irādah) and covenanted with them, so that there should not remain any excuse
> for a single person. In the first dharr [particle], He hath covenanted with all things
> regarding His [God] own Divinity, in the second dharr, He hath covenanted with
> all things regarding the prophethood of the messenger – upon him and his family
> be the peace of God – and in the third [dharr], He hath made firm the covenant
> regarding the guardianship (wilāyat) of the Family of God (āl Allāh) and in the
> fourth, he hath covenanted regarding the love of the people of wilayat [the
> Shi‘ah], and He hath created all things through the Will, and [created] the Will
> through its own self.58

The last section of this passage evokes the same Tradition of mashiyyat (Will) of Imam
Ja‘far al-Sādiq mentioned earlier. The Bab like Shaykh Ahmad then is reiterating that
every ‘thing’ (shay’) is created by the Primal Will according to its choice and that no
‘thing’ exists without its possibility to come to exist. Hence its existence itself is the sign
of its choice; otherwise it would never have existed, as that would be against the justice
of God to create it without its own volition. The statement that ‘he hath created all for the
sake of his love and the love of his friends (awliya),’ is crucial here as it subtly alludes to
the fact that one cannot be compelled to love, and that it must be freely given of one’s
own accord. The purpose of creation is hence to love God and His chosen friends, namely
the prophet and his successors, through our own free will. It is interesting to note that the
stage of Fate/Decree (qad@ā’), which is the fourth stage of the arc of descent, is
mentioned here in light of the dialectic of free will and necessity. Thus it may be said that

\[57\] Keven Brown’s provisional translation of the beginning of the above passage reads:
‘He [God] knows the dispositions of all things, and through the dispositions of all, He
creates all, giving each one a portion according to its disposition . . . Were He to create
something other than in accord with the state of its own receptivity, this would be an
injustice to it.’ Mazandarani, Amr va Khalq, repr. 4 vols. in 2, Hofheim-Langenhain:

\[58\] Provisional translation from the Bāb’s, Sahifih-yi ‘Adliyyih (Tehran: n.p., n.d.) 21.
this revelation of the covenant of God on the plane of history is decreed/fated but how we
respond to it is our choice.

In another place the Bab in his discussions of the seven stages of creation,
mentions the stage of Fate/Decree in the conceptual framework of the Qur’anic
primordial covenant. Just as in the works of Shaykh Ahmad, the stage of Fate is
correlated to the primordial covenant where they who exclaim ‘yea, verily’ are
existentiated according to their freedom to respond.59 In yet another place the Bab in his
discussion of the stage of Fate/Decree corresponds to it the colour Crimson: ‘That which
I set forth in explanation of the letter Hā was to extol the Tree of Bahā, for the supporters
of Fate (qada’) recognize the decree of spontaneity (badā’) in the Crimson Pillar.’60 Here
then the Bab correlates the fourth mystic colour that is crimson with the fourth stage of
the arc of descent, namely Fate/Decree. In another instance the Bab, in the Qayyūm al-
Asmā’, mentions crimson in relation to his station as the alchemical elixir: ‘Indeed God
hath created everywhere around this Gate (bāb) oceans of divine elixir (iksir), tinged
crimson (ahmar) with the essence of existence and vitalized through the animating power
of the desired fruit; and for them God hath provided Arks of ruby, tender, crimson-
coloured, wherein none shall sail but the people of Bahā.’61 Here we see that the elixir of
the resurrection body in the works of Shaykh Ahmad is identified as the Bab. As we have
said earlier such juxtapostioning in the writings of the Bab illustrates the unity and
correspondence of all the worlds, and demonstrates the dictum of ‘as above, so below’
which imbues all his writings.

Here we must note that the Bab only progressively made a self-disclosure of the
fullness of his station according to the dictum ‘speak to the people according to their
capacity.’ His station as the Manifestation of God, or the Primal Will, became more
clearly pronounced in his later writings and in the Persian Bayan he explicitly links the
last stage or the fourth dharr in which he appeared in the station of the bab, to the first
stage or the first dharr which is that of the Primal Will. The Bab states:

> . . . For at that time he manifested himself according to the fourth dharr and called
> himself as the appearance of one of the Gates (abwab). Thus it is for that reason
> that the first dharr is manifest in the fourth dharr, for it was in that dharr [fourth
> dharr] that he spoke the words, ‘Verily, I am God; there is none other God but
> me.’ Should there be a possessor of understanding in the world, he would set out
> wayfaring and attain certitude in that the Last is the same as the First, and the
> Manifest as the Hidden . . .62

\[62\] Provisional translation of the Bāb, Persian Bayan, 18:8. The Bāb writes about the
gradual self-disclosure of his station in the Dala’il-i Sab‘ih (The Seven Proofs); see
Selections 119.

Here we see that the unity and the correspondence of the various stages are invested in
the very being of the Bab, in whom the first is the same as the last and the hidden as the
manifest. Thus the dictum of ‘as above so below, as below so above,’ is manifested in the
very person of the Bab himself who in his station as the Primal Will encompasses all of
the stages.

The Bab in his later writings clearly identifies the eighteen Letters of the Living
(H@urūf-i H@ayy) with the ‘precursors’ or sābiqūn, namely the Imams, as they who
preceded before others in their recognition of the Bab, as well as in more initiatory terms
as they who responded to God’s Primordial Covenant in ‘alam adh-dharr. Just as in the
Shi‘i Traditions it was Muhammad and the Imams who preceded all in creation in the
world of particles, so in the Bab’s dispensation they return (raj‘a) and are the first to
recognize him who is the Qa’im.63 In this connection it is important to mention a tradition
ascribed to the sixth Imam Ja‘far al-Sādiq wherein he states, ‘When the Qa’im rises, the
people will reject him because he will return as a youth in his best years (shābban
muwaffaqan). No one will remain believing in him except those with whom God made a
covenant in [the world of] the first particles (fī adh-dharr al-awwal).’64 This Tradition is
extremely interesting in light of the fact that the common Shi‘i interpretation of the
appearance of the Qa’im assumes that he will be universally recognized. But, according
to this Tradition only those who in pre-existence, in the world of the first particles, had
made a pact/covenant to accept the Qa’im will bear allegiance to him in his parousia
(z@uhūr) at the end of the age (zamān), and the rest of the people will reject him for
being a youth. We must recall that the Shi‘ah believe that the twelfth Imam disappeared
as a child, and therefore is now over a thousand years old. It is interesting to note that the
Bab, who claimed to be the awaited Qa’im, enounced his station in the prime of his youth
(shābban muwaffaqan) and it was the Letters of the Living, the first to believe in the Bab,
who were called the ‘precursors’ or sābiqūn, namely they who arose to assent to his
recognition before all created things.

In this connection the Bab in the Persian Bayan makes explicit the interpretation
regarding ‘alam adh-dharr, and in a radical turn situates it in this world in relation to the
appearance of the Manifestation of God: ‘The first to respond’ to the primordial question
‘Am I not your Lord?’ was ‘Muhammad, who was the first to be created. So all in this
day confess that, if they say that the response took place in the world of pre-existence
(alam adh-dharr), this is that same world, for the realm above the throne (al-‘arsh) of

that it was precisely this same Divine Throne which in early Shi‘i cosmology and
cosmogony was created in the first world of the particles/shadows/pact, and which was
interpreted in the lexicon of the Imams as ‘Religion’ (din).65 The Bab here then returns
the meaning to its origin, to the hermeneutic of the Imams, which is precisely the
meaning of Ta’wil (to bring back to its origin), and states that any other understanding of
the Throne or ‘alam adh-dharr is nothing but fanciful imagination. Indeed the Bab states
that nothing of that world, namely the pre-existential world, can be known, unless it has
its correspondence first here in the life of the Manifestation, in whose revelation
archetypal cosmogonic events are realized and become knowable. Finally in this passage
the Bab then refers to the words of the Tradition relating to the visitation of the shrine of
Imam Husayn: ‘whoso visits Husayn with a full understanding, it is as if he has visited
God upon his throne’ and states that ‘It is manifest to the possessors of intelligence that
that is the very locus of the throne of God, and that he is the throne of Muhammad, the
messenger of God.’66

‘Alam adh-dharr and the Primordial Covenant in the Baha’i Writings

Along with the sacred texts of the Bab, it is in the writings of Baha’u’llah (d. 1892), the
prophet-founder of the Baha’i revelation, and ‘Abdu’l-Baha (d. 1921) his eldest son who
is at once the successor and interpreter of that revelation, that ‘alam adh-dharr finds its
clearest exegesis. Though elements of its Shi‘i-Shaykhi heritage are present, yet it
provides a new and novel element of understanding the coordinates of this mysterious
region of ‘the realm of subtle entities’ and may be seen both as a divine ta’wil or
hermeneutic of those traditions of the Imams which relate to this world and the dialectic
of the primordial covenant. Therefore, the mytho-history of the drama of the Qur’anic
covenant (Q 7:172) is radically re-interpreted in the Baha’i scriptures both in the light of
the Greater Covenant (i.e. the covenant made by the Manifestation regarding the
acceptance of the next Manifestation) as well as the Lesser Covenant (i.e. the covenant
made by the Manifestation regarding his successor). Indeed the same conceptual
framework of the covenantal quaternary and its structural unity that was present in the
early writings of the Bab is also present in the Baha’i Revelation. As will become clear,
in the Baha’i Writings the whole pre-existential drama of the primordial covenant
becomes historicized in the life of the Manifestation and finds its true meaning in relation
to his revelation. ‘Alam adh-dharr then denotes the undifferentiated station of mankind
before the revelation of the Manifestation of God on the plane of history. It is the moment
in which human beings freely chose their realities and essences in accordance with their
response to the divine call. It is here that the antinomy of free will versus predestination
is resolved and the problematic of the pre-existence of souls finds its solution. Thus

\[65\] See the tradition of Iman al-Baqir reported by his son Ja‘far: ‘the Throne [al-‘arsh] is
the Religion of Truth’ (Amir-Moezzi, Divine Guide 31).

\[66\] The Persian Bayan of Sayyid Ali Muhammad Shirazi, the Bab, 2.8, tr. Dennis
MacEoin: [H-Baha’i] Translations of Shaykhi, Babi, and Bahai Texts (July, 1997). Part
of this passage has been translated in Selections 112-113.

‘alam adh-dharr is the spiritual topography of the divine-human encounter and represents
the mystical and atemporal realm of the covenant.

Throughout the writings of Baha’u’llah and ‘Abdu’l-Baha the theme of the
Covenant (‘ahd/mithaq), both Greater and Lesser, have an unparalleled and
unprecedented importance. Indeed all of the teachings of the Baha’i Faith circle around
‘the pivot of the Oneness of mankind’ which is unrealizable in the temporal world, save
through ‘the power of the Covenant’, namely that of the Lesser Covenant.67 The Baha’i
Revelation is then the quintessential religion of the covenant. This covenant may be seen
in initiatory and esoteric terms as the fulfillment of that covenant which remained
tragically unfulfilled in Islam, indeed in the whole of the Adamic Cycle, and at last was
fulfilled in the Baha’i Dispensation by the reality of the Lesser Covenant in the form of a
tablet penned by its author, wherewith the solidarity and oneness of the whole of
existence is said to be realizable at long last. In this precise sense, the Baha’i revelation
even more than Shi‘ism may be termed the religion of Walayah par excellence.

Though there have been some general references to ‘alam-i dharr in secondary
Baha’i literature,68 a full study of its scope and significance in the Baha’i writings have
remained hitherto unexplored; this despite the fact that this term has profound
implications for a deeper understanding of the esoteric mysteries of the covenant in the
Baha’i Revelation. Two exceptions, however, are Fazil Mazandarani and ‘Abdu’l-Hamid
Ishraq-Khavari, who have made passing references to ‘alam-i dharr in their respective
encyclopedias.

In his Encyclopedia Asrar al-athar, Fazil Mazandarani has an entry on ‘alam-i
dharr (the realm of subtle entities) and dharr-i ‘amā (the particles of the Unknowable
Cloud). Regarding dharr-i ‘ama, he states that it is ‘a term of esoteric philosophy and
gnosis which has also been mentioned in this Cause,’ then he cites a passage from the
writings of Baha’u’llah referring to dharr-i ‘ama: ‘These sovereigns of existence
(sult@ān-i-wujūd) in the particles of the unknowable cloud (dharr-i ‘ama) and in the
world of spirits (awālim-i arwāh@) accepted all calamities in the Path of God - with
supreme fortitude and forbearance . . .’69

The term dharr in dharr-i ‘ama is more a reference to ‘ama or the Unknowable
Cloud, which is the station of the primordial Manifestation of God, as the Primal Will, or
Word of God. The conjunction of dharr with ‘ama, typifies or signifies the spiritual
ground, station or dimension of ‘ama, that is to say the station of the unknowability of the
Manifestation.70 Regarding ‘alam-i dharr or realm of subtle entities, however,

Hussaini also mentions dharr in regard to his discussions of the Bab’s Writings;
Had@rat-i Bāb 735-736.

\[69\] Provisional translation from Ishraq-Khavari, Ma’idih 4:42

\[70\] See Stephen Lambden’s study of the concept of ‘ama in the Babi-Baha’i scriptures,
‘An Early Poem of Mirza Husayn ‘Ali Baha’u’llah: The Sprinkling of the Cloud of
Unknowing (Rashh-i ‘ama),’ Baha’i Studies Bulletin 3.2 (1984) 4-114.

Mazandarani states that ‘the world of particles/realm of subtle entities is as it has been
referred to in the Qura’n (Q 7:171-2)…’ and continues in this vein,

> it is the same realm in which the whole of humanity before this earth/world bore
> witness to the oneness of the essence of God, and in Islamic sources they have
> written that humanity before this existence in that world of witnessing were
> addressed by the words ‘Am I not your Lord?’ Some said, ‘Yes’, but became
> unbelievers and others said, ‘Yes’ and were accounted as faithful, and each one
> received their share and due in this world according to that world.71

Here Mazandarani affirms that ‘alam-i dharr pertains to the transcendent scene of the
primordial covenant in the Qur’an and briefly mentions the Islamic interpretation of this
world. Then he cites an important passage by Abdu’l-Baha in which the interpretation
and meaning of ‘alam-i dharr is provided. Mazandarani does not explicate the
interpretation provided by Abdu’l-Baha any further, nor does he seem to give a clear
indication of the overall meaning of ‘alam-i dharr in the Baha’i writings. We shall have
occasion to discuss Abdu’l-Baha’s interpretation of this term below.

‘Abdu’l-Hamid Ishraq-Khavari on the other hand in his Baha’i Encyclopedia
Dā’irat al-Ma‘ārif-i Bahā’ī has two entries on a cognate of ‘alam-i dharr in the Baha’i
writings, namely dharr al-baqā or the timeless realm of eternal particles. The first entry
is as follows: ‘The knowledge of God wherein the essences and realities of things existed
in that realm [dharr-al-baqa] in conceptual (‘ilmī) form before outward existence and
were brought forth through the address of God; and God said unto them, “Am I not your
Lord?” which has been revealed in the Quran [Q 7:171-2].’72

Ishraq-Khavari again properly situates dharr al-baqa in relation to the primordial
covenant in the Qur’an. He provides no textual evidence from the Baha’i writings
however for his interpretation, though it seems to be derived from the exegesis of
Baha’u’llah and ‘Abdu’l-Baha regarding ‘alam-i dharr and other similar passages which
mention darr al-baqa. Before we turn to the most explicit interpretations of ‘alam-i dharr
by Baha’u’llah and ‘Abdu’l-Baha, let us first look at some examples of how dharr al-
baqa is often used in the Baha’i writings. In one instance, it alludes to the pre-existent
station of Baha’u’llah in which his destiny to suffer as the Manifestation of God was
foreordained.

> Hast Thou forgotten the Covenant that thou made with God before the creation of
> the universe—at the beginning of time (dharr-al-baqā)—to die a martyr’s death
> in His path? Verily, this matter hath been foreordained in the Mother Book (umm
> al-kitāb).73

Ghaemmaghami.

It is noteworthy to recall here the reference to the Mother Book (umm al-kitab) in the
above passage, which as we saw in primitive Shi‘ism was the first metaphysical world in
which the light of Muhammad existed. It was also in ‘alam adh-dharr al-awwal, which
here corresponds to dharr-i baqā, that the covenant with God was first made. In another
place in the Surah of the Temple, Baha’u’llah refers to the covenant, which was taken
with all created beings in dharr al-baqa in this manner:

> O Living Temple! Through Thee have We gathered together all created things,
> whether in the heavens or on the earth, and called them to account for that which
> We had covenanted with them before the foundation of the world [dharr al-baqa].
> And lo, but for a few radiant faces and eloquent tongues, We found most of the
> people dumbfounded, their eyes staring up in fear. From the former We brought
> forth the creation of all that hath been and all that shall be. These are they whose
> countenances God hath graciously turned away from the face of the unbelievers,
> and whom He hath sheltered beneath the shadow of the Tree of His own Being;
> they upon whose hearts He hath bestowed the gift of peace and tranquillity, and
> whom He hath strengthened and assisted through the hosts of the seen and the
> unseen.74

Here we are already approaching the hermeneutics of dharr al-baqa, which is co-
extensive with ‘alam adh-dharr or the realm of subtle entities. In this passage the reality
of the Primal Will as the pre-existential reality of the Manifestation of God addresses his
earthly Temple, that is Baha’u’llah, that he has covenanted with all created beings before
the foundation of the world (dharr al-baqa), regarding his Manifestation, and lo when the
hour of his appearance struck, most of mankind turned away from him, save ‘a few
radiant faces and eloquent tongues’. In a profound turn Baha’u’llah then states that it is
from them that he has ‘brought forth the creation of all that hath been and all that shall
be.’ This would be first and foremost his son ‘Abdu’l-Baha, the centre of his Covenant,
and his daughter the Greatest Holy Leaf, and his great grandson Shoghi Effendi (d.
1957), the Guardian (walī) of the Cause of God, namely the Holy family; and second, his
most faithful followers, or the faithful of love. Therefore the mystical earth from which
‘the creation of all that hath been and all that shall be’, is first and foremost the earth of
the Holy Family which is precisely the reality of walayah and that of the Lesser
Covenant, from whom the earth of the faithful is first kneaded.75

In another instance Baha’u’llah is addressed as Him who is the bearer of the pre-
existential bounties and favours of God in these words: ‘O Solace of the Spirit! Speak to
the people of the bounties that We bestowed upon thee before the foundation of the world
(dharr al-baqa), before the bodies of all things were adorned with the garment of names,

when the eternal Adam (adam al-baqa) lay concealed within the clay of the Divine
Decree (t@īnat al-qad@ā).’76

It is important to highlight in the above passage that the eternal Adam, which
represents humanity is here referred to as concealed within the clay of Divine Decree.77
This as we have seen was the fourth stage in the seven stages of creation (maratib sab‘ih)
which both in the works of Shaykh Ahmad and the Bab is invariably related to ‘alam
adh-dharr. Similarly it is related to the world of nature (‘alam al-nasut) and the mystical
colour and photism corresponding to this stage is red or crimson (ahmar). In one instance
‘Abdu’l-Baha in his explication of a term which we encountered earlier in our section on
Shi‘ism, called al-kathib al-hamra (the crimson hill),78 explicitly mentions the subtle
mystic colours of light accorded to each of the first four stages of the arc of descent and
at once illuminates the spiritual significance of that term:

> By the crimson land (ard@-i h@amrā) and the crimson hill (kathīb-i ah@mar)
> the station of Fate/Decree is intended, for in the terminology of the people of God,
> white indicates the station of the Will, while green signifies the station of
> Predestination. Crimson (ahmar) indicates the station of Fate/Decree and yellow
> the station of Completion (imd@ā’). Thus it is that the crimson land signifies the
> station of the most great martyrdom [testimony].79

Similarly in yet another instance ‘Abdu’l-Baha in referring to these mystic colours states,

> This is the terminology of the late Shaykh [Shaykh Ahmad]. White is the station
> of the Will, for it transforms into whatsoever colour thou dost desire. The colour
> red/crimson is the station of Decree/Fate, yellow that of Purpose, and green that
> of Predestination. By the snow-white Spot the station of Will is intended . . . The
> Primal Point [the Bab] in the Best of Stories (ah@san al-qis@as@, i.e. Qayyūm
> al-Asmā) hath said: ‘By the righteousness of the One true God, I am the Maid of
> Heaven begotten by the Spirit of Bahā, abiding within the Mansion hewn out of a
> mass of ruby, tender and vibrant…’ The station of crimson (ar-rutbat al-
> h@amrā)”… This is the station of Fate/Decree.80

Thus as we have seen, dharr al-baqa is related to the station of qada which is the fourth
stage of the arc of descent and in the Babi-Baha’i lexicon is situated in relation to the
world of nasut and the colour corresponding to it is red or crimson.81 All of this as we
have seen has its spiritual genealogy in the works of Shaykh Ahmad and the writings of
the Bab.

It is interesting to note here that the Hebrew origin for the word Adam which is
adamah means red or crimson earth, this may be typologically related to the mystical
locale known as al-kathib al-hamra or the Crimson Sandhill, which ‘Abdu’l-Baha has
related to the stage of Fate/Decree (qada) which is precisely related to dharr al-baqa or
‘alam adh-dharr. Therefore the Genesis drama of the creation of Adam is correlated in
this manner to the Qur’anic primordial covenant whereby the red dust-earth from which
Adam82 was created is the mystical locale of dharr or the realm of the covenant (mithaq),
and in its highest signification designates ‘the station of the most great martyrdom
[testimony]’ which may be the cry of ‘yea verily, we bear witness’ (balā shahadnā, Q
7:172) freely uttered by the faithful in response to the divine call even unto death. This is
the only true existence perceived from the divine point of view and hence the red clay
dyed crimson by the blood of lovers is the earth of the faithful of love kneaded from the
covenant (for further Genesis symbolism in the Baha’i writings in relation to our theme,
see below).

Similarly in another passage in the Sūrat al-Bayān, Baha’u’llah precisely turns
this notion of sacrifice around, in that the primordial covenant that was drawn in dharr
al-baqa is not only to sacrifice oneself for the Beloved but also to offer up one’s life for
those who have the fragrance of the love of the Beloved. Baha’u’llah addressing the Maid
of Heaven states: ‘If Thou smellest from any one the smell of the love of Thy Lord, offer
up Thyself for him, for We have created Thee to this end, and have covenanted with
Thee, from time immemorial (dharr al-baqa), and in the presence of the congregation of
Our well-favored ones, for this very purpose.’ Here then the very purpose of existence is
to sacrifice one’s life not only for the Beloved, but for the lovers of the Beloved.83

Before we turn to the Lesser Covenant let us look at an example of the use of the
term dharr typifying the motif of the Greater Covenant, in which each Manifestation has

missing. Also, the word al-rutbat al-hamra (the station of Crimson) which appears in
Muhadirat does not seem to be part of the text of the Qayyūm al-Asmā’.

\[81\] Baha’u’llah in Lawh-i Kullu’t@-T@a‘ām (the Tablet of all Food), allocates the colour
white to the metaphysical world of Lahut, yellow to Jabarut, green to Malakut, and red to
Nasut (the physical world). See provisional translation by Stephen Lambden,

\[82\] Here it is worth mentioning that one of the symbolic and spiritual dimensions inherent
in the Genesis tale of Adam and Eve is precisely the freedom to choose and to will, which
in the story is exercised contrary to the Divine admonition.

made a solemn oath/covenant regarding the appearance of Baha’u’llah, as the promised
one of all religions.

> Say: Beware lest ye become veiled by evil suggestions from Him who is the
> Possessor of all Names and Attributes. This is he [Baha’u’llah] whose
> Manifestation the Bab hath covenanted (‘ahd) in every particle (dharr) of the
> Bayan, whose coming Muhammad, the Messenger of God, hath promised in every
> particle of the Qur’an, whose advent the Spirit (Jesus) had promised in every

> had promised in every particle of the Torah, and whose revelation the Friend
> (Abraham) had promised in every particle of God’s Decree (amr) — if ye be of
> them that comprehend.84

In the above passage Baha’u’llah in a profound hermeneutical turn makes the Holy
Books of each of the Manifestations to be the very world of particles (dharr) in which the
covenant was drawn between the prophet and his ardent lovers regarding their acceptance
of Baha’u’llah at the time of his promised manifestation (z@uhūr). The covenant then in
these Holy Books is the realm of subtle entities (‘alam adh-dharr) in which the
primordial covenant was drawn. It is here that paradoxically ‘alam adh-dharr is at once
related to both time and timelessness, for the event of the revelation of these Books
occurs in the world of time, but in respect to the covenant or origin of revelation, it is
outside time. ‘Abdu’l-Baha in his interpretation of one of the Persian Hidden Words (no.
71) of Baha’u’llah mentions this phenomenon and in a radical turn as well resolves the
problematic of the pre-existence of souls as related to ‘alam-i dharr.

> As for the reference in the Hidden Words regarding the Covenant entered into on
> Mount Paran, this signifieth that in the sight of God the past, the present and the
> future are all one and the same whereas, relative to man, the past is gone and
> forgotten, the present is fleeting, and the future is within the realm of hope. And it
> is a basic principle of the Law of God that in every Prophetic Mission, He
> entereth into a Covenant with all believers – a Covenant that endureth until the
> end of that Mission, until the promised day when the Personage stipulated at the
> outset of the Mission is made manifest. Consider Moses, He Who conversed with
> God. Verily, upon Mount Sinai, Moses entered into a Covenant regarding the
> Messiah, with all those souls who would live in the day of the Messiah. And those
> souls, although they appeared many centuries after Moses, were nevertheless —
> so far as the Covenant, which is outside time, was concerned — present there with
> Moses.85

Therefore this covenant, ‘which is outside time’, is precisely with those souls who are to
exist in the future, but in relation to the covenant they are present – in potentia – pre-
existentially in the realm of the covenant, which is the world of particles. Here we are
already approaching the radical Baha’i hermeneutics of the Shi‘i Tradition, which spoke

Publishing Trust, 1982) 207.

of the pre-existence of the Shi‘ite faithful a thousand years prior to their actual existence.

As we shall see this ontological priority rather than temporal priority will become clearer
in Baha’u’llah’s hermeneutic of ‘alam-i dharr in which the whole pre-existential drama
of the primordial covenant (Q 7:172) is interpreted in relation to the theophanic
appearance of the Manifestation of God on the horizon of history. This is clearly
expressed in relation to Baha’u’llah in a letter addressed to an individual Baha’i by
‘Abdu’l-Baha:

> O thou speaker of the word "yea verily" (bala - Q2:171-2)! In this Day of the
> Divine Presence (yawm-i liqā), a hundred thousand souls have contemplated for
> years the mysteries of Alast (sir-i alast), and the days of the dharr of existence
> (wujūd), and the reality of the Intended One (h@aqīqat-i maqsūd) and who

> But thou didst respond to the [Divine] Call and cried out "yea verily" and entered
> neath the shadow of the word of Divine Unity and drank from the flowing waters
> of Tasnim (Qur’an 83:27), and tasted from the cup tempered at the Camphor
> Fountain (Qur’an 6:5-6).86

We must now make mention of a Tablet of Abdu’l-Baha in which he provides a
hermeneutic of bismi llāh ar-rah@mān ar-rah@īm (In the name of God, the
Compassionate, the Merciful) which adorns the beginning of every surah of the Qur’an
save the ninth surah Tawbah. (‘Abdu’l-Baha states that even this surah starts with the
letter bā, with the words bara’itu.) While discussing the significance of the first letter of
bism that is ‘bā’ and its significance as the Primal Will, namely Baha’u’llah, he mentions
as a sign that the creation of all things have originated with this letter (which is the first
letter of the name Baha’u’llah) and that all other sacred scriptures, such as the Torah and
the Gospels, also start with this letter. For, indeed it is precisely with this letter that the
Hebrew scriptures start, for the book of Genesis begins with the Hebrew letter ‘ba’ or bet,
that is with the word bereshit (in the beginning), and the New Testament which begins
with the Gospel of Matthew also begins with the Greek letter beta, that is with the words
‘byblos’ (book). Then ‘Abdu’l-Baha in another linguistic turn states that this letter, which
at the primordial scene of the covenant in dharr al-baqa when creation first uttered the
word ‘yes’ (bala which starts with the letter ‘ba’), is thus precisely the cause of the
coming into being of all things: ‘… [and it was] The first letter [ba] that came out of the
tongue of all beings and filled up their mouth in the beginning of the creation, when God
addressed His creation [in the world of eternal particles] before the foundation of the
world (dharr al-baqa) and said: “Am I not your Lord?” and they said: “Yes” (bala).’87

llah’ 188-198.

Now let us turn to the Lesser Covenant, which is regarding the successorship of
‘Abdu’l-Baha and that of the Guardian of the Cause of God (walī amru llāh) Shoghi
Effendi and Universal House of Justice after Baha’u’llah. Shoghi Effendi, while
discussing the significance of the Lesser Covenant, quotes from several of the writings of
‘Abdu’l-Baha. In one instance ‘Abdu’l-Baha is cited as stating: ‘The Covenant which
God hath made in the realm of the eternal particles (dharr al-baqa), was for the sake of
the Centre of the Covenant (markaz-i mīthāq, i.e. ‘Abdu’l-Baha).’88 Then Shoghi Effendi
immediately cites another passage from the writings of ‘Abdu’l-Baha wherein a further
hermeneutical element is added:

> This is the Covenant which God made in the realm of eternal particles (dharr al-
> baqa) neath the shade of the Tree of Anisa on the Day of His Revelation. It then
> appeared in the realm of creation in the form of a Tablet graven by the Pen of the
> Most High. Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious.89

It is instructive to recall here that the covenant of the walayah of ‘Ali which was drawn in
‘alam adh-dharr al-awwal or the first world of the particles, in early Shi‘i cosmology and
cosmogony, is repeated here in regard to ‘Abdu’l-Baha precisely in dharr al-baqa. Here
‘Abdu’l-Baha mentions the covenant that was drawn in dharr al-baqa by Baha’u’llah and
in a profound hermeneutical turn states that this covenant appeared in the world of
creation in the form of a Tablet. This Tablet is the Book of the Covenant (Kitāb-i ‘ahdī)
which is the last will and testament of Baha’u’llah in which he appoints ‘Abdu’l-Baha as
his successor and centre of the covenant. Therefore dharr al-baqa is here the spiritual
earth of the book of the covenant. Here Genesis symbolism such as the Tree of Anisa
which is coterminous with the Tree of Life is used in the hermeneutics of the Lesser
Covenant via the realm of eternal particles (dharr al-baqa). Indeed, the Book of the
Covenant is often referred to in Baha’u’llah’s mystical lexicon as the Crimson Book, as
Shoghi Effendi has stated: ‘The Crimson Book refers to the Book of His Covenant.’90
Here again we must recall that the symbolism of the colour crimson or red is precisely
related to dharr al-baqa and corresponds to the stage of Fate/Decree (qada) in the arc of
descent and to alam al-nasut in the hierarchy of worlds. Thus it is that crimson is the
colour of the earth of Adam, or adamah. It is from this mystical crimson-coloured earth
associated with the Book of the Covenant, which is related to dharr al-baqa that ‘the

creation of all that hath been and all that shall be’ is brought forth. In this precise sense
the power of the covenant is the cause of the new creation.

Baha’u’llah’s Persian Hidden Word no. 19 reads:

> O My Friends! Have ye forgotten that true and radiant morn, when in those
> hallowed and blessed surroundings ye were all gathered in My presence beneath
> the shade of the tree of life, which is planted in the all-glorious paradise? Awe-
> struck ye listened as I gave utterance to these three most holy words: O friends!

> cravings. Would ye but sanctify your souls, ye would at this present hour recall
> that place and those surroundings, and the truth of my utterance should be made
> evident unto all of you.91

‘Abdu’l-Baha has given a number of interesting different exegeses of this Hidden Word:
- ‘By the “Tree of Anīsā” is meant the Tabernacle of the Lord of Grace, the divine

> Lote-Tree, the Tree of Life, “the Olive that belongeth neither to the East nor to the
> West, whose oil would well nigh shine out even though fire touched it not” [Qur’ān
> 24:35].’92
- ‘O leaf upon the Tree of Life! The Tree of Life, of which mention is made in the

> Bible, is Bahā’u’llāh, and the daughters of the Kingdom are the leaves upon that
> blessed Tree.’93
- ‘The “true and radiant morn” is the dawn of the Covenant, and the first light of the

> Testament of the Day-Star of the world. The “Tree of Anīsā” is the blessed tree
> which hath flourished in the Most Great Paradise and casteth its shadow upon all
> regions.’94
- ‘By the term "that true and radiant morn" mentioned in the Hidden Words is meant

> the Dawn of divine Revelation when the Exalted One (i.e. the Bab) manifested
> Himself in the plenitude of His glory, while the Blessed Tree referreth to the Ancient
> Beauty (Baha’u’llah). By those "surroundings" is meant the realm of the heart and of
> the spirit, and the gathering of the people implieth a spiritual communion, not a
> physical one. However when the Call of God was raised in the realm of the heart and
> spirit, mankind remained heedless and inattentive, and therefore was
> dumbfounded.’95

\[91\] It is interesting to note here that Baha’u’llah evokes the imagery of anamnesis in
relation to ‘those hallowed and blessed surroundings,’ using Platonic tropes of
forgetfulness and recollection which as we mentioned earlier were utilized in Sufism as
well as Shaykhism.

-    ‘This is the Covenant and Testament which the Blessed Beauty established through

> the Supreme Pen in the Holy Land under the shade of the Tree of Anīsā and which
> was promulgated after the Ascension.’96 This is the Lesser Covenant.

We must recall here that it was upon the land of the Crimson Sandhill which according to
Muslim tradition was located in the Holy Land that the drama of the People of the Cloak
was said to have taken place (see above). Baha’u’llah in the Sūrih-yi Mulūk while in
prison and in exile in the holy land on the plain of ‘Akka utters these words:

> O kings of the earth! Give ear unto the Voice of God, calling from this sublime,
> this fruit-laden Tree, that hath sprung out of the Crimson Hill [kathib al-hamra],
> upon the holy Plain, intoning the words: ‘There is none other God but He, the
> Mighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Wise.’ This is a Spot which hath been
> sanctified by God for those who approach it, a Spot wherein His Voice may be
> heard from the celestial Tree of Holiness.97

Here the visionary topography of the Crimson Hill paradoxically becomes prophetically
historicized by the exile of Baha’u’llah to the Holy Land and his declaration there to the
whole world. It was here in ‘Akka as well that the Book of the Covenant or the Crimson
Book was written by Baha’u’llah, designating ‘Abdu’l-Baha as the centre of his
covenant.98

The Lesser Covenant, which as we have seen was drawn in the topography of
dharr al-baqa, is further extended to the line of succession after ‘Abdu’l-Baha by Shoghi
Effendi and the Administration, namely both the Guardianship and Universal House of
Justice. Shoghi Effendi states regarding the Lesser Covenant:

> The second form of covenant is such as the one Baha’u’llah made with His people
> that they should accept the Master [‘Abdu’l-Baha]. This is merely to establish and
> strengthen the succession of the series of Lights that appear after every
> Manifestation. Under the same category falls the covenant of the Master made
> with the Baha’is that they should accept the administration after Him…99

Thus according to Shoghi Effendi the Administration (i.e. the twin institutions of the
Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice) is deemed to be in the same category as
the Lesser Covenant, thereby squarely situating the whole drama in the conceptual
framework of ‘alam-i dharr or dharr al-baqa. Here it is important to state that the
quaternary of the covenant (‘ahd/mithaq), in which one cannot be divorced from another,
becomes as well the foundation of the dialectic of the covenant in the Baha’i revelation
echoing its Shaykhi-Babi form; where the recognition of God, His Manifestation

(Baha’u’llah) and the walayah of the centre of his covenant (Abdu’l-Baha), the
Guardianship of Shoghi Effendi (who is precisely called wali amrullah or Guardian of
the Cause of God) and the Universal House of Justice is upheld.

1\. God
2\. Baha’u’llah (Manifestation/Prophethood)
3\. Walayah of Abdu’l-Baha, Walayah of Shoghi Effendi (wali amrullah)
4\. Universal House of Justice

Thus, in this covenantal quaternary separating any one of the stages from the others is
tantamount to the negation of all of them. The recognition of one must therefore include
the recognition of all the stages and the rejection of one becomes the rejection of all four.
This is the mystic unity and essence of the covenant, which is precisely framed in the
mystical logic of ‘alam-i dharr. It is here again that the same gnosis of the Divine
through the love of walayah or the succession of lights after the prophet, is couched in
the framework of the quaternary of the covenant, which as we have seen was present in
primitive Shi‘ism, Shaykhism and finally the writings of the Bab.

Now let us turn to the most explicit interpretation of ‘alam-i dharr in the writings
of Baha’u’llah and ‘Abdu’l-Baha. In one brief passage in response to a query made of the
meaning of ‘alam-i dharr, Abdu’l-Baha states:

> The realm of subtle entities (‘alam-i dharr) that is alluded to refereth to the
> realities, specifications, individuations, capacities and potentialities of man in the
> mirror of the divine knowledge (‘ilm-i ilahi). As these potentialities and capacities
> differ, they each have their own particular exigency (iqtid@ā). That exigency
> consisteth in acquiescence and supplication.100

This passage indicates that each created being has its conceptual existence in the
knowledge of God, which in the Baha’i lexicon refers to the station of the Primal Will
and not to the reality of the Divine Essence (dhāt ilāhī). It is from here therefore that
being individuates and attains concrete existence according to its potentialities and
capacities. Indeed it is interesting to note that the word iqtid@ā is from the same Arabic
root as qad@a (Fate/Decree), the fourth stage of the arc of descent and used here in
relation to the very freedom to existentiate according to each ‘thing’s’ potentiality and
capacity. This is an extremely succinct version of what we have seen in the works of
Shaykh Ahmad and that of the Bab in relation to the dialectic of free will versus
predestination which is worked out in relation to this realm (see above).

Here we must now turn to Baha’u’llah’s hermeneutics of ‘alam-i dharr, which
gives ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s interpretation a more concrete context. Baha’u’llah, in reference to
the query of pre-existence regarding a special section of humanity, categorically denies
such elitist metaphysical concepts and states that all were created through the Primal Will
of God which is the same as the Word of God (Kalimat Allah, Logos). He squarely
situates the realm of subtle entities (‘alam-i dharr) on the plain of history whereby the

\[100\] Ishraq-Khavari, Ma’idih 2:30; cited in Baha’u’llah, Tabernacle of Unity (Error! Main
Document Only.Bahā’ī World Centre, 2006) 80.

Qur’anic drama of the primordial covenant (Q 7:172) is interpreted by way of a divine
hermeneutics in the light of the historical appearance of the Manifestation of God (i.e.
himself). Baha’u’llah states that any other interpretation is only superstition and
imaginary. He further states that at the time of this revelation, before the Word of God is
delivered by the Manifestation, all men are considered equal and are one and the same in
their station and, that it is only thereafter that distinctions appear, due to the various
responses in relation to this call:

> As to the ‘realm of subtle entities’ (‘alam-i-dharr) which is often referred to, it
> pertaineth to the Revelation of the Prophets, and aught else is mere superstition
> and idle fancy. At the time of the Revelation all men are equal in rank. By reason,
> however, of their acceptance or rejection, rise or fall, motion or stillness,
> recognition or denial, they come to differ thereafter. For instance, the one true
> God, magnified be His glory, speaking through the intermediary of His
> Manifestation, doth ask: ‘Am I not your Lord?’ Every soul that answereth ‘Yea,
> verily!’ is accounted among the most distinguished of all men in the sight of God.
> Our meaning is that ere the Word of God is delivered, all men are deemed equal
> in rank and their station is one and the same. It is only thereafter that differences
> appear, as thou hast no doubt observed.101

In a similar instance Baha’u’llah in his discussion of cosmogony transforms the
cosmogonic moment into the moment of the advent of Divine revelation or the hour of
Divine theophany on the horizon of history. He states:

> Consider the hour at which the supreme Manifestation of God revealeth Himself
> unto men. Ere that hour cometh, the Ancient Being, Who is still unknown of men
> and hath not as yet given utterance to the Word of God, is Himself the All-
> Knower in a world devoid of any man that hath known Him. He is indeed the
> Creator without a creation. For at the very moment preceding His Revelation,
> each and every created thing shall be made to yield up its soul to God.102

All things are then brought forth through the revelation of His words: while this
revelation of the Divine Will and Purpose are conjoined by Predestination (qadar) in the
historical reality of the manifestation, he is still hidden, ‘the Creator without creation’;
but then once it is articulated, revealed, and manifested the stage of Fate/Decree (qada) is
actualized in which the ability to respond is available to humanity, it is precisely at this
stage that the dialectic of predestination versus free will, the divine call and the human
freedom to respond is realized and determined.103 This undifferentiated moment is then

the Tablet of Salman; see Majmū‘ih-yi Mat@bū‘ih (ed. Muhyi’d-Din Sabri Kurdi
Sanandaji Kanimishkani, Cairo: Mat@ba‘at as-Sa‘adah, 1920; reprinted, H-Bahai: East
Lansing, Mi., 2001) 147-148.

equivalent to the stage of qadar and to the realm of Malakut and to the colour green.104

But differentiation and differences appear in the second stage, which is that of the stage
of Fate/Decree and is related to the world of Nasut (nature) and the colour corresponding
to it is crimson/red. Put in the quaternal framework of the covenant, the stage of Will
(mashiyyat) corresponds to Baha’u’llah, Purpose (iradah) to that of Abdu’l-Baha,105
Shoghi Effendi (Guardian) to Predestination (qadar) and the stage of Fate/Decree (qada)
to the Universal House of Justice. Therefore it is the recognition and combination of all
these four stages that brings about the spiritual creation of the faithful.

The realm of subtle entities (‘alam-i dharr) then becomes the mystical and meta-
temporal topography of the covenant wherein the dialectic of predestination and free will,
and of divine questioning and the freedom to respond, combine to existentiate and realize
the essences of beings. This response to the divine call may change within the
individual’s life and their essence may be changed according to that response; therefore
in line with a metaphysic of process it demonstrates that the life of the soul is not static
but in a process of constant motion or flux and at any moment in this world the soul may
respond differently to the call of ‘am I not?’ and thereby existentiate itself accordingly in
a processual creation.

Thus as we have seen throughout the Babi-Baha’i scriptures that which is
described as taking place in primordial time is situated in historical time, in the epiphany
of the Manifestation of God, whereby both being and time are historicized. However, this
history is not the history and chronology of events as such, but a transformation of our
perception of history, it is a hierophany of history or rather a hierohistory which has at
the centre of its axis the revelation of the Manifestation to whose call ‘am I not your
Lord’ at the hour of the inauguration of this Revelation, all being existentiates,
individuates and differentiates in accordance to their response; they that exclaim ‘yea
verily’, from them that proclaim ‘nay verily’, including they who chose neutrality, all
from the force of their own freedom to choose and to will in responding to that call. This
event may be the very existential moment for which all human beings can properly be
said to exist and for which the autonomous will of humanity has the consummation of its

from this mystical yielding of the will to the Primal Will (mashiyyat awaliyya) our being
proper may be realized and actualized from ‘the realm of subtle entities’ (‘alam-i dharr).
