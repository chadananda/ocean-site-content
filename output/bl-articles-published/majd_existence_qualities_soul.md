On Existence and Qualities of the Human Soul

Farjam Majd

Abstract

In comparing animals and humans, or as put more modernly,
comparing humans with other animals, the questions of the
existence, nature, and necessity of a human soul often come up.

The question of existence of the human soul may be explored
from different perspectives. For example, this question may be
posed as “is there a human soul?” If so, what is it? why do we
need a soul? why not just the brain? Is it needed to explain
something, such as “continuation of life after physical death?”
If so, is it just a contrivance to answer such peripheral
questions?

To attempt a rational treatment of these questions, a two-
phase approach is adopted: first, a rational foundation is laid
out, and second, the principles established as part of this
rational foundation are applied to specific questions, such as
those posed above. The overall argument is the result of a
modern treatment and integration of several diverse concepts
Proclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh and explained by Abdu’l-Bahá. These
diverse concepts are presented aided by various quotes from the
Bahá’í sacred Writings.

In the first phase, science and rationality are compared and
their relationship established. A principle of primacy of logic
and rationality is developed that includes science as a subset.
Relationships are categorized into two broad classes: physical
and rational. A model of thought, human or otherwise, is
developed to precisely define what it means to think. The

124                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 16

central role of analogy to cognitive activities is described. The
physical world is defined as a realm where the fundamental
dimensions of time and space govern over all that is contained
therein. Further, a number of realms of existence, or
“Kingdoms,” including Mineral, Plant, Animal, and Human
Kingdoms are described.

In the second phase, a part scientific and part rational
methodology is employed to specifically answer the direct and
indirect questions about the existence of the human soul. It is
argued that no physical system, including the human brain, can
comprehend rational relationships because the rational and
physical realms do not overlap. This aspect differentiates man
from animal. One aspect of spirituality is described as the
ability to comprehend rational relationship. However, since
computers clearly represent and process rational relationships,
additional explanations are appropriate, and indeed, required.
Comprehension of rational relationships is not the same as their
representation or processing. Comprehension of an abstract or
rational relationship is realized only if it is analogically related
and successfully applied to a domain different from the one in
which it was discovered, when the two domains are materially
disjoint.

It is concluded that the mere fact of comprehension of
abstract rational relationships necessitates the existence and
assistance of a non-physical entity, the human soul, which
provides the power of rational comprehension from outside the
physical realm. The Kingdoms of existence further explain how
the human soul fits in a unified world of God.

Introduction

Here is an exercise for the reader: What holds the earth
suspended in space? (a) The World Turtle, (b) the World
Elephant, (c) the World Serpent, or (d) something else? This
exercise holds several important keys to answering the main
question posed by this paper: whether an entity called the

Existence and Qualities of the Soul                            125

human soul exists. The correct answer is (d): something else,
namely, the mutual gravitational pull between the earth and the
sun in balance with the centrifugal force acting on the earth due
to its orbital motion around the sun. And because no friction
exists in the vacuum of space, these balanced forces will
continue for a very long time or until other cosmic forces
intervene.

In ancient times, when the law of gravity and celestial
mechanics were unknown, people had to answer the question:
“if everything is ultimately resting on the earth, then what is the
earth resting on?!” Hence, different cultures came up with
variations of the above (a)-(c) explanations using mythical
creatures with magical powers. The main reasons for coming up
with these erroneous explanations were lack of knowledge and
bad assumptions. We already talked briefly about some of the
knowledge they lacked. Some of the bad assumptions included
the assumption that space has intrinsic “up” and “down”
directions. And that objects, including earth itself, “naturally”
fall “down” (rather than being actively pulled towards another
object due to the gravitational force between them without
regard to an up or a down), as confirmed by their common
experiences on earth. Hence, they assumed that the earth has to
fall “down” in the absence of something holding it up. Based on
these assumptions, they had to devise an explanation about
what holds up the earth. So, they did.

The key lessons we learn from the above exercise are as
follows. One, unexplained phenomena need an explanation.
Two, lack of knowledge and/or the wrong assumptions produce
the wrong explanations. And three, alternative explanations
must actually explain what is missing from the others. We will
apply these key lessons to our question about the existence of
soul in the rest of this paper.

A number of related questions come to mind: What is the
nature of the soul, if it exists? Is it energy? Is it a force of
nature? Is it a contrived and imaginary construct to explain

126                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 16

what we cannot otherwise explain? We will revisit these
questions when we have established the necessary foundations.

And why do we even care about the existence, or not, of the
human soul? When we define the problem below in more
specific terms, we will realize that the current explanations fall
short. Hence, we have to come up with another explanation,
which happens to have major implications about our nature and
our goals and objectives in life.

This paper is structured in two parts. In Part I, we will
define and describe several foundational concepts. In Part II,
we will set out to use the results from Part I to prove the
existence and some of the characteristics of the human soul.

Concept of Soul or Spirit

Knowing what it is that we are discussing is always a good
start. So, let us start with examining what we mean by “soul” or
“spirit.” Spirits are highly abused creatures. These terms and the
loose concepts behind them have been used to mean many
things, some even contradictory in essence. We only present
some anecdotal evidence of these uses here for the purpose of
clarifying what is meant by the use of these terms in the present
paper.

The terms “soul” and “spirit” are sometimes used
interchangeably and sometimes in distinct ways. For example,
people talk about “the soul of a nation,” meaning the essential
qualities that define that nation. Sometimes we talk about a
“spiritual experience,” meaning a deeply and emotionally
gratifying or illuminating experience. Even today, the word
“ravani” in the Persian language means both mental/
psychological and spiritual. The reason for this close
association is that before the advent of psychology and
advancement of medical and biological sciences that shed light
on some of the workings of human mind and brain, the mental
faculty was believed to be the exclusive domain of the human

Existence and Qualities of the Soul                           127

soul. So, a psychopath was thought to have a sick soul or spirit.
Similarly, soul and/or spirit have had varying associations with
the sacred, the mystical, the divine, and the like in different
cultural traditions. But probably the most commonly associated
concept with these terms is that of essence or core. In many
common usages of these terms, including the above examples,
the connotation of essence is clearly visible.

However, in this paper we will mainly use the term “soul”
and we mean something very specific by it. For our purposes,
the soul is defined as a non-physical entity in transcendental
communication with the brain, which differentiates humans
from animals and is the seat and source of general intelligence.

The Essential Questions

> And now concerning thy question regarding the soul of
> man and its survival after death. Know thou of a truth
> that the soul, after its separation from the body, will

> God, in a state and condition which neither the
> revolution of ages and centuries, nor the changes and
> chances of this world, can alter. — Bahá’u’lláh1

In the passage above, Bahá’u’lláh goes straight to the main
question. However, before getting there, we have to contend
with more elementary questions first. Now, with the above
definition of soul in mind, we can pose some essential questions
to guide our analysis.

The main one of these questions is this: Is there a human
soul? There are three main types of answers to an existential
question like this. A first type of answer is based on direct
facts. An example of this type is asking whether a cow has
horns. By direct observation of the fact that cows have horns,
we can answer this question. Since we have no direct or
objective visibility into the spiritual realm, if such realm even

128                                          Lights of Irfán vol. 16

exists, we cannot answer the question of the existence of
human soul on this basis.

A second type of answer is based on best explanation. This is
also referred to as Ockham’s razor, a rational principle
attributed to the 14th century British logician, William of
Ockham (c. 1287–1347), stating that among competing
hypotheses based on known facts the one with the fewest
unsupported assumptions is generally the best hypotheses, at
least until more facts are known or more assumptions are
verified. The “razor” alludes to the operation of cutting away,
figuratively speaking, of unnecessary assumptions and
explanations to come up with the remaining best explanation.
An example of this is two competing hypotheses for explaining
a traffic jam by either assuming time of day rush hour or
occurrence of an accident. This is a promising path for us.

And a third type of answer to existential questions is based
on inherent relationships. An example of this is knowing an
energy source must exist if work is observed being performed,
because work cannot be performed unless energy is being
applied. This is also a promising path for us.

Hence, the analysis that follows is based on a combination
of the latter two types of answers.

Other related questions to the question of the existence of
soul include: What is the soul? Why is it needed? Why not just
the brain to explain higher intelligence? Why would humans
have a soul but not animals? Is the soul just a contrivance to
explain other things such as immortality or another world? And
the questions related to brain can be repeated for computers
and processors.

To answer the above questions, we need to define what
intelligence is, what thinking means, how physical computing
systems, including the brain, work, and how the soul fits into
the picture.

PART I: Foundational Concepts

“Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler!” This
quote, attributed to Albert Einstein, is essentially the flip side
of Ockham’s razor. While Ockham’s razor helps us set the
upper limits of complexity in our hypotheses, Einstein’s razor,
as this quote is sometimes called, helps us set the lower limits.
The implication of Einstein’s razor for us is that we need at
least a certain number of foundational concepts to properly
analyze and answer these questions without losing any essential
information or knowledge in the process based on which we
may come up with the wrong hypotheses.

We surmise that the following foundations will be needed: a
definition of our general approach and methodology, a clear
model of thinking, a definition of intelligence, a simple model
of brain and its operation, a brief description of some of the
methods and limitations of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the
central role of analogy in intelligence.

Methodology and Approach

The methodology employed includes a combination of
scientific knowledge and rational reasoning, each entailing a
number of analytical methods. Several particular analytical
tools and/or procedure are essential for any proper and reliable
analysis. Sometimes these tools are explicitly defined and laid
out and sometimes they are in the form of unwritten or implicit
assumptions. No matter explicit or implicit, if one or more of
these tools are missing uncertainty and error will creep into the
analysis and resulting hypotheses. These procedures and tools
include at least a clear statement of the purpose and objectives
of the analysis, domain models (partly determined by the
objectives), clear definition and/or specification of terms and
concepts, and basic domain principles. Other analytical tools
and actions, such as determining the right criteria to know
success or failure of results, rules of logic that govern all
analytical processes, probability and statistics, and many other

130                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 16

procedures are often required, which we have to skip discussing
in the interest of brevity and focus. Knowing the purpose and
objectives of the analysis allows the determination of an
appropriate domain or system model, the applicable principles,
and appropriate criteria for the application of the principles.

A model of something in a particular domain generally
includes the system components, the relationships between
those components, and the domain operating principles. For
example, the model of a democratic government may include
elected leaders, an electorate or voters, laws governing
elections, freedom of speech and assembly, etc. A model is
generally not unique and changes with the application. For
example, if we want to analyze a democratic government for
judicial effectiveness we have to use a certain model of the
government and certain set of principles and criteria, while if
we want to analyze it for economic productivity, we have to
use a different model.

Definition, and more generally, specification of concepts
and terms is not only critical to any analysis, but required.
Specification is always in the context of a chosen model. That’s
why the definition of the same thing may be different with
respect to different domain models. Without having an
adequate specification, we quite literally do not know what we
are talking about. Let’s see why. The meaning of “definition” is
often incompletely understood. More often than not,
“definition” is thought to be mere naming or labeling of a
concept or a thing. But it is more than that. A “definition” is a
named set of attributes or characteristics. Like models,
definitions are not unique or fixed and change according to the
purpose of the definition. For example, if we have the set of
attributes: {a frame, two in-line wheels connected to the frame,
a handle connected to the frame, a pedal, and a chain connected
to the rear wheel}, and we assign a name to it, such as “Bicycle,”
then we have a definition of a bicycle. Now we can assign a
different name, such as “Zebra,” but the list of attributes still
specify a bicycle as we commonly know it. This point is

Existence and Qualities of the Soul                          131

important because we cannot change the nature of an entity
merely by renaming it, as is sometimes done by unscrupulous
politicians or sales people to mislead people by saying one thing
but meaning another. Two entities with different sets of
attributes are still different even if we call them by the same
name. For example, renaming a cow as a “horse,” does not make
a cow a horse, in spite of some obvious similarities between the
two.

All relationships and operations in a particular domain are
based on the principles that govern that domain. For example,
if we are analyzing a natural eco system, then we must know the
important principles that govern eco systems such as food
chain, reproduction rates, existence of water, territorial
behaviors of animals, etc. Once we know some of the relevant
principles, we can apply them to a particular eco system, such
as the American Rocky mountains. Similarly, other domains of
discourse have their own principles.

The general approach taken here is the identification of a
property, a behavior, or other characteristic, which cannot be
explained by other than a non-physical soul. But, how do we
identify such a characteristic, if one even exists? A good
starting point may be the sharp distinction between man and
other animals, speaking from a materialistic point of view that
considers man as just another animal.

Besides some anatomical and physiological differences, and
even though by widespread scientific accounts we share
anywhere between 95% and 99% of our DNA with
chimpanzees, there is absolutely no comparison between the
general intelligence and cognitive abilities of humans and any
other animal, including chimps, dolphins, crows, and octopi, as
the acknowledged intelligence champions of the wild. What
explains this enormous difference? the 1% difference in our
DNA? May be. But, this is not an argument for or against. It is
merely an observation looking for an explanation. What we
want to find out is whether such differences can be explained

132                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 16

by biology alone. Hence, the essential question boils down to
the source of our general intelligence.

Science and Rationality

With the ubiquitous success of science and scientific
theories, especially over the last couple of centuries or so, many
people have come to believe that “scientific” is synonymous
with “valid,” and even further, that science is the only path to
the truth. That is, a theory is only valid if it is scientific and
anything that is not scientific is invalid. However, even though
science does cover a vast area of human intellectual endeavors
and discoveries, based on our brief discussion of the scientific
method below, it does not cover all types of analysis. Science
chiefly operates using inductive reasoning. A whole class of
rational analysis, which is based on deductive reasoning
fundamentally lies outside the domain of science. Simply put,
science is a subset of the rational analysis, not vice versa.
Hence, everything valid is not necessarily scientific and
anything that is not scientific is not necessarily invalid. Of
course, scientific discovery is a complex business involving all
manners of rational activity at different stages, including
deductive reasoning. Nevertheless, the central rational
component and the overarching method of scientific endeavor
is inductive reasoning.

The scientific method may be generally formulated as
follows:2

> 1. Make observations
> 2. Formulate a hypothesis to explain the observations
3. Test or verify      the   hypothesis   using     controlled

experiments
The scientific method is an inductive process: we go from
specific observations to general conclusions. Inductive
reasoning is by nature, strictly speaking, inconclusive and
evolutionary. The conclusion is only as good as the current

collection of observations allows. The next observation may
alter the conclusion or theory. For example, if one observes a
sequence of measurements of some quantity (for example, the
temperature of an object) such as 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ..., and is
then asked to predict what the next number in the sequence
would be, he may present the hypothesis that this pattern is
defined by the sequence of even numbers, and thus the next
number would be 14. However, if the next number revealed in
the observed sequence happens to be 25, then the assumed
hypothesis turns out to be wrong and a different hypotheses
will be needed. This inductive phenomenon is well known in the
history of science and is behind all scientific progress: as new
data are discovered, scientific explanations evolve to explain
both the old and the new data and correct the deficiencies and
errors in the old theories.

It is noteworthy to recognize that error is a built-in feature
of science and the driver of scientific progress through a highly
intelligent and systematic trial and error process. So, it is rather
ironic that what some have elevated to the station of ultimate
criterion for discovering and judging the truth, thrives on error
as an inherent characteristic.

The inductive process is markedly different from the
deductive process. In contrast to the inductive process, the
deductive process, which is a main component of rational
reasoning, is conclusive and fixed. Once a truth is deductively
proven, it will never change, in contrast to scientific
discoveries and theories. That's why ancient mathematical
theories in geometry and algebra, or other areas of
mathematics, once proven, have never been “improved.” The
area of a circle, A, represented as π r2, where r is the radius of
the circle and π is a constant (3.14...), was discovered and
proven deductively, not scientifically. They did not cut out an
assortment of circular discs and measure their areas in a
laboratory to come up with this formula. Samples or observed
circles, although examined for insight, did not play a pivotal or
necessary role in proving this formula; deductive reasoning did.

134                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 16

As a matter of fact, this formula may be derived and proven by
dividing a circle into an infinite number of slices, like a pizza.
But since no physical object, such as sample discs, can be
divided infinitely, the proof is abstract and purely rational, not
scientific, strictly speaking.

Going a step further, it can be a rude awakening for some to
discover that mathematics itself, the bedrock of all science and
scientific endeavors, is not scientific! By its very nature,
deductive knowledge is absolute and immutable within the
system in which it was proven, while scientific knowledge is
inherently evolutionary and constantly changing.

A closely related question is what does it mean to prove
something, such as the existence of human soul? How do we
know we have proven what we set out to prove? Having a
“proof” generally means a valid conclusion is reached about a
statement. Mathematically, the proof of a theorem means that
the theorem, as defined, is true and that it contains no errors.
For example, a theorem in geometry may state that the sum of
internal angles of a triangle is 180º. Given the definitions of a
triangle, angle, and sum, it can be mathematically proven that
this theorem is true. Proof is based on the deductive process. In
contrast, a scientific theory is only inductively verified, not
proved, as discussed above.

The existence of a proof requires two main elements: facts
and principles. The process of deduction, also known as
reasoning, is the application of known principles or rules,
which themselves may be previously proven theorems, to facts
to prove a new theorem. Thus, for a proof of the existence of
soul, facts related to the supposed properties of the human soul
are needed that require an explanation, and principles are
needed to show the new theorem is consistent with other known
principles. In his many discourses about the soul, Abdul-Bahá
did not shy away from propounding rational proofs of the
existence of soul based on facts and principles, some of which
are briefly recounted here.

As such, because of the obvious limitations of observability
and testability, two of the essential components of the
scientific method, imposed by a purportedly non-physical soul,
the proof of its existence is rational in nature with a good dose
of scientific knowledge thrown in the mix to provide the facts
for the argument.

A few words are in order about what does not constitute
proof. Stories, personal experiences, conjectures, and other
similar evidences, even if true, do not rise to the level of proof.
This assertion is not meant to belittle such evidence or aver
their invalidity, but rather to distinguish them from a logical
proof.

The Primacy of Logic

In the analysis of subjects that have strong connections to
science, in reality or in our perception, the following discussion
is of prime importance because it clarifies the position of logic
with respect to science. Logic is the glue that binds together
other knowledge to come up with valid conclusions and is the
one indispensable tool of rational discourse. As such, logic has
priority over science, laws of physics, biology, the brain, and
any other area of human endeavor. Let’s see why.

Logic is, at its very core, a specification of the existential
requirements of any conclusion or result. Mathematically, three
necessary and sufficient logical operators exist to specify any
logical statement: AND, OR, and NOT. There is a
mathematically equivalent single operator, NAND, that may
serve the same purpose, but the original set of three operators
is more intuitive. The AND operator specifies all the
requirements (among those elements being considered) for a
true conclusion, the OR operator specifies one or more of the
requirements (that is, all are not necessary) for a true
conclusion, and NOT specifies an element that must not be true
for a conclusion to be true. Simple examples can illustrate the
concept: water AND soil are needed for a flower to grow; you

136                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 16

can go to the store by bicycle OR on foot; a door that is NOT
locked can be opened. In each of the foregoing examples, the
operator is shown in underlined bold font, the requirements are
shown in italics, and the conclusion or effect resulting from the
requirements is shown in normal text. Thus, as we initially
observed, the logical operators specify the requirements of
existence of the result (or a true conclusion, in the context of
information processing).

Logic is also like an information pipe, to use a metaphor. It
is content-invariant and knowledge-agnostic. Logic is not
concerned with what specific subject we are reasoning about. It
also is not concerned about the correctness of the knowledge
we use in our reasoning. For example, if we state that “an
elephant fits in a tea cup; a tea cup fits in my pocket, therefore,
an elephant fits in my pocket,” we are using perfectly valid
logic and correct reasoning, but with faulty knowledge. This is
known as valid but unsound logic (or reasoning) due to the
incorrect data or knowledge.

However, logic is not quite as simple as one may be lead to
believe from the foregoing examples. What we briefly discussed
above is propositional logic, dealing with logical constants.
Higher order predicate logic, such as the first order predicate
logic, the second order predicate logic, etc., deal with logical
functions and quantifiers and are well-known subjects in the
field of mathematical logic. The difference between
propositional logic and predicate logic, apart from technical
mathematical criteria such as whether or not they are consistent
and complete systems, is that propositional logic is concerned
with logical constants whose truth values are fixed. While
predicate logic deals with logical variables and functions. This
is loosely analogous to arithmetic and algebra, where arithmetic
is used to operate on constant numbers and algebra is used to
deal with variable numbers and functions of numbers.

Just as the complexity of advanced mathematics does not
change the fact that it is basically a study of quantities and how

they are related to each other, the complexity level of logic does
not change the fact that it is about existential conditions of
rational conclusions.

How does all this show the primacy of logic over science and
the laws of physics? It is a question of dependence: for any
entities A and B, if B depends on A, then A must exist first and
B can only exist afterwards. Existence of an entity precedes
every property of the entity, because no other property of the
entity can exist before the entity itself exists. Since logic
defines the existential conditions of any entity, it comes first.
That includes all physical phenomena and laws of nature. We
may have gotten a bit too abstract here, so let’s come back to
earth, to a more concrete and practical level. As far as we know
at this point of human advancement, the laws of nature, such as
the laws of thermodynamics, gravity, quantum physics, and
other such fundamental laws clearly underlie the physical reality
we perceive. Our understanding of these laws change over time,
yet the logical rules we use in our reasoning to rationally
understand and analyze these very laws of nature remain
unchanged. Conversely, no matter how our scientific
understanding of the laws of physics or nature change, our
logical methods do not. Thus, as far as our cognition is
concerned, our understanding of natural phenomena through
science is dependent upon logic, but the rules of logic are not
dependent on our understanding of the laws of nature. Hence,
the priority and primacy of logic.

Thinking: A Useful Model

Nothing can be understood in vacuum. Understanding
requires a frame of reference, or more generally, a model within
which a phenomenon can be placed, defined and analyzed. Since
we made general intelligence and its source the centerpiece of
our discourse and solely a property of the soul (no pun
intended), we need to clearly define and characterize the
context of intelligence, namely, thinking. Intelligence is the
mental tool with which we think. But what is thinking?

138                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 16

We can start with a simple definition of thinking and
develop and expand it to provide a rich context to understand
intelligence. At the most fundamental and elementary level,
thinking is the mental or symbolic counterpart of some external
phenomenon, usually, the reality. When you feel thirsty and
think to yourself: “I am going to get some water to drink,”
what are you doing? The mere fact of thinking does not get any
water into your body, nor does it quench your thirst. You are
simulating reality in advance. The electrochemical impulses and
interactions between the neurons in your brain, that is, the
thought of drinking water, is not the physical act of drinking
water, it is a symbolic or mental prelude to it. But thinking
doesn’t have to be about some action in the future. Memories
of the past or impressions of what may be happening to you
now, have similar relationships to reality. They are symbolic
representations of something real that happened in the past or
is happening now. Nor is thinking limited to actual events.
Thinking can also be about potential reality, things which may
exist or happen later, even if such thinking is pure fantasy and
cannot happen in reality, such as thinking about time travel.
Put slightly more precisely, thinking is the tracking of reality in
time, because everything, including real events and thinking
about those events all flow along the axis of time.

We can apply this definition of thinking to all examples of
our everyday experiences as well as deeper thoughts. For
example, imagine what you do and how it tracks reality when
you are planning for shopping: you mentally follow your travel
route to the store, visualize market shelves, make payment, and
travel back, all in your mind. Similarly, you are mentally
tracking reality when you remember a birthday party, or doing
an analysis of molecular behavior in a chemical reaction.

What is reality?

According to some, reality is in the eyes of the beholder. And
there is a certain amount of truth to this statement. However,
something must be there to behold in the first place, even if

different people see the same thing differently. With this
notion in mind, we now have to define reality in broad enough
terms to allow for different perceptions of it by different
people while preserving the integrity of our definition.

If we define thinking in terms of reality, then we must know
what reality is or at least how to characterize its important
attributes as related to thinking. The real world may be
accurately characterized by a model comprising a set of objects
and the relationships between those objects. This model may
have some grey areas that may be regarded as problematic or
awkward, but our purpose here is not to have a discourse about
the details of reality but to define what thinking means.

In this model of reality we have two components, which have
to be described. Simply put, an object is a “thing,” an entity
made of matter. This definition of an object is broader than it
may look at first glance. Suffice it to say, that all systems,
living or inanimate, regardless of form or function are
ultimately made of atoms. Even energy, in all its forms and
manifestations, by Einstein’s theory of special relativity
(specifically by E = mc2, where E is energy, m is mass of matter,
and c is the speed of light), is equivalent to matter. This latter
observation enlists electrical signals, electromagnetic waves,
and other such seemingly non-material entities under the banner
of “objects.”

Relationships constitute a very broad concept indeed, which
fully merit their position as one of the two components of
reality. Intuitively defined, a relationship is a “connection” of
some sort between two entities. Such entities may themselves be
objects or other relationships. This connection may be more
formally defined as an overlap between two sets that serve as
models for the two entities, as shown in Figure 1 below by the
white or blank elements. Any entity such as object, system,
concept, physical and abstract relationships, thoughts, and the
like may be modeled by a set of attributes, the attributes being
features, parts, behaviors or any other descriptive parameter

140                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 16

that can describe and specify the entity being modeled by the
set. When two such sets overlap, that is, when there are some
common attributes in the two sets, the overlap constitutes a
relationship between the two. In other words, this overlap is a
connection between the two entities, relating the two. Given
the above model, we can also conclude and recognize that
objects and relationships are interdependent and inherent: you
cannot have one without the other.

Figure 1: Relationships represented as the overlap of two sets.

As it turns out, relationships, or rather understanding them,
play an essential role in intelligence. To begin with,
relationships are of two types: material, physical, or observable
relationships and abstract or rational ones. Material
relationships are those which are observable via some sensory
facilities such as vision or other types of sensors. For example,
the relationship between the frame and the wheels of a bicycle
is readily visible in that the frame is connected to the wheels
and is supported by them. The defining property of a material
relationship is that it is physical in nature and thus sensible or
observable using some physical property, be the property
geometric, chemical, mechanical, electrical, thermal, or the like.
Other examples of physical/material relationships include those
between leaves and a tree, riverbed and river, and the
movements of clouds by wind.

Abstract or rational relationships, on the other hand, have
no physical manifestation and are entirely intellectual in

essence. To illustrate, returning to our example for the
distinction of science and rationality, a circle includes many
material as well as abstract relationships. The uniformly curved
contour of the perimeter of a physical circular object is a
visible and material trait, while the relationship between its
radius and its area is abstract (r2). Such abstract relationship is
not visible; it is not sensible; it is not physically detectable by
any means; it has no physical existence. It has only rational
existence. That is, no arrangement of matter can manifest a
rational relationship in and of itself without the use of rational
faculty. Other examples of rational relationships include those
embedded in geometric theories, the economic law of supply
and demand, and the design of software.

However, the most essential distinction between a physical
relationship and a rational one derives from what it means to be
physical. Simply put, a physical entity is one that occupies space
and is affected by time. Any and all physical entities, be they
physical objects or physical relationships, take some space and
age with time. Unlike physical relationships, rational
relationships occupy no space and are unaffected by passage of
time. The formula for the area of a circle is wholly independent
of spatial dimensions and does not change or decay with the
passage of time; it is today precisely what it was at the age of
the dinosaurs. As such, rational relationships are outside the
domain of the physical world as characterized by time and space.

Other phenomena are encountered in nature such as energy,
force, process, and others. What about these phenomena, which
are also encountered in the real world? Can these also be
classified as either objects or relationships? Yes. Some of them
like energy, are forms of matter as explained above and may
thus be considered as objects, broadly defined. Other
phenomena like force and process are relationships that result
from the interactions of objects. For example, force exerted
between two objects results from a difference in energy density
levels (Joules of energy per gram of mass) of the two objects.
For instance, the force of impact results from objects moving

142                                                Lights of Irfán vol. 16

at different speeds and thus having different kinetic energy
density levels.

We have talked about the simple components of reality,
namely, objects and relationships, but what about reality itself,
its model? Equally simple, is the model of reality defined as an
infinite mathematical space (as opposed to our physical three-
dimensional space) of objects and relationships represented by
a network graph with objects as vertices (circles) and
relationships connecting them (lines), as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: A model of reality: a network graph with objects as

vertices and relationships as edges.

As indicated above, both the objects and the relationships
may be either physical (shown as solid lines) or abstract (shown
as dotted lines).

In this model, anything that exists, an animal, a system,
various natural phenomena, atoms, man-made system like
economic and legal system, and the like can also be represented
as a subset of this space, namely, several objects with the
relationships between them. This model has uncountably
infinite objects and uncountably infinite relationships between
each two objects. The details of these assertions are beyond the
scope of this paper, however, recognizing that an object can be
created from any combination of other objects, and

relationships are created based on any defined attribute of
those objects, it should be apparent that the mathematical
space used for modeling reality is infinite.

So, what does all this have to do with thinking and the
human soul? Well, let’s first continue with the meaning of
thinking where we left off above, and search for our souls later.

Thinking is the process of traversal of this mathematical
space via the relationship pathways and the tools provided by
logic, while intelligence is the ability to traverse. Any example
of common (or uncommon) thinking fits well with these
definitions. For instance, thinking about navigating objects in a
room while walking, an election process, steps in solving a
problem, or designing a can opener, all involve traversing this
space via various relevant relationships that we observe.

A Model of the Brain

At the most basic level, we can model the brain simply as a
system with inputs and outputs, as shown in Figure 3 below.
Many systems, no matter how complex or from what field of
study, are modeled this way because of its simplicity, accuracy,
and clarity.

Input                               Output

System

Figure 3: A model of systems also suitable as a basic model of

the brain.

Let’s apply this model to the brain in more specific terms.

The central nervous system, the most important part of which
is the brain, is an information processing system with three
major cognitive functions: information collection, integration,
and storage; information processing (thinking); and new

144                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 16

information production (discovery). Brain is also a controller
of the body parts and internal systems, but this is not a
cognitive function.

Brain’s external behavior can be characterized as an input-
process-output system, where the inputs are the information
provided by the five senses, the process is the processing of
information, and output is the behavior of the body and new
knowledge.

The input to the brain includes the five senses: sight, hearing,
smell, touch, and taste, as schematically shown in Figure 4
below.

Artificial Intelligence: A Few Notes

A common, but potentially misleading, definition of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability to imitate human
intelligence. AI has existed in various forms and incarnations
since ancient times. The technological form of AI is only a few
decades old. In the old times, AI was not known as “AI,” but
rather as mythical creatures or wishful objects such as dragons,
demons, mirrors, moving statues (in those days they were not
called robots), crystal balls, and the like, which could mimic
human intelligence in some fashion. Later as human knowledge
and capabilities increased, various forms of mechanized
intelligence started to emerge.

This brings us to the mid 20th century, really 1960’s, when
serious AI started with the invention and development of
digital computers. Such wishful thinking, which was always
“just 20 years away” peaked in the 1980’s and 1990’s, most
notably in the U.S. and Japan, which had developed some of the
most powerful supercomputers of the day, such as Cray1, Cray-
2, Cray-X-MP, and Cray Y-MP in the U.S., and SX-3/44R and
Hitachi SR2201 in Japan. These computers used multiple
processors working in parallel to provide many Gigaflops and
teraflops (billions or trillions of Floating Point Operations) per
second.

Even though to this date computers have continued on their
path of ever more processors and teraflops, towards the end of
1990’s and early 2000’s the wishful dreamers of the human-like
artificial intelligence were rudely awakened by a gradual dose of
reality. After about 40-50 years of thinking that true AI that
could rival or surpass human intelligence was right around the
corner, true general intelligence was not forthcoming. Sure
enough, success abounded in limited cognitive domains such as
chess playing software that defeated even the best of human
chess masters; “expert systems,” as domain-specific software
are known, that could analyze seismic waveforms in oil and gas
exploration; speech synthesizers and recognizers with 95% or
more accuracy, and the like. But, general intelligence that works
in sophisticated new fields, generates new and accurate theories
about various phenomena, and displays common-sense
reasoning, eluded such age-old AI dreams.

The modern technologically based AI banks on the idea that
intelligence is the same as computation and merely having more
and more processing power will ensure higher and higher levels
of intelligence. Hence, the AI field views thinking purely as
information processing. Thus, any system, live or inanimate,
that has more processing power can be potentially more
intelligent. Thus, the logical conclusion based on this
assumption is that computers will inevitably surpass human

146                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 16

intelligence when they amass sufficient processing power. Well,
this assumption is a serious and largely unrecognized flaw.

As we shall see later, there is more to general intelligence
than processing power or computation. It will require visibility
of abstract relationships, and less obviously, life and emotions.
However, this paper is more focused on the ability to see
abstract relationships than the life and emotional aspects.

Analogy and Cognition: Thinking Model Extended

We started by defining thinking as tracking reality in our
minds modeled as traversing the graph in the reality object-
relationship space model. But there are other important aspects
to thinking within this model. One of the most important
aspects of this model is how the traversal is performed. The
traversal does not simply start at point A and continue to
another point B within the graph. Multiple sub-graphs (subsets
in the reality space model) may be traversed in the process of
one thought. And these sub-graphs may not be directly
connected or adjacent. But how these sub-graphs are connected
is through analogy. Let’s see how.

Analogy plays a central role in abstract thought, as we will
see in Part II below. For now, let’s see precisely what analogy
means and how it is related to the reality space model. At a
basic level, analogy is a recognition of abstract similarity
(physical or tangible similarity is not analogy) and means
applying a particular relationship from one context to another
unrelated context. For example, we may analogize the legs on a
horse to the wheels on a car. Even though the legs of the horse
have no physical similarity (or connection) to the wheels of a
car, in substance or in action, but they perform at least some of
the same functions, namely, supporting the body and providing
motion. hence we see and can apply the same relationship
between a horse and its legs to a car and its wheels. However,
analogy goes a lot further than this simple I.Q. (Intelligent
Quotient) test question.

More precisely, analogy is about categorization.

Categorization may seem like a curious concept to occupy such
an esteemed position in relation to intelligence. But, what is
even more curious is that categorization actually defines a very
important type of relationship in the model of reality. To see
why this is, we need to first take an excursion from this thread
of thought and then come back to it, as we often do.

Trees of Reality

This can be a rather complicated excursion if we get into too
much detail, so we will suffice with the general concept. In the
object-relationship space model of reality, a graph was
described in which objects were connected to each other via
relationships. Going one step further, we recognize that there
are different kinds of relationships in this model. In a sense we
can say those lines representing relationships in the reality
model of Figure 2, are not just lines. Each one may have an
internal structure of its own, like a sky scraper that from far
away may look like a thick line, but up close it has additional
features. Two of the most important and general kinds of
relationships are best represented by the System and Type Trees
described below.

A very prominent and invariable truth is that the world of
creation is characterized by limits. If there were no limits, quite
literally nothing could be distinguished from another, nothing
could be quantified. Indeed, without limits it would not even
be possible to define anything, because defining something
requires identifying its boundaries. Given this truth, anything
can be considered a system having a number of components,
while every component itself may be regarded as a system
having its own components, and every system may be regarded
as a component in a bigger system. This view logically follows
from the concept of limits because a system is a set of entities
with a boundary around them and so, everything with a
boundary qualifies as a system, and that means everything.

148                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 16

A couple of illustrative examples should convince the reader
that this system-oriented view is valid and accurate about all
things, processes, and phenomena. Consider an object, any
object, such as house. It is immediately obvious that a house is
composed of rooms as its components, while a room itself is a
system with components of its own such as its walls, and the
walls are systems in their own rights having bricks as their
components, and so on. In the other direction, a house is a
component of a system of neighborhood, and the system of
neighborhood is itself a component of a system of city, and so
on. As another, wholly different kind of example, take a
paragraph in a book. It is a system the components of which are
the sentences. In turn, the sentences are each a system with
words as their components, and the words have letters as their
components, and so on. Again, in the other direction, a
paragraph may be component in a system of a page, while a
page is a component in a chapter, and so on. This concept is
equally applicable to any processes the steps of which are its
components, and the process itself is but a step in a bigger
process. These very different examples illustrate the absolutely
general reach and applicability of system structure.

This system structure aspect of reality is illustrated in Figure
5, below with the aid of the System Tree. The System Tree is an
upside-down (with root at the top) and Specific-To-General
(STG) tree, where its root represents something specific, and as
we traverse down the tree towards its leaves, the components
become progressively more generic and general. For example, a
specific house is distinguished from other houses, but a brick in
the wall is the same as any other brick in any other wall. The
System Tree is applicable to processes as well, where each
process has steps of its own and the whole process may be a
step in a bigger process.

Hence, any entity in the world can be represented by a
System Tree, which is not unique, incidentally. Many System
Trees may be constructed for the same entity depending on
what we want to model and what boundaries or aspect of the

entity we are interested in. For example, a car is a component in
an industrial system as well as an economic system. Hence a car
can be a component in two different system. Actually, any
object is a member of infinitely many systems.

Figure 5: The System Tree - Specific To General (STG)

Just like any entity can be represented by a System Tree, it
can also be represented by a Type Tree, simultaneously. But,
what is a Type Tree and why is it as general as a System Tree? A
Type Tree may be represented by another upside-down tree, this
time, General-To-Specific (GTS; root is most general).

Consider a set of properties that define a type. It doesn’t
matter what we call the type, it is the set of properties that
matter. Then any other entity that includes the same set of
properties belongs to that type. When an entity has the same set
of properties plus additional properties, then that entity is of
that type, but a more specific version of it. Since every entity
has some set of properties, then every entity has some type (or
is of some type). This concept may be a bit abstract. So, again,
we use a couple of examples to illustrate the concept and also
show its absolute applicability.

As a first illustration, consider our favorite example, a
house. With reference to Figure 6, below, a Structure, which

150                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 16

has some properties such as being rigid, being free-standing,
and having a fixed relationship between its parts, is a root type,
in this example. Traversing down from the root, we encounter a
Building type, which is still a structure with all the properties of
a Structure type, but with some added properties such as some
facilities for human use and interaction like doors, stairs,
lighting, etc. This makes a Building type just a more specific
version of a Structure type. Moving further down, we get to a
Residential Building type, which is still a more specific Building
type and a Structure type, again, with some added properties
like having facilities for human habitation, such as a kitchen, a
bathroom, heating, etc. And finally a House type is a
Residential Building type, a Building type, and a Structure type,
albeit, a more specific version of them. Traversing the tree
from the root upwards, we observe that a structure can itself
be part of a more general type, such as Inanimate Objects type.

For our second illustration, we revert to our literary
example. A Paragraph can be a root type in some defined Type
Tree. An English Paragraph, is a more specific version of a
Paragraph type with the added property of being in English
language, and an English Introduction Paragraph is still a more
specific type of the above types.

So, it is clear that because every entity has a set of
properties, every entity defines a type and by adding or
subtracting properties from the set we arrive at more specific
or more general versions of the same type. And again, like the
System Tree, the Type Tree is not unique and an entity can be
part of infinitely many Type Trees depending on what
properties we focus on.

Another term for type is category, which sometimes has
more familiar connotations for our purposes. A rather subtle
question that arises is the difference between the mental act of
categorization of various phenomena based on their abstract
properties and the similar physical effects those properties. For
example, a human may mentally categorize predators, such as

wolves and lions, according to their territorial and pack
behaviors. However, a prey animal, such as an antelope, is
affected by these behaviors without having to understand or
mentally categorize them in an abstract manner. Recognizing
this distinction is important, lest we forget the abstract nature
of categorization.

Figure 6: The Type Tree - General To Specific To (GTS)

The categorization or classification in the Type Tree is done
based on one or a combination of several parameters. This
means for a given parameter, each discrete value can result in a
new sub-category. For example, when categorizing animals, if
the parameter is habitat, then each different type of habitat
results in a different category of animals. This means the
category of “sea animals” will include whale (mammal), tuna
(fish) and octopus (invertebrate), among others. But if the
parameter is being warm- or cold-blooded, then the category of
“warm-blooded animals” will include whale and pigeon, among
others. This parameter(s) is called a basis. So, different basis
result in different categorizations of the same objects or
concepts.

Now, let’s go back to the relationship between thinking and
categorization. When we think about something we actually

152                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 16

think about its properties, which determine its form, behavior,
interactions with other things, reaction to various elements,
and anything else we want to discuss about that thing. But since
properties also define types or categories of things, inevitably
we categorize things that we think about, whether implicitly or
explicitly. As you might remember, analogy is all about abstract
similarity. So, analogy can be expressed in terms of the Type
Tree. By definition, two entities that belong to the same
category (or Type Tree) share some properties or
characteristics. As properties can be highly abstract, so can
types. For example, the category of “hard” can include entities
as diverse as hammer, water (as in hard water), exam,
circumstances, direction (as in making a hard right turn) and
many others. Note that none of these entities have any physical
or apparent relationship to each other, yet they all belong to the
same abstract type of “hard.” As such, we can define a Type
Tree with the root being the most general understanding of
“hard” (say, with the abstract property of having great
influence on other things) and the other lower level nodes
become progressively more specific types of “hard.”

An important result of categorization is that when two
entities are determined to belong to the same category, then the
known properties of one entity suddenly becomes applicable to
the other one, which might hitherto have been unknown. For
example, many geometric properties of circles belong to the
same category as properties of electrical signals (such as
frequency, phase angles, trigonometric relationships, and the
like), while the shape “circle” has very little to do with the
physical phenomenon of “electricity”, outside of their rational
or abstract relationships. As such, the geometric properties of a
circle are suddenly seen to be applicable to the analysis of
electrical signals (or other types of signals like optical ones).
This realization greatly facilitates, nay, makes possible, the
analysis of signal processing, without which our understanding
and application of electrical signals would only be primitive
and limited to trivial outward observations.

Categorization is not a mere cognitive tool or trick to make
our job of thinking easier. Abstract thought is all but
impossible without the use of categorization of everything that
we encounter. We use existing categories or modify them or
create new ones all the time and then catalog everything
accordingly, so, we know what to do with them based on the
category they are in. Otherwise, we would have to reinvent
every thought every time which, would bring our thoughts, and
everything that depends on our thoughts, such as new insights,
understandings, theories, discoveries, inventions, etc., to a
grinding halt. An equally important function of categories is
that they help us filter out things that do not belong to a
current category of interest and focus on the task at hand. This
is not a trivial benefit given the massive amounts of irrelevant
information in our environment that are always at ready to act
as noise to the information of interest.

An interesting thing about categories is that all basic
categories originate from tangible things because the origin of
our knowledge and our initial experience with a particular
category starts with our senses. The reason for this origin is
that we generalize and build categories starting from the
tangible, specific and simple, leading up to the more abstract,
general and complex. This observation is in accord with Abdu’l-
Bahá’s elucidation that: “A thing cannot be grasped by the
intelligence except when it is clothed in an intelligible form;
otherwise, it is but an effort of the imagination.” [SAQ 115]

Another confirmation of the fundamental importance of
categorization in cognition and thinking has surfaced recently
in a book named Surfaces and Essences, by authors and
professors Douglas Hofstadter and Emmanuel Sander. In this
book, Hofstadter and Sander spend considerable time to lay out
a foundation for their thesis. They spend the rest of the book
to go through a great deal of detail about the many facets of
categorization in the context of human thought.3 More
specifically, Hofstadter and Sander start out by
characterization of “Analogy as the Core of Cognition.”4 Then,

154                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 16

they proceed to lay down the foundations for their thesis by
regarding “Categorization and Analogy-making as the Roots of
Thinking.”5 Interestingly enough, they also use simple drawings,
similar to the Type Tree described above, to depict some of
these concepts.6

And so, our enhanced model of thinking includes not only
traversing the object-relationship reality space, but also making
our traversal more comprehensive and faster using the power of
analogy to connect different subsets of this space together.

PART - II: Proof of The Existence of Soul

We have established some important foundational concepts.

Now is time to apply these concepts to prove the existence and
immortality of human soul. In this part, we will further
complete our model of reality with additional structural
refinements as explained by Abdu’l-Bahá. We will also briefly
review some of the proofs of the existence of soul by Abdu’l-
Bahá. Next, our brain model is upgraded to allow for spiritual
activities such as abstract relationship recognition. However,
all these will distinguish humans from animals for most part,
but what about computers? To answer this question, we will
extend our reasoning to show that machines are also excluded
from the domain of general intelligence and rational
relationships. Finally, we conclude that the human soul is
immortal.

Unity of Existence and the four Kingdoms

An ancient philosophical theme is unity. Indeed, even
without a precise definition, we can see some form of unity
underlying all things in one way or another. A rather practical
definition of unity among a number of seemingly diverse things
is broad commonality. In that commonality, these diverse
things are united. Imagine all the diverse cars in the world
which, are all united by sharing the common characteristics of
all cars. Without delving too deeply into this concept, as it is

not the subject of our discussion here, let’s examine the
greatest unity of all: the unity of existence.

> ... this mineral belongs to the mineral kingdom; however
> far it may rise, it can never comprehend the power of
> growth. The plants, the trees, whatever progress they
> may make, cannot conceive of the power of sight or the
> powers of the other senses; and the animal cannot
> imagine the condition of man -- that is to say, his
> spiritual powers. [SAQ 221]

In several passages in his writings and utterances, including
the above, Abdu’l-Bahá divides the world into four concentric
“kingdoms” or realms. These kingdoms include the Mineral
Kingdom, the Plant Kingdom, the Animal Kingdom, and the
Human Kingdom, each with its own special power. The power
of the Mineral Kingdom is its physical strength, the power of
the Plant Kingdom is growth, the power of Animal Kingdom is
senses and integration of information from the senses, and the
power of the Human Kingdom is general intelligence.

These kingdoms are further arranged in order from lowest to
highest forms and capabilities, where each higher kingdom has
the powers of all the lower ones and comprehend them, but not
vice versa. So, for example, the Animal Kingdom has the
physical strength of minerals and the growth power of plants in
addition to its own power of senses and information
processing. This is the “concentric” part of these kingdoms,
diagrammatically shown below in Figure 8.

We might ask: “what is the basis of this categorization?” At
least one parameter in its basis is the strategy or method of
survival. Briefly, minerals defend their survival by their physical
strength of material, that is, they resist deformation. Their
form defines what they are and in a sense is their “life” (a
crushed tin box is a dead box). Once a mineral entity loses its
form, there is no going back, on its own, that is. We know this
because any physical change in an object requires energy. That

156                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 16

is precisely how much the object is resisting its deformation, or
“death.” For the plants, the survival strategy includes the
physical strength of minerals plus the power of growth, which
mends them, to some extent, if damage occurs. And they do this
on their own. For animals, the survival strategy includes the
minerals’ and the plants’ plus remote sensing and central
nervous system for sensory information integration. So,
animals can detect danger before it even gets physically close to
them. And they also learn from experience. Humans have all
these lower survival strategies plus a rational mind that can see
“invisible” dangers, not picked up by any physical sense, but by
rational reasoning, such as predicting what happens to crops six
months later if we have drought today.

Why is this classification of the world and its contents into
these four kingdoms significant? For one thing, this structure
helps us organize the world into a more understandable and
manageable place, at least information-wise. However, for our
purposes, this classification gives us an important insight,
namely, that all these realms are part of a single unified world,
not a fragmented random one. The denizens of each of these
kingdoms, however, can only interact and “see” that portion or
subset of the whole world that its kingdom is equipped to
interact with. For example, a plant can only interact with the
subset of the world that plants utilize for growth such as soil,
water, sunshine, breeze, and the like. An animal can interact
with all these elements in addition to what it can sense via any
of its senses. To a flower a car passing by has no existence. The
flower is absolutely incapable of seeing or sensing the existence
of the car in any shape, way, or form. A dog however, can see,
hear, and smell the car from a distance and can further
remember and process the information so collected by its sense,
for example, recognizing its master’s car when coming home.
Hence, even though the whole world exists out there, each
creature can only see or comprehend the subset it can interact
with. The realization that creatures in each kingdom have

visibility to only a limited subset of the universe, is critical to
understanding the spiritual realm, as we shall see later.

For the sake of consistency and completeness, the unity of
the world is logically not limited to our physical universe. If
there are other universes, as the multi-verse theory suggests, all
these universes are still part of one unified existence, defined as
the realm that contains anything that exists including any
number of universes, their laws, and their creatures.

A Property of Soul: Intelligence

In many of his tablets and utterances Abdu’l-Bahá explains
that the progress of man is because of his spiritual powers. For
example, the following passage makes this point clear.

> Though man has powers and outer senses in common
> with the animal, yet an extraordinary power exists in
> him of which the animal is bereft. The sciences, arts,
> inventions, trades, and discoveries of realities, are the
> results of this spiritual power. This is a power which
> encompasses all things, comprehends their realities,
> discovers all the hidden mysteries of beings, and through
> this knowledge controls them: it even perceives things
> which do not exist outwardly; that is to say, intellectual
> realities which are not sensible, and which have no
> outward existence, because they are invisible.

He continues:

> Moreover, these existing sciences, arts, laws, and endless
> inventions of man at one time were invisible,
> mysterious, and hidden secrets; it is only the all-
> encompassing human power which has discovered and
> brought them out from the plane of the invisible to the
> plane of the visible. [SAQ 186]
158                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 16

Even more explicitly, Abdu’l-Bahá declares that intelligence
(“mental faculties”) is a direct emanation of the human soul:
“Now concerning mental faculties, they are in truth of the
inherent properties of the soul, even as the radiation of light is
the essential property of the sun.”7

These passages, especially the highlighted segments, directly
guide our way to a precise proof of the existence of soul and
intelligence as one its prominent properties. Before we embark
on the main proof, however, let’s review some of Abdu’l-Bahá’s
proofs and elucidations regarding the human soul. These are not
always proofs, per se, but rather guiding principles and
comments that show the way to those who want to research and
gain a deeper understanding of his guidance.

Abdu’l-Bahá’s Proofs and Commentaries on Existence of Soul:
A Brief Survey

Bahá’u’lláh and Abdu’l-Bahá, in numerous tablets, have
explained the existence and character of the human soul, to the
extent possible to understand such matters in the physical
realm. One of Abdu’l-Bahá’s proofs that man is different from
animal, and the source of the main principle for this paper, is
the ability of man to perceive rational relationships while
animals are limited to sensed relationships, as explained in the
quote above and further elaborated in the quote below:

> The animal cannot realize the intelligence of a human
> being, he only knows that which is perceived by his
> animal senses, he cannot imagine anything in the
> abstract. An animal could not learn that the world is
> round, that the earth revolves round the sun, or the
> construction of the electric telegraph. [PT 11]

In another tablet, Abdu’l-Bahá draws our attention to the
difference between the mind and the soul in the context of
sleep and dream. He explains that:

> The mind is circumscribed, the soul limitless. It is by the
> aid of such senses as those of sight, hearing, taste, smell
> and touch, that the mind comprehendeth, whereas the
> soul is free from all agencies. The soul as thou
> observest, whether it be in sleep or waking, is in motion
> and ever active. Possibly it may, whilst in a dream,
> unravel an intricate problem, incapable of solution in
> the waking state.8

Some may try to superficially dismiss these explanations by
asserting that brain processes associated with cognition can
continue during sleep, and there is no reason to appeal to the
existence of soul, however, as we’ll see, cognition is not just a
matter of information processing.

In still another proof, Abdu’l-Bahá explains that the human
soul is not dependent on the health of the body, unlike the
human mind, which is the functional product of the brain:

> Consider how the human intellect develops and weakens,
> and may at times come to naught, whereas the soul
> changeth not. For the mind to manifest itself, the human
> body must be whole; and a sound mind cannot be but in
> a sound body, whereas the soul dependeth not upon the
> body.9

In numerous tablets, Bahá’u’lláh likens the human soul to a
bird and his body to a cage: “from thy mortal cage wing thy
flight unto the paradise of the Placeless” [HW 36]. He similarly
likens the human soul to light and his body to a lamp: “Thou art
My lamp and My light is in thee” [HW 6]. Bahá’u’lláh uses these
metaphors, among others, to reveal and emphasize the
independence of the soul from the body.

The Proof: Why Physical Systems Cannot Understand Rational
Relationships

At this point, we have spend quite a bit of time defining,
developing, and polishing different pieces of the proof. These
pieces form a rather extensive list including our part scientific -
part rational methodology; the fact that science is not the only
or even the main analytical attraction in town; the primacy of
logic; a model of reality, its four kingdoms, and important
relationships represented by System and Type Trees; definition
of physical and rational relationships as overlap between sets of
entities; a model of thinking based on the model of reality;
definition of intelligence as the ability to think in this model;
and general intelligence as (a yet-to-be-proven) property of
soul. Now is the time to put these pieces together.

The gist of the proof, the basic thesis is that a physical
system, any physical system, brain and computer included,
cannot understand a rational relationships because they have no
physical existence. Let’s now prove this thesis.

We defined a relationship between two entities as a
connection (technically, an overlap) between two sets
representing the two entities. Hence, for a relationship between
two entities to exist, a connection must exist. Understanding
something requires having a connection with that something
first. If there is no connection there can be no understanding.
Let’s put this in more concrete terms. All physical relationships
are between physical objects. So, a physical system can make a
connection with such physical objects and thus, process the
information so obtained. But what if the relationship is rational
and not physical? Remember that rational relationships have no
physical existence because they are outside the domain of time
and space, which chiefly characterize the physical world. As
explained earlier in Part I, a physical relationship, such as the
relationship between a wall and a door in a building, requires
space and changes with passage of time. But a rational
relationship, such as the formula for the calculation of the area

of a rectangle (area = long side x short side) has no need for
space to exist and is not altered or otherwise affected by the
passage of time. Hence, it is fundamentally outside the domain
of physical existence. In contrast a physical system, by
definition, is bound within time and space and is in the physical
realm. But, by definition, the realms inside and outside the
physical domain are mutually exclusive, have no overlap and no
connection. Therefore, a physical system, bound in the physical
realm, cannot detect, understand, or process a rational
relationship which lies outside the physical realm. In set theory
jargon, a set and what lies outside the set (called its
complement) have no overlap. A metaphor may serve to
crystallize the concept: it is like trying to catch the wind in a
net. Wind has no solid body to be caught in the net. In a way it
has little material overlap or connection with the net. That’s
why the net and the wind cannot make effective contact.

Well, this all sounds very interesting, but then how is it that
we as humans understand all these rational relationships with
our brains quite well, seeing and processing them by the
thousands every day? The answer is we don’t, not with our
brains. The only way we could possibly see and understand any
rational and abstract relationships is with a system in the same
domain as the rational relationships. We can call this realm the
spiritual realm and the system for understanding them the spirit
or the soul.

Animals, not being equipped with a spiritual system or soul,
can see the physical relationships and aspects in an experience,
but not its rational aspects. A chimpanzee can see a circle, can
match the shape to another round object, can distinguish a
circle from a triangle, because these are all physical
relationships and thus, sensible. But it cannot see or understand
the concept of multiplication or area calculation. Such
concepts and relationships are completely and literally invisible,
nay, non-existent to it. Like the net, its brain cannot catch the
rational wind. It has no connection with it.

162                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 16

This concludes the core of our proof, but it is not all. We
still have to answer other important questions, such as how is
this spiritual system in communication with us? If it is in a
different realm, then how can we have a connection with it?
Where is the overlap? How can our physical brain memory
retain the rational relationships and our understanding of them?
This is not an exhaustive list of questions and issues, but it is a
good start.

Brain Model Extended

Since the above questions revolve around the role of the
brain in cognition, the role of the brain seems like a good place
to continue with this discussion. With the above arguments and
insights regarding the requirements for seeing and
understanding rational relationships, we can now extend the
brain model described above with respect to Figure 4.

Consistent with the model presented in Figure 4, we can
extend the power and vision of the brain, which is a physical
system, to see and understand rational relationships. If we
model the soul as a rational sense, a true sixth sense that detects
rational relationships and relay it to the brain, much the same
way the eye detects visual information and the ear detects
sound signals, then we have a consistent model that accounts
for human brain’s capacity to understand rational relationship.
This relationship between the soul and the brain is shown
schematically in Figure 7 as a little ghost, since physical
attributes, such as shape, cannot be associated with the soul.
Hence, in this model, the brain, despite being a physical system,
is given the capacity, through the instrumentality of the soul, to
see the whole of existence not just what is visible at the level of
the animal kingdom.

Figure 7: Brain extension: six senses as inputs to the system of

brain.

This model explains the external operation of the brain
system as a whole. However, it still doesn’t seem to explain how
the brain can be in contact with this spiritual sense, the soul,
the existence of which is limited to the spiritual or non-physical
realm.

To explain the connection between the brain and the soul,
let’s revisit the model of reality and remodel it a little.

Model of Reality: New and Improved

Like the updated model of the brain, the model of reality is
augmented with a new set of relationships superimposed on the
original ones shown in Figure 2. The model of Figure 2 showed
the generic set of relationships between all entities in the world.
The System and Type Trees of Figures 5 and 6 introduced new
relationships that classified the generic ones. In other words,
some of the relationships shown generically in Figure 2 as lines
have the additional properties of the System and Type Trees.
Continuing with this process of refinement and augmentation,
Figure 8 below adds another layer of properties and attributes
to the generic relationships. That means while some objects in
the model of Figure 2 may be related to one another in
particular ways, such as by color or shape, they can further be
related to each other by being members of one of the four

164                                         Lights of Irfán vol. 16

kingdoms of Mineral, Plant, Animal, and Human kingdoms, as
discussed earlier.

In short, each of the augmentations made to the basic model
of reality adds some attributes and refinements rather than
changing it altogether. This is like adding layers of new ideas
and relationships to the model of reality. But, how does this
new model answer our questions regarding the connection
between the soul and the brain?

Figure 8: An aspect of the model of reality augmented with the

four Kingdoms.

Even though each kingdom is separated from others, but at
its boundary the kingdom touches the adjacent ones. This is
called an interface. An interface between two domains is a
gateway for communicating information (which may be
embedded in energy or material such as heat, fluids, chemicals,
etc.) between the two without mixing the domains. The concept
of an interface is well-known in computers, biology, and other
technical circles. As an example, consider the boundary between
minerals and plants. A handful of soil is a member of the
Mineral Kingdom while a rose bush is a member of the Plant
Kingdom. There is no mixing of the two, however, they do have

an interface. The rose bush roots absorbs water and minerals
from the soil, which are then integrated with the plant and
become part of that kingdom. At the same time the physical
presence, such as the size and weight of the plant, is “sensed” or
“seen” by the soil without seeing any more of the Plant
Kingdom. Thus, there is some form of information exchange
between these two kingdoms at the interface.

Applying the interface concept to the boundary between the
Human Kingdom (where our brain resides) and the spiritual
realm (where the soul resides) can explain how the soul can
interface with our brain. The exact nature of this interface is
transcendental, by definition, and is largely unknowable
because one side of this interface, namely the soul, is invisible
in our physical world. However, once our soul sees or detects a
rational relationship and relays it across this interface to our
brain, then the rational relationship becomes just another piece
of information that can be recorded in our memory like the
information collected by any other physical sense, such as our
eyes and ears. This way, the rational knowledge from the
invisible spiritual realm is transmitted to the physical realm.

At this point, it bears emphasis that the augmented model of
reality of Figure 8 shows a unified existence and the rational
relationships seen by the soul are merely the most general and at
the highest level of this existence. Thus, it is not unreal for such
spiritually based rational relationships to be transferred to a
lower kingdom in some form, as they are all part of the same
existence.

Can Machines “Think?”

As much as we may wish, this is not the end of this journey.

So far, we have shown that no physical system can possess
general intelligence and understand rational relationships, thus,
necessitating the existence of a non-physical soul. This theory
shows the difference between humans and animals. However, a
very important question of modern origins remain: if no

166                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 16

physical system can detect and process rational relationships,
then how do computers do it?

Clearly, computers can and do process abstract and rational
relationships every day, doing it even as this paper is being
written on a modern word processor. What gives? Humans do!

To understand how computers do not violate the
requirement that a non-physical system must understand
rational relationships, and are not an exception to this rule, we
have to go back to the critical role of analogy and
categorization in cognition, discussed in Part I. It is important
to keep in mind that the core logical reason that animals or
computers cannot see nor understand rational relationships is
still the fact that rational relationships are outside the bounds
of time and space and literally do not exist in the physical
realm, and hence, have no connection with animals or
computers, as discussed above in detail. But we still need to
explain the questions posed above with respect to computer
processing of rational relationships.

The key to recognizing that computers do not understand
rational relationships any more than a doorstop, is realizing the
difference between understanding and representation.
Representation of information basically entails the encoding of
information in a symbolic form. For example, computer
languages represent information in binary format (a string of
0’s and 1’s, such as 2 = 010, and 5 = 101), and natural languages,
like English and Japanese, represent information using
alphabet, logograms, or other symbolic forms. Representation
in and of itself does not convey semantics or meaning. A
computer no more understands its program than a book
understands its contents. Representation is merely an
assignment of a symbol to an object or an action. In
mathematics, this is called a mapping. If the object or action is
not understood in the first place, then merely mapping it to a
different symbol does not bring about its comprehension. If

one doesn’t know what osmosis is, then translating it to a
different language does not alter his lack of knowledge.

Computers can process abstract information and
relationships, in the form of formulas, algorithms, computer
languages, and other computing constructs because humans
have already encoded these rational relationships in those
formulas, algorithms, and languages. In other words, humans
already have understood the relationships and have merely
encoded them into the computing environment in one form or
another as needed. Even computer-based “expert systems,”
software that are expert in a particular domain such as seismic
signal analysis, financial data analysis, voice recognition, game
playing, and the like, depend on humans. All such expert
systems depend on their internal programming and semantic
data files, which are created by humans who encode the
necessary abstract relationships. That’s why computers with
learning algorithms and software are limited in their learning to
their specific domains initially encoded by humans. They cannot
break out into other unrelated domains and apply what they
learn. Many expert systems learn and improve over time. For
example, a voice recognition system can learn to understand a
new human accent not specifically programmed before. But
they are limited in their learning and application to human
speech variations, not stock market variations. Such learning
can be transferred to other domains but only by human
mediators who adapt them.

But, what does it mean to understand? Understanding
complex relationships is so second nature to humans that we
forget it is more than mere perception or sensing of an object
or action. Perhaps it is easier to start with an example. We learn
the concept, dynamics, and value of teamwork when we play
soccer. But we only truly understand it when we can apply the
same concepts and dynamics in a project or in our jobs, which
are totally unrelated in practice and purpose to playing soccer.

Figure 9: A force Type Tree with disjoint sub-types connected

only through abstract relationships.

More formally, understanding means the ability to apply
relationships learned from a source sub-type (or sub-category)
in a Type Tree (or general category) to a target sub-type that
has no physical connection to or relationship with the source
sub-type. This definition is less obscure and esoteric than it
appears. Once we understand what it means then we recognize
how ubiquitous and common it actually is in everyday life.

Figure 9, above, depicts the concept of understanding using
another example. The Type Tree shown is for the concept of
abstract force and its many incarnations placed in the category
of force. If we define the root type as the most abstract
concept of force having the attributes of magnitude (or
quantity), direction, and ability to effect change, then all other
sub-categories or sub-types of force include these three
attributes plus additional ones. For example, the force of
gravity has a magnitude (weight), a direction (downwards or
towards earth), and the ability to change things (break a falling

china cup). The force of gravity has the additional attribute of
being a function of the mass of the earth and the bodies close
to it in a way that the force of a spring isn’t. In the example
Type Tree of Figure 9, one sub-category of force is muscle
force, which is essentially created by molecular action of
proteins that chemically combine to shorten the physical length
of muscle fibers, thus contracting them. This is a physical force
that everybody is familiar with its use. Another sub-type,
totally and entirely different in apparent nature and having no
relation to muscle force whatsoever, is the economic force.
Yet, everybody recognizes the metaphor of economic “force”
and its validity instantly and effortlessly. This is because we
recognize that economic force has the three attributes of the
abstract force (magnitude, direction, ability to effect change)
plus additional attributes specific to the economic force, such
as the many financial concepts like interest rate and marginal
cost.

We say we understand the concept of force because we can
successfully apply it to many physically disjoint and unrelated
applications, such as the economic force. This is not the case
for computers. Even if computers were attached to sensors like
cameras and networked to all databases in the world with
unimaginable amounts of data, they would fail in understanding
anything. As a matter of fact, computers today do have access
to such sensors and data, but they only operate in the domains
in which they were designed to operate. They simply are not
equipped to and cannot bridge the rational gap. And of course,
all the data in various databases have been designed and the
knowledge contained in them have been encoded by humans.
We must bear in mind that the construction of a Type Tree,
which was used to explain the meaning of understanding, is also
an abstract concept that only humans can do. We can enlist the
help of computers in this respect, but only if we encode the
abstract concepts for them.

Understanding is relative. We can understand things in
degrees and in all likelihood there is no end to the depth of

170                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 16

understanding of something because the Type Tree can have an
arbitrary depth and breadth. Hence, we can apply our
understanding to farther and farther regions of the tree,
deepening our understanding. For example, the concept of
force may be applied to a new and different context with its
own additional characteristics, such as power of faith,
psychological force, political force, and the like, each providing
a deeper understanding of the concept of force. Relativity of
understanding, however, does not change its nature, namely
that it is achieved through seeing and traversing the rational
relationships in the model of reality. It is like crossing vast
divides between different concepts in the physical world using
the invisible bridges of rational and abstract relationships.
These invisible bridges are only visible to the human soul, not
computers or animals.

The inability of computers to see rational relationships and
understand them really extends much further and deeper than
the analytical picture presented above implies. However,
examining this extension is beyond the scope of this paper save
a brief mention. With reference to Figure 8, the kingdoms that
define the basic categories of creation, computers belong to the
Mineral Kingdom, and are literally inferior to and dumber than
a mosquito, let alone a human. Even more specifically,
emotions, which are fundamental properties of living
organisms, play an integral role in intelligence. Emotions create
purpose in life, human or animal, and drive the search for new
knowledge or new experience. Without emotions, one could ask
“what is the motivation for seeking new knowledge?” In the
absence of motivation, the very quest and search for
knowledge, even if programmed in a computer to automatically
and perpetually perform, reduces to a mindless, purposeless,
and mechanical process of information acquisition and any
innate value or meaning assignable to knowledge is stripped
away. This mechanical process would be like one of those old
toy cars that blindly moved until it hit an object, like a table
leg, and then backed up and turned and went in another

direction until it hit another object. At the end, nothing is
achieved and no more meaning can be assigned to this search
for knowledge than to the tumbling of an uprooted weed
randomly driven by the desert wind.

But the answer to the question in the header of this section,
“can machines think?” is technically “yes.” This is because we
defined thinking as the process of traversing the graph in the
space model of reality (Figure 2) and machines can do that, but
only with respect to the physical relationships, not the rational
ones. For example a computer connected to a camera can detect
an image and track it across the screen or recognize it as a
particular object, a human face, a fingerprint, and the like. All
of these are based on physical data or abstract information
encoded by humans. So, machines can “think” in a mechanical
sense (i.e., no emotional impetus or meaning) and within the
bounded subset of reality limited to physical relationships only.

Immortality of the Soul

The existence of the soul is one question, and its immortality
another. Abdu’l-Bahá treats the subject of the human soul in
Some Answered Questions the same way. He first proves its
existence and then explains its immortality. He states: “Having
shown that the spirit of man exists, we must prove its
immortality.” [SAQ 223]

Abdu’l-Bahá uses a number of proofs of immortality of soul,
some of which are based on the same concepts he uses to prove
its existence, such as independence of human spirit from his
physical body and its ailments, revelations during sleep, its
influence in this world after death, and others. [SAQ 223-229]
Furthermore, Abdu’l-Bahá explains:

> The whole physical creation is perishable. These material
> bodies are composed of atoms; when these atoms begin
> to separate decomposition sets in, then comes what we
> call death. This composition of atoms, which constitutes
172                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 16

> the body or mortal element of any created being, is
> temporary. When the power of attraction, which holds
> these atoms together, is withdrawn, the body, as such,
> ceases to exist.

> With the soul it is different. The soul is not a
> combination of elements, it is not composed of many
> atoms, it is of one indivisible substance and therefore
> eternal. It is entirely out of the order of the physical
> creation; it is immortal! [PT 89]

In this passage Abdu’l-Bahá explains that the soul is
immortal because death is nothing but decomposition and the
soul is not composed of anything and is, therefore, immortal.

In the context of this paper, we present a proof of the
immortality of the soul, which is related but not identical to
Abdu’l-Bahá’s explanations. In this context, the rational
relationships were defined as being in the spiritual domain and
as being sensible by the soul because it is in the same domain.
The rational relationships were also defined as not being bound
by time and space, which implies that the spiritual realm and the
soul are also not so bound.

Now, what does immortality mean? Immortality has an
inherent time element. Something is immortal only if it lasts
forever, that is, for all time. But what happens if time is not a
factor that affects an entity, say, the human soul? Then that
entity will not change over time, and hence, by definition, is
immortal.

Conclusion

Despite popular conceptions of spirituality as an emotional
state, spirituality has more to do with rational thinking than
emotions, at least directly. A relationship between two entities
is defined as the overlap between the sets that represent the
entities, and may be classified as rational or physical. Rational

relationships have no physical existence and are not bound by
time and space that mainly characterize the physical world.
Based on the model of reality as an object-relationship space,
the model of thinking as the ability to traverse the relationships
in this space, and the model of general intelligence as the ability
to traverse rational relationships, it is concluded that no
physical system, including the human brain, can have general
intelligence. No physical system can sense or understand a
rational relationship. This is because a physical system has no
overlap with a non-physical entity, and thus, cannot possibly
sense or understand it. Hence, only a non-physical system can
sense and understand rational relationships. We call this non-
physical system the soul and we call the realm it belongs to the
spiritual realm.

The computers are no exception to the rule requiring a non-
physical entity to perceive rational relationships. But the
situation is more complicated because they do process rational
information. The key to resolving this apparent contradiction is
to recognize the difference between representation and
understanding. The former is the encoding of information,
while the latter is the ability to apply knowledge gained in one
area to another unrelated area. Computers can only process
representations of rational relationships encoded by humans.
They are bereft of understanding such relationships
independently.

Immortality of the soul is also established by the realization
that the soul resides in the spiritual domain, which is outside
the influence of time and space, and thus, is unaffected by
time.
