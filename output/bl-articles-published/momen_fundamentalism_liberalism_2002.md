The upsurge of fundamentalism that has occurred in many different religions and countries of
the world has gained a great deal of attention in recent years. Disagreements between funda-
mentalists and liberals appear to affect almost every religious community to one extent or an-
other. This paper explores a number of questions related to this phenomenon. Are the various
social movements popularly called fundamentalism in different cultural contexts all truly differ-
ent expressions of the same social phenomenon? What are the features distinguishing funda-
mentalism from its putative counterpart, liberalism? Can we distinguish any underlying basis
for the fundamentalism/liberalism dichotomy?

Some may prefer to use the term “traditionalist” or “conservative” rather than “funda-
mentalist”. I have preferred not to use “traditionalist” because this would seem to exclude those
fundamentalists, such as most Protestant groups, who tend to be radical and opposed to tradi-
tion. I am aware of the counter-argument that the term “fundamentalist” has historically been
closely identified with radical Protestantism and may therefore seem to some to be inappropri-
ate in a more general context. Overall, it seems to me that the term “fundamentalist” is now, in
popular terms being used in a more general way about other religions and is therefore the more
suitable word.1

Although the word fundamentalism date from the publication of a series of radical
Protestant pamphlets, The Fundamentals, in the United States in 1910 to 1915, the phenomenon
has a long history in religion. It is a mistake to see fundamentalism as a reaction to modernity
and thus limit its occurrence to modern times (although it must be admitted that modernity has
brought fundamentalism very much to the fore). Nor indeed should fundamentalism be limited

The Phenomenon of Religion.
W. Shepard, “‘Fundamentalism’ Christian and Islamic”, Religion, Vol. 17 (1987) pp. 355-78; and “Is-
lam and Ideology: Towards a Typology”, International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 19 (1987)
pp. 307-36, suggests the term “rejectionist neo-traditionalist.” One feels, however, that what-ever ad-
vantage such a term may have is more than counter-balanced by its unwieldiness.

to Christianity or even to the western religions.2 As fundamentalism and liberalism are defined
in this paper, the split can be seen to have been operating at many times in the histories of dif-
ferent religions. In the Islamic world, for example, we can see elements of it in the Ash’ari-
Mu’tazili disputes in ‘Abbasid Empire in the ninth century; in the dispute between the philoso-
pher-mystics and the orthodox jurists in Safavid Iran during the sixteenth and seventeenth cen-
tury; in the opposition to Sufism and “religious laxity” by such persons as Ibn Taymiyya (d.
1328) and Ibn ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab (d. 1787); as well as in the upheavals of the present-day Islamic
world.3

The original definitions of fundamentalism made by writers such as Niebuhr included
what has since become the stereotype of the popular view of fundamentalists: that they take the
words of their Holy Scripture literally and are opposed to science. This is a view that dates back
to the time when Christian fundamentalists were trying to fight the implications of Darwinian
evolutionary theory.4 However, as with all stereotypes, it has become less and less valid as the
years have passed. Fundamentalists have changed and adapted since that time. They no longer
oppose science, and indeed take great pride in the extent that they can advance scientific proof
for their positions, nor are they strictly bound to a literal interpretation of the Bible.

I will here try to present the main features of fundamentalism and liberalism and where
they differ. Of course, in order to show up the differences, it has been necessary to depict the
extremes of the two positions. I may characterise the differences as follows:

The Scriptures
Fundamentalist looks to the scriptures of their religion as absolute and unchanging truth. The
first concern of the fundamentalist is to establish that the Holy Scripture is “the word of God”.
Therefore, it is impossible that there be any error in it. All laws and commandments in these
texts are to be applied inflexibly and to the letter. Even religions that have no concept of a

Caplan, ed., Studies in Religious Fundamentalism (London: MacMillan, 1987) and Marty and Applebly,
Fundamentalisms Observed (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1991).

1966); M. Momen, Introduction to Shi’i Islam (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1985) pp. 115-16.
See also, E. Sandeen, The Roots of Fundamentalism (Chicago University Press, 1970). Sandeen has
shown how the fundamentalist movement in the early twentieth century grew out of, and represents the
continuation of the concerns of, the millenarianism of the nineteenth century.

\[4\] It particularly relates to the “Monkey Trial” in Dayton, Tennessee in which J. T. Scopes, a teacher, was
prosecuted for teaching the theory of evolution. The definition seems to have been first formally ad-
vanced by H. Richard Niebuhr in “Fundamentalism,” Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences (London:
MacMillan, 1931) pp. 526-27.

Scripture revealed by God—Theravada Buddhism, for example—may nevertheless have a simi-
lar attitude towards their Scriptures. 5 The liberal looks to the Holy Scripture of his or her reli-
gion more as a source of guidance for how to lead one’s life. As such, the liberal accepts that
the meaning, the “truth”, of the scriptures may change as the circumstances of the individual
and society change, i.e. it is a relative, rather than an absolute, truth.

However, the usual idea of the fundamentalist’s literal understanding of the Scripture re-
quires some degree of elaboration. Where the text is clearly meant to be symbolic, in the para-
bles of Christ for example, even the most extreme fundamentalist does not, of course, believe
that these parables actually occurred physically. In addition, where there are inconsistencies in
the text, the more sophisticated fundamentalist (the fundamentalist scholar for example) is will-
ing to allow for symbolic or other interpretations. But the important point is that the fundamen-
talist always regards the Bible as referring to real existent situations and facts. The main criteri-
on for scriptural truth is correspondence with empirical reality. For example, even if heaven and
hell are acknowledged not to be physical places above and below the earth, these two words
nevertheless do refer to existent realities. Barr has pointed out that the importance of preserving
the first principle, the inerrancy of the text, will often compel the fundamentalist to relax the se-
cond principle and allow some degree of non-literal interpretation.6 The liberal, on the other
hand, is prepared to see other types of truth—typological, metaphorical or mythological—in the
Scripture. The truth lies in the significance of the statement rather than its correspondence with
any external actuality.7

The principal concern of the fundamentalist appears to be to extract an exact meaning
from the text of the Scriptures. The millenialists of the mid-nineteenth century were certain that
their calculations pointed to the return of Christ in 1843 or 1844. When the “Great Disappoint-
ment” occurred and there was no literal fulfilment of their expectations, the group that became
the Seventh-Day Adventists resolved the problem by formulating an explanation that the proph-
ecy had been fulfilled but that on that date, Christ had entered the Most Holy of the heavenly
sanctuary, and that he had a work to perform there before coming to earth. This is a clearly non-
literal explanation of a prophecy that most other Christian denominations expect to occur liter-
ally and on earth. The Seventh-Day Adventists are nevertheless a fundamentalist denomina-
tion.8 Their interpretation of the “Great Disappointment” has the ability to give an exact mean-
ing to the Scripture when a literal meaning has been ruled out in their history. Another instruc-
tive example relates to the question of Noah’s flood. Some Christian fundamentalist scholars
are willing to accept that this may have been a local flood in Mesopotamia rather than a world

ground of Christianity.

flood (which the literal text would imply), as this would be less problematical scientifically.

Nevertheless, the story of the flood does, for these scholars, refer to an actual physical event—
any non-physical interpretation is ruled out.

Much modern Christian fundamentalist literature is taken up with detailed explanations
of how the events of the Bible can be explained scientifically. Scientific explanations are desir-
able as they are considered to provide a guarantee of certainty and exactness of interpretation.
The liberal, however, is willing to allow that the texts of the books are open to more than one
interpretation. External factors in society may influence the way that the Scriptures are inter-
preted. Allegorical and symbolic interpretations may be used particularly of passages that ap-
pear to contradict human reason. Traditional interpretation may be examined for whatever use-
ful insights it may present but has no binding force on the present.

The liberal is much more willing to acknowledge that the Holy Scripture is a historical
document. This often means that it has been written down by fallible men sometimes many
years after the events portrayed. Therefore almost certainly errors and myth-making have crept
in; almost certainly theological ideas current at the time of writing have been read back into the
past. If the fundamentalist does accept the historical nature of the Scriptures, he will insist that
they were divinely protected from the intrusion of alteration or error. Certainly no external fac-
tors, such as the social conditions at the time that the Scripture was written down, can be al-
lowed to influence the understanding of the texts. Another characteristic fundamentalist attitude
is that the whole of the scripture stands or falls together. This view maintains that since the
scripture is the word of God and therefore infallible, the inerrancy of every single sentence of
the Scripture must be maintained. Otherwise, the slightest error in even the smallest part casts
doubt on the whole. The liberal will, on the other hand, be much more willing to accept that
parts of the scripture are more “true”—in the sense of being more likely to have actually oc-
curred physically—than other parts.

Another way of expressing the difference between fundamentalists and liberals would be
to say that for fundamentalists the meaning of the Scripture is inherent in the text and can be
apprehended directly without interpretation, while for the liberal, the Scripture is something that
must be applied to one’s life, i.e. it must be interpreted in accordance with the context in which
it is being applied.9

Religious Traditions
The traditions of the religion are looked at differently by different types of fundamentalists. In
this paper, I propose to describe two types, although others have identified additional sub-
groups.10 The first group of fundamentalists are conservative and traditionalist. These regard

\[9\] Bruce, Firm in the Faith, pp. 186-93.

\[10\] I have here sub-divided fundamentalists into two groups, traditionalists and radicals, while keeping
liberals as one group. Other writers have created even more sub-divisions. See for example Shepard

tradition as an element in the religion that is as authoritative as the Scriptures themselves. In
Christianity, there is very little in the Bible to act as a basis for most of the Church structure and
ritual, and therefore the major source of authority for this is tradition.11 In Islam, the concept of
the sunna, the deeds and words of Muhammad as the perfect example for all Muslims to follow,
and the doctrine of ijm‘a, the concept that whatever the whole of the Muslim world agrees upon
as a consensus view must be correct, act as powerful forces for maintaining traditional attitudes
and positions. If any of the religion’s structures or doctrines seem to be in conflict with society
then it is society that must change to conform with what is perceived to be the Divine. These
fundamentalists are very concerned with building up bodies of doctrine and dogmatic state-
ments as well as elaborating the Holy Law and its provisions. This enables the true believer to
be sorted out from the waverer and the potential heretic. Doctrines and dogmas must, like Holy
Scripture, be understood literally, while the Holy Law must be followed to the letter.

The second group of fundamentalists are of the evangelical, radical, revivalist type. The-
se regard the traditions of the religion as the main obstacle to a return to the “pure” original re-
ligion which they consider can be reconstructed from the texts of the Holy Scripture. They
would like to see all traditional structures swept aside in favour of the Scriptures themselves.

Radical and traditionalist fundamentalists only differ in the boundary of what they con-
sider to be unalterable and inerrant—the radicals place the boundary around just the Scriptures
while the traditionalists extend this to the traditions of the religion also. Whether fundamental-
ists are of one type or the other appears to depend on the basic tendency of their religious back-
ground. Thus, for example, a religious background that stresses tradition seems to produce fun-
damentalists mainly of the traditionalist kind. In the Christian world, Roman Catholicism holds
that the traditions of the Church are of equal authority to the scripture12 and the fundamentalists
among the Catholics tend to be traditionalist. At the extreme of the fundamentalist wing among
the Catholics we find the followers of ultra-traditionalist Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre.13 Radi-
cal fundamentalists in the Christian world are to be found among the Protestant sects, Protes-
tantism being a movement that arose as a reaction to the traditionalism of Catholicism. In the
Muslim world, most fundamentalists are traditionalist since Islam is a religion in which tradi-

divisions. See also Smart’s classification in Religion and the Western Mina (Basingstoke: MacMillan,
1987) pp. 52-53.

\[11\] Although, of course, many Protestant Churches, especially the Calvinists, tried to base the whole of
their church structure and ritual on the Bible.

\[12\] This has been the official Catholic position since the Council of Trento (1563). The Orthodox Church
also has a high regard for its traditions.

Mass. He claimed to have had several million followers and sympathizers among Roman Catholics, es-
pecially in France.

tion plays an important part, but there are a few modern radical groups—for example, the fol-
lowers of Rashad Khalifa14 and of ‘Ali Shari’ati in Iran.15

Mutual recriminations
Fundamentalists tend to blame liberals for allowing into the religion dubious ideas and doc-
trines which have no basis in the religion itself but are accommodations to the secular world,
the intrusion of secular views or ideas from other religions. In the context of the modern world,
a good example is the liberation theology which originated in Latin America and which funda-
mentalists regard as being no more than a back-door method for introducing Marxism into
Christianity. Similarly, fundamentalists tend to blame liberalism for a moral laxity in society in
general.

A more basic criticism levelled by fundamentalists at liberals concerns the arbitrary na-
ture of those parts of the Scriptures that liberals regard as being the religious core, and therefore
to be preserved, and those parts that are culturally determined, and therefore can be dispensed
with or interpreted liberally. From a fundamentalist viewpoint it appears that the line dividing
the two is not defined by any discernible logical rules but rather by whatever happens to be the
current social fashion. In one decade, feminism is to the fore and so the liberals dispense with
those parts of the Scripture which seem to give a low status to women; the next, championing
gay rights is fashionable and so the liberals jettison that part of the Scripture too. Are fashion
and current secular sensibilities to be the arbiters of the stand-point of faith? If so will the inevi-
table result not be to jettison everything eventually?16

Liberals consider that the harsh, intolerant attitudes of the fundamentalists are both con-
trary to the true spirit of religion and doing religion a great deal of harm in the modern world.
The liberal tends to see the traditions and structures of the religion in relation to society and is
always asking the question: does the religious tradition and structure serve the needs of society?
If any part of religious structure or doctrine is not relevant to society, then it is necessary to see
how it can be adapted in order to become relevant. The traditions, doctrines and dogmas of the
religion, as well as the Holy Law, are all guidelines for action that can be interpreted according
to circumstances.

\[14\] Rashad Khalifa put the Qur’an into a computer and discovered that the entire book revolves around
the number nineteen and its multiples. He regarded this a proof of the miraculous nature of the book and
asserted that Islam should be based on the Qur’an alone with a downgrading of the traditions. This has
been strongly advocated by proponents of his ideas in countries as far apart as the USA, Egypt, and Ma-
laysia.

\[15\] Shari’ati, during the period just prior to the 1979 Revolution in Iran, advocated a return to Islam. By
this he did not intend the traditionalist Islam of the ulama but rather a radical reinterpretation which he
considered to be the original Shi’i Islam.

\[16\] See S. Akhtar, “The Virtues of Fundamentalism,” Scottish Journal of Religious Studies, Vol. 10
(1989) pp. 41-49; P. Berger, The Heretical Imperative (London: Collins, 1980) pp. 116, 118.

Attitude to religious diversity within the religion
The fundamentalist is intolerant of wide divergences of religious expression within his or her
own religion. All divergence from the main orthodox tradition is suspect. There is an ever-
present prospect of heresy insidiously creeping in under various seemingly-innocent guises. The
religion must be protected from it at all costs. The history of religion points to numerous epi-
sodes in which much suffering and bloodshed has been caused by those wishing to impose a
narrow interpretation of their religion on their fellow-believers. In Christianity, this was seen in
the past in the Inquisition and the numerous bloody suppressions of heresies. It also operates in
the present.17 In Islam, there have been periodic persecutions of marginal sects as well as such
groups as Sufis.18

The liberal will tolerate the existence within the community of a wide variety of view-
points. As long as a viewpoint does not explicitly deny the veracity of the Prophet/Founder or
the Holy Scripture, it can usually be accommodated within the community of believers. Even if
a viewpoint is considered too extreme to be acceptable, the preferred method for trying to coun-
ter it will be argument and persuasion rather than compulsion.

Attitude towards religious pluralism
The fundamentalist sees other religions as being the result of error. Since they are in open com-
petition with the true religion, the usual response is to regard them as the work of the devil, to
be strongly opposed to and even persecute them if necessary. The only possible exception to
this is those religions which the Prophet/Founder himself showed respect towards—these must,
by definition, be religions that preceded the Prophet/Founder. Thus, for example fundamentalist
Christians will tolerate Judaism but reject Islam; fundamentalist Muslims will tolerate Judaism
and Christianity but reject the Bahá’í Faith. But even this toleration wears thin at times and
merges into persecution—as witnessed by past persecutions of Jews by Christians, and Jews and
Christians by Muslims. A related phenomenon in modern times is the linking of a xenophobic
fundamentalism to a strident nationalism in many parts of the world. This can be seen in Arya
Samaj Hinduism in India, in some forms of Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism in Japan,19 among Sin-

\[17\] See also Barr, Fundamentalism, pp. 316-17, for a reference to the manner in which fundamentalist co-
erciveness operates today in the Christian world.

halese Buddhist supporters of the Sri Lankan Freedom Party,20 in the Gush Emunim movement
in Israel,21 and in the Moral Majority in fundamentalist Christianity in the United States.22

The fundamentalist’s conviction of possessing the truth leads to a strong tendency to try
to correct the errors of the unbelievers. Thus, the inter- religious activity of the fundamentalist
is typically evangelism and missionary work. The inter-religious activity of the liberal, on the
other hand, tends towards ecumenicism and inter-faith dialogue. The fundamentalist has no time
for such activities. Since his own religion already possesses the absolute truth, there is no point
in looking elsewhere for it. The liberal will look to other religions as alternative views of reli-
gious truth. Many liberals will give their own religion some form of priority. An example is the
Catholic theologian Rahner’s concept that truly religious persons of other religions are “anony-
mous Christians”.23 Nevertheless, they are willing to admit some legitimacy and “truth” in other
religions. Other liberals are willing to go even further and regard other religions as being of
equal validity as their own but, perhaps, more suited to their own cultures.24 A liberal society
such as Muslim Spain in the medieval period, allows the efflorescence of intellectual and artis-
tic excellence from whatever quarter, Christian, Jewish or Muslim.

Social and political differences
With regard to social and political differences, we are treading on the most difficult ground in
our enquiry. This is because there appears to have been some degree of change in the modern
period, compared to the characteristic features of these groups in former times. Historically,
there does not appear to have been any characteristic political stance from either fundamental-
ists or liberals. If anything, both parties often tended to political quietism. Socially the majority
of fundamentalists have tended to be isolated either by forming separate communities, such as
the Hutterites in North America, or by minimising contact with the rest of the society through
associating as much as possible only with fellow fundamentalists (fundamentalist trade and vo-
cational associations, clubs, colleges, holiday centres, etc.). Personal asceticism and rejection of
wealth characterised many fundamentalists, while liberal views were often found among the
wealthy. Recently, much of this has greatly changed. Both sides have taken on characteristic

Pluralism (London: MacMillan, 1985).

political attitudes and fundamentalists have left their social isolation and entered social and po-
litical life in every part of the world.

During the modern period, fundamentalists have tended to be found at the right of the
political spectrum,25 encouraging individual self-reliance, and stressing such social teachings of
religion as justice. Some fundamentalist groups have even reversed the previous trend by tend-
ing to adopt a positive, encouraging attitude towards the accumulation of wealth. These groups
have become actively involved in politics, advocating capitalism and a laissez-faire social phi-
losophy while raising communism to an almost mythological level of evil. The best known ex-
ample of this is the Moral Majority movement in the U.S.A., which contributed to Ronald
Reagan’s electoral success.26 An important social and political feature of fundamentalism is the
tendency to promote a traditional role for women in society , i.e. confinement to home and chil-
dren rather than coming out to work and taking a political role. This tendency to try to control
women applies as much to Christian fundamentalism in the U.S.A., where the Moral Majority
campaigned against the Equal Rights for Women Amendment , as it does in the Islamic and
Jewish world.27 27

Liberals, on the other hand, have politically tended to the left in modern times, due to
their concern with social issues. Some groups have even engaged in Christian-Marxist dialogue.
They tend to stress such religious teachings as showing love towards one’s fellow human be-
ings. They have also reversed their previous tendency and are now inclined towards asceticism
and have a negative attitude towards the accumulation of wealth. They are supportive of the
emancipation of women.

The extreme wing of fundamentalism holds the view that existing political structures,
because they are products of man’s thinking and efforts rather than divine revelation, should be
overthrown in favour of a political structure based on the Holy Scripture. Khomeini advocated
such a programme and the Iranian Revolution of 1979 was intended to inaugurate such a theoc-
racy.28 It should not be thought, however, that it is only in Islam that such positions are being
advocated. In Christianity, there are groups such as the Christian Reconstructionists in the Unit-
ed States which, under the leadership of Rousas J. Rushdoomy, advocates an overthrow of
democratic institutions in order to establish a theocracy under Biblical Law. In Israel and India
there are several extreme Jewish and Hindu religious parties that advocate a similar position.

\[25\] During the nineteenth century, however, a fundamentalist position was not incompatible with social
reformism. See Bruce, Firm in the Faith, pp. 12-13, 147. But see below for a possible reason for this.

\[26\] Bruce, “The Moral Majority.”

\[27\] See Caplan, Studies in Religious Fundamentalism, pp. 18-19; Bruce, Firm in the Faith, p. 155.

\[28\] It should be noted that, in practice, Khomeini had to retreat from the theoretical positions advocated in
his writings, and Iran still possesses many of the political institutions derived from the Western political
systems that Khomeini so despised.

Bruce has pointed out that the social manifestations of fundamentalism and liberalism
are, to a large extent, a consequence of their doctrinal or ideological positions. The fundamen-
talist rejection of all doctrinal positions outside their own leads to highly demarcated, tightly
knit, highly committed, socially isolated communities. Liberals, on the other hand, consider the
beliefs of the rest of the world sympathetically and are socially much more integrated. The great
diversity of beliefs amongst them, however, hinders the formation of coherent groups and also
reduces the possibility of a high degree of commitment.29

Towards a definition of Fundamentalism
Put succinctly, we may characterise the fundamentalist as having turned inwards to the centre of
the religion—the Scripture, doctrines and traditions—and seeking to protect these from the in-
trusions of the modern, secular world, while the liberal has turned outwards, seeking to break
down the barriers between the religious world and the secular world. For the fundamentalist, the
secular world must adapt to and come under the control of the religious world, while the liberal
considers it the job of the religious world to adapt to and become relevant in the secular world.
For the fundamentalist, religion is addressed to the individual and individual salvation comes
first; social salvation and ordering may then result from a collectivity of individual salvations.
Liberals, on the other hand, are primarily concerned with society as a whole. Religion is for so-
cial salvation; individual salvation is best achieved within an enlightened society. To strive for
individual salvation when society itself is not saved is egotistical and reprehensible.

The differences described above between fundamentalists and liberals have purposely
been wide-ranging because the same phenomenon re-appears in slightly different ways among
the different religions. None of these differences is sufficient by itself to identify an individual
as a fundamentalist or a liberal. With Hinduism and Buddhism, for example, the inerrancy of
Scripture is not an important issue. On the other hand, among Muslims almost all believe in the
inerrancy of their Scripture, the Qur’an, but this does not make them all fundamentalists. To
differentiate between fundamentalists and liberals in the Hindu, Buddhist and Muslim worlds,
one must go to the sphere of social relations and examine the attitude towards modernity and re-
ligious diversity. This may also account for the phenomenon that, in the nineteenth century,
when an uncritical acceptance of the inerrancy of the Bible was much more in the main stream
of Christianity (i.e. a similar situation to Islam today), it was possible for individuals to hold to
Biblical inerrancy while at the same time advocating liberal social principles.3030 It would ap-
pear that our ideas about fundamentalism and liberalism should be sufficiently flexible to allow
for such individuals not to be classed as fundamentalists.

Thus the arguments presented in this paper appear to be moving towards a position
wherein fundamentalism and liberalism are defined not in any absolute terms but in terms that
are relative to the particular situation of the individual religiously and in time. In other words,

\[29\] Bruce, Firm in the Faith, pp. 78-89.

\[30\] See note above.

fundamentalism and liberalism must be identified through a pattern that changes from one reli-
gion to another (partly as a result of the different emphases within each religion) and also
changes with time. It would seem therefore that a satisfactory definition of fundamentalism or
liberalism at the social level can only be achieved on a multi-factorial basis.
Fundamentalism and Modernity
Although I have in the above presentation given examples of the way that liberalism and fun-
damentalism have manifested themselves in the past, it should be borne in mind that the con-
trast between the two has been emphasised and brought into stark relief only in modern times.
This is for three reasons.31 First, in most of the world until the present century and in the West
until the Age of Enlightenment, the religious and secular worlds were not sharply defined and
separated. Religious metaphysical assumptions and ethical values pervaded all aspects of socie-
ty: family life, social mores and customs, intellectual life and politics. Therefore, there was not
so much opportunity for the secular world to challenge the religious. Second, we can postulate
that the complexities of modern life and the mass of problems that face mankind (the nuclear
threat, drug/alcohol problems, environmental threats, the North-South divide, etc. which are
brought to the immediate attention of all through modern means of communications) have in-
duced great uncertainty and anxiety. One response to the fear induced by this state is to retreat
into the greater certainty offered by fundamentalism. It presents a retreat from the confused
maelstrom of modernity. Third, until the nineteenth century, the religious world was not so
acutely challenged by genuine competition from other religions. At that time, the colonial pow-
ers took Christianity to every part of the world, while during the present century, we have seen
an increasing flow in the opposite direction, both as a result of migration and of missionary ac-
tivity by Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims, etc.

Therefore previously, the fundamentalist was rarely challenged with intrusions into the
religious world while the liberal had only occasional opportunities for seeking to adapt the reli-
gious world to new external circumstances. Thus it has been the phenomenon of secularisation
and religious pluralism in the modern world that has brought the liberal- fundamentalist split to
the fore of religious life. In country after country, the arrival of modernity resulted in a tradi-
tionalist fundamentalist backlash. In the United States, the challenge laid down by modern sci-
ence, and the theory of evolution in particular, was one of the most important factors leading to
the rise of fundamentalism. In Iran, in the early years of the twentieth century, the liberal re-
forms advocated by the Constitutionalists were opposed by the fundamentalist traditionalist
‘ulama led by Shaykh Fadlu’llah Nuri.32

It is perhaps in India that we find the best example of this pattern. Under attack from the
Christianity of the colonial power as well as the challenge of Western science, a number of lib-
eral reform movements arose among India’s Hindus in the nineteenth century—the Brahmo
Samaj founded by Rammohan Roy in 1828 and the very similar Prartharma Samaj. These
movements adopted many of the ideas of the Christian West into a Hindu framework. This de-
velopment produced two types of reaction among Hindus corresponding to the two types of
fundamentalism described above. The radical fundamentalists, such as Dayananda Saraswasti,
who founded the Arya Samaj in 1875, felt that Hinduism could best be revitalised by returning
to its Vedic roots. Thus they opposed the inclusivist social reform movements that accommo-
dated Christian Western ideas and rejected what they considered to be the accretions of ritual
and tradition (such as idol-worship) that had been added to “pure” Vedic Hinduism. Secondly,
there were traditionalist fundamentalists who rejected both the inclusivism of social reform
movements and the radicalism of the Arya Samaj and wanted to maintain Hinduism as it was
with all of its rituals, traditions and social structures, such as the caste system. They formed
themselves into numerous groups (such as the Sanatana Dharma Sabha) which came under an
umbrella organisation, the Bharata Dharma Mahamandala in 1902.33 33

Social and Intellectual Basis
Although little research has been done on the psychological and social bases of the fundamen-
talist-liberal dichotomy, those that have observed these categories are agreed that we must go
beyond the old view that fundamentalism represents an anti-scientific backlash of the old rural,
agriculturally-based communities against the urban, scientific culture. In the next few para-
graphs I shall review the evidence that, first, fundamentalism is not necessarily anti-scientific
and, second, the sociological observations tend to discount any significant social differences be-
tween fundamentalists and liberals.

Fundamentalist writers often go to great lengths to show that their positions are in ac-
cordance with science. However, critics would maintain that this is a veneer of pseudo-science
applied in order to increase the plausibility of the fundamentalist worldview34 and that funda-
mentalists remain inherently opposed to the inductive approach of the scientific method. 35
Among many fundamentalists there remains a strong advocacy of anti-evolutionary (anti-

\[23\] 
\[34\] Because science has become such an overwhelmingly important guarantor of plausibility, everyone
wants to think of themselves as being in line with it. On this factor of science and the plausibility of the
religious worldview, see P. Berger, Heretical Imperative, pp. 17-22, 105.

\[35\] It may also be said that although fundamentalists are not against the traditional Newtonian view of
science, there are much more substantial grounds for a conflict between modern relativistic science and
fundamentalist thought. But this issue has hardly yet been tackled by fundamentalist writers.

Darwinian) positions under the name of Creationism. However even this position bows to sci-
ence, in that it claims to use scientific method to prove its case. Indeed, religious critics of fun-
damentalism argue that by striving to adapt the Bible stories so that they conform to science, the
fundamentalist is in fact effectively adopting a materialistic stance and placing science above
God’s word.36 But whatever the strengths or weaknesses of fundamentalist science, it remains
true that fundamentalists no longer see themselves as intellectually opposed to science. Their
argument, as it has been re- formulated in recent decades, is at least with historical and literary
criticism.

Even outside the Christian West, where fundamentalism is often centred on a reaction to
the intrusion of modernity into traditional societies, the fundamentalists are not against science
and technology itself. They are quite happy to utilise these. Ayatu’llah Khomeini’s success in
overthrowing the Shah, for example, owed a great deal to the skill of his supporters in utilising
such modern inventions as the telephone and the cassette recorder to disseminate the Aya-
tu’llah’s speeches. What they are against are the alien values and morals (and in particular the
sceptical and critical approaches to religion) being imported along with the science and tech-
nology.

We may also state that there is no justification for the commonly held view that the fun-
damentalist is against logic and rationality. On the contrary, the fundamentalist mentality is
much predisposed to using very precise logical argumentation. Shi’i Islam is an interesting ex-
ample to consider further in this respect. Both the theology (kalam) and the jurisprudence of
Shi’i Islam are built on foundations of rationalism and logic. From the ninth century onwards,
Shi’i scholars have prided themselves on being able to derive their doctrine, as well as their le-
gal judgements from logic as well as from the traditions. Indeed, the study of logic forms an
important part of the academic curriculum at the religious colleges of Qumm and Najaf.37 This
then is the intellectual background of such persons as the Ayatu’llah Khomeini.

Also to be questioned is the view of fundamentalism as mainly a phenomenon of poor
rural areas. In fact both fundamentalists and liberals are likely to come from similar social and
educational backgrounds. Many modern fundamentalists appear to arise from educated middle
class backgrounds—precisely the same background from which the majority of liberals come.

This has been asserted for British fundamentalist groups,38 and for Americans.39 Similar conclu-
sions have also been drawn about the Muslim world whether in Egypt, Iran or West Africa40.40

It is as yet premature to dismiss social factors entirely but the evidence certainly does
not support a blanket association of fundamentalism with any particular social category or fac-
tor. These findings, if confirmed by further research, point to the likelihood that the fundamen-
talist-liberal difference comes not so much from social differences as from differences in psy-
chological types.

Psychological Basis
In psychological terms we may characterise fundamentalism and liberalism as two different
ways of thinking, two cognitive styles. Cognitive style refers to the individual’s characteristic
and consistent manner of organising and categorising perceptions and concepts. It is a value-
free term in that the variety of cognitive styles are not judged to be good or bad in themselves,
although any particular style may be more or less favourable in a given situation or for the pur-
pose of achieving a given goal.41 41

The fundamentalist mentality is characteristically one that sees things in terms of black-
and-white, in terms of clear-cut boundaries which determine what is and what is not acceptable
belief, who is and who is not in the community. Any person, situation or object belongs either
within the orbit of the “saved” or is outside it; there are no intermediate stations. No matter how
good a life a person may lead, if he or she is not among the “saved”, then he or she must be
among the “damned”. The lines between good and evil are clearly drawn and there are no in-
termediate positions. The liberal is more inclined to allow for “grey areas”, intermediate situa-

tions. Although a person may not be a believer, if his actions are good then he cannot be totally
bad. In pursuing this line of thought, we are gradually coming to the point at which it is possible
to see that the fundamentalist-liberal split is not something that affects religion alone but rather
is one facet of a much larger phenomenon in the psycho-social life of mankind.42

Another way of describing this would be to say that one of the underlying differences
between fundamentalists and liberals is that the former are driven by a desire for certainty. Hof-
stadter has called this the “one- hundred per cent mentality”. Such a person will “tolerate no
ambiguities, no equivocations, no reservations, and no criticism”.43 For the fundamentalist, cer-
tainty is only to be found in objectivity. The indecisive world of the liberal who is willing to see
some truth in all opinions, the uncertain field of historical and literary criticism where different
opinions abound, are all tainted by personal opinion, and therefore by subjectivity. This is deep-
ly unsatisfactory to the fundamentalist psyche. The only way of achieving objective truth is to
take a standard that lies outside of the human subjectivity. While a liberal Christian would be
happy to accept just a statement of belief in Christ from someone, this is not sufficient for a
fundamentalist. It is too liable to the whims of subjectivity. It might include all sorts of doctri-
nally objectionable positions. Acceptance of the Bible as inerrant, however, is considered by
fundamentalists to constitute objectivity, for one is not forming a personal view of the Bible but
rather accepting the Bible’s own view of itself. This, the fundamentalist considers, gives one a
standard of absolute truth44 and hence objectivity, and hence certainty.

This desire for certainty probably accounts for the enthusiastic adoption of scientific (or,
as their critics would maintain, pseudo-scientific) approaches by fundamentalists. Scientific
method acts, for the modern mind, as a guarantor of the correctness of one’s conclusions. It also
accounts for the fact that fundamentalists are often very keen on building up elaborate logical
arguments. The mathematical certainty of logic appeals to such minds. The fundamentalist fa-
vours absolutes while the liberal favours relativistic styles of thinking.

One cognitive style that has been described appears to be of particular interest with re-
gard to the fundamentalism-liberalism dichotomy. It is called “field-dependence versus field-
independence”. It relates to the way that an individual relates a figure in his or her perceptual
field to its background. Field-dependents tend to see the figure only in relation to its back-
ground while a field-independent tends to isolate the figure and extract it from its background.45

\[42\] It is easy to see how any point of view, such as communism or nationalism, that is strongly held by a
group of people can become the basis for the development of such a mentality. Barr, for example, hints
at parallels between fundamentalism and the Cultural Revolution in China, Fundamentalism, p. 327. The
Tappers point to similarities between fundamentalism and secular nationalism in Turkey, “Fundamental-
ism in a Turkish Town.”

There seems to be some provisional similarity here between field-dependence and liberalism (in
that liberals tend to see religion only in terms of its social background) and field- independence
and fundamentalism (in that fundamentalists tend to see religion as an absolute isolated from its
social background).

There are also some similarities between what psychologists call the convergent style of
thinking and fundamentalism while divergent thinking corresponds with liberalism. Convergent
thinking focuses down from the general to the particular, dissecting and analysing. It prizes ra-
tional, deductive thought and aims towards certainty. It tends to be found among certain types
of scientists and engineers in particular. Interestingly, we find that when scientists (especially
from the physical sciences) and engineers become religious, they often tend towards fundamen-
talist religion.46 Divergent thought, on the other hand, goes from the particular to the general,
integrating the particulars into a general picture. It prizes inductive, intuitive thinking and aims
towards inclusivity rather than certainty. It tends to predominate among artists and social scien-
tists. These two modes of thinking have, in experimental psychology, been linked to the two
halves of the brain. This paper is not the place to give a detailed account of the research leading
to these findings, but suffice it to say that evidence from patients who have had damage to the
brain or a division of the corpus callosum (which joins the two halves of the brain) have shown
that analytical, rational thought is associated with what is called the dominant or verbal (usually
left) hemisphere, while spatial and other non-verbal experiences as well as intuitive thought are
associated with the other.47

Although fundamentalism can be defined in terms of a particular cognitive style, there is
a problem as to which phenomenon causes which. Does a particular cognitive style cause a per-
son to be attracted to the fundamentalist worldview or does the ideology of fundamentalism and
the pressures of a fundamentalist community induce a particular cognitive style? This is proba-
bly a question of the chicken-and-egg variety that has no answer.

tionately large number of engineers among the leadership of the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood.

Fundamentalism, Liberalism and the Bahá’í Faith
What has all this to do with the Bahá’í Faith? It must be clear from the above that both funda-
mentalism and liberalism are wide-spread phenomena. They are part of peoples’ constitutional
make-up. While a cognitive style may not be as fixed a thing as the colour of one’s eyes, if it
changes, it only does so very slowly. Therefore if the Bahá’í Faith is to be truly a universal reli-
gion, it must be able to incorporate people of all types; not just all types of races, and cultures
but also all types of cognitive styles. The Bahá’í community has to be wide enough in its out-
reach and flexible enough in its workings to enable it to contain both types of person without
fragmenting into schisms and conflict. It cannot, however, be denied that the presence of fun-
damentalists and liberals does cause a certain amount of tension within the Bahá’í community.
There have been numerous episodes and situations known to the author of this article, and no
doubt to any other person who has been a Bahá’í for any length of lime, where this tension has
caused problems and even damage.

Historically, it could be said that the situation in the West in the time of ‘Abdu’1-Bahá
tended to favor the liberals. The cultic milieu out of which many Bahá’ís carne was a tradition
in which a very liberal interpretation of religion was inherent. However, there was also a fun-
damentalist tension present, possibly as a result of those who carne into the Bahá’í community
from a millennialist background—because they considered that Bahá’u’lláh had fulfilled the
prophecies of the Bible. During Shoghi Effendi’s time the balance swung in favor of the fun-
damentalists. Shoghi Effendi’s concentration in the early years of his ministry on building up
the Bahá’í administration would have tended to favor the tidy administrative mind of the fun-
damentalist. The concentration on missionary expansion in the later years of Shoghi Effendi’s
ministry would also have favored those with a fundamentalist stance—fundamentalists wish to
convert others to their view since they know that it is the correct view and there can be no other
truth. In more recent times, we may discern the beginnings of a new balance. The recent empha-
sis from the Universal House of Justice on qualitative goals, social and economic development,
and dialogue with other religions and organisations is likely to bring people of a more liberal
stance to the fore in the community.

Within the Bahá’í community, there are several factors that alleviate potential tensions
between those of a fundamentalist bent and those with leanings towards liberalism and that en-
courage dialogue between them. As the Bahá’í Faith is a young religion, it addresses many of
the features of the modern world which have caused so much pain and discord in other reli-
gions. Its scriptures already deal with most current issues in relevant ways. Since there are
scriptural endorsements of such matters as the equality of men and women and the abolition of
extremes of wealth and poverty, these matters cause few problems of principle—whatever prob-
lems they may cause are with regard to their implementation. The rigid desire to follow the text
of the scripture forces those in the Baha’i community who tend towards fundamentalism to
adopt what would in other religions be considered a liberal position on these questions. Thus
many of these issues, which cause much heart-searching and a fundamentalist/liberal spilt in

other religions, are the subject of clear pronouncements in the scriptures around which both
fundamentalists and liberals can unite.

Second, the main mechanism of public discourse and decision-making in the community
is consultation. Baha’u’llah has exhorted his community to “take counsel together in all mat-
ters.”48 The process is regarded as a spiritual responsibility, and it is a duty incumbent upon all
to ensure that virtues such as fairness, integrity, forbearance, respect, and courtesy are brought
to bear upon the process.49 To succeed completely in establishing consultation on such grounds
is of course difficult, but to strive towards it is incumbent upon the participants.

Third, the Baha’i Faith has no real dogma. There are a number of statements regarding
Baha’u’llah, his station and relation to previous prophets, as well as the concept of the Cove-
nant, which may be regarded as dogmatic positions—but these are in fact matters of establish-
ing authority rather than establishing theological doctrine. And whatever dogma one may con-
sider exists today in the Baha’i Faith, it is unlikely to increase, as there are no mechanisms for
establishing any new dogma. Baha’is are, and they remain Baha’is, not so much because they
share the theological positions of other Baha’is, but because of their common vision of the di-
rection that humanity is taking.

A fourth factor in the Baha’i Faith that helps in the dialogue between liberals and fun-
damentalists is the overriding command to unity in the Baha’i teachings. This imperative is
higher than all other considerations. Thus Shoghi Effendi, referring to a dispute that occurred in
Baha’u’llah’s lifetime that was typical of the sort of disagreement that occurs between funda-
mentalists and liberals, related: “During the days of Baha’u’llah some of the prominent teachers
of the Cause in Persia were divided as to the station of Baha’u’llah and at last wrote to Him for
arbitration. In answer Baha’u’llah said that if they were united both sides were right and if they
were divided both were wrong.”50 In summary then, being united is considered a higher truth in
the Baha’i Faith than being right. This has obvious implications for a dialogue between liberals
and fundamentalists. Whatever sincere disagreement there may be between the two sides, there
should be an overriding concern to maintain unity. This unity does not mean uniformity. In oth-
er words, individuals are entitled to hold different views, but these should not become the basis
of the creation of parties and platforms within the community. Indeed, the formation of such
factions is expressly forbidden and can result in administrative sanctions against individuals try-
ing to carry out any such program.

Closely connected to this teaching of unity in the Baha’i Faith is the concept of the Cov-
enant. This concept means that the primary focus of loyalty and unity in the Baha’i Faith is not

ing Trust, 2nd ed., 1988) no. 1350, p . 405.

towards any set of doctrines or dogmas—and these are, of course, the usual focus of disagree-
ment between fundamentalists and liberals. A Baha’i is free to hold whatever opinion she or he
pleases: “At the very root of the Cause lies the principle of the undoubted right of the individual
to self-expression, his freedom to declare his conscience and set forth his views.”5151 The source
of unity in the Baha’i Faith is a focus on and loyalty towards the designated center of the
Faith—at the present time this means the Universal House of Justice, which is an elected body.
That body was created by Baha’u’llah to administer the affairs of the Baha’i Faith and to make
rulings in any areas of law that are not covered in the writings of Baha’u’llah. It is not a body
that makes definitive rulings on theological and doctrinal matters. This means that Baha’is are
not asked to subscribe to a creed as a precondition of membership, but rather to express their
loyalty to a body, which administers the Baha’i community. They express their loyalty by sub-
mitting to the decisions of the Universal House of Justice, which are usually of an administra-
tive and functional nature rather than doctrinal or interpretative. This is a matter that again does
not divide fundamentalists and liberals: the fundamentalist because the provisions of the Cove-
nant are unequivocally laid down in the scripture; the liberals because they can see that only
through united action can the liberal social agenda of the Baha’i Faith be realized.

The net effect of these factors is to give both liberals and fundamentalists a large degree
of freedom to hold whatever views they wish and to voice their opinions. If they disagree with a
decision of their local or national administrative bodies, they are free to appeal this ultimately
to the highest level, the Universal House of Justice. If the decision of the Universal House of
Justice goes against them, they may, if they wish, continue to hold the opinion. What they may
not do, under the terms of the principle of unity and the doctrine of the Covenant, is to try ac-
tively to create a party for their opinion. In this way, the Baha’i Faith tries to maintain a wide
range of opinions and personalities within the community. Both liberal and fundamentalist
views can coexist within the community, both groups being united in their overriding aim, the
effort to promote the Baha’i message of peace and unity.
