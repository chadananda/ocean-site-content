            The Universality of the Church of the East:
How Persian was Persian Christianity?

Christopher Buck

Persian Christianity was perhaps the first great non-Roman form of
Christianity. The “Church of the East” was ecclesiastically “Persian” in
that it was, with minor exceptions, the officially recognized Church of the
Sasanian empire. The Church was politically “Persian” due to the role of
Sasanian kings in the eleven Synods from 410 to 775 C.E. The Church
was geographically “Persian” in that it was coextensive with, but not
limited to the orbit of the Sasanian empire. The Church of the East was
only secondarily “Persian” in terms of ethnicity. Yet the presence of eth-
nic Persians vividly illustrates why the Church of the East became the
world’s most successful missionary church until modern times.

Although the majority of Christians in the church are assumed to
have been ethnic Syrians, the Church of the East was once a universal,
multi-ethnic religion. As a witness to the universality of the Church of
the East in its heyday, it is probably the case that ethnic Persians formed
the most visible and important ethnic minority of Christianity in Persia.
This study will argue that the role of Iranian converts may have been far
more significant than has so far been realized. Discoveries of Nestorian
texts in Iranian languages (Middle Persian, Sogdian, New Persian) have
proven conclusively that Syriac was not the exclusive language of liturgy
and instruction in the Persian Church. In fact, part and parcel of the ex-
traordinary missionary success of the Church of the East derived from its
genius for adapting Christian worship to local vernaculars. Evidence of
this gift for effective indigenization may be seen in the both the Assyrian
and Chaldean services for the Feast of Epiphany, in which fragments
from a lost Persian Christian liturgy are preserved and recited to this
very day.

The importance of the Church of Persia has been diminished by the
fact that mainstream church history has, to date, been primarily

The Journal of the Assyrian Academic Society                          55
Eurocentric. This problem may be traced back to Eusebius of Caesarea (d.
c. 339 C.E.), who has traditionally been acclaimed as “the Father of
Church History” as it was he wrote the very first Ecclesiastical History.
Sebastian Brock observes that “Eusebius passes over the history of the
Church to the east of the Roman Empire in almost total silence” and
that, as a result, “the legacy of Eusebius’ model of a Church History has
had an insidious influence on his successors, ancient and modern, en-
couraging the emergence of the excessively Eurocentric view of Church
History that is generally current today.”1 Consider the significance of the
estimated size of West Syrian (Roman and Persian empires) and East
Syrian (Persian) Christianity prior to and during the initial period of Is-
lam. John Taylor, a historian of church history, notes: “For the first time
since the seventh century, when there were large numbers of Nestorian
and Syrian churches in parts of Asia, the majority of Christians in the
world [today] are not of European origin.”2 There is an implicit claim here
that Syrian Christians and their converts outnumbered European Chris-
tians. The relative historical neglect of Syriac Christianity is all the more
surprising, if Paulos Gregorios’ estimate is correct. Speaking of the Syri-
ans relative to other Christian populations, Gregorios states: “Before the
sixth century they were probably the most numerous Christian group,
larger than the Greeks, Latins, and Copts.”3 So far-flung was the mission
field, and so ethnically diverse was the Church of the East that it was
possible, albeit under special historical circumstances, for a non-Syrian

or non-Iranian to lead the entire church. This occurred in the year 1281
C.E., when M¡r Yahball¡h¡ III—a Turco-Mongol from the ecclesiastical
province of China—was elected to the supreme office of Catholicós-
Patriarch.4

By “Persia” is meant something quite different from the territory of
present-day Iran. Broadly speaking, Persia in Sasanian times was a re-
gion lying both to the west and to the east of the Tigris River. Persia in-
cluded what is now Iraq, part of Afghanistan, as well as Russian Azar-
baijan.5 According to Sasanian documents, Persians distinguished two
kinds of land within their empire: ‹r¡n proper, and non-‹r¡n (“An£r¡n”).
Although west of present-day Iran, Iraq was actually considered to be
part of Iran. According to Wilhelm Eilers, the name al-<Ir¡q is actually a
Persian word (er¡gh), meaning, “lowlands.”6 (This etymology may not be
absolutely certain.) As Eilers observes: “For the Sasanians, too, the low-
lands of Iraq constituted the heart of their dominions…”.7 This shows
that Iraq was not simply part of the Persian Empire—it was the heart of
Persia. Thus the Euphrates river formed the true western frontier of the
Persian Empire.8 There was a great overlap here with the linguistic terri-
tory of Syriac, a language based in northern Mesopotamia, the country
stretching between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and adjoining re-

\[5\] Prior to the Sasanian empire, the Parthian empire (the Parthians were a

gions. Northern Mesopotamia consisted of the Syriac-speaking regions of
Adiabene and Osrhoëne. This land formed much of present-day Iraq.

Bardaißan (Bardesanes, Bar Daiß¡n, d. 222 C.E.)9 refers to the exis-
tence of Christians in the provinces of P¡rs, Medea, K¡sh¡n, and Parthia.
Twice during his war against the Romans (viz., the two captures of
Antioch in 256 and 260 C.E.), Sh¡p∞r deported sizeable contingents of
Greek-speaking Christian prisoners of war from Antioch and other cities
and colonized these “spoils of war” in Persis, Parthia, Susiana, and Baby-
lonia. According to the Chronicle of Séert, this resulted in there being two
churches—Greek and Syriac—at R™v-Ardash£r in Persis (P¡rs).10 Despite
these ethnic boundaries, this was a fortuitous boon to Christianity in
Persia.

The “Church of Persia” is principally an ecclesiastical term, desig-
nating the East Syrian Church, which flourished, albeit with episodic
persecutions, in the Persian empire under the Sasanians. “Persian Chris-
tianity” is a more geographical or regional description term, adumbrating
West Syrian Jacobites as well, who eventually sought refuge in the Sa-
sanian kingdom. The term “Persian” by itself will be used to denote eth-
nic Iranian Christians, who were mostly converts from Zoroastrianism.
Indeed, while the liturgy and instruction remained, for the most part,
Syriac, a subsidiary Christian vernacular was Persian. During the Sa-
sanian period, Brock notes that “Persian became an increasingly impor-
tant literary vehicle for Christians” and that there was a “once extensive
Christian literature in this language…”.11 So multi-ethnic was East Syr-

ian Christianity that “Christians in the Sasanid empire employed a whole
number of different languages for ecclesiastical use.”12

Aphrah¡† “the Persian sage” is our earliest major witness to Christi-
anity within the Persian empire. Likewise, F. Rilliet was quoted earlier
as having stated that Ephrem “is a privileged witness of the tradition of
the primitive church of Persia.”13 While developments that brought the
Church of Persia into its own as a church independent of Rome were sub-
sequent to both Aphrah¡† and Ephrem, their legacy had a formative and
abiding influence on Persian Christianity.

Rome and Persia, superpowers of the early Christian world, were
perpetually at war. This political conflict had a role in sparking religious
conflict as well. In the fourth century, when Christianity became the
state religion of the Roman Empire, Christianity became politicized. The
superpower rivalry then took on overt religious overtones. Now, for non-
Roman Christians, the pendulum between persecution and protection
swung between state religion as well as affairs of state. A rival religion
competed with Christianity for power. This was the ancient Persian re-
ligion known as Zoroastrianism. This Persian monotheism, founded on an
ethical dualism, traditionally held to “good thoughts, good words, good
deeds” as its sacred ideal. But in political reality, as the state religion of
Persia, Zoroastrianism exercised quite the opposite in its treatment of
Christians.

Zoroastrianism reached its zenith of power under the patronage of
Sh¡p∞r I (r. 241–272). Persian Christianity became the primary target of
the intolerance with which the Magian religion became imbued. It was
the chief priest Kart£r who had the Persian prophet M¡n£ tortured and
executed. Social status or rank of nobility provided little protection from
the wide-scale persecution of Christians at the hands of a fanatical
Magian clergy. Not even the high-born Qandira (Candida) the Ro-
man—who was the Christian consort of                   King Varahan II      (r.
276–293)—was spared. It was Kart£r who probably instigated the first

persecution of Christians in Persia. Persecutions continued throughout
the rest of Sh¡p∞r II’s reign, and, sporadically, during the reigns of his
successors, Ardash£r II (r. 379–383) and Vaharan IV (r. 388–399). Under
the reign of Yazdagird I (r. 399–421), Christians were tolerated until the
year 420 C.E. Christian sources, in fact, praise Yazdagird.

The discovery on Kh¡rg Island in the Persian Gulf of no fewer than
sixty Christian tombs indicates that by the year 250 C.E. there was al-
ready a strong Christian presence in Persia. These sixty tombs at Kh¡rg,
an island near Bushire and opposite Bahrain, were cut into a coral bank.
Vestiges of Syriac inscriptions are still visible on the vertical columns of
these Christian tombs. Stewart McCullough speculates that Christians
on the mainland had selected the island as a place less vulnerable to dis-
turbance by fanatical Zoroastrian priests. These sixty tombs may in fact
have housed martyrs of persecutions instigated by the high priest,
Kart£r,14 “who gave Zoroastrianism a new dimension by turning it into a
religion that would brook no rivals in Iran.”15

As a dual-authority polity, Christians within the Persian Empire had
divided loyalties. During the reign of Sh¡p∞r II (310–379 C.E.),
Constantine (d. 337) converted to Christianity. In turn, Christianity was
converted to the state religion of the Roman Empire. (Ephrem’s native
town of Nisibis was represented at the Council of Nicea in 325 C.E. by
Bishop Jacob.) Unwittingly, after the transformation of the Roman Em-
pire into a Christian state, Persian Christians became a political van-
guard of Rome. This placed them in an even more precarious situation.
Already vulnerable as a religious minority, Persian Christians were per-
ceived as allied with the enemy, and not without justification. Three
years after Constantine’s death in 337 C.E., persecution against the
Christians in Persia began.

In his Life of Constantine, Eusebius, the first historian of the Church,
states that there were “many churches of God in Persia and that large

numbers were gathered into the fold of Christ.”16 Constantine’s conver-
sion to Christianity and the Christianizing of the Roman Empire cast a
pall of suspicion over an estimated 35,000 Persian Christians, who fell
victim to the Great Persecution that began in 339 C.E. and ended only
with the death of Sh¡p∞r II forty years later. (Large-scale persecution of
Persian Christians was instigated mainly during times of war, when
Christians were suspected of favoring the enemy.)17

This situation was aggravated by overt pro-Roman sympathies held
by some of the Persian Christians. Aphrah¡† is a case-in-point. The Per-
sian Sage writes: “The People of God have received prosperity, and suc-
cess awaits the man who has been the instrument of that prosperity [i.e.,
Constantine]; but disaster threatens the army gathered together by the
efforts of a wicked and proud man puffed up by vanity [Å¡p∞r].… The
[Roman] Empire will not be conquered, because the hero whose name is
Jesus is coming with His power, and His army will uphold the whole
army of the Empire” (Aph. Dem. 5.1.24).18

Survival necessitated an eventual break between Roman and Persian
Christians. Eventually this break took place. The counterpart of Rome in
the Persian Empire was Seleucia-Ctesiphon, the twin-city Sasanian capi-
tal where Persian Christianity officially constituted itself in the year 410
C.E. at the Synod of M¡r Is˙¡q, asserting its full independence in the
Synod of D¡d£å¢< in 424 C.E. (See details in the section, “The Persian
Synods,” below.) The area encompassed by Persian Christianity included
areas both within present-day Iran (such as the province of P¡rs) as well
as the frontier regions of Nisibis and Adiabene. M¡r Is˙¡q in fact pro-
claimed himself “bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, Catholicós and Head
(r™å¡) over the bishops of all the Orient (madne˙¡).”19

Ecclesiastical development within Persian Christianity has also been
documented. Its anchor in orthodoxy seemed secure in its adherence to

the Nicene Creed. Indeed, a certain “John of Persia” (Yohannan of B™®
P¡rs¡y™) is recorded as having represented Persia at the Council of Ni-
caea in 325 C.E. (Eusebius, in his Life of Constantine, remarked that
“even a Persian bishop attended the Synod.”)20 In 345 C.E., at the Synod
of Seleucia, Bishop P¡p¡ bar Aggai sought to consolidate all of the
churches in Persian territory under his rule. But the bishops of Persia
proper thwarted this scheme. Particularly strong resistance came from
M£l™s of Susa.

Later, at the Synod of M¡r Is˙¡q (410), the Church of Persia was offi-
cially established in Seleucia-Ctesiphon, the royal capital of Persia.
These were twin cities, situated on either side of the Tigris river. This
Synod commenced with a prayer for the king, Yazdagird I, who had
granted tolerance and even favor to Christians and other minorities. The
Synod officially adopted the Nicene Creed. Six “classical” provinces
within the western regions of the Sasanian empire were represented in
the official records of this synod. Geo Widengren has assembled a list of
fifteen evangelized provinces in Sasanian Iran and in Central Asia.21 I
have expanded Widengren’s list to at least eighteen provinces, excluding
“Outer Iran” (Central Asia). Some of these provinces were ecclesiastical
provinces. The rest were bishoprics. The following table lists all of
twenty-five provinces of the Sasanian empire as enumerated in Sh¡p∞r
I’s inscription on the Ka<ba-yi Zardusht.22 These provinces are repre-
sented in geographical order and by quadrant, according to the points of
the compass (kust). Evangelized provinces are marked in bold:

Evangelized Provinces of Sasanian Persia: the Evidence: The first six
ecclesiastical provinces of the Church of the East were formalized as hy-
parchies in the Synod of M¡r Is˙¡q (410 C.E.). These provinces did not
represent all of the Christian districts within the frontiers of the Sa-
sanian empire at that time. In Canon XXI, the assembled bishops express
the hope that “the bishops from the far-away regions (atraw¡t¡ ra˙£q™),
from P¡rs, the Islands, B™® M¡d¡y™, B™® R[az]£q¡y™, indeed, even from
the Abaråahr regions” would accept the decisions reached by the synod.23
All of these regions will be briefly discussed in the geographical-
ecclesiastical overview that follows below.

1. P¡rs: This is the province in which John of Daylam established a
monastery for Persian-speaking monks in the eighth century.25 P¡rs is
mentioned as a bishropric in the Synod of 410. In the southwest province
of P¡rs (F¡rs, Persia proper), the city of I†akhr (Iß†akhr)—summer capi-
tal of the Sasanians—had become a diocese by 424.26 In its role as the
spiritual centre of Zoroastrianism, in ˆI†akhr was kept the dynasty’s fire,
the An¡h£d-ardash£r, described as the “ideological heart of the empire.”27

Between 415 and 420 C.E, P¡rs became an ecclesiastical province.28 As of
the Synod of M¡r B¡bay in 497, its metropolis was R™v-Ardash£r
(R£shahr), from whence the Nestorian mission to India was directed. The
province of P¡rs included Qais Island, a distinct bishopric as of 544 C.E.

2. Parthau: Aspadana (Sp¡h¡n, Isp¡h¡n, Ißf¡h¡n) in the southwest
province of Parthau is also mentioned in the Synod of M¡r D¡d£å¢< (424).

3. Kh∞zist¡n: (Represented as an ecclesiastical province in the
Synod of 410.) In the southwest quadrant of Sasanian Iran, the province
of Kh∞zist¡n (Syriac: B™® ¥∞z¡y™) was also known as Parthian Susiana,
Elymais, Elam. Its metropolis was the pre-Sasanian diocese of B™® L¡p¡†
(later Gund™-Sh¡p∞r). The ancient capital of Sh∞sh (Susa) became a dio-
cese by 410, as was the case with Kark¡ d~ L¡dhan (¤r¡nshahr-Sh¡p∞r),
and R¡mhur-muz (R¡m-Ormazd-Ardash£r), the major city in the east of
the province.29 A bishopric was established in Hormizd-Ardash£r (Ahv¡z),
the later capital of Kh∞zist¡n.30

western province of Maiå¡n (M™å¡n, Mesene) had four bishoprics, with
Pher¡t d~ Maiå¡n (later Vahman-Ardash£r) as its metropolis.31

the western province (shahr) of ⁄s∞rist¡n (Syriac: B™® Ar¡m¡y™) was
known as Assyria, although historical Assyria was actually to the north.

leucia-Ctesiphon, the Sasanian administrative capital and royal winter
residence. The bishop of the district of Kashkar served as auxiliary.33

6. N¢dardash£rag¡n: (Represented as an ecclesiastical province in
the Synod of 410.) The western province of Garam£g ud N¢dardash£rag¡n
(Syriac: B™® Garmay) was north of ⁄s∞rist¡n between the Tigris and Lit-
tle Kh¡b∞r rivers, and the mountains of ⁄zarb¡yj¡n. Its metropolis was
Kark¡ d~ B™® Sel¢k (Kirk∞k). This ecclesiastical province included the
bishopric of P™r¢z-Sh¡p∞r34 (Faish¡b∞r) and probably the diocese of
Shahraz∞r.35 Garam£g used to be part of the province of Adiabene. Evi-
dently, Garamig was organized as a special province between 343 and
410 C.E.36

Adiabene: (Represented as an ecclesiastical province in the
Synod of 410.) In what is now northern Iraq, the Sasanian buffer state
Adiabene (Syriac: ¥edyab, ¥adyab) lay east of the Tigris, between the
Greater and Lesser Z¡b rivers. An organized Christian community since
the late Parthian period, Adiabene’s metropolis was Arbela (Irb£l).

¥ulw¡n: The ecclesiastical province of ¥ulw¡n (Syriac: B™®
M¡d¡y™, M¡da) was established and organized by Catholicós Iåoyabh
Gedd¡l¡y¡ II between the years 628–643.37 It occupied the region of
southern Media, now Albania.38

Parishkw¡rgar: In the Caspian region of D™lam (Dailam, Daylam)
in the northern province of Parishkw¡rgar (ˇabarist¡n), John of Daylam
founded several monasteries. Later, John traveled to Arraj¡n (Arg¡n) in
F¡rs, where he established two monasteries, one for Syriac-speaking
monks and the other for Persian-speaking monks. In the Book of the
Laws of Countries, Bar Daiß¡n’s pupil Philippus had already attested the
presence of Christians in both nearby G£l¡n and in Kush¡n: “Our sisters
among the Geli and the Kushanians do not have intercourse with for-
eigners, and they who live in Persia do not marry their daughters.”41 The
G™ls, who were admired as valiant warriors, were the native inhabitants
of G£l¡n, which, along with Daylam, lay in the mountainous regions on
the southern shores of the Caspian.

culmination of missionary efforts within the Sasanian empire, as Richard
N. Frye observes: “In the east, too, Christian missionaries made converts
among the Hephthalites and Sogdians, so one may infer everywhere a
growing Christian influence at the end of the Sasanian empire.”56

A total of some eighteen Sasanian provinces are thus known to have
been evangelized. Nestorian missions extended far beyond the Sasanian
borders, expanding east through Central Asia, and finally reaching to the
end of the world as it was known, China. Numerically, this is sixty-eight
percent of the provinces of the Persian empire.

By the fall of the Sasanian dynasty, before the Arab onslaught in the
mid-seventh century, there were ten metropolitan sees (including the pa-

triarchate) and ninety-six bishoprics.57 Brock notes that: “In what is today
north Iraq, conversions to Christianity from paganism continued into the
early Islamic period…”.58 With the advent of Islam, the Church of Persia
went into decline in terms of population, but certainly not intellectually
nor in the prosecution of its missionary endeavors. It is estimated that
the majority of the population of Iran was more or less fully converted to
Islam between 850 and 950 C.E.59 The Nestorian chronicler M¡r£ b. Su-
laym¡n reported that “many” Christians in Iran had converted to Islam
in the late tenth century due to persecution and to corruption of the
clergy.60 However, in the mountain regions of the north, it took nearly
two centuries for Islam to penetrate Daylam and G£l¡n. Persia’s conver-
sion to Islam was nearly complete only with the establishment of the
Seljuk empire.61

The Nestorian Controversy and the Independence of the Church of
Persia: In the fifth century, from Narsai (d. c. 471) onward, the Church of
Persia became, loosely speaking, “Nestorian,” incorporating a dyophysite,
“two-natures” position within its Christology.

In 428 C.E., Nestorius had become the Patriarch of Byzantium. Ne-
storius taught that Christ was one person, but had two distinct natures,
divine and human. These natures remained separate, such that Mary was
not, properly speaking, the “Mother of God” (theotókos). Nestorius re-
jected the divinity of the man Jesus. This was utter doom for him and his
followers. Cyril of Alexandria, adamant in his belief that the two natures
of Christ were united at birth, vigorously opposed Nestorius. He was

anathematized at the Council of Ephesus (431 C.E.). Under Byzantine
rule, Nestorians were forced to flee Edessa. They took refuge in Nisibis
under Persian rule. This proved a blessing in disguise, as the Nestorian
church, despite sporadic persecutions, flourished in Persia, steering as it
did a steady course between alternate patronage and persecution.

Nestorius was held in high esteem by Narsai, the great consolidator
of Nestorianism, popularly known as the “Harp of the Spirit” (kin¡r¡ d-
r∞˙¡). The innocence of Nestorius is championed by Narsai in a homily in
defense of the “Three Doctors”—Diodore of Tarsus, Theodore of Mopsues-
tia, and Nestorius.62 “The Persian Christians, moreover, have never, with
common consent, referred to themselves as ‘Nestorians’; this was a de-
rogatory title employed by the Monophysites for all dyophysite Chris-
tians.”63 Rather, Persian Christians were Theodoran. Insofar as he fol-
lowed Theodore of Mopsuestia, Nestorius was looked upon as orthodox
and as one who was treated unjustly.

Generally, Persian Christians avoided referring to Nestorius by
name. It was, after all, a lightning rod for criticisms of those errors tradi-
tionally ascribed to him. Yet the influence of Nestorius was undeniable.
In its Syriac translation, Nestorius’ Book of Herakleides exerted a power-
ful influence on B¡bay the Great (d. 628).64 However, Nestorius was by
no means the major theologian of the Church of the East. That distinc-
tion rests with B¡bay. “For the Persians,” writes Geevarghese Chediath,

“Babai’s Christology was the Christology of their church.”65 B¡bay’s ma-
jor Christological treatise was On the Union (sc. of the two natures of
Christ). In current scholarship, the term “Nestorian” is still a term of
convenience, not of deprecation. This is not without precedent within the
Church of the East itself. In the year 1609 C.E., for instance, M¡r <Abd
Yeshua drew up the “orthodox creed of the Nestorians,” having done so
“in the blessed city of Khl¡t in the church of the blessed Nestorians.”66
Centuries earlier, in the 8th-century to be precise, Mar Shahdost of
Tirhan67 had composed a treatise entitled, Why we Easterns have sepa-
rated ourselves from the Westerns, and why we are called Nestorians. In
this text, the author refers to his faith-community as, “we, the Nestori-
ans.”68

Monarchs often took a vested and active interest in overseeing Per-
sian Christianity. Sasanian kings took interest in various Synods. In 552,
Kav¡dh’s son Chosroes I (r. 531–579) imposed his own nominee as Catho-
licós for ratification at the Synod of 554. At the Synod of M¡r Ezekiel
(576), Chosroes I demanded that he be named in the litanies during the
liturgy.69 In 609 C.E., Chosroes II (r. 591–628) was outraged when his
own candidate was passed over. So he forbade any subsequent election,
which eventually left the Christian community temporarily without a
head until the King’s death nullified the ban. In the late sixth century,
the Christian communities of Marv and Herat became prominent. In the

year 651, the Bishop of Marv donated a sepulchre for the assassinated
Yazdagird III.70 But the relationship between Church and State was al-
ways tense and precarious. War-weary and overtaxed, many Persian
Christians welcomed with palm fronds the Arab conquerors of Ctesi-
phon.71

The Persian Synods: The Church of Persia held its own series of syn-
ods, the records of which have come down to us in the so-called Synodicon
Orientale.72 It is a record of the history of Christianity in Sasanian Iran.
This chronicle, however, is not contemporary. It was compiled by the
Catholicós Timothy in the late eighth century. The first bishop of histori-
cal stature of the Persian capital of Seleucia-Ctesiphon was a certain
P¡p¡, who lived in the fourth century. P¡p¡ was opposed by Miles, bishop
of Susa, who deposed P¡p¡ from office when P¡p¡ tried to impose auto-
cratic rule on Miles’ episcopal colleagues. P¡p¡’s effort to consolidate
churches in Persia into a unified Church of Persia had failed.

The Church of Persia officially constituted itself in its first Synod of
410 C.E. (Not until the year 409. C.E. was public Christian worship per-
mitted.)73 Virtually isolated until the early fifth century, the Church of
Persia—by virtue of its ancient autonomy— had no dependency on any
western diocese, even in Antioch. (There was, however, a theory to the
contrary, advanced by some medieval East Syriac writers, who main-
tained that the see of Seleucia-Ctesiphon had once been subordinate to
the patriarchate of Antioch.)74 The patriarchal church structure in the

Byzantine West had crystallized during the fourth and fifth centuries.
And Byzantine influence can be seen in the first general synod of the
Church of Persia, held in 410 C.E. This transpired when M¡r∞®¡, the
Byzantine imperial envoy for peace negotiations between the Roamn and
Persian empires, set out to the Sasanian capital of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, to
align the Church of Persia with the norms of the Church of the West.

In this venture, M¡r∞®¡ succeeded in enlisting the support of the Per-
sian monarch, Yazdagird I. “It is significant,” Brock remarks, “that the
synod was convoked by the Shah himself.”75 By royal decree, the bishops
of the realm were summoned to the capital. The Byzantine ecclesiastical
envoy acted as co-president of the synod, along with the Catholicós
[Archbishop], M¡r Is˙¡q. The synod promulgated a number of canons
that regulated church doctrine, liturgy, and office in accordance with the
prevailing practices of the West. A variation on the Nicene creed was also
adopted. The rule of one bishop per city created problems in areas where
there were multiple sees, due to the presence of sometimes Greek, Syriac,
and Persian Christian populations. Several days after the initial session,
M¡r∞®¡ and Mar Is˙¡q (Isaac) arranged for an official audience with the
king, before whom all of the Persian bishops were assembled. This
marked what was probably the very first time that the relationship be-
tween church and state was regularized.76

Another synod was convoked in 420 C.E., under the presidency of the
new Catholicós Yahball¡h¡ and another Byzantine ambassador, Acacius
of Amida. But in the Synod of 424, at which a Byzantine representative
was not present, the full autonomy of the Church of Persia was espoused.
Here, as in the three Petrine sees of Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch, the
language of the Synod of 424 was couched in Petrine terms. In its canoni-
cal emancipation from Antioch, the Church of Persia placed itself outside

Vernacular Persian in Church of the East Liturgy?: What evidence is
there to attest to the presence of an indigenous, ethno-linguistic Iranian
presence in Persian Christianity, which was predominately East Syrian?
Is it possible that ethnic Persians constituted the most important minor-
ity in the Church of the East, once a flourishing, multi-ethnic and thus
“universal” Church? Gernot Wiessner has stressed the importance of the
Iranian ethnic element in Nestorianism.78 Evidence suggests there was
an appreciable ethnic Iranian representation in the Church of Persia.
This is colorfully illustrated by an episode in the Syriac Life of John of
Dailam. John of Daylam (variously spelled Dailam, Deylam) was an East
Syrian saint of the 7th–8th century, who lived in western Persia. The fol-
lowing narrative tells of a controversy that broke out among the monks
in Arraj¡n over whether to conduct services in Syriac or in Persian:

> Now the Persian and Syriac-speaking brethren quarreled with each
> other over the services: the Persians said, “We should all recite the
> services in our language, seeing that we live in Persian territory”;
> while the Syriac-speakers said, “Our father is a Syriac-speaker, and
> so we should recite the services in our language, on account of the
> founder of the monastery; furthermore we do not know how to recite
the services in Persian.”

When M¡r Yo˙annan saw the quarrel had arisen, he pacified the
> brethren and prayed to God with deep feeling. Thereupon he was told
> in a revelation from God: “Build them another monastery the other
> side of the river, opposite this one, resembling it in every respect. Let
> the Persian-speakers live in one, and the Syriac in the other.” So he
> built another monastery just like the first, and the Syriac-speaking
> brethren lived there. Thus the quarrel between the brethren was re-
> solved.79

This is plausible enough, especially in light of the resurgence of liter-
ary Persian in the ninth century. If this story has any basis in fact, it
provides anecdotal evidence of a considerable segment of ethnic Iranians
within the Church of Persia. A recent study pronounces the following
verdict on the historicity of this account: “John traveled to Arraj¡n in
F¡rs, where he founded several monasteries: two of them were assigned
to Persia- and Syriac-speaking monks respectively, so that neither com-
munity should be forced to celebrate services in a foreign language. De-
spite some chronological confusion and the legendary accretions typical
of Syriac hagiographical literature, there is no reason to doubt the essen-
tial historicity of this biography.”80 Indeed, there must have been a sig-
nificant number of native Persians converting to Christianity. In the
fifth century, imperial ambassadors from the Roman emperor Theodosius
beseeched Yazdagird I (r. 399–421) to release from prison a deacon
named Benjamin, to which the Shah replied: “Give me assurance in his
own handwriting that he will not convert to his faith any more Magians
in Persia. If so, at your request, I will free him from chains.” This offi-
cially constituted one of the terms of the peace treaty of 56181 during the
reign of Chosroes I (r. 531–579) which established that there should be
freedom of religion, but not to proselytize. Both Christians and Zoroastri-
ans were forbidden to proselytize in their respective territories.82

According to Asmussen, “numerous” Christian converts in the fifth
century had Zoroastrian names, attesting to the success of the Church of
Persia in converting ethnic Iranians.83 By the fifth century, some of the
chief Iranian festivals had already been turned into Christian feasts.84
The influx of former Zoroastrians in the Church of Persia was of such
magnitude that the Persian king J¡m¡sp (r. 498–501) summoned a synod

to deliberate on the problem of Zoroastrian marriage customs within the
Christian community. That this was a topic of major concern in the sixth
century is also attested by the earliest treatise of canon law by Catholicós
M¡r Ab¡ I (d. 552), which was devoted to this subject.85 Further evidence
of the conversion of ethnic Iranians is found in various other documents.
In 595 C.E., the patriarch Sabrisho persuaded Chosroes II (r. 591–628) to
grant Christians freedom of worship. According to the Life of Sabrisho,
as a result many Persian noblemen converted.86 Prior to this, even a son
of Chosroes I had become a Christian.87 This must have alarmed both the
monarch and the Zoroastrian priests. Active proselytizing of Zoroastrians
by the Nestorians was ended as a matter of policy with the truce of 562
C.E. concluded between Constantinople and Persia.

Christians in Persia constituted, in political scientific terms, a “dual
authority polity” (a communal group having two sources of political
authority—state and diasporal, the latter typically being ecclesiastical in
the case of faith-communities). The Persian state was the political
authority and (Imperial) Christianity the diasporal authority. Conversion
to Christianity, for some, entailed spiritual fealty to Christianity in the
West. Thus, Persian monarchs were, to a degree, rightly suspicious of
Christians as sympathizers with the archenemy Rome, but were mis-
taken in their fear that this constituted any real threat. With one or two
minor exceptions perhaps, Christian sympathy was hardly complicity.
Yet, on the pretext of treason, many Christians paid with their lives for
pro-Roman leanings. Over time, Christians tried to dispel this cloud of
political suspicion and to enlist the support of the Persian monarchy.

Moreover, there is evidence that some Persian Christians were openly
loyal to the Sasanian state. In the sixth century, a known convert from
Zoroastrianism, named Gr£g¢r, was commissioned by Cawad [sic] as a

san Yarshater; Cambridge University Press, 1983): vol. 3(2), 792–815 [804].

general during a campaign against Rome.88 Gr£g¢r is reputed to have in
fact been the leader of the Persians in war against the Romans.89 During
the large-scale persecution of Christians (339–379) that took place in the
reign of Sh¡p∞r II (r. 310–379), a Christian courtier named Gushtazad
apostasized from Christianity but thereafter repented, to die a martyr’s
death. On being led off to his fate, Gushtazad insisted on sending a last
message to Sh¡p∞r II: “I have always been loyal to you and your father.
Grant me one request: Let a herald proclaim that Gushtazad is being put
to death, not for treason, but because he was a Christian who refused to
renounce God.”90 It should be added, however, that this loyalty to state
did not constitute loyalty to a “nation.”91

The extent to which Persian Christians sought to curry favor with the
state is seen in the Synodicon, in which Chosroes I (r. 531–579) is re-
ferred to as “the second Cyrus (kwrå)”92 who is “preserved by divine
grace.” In Canon 14 of the Synod of 576, Persian Christians were told: “It
is right that in all the churches of this exalted and glorious kingdom that
our lord the victorious Chosroes, king of kings, be named in the litanies
during the liturgy. No metropolitan or bishop has any authority to waive
this canon in any of the churches of his diocese and jurisdiction.”93 Even
when Persian Christians went to such lengths to appease imperial suspi-
cions as to Christian loyalties, religious persecution at the hands of fa-
natical and intolerant Magians posed a separate, though related chal-
lenge to the Christian community.

Much of our information concerning the ethnic origins of ethnic
Christian minorities in the Church of the East comes from martyrologies,
in which indigenous converts—especially ethnic Iranian converts—figure

heroines, Sh£r£n and Gulindukht. Sh£r£n of Karka d~ Beth Selokh was
the daughter of Zoroastrian parents. For her Christian faith she was ar-
rested and martyred in Seleucia in February 559. Gulindukht was re-
lated to Chosroes I and had been married to a Zoroastrian general. She
was converted to Christianity by some Christian prisoners of war.
Thrown into the Fortress of Oblivion (An∞shbard) after her refusal to
revert to Zoroastrianism, she chose martyrdom, despite the intervention
of Aristoboulos, a legate sent on a peace mission by the emperor
Maurice.94 She was martyred in 591. Himself a Zoroastrian convert, Je-
susabran of Be® Garmay was another such martyr.95 In Iran, the royal
martyr Sh£ndokht is remembered to this day.

Thus, there were, generally speaking, two types of persecution of
Christian in Sasanian Persia. The first were large-scale persecutions
perpetrated in times of war against Rome. An argument could be made
that such persecutions were provoked by ill-disguised sympathies among
many Persian Christians for Imperial Christianity and its Christian Em-
peror. Even in sporadic times of royal clemency and favor, the one grave
danger Persian Christians had to face was the hostility of the Magi. This
brought about the second type of persecution: persecution by Magians of
prominent ex-Zoroastrian Christians. As Sebastian Brock observes:
“Other martyrs under the Sasanids were individuals, most of whom were
converts of high-born Zoroastrian origin, whose prominence in society led
to their denunciation by the Magian clergy and subsequent sentencing to
death.”96 Some of this persecution Christians had brought upon them-
selves, through isolated acts of vandalism that included the destruction
of Zoroastrian fire-temples.97

Despite the unrelenting pressure and threat to life and limb, former
Zoroastrian converts to Nestorianism could aspire to Church leadership.
One such convert was M¡r A∏a I, who became Catholicós in the year 540

C.E.98 But he suffered considerably. Called before a council of the Magi
in c. 541–542, he neither agreed to alter the Church’s canons on marriage,
nor would he have Christians desist from their current practices of prose-
lytizing. For this he was detained in a village in Azarbaijan for seven
years, from whence he exercised his leadership of the Church of Persia.
Another type of leadership was that of the mystic, or “holy man.” One
such holy man was the renowned Nestorian mystic, Joseph Hazz¡y¡, who
was from a high-born Zoroastrian family.99

The pressures of a Zoroastrian environment were felt in all aspects of
Christian life. Monasticism in Persia benefited from an influx of Mono-
physites, who were exiled to northwest Persia as a consequence of the
anti-Monophysite policy of the emperor Justin (r. 518–527). (Ecclesiasti-
cally, the “Jacobites” as Monophysites continued to maintain ties with
Antioch as late as the early seventh century.100) At a debate he arranged
at the royal court, Khusrau I (r. 531–579) was favorably impressed with
the Monophysites who pleaded their cause in answer to Nestorian accusa-
tions. Khusrau decreed that the Nestorians henceforth leave the Mono-
physites free to build as many monasteries and churches as they
pleased.101

During the latter part of the fifth-century, however, the character of
Persian Christianity underwent a profound shift away from celibacy.
Asmussen views this as a development resulting in part from the Persian
predilection for Nestorianism: “There is scarcely any doubt that this spe-
cial development of the history of the Church must be viewed against the
growing contribution from Christian Iranians who, rooted from birth in
Sasanian Zoroastrianism, quite naturally had to acknowledge Nestori-
anism as the most adequate expression for them of the new teaching to

which they were attracted. This contribution from Iranians, perhaps par-
ticularly from the province of F¡rs, the dynastic province, created at the
same time the best conditions for the growth of a specifically Iranian,
notably anti-ascetic, Christianity which replaced the original, clearly as-
cetic, Christianity, strongly dominated by Jewish-Christian elements.”102
In the Synod of B™t L¡p¡†, summoned and overseen by Barßauma in 484
C.E., celibacy may have been abolished, but in the absence of any direct
attestation of this, the Synod of M¡r Aq¡q in 486 became the effective
instrument for the cessation of the practice of celibacy among the Nesto-
rians.103 Within the Church, this move was not without controversy, and
there was much internal resistance against it. Notwithstanding, the
Church of the East has always opposed the alleged Sasanian practice of
consanguineous marriages.

Christian Literature in Middle Persian: During the fifth century, the
Christian church in Persia became independent of the patriarchate of
Antioch. The reasons for this break appear to have been more political
than religious. Not surprisingly, the fifth century saw the rise of a ver-
nacular Christian literature in Middle Persian.

The first known Christian text in Persian (apart from scripture trans-
lations) was a summary of the Christian religion. Originally composed in
Syriac by Elisha< bar Quzb¡y™, it was translated into Persian by the
Catholicós Aq¡q (Acacius, bishop of Amida, d. 496) and presented to the
Persian king, Kav¡∑ I (r. 488–497, 499–531).104 A parallel to this en-
deavor might be found in M¡n£, whose only writing in Middle Persian
was his Sh¡buhrag¡n, “presumably in order to expound his teaching to
Å¡p∞r,” as Sundermann opines.105

“At a very early date, particularly in the time of bishop Ma<n¡ at the
end of the 5th century,” writes Asmussen, efforts may be traced to create

a Christian Persian literature. Judging from the dearth of extant Persian
texts, such an assertion might appear hard to sustain. Nevertheless,
within the Sasanian empire, Persian seems to have been a subsidiary
Christian vernacular. For example, the most eminent of the Persian
Christians in the generations prior to the Islamic conquest was B¡bay
(Babai) the Great (d. 628), who presided over the Nestorian church in
Iran under Khusraw II. B¡bay is said by Vööbus to have “received in-
struction in Persian and then started his medical studies at Nisibis…”.106
Jacob Kollaparambil argues that the East Syrian Christians must have
taught and propagated the Christian message throughout Persia and
within India as well. This, he claims, is attested in the Chronicle of Séert
[citing the Syriac text in Patrologia Orientalis VII, 117] when it records
that, around the year 470 C.E., Bishop Ma<n¡ of R™v-Ardash£r wrote re-
ligious discourses, canticles and hymns, in Persian, and translated from
Greek into Persian [i.e. Pahlavi, Middle Persian107] the theological trea-
tises of Diodore of Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia and sent copies “to
the islands of the sea” [B™® Qa†r¡y™] and to India.108 (Some authors have
confused Ma<n¡ of Sh£r¡z with the Catholicós Ma<n¡, who lived in the
first half of the fifth century.) Nicholas Sims-Williams is more precise in
noting that Ma<n¡ of Sh£r¡z “composed various works in Persian, in-
cluding hymns (madr¡å™), ‘discourses’ (m™mr™), and responses (<∞ni¡t¡)
for liturgical use.”109 These, of course, were based on Syriac models.

The royal city of R™v-Ardash£r (R£shahr) was a metropolitan province
in Persia proper (Persis). It was the ecclesiastical capital of the province
of P¡rs. Over time, it had “grown into a super-province having 18 suffra-

gan eparchies.”110 Bruce Metzger believes that, on the basis of this infor-
mation, it may be deduced that the scriptures had already been trans-
lated into Middle Persian. “Inasmuch as during the second half of the
fifth century an eminent teacher Ma<n¡ of Shiraz, made translations of
Diodorus, Theodore of Mopsuestia, and other ecclesiastical writers, from
Syriac into his native Persian dialect,” Metzger reasons, “we may be con-
fident that the scriptures had already been translated.”111 Kollaparambil
concludes: “Hence it is clear that, though the Persian Church used Syriac
as the liturgical language, the medium of Christian instruction was the
Persian language.”112

This effort to create a body of Christian literature in the Persian ver-
nacular was overshadowed by the ascendancy of Syriac, which reclaimed
its place as the primary liturgical and literary language of the church in
Persia. Syriac remained the language of the church in Persia, as seen in
the Acts of the Persian Martyrs. Most of the martyrs were ethnic Per-
sians. These Persians not only embraced the Christian faith, but also the
Christian language as well (viz., Syriac).113 Consequently, very little of
this Christian Persian literature survived. Two legal works by the metro-
politans Iåo<bo˚t and Simon provide a rare attestation of this Persian lit-
erary activity.114

Middle Persian translations of the Bible date from at least the fifth
century C.E. There is both patristic and material evidence for this. In the
fourth century, John Chrysostom (fl. 391), patriarch of Constantinople,
affirmed that the teachings of Christ had been translated into the lan-
guages of the Syrians, the Egyptians, the Indians, the Persians, and the
Ethiopians (Homily on John, in Migne, Patrologia Graeca LIX, col. 32). In
the fifth century, Theodoret of Cyrrus wrote that Persians venerated the

(Graecarum affectionum curatio IX. 936, in Migne, PG LXXXIII, col.
1045c).

The earliest Persian translations of scripture were probably under-
taken for liturgical purposes. This is evidently the case with the Turfan
Psalter, which is the only extant Middle Persian Bible version. It is rep-
resented by fragments of a translation of the Psalms, discovered at the
ruins of the Nestorian monastery at Shuipang near Bulayïq in the Tur-
fan oasis in northern Xinjiang (Chinese Turkestan). These Psalms were
written in an archaic, cursive Book Pahlavi script, dating back to the
fifth or fourth centuries, “though the manuscript may be younger,” ac-
cording to Kenneth Thomas and Fereydun Vahman.115 The Turfan Psal-
ter contains most of Psalms 94–99, 118 and 121–136. Its distinctively li-
turgical character is noted by Geo Widengren: “This manuscript was writ-
ten for liturgical use, provided with antiphons, so-called canons, corre-
sponding to the text now found in the breviary of the Nestorian
church.”116

Independent attestation of Middle Persian Bible translations is found
in Zoroastrian polemical literature, particularly in the ninth-century
Åkand gum¡n£k v i ≈ ¡ r (“The Doubt-Crushing Explanation”).117 “The
Christians of Iran,” comments Shaul Shaked, “were dependent largely on
the Syriac versions of the Bible, but the activity of creating new versions
in the current vernacular must have been part of the missionary effort of
Christians.”118 There is other evidence of such missionary endeavors, an
essential component of which was the creation of a body of Christian
scripture and literature in vernacular Persian.

Not only was there a Christian literature in Middle Persian, but in-
scriptions as well. Evidence of the very missionary endeavors that
Shaked suggests are the Christian Pahlavi inscriptions of India. A cross
bearing a Pahlavi inscription was found in the Syrian church in Kotta-
yam, in the state of Kerala in India. Another such cross—the Cross of
Travancore—is a replica of the famed cross from the church on Mount St.
Thomas near Madras. This Cross of Travancore is inscribed in Book Pah-
lavi.119 Several post-Sasanian Christian seals inscribed in Arabic Kufic
script bear the names of Persian owners.120

“From the late fifth century,” Brock observes, “Persian became an in-
creasingly important literary vehicle for Christians.”121 Brock further
notes that “quite a number of extant Syriac hagiographic, legal and liter-
ary texts are in fact translations from lost Middle Persian originals.”122

Christian Sogdian: Outside the Persian empire there were other
Christian enclaves as well, such as the Nestorian centre at Samar-
kand.123 The Silk Road led to evangelization of Central Asia and the Far
East. A number of Persians who settled along this trade route were
Christians. Spreading the gospel required translation. Liturgical texts
(including scripture translations) and some patristic writings were trans-
lated from Syriac into Pahlavi and also into Sogdian. This accords with
Asmussen’s position that use of Persian greatly augmented Nestorian
missionary endeavors. “…[N]o doubt…,” he states, speaking of the prov-
ince of P¡rs, “Christians there had a common language with the ruling
dynasty, and by all accounts created a Christian literature in that lan-
guage [Persian] that was to be of considerable importance for the later

Nestorian mission in Central Asia.”124 In Outer Iran, in a region called
Sogdiana (a province north of Bactria, between the Oxus and the Jax-
artes rivers), the Nestorian church was well established by the early 8th
century at the latest. Ironically, no Christian Sogdian texts have ever
been found there.

In the Turfan oasis in Chinese Turkestan, a library of Christian
manuscripts was unearthed at the ruins of a Nestorian monastery of Bu-
layïq. This library was quite extensive, and reflects the spiritual and in-
tellectual interests of the monastic enclave there. The majority of these
texts are in Syriac and Sogdian. Generally, Christian Sogdian is written
in a Syriac Estrangela script, with three added characters to accommo-
date native Iranian sounds not found in Syriac. As to scripture, these
texts included sixth-century Sogdian translations of the Gospels, Pauline
epistles, and the Psalms. Among the abundant hagiographical literature
in Sogdian is the life of John of Daylam (vide supra), the founder of two
monasteries in P¡rs, one Syriac and one Persian. Also found at Bulayïq
was the Acts of the Persian Martyrs under Sh¡p∞r II, and the life of Bar-
shabb¡, credited as the founder of Persian Christian communities as far
east as Balkh.125 Martyrologies, though hagiographical, disclose much
valuable religio-cultural as well as biographical information.

Christian Literature in New Persian: Close to the Turfan oasis, the
second and third German Turfan expeditions discovered a very few
Christian texts in nearby Toyoq, Qo≈o (Zieme), Astana, and Qurutqa.
These texts were in Sogdian, Syriac, Turkish, and New Persian.126 This,
of course, has very clear liturgical implications. Sims-Williams states
that “…it is probable that the newly founded Christian communities ini-
tially employed Syriac and Middle Persian in their liturgy, the latter be-
ing gradually displaced by the successive local vernaculars, firstly Sog-
dian and ultimately New Persian.”127 In the eleventh century or later, a

New Persian-Syriac translation from the Syriac of Psalms 131, 132, 146,
147 was penned in Sogdian Syriac script. This is the earliest extant trans-
lation of Judeo-Christian scripture into New Persian.128

Perhaps the most remarkable of all Christian manuscripts written in
New Persian is the Persian Diatessaron. It survives in a unique manu-
script: Dated 1547, it is housed in the Laurentian Library in Florence
(Florence: Biblioteca Laurenziana Mediceo– Laurenziana, Cod. Orient.
VII [81]). The Persian Harmony was translated from the Syriac by the
Jacobite priest ‹wann£s <Izz al-D£n Mu˙ammad b. MuΩaffar of Tabr£z,
and was later copied by another Jacobite priest, Ibr¡h£m b. Shamm¡s
<Abd-All¡h, in ¥isn Kayf¡ (a village on the Tigris in Iraq), 954 A.H./1547
C.E.129 While it preserves many Diatessaronic readings, the Persian
Harmony was composed in a different sequence than in the other Diates-
saron exemplars. It is perhaps more accurate to speak of the Persian Di-
atessaron as a Gospel Harmony, independent of the Diatessaron itself
and direct translations from it.130 Because of the fact that it is an illumi-
nated manuscript, the Persian Diatessaron, in all likelihood, was in-
tended for liturgical use.131

A remarkable specimen of a Christian liturgy in New Persian is still
in use today. Within the East Syrian “Assyrian” and Chaldean liturgies
are the vestiges of a lost Persian Christian liturgy. These fragments are
found in the Feast of Epiphany, midnight office. (See Appendix, “Frag-
ments of a Lost Persian Christian Liturgy,” infra.)

From this all-too-brief survey, it is clear that Persian Christianity
had successfully evangelized a number of ethnic Iranians. A recent doc-
toral dissertation has argued for a certain affinity between Persian
Christianity and Zoroastrianism. In his Narsai and the Persians: A Study

in Cultural Contact and Conflict, William Sunquist argues that this af-
finity may account for some of the missionary success of East Syrian
Christianity in Persia.132 In addition to the East Syrians, Armenian
Christians had also translated scripture into New Persian, evidently for
missionary purposes.133 This shows that, while Persian was not a Chris-
tian literary language as such, it was a Christian vernacular. It was in-
strumental in missionary endeavors in the Christian Orient. While there
were a number of other significant mission fields, not the least of which
was India, Tibet, Ceylon, as well as China134 (evangelized beginning in
635, according to the Syriac and Chinese stele of Xi’an (Hsian), linguistic
contact between Syriac and Middle and New Persian had been estab-
lished. Added to this is the extensive literature in Christian Arabic dur-
ing the Islamic period, providing the means and opportunity for the
transmission and eventual transformation of Syriac Christian symbol-
ism, as taken up in the post-Christian religions of Islam and the Bah¡’£
Faith.

Fragments of a Lost Persian Christian Liturgy
Preserved in the literary amber of the East Syrian ¥∞∑r¡ are four
fragments from a lost Persian Christian liturgy, “discovered” by F. C.
Conybeare, described by A. J. Maclean, and translated by D. S. Margo-
liouth (vide infra). The text is from the Feast of Epiphany, midnight of-
fice.135 Margoliouth’s translation is worked into Maclean’s rendering of
the Syriac liturgy known as “The Night Service”—“Of the Holy Feast of
the Epiphany of Our Lord,” found in a Syriac Gazza (“Treasury”)136—a
compilation that contains excerpts from various liturgies, including the
text known as the ¥∞∑r¡ (“Cycle”),137 traditionally (but erroneously) as-
cribed to Ephrem.138 Following this night service, bearing the four Per-

Both transliterated text and translation of this rather unique fossil
are given below. Added to the Turfan Psalter and related texts in Middle
Persian, these fragments—in a dialect of New Persian—provide further
evidence of an indigenous Iranian Christian heritage, in which ethnic
Persian converts comprised the most visible minority in the East Syrian
Church of the East.

This translation differs slightly from Margoliouth’s previous one pub-
lished two years prior in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society. There,
these four fragments are interpreted as follows: “(1) I looked to every
side: I saw that security is bound up with Christianity. The pure religion
is Christ’s. (2) Thou eatest, thou buyest, thou sellest, thou revilest, thou
takest [not?] the right way. The pure religion is Christ’s. (3) I am the
friend of Christ. Bid me fear noone [sic]. I remove trouble from the road.
The pure religion is Christ’s. (4) Thou art baptized in the name of the Fa-
ther and the Son and the Holy Ghost: Thou art holy, a Christian: And
thou dost bestow on us.”143

Epiphany is a major Christian festival. It is celebrated on January
6th, the traditional date of Christmas now observed throughout the East-
ern Christian traditions. On this date, Ephrem writes: “The number six is
also perfect; / on the sixth of January Your birth gave joy to the six direc-
tions” (Nat. XXVII.3).144 In the Eastern Church, Epiphany recalls Christ’s
baptism in the river Jordan. In the Western Church, however, Epiphany
commemorates the revelation of Christ to the Gentiles, in the homage of
the Magi. Ephrem himself speaks of the Magi: “Fire approved of Your
birth to drive worship away by it. / The Magi used to worship [fire]—they

worshipped You!” (Nat. XXII.13).145 In the Syriac liturgy translated by
Maclean, the Wise Men are explicitly related to Persia and to Zoroaster:
“And he sent a star : to Persia, and called the Wise men : and guided
them by its light : until it stood over the cave. • And the Wise men came :
honoured men and chiefs : twelve sons of noble kings : who brought con-
secrated offerings. • Gold and myrrh : and frankincense as for the hon-
our : of the King who was wondrously born : of a virgin whom man had
not known. • They opened their treasures : and offered to him their of-
ferings : as they were commanded by their Teacher : Zoroaster, who
prophesied to them. •”146 The earliest Christian traditions that explicitly
ascribe the visit of the Magi as a response to a prophecy by Zoroaster ap-
pear to have originated in Persia. Anchoring the Epiphany service in a
Persian context still does little to soften the impact of a sudden and re-
markable intrusion of Persian in a Syriac liturgy.

The canon for this service is a passage from the “Song of Moses”
(Deut. 32:21b–43). The scripture immediately preceding the first interpo-
lated Persian verse is Deut. 33:40b–41a: “I said, I live for ever : I will
whet the edge of my sword like lightning.” Following the first Persian
verse, Deut. 33:41b is cited. After the second Persian verse, Deut. 33:42a
is intoned: “And I will deliver up mine adversaries : I will make mine ar-
rows drunk with blood.” At the end of the third Persian verse, Deut.
33:43a is given. Finally, after the fourth Persian verse, the final words of
Moses in the “Song of Moses” are recited. The biblical context is clearly
that of vengeance on enemies. This is possibly an allusion to persecutions
of Christians by Zoroastrians. In any case, this Persian liturgy is obvi-
ously the product of a minority.147

One possible Zoroastrian element in these stanzas might be inferred
from references to the “Pure Religion” (NP: d£n-i p¡k) of Christ, as op-

posed to the “Good Religion” (MP: weh-d™n) of Zarathuåtra.148 The text in
stanza 2, line 3, must certainly be: “Take the right [or, true] path” (r¡h-i
r¡st big£r£). It is an attested Zoroastrian Middle Persian expression, as in
the Greater Bundahiån XXVI: 12–18: “A man in whose thinking the wis-
dom of Wahman resides, that wise spirit shows him the right way (r¡h-i
r¡st). Through the right way (r¡h-i r¡st) he knows the will of the Creator.
By performing the will of the Creator he increases and proclaims him
who will cause the Resurrection through the goodness of the Renova-
tion.”149 Stanza 3, line 3 could be of critical importance for the interpreta-
tion of these four passages, if, contrary to Margoliouth, it can be read as
a formula for the abjuration of Zoroastrianism.

The dating of this text is problematic. Margoliouth was convinced of
its “high antiquity” (pre-Islamic period). If so, Persianists would no doubt
agree that these fragments “possess an almost unique interest.”150 The
presence of rhyme, however, is telling. There is no attestation of rhyme
in Middle Persian or New Persian prior to the ninth century.151 A key

piece of evidence for a later dating based on the presence of rhyme comes
from the tenth-century writer ¥amza al-Ißf¡h¡n£, speaking of Persian
poetry, reports: “These are poems all composed in a single metre (taj£’u

verse by the fact that they are composed in regular metres (wa-hiya

it by the fact that they have no rhyme.”152

Conybeare discovered the Persian liturgy in a thirteenth-century
manuscript of the ¥u∑r¡. Macomber has made a list of known manu-
scripts of the ¥u∑r¡.153 The compilation of the ¥u∑r¡ is traditionally
ascribed to the Catholicós Patriarch Iåo<yahb III of Adiabene (649–659
C.E.) and his collaborator, the monk <Enaniåo<,154 in the year 650/651
C.E. The theological value of the ¥u∑r¡ for the study of East Syrian
spirituality is second only to the Persian Synods.155 True as this is in
terms of a formalized theology, the service of the ¥u∑r¡ may in fact be a
truer reflection of popular theology, as Macomber is careful to point out:
“The writings of theologians may provide an intellectually better articu-
lated and reasoned exposition of this theology, but it is one that is far
removed from the living consciousness of the ordinary clergy and faith-
ful. The liturgical chants, on the other hand, have had a direct, formative
influence on all capable of understanding them and have had in some
ways the same role in the Chaldean Church that catechisms have had in
