‘Abdul-Bahá on Human Evolution

Ramin Neshati

Overview

The essential harmony of science and religion is an
underpinning belief of the Bahá’í Faith. 1 Indeed, few are the
established world religions whose sacred literature and
teachings so vigorously promote unbiased and unfettered
scientific inquiry as does the Bahá’í Faith. For Bahá’ís, the
absence of this foundational principle reduces religion to a
mere set of superstitions, bankrupt beliefs and ruinous rituals.
Bahá’í teachings laud science and reason as indispensable
complements to faith and spirituality, and Bahá’ís believe that
religion must at all times conform to science and reason.2
Intelligence and erudition gained through scientific pursuits
cannot, therefore, be discordant with mystical proclivity and
the pursuit of spirituality. ‘Abdul-Bahá, the eldest son and
appointed successor of Bahá’u’lláh, the prophet-founder of the
Bahá’í religion, elucidated the central importance of the
principle of the harmony of science and religion in talks and
speeches delivered to diverse Western audiences a century ago.3

The premise of the essential harmony of science and religion
gives rise to a plethora of thought-provoking and troubling
uncertainties for many scientists. The notion that science and
religion can somehow be harmonized is not universally
accepted by the scientific community, primarily since abstract
notions such as spirituality do not lend themselves to the
scientific method of inquiry. 4 For centuries scientists have
investigated and debated vexing questions such as the manner
and timing of the formation of the cosmos and the origin of
mankind. The existence, or not, of an omniscient,
transcendent entity called God has always been at the center of
these debates. In fact, throughout history, many a renowned
scientist, philosopher and soothsayer has given life and limb in
these quests but today the same incommodious questions

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                     296

remain the subject of heated arguments among scientists and
religionists of all persuasions, from the occident to the orient.
Most modern scientists leave no room for a divinely-inspired
creative force nor do they see a need for anything but chance or
accident as sufficient rationalization for the universe and all
living beings therein. While the scientific community has
progressively converged around Evolution and the Big Bang
theories to explain the origins of mankind and the formation
of the cosmos, respectively, the Bahá’í teachings (as well as
those of other religions) unequivocally affirm and attribute
these events to divine will. Importantly, Bahá’í teachings
accommodate intra-species evolution as a matter of growth
and refinement, yet the notion that mankind somehow evolved
from some other species, such as the ape life form, is spurned.

Bahá’ís deem humanity as having been inimitably created by
God as “the most noble” of all species. Further, the human
species has been uniquely endowed with spiritual
susceptibilities and intellectual faculties. In the Hidden
Words, Bahá’u’lláh affirms “… I have created thee rich,” or “…
noble have I created thee,” or “… I knew my love for thee;
therefore I created thee,” this notion is referred to throughout
the Writings.5 The Bahá’í viewpoint maintains that the divinely
endowed gifts of spirituality and intellect elevate humankind
above all other creation and equip him to solve complex and
confounding conundrums. Through these gifts alone mankind
is able to discern and discover the world of existence and to
unlock its inscrutable wonders. Advocating creationism—the
belief in a deity as the creator of the earth, imminently involved
and ready to intervene when necessary—is not unique to the
Bahá’í religion. 6 This belief has been upheld by many schools of
philosophy, various secular and spiritual movements as well as
the Semitic religious traditions of Judaism, Christianity and
Islam, which hold in common the belief in monotheism, the
reality of a hereafter and the interminable tension between
good and evil in earthly existence. Nonetheless, it cannot escape
our attention that belief in creationism has been seriously
strained by the scientific community’s reliance on the post-
Darwinian concepts of natural selection and inter-species
transmutation as the inexorable explanations for the origin of
the human life form on earth. While Bahá’í teachings roundly
reject the notion that mankind evolved from some other
species, the scientific community assiduously supports and
substantiates Darwinian evolutionary theories in its quest to
unravel this ultimate conundrum. 7

Man is Man                                                    297

What can be made of this seeming dogmatic dichotomy
between science and religion? Were we inimitably created
through “intelligent design” in the image of God or did we
randomly and through chance alone evolve from the ape life
form? Are creatures and species purposeless in their existence
or is there an immutable divine plan at work, lending function
and purpose to life? Such inquiries are yet to be conclusively
assuaged and reconciled despite momentous advances in
scientific knowledge and philosophical wisdom since the mid-
nineteenth century when the British scientist Charles Darwin
(1809-1882) first published his theories and explanations on
human origin and evolution.8 Here, we will review some of the
salient statements of ‘Abdul-Bahá on the necessity of the
agreement between science and religion and examine their
significance as they pertain to the disentanglement of the
mystery surrounding the origin of mankind. Many of the
explanations ‘Abdul-Bahá provided on this and related topics
can be found in the collection of semi-private talks he gave to
Laura Clifford Barney in Akka, Palestine during 1904-1906. The
notes from these eclectic talks were authenticated by ‘Abdul-
Bahá himself and subsequently translated and published by
Barney circa 1908 in London under the title Some Answered
Questions. In the foreword to the 1981 edition of this
collection, the publisher comments on ‘Abdul-Bahá’s style of
discourse as “treading the mystical path with practical feet”
and affirms ‘Abdul-Bahá’s explanations of the origin,
development and purpose for human existence as
substantiation of the Bahá’í principle of the harmony of
science and religion. (SAQ) This paper, whose aim is to induce
more questions than conclusions, is dedicated to the centenary
commemoration of this notable publication, and is offered as
an enticement for further study by interested students and
scholars of the Bahá’í Faith.

Religion, Science and Darwinian Evolutionary Thought

Scientists subject conjectures, hypotheses and theories to
observable, empirical, measurable and persistent proofs. This
is the essence of the scientific method and it brooks no
deviation from absolute objectivity in observation,
measurement and analysis. But how are such proofs to be
tendered for faith-based convictions? Can a religious code of
beliefs lend itself to dispassionate scientific inquiry? One of
the intractable realities that inevitably crops up in a discourse

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                     298

on science and religion is the inherently distinct spheres,
respectively, of human cognition and human emotion, to
which they appeal. Religion has a close affinity with the realm
of authority and power, while science is closely aligned with the
realms of logic and reason. 9 Can these seemingly incongruent
realms be reconciled or harmonized? Bahá’í teachings endeavor
to bridge the gulf between scientific analysis and religious
belief by underscoring the complementarity and the
interdependence of these distinct realms. For a Bahá’í there is
not a choice between science or religion; rather, they seek a
blend of both. This is a crucial point to bear in mind as we
explore the tension between science and religion over the hotly
debated topic of the origin of mankind. This issue also lies at
the heart of the as-yet unsettled difference of opinion between
scientific and faith-based communities over the reality of an
omniscient, transcendent creator.

For a fuller understanding of Charles Darwin’s theory of
evolution, which itself has evolved over time, it is instructive
to examine the essence of his initial observations and
inferences. In his seminal and ground-breaking work On the
Origin of Species, published in 1859 to great acclaim, he
attempts to document the manner in which living organisms
grow and adapt to their environments through a process called
natural selection. 10 This is the process wherein genetic
inheritances vary through successive generations to facilitate
the survival and flourishing of the species in their natural
habitats. The innate competition for survival is at the root of
Darwin’s theory of evolution. Food, climate, habitat and social
forces such as alliances or wars are some of the key
determinants of survival. Each generation survives the
challenges imposed by these forces through adoption of or
adaptation to its new-found ecosystem. Furthermore,
environmental conditions can also engender the appearance or
the disappearance of physical behaviors, bodily organs or other
acclimatization necessary for the survival of the species.
Darwin deemed the process of natural selection to be random
and uncoordinated, yet the result appears to be anything but
haphazard, remarkably efficient and in step with the exigencies
of survival. Darwin went to great lengths to explain the origin
and transformations of various living organisms such as
plants, insects and birds. He deduced that continued self-
fertilization was not conducive to survival since organisms
could not retain sufficient genetic variability to survive
sudden or harsh environmental alterations. He posited that the

Man is Man                                                   299

current forms and conditions of many species had traversed
through the process of natural selection via several stages of
transmutations from only a few common ancestors. Through
observation, meticulous record keeping and field work, Darwin
concluded that beneficial gene variants survived randomly by
means of, and perhaps because of, environmental exigencies.
As a consequence, useful genetic information survived and was
passed down through the generations resulting in inter-
relatedness of various organisms and species, all of which was
dictated by the notion of the survival of the fittest. 11 He
concluded that adaptation to changing environmental
conditions result in the variations seen in different species.
One of Darwin’s significant findings, and later confirmed by
functionalist evolutionary biologists such as Dawkins, is that
evolution is a slow and gradual process. It requires the passage
of decades, if not centuries, for an evolved state to take hold,
reach equilibrium with its environment and become
noticeable. 12 This important concept will be explored more
fully later in the paper.

While he was not the first scientist to put forward such
claims, the scale and the consequences of Darwin’s inferences,
especially his hypotheses on the evolution of the human species,
published in 1871 in The Descent of Man, reverberated through
the sanctuaries of science and the hallowed halls of established
religions.13 Darwin’s publications sent trembles through the
world of science and his swelling coterie of supporters
shattered age-old conviction in creationism and essentialist
biology that had heretofore held sway over much of human
civilization, philosophy and scientific inquiry. His intimation
that homo sapiens transmuted from the pre-existing ape life
form was particularly controversial in his lifetime and
continues to be so to the present. Why is his theory on the
origin of the human species pregnant with such controversy?
Most people of faith find the acquiescence to Darwinian
evolutionary thought to be untenable precisely because this
theory obviates the need for a divine and transcendent creator.
The role of God, if this abstract concept can be accommodated
in Darwinian thought at all, is relegated to that of a remote,
disinterested, disempowered entity. This is anathema to most
religionists. Darwin left no room for divine intervention in the
world of existence. Neither did he allow for any special purpose
for creation. He famously was “… inclined to looking at
everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details,
whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                     300

call chance.”14 Being at first bound for the comfortable life of a
priest, Darwin was marginally content with the idea of a
creative God, his later agnosticism notwithstanding. It is the
trust, however tenuous, in “designed laws” that will be explored
further in this paper for potential congruence to Bahá’í beliefs.
Over time, the influence exerted by Darwinian evolutionary
thinking has progressively permeated nearly all branches of
science.

Evolution or Revolution?

A brief chronological review of a select sampling of
scientific    and     philosophical      excogitations      and
accomplishments in the decades leading up to Darwin may
prove instructive in better appreciating the magnitude of his
contributions to the world of science. For brevity, we will
confine our cursory survey to influential Western thinkers.

The 16th -century physicist, philosopher and father of modern
science, Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), audaciously set forth
scientific inquiry to explain the nature of the universe despite
severe oppression and forced recantation imposed on him by
the Catholic Church. His support of the Copernican notion of
the heliocentricity of the universe was abhorrent to the Pope
and the society of his time, which were deeply ingrained in the
Aristotelian belief in geocentricism. Yet, Galileo’s
contributions to astronomy, physics and mathematics paved
the way for many important findings and discoveries both
during and after his lifetime. 15 Galileo’s scientific findings
were as ground-breaking and world-shattering as those
proposed by Darwin. Following on Galileo’s heels, consider
Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716), philosopher, mathematician,
inventor of calculus and the binary system, and perhaps one of
the greatest rationalists and a superlative intellect of his time.
It is said that Leibniz wrote a proof for the existence of God
and shared it with Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677), his
contemporary philosopher and proponent of epistemology. 16
Leibniz’ philosophy comprehended a pre-established harmony
which he attributed to a perfect being. Spinoza, widely
acknowledged as having ushered in the dawn of the
Enlightenment in Europe that set off a revolution resulting in
many advancements in the arts and sciences, was largely in
agreement with Leibniz. However, Spinoza was inclined to
equate God with nature and believed that humans were
emanations of that natural essence. 17 Although Spinoza was

Man is Man                                                     301

derided as an atheist and a heretic for his views, yet the power
of his influence survived and grew long after his death. As with
Darwin, the thinking advanced by the likes of Leibniz and
Spinoza were radical departures from conventional wisdom
and stimulated a great deal of intellectual pursuits. Another
contemporary of Leibniz, Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727), the
physicist, mathematician and theologian, imparted to
posterity many scientific contributions such as gravity,
optics, the laws of motion and numerous other important
findings.18 Arguably, Newton can be considered as the most
prolific scientist of all time. Being a deeply religious man, he
was quick to point out that while gravity explained planetary
motion it could not explain how the planets were set in motion
in the first place. Newton believed in the existence of a
supernatural being from whose will the universe had come into
existence. Newton’s revolutionary discoveries created the
bedrock for future scientific pursuits and inventions in the
same manner that Darwin’s theories paved the way for modern-
day advances in biology and genetics research.

Following Newton, the 18th -century philosopher and logician
Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) eloquently argued for the existence
of God, freedom and immortality as the necessities of human
life. Kant proposed that scientific reasoning was limited, and
thus one could not firmly prove or disprove the existence of
God. Such an “intelligible unity” could only be proved with
practical intent, as if there be a God. 19 Kant is considered to be
one of the giants in the world of philosophy and is said to have
greatly influenced later philosophers such as Hegel,
Schopenhauer and others. Finally, Kant’s contemporary
astronomer and mathematician, Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749-
1827), rose to become one of the greatest scientists of all time.
Laplace is considered to be the father of probability theory,
statistics and of Scientific Determinism — a set of precise laws
that explain the evolution of the universe. 20 While Laplace
could convincingly argue and establish the evolution of the
universe, yet he found himself at a loss to explain its initial
state; reminiscent of Newton, he could not explicate how the
laws that governed the universe were chosen and instead
attributed them to an unknowable God.21 As with Darwin,
Laplace introduced revolutionary thinking within the world of
science but was unable to fully explain all of his findings and
thinking.

The common thread through this survey is clear: most of the
influential scientists and philosophers that pre-dated Darwin,

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                     302

while not in full agreement over the details, still promoted or
allowed the notion of a creative force to whose will or action
they attributed earthly existence. It remains unclear to what
extent they directly influenced Darwin’s own beliefs and
thinking. Yet, the upshot of Darwinian theories pertaining to
evolution and the origin of the human species has been nothing
short of a monumental scientific achievement, despite its
radical denial of a creative force. Although largely accepted,
Darwin’s revolutionary contributions to the world of science
remain controversial to the present.

The Limits of Science

The modern practice of science has been reduced to the
formulation of mathematical models and the administration of
empirical experiments. The process of arriving at these models
and experiments is iterative and prone to errors and false
assumptions along the way. Future generations of scientists
routinely prove their preceding peers wrong. Consider for
instance Pythagoras, the Greek philosopher, mystic and
mathematician. According to Russell, no other man “…has been
as influential as he was in the sphere of thought,” yet in recent
times he is found wanting in the “… intimate blending of
religion and reasoning, of moral aspiration with logical
admiration of what is timeless…”22 This is an ironic
observation that we will contend with later in this paper.

Is scientific thinking limiting, as Kant and others have
suggested? The scientific method is dependent on our ability to
precisely measure phenomena in a predictable and repeatable
manner. But we know from Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle
that no scientific experiment or measurement is accurate
owing to the imprecision of measuring techniques and tools. In
like manner, we know from Gödel’s incompleteness theorem
that a consistent set of axioms to prove all of mathematics is
virtually impossible.23 These examples of the limits of science
militate for caution when either scientists or religionists
advance triumphalist and absolutist claims in the effort to
prove their point or to disprove those of their opponents.
Moreover, one might legitimately ask: what animates scientific
models and mathematical equations? Indeed, why should there
be a universe for science to discover or for religion to describe
in the first place? In the words of the pre-eminent
contemporary physicist, Stephen Hawking, “… why does the
universe bother to exist?” 24 The answers to these questions are

Man is Man                                                      303

anything but clear or conclusive when viewed exclusively
through the lens of science or of religion. Scientific methods
and laws address material existence but do not admit the
existence, or accommodate the analysis, of metaphysical
abstractions. Religion can fulfill a complementary role by
providing an explanation for phenomenon that have yet to be
explained by any branch of science. Ultimately, the Bahá’í
principle of the harmony of science and religion maintains that
scientific truths must be complemented by belief in a
transcendent creator, whose will is the impetus for the
existence of the cosmos, of human life and of all other living
forms in nature.

Earlier we mentioned that evolutionary scientists insist on
randomness and chance as the inexorable explanation for
human evolution. The existence of a creative force or a plan
that could potentially regulate the cosmos and earthly life, if
not rejected outright, is seen as doubtful by many scientists. 25
Human existence can be understood as the result of
transmutation from an earlier life form, most likely the ape
species. Further, Darwinism has been embraced as “liberation
from the delusion that its [human] destiny is controlled by a
power higher than itself.”26 Judging by the rigorous
requirements of the scientific method, are there
incontrovertible proofs to these assertions? While science is on
the march to uncover these claims, more recently some
scientists have suggested that the extent of genetic change
through natural selection is too narrow a concept to be
scientifically useful since there has not been a sufficient
passage of time to conclusively establish the evolution of
complex species from single cells. 27 Even so, there is a growing
body of evidence that seeks to substantiate the evolution of
multi-cellular organisms by tracking changes in proteins and
enzymes through time, and to map the formation of these
organisms from the fusion of single cells. 28 Interestingly,
Collins has compressed 4.5 billion years of evolutionary life
into a 24-hour span of time to drive home the need for
temporal perspective in better understanding cellular
evolution. From the diagram below, adapted from Collins, we
can get an appreciation of our collective proximity to the
proverbial trees (and in our inability to clearly see the forest):29

In this diagram, the earth was formed at midnight, the first
emanations of life forms appeared sometime around 3:30 past
midnight, and the Cambrian explosion occurred at 9:00 in the
evening, suggesting a relatively long passage of time for the
progression of multi-cellular organisms. Following the
appearance and extinction of dinosaurs, mammals began to
diverge into different life forms sometime around 11:58 at
night. Modern man appeared a minute before midnight. Notice
that in relative terms only a minute has transpired from the
inception of human life to today. Recall also that most
scientists are agreed that the Darwinian concept of natural
selection is a gradual phenomenon and can be subject to many
divergent outcomes through time. Given that in relative terms
we have not yet witnessed a sufficient passage of time to draw
definitive conclusions about the evolution of the species,
especially the human life form, is it plausible to only rely on
scientific explanation for the origin of mankind or the manner
of the formation of the cosmos? Can theology provide
complementary, not contradictory, clarifications? It is
precisely in this context that the Bahá’í belief in the harmony of
science and religion seeks to unify scientific truth with
religious certainty to arrive at a more nuanced and
sophisticated resolution to some of these as-yet unsolved
mysteries. Let us consider ‘Abdul-Bahá’s elucidations.

‘Abdul-Bahá on Human Evolution

‘Abdul-Bahá endorsed the concept of human evolution. He,
of course, spoke of intra-species refinement and growth, not
inter-species transmutation. (SAQ)30 Human evolution is not
only accepted but seen as necessary. The earth presents a
dynamic habitat, constantly prone to gradual or sudden

changes. To survive in frequently changing environments,
species must adapt and evolve. Moreover, for any species to
reach its full potential, it must go through various stages of
development and growth. At each stage, organisms evolve by
maturing physically, mentally, emotionally, socially, and so on.
To establish this point, ‘Abdul-Bahá cited the example of the
acorn. Its potential is to one day be an oak tree. It cannot take
on any other form of life. To reach its destiny, it must sprout,
be nourished and survive the hazards of growth to one day
reach its full form: an oak tree. In like manner, a human zygote
necessarily evolves to an embryo and later into a fetus until it
is born as a human child. Even after birth, humans evolve as
they pass through various phases of physical, mental and
spiritual growth. Consider the following passage which speaks
to the uniqueness of the human life form:

> But from the beginning of man’s existence he is a
> distinct species. In the same way, the embryo of man in
> the womb of the mother was at first in a strange form;
> then this body passes from shape to shape, from state
> to state, from form to form, until it appears in utmost
> beauty and perfection. But even when in the womb of
> the mother and in this strange form, entirely different
> from his present form and figure, he is the embryo of
> the superior species, and not of the animal; his species
> and essence undergo no change. (SAQ)
According to ‘Abdul-Bahá, nothing in this world attains
perfection at once; evolution is a necessary condition for any
species to reach its pre-ordained destiny. He explained that
humanity and human civilization continually evolve. Culture,
industry and technology are ready testaments to human
evolution, refinement and growth. Yet, ‘Abdul-Bahá insisted
that man is a unique species and that the human essence is
unshared by any other life form. He affirmed that God’s
greatest gift to man is the intellect through which he can
understand and conquer nature, all other creatures being bereft
of this gift and thus captives of nature. He found the
suggestion that many life forms roamed the planet before
humans, the so-called pre-existence contention, as a weak and
unsustainable argument to rationalize or prove the
transmutation of the human life form from another species.
Consider the following passage that speaks to this point:

> …the animal having preceded man is not a proof of the
> evolution, change and alteration of the species, nor

> that man was raised from the animal world to the
> human world. For while the individual appearance of
> these different beings is certain, it is possible that man
> came into existence after the animal. So when we
> examine the vegetable kingdom, we see that the fruits of
> the different trees do not arrive at maturity at one
> time; on the contrary, some come first and others
> afterward. This priority does not prove that the later
> fruit of one tree was produced from the earlier fruit of
> another tree. (SAQ)
> In recent times, scientists have shown that certain animals
posses the rudiments of intelligence such as the acquisition and
use of language or equivalent modes of communication, the
development and application of tools, the establishment of
social order and so on. Nonetheless the human intellect is, by
orders of magnitude, greater than all other animals. Dividing
the world of creation into the realms of the human, the animal,
the vegetable and the mineral, ‘Abdul-Bahá stated that humans
embody the combined attributes of animals, vegetables and
minerals. Still, while all created beings may be endowed with
spirit only humans possess the rational spirit, or soul. Human
intellect is an emanation of the soul and scientific
accomplishments are outcomes of the human intellect. Praising
science as “most noble and praiseworthy,” ‘Abdul-Bahá
affirmed that of all creation only humans could master nature
through science. Consider the following passage which
illuminates man’s primacy over nature:

> All creation, preceding Man, is bound by the stern law
> of Nature. The great sun, the multitudes of stars, the
> oceans and seas, the mountains, the rivers, the trees,
> and all animals, great or small — none is able to evade
> obedience to nature’s law. (SAQ)
He asserted that man was the sum of all perfections and that
“… in him there is an ideal power surpassing nature.” (SAQ)
Thus, humankind is elevated above all other creation. To
further differentiate between humans and other living
organisms, ‘Abdul-Bahá envisioned two distinct pathways for
existence: material and spiritual. The former He termed as the
realm of the animal, devoid of intelligence and incapable of
knowing God, while the latter He deemed as destined for
mankind, a source of ethics and enlightenment and capable of
bestowing the knowledge of God. (SAQ) In treading the
spiritual path and perfecting his nature, mankind can

approach God by exhibiting divine attributes such as justice,
mercy, love, truthfulness and kindness. But when the
development of his spiritual nature is neglected or
subordinated to the pursuit of material progress, he is apt to
plunge into waywardness. ‘Abdul-Bahá cautioned against the
prevailing impulse in society of denying the inner spiritual
powers innate in human beings. This tendency, He lamented,
would lead mankind to dismiss his destiny and to consent to
the realm of the animal, thereby becoming a captive of nature.
Consider the following passage:

> One of the strangest things witnessed is that the mater-
> ialists of today are proud of their natural instincts and
> bondage. They state that nothing is entitled to belief
> and acceptance except that which is sensible or tangible.
> By their own statements they are captives of nature …
> If this be a virtue, the animal has attained it to a
> superlative degree, for the animal is absolutely ignorant
> of the realm of spirit and out of touch with the inner
> world of conscious realization. The animal would agree
> with the materialist in denying the existence of that
> which transcends the senses. If we admit that being
> limited to the plane of the senses is a virtue, the animal
> is indeed more virtuous than man, for it is entirely
> bereft of that which lies beyond, absolutely oblivious
> of the Kingdom of God and its traces, whereas God has
> deposited within the human creature an illimitable
> power by which he can rule the world of nature. (PUP)
For Bahá’ís, therefore, the development of mankind’s
material temperament must transpire in tandem with the
development of its spiritual disposition. This balance is crucial
as it alone can facilitate the realization of man’s true potential
and the fulfillment of his purpose for being created.
Addressing the inevitable question that arises from a
consideration of creationism, ‘Abdul-Bahá deduced that a
creator without a creation was impossible. He argued that
since the universe was created, there therefore had to be a
creator. He further argued that the order inherent in the
universe was neither accidental nor necessary. Rather, it was
voluntary and willful. He explains:

> The first thing to emanate from God is that universal
> reality which the philosophers of the past termed the
> First Intellect, and which the people of Bahá call the
> Primal Will. (SAQ)

‘Abdul-Bahá unambiguously held that a transcendent creator
willed the universe and all of creation into being. He explained
that the universe was, and will ever be, governed by eternal laws
bequeathed by God. In sharp contrast to Darwinian
evolutionary thought, ‘Abdul-Bahá taught that the human life
form was original and unique, that it had a pre-ordained
purpose and that it was not a mere outcome of accident or
chance. Since the universe was created by a perfect creator,
creation itself had to be perfect and complete. As mentioned
earlier, ‘Abdul-Bahá upheld intra-species evolution as
incontrovertible and necessary for the human species to achieve
its pre-ordained destiny. This passage sums up his vision on the
origin and form of human beings:

> To recapitulate: as man in the womb of the mother
> passes from form to form, from shape to shape,
> changes and develops, and is still the human species
> from the beginning of the embryonic period—in the
> same way man, from the beginning of his existence in
> the matrix of the world, is also a distinct species—that

Conclusion

The Bahá’í principle of the harmony of science and religion
intends to find common ground between the domains of
science and religion. Bahá’í teachings hold that human beings
belong to a pre-ordained, unique life form that trumps all
others and which interacts with an organic universe in
accordance with a divine plan. Evolution is not only accepted
but seen as a necessity for humans and other species to reach
their full and destined potential. Human evolution is within
the species, however, and does not derive from or span to other

forms of life. ‘Abdul-Bahá maintained that the notions of
creation and evolution were complementary, not mutually
exclusive. This belief lies at the root of the Bahá’í principle of
the harmony of science and religion.

It should be noted that ‘Abdul-Bahá’s teachings were
tendered as philosophical viewpoints and not as scientific
verities.31 Thus, they cannot be evaluated with the prevailing
standards of science. His teachings and explanations, perhaps,
can be best understood and internalized as articles of faith.
Since faith requires the suspension of disbelief and the
unquestioned acceptance of scientifically improvable
metaphysical abstractions such as a transcendent divinity or
the human soul, these concepts will continue to remain chasms
to bridge for most scientifically trained minds. The religious
teaching that man is more than a mere physical being, that he is
essentially spiritual in nature, does not permit the unequivocal
acceptance of Darwinian evolutionary hypotheses as they are
understood today. The implications of an ad-hoc universe
without a creator and a divine plan that animates and gives
purpose to life are untenable to most people of faith, Bahá’ís
included. So, how can science and spirituality truly be
reconciled? Is it possible in the absence of faith and reason?
Many such questions are yet to be assuaged and although we
may not have satisfactory answers to these queries, one thing
we do know: human evolution and the transmutation of species
will likely remain a hotly debated topic for some time to come.
