## The Bahá'í Faith and the Perennial Mystical Quest: A Western Perspective

### by [Julio Savi](https://bahai-library.com/author/Julio+Savi)

published in [_Bahá'í Studies Review_](https://bahai-library.com/series/BSR), 14, pages 5-22  
London: Association for Baha'i Studies English-Speaking Europe, 2007-12


> **Abstract:** The author analyses a definition of mysticism formulated by William Ralph Inge and western ideas on mystical experience. Then he proceeds to discuss mysticism as an intrinsic aspect of the Bahá'í Faith and mystical experience as expounded in the Bahá'í writings. The latter pay greater attention to the practical and logical aspects of mysticism than to the visionary and illogical ones. The author examines some of the reasons for Bahá'í and non-Bahá'í criticism of mysticism and suggests a Bahá'í definition of mysticism. He then attempts to describe the Bahá'í mystical path, as expounded by the Universal House of Justice.
