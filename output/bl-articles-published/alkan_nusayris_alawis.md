Abstract
Based on their writings, the religious beliefs of the Nuṣayrīs have been studied
since the 19th century. But historical knowledge and information about them in
the 19th century, based on Ottoman sources has been rather meager. Only in recent
years this kind of research intensiﬁed. In the Ottoman Empire real interest in the
Nuṣayrīs started during the reign of Sultan Abdülhamid II (1876-1909). Due to

* is research began during my senior fellowship in 2008-2009 at the Research Center
for Anatolian Civilizations (RCAC), Koç University, Istanbul. I owe a heartfelt gratitude
to the RCAC for the ﬁnancial support and encouragement. I am grateful to Mrs. Duygu
Paçalı, the RCAC librarian, for her constant help with providing literature. My research
has then continued in 2009-2011 at the Chair for the History of West Asia, University of
Erfurt/Germany (ﬁnanced by the Bosch Foundation); I would like to thank Prof. Birgit
Schäbler and the doctoral students for their remarks at our colloquia. Furthermore, I am
particularly beholden to Prof. Dror Zeevi (Ben Gurion University of Negev/BGU), Prof.
Şükrü Hanioğlu (Princeton University), Prof. Meir M. Bar-Asher (e Hebrew University
of Jerusalem) and Dr. Markus Dressler (Istanbul Teknik Üniversitesi) for reading earlier
versions of my paper and making valuable comments. During the World Congress for Middle
Eastern Studies (WOCMES) in Barcelona/Spain, 19-24 July 2010, I shared parts of this
paper at the “Late Ottoman/Post-Ottoman Heterodox Communities” panel that
I co-organized; my lecture was titled “‘Appropriate objects of christian benevolence?’
Protestant Missionaries, the Nusayris and the Ottomans”. I am grateful to my co-panelists
Dr. Laila Prager, Dr. Sebastian Maisel and Edip Gölbaşı, and the audience for their remarks.
Lastly, I had the opportunity to share a shorter version of this paper titled “e Nusayri
Awakening in the Late 19th Century” at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (28 February

roughout the centuries the Nuṣayrīs (ʿAlawīs), Arabic-speaking
members of a gnostic sect with roots in Shīʿī Islam, who had been living
in Ottoman Syria (present-day South Turkey and Syria), have kept their
faith secret by living in seclusion owing to fear of persecution by the
Sunnī Orthodoxy. e religious beliefs of the Nuṣayrīs have been
studied since the 19th century, based on their writings that are now
extant in European libraries.1 Historical knowledge and information
about the Nuṣayrīs in the 19th century, based on Ottoman sources has
been rather meager. Only in recent years this kind of research intensi-
ﬁed.2

Knowledge of the Nuṣayrīs and similar groups (such as the Druze
and the Yezidis) in modern times began with Western travellers, orien-
talists and missionaries, starting in the late 18th century. ese secret
sects were studied for learned purposes, sometimes to bring them into
the fold of Christianity but also to ﬁnd ways how to exploit them
against the Ottomans politically. In the Ottoman Empire real interest
in the Nuṣayrīs started during the reign of Sultan Abdülhamid II (1876-
1909). e fear of inﬁltration of heterodox Muslims by foreigners,
especially by American and English Protestant missionaries, pressed the
Sultan to attract them by educative means to the oﬃcial Ḥanafī-Sunnī
school. In this process, the status of the Nuṣayrīs changed during the
late 19th century as a result of the missionary attempt to convert them
and the Ottoman fear that they would become another “European
problem” for them to deal with. A ﬁght for the Nuṣayrī soul began that
left them changed.

Before I discuss these eﬀorts by the missionaries and the Ottoman
counter-propaganda, I will summarize the attitude of the provincial
Syrian administration and of Istanbul toward the Nuṣayrīs in the ﬁrst
decades of the 19th century, before the Tanzimat (“reform”) period

(1839-1876). Following this I will provide an overview of the develop-
ments regarding the Nuṣayrīs during the Tanzimat and the Hamidian
era until roughly the Young Turk revolution.

Overall, in this paper we will look into the missionary and Ottoman
attitude toward the Nuṣayrīs and examine topics such as resistance,
assimilation, integration and conversion. I shall attempt to answer the
following questions: How did Protestant missionaries integrate the
Nuṣayrīs into their millenarian belief in a new social order? By what
means did the Ottoman pacifying or “civilizing” mission attempt to
integrate the Nuṣayrīs? And how did the Nuṣayrīs respond to the civi-
lizing eﬀorts of the Christian missionaries and the Ottoman state?

As I am aware that the word “Nuṣayrī” has a negative connotation,
I nevertheless use it as it appears in Ottoman documents and other
sources before 1920. It is widely accepted that only from that date
onward the Nuṣayrīs named themselves “ʿAlawīs” (followers of Imam
ʿAlī) to shake oﬀ any hint of heresy and to prove that they belong to
Shīʿī Islam, as the ﬁfth Islamic legal school. I am, however, challenging
the widely accepted view that the name “ʿAlawī” was only used after
1920\. A study of Ottoman archival documents of the late 19th century
reveals the opposite.

e Early 19th Century
e Ottoman Empire was a conglomerate of oﬃcially recognized reli-
gions as well as secretive and oﬃcially not recognized sects within and
outside Judaism, Christianity and Islam. ese sects not only concealed
their beliefs but sometimes did not accept the oﬃcial religion or main-
stream beliefs. Even though non-Sunnī religious minorities within Islam
were not regarded as non-Muslims, they were labeled “heretical” (rāfıżī)
and largely ostracized by the Sunnī clergy and people. Within the
Muslim community such “heretics” were the Shīʿīs, Alevis, Yezidis and
the Nuṣayrīs (ʿAlawīs). ese were creeds seen as deviant of the caliphal
Ḥanafī-Sunnī dynasty and had no oﬃcial status as autonomous reli-
gious communities (millet).

In the ﬁrst three decades of the 19th century we see eﬀorts of the
Ottoman administration to treat the Nuṣayrīs, alongside Yezidis and

“Kızılbaş” (the Shīʿīs of Lebanon), as political scapegoats. ey were
linked with rebellions incited by local governors in Syria or accused of
collaboration with the Greek who during their nationalist revolt in the
1820s supposedly tried to unite heterodox sects against the Muslims.
At the same time, governors in Syria, who were hostile toward each
other, showed leniency toward the Nuṣayrīs and similar groups and
proposed their paciﬁcation in an attempt to win them as allies.3

On the other hand, Nuṣayrīs especially in northern Syria, in and
around Antakya, were regarded as loyal citizens who did not engage in
banditry but pursued their living as farmers or townsmen. It appears
that the Nuṣayrīs of this region are almost not mentioned in oﬃcial
Ottoman documentation until after the second half of the 19th century.
is may have been the elegant way the Ottomans chose to allow these
people to exist and contribute to society while oﬃcially not recognizing
their religious preferences, as a way to overcome political dissonances
in their realm. But even the Nuṣayrīs of the South, living in the
Nuṣayriyya Mountains near the coast city Latakia (Lazkiye), people
who supported their insuﬃcient agricultural income with brigandage,
could appear as loyal subjects. In fact, in this period these Nuṣayrīs are
described by European travellers mostly as hard-working and peaceful
people.4 is gradually changed as a result of the Egyptian occupation
of Ottoman Syria by Mehmed Ali Pasha. His son Ibrahim Pasha became
governor of Syria and inaugurated economic, administrative and mili-
tary reforms with the aim of integrating the province into a new Egypt.
As part of his program, he began to collect the arms of the local popu-
lation and enforced general conscription.5 Consequently, insurrections
occurred, and the Nuṣayrīs incited the ﬁrst revolt against the Egyptians
in 1834;6 they not only refused to disarm and send recruits to the army

but also attacked the troops in Latakia and destroyed government build-
ings. During this decade of Egyptian rule in Syria (1831-1841), the
Ottomans supported and armed the Nuṣayrīs against Ibrahim Pasha.7
After Ibrahim Pasha and his troops left, the Nuṣayrīs used their army
experience to turn against the Ottomans. However, Ibrahim had man-
aged to break the independency of the Nuṣayrīs and fractured their
solidarity. He ensured that the diﬀerent Nuṣayrī tribes were in strife
with each other; his gold had turned Nuṣayrī against Nuṣayrī. Later,
the Ottomans were not hesitant to use this disunity to their advantage.8

Even though the Nuṣayrīs were defeated in their 1834 revolt, the
event was reported by a local Ottoman oﬃcial to the Sublime Porte in
favourable and exaggerated terms, stating that the “numerous and pow-
erful” Nuṣayrīs were strategically successful. Obviously, the writer
wanted to further local interests and emphasized that the people in
Syria wanted the Ottomans to end Egyptian occupation. e reality
was diﬀerent: whereas the traditional feudal Nuṣayrīs in their mountains
were against the Egyptian modernizing reforms and sided with the
Ottomans, the Nuṣayrīs at the Syrian coastal plain appreciated Mehmed
Ali’s eﬀorts that promised religious equality too.9 An Ottoman cam-
paign in Syria against Egypt, which parts of the Syrian population
hoped for, did not happen. e discriminatory behaviour toward the
Nuṣayrīs after the Egyptians left Syria implies that the Ottomans did
not care about their loyalty.

e pre-Tanzimat period does not only have negative aspects regard-
ing the Nuṣayrīs. ere are cases of few Nuṣayrīs who served as state
functionaries, some attaining high positions. A Nuṣayrī who was a cel-
ebrated Ottoman military oﬃcial was Kara Mehmed Pasha (d. 1828-
29), also called “Kara Cehennem” (Black Hell). A native of Antakya,
he was acting as master general of the imperial artillery (among other

functions) and is said to have bombed the Janissary barracks in 1826
during Sultan Mahmud II’s “Auspicious Event” (vaḳʿa-yı khayriyye).
While this latter attribution seems to be incorrect, it is certain that Kara
Mehmed rose to the rank of full vizier as grand admiral (kapudan-ı
deryā), “the ﬁrst and only Nuṣayrī ever to achieve that distinction”. He
is regarded as having been “foresighted” (tedbīrli) and was a source of
pride for his townsmen and apparently encouraged the migration of
Nuṣayrīs to Istanbul and Bursa.10 Kara Mehmed had failed to defend
a port in Morea during the Greek rebellion (1822) but nevertheless was
seen by Mahmud II as “illustrious and capable from among my vezirs,
and experienced, hard-working and decorated from among my splendid
ministers, in every way deserving of favour and worthy of benevolence”
and appointed as governor of the rich province of Ankara and Çankırı.11
He was married to the daughter of Halil Hamid Pasha, a former grand
vizier. is family connection obviously helped Kara Mehmed’s son
Mahmud Bey (d. 1841) to serve at the imperial chancery of state.12

Another noted Nuṣayrī oﬃcial was Mehmed Emin Vahid Efendi,
who was born in Kilis (southeastern Anatolia) and taken as a child to
Istanbul by his mother and subsequently rose to high oﬃces. He was
appointed ambassador to France by Sultan Selim III in 1806. Vahid
Efendi later became chief accountant (defter emīni) at the Imperial
Council (Dīvān-ı Hümāyūn) and was appointed governor of Hanya
(1819-1820) and Aleppo (1826-1827). He was known as Vahid
Mehmed Pasha, the title pasha given to him because he was made vizier.
Four times he held this position, but due to laxity or mismanage-
ment it was taken from him three times. Vahid Mehmed Pasha died in
1828 before he set out to Bosnia as new governor.13 Among the note-
worthy events during Vahid Efendi’s ambassadorship in Paris was his

encounter with Napoleon Bonaparte. He describes this in his Embassy
Diary (Sefāretnāme-yi Firansā).14

Kara Mehmed and Vahid Mehmed Pasha are identiﬁed by Mehmed
Süreyya (d. 1909), a biographer of Ottoman oﬃcials, as Nuṣayrīs with-
out any negative connotation. Of course one cannot be sure whether
the above mentioned Nuṣayrīs became important oﬃcials due to the
tolerance of the Ottomans or simply because they hid their Nuṣayrī
identity.

In contrast to this oﬃcial Ottoman stance is the attitude of the
famous statesman and historian Ahmed Cevdet Pasha (d. 1895) as an
example of the opinions about “heretical” groups among conservative
Muslim statesmen in the Tanzimat period. He made derogatory remarks
about his rival Fuad Pasha’s wife’s family from Antakya, writing that
although Fuad knew about her family’s too lax moral behaviours he
would remain blind to this because his wife and his father-in-law were
Nuṣayrīs and this group (ṭāʾife) did not care about morals.15 Cevdet
Pasha writes in the same vein about the Nuṣayrī in his Tārīkh-i Cevdet,
sometimes based on hearsay. He says that the Nuṣayrīs live in the moun-
tains of Syria and Tripoli, talks about their “fallacious” (bāṭıl ) creed and
ends the discussion with the Arabic expression ḥafaẓnā llāhu min shurūri
ʿaqāʾidihim (“God save us from the evils of their beliefs”).16

e Tanzimat and its Aftermath
Despite the atmosphere of proclaimed religious tolerance in the
Ottoman capital in the context of the Tanzimat reforms, the situation
in eastern provinces was diﬀerent. A major example for this was the

conﬂict between the Sunnī Ottomans and Shīʿī Iranians in Iraq. Shīʿī
clerics were actively proselytizing not only among Sunnī tribes but also
among Ottoman oﬃcials.17 During the Tanzimat but especially also in
later years the Ottomans pursued a policy of “Sunnitization” of het-
erodox communities as anti-propaganda. e aim was to indoctrinate
“heretical” sects with the orthodox doctrines of the Ḥanafī legal school.
is was called taṣḥīḥ-i ʿaqāʾid/iʿtiqād or “correction of beliefs”, in other
words, a “ﬁne tuning” of religious beliefs of those who had inherited
the idea of Islam from their ancestors and were Muslims merely by
name.18

Taṣḥīḥ-i ʿaqāʾid/iʿtiqād was not a new concept; it was already men-
tioned after the violent abolition of the Janissaries in 1826. People
identiﬁed as Bektaşis (members of a Suﬁ order with Shīʿī leanings), who
had associated with the Janissaries and led them spiritually for centuries,
were persecuted. ose who were sent into exile could enjoy amnesty,
provided that they “corrected” their beliefs and became Sunnīs.19

Being regarded as nominal Muslims, the Nuṣayrīs were target to dif-
ferent Ottoman policies. From 1840 to 1880 conﬂicts and banditry
increased in the Nuṣayriyya (Anṣāriyya) Mountains. Disagreements
between Nuṣayrī tribes were not the only cause for this. Almost every
year Ottoman troops carried out punitive expeditions in the Mountains
in order to collect taxes, disarm villagers and recruit soldiers. e moun-
taineers usually refused to pay taxes and to send their sons to the army.20

Nuṣayrīs living in the coastal plain were integrated into the provincial
administration and tied to local notables but the increase of raids by
Ottoman troops forced many of them to move northwards or to the
plains of Hums and Hama where they cultivated the lands.21 Emigra-
tion of Nuṣayrīs from south to north to the Adana-Çukurova region
seems to have commenced in the beginning of the 19th century, due to
better economic prospects and religious discrimination.22

Although the Nuṣayrīs were not seen as Muslims in terms of creed
and denied oﬃcial legal status, they were included in the Muslim mil-
let in the formal censuses, not treated as non-Muslims and did not pay
the poll-tax (jizya). In the early Ottoman period in Syria they had to
pay a capital tax (dirham al-rijāl ).23 In our period under discussion no
documents could be found conﬁrming the payment of this tax but the
fact that the Nuṣayrīs were considered apostates may have inﬂuenced
the tax assessment. e Ottomans put heavy taxes on the lands where
Nuṣayrīs worked as farmers, even though it remains unclear whether
this was based on religious grounds. eoretically, albeit Islamic law
did not tolerate apostates, it did not have a basis for an unfair ﬁscal
burden.24

Despite that the Nuṣayrīs constituted two-third of the population
in the region of Latakia and elsewhere, they did not have their repre-
sentatives in the regional council. Both Muslims and Christians disliked
them, to say the least, and opposed the idea of the oﬃcial representa-
tion of those peasants whom they regarded as hiding their beliefs, and

oﬃcers (mübaşir) and sent a letter of warning to the governor Abdulrahman Pasha, saying
that he should not oppress the people; see BOA, MD 160/73-1, mentioned by Mesut

as being rebellious and immoral. In some places such as Hama,25 Adana
and Tarsus the Nuṣayrīs were allowed by the authorities to make use of
the sharīʿa courts for legal matters (Nuṣayriler ehl-i İslām’ın ḥuḳuḳ-i
şerʿiyyesinden tamāmıyla ḥiṣṣedār olarak).26 But overall this issue remains
vague. As apostates the Nuṣayrīs had no legal rights; they could not
claim any right at the Islamic and secular regulation courts and their
testimony there was not heeded (işbu ṭāʾifenin maḥkeme-yi şerʿiyye
ve-niẓāmiyyede öteden beri şehādetleri istimāʿ ettirilmediğinden).27 It
seems that only in some cases they were allowed to witness against
Muslims and Christians.28 With the reform period and the seculariza-
tion of the civil code of laws in the Ottoman Empire, the Nuṣayrīs had
a more secure legal status. Owing to increasing European intervention,
for example in the Balkans and with the Armenians in Anatolia, and
the fear that the Great Powers could also “protect” the Nuṣayrīs, the
authorities were more inclined to include them in the Muslim millet.
Another factor in this context was the increase in missionary eﬀorts of
American Protestants among the Nuṣayrīs and similar groups especially
after the 1850s.29

e ill-treatment of the Nuṣayrīs by the majority of the population and
the authorities had aroused the compassion of Christian missionaries
who tried to win their souls. Here we will restrict ourselves to the views
and experiences of American Protestant missionaries toward the
Nuṣayrīs. When the ﬁrst two missionaries, the young reverends Pliny
Fisk and Levi Parsons, were sent to the Ottoman Empire, their chosen

aim was to convert the people to Protestant Christianity. Information
about American Protestant missionaries and their relationship with the
Nuṣayrīs is fairly accessible, ﬁrstly, through the journal e Missionary
Herald published by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign
Missions (ABCFM). e entries from the years 1819 to 1870 con-
cerning Ottoman Syria were gathered in ﬁve volumes and they reproduce
ﬁrsthand accounts.30 While these oﬀer interesting details about the daily
life of the missionaries and the people, they are limited in that they do
not always oﬀer correct historical information. is stems from the fact
that knowledge on Nuṣayrīs was sometimes acquired from biased
sources. Nevertheless, in the later decades of the 19th century mission-
aries (and historians) were able to travel and live among Nuṣayrīs and
so wrote about their experiences in letters or books.

e second source for Protestant missionaries and the Nuṣayrīs is
oﬃcial Ottoman records at the Başbakanlık Osmanlı Arşivi (Prime
Ministry’s Ottoman Archives) in Istanbul. Like the missionary journal
entries or books, they only oﬀer one side of the story—the gaze from
the Ottoman capital city.

e Protestant missionary movement was commenced for religious
purposes ﬁrst, i.e. the evangelization of the world. It is important to
understand the goal of the missionaries’ travels to various parts of the
world. As Michael Oren states in his book about the relationship of the
history of America with the Middle East, there existed from the Pilgrims
onwards within American Protestantism a strong emotional attachment
to the Israelites of the Hebrew Bible. Parallels were drawn by the Pil-
grims between their experiences and those narrated in the Bible, such
as the crossing of the Israelites of the Red Sea to escape from the oppres-
sion of the Pharaoh in Egypt, likewise did the Pilgrims cross the Atlan-
tic to be far away from King George’s England.31 is respect for the

(BFMPC); see ibid., vol. 5, pp. 253-328; Kocabaşoğlu, Kendi Belgeleriyle Anadolu’daki

ancient Israelites led to a desire to convert contemporary Jews in order
to bring them into the “correct” fold and hasten the Second Coming.

Proselytizing was the original and immediate aim of the missionary
project, albeit not the only one. With regard to the Protestant missions
Hans-Lukas Kieser writes that

> In the mid-nineteenth century, the utopia of the Protestant missionaries in
> Turkey consisted of an almost millenarian belief in a new social and symbolic
> order, promoted by their own evangelistic, educative, and civilizing eﬀorts,
> and linking their modern belief in progress with evangelical spirituality.32

is was done and inspired by the teachings of their religion and by
their patriotism for their young country, and this in turn led to a belief
that American ideals should be spread throughout the world. is was
also the basis of the Second Awakening (1800-1830), the revivalist or
millenarian religious movement that launched the ABCFM. It stressed
both a return to religion and a gloriﬁcation of American democracy
and values all over the world. However, as Parsons and Fisk set out for
their journey they believed that

> while conversions might be made elsewhere in the world, only in Palestine
> […] would they have an immediate and millennial impact. Only there would
> the Protestant’s [sic] longing to reunite with their spiritual forebears, the
> Jews, converge with their yearning for the Messiah’s reappearance.33

Even though proselytizing the Jews in the Ottoman Empire may have
been the real aim, the missionaries were not unconscious of Islam as
the dominant religion in the Ottoman Empire and that a substantial
number of non-Protestant Christian communities also lived there. Con-
sequently, the ABCFM’s representatives also hoped to convert the non-
Protestant Christians, the Muslims and the other minorities living in

the diﬀerent provinces. Owing to the lack of a formal relationship
between the USA and the Ottoman Empire, the missionaries set out
without knowing one important factor: proselytizing Muslims was
illegal in the Ottoman Empire.34 is fact probably shocked the mis-
sionaries upon their ﬁrst arrival in the Empire:

> e nature of the Turkish government may be considered unfavourable to
> Christian missionaries. Once Mahomedans were engaged in disseminating
> their religion by the sword. en conversion or death was the only alternative
> oﬀered to those under their power. Now death is the penalty of apostasy
> from their religion […]35

ey were of course exaggerating the history of conversion under Islam.
e mere existence of so many minorities living peacefully under
Ottoman rule should have showed the missionaries that their statement
could not hold true. But this was less problematic than the fact that
any Muslim who converted would be executed by the state. Despite
this disturbing situation, the missionaries remained optimistic about
their new ﬁeld of labour and understood that they would only have to
adjust to the new situation and change their priorities. Fisk and Parsons
wrote:

From this we learn that they understood that on foreign soil they could

consuls throughout the Empire (because the USA was not oﬃcially
represented then). e missionaries clearly respected or feared Ottoman
law signiﬁcantly enough not to work against the ban on preaching to
Muslims. What is more, they did not recognize the degree to which
their mission would be changed because of this prohibition and that
their target population would become the non-Protestant Christians
living in “Greater Syria” (modern-day Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine
and Israel).

Considering their eschalatogical view of history in the early 19th
century, they had four great expectations with regard to the Middle
East: “(1) the global spread of the gospel; (2) the return of the Jews to
Palestine and their ‘restoration’ (acceptance of Jesus Christ); (3) the fall
of the Pope; and (4) the collapse of Islam”.37

e American Protestants’ mission in the Ottoman Empire, orga-
nized and funded by the ABCFM, later also acquired the role of an
apostle for imperialism in the eventful 19th century. Yet, at ﬁrst their
religious goals were expressed in apocalyptic terms, such as that the
Gospel would “hasten the decline and fall of the bloody crescent of
Mahommed” (1828)38 and the “inﬂux of light” caused by the missions
in Syria would alarm the “Prince of Darkness” and lead “the Man of
Sin” to double his eﬀorts. erefore “the Beast and the False Prophet
occasionally unite” for opposing missionary eﬀorts but this opposition
would only be “a prelude to the battle of the great day” when Islam
would be overthrown.39 As early as the late 1820s those missionaries
targeted Syria (including Palestine) as lands of the Bible40 that they
reclaimed and gave attention to socially marginalized heterodox Muslim
minorities such as the “Metawalies” (Shīʿīs), Druzes and the “Anseiries”
(Nuṣayrīs), who were not accepted by the Sunnī “Turks”. ese minor-
ities who lived in the region stretching from Antioch to Palestine, a

“hiding place of schism and heresy”,41 “though nominal Mohammed-
ans, have scarcely any religion at all; and when the day comes, as it
certainly will before long, that Mohammedans shall be converted to
God, they will furnish a most interesting ﬁeld of labor”. By establishing
the necessary missions also among the Muslims, especially the Druze
and “the pagan Ansarrea”, God would “hasten the downfall of Satan’s
empire throughout this land and the whole world”.42

For the American Protestant missionaries the Nuṣayrīs were “a
wretched and degraded people […] for whom no evangelical exertions
have been made”43 and who were constantly oppressed by an unjust
Ottoman government.44 What the Nuṣayrīs needed was “the word of
life”.45 ey were “appropriate objects of christian benevolence” because

Initially the missionaries did not have much knowledge about the
Nuṣayrī people, in particular about their beliefs, except rumours. ey
regarded the Nuṣayrīs as hospitable and sociable, when it came to talk
about their faith they were “much more willing to sip coﬀee and smoke
tobacco, than to impart information about their country or their faith”.
e Nuṣayrīs had “hermetically sealed” their mouths due to fear of
being hated and watched by the Muslims.47 One missionary neatly sums
up this attitude with an Arabic proverb: “I talked to him to the east,
and he answered to the west.”48 Some basic information about the

Nuṣayrīs could be “ascertained”, however: that they were numbering
from 100,000 to 200,000; they were divided into diﬀerent sects; they
did not have places or times for prayers; they had feasts; there were no
marriage laws (!); they had their own religious books; they believed in
the transmigration of the soul; and they were illiterate.49 Eventually
more information could be drawn about “this most miserable, ignorant
and forsaken people”, when missionaries travelled and lived among
them they gathered statistics in the sixteen districts of Northern Syria
with more than two thousand villages and the names of the chiefs in
each district. According to another missionary, the Nuṣayrīs were the
“chief attraction” for a mission in Syria and “would probably prove a
very accessible people” because of the above-mentioned and also other
reasons:

> For generations they have seen no strangers or foreigners among them, except
> insulting enemies and outrageous oppressors. is has given them a distrust

> to speak, of the mission now in the country.50

e missionaries felt proximity to the Nuṣayrīs not only because of
compassion but also due to religious reasons: supposedly, this people
did not practice Islam (“ey are not Moslems”) but seemed to be
nearer to Eastern Christianity.51 When American Protestant mission-
aries ﬁrst set foot on Ottoman soil, the two “most fanatical, bitter and
zealous” opponents of Protestantism were Islam and Eastern Christi-
anity. e original aim was to purify the nominal “degenerate” Christian

sects, revive their spiritual faith and make them preach the pure Gospel.
us becoming true Christians and being united in one evangelical
church, they would exert a vigorous inﬂuence on the Muslims with
their righteousness.52 For this purpose, the Nuṣayrīs were sometimes
seen as lost Christians and included among Christian denominations.53

e missionaries were convinced that the Nuṣayrīs were receptive to
the Gospel and willing to receive missionaries and send their children
to Protestant schools. ey needed only to be convinced that “they [the
missionaries] were sincere friends, and had come, not to rob, oppress
and abuse them, but to befriend them and do them good”. eir “igno-
rance and wretchedness, their utter destitution of religion, their isola-
tion from all the rest of the world” were regarded as important factors
to open missions among them. To bring “these miserable, outcast hea-
then, without God and having no hope” into the fold of Jesus was
urgent and overdue.54 All over, the Protestants of the ABCFM use the
word “pagan” and “heathen” for groups that seemed not to be following
Judaism, Christianity and Islam. In the words of Rufus Anderson, an
outstanding minister at the Board, the word “heathen” was descriptive
and not restrictive.55

Missionary schools were eventually established to educate those “who
are destitute of the knowledge of Christianity”.56 Besides nominal
Christians and Jews, this included heterodox sects such as the Nuṣayrīs.
Especially children needed to be taught the Bible. e main purpose
of founding schools stemmed from the belief that by teaching the local
youth, regardless of their religion, to read they would be able to choose

the only “true” religion, i.e. Protestant Christianity.57 But only a few
Nuṣayrīs converted to Protestantism; by the year 1868 American mis-
sionaries admitted that the Nuṣayrīs “have not been reached in any
considerable numbers by the gospel”, though some had become
“enlightened” through the existence of a Protestant community near
them. e missionaries still hoped that before long the evangelists “will
have penetrated that section of the country, and that we shall begin to
sap the foundations of Islam, among those who are less fanatically
attached to all its precepts”.58 e same hope prevailed later in 1911,
when a missionary wrote that the schools they established in Nuṣayrī
villages did not yield much fruit and so still few Nuṣayrīs converted to
Protestantism, “some chosen ones who have received and lived the
truth, despite the withering, blighting inﬂuence of the heathenism with
which they have been surrounded”. Eﬃcient work was hindered by the
“persistent and determined opposition” of the Ottoman government
over the two previous decades, and the outcome was that “the darkness
of ignorance, superstition and paganism still broods like a deadly
miasma over the land, paralyzing the hearts and souls of men and cast-
ing over them the lethargy of spiritual death”.59

On the whole the missionary project failed, not only in Syria; schools
of the Syrian mission were closed down in the late 1880s until the early
1890s,60 at the height of Sultan Abdülhamid II’s power. Mehmed Ziya
Bey, the local governor (mutaṣarrıf ) of Latakia from 1885 to 1892 (see
below), is reported to have barred Protestant missionary work on behalf
of the Ottoman government. Writing in November 1891, a missionary
in Latakia stated that he “is doing all he can to hinder our work, seizing
Mission property in Jendairia and Aldainey [two villages], turning our
teachers out of doors and threatening them if they will not leave our
employ”.61 Henry Easson of the Reformed Presbyterian Church

informed its board and the US State Department that the Ottoman
government had illegally restored the mission property in Jendairia to
its former Nuṣayrī owners in October 1891 and the following month
their property in Aldainey was seized and the teachers were banned
from the village. Mehmed Ziya had told him that since they did not
own any building in the villages, they could not open schools. e
governor had given orders to the village chiefs that they should not
allow missionaries to enter the villages.62 e missionaries protested
against the closing of the schools, saying that it is illegal because the
Nuṣayrīs were “pagans” and not Muslims.63 What was injustice to the
missionaries, was justice to the Nuṣayrīs, and deviant or heretical, for
the Ottomans the Nuṣayrīs were still Muslims.

After decades of Ottoman oppression by several governors until the
1880s, eﬀorts were made later that decade to better their condition,64
though not out of sheer benevolence. Ismail Kemal Bey, governor gen-
eral (vālī) of Beirut from 1890 to 1892, writes that he was struck by
the injustices done to the Nuṣayrīs when he was inspecting the hinter-
land of Latakia and as a consequence introduced measures to appease
them. It is worthwhile to fully quote him on this issue, as it serves as
an example of the centralization policy of Abdülhamid II:

e Latakia region was to be a “high-proﬁle case” for carrying out the
Ottomans’ “benevolent reforms”.66 eir “imperial reformation” in this
period was not to bring liberty to subjects but to tighten the grip on
them even more and ﬁrmly attach them to the central power.67 In order
to prevent missionary work among heterodox sects Abdülhamid II
pursued counter-propaganda through the establishment of Muslim
schools and mosques in non-Sunnī areas. ese were means of a
“civilizing mission” by which “heretics” should be converted to the
Ḥanafī school. A policy of reward and punishment or the “carrot-and-
stick method” was applied.68 Whereas sometimes brutal methods and
systematic repression were used “to correct the ignorance and heresy of
these people”, often education and persuasion were applied as a
“defensive weapon” against the imminent threat to the unity and
integrity of the Ottoman Empire posed by these unorthodox commu-
nities.69 As it appears, sometimes groups of these marginal elements

converted to Ḥanafī-Sunnism willingly, as a response to Christian mis-
sionary activities. ese would ask to be converted to the Ḥanafī school
and request that schools and mosques be built in their district. Mehmed
Ziya Bey70 warned Istanbul that if one leaves the Nuṣayrīs in a state of
ignorance, this would only proﬁt the missionaries “who have already
gone so far as to pay regular salaries to the Nuṣayrī leaders”. erefore
the Sultan should respond to the Nuṣayrīs’ wish to become Muslims
and prove to the foreigners that their government is able to take care
of them.71

One of the few Ottoman oﬃcials who seemed to have cared for the
Nuṣayrīs was the liberal Midhat Pasha, governor general of Syria from
1878-1880. He had been already successful in carrying out various
reforms in a brief span of time. Suspected later by Abdülhamid of being
involved in the deposition and death of his uncle Sultan Abdülaziz
(1876), Midhat was removed from Istanbul and put under the yoke of
organizing state aﬀairs in the problematic province of Syria that had
seen inter-religious conﬂicts and several Nuṣayrī uprisings. When Mid-
hat set out to reform the province, he presented petitions to the Sublime
Porte, which the Syrian population welcomed.72 One of the steps to be
taken was to pacify the Nuṣayrīs. According to al-Ṭawīl, an ʿAlawī
writer, due to his wisdom Midhat’s initial suspicion of the rebellious
Nuṣayrīs vanished soon, and he decided not to send troops to the
Nuṣayrī mountains, as governors did before him. He summoned about

ﬁve hundred Nuṣayrī leaders, notables and sheikhs alike, from all over
Syria at a time when the region was in disarray and order needed to be
restored. Midhat Pasha promised to save them from their bad situation
and that they would be given a just administration which had been
denied to them ever since. To further their progress and education, the
governor wanted to open schools and build roads so their isolation
would come to an end.73 Midhat Pasha’s project did not materialize;
Abdülhamid removed him, thinking that his minister wanted decen-
tralization in that region to increase his own power.74 Some governors
after Midhat tried to continue with the education of the Nuṣayrīs.

According to ʿAlawī writers75 several of their religious leaders tried
to reform their faith and community during the awakening (yaqẓa) and
renaissance (nahḍa) of the Nuṣayrīs in the 19th century. e way they
followed was to prove that the Nuṣayrīs were pious Muslims who
adhered to Islamic rules. ey believed that the only cure against the
lethargy of their people was knowledge/science (ʿilm). To achieve this,
one of the sheikhs succeeded in meeting the abovementioned governor
of Latakia, Mehmed Ziya Bey.76 It is said that he was convinced to take

measures in order to save the Nuṣayrīs from ignorance and illiteracy.
For this the sheikh wrote a tract to the Sublime Porte, which Ziya Bey
forwarded. Istanbul was pleased and agreed.77 Other writers say that
Ziya Bey emphasized in his letter the building of Sunnī schools and
mosques as anti-propaganda against the Iranians who were using the
Nuṣayrīs to encourage a revolt in the Ottoman Empire.78

Being a functionary of the Ottoman state and a devoted servant of
Abdülhamid, Mehmed Ziya’s version of the story is that several religious
heads and secular leaders of the Nuṣayrīs approached and told him that
in early times they had been pious Muslims but in the course of time
strayed far from the right path because of ignorance. Now they wanted
to awake from their “slumber of negligence” (khāb-ı ghaﬂet) and see
how the “matchless” Sultan Abdülhamid, like “a second conqueror”
( fātiḥ-i sānī),79 had spread sciences (ʿulūm), education (maʿārif ) and
justice (ʿadālet) in the Ottoman Empire and so “revived the people”
(ahālīyi iḥyā eylemiş). e Nuṣayrī leaders were proud of being attached
to the Sultan, wanted to return to Islam and the Ḥanafī school and
beneﬁt from the sciences, education and the just order. Since they had
“desired salvation” (necāt bulmak) the governor promised them instruc-
tion in the religion of Islam, sciences and education by carrying out the
necessary measures, such as the construction of schools and mosques
and providing elementary textbooks about Islamic principles.80

Schools and mosques were built in Nuṣayrī towns and villages but
were abandoned after the death of Mehmed Ziya.81 ey were used as

storage rooms and stables.82 “e result has been”, according to the
missionary Balph, “that a generation has grown up in ignorance.”83 And
as Martin Kramer puts it, mosques had been built in Nuṣayrī areas
“almost as talismans to ward oﬀ the foreign eye”.84

On the whole, local Sunnīs viewed the Nuṣayrī conversions to Islam
with suspicion, as they were allowed to hide their beliefs and appear as
Muslims when forced by circumstances, meaning that they practiced
taqiyya.85 ere are reports of tens of thousands of Nuṣayrīs, such as in
Antakya (1898), requesting conversion to Islam.86 Despite the Ottoman
oﬃcial policy accepting Nuṣayrī conversions, some meddlesome local
notables and landowning families with inﬂuence in the region feared
the decrease of their power and did not accept the Nuṣayrīs as Muslims.
ey also did not allow them entering mosques and schools. e reasons
for not accepting the Nuṣayrīs as equal to the Sunnīs were that they
continued with their corrupt beliefs; that they became Muslims only
outwardly because then their testimony would be accepted in the courts,
and—being farmers working on rented ﬁelds—they would lie under
oath to each other and seize the ﬁelds on which they work. Moreover,
the mufti of Antakya noted that even though the Nuṣayrīs adhered to
the Islamic principles (bore testimony to Islam/şehādet, read the Qurʾān,
etc.), they did this outwardly and hid their real beliefs; for this reason
they should not be allowed to enter mosques. e mufti was dismissed
by the Sublime Porte, saying that even if the Nuṣayrīs became Sunnīs
outwardly, it did not matter, and they needed to be educated as good
Muslims in order to abandon their previous corrupted beliefs. e fact
that the Nuṣayrīs became Sunnīs also bothered some of their sheikhs.

e state ordered those sheikhs to be exiled for some time to places
without Nuṣayrī inhabitants.87

e state deemed it politically incorrect that the Nuṣayrīs were not
accepted as Sunnīs and should have separate mosques and schools as a
diﬀerent madhhab. As Christians were accepted to Islam without a
question, the Nuṣayrīs too should be treated equally. Some opportun-
ist individuals in Antakya, for instance, who wanted to employ the
Nuṣayrīs as slaves in possession (birkaç menfaʿat-perestānın yaʿnī Nuṣayrī
ṭāʾifesini ʿabd-ı memlūk 88 ḥükmünde taḥt-ı esāretine alıp istediği istikhdām
etmekte), prevented them to enter mosques. In order to avoid this, the
state sent about 70-80 soldiers to the region and ordered some of those
persons to Istanbul and rebuked them. e Sublime Porte thought that
if the Nuṣayrīs were not accepted as Sunnīs, they would be easy targets
for Protestant missionaries and eventually be converted, and so be pro-
tected by foreigners or apply to be exempted from military conscription
as did non-Muslim subjects.89

In these cases, the central administration refused the protest by the
people and the notables and accepted the Nuṣayrī conversions in order
to reinforce Abdülhamid’s position as caliph of all Muslims.90

On the whole, eﬀorts by Midhat Pasha and well-intentioned oﬃcials
after him to bring justice, education and welfare to the Nuṣayrī regions
were not very successful. Before and after the Young Turk revolution
Nuṣayrī leaders in Aleppo (1892) and Antakya and Latakia (1909) sent
petitions to Istanbul and complained that despite the great number of
their people, they were not represented in courts and councils.91 By and

large, hostilities or unjust treatment by Sunnīs against the Nuṣayrīs
seemed to have continued during the Young Turk era.92

As to the change from “Nuṣayrī” to “ʿAlawī”: most studies agree that
the term “ʿAlawī” was not used until after WWI and probably coined
and circulated by Muḥammad Amīn Ghālib al-Ṭawīl, an Ottoman
oﬃcial and writer of the famous Taʾrīkh al-ʿAlawiyyīn (1924). In actual
fact, the name “ʿAlawī” appears as early as in an 11th-century Nuṣayrī
tract as one the names of the believer (in al-Ṭabarānī’s al-Dalāʾil fī
maʿrifat al-masāʾil ). Moreover, the term “ʿAlawī” was already used at
the beginning of the 20th century. In 1903 the Belgian-born Jesuit and
Orientalist Henri Lammens (d. 1937) visited a certain Ḥaydarī-Nuṣayrī
sheikh Abdullah in a village near Antakya and mentions that the latter
preferred the name “ʿAlawī” for his people.93

Lastly, it is interesting to note that in the above mentioned petitions
of 1892 and 1909 the Nuṣayrīs called themselves the “Arab ʿAlawī
people” (ʿArab ʿAlevī ṭāʾifesi), “our ʿAlawī Nuṣayrī people” (ṭāʾifatunā
al-Nuṣayriyya al-ʿAlawiyya) or “signed with ʿAlawī people” (ʿAlevī ṭāʾifesi
imżāsıyla). is early self-designation is, in my opinion, of triple impor-
tance. Firstly, it shows that the word “ʿAlawī” was always used by these
people, as ʿAlawī authors emphasize; secondly, it hints at the reforma-
tion of the Nuṣayrīs, launched by some of their sheikhs in the 19th
century and their attempt to be accepted as part of Islam; and thirdly,
it challenges the claims that the change of the identity and name from
“Nuṣayrī” to “ʿAlawī” took place around 1920, in the beginning of the
French mandate in Syria (1919-1938).94

No doubt, the name “ʿAlawī” became accepted after WWI with the
short-lived “State of the ʿAlawīs” (dawlat al-ʿAlawiyyīn) under French
mandate in Syria as an autonomous region and later as one of the “Fed-
eration States of Syria”.95 It is common knowledge that the ʿAlawīs were
made into a dominant sect by the French, who were trying to counter
Sunnī hegemony in Syria. e ﬁndings in this paper indicate that the
ʿAlawīs were already prepared for this role by the tension between the
Ottomans and the Western Powers.
