Abstract

Daily prayer is one of the essential practices of the Abrahamic
religions. Some of the progressive elements of this series
of revelations are demonstrated by this paper as an exploration of the
development of liturgy and personal prayer patterns from its roots in
Judaism and subsequent development in Christianity, Islam and the
Bahá'í Faith.

Introduction

Progressive revelation is central to Bahá’í theology. It is the
bedrock upon which belief in the fundamental unity of religion is
built, as it provides a conceptual basis for seeing the interconnections
between the world’s diverse religions. All are seen as equally valid
paths to God. At the same time each is seen as a spiritual advance-
ment, built upon the traditions and successes of its predecessors.

> . . . in accordance with the principle of progressive revelation
> every Manifestation of God must needs vouchsafe to the
> peoples of His day a measure of divine guidance ampler than
> any which a preceding and less receptive age could have
> received or appreciated. (WOB 102)*
> Less well known but perhaps equally significant, is the Bahá'í
understanding of progressive revelation within the history of each
religion. Receptivity of the people to new spiritual insights grows as
previously revealed teachings are digested and absorbed. Thus spiritual
advancement is seen as an ongoing process within each religious
community. To the extent that believers grasp and apply the
fundamental teachings of their founding prophet, capacity for
further learning is generated. Light begets light.

In view of the central importance of progressive revelation, in
both its macro and micro aspects, Bahá'í scholars have a special
interest in documenting the interdependence of the world’s religions.
By identifying the specific threads of belief and practice as they
persist and develop, scholars put flesh on the skeleton of progressive
revelation. In addition, we often find an inter-fertility. It is not just
the newer religions which borrow and adapt practices of the older, but
also vigorous older religions adopting from latter revelations, as the
value of new light becomes apparent. A unified vision of the interplay
and interdependence of the world’s spiritual heritage emerges.

The stepwise advancement of progressive revelation is seen to exist
in all regions of the earth and encompass all spiritual traditions. In
cases where we know only the current spiritual practice of an
indigenous tribe and little of its history, it is assumed by faith that
earlier developmental stages must have existed. The task of tracing
the step-by-step progress is made easier when the spiritual history of a
sequence of revelations is recorded in sacred books. This is precisely
the case with the Abrahamic religions. Judaism, Christianity, Islam,
coupled with the Bábí and Bahá’í Faiths, which constitute a millennia
long series of discrete revelatory stages. The existence of the relevant
sacred books, Torah, New Testament, Qur’án, Bábí and Bahá'í
Writings, facilitate the work of any scholar who seeks to trace the
specifics and mechanisms of progressive revelation.

This paper seeks to explore both the continuities and progressive
unfoldments in daily prayer within the Abrahamic family of religions.
Of course, this history is extensive and this paper cannot hope to trace
the hundreds of forms that daily prayer has taken over the millennia.
Nevertheless, certain interesting patterns emerge from a study of
major trends. Worship has been transformed from its focus on
communal sacrifices to a focus on individual communion with God
through prayer. Daily prayer has now become, not only one of
religion’s essential practices, but the heart and soul of spirituality. The
progressive elements of this transformation are seen blossoming
within the sequence of divine revelations running from Moses to
Bahá’u’lláh. These elements are traced in this paper from their roots
in ancient Israel Temple sacrifice, through the development of
synagogue and church liturgies of Judaism and Christianity, five-
times daily prayer of Islam and the obligatory prayer of the Bahá'í
Faith.

In general, we may think of spiritual progress growing out of the
teachings of each new Prophet. Of special interest are those spiritual
innovations that arise out of popular custom without a claim of
divine mandate that are subsequently sanctified by a later Prophet. To
illustrate, there is no requirement for daily obligatory prayer in the
Torah. Rather Jewish prayer practices developed over time at the
Jerusalem Temple and were well established by popular custom within
the Jewish Community before being sanctified by the revelations of
Christ, Mu˙ammad and Bahá’u’lláh.

Transformation: Fr om Human to Animal
Sacrifice

The history of the Abrahamic religions demonstrates patterns of
worship with decreasing emphasis on communal worship orchestrated
by a priesthood and increasing emphasis on individual worship. Prior
to Abraham, child sacrifice was common in Near Eastern culture. The
sites of ancient sacrificial cemeteries have been found from Amman,
Jordan to Carthage in Tunisia. These cemeteries date from between
the 15th century BCE and the 4th century BCE. (Some scholars claim
that child sacrifice continued at Carthage into the second century CE
but that conclusion is not universally accepted.) The burned skeletons
of otherwise healthy children were buried in urns along with inscribed
prayers and vows.

Child sacrifice was a deeply entrenched custom in Israel as well.

Instances of child sacrifice persisted into the period of the Kings.
Moabite King Mesa offered his son out of desperation while fighting
a losing battle (2 Kings 3:27). Judahite Kings Ahaz and Manassah “do
evil in the sight of the LORD” by burning their sons as offering (2
Kings 16:3; 21:6). A site of child sacrifice in the valley of Hinnom
(Gehenna) was destroyed during Josiah’s Reform in the late seventh
century BCE (2 Kings 23:10; see http://www.usbible.com/Sacrifice/
sacrifice_israel.htm) The continuance of human sacrifices was a
provocation to the Hebrew prophets. The prophet Micah decried
those in his day who “give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit
of my body for the sin of my soul.” (Micah 6:6-7)

In the Torah, Genesis 22, we find a poignant tale wherein an angel
of the LORD puts an end to child sacrifice. It depicts Abraham
traveling to Mount Moriah, binding his son, Isaac, and preparing to
offer him in sacrifice in obedience to God’s command. An angel
intervened, halting the sacrifice. The story stirs compassion both for
Isaac, as the intended victim, and for Abraham, as the one who must
wield the sacrificial knife. The reader’s sympathy for them prepares
the way for the change in worship that follows. The old ways will give
way to new ones. From then on offerings would be of animal only. As

we read the story we emotionally align ourselves with Abraham and
wonder how he will have the emotional strength to kill his own child.
God says, “Take your son, your only son, the one you love and
sacrifice him as a burnt offering.” Not only is Isaac described as
Abraham’s son, but he is “the only son” and “the one you love.” All
this would make it incredibly difficult for Abraham to go through
with the sacrifice. Later the emotional volume is raised even higher.
As Abraham is climbing the mountain with his son, Isaac asks, “Where
is the lamb for the burnt offering?” Isaac of course does not realize
that he is the intended sacrificial victim.

Isaac is bound and laid out on the altar, but an angelic hand
intervenes and halts the sacrifice. A sheep whose horns happen to be
caught in a nearby bush, is offered up as a substitute. Thereafter those
who worshipped in the Abrahamic tradition would no longer follow
the long standing practice of sacrificing first born children. The
reform was later encoded in the Torah prohibiting all human sacrifice
(Leviticus 18:21; 20:2-5).

Can the ban on human sacrifice aptly be termed “progressive
revelation?” Some may object claiming that God never commanded
the sacrifice of children. Indeed we have no ancient record of any
such pre-Abrahamic command. Yet progressive revelation need not be
limited to abrogation of one divine law by another. Revelation of new
laws that change common practices serves the same purpose. Clearly
the ban on human sacrifice can rightly be called “progress” as it raised
the value of human life and transformed belief regarding what God
required from His worshippers. This new vision of God was less
harshly demanding, more compassionate.

Further this ban was the first in a chain of reforms that would span
multiple revelations. Soon thereafter the first foreshadows of the end
of the sacrificial cult appeared.

> Does the LORD delight in sacrifice and burnt offering
> rather than obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold to obey
> is better than to sacrifice, to heed is better than the fat of
> rams. [1 Samuel 15:22)
Although further centuries would be required, the end of the
sacrificial cult was destined to follow.

Transformation: Fr om Sacrifice to Prayer

From Abraham’s time through the Exodus, obligatory worship
revolved primarily around cultic worship with animal sacrifices on
special occasions presided over by holy men, such as priests or family
patriarchs. Prayer was largely spontaneous. We find no information
regarding systematic daily worship, either prayer or sacrifice during

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven        33

the patriarchal age. Prayer at that time appears to have been on an “as
needed” basis and consisted primarily of petitions in times of need.
(Genesis 20:7) Only with the Torah, and the establishment of the
Tabernacle along with a professional priesthood, do we find
regulations regarding obligatory daily worship of any kind.

> Now this is what you shall offer on the altar: two lambs of
> the first year, day by day constantly. One lamb you shall
> offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer at
> twilight . . . And you shall offer it with grain offering and
> drink offering ...for a sweet aroma, an offering made by fire
> to the LORD. This shall be a continual burnt offering
> throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of
> meeting before the LORD ... (Exodus 29:38-42)
> And you shall make an altar to burn incense on ... Aaron shall
> burn on it sweet incense every morning when he tends the
> lamps. And when Aaron lights the lamps at twilight, he shall
> burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD
> throughout your generations. (Exodus 30:1, 7-8)
Surprisingly, however, the instructions to the priests contain no
mention of prayers to be offered in conjunction with the daily burnt
offerings. Prayer continued to be primarily associated with petitions
for aid (Numbers 21:7) or special occasion blessings (Leviticus 9:22;
Numbers 6:24-26). Odd as it may seem to us, in view of our
contemporary association of worship and prayer, there apparently
were no formalized daily prayers in the time of either Abraham or
Moses. If regular prayers of praise or thanksgiving were used, we have
no record of them. The earliest mention of daily pray in the Biblical
record appears around the time of the establishment of the Israelite
monarchy under Kings David and Solomon.

The enlargement of the role of prayer was coupled with an
expanded view of the purpose of prayer. Prayer was no longer limited
to petitions for aid which tend to arise spontaneously in response to
specific hurtful or potentially hurtful situations. In contrast, daily
prayers were used day in and day out, during good times and bad.
Prayer became a vehicle for a wider variety of spiritual expressions
including praise, thanksgiving and lamentation.

The book of Psalms contains 150 sacred songs, many ascribed to
David. Expressions such as “Give thanks unto the LORD, for He is
Good” (136:1), “Every day I will bless you” (145:2) and “Hallelujah,
Praise ye God” (150:6) indicate that praise and thanksgiving were an
integral part of tabernacle and temple worship. The existence of a
collection of songs indicates some sort of regular use. Yet the Psalter
contains little explicit indication of how or when these sacred songs
were sung. One notable exception is Psalm 92, which reads in part:

> A Psalm. A Song for the Sabbath Day.
> It is good to give thanks to the LORD,
> And to sing praises to Your name, O Most High;
> To declare Your loving kindness in the morning,
> And Your faithfulness every night,
> On an instrument of ten strings,
> On the lute and on the harp,
> With harmonious sounds. (Psalm 92:1-3)
> The paradox here is that despite the pledge of daily praise, we find
the superscription associates the psalm with the Sabbath rather than
daily worship. Even though the words of the song refer to daily
praise, we do not know whether there was any kind of a daily worship
service at the tabernacle, or if such existed what the contents of the
service might have been. We know even less about the prayer life of
average Israelites. Did they have daily or special occasion prayers?
Were the psalms known and used by common people in the course of
their everyday lives? We simply do not know. We do know, however,
that if such existed, it was not mandatory or encoded in sacred
literature. Worship during that early period still revolved primarily
around sacrifices.

In his prayer dedicating the Jerusalem Temple, it is significant that
King Solomon refers to the Temple as “a house of prayer” rather than
a house of sacrifice. This phrase broke new ground, helping to create
a new prayer emphasis. He pleaded, “ May You hear the supplication
of ...Your people Israel, when they pray towards this place ... (also) the
foreigner when he comes and prays toward this Temple . . . ” (1 Kings
8:30, 43). “When anyone sins,” “when Israel is defeated,” “when there
is famine in the land” (1 Kings 8:22:53) the people were directed to
pray towards the new Temple. The presence of God resided in the
Holy of Holies of the Temple as represented by the miraculous
Shekinah Light that resided above the outstretched cherub’s wings
above the Ark of the Covenant. Within the Ark were the Tablets of
Moses containing the Ten Commandments. Thus, Solomon’s Temple
with its Shekinah Light was a suitable magnet for supplication and
petition. However, even in connection with Solomon’s House of
Prayer, we find no descriptions of daily prayer.

Some verses in the Psalms and Prophets seem on first reading to
refer to daily prayer routines. These verses were later used
anachronistically as evidence of the antiquity of the practice.
However, rather than being daily prayer as we now conceive it,
offered every day of the year, good times and bad, these references on
close reading can be seen as describing relatively short periods of
intense prayer during times of trouble. In the Psalms, we find David

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven         35

praying for relief three times a day. “As for me, I will call upon God;
and the LORD shall save me. Evening, and morning, and at noon, will
I pray, and cry aloud; and he shall hear my voice” (55:17). The context
shows that David had been betrayed by an unnamed friend and was
praying for God’s protection against this new enemy (vv, 18;21). Daniel
is also described praying three times a day in response to trouble, a
royal prohibition against worshipping the God of Israel. (Daniel 6:10).
Prayer was still for special occasions, medicine to be administered on
an ‘as needed’ basis.

A significant innovation in the role of prayer was expressed in the
Psalms of David and became even more fully developed in the
writings of Jeremiah. A new intimacy arose, establishing a different
sort of relationship. Previously prayer had been formal and
emotionally distant as implied in the imagery of the supplicant humbly
entering a royal court in order to petition the King. Now, we see
something more than the vertical standing of sovereign versus
subject. David poured out his heart to God in prayer, shared his inner
life and inmost feelings, expressed negative emotions, lamentations,
fears, doubts, as well as joy and exhilaration.

> My God, My God, why have you forsaken me? (Psalm 22:1)
> O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor chasten me in
> your hot displeasure. Have mercy on my O LORD, for I am
> weak. O LORD, heal me for my bones are troubled. (Psalm
> 6:1-2)
> I will praise you O LORD, with my whole heart. I will tell of
> your marvelous works. I will be glad and rejoice in You.

(Psalm 9:1-2)
Jeremiah took this intimacy a step further. After the destruction
of Jerusalem and the First Temple, he wrote a series of poems called
Lamentations, describing the dejected state of the Jewish nation. He
poured out his heart in sorrow without making request for relief. His
sole interest was for God to see him and to recognize his pain of
heart. “O LORD, behold my affliction .. . ” (Lamentations 1:9). “See O
LORD, for I am in distress” (1:20). The purpose of these prayers was
neither praise nor petition, but open self-expression. Jeremiah’s
freeness of speech allowed him to go so far as to express
disappointment with God. “You fooled me, O God, so that I was
fooled.” (20:7) For this reason, Wellhausen called Jeremiah, “the
father of true prayer . . . his book contains . . . confessions of personal
troubles and desperate struggles.” (Idelsohn, 15) God was now more
than the Almighty Sovereign Creator of Heaven and Earth. He had
also become “the Friend.”

The Babylonian Exile brought new challenges to worshippers of
Yahweh, the God of Israel, They were deprived of their Temple and
the accompanying sacrificial rites. Prayer thus took on greater and
greater importance. Even after the return to Zion and the rebuilding
of the Temple, many Jews remained in Babylon and shortly thereafter
spread even further afield. By the third century BCE, significant
Jewish populations could be found throughout the Hellenized Middle
East. Synagogues, as a center of Jewish spiritual life arose during the
Second Temple period as a practical adaptation to life in the Diaspora.
Travel to the Temple entailed a difficult and expensive journey from
Alexandria, Rome or Babylon. Large numbers did manage to get to
the annual pilgrimage festivals, Passover, Pentecost and Succoth, but
only the most affluent could afford to attend three times each year.
Furthermore, Temple worship took place amidst the congregated
throng and allowed little place for study, discussion of the Holy texts
or private meditation. The synagogue developed as a supplement to
Temple worship, a place for Torah reading and Sabbath prayer.

As a relatively late development, synagogues are not mentioned in
the Hebrew Bible. The earliest appeared during the third century BCE
in lower Egypt and slowly spread around the Mediterranean. (see
Second Temple Synagogues, http://www.pohick.org/sts/) Remains of
early synagogues in Europe have been found in Delos, Greece, and
Ostia, Italy. The spiritual advantages of weekly Sabbath gatherings
for study and prayer invigorated Jewish communities in the Diaspora.
Once these advantages were recognized, synagogues began to appear
in the Holy Land around the first century BCE as witnessed by ruins
discovered at Gamala and Capernaum (Galilee region), Masada, and
eventually reaching even to Jerusalem in the shadow of the Temple
Mount by the mid-first century CE.

The earliest synagogue in Judea has been unearthed at Qumran,
the sectarian Jewish community in the Judean Desert where the Dead
Sea Scrolls were found. This group despised the corrupt Jerusalem
priesthood and separated themselves to a life of isolation in the
desert. They redefined the Temple as their holy community made up
of living stones (Isaiah 54:11) and extended priestly rituals of purity to
all community members. In obedience to the Laws regarding Temple
rites, they bathed several times daily as the priests did, and offered the
sweet fragrances of prayer, the burnt offerings of the lips (Hosea
14:2), twice daily as a substitute for the evening and morning sacrifices
as prescribed in the Torah for the Temple. At Qumran, prayer was not
just for the priests, nor was it limited to festival days or times of
need. Rather prayer was systematized and became daily practice for
the entire community. As far as we know, this is the first instance of
obligatory daily prayer that is now central to Judaism, Christianity,
Islam and the Bahá'í Faith.

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven          37

According to the beliefs of the Qumran community, God had
abandoned the Holy of Holies of the Temple and now resided among
them. The estrangement from the Temple cult may have given the
synagogue its initial boost in the Holy Land, but its growth
encompassed both establishment and antiestablishment Jews. A Greek
inscription at the site of the Jerusalem synagogue declared,
“Theodotus, (son) of Vettenus, priest . . . built the synagogue for the
reading of the law and the teaching of the commandments.” Priests
also saw value in the synagogue as a supplement to Temple worship,
primarily as a library to allow public access to the sacred scrolls. It was
a place for reading and studying Torah. But while the Temple stood,
prayer was not yet a focus of synagogue activity.

After the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple by the Romans in
70 CE, Judaism underwent a major transformation. The cessation of
the Temple cult brought an end to the leadership role of the
priesthood within the Jewish community.

> As their world began to urbanize, the rabbis offered a bold
> new concept of a Judaism which was no longer dependant on
> the agricultural environment . . . Rites of sacrifice lost their
> raison d'être ...In the eyes of most Jews, sacrifices could only
> be offered at the centralized cultic site in Jerusalem.
> Consequently, Titus’ destruction of the Temple meant that
> the various daily, weekly and monthly sacrifices as well as the
> annual festivals could no longer take place.

(http://www.pohick.org/sts/Intrononotes.html)
First century Rabbis met at the Council of Yavneh to establish the
canon of the Tanakh and establish schools for the study of those
sacred texts. The Talmud grew out of their deliberations. Prayer came
to fill the void left by the end of the sacrificial cult and pilgrimage
festivals. A systematic liturgy emerged with a specific order of prayers
recited at specific times of the day.

Daily Prayer in Judaism

The earliest daily obligatory prayers in Judaism arose after the
destruction of the Second Temple. Jews would hold daily gatherings,
called minyans, in the synagogue up to three times a day. The Talmud
specifies that at the times when the morning and evening sacrifices
had been offered, the portions of the law that govern the sacrifices
should be recited. “your children shall study the law concerning
sacrifices and I (God) will consider it as though they had actually
offered them and I will forgive their sins.” (b. Meg. 31b)

In post-Biblical practice, the Shema is the core expression of
Jewish faith, declaring the Oneness of God. “Sh’ma, Israel, Adonai

Elohenu, Adonai Echad” which translated means “Hear O Israel, the
LORD our God, the Lord is One” (Deuteronomy 6:4), the Shema came
to be recited twice a day. Whether there was originally a linkage to
the morning and evening Temple sacrifices is unknown. Repetition of
the Shema is not a Torah Law, but rather a custom that developed
long after Moses. Although, the text itself is found in the Hebrew
Bible, which was the Book of that Age, there are no instructions
within the text stating that the verse should be recited.

Tradition holds that public recitation of the Shema originated in
the days of the Second Temple, no later than the first century CE.
Recitation of the Shema entailed not just the famous verse affirming
the oneness of God (Deuteronomy 6:4) but included related passages
from the Torah as follows: Deuteronomy 6:4-9 which speaks of the
unity and love of God, Deuteronomy 11:13-21 which rehearses the
results of obedience and disobedience to divine Torah and sets out the
necessity of teaching Torah to children, and Numbers 15:37-41 which
reiterates the need for obedience to Torah and sets out ordinances
related to clothing which serve as symbols of God’s covenant with
Israel.

Another ancient prayer found in synagogue liturgy is called the
Amidah. Based on the example of King David, it is a blessing repeated
morning, noon and night (Psalms 55:17-18), three times a day. The
Amidah is a prayer that is recited in a standing position from which its
name is derived. It contains eighteen benedictions and acknowledges
the faith of the forefathers of the Israelite nation. The form of the
Amidah was at first somewhat flexible, with only the text of the first
and last three benedictions definitely fixed. Spontaneous expressions
and petitions were incorporated into the intermediary benedictions.
Later the entire text of the eighteen benedictions was solidified.
English translations of both the Shema and Amidah are found in
Appendix A.

The recitation of these and other prayers was accompanied by the
use of tefillin or phylacteries. Small leather cases containing written
prayers and other holy words were tied onto the head and hands of the
worshipper with long straps. The practice is based on a literal
interpretation of the Biblical injunction:

> And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be
> upon thy heart . . . And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon
> thy hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes.

(Devarim / Deuteronomy 6:6-8)
Ablutions were also part of Jewish daily prayer customs. According
to the Talmud, Berachot 14b-15a, hands were to be washed before
adorning tefillin or reciting either the Shema or the Amidah prayer.

It appears that originally these prayers were said privately but over
time the practice developed of congregating morning, noon and night
for services. Each service includes the recitation of the Shema. Only
the evening and morning services include the Amidah. Orthodox
“minyans” or daily prayer services have followed the same basic
pattern with little variation from at least the fourth century CE until
the present.

As synagogue architecture developed in later centuries, that divine
presence was enshrined in an ark at the front of the synagogue
containing the Torah scrolls in remembrance of the Ark of the
Covenant and the Holy Tablets of the Jerusalem Temple. An Eternal
Light, representing the Temple’s Shekinah, was suspended over the
Ark. Evening and morning animal offerings were transformed into
prayers. Priests were no longer needed. A new class of professional
religious leaders arose to take their place. Rabbis were scholars,
learned in the Holy Books. The new emphasis was on recitation and
study of the sacred texts. Although conceived of as only a temporary
substitute for the destroyed temple, the synagogue became the center
of religious life, the place where the presence of God was seen to
reside.

Despite the accommodation to life in the Diaspora, an orientation
to the Holy Land and the site of the destroyed Temple was ever
present. The irreplaceable sanctity of the Holy City was, according to
both the Mishnah and Gemarah, memorialized by the direction one
faced while praying.

> If one is standing outside the country, one should direct
> one’s heart to the Land of Israel. If one stands in the Land of
> Israel, one should direct one’s heart towards Jerusalem. If
> one is standing in Jerusalem, one should direct one’s heart
> towards the Temple. If one is standing in the Temple, one
> should direct one’s heart towards the Holy of Holies.
> Consequently, if one is in the East, one should turn his face
> toward the West; if in the West, one should turn towards
> the East; if in the South, one should turn towards the North;
> if in the North, one should turn towards the South. In this
> way, all Israel will be directing their hearts towards one place.

(Talmud Berakhot 30a)

The Emerging Christian Liturgy

Christianity was built upon the foundation of Moses and the
Hebrew prophets. The first Christians were Jews who continued to
attend local synagogue services. In some areas, Christians were forced
to separate themselves due to being branded heretics and kicked out
of the synagogue. In other places, Christians and Jews continued to

pray together for centuries. There are reports of a fifth century
Byzantine Bishop chastising Christian groups for failing to separate
from the synagogue.

Long periods of joint worship, however, were the exception rather
than the rule. Twenty years after the death of Christ, separate
Christian Churches were well established in many large cities in
Palestine, Asia Minor (now Turkey) and Greece. Yet, except for a few
Apostolic Letters, they had no sacred text of their own on which to
base their prayer services. The formation of the New Testament did
not begin until decades after the death of Christ. Thus, the young
Church was forced to borrow heavily from the text and traditions of
Judaism. During those early years, Christians met in small groups in
private homes, just as Jews did when communities lacked the
resources to have their own synagogue. Congregational worship was
weekly, either on the Sabbath or on the first day of the week. The
structure was open, flexible and participatory. Anyone in attendance
could stand up and spontaneously contribute.

> When ye come together (for worship) one brings a psalm,
> another a teaching, another a tongue, another a revelation,
> another an interpretation. Let all things be done to edify. (1

Corinthians 14:26)
At that early stage, there was no established liturgy, but rather
considerable latitude to shape the service according to the
expectations, talents and needs of each particular Church community.
Church services were modeled after the synagogue and therefore
highlighted reading of the Hebrew Bible, the singing of psalms and
teachings (sermons). However, early Church services were
distinguished from synagogue services by the presence of miraculous
gifts of the spirit such as tongues, revelations and interpretations
thereof. Over time, readings from the Gospels were gradually added
along with the recitation of formalized Christian prayers and creeds.
However, reading from the Old Testament and the singing of Psalms
has ever remained an integral part of Christian worship.

Christian Daily Prayer

One of the most significant innovations of the Christian
Revelation was a progressive view of animal sacrifice. While
acknowledging the divine origin of the Mosaic Law and the sacrificial
rites found in the Torah, they were viewed as part of the old
Covenant that had been replaced by the New. While Judaism kept the
hope of the restoration of the sacrificial cults alive while adapting to
the loss of the Second Temple, Christians viewed the end of the cult
as permanent. There would no longer be any need for the Jerusalem
Temple, altars of burnt offering, or sacrifices of bulls, goats or sheep.

The death of Christ on the cross was seen as a superior sacrifice with
the power to cleanse humanity once for all time. Temple rites were
reinterpreted; Christ as High Priest offering the value of His Life in a
heavenly, rather than earthly, Temple. (Hebrews 9:24-26)

The loss of sacrifice as a means of approach to the divine left a
vacuum that prayer filled. Prayer replaced the offerings of incense
and the smoke of burnt offerings ascending to God. Christians were
to immerse themselves in prayer and to “pray incessantly” (Romans
12:12).

The Didache, also known as the Teachings of the Twelve Apostles,
is a post-Biblical Christian work generally dated circa 115 CE. In it we
find the earlier known set format for daily Christian prayer. It
instructs believers to recite the Lord’s Prayer three times each day.

> Neither pray ye as the hypocrites, but as the Lord hath
> commanded in his gospel so pray ye: ‘Our Father in heaven,
> hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
> as in heaven so on earth. Give us this day our daily bread.
> And forgive us our debt, as we also forgive our debtors. And
> lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil: for
> thine is the power, and the glory, for ever.’ Thrice a day pray
> ye in this fashion. (Didache: 8:2-3)
It is unclear how widespread the thrice daily recitation of the
Lord’s Prayer was among early Christians, since the authenticity of
Didache was not universally accepted. Some Christian communities
claimed it to be genuine Apostolic Instruction originating in the
Jerusalem Council of 50 CE. Clement of Alexandria (second century)
cites it once as Scripture, but no one else among the Church Fathers
makes any reference to it before the time of Eusebius (fourth
century). Eusebius emphatically places it among books that were not
to be included in the New Testament canon. Yet apparently Didache
enjoyed a wide circulation and was accepted by at least a portion of
the Church as a book worthy to be read in Church services.
Athanasius reports that it was still used for catechetical instruction in
the late fourth century. Thus it seems likely that a considerable
number of Christians would have followed its prescription for saying
the Lord’s Prayer three times in a day.

Eucharist and Catholic Mass

Another Christian innovation was communion or the Eucharist.

Christ had transformed the Jewish Passover into a memorial of His
sacrificial death. The bread and wine of the Passover meal became the
sacraments of his Memorial from which, over time, the liturgy

Catholic Sacrifice of the Mass developed. For some time the
Eucharistic Service was fluid and variable.

> All ceremonial evolves gradually out of certain obvious
> actions done at first with no idea of ritual, but simply
> because they had to be done for convenience. The bread and
> wine were brought to the altar when they were wanted, the
> lessons were read from a place where they could best be
> heard, hands were washed because they were soiled. Out of
> these obvious actions ceremony developed ...
> But we find much more than this essential nucleus in use in
> every Church from the first century. The Eucharist was
> always celebrated at the end of a service of lessons, psalms,
> prayers, and preaching, which was itself merely a
> continuation of the service of the synagogue. So we have
> everywhere this double function; first, a synagogue service
> Christianized, in which the holy books were read, psalms
> were sung, prayers said by the bishop in the name of all (the
> people answering "Amen" in Hebrew, as had their Jewish
> forefathers), and homilies, explanations of what had been
> read, were made by the bishop or priests, just as they had
> been made in the synagogues by the learned men and elders
> (e. g., Luke, iv, 16-27). This is what was known afterwards as
> the Liturgy of the Catechumens. Then followed the
> Eucharist ...
> . . . bread and wine are brought to the celebrant in vessels (a
> plate and a cup); he puts them on a table — the altar;
> standing before it in the natural attitude of prayer he takes
> them in his hands, gives thanks, as our Lord had done, says
> again the words of institution, breaks the Bread and gives
> the consecrated Bread and Wine to the people in communion
> ... (http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09306a.html)
The text of the Didache provided instructions on how the
Eucharist was to be celebrated. Parameters are set such as specific
prayers to bless the bread and wine before communion and a specific
prayer to follow it. This latter prayer pleads for the unity of the
Church by creating an interesting interpretive link between the bread
of the last supper and the miracle of the multiplication of loaves.

> As this broken bread was scattered upon the mountains and
> being gathered together became one, so may Thy Church be
> gathered together from the ends of the earth into Thy
> kingdom; for Thine is the glory and the power through Jesus
> Christ for ever and ever.
(http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-lightfoot.html)

The Didache speaks to Christians and refers to the Eucharist as “your
sacrifice.” More was involved than a memorial of Christ’s sacrificial
death long past. The offering was brought into the present. The
participants could share in and experience of the vital moment of
salvation. Here we have one of the earliest hints of
Transubstantiation, the doctrine that is the basis for the Catholic
Sacrifice of the Mass.

Among the writings of the Apostolic Fathers, Justin Martyr (c.

101-150 CE) gives further evidence as to the identification of the
Last Supper with a sacrificial offering. “ . . . we have been taught that
the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which
our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and
blood of that Jesus who was made flesh” (First Apology, 1, 62).
Transmutation, or transubstantiation as it was later called, is the
doctrine that the bread and wine of the celebration of the Last Supper
are miraculously changed during the service into the actual flesh and
blood of Christ, thus bringing the sacrifice of the cross into the
spiritual reality of the celebration.

As to when and how often the Eucharist was celebrated, many
scholars link descriptions of Sunday Service liturgy with the
descriptions of the Eucharist in both Didache and Justin Martyr’s
Apology. But a careful reading leaves that link in doubt. Both texts
contain detailed descriptions of weekly services that omit clear
reference to the Eucharist, which is previously described in
considerable detail. That separation seems strange if the Eucharist and
Sunday Service had already been united at the early date. Nevertheless,
sometime during the second century the Eucharist became a weekly
observance. By the third century, Cyprian (c. 200-258) argued that the
Eucharist was to be celebrated daily on the basis of Christ’s prayer,
“Give us this day our daily bread.”

The liturgy of the Mass incorporates the use of various body
positions: kneeling, sitting and standing.

Liturgy of the H ours

The Liturgy of the Hours constitutes a series of prayers that were
used in Catholic monasteries from ancient times. In its late and
complete form, prayer services were held seven times during the day
(Psalms 119:164) and once at midnight (Acts 16:25). Each service bore a
Latin name, several of which corresponded to the Roman custom of
numbering the hours of the day starting from dawn. The schedule
may have looked like this:

> Lauds — Dawn
Prime — One hour after dawn or approximately 7 AM

> Terce — Three hours after dawn, c. 9 AM
> Sext — Six hours after dawn, c. Noon
> None — Nine hours after dawn, c. 3PM
> Vespers — c. 5PM
> Compline — 7PM
> Matins — Midnight
The monks would sleep in the early evening after Compline, rise at
midnight for the Matins and then return to bed thereafter.

This intricate system of prayer did not spring into existence fully
formed. The Catholic Encyclopedia expresses the view that the
Liturgy of the Hours originally consisted of three daily services, Terce,
Sext and None. The writings of the Ante-Nicean Fathers instruct all
Christians to pray at these hours, but give no indication of whether
private prayer or congregational prayer was intended.

> Clement of Alexandria and likewise Tertullian, as early as the
> end of the second century, expressly mention the hours of
> Terce, Sext, and None, as specially set apart for prayer
> (Clement, "Strom.", VII, VII, in P.G., IX, 455-8). Tertullian
> says explicitly that we must always pray, and that there is no
> time prescribed for prayer; he adds, nevertheless, these
> significant words: "As regards the time, there should be no
> lax observation of certain hours — I mean of those common
> hours which have long marked the divisions of the day, the
> third, the sixth, and the ninth, and which we may observe in
> Scripture to be more solemn than the rest" ("De Oratione",
> xxiii, xxv, in P.L., I, 1191-3). (Catholic Encyclopedia, Electronic
> Version, http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/none.html)
In stages, the number of times a day specified for formal prayer
increased. Practicality limited observance to monasteries as working
people could not comply with so rigorous a prayer schedule. By the
end of the fourth century, the hours of Vigils (Matins), Lauds and
Vespers had been added. The full repertoire of eight services was in
place by the end of the fifth century. The selection of these hours was
based on certain times that Peter and other apostles are reported to
have prayed. Rather than obedience to a specific injunction, the
multitude of services is perhaps best understood as an attempt to
institutionalize the apostolic mandate to “pray incessantly.”

Moder n Ca tholic, Orthodox and Protestant
Liturgies

Over the centuries, Church liturgies tended to grow more and
more structured. Nevertheless, tremendous variety can be found from

one denomination to the next. Virtually all incorporate the singing of
psalms (or hymns), a sermon (or teaching) and the Eucharist (or Holy
Communion). Many also include recitation of the Lord’s Prayer.

Catholic and Orthodox Services are highly scripted. For example
the Greek Orthodox Service as found in the Divine Liturgy of St. John
Chrysostomos (http://www.ocf.org/OrthodoxPage/liturgy/ liturgy.html)
consists largely of responsive readings coupled with recited creeds and
prayers. Protestant Services vary widely from well developed structure
found in Lutheran and Anglican Churches to the relative spontaneity
of the Baptist and Pentecostal Churches.

Christian Innovations

Judaism began with an orientation to the sacred space of the
tabernacle / temple and only later adopted the scattered locations of
the synagogue as a proxy. Christianity however began with distributed
sacred space, space that was sanctified simply by assembling. “For
where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in
the midst of them.” (Matthew 18:20) The sacred geography of the past
would be abandoned. “The hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this
mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.” (John 4:21) The
idealized vision of Christian worship found in the Revelation of St.
John portrays a Christian community oriented to a New Jerusalem a
spiritual city built on the foundation of the Twelve Apostles with
Christ as the foundation cornerstone.

> And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high
> mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem,
> descending out of heaven from God . . . And I saw no temple
> therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the
> temple of it. And the city had no need of the sun, neither of
> the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it,
> and the Lamb is the light thereof. And the nations of them
> which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of
> the earth do bring their glory and honour into it. (Revelation
> 21:10, 22-24)
In this vision, Jerusalem retains its Holy status, as it did within
Judaism, but the city was to be Temple-less. God and Christ would
serve the orienting function that the physical Temple had previously
served. Under Byzantine rule, Jerusalem was a center of Christian
Life. Churches were constructed at the sites related to the life and
death of “the LORD” but the Temple Mount was intentionally left in
ruins. The entire City was sacred, but no specific place within the City
was identified with the presence of God.

Interestingly both Judaism and early Christianity made the
transition from Temple oriented to congregation oriented worship at
about the same time during the first century C.E. Jews view this
transition as temporary and continued to anticipate the restoration of
the sacrificial cult. In contrast, Christianity was born at the tail end of
the Second Temple period and viewed the destruction of the Temple
as a sign of that a new covenant had replaced the old Law of Moses.
Nevertheless, both groups built upon the rituals of animal sacrifices
and transformed them into symbolic acts. The breaking of bread, the
drinking of wine and most prominently, offerings of incessant prayer
took the place of the former rites.

Christ, like David and Jeremiah, poured out His personal
lamentations to God in prayer at critical times. Prior to His arrest in
the Garden of Gethsemane the Gospels report Christ’s words, “My
soul is deeply grieved even unto death . . . Father let this cup pass from
me.” (Matthew 26:38-39) On the cross, Christ’s lament took up David’s
anguished cry from the Psalm, “God, why have you forsaken me?”
(Matthew 27:46) Perhaps one of the most revolutionary innovations by
some Protestant groups is the rejection of the recitation of written
prayers. Prayers are said in one’s own words. For some denominations,
such as the Church of Christ and Jehovah’s Witnesses, the prohibition
extends even to reciting the Lord’s Prayer. Although this prayer is the
oldest documented portion of the Church liturgy, its repetition is not
mandated in the text of the New Testament. Opponents of ‘rote
prayer’ will point out that in the Gospel text, in the verses just prior
to the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus warns his disciples against repetitive prayer.

> When ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do:
> for they think that they shall be heard for their much
> speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father
> knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
> After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in
> heaven, Hallowed be thy name. (Matthew 6:7-9)
This command has been interpreted as prohibiting the verbatim
repletion of any kind. The result is a wholesale dismissal of liturgy.
Services in these churches tend to enlarge the teaching / sermon
portion of the service.

Within this branch of Protestantism, prayer is seen as a vehicle for
establishing a “personal relationship with God.” Spontaneous,
unscripted prayers uttered in one’s own words, serves to create an
intimate link with the Divine. Nevertheless, distinct prayer patterns
persist even in these ‘anti-rote’ churches. The use of psalms and hymns
(often prayers set to music) is common to virtually all Christian
denominations.

Islam

Daily prayer, referred to in Arabic as al-Salat, is one of the
founding principles of Islam. Mu˙ammad established specific times
of the day and specific regulation for prayer. The Qur’án does not
portray al-Salat as an Islamic innovation but rather traces its origin
back to the Patriarchal Age. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob (21:73), Ishmael
(19:55), Moses (20:14) and Jesus (19:31) are all said to have practiced
regular prayer. Subsequent generations failed to preserve their
heritage and ancient prayer practices needed to be reestablished by
Mu˙ammad.

> These are some of the prophets whom God blessed. They
> were chosen from among the descendants of Adam, and the
> descendants of those whom we carried with Noah, and the
> descendants of Abraham and Israel, and from among those
> whom we guided and selected. When the revelations of the
> Most Gracious are recited to them, they fall prostrate,
> weeping. After them, He substituted generations who lost
> the contact prayers (Salat) and pursued their lusts . . . (Qur’án
> 19:58-59)
Current practice is highly structured including specific hours of
prayer five times a day. A series of formalized prayers called a raka’ is
used. The cycle is repeated a specified number of times at each
designated hours. For example, the morning prayers, called Salat-ul-
Fajr, consist of two cycles while the noon prayers, Salat-ul-Zuhr,
consist of four.

Key elements of each cycle proclaim the greatness and oneness as
embodied in the phrases, Alláh’u’Akbar (God is Great) and La ilaha
illalláh (There is no God but God). In contrast to informal prayers,
which can be said at any time of the day or night, al-Salat customs are
specified for the designated hours. There is almost universal
conformity throughout the Muslim world on the following prayer
procedure, although some local variants do exist.
5\. Ablutions or ritual washing, prior to prayer.
6\. Pray facing the Qiblih at Mecca.
7\. Verbatim recitation of specified prayers including portions of

Qur’án,
8\. Use of specific prayer postures such as bowing, kneeling and

standing at specific points in the prayer,
9\. Performed five times each day at specified hours.

Ritual cleansing is an important part of Islamic prayer practice.
Mosques often contain facilities for ablutions. Parts of the body are

washed in a specific order according to a specified procedure. For
example, one is to take water in the palm of the right hand and wash
the face top to bottom, from forehead to chin. This outward physical
preparation is to be accompanied by an inner preparation for the
heart’s connection with the divine. One then faces Mecca and recites
a series of short prayers in praise of God. Each is said from a specified
position: standing, kneeling or bowing.

Qur’ánic Origins of Traditional Prayer Practices

The general belief among Muslims is that all of the prayer
practices associated with al-Salat go back at least to the time of
Mu˙ammad. (Some claim they go back to Abraham.) God is said to
have revealed these details to Mu˙ammad during the Prophet’s night
journey (Isra' and Mi'raj). In fact, while certain features of Salat are
clearly set forth in the Qur’án, such as times of day and the direction
to face, other specifics such as the text of the prayers to be used, the
details of ablutions, the specific positions to go with each part of the
text or the number of cycles (raka’ ) to say at each hour, are not
recorded in the Qur’án. Rather they derive from secondary sources
(Hadith) and later traditions.

Chapter 4 of the Qur’án is one of its oldest sections. It deals with
a early period in the career of Mu˙ammad, just after the Hegira,
when He resided in Medina. The text shows that even in that period
daily prayer routines had already been established. “Prayer indeed has
been enjoined upon the believers at fixed times.” (4:103) They were
performed publicly and accompanied by prostrations (4:102). In times
of danger or battle, prayers could be shortened (4:101). This exemption
indicates that already in the Medina period, Mu˙ammad’s followers
had formalized daily prayers of specified length, which then could be
shortened under exceptional circumstances.

The five times for Al-Salat are set at dawn, noon, mid-afternoon,
sunset and night (before retiring). Most Islamic authorities recognize
the authority for these five distinct hours of prayer as originating in
the Qur’án:
•   Dawn — “Establish regular prayers . . . the morning prayer”

> (17:78); “at the retreat of the stars” (52:49); “before the
> rising of the sun” (20:130) “at the two ends of the day [i.e.

morning and evening]” (11:114).
•   Noon — “(Say) Glory be to Alláh . . . when the day begins to

decline.” (30:18)
•   Afternoon (or before sunset) — “Keep up prayer at the ends

> of the day [understood as beginning and end of daylight]”
(11:114); “in the late afternoon” (30:18)

•     Sunset (after sundown) — “Keep up prayer . . . in the first

hours of the night.” (11:114)
•     Night — (before going to bed)- “So (give) glory to God,

> when ye reach eventide and when ye rise in the morning.”
> (30:17)
Some scholars (mostly non-Islamic) identify only three times of
prayer in these verses, dawn, sunset and nighttime. (See Judaism in
Islam by Abraham Katsh, p. xv) They would understand “when the day
begins to decline” as signifying the hour before sunset rather than
noon and they would understand “in the first hours of the night” as
equivalent to bedtime. Thus the second and third salats would be
collapsed, likewise the fourth and fifth. If true, separation into 5
prayer times would be understood as a later development.

Interestingly, some Muslims also see evidence for three rather than
five daily prayers based upon the text of Qur’án 11:114 which reads,
“And establish regular prayers at the two ends of the day and at the
approaches of the night.”

> The two afternoon prayers and the two after sunset prayers,
> which are spoken of together, may ...be said together. (Notes
> to Maulana Mu˙ammad Ali’s translation of the Qur’án)
> As for the Establishing of our PRAYERS, Alláh has
> mentioned only THREE TIMES in the Qur’án.
> (http://www.mostmerciful.com/realities-of-our-daily-prayers--
> part-three-conclusion.htm [sic; URL correct])
When we compare ancient Jewish and Islamic prayer practice,
some interesting parallels emerge. The Hebrew Bible describes the
prayers of Daniel in terms that resemble al-Salat in several particulars.
We read, “ . . .he went into his house; and his windows being open in
his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times
a day and prayed, and gave thanks before his God . . .” (Daniel 6:10).
Here Daniel (a) faces the Holy City, (b) assumes a kneeling posture,
(c) prays three times a day.

If the proposals regarding an original three times prayer in Islam is
accurate, it would bring early Islamic practice into closer conformity
with Jewish and Christian practice. Disputes with Jews and Christians,
during and after Mu˙ammad’s lifetime, may well have lead to a
variety of reforms within Islam as the new religion sought to establish
its own independent identity. We know from the Qur’án itself that
the direction of prayer, the Qiblih, had been moved from Jerusalem
to Mecca for precisely this reason.

Striking similarities exist between the Jewish Shema and the
Islamic Shahadah. Both are fundamental confessions of monotheism.

The kernel of the Shema is “Hear O Israel, the LORD thy God, the
LORD is one.” The Shahadah similarly asserts, “There is no God but
Alláh. (la ilaha illa ‘lláhu)” The Shahadah also parallels other Biblical
passages such as, “There is no God but the LORD.” (Psalms 18:31)
Both Jewish and Islamic daily prayers invoke the name of God and
offer superlative praise, both acknowledge their respective founders,
Moses and Mu˙ammad, (Compare Tashahhud lines 3-6 with Amidah line
2) and both encourage loyalty to God’s law. (Compare Qira’ah lines 7-9
with portion of Shema form Numbers 15:40) Al-Salat is always said in
Arabic, regardless of the native language of the believer, as Jewish
prayers are always offered in Hebrew.

Animal Sacrifice in Islam

The feast of Eid al-Adha is celebrated on the 10th day of the
month of Dhul Hijja of the lunar Islamic calendar. It is traditionally
marked by the sacrifice of a sheep in remembrance of Alláh’s
intervention in Abraham’s sacrifice of his son Ishmael and the
substitution of a sheep. Celebrants partake of the meat and share it
with the poor. This sacrifice is not a whole burnt offering or an
atonement offering of any kind but rather a thanksgiving and
communion offering.

> It is not their meat nor their blood that reaches Alláh: it is
> your piety that reaches Him ... (Qur’án 22: 37)
> No one should suppose that meat or blood is acceptable to
> the One True God. It was a pagan fancy that Alláh could be
> appeased by blood sacrifice. But Alláh does accept the
> offering of our hearts ... (Yusuf Alí Commentary)

The Historical Conne ction of Mu˙ammad with
Jewish and Christian Communities

Islam came into existence in sixth century Arabia in response to the
idolatry and excesses of the pagan Arabian tribes. Mu˙ammad
intended to reintroduce the pure religion of Abraham, which shared a
rich heritage with its Jewish and Christian offshoots. According to
the Bahá'í understanding, each new revelation is rooted in and
subsequently expands upon the teachings of its predecessors.
Mu˙ammad was neither Jewish nor Christian. He was raised in Mecca
and the presence of Jews or Christians in Mecca is in doubt. Secular
scholars have raised questions about the sources of Mu˙ammad’s
knowledge of them. Nevertheless Mu˙ammad had many opportunities
for contacts with both Abrahamic Religions.

Historians mention some 20 Jewish tribes that lived in Arabia
during Mu˙ammad’s era including two tribes of priests. Those Jews

spoke Arabic, were organized into clans like the Arabs, and seem to
have fully assimilated the values and customs of desert society. Yemen
(Southwestern Arabia) was generally considered a Jewish State until
around 523 C.E. and had broad influence on Arabic peoples. Whole
tribes had converted to Judaism. Jewish customs and traditions were
known and practiced by many Arabs. The Qur’án describes three
tribes of Jews living in Medina when Mu˙ammad fled there in 622
CE.

Despite the fact that Arabia was distant from the Talmudic
Centers in Babylon and Palestine, the historical record shows that
trade and cultural contacts were extensive. Mu˙ammed accompanied
His uncle on trading missions to Syria, where He had come into
contact with Christian monks and with Jewish scholars. Later He was
asked to lead a similar expedition Himself on behalf of the wealthy
widow Khadijah. Thus it should come as no surprise that the Prophet
of Islam would have been exposed to Jewish beliefs and practices, not
only the customs of Yemenite and Arabian Jews but the wisdom of
the Talmud as well. In this environment, it is most probable that
Mu˙ammad had direct knowledgeable of Jewish practices and His
revelation accordingly incorporates a considerable number of them
into His religious teachings.

The Qur’án retells various stories of the Old and New Testaments.

There are extensive references to Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus and
Mary among others. Due to the differences between the Torah and
Qur’án in some of the narratives, such as the story of Joseph, some
scholars have concluded that cultural contacts were fuzzy, being
mediated by time and distance. However, others contend that these
differences narrow considerably in light of Talmudic interpretations.
One scholar commented “For, astonishingly enough, the Biblical
narratives are reproduced in the Qur’án in true Aggadic cloak.” (The
Haggada or Aggada is a section of the Talmud that specializes in
interpreting non-legal matters. See Judaism In Islam, by Abraham Katsh,
p. xviii) In other words, the text of the Qur’án does not merely repeat
the stories told in the Hebrew Bible, but retells them in the light of
the most advanced Judaic Studies of the time. If this viewpoint is
correct, it would support the suggestion that Mu˙ammad was familiar
with the best of ancient Jewish scholarship.

Similarly, some of the differences between Qur’ánic accounts and
the Gospels can be explained by alternate traditions within
Christianity. For example, some of the details of the life of Mary
found in the Qur’án, but missing from the canonical Gospels, can be
traced to the Protoevangelium of James. (See http://www.catholic-
forum.com/saints/stj20001.htm)

Islamic Innovations within Sufism

Sufism, or Taßawwuf, grew out of early Islamic asceticism. It was a
mystical movement that sought nearness to God through self-denial.
While Sufism may have been influenced by the practices of Christian
hermits as well as the Neo-Platonism of Alexandria, and the
Vedantism of India, it developed into a major movement solidly
rooted within the culture of Islam.

> The introduction of the element of love, which changed
> asceticism into mysticism, is ascribed to Rabi'ah al-'Adawiyah
> (died 801), a woman from Basra who first formulated the
> Sufi ideal of a love of God that was disinterested, without
> hope for paradise and without fear of hell.
> (http://www.franzholzer.de/htmle/esufi2.htm)
> The goal of Sufism was a mystical union with the divine. Sexual
energy became an analogy for a one-on-one relationship with God.
The Song of Songs, a series of love poems found in the Hebrew Bible,
may have provided a precedent, Sufism carried the romantic theme to
a higher level. Rather than to distain the passions of sexual energy as
asceticism did, viewing all passion as an obstacle to union with the
divine, Sufism embraced and transformed that energy into a vehicle
of union. The devotee was to have no interest in any other aspect of
life or any selfish reason for turning to God. The only motivation was
the desire of a lover to be with the Beloved. There were no prayers of
petition, no requests for favors, no rewards in this life or hereafter.
The love of God became an all-consuming passion.

One of Sufism’s chief innovations was the focus on prayer as a
vehicle for entering the divine presence. Through prayer the
worshipper could enter an ecstatic state of nearness to God. Dance
and music were used to enhance the experience. Over time, various
Christian and Jewish groups adapted Sufi thought and practice to
their own devotions. During medieval times, Christian mystic writers
such as Saint John of the Cross and Saint Bernard of Clairvaux
embellished the theme of the love of God with romantic images. A
major theme of the Kabala (dated to around the 11th century) is union
with the Shekinah, the feminine aspect of God. The Hasidic
Movement arose among the Jews of seventeenth century Poland.
Hasidim used music and dance in ways similar to the Sufi dervishes, to
achieve spiritual ecstasy.

Other Possible Parallels

Other possible links between Jewish/ Christian practice and Muslim
practice can be mentioned, although establishing their presence in the
time of Mu˙ammad is problematic. Ablutions, prior to prayer, are a

marked feature of al-Salat. Jews, likewise make use of water for ritual
cleansing. The mikvah is most commonly known as a basin that
women use for monthly purification. In earlier ages, it was also a
customary method of ritual cleansing for men. Priests in the Jerusalem
Temple and Qumran Sect are well known examples. Catholics also use
water for ritual purposes prior to prayer and place basins of holy water
at the entrance to the Church sanctuary for symbolic cleansing. We
do not know what related cleansing rituals may have been used by
either Jewish or Christian worshippers in the East from the time of
Mu˙ammad, but regardless of whether a direct link existed or not, the
principle of purification with water is something shared by all three
traditions.

Similarly, with regard to the issue of prayer postures, we have
already noted that Jews stand, sit and bow their heads for specific
prayers, just as Muslims do for the five-times Salat prayers. Catholics
likewise stand, kneel and sit for various part of the Mass. However,
we do not know when these practices were instituted or what form
they may have taken in 6th century Arabia.

The Catholic rosary is a series of prayers offered daily that begins
with an acknowledgment of monotheism in its Trinitarian form, “In
the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost . . .” This may be seen as
a sort of parallel with the opening of al-Salat “In the name of Alláh”
(bismilláh).

Islam claims to represent the True Religion of Abraham. Jews and
Christians derive their belief and practice from the same roots, as
Qur’án freely acknowledges.

> We believe in God, and the revelation given to us, and to
> Abraham, Ismá'íl, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and that
> given to Moses and Jesus, and that given to (all) prophets
> from their Lord: We make no difference between one and
> another of them: And we bow to God (in Islám). (Qur’án
> 2:136)
> Recognition of similarities, whether borrowed practices or shared
principles, testifies to a shared history. Progressive revelation serves to
explain the dynamics of the processes of innovation and preservation
of tradition. Daily prayer practices, such as specific hours for prayer,
the direction of prayer, etc. had developed over the centuries as a
common custom within Judaism and Christianity despite the fact that
neither Moses nor Christ had commanded them. In Islam we find the
first codification of laws governing daily prayer. The revelation of
Mu˙ammad confirmed and expanded upon these customary practices.
When viewed in the light, progressive revelation becomes more than
updating previous revelation. It becomes an evaluation of the
innovations that arose during the preceding Dispensation. The

adoption of some of those customs in the subsequent revelation
effectively recognizes the value of those initiatives. New spiritual
insights are thus seen to be possible, not only during the formative
age of each faith, but continuously. While the Manifestations of God
(founding prophets) naturally exhibit an extraordinary measure of
new light, others, ordinary people who are not inspired prophets, can
contribute as well.

Bahá'í Obligatory Prayers

The Bahá'í Age is seen as the age of the world’s emerging
maturity. Advancement of the individual is stressed. There is no
priesthood or clergy. Daily prayer becomes personal and focuses, not
on supplication or petition, but upon achieving nearness to God and
cultivating spiritual virtues. Congregational ritual is prohibited.

Bahá’u’lláh revealed three obligatory prayers, short, medium and
long, in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. Each of these prayers has its own character
and associated practices. In previous Dispensations, daily prayer
practices such as the prayers to be recited, times of day, positions and
so forth developed by custom rather than coming directly from the
teachings of the founding prophet. In confirmation of the customary
practices of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, Bahá’u’lláh gives specific
instructions with each of the obligatory prayers. The worshipper
selects one of the three to say each day, at her own option.

Another Bahá'í innovation is the movement of daily prayer from
public to private places. The minyan and mass are designed for
congregational prayer in synagogue or church. Al-Salat may be public
or private but is most widely known by the public call to prayer from
the minaret, followed by worshippers dropping whatever they are
doing to prostrate themselves in market, street or home. In contrast,
Bahá'í obligatory prayer is exclusively private. Congregational use of
the three obligatory prayers is prohibited. There are other prayers and
other occasions for praying together with others. The purpose of
obligatory prayer is to enhance a one-on-one relationship between
worshipper and the Divine.

The short prayer is to be said at noon. It is primarily a prayer of
praise. Like the Shema and the prayers of the Salat, it proclaims the
Oneness of God. “There is none other God but Thee, the Help in
Peril, the Self-Subsisting.”

The medium prayer is perhaps the most similar to al-Salat. It
contains petitions (strengthen my hand O My God ) as well as praise
(exalted art Thou above my praise) and proclamation of God’s
uniqueness (I bear witness to Thy unity and oneness.) It is to be said

three time a day, requires ablutions, and is accompanied by a series of
standing, kneeling and sitting postures.

The writings of Bahá’u’lláh set out specific instruction on
ablutions and positions, thus confirming and extending these Islamic
innovations which were established by custom rather than prophetic
mandate. For example, the instructions accompanying the Medium
Prayer state:

> To be recited daily, in the morning, at noon and in the
> evening. Whoso wishes to pray (this one of the three
> obligatory prayers) let him wash his hands, and while he
> washeth, let him say: ‘Strengthen my hand, O my God, that is
> may take hold of Thy book . . . ’ Let his stand up, facing the
> Qiblih . . . and say . . . Let him then bend down with hands
> resting on knees and say ... (KA)
The long obligatory prayer is said once a day, at any hour.

Although ablutions are not required in the text of the Aqdas, washing
in preparation for prayer is a recommended Bahá'í practice. The long
prayer is also characterized by various postures.

The long prayer lays emphasis on achieving the mystical experience
of entering the presence of God. Incessant prayer, purity of heart,
selflessness and detachment are the vehicles that transform the soul
and open the door to communion with the divine.

> . . . make of my prayer a fire that will burn away the veils
> which have shut me out from Thy beauty, and a light that
> will lead me unto the ocean of Thy Presence.
> O Thou in separation from Whom hearts and souls have
> melted . . . Thou seest, O my Lord, this stranger hastening to
> his most exalted home beneath the canopy of Thy majesty
and within the precincts of Thy mercy ...

. . . Thy call hath awakened me, and Thy grace hath raised me
> up and led me unto Thee. Who, otherwise, am I that I should
> dare to stand at the gate of the city of Thy nearness ... ?

The intimacy and closeness with the Divine that the long obligatory
prayer points to, incorporates the sharing of inner feelings of distress
and anguish that we previously saw in David, Jeremiah and Christ.

> Thou dost perceive my tears and the sighs I utter and hearest
> my groanings and my wailings and the lamentations of my
> heart .. . My trespasses have kept me back from drawing nigh
> unto Thee ...and separation from Thee hath destroyed me.
In the long obligatory prayer and elsewhere in the Bahá'í writings,
many of the names and attributes given to God exhibit more than the

formal relationship of sovereign to subject. God is the Desire of the
World, the Beloved of the Nations, the Best Lover and perhaps most
simply and powerfully The Friend.

The desire for and achievability of closeness through prayer
depicted here is markedly different than the relationship established
through animal sacrifices on special occasions at a distant sanctuary.
God is now closer in both time and space, and more encompassing as
well in the array of emotions that the worshipper shares with God.
The desire to draw near to God has been a constant theme of
progressive revelation. In ancient Judaism, communion offerings
attempted to breach the gap between the worshipper and the Divine
by sharing physical food. Procedures for the offerings are set forth in
specific detail in the Torah. The choice, fatty pieces of the sacrificial
animal were offered upon the altar as God’s portion. The people sat
within the sacred precincts of the Temple and ate their portion. In
Christianity, communion took the form of the bread and wine which
stands in the place of blood and flesh in obedience to Christ’s direct
commandment as recorded in the Gospels. Islam adopted communion
sacrifices by custom. But in the Bahá'í Faith, prayer becomes the sole
vehicle of communion. There are no communion meals either by
mandate or custom. To “enter the presence,” to “mourn separation,”
to “hasten home to the precincts of majesty,” to “stand in the Holy
City,” these are the goals of spiritual communion. The ancient
practice of communion had been transformed from physical acts
involving food and blood (either literal or symbolic) to a mystical
encounter through prayer.

Even the term “commune” has come to signify prayer. The result
of achieving a connection to the Divine is “nearness” and “rapture.”

> . . .softly recite thou this commune to thy Lord, and say unto
> Him: O God, my God! Fill up for me the cup of detachment
> from all things ...break off from me the shackles of this nether
> world, draw me with rapture unto Thy supernal realm . . .
> (SWAB 174)
> Intone, O my servant, the verses of God . .. and the sweetness
> of Thy melody will kindle thine own soul. (BP IX)
> Whoso reciteth, in the privacy of his own chambers, the
> verses revealed by God, the scattering angels of the Almighty
> will scatter abroad the words uttered by his mouth and cause
> the heart of every righteous man to throb. (BP IX)
As seen in the third quotation above, Bahá'í detachment does not lead
to disengagement from the world. Bahá’u’lláh forbade monasticism.
Detachment represents a freedom to act in the world without
becoming entangled or troubled if things do not go as desired.

Further, the Bahá'í definition of prayer is expanded to include
loving acts in addition to recited words.

> This is worship: to serve mankind and to minister to the
> needs of the people. Service is prayer. (PT 176)
The concept of action-prayer, as opposed to verbal prayer, may be
the start of a new paradigm. In the past, separation from the world
through living on a hilltop or at a monastery has been a way to focus
oneself completely on spiritual things and to avoid the distractions of
the world. Now, immersion in the spiritual life can be attained while
living and acting in the world. Service to humanity when performed
in a spirit of reverence becomes in itself a form of worship. If the
service is selfless and wholly for the benefit of others, a spiritual state
of detachment can be achieved that is comparable to that of the Sufi
dervish or the Christian hermit. This form of worship may be called
“engaged detachment” as a fusion of mystical and humanitarian
spirituality. This fusion is especially appropriate for the world’s
present Age of Emerging Maturity. The foremost spiritual issue
facing our planet is the need to let go of self-absorption and
recognize the interconnected oneness of humankind.

Conclusion

Progressive revelation provides a framework for understanding the
interdependence of the world’s faiths. It implies the existence of
common threads of tradition and practice along with the emergence
of new themes from age to age. The combined affect of embracing
both old and new yields a continuity of belief and practice on the one
hand, and a gradual unfoldment of innovative teachings on the other.

From this study, several insights about the nature of progressive
revelation emerge. First of all, it is apparent that many of the
innovations that are introduced by a given Manifestation of God have
precedents during the Dispensation of the previous Manifestation.
New spiritual laws, in each age, generally adjust or enhance existing
practice.

For example, the practice of praying towards Jerusalem was
inaugurated by Solomon, during the Jewish Age, practiced by Jews
and Christians thereafter, but not formalized into Law until the time
of Mu˙ammad. The direction of prayer (the Qiblih) was later
modified by both Mu˙ammad and Bahá’u’lláh, changing it to Mecca
and Bahjí respectively. It can be seen therefore that one of the
functions of each new revelation is to sort through the innovations of
the previous age and to confirm, ban or modify them. The effect is
thus more comparable to a course correction that striking out in a
totally new direction. We find, for example, the innovation of the
synagogue confirmed by Christian law, and the daily prayer practice
of Judaism and Christianity confirmed by Islamic Law.

New laws are therefore often the first obligatory implementation
of existing practices, rather than brand new innovations. In the
context of Bahá’u’lláh’s explanation that new revelation is tailored to
the needs of the age and limited by the capacity of its recipients, it
makes sense that change would be gradual.

We also find innovations from one age that are ignored or
explicitly rejected in the next, perhaps due to the lack of any divine
sanction in the first place. The Jewish practice of tefillin, the literal
wrapping of the head and hands with the words of the Law, was never
incorporated in a later revelation. Christian customs of celibate clergy
and monastic vows of poverty, were rejected by Mu˙ammad and
banned by Bahá’u’lláh. The time between the appearances of the
Manifestations of God are often marked by both creativity and
sectarian fragmentation of the body of believers. The Prophet, when
He appears, examines the innovations of the previous age, confirming
some, modifying some, prohibiting others. This serves to distinguish

innovations that are beneficial to the spiritual lives of adherents from
those that may be harmful, unnecessary or inappropriate to the new
age. New revelations clarify the best path for believers, establish a
single standard to reconcile old sectarian rivalries and thereby reunite
the people.

In the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh taught, “This is the changeless
faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in the future.” Thus Bahá’ís
would expect to find common threads running through humanity’s
spiritual history.

Ultimately, in the Bahá'í view, human spiritual history is a single
tapestry of interconnected strands.

When seen as a whole the various religions become stages in one
comprehensive divine plan. In poetic language, the New Testament
describes gentile Christians as branches grafted into the root stock of
Judaism. Without Moses and the prophets, Christianity could not
exist. The Bahá’í Writings enlarge this analogy, depicting a universal
vision of humanity’s spiritual development as a single tree with
various branches. All are leaves of one tree.

> May fanaticism and religious bigotry be unknown, all
> humanity enter the bond of brotherhood, souls consort in
> perfect agreement, the nations of earth at last hoist the
> banner of truth and the religions of the world enter the
> divine temple of oneness, for the foundations of the
heavenly religions are one reality. (FWU 12, emphasis added)
