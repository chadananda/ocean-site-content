           The Language of the Heart:

From Dream Language towards Understanding

the Language of the Heart

Wolfgang Klebel

In this paper, an attempt is made to describe a new
understanding of the heart and the way it is expressing itself.
The assumption is made that what used to be called the human
soul, is expressing itself in two different ways, using either the
brain or the heart for this self-expression in the physical world.
At the present time, usually the only acceptable way to study
this is to ignore the heart and only talk about the brain’s logical
and rational way of expressing itself. That there is more to
human self-understanding and self-expression to others is usual
not even considered.

What is crucial in this investigation is the fact that we have
awareness and self-consciousness only in the brain, i.e., we
know that we think and what we think, we are aware of what
happens, when we think and then talk or act. While this
awareness is limited, and there are things that are happening in
the brain, of which we are not aware, like how we balance our
bicycle when we ride it; in general, we know when we think. Our
thinking always can express itself in words or actions and we
can communicate with others in that way.

66                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

What happens in the heart is usually not in our awareness.

Different from the brain, the heart does not express itself in
words, but in feelings only. We get angry, or loving, we feel
disgust or annoyance etc. When these feelings become aware in
the brain we know about them, but we still do not know what
had happened in the heart to create these feeling. It is important
that the heart expresses these feelings and they are expressed in
body language, even before the brain becomes aware of it.

We all are familiar of the person who gets angry and who
shows the anger so that others can see it. When they tell him,
you are angry, he would scream back, “I am not angry,” because
his body shows the anger, but his brain was not yet aware of it.
The conclusion of this event is evident, the feelings start in the
heart, are expressed in the body first, and only later will the
brain become aware of these feelings. Every good actor knows
that the bodily expression must happen before the feelings are
verbally expressed; otherwise, the acting looks wooden and
artificial. Only when the bodily expression is prior to the verbal
expression does the acting look natural. The same is true for a
singer and we like dancing, because we can feel what the dancer
expresses.

Another issue must be stated before the findings of this
paper are described and correlated with the Writings of the
Bahá’í Faith. When this writer presents his understanding of any
statement of the Bahá’í Faith, i.e., of the Writings of the Báb,
Bahá’u’lláh or of their official interpreters, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá or
Shoghi Effendi, he only expresses his personal understanding
and does not in any way speak for the faith, leaving it always
open to every reader to find other or different interpretations
of the same Writings. It is hoped that the difference of
opinions will find a conclusion, as in any true consultation,
which is coming closer to the truth, and can be found helpful to
others.

Language of the Heart                                           67

The ability to correlate the Bahá’í Revelation with modern
thinking in science and philosophy was encouraged by Shoghi
Effendi in several places like the following.

> It is useful to review a number of statements written by
> Shoghi Effendi on this subject. To a believer who had
> completed advanced academic studies in a subject
> related to the Teachings the Guardian stated, in a letter
> written on his behalf:

> It is hoped that all the Bahá’í students will follow the
> noble example you have set before them and will,
> henceforth, be led to investigate and analyze the
> principles of the Faith and to correlate them with the
> modern aspects of philosophy and science. Every
> intelligent and thoughtful young Bahá’í should always
> approach the Cause in this way, for therein lies the very
> essence of the principle of independent investigation of
> truth.1

Returning to the theme of this article, there is a connection
between the heart and the word. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that
language is opening the box of the heart, which contains the
heart’s mysteries and secrets. Language is unlocking the heart so
we can be aware and understand what is in the heart.

> ... the function of language is to portray the mysteries
> and secrets of human hearts. The heart is like a box, and
> language is the key. Only by using the key can we open
> the box and observe the gems it contains. [PUP 60]

Bahá’u’lláh tells us in the Seven Valleys that the wayfarer in
his mystical travel after having reached the Valley of Unity with
the True One, experiences the new mystical life and asserts that
this can only be communicated from heart to heart.

> The tongue faileth in describing these three Valleys, and
> speech falleth short. The pen steppeth not into this
68                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> region; the ink leaveth only a blot. In these planes, the
> nightingale of the heart hath other songs and secrets,
> which make the heart to stir and the soul to clamor, but
> this mystery of inner meaning may be whispered only
> from heart to heart, confided only from breast to breast.
> Only heart to heart can speak the bliss of mystic
> knowers... [SVFV 30]

Clearly language is not only connected with the heart, but
there is a language of the heart, which is distinct from the
regular logical and discursive language we call the language of
the brain. In this paper we will look into this difference
between the brain language and the heart language and will
explore how they work together.

The heart in the Bahá’í Writings is given a special meaning;
concepts like the city of the heart and the citadel of the heart
are emphasizing the importance of the heart. The heart is
described as possessing sensory capacities. Bahá’u’lláh talks
about the “eye of thine heart” [KI 90], “ear of his inmost heart”
[SLH 86], “hearts have been sorely shaken” [PM 12] and the “wise
and understanding heart” [ESW 65] and suggests that one
“Ponder this in thine heart” [ESW 74].

Bahá’u’lláh seems to speak about the senses of the heart,
attributing to the heart sensual capacity like it exists in the
sense of hearing.

> The senses of hearing, of the heart, and the like, are
> similarly to be reckoned among the gifts with which the
> human body is endowed. [GWB 193]

Bahá’u’lláh’s use of the concept of the heart as a metaphor is
not scientifically or logically inconsistent with recent research
on the heart as a physical organ. There is no necessary conflict
between the two so in this paper I will demonstrate how the
metaphorical and literal concepts of the heart can work
together. In this writer’s opinion, there is a new understanding

Language of the Heart                                            69

of the relationship between the material and the spiritual
presented in the Bahá’í Writings, which is often expressed in
statements about the seen and the unseen, or the manifest and
the hidden of reality. Since this affects the understanding of the
heart, it will be presented first, before we can talk about the
language of the heart.

Based on this understanding, Bahá’u’lláh’s statements can be
correlated with the findings of modern neurocardiology, which
describes the “little brain” of the heart possessing perception,
memory and decision making ability.

> Recent work in the relatively new field of
> Neurocardiology has firmly established that the heart is a
> sensory organ and a sophisticated information encoding
> and processing center. Its circuitry enables it to learn,
> remember, and make functional decisions independent
> of the cranial brain.2
Considering the role of the heart, the question raised in this
presentation is about the form and style of the language of the
heart. Another issue is the question, in what way is this language
different from our normal language and thinking as it is
developed in the human brain? There are about 2,000 heart
transplants made in the USA annually, giving us a sufficiently
large number to study what is in the physical heart and how the
recipients of these transplants experience the new heart. There
is evidence that dreams can be transplanted together with the
heart from one person to another. Therefore, it can be
concluded that the language of the heart is similar to the
language of dreams.

Studying dream language the following distinction needs to
be made.

> The logic that we miss in the dream work is the
> syntactical logic of speech—the syntactical logic that is
> essential for the framing and testing of propositions and
> reasoning from them.3
70                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

Consequently, dreams express syntactical logic differently,
for example, causality is expressed in terms of continuity,
contradictions and conflicts are described by following pictures
that are contradictory, as will be exemplified below.

Another conclusion is made by this author from seeing many
patients with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Memories
heavily loaded with emotions seem to be located in the heart and
not in the brain; therefore, they can be transplanted with the
heart and are difficult to remove and will disturb the patient for
a long time. This sheds some light at some fundamental truth
about the heart revealed in the Bahá’í Writings.

It can be stated that the therapy based on this idea was
almost always successful in eliminating the disturbing intrusive
memories and nightmares of these patients, suffering from
Posttraumatic      Stress  Disorder.     When      my      patients
wholeheartedly remembered, or actually re-lived the emotions
connected with these disturbing memories, the feelings were
released and the memories stopped being intrusive and
disturbing. That this process happens in the heart is an
assumption this psychologist made, because in regular
memories, there is no connection of memory with strong and
disturbing feelings, and placing feelings in the heart suggests
that these memories need to be placed there too. Additionally,
as will be explained below, heart transplants tell us that dreams,
especially traumatic dreams, are transplanted with the heart to
the recipient patient.

That there is more going on in the heart than previously
known, is expressed by the Báb as well, because He has placed
the ability to understand the middle way between extremes
exclusively into the heart.

> Such conclusive truth hath been revealed through the
> gaze of the heart, and not that of intellect.
> For intellect conceives not save limited things.

Verily, bound by the realm of limitation, men are unable
Language of the Heart                                           71

> to gaze upon things simultaneously in their manifold
> aspects. This it is perplexing for them to comprehend
> that lofty station. No one can recognize the truth of the
> Middle Way between the two extreme poles except after
> attaining unto the gate of the heart and beholding the
realities of the worlds, visible and unseen. [Provisional

translation by Nader Saiedi]

When Bahá’u’lláh reveals that the heart is the seat of the
Revelation, we need to consider that it is the human heart where
this connection between the spiritual message and the physical
experience happens and we need to understand the language of
the heart to understand the Revelation as it is written in the
books and scriptures:

> Unlock, O people, the gates of the hearts of men with
> the keys of the remembrance of Him Who is the
> Remembrance of God and the Source of wisdom
> amongst you. He hath chosen out of the whole world the
> hearts of His servants, and made them each a seat for the
> revelation of His glory. [GWB 296]

In conclusion, it needs to be said that the faculty of reason,
which is an endowment of the spiritual soul, uses different
bodily instruments, i.e., the brain and the heart. They always
need to work together, but they have different languages, so
that spiritual truth has to be reasonable even in the logical
linguistic sense, and the heart has to be pure in a moral sense.
Otherwise, it will contaminate logical reason or even pervert it.
Clearly we need both, a pure heart and clear mind to understand
the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.

The relationship between matter and spirit has occupied
philosophers throughout history, from materialisms of
Democritus to Hobbes’ Leviathan and finally to Karl Marx and
the dialectical materialism of Communism, as described by
Stalin. There is the dualistic solution as presented by Descartes,
which is dominating modern science and modern thinking, and

72                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 17

the conflict between Plato and Aristotle, about what is reality,
the eternal ideas of Plato or the concrete reality as presented in
the physics and metaphysics of Aristotle, which conflict has
never really been resolved.

In recent times, Teilhard de Chardin has attempted a novel
solution by stating that matter and spirit are fundamentally
connected, are dependent on each other and are in a process of
development that has come in our days to a significant solution.
Teilhard does not see matter as very different from spirit; like
Descartes, he acknowledges an essential connection between
matter and spirit.

> It [the spirit] in no way represents some entity, which is
> independent of matter or antagonistic to it, some force
> locked up in, or floating in, the physical world. By spirit
> I mean ‘the spirit of synthesis and sublimation’, in which
> is painfully concentrated, through endless attempts and
> setbacks, the potency of unity scattered throughout the
> universal multiple: spirit, which is born within, and as a
> function of matter.5
Here we have an understanding that matter can be described
as diverse and multiple, while spirit presents unity and
integration. Both spirit and matter are together born from each
other in this description. The Bahá’í concept of Unity in
Diversity can be applied to this description of matter and spirit
as well. They need to be seen together and not separated. They
are different and the same, as Bahá’u’lláh stated when describing
the origin of the world.

> That which hath been in existence had existed before,
> but not in the form thou seest today.
> The world of existence came into being
> through the heat generated from the interaction between
> the active force and that which is its recipient.

These two are the same, yet they are different.

[TB 140]

This verse from the Tablet of Wisdom by Bahá’u’lláh was
originally one paragraph and is here separated into its
meaningful parts for better understanding. I will present here
my personal understanding of this verse, Bahá’u’lláh calls a
glorious structure. This certainly is not the only possible
understanding of this verse, nor is it of any authority. Yet, it is
the best I can present and it is open to critique. Needless to say,
it follows the prompting of my heart and has become for me a
guidance into the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh. Here is my
understanding as related to the topic of this paper.

The reason, I think that this is an important statement is the
fact that it is a change from the Worldview as presented in the
Christian tradition towards a new worldview as presented in the
Bahá’í Writings. For Christian philosophy, which follows the
Platonic tradition, the spirit is good and the matter is bad, or at
least less valuable. Dealing with the world is less valuable than
going in the monastery and dedicating oneself to the
contemplative life. Bahá’u’lláh told monks to leave the
monastery and become active in the world. Work in the world is
regarded by Him as equal to prayer if it is performed in the
right intention. Consequently, both spirit and matter are
created by God, are valuable and the difference is only that the
heart should be pure and dedicated to God, while it is detached
from everything that is worldly. The difference is in the ethic, in
the direction of the life towards God not in the matter as such.
The main obstacle for this is vain imagination that places our
desire into something worldly and false.

74                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

Bahá’u’lláh, in this verse, responds to a question about the
origin of this world. He speaks of two principles, the active
force and that which is its recipient, in this description
following seemingly the Aristotelian idea of form and primal
matter. What differentiates this verse from Aristotle is clearly
stated as well. For one, Bahá’u’lláh introduces heat into this
understanding, somehow comparable with the idea of modern
physics about the role of energy in the creation and in the
development of the world.

Then He says something surprising, namely: These two are the
same, yet they are different. Does that not mean they are
different in one aspect and the same in another? When
questioning how they are the same, Bahá’u’lláh answers this later
when stating, they are indeed created through the irresistible
Word of God which is the Cause of the entire creation, this
means they are the same because they are equally created by
God. Their difference is in their function of being polar
opposites. Here again we have Unity in Diversity. Two opposite
principles exist in Unity of being created.

Then Bahá’u’lláh describes further that all differences of
reality are caused by these two principles, created by God’s
Word when stating all else besides His Word are but the
creatures and the effects thereof. This understanding fits well
into the Bahá’í concept of inwardness versus outwardness, or
hidden versus manifest, or seen versus unseen, which describe
the external, material aspect of this world and the internal
spiritual aspect of reality. The world is always both seen and
unseen as in this Verse:

> Glorified be God Who hath vouchsafed this grace that
> encompasseth all things, whether seen or unseen! [SLH 25]

Bahá’u’lláh uses these words frequently and is always
describing this created world in those terms as seen and unseen,
as hidden and manifest. Concluding we must say that spirit and
matter in the Bahá’í understanding are not separate, they rather

constitute a unity in their opposition. This understanding needs
to be applied to the human person as well, because Bahá’u’lláh
has stated

> And thus firstness and lastness, outwardness and
> inwardness are, in the sense referred to, true of thyself...

[SVFV 27]

From this consideration, we should conclude that the heart is
constituted in this inwardness and outwardness as well; so that
the material heart is the seen aspect and what we may call the
spiritual heart, is expressing the inwardness of the human
reality. This is much more than a metaphor or an analogy
combining the different use of the word heart. Therefore,
Bahá’u’lláh stated that the heart is one and undivided [PB 52] and
the direction of the heart needs to be as well one and undivided
towards God and not towards the world.

In the following verse, Bahá’u’lláh describes the world in a
specific way as “the worlds of unity and diversity, of variation
and oneness, of limitation and detachment.” In my personal
understanding of this Verse, Bahá’u’lláh appears to explain what
He said in the other statement about the two aspects of
creation, i.e., “the active force and its recipient.” Here as well
always both sides are mentioned, the inner and outer side of
reality.

> Please God, that we avoid the land of denial, and
> advance into the ocean of acceptance, so that we may
> perceive, with an eye purged from all conflicting
> elements, the worlds of unity and diversity, of variation
> and oneness, of limitation and detachment, and wing our
> flight unto the highest and innermost sanctuary of the
> inner meaning of the Word of God. [KI 160]
The three statements about ‘Unity and Diversity’, ‘Variation
and Oneness’, ‘Limitation and Detachment’ always speak about
the same two reality principles in different words. Unity is in

76                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 17

polar opposition to Diversity, as Oneness is to Variation. The
dynamic side of this opposition is explained in the next word,
when Bahá’u’lláh speaks about Limitation and Detachment. The
physical aspect of reality, expressed in variation and
multiplicity, is the limited aspect of the world and needs to be
treated with detachment, in order that we experience the Divine
Unity and Oneness in the spiritual realm. This is indicated by
the last sentence that we wing out flight in this process unto
“the highest and innermost sanctuary of the inner meaning of
the Word of God.” This Word of God is the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh that is experienced in our heart.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains this twofold aspect of reality further
when He is talking about physical atoms held together by love.

> As we look upon the universe, we observe that all
> composite beings or existing phenomena are made up
> primarily of single elements bound together by a power
> of attraction. Through this power of attraction,
> cohesion has become manifest between atoms of these
> composing elements. The resultant being is a
> phenomenon of the lower contingent type. The power of
> cohesion expressed in the mineral kingdom is in reality
> love or affinity manifested in a low degree according to
> the exigencies of the mineral world. [FWU 88]

‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes that the power of connection in the
physical world is the power of attraction, He leaves no doubt,
that this is a spiritual power, when he said that it is actually love
of a lower degree that has this effect. In other words, he claims
that the universe is held together by a spiritual force, something
that can be compared with the unseen aspect in Bahá’u’lláh’s
description of the world of existence.

Writing in Star of the West, an early Bahá’í, Mírzá ‘Abu’l-
Fa∂l, in a speech given to Mrs. Corinne True, in the summer of
1914, explained it this way and placed the human heart in the
middle of this connection between spirit and matter. He

compared the world with the body of man, seeing the world as
an organism, as a unity composed of spirit and matter and the
heart as being the place where these two aspects connect.

> The likeness of the world is like the body of man; the
> likeness of God is like the spirit in the body. As the spirit
> pervades and controls the whole body, so likewise God
> pervades and controls the whole universe. As none of the
> limbs on the body of man are in communication with the
> spirit in the body of man and not one of the five senses
> can ever feel the spirit, therefore, God has created the
> heart in man to be the central ruler and has endowed it
> with two phases, spiritual and material. Through its
> spiritual phase the hearts absorbs the commandments of
> the spirit, and then through its material phase it
> transmits them to all parts of the body through the
> agency of the organs, veins, arteries, muscles, etc.6

Historically, it needs to be remembered here, that philosophy
until recently has never understood this unity in diversity of
matter and spirit, in this way. Only in the Bahá’í writings, and
much later in the writings of Teilhard Chardin, this rather new
and revolutionary idea was presented. Therefore, in this paper
we will not make the conventional separation of the heart as a
physical concept, and the word “heart” used in a metaphorical
sense for the spiritual aspect of man, following the statement
quoted above: “God has created the heart in man to be the
central ruler and has endowed it with two phases, spiritual and
material.”

These statements seem to be based on a description of the
sympathetic nervous system by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, who answered a
question about the autonomous nervous system with a brief but
interesting statement about this connection in the autonomic
nervous system that is connected in the heart.

> The powers of the sympathetic nerve are neither entirely
> physical nor spiritual, but are between the two. The
78                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> nerve is connected with both. Its phenomena shall be
> perfect when its spiritual and physical relations are

> receive absolute healing.

> The exposition is brief. Ponder and thou shalt
> understand the meaning. Although, on account of lack
> of time, the answer is short, by close reflection it shall
> be made long. [TAB 308]7

These and similar statements seem to be based on the
following statement of Bahá’u’lláh, Who in my opinion,
attributes to the heart all the spiritual qualities, seemingly not
distinguishing what we today call the spiritual concept of heart
as a metaphor, which is taken from the physical heart.
Obviously, when he describes the heart as the seat of His
Revelation or when He stated that God regards the human heart
as His possession, this can only be attributed to the spiritual
aspect of the heart, yet as Bahá’u’lláh said, these two aspects of
creation, the seen and the unseen are the same and are different
which we here apply to the heart as well.

In my opinion this is expressed by Bahá’u’lláh in the
following quote, where He states that the spirit, mind, soul, is
one single reality which uses the body faculties and senses as its
instruments. Does that not mean that the human body, being an
instrument of the spirit, is directly connected with this spiritual
power, which makes us do and act according to our will?

> Say: Spirit, mind, soul, and the powers of sight and
> hearing are but one single reality, which hath manifold
> expressions owing to the diversity of its instruments. As

> thou dost observe, man's power to comprehend, move,
> speak, hear, and see all derive from this sign of his Lord
> within him. It is single in its essence, yet manifold
> through the diversity of its instruments. This, verily, is a
> certain truth. [SLH 235]

Here again Bahá’u’lláh seems to uses the concept of unity in
diversity, when He said It is single in its essence, yet manifold
through the diversity of its instruments. What must not be
forgotten, in my opinion, is the fact that this unity of the spirit
and diversity of the bodily instruments needs to be seen
together or better it must be seen one in the other and not
artificially separated as modern thinking usually does. When in
the following the heart is mentioned we need to look into the
instrumentality of the heart as defined by neurocardiology and
make the conclusion towards the spirituality, which is using this
instrument for its spiritual purpose.

It needs to be explained how the science of quantum physics
can contribute to the understanding of Bahá’u’lláh’s statement
that the spirit or the soul uses the body, in our case the heart
and the brain as an instrument. The dualism of Descartes cannot
really explain this instrumentality of the body towards the
spiritual in the human person.

Descartes suggested that the body works like a machine, that
it has material properties. The mind (or soul), on the other hand,
was described as a nonmaterial and does not follow the laws of
nature. Descartes argued that the mind interacts with the body
at the pineal gland. Leibniz introduced the monad, a
preprogrammed entity where this interaction occurred more or
less by itself. Neither of these solutions really solved the
problem.

In the interpretation of quantum mechanics, a new solution
to this problem seems to be presented. There, the possibility is
described that the nerve connections, the synapses in the brain
are so small, that quantum effects are happening. By definition,

80                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

quantum effects are not physically determined, but are
determined by human consciousness, actually by the instrument
that forces one or the other complementary effects to become
observable. Since the instruments are manmade, it is the human
consciousness that causes these effects. Depending on the
instrument, light shows its wave aspect or its particle aspect.
This is called complementarity; the two aspects are
complementary.

When this is applied to the quantum effects in the nerve
endings, in the synapses, than it appears possible that the human
consciousness makes the difference and therefor it can be said
that the human spirit or will does influence the quantum
mechanical effects in the brain and similarly in the little brain
of the heart to cause the body to do what the spirit wants. If
this idea is carried to its conclusions, then this would be the
mechanism by which the mind directs the body. This way, it is
explained how the body becomes an instrument of the spirit as
stated by Bahá’u’lláh.

This is described by Evan Harris Walker in his book The
Physics of Consciousness, The Quantum Mind and the Meaning
of Life:8

> Consciousness is the collation of potentialities that
> develop as these electrons and these structures of the
> brain interact (as quantum elements). By creating the
> possibilities, that we experience as consciousness, and by
> selecting—by willing—which synapse will fire, mind
> brings into reality each moment’s thoughts, experiences
> and actions.

Correlating this interpretation of quantum mechanics with
the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh about the instrumentality of the
body gives a deeper understanding to theses scientific findings.
On the other hand, it is suggested here, that this explanation can
be helpful in understanding what Bahá’u’lláh stated, that the
mind uses the body as an instrument. The transition from the

spiritual mind to the physical brain becomes understandable,
when we assume that there are quantum effects involved. This
makes sense, because quantum effects even in physical
experiments, are not physically determined, but are caused by
human conscious decisions. In these physical experiments, it is
the human consciousness that causes one or the other of the
complimentary aspects of reality to become evident.

As I understand this, and this is my personal opinion,
without any authority, the following can be stated. An
instrument shapes what it does according to the shape of the
instrument. The physical shape of an instrument is certainly in
relation with its function and use. Therefore, the physical
quality of the instrument is important and needs to be related to
its use.

Unfortunately, today, people see the spiritual and the
material as separated and the connection is only in the fact that
the material provides the metaphor to express the spiritual. The
following monograph about the heart is based on this outdated
understanding.

> As the muscle which is the original source of these
> metaphorical applications brings life to the whole body,
> so heart refers to the core-force of personality at the
> center of its life. Because we do not want to limit the
> self with the name of intellect alone, or will alone, or
> feeling alone, nor to see these as separate, we have
> invented the sensibly opaque name of heart for the
> identifying core of our agency.9

A new and fundamentally different understanding of reality
is what is guiding me in this and other papers about the heart
and I have developed this understanding when trying to
understand the Bahá’í Writings. Therefore, the metaphorical use
of the concept heart is actually based on more than external
similarity; it is based on a real essential connection between the

82                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

seen and the unseen, the spiritual and the material as the
fundamental principles of reality.

From this very specific point of view, I have tried to
understand what the different instrumentality of the heart is, as
compared with that of the brain. The following findings are to
be understood in this way and the formulation of the language
of the heart is based on this difference. This difference between
the heart and the brain becomes apparent in the little child and
in dreams where the brain does not play an important role,
because it is shut down in sleep and yet undeveloped in the
child.

The heart does not sleep and is fully functioning when the
child is born; so we now turn our attention to the language of
the dream and the little child. Michael Robinson, in analyzing
Freud’s The Interpretation of Dreams, comes to a new
understanding of the primary process thinking as it is expressed
in dreams. He finds that the primary process thinking is
essentially different from the secondary or normal process of
reasoning. Freud had developed the understanding that there is a
difference between primary process thinking, which is the
thinking of the little child and which is present in dreams as well
and secondary thinking, which is the logical discursive thinking
of the adult.

> Beginning with Freud, a number of authors have

> this distinctive feature of dream language as follows:
> “The logic that we miss in the dream work is the
> syntactical logic of speech—the syntactical logic that is
> essential for the framing and testing of propositions and
> reasoning from them.”10

Let us follow up on this consideration that primary process
thinking is found in dreams and in little children. In both cases,
the thinking is concentrated in the heart. The brain of the little
child is not much developed before the age of two and the
development of higher logical thinking is possible only after the
age of twelve, according to Piaget. A similar situation is found
in dreams, when the brain is sleeping, but the heart is still
working normally.

As stated before, according to modern neurocardiology there
is a “little brain” of the heart, which has perception, memory
and decision making ability.

> Neurocardiology has firmly established that the heart is a
> sensory organ and a sophisticated information encoding
> and processing center. Its circuitry enables it to learn,
> remember, and make functional decisions independent
> of the cranial brain.11

The question we need to ask her is the following: Is this
“little brain” of the heart involved in dreaming? We must ask
because from evidence gathered from heart transplant patients
we know that some of them dream dreams of the previous
owner of the heart. This cannot be explained any other way then
by assuming that the dream memory was transplanted with the
heart. One especially significant case is reported in a book by
Paul Pearsall:

The fact that the heart after a transplant can remember
dreams, and details of traumatic events, as reported in several
other cases of this book as well,13 seems proof that the
memories located in the heart can be remembered as dreams. It
is reported in this book that a heart transplant patient had
“surprisingly accurate dreams about her donor” together with
other changes, such as food tastes, music preferences, and
emotional states, which these patients never experienced before.

In contrast to normal memories that are probably located in
the brain and can be reached by association, memories which
happened under severe emotional stress are located in the heart
and remembered in dreams or in intrusive memories, as is
known in the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder. Having treated
many patients with this disorder, the explanation that traumatic
memories are in the heart seems to explain best what could be
observed in their treatment. That is what happened to the girl in
question. She remembered the traumatic experience of the
previous owner of the heart in her dreams, just like this girl
would have remembered it if she was not killed. The heart
survived and did the same what it would have done in the other
girl, i.e., remembering the traumatic experience in recurring
nightmares.

If this is the case, then we have to conclude that the dream-
work that produces the dream is located in the “little brain of
the heart” also or better, that the heart is used by the mind of
the dreamer, when she is dreaming. That means that dreams are
not made up and remembered by using the brain but the heart,
they are following the primary process of thinking, not the
normal secondary process. Yet, when dreams are remembered,
they are remembered in the brain and translated into the normal
language of the brain, which makes it difficult to interpret
them. Therefore, the conclusion seems to be convincing that
they are originally not in the brain, but in the heart.

An example of this primary process dream thinking can be
presented by a communication from a patient to this

86                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

psychologist. Here a conditional situation is presented in two
opposing dreams following immediately each other. The patient
reported several experiences where she had dreamed about the
future death of family members, with the details of the time and
the circumstances of their death.

Then she reported another situation, where she had dreamed
about the death of her son, who was a teenager and involved at
the time in gang violence and one time was almost killed. She
reported that she had two dreams about him; one was that her
son is being killed and in the immediately following dream, her
son was being placed in detention. Following this dream
message, she reported to the therapist that she called daily the
police about her son’s illegal activities until the police arrested
him and placed him into custody.

She further told this psychologist that her son did well after
that and is now a responsible adult with a nice family.
Interestingly enough, she reported that her son never forgave
her for putting him into prison. She, on the other hand,
understood the message of her heart given her in the dream as
correct and never regretted what she needed to do.

Another dream told by a Bahá’í friend tells another way how
a dream can solve a problem of the dreamer not in logical
explanations but in presenting an action, which is solving the
problem. This Bahá’í friend reported that as child she was the
only Bahá’í in school and could not understand why nobody
understood the truth about religion. She blamed Christ who had
not educated Christians well enough so they could understand.
Many years later, she had the following dream:

First, she was at the sermon of the mount, and tried to get
close to Christ and tell him of her concern, but could not get
near to him to tell him. This picture depicts her frustration
about Christ not having informed Christians well about the fact
of progressive revelation.

In the next picture she was at the Garden of Ridván, the
place near Bagdad where Bahá’u’lláh announced his prophetic
claims to his followers. She was at the entrance wall near a door,
hoping to see Bahá’u’lláh in the tent in the midst of the Garden.
Suddenly Christ came and walked into the garden and then
turned into the Tent where Bahá’u’lláh was.

So she understood that Christ and Bahá’u’lláh in their Divine
station, are the same person, like all the other Manifestations of
God as Bahá’u’lláh has stated, describing progressive revelation:

> Viewed in this light, they are all but Messengers of that
> ideal King, that unchangeable Essence. And were they all
> to proclaim, “I am the Seal of the Prophets,” they, verily,
> utter but the truth, beyond the faintest shadow of
> doubt. For they all are but one person, one soul, one
> spirit, one being, one revelation. [GWB 53]

The unity of all Divine Manifestations is presented in this
dream by the fact that wanting to see Bahá’u’lláh she only
observed Christ going to where she expected Bahá’u’lláh to be.

These dreams explain that in the primary process thinking,
conditional thoughts and complex relationships cannot be
expressed directly, except, like in this case, as describing one
event or a complex relationship in two opposing or different
pictures, following immediately after each other. In the first
situation the dreamer decided in her heart that her son needs to
be in custody, otherwise, he would be killed, and she followed
this extremely difficult decision, as soon she has become aware
of it during the remembering of her dream.

In the dream of the Bahá’í lady, one Manifestation going into
the tent of another Manifestation expressed the fact that they
are in their divine station one, as is described in the Bahá’í
Writings. Both these dreams tell us how dream language
expresses thoughts that are difficult to understand in the logical
discursive way of thinking, but can also be presented in a

88                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 17

language using pictures and events expressing the same truth.
This way of understanding is deeper and afterwards may be
expressed and available to the logical mind. The implications of
these pictures are that they have a higher degree of
understanding and certitude, which logical discursive language
and thinking cannot give.

When considering these two ways of thinking as a Gegensatz
or Polar Opposites, we must realize that in human thinking
always both ways are present in a balanced but always changing
mixture. This fact gives human thinking a quality that is not
only deeper than computer logic, but also able to reach into
areas of reality where logic alone cannot go very far, especially
into the spiritual realm where the deepest truths about man and
reality are considered. Most Westerners are raised in the
scientific way of thinking, which generally does not regard the
human heart as more than a blood-pump and uses simple
deductions and logical structures, unable to go deeper and listen
to the heart.

When people first read the Bahá’í Writings, they are difficult
to understand until one opens the heart and follows the
language of the heart; usually then understanding follows and
the Writings become valuable and personally meaningful. The
same is true about other religious writings like the Bible or the
Qur´an. This issue needs much more investigation and scientific
verification, but is here mentioned because it opens up the issue
of consciousness and of different ways of thinking that underlie
some of the Bahá’í Writings.

Another understanding of this way of thinking and of its
importance is the story of scientific inventions being made in
dreams, like the following story of the invention of the
chemical formula of benzene by Kekulé in the so-called
ouroboros dream as described in Wikipedia under the name
Kekulé:

> The new understanding of
> benzene, and hence of all
> aromatic compounds, proved
> to be so important for both
> pure and applied chemistry
> after 1865 that in 1890 the
> German Chemical Society
> organized     an     elaborate
> appreciation    in    Kekulé's
> honor, celebrating the twenty-
> fifth anniversary of his first benzene paper. Here Kekulé
> spoke of the creation of the theory. He said that he had
> discovered the ring shape of the benzene molecule after
> having a reverie or day-dream of a snake seizing its own
> tail (this is an ancient symbol known as the ouroboros.)
> This vision, he said, came to him after years of studying
> the nature of carbon-carbon bonds.14

In this picture, we can see the heart’s way of thinking in the
primary process in the picture of the snake swallowing her own
tail, which Kekulé then translated into the secondary or logical
secondary process of thinking as the solution of a chemical
formula organized in a circular way as a ring.

Here we encounter again the issue of the difference between
the heart as a biological organ with what is called “the little
brain of the heart” and the distinct existence of a mind, in this
case using the heart and not the brain to express itself. This
different instrument of the mind seems to result in a different
kind of language that is called primary process thinking in the
psychoanalytic theory. The reason to place this thinking into the
heart has to do with findings from heart transplants, where
dreams, which could only belong to the original owner of the
heart, are dreamt by the person who received the heart
transplant.

We need to assume that the memory of dreams is in the heart,
so it stands to reason that the actual dream work is done be the

90                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

heart as well, but can only become aware in the mind. The mind
using the brain then understands the dream that originally is
expressed in primary process thinking now in secondary process
thinking. In fact, that is the theme of the article of Michael
Robins. Placing all of this thinking of the heart as the
instrument of primary process thinking, solves this problem and
explains how this thinking that happens outside of awareness is
eventually translated into the normal thinking and language in
using the brain.

In this understanding, we use the mind or consciousness as
encompassing two different styles of thinking, i.e. the primary
process of dream thinking and the normal secondary process of
logical thinking. What makes this understanding so difficult is
the fact that consciousness or awareness is only present in the
normal or secondary process thinking and we have only indirect
access to the primary process thinking if it is translated into
secondary process thinking.

Correlating this to the Bahá’í Writings we can make the
assumption that the special way of understanding that is placed
in the heart has to do with this difference. It further can be
assumed that the primary process thinking of the heart, as
evident in dreams, might not totally describe all what is
happening when the mind uses the heart’s way of thinking.

The following statement is the epistemological explanation
of why there are different meanings possible of the same
statement. The answer is clear: because of the different ways of
understanding. In a one-dimensional world, only one meaning is
possible, if there are more than one dimensions or levels of
understandings of the world then more than one meaning is
possible, which relate to the different dimensions of the world
and of the understanding of the world.

The German Theologian Romano Guardini at the end of his
book Der Gegensatz15 presents another interesting consideration
about the way concrete reality is understood. He distinguishes
three levels of understanding: rational, trans-rational and super-

rational (in German: “Rational,” “Außer-Rational” and “Über-
Rational”).

This consideration is essential to the topic of this paper. It is
the self, it is the human consciousness that attempts to
understand the reality of this world, the method of this
understanding is part and partial of what reality is all about.
Strangely enough, most scientific inquiries into the issue about
reality do not seem even to consider this question.

When science excludes anything besides materiality from
investigation, when the mind is understood as a function of
physical nerves and their interaction, then such questions can be
avoided totally. This gives us the classical understanding of
reality as organized like a machine, no wholeness, no meaning,
just efficient cause and effect. This picture is then applied to
the mind; the way they understand reality and consciousness
becomes an epiphenomenon of the nervous system, but has no
reality other than a material, which can then be described as
functioning strictly in a causal sense, excluding free will and
purpose, meaning and beauty from serious considerations. Man
is nothing more than a reacting physical entity, reacting to
stimuli like the pigeon in the Skinner box or like a mechanical
machine to the forces impinging on it in the environment.

In contrast to this so-called “scientific” understanding and its
corresponding epistemology, Guardini describes three ways of
understanding reality. The first is the rational understanding
forming concepts, which abstracts from the concrete individual
reality and forms a general idea. In order to individualize we
have to give this thing, this animal or person a name or indicate
that we mean this house and not the other house next to it.
Fortunately, houses have numbers and people and pets have
names, otherwise we could not speak about an individual person
without describing some features that are specific to that
individual, or pointing to that individual, like in criminal court.

Guardini describes another way of understanding, which he
calls intuition. This way of understanding Guardini calls trans-

92                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

rational (“Außer-Rational”), which he describes as a clear and
normal way of understanding. Additionally, he places these two
ways of understanding in polar opposition, so that the
conceptual, abstract way of understanding can never be totally
separated from the intuitive concrete way of understanding.

Whenever we think of a general abstract concept, like that of
“cat”, or felineness, we somehow have the concrete experience
and picture of a specific individual cat or cats in mind. Only
that makes the abstract thought possible and meaningful.

And whenever we think or talk about an individual cat, for
example, the abstract concept of cat is in the horizon of our
understanding as well, because we know always both, the focus
and concentration may be on the individual or on the abstract
concept, but both cannot be thought about without the other
side, i.e., its opposite being included and in some way this
defines the idea of either a particular animal or person or, on
the other hand, the idea of animal-ness, or humanness which is
considered. Even if we invent a fictitious animal, like the
unicorn, we have to make a picture of it in our mind, and this
picture will be concrete of such an animal and not abstract as
the concept of unicorn-ness would be.

We can say that these two ways of understanding are
complementary. The word intuition is used in the German
language and in English in the same way, as defined in
dictionaries and as presented here from Wikipedia.

> mind; however, processes by which and why they happen

> typically remain mostly unknown to the thinker, as
> opposed to the view of rational thinking.

After that discussion, the third way of understanding is
mentioned by Guardini with some caution. He claims that the
mystery of the living is not in the intuitive versus the rational
understanding, but in this third way of understanding that he
calls super-rational. It is a higher understanding than reason or
intuition, it is the understanding of the whole, of the unity of
reality and it is achieved in the tension between rational and
intuitive understanding. It is not a Hegelian synthesis, which
abolishes the other ways of understanding; it is an original, a
first and essential understanding, which is actually very simple
in its complicatedness. Any attempt to define this logically, is
bound to fail. The core and the mystery of the concrete reality
can only be understood in an act of knowing, that has the same
structure as the reality, and this is what Guardini calls vision
(Anschauung):

> To understand the core of the living reality and to
> approach its mystery is not a nebulous imagination, it
> rather takes vision (Anschauung), which is possible only
> in the tension, and in respect of the mystery, which
> requires discipline and self-control.16

Guardini describes further this concept and indicates that any
one-sidedness destroys this tension of understanding reality;
that it leads to erroneous simplifications, and to false
explications and failure to understand truthfully. Only the
oppositeness of this relationship allows the human mind to
grasp the whole and to use rational understanding and intuitive
perception in a scientific and philosophically correct way in
approaching reality. Rationalism and intellectualism, if used
one-sidedly, will be opposed by Intuitionism, or Romanticism
and Mysticism and both will fail to understand reality as it
really is.

94                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

Three quarters of a century before Guardini described the
three ways of understanding reality, Bahá’u’lláh had talked
about three differing planes of understanding in the Seven
Valleys. In the following these statements of Bahá’u’lláh and
Guardini will be correlated with each other to better understand
both, even though these two statements have been made in
different centuries.

Here is the statement of Bahá’u’lláh:

> Thus, for that they move on these three differing planes,
> the understanding and the words of the wayfarers have
> differed; and hence the sign of conflict doth continually
> appear on earth.

> For some there are who dwell upon the plane of oneness
> and speak of that world, and some inhabit the realms of
> limitation, and some the grades of self, while others are
> completely veiled. [SVFV 20]

This chart shows
how the statements
of Guardini can be
correlated with the
Verse      from    the
Seven Valleys of
Bahá’u’lláh.      This
correlation actually
is    seen    in   the
arrangement here, in
spite of the fact that
the order of description is different and Guardini orders the
first two ways of understanding different from Bahá’u’lláh’s
planes of understanding. Since these two ways of understanding
are polar opposites, they can be seen from one side or the other.

The third way of understanding of Guardini, and the first in
Bahá’u’lláh’s description is described by Bahá’u’lláh as used by

those who dwell on the Plane of Oneness. According to the
Bahá’í Faith, this oneness or unity is understood as ‘Unity in
Diversity’ [WOB 41] and the better and deeper we understand
this concept the more and deeper we are dwelling upon the
plane of oneness.

Finally, it is described by Bahá’u’lláh what this vision or this
way of understanding actually produces, it sees the unity in the
polar opposites so that this paragraph concludes in the
statement: “Then what life have words, on such a plane, that
‘first’ and ‘last’ or other than these be seen or mentioned! In
this realm, the first is the last itself, and the last is but the
first.” This can be correlated with what Guardini’s epistemology
describes as “Anschauung” or Vision.

The next not transcendent and more limited plane or mode of
understanding is, according to Bahá’u’lláh, that “some inhabit
the realms of limitation.” This is the realm of rational and
logical thinking, where understanding is based on abstractions
from the concrete. Therefore, this understanding is limited;
abstraction meaning limiting the understanding from the
concrete to the less concrete and more abstract. Guardini calls
this Rational Understanding; it is the rational understanding and
the area of discursive logic.

Another plane described by Bahá’u’lláh is by “some [inhabit]
the grades of self” including those who use concrete intuition
of the reality, which is based on the understanding self and is
not the full understanding of oneness. In Guardini’s
epistemology, this grade is similarly called Trans-Rational or
Intuitional.

Not much has to be said about those who are “completely
veiled.” This would include the strict materialists, who ignore
anything except the material that can be counted and used in
mathematics. They do not see reality-as-it-is—material and
spiritual—at all.

96                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

It needs to be noted that this text from the Seven Valleys by
Bahá’u’lláh was written almost hundred years before Guardini
independently found a similar understanding in contemplating
reality, seen in the light of Catholic Philosophical Theology.
Nevertheless, the correlation is astonishing. It is important to
consider that Bahá’u’lláh talks about three differing planes of
understanding and Guardini calls all of them rational, even
though he distinguishes between rational, trans-rational and
super-rational, none of these ways of knowing are irrational and
the rational faculty of man encompasses all three of these
capabilities.

This Vision is necessary to understand the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh; it is the understanding of Spirituality, of Unity and
Oneness, as being revealed in the Writings of the Bahá’í Faith.
In the following verse, Bahá’u’lláh is praying for his followers
to acquire this vision, so they can understand His Revelation.

> I beg of Thee, O my Lord, by Thine eye that sleepeth
> not, to guard mine eyes from beholding aught beside
> Thee. Strengthen, then, their vision that they may discern
> Thy signs, and behold the Horizon of Thy Revelation.

[PM 263]

This adds a new understanding to these polar opposite
concepts of Inwardness and Outwardness, as presented in the
Seven Valleys of Bahá’u’lláh, [SVFV 27] an understanding that
perceives these concepts from the point of Oneness and brings
the Unity of these concepts to light. In this paragraph, more is
said about the wayfarers who find this new understanding of
reality. In any logical description and graphical presentation of
this unity in diversity, this essential unity is not shown and has
to be introduced by the observer, because the opposite terms
are in and through each other, are in unity and not separated.

The wayfarers observing this situation are described by
Bahá’u’lláh as “those personages who in a single step have
passed over the world of the relative and the limited, and dwelt

on the fair plane of the Absolute, and pitched their tent in the
worlds of authority and command.” Here the transcendence of
this understanding is stressed from the relative and limited,
logical and rational understanding to the understanding of the
absolute and to an understanding that is based on authority and
command. This seems to indicate the authority of the
Revelation and the command of the Manifestation.

The process of this endeavor is described by Bahá’u’lláh as
having “burned away these relativities with a single spark, and
blotted out these words with a drop of dew” [SVFV 27]. In fact,
this process of violently burning away something is contrasted
in the next picture of blotting it out with a drop of dew, a
rather quiet and insignificant activity, so we can conclude that
Bahá’u’lláh indicates that this process is mild and insignificant
as well as violent and drastic, a polar opposite of processes
directing our intention into a higher level of action, a level that
can be called mystical or spiritual, which transcends the polar
oppositeness of burning versus blotting out with a drop of dew.

In this context, it needs to be noted that even Guardini in
similar ways mentioned that this vision requires a special effort,
when he states that this “is possible only in the tension, and in
respect of the mystery, which requires discipline and self-
control.”

Bahá’u’lláh further asserts, that “they swim in the sea of the
spirit, and soar in the holy air of light” [SVFV 27]. This clearly
indicates that this approach to knowing is a spiritual effort and
presupposes an understanding of the spiritual aspect of reality,
which is expressed in the vision of unity of the polar concepts
of Inwardness versus Outwardness.

Whenever this concept is mentioned this transcendent
understanding, this vision of unity of the modes of
understanding, needs to be always kept in mind. When the polar
opposite concepts that form this structure are considered in this
way, their unity is actually the spiritual understanding of reality.

Depending on how we look at the self, we see different and
opposing aspects, which have to be understood as potential
aspects of the one reality, or modes of how reality can be
perceived. The principal unity of this reality of the self or of
the physical reality should never be overlooked and has always
to be considered in order to see the whole. In other words, we
cannot understand the whole of reality in our rational mind, we
have to see these different modes and perceive them as
complementary in order to see the whole, to see reality as it
actually is. Similarly, Guardini said this vision takes discipline
and self-control, and this process is compared by Bahá’u’lláh as
burning away the differences and blotting out the oppositeness
of created reality.

It needs to be considered that this approach is not irrational;
it is super-rational as Guardini called it and it exists in the
tension between the rational and trans-rational, i.e., between
the abstracting rational mind and the intuitional concrete
understanding of reality. It adds a third dimension to the human
rationality, a dimension that is open to understanding the super-
rational, the ultimate reality, which is the mystery of the world.
How the mind and the heart are involved in this process has
been described above, so the Bahá’í understanding of the heart
can be compared with the new science of neuroradiology and
quantum mechanics, where a new correlation between these two
understanding of the function of the heart are developed.

Bahá’u’lláh describes this primary process thinking of the
heart as the thinking of unity or oneness, or the thinking of
those who “swim in the sea of the spirit, and soar in the holy air
of light” or the thinking of those who “have passed over the
world of the relative and the limited, and dwelt on the fair plane
of the Absolute” [SVFV 27]. Placing this kind of thinking into
the heart makes good sense because the Writing of the Báb and
of Bahá’u’lláh seem to do just that. In conclusion, it can be
stated that the heart has a different way of thinking, as is
known from our interpretation of dreams, but that dream
thinking is only part of heart thinking, which includes the

thinking of oneness or of the spirit, as the Bahá’í Writings
claim.

The two aspects of the spiritual and physical or the seen and
unseen is the topic of several of Bahá’u’lláh statements like this.

> I beseech Thee, by Thy Cause that hath encompassed the
> world of being, and by Thy Name wherewith Thou hast
> subjected the seen and unseen, to adorn the peoples of
> the earth with the light of Thy justice, and to illuminate
> their hearts with the brightness of Thy knowledge. [ESW
> 37]

First Bahá’u’lláh seems to state here that His Cause is
encompassing the world of being, which he then describes as the
seen and the unseen, and then he states that His believers have
to illuminate their hearts with the brightness of Thy knowledge.
This new knowledge of the Bahá’í Revelation seems to be this
very new understanding of the world as seen and unseen, as
spiritual and material.

As mentioned before, the Báb proposes how such conflicting,
yet complementary attributes of the same thing or idea are to be
unified only in the heart when He said:

> Such conclusive truth hath been revealed through the
> gaze of the heart, and not that of intellect. For intellect
> conceives not save limited things.

> Verily, bound by the realm of limitation, men are unable
> to gaze upon things simultaneously in their manifold
> aspects. This it is perplexing for them to comprehend
> that lofty station.

> No one can recognize the truth of the Middle Way
> between the two extreme poles except after attaining
> unto the gate of the heart and beholding the realities of
> the worlds, visible and unseen. (translated by Saiedi, ibid.)17
100                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

What the Báb calls here the middle way of understanding is
called the understanding of oneness by Bahá’u’lláh and this
vision of reality needs to be placed in the heart according to the
Báb. This is expressed by Bahá’u’lláh as the heart being the seat
of the Revelation. In our thinking of the language of the heart
we have to add another consideration.

As the rational process in the heart is without awareness, we
only know about this process if we become aware of it in the
thinking, which is based on the brain. In other words, this vision
of the unity of reality is unconscious and has to become
conscious in the brain on the level of the rational and
intuitional thinking process; therefore, it takes effort and
experience to do this, in fact the ongoing reading of the Bahá’í
Revelation will produce this effect, as this Revelation needs to
be understood in the heart and will eventually become aware in
the brain in a logical and discursive manner.

It seems to be the specific ability of the heart to see the unity
in any oppositional statements. There is an interesting
consequence to all these considerations. The importance of the
heart over the brain, which seems to be expressed in the Bahá’í
Writings, is based on the fact that both are necessary but
emotionally and spiritually the heart—when pure and under the
influence of the Divine Spirit—is the seat of the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh:

> Unlock, O people, the gates of the hearts of men with
> the keys of the remembrance of Him Who is the
> Remembrance of God and the Source of wisdom
> amongst you. He hath chosen out of the whole world the
> hearts of His servants, and made them each a seat for the
> revelation of His glory. [GWB 296-297]

It must be understood here that the language of the heart is
not the same as the language of the brain and needs translation
to be understood. This means several things. Poetry, for
example, is originated in the heart and then translated into the

brain language, which makes it an art and, therefore, it speaks
to the heart of the reader. The same process underlies the poetic
aspect of the revelation; hence the special language of any
revelation has this poetic style and needs to be understood by
the heart. It speaks directly to the heart but needs to be
understood by the brain; or rather, it needs to be internally
translated to the logical and intuitional ability of the human
brain to be fully understood.

This is a process that can be observed in anybody that at first
is presented by the Bahá’í Revelation. When I became a Bahá’í
at first I could not really understand what it meant, but enjoyed
the poetic style and was convinced of its truth. Only when I
became more deepened in the Writings, the meaning and
structure became apparent, a process that does not end so that
new meaning is forthcoming, whenever a text of the Revelation
is read again or a new text is approached.

It is not easy to describe this process, but most Bahá’ís go
through this development. The fact that Bahá’u’lláh asks us to
daily read his Writings is based on this need to practice this
process, to learn more and more how to translate from the heart
to the mind and ever deeper step into the Ocean of His
Revelation.

Interpreting the biblical concept of the New Heaven and
New Earth Bahá’u’lláh revealed that here heaven means the
Divine Revelation and earth the Understanding of man of this
Revelation.

> And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first
> heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there
> was no more sea. [Revelation 21:1]

In the following verse, He speaks of the earth of the heart of
the believer, indicating that their hearts understand His
Revelation and its divine knowledge and wisdom.

102                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> Know thou, that upon whatever hearts the bountiful
> showers of mercy, raining from the “heaven” of divine
> Revelation, have fallen, the earth of those hearts hath
> verily been changed into the earth of divine knowledge
> and wisdom. [KI 45]

The process of translating the language of the heart into the
language of the brain is used frequently when interpreting
dreams. In a letter ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gives an example of dream
interpretation.

> O thou handmaid of God! In this day, to thank God for
> His bounties consisteth in possessing a radiant heart, and
> a soul open to the promptings of the spirit....

> As for that mighty solar orb which thou didst behold in
> thy dream, that was the Promised One, and its spreading
> rays were His bounties, and the translucent surface of
> the mass of water signifieth hearts that are undefiled and
> pure, while the surging waves denote the great
> excitement of those hearts and the fact that they were
> shaken and deeply moved, that is, the waves are the
> stirrings of the spirit and holy intimations of the soul.
> Praise thou God that in the world of the dream thou hast
> witnessed such disclosures. [SWAB 179]

In the introduction, he remarks that the writer of the letter
to him is a person with a radiant heart and a soul open to the
prompting of the spirit. This is allowing interpreting the dream
and finding the mystical meaning of this dream.

We can conclude that what in brain thinking is called
opposition, or conditional thinking, is seen by heart as thinking
in unity or in spiritual unification. This appears to be a
Gegensatz in the sense of Guardini, or the specific way of
human thinking that always includes sides, the brain-thinking
and the heart-thinking, with the emphasis on thinking when
awake on the brain, and in dream thinking on the heart, because

the brain is asleep. This seems to be what distinguishes human
thinking from the work of the computer, were only the logical
thinking of the brain is introduced into the machine. In the
human mind, there is always the Gegensatz, the polar opposition
of brain and heart present, in a more or less intensive
connection. Only in the dream, when the brain is excluded by
sleep, the heart thinking is present, but, when we wake up, that
kind of thinking has to be translated by the brain into the
normal style of thinking to become aware and to be possibly
understood.

When it is understood that the human rational understanding
of reality is a limited understanding, it becomes clear that there
must be another understanding that transcends this
understanding and is more adequate to understand reality. This
higher understanding is described by Bahá’u’lláh as the Dwelling
on the Plane of Oneness and they swim in the sea of the spirit,
and soar in the holy air of light. The correlation of this
statement with the idea of vision, as presented by Guardini,
seems to expand what Guardini said and helps us to understand
the vision of oneness as is presented in the above quoted verse.

These considerations are based on the understanding of the
Bahá’í Writings that the mind or the soul, with its rational
faculty, is using the body, in this case the brain and the heart, as
instruments of their action. When the mind is active, most of
the time both, the brain and the heart are used as instruments,
yet, not all what is in the mind can be in the brain or heart, like
for example a typewriter has all the letters of the writing and
brings them to paper, without having any understanding of
what the writings communicate.

The fact that in all rational thought both, the primary
process thinking of the heart and the logical discursive thinking
of the brain are involved makes reason essentially different
from computer logic of a machine. Using Guardini’s
epistemology as correlated with the Bahá’í Writings, we find
that the brain thinking consists in a polar opposite between

104                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

rational and intuitive thinking. Transcending this way of
thinking of the brain is the thinking of the heart, which is
expressed in primary process thinking, which we called vision.

Rationalism, therefore, must always be understood as open
to the different way of thinking of the heart. Both of these two
ways of thinking, the one that uses the brain i.e. rationalism and
the other that uses the heart as an instrument, we can call
mysticism, must be open and interpreted by the rational brain.
The problems involved into this relationship have activated the
history of philosophy and it could be conceived that placing the
mystical or primary process thinking into the heart, as the
Bahá’í Writings seem to do, could be a new and heuristic
valuable way of seeing this issue of the human rational faculty,
which is usually understood under the concept of the human
mind using the brain.

The respective quotes from the Bahá’í Writing will follow
here. It is clearly stated that both the heart and the brain must
work together to find the truth, especially the truth about
religion.

> And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is that religion
> must be in conformity with science and reason, so that it
> may influence the hearts of men. The foundation must
> be solid and must not consist of imitations. [SWAB 299]

One of the most distinguishing differences between the brain
and the heart is the fact that the brain is divided into a right and
left hemisphere and how they work together in logical and
discursive though is not yet fully understood. In opposition to
this is the fact that the little brain of the heart does not have
this distinction or separation and seems to be undivided as
expressed in this statement by Bahá’u’lláh. This has ethical or
moral consequences, which are important to notice especially
when considering the understanding of the Divine Revelation.

> And as the human heart, as fashioned by God, is one and
> undivided, it behoveth thee to take heed that its
> affections be, also, one and undivided. Cleave thou,
> therefore, with the whole affection of thine heart, unto
> His love, and withdraw it from the love of any one
> besides Him, that He may aid thee to immerse thyself in
> the ocean of His unity, and enable thee to become a true
> upholder of His oneness. [PB 52]

This issue needs much further investigation, but is here
mentioned because it opens up the issue of consciousness and
of different ways of thinking that underlie some of the
understanding of the Bahá’í Revelation.

As mentioned before, the Báb proposes how such conflicting,
yet complementary attributes of the same thing or idea are to be
unified only in the heart. It seems to be the specific ability of
the heart, or better, of the mind using the heart as his
instrument of expression to be able to see the unity in any
oppositional statements. There is an interesting consequence to
all these considerations. The importance of the heart over the
brain which seems to be expressed in the Bahá’í Writings is
based on the fact that both are necessary but emotionally and
spiritually the heart—when pure and under the influence of the
Divine Spirit—is what gives peace and certitude to human
understanding as stated here by Bahá’u’lláh and as has been
found in the study of the heart by the HeartMath Institute.

> God shall bestow upon his heart a divine tranquillity and
> cause him to be of them that are at peace with
> themselves. [GDM 23]

Another conclusion of this paper is the understanding that
the revelatory writings of all religions are actually speaking to
the heart more than to the brain. Nevertheless, the brain is not
neglected either because it must be used in order to make the
language of the heart come to awareness in the brain and be
interpreted in the logical way of the brain. To approach any

106                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

Revelation with this understanding can explain the specific style
of all revelatory scriptures and will further explain, why it is
difficult to understand these writings in the beginning, until the
mind gets used to this approach and learns to use the heart in
the process of understanding. It explains further, how these
writings can be misunderstood and called irrational and not
meaningful by persons, who do not use their heart or by people
who have a morally corrupted heart and do not want to
understand.

That the heart has an important function in understanding
Divine Revelation is stressed by Bahá’u’lláh who insists that to
understand revelation the heart must be pure. Further He
frequently states that the heart is the seat of revelation and that
His words have to be pondered in the heart.

> Do thou ponder these momentous happenings in thy
> heart, so that thou mayest apprehend the greatness of
> this Revelation, and perceive its stupendous glory. [KI
> 236]

The affinity revelatory writings have with poetry and the fact
that some of them even take the form of poetry can be
explained by the fact that poetry speaks primarily to the heart
and only secondarily can be understood by the brain. This is
true also for revelations, they are understood by the heart and
only after that are scrutinized and evaluated by the logical
mind. It could be said that the language of the heart is not only
the language of dreams but also the language of poesy; it is how
spiritual values and understandings are expressed. Ultimately, it
can be stated that the language of the heart is the language of
Divine Revelation.

The difficulty of this way of distinguishing between language
of the heart and of the brain is in the fact that we can
understand the language of the heart only with the mind, using
the logical brain for this process, so we always have to do with a
translation from the heart to the brain and have no awareness in

the heart itself, except its feelings, to become aware of what
goes on in the heart, we can only use the logical mind.

The awareness of the heart is in its feelings, in other words,
when the heart responds, there are responding feelings of which
we are aware. That might be the reason why ‘Abdu’l-Bahá often
asked Bahá’ís, “are you happy?” which happiness would be
indicating the positive response of the heart.

Most Westerners are well trained in using the brain and have
little access to their understanding heart. They have to
overcome this brain training in order to understand better the
writings of revelation. This can only be done when one
immerses oneself into these writings and slowly learns to
understand them.

> In conclusion, the following can be stated:
1. There are three ways of seeing reality, according to

> Guardini and as revealed more deeply before by
> Bahá’u’lláh in the Seven Valleys.
2. The first is the abstract and limited logical thinking; the

3. There is a third ways of understanding reality, which was

4. This third way of thinking seems to be happening in the

5. Since there is no awareness in the heart, heart language

6. The same problem is present in the understanding of

7. All Divine Revelations can only be fully understood when

8. This process of translating mystical or heart language into

9. Only a pure heart as Bahá’u’lláh stated or as it is said in

> the Gospel of Matthew [5:8] “Blessed are the pure in heart:
> for they shall see God” is able to understand this, which
> becomes an issue of the ethical behavior of the reader, and
> which is a precondition of understanding the Word of
> God in any revelation.
These conclusions shed light on some issues of revelation and
personal communication between people. It is the need to
consider the language of the heart and the requirement of the
heart to be pure in order to see God and understand His
revelation. This ethical requirement for the acceptance of a
revelation needs to be further explored, especially as it affects
the heart and the ability to develop a vision that can understand
revelation.

It appears that one must get seriously involved in the
writings of any revelation to understand them; especially
modern man who is trained only in the rational understanding
and often has lost the ability to understand mystical writings
that speak to the heart. The moral condition that the heart must
be pure to understand such writings is a prerequisite, which
needs to be considered in any deeper understanding of truth,
truth that is revealed by a Manifestation of God, or even is
revealed between people in fully understanding each other. The

psychological condition of the state of a pure heart could be a
special topic for further investigations.

This condition was stated by Bahá’u’lláh in His Arabic
Hidden Words:

> 1. O SON OF SPIRIT!
> My first counsel is this: Possess a pure, kindly and
> radiant heart, that thine may be a sovereignty ancient,
> imperishable and everlasting. [HW Ar. #1]
