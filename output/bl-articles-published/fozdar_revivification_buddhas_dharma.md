  The Revivification of the Buddha's Dharma

Jamshed K. Fozdar

Abstract

The thesis deals briefly with the Buddha's Dharma (Religion), its
unrivaled impact upon the spiritual canvas of Asia, the fundamental
motivation of its Founder, its flowering "springtime", its "summer" heat
and its present "winter", and most importantly the portents for its
revivification and the return to its pristine glory through the only possible
process - a recurrence of the "Buddha-rising" - the advent once again of
the Divine Teacher - in this instance, the Buddha Maitrya-Amitabha.

Introduction

The Founder of Buddhism, Siddharta Gautama, who lived in India around
563 B.C. and died in his eightieth year, is one of history's greatest leaders
of mankind. He ranks among the handful of men who founded the other
great Religions and his influence for the good for over two millennia upon
the conduct of the greater part of Asia's humanity is unsurpassed.

While the real achievement of the Buddha consists of the rejuvenating
effect His teaching exerted in purifying human society in the India of His
time and extricating it from the morass of idol worship and animal
slaughter into which the Hindu masses had become entangled, and which
to the common man constituted the gamut of what he conceived to be
"religion" - yet His Dharma of spiritual salvation, like those of the other
great Faiths, also had its temporal fruit, which for centuries after the
Buddha's passing provided a humane praxis of life for those then
fortunate enough to have taken shelter under its mighty tree.

ESSENCE

The sense of universality which the Buddha imparted to the power of the
eternal Dharma, as we see in this most poignant passage on that greatest
of all ingredients "love" - for creating and sustaining any human
relationship - has never been surpassed in the beauty and breadth of its
meaning since the time it was first enunciated by Him over twenty five
centuries ago. "Just as with her own life a mother shields from hurt her
own, her only child, let all-embracing thoughts for all that live be thine
- an all-embracing love for all the universe, in all its heights and depths
and breadth, unstinted love, unmarred by hate within, not rousing
enmity."1 And the virtuous life: "Get up (rouse yourself), do not be
thoughtless. Follow the law of virtue. He who practices virtue lives
happily in this world as well as in the world beyond. Follow the law of
virtue do not follow the law of sin. He who practices virtue lives happily
in this world as well as in the world beyond. "2

The Buddha often compared Himself to the beautiful lotus blossom that
grows from the world and stands above it.

"Just as a blue, red or white lotus, although born in the water, grown up
in the water, when it reaches the surface stands there unsoiled by the
water - just so, Brahmin, although born in the world, grown up in the
world, having overcome the world, I abide unsoiled in the world. Take
it that I am Buddha, Brahmin."3 and this example is also given of
themselves by the Buddha's predecessors - the Avatars of Hinduism -
Ram and Krishna and is equally applicable for describing every Divine
Teacher, be He Moses, Muhammad, Christ, Baha'u'llah, Zoroaster and
others. And, as He proclaimed, Buddhahood is a station qo "worldling"
can attain or fully understand. "Not only by disciplined conduct and
vows, not only by much learning, nor moreover by the attainment of
meditative calm nor by sleeping solitary, do I reach the happiness of

release which no worldling can attain. O mendicant, do not he
confident so long as you have not reached the extinction of impurities. "4

The divinity of the Buddha is also unequivocally asserted in the
Mahapadana-Suttanta. And for those who think it is easy to invent true
Religion, the Buddha denounces as vile heresy the view that His Dharma is
something thought out by Himself and warns one of His apostles Sariputta
and others through him to not categorize Him as merely another wise man
who preaches a path of salvation, devised through trial and error.
u

Whoever, Sariputta, knowing that it is so of me, seeing that it is so,
should speak thus; There are no states of further-men, no excellent
cognition and insight befitting the Ariyans in the recluse Gotama; the
recluse Gotama teaches Dhamma on (a system of) his own devising beaten
out by reasoning and based on investigation.' If he does not retract that
speech, Sariputta, if he does not retract that thought, if he does not cast
out that view, he is verily consigned to Niraya Hell according to his
deserts. Even if he were a monk, Sariputta, endowed with moral habit,
concentration and wisdom who should here and now arrive at gnosis, I
(still) say that this results thus: If he does not retract that speech and that
thought, if he does not cast out that view, he is verily consigned to Niraya
Hell according to his deserts. "5

No matter what heights of spirituality or knowledge a disciple may attain,
if he misjudges this all-important aspect of the phenomenon of
Buddhahood (Avatar), then he is verily consigned to Niraya Hell. Not
only does the Buddha claim here that His own state is beyond man
(further-men) but also that the Dharma itself has no relationship to any
system derived by human logic or investigation, once again confirming
that this unique phenomenon of the Manifestation (Avatar), the Buddha
and His Message (the Dharma), is from the realm of the wholly beyond -
an exaltation from the Absolute.

The correct perspective from which to view the Buddha and His doctrine
would be, according to His own words, as one of the fully enlightened

Dhammapada. vv. 150, 151.

Beings - continuously manifesting Themselves for the guidance and
salvation of humanity - the fully omniscient Teachers of mankind.

"Do not call the Tathagata by His name nor address Him as 'friend',
for He is the Buddha, the Holy One, The Buddha looks with a kind

> heart equally on all beings, and they therefore call Him 'Father'. To
> disrespect a father is wrong; to despise him is wicked. "6

We are cautioned from falling into the trap of relating Him to any
objective reality. The lesser can never truly define or understand the
greater, and it is futile to think of the Buddha in terms of man-conceived
dimensions or attributes. The Tathagata (Buddha) cannot be grasped. He
leaves no trace by which He can be tracked. All that can be said is that
"He is", and it is idle to pursue and define His Reality in spatio-temporal
terms: "Since a Tathagata, even when actually present, is
incomprehensible, it is inept to call him - the Uttermost Person, the
Supernal Person, the Attainer of the Supernal - that after dying the
Tathagata is, or is not, or both is and is not, or neither is nor is not. "7

ACHIEVEMENTS

The Buddha's Teaching of salvation and love, like the Religions of the
other great Divine Teachers, also established a mighty but humane
civilization with its own temporal organs and artistic grandeur, first
within His own native land and then in most of the lands of Asia,
bestowing a sense of morality in life where there had been none and a
wider view of humanity to those who had reached the stage of nationhood,
eventually bringing within the pale of its influence a fifth of the human
race.

Spiritual "Springtime"...

Contemporary records of those times tell us that during the Buddha's
lifetime His Faith spread to the Indo-Gangetic plain. It took another three

\[6\] Mahavagga. 1.6

\[7\] Samvutta-nikava. 111.118

centuries to reach Ceylon (Sri Lanka), which was the exception in being
opened to the Buddha's Dharma (Teachings) this early in its history.
From Ceylon the Dharma spread to Burma seven centuries later and it
would be another three centuries before it would reach Thailand and
Cambodia and later to Indonesia. Buddhist missionaries also from Ceylon
entered China a thousand years after the Buddha's passing and then
Korea and Japan soon after.

We are fortunate in having accounts of those temporal achievements of
the Buddha's Dharma in the land of His birth, left to us in the narratives
of various Chinese monks and Greek dignitaries who travelled to the
courts of some of the great Indian monarchs who had espoused the
Buddha's Gospel. And those records, related briefly, will serve to give us
some idea of how great and dynamic was the pure Path in those times and
what it has now become - obscure and unfrequented, lost and awaiting a
"Buddha-rising" to restore it once again to its former glory.

... and its "Summer Heat"

First, let us begin with Asoka (274 - 232 B.C.), foremost among the
monarchs who espoused the Buddha's teachings and spread them across
the length and breadth of India as well as such foreign countries as
Ceylon, Greece, Egypt, Persia and Rome. This same Asoka, who had
slaughtered tens of thousands in his thirst for empire, after acknowledging
his allegiance to the Buddha became a being transformed. History shows
no equal among kings or commoners to match Asoka's missionary
success and moral stature, and we must constantly bear in mind that this
was over two millennia ago. The influence his missions exerted is one of
the greatest civilizing factors in the world's history. They were
established in lands where the inhabitants were, for the most part, savage
and superstitious, and spiritualized them. They became great centers of
commerce and learning where once they were wild and savage. His edicts
like a string through pearls, established a common system of values both
humane and just. All this great flowering of culture occurred over two
thousand years ago, and today in our times, despite the tremendous
changes that have come upon those regions through military conquests,
natural disasters and the impact of other great ideologies, the proof of the
heights of civilisation that they reached and the humane progress that was

56              THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

achieved by the power of the pure Dharma are still evident from the
structures of great edifices and social patterns among the populace of
those lands. And we can gauge the tremendous sway the Buddha's
teachings held over the heart and mind of this great conqueror from the
edicts which Asoka had carved in rock to announce to all his subjects the
lessons of the Dharma: "Devanampriya (beloved of the gods) desires
towards all beings: abstention from hurting, restraint in behaviour, and
treatment equal with one's self and softness. And this conquest is
considered the principal one by Devampriya, viz, the conquest by
morality. And this (conquest) has been won repeatedly by Devanampriya,
both here and among all beyond the borders. This conquest, which has
been won by this everywhere, a conquest (won) everywhere (and)
repeatedly, causes the feeling of satisfaction."8

And it was this same Asoka who, prior to his conversion to Buddhism,
lived in the lap of grandeur unrivaled by Susa in all its glory or the
magnificence of Ecbatana, (capital of Alexander the Great), who so
changed his rule from destruction to construction, from death to life, that
Greek chroniclers of his empire record that famines and wars were almost
unknown. Irrigation received special attention - the greater part of the
country was under irrigation and bore two crops a year. Artificial lakes
and dams were constructed wherever feasible, trade flourished, and a
cosmopolitan crowd of merchants from various parts of Africa, Greece
and Asia could be seen in the bazaars of Asoka's capital of Pataliputra.
Goods from Southern India, the Golden Chersonese, China, Mesopotamia
and the Greek cities of Asia Minor were displayed in the stalls, and like
everything else in the Empire, their sale was strictly regulated and
controlled. Silks, muslins, the finer sorts of cloth, cutlery and armour,
brocades, embroideries and rugs, perfumes and drugs, ivory and ivory
work, jewellery and gold (seldom silver) these were the main articles in
which the merchants of his empire dealt. Accounts of this wealth were
related by Persian travellers who visited his empire. The Artha-Sastra
(codex of Commerce) gives elaborate shipping regulations, and there was
considerable coastal trade - Indian merchant vessels crossed the Indian
Ocean to the mouth of the Tigris and to Aden. In their trade compacts
and social relationships too, the subjects of Asoka were not lacking in

excellence. Truthfulness was the predominant Indian characteristic of
those times, and this is confirmed by Greek travellers: "No Indian has
ever been convicted of lying." In signing contracts, witnesses and seals
were considered to be superfluous, and houses were left unguarded. The
women were well treated, and wives had their dowries as their private
property. A husband could be punished for cruelty, and offences against
women were severely dealt with. Slavery was unknown.

After Asoka's conversion to Buddhism by his barber Upagupta of
Mathura a low caste, he foreswore war and governed in the light of the
law only - the Dharma or the Law of Piety laid down by the Buddha: The
reverberations of the war-drums became the reverberation of the drum of
the Law - the only true victory is that effected by the Law of Piety - and
he earnestly adjured his sons and grandsons to bear in mind, if ever they
would be tempted by the lust for empire, the worthlessness of conquest by
force. The conquest of the Law, he assured them, is alone a conquest full
of delight. As time went on, Asoka became more and more religious. He
had entered the Buddhist order as a lay brother; he now became a monk
and determined to use the Civil Service inaugurated by his grandfather
(Chandragupta Maurya) to propagate the Law throughout his dominions.
"Everywhere in my dominions my (officers)... shall tour for the following
instruction in morality as well as for other business. Meritorious is
obedience to mother and father. Meritorious is liberality to friends,
acquaintances and relatives and to the Brahmanas and Sramanas.
Meritorious is abstention from the slaughter of living beings. Meritorious
is to spend little and store little."9

In order that the people might clearly understand what was expected of
them, edicts were engraved on rocks or pillars set up in places where they
were most likely to attract the attention of the passerby. These were
erected at places as far apart as Peshawar, Kathiawar, the Nepal frontier,
Orissa and Mysore - "the Law, wherever pillars of stone or tables of
stone exist, must be recorded, so that it may long endure." The Law, as
enjoined by Asoka, was strictly practical and suited to the popular
understanding. No mention is made of metaphysical subtleties. It
consists of compassion, liberality, truth, purity, gentleness and saintliness

of life, "hearkening to elders, reverence to the aged, and seemly treatment
of Brahmins and ascetics, of the poor and wretched, yea, even servants."10
These virtues said Asoka's dictums will bring the only true happiness, in
this world and the next. Asoka's first thought was for the comfort and
well-being of his subjects. On the main roads, shade-trees were planted,
wells dug, and hospitals erected for men and animals. Education, as in
most Buddhist countries, was widely disseminated by the monasteries,
otherwise the edicts would have been of little avail.

Jails were thrown open on the anniversary of the Emperor's coronation.
Prisoners under sentence of death were given a respite in which they could
lodge an appeal and were visited by pious men who would prepare their
souls. Governors were given wide latitude in granting pardons. One of
Asoka's chief reforms was to carry into practice the Buddha's law of
ahimsa (non-violence), kindness to all living things. He gradually and
progressively stopped the slaughter of animals, setting the example
himself. The royal hunt was abolished, killing for the royal kitchens was
cut down, animal sacrifices were forbidden, and a closed season was
introduced for various beasts and birds.

One of the Emperor's chief concerns was to introduce complete religious
tolerance. There were to be no wars of religion in his empire. He warned
his people of the evils of schism and deprecated the habit of exalting one's
own views at the expenses of others. Though a convinced Buddhist, he
extended his patronage to Brahmins, Jains and other sects with complete
impartiality. A characteristic action was the construction of the costly
caves at Barabar for the naked ascetics of the Ajivika sect founded by
Gosala, the rival of Mahavira. Asoka proclaimed, that, "The growth of
the essentials (of Dharma) is possible in many ways. But its root lies in
restraint in regard to speech, which means that there would be no
extolment of one's own sect or disparagement of other sects on
inappropriate occasions and that it should be moderate in every case, even
on appropriate occasions. On the contrary, other sects should be duly
honoured in every way on all occasions. If a person acts in this way, he
not only promotes his own sect but also benefits other sects. But if a

\[10\] Asoka's Rock Edict, No. XII, Girnar.

The Revivification of the Buddha 9s Dharma               59

person acts otherwise, he not only injures his own sect but also harms
other sects."11

Asoka and then after him his son Mahinda who took the Dharma to
Ceylon, were followed by a line of worthy successors. Among them
Kanishka, Harsha and others. All shining products of the Buddha's
Dharma.

The Dharma's "Winter"

It is only too obvious that the Noble Eight fold Path which had purified a
major portion of the human race in the past, is now too overlain with the
brambles of superstitious rites, narrow allegiances, hatreds and greed - all
products of ignorance regarding the Dharma's real aim. Only a Buddha
can now renew the eternal Dharma and, utterly purified, offer it once
again to humanity as the sure path to salvation. Only a Buddha can again
imbue the Dharma with its ancient potency and enlarge its scope to make
it a haven of hope and motivation to one and all, regardless of colour,
caste or creed. Covered up with man-made accretions, superstitions and
rituals the Dharma has been converted into a preserve of the elite and their
instrument for personal gain and no longer what the Buddha intended it to
be, free as the air for all to breathe as their birth right: (tThe Dharmma
has been taught by me without making a distinction between esoteric
and exoteric. For Buddhas have not the closed fist of a teacher in
respect of mental states. "12

... and Eclipse

As is only too evident, the Reality of the Buddha-Dharma has long since
ceased to play any part in our lives and has instead been substituted by
meaningless practices and superstitious rites before statues of mud, stone,
silver and gold produced by the hand of man mostly for commercial
purposes - the very practices that the Buddha emphatically forbade:
"Rituals have no efficacy; prayers are vain repetitions and incantations
have no saving power. But to abandon covetousness and best to become

\[12\] Digha-nikava. n.100
60              THE SINGAPORE BAHA'I STUDIES REVIEW

free from evil passions, and to give up all hatred and ill will, that is the

right sacrifice and the true worship. "13

While empty chantings and yellow robes linger on, the spirit is no more.
The Dharma is no longer able to motivate the rhythm of our hearts or the
vibration of our minds. We have, most of us, totally disobeyed the
Buddha. How then can one expect to be enlightened despite such flagrant
disobedience? The pure Dharma is no longer a living force in our
behaviour towards our fellow beings, instead it exists only as some
passive formula in the lifeless pages of books, or in temples of cold stone.
Hardly one among ten thousand gives mind to the admonitions of the
Buddha and cares to know His purpose for us. Even fewer bother to
endeavour to tread the Noble Eight-fold Path, which is a way of living -
not a way of outward appearances and empty talk - to forge us into
impregnable barriers against the insidious inroads of moral decay.

Flickering embers still testify to its past glory

Despite the multitude of different concepts about the Buddha's Teaching
that we find proliferating today, championed by the various schools of
Buddhist thought, yet a few aspects of His Dharma are still nominally
subscribed to by all Buddhists.           Principally, they concern the
fundamentals of a pure life as laid down in the Four Noble Truths and the
Noble Eight-Fold Path. The Four Noble Truths are: Duhkha (sorrow),
Samudaya (the cause of Sorrow), Nirodha (the removal of Sorrow) and
Marga (the way leading to it). The Noble Eight-Fold Path sums up the
Buddha's Doctrine on how to attain Nirvana (salvation). The first two
stages deal with the correct attitude: Right View and Right Aspiration.
The next three state the moral and social requirements to be met: Right
Speech, Right Conduct and Right Means of Livelihood; and the last three
concern the mental and spiritual disciplines necessary; Right Endeavour,
Right Mindfulness, and Right Contemplation.

Despite the utter simplicity of these fundamental precepts of the Buddha's
doctrine, the average person finds it easier, on the whole, to worship his
so-called "gods" than to practice these precepts in everyday life. Hence

the Buddha constantly reminded His followers that the Dharma is to be an
act of living the life, a carrying out of one's duties towards one's fellow
creatures, and not mere chanting of supplications. To enable His
followers to be on guard against straying from the protection of His
system, it is said that He asked them to constantly remind themselves of
their Faith and their obligations by bringing to mind the three Jewels.14

For the third time to the Samghafor refuge I go.

In slightly altered form it is the creed for all the great Faiths. Here, it
simply depicts a universally accepted phenomenon in Religion - the
Divine Manifestation, the Buddha - finding and proclaiming once again
the eternal Dharma and entrusting it to the care of the Samgha to nurture
it and tend it to grow in order to make it into a safe refuge for the
humanity of that time.

Every Religion worth the name begins with a burst of spiritual
enlightenment like the dawn lighting up the night sky. In time it achieves
its noonday brilliance and then finally its setting, and the night of the spirit
follows to await yet another Avatar, a new Buddha-rising to bring forth a
new awakening, new hope. The original direct contact and living belief in
every Religion gives way to indirect and loose contact through
intermediaries (monks, priests, etc.), themselves far removed from the
Source. The living faith, born of dynamic inquiry is replaced by
complacency and institutionalized vested interests which guarantee
salvation by ritualistic performances, such as bathing in a holy river, or
making an offering at a famous temple, or worshipping a tooth or tree.

places become market places for adventurers who prey upon the unwary
and superstitious. The disinclination of the masses to give up the easy life
plays into the hands of those self-appointed guardians (the bhikus,
sannyasins, acharyas, etc.) of man's soul, who further their own
ambitions for power and pelf, and who survive and fatten only by feeding
on their hapless victim - imprisoning the psyche and strangling the
spiritual within man - until at last, the Divine Sun appears once more to
dispel the spiritual darkness and its night-creatures and permits the soul of
man to again breathe free. This is the story of man and His Religion.
One without the other does not exist. And so it is for all of us, even more
so now as we survey our own situation, within whichever Faith we have
placed our allegiance.

Having completely profaned the Dharma's precepts in every conceivable
manner through our acts towards our fellow beings, we try to assuage
both the Buddha and Mara (the Evil One) by periodically offering
sacrifices of some worthless trinket while all the time aware that the true
sacrifice for achieving Nirvana (spiritual liberation) does not consist of
some material trifle or some rites to be performed only at fixed seasons,
but, is an incessant operation every moment of our life where every
function down to our very breathing is laid on the altar of purity. To
recognize the magnitude of our present predicament we have only to ask
ourselves - what if anything, remains of that Triple Refuge (The Three
Jewels) - the Buddha, the Dharma and the Samgha*? Yes, and the
Samgha?

How goes it with the Samgha? What has the Samgha become today? It
is, indeed, remarkable how closely interwoven the monastic community
was with the life of the clans in Magadha in the first centuries of Buddhist
history. The assemblage of monks composing the Samgha was a simple
and natural instrument created by the Buddha in the India of that time to
serve, by virtue of their special devotion, sacrifice and diligence, as the
elder brothers to the lay community. The Samgha's mission was to
emphasize for their own advancement of spirit and for the weal of the
laity the concentrations and actions prescribed by the Dharma to attain
Nirvana. Unfortunately, the five simple commandments of the Buddha -

(clergy)

> 1.   Abstention from taking lives on all occasions
> 2.   Abstention from covetousness
> 3.   Abstentionfromfalse speech
> 4.   Abstention from intoxicants
5.   Abstention from going wrong about sensuous

pleasures15

- are no longer the code by which the Samgha, not to mention the lay
Buddhists, conduct their lives. This, despite the Buddha's explicit
warning: "... O mendicant, be not negligent. Let not your thought
delight in sensual pleasures, ... that you may not cry out when burning.
'This is suffering!* " 1 6

The Samgha, the promulgator and guardian of the Dharma, in times long
past, is now riven with division and intrigue and has itself become the
major contributory factor in accelerating the Dharma' s decay and its
present tragic plight.

Instead of transcending national boundaries and promulgating the
universal message of love and compassion entrusted to it by the Buddha,
the Samgha has in most if not all Buddhist countries subordinated the
interests of humanity to national goals and narrow ambitions of national
leaders, clearly involving itself in the course of empire and conflict,
similar to the acts of the clergy of the other Faiths, but, totally against
every principle of the Buddha's Dharma. By such ways has the Samgha
lost the allegiance of the common man as well as the respect of the rulers
who see it as weak, opportunistic and unprincipled, too preoccupied with
holding on to its declining influence over the superstitious by its all too
blatant attempts at magic and miracles, wholly against the Buddha's
admonition: "/ forbid you, O bikkus to employ any spells or
supplications, for they are useless since the law of Karma governs all
things. He who attempts to perform miracles has not understood the

n
doctrine of the Tathagata (Buddha). "

64            THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ1 STUDIES REVIEW

The Buddha, more than all others and like His peers, the Avatars (Divine
Messengers), saw only too well that the tricks of magicians, and
manipulation of physical phenomena cannot in the end have any lasting
effect on the real purpose of His mission - the salvation of humanity, the
restoring of faith and virtue within the human heart - since that could only
be achieved through Love, Truth, Justice and living the life. This
transformation of human nature effected by the Buddha and the Founders
of other world religions, is clearly the greatest miracle of man's history,
for it is the true cause of the flowering of great civilizations, before which
a jump from the earth to the moon, the cure for cancer, heart transplants,
etc., pale into insignificance and without which none of those could ever
have seen the light of day.

REQUIREMENT FOR REVIVIFICATION

For the Dharma to once again become relevant to the needs of our world,
it is clear that its message will have to be renewed to address the entire
human race, since humanity now stands in need of not merely a reiteration
of the Dharma's high and noble principles, but - far more urgent - its
dynamic particpation in providing both direction and example for
overcoming the real problems which plague society in these most perilous
of times. Lifting mankind from the depths of despair and anguish to the
dawn of a new day of joy is the only task now worthy of the Dharma's
mettle if it is to successfully meet this challenge and fan anew the dying
embers of faith in the breast of a desperate and cynical humanity into a
blazing fire, which will evaporate the frigidity of aloofness and hostility
and forge its allegiance into an invincible host, capable of making this
earth into a paradise.

But in order to achieve this all-important goal of re-establishing the
Dharma on to its former pedestal of life-bestowing potency for humanity,
it is first necessary to restore humanity's faith in that process of salvation
unequivocally proclaimed by the Buddha and all the other Divine
Teachers - the unfailing Law of Progressive Revelation.

"The Buddhas who have been and who shall be;

Of these am I and what they did I do ... "18 And: "All the Buddhas are
exactly the same as regards Buddha-dhammas. "19

A continuity of Religions is clearly asserted here by the Buddha, Who
also affirms that these periodic Spiritual Sunrises are identical in their
essence. However, while the essence of the Dharma is eternal in the realm
of its own Reality, yet its appearance and operation in this phenomenal
world is subject to the unvarying law of change. Nothing in the
phenomenal world is eternal. Even the glory of the Dharma, is finally
obscured from humanity as we stray farther and farther away from its
truth, by our greed and wrong-doing. Thus, lost to the eyes of mankind,
the pure Dharma awaits the advent of yet another Buddha - Maitrya - to
unearth it and, Who, after once more sweeping it clean of men's fancies
and corrupting machinations, must restore it to its pristine purity, its
ancient glory, to serve as a shining beacon, so that humanity's storm-
tossed ship, may find again its safe haven.

"That, verily, is a safe haven , that is the best haven; after having got to
that haven a man is delivered from all pains. ,,2°

A continuity of Religions - each joined to the other in progressive
succession and thus explaining the need for renewal as well as the reason
for their successive obsolescence - is an immutable spiritual law. No
earnest and open-minded follower of the Buddha can any longer deny that
magnificent Wats and Temples and statues of clay and precious stones are
no substitute for the true Teacher. Nor can a collection of forms,
outmoded rites and empty phrases provide that vital potency of the
Dharma's ancient essence in order to triumph against the onslaught of a
perverse age whose coming darkness the Buddha so clearly and fully
foretold.

History has no example to offer on how religions can be revivified by any
humanly conceived scheme or mechanism. As any student of history
knows, such attempts have only led to division and fragmentation, not a

revivification of the original creed or of its pristine purity. To wit Martin
Luther's "protestations" against corruption in Roman Catholicism merely
created Protestantism, and similar examples can be easily cited in all other
faiths.

Nothing short of a "Buddha-rising" - the advent of the promised Buddha
Maitrya-Amitabha can sweep away from the Dharma the morass of
accretions which centuries of human greed and ignorance have created to
obscure its pristine message of salvation and well-being. And only a
"Buddha-rising" can recreate the pure concept of the Samga and mould it
into a dynamic instrument for offering a revivified Dharma as the panacea
for our travailing age - the safe haven for humanity.

Conclusion

The Buddha boldly proclaimed the recurrence of "Buddha-risings" -
progressive revelation of the Divine - at long intervals of time and placed
His own mission within the framework of that process of "Buddha-
risings" - as one among others.

His famous narrative concerning the advent of His Successor - Maitrya -
begins with His apostle, Sariputta asking the Buddha:
"The Hero that shall follow you,

> The Buddha - of what sort will he be?
> I want to hear of him in full.

Let the Visioned One describe him."21
To which the Buddha replies:
"1 will tell you, Sariputta,

> Listen to my speech.
> In this auspicious aeon
> Three leaders have there been:
> Kakasandha, Konagamana
> And the leader Kessapa too.

I am now the perfect Buddha;

\[21\] Anagatavamasa.

> And there will be Metteyya too
> Before this same auspicious aeon
> Runs to the end of its years.
> The perfect Buddha, Metteyya
> By name, supreme of men."22

The Buddha then describes at length the legendary exploits and
attainments of Maitrya (Metteyya) and then entertains Sariputta's further
questions concerning the time and conditions relating to Maitrya's
appearance, all of which He answers in detail.

While, unlike the adventist scriptures of other Faiths, the prophetic
utterances of the Buddha regarding the Promised Maitrya-Amitabha do
not lend themselves to "one-liners", nevertheless, after years of research
into the adventist scriptures of both the Theravada and Mahayana schools
of Buddhism, the author's 500 page thesis Buddha Maitrya-Amitabha
Has Appeared (ISBN. 81-85091-83-8)23 conclusively proves that
Baha'u'llah the Founder of the Baha'i Faith is indeed the risen Maitrya-
Amitabha awaited by the Buddhists to effect the revivification of the
Dharma.
