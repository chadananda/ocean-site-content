       The Duty of Kindness and Sympathy Towards

Strangers and Foreigners
as recommended by `Abdu’l-Bahá and as reflected in the recent Italian
“Charter on the Values and Significance of Citizenship and Integration.”

Julio Savi

The abandonment of racial, religious and nationalistic prejudice is one of
the central issues in the talks `Abdu’l-Bahá delivered during His travels
in the West. A ground-breaking concept in those days when the Western
world was still “heaving with the explosive forces of a blind and trium-
phant nationalism,” the idea of integrating immigrants into the culture
of the country where they have moved is slowing becoming a part of the
policy of a number of Western states. In 2007 the Italian government
issued a “Charter on the Values and Significance of Citizenship and Inte-
gration,” which upholds many of the concepts expounded by `Abdu’l-Bahá
almost a century ago.

The abandonment of racial, religious and nationalistic
prejudice in `Abdu’l-Bahá’s talks
`Abdu’l-Bahá’s first speech in Paris, on the 16th and 17th of October

1911, recorded in Paris Talks, was entirely devoted to the subject of
“The duty of kindness and sympathy towards strangers and foreigners.”

He asked His audience:

> Let not conventionality cause you to seem cold and unsym-
> pathetic when you meet strange people from other countries.

Do not look at them as though you suspected them of being

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Twelve

> evil-doers, thieves and boors… be kind to the strangers…
> help to make them feel at home… Put into practice the
> Teaching of Bahá’u’lláh, that of kindness to all nations.(PT
> 1–2, sec. 1, para. 2, 3, 7)

This recommendation was a first step towards the explanation of one
of the central issues of His Western talks: the abandonment of racial,
religious and nationalistic prejudice.1 A few weeks later, in a speech
to Paris’ Theosophical Society, He explained that “All the divisions
in the world, hatred, war and bloodshed, are caused by one or other
of these prejudices”(PT 134, sec. 40, para. 20). On other occasions
He said that prejudice is “the destroyer of the body politic”(PUP 124,
13 May 1912)2 and “an obstacle to realization”(PUP 115, 12 May
1912).3 And on the 13th of November 1911, He devoted a whole
speech to “the abolition of prejudices… whether of religion, race,
politics or nation,” presented as “the fifth principle” of “the Teaching
of Bahá’u’lláh”(PT 151–6, sec. 45).4 In that circumstance He pre-
sented prejudice as “a grave malady which, unless arrested, is capable
of causing the destruction of the whole human race”(ibid. 151, sec.
45, para. 1). In North America He repeatedly mentioned this prin-
ciple, sometimes as “the fifth principle or teaching of Bahá’u’lláh…
the abandoning of religious, racial, patriotic and political prejudices,
which destroy the foundations of human society”(PUP 107, 7 May
1912, see 316).5 On the 1st of September 1912, at the Church of the
Messiah, in Montreal, Canada, He delivered another whole talk on
this subject(PUP 297–302).6 He said that all prejudices are “opposed
to reality… [and] against the will and plan of God”(ibid. 299), that
they are “nothing but superstition… as they are against the plan and
purpose of reality, they are false and imaginary”(ibid.), “falsehoods
and violations of the will of God”(ibid. 300).

As to religious prejudice, which He described in a talk wholly devoted
to this issue and delivered in Paris on the 27th of October 1911 as

The Duty of Kindness and Sympathy Towards Strangers

the consequence of “the misrepresentation of religion by the religious
leaders and teachers”(PT 37, sec. 13, para. 2),7 He said:

> The Prophets of God have been inspired with the message
> of love and unity. The Books of God have been revealed for
> the upbuilding of fellowship and union. The Prophets of God
> have been the servants of reality; Their teachings constitute
> the science of reality. Reality is one; it does not admit plurality.
> We conclude, therefore, that the foundation of the religions of
> God is one foundation.(PUP 295, 29 August 1912)

All the wars and enmities that have ravaged the world throughout
the centuries among the followers of the various religions are also
the consequence of the ignorance and waywardness of human beings,
who have turned a deaf ear to the teachings of God. `Abdu’l-Bahá
explained on that occasion:

> All the Prophets have promulgated the law of love. Man
> has opposed the will of God and acted in opposition to the
> plan of God. Therefore, from the beginning of history to the
> present time the world of humanity has had no lasting rest;
> warfare and strife have continuously prevailed, and hearts
> have manifested hatred toward each other.(PUP 297–8, 1

September 1912)

> As to racial prejudice, “the worst of all” prejudices(ABL 55), it is a
> denial of the principle of the oneness of humankind, “created… from
> the dust of earth… fashioned… from the same elements… descended
> from the same race”(PUP 297). This principle is an undeniable truth:
“There can be no multiplicity of races, since all are the descendants

> of Adam. This signifies that racial assumption and distinction are
> nothing but superstition”(PUP 298).

As to “patriotic prejudices”(PUP 12),8 that He also described as
“political prejudice”(PT 154, sec. 45, para. 15), He said:

> This is one globe, one land, one country. God did not divide it
> into national boundaries. He created all the continents with-
> out national divisions. Why should we make such division
> ourselves? These are but imaginary lines and boundaries.
> Europe is a continent; it is not naturally divided; man has
> drawn the lines and established the limits of kingdoms and
> empires. Man declares a river to be a boundary line between
> two countries, calling this side French and the other side
> German, whereas the river was created for both and is a
> natural artery for all.(PUP 299–300)

The only division among human beings that `Abdu’l-Bahá recognizes
as “real” is that “there are heavenly men and earthly men”(PT 154,
sec. 45, para. 15). Then He adds: “If these are God’s divisions, why
should we invent others?”(ibid.).

`Abdu’l-Bahá’ said : “It is evident that prejudices… have hindered the

> progress of humanity thousands of years”(PUP 39, 21 April 1912).9
> And in another occasion He added: “until national and international
> prejudices are effaced in the reality of this spiritual brotherhood, true
> progress, prosperity and lasting happiness will not be attained by
> man”(PUP 142–3, 24 May 1912). It is time to forsake all prejudices,
“our own small trivial notions”(PT 139, sec. 41, para. 7). He suggested

> several remedies against prejudice. The first remedy is search after
> truth. He said in this regard:

> Man must cut himself free from all prejudice and from
> the result of his own imagination, so that he may be able
> to search for truth unhindered… Being one, truth cannot
> be divided, and the differences that appear to exist among
> the nations only result from their attachment to prejudice.

The Duty of Kindness and Sympathy Towards Strangers

> If only men would search out truth, they would find them-
> selves united.(PT 131, sec. 40, paras. 8, 9)

Other remedies are “training and instruction”(PUP 300, 1 September
1912) and sowing “the seed of love and universal brotherhood in the
heart of man”(PT 10, sec. 5, para. 2). However, the greatest remedy
is the assistance “of a superior power to overcome human prejudices,
a power which nothing in the world of mankind can withstand and
which will overshadow the effect of all other forces at work in human
conditions. That irresistible power is the love of God”(PUP 68, 30
April 1912).10

> These were ground-breaking concepts in those days when the West-
> ern world was still “heaving with the explosive forces of a blind and

> Tommaso Carletti, the Italian governor of Benadir(the old name
> of Italian Somaliland), wrote to the Italian Ministry of Exterior:
“There are races(I am sorry for not agreeing with the old Aristotle)

> that, either for an inborn intellectual inferiority, or for their historical
> development, seem destined to be slaves or at least to be unable of
> enjoying an unconditioned freedom”(19 July 1907, qtd. in Del Boca,
> Italiani 805). As to religious prejudice, Christianity was still steeped
> in the atmosphere of an age-long, intransigent exclusivism. The Cat-
> echism of Saint Pius X, issued in 1905, said: “Can one be saved outside
> the Catholic, Apostolic and Roman Church?… No, no one can be
> saved outside the Catholic, Apostolic Roman Church, just as no one
> could be saved from the flood outside the Ark of Noah, which was
> a figure of the Church”(ninth article, 27 Q). As to nationalism, on
> the 8th of October 1911, a few weeks before `Abdu’l-Bahá lamented
“the sad picture of Italy carrying war into Tripoli”(PUP 6, 12 April

> 1912) and the fact that people remained “cold and indifferent to the
> fact that thousands of Italians, Turks, and Arabs… [were] killed in
> Tripoli!”(PT 116, sec. 37, para. 1, 24 November 1911),11 the Italian
> poet Gabriele D’Annunzio(1863–1938), considered “the leading

writer of Italy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries”(Encyclopædia
Britannica), published in the most important Italian newspaper “Cor-
riere della sera” a poem entitled “La canzone d’oltre mare [Song from
overseas].” In this poem he sang the praises of that war that, in his
opinion, was opening a “wonderful season” and a “holy springtime,”
in which a song was raised for a renewed and glorious Italy “from the
round muzzle of the gun.” On the 30th of June 1952 Shoghi Effendi
still described the inhabitants of towns and cities of the Western
world as “either immersed in crass materialism,” or breathing “the
fetid air of an aggressive racialism,” or finding themselves “bound by
the chains and fetters of a haughty intellectualism,” or having “fallen a
prey to the forces of a blind and militant nationalism or… steeped in
the atmosphere of a narrow and intolerant ecclesiasticism”(MBW 36).

The second half of the twentieth century has seen the gradual decline
of nationalism and racism in many parts of the world. As to religious
exclusivism, Christianity is slowly moving towards inclusivism and
interreligious dialogue. At the beginning of the new century, the
mounting tide of immigration is obliging a sometimes reluctant
European population to take people of different color, religion and
culture into account. Globalization has forced their governments to
issue special laws for previously unknown minorities. In the wake of
these events, the Italian government has recently issued a Charter on
the Values and Significance of Citizenship and Integration.

What is the Charter on the Values and Significance of
Citizenship and Integration?

> The website of the Ministry of the Interior presents this Charter12
> as a document “essentially of a programmatic nature setting out
> guidelines for the Ministry of the Interior” aiming at expounding
“the values and principles for all those wishing to have permanent

residence in Italy irrespective of whatever religious, ethnic and/or

The Duty of Kindness and Sympathy Towards Strangers

cultural group or community they may belong to”(Charter, “Intro-
duction”) and “also intended as a useful instrument for immigrants,
religious communities, and Italian citizens, especially the young, in
order to spread a better understanding of the problems concerning
immigration and religious freedom”(ibid.). Giuliano Amato, who as
the Minister of the Interior has set in motion, in the second half of
2006, the process from which the Charter was born in a frame-
work of initiatives aiming at integration and social cohesion, writes
that the document shows the foundations of the rights and duties
of immigrants in the Italian identity and in the Constitution of
the Italian Republic; establishes a relation between the history of
the Italian nation and the principles upon which its Republic has
today its foundations; assists new and old immigrants and Italian
citizens to find a practical relation between the Constitution of
the Republic and the Italian legislation in force, on the one hand,
and their daily life as to the issues of integration. Therefore, the
Charter illustrates the rights and duties of the immigrants, opens
a discussion and a dialogue “between old and new Italians on the
issue about which they are called sometimes simply to understand
one other, sometimes to accept each other, sometimes to change
their reciprocal attitudes” and, last but not least, points to the road
towards practical integration(Amato, “Prefazione” 2–3).

When and by whom was it written?

Approved by a decree issued on the 23rd of April 2007, the Charter
on the Values is the second document of this type issued in Europe
after the Contrat d’accueil et d’intégration, Welcome and Integration
Contract, passed in France on July 2003. It was written by a scientific
committee, formed by Carlo Cardia, professor of Philosophy of Law
of the Jurisprudence Faculty of the Roma Tre University, who was
its president, Roberta Aluffi Beck Peccoz, lecturer of Muslim Law at
the University of Turin, Khaled Fouad Allam, lecturer of Sociology

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Twelve

of the Muslim World and History and Institutions of the Islamic
Countries at the University of Urbino and a member of the Italian
Parliament, Adnane Mokrani, Muslim theologian and lecturer of
Islamic Studies at the Gregorian University of Rome and Francesco
Tannini, lecturer of Arabic Studies at the Pontifical Institute for
Arabic and Islamic Studies(PISAI) in Rome. The work of the scien-
tific committee has been also followed by Mr. Franco Testa and Ms.
Maria Patrizia Paba, prefect and prefect deputy respectively at the
Ministry of the Interior. The committee has also consulted several
religious, social, trade-unions, and civil society associations and orga-
nizations of the world of immigration. Specifically it has consulted the
Council of Italian Islam, an exclusively consultative body formed by 16
members, among which are some of the most significant voices of the
many-sided Italian Islamic world, and the Youth Council for Cultural
and Religious Pluralism Issues, a body created by the Ministry of the
Interior together with the Ministry for Juvenile Politics to promote
dialogue among youth of different faiths and cultures.

Which are its themes?

The Charter on the Values comprises seven sections. The first and
the last ones describe the identity of the Italian nation on the ground
of its ancient and more recent history and of its geographical posi-
tion and mention the seminal values of Italian society as expounded
in its Constitution and its present international commitment. The
other five sections deal with very important issues described in
their respective titles: “Dignity of the Individual, Rights and Duties,
Social Rights,” “Employment and Health, Social Rights,” “School,
Education and Information,” “Family, New Generations and Laicity”
and “Religious Freedom.”

The Duty of Kindness and Sympathy Towards Strangers

By which documents was it inspired?

The Charter on the Values is inspired in the first place by the Con-
stitution of the Italian Republic of 1947, which the Charter defines
as “the great divide from the totalitarianism and anti-Semitism trend
which poisoned twentieth century Europe with the persecution of
the Jews and their culture”(Charter, sec. 1). It also refers to other
contemporary international documents, mentioned by Cardia in his
commentary on the Charter(see Table 1). Finally, it also reflects other
Italian laws, like for example the Legislative Decree 25 July 1998, no.
286, Consolidated text of the law on immigration and provisions
governing the status of foreigners(Charter, art. 1 n5).

The Charter on the Values, “firmly anchored in the Constitution
and European and international charters”(Cardia, “Introduzione” 6)
as it is, reflects the best human rights culture of the contemporary
world. It also is founded upon the four pillars upon which, according
to René Cassin(1887–1976), the French jurist who was one of the
leading drafters of the Universal Declaration of 1948, the “temple”
of human rights is founded:(1) personal rights and liberties,(2) indi-
vidual rights in one’s relations with his social groups and the affairs of
the outer world(3), spiritual faculties, public liberties and fundamen-
tal political rights and(4) economic, social and cultural rights(Agi,
René Cassin 232). Its 31 articles also reflect the “three main ideas that,”
according to the Norwegian Johan Galtung, the father of peace stud-
ies, “are a gift by the West to humankind”: “the sacredness of the
body,” “the sacredness of the human spirit” and “the equality in front
of the law”(“Lo stato nazionale” 300). It complies with all the most
important principles mentioned in the International Bill of Human
Rights(see Table 2). Finally, the Charter runs again through the road
of the three generations of human rights, civil and political rights,
economic and social rights and cultural rights, in which Karel Vasak,
the French[Czech] jurist, former director of the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO)’s

Division of Human Rights and Peace, saw in 1979 an achievement of
the three great watchwords of the French Revolution: Liberté, Égalité,
Fraternité [Liberty, Equality, Fraternity](see Table 3).

A Bahá’í point of view on the Charter on the Values and
Significance of Citizenship and Integration

> The Bahá’ís are particularly sensitive to this document whose text is
> reminiscent of many of the teachings that Bahá’u’lláh has set forth
> throughout the years of His Mission(1853–1892). The Bahá’í Faith,
> born in the second half of the nineteenth century when the modern
> idea of human rights had already begun to flourish at the national
> level in some parts of the world, not only offers principles of inter-
> personal morality central to human rights, as the other religions(see
> Henkin, Age of Rights 183–4), but has a straightforward relation
> with human rights. Its copious Writings13 explicitly and repeatedly
> mention them, explain and uphold virtually all the principles upon
> which the modern human rights system is built, and expound other
> principles wherefrom that system could get good ideas for future
> agendas. The Bahá’í Writings illustrate human rights in at least four
> different perspectives: as “an element of the soul’s search for God,” as
“a divine obligation imposed on the rulers of society,” as “foundational

> elements of the ordering of the ‘divine’ society,” and as “aspirations
> for the future,” for “the healing of society’s ills and the redemption of
> humanity”(Curtotti, ‘Human Rights’ 67–8). These are some of the
> reasons why a document that takes constantly into account the great
> European and international Charters on Human Rights as the Ital-
> ian Charter on the Values cannot but meet the full approval of the
> Bahá’ís. A few considerations on this modern document will now be
> offered in the light of the Bahá’í teachings.

The Charter on Values and its laicity
The first section of the Charter on values, “Italy, a community of
peoples and values,” immediately clarifies that Italy is a lay coun-
try. The issue is then resumed in Section 6, “Laicity and religious
freedom,” in which the Charter on Values states that “the lay
state recognizes the positive contribution that religions bring to

the community and intends to emphasize the moral and spiritual
patrimony of each one of them”(art. 21). Cardia comments upon
Section 6, art. 21, as follows:

> The principles stated in this article describe the positive and
> friendly character of the Italian laicity, which thus distin-
> guishes itself from the laicity prevailing in the nineteenth cen-
> tury that considered religion as a “private affair” and refused
> to acknowledge its public and social role. The friendly and
> positive aspect of the Italian laicity has several applications.
> The Constitutional Court, for example, stated that the lay
> character of the State is one of the supreme principles of the
> constitutional order, but has also added that our order rec-
> ognizes the role that religion plays in the society and in the
> community. In harmony with this approach, the Charter on
> the Values states that Italy founds its laicity on two essential
> points: the recognition of the moral and spiritual patrimony
> of each religion, as a positive factor in community life, and
> the promotion of interreligious and intercultural dialogue to
> support the respect for human dignity and the exhaustion
> of any form of prejudice and intolerance. Therefore, religion
> is an active component of society and can converse with the
> state in several ways.(Cardia, “Note” 22–3, art 21 n32)

This position places the Italian legislative order, in its laicity, that is
in its total autonomy from the various religious confessions existing
in Italy, in the van on the international theatre because of its high
consideration of religion and makes its laicity a guarantor of equal
rights and opportunities for all its citizens and a form of respect for all
religious conceptions, since it does not favor anyone above the others.

The Bahá’í teachings totally agree with the two above mentioned
points: “the recognition of the moral and spiritual patrimony of each

> religion, as a positive factor in community life, and the promotion
> of interreligious and intercultural dialogue to support the respect
> for human dignity and the exhaustion of any form of prejudice and
> intolerance”. The Bahá’í International Community(bic),14 is working
> with the United Nations so that they may recognize the role religions
> deserve, at least in the promotion of the human rights culture(see
> bic 97–0401), on the ground of a number of important observations.
> All religions teach “people who they are and why they are here and
> call them to transcendence and service”(bic 97–0401). They “teach
> love, and… are intended to promote the well-being of the human
> family”(bic 93–0612) and this teaching “could be viewed as a goal
> common to them all”(bic 95–0110). They educate “individuals to
> confront their own character defects”(bic 97–0401), to “root out
> undesirable behavior”(bic 97–0401), “to discipline their baser
> propensities”(bic 99–0112), “to cultivate such virtues as truthful-
> ness, compassion, trustworthiness, and generosity”(bic 97–0401),
“courage, and willingness to sacrifice for the common good”(bic

> 99–0112), guiding them to respect such “universal spiritual principles”
> as “tolerance… love, justice, humility… dedication to the well–being
> of others, and unity”(bic 97–0401). All these virtues and principles,
> inculcated by all religions are “conducive to nobility and to respect for
> the rights of others”(bic 97–0401) and imply “social order and cul-
> tural advancement”(bic 99–0112). Since these virtues and principles
> are the core of all religions, every religion has a vital role in promoting
“unity among all the peoples of the world” and in outlawing “war and

violence in human affairs”(bic 87–0303).

The numerous religious conflicts that obscure the world seem to dis-
qualify the world’s religions for this delicate task, however the Bahá’í
International Community invites us “to look to the remarkable
development of interfaith relations and the expansion of interfaith
initiatives,” and points out the many initiatives undertaken by the
various religious and spiritual traditions, with the intention of foster-
ing “friendliness, fellowship and understanding among their diverse

communities,” and of “working together on policies, programs and
initiatives with secular bodies ranging from private enterprises
and organizations of civil society, to governments and interna-
tional institutions”(bic 01–0430). In the theoretic field, this shared
commitment of religions has produced “numerous joint declarations
and agreements in which the religions have articulated a common
vision of humanity’s future based on such universal principles as love,
justice, compassion, moderation, humility, sharing, service, peace
and the oneness of the human family”(bic 01–0430). In practice, “the
recent trend towards interfaith dialogue around the globe offers a
positive example of how disparate communities can work together
to broaden vision and shape public discourse in a unifying way”(bic
01–1123). An undoubtedly “increasing interchange among spiritual
leaders and their followers, especially children, will no doubt lead to
new understandings of what is possible for human beings and how
peaceful patterns of collective life can be nurtured”(bic 01–1123).
These results, beside the previously mentioned virtues and principles
inculcated by religions, denote that religions can provide a “values-
centered education” that is indispensable in view of the promotion of
human rights(bic 96–0315).

Although the Charter on Values recognizes the Italian lay legacy from
“the cultures of Ancient Greece and Rome”(Charter 1), from which

Italy has drawn “its enunciation of the principle of liberty”(Cardia,
“Note” 10 n1), it does not forget “Italy grew and developed within

> a Christian framework which dominated its history and together
> with Judaism prepared the way for its opening towards modernity
> and the principles of freedom and justice”(ibid.). Rich in this twin
> legacy, the Charter on the Values states that Italy undertakes, in the
> noblest spirit of modernity, to realize “an international order based
> on human rights, equality and solidarity among peoples”(Charter 11)
> and offers “all that which makes up the patrimony of Italy, its artis-
> tic and natural beauty, its economic and cultural resources, and its
> democratic institutions… to serve the men, women and the young

not only of this but also of future generations,” safeguarding and pro-
moting “inalienable human rights so as to sustain the weak, and to
guarantee the development of every individual not only with regard
to work possibilities and aptitude but also with regard to the moral
and spiritual disposition of each one”(ibid.).

The Charter on the Values meets, also in this respect, the prereq-
uisites of the Bahá’í teachings that suggest their own concept of
the relation between the state and its citizens. On the one hand,
Bahá’u’lláh enjoins “obedience unto them that are in authority”(GWB
206, sec. cii) and denies “the right to act in any manner that would run
counter to the considered views of them who are in authority”(Lawh.-i-
Dhabíh. 241, para. 3), because , He explains, “The instruments which
are essential to the immediate protection, the security and assurance of
the human race have been entrusted to the hands, and lie in the grasp,
of the governors of human society”(GWB 206, sec. cii). On the other,
He writes to the rulers of the world: “your subjects are God’s trust
amongst you. Watch ye, therefore, over them as ye watch over your own
selves”(Súriy-i-Haykal 75, para. 143). They “that are in authority” are
expected to be as loyal as all their subjects. The good governance is
born from this reciprocal loyalty. The ideal rulers should be “protec-
tors of the people and dispensers of Divine justice… powerful champions
of the people’s rights,” they should “give no thought to amassing enormous
fortunes for themselves,” they should rather be eager to enrich “their
subjects” and “take no pride in gold and silver, but rather in their enlight-
enment and their determination to achieve the universal good”(SDC
20). Both rulers and ruled ones should aim at becoming “a source of
social good” and consider this as their most cherished honor and highest
distinction”(ibid. 2).

The seven sections of the Charter
The first section of the Charter also refers to concept of “service,”
when it states that “All that which makes up the patrimony of Italy,
its artistic and natural beauty, its economic and cultural resources,

and its democratic institutions are there to serve the men, women
and the young not only of this but also of future generations”(Charter
2). The concept of service occupies a central place in the Bahá’í
conception of life. Bahá’u’lláh writes: “Man’s merit lieth in service
and virtue and not in the pageantry of wealth and riches”(Lawh.-i-
H. ikmat 138).

The contents of the second section, “Dignity of the Individual,
Rights and Duties,” confirms the Bahá’í persuasion that the princi-
ple of the oneness of humankind, according to which “all men are the
sheep of God, and God is their loving Shepherd, caring most tenderly
for all without favouring one or another”(SWAB 248, sec. 202), the
central principle of their Faith, is gradually becoming established
in the world, because of the intrinsic force deriving from its being a
fundamental part of human sociality. The principle of the oneness
of humankind implies at least four important corollaries, that may
be summarized as follows: first, all human beings have the same
spiritual origin, and thus are equal; secondly, the human person has
a priceless value; thirdly, the highest moral imperative is service to
humanity; and fourthly, all human beings are united to one another
by close bonds(see Curtotti 66–7). In the light of these implica-
tions, “each member of the human race is born into the world as a
trust of the whole” and this relationship between the individual and
the collective, on the one hand “constitutes the moral foundation
of most of the human rights,” on the other, defines “an overriding
purpose for the international order in establishing and preserving
the rights of the individual”(bic 95–1001, Turning 247; see bic
95–0303, Prosperity 281).

The contents of the third section, “Social Rights. Employment and
Health,” is reminiscent for the Bahá’ís of a talk delivered by Abdu’l-
Bahá in 1911 in Paris:

> Every human being has the right to live; they have a right to
> rest, and to a certain amount of well-being. As a rich man
> is able to live in his palace surrounded by luxury and the
> greatest comfort, so should a poor man be able to have the
> necessaries of life. Nobody should die of hunger; everybody
> should have sufficient clothing; one man should not live in
> excess while another has no possible means of existence.(PT
> 134, sec. 40, para. 23)

> The fourth section, “Social Rights. School, Education and Infor-
> mation,” is related to one of the main principles of the Bahá’í Faith,
“Universal education is a universal law”(PUP 300, 1 September 1912).

> The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the book of Bahá’í laws, explains this principle in
> details. For example:

> Unto every father hath been enjoined the instruction of his son
> and daughter in the art of reading and writing and in all that
> hath been laid down in the Holy Tablet. He that putteth away
> that which is commanded unto him, the Trustees are then to
> take from him that which is required for their instruction if he
> be wealthy and, if not, the matter devolveth upon the House of
> Justice. Verily have We made it a shelter for the poor and needy.
> He that bringeth up his son or the son of another, it is as though
> he hath brought up a son of Mine; upon him rest My glory, My
> loving-kindness, My mercy, that have compassed the world.(37,
> para. 48)

The fifth section, “Family, New Generations,” is a source of encour-
agement and assurance for the Bahá’ís. We certainly cannot say
that the health condition of the institution of the family is good in
the West. A document that “considers family education a necessary
tool for the upbringing of new generations”(Charter art. 16) inspires
great confidence. This confidence is strengthened by the emphasis
placed by the Charter on the Values “on the equality of duties and

obligations between husband and wife”(Charter art. 17) and on “the
freedom of minors in developing their own personality”(Charter art.
19). The Bahá’í family is founded on bonds of love and loyalty among
all its components. `Abdu’l-Bahá said about the family on the 2nd of
June 1912 while He was in the United States:15

> According to the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh the family, being a
> human unit, must be educated according to the rules of sanc-
> tity. All the virtues must be taught the family. The integrity
> of the family bond must be constantly considered, and the
> rights of the individual members must not be transgressed.
> The rights of the son, the father, the mother—none of them
> must be transgressed, none of them must be arbitrary. Just
> as the son has certain obligations to his father, the father,
> likewise, has certain obligations to his son. The mother, the
> sister and other members of the household have their cer-
> tain prerogatives. All these rights and prerogatives must be
> conserved, yet the unity of the family must be sustained. The
> injury of one shall be considered the injury of all; the com-
> fort of each, the comfort of all; the honor of one, the honor
> of all.(PUP 168, 2 June 1912)16

The sixth section, “Laicity and Religious Freedom,” has been previ-
ously analyzed.

The seventh section, “Italy’s International Commitment,” confirms
Italy’s commitment to carry out “a policy of peace and respect
towards all people in the world to promote the peaceful coexistence
between nations and defeat war and terrorism” and to safeguard “the
environment and wealth of life on the planet”(Charter art. 27), to
reject “war as a means for resolving international disputes, weapons
of mass destruction, as well as any form of torture and punishment
that degrades human dignity”(Charter art. 28), to reject “any form
of xenophobia”(ibid.), with a view to finding “a peaceful resolution

to the main international crises”(Charter art. 30), to promoting
“respect for human rights and the dignity of man throughout the

> world” and to encouraging “the success of political democracy as the
> form of State government that allows citizens to take part in matters
> of public interest and the ever-increasing respect for the rights of the
> person”(Charter art. 31).

> In this commitment Italy is catching the best of Western civilization
> and modernity. Among the merits ascribed by the Bahá’í writings
> to Western civilization the most important is that it gave birth to “a
> philosophical culture,” which has liberated “the energies of its popu-
> lations,” produced “a revolutionary impact throughout the entire
> world,” nurtured “constitutional government,” and prized “the rule
> of law and respect for the rights of all of society’s members”(Century
> of Light 5, cf. 72–3). The Bahá’ís therefore ascribe to the West the
> merit of having established for the first time in human history
“the minimum standards for conduct by a government towards its

> people”(bic 95–1001, Turning 255) and promoted an international
> debate that is gradually producing a “new culture conducive to the
> universal enjoyment of human rights”(bic 96–0315). The positive
> aspects of the Western civilization are thus summarized by the
> Universal House of Justice, the supreme governing body of the Bahá’í
> Community, in a message “To the Believers in the Craddle of the
> Faith [Iran]” of the 26th of November 2003: “ constitutional and
> democratic government, the rule of law, universal education, the pro-
> tection of human rights, economic development, religious tolerance,
> the promotion of useful sciences and technologies and programmes
> of public welfare”(2). All these features are reflected in the last section
> of the Charter on the Values and the Bahá’ís wholeheartedly agree.

> The Charter on the Values speaks about peace and respect towards
> all people and the Bahá’ís remember `Abdu’l-Bahá’s encouragement:
“Consort with all the peoples, kindreds and religions of the world with the

utmost truthfulness, uprightness, faithfulness, kindliness, good-will and
friendliness”(WT 14).

> The Charter speaks of “safeguarding the environment and
> wealth of life on the planet”(art. 27) and the Bahá’ís think
> of the call by the Universal House of Justice in its message
“To the Bahá’ís of the World, Rid.ván 1989” to assist “in

> endeavors to conserve the environment in ways which blend
> with the rhythm of life of our community”(para. 12), in the
> name of the strong ties between human beings and the envi-
> ronment, described in a letter written on behalf of Shoghi
> Effendi(1897–1957), the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith, in
> 1933, as follows:We cannot segregate the human heart from
> the environment outside us and say that once one of these is
> reformed everything will be improved. Man is organic with
> the world. His inner life moulds the environment and is
> itself deeply affected by it. The one acts upon the other and
> every abiding change in the life of man is the result of these
> mutual reactions.(qtd. in Valuing 249, bic 98–0218)

And with a view to its improvement, as recommended by `Abdu’l-Bahá:

> The Lord of all mankind hath fashioned this human realm to be
> a Garden of Eden, an earthly paradise. If, as it must, it findeth
> the way to harmony and peace, to love and mutual trust, it will
> become a true abode of bliss, a place of manifold blessings and
> unending delights. Therein shall be revealed the excellence of
> humankind, therein shall the rays of the Sun of Truth shine
> forth on every hand.(SWAB 275, sec. 220)

The Charter speaks of rejecting war and weapons of mass destruc-
tion. And the Bahá’ís remember the hope voiced by Bahá’u’lláh “that
through the earnest endeavours of such as are the exponents of the power
of God… the weapons of war throughout the world may be converted into

instruments of reconstruction and that strife and conflict may be removed
from the midst of men”(Bishárát 23).

The Charter speaks of rjecting any form of torture and punishment
that degrades human dignity. And this rejection echoes the following
words written by `Abdu’l-Bahá:

> material civilization, through the power of punitive and
> retaliatory laws, restraineth the people from criminal acts;
> and notwithstanding this, while laws to retaliate against
> and punish a man are continually proliferating, as ye can see,
> no laws exist to reward him. In all the cities of Europe and
> America, vast buildings have been erected to serve as jails for
> the criminals.

> Divine civilization, however, so traineth every member of
> society that no one, with the exception of a negligible few, will
> undertake to commit a crime.(SWAB 132, sec. 105)

Italy is determined to defeat xenophobia. And the Bahá’ís agree,
according to the guidance received by `Abdu’l-Bahá Who wrote:

> do all in your power to be as one, to live in peace, each with the
> others: for ye are all the drops from but one ocean, the foliage
> of one tree, the pearls from a single shell, the flowers and sweet
> herbs from the same one garden… Call none a stranger; think
> none to be your foe.(SWAB 279, sec. 221)

A similar guidance is given in a Talk He delivered in Paris on the
16th and the 17th of October 1911:

> I ask you not to think only of yourselves. Be kind to the
> strangers, whether come they from Turkey, Japan, Persia,
> Russia, China or any other country in the world.

> Help to make them feel at home; find out where they are
> staying, ask if you may render them any service; try to make
> their lives a little happier.

> In this way, even if, sometimes, what you at first suspected
> should be true, still go out of your way to be kind to them—
> this kindness will help them to become better.(PT 1, sec. 1,
> paras. 1–4)

Italy “is committed to seeing a peaceful resolution to the main inter-
national crises”(art. 30). And the Bahá’ís think that Italy also, like
other countries, is beginning to fulfill the following auspice expressed
by `Abdu’l-Bahá in 1875:

> True civilization will unfurl its banner in the midmost heart
> of the world whenever a certain number of its distinguished
> and high-minded sovereigns—the shining exemplars of devo-
> tion and determination—shall, for the good and happiness of
> all mankind, arise, with firm resolve and clear vision, to estab-
> lish the Cause of Universal Peace. They must make the Cause
> of Peace the object of general consultation, and seek by every
> means in their power to establish a Union of the nations of the
> world.(SDC 64)

The Charter states that Italy works “to encourage the success of politi-
cal democracy as the form of State government that allows citizens to
take part in matters of public interest and the ever-increasing respect
for the rights of the person”(art. 31). And the Bahá’ís applaud, because
they themselves believe in democracy. Bahá’u’lláh emphasized the
importance of the participation of people to the management of the
government when, at the end of the years 1860, He exalted Victoria,
Queen of England, for having “entrusted the reins of counsel into the
hands of the representatives of the people”(Súriy-i-Haykal 90, para. 173)
and praised, in another Writing, “the system of government which the
British people have adopted in London appeareth… for it is adorned with

the light of both kingship and of the consultation of the people”(Lawh.-
i-Dunyá 93). `Abdu’l-Bahá exalted “unity in freedom”(SWAB 32,
sec. 15) for all the people of the world and on the 2nd of June 1912,
when He was asked: “Is it not a fact that universal peace cannot be
accomplished until there is political democracy in all the countries of
the world?”, He answered that “Under an autocratic government the
opinions of men are not free, and development is stifled, whereas in
democracy, because thought and speech are not restricted, the great-
est progress is witnessed”(PUP 167). He also said that “To cast aside
centralization which promotes despotism is the exigency of the time.
This will be productive of international peace”(PUP 167). Shoghi
Effendi wrote that the Bahá’í Administrative Order is inclined “to
democratic methods in the administration of its affairs”(World Order
153). Century of Light, commissioned by the Universal House of
Justice, recognizes that “the process leading [in 1963] to the election
of the Universal House of Justice… very likely constituted history’s
first global democratic election”(92, sec. 8, para. 15). The Bahá’í
International Community remarks that “in many parts of the world,
the first exercises in democratic activity have occurred within the
Bahá’í community”(bic 01–0528).

> As to democracy, the Bahá’ís suggest it to be perfected, through a
> change in a number of features that in their opinion weaken modern
> democracy. A first aspect is “the political theater of nominations, can-
> didature, electioneering, and solicitation,” which should be replaced,
> as people “become progressively educated,” by “electoral procedures
> that will gradually refine the selection of their decision-making
> bodies”(bic 95–0303, Prosperity 294). Other reprehensible aspects are
“the culture of protest… debate, propaganda, the adversarial method,

> the entire apparatus of partisanship that have long been such familiar
> features of collective action,” which “are all fundamentally harmful to
> its purpose: that is, arriving at a consensus about the truth of a given
> situation and the wisest choice of action among the options open at
> any given moment”(ibid. 283) and last but not least “the adversarial

> structure of civil government, the advocacy principle informing most
> of civil law”(ibid. 287). All these aspects of modern democracy show
> that in the West “conflict is accepted as the mainspring of human
> interaction”(bic 95–0303, Prosperity 277), and even mistakenly
“dignified… by institutionalizing such concepts as the ‘loyal oppo-

> sition’ which attach to one or another of the various categories of
> political opinion—conservative, liberal, progressive, reactionary,
> and so forth”(The Universal House of Justice, ‘Individual Rights
> and Freedoms’ 515).

A “unitary concept of citizenship”
While presenting all these noble concept to citizens and immigrants,
the Charter on the Values offers, in Cardia’s words,

> a unitary concept of citizenship and coexistence among the
> different national, ethnic and religious communities, that
> took root in the latest years in the Italian territory, and can
> be considered as a covenant between Italian citizens and
> immigrants in view of an integration determined to recon-
> cile respect of legitimate and positive differences of culture
> and behavior and respect of shared values.(“Introduzione” 4)

This concept of citizenship is a reality for the Bahá’ís throughout the
world, who are committed everywhere to create this new citizen of
the world, a citizen heedful of the following words of Bahá’u’lláh:

> All men have been created to carry forward an ever-advancing
> civilization. The Almighty beareth Me witness: To act like the
> beasts of the field is unworthy of man. Those virtues that befit
> his dignity are forbearance, mercy, compassion and loving-kind-
> ness towards all the peoples and kindreds of the earth.(GWB
> 214, sec. cix, para. 2)

The Bahá’ís and the cultural diversity of the world

Bahá’u’lláh describes cultural diversity as a great wealth. He wrote:
“Ye are all the leaves of one tree”(Bishárát 26), “Ye are the fruits of one tree,

> and the leaves of one branch”(Lawh.-i-Maqs.úd 163), “regard ye not one
> another as strangers”(Lawh.-i-Maqs.úd 163), “Deal ye one with another
> with the utmost love and harmony, with friendliness and fellowship… So
> powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth”(ESW
> 14). `Abdu’l-Bahá interpreted this metaphor offered by Bahá’u’lláh
> in three different perspectives. The first is that of the oneness of
> humankind. When Bahá’u’lláh says “Ye are all the fruits of one tree,
> the leaves of one branch” He likens “this world of being to a single tree,
> and all its peoples to the leaves thereof, and the blossoms and fruits. It is
> needful for the bough to blossom, and leaf and fruit to flourish, and upon
> the interconnection of all parts of the world-tree, dependeth the flourish-
> ing of leaf and blossom, and the sweetness of the fruit”(‘SWAB 1, sec. 1).

The second aspect is that of the beauty of diversity:

> Consider the flowers of a garden. Though differing in kind, color,
> form, and shape, yet, inasmuch as they are refreshed by the waters
> of one spring, revived by the breath of one wind, invigorated by
> the rays of one sun, this diversity increaseth their charm, and
> addeth unto their beauty… Diversity of hues, form and shape,
> enricheth and adorneth the garden, and heighteneth the effect
> thereof. In like manner, when divers shades of thought, tempera-
> ment and character, are brought together under the power and
> influence of one central agency, the beauty and glory of human
> perfection will be revealed and made manifest.(TDP 103)

The third aspect is that of harmony among the followers of the
different religions. In the past, because of the different conditions
of the world, certain systems of religious belief have “boasted of…
[their] superiority and excellence, abasing and scorning the validity
of all the others”(PUP 230, 14 July 192), and have expressed this

concept stating that humankind is divided into “two trees: one divine
and merciful, the other satanic”(ibid.).17 But Bahá’u’lláh says: “‘Ye
are all the leaves of one tree’. He does not say, ‘Ye are the leaves of
two trees, one divine, the other satanic’”(ibid.). Therefore, “all are
the children of God, fruit upon the one tree of His love… all are
growing upon the tree of His mercy, servants of His omnipotent
will and manifestations of His good pleasure”(ibid.). The division of
humankind into two trees has implied in the past that certain sys-
tems of belief heaped “execration and abuse upon each other”(ibid.
266, 17 August 1912).18 But Bahá’u’lláh, explaining that there is but
one “Adamic tree,” and that “there is no satanic tree whatever – Satan
being a product of human minds and of instinctive human tenden-
cies towards error’(ibid. 230), teaches that ‘we have no right to look
upon any of our fellow-mortals as evil’(PT 153, ch.45, para.10, 10
November 1911), and that

> it is not becoming in man to curse another… it is not meet
> that one human being should consider another human being
> as bad… There are no people of Satan; all belong to the Mer-
> ciful. There is no darkness; all is light. All are the servants of
> God, and man must love humanity from his heart. He must,
> verily, behold humanity as submerged in the divine mercy.

(PUP 266, 17 August 1912)

The Bahá’í International Community mentions “the right of every
person to expect that those cultural conditions essential to his or her
identity enjoy the protection of national and international law.” This
right is specifically explained as follows:

> Much like the role played by the gene pool in the biologi-
> cal life of humankind and its environment, the immense
> wealth of cultural diversity achieved over thousands of years
> is vital to the social and economic development of a human
> race experiencing its collective coming-of-age. It represents

> a heritage that must be permitted to bear its fruit in a global
> civilization. On the one hand, cultural expressions need to
> be protected from suffocation by the materialistic influences
> currently holding sway. On the other, cultures must be ena-
> bled to interact with one another in ever-changing patterns
> of civilization, free of manipulation for partisan political
> ends.(bic 95–0303, Prosperity 281–2)

In the light of these statements, it is evident that all cultures are entitled
to their own identity, but also have the responsibility of re-examining
those aspects of their beliefs and customs that are in conflict with the
above mentioned unifying vision, which is confirmed by the system of
human rights and by reason itself.

Integration and interreligious dialogue have a long way to go to fully
achieve the oneness of humankind. However, such documents as the
Charter on the Values and Citizenship denote that this goal will be
gradually attained.
