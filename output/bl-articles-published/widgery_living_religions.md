BAHĀISM

Though Bahāism arose from Islām it has developed along its own lines
toward a religious universalism, and has gained adherents in India, Europe, and
America, as well as in the country of its birth. It had its origins in Persia in the
nineteenth century movement of the Bāb, itself related with the Sheikhism
founded by Sheikh Ahmed, described by M. Nicolas as the exponent of a
“powerful and enlightened liberalism.” Bābism is to be explained partly by
reference to the doctrine of the twelve Imāms, a doctrine of the Shiah sect,
according to which the twelfth Imām remains alive to reveal himself as occasion
demands to restore the faith of Islām to its original purity.

In 1844 Mirza Ali Muhammed declared himself to
be the Bāb or door, meaning that through him the hidden Imām communicated
with men. He aroused much fervor among his adherents, and the movement
included a very important principle making for liberalism in its denial of the
finality of the Qurān. The Book of the Seven Proofs of the Mission of the Bāb
maintains not only that the sentences uttered by Mirza Ali Muhammed are equal
in style and in spirit to those of the Qurān itself but further that they are an
advance so far as they are meant for this age. The followers of the Bāb were thus
to receive his utterances as later revelations than the Qurān. According to the

Bāb there is no final revelation: a new prophet comes when the age needs him.

Nevertheless, many of his own teachings were far from progressive, and the
importance of the movement lies chiefly in its giving birth to Bahāism. After
years of persecution he was executed in 1850.

Bahāism takes its name from Bahā Ullāh, who assumed the leadership of
the greater portion of the community after the death of the Bāb. For Bahāism the
Bāb was simply the “door,” Bahā Ullāh claiming to be “he whom God shall
manifest.” Bābism had been definitely Moslem: Bahāism would be universal.

That Bahā Ullāh was a very impressive personality the following, adapted
from an account given by Professor E. G. Browne, is sufficient evidence: In the
corner sat a wondrous and venerable figure whose face is unforgetable though
indescribable…. His piercing eyes seemed to read one’s very soul; power and
authority sat on his ample brow; while the deep lines on the forehead and face
implied an age which the jet black hair and beard flowing down in
indistinguishable luxuriance almost to the waist seemed to belie. “Praise be to
God that thou hast attained” …he said in a mild dignified voice. “We desire but
the good of the world and the happiness of the nations; yet they deem us a stirrer
up of strife and sedition worthy of bondage and banish-
ment…. That all nations should become one in faith and all men as brothers, that
the bonds of affection and unity between the sons of men should be
strengthened; that diversity of religions should cease and differences of races be
annulled what harm is there in this? … Yet so it shall be; these fruitless strifes,
these ruinous wars shall pass away and the ‘Most Great Peace’ shall come…. Do
not you in Europe need this also? Is not this that which Christ foretold? Yet we
see your kings and rulers lavishing their treasures more freely on the means for
the destruction of the human race than on that which would conduce to the
happiness of mankind…. These strifes and this bloodshed and discord must
cease and all men be as one kindred and one family…. Let not a man glory in
this, that he loves his country; let him rather glory in this, that he loves his
kind.”1

The idealization of Bahā Ullāh may be seen in the name given to him, the
Blessed Perfection. The Bāb, Bahā Ullāh, and his successor Abdul Bahā (Abbas
Effendi) have all been described as “divine manifestations,” though the
significance of the term is not clear. It ought perhaps to be interpreted in the
light of the panentheistic conception of God which predominates in Bahāi
writings. But the description of these three has also become more elaborate.
They have been called a cosmic trinity,2 and associated with love, will, and
knowledge.

Bahāi leaders have disclaimed the purpose of founding a new sect,
maintaining their aim to be the uniting of all the great religions of the world into
a universal religion. “The object of the Bahāi revelation is the religious
unification of all people.” 3This side of Bahāism much impressed the late Oxford
theologian, T. K. Cheyne, who wrote that “The union of religions must

necessarily precede the union of races, which at present is so lamentably
incomplete.”4 “The Bahāi movement is not an organization. You cannot
organize the Bahāi
Movement…. The Bahāi movement is the spirit of this age.”5 “The gift of God
to this enlightened age is the knowledge of the one-ness of mankind and the
fundamental one-ness of religion.” “The principles taught by every true prophet
are the same: there is no difference between them.” But Bahāi teachers have
been far from showing this to be a fact. “All the religions are revealed for the
sake of good fellowship. The fundamentals, the foundations of all are
fellowship, unity, and love.” The sacred books of the religions are to be
interpreted allegorically: “All religions are written symbolically.” That it is
maintained is the only way in which truth can be written to withstand time and
its changes. Bahāism is eclectic, and claims to embody fundamental principles
held in common by every creed; it is a purifying force liberating the truth from
masses of superstition. “Bahāism has no priesthood for sacerdotalism engenders
the spirit of caste and a struggle for mastery between secular and spiritual
powers. It lays no stress on metaphysical dogmas or ritual which is their material
clothing….”6

According to Bahāism no religion represents the absolute truth, which is not
to be grasped by human minds. There is progressive revelation chiefly as the
result of a closer communion of a few souls with God. The Prophet Muhammed
is highly revered j but as he is supposed by orthodox Moslems to have surpassed
Jesus, so Bahā Ullāh is held by the Bahāis to have surpassed Muhammed. By
this belief especially, but also in other ways, Bahāism has tended to differentiate
itself from orthodox Islam. “The Bahāi teachings confirm and complete all
religious teachings which have gone before, and offer a practical philosophy
which meets the present-day spiritual need of humanity in establishing divine
harmony and peace.”7

Bahāism is regarded as suitable for this age in insisting on the harmony of
religion and science. Civilization and science are necessary for the highest
religion and
must be intimately associated with it. “There is no contradiction between
Religion and Science.” “Religion and Science are the two wings upon which
man’s intelligence can soar into the heights, with which the human soul can
progress. It is not possible to fly with one wing alone. Should a man try to fly
with the wing of Religion alone, he would quickly fall into the quagmire of
superstition, while on the other hand with the wing of Science alone he would
also make no progress, but fall into the despairing slough of materialism.”8 The
harmony of science and religion is thus viewed by an ardent Bahāi: “To behold

all things of the universe as animate with a divine animation, so that a single
atom becomes as wondrous as a sun; to feel in all things the essence of a
consciousness so that not even a stone remains insignificant; above all, to realize
by what eternities of evolution matter has been trained in order to serve as the
temple of man — whereby man becomes the perfect microcosm within the
perfect macrocosm — this glory that was the crown of ancient seers, returns
now universally to become the education of all.”9

It has been maintained that Bahāism teaches a conception of God as an
impersonal force immanent in the universe. But though at times it is suggested
that God is beyond the capacity of human thought to comprehend, the most
frequent references are to attributes only intelligible as applied to a spiritual
being. To the human mind God is incomprehensible, for the finite understanding
cannot be applied to this Infinite Mystery. “God is love and peace. God is truth.
God is omniscient. God is without beginning and without end. God is uncreated
and uncreating, yet the Source, the Causeless Cause. God is Pure Essence, and
cannot be said to be anywhere or in any place. God is Infinite: and as terms are
finite the nature of God cannot be expressed in terms but as man desires to
express God in some way, he calls

God ‘love’ and ‘truth’ because these are the highest things he knows…. But
while God does not create, the first principle of God, love, is the creative
principle. Love issues from God and is pure spirit.”10

In the main the terminology and the general thought of the Bahāis is
immanentist, stressing the inner spirit of a creative movement of a universal
evolution. In this manner it endeavors to unite certain aspects of Moslem
mysticism with what is taken to be the fundamental idea in the modern scientific
theory of evolution. Thus, though the transcendence of deity is not denied, is
even implied, the characteristic of divine personality tends to be blurred.

It is quite clear that for Bahāism God is not simply an intellectual principle
of interpretation, a philosophical hypothesis but a Being calling for definite
response from man. “It is astonishing; it is a most amazing thing; that God has
created all humanity for knowledge of Himself, for the love of Himself, for the
virtues of the human world, for the Life Eternal; — for perfect spirituality, for
heavenly illumination has he created man; — nevertheless, man is utterly
negligent of all this! He is seeking the knowledge of everything except the
knowledge of God.”11 Nevertheless, it is in relation with God that men are to
seek and will find their highest happiness. “There is nothing greater or more
blessed than the Love of God. It gives healing to the sick, balm to the wounded,
joy and consolation to the whole world, and through it alone can man attain life
everlasting. The essence of all religions is the Love of God, and it is the
foundation of all the sacred teachings.” Love as the central quality of existence
is of four kinds, “(a) The love of God toward the identity of God: Christ has
said: God is Love, (b) The love of God for his children — or his servants, (c)
The love of man for God; and (d) the love of man for man. These four kinds of

\[11\] Ibid. Section 648.

love originate from God. These are rays from the sun of reality; these are the
breathings of the Holy Spirit; these are the signs of reality.”12

In his account of human nature, Abdul Bahā appears to place all evil in the
material part of man. “In man there are two natures: his spiritual or higher nature
and his material or lower nature. In one he approaches God, in the other he lives
for the world alone. Signs of both these natures are to be found in man. In his
material aspect, he expresses untruth, cruelty, and injustice; all these are the
outcome of his lower nature. The attributes of his divine nature are shown forth
in love, mercy, kindness, truth, and justice, one and all being expressions of his
higher nature. Every good habit, every noble quality belongs to man’s spiritual
nature, whereas all his imperfections and sinful actions are born of his material
nature. If a man’s divine nature dominates his human nature we have a saint.”

Apparently man’s spiritual life has no beginning, but the character of its
pre-existence is not discussed. Similarly, it has no ending, though again the
nature of its future is not defined otherwise than as a process to perfection.
“Divine perfection is infinite, therefore the progress of the Soul is also infinite.
From the very birth of a human being the Soul progresses, the intellect grows,
and knowledge increases. When the body dies the Soul lives on. All the differing
degrees of creative physical beings are limited, but the Soul is limitless.”13
“Though death destroy his body, it has no power over his Spirit — this is
eternal, everlasting, both birthless and deathless.”14 “Life is eternal, but the
individual human consciousness is not inherently so. It can only gain
immortality by uniting with the pure Divine Essence.”15

Bahāism is no passive mysticism. Perfection is to be attained only by
constant effort, which when inspired by lofty motives is true worship. Further,
Bahāism recognizes the profound significance of much of the suffering

that man endures. “The trials of man are of two kinds, (a) The consequences of
his own actions’ (b) Other sufferings there are, which come upon the Faithful of
God. Consider the great sorrows endured by Christ, and by his apostles. Those
who suffer most, attain to the greatest perfection.” “Grief and sorrow do not
come to us by chance, they are sent to us by the Divine Mercy for our
perfecting…. Men who suffer not attain no perfection.”16

True to the Moslem background of its origin Bahāism insists on prayer.

“Know thou that prayer is indispensable and obligatory, and man under no
pretext whatsoever is excused from performing prayer unless he be mentally
unsound, or an insurmountable obstacle prevent him. The wisdom of prayer is
this: That it causeth a connection between the servant and the True One, because
in that state man with all heart and soul turneth his face toward the Almighty,
seeking His association and desiring His love and compassion.”17

The general neglect of religious meditation by the feverishly occupied
peoples of Europe and America is a marked defect of modern life. Bahāism
emphasizes its importance not only for attaining a state of peacefulness but also
to recognize the profundities of existence. “Meditation is the key for opening the
doors of mysteries. In that state man abstracts himself; in that state man
withdraws himself from all outside objects; in that subjective mood he is
immersed in the ocean of spiritual life and can unfold the secrets of things-in-
themselves.”18

There is to be complete tolerance toward all religions. Bahāis remain
members of the religions in which they were nurtured. They may interpret
dogmas and practices allegorically. Thus: “Real fasting is to abstain from carnal
desires and the promptings of ego. Fasting means to purify the heart from every
stain of egotism, replacing material tendencies with spiritual susceptibili-

ties, refining the moral fibre, intensifying the fire of the Love of God, cleansing
the self from the dross of haughtiness, teaching humility, and dispelling the
darkness of ignorance.”19 The ideas of hell and heaven are to be explained
ethically, “Hell is the state of mind in which there are evil thoughts and
purposes, yielding to the desires of the senses, and clinging to material things. In
that state man is separated from God and in his ignorance he suffers. Salvation
— heaven — is the conscious realization of God in this life, which is gained by
love, kindness, and good deeds.”20

The ethical teaching of Bahāism is a definite humanitarian
cosmopolitanism. It sets in the forefront of its thought the “oneness” of
mankind, and the aim of universal peace, “the Great Peace,” to attain which it
advocates a world council and a world language. It champions the causes of
liberty and justice in all their forms, making definite mention of the equality of
the sexes. The claim is made,21 though apparently with little justification, that
the teachings of Bahā Ullāh solve “the economic problems.” It is unfortunate
that though universal peace and brotherly love occupy so prominent a place in
their teachings, the Bahāi movement has suffered from considerable inner
conflict between different groups, most often on questions of organization and
the seat of power and authority.22
