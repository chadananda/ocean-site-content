The Four Levels of Detachment in
Doris Lessing’s Shikasta
PHYLLIS STERNBERG PERRAKIS

Abstract
This paper begins by discussing the concept of detachment in Bahá’u’lláh’s
Writings, particularly in the Tablet, Words of Wisdom. It then applies this con-
cept to Doris Lessing’s Sufi-inspired novel, Shikasta, which uses the genre of
space fiction to defamiliarize the reader’s response to the coming of a new
prophet to a troubled late twentieth-century planet—a dystopian version of
Earth. Using four characters in the novel, whom I correlate to the four levels of
detachment found in Words of Wisdom, the paper traces the struggles of the
characters to gain various levels of detachment. In the process, the paper
explores the barriers that stand in their way and analyzes the reciprocal relation
between detachment and attachment and service to the new prophet.

Résumé
L’article examine tout d’abord le concept de détachement dans les écrits de
Bahá’u’lláh, en particulier la tablette Paroles de sagesse, et applique ce concept au
roman de Doris Lessing, Shikasta, d’inspiration soufie. La fiction de l’espace est le
genre littéraire employé par Lessing dans cet ouvrage pour défamiliariser le
lecteur dans sa réaction envers la venue d’un nouveau prophète sur une planète
en proie à une instabilité de fin du XXe siècle — une version dystopienne de la
Terre. Puis, à partir de quatre personnages tirés du roman, mis ici en corrélation
avec les quatre degrés de détachement présentés dans les Paroles de sagesse, l’ar-
ticle relate le combat mené par les personnages pour parvenir à divers degrés de
détachement. L’article explore ce faisant les obstacles qui entravent leur chemi-
nement et analyse le rapport de réciprocité entre le détachement et l’attachement,
d’une part, et le service à la cause du nouveau prophète, d’autre part.

Resumen
Este escrito comienza discutiendo el concepto de desprendimiento en los Escritos
de Bahá’u’lláh, particularmente en la Tabla titulada Palabras de Sabiduría.
Procede entonces a aplicar este concepto a la novela Shikasta de Doris Lessing,
inspirada por el Sufismo, que usa el género de ficción espacial para desfamiliarizar
la reacción del lector al advenimiento de un profeta nuevo en la postrera parte del
siglo veinte a un planeta embrollado, es decir, una visión distópica de la Tierra.
Usando cuatro protagonistas en la novela, quienes se relacionan a los cuatro nive-
les de desprendimiento que se hallan en las Palabras de Sabiduría, el escrito traza
los esfuerzos de los protagonistas de lograr varios niveles de desprendimiento. En
el proceso, el escrito explora las barreras que se interponen en su camino, y analiza
la relación recíproca entre despego y apego y servicio al nuevo profeta.

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this essay is twofold. First, I want to explore the meaning
and significance of the principle of detachment as discussed in the Bahá’í
Writings. In particular I want to examine the significance of Bahá’u’lláh’s
definition of detachment in His Tablet, Words of Wisdom, and relate the
four stages of detachment given in the Tablet, to other Writings dis-
cussing stages or levels of nearness to the Divine. Further, I want to
examine some of the barriers that act like veils preventing detachment. In
doing this, I will explore the link between detachment and the purified
heart. Second, I want to apply the understanding of detachment gained
from the above examination to Doris Lessing’s great, Sufi-inspired space-
fiction novel, Re: Colonised Planet 5: Shikasta, which is the symbolic ren-
dering of the coming of a new prophet to an earthlike planet.1 Specifically,
I want to correlate the four stages of detachment in Words of Wisdom to
the responses of four characters to the new prophet. The four stages in
the Tablet will help clarify in what ways the four characters demonstrate
increasingly powerful levels of detachment from their egos and material
reality, and how their detachment allows them to progress to increasingly
greater levels of recognition, attachment, and service to the new prophet.
First let me address the fundamental question, why apply Bahá’u’lláh’s

Detachment in Shikasta                           75

spiritual vision to a set of fictional characters in a novel by a non-Bahá’í
writer? From the beginning, Bahá’u’lláh tells us, the power of His
Revelation has infused a new capacity in all created things (Gleanings
XLIII). Artists, in general, and creative writers, in particular, are often
those who are most sensitive to the new spiritual powers at work in the
universe, and Lessing is such an artist. As a young girl growing up in
racially divided Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), she instinctively felt
racism was wrong and turned first to books and ideas and later to left-
wing politics in her search for justice (Under My Skin [1994]). However,
when she first wrote about these experiences in her autobiographical
novel Martha Quest (1952), she also described her protagonist Martha as
having a powerful mystical experience. One evening while watching the
magical beauty of the play of light on the veld, Martha slowly felt her indi-
vidual identity begin to merge with that of the world around her until she
felt at one with the cosmos (Martha Quest 73–75). At the time, neither
Martha nor her author knew how to fit this vision into the rest of their
thinking. It was not until some years and many books later that Lessing,
now a Sufi, began to place such mystical experiences in a fictional universe
where they were indications of the character’s intuitive connection to
other spiritual realities. In Shikasta (1979), which is perhaps her most mon-
umental spiritual vision, she portrays these other spiritual realities as
embodied in other planets.

While Lessing is not specifically attempting to portray Bahá’í principles
in Shikasta, her vision captures both her own spiritual struggles and some-
thing of the universal nature of humankind’s attempts to overcome attach-
ment to one’s ego and attributes, and to respond to spiritual reality. In her
autobiography, Walking in the Shade: 1949–62, Lessing has described her
struggles in going from a committed left-wing activist to a Sufi believer,
and she is well aware of the tests and challenges involved in this process. But
she chooses to universalize her experience in Shikasta, using a mythic form
that places individual transformation in the context of humankind’s spiritu-
al evolution from the beginning of the species. While she uses a space-fic-
tion structure, placing her prophets and angelic messengers on a separate
star (Canopus), her inspiration for the novel came from her reading in

76            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

succession the Old and New Testaments and the Qur’án and being struck
by “how common many of the tales were to all the religions and cultures.”
She concludes in an interview that Shikasta is “a very regurgitated book
because it all comes out of the sacred books” (“A Conversation” 23). Given
Lessing’s spiritual awareness and her explicit use of earlier sacred books as
her source, I feel it is appropriate and useful to apply Bahá’í Writings on
detachment to the spiritual vision in Shikasta. By helping readers to under-
stand better the complex nature of the spiritual forces that Lessing is sym-
bolically portraying, they enhance the reader’s understanding and appreci-
ation of the novel.

Furthermore, great works of art reflect back a culture’s unstated values
and attitudes; they capture the feel of the times.2 Shikasta’s detailed explo-
ration of its characters’ fears and efforts as they try to come to terms with
a world that seems to be falling into chaos is a symbolic expression of the
challenges of our own world. As her characters are forced to face unimag-
inable catastrophes, Lessing portrays their slow and painful awakening to
another level of reality and their gradual attraction to the figure in their
midst embodying that other, nonmaterial reality. We can understand our
own trials and the trials of those around us better by seeing how these
struggles are portrayed in Lessing’s imaginative vision. And this vision
takes on a new depth and poignancy when it is seen in light of
Bahá’u’lláh’s and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s words on detachment and attachment.
Their Writings provide a standard for this age for understanding con-
cepts like detachment, a standard that is true for various aspects of reali-
ty, including human imaginative and cultural production (Saiedi 157).
This divine standard applies to all aspects of human production, not just
psychologically but also descriptively, providing a benchmark by which to
measure spiritual, symbolic, and other kinds of truth. Thus fiction, which
provides a kind of symbolic truth about human experience, can at times be
illuminated by interpreting the world it portrays with the help of these
Writings. Hence using the Bahá’í Writings as a hermeneutic tool with
which to interpret Lessing’s novel helps us better appreciate the relevance
of Lessing’s vision for our time.
Moreover, in their mimetic function works of art are both more selective

Detachment in Shikasta                           77

and more symbolic than real life. For example, out of the complicated and
confused welter of feelings, thoughts, and actions that makes up an indi-
vidual’s life, the creative writer selects those particular events, emotions,
and thoughts that portray a pattern or clarify a tendency or hint at a hid-
den potential. The details represented can suggest the meaning or lack
thereof in a character’s life. Thus a novel, for instance, can enable us at
times to see more clearly than in real life the existence and effect of cer-
tain kinds of psychological and spiritual patterns. As a result we can rec-
ognize these patterns more easily in our own lives and the lives of those
around us. Both in terms of our own spiritual advancement and in terms
of sharing our understanding with others, a better understanding of the
obstructions that stand in the way of spiritual vision can be richly
rewarding.

In Shikasta we are granted such a vision. For example, we see the bar-
riers preventing a sensitive and intelligent adolescent girl from fully
grasping, or acting on her understanding of, her brother’s spiritual sta-
tion while her seemingly less perceptive older brother makes greater
progress in personal growth and ser vice. A mentally fragile woman who
never meets the prophet but hears his words in her mind and a rather
plain, highly determined young woman from a deprived background who
loves, marries, and devotes herself to him and his cause both offer exam-
ples of unlikely characters who are able to move closer to the new spiri-
tual reality.

EXPLORING DETACHMENT

I want to begin my exploration of detachment by looking at Bahá’u’lláh’s
statement that “He hath known God who hath known himself ” (Kitáb-i-
Iqán 182). But what does Bahá’u’lláh mean by knowing the self? And what
is meant by self? Modern psychologists often trace the development of the
physical, emotional, and intellectual capacities of the self, showing the dif-
ferent stages at which these different capacities are acquired and relating
them to the self’s interaction with others. The Bahá’í psychiatrist H. B.
Danesh broadens the discussion of self, explaining that although we are

78            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

aware of ourselves as two entities, the body and the mind, “we also expe-
rience ourselves as aself, undivided, whole, and complete.” When we speak
of the self, Danesh explains, “we are talking about our being as we expe-
rience it and as it is perceived by others.” It includes “the conscious and
unconscious parts of the psyche; the physical, mental, and emotional
dimensions of our personality; and both the egoistical and the universal
aspects of our behaviour. . . . It is towards this integrated and whole [con-
cept of our being] . . . that we are all attracted” (45).

To achieve this broader sense of self, we need to understand the forces
that bring out the more egoistical (concerned with the ego) or the more
universal aspects of our behavior. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá helps us by defining a
dimension of the self not usually mentioned in psychological literature:
the soul. He distinguishes between the intellectual capacities of the soul
and its deeper spiritual resources. The intellect, or the “rational soul” as
He names it, is the part of the mind that we are most familiar with. It is
the rational soul that allows us to make new discoveries, to find medical
cures, and to develop new software programs. In short, it is the rational
soul that allows us to discover the secrets of the material universe. When
this rational soul is “assisted by the spirit of faith,” it is able to turn its
power of discovery toward the spiritual realm and to become “acquainted
with the divine secrets and heavenly realities” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Some
Answered Questions 208).

To realize our full human potential we need to balance the rational and
spiritual powers of the soul. One power, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains, “connect[s
us] with the material world, and by it [we are] capable of material
advancement. The other power is spiritual, and through its development
[our] inner, potential nature is awakened. These powers are like two
wings. Both must be developed, for flight is impossible with one wing”
(Promulgation 60). Our civilization is fully aware of, and expends a great
deal of time and energy developing, the powers of the rational soul, but
how are we to understand and develop the spiritual capacities of the soul,
those powers that open us to spiritual realities and help us to become
responsive to the guidance of God?
One way is to recognize the role of the heart—the metaphorical seat of

Detachment in Shikasta                          79

the soul’s capacity to feel love and attraction toward its objects, according
to Adib Taherzadeh (2:216). Nader Saiedi further explains that “the ‘heart’
represents the throne of God and the place where all the divine attribut-
es are revealed. . . . The purification of the heart, therefore, is the indis-
pensable first step on the journey toward spiritual truth” (141). Thus in
the Kitáb-i-Íqán Bahá’u’lláh instructs the “true seeker” that before he can
begin the spiritual search he must “cleanse and purify his heart, which is
the seat of the revelation of the inner mysteries of God, from the obscur-
ing dust of all acquired knowledge, and the allusions of the embodiments
of satanic fancy” (Kitáb-i-Íqán 192). Like the intellect, the heart also can
be turned toward the spiritual world and the realm of God or it can con-
centrate all its love on the material world, acquired knowledge, and the
self. But Bahá’u’lláh warns us that if the heart is filled with love for the
world and the self, there will be no room for the love of God. In one of the
Hidden Words, He admonishes the individual to cast out the “stranger”
from his or her heart so “that the Friend may enter His home” (No. 26
Persian).

To assist in our efforts to direct our hearts toward spiritual objects, we
need to recognize that we possess within us the attributes of God.
Taherzadeh notes that “God’s light is reflected in” human reality, but the
individual “is veiled from these bounties” and must “make an effort to puri-
fy his [or her] heart” in order for these qualities and attributes to be man-
ifested” (2:31). Indeed, as I mentioned above, Saiedi explains that the heart
signifies “the place where all the divine attributes are revealed” (141).
Thus it is the intellect assisted by faith and enriched by the purified hear t
that puts us in touch with our spiritual potential. Through determined
efforts one’s heart can become so polished (that is, purified) that it is able
to reflect fully the spiritual attributes latent within the individual. Then
the intellect assisted by such a purified heart is able to penetrate what
‘Abdu’l-Bahá calls the veil “covering the eye of inner vision . . . that we
may behold the manifestations of the signs of God, discern His mysteri-
ous graces and realize that material blessings as compared with spiritual
bounties are as nothing” (Promulgation 90).

I want to examine some of the barriers that act like veils covering the
80            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

eye of inner vision. In particular, I want to examine how the heart is
blocked off from receptivity to sources of spiritual guidance and deep self-
understanding by becoming focused on the world and the ego. We are all
aware of how at some times we are more in touch with our spiritual attrib-
utes and more in tune with the teachings of the Manifestation of God than
at others. At these times we look at the world differently, able to see the
spiritual potential in those around us, for example, and able to imagine
sharing with them our own spiritual understanding. At other times the
people around us seem totally engrossed in the material world, and we feel
estranged from their spirits and from our own. Even when we have been
touched by what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá calls “the spirit of faith,” we can still fail to
be fully receptive to spiritual bounties and unable to achieve our full
human potential if we allow our worldly, confused, or self-centered desires
to usurp the heart’s attention so that the soul receives only a trickle of the
spiritual energy that is available to it. Taherzadeh, commenting on
Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet Lawh.-i-Nas.ír, puts it this way: while all believers have
been given potentially all the powers and attributes of physical creation,
“some are unaware of this bounty. They have deprived themselves of His
grace through unworthy deeds and are shut out as by a veil from behold-
ing its great glory” (2:255).

To gain some control over how our desires affect our ability to be in
touch with our deepest self is to acquire detachment. Detachment is not
an easy concept to understand. To begin with, there is some discrepancy
between how the word is used in a spiritual context and how it is used in
everyday life. Webster’s dictionary defines detachment as “indifference to
worldly concerns or partisan opinion: absence of emotional bias: neutral-
ity of feeling: unworldliness.” In psychology the term denotes lack of any
sense of connectedness. In the spiritual context in which I use it, detach-
ment is much more positive. It is a necessary step in acquiring attachment
to the Divine. It clears the dust from the surface of the heart so that it
can reflect divine attributes more fully. Taherzadeh puts it this way: “the
soul can acquire faith and progress towards God to the degree of its
detachment from this world” (2:34–35). Bahá’u’lláh begins the Kitáb-i-
Íqán by stating that “No man shall attain the shores of the ocean of true

Detachment in Shikasta                           81

understanding except he be detached from all that is in heaven and on
earth” (3). The process of gaining detachment involves more than being
neutral to our desires; it involves gaining knowledge and perspective
about them, so that we can discover toward what goals our emotions and
attention are directed. Then we can choose to direct our newly freed ener-
gy and interests toward the investigation of the claims of our deeper self
and of the Divine.

As we noted above, the heart cannot hold within it two contrary lovers.

We cannot serve a god of our own imagination and making—for example,
the god of success or power or excessive concern with being liked—and
at the same time be open to the Divine. Detachment is necessary if we are
to avoid inadvertently serving false gods and if we are to become capable
of responding fully to divine guidance. It is detachment that allows the
true seeker to “cleanse and purify his heart, which is the seat of the reve-
lation of the inner mysteries of God, from the obscuring dust of all
acquired knowledge . . . . from all shadowy and ephemeral attachments”
(Kitáb-i-Íqán 192). Thus it is detachment that allows us to turn our hearts
fully toward God.

One of the most devious types of obscuring, ephemeral attachment to
the world is to be attached to what Bahá’u’lláh calls “the kingdom of
Names,” the attributes of God found in the world, specifically the human
world.3 We mentioned already that realizing and reflecting our spiritual
attributes is one of the glories of the soul enlightened by faith. However,
as Taherzadeh explains, it is very easy to become too attached to these
Names, for example to pride oneself on one’s knowledge or helpfulness, or
to love to hear praise for these qualities and to feel deprived if one is not
praised and one’s learning or helpfulness is not recognized (2:40). As an
academic I am particularly aware of how easy it is to become attached to
the idea of oneself as knowledgeable or scholarly and to want others to
recognize this quality and to praise one for it—to have one’s papers
admired, for example. Thus one can become overly proud of one’s accom-
plishments.

Perhaps even more dangerous in a spiritual context is to become overly
attached to being recognized as pure hearted or a good person. Taherzadeh

82            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

notes that becoming thus attached is very easy to do because our society
puts so much emphasis on achievements and one is encouraged from child-
hood on to seek to exalt oneself above others, even in spiritual qualities
(2:40). However, we will see that such attachment to one’s own accom-
plishments or virtues can easily become a veil, blocking us from access to
a deeper level of self and to the Manifestation of God—skewing the direc-
tion of our heart’s desire. We need to seek excellence and to develop our
full potential, but not to become so attached and proud of these qualities
in our selves that we use them to exalt our egos. Taherzadeh points out
that these attributes are in some sense not one’s own accomplishments
but manifestations, in the individual, of divine attributes (2:40). We need
to acknowledge the power of God acting within us, without taking full
credit for it.

THE FOUR LEVELS      OF   DETACHMENT

In the Words of Wisdom (As.l-i-Kullu’l-Khayr), a Tablet written after the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh provides what John Hatcher calls a “catalogue
of axiomatic statements of spiritual insights and moral commands” (121).
Of the twenty-two definitions of spiritual qualities that are listed in this
Tablet, one concerns detachment, which is described by Bahá’u’lláh in four
stages or levels as follows: “The essence of detachment is for man to turn
his face towards the courts of the Lord, to enter His Presence, behold His
Countenance, and stand as witness before Him” (Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh
155). These four stages seem to suggest a hierarchical movement toward
ever greater nearness to God. Turning one’s face toward the Lord sug-
gests recognizing the Manifestation of God, which is the beginning of the
journey towards Him. Elsewhere Bahá’u’lláh tells us that the purpose of
our creation is to know God and to serve Him (Prayers and Meditations
314); therefore, the second stage of the definition of detachment, “to enter
His Presence,” may correspond to beginning to understand and serve the
Manifestation. The third stage of detachment, “beholding His
Countenance,” suggests the deeper level of closeness that recognition and

service brings, the love and personal transformation that develops as a
result of efforts made to overcome difficulties in the path of spiritual
growth and service.4 The fourth stage of detachment, “to stand as witness
before Him,” suggests the maturation achieved after living a life which
bears witness to the individual’s achievement of his or her potential. To
stand as witness before the Lord suggests a life which is fully open to
examination, one that, like a polished mirror, reflects and bears witness to
divine attributes.

These four stages of detachment roughly correspond to the Four
Valleys in the Tablet of that name, in which, according to Saiedi, a hierar-
chical but ultimately harmonious and united order is developed, compris-
ing the stages of “will, reason, and love as approaches to divine reality”
(80). In the First Valley, according to Saiedi, the “wayfarer,” using his or
her will, embarks on a journey toward the mansion of the loved one who
is the object and destination of the journey and who is still far away (80).
This wayfaring seems suggestive of the first stage in the definition of
detachment—turning one’s face toward the Lord. In the Second Valley,
the reason-based wayfarer is within the mansion, in the antechamber of
the beloved, who is now the focused center of admiration (81). The second
stage of the definition of detachment also suggests the greater nearness
of entering His presence. In the Third Valley, what Saiedi calls the “love-
based seeker” is allowed “to enter the very home of the beloved” and “face
the beloved one” (82). The third stage of detachment also consists of
“beholding His Countenance.” The Fourth Valley, which Saiedi character-
izes as “the approach of the heart,” implies a union of the other three types
of approaches—of will, reason, and love—as the seeker achieves “union
with the countenance of the beloved” (82). In this stage the seeker has
achieved the “secret of maturation,” which Saiedi describes as “the
fruition of all human potentialities” (82). Likewise, the fourth stage of
detachment, “to stand as witness before Him,” also suggests the achieve-
ment of maturation.

In correlating Bahá’u’lláh’s metaphorical definition of detachment to
the stages of closeness to the Beloved found in the Four Valleys, I am

84            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

emphasizing that the acquisition of detachment also occurs in stages
which lead the seeker to become progressively closer to the Manifestation,
in effect, to become more like Him and thus more able to reflect His light
and guidance. In one of the prayers for the Fast, Bahá’u’lláh again sug-
gests stages or steps in closeness to His Presence, this time revealing
some of the barriers that prevent believers from traversing these stages.
He notes that

> Some were ensnared by the infidels in Thy land, and were hindered
> by them from having near access to Thee and from attaining the
> court of Thy glory. Others were able to approach Thee, but were
> kept back from beholding Thy face. Still others were permitted, in
> their eagerness to look upon Thee, to enter the precincts of Thy
> court, but they allowed the veils of the imaginations of Thy creatures
> and the wrongs inflicted by the oppressors among Thy people to
> come in between them and Thee. (Bahá’u’lláh, Prayers and Meditations
> 145–46)

In these examples it is primarily the doings of the oppressors that inter-
fered with the ability of believers to attain closeness. However, in
Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys, where seven stages of closeness to God are
defined, it is primarily the believer’s own inner state and efforts that pre-
vent or facilitate advancement to the next stage of closeness. For exam-
ple, in the First Valley, that of Search, one of the barriers preventing the
seeker from advancing is “imitation, which is following the traces of their
forefathers and sires” (5). In the second stage, the Valley of Love, it is “the
veils of the satanic self ” that bar the way to advancement and must be
burned away (11). In the third stage, the Valley of Knowledge, the lover
must initially endure great pain and anguish because the end of his suf-
fering is veiled from him. Only after undergoing a great trial is he able to
see “the end in the beginning” (15).

Further, in the Hidden Words of Bahá’u’lláh, the Manifestation ex-
plains some of the spiritual attitudes that are associated with closeness to
His Presence. In this context the emphasis is on finding God within the

self, that is, experiencing His love and attributes within the self. For exam-
ple, He writes: “If thou lovest Me, turn away from thyself; and if thou
seekest My pleasure, regard not thine own; that thou mayest die in Me and
I may eternally live in thee” (No. 7 Arabic). Here the ultimate detachment
from the self (dying away from the self) is closely connected with attach-
ment to God, in particular with so purifying the heart that God’s attrib-
utes flourish within the self. In another Hidden Word Bahá’u’lláh declares,
“My love is in thee, know it, that thou mayest find Me near unto thee” (No.
10 Arabic). Again, so purifying the heart that one is receptive to God’s
love leads to the discovery of God near the self. Finally, as a summing up
of the relationship between detachment and attachment, Saiedi comments
on the attention that Bahá’u’lláh gives in the Kitáb-i-Íqán to “the dialectic
of detachment and attachment” as “preconditions of the spiritual journey.”
Saiedi enumerates the qualities involved in this dialectic. Detachment
from the self and the world includes “detachment from all presupposi-
tions, from imitation of others, from reliance on the authority of tradition,
from the apparent meanings of the Holy Scriptures, from rituals and sym-
bols, and from selfish desire and pride”; whereas attachment to God
“implies an encompassing love of all created things, humility, selflessness,
fairness and justice, and reliance on the standards given by God Himself ”
(140).

While I have tried to explore Bahá’u’lláh’s brief definition of detach-
ment in Words of Wisdom by correlating it with some other examples
from His Writings that suggest stages of closeness and relate detachment
to attachment to God, the definition remains highly metaphorical and
abstract. We have, of course, the examples of detachment in the lives of
not only the Central Figures Themselves, but in the lives of Their fol-
lowers, to help us understand the application of the definition. W hy then
turn to a work of art by a non-Bahá’í writer both to see what it tells us
about detachment and to examine what light Bahá’u’lláh’s definition
throws on a fictional work? As I mentioned, we can often see patterns of
reality more clearly in works of art than in ordinary life, and Lessing is a
particularly spiritually aware writer. Hence we can gain insight into the
meaning of detachment both in terms of our own behavior and in regard

86            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

to our assumptions about others through analyzing Lessing’s portrayal of
stages of detachment. Finally we gain greater understanding of the sig-
nificance of Lessing’s spiritual vision through the use of this definition as
a hermeneutic aid.

SHIKASTA: B ACKGROUND AND CONTEXT

Writing in the second half of the twentieth century, Doris Lessing is the
daughter of British parents, born in Persia, raised in Southern Rhodesia,
and currently living in London. She has written a series of space fiction
novels that metaphorically capture modes of spiritual understanding. In
particular they show the way that the emotions and intellect interact with
the spirit, portraying how they all must work together if the individual is
to acquire the detachment necessary to be open to spiritual knowledge—
to acquire a purified heart and intellect attuned to the teachings of God.

In Shikasta, which means “broken” in Persian, Lessing places the planet
Shikasta in a spiritual universe in which the star Canopus is the spiritual
sun in whose orbit Shikasta belongs. Canopus symbolizes a spiritually
more evolved realm that periodically sends envoys to Shikasta to bring it
guidance and aid its development. Canopus seeks to educate those under
its guidance in the laws of the Necessity, the laws of an unknowable, invis-
ible divine essence. Thus Canopus corresponds to the realm of the
prophets, and Canopean messengers seem very close to Bahá’u’lláh’s
explanation of the role of the Manifestations of God and lesser prophets.
Furthermore, the manner in which Canopean envoys reveal progressively
more sophisticated spiritual understandings to the evolving Shikastans
over the ages closely corresponds to Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings on the pro-
gressive nature of religious truth and the relationship among all the
world religions.

While the first half of the novel is told from the perspective of Canopus,
in the second half of the novel Lessing situates her narrative in the con-
fused world of Shikasta, very much a defamiliarized version of our world;
that is, Shikasta is similar enough to our world to be recognizable, but dif-
ferent enough to upset our traditional assumptions. We see Shikasta as it

starts to fall apart in the last days before a catastrophic third world war.
This is also the time when the Canopean messenger Johor is sent to bring
the necessary spiritual knowledge that will allow some Shikastans to sur-
vive the catastrophe and rebuild the world in harmony with Canopus.
Born into Shikasta’s midst as George Sherban, Johor now has the physi-
cal needs and limitations of any other Shikastan and no direct memory of
his Canopean past. However, as we follow his maturation, we see that he
has an innate spiritual knowledge that allows him to see and address the
spiritual needs of Shikasta at this desperate time in its history. Lessing
seems to deliberately defamiliarize her presentation of her prophet figure.
We do not see George speak of God or the spirit, for example, as Lessing
is very uncomfortable with the way religious language has been debased
and rendered meaningless. But we do see George as a child wake up at
night and spend hours gazing out the window communing with the stars
that represent other levels of spiritual reality. As an adult George begins
to demonstrate spiritual virtues and principles, in his own behavior. Above
all, he seems to be attuned to the unifying nature of the spiritual forces
represented by Canopus and to helping Shikastans realize these forces in
their own difficult lives. He does this in part by attracting their hearts and
encouraging them on the path to detachment.

I will examine four characters in Shikasta that embody four stages of
detachment which I think roughly correspond to Bahá’u’lláh’s four stages
of detachment in the passage from the Words of Wisdom. The first exam-
ple depicts the struggle by Rachel Sherban, George’s younger sister, to
recognize the special spiritual qualities of her brother George. Much of
the second half of Shikasta is narrated by Rachel through her diary and
concentrates on the forces within and without that aid or prevent Rachel
and a few others from beginning the process of scrubbing away the dust
of egotism from their hearts and becoming able to recognize and respond
to George’s guidance. Her story seems to illustrate Bahá’u’lláh’s first
stage when one turns one’s “face towards the courts of the Lord.” Her
efforts provide a parable for our own efforts to overcome the obstacles that
prevent our attuning ourselves more fully to the will and teachings of the
Manifestation of God.

Influenced by their exposure to Canopean values in the first half of the
novel, readers see Rachel, and indeed all Shikastans, both from the
Shikastan perspective and, simultaneously, from that of the Canopeans.
Holding in mind these two perspectives, readers empathize with Rachel’s
struggles while being detached enough to understand her spiritual failure
to overcome the egotism and self-pity of the lower self and to attune her-
self fully to George’s guidance. Lessing also briefly sketches how other,
seemingly less suitable, people around Rachel attain greater degrees of
closeness to the prophet and fulfill the capacities of their souls. The sto-
ries of George’s nonidentical twin brother Benjamin; a mentally fragile
women named Lynda Coldridge who contacts George through telepathy;
and George’s earthy, over-eager girlfriend and then wife Suzannah not
only help us to understand greater degrees of detachment but also high-
light the kinds of obstructions that often blind us to the spiritual reality
of others.

DETACHMENT AND CHARACTER IN SHIKASTA

The beginning of self-knowledge is often precipitated by some kind of
painful or disturbing incident. Very often what Bahá’u’lláh calls a test
shakes the individual out of his or her pattern of living with complacency
or superficiality—or purely at the material level of empirical reality—and
begins the process of acquiring self-knowledge and detachment.
Shikastans at the end of their twentieth century are undergoing such tests
and difficulties. Their planet is faced with a series of social, economic, and
political problems that seem to be an imaginative extension of the prob-
lems faced by our planet. In this time of worldwide crisis, fourteen-year-
old Rachel Sherban is trying to come to terms with herself, her family, and
the difficult world situation she is living in, through the process of writ-
ing a diary. In her initial pages she recounts that her family is living in
Morocco where her parents work for international organizations and that
she has nonidentical twin brothers, George and Benjamin, who are six-
teen. It is Rachel’s attempt to understand the unique qualities of her
brother George that leads her to begin her diary. We, of course, know

from the first half of the novel that George is the embodiment in
Shikastan reality of the Canopean messenger Johor.

Through Rachel’s diary observations we watch George’s development
from a child attuned to the stars and visited by thoughtful strangers to a
teenager active in a local youth group, who is able to attend a youth con-
ference as the representative of a Jewish, a Moslem, and a Christian group.
Soon the special power of George’s words attracts youth from all over the
world who come to listen to him. In fact, when George speaks, everyone
around, including the parents, sits and listens. We watch Rachel’s grow-
ing attraction to George and her gradual realization of his special power.
However, hand in hand with Rachel’s great perceptiveness, we see her con-
tinuing attachment to her own ego. For example, she is jealous of
George’s involvement with the youth group and his attention to her
brother Benjamin. She also becomes deeply jealous of the fact that George
now has a girlfriend, Suzannah, whom Rachel finds loud, flashy, and vulgar.

A few years later, when society in Shikasta has deteriorated to the point
where huge children’s camps are being set up for the thousands of
orphans of the recurring wars and famines, George encourages Rachel to
take over the running of the girls’ camp. Under George’s guidance
Benjamin has already assumed control of the boys’ camp and is success-
fully managing it. Although deeply attracted by George’s words, Rachel
says no. Appalled at the idea of raising children in camps of fifty thousand,
she is unable to imagine herself serving as an administrator in such a sit-
uation. She can’t “toughen up,” as George is always advising her. In refus-
ing, she allows her very perceptiveness and sensitivity to block her from
meaningful action.

As the sociopolitical situation in Shikasta begins to spin out of control,
old racial and ethnic resentments of the poorer, dark-skinned nations
against the white rich who once colonized them come to the fore. George
takes a trip with Benjamin around the world, setting in place the ties that
will allow him to orchestrate a symbolic trial of the white race in the
ancient theater in Athens, Greece. With the theater lit by candlelight
looked after by the children from the camps, George creates a cathartic
emotional experience in which one disadvantaged group after another

90            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

comes forward to state their grievances against the white race. However,
just when the situation might have become explosive, George arranges for
these attacks to give way to self-reflection on the part of representatives
from various third-world countries who admit their own inhumanity in
the treatment of their minorities. Thus George uses the trial to dissipate
much of the anger of the have-nots, and a pogrom against the white race
is avoided.

However, by this time Rachel is already dead, having disregarded
George’s instructions to stay home while he is away and to look after two
special orphans who now live with them. She listens instead to a traveler
who brings information that George is to be killed by the ruling elite.
Although Suzannah pleads with her not to seek out George, and although
George had given Rachel specific instructions to remain at home and had
entrusted her with the task of educating the two orphans, she disregards
both pleas and responsibilities. We learn only indirectly about her behav-
ior after she leaves home and manages to get as far as Paris in her efforts
to find George and warn him. Never managing to contact him, she instead
attempts to impersonate him, possibly in order to sacrifice herself for him.
Eventually Rachel is arrested and commits suicide (362–63).

RACHEL: TURNING ONE’S FACE TOWARD THE LORD

The circumstances surrounding fourteen-year-old Rachel’s decision to
keep a diary provide a case study of the early workings of detachment.
Rachel begins her diary at the instigation of Hasan, one of the series of
strange people who have come over the years to visit and instruct her
older brother George. Readers surmise that these people are other
Canopean envoys sent to aid George’s development. Listening one after-
noon to George talk with Hasan, Rachel is feeling miserably left out when
she suddenly realizes that George is hearing things in what Hasan says
that are quite beyond her. It is not that the words are too difficult but that
somehow she is not ready to take in their significance. As if in response to
her new awareness, Hasan turns to Rachel, asks her if she keeps a diary,

and suggests that she write an account of her childhood. Rachel feels
resentment that this relative outsider should tell her what to do, while at
the same time she wants his praise and attention. When she tries to
impress him with one of her school essays, he ignores this manifestation
of the lower self and continues talking to George. Rachel becomes furious
and fails to hear anything else that Hasan is saying.

Thinking back on this incident some time later when, following Hasan’s
suggestion, she is writing her diary-account of her childhood, Rachel real-
izes that she was being shown why she could not hear what Hasan was
saying. She was too full of distracting egotistic emotions, too attached to
her own cleverness, too anxious to be praised. For the first time in her life
she gains some awareness of how these emotions might be barriers block-
ing her from hearing something else. Thus she receives her first intima-
tion of the need for detachment, her first vague awareness that there
might be something more to her than the ego.

Her new awareness allows Rachel to become conscious of the power of
George’s words as he speaks to travelers from all over the world. Thus we
could say that Rachel achieves the first stage of Bahá’u’lláh’s definition of
detachment. Through her diary writing, she is able “to turn [her] face
towards the courts of the Lord,” fulfilling the first duty prescribed by
God, the recognition of His Messenger. But despite her recognition, she
fails to detach herself enough from her jealousy, fears, and attachment to
her own ego to follow George’s suggestions and instructions and there-
fore misses the opportunity to truly serve him. The first instance occurs
when she refuses the offer to take over the running of the girls’ camp. In
doing so she denies herself the opportunity to gain inner strength
through service to George and the children. Instead of fighting against
her tendency to fall into despair, she prides herself on her sensitivity and
withdraws to the sidelines.

Without the strength and confirmation that service brings, Rachel is
not strong enough to withstand the second test she encounters. Unable to
obey George’s final instructions to her to remain home when he goes on
his trip, she gives in instead to what she experiences as a whirlpool-like

92            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

force that sucks her in.5 Elsewhere in the novel this force is associated
with the pull of the lower self. Rachel’s death is both needless and unhelp-
ful. Her impersonation of George confuses his followers who now believe
he can appear in two places at once, and her desire to warn George that
his life is in danger was not necessary; as we later learn, he has survived
nine attempts to kill him (363).

The contrast between Rachel’s development and that of her brother
Benjamin provides insight into both the spiritual journey and the nature
of detachment. Suffering from the disadvantage of being George’s twin
and thus inevitably compared to his exceptional brother, Ben compensates
by adopting the persona of the snob and the cynic, partly to cover his inse-
curity. However, through involvement with George in the local youth
organizations, Ben witnesses George’s unifying powers and soon begins
following his guidance. In particular, he takes over the running of the
camp for orphaned boys and is soon managing, with good will and effi-
ciency but limited facilities and funds, the raising and schooling of fifty
thousand young boys.

BENJAMIN: CONSCIOUS SERVICE

As a result of his obedience to George and service to the boys, Ben
becomes more confident and resourceful, and hence less jealous and in
need of attention. The clearest sign of his spiritual development comes
when he withstands “reeducation” by the Chinese Overlords, the new
rulers of Shikasta. Playing on Ben’s old desire to be admired, they place
Ben in a situation where he is promised authority, offered perks, and lav-
ished with praise as part of a brainwashing technique to co-opt his author-
ity as the leader and spokesperson for the children’s camps and to place
him under the Overlord’s command. Assisted by George, who suddenly
turns up to visit Ben at the beginning of his reeducation training, Ben is
able to recognize the manipulation being applied to him and, along with
George’s other followers, is able to create an atmosphere of unity and spir-
itual attunement that the rulers cannot fathom or disrupt.
Benjamin thus can be seen as a representative of Bahá’u’lláh’s second

stage of detachment—not just turning his face toward the Lord, but
entering His presence. Benjamin also suggests the seeker in the second of
the Four Valleys, who uses his reason to serve the Manifestation.
Benjamin’s ability to strengthen his spiritual potential through active ser-
vice to the spiritual reality that George represents enables Benjamin to
overcome a great deal of his earlier snobbishness, jealousy, and insecurity
and powerfully strengthens his spiritual receptivity and attraction to the
spiritual attributes embodied in George. He is thus enabled to play a major
role in George’s spiritual plans, helping at the trial to save the white race
from being annihilated. Thus he is able to “turn his face towards the
courts of the Lord” and “to enter His presence” (Tablets 155).

LYNDA: T HE APPROACH OF THE HEART

Lynda Coleridge is a particularly interesting example of a highly devel-
oped spiritual detachment. A schizophrenic who has spent most of her life
in mental hospitals, she also possesses the ability to tune in to the
thoughts of other telepathics. As a young girl, her ability to hear voices
was diagnosed as pathogenic, and the harsh treatment she has received
over the years due to her voices has led to bouts of mental illness when
she is out of touch with her own spirit. But beneath her loss of self-esteem
and her outward degradation, she has maintained her trust in the authen-
ticity of her experiences. Such experiences have “inured [her] to hardship,
misunderstanding, uncertainty, and a capacity for suspending judgement”
(Shikasta 433). When she is finally befriended by the sympathetic Dr.
Hebert, she is able to use her capacities constructively, teaching the doc-
tor to acquire some of her ability, and her purified heart is able to hear the
voice of George. Her heart polished by long years of suffering, Lynda is
able calmly to play her role in George’s redemptive scheme despite her
awareness of the catastrophic war to come, sending other useful telepath-
ic people to safe places George has chosen. The serenity that she possess-
es is a genuine spiritual achievement, rooted in her selfless attunement to
the spiritual attributes within her own soul, which in turn allow her to
attune herself to George’s voice—this despite the fact that she is called

94            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

“scornful of religion” (435). Nevertheless, she is content to follow
George’s instructions and remain where she is in England to help train in
her telepathic capacities the few followers of George who will survive.
Knowing that she will not live long after what she calls the “wrath” (432),
she is prepared to quietly serve until her death.

Lynda seems to represent Bahá’u’lláh’s third level of detachment.

Besides being able “to turn [her] face towards the courts of the Lord” and
enter His presence, she is able to behold “His countenance,” through hear-
ing George’s voice. She also suggests the third valley of the Four
Valleys—using love to approach the presence of the Divine Messenger.
Her years of dealing with discouragement, abuse, and being seen as crazy,
as well as enduring times when she is out of touch with her sense of self
and her sanity, without giving up, give her a tremendous strength and
courage that she is able to bring to her service to George. The final testa-
ment to her loyalty and purity of heart is her willingness to obey George
and serve his followers to the end.

SUZANNAH: S TANDING AS WITNESS BEFORE THE LORD

George’s girlfriend Suzannah also seems a most unlikely candidate for
higher levels of spiritual development. A refugee who has never known
her full name, she fought her way out of homelessness, ignorance, and
poverty and now teaches physical culture, hygiene, and diet at the youth
camps. Although to Rachel she initially seems “a loud, vulgar, stupid,
flashy girl” (317–18), Suzannah slowly reveals the strength that comes
from overcoming extreme hardships and polishing the mirror of her
heart. She and Rachel make an interesting study in opposites. While
Suzannah lacks Rachel’s beauty, refinement, and education, she possesses
exactly those attributes that Rachel lacks: obedience, perseverance, and a
heart totally enkindled and directed toward George. Because of the puri-
ty of her heart, she knows instinctively who is or is not genuine, and she
immediately recognizes that Rachel should not act on the information
brought her that the Overlords are planning to kill George.

By the time she moves in with Rachel after the death of Rachel’s par-
ents, Suzannah has already reached the earlier stages of detachment, com-
pletely trusting and loving George and serving Shikastans as he directs
her. Suzannah’s purity of heart allows her to face the test of Rachel’s jeal-
ousy and unkindness and to continue to love her as George’s sister. She
never flinches when Rachel’s ministrations show her as a “plain, middle-
aged woman,” but returns to her make-up and rigid curls with a stubborn
air of self-respect. But her final development takes her one step further.
Surviving the catastrophe and marrying George, she is like a rock, saving
her energy to mother not only their own two children as well as several
adopted children but also all the refugee children who find their way to
her camp in the Andes. Steadfastly turning to George for guidance in her
letters, admitting she is lonely with him far away and accepting that he is
not lonely without her, Suzannah can be said to have acquired the fourth
stage of detachment. Suzannah’s complete love and service to George
symbolize an individual’s ability to channel all the energies of the heart
and intellect to the needs of the spiritual self, so that she “can stand as wit-
ness before” God. Suzannah’s life is witness to her love, service, and
detachment. She lives to see the dawning of a new world and the coming
of a new spiritual dispensation. The novel suggests that she will survive
George’s passing away and continue to help establish the new kingdom of
God on earth, made possible because Shikasta is once again in tune with
the spiritual energies of Canopus, the energies that were embodied in
George.

CONCLUSION

The breadth of Lessing’s spiritual panorama and the detailed anatomy of
various psychological and spiritual types and barriers that she provides in
Shikasta make her work a wonderful resource for studying detachment.
Above all, Lessing’s novel offers us a powerful example of the interrelation-
ship between recognition and service and between detachment and attach-
ment. Her novel portrays the heart’s subtle movement as an individual’s

96            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

spiritual sensibilities begin to be enkindled. The heart does not become
purified and fully attached once and for all. It is a not static accomplish-
ment. Rather, recognition must be followed by service, which inevitably
involves risks and dealing with tests. It is only through the commitment
that comes from service that the heart’s purity is strengthened, its suscep-
tibilities become more refined, and its attraction to the spiritual realm
grows. At each step along the way, the individual barriers erected by the
self and the world must be overcome. Thus we learn from Rachel that one
cannot wait until one is totally prepared or has found the perfect vehicle for
service. Rather, Benjamin shows that in the process of actively serving the
cause of God one becomes stronger and more capable of evolving emo-
tionally, intellectually, and spiritually. Lynda demonstrates the need to per-
severe and to detach oneself from all weaknesses, even at times from
aspects of our own self that are beyond our control, like physical or men-
tal disabilities. Finally, Suzannah shows us the power of love to integrate
and channel all an individual’s energies—physical, emotional, intellectual
and spiritual. Demonstrating that the integrating powers of the heart
which lead to wholeness and integrity of self are possible no matter what
one’s early beginnings or social disadvantages, she becomes the epitome of
spiritual detachment.

To return to the earlier discussion of how one develops one’s fullest
human potential, we can see the reciprocal relationship between the
understandings of the intellect and the heart and their fusion in the fire of
service. Each stage opens the door to deeper self-knowledge, more intense
spiritual susceptibilities, and greater attraction to the Divine, culminating
in greater service. And each stage brings new barriers to be overcome,
new tests to face. As our own attachment grows, we need to open our-
selves to the spiritual possibilities in others, striving to prevent our own
limitations from leading us to make misjudgments and become barriers in
the spiritual journeys of others. In this dialectic movement between
detachment and attachment, between service and inner growth, between
teaching and reflection, we will be able to draw closer to God because we
will be closer to our truest selves.

NOTES

I wish to thank the several anonymous reviewers of the different stages of this
paper. Their comments have helped me immensely in refining and developing my
ideas. An earlier version of this paper was presented at the Annual Conference of
the Association for Bahá’í Studies, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, 1 September
2000\.

1. While there has been some discussion of Lessing’s spiritual vision in
Shikasta, there has not been a close look at the spiritual dynamics governing char-
acters’ abilities to recognize and respond to a new prophet. See, for example,
“Doris Lessing’s Prophetic Voice in Shikasta,” by Jeannette Webber in Spiritual
Exploration in the Works of Doris Lessing, and brief discussions of Shikasta in essays
by Phyllis Sternberg Perrakis and Josna Rege in that same volume. Shadia Fahim
gives a detailed Sufi reading of Shikasta in Doris Lessing and Sufi Equilibrium and
Phyllis Sternberg Perrakis looks at its spiritual vision from a science fiction per-
spective in “The Marriage of Inner and Outer Space in Doris Lessing’s Shikasta.”

3. Taherzadeh explains that this is one of three barriers between the individ-
ual and God listed by Bahá’u’lláh in an untranslated Tablet. Taherzadeh notes
that “Bahá’u’lláh exhorts the believers to pass beyond [these barriers] so that they
may be enabled to attain His presence” (2:36).

4. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes about “nearness to God” that it “is possible through
devotion to Him, through entrance into the Kingdom and service to humanity; it
is attained by unity with mankind and through loving-kindness to all; it is depen-
dent upon investigation of truth, acquisition of praiseworthy virtues, service in
the cause of universal peace and personal sanctification. . . . Nearness is likeness”
(Promulgation 147–48).

5. In “The Marriage of Inner and Outer Space” I relate this whirlpool-like force
to the power of the evil planet Shammat (the home of purely selfish beings, ver-
sions of the scriptures’ devils and tempters) and discuss its earlier manifestations
in the novel.
