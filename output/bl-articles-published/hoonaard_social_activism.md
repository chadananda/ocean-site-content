Social Activism Among
Some Early Twentieth-Century Baha’is1

Will C. van den Hoonaard University of New Brunswick

Résumé
Le présent article discute de l’engagement socialiste de trois des premiers Baha’is du
Canada : Paul Kingston Dealy, Honoré Jaxon et Rose Henderson. En effet, vu le véritable
intérêt pour la justice économique et sociale existant depuis le tout départ dans la foi
baha’ie, un certain nombre des premiers Baha’is ont adhéré au socialisme. Le présent
article s’efforce d’expliquer cet engagement, alors que la foi baha’ie interdit tout
militantisme politique.

En fait, vu le petit nombre d’écrits baha’is fondamentaux avant le début des années 1920,
plusieurs Baha’is de la première heure ont adapté leur conception de la doctrine baha’ie à
leur point de vue personnel, et sont devenus des militants politiques — se démarquant
ainsi radicalement de la doctrine baha’ie, qui interdit un tel engagement. Qui plus est, dans
les premiers temps, le caractère flou de l’appartenance à la communauté baha’ie ne
permettait pas aux membres d’appliquer avec rigueur des critères d’adhésion. À compter
de 1920, existe toutefois une situation différente : un caractère officiel de l’appartenance
à la communauté baha’ie, associé à une prohibition systématique de toute participation à
la politique. Ceci étant, les Baha’is de la première heure se sont officiellement retirés soit
de la communauté baha’ie soit du militantisme politique. Fondée en 1844, la religion
bahai’e compte de nos jours environ 33 000 adeptes au Canada.

Introduction
This paper explores the background and experiences of some of Canada’s earliest Bahá’ís
who were engaged in socialist movements. On the surface, the connection with such
movements seems uncharacteristic for Bahá’ís, because the Bahá’í community is
avowedly apolitical. Nevertheless, the stories of these early Bahá’ís invite closer study
because the Bahá’í teachings are concerned with a number of issues that seem to echo
some socialist understandings of social and economic justice.

The Bahá’ís in Canada form part of the global Bahá’í community which originated in mid-
nineteenth century Persia (now called Iran) when Bahá’u’lláh (1817-1892) proclaimed
himself to be a Messenger of God, fulfilling the millenial visions of previously revealed
religions such as Christianity and Islam. While the Bahá’í tenets from its founding days
address matters related to both personal conduct and social issues, they are also mystical
in nature and embody a program or a system calling for the structural reorganization of
human society. This system envisions a planetary society with a common script and
language, universal education, no racial discrimination, equality between women and men,
harmony between science and religion, a world tribunal, and a democratically-elected
parliamentary form of world government. On a personal level, the Bahá’í teachings insist
on a moral code of conduct.2

A number of Canadians who attended sessions at the World Parliament of Religions in
Chicago, Illinois in 1893 became Bahá’ís. As a result of the efforts of Bahá’ís, newly-
arrived from Egypt, more Canadians enrolled in the new religion in 1897. Although others
in London, Ontario, Montreal, Quebec and elsewhere joined in successive years, the idea
of a Bahá’í community did not become viable until the mid-1910s or early 1920s. Until
that time, rather than forming a cohesive community, Canadian followers of this new
religion remained simply an aggregate of individual members.

Centrality of the Concept of Social Justice to the Bahá’í World View
Because the core message underlying and supporting the Bahá’í social and personal
teachings revolves around the unity of humankind, the concept of justice plays a pre-
eminent role in the envisioned transformation of local, national, and global society. In
fact, according to Bahá’í teachings, justice is also the hallmark of personal and social
relationships. Richard Thomas (1993), a Bahá’í scholar, has written extensively about the
correlation between racial unity and social progress as corrolaries of justice. Badi Shams
(1989) highlights the Bahá’í principles of justice in the economic realm. Another scholar,
John Huddleston (1989) surveys society’s search for social and economic justice in light
of the Bahá’í teachings. The Bahá’í International Community which represents the Bahá’ís

> ... a concern for justice is the indispensable compass in collective decision-

> appropriate courses of action selected. In such a climate the perennial
> tendencies toward manipulation and partisanship are far less likely to deflect the
> decision-making process (Bahá’í International Community, 1995: 12-13).

> The deep Bahá’í interest in justice originates in some of the elemental writings of
> Bahá’u’lláh, the founder of the Bahá’í Faith. For example, the second admonition in one
> of his key works, The Hidden Words, contains this phrase, “The best beloved of all things
> in My sight is Justice.”(Bahá’u’lláh, [1858] 1970: 1). In the collection of his writings,

> among earth’s inhabitants (1978: 66-67). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the son of Baha’u’lláh who
> travelled in North America, remarked in answering a question about socialism that “so far
> great injustice has befallen the common people” and that “laws must be made because it
> is impossible to be satisfied with the present system” (1922 : 231).

> That the Bahá’í conception of justice remains a central concern of the Bahá’í community
> is confirmed by a recent letter from the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the
> United Kingdom to Ms. Audrey Miller, Co-Chair of the Jubilee Debt Campaign:

> in sustainable social justice (including the removal of the gross extremes of
> wealth and poverty that currently exist) depends on the growth of a new spiritual
> understanding that all human beings are part of one family (2004).

educational and attitudinal challenges to be met for the majority of society to accept,
voluntarily and willingly; a rebalancing of economic extremes. Thus, the ballot box and
partisan political debate, however important and valuable it may be for others in society to
pursue, is not where Bahá’ís chose to put their energy. Unity and voluntary, willing
affirmation of economic justice, from the Bahá’í perspective is a requirement as society
attempts to manufacture or regulate or legalize a redistribution of wealth. The problem
with partisan politics (although Bahá’ís certainly uphold legislation such as a progressive
tax system, which is indeed found in the Bahá’í writings) is that it would enforce a change
in behavior without a real change in attitude and values at the most important level of all.
It lacks, then, the motivational ground that can truly support a sustainable and evolving
economy and society where there is greater economic justice. Experiments to carry out
economic and social reform towards greater levels of justice often generate unpredictable
consequences which are more costly to society, in the long run, than the cure produced.

Bahá’ís believe they are fighting a longer struggle against injustice in which they must, as
their priority (while cheering on those who chose partisan political battles of various
kinds), put their focus into that level of motivation and commitment to justice where
religion is the most effective operative force. As one Bahá’í put it:

> My Bahá’í convictions are almost as much due to the more refined and more
> persuasive program of social action which the Bahá’í Faith uses (consultation,
> unity before all else, voluntarism, not regulation and enforced legislative action,
> etc.) as it was more spiritual, historical and philosophical persuasion that one
> meets when encountering the Bahá’í Faith (Filson, 2005).

These various teachings about social and economic justice, lead one naturally to ask: what
is the Bahá’í approach to socialism?

Bahá’í Approach to Socialism
The forerunner of the Bahá’í Faith, the Báb, 1819-1850, heralded a view of society that,
amongst other things, emphasized its communal character. However, when the Báb
thought of socialism, it was not in the European sense (ie. the defeat of capital by labour).
Rather, he added a concept of socialism to his doctrines “which formulated the equality of
all, sweeping away social classes and distinctions, and ordaining a community of property
... “ (Balyuzi, 1973: 220). Mirza Abu’l-Fadl, an early and prominent Bahá’í scholar,
summarized the Bahá’í position on various issues related to socialism as follows:

> ... these three firm and irrefutable ordinances, namely, first: the question of
> heritage by which monopoly of wealth will be removed and the question of
> socialism solved; second: the question of universal peace and international
> agreements regarding disarmament and conserving expenditure now devoted to

> implements of war; [and] third: the question of all being commanded to acquire
> a profession, art or trade ... such as farmers, laborers, et al. (Abu’l-Fadl, 1998:
> 37)

> The Bahá’í interest in, and perspective on socialism, is most vividly expressed through the
> talks delivered by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (1988) during his journey throughout the Western
> hemisphere, which included a visit to London in 1912. During his travels through Europe
> and North America (including Canada) he had ample opportunity to meet with socialists
> and proponents of similar causes, advocating the removal of the extremes of poverty and
> wealth. Despite his empathy with many socialist tenets, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (1969) dissuaded
> believers from joining socialist parties.

> Given the importance accorded to all forms of justice by the Bahá’í teachings, one would
> not be surprised if the Bahá’í community engaged in partisan politics to achieve the lofty
> goal of justice in the personal, social, political, and economic spheres. Instead, one finds
> the Bahá’í community explicitly non-partisan in its approach to the affairs of the world.
> The position taken by the local, national, and international Bahá’í community is that of
> non-interference in political affairs (Universal House of Justice, 1970).3

> The prohibition against Bahá’ís’ joining politically-motivated causes is not the only reason
> why Bahá’ís do not join socialist movements. The current Bahá’í stance takes issue with
> socialism because of its emphasis on materialism and the lack of recognition given to the
> spiritual dimensions of human and societal life:

> The time has come when those who preach the dogmas of materialism, whether
> of the east or the west, whether of capitalism or socialism, must give account of
> the moral stewardship they have presumed to exercise (The Universal House of
> Justice, 1985).

> Nevertheless, social activism is an important and relevant part of Bahá’í life. The Bahá’ís
> see no contradiction between advocating justice of all kinds, while remaining aloof from
> partisan politics. In essence, the main problem one encounters with the study of social
> activism in the Bahá’í Community is that the general conception of social activism is
> defined by one particular practice. While the inherent Bahá’í message nurtures social
> activism, it does so in an apolitical fashion. How does one critique society without
> engaging in protest? Karlberg (2004: ix) does not believe, from his Bahá’í perspective,
> that “social change is best pursued through oppositional strategies.”

> Indeed, it is easy to misinterpret Bahá’í social activism in critical discourse. As Karlberg

However, Bahá’ís do vote in general elections–and are encouraged to do so (Hornby, 1988).

two concepts is greeted with scepticism. For contemporary Bahá’ís, however, the creation
of their distinctive administrative structure, allows for the establishment of social justice.
This structure embodies democratically-elected councils at the local, national, and
international level, without nominations, platforms, constituencies, or secret ballot. Local
and national governing bodies are elected annually by adult Baha’is residing in local civil
jurisdictions and national entities, respectively. The international governing council (the
Universal House of Justice) is elected every five years by all national governing bodies.
Each body contains nine members. While the Bahá’í writings insist that the decision-
making process at all levels should involve the full frank and full expression of thoughts
(and even encourages the clash of conflicting ideas as the source of arriving at ‘truth’), it
is these governing councils as institutions that carry authority, not the individuals that
happen to be their members. These are some of the elements that blend individual
initiative and institutional governance.

In the early days of the Bahá’í Faith in Canada, one notes a striking presence of people
with multiple memberships in a number of social movements, including socialism. The
next section offers a synopsis of these Bahá’í activists, followed by a discussion of how
such multiple memberships were possible.4

Early Canadian Bahá’ís
i) Paul Kingston Dealy
Among the close circle of those early Bahá’ís was Paul Kingston Dealy (d. 1935), who
declared his new-found faith in March 1897 when the Chicago Bahá’í community
numbered about thirty people. Originally from Saint John, New Brunswick, Dealy moved
to Winnipeg, Manitoba, in the 1870s. There, at the age of 31, he apprenticed as a railroad
engineer and was eventually credited with inventing a system that ejected ashes from
locomotive engines. After marrying Adelaide Stewart in 1881, his first son was born in a
boxcar that also served as a home for the Dealy couple (Stockman, 1985).

Dealy proved to be one of the most active Bahá’í teachers (Stockman, 1985: 96). He cut
a lively figure. Not only musically gifted, he was, according to his grandson, “fiercely
dedicated to whatever was his current interest” (Dealy. 1984). These interests were indeed
far-ranging: steam engines, building railroad lines, religion, politics, writing, farming, and
“looking out for his family” (Stockman, 1985: 88). He lived the remainder of his life as a
“struggling” farmer (Stockman, 1985: 88) in a Single-Tax colony. The colony attracted
socialists who were interested in its collectivist endeavours which included such things as
a telephone system, a water-supply system, and a school. When “P.K.D.” died in 1935, he
was the “oldest living Master Mechanic” of the Canadian Pacific Railway (Stockman,
1985: 87). Dealy’s attachment to the Bahá’í Faith was in line with his conceptions about
a society and economy that centred around the community rather than the individual.

acknowledge the generous permission granted by Wilfrid Laurier University Press for the use of
extracts of some of these previously published passages.

> Settlers’ Union of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, when he played a key part in securing
> white support for the early phase of Louis Riel’s 1885 movement (Flanagan, 1976). As
> Riel’s secretary, he “championed the rights of the poor settlers, as well as those of the

I thank one of the Socialist Studies reviewers for his/her observation that Jaxon was engaged in the
movement for representative government.

Riel trusted Jackson. This special relationship, however, was not destined to last long. Riel
became ever more insistent in his claim that the Indians and the Métis were the perpetual
landlords of the Northwest while Jackson believed in a joint custody of the land with the
white settlers. In an effort to come closer to the Métis cause, Jackson became a Catholic
in 1885 and changed his name to Honoré Jaxon, to honour his Catholic conversion. Soon
Riel declared himself as a prophet; as the voice of aboriginals throughout the world
(Smith, 1981a). Demonstrating his attachment to the new “prophet,” Jaxon walked for
three miles over the snow, “wearing on his feet moccasins alone, without socks,” to meet
Riel (Smith 1981a: 18). Canadian troops captured Jaxon and in 1885, the authorities
mounted a trial against Jaxon for treason-felony, but acquitted him by reason of insanity.8
Escaping the Selkirk, Manitoba, asylum in which he was confined, Jaxon fled to the
United States (Smith, 1981a; Flanagan, 1976).

The fervour of this “bookish,” and “short, slight man” (Smith, 1981a: 10, 16) grew
stronger in the United States. His long “straight raven-black hair” (Smith, 1981b: 90) lent
credibility to his claim that he was Métis and enabled him to speak on behalf of
aboriginals. He dedicated his new life to anarchism, opposing authority and protecting
freedom of expression. He made his living by building sidewalks and curb walls on
contract, as well as tutoring Greek, science, and Hebrew.

From the early 1890s, Jaxon espoused many causes, small and large, which involved
exposing a ring that thrived at the expense of taxpayers, trying to end corruption at City
Hall, supporting various political candidates, and joining an American colonization
company. But his radical politics interfered with his making a living. In 1897, when he
turned 33, this “socialist organizer” (Flanagan, 1976: 175-176) grew weary of his
activities, married for the first time in his life, and discovered the Bahá’í Faith. He had
followed Bahá’í classes in Chicago for several weeks when he enrolled in June (Stockman,
1985: 92).

As an intellectual and as a “man of keen wit ... consumed with a love of his people” (The
Pittsbugh Post quoted in Smith, 1981b: 91), Jaxon began once again to pursue his many
interests, including the design of a tunnelling machine and a device that would decrease
the effects of earthquakes on buildings. He also tried to convince the city of Chicago to
build a speaker’s corner, while remaining active in the Chicago Federation of Labor.9

It seems quite certain that Jaxon did not discriminate among his various causes, including

\[8\] Four days earlier Louis Riel himself was put on trial, accused by the Canadian government of
instigating the 1885 “rebellion” (Smith, 1981a: 10).

\[9\] Jaxon was quick to defend those on trial, and, in one case was involved in a vigorous letter-writing
campaign to President Theodore Roosevelt. The President replied to just one letter, that of Honoré
Jaxon (Smith, 1981b: 92).

> at the age of 90.

> Party (Smith, 1981b: 94-95).

Smith (1981b: 100) claims Aimee married Honoré in 1900, but the appearance of her married name
and as a Bahá’í in 1897 suggests that she married him several years earlier.

Minutes, 10 February 1906), she did much teaching of the Bahá’í Faith in small groups
and before large audiences.13 Both she and her husband offered liberal hospitality at
Bahá’í functions in the community.14

The Jaxons returned briefly to Canada, 1907-1909, to visit Montfort’s niece, Cicely
Plaxton in Saskatchewan (Smith, 1992). Montfort left Jaxon after the 1914-1918 war,
possibly with his encouragement, for like many anarchists, he saw ‘marriage’(as far as the
woman’s interests were concerned) as “a man-made scheme for the annexing of female
slaves” (Smith, 1981b: 95).

iii) Rose Henderson
Another woman adherent in the early days in Canada was Rose Henderson, née Wills, who
was born in Ireland (Anonymous, 1937) in 1868 or 1869 and came to Canada in 1893
when she was about 24 years old.15 Many of Henderson’s interests spanned her whole life,
while a number of others seem more concentrated in particular periods. Henderson had
long-term interests in promoting health. She succeeded in getting Parliament to amend the
1912 Drug Act to prevent the sale of medications except by doctor’s prescription (Roberts
and Tunnell, 1936) and was in touch with a British Bahá’í, who was a member of the
executive committee of the State Medical Service Association, a body set up to promote
the concept of a national medical service (Momen, 1975). The Association provided
evidence to the government committee that produced the Dawson Report, a report that is
acclaimed by medical historians as one of the most important and far-sighted documents
of the modern age and as one of the foundations of the British National Health Service.

Her career had many overlapping interests: mothers and children, peace and the status of
women, juveniles, labour, politics and public office, and education. She was also a prolific
writer and poet.16 One hundred years ago, early in her career, she published a little book
of stories and poetry about poor children, Kids What I Knows (Henderson, 1902). Her
foreword states that “Man through his love of power and greed for gold has created
poverty (the worst of all crimes) and through the unequal distribution of wealth he has
compelled unequal opportunity.” In an interview with the Montreal Daily Star
(Anonymous, 1912: 12), Henderson was already alerting her readers to the fact that the
country’s legislators had dealt only with the production and protection of wealth and with
the adult – “mostly with the male adult.” According to her, society had imposed immense

Labour movement.” The Windsor Tribune described her as a speaker of ‘rare ability,
marshalling her facts clearly and delivering them with a force that carries conviction’
(cited in Roberts and Turnell, 1936: 497; and Anonymous, 1927). In an interview with the
Montreal Daily Star (11 September 1912: 12), Henderson made the following statement:
“We have established bureaux for the investigation of agriculture, forestry, mines,
astronomy, bees, hogs and insects, but the human race, the most wonderful and sacred of
all God’s creatures has been the last thing to receive attention.” Desiring first-hand
information, Henderson worked in “factories and sweat-shops, laundries, restaurants and
private homes” and lived in the homes of miners in Canada and Great Britain
(Anonymous, 1927). Henderson maintained contact with William Mackenzie King,
Canada’s prime minister. In July 1926, for example, she wrote to him, urging him to take
on reforms “in the interests of justice, fair play and Constitutionalism” (Mackenzie King
Papers, 1926: 112399).

According to some accounts, from 1926 to autumn 1930 she travelled to Germany and the
Soviet Union to study political and social conditions. Henderson’s granddaughter, Anne,
recounted that Henderson wanted to travel to Russia ‘to see what happened’ after the
Revolution of 1917.19 In Britain, Henderson studied sociology and economics for two
years at London University under Professor Laski (1893-1950) and others.20

Laski was a celebrated scholar and socialist at the London School of Economics from 1920
to 1934, and author of thirty-one books. A ‘public intellectual’, he was active in the
Labour Party and the Socialist League (Kramnick and Sheerman, 1993: 4-7). Like
Henderson, Laski undertook a visit to the Soviet Union (in 1934). As it turns out, it was at
the height of Henderson’s involvement with the Labour movement, at the cusp of her
becoming involved in partisan politics, that her support of the Bahá’í Faith waned.

In the early 1930s, she became a member of the executive of the Ontario Labour Party
(Socknat, 1987: 132), and in 1934 she was successful in defending her Co-operative
Commonwealth Federation (CCF) candidacy to the Ontario legislature for Toronto-
Dovercourt in the general elections (Roberts and Turnell, 1936: 497). In 1935, she was the
Parkdale, Ontario, candidate for parliament, the same year that she was present at the
Congress of the Canadian League against War and Fascism (CLWF) (Light and Pierson,
1990: 348). In 1936, she became a “leading figure” in the Toronto CCF Women’s Joint
Committee, while at the same time serving on the executive of the Ontario Labour Party
at a time when there was a “brief flowering of feminist support for the radical left”
(Socknat, 1987: 132-134, 325). In 1934, she was an active member of the Toronto Board

1863 in Baghdad, Iraq. Although deeply based in religious faith, the beginnings of the
movement disturbed the social landscape of Iran with its advocacy of socialist-like
principles and aims. The resulting upheavals evoked interest and attention among
Westerners, especially scholars, authors, and playwrights who were deeply moved by the
wholesale, violent opposition by secular and religious leaders in Iran to the new religion.
From that perspective alone, the new religion attracted followers who were already deeply
concerned with social and economic justice and democracy.

The religion’s boundaries were quite porous in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. There was no, or very little scrutiny of membership requirements and its
organizational life was at best embryonic, even though the founder of the religion had
sketched out a detailed view of a future society. Thus, membership was fluid. However,
as criteria of membership became more transparent, including the prohibition of engaging
in partisan politics, those who joined the new religion with mixed motivation, gradually
withdrew, passively or deliberately. Indeed, all three of the individuals presented in this
article, Paul Kingston Dealy, Honoré Jaxon, and Henderson, became disaffected. By
1927, the North American governing body of the Bahá’ís (the National Spiritual Assembly
of the Bahá’ís of the United States and Canada) had decided on formal membership
criteria, along with by-laws that would govern the work and operation of the religion.
Four years earlier, in 1923, work had already begun to formalize the nature, structure, and
election of local Bahá’í governing councils (local Spiritual Assemblies) which is still
followed today.

In addition to porous membership boundaries, the early Bahá’ís in the western hemisphere
did not have access to many of the Bahá’í sacred writings (originally written in Persian and
Arabic), containing the relevant Bahá’í teachings governing personal affairs and social
relationships. The early Bahá’ís’ understanding of their new religion stemmed primarily
from those believers who had first-hand knowledge of the Head of the Bahá’í Faith in the
Holy Land. Visitors to Palestine which already served as the centre of the new religion
brought back “pilgrim’s notes” (Piff, 2000: 39-41). These pilgrim’s notes contained their
personal accounts and advice they received in the Holy Land and were copiously retyped,
copied, and shared with others. The fact that these letters were intended for personal
guidance and that other readers were quite unaware of the context of the advice contained
in them, contributed to a patchwork of ideas about the new religion’s teachings. Such an
emphasis on individualistic interpretations would prove to have a negative influence on
some members of a new religious faith. From the Bahá’í perspective, it paved the way for
the understandably rather distinctive and unique views held by individuals who then found
it difficult to accept the higher spiritual authority vested in the Bahá’í writings and Head
of the Bahá’í Faith.

> Finally, the actual publication of Bahá’í teachings in the western hemisphere took the form
> of individual Bahá’ís’ publishing their personal views and understandings. Although there
> was some early translation and publication of some of the sacred texts, they were very few
> in number.23 These early translations of Bahá’í texts were generally quite inadequate; thus,
> it was understandable that some of the early believers grafted their own ideas onto this
> unsatisfactory foundation.

> Conclusion
> The authentic Bahá’í interest in economic and social justice led some early Bahá’ís in
> Canada to see joining the Bahá’í religion as a natural extension or adjunct to their socialist
> impulses. Even though Bahá’í teachings insist on non-involvement in partisan political
> affairs, the association of these early Bahá’ís with socialism was probably due to the lack
> of available published Bahá’í writings, which allowed these individuals to develop their
> distinctive personal opinions about the nature and purpose of the Bahá’í Faith. Bahá’í
> membership boundaries, moreover, were also porous. It was only when the criteria for

> at least from the Bahá’í perspective.

Today, the corpus of what constitutes Bahá’í Writings include 5,000 items (whether as books or
> letters) revealed by Baha’u’llah, some 15,000 letters by his son and successor ‘Abdu’l-Baha, 36,000
> letters by Shoghi Effendi, Guardian and interpreter of the Bahá’í Faith, and innumerable items
> provided by the Universal House of Justice, the international governing body of the Bahá’í worldwide
community.
