        Typological Figuration and the Meaning of “Spiritual”:
The Qurʾanic Story of Joseph

Todd Lawson
University of Toronto

introduction
The Qurʾan is not without a center of narrative gravity despite its notoriously challenging
narrative flow. This becomes especially apparent when we are being told about the experi-
ence of particular prophets or messengers with their proper community. History and the
rise and fall of civilizations and cultures are punctuated by the appearance of these special
envoys, according to the Qurʾan—thus their epic struggles in the divinely inspired effort to
guide humans from ignorance to enlightenment and from savagery to civilization in whatever
community they have existed (prophets have been sent to all of them, according to Q 16:36).
However, such narrative continuity is frequently difficult to detect “on the page.” In these
instances, certain characteristic Qurʾanic literary features maintain the integrity and coher-
ence of the whole in the absence of explicit and continuous, unbroken narrative dramatic
movement.

The following is an attempt to discuss, in sequence, (1) typological figuration as it per-
tains to (2) the story of Joseph, concluding with a focus on one of the main “characters” in
the story, namely, the famous shirt (qamīṣ), which functions as a touchstone of narrative
continuity and as a symbol of Joseph’s spiritual journey and travails. This exploration starts
from a premise that the Qurʾan and tafsīr are both literature. Typological figuration, a vener-
able and powerful literary device, is in both instances one of the central keys to an otherwise
sometimes opaque Qurʾanic narrative continuity. In this article it will be seen that typologi-
cal figuration functions beyond the confines of “mere” literature to inform Islamic piety and
religious thought. 1

i. typological figuration
While typological figuration has long been recognized as an important and persuasive
literary feature of the Bible and even its exegesis, the Qurʾan and the vast literary web that
it generated have not yet been subject to the same kind of thorough examination we find,
for example, in Leonhard Goppelt’s classic study. There it was demonstrated beyond any
possible doubt that the authors of the New Testament saw in the life and teachings of Jesus
a typological fulfillment (cum repetition) of a variety of distinctive themes and motifs and
“promises” of the Old Testament. The New Testament is, through typological exegesis, a

Author’s note: This research was first presented at the Qurʾanic Studies Tafsir Workshop sponsored by the
Institute of Ismaili Studies (London, October 2009). My thanks go to Karen Bauer for the original invitation, and
to other colleagues, especially Sebastian Günther, Leonard Lewisohn, Devin Stewart, and Stefan Winter, for help-
ful suggestions and corrections. I would also like to thank the students in my seminar at the University of Toronto
“The Qurʾan and the Apocalyptic Imagination (2010–2011)” for feedback, discussions, and suggestions. Rebekah
Zwanzig and Omid Ghaemaghami have both helped me in various, invaluable ways, and I am very grateful to the
anonymous reviewers of JAOS for their time and meticulous care in helping to improve this article.

1. This is in line with Frye’s observation (1990: xv) that the Bible is “a work of literature plus.”

Journal of the American Oriental Society 132.2 (2012)                                                         221

tafsīr of the Hebrew Bible and the mission of Jesus is perfectly and seamlessly identified (at
least for the authors and their readers) with what has come before. As a result, there is no
doubt about the identity of such Old Testament types as “the Lamb of God” or “the Suffering
Servant.” Even the experience of Jonah in the belly of the whale is seen as a prefigurement
of the mission and role of Jesus, especially his period in the tomb before the resurrection. 2

Typological figuration is, of course, found frequently in many other contexts outside the
strictly religious. Since Goppelt’s foundational work on the power and prevalence of typo-
logical figuration at work in the New Testament, we have grown accustomed to recognizing
this literary figure and its persuasive rhetorical and poetic efficacy in various settings. It
represents history in a series of conceptual, as distinct from verbal, rhymes. Often we see it
at work in studies of history and historiography, ancient, modern, and contemporary. In the
“logic” (which transcends logic) of typology, Augustus can be both Aeneas and Romulus
redivivus at the same time. It has been suggested that our own confidence in the process
of—and one might add the structure we give to—history is probably derived, whether wit-
tingly or unwittingly, from the compelling symmetry and meaning that typological figuration
delivers. 3

Typology says that the old world has ended, a new one is about to be born. Those who
perceive this shift and are sympathetic to it, such as the early followers of the Prophet
Muḥammad, will be persecuted and ostracized for merely “understanding.” The understand-
ing is that Muḥammad represents the new return of the life-giving, divine, ancient and eter-
nal, prophetic spirit. Therefore, this new and numerically insignificant community depends
upon the revelation for encouragement, solace, and promise that “it will all work out” despite
the serious hardships and obstacles it will undoubtedly be its fate to encounter and suffer.
(Paradise, for example, is typically described in the Qurʾan when the Hour or the Last Day
is mentioned. 4) Typology is a figure that unites time, harmonizes it, and gathers it together:
“the type exists in the past and the antitype in the present, or the type exists in the present and
the antitype in the future.” 5 This reflects a basic attitude toward the world and one’s place in
it with regard to the passing of time. What was formally mere time past is now, as a result
of the prophetic imagination, History. So it assumes heretofore-unimagined importance and,
at the same time, the mystery of this great secret/importance is revealed. 6 The past is now
seen as part of a process through which “meaning” may be identified with human experience.
Interpreting Shiʿi theological philosophy on the problem of time and history, Henry Corbin’s
well-known observation is impossible to ignore: “Our thinkers perceive the world not as
‘evolving’ in a horizontal and rectilinear direction, but as ascending: the past is not behind us

2. Goppelt 1982. For Lamb of God, Suffering Servant, and Jonah as typological prefigurations of Jesus as
antitype, see pp. 189 and 72–73, respectively. See also Goppelt’s near contemporary: Auerbach 1984. On repetition,
see Kierkegaard 2009.

For a good example of how the “typological perspective” has permeated Western art and culture, note the numer-
ous interlocking typological pairs depicted in the Sistine Chapel, both around the walls and on the ceiling. The walls
present a parallel history of the “epic of the Hebrews” compared with the history of Jesus and his followers. The
ceiling, to cite just one example, portrays Jonah with the fish beside him turned towards God, as a prefigurement of
the resurrection, symbol of the New Covenant that takes the place of the Old Covenant.

‘reckoning day’ (yawm al-ḥisāb), ‘the day of judgment’ (yawm al-dīn), ‘the last day’ (al-yawm al-ākhir), or ‘the day
of resurrection’ (yawm al-qiyāma). . . .” Kinbergh 2004: 12a. See also Lawson forthcoming a.

but ‘beneath our feet’.” 7 Such a statement actually may go to the heart of a general Islamic
view of time and history, and thus has implications far beyond an understanding of Corbin’s
basic sources, as in this statement from the Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān:

> The entire world in all its variety was created by the one creator at one particular moment. It fol-
> lows that oneness was the ideal state for it at all times and that to which it should always aspire.
> As the beginning was one, so the expected end of the world is one for everyone and everything.
> Whatever is and takes place in between these two definite points of created time, no matter
> how varied in detail, follows a set overall pattern. Thus the history of the past and of the future,
> including that of the present, is fundamentally uniform. No distinction between the three modes
> of time need be made by the observer of human history. 8

This may be akin to what al-Qurṭubī was referring to when he characterized the Night of
Power as the point where all time meets, jamīʿ al-dahr. Michael Sells has spoken eloquently
in this same connection about what one might call a “sacrament of time and history” or per-
haps better an “icon of time and history” and its centrality for Islamic religion in his classic
article on the Night of Power: 9

> The Christian mystics, John the Scot Erigena and Meister Eckhart, both emphasized the combi-
> nation of perfect and imperfect tenses as essential to an intimation of the “eternal moment,” the
> moment that for Eckhart always has occurred and always is occurring, and which in his Christian
> interpretation corresponds to the eternal birth of the son of God in the soul. . . . (p. 249 n. 27)
> Through such aural, syntactic, and thematic inter-twining among the rūḥ passages involving cre-
> ation, revelation, and yawm ad-dīn, of which the above example is only one of many that could
> be cited, the spirit takes on a temporal multivalence. The occurrence of the term rūḥ within these
> three distinct moments engenders an intertextual acoustical-semantic dynamic that plays against
> the separation of the three moments and transforms normal understandings of time. (p. 254)
> The connection between rūḥ and qadr in sūrat al-qadr suggests that this transformation of time
> into a primordial unity is an aspect of qadr. . . . Translators of the Qurʾan have tended to choose
> terms like “power” for qadr, terms that express only one side of the semantic field. It is my view
> that “destiny” might come closer to expressing the mutivalence of the term, though no single
> English term would seem sufficient. (p. 255)
> The classical interpreters emphasize the storing up of future events in the laylat al-qadr, a phe-
> nomenon that represents the containment of a span of time (whether one year or all time) within
> a single moment. (p. 256)

Even if all of the details of this new “meaning” are not completely clear now, they will be
made clear in due course. When this happens, the present magically becomes the antitype or
repetition of previous history but with the added luminosity of truth revealed, and fulfilled:

8. Rosenthal 2002: 430. Frye (1969: 247) shares the apposite rhetorical musing:

Compare William Faulkner’s now even more famous line in Requiem for a Nun: “The past is never dead. It’s not
even past.” Thus an otherwise “spiritual” perspective seems central, at least in the mind of Faulkner, to the making
of what we call “art.”

the code cracked. 10 We now understand, and a mystery we may not even have recognized
as existing previously is now solved. Such understanding may also acquire the features of
revolution, as when the past is simply obliterated and rendered no longer pertinent. Northrup
Frye uses the image of waking from sleep:

> When we wake up from sleep, one world is simply abolished and replaced by another. This
> suggests a clue to the origin of typology: it is essentially a revolutionary form of thought and
> rhetoric. We have revolutionary thought whenever the feeling “life is a dream” becomes geared
> to an impulse to waken from it. 11

The prominence of typology in the Qurʾan and tafsīr as a hermeneutic presupposition or
strategy suggests an association of this literary conceit with what has so aptly been described
as the “apocalyptic imagination.” 12 It is important to observe that not only does typology
move through time and transcend time (Frye’s words), but, in fact, typology frequently
erases or collapses time. It does this by insisting that in the presence of God all things are
somehow happening at once. 13 Time is that which “sorts them out” for human consump-
tion. It is the obliteration of time—perhaps centripetally analogous with the splitting of the
atom—that would seem to summon up the powerful literary energies and concerns of bona
fide revelation and focus them into an apocalypse.

The constant occurrence of the pervasive figure of typology throughout the Qurʾan pro-
vides one bank, if you like, for the narrative stream flowing through the Qurʾan from “begin-
ning” to “end.” 14 The overall structure is much the same as that described in sura Yūsuf
some years ago: circular 15 and chiastic. 16 The Qurʾan has no beginning and no end, although
it contains within its sphere numerous discrete narratives, each with their own beginnings,
middles, and ends, whether explicit or implicit.

Note that typological figuration applies to both the prophets and their communities. The
first Muslims compared—and in some sense identified—themselves with the ordeals expe-
rienced by the Children of Israel and the followers or qawm of all other prophets. And, in
the nature of things, this was as it should be. To quote from a scholar of Jewish apocalyptic:

> In the pressing need to define spiritual identity in the face of challenge, and to sustain hope, a
> basic perspective is nevertheless identifiable around which apocalyptic systems grow: it is the
> perspective of apocalyptic eschatology which furnishes a way of viewing reality which denies
> the apparent superior position of opposing groups of any validity vis-à-vis divine purpose. 17

The typological iteration or rendering of Muḥammad’s prophethood points to the erasure
of time and history in a persuasive and compelling gesture of the prophetic imagination. All
time is dissolved or redissolved into the original moment characterized by the Qurʾan as the
day of the covenant (Q 7:172), a time outside of time in a place beyond place that may indeed

13. Such a radical mode of reading has been identified by Auerbach (1984: 42) vis-à-vis Augustine:

> the Old Testament from the concrete historical reality, he nevertheless has an idealism which removes the
> concrete event, completely preserved as it is, from time and transposes it into the perspective of eternity.

be seen as a symbol or metaphor for what has recently come to be discussed in other, more
scientistic settings as the birth of consciousness. 18 The apocalyptic secret is revealed: The
chaos of mutually exclusive, historical religions is now transformed into a harmony of peri-
odic divine revelation, the reading of which is made possible by the newly proclaimed (yet
simultaneously ancient, viz., badīʿ) 19 alphabet of prophets and divine messengers who are
shown to be profoundly related and of one purpose. This new alphabet forms the language
for the proper reading of the past. The nightmare of history is dealt with by demonstrating
exactly how illusory and ephemeral “history as time” is. It is awareness, consciousness,
understanding, and their like that are, by comparison, substantial and permanent (though
atemporal and supraspatial) and therefore superior to (as in ṣāḥib ‘owner, master of’) history.
This is one reason why it may be possible to translate islām as ‘enlightenment’. Obviously,
this is not a literal translation. However, based on the philology of Ignaz Goldziher and
Toshihiko Izutsu, it is arguable that the true opposite of jahl ‘ignorance, savagery’ is not ʿilm
‘knowledge’ but rather ḥilm ‘moderation, patience, civility’ for which Islam, especially in its
adjectival form islāmī and used in diametrical opposition to jāhilī and its permutations, may
be seen as a near synonym. 20 “‘The ḥalīm is the civilized man’, as opposed to the djāhil, the
‘barbarian’.” 21

Based on comparison and contrast between two principles, typological figuration—­
ultimately dependent upon symmetry and duality so clearly and unambiguously at work
in the Qurʾan—may be thought to articulate in a special and distinct way the characteristic
apocalyptic élan of the Qurʾan by standing for that great secret that the Prophet Muḥammad
and the Qurʾan unveiled to the chaos of religions that confronted him and that he himself
confronted on behalf of God. The secret is none other than the interconnectedness and kin-
ship of all prophetic messages, their prophets, and their followers. 22 This is what is called
in the Islamic tradition “spiritual truth” or “reality.” The shirt of Joseph (about which more
below) is a perfect emblem or symbol of this spiritual truth.

Another key characteristic of typological figuration is that it is generative. Once the basic
pattern is introduced, it becomes a matter of the natural, fluent, and unstoppable “logic of

18. See Lawson 2008: 39–40 and Lawson 2010. Note the implication such movement or “return to the begin-
ning” has for the power of the Joseph myth to gather the heretofore scattered energies and resources of “Israel.” In
such a way does the Qurʾan’s Joseph have implications for consolidation and individuation on both the communal,
societal level and the individual, existential level. Frye’s discussion of the myth of sparagmos may be suggestive
here (1969, esp. 394–97 and 287; see also 289, 403). On the distinctive and characteristic understanding of history
in the Qurʾan, see Neuwirth 2008; Rosenthal 2002. See now also the recent discussion by Stewart 2010.

19. Badīʿ means, in a passive sense, “innovated, discovered,” but because it also evokes God the Originator/
Innovator par excellence—one of the so-called ninety-nine names (see Q 2:117; 6:101) it denotes ancientness, time-
lessness, and pre-eternity. The rhetorical and literary coincidentia oppositorum in this word is possibly one reason
the virtuoso ʿAbbāsid poets used the term to describe—and not in a self-effacing way—their own poetry. Consult,
for example, Khalafallah 1960.
Again, Auerbach’s (1984: 58) observations are apposite:

> These two comparisons, with allegory on the one hand and with the symbolical, mythical forms on the
> other, disclose figural prophecy in a twofold light: youthful and newborn as a purposive, creative, con-
> crete interpretation of universal history; infinitely old as the late interpretation of a venerable text, charged
> with history, that had grown for hundreds of years.

> 21. Pellat 1971, partly quoting Goldziher 1888–90, 1: 319ff.

22. The juxtaposition of the duality of experience and the universality of truth is a major preoccupation of the
complex and singular polymath, Muḥammad b. ʿAbd al-Karīm al-Shahrastānī (d. 548/1153) in his Qurʾan commen-
tary, Mafātīḥ al-asrār, recently beautifully explicated and analyzed in Toby Mayer 2009: 25–35.

the imagination” 23 to apply it to a number of different contexts and subjects. Thus we see
typological iterations of the Prophet Muḥammad in the characterizations of such subsequent
figures of religious authority (viz., walāya, khilāfa, imāma) as the first four caliphs (and, in a
sense, all subsequent caliphs), the imams of the Shiʿa, the great imams of the legal tradition
and religious culture (cf., e.g., al-Shāfiʿī’s Risāla for the distinctive image of the Prophet
Muḥammad that inhabits that work), and last but certainly not least, the sufi sheikh, who
may be considered a holographic or “virtual” reiteration (viz., maẓhar) of prophetic author-
ity. Thus typological figuration together with other similarly ubiquitous and characteristic
literary structures of the text is clearly communicated—both in meaning and form—to a vast
readership and audience far beyond Arabic linguistic boundaries. 24

ii. the story of joseph in the qurʾan and exegesis
With such a clear, consistent, and paradigmatic basic message, it is perhaps in the nature
of what might be termed “anti-narratological relief” that the Qurʾan itself is far from pre-
senting a unitary discrete narrative, from its “beginning” to its “end.” 25 The only sura of
the Qurʾan universally recognized to have a “proper” beginning, middle, and end is the sura
of Joseph (Q 12). 26 Thus it is possible that the main protagonist of the sura, as a paragon
of beauty, is also a paragon of order and meaning and typological figuration, which has
its own inherent beauty or aesthetic. 27 For our purposes here I would only point out that
the conclusion of this sura emphasizes the happy reunion of Joseph with his people and
most significantly with his father, Jacob. In the course of telling the story of Joseph and the
relationship implied for the current audience, Muḥammad himself is seen, by virtue of his
spiritual/typological kinship with all of the prophets and messengers, as being reunited with
his true family, who in the very act of reunion/recognition (cf. ʿirfān, maʿrifa) are given a
new measure of divine guidance, another revelation. 28 Such a reading would seem to be in
line with the distinctively Qurʾanic formal and stylistic identity between history’s movement
(type/antitype) and the pervasive Qurʾanic motif of “pairing” (zawj/tazawwuj). 29 Typologi-

24. This calls to mind Umberto Eco’s (1994: 508) widely quoted comment: “I would define the poetic effect
as the capacity that a text displays for continuing to generate different readings, without ever being completely
consumed.”

25. This is a question that arises from viewing the text from a particular perspective. Viewed from another
angle, there is neither beginning nor end.

26. This very feature was one of the reasons it was rejected as being an authentic part of the Qurʾan by a faction
of the Khārijites, according to al-Shahrastānī. The ʿAjārida, the followers of ʿAbd al-Karīm b. ʿAjrad, and especially,
it seems, the subgroup of the ʿAjārida called the Maymūniyya (followers of Maymūn al-Qaddāḥ), rejected the sura
of Joseph on the grounds precisely that it was a complete, consistent narrative (“a [mere] story”) and a love-story
at that.

27. A question awaiting a satisfactory answer is just how it came to be that most of the other clear and character-
istic attributes of the Qurʾanic Joseph seem to dissolve into insignificance in the presence of his beauty. The picture
presented by the Qurʾan is one of a very powerful, independent, and pious mind capable of controlling an entire
society. Yet it is beauty that emerges as the most important of his many qualities, according to the tradition. This is
the case with many of the Qurʾanic prophets: one key trait, at the expense of many others, becomes identified with
this or that specific prophetic figure. See Tottoli 2002.

28. It has been observed (Waldman 1986) that Muḥammad can serve, simultaneously, as the antitype for both
Joseph and Jacob. See the very suggestive comments by Frye (1969: 196), whose study of apocalypse and epic has
much relevance for the study of the Qurʾan. I am not addressing here the many ways in which Joseph functions as
a type for Jesus, the antitype.

ideas and their relationship to developing a notion of “the spiritual,” see Lawson 2008.

cal figuration expresses a longed-for consolidation of scattered, exiled, dissipated forces, in
the life both of the individual and of society. 30

On the model of the New Testament (the New Covenant) as a commentary on the Hebrew
Bible (the Old Covenant), the Qurʾan is a commentary on earlier scriptures, their tradi-
tions, and their faith communities. Through the typological identification of the Prophet
Muḥammad with all previous prophets (both known and unknown), the Qurʾan may be
thought to decode the great baffling and terrifying “nightmare of history” and its chaos
of religions—and point a way out. 31 It reveals or perhaps more accurately, lifts the veil
(Ar. kashf = Grk. apokalypsis) covering the true nature of the relationship between historical
reality, spiritual reality, and social reality. Most importantly, of course, it makes clear and
nonnegotiable the relationship between God and the world through prophethood and mes-
sengership without which there would be no understanding or meaning. And inasmuch as the
heart of this revelation or apocalypse is articulated in the “return” of the prophetic reality to
his people (as, for example, the type of the reunion of Joseph with his tribe), then it may be
thought an apocalypse of union or reunion and recognition. 32

The story of Joseph in the Qurʾan is among the favorites of Muslims in general. It is con-
sidered the “best of stories” (Q 12:3), because it is a more or less extended and consistent
narrative, unlike other suras of the Qurʾan. 33 According to al-Thaʿlabī (d. 428/1036), the
author of a qiṣaṣ al-anbiyāʾ, the story of Joseph is the most beautiful “because of the lesson
concealed in it, on account of Yūsuf’s generosity and its wealth of matter, in which prophets,
angels, devils, jinn, men, animals, birds, rulers, and subjects play a part.” 34

The contents of the sura present something of an integrated expression of the fundamental
thrust of Islam, whether from the point of view of personal religiosity and spirituality, or
from the broader perspective of humanity’s communal religious life. As with many suras of
the Qurʾan, this one also emphasizes the connection of Islam with previous religions. The
number of verses in sura 12 approximates the number of suras in the Qurʾan itself. 35 And the
sura of Joseph has been singled out 36 by various exegetes throughout tafsīr history as one
that lends itself to discussion, because, unlike many other suras of the Qurʾan, it presents a
comparatively sustained narrative. At the same time, like other suras, it is replete with many
topics considered to be key to the Islamic religion in general and the authority, role, and
vocation of prophethood in particular. Thus this sura is seen as bringing together all of the
various concerns, themes, and otherwise perhaps disparate aspects of the Qurʾanic vision
under one roof, in one place. (Or, in line with the central metaphor informing the word
“text,” it may be seen as weaving together in one “tapestry” those elements so distinctive

31. The formulation “chaos of religions” was first coined and elaborated in Lawson 2010: 189–91, on the pat-
tern of other parallel English plural formulae, such as “a pride of lions” or “an exaltation of larks.” It is meant to
suggest the social and religious disarray obtaining at the rise of Islam portrayed in the traditional Islamic histories.
A timely, related reading of the same history is in Donner 2010.

brough (1977: 131) maintains that, notwithstanding the claim of narrative consistency by mufassirūn, the story of
Joseph is “elliptic, often unintelligible without exegetical complement.”

verses. No sura has 114 verses, the number that corresponds exactly to the total number of suras in the Qurʾan.

to the Qurʾan.) The same is said of sūrat al-baqara, 37 but the difference between the two is
clear. With regard to uniting the message of the Qurʾan in one compelling and entertaining
narrative, the frankly operatic sura of Joseph “outstrips” sūrat al-baqara by many leagues.

The figure of Joseph as a spiritual hero and prophet has also been the subject of several
works. For example, Ibn al-ʿArabī took up the Qurʾanic Joseph in his Fuṣūṣ al-ḥikam as a
basis for his discussion of the spiritual imagination and the role of interpretation or “proper
understanding” (taʾwīl) of the signs of God, because this topic is also central to the unfold-
ing of the Qurʾanic story. 38 The sura has also been the subject of commentaries and elabora-
tions. To Abū Ḥāmid al-Ghazālī (d. 505/1111) is ascribed a mystical tafsīr on this sura. 39
The same work has been ascribed to Abū Ḥāmid’s younger brother Aḥmad (d. 520/1126)
and is published as Aḥsan al-qaṣaṣ. 40 Other titles for this work are al-Durra al-bayḍa and
Baḥr al-maḥabba wa-asrār al-mawadda fī tafsīr sūrat Yūsuf. The latter title was apparently
published in Bombay in 1894. Verifying the precise authorship of this “Ghazālian” work
remains to be done. Another example of the interest in the sura is the eighteenth-century
Natījat al-tafāsīr fī sūrat Yūsuf by one Shaykh Yaʿqūb b. Shaykh Muṣṭafā al-Khalwatī, com-
pleted in the year 1133/1720. This work collects excerpts from commentaries by a variety
of authors including al-Māturīdī, al-Nasafī, Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī, al-Qurṭubī, al-Qushayrī,
al-Ṭūsī, al-Zamakhsharī, and the “books of preachers.” 41 In addition to these commentaries,
GAL lists several others with some duplication. 42 A Tafsīr sūrat Yūsuf is ascribed to Mullā
Ṣadrā, although the catalogue cited lists only a Tafsīr sūrat Yā Sīn for this author. 43 There is
mention of another work with the title Aḥsan al-qaṣaṣ, this time by tāj al-ʿulamāʾ al-Naqavī,
grandson of the famous Dildār Naṣīrābādī (d. 1236/1820), who studied in Mashhad and
Karbalāʾ, 44 and who was apparently “the first Indian to return to India as a recognised muj-
tahid, having studied under Bihbahānī in Karbalā. He was instrumental in establishing the
Uṣūlī school in Oudh and also for a campaign against Sufism.” 45 This work was published
in ʿAẓīmābād, presumably sometime before 1894, the year of the author’s death. Another
Tafsīr sūrat Yūsuf is ascribed to one Aḥmad b. Asad b. Isḥāq, about whom no other details
are given. 46

In addition to studies in Arabic and other Islamic languages, the sura of Joseph has also
attracted attention from “Western scholarship”; as of this writing there are a few monographs
available on the Qurʾanic Joseph story. 47 Those who have studied the sura have approached it

from a variety of angles. Biblical and Qurʾanic comparison is probably the best represented. 48
However, there are discussions of its exegesis, 49 dramaturgical “subtext,” 50 its general lit-
erary features, 51 the symbolism (of the cloak, e.g. 52), the portrayal of love, 53 ambiguity,
betrayal, reunion, filial piety, and cosmology 54—in short, “all things (Kullu-Shayʾ).” 55

An indication of the importance that the story of Joseph has had for the Shiʿa is the
many titles of tafāsīr devoted solely to it in Dharīʿa, a multi-volume bibliographic survey
of Twelver Shiʿism. Volume one lists three separate works, two of which were written in the
nineteenth century. 56 Volume four lists ten separate entries, one of which is the previously
mentioned work of tāj al-ʿulamāʾ. 57 The first entry (no. 1512) is the above-mentioned work
by Mullā Ṣadrā. The first line of the work, which al-Ṭihrānī quotes, is the same as that said
to begin the Tafsīr sūrat Yā Sīn [Q 36] in the Sipahsālār catalogue quoted by GAL. The ninth
entry is ascribed to yet another descendant of Dildār, one Muḥammad b. al-Sayyid Dildār
ʿAlī Naqavī al-Naṣīrābādī al-Lakhnavī (d. 1326/1908). Given the well-attested antipathy of
the Uṣūliyya toward the Shaykhīs, and by extension the Bābīs, it is most interesting that the
descendants of the great Indian Uṣūlī scholar felt called upon to compose commentaries on
the sura of Joseph, perhaps as a corrective to the by then well-known, or at least infamous,
imitation of the Qurʾan by the Bāb. The Bābī enormity may have also been behind the deci-
sion to publish (in 1266/1849) the above-mentioned Natīja by al-Khalwatī.

The sura of Joseph has particular meaning for Shiʿism. In addition to the distinct relevance
of the motif of hiddenness, pointed out some years ago by Abbas Amanat, the sura may be
thought especially relevant to and reflective of the syntax and morphology of the grammar
of Shiʿi piety in a number of other instances. 58 Not least among such resonances is the role
played by the perfect transformation of time into history, a history in which betrayal and
injustice are changed for faithfulness and justice. The symmetry of the narrative is the first
signal of this. As already mentioned, this sura is prized by the greater Muslim tradition as
the shining example of Qurʾanic narrative perfection. Unlike all of the other 113 Qurʾanic
suras, this one is structured by the three sine qua non elements of both myth and story as
such: a beginning, a middle, and an end. Thus, on the one hand, it may be thought most
artificial (as in literary artifice) and, on the other, a most accurate reflection of the Islamic
religious ethos, which includes the proper ending of the story of humanity with the Day of
Judgment. Its special attraction for Shiʿism comes into play in the drama of the envy, jeal-
ousy, betrayal, and lies of Joseph’s brothers. 59 In addition, the theme of patience (ṣabr, ṣabr
jamīl) is personified in Jacob and is especially pertinent to the religious idea of “waiting [viz.,

Of course, Joseph is tremendously important to the Christian tradition as well, as is evidenced, inter alia, by
Thomas Mann’s self-described masterwork, Josef und seine Brüder, composed in four separate substantial books
between the years 1926 and 1943. His artistic rendering has recently become the focus of such scholars as Assman
2006 and Bal 2008. Of interest also is McGaha 1997.

for the hidden imam],” intiẓār. The characteristically Shiʿi institution of walāya is signaled
at Q 12:101 and alluded to rather obliquely at Q 12:84. God and His representative are the
proper rulers of society (no other prophet except Solomon is cast as a ruler). Thus Joseph
assumes the features of the verus propheta so frequently discussed by Corbin in his studies
of Ismaʿilism and Shiʿism as such. This is not to minimize the idea of interpretation (taʾwīl)
mentioned more times in this sura than in any other. Another distinctive feature of sura 12
relevant to Shiʿism is that the word bāb or its plural abwāb occurs in it more than in other
suras. For this reason it might have been thought to represent more fully than others the—
again—characteristically Shiʿi mystery of bābiyya, that is, the way in which divine authority
is made present and operative in the world: identifying the “door” through which it enters
the world and through which the world accesses the divine. There is exegetically productive
ambiguity in the term centered on the problem of whether the “door” is to God Himself or to
the hidden imam. 60 Finally, sūrat Yūsuf is an appropriate subject in Shiʿism because of a long
tradition that reveres the story of Joseph as representing the spiritual mystery of taqiyya, or
pious concealment, which is so important to Shiʿi religiosity in general. Here the absence of
the imam may be regarded as a species of taqiyya. 61

In the Shiʿi ḥadīth literature, it is said that the ṣāḥib hādhā l-amr (i.e., the Qāʾim) bears
a certain resemblance to Joseph, one example being that this expected “proof” (ḥujja) is to
attain eventual sovereignty over the world at some particular time (waqt min al-awqāt), just
as Joseph gained sovereignty over Egypt. 62 In another report the story is told of how Joseph
discovered the signs of nubuwwa in himself, 63 and an explanation of how Joseph became a
ḥujja is given. 64 In the Ikmāl al-dīn of Ibn Bābawayh, it is mentioned that God has named
Joseph “Unseen” (which is also one of the names of the Qāʾim) in Q 12:102 when He said
“That is of the tidings of the Unseen”; 65 and the proper greeting for the Qāʾim is al-salām
ʿalayhā yā baqiyyat allāh. 66 The word baqiyya, which denotes the divine remnant and also
perhaps indicates, through a related “cloth association,” the shirt (qamīṣ) of Joseph, is a
major topic in messianic Shiʿi discourse, where the term baqiyyat allāh is always a reference
to the imams’ authority, walāya, in addition to being an honorific for the hidden imam, based
partly on the exegesis of Q 11:86: baqiyyatu llāh khayrun lakum in kuntum muʾminīn. . . . 67

Muḥammad Bāqir Majlisī is quoted as saying that the ṣāḥib of “this cause” bears resem-
blance to four prophets, Moses, Jesus, Joseph, and Muḥammad, and that the prison of Joseph
(sijn) symbolizes the occultation of the imam. 68 The Mahdī will have a basket in which he
carries relics of all the prophets, including the “cup” of Joseph. 69 When the Qāʾim comes,
there will be great disagreement about the Qurʾan 70 and he will know all of the Qurʾanic
sciences, including tafsīr, taʾwīl, maʿānī, and nāsikh wa-mansūkh. 71 It is mentioned that the

In a very long commentary on a verse in his major work, Ziyārat al-jāmiʿa, in which
reference is made to the “return” (rajʿa) of the imams, Shaykh Aḥmad al-Aḥsāʾī (d. 1826),
founder of the above-mentioned Shaykhī school, mentions several, sometimes conflicting,
ḥadīths on the subject. The return of the Qāʾim will take place during the month of Jumādā
I, and before his advent (khurūj) there will be seven years of famine and little rain, “like
the years of Joseph.” 73 This obviously refers to Joseph’s interpretation of the dream of the
“king” (Q 12:46–49). Here al-Aḥsāʾī also mentions the tradition from Majlisī, which says
that the Qāʾim will say what none other has said, and will promulgate a new book that will
be difficult for the Arabs [to accept] (kitāban jadīdan wa-huwa ʿalā l-ʿarab shadīd).

iii. the shirt of joseph and the meaning of “spiritual”
If Joseph is an emblem of order and meaning, then his most famous possession, his shirt,
may be thought a metonym for the same. It is therefore of the most serious interest that this
shirt, whose origins according to Islamic tradition are to be sought in the furthest remote past,
represents the origins of prophethood itself and the clothing of Adam. 74 The shirt or mantle
(kisāʾ), in some form, becomes the credential of all subsequent prophets, playing a number of
discrete roles within the sura and Islamicate cultural life. That is, every subsequent prophet is
both himself and the actual “shirt of Joseph” that carries his scent—a complex scent redolent
of many connotations, themes, and motifs. 75

Scent is a frequent metaphor for “spiritual” reality. 76 Despite its requiring a caveat here,
one of the reasons “spiritual” continues to be useful, especially in the context of Islamic[ate]
material, is that it captures in religious language the energy and vitality of what in other
contexts may be considered from a literary angle: it is precisely the powerful literary device
of typological figuration that is captured by the term. 77 The ultimate symbol of this literary/
spiritual process or dynamic, this metaphorical and metonymical creative and revelatory

73. Al-Aḥsāʾī 1420/1999, 3: 75. The actual commentary on this verse begins on p. 48 and ends on p. 101. Much
of this is taken up with the quotation of and ancillary commentary on the notoriously long apocalyptic ḥadīth trans-
mitted by Mufaḍḍal from al-Ṣādiq.

> 74. Ricks 2000: 203. See also Bernstein 2000.

75. Note the etymological relationship between ʿarf, one word for ‘scent’, and ʿirfān/maʿrifa ‘recognition,
knowledge, gnosis'.

76. Classen 1998, esp. 60. Inverted commas are used because of the skittishness the word can provoke. One
assumes that such skittishness is the honest response to a semantic, semiotic, or usage problem, perhaps specific to
English. The technical efficacy of the term may be thought vitiated to the degree that it seems to be applied with
equal confidence and force in a number of heterogeneous contexts which may or may not have a great deal in com-
mon. However, whether as a translation of the perfectly good Arabic word rūḥānī—as it happens, the particular
“scent” at play in the story of Joseph is an etymological relative: rīḥ—or simply as reference to cognate phenomena,
persons, ideas, and forms, the term does say something that other words appear unable to evoke, connote, or denote.
See also Classen, et al. 1994: 13, 20, 45, 69, 86, for the special interest in the aroma of garments. For scent and smell
in the Qurʾan and Islam, specifically in the story of Joseph, see Stewart 2006; Schimmel 1999; Lawson 2011: chs.
2, 4; Lawson 2000, and Subtelny 2007.

77. This is not to suggest, however, that the Islamicate meaning of “spiritual” is exhausted by the literary device
of typological figuration. But it is certainly one important component of the broader category of “spiritual.” Other
layers of the notion would include ethics, comportment, and learning itself, as represented by the categories adab
and akhlāq, which rescue the idea of “spiritual” from pertaining solely to abstract intellectual constructs, tying it to
practice in the here and now. But this is not the subject at hand.

energy, is Joseph’s garment, which the Qurʾan calls a shirt (qamīṣ) and the Hebrew Bible
calls a coat of many colors (kethoneth).

Like a number of other important terms in the remarkable sura of Joseph, the shirt appears
in several key contexts that may be thought to mark important narrative transitions in the
story. In the first mention, the idea of the garment, if not the actual garment itself, is used by
the perfidious brothers to demonstrate that they had done nothing wrong (Q 12:18). The false
garment’s appearance with false blood marks the departure of Joseph from Canaan and his
journey to Egypt. The second appearance is when Joseph’s actual garment exonerates him
from the crime and sin of lust (Q 12:25–27), and by extension ingratitude (kufr). It marks the
beginning of his imprisonment, when his true gifts as a man of God and divine knowledge
are destined to be revealed and as a result of which his status in Egypt is elevated beyond
what anyone might have reasonably predicted. The third appearance is after the truth has
been revealed, the dénouement, as it were. For all intents and purposes the story has ended,
needing only the quick succession of the events that follow to burn the truth of these events
into the minds of the audience. Joseph tells his astonished brothers—­who could never have
imagined that their despised brother might have achieved such success, notoriety, and power
in Egypt—to take his shirt with them back to Canaan where Jacob languishes blind, in
grief and separation from his beloved son, Joseph, and, by association and dramatic action,
Benjamin (Q 12:93). They are commanded to lay the shirt on Jacob’s face so that the “magi-
cal” divine healing power of the shirt—its smell, fragrance, perfume—will restore Jacob’s
eyesight, eyesight that was “washed away” in weeping for his beloved son (Q 12:84). In a
subsequent complex scene, the power of the shirt and its perfume is dramatized in a most
compelling manner.

The instant the Canaan-bound caravan of Joseph’s brothers crosses the border from Egypt
there is what would be called in cinema a cutaway to Jacob’s bedside. There is probably no
more moving or powerful vignette in the Qurʾan. The grieving, languishing, aged prophet
and patriarch of Israel, despairing of the continuance of his prophetic line and the loss of
his two favorite sons, is suddenly stimulated, practically resurrected, to new life and joyous
hope. His beloved Joseph lives:

> And as soon as the caravan [with which Jacob’s sons were traveling] was on its way [and out
> of Egypt], [94] their father said [to the people around him]: “Behold, were it not that you might
> consider me a dotard, [I would say that] I truly feel the breath of Joseph [in the air]!”

Both Sunni and Shiʿi exegetes agree that the reason Jacob knew his son was alive was
because of the special scent the shirt bore, the shirt that the brothers had with them in the
returning caravan. The final scenes of the sura represent a circular closure 78 of a narrative
exemplified in what I have called elsewhere an apocalypse of reunion. 79 Here the love of
Jacob for Joseph, also originally (if tacitly in the Qurʾanic text) symbolized by the shirt, is
consummated in the migration of the entire family from Canaan to Egypt, to live in exalted
status more or less “happily ever after” as a vindication and dramatic proof of the efficacy of
the God of Jacob, His power and, of course, superiority. 80 The story of Joseph, whether in

> 78. Mir 1986.
> 79. Lawson 2011: ch. 4.

80. Obviously, this is a somewhat ironic usage. But the Qurʾan ends the story of Joseph on a note of “happily
ever after” to emphasize the wisdom and salvific value of obedience and tawḥīd. After all, this was not just any
family who was thus rescued, but the “holy remnant” of Abrahamic monotheism for which Islam is the most recent
dispensation. Thus it is also representative of the rescue of “true Islam.” Later, of course, in this specific historical
circumstance, the fortunes of the Children of Israel in Egypt take a turn for the worse. Again, Israel (and therefore

the Hebrew Bible and Tradition or in the Qurʾan, represents also what may be thought a true
model of the epic drama of the Hebrew people and, as in the case of the Qurʾan, the Muslims.
Such an epic may be on the grand historical scale, or on the scale of the interior spiritual life
of the soul. 81 In the Qurʾan the story of Joseph has an added function in that it represents
the thickening or intensification and perfection of heretofore imperfectly completed narra-
tive gestures in its partial and somewhat aborted telling of the stories of other prophets. The
sura of Joseph is a crescendo of the Qurʾanic narrative art and, coming as it does “protected”
near the center of the muṣḥaf, it functions as a reminder, an unambiguous statement of the
Qurʾanic “theory of prophethood and salvation” that may be only incompletely or partially
detected elsewhere in the Book. 82 It thus functions in the same way as the clear statement
of a melodic theme does in the context of what might otherwise be challenging or opaque
improvisation and variation. 83 It is here that the reader is given the whole truth about the
prophetic office. It delineates in dramatic form and much detail the basic curve of the life
and career of one chosen by God to carry and relate a special message, a revelation. In read-
ing “the best of stories” one can readily contemplate and understand the life of the Prophet
Muḥammad: his birth, his destined greatness from an early age, his rejection by his relatives,
his love of women, his piety and steadfastness, his ability to reveal the true meaning of
events, his position as wielder of political and social authority, his wisdom, beauty, fairness,
patience, betrayals, the hiddenness of his true greatness until the appointed time, his concern
with “the Hour,” with law, with forgiveness, and, of course, with civilization. 84

Previous discussion of typological figuration in the Qurʾan has concentrated not on the
sura of Joseph, but on the sura of the Poets (al-shuʿarāʾ, Q 26), where it is demonstrated that
the sura actually functions as a catalogue of prophetic types (sg. zawj) and their opposites (in
this case precisely not antagonists, but rather antitypes or reflections of the original type) in
order categorically to identify Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh as one of their number. 85 To be
sure, Michael Zwettler did address the problem of the antagonist or “enemy” of the prophet.
It is not Iblīs or Shayṭān or even the Quraysh, at least not on the literary level. Rather it is
the poet. And here is where we gain another important insight. The Qurʾan is not poetry. But
this is not because it is not “poetic” or artistically compelling. 86 It is because the Prophet
Muḥammad was not a poet. The social function of the poet was utterly different and in many
ways antithetical to the social function of the prophet. The poet was the champion of the
status quo at best, as we are familiar with his pre-Islamic avatar. The prophet was the cham-
pion of change. The poet’s talents were for hire; he was not expected to enunciate a moral

ultimately the future Islam) is rescued by the prophet Moses. This is doubtless part of the contemporary reception of
the sura of Joseph: the audience (i.e., Muḥammad’s audience) is led to see themselves as the heroes of the Abraha-
mic line and the guardians of Islam. As mentioned earlier, typological figuration applies to both the prophetic figures
and their communities. On the importance of Joseph to the identity of Israel, see Kugel 1990, esp. 13–27: “Indeed,
relatively early in the biblical period, the figure of Joseph came to be profoundly affected by political change. . . .
if there nevertheless remained a hope that ‘the Lord, the God of hosts, may be gracious to the remnant of Joseph’
(Amos 5:15), this hope became dimmer and dimmer.” (p. 17) But it did not die.

Joseph’s coffin was carried by Moses and his fellow exiles from Egypt to the Promised Land. But first they had
to find it. On this, see Benin 2000: 32.

of the individual soul is studied in Corbin 1978: 121–31; and generally by Elias 1995.

two directions, see the recent discussion in Stewart 2010.

or ethical code, much less exemplify one; and most importantly, the source of his inspiration
was not God through an angel, rather it was any one of a number of lesser pneumatic beings,
jinn or gods, the acceptance of which entailed the unforgivable sin identified by the Qurʾan
as shirk. By ranging the whole history of monotheistic prophecy against the concerns of the
institution of Arabic poetic culture, the Qurʾan identifies the experience of Muḥammad with
the experience of earlier prophets from Abraham to Jesus. As is well known, so congenial
was such a typological argument that later Islamic tradition posited the existence of 124,000
prophets to account for the whole sweep and progress of earthly human history, even if the
history of humanity has its beginning in a much more mysterious realm. 87

A concise and persuasive example of the centrality of typological figuration may be seen
in the comparison and ultimate identification of Muḥammad’s mission with that of another
prophet, Ṣāliḥ. The journey from history to myth to apocalypse and the return to history
is charted in the typological relationship established between Ṣāliḥ and Thamūd and the
Prophet Muḥammad and his community. Jaroslav Stetkevych has illuminated the way in
which Islam sees Muḥammad’s mission as an identification with and fulfillment of Ṣāliḥ’s
mission in his discovery of the golden bough that was buried in the apocalyptic ruins of
Thamūd. 88 The great apocalyptic scream (ṣayḥa) here represents the totality of the drama
of prophecy and its rejection in one near-synaesthetic gesture. 89 Al-Thaʿlabī’s version of the
cataclysm is instructive:

> There came upon them a scream from heaven, in which there was the sound of every thunderbolt
> and the voice of every thing on earth that has a voice, and it cut through their hearts and breasts,
> and they all perished, young and old. 90

Typology requires symmetry. Symmetry requires duality. Duality is a sine qua non of
typological figuration. By virtue of the compelling symmetry and therefore sacred meaning,
the scream continues to be heard behind the music of every Qurʾanic verse. It is this looming
divine intervention that contributes so much to the electric sense of presence (viz., sakīna) in
an encounter with the Qurʾan. 91

Typological figuration is more powerful than logical argumentation precisely because
its rhetorical verve is felt to derive from some supra-logical region. There is a similarity
between “causality” and “typology.” Both are rhetorically effective. The main difference is
that causality is dependent upon ratiocination, investigation of phenomena, and the “scien-
tific” method. As such it is concerned mainly with the past “on the principle that the past is
all we genuinely or systematically know.” Typology does relate to the future, and the facul-

87. Such beginnings are rooted in the mythopoeic Q 7:172, the day of the covenant or day of alast. The classic
treatment of the motif in Sufism is Böwering 1980. On this central theme, see al-Qāḍī 2006; see also Lawson 2009.

89. ṣayḥa: also ‘shout’ as in ‘battle cry’. Similar Qurʾanic words, such as nidāʾ ‘voice’, ‘call’, also afford mes-
sianic and apocalyptic resonances in both the Qurʾan and exegesis. For the Shiʿi messianic understanding of the
same scream, see Madelung 1978.

29:40; 36:29, 49, 53; 38:15; 50:42; 54:31; 63:4. See Klar 2009. Al-Thaʿlabī’s role as a seminal figure in the history
of tafsīr has recently been elucidated and convincingly argued by Saleh 2004.

91. Such compelling literary “moments” are not, of course, restricted to the Qurʾan. Recall the “Qurʾanic ambi-
ance” in the opening lines of Gerard Manley Hopkins “God’s Grandeur”:

> The World is charged with the grandeur of God.
> It will flame out, like shining from shook foil;
> It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil
> Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod?
See A. H. Johns 1993: 43 for an earlier comparison of the work of Gerard Manley Hopkins with the Qurʾan.

ties by which it is enlivened are “faith, hope, and vision.” Logical, causal thinking functions
in one “tense” whereas typological thinking assumes a future, and can even transcend time
itself. Typological thinking bespeaks a desire to awaken from the “nightmare of history” and
is “essentially a revolutionary form of thought and rhetoric.” 92

The shirt of Joseph is an especially apt emblem of typological figuration. The typological
weaving, generation, and embellishment of this unique textile (< text, credential, revelation,
information) narreme (a word not admitted to the OED) is a distinctively Islamic process,
fascinating to trace throughout the exegetic literature. 93 In a sense, all fabrics are related,
either positively or negatively, to the shirt of Joseph. That is, it may be seen to represent
“fabric” itself, a metonym for culture, civilization, the cross-connected lines of the various
fates of humans and human fate as such. 94 As a fabric it is related to all clothing, including
veils, and as such is capable of concealing and revealing, frequently at the same time. This
suggests the mystical process of iltibās or amphiboly that Corbin analyzed in the writings
of Rūzbihān Baqlī. 95 The shirt is also a symbol or emblem of the passage of time and nar-
rative development and by association all narrative continuity. It is a bearer of the heavenly
scent of Joseph and all prophets, because of its intimate relationship (viz., walāya) to both
the prophets and its point of origin, God. Like walāya itself, a category explicitly mentioned
in Q 12:101 and obliquely alluded to in Q 12:84, it protects, distinguishes, comforts, and
identifies its bearers and those who participate in (affirm) their walāya. 96 That the shirt is
one symbol for all salvation history—Heilsgeschichte 97—is also suggested by the fact that it
only occurs in the sura of Joseph and that this sura, based on features of its form and content
discussed above, may be seen as a kind of Qurʾan “in miniature.” 98 That is to say, if the shirt
is the centerpiece of the sura, and the sura itself is the centerpiece of the Qurʾan with regard
to narrative art and coherence, then its primacy is compelling. This would appear to be one
of the points of traditional exegesis, whether Sunni or Shiʿi. In this vast body of literature,
there is a clear consensus that Joseph’s shirt is one of those “divine artifacts” or “evidences”
that come from the unseen realm. 99 This is in addition to the striking way in which its own

93. “Narreme” is a technical term in the relatively recent science known as “narratology.” It is defined as a
selfstanding unit of a narrative composition on the model of “morpheme” or “mytheme.” For a narrative approach
to the Qurʾanic story of Joseph, see Gasmi 1977 and 1986.

94. That the woven fabric represents a “manifestation” of the coincidence of opposites (warp ≠ woof) may also
be of interest.

95. Corbin 1971, vol. 3, index (ibid., vol. 4), s.v. “amphibolie, iltibās.” A cognate perspective is found in
­William Blake as discussed by Frye 1969: 381–82:

> This is the power of seeing the physical appearance as the covering of the mental reality, yet not conceal-
> ing its shape so much as revealing it in a fallen aspect and so not the clothing but the body or form of the
> mental world, though a physical and therefore a fallen body or form. If we try to visualize this develop-
> ment of the “clothing” symbol, we get something more like a mirror, a surface which reveals reality in
> fewer dimensions than it actually has.
96. While it may reasonably be questioned whether such a subtle occurrence of the root w-l-y here in Q 12:84

can be so significant, it should be remembered that in Shiʿi tafsīr such otherwise apparently “weak” occasions may
serve the exegete in surprising ways. This has been amply demonstrated in Lawson 2004: 163­–97.

97. When used to speak about Islam, Heilsgeschichte must always be understood to emphasize the entering of
the divinity or holiness into actual history through the agency of prophecy. Thus it may also be translated as “divine
history,” which in some ways may actually be closer to the German, where “salvation” is actually Erlösung.

specific narrative structure, brilliantly explicated by Mustansir Mir, offers numerous clues for
the way in which the Qurʾan itself may be read, thus cracking another code.

The symbol of the cloak may be seen to have developed out of the ancient practice of holy
men and diviners, who kept the “exterior world at a distance” by wearing a special robe. 100
In Shiʿi works reference is often made to “the people of the cloak” (ahl al-kisāʾ), who are
specified as Muḥammad, ʿAlī, Fāṭima, Ḥasan, and Ḥusayn. 101 Whether Twelver or Sevener,
Shiʿi writers use this designation to express the idea that Muḥammad’s special qualities
were transmitted to his progeny through contact with his mantle. Corbin called attention to
the powerful role of exegetical typological figuration in the early consolidation and identity
building of Twelver Shiʿism. He pointed out that it represents a major moment when the
famous scene of the mubāhala is typologically identified in the Tafsīr ascribed to al-Ḥasan
al-ʿAskarī with the annunciation of Jesus:

> The vastness of theological meaning found in this scene by Shiite meditation may be measured
> by the fact that the tafsīr attributed to Imām Ḥasan ʿAskarī, the eleventh Imām of the Duo-
> deciman Shiites, expressly establishes a typological relation between the Koranic verses [esp. Q
> 33:33, see also Q 53:3–4 and 81:19–29] evoking the Annunciation and the conjunction of the
> Holy Spirit with Jesus, and this scene in which Gabriel the Holy Spirit joins the five hypostases
> of the original Imāmate. It is precisely here that Shiism inaugurates the transition from Angel
> Christology to Imāmology. 102

The word qamīṣ appears in the Qurʾan only in sura 12, where it is mentioned six times.

First at 12:18, where Joseph’s brothers are described as having put false blood on his shirt
in an attempt to deceive Jacob, claiming that a wolf had eaten their brother. At 12:25–28
the qamīṣ figures prominently in the well-known episode with Zulaykha, Potiphar’s wife,
where the guilt or innocence of Joseph is determined by whether the shirt is torn at the front
or the back. 103 An interesting comment on this scene occurs in the tafsīr of the Sufi Sahl
al-Tustarī (d. 283/896). The entire ordeal has as its purpose a demonstration of the efficacy of
divine “proof” (burhān) without which Joseph would have been abandoned to his “defeated”
(maghlūb) condition because “he had permitted the desire for Potiphar’s wife to rise in his
lower self.” 104 In the context of the entire narrative, such “defeat” is dramatically contrasted
with Joseph’s eventual role of powerful minister, which he wins as a result of properly
interpreting the Pharaoh’s dream. Indeed, so important is this ultimate rise to power and vic-
tory—which in the event must also include victory over the self as well as over the perfidious

cerned, there is no disagreement across sectarian boundaries.

al-kisāʾ al-yamānī). Here, Ḥasan and other members of the ahl al-bayt exclaim in turn upon entering Fāṭima’s
house, “I detect something like the fragrance of my grandfather.” The spiritual reality of the cloak and the physical
reality of the Prophet have become one. My thanks to Arsheen Devji for drawing my attention to this important

interesting comment is made to the effect that the “front” and “back” of the shirt refer to exoteric and esoteric knowl-
edge respectively (p. 144). The qamīṣ in verse Q 12:93 is seen as representing imāma (p. 163). See al-Nuʿmān 2008.

brothers—that the key phrase is repeated in this sura: “Thus did we empower Joseph over the
land,” wa-kadhālika makkannā li-Yūsuf fī l-arḍ (Q 12:21, 56). 105

Finally, for the present discussion the most important mention comes at Q 12:93. Joseph’s
brothers have finally recognized him as a highly placed official in Egypt, whereupon Joseph
instructs them: “Go, take this my shirt, and cast it on my father’s face, and he shall recover
his sight; then bring me your family altogether.” When Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq was asked about the
shirt of Joseph, he responded that when Abraham was burning in the fire (Q 21:68–69),
Gabriel came down with the shirt and clothed him with it so that he would not be harmed.
Abraham gave this shirt to Isaac, who gave it to Jacob. When Joseph was born, Jacob gave
the shirt to him. It was this shirt, originally sent from heaven, by which Jacob detected the
scent of Joseph (Q 12:93). 106 Al-Ṣādiq was then asked what became of this shirt, to which
he responded that the shirt stayed with the descendants of Joseph and is now in the posses-
sion of “our Qāʾim” because all the prophets inherit knowledge and other things from one
another. 107

The author of the encyclopedic Akhbarī Shiʿi lexicon Mirʾāt al-anwār says of qamīṣ that
its exoteric meaning is well known, but that its taʾwīl is connected with the words thiyāb
and libās. 108 The first word is defined as representing the knowledge with which the imams
have been endowed, and by extension refers to walāya proper. 109 The second word carries
a complex of meanings that include, together with the idea of garment, “deception.” 110 For
the former, al-ʿĀmilī-Iṣfahānī refers to several verses in the Qurʾan, among which is 2:187,
where it is stated that spouses are as a garment to each other. For the latter, he cites Q 2:42
in which those who disguise the truth with falsehood are condemned. Ultimately, however,
the word libās is seen as a symbol of the walāya of the imams. 111

In his commentary on al-Qaṣīda al-lāmiyya, Sayyid Kāẓim Rashtī (d. 1843–44) takes
the opportunity to dilate on the implications of the word qamīṣ, which occurs in one of its
verses. 112 The poet has compared the curtain (satr) of the tomb of the Prophet with the qamīṣ
of Joseph, stressing that the spiritual “fragrance” of the former is far greater than that of the
latter. 113 Rashtī says that however powerful the fragrance of the shirt of Joseph might have

105. The same phrase occurs one other time, in Q 18:84, where it is used to describe how God gave “security
throughout the land” to Dhū l-Qarnayn, frequently identified with Alexander the Great in tafsīr.

106. Sufi literature on the initiatory khirqa speaks of its heavenly origin also, and mentions the qamīṣ of Joseph
(with which the khirqa is compared) as that which protected Abraham from the fire. Al-Suhrawardī 1965: 95–102.

shirt of Joseph will be on him, and he will have the staff of Moses and the ring of Solomon.” The heavenly origin
of this shirt was also taught by the early exegete al-Kalbī (d. 150/767) in what Wansbrough (1977: 134) termed “a
reflex of Rabbinic descriptions” of the robe in Genesis.

Q 6:72 (“those who do not clothe their faith in darkness”), and says that this refers to those who did not confuse
the walāya with the walāya of “so-and-so and so-and-so.” It might be asked whether fulān wa-fulān is an editorial
substitution for more derogatory appellations in reference to the first three caliphs of Sunni Islam, such as those
found in Kohlberg and Amir-Moezzi 2009: e.g., 161.

113. The fascinating relationship—typological and otherwise—between the celebrated mantle or burda of the
Prophet Muḥammad is, unfortunately, not pursued here due to lack of space. See the recent magisterial study of the
poetry in S. P. Stetkevych 2010, where Joseph (but not his shirt) appears on pp. 96, 130, 172.

been, it cannot compare with the much stronger power of the curtain of the Prophet’s mau-
soleum. Interestingly, the power of the shirt comes from Joseph’s having worn it, rather than
from the heavenly origin of the shirt. Jacob could detect its perfume from a great distance,
because both he and Joseph were a “single aspect” of the “seal of the prophets” (lamā kāna
Yaʿqūb wa-Yūsuf ʿalayhumā al-salām wajhan min wujūḥ khātam al-anbiyāʾ). Presumably
this means that Jacob could detect his son’s presence precisely because he also was a bearer
of walāya and therefore in reality they were one and the same. Since Joseph’s shirt acquired
its “fragrance” (i.e., power) from physical contact, the “fragrance” acquired from physical
closeness to the Prophet’s tomb must be even stronger. Therefore, while it was the power of
the fragrance of the shirt of Joseph that caused Jacob’s physical sight to be restored, the per-
fume of his “shirt” (i.e., the satr of the tomb) is incomparably stronger and will give spiritual
sight to those who regard it with the “eye of reality.” 114

In an interesting, if marginalized, literary gesture in Tafsīr sūrat Yūsuf by ʿAlī Muḥammad
Shīrāzī (d. 1850), known to history as the Bāb, it is argued that the qamīṣ of Joseph represents
a power equivalent to the satr of the tomb of the Prophet. The symbol of the shirt of Joseph is
immediately associated with the bees mentioned in Qurʾan 16 (sūrat al-naḥl), which reflects
an early Shiʿi identification of these bees with the imams, for just as the bees produce honey
“in which there is a healing for mankind” so the imams dispense healing knowledge. 115 Such
an apparently incongruous and abrupt association of the bees with Joseph’s shirt is quite typi-
cal of the Bāb’s method throughout this commentary. The Bāb seems to take the bees out of
thin air. This air is actually the exceedingly rich atmosphere of the Shiʿi exegetical tradition.

conclusion
The story of Joseph has a special place in Islam and in the Qurʾan. It may be offered
that while Abraham and/or Moses have frequently been considered the ideal exemplar for
Muḥammadan prophecy, 116 a study of the shirt of Joseph suggests that this qamīṣ may have
also served as a veil for another possibility. It is actually Joseph who represents a truer type—
or at least a more complete type—for the Prophet, whether among Sunni exegetes or Shiʿi. In
this amplitude of Qurʾanic detail and narrative there is rhetorical power.

There is a special attraction in Shiʿism for the story of Joseph, but it is central to Islamic
religion for a number of reasons. The qamīṣ of Joseph is an efficient emblem of the Islami-
cate notions of prophethood, revelation, and walāya because it bears their scent, a scent that
is at once complex and unmistakably borne upon the shirt, or cloak, that both reveals and
conceals. In poetry, the shirt of Joseph is equated with the “Muḥammad (centifolia) rose,”
recognized as having the most complex perfume of any of the roses. The Tafsīr sūrat Yūsuf
ascribed to al-Ghazālī lists seven different types of scent borne upon the qamīṣ of Joseph. 117
Furthermore, because of its function as a marker of narrative progression in the sura of
Joseph, it is also a symbol of historical continuity-within-change, eschatological hope and
order in the face of chaos. This scent carries all of the information we have been given in
the sura and in the Tales of the Prophets, in addition to summoning up the remembrance of
the primordial covenant, a reunion of all of those “children of Adam” (humanity) who before
time joined in their assent to the sovereignty of God. Perfume is the perfect conveyor of this

experience because it manages to communicate simultaneously both absence and presence, a
powerful coincidence of opposites and one that distinguishes itself among all other sensory
experiences because of the way it conjures the past, making it one with the present, and giv-
ing the experience of an obliteration of distance between the subject and the object. 118

While the focus here on Shiʿi and Bābī texts may raise questions as to the applicability
of minoritarian views to an overall picture, it should be recalled that in all cases the point
of departure has been the Qurʾan. Joseph is no less or no more a symbol of the Beloved in
any of these intellectual or pietistic traditions than he was, say, for Avicenna. 119 It is not
the business of the scholar to adjudicate claims of self-identifying Muslims. By offering a
wide spectrum of Muslim, or if preferred, Islamicate, interpretation, a fuller picture of Islam
emerges. 120 By mining these frequently marginalized sources it is hoped to shed light on
heretofore unsuspected or insufficiently understood and emphasized features of the Islamic
tradition, including the importance of typological figuration as a distinctively Islamic mode
of iconic spiritual encounter and contemplation. 121
