Will Globalization Lead to a World
Commonwealth?
SOHRAB ABIZADEH

Abstract
This paper draws from modern economic theory, the recent surge of interest in
globalization, stronger global interconnectedness, and expanded cooperation
among nation states to discuss their impact on world governance. It attempts to
explain how emerging international crises, such as global epidemics, when com-
bined with the fundamental principles of unity and social justice prescribed in the
writings of the Bahá’í Faith, are impelling the world toward the formation of a
world commonwealth.

Le présent article fait fond sur la théorie moderne de l’économie, la nouvelle vague
d’intérêt à l’égard de la mondialisation, l’interdépendance grandissante à l’échelle
planétaire et l’élargissement de la coopération entre les États nations pour en
examiner l’impact sur la gouvernance mondiale. L’auteur tente d’expliquer com-
ment les nouvelles crises internationales, telles que les pandémies, alliées aux
principes fondamentaux d’unité et de justice sociale promulgués dans les Écrits
bahá’ís, poussent le monde ve rs l’établissement d’un commonwealth mondial.

INTRODUCTION

Much has been written about the Bahá’í principles and their implications
for spiritual and social issues,1 but few scholarly works exist that correlate
modern economic theories to the core principles of Bahá’u’lláh’s “New
World Order” and their implications for world governance.2 Economic
theories of externalities, public goods, market failure, and globalization
have much to offer in understanding the shortcomings of nation-states in
the pursuit of social and economic objectives. Bahá’í principles such as the
elimination of extremes of wealth and poverty and work as a form of wor-
ship, directly or indirectly, influence both economic and social issues that
are universal by nature.

Economic theory has focused on the market as an institution for accom-
modating exchanges between individuals and business firms. It argues
that in a perfect market system, as assumed in neoclassical economic the-
ory, economic agents (individuals and business firms) will try to maximize
their satisfaction or profit. However, markets are far from perfect and fail
to simultaneously ensure the maximization of individual satisfaction and
business profit, thus, at times resulting in the inefficient allocation of
resources. Markets fail to deal with externalities of different kinds such as
pollution. They also fail to facilitate the production and provision of pub-
lic goods. In addition, markets also fail to ensure the equitable distribution
of wealth. The economic literature has used these market failures to justi-
fy the existence, authority, and economic role of the state, whose mandates
include, among other things, acting on behalf of its citizens to maintain
law and order, correcting for market failures, and solving a variety of
social and economic problems.

Nation-states often fail to deliver all that is expected of them. These
failures are due to structural problems within governments, rent seeking,3
and the inability of national administrators to satisfactorily resolve eco-
nomic and social problems which cross national boundaries. Such issues
include environmental and “international public goods” phenomena. The
task of governments is further complicated by the surge in globalization
spurred by innovations in communications, unprecedented technological
progress, and the rapid flow of information, all of which have created a

Globalization and World Commonwealth                      43

more interdependent world community. It is in light of such interdepen-
dence among nation-states that we are witnessing extensive movements
toward the formation of economic and political blocs and unions, a wel-
come trend in the direction of the international commonwealth foreseen
in the Bahá’í Writings.

In this paper, I focus on the Bahá’í principle known as the oneness of the
world of humanity, recognition of which constitutes the fundamental pre-
requisite “for the establishment of a world commonwealth in which all
nations, races, creeds and classes are closely and permanently united, . . . ”
(Shoghi Effendi, World Order of Bahá’u’lláh 203).

My objective is to show that the existing institutions of the market and
the nation-state fail to help societies achieve their dual aims of fostering
economic prosperity and social justice. This failure has initiated a search
for alternative arrangements between nations, leading to a surge in glob-
al cooperation and a move toward world government. First, I will exam-
ine the established arguments to the effect that

• nation-states and national economies must have two institutions:

markets and government in order to function efficiently;
• markets alone fail to reach some of their assigned economic and

social goals;
• government action is needed to correct market failures and to pro-

vide public goods;
• governments may also fail to ensure that the economic and social

> needs of their citizens are met, that social justice is promoted and
> preserved, and, more important, that all the benefits and costs of
> their actions are internalized within their borders.

Second, building upon these established theories, I will argue that

• under current world conditions, elements such as freer trade, glob-

> alization of production, advances in systems of communication,
> and unprecedented innovations in technology are leading to both
> political and economic interconnectedness of nations;
44            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 15. 1/4. 2005

• international cooperation is a means of addressing some of the

> p r o blems associated with government failure, particularly as
> regards international public goods, the free-rider issue, and other
> international social problems;
• globalization will lead to further integration of the world commu-

> nity and could provide a base for the formation of some kind of
> international governing body capable of solving the problems
> associated with markets, nation-states, and international public
> goods.

ECONOMIC GOALS AND INSTITUTIONS

Economics is aimed at satisfying the wants of consumer groups and indi-
viduals by efficiently utilizing the limited resources of nature. Economic
theory is unidimensional in that it often ignores the ethical and psycho-
logical dimensions of life cherished by civil societies. Market-based eco-
nomics is individualistic, and thus does not fully incorporate in its theo-
ries the effects of policies and practices on people as social beings. Each
person’s action, knowingly or otherwise, can affect other persons and thus,
by implication, the society as a whole. Modern neoclassical economic the-
ory operates on the assumption that perfect competition is an important
operational requirement for an efficient market. The Bahá’í view of the
market modifies this by incorporating moral, ethical, and social values.4

Both economics and the Bahá’í Faith have recognized that for a society
to function there must be order. This is achieved through the functioning
of two distinct but interrelated institutions: the market, which organizes
most of our economic activities, based on individual decision-making
processes, and government, which manages many of society’s activities,
based on collective and communal process of decision making. Historical
experience suggests that both are required.

How tasks are divided between these two institutions in the pursuit of
personal and social goals is a matter of ideology and societal preference,
depending on how individualistic or communally based a society wishes to
be. Every nation relies upon both market and government involvement,

Globalization and World Commonwealth                      45

with differing degrees of importance assigned to each in maximizing hap-
piness and well-being. The Bahá’í Faith recognizes the significance of
both, and emphasizes the importance of the right balance between them
when it comes to dealing with economic and social issues.

THE ROLES OF MARKET AND GOVERNMENT

To correlate the two institutions of market and government in the exist-
ing economic order with the Bahá’í view of world order, it is necessary to
briefly review how they operate in the context of the nation-state, and
identify evident shortcomings.

The Market
Markets bring together buyers and sellers of products, factors of produc-
tion, and financial assets. They are exchange mechanisms which facilitate
transactions between buyers and sellers and, if efficient, allocate resources
to their best economic use. They do so based purely on the economic
motives of different economic agents (individuals, business firms, or cor-
porations). Each is interested in maximizing its own utility (as individu-
als) or profit (as business firms or corporations). Under Adam Smith’s
“invisible hand” argument, a society based on such maximization behavior
on the part of its participants will automatically optimize, that is, maxi-
mize its material well-being. The logic is that the choices people make will
tend toward the best possible trade-off. In other words, it is supposed that
the resources available to a society will be used efficiently, and lead to
maximum output. However, as discussed below, this simplistic economic
argument fails to hold up, given that individual economic agents, as part
of a social fabric, both affect, and are affected by, other agents.

One of the fundamental reasons advanced for the legitimacy of the
market is human nature itself, and relates to individuals’ varied taste and
p r e ferences. These variations lead to the desire for exchange, central to
the foundation of a market. If one is not completely satisfied with one’s
original endowments—natural or acquired—one will engage in exchange
in order to enhance his/her satisfaction, in economic jargon, to “maximize

46             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 15. 1/4. 2005

their utility.” The market is there to facilitate such an exchange. Exchange
requires respect for property rights, since, without them, there is chaos.
For exchange to be meaningful, society must be ordered. Safeguarding
property rights is a prerequisite for such order.

Except under special circumstances—in which transaction costs are
very low and agents have rather similar endowments—markets them-
selves are incapable of establishing and enforcing property rights.
Therefore, governments are agents, whose role includes, among other
things, establishing law and order, enforcing property rights, and facili-
tating exchanges between interested parties. This creates a natural link
between the market and the government as two institutions working
together for the proper functioning of the economy and society. As
Anderson puts it, “Markets are not natural phenomena: rather, they
depend on government for their existence” (19). Governments are there
to correct for all kinds of market failure.

Market Imperfections and Market Failures
In neoclassical economics, markets are assumed to be “perfect.” However,
for a market to be perfect, certain restrictive assumptions must hold. First,
all business firms and consumers in an industry must be price-takers; that
is, prices are determined by the market, since the size of each firm’s out-
put and each individual’s demand in a perfectly competitive industry is too
small relative to the size of the industry as a whole to have any impact on
the price of the product in question. Second, all the firms in the industry
sell identical products; that is, every unit of the product is identical to
every other unit in the eye of the consumer. Third, information is perfect;
that is, customers know the exact nature of the products and the prices
charged by each firm. Finally, there is a freedom of entry into and exit
from the industry, and the cost of these actions is minimal to the firm.

In practice, however, many of these assumptions are violated, leading to
market “imperfections.” These imperfections manifest themselves in the
inability of the market to allocate resources efficiently, or to help societies
achieve, among other things, the ultimate social goals of prosperity, well-
being, and social justice. As a result, markets are not only imperfect but

Globalization and World Commonwealth                       47

fail to automatically lead the economy to efficient solutions.5 That is to
say, markets are incapable of achieving all the individual and social goals
simultaneously.

The causes of market imperfection go well beyond these assumptions.

The market fails to incorporate in its operational model some of the val-
ues that are important to individual citizens, including those related to
equity, social justice, and the environment.

Failure to take proper advantage of economies of scale6 prevailing in an
industry is another reason the market may become inefficient. A good
example is public utilities. By benefiting from economies of scale, one sin-
gle firm can supply the output of the entire industry, leading to a monop-
oly. Unless owned and operated by the government, the price charged by
the company holding such a monopoly will not reflect the optimal value
to society, resulting in a misallocation of resources, market imperfection,
and inefficiencies.

In addition to the above-mentioned imperfections in the markets, exter-
nalities of different kinds can result in market failures. Externalities take
one of two forms: technical and public goods.7 A technical externality is
said to be present when actions by individual economic agents (consumers
or producers) affect others (positively or negatively) without compensat-
ing the affected party for the costs or benefits incurred by the acting party.
For example, a chemical factory that discharges waste in a river imposes
a cost on the fishermen who use it, without taking their cost into account.
Similarly, when someone plants flowers in her garden, the neighbors will
enjoy the view without being asked to pay for such “benefits.” If these
costs and benefits are not reflected in the market and thus prices, then the
market fails to lead the economy to efficiency. The traditional view is that
if the markets were perfect, these costs and benefits would be manifest in
the price mechanism, and would be reflected in the market transactions
associated with those activities. Likewise, when a benefit or cost is exclud-
ed from market prices, markets receive the wrong price signals and end up
misallocating resources.

Coase argued that when externalities exist the optimum level of output
can only be achieved if property rights are clearly defined and honored.

48            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 15. 1/4. 2005

Thus, governments are responsible for enacting laws that will lead to the
proper definition and protection of property rights.

Street lights are an excellent example of the second type, known as a
“public good” externality. Once they are turned on, every one benefits
from them. It is impractical to charge a price for street lights, because no
one can be excluded from their use. Moreover, once such a product or pub-
lic good is provided, the additional resource cost of another person con-
suming it is zero. It is thus neither efficient nor practical to ration con-
sumption of a public good by charging a price for it. Since the availability
of public goods adds to the well-being of society, the market’s inability to
provide them translates into a “failure.”

The breadth and extent of the above-mentioned issues point to a deep-
er problem facing the market, namely, its exclusive reliance on the self-
interest of its actors. According to Rassekh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá “rejects the
proposition that the pursuit of individual private interest necessarily pro-
motes the public interest” (47). “The Bahá’í Faith teaches that individuals’
actions be governed by ‘the common good’ and by what ‘profiteth
mankind’” (50). One such aspect of the common good relates to the erad-
ication of extremes of poverty and wealth as envisioned in the Bahá’í
Writings. Indeed, left to themselves, the actions of individuals do not
automatically lead to collective well-being, and without controls or man-
agement, a free market economy can lead to a widening gap between poor
and rich. Therefore, the central authorities have the moral responsibility
to correct for an unjust distribution caused by the market. While empha-
sizing the importance of the market economy in leading economies to
higher levels of material well-being, Shoghi Effendi recognized the short-
comings of the market and proposed that there be a critical balance
between the free market and socialism:

> Complete socialization is not only impossible but most unjust, and in
> this the Cause is in fundamental disagreement with the extreme
> socialists or communists. It cannot also agree with the other extreme
> tendency represented by the “Laissez-faire” or individualistic school of
economics which became very popular in the late eighteenth century,

Globalization and World Commonwealth                       49

> by the so-called democratic countries. For absolute freedom, even in
> the economic sphere, leads to confusion and corruption, and acts not
> only to the detriment of the state, or the collectivity, but inev i t ably
> results in the end in jeopardizing the very interests of the individual
> himself. . . . The Cause can and indeed will in the future maintain the
> right balance between the two tendencies of individualism and collec-
> tivism, not only in the field of economics, but in all other social
> domains.8

On the basis of his research in the Bahá’í literature, Sabetan argues that
the current economic system is inadequate and unable to lead the global
community to the desired level of prosperity, due to the absence of ethical
principles in market-based systems. As a social science, economics, he says,
must not only incorporate ethical and moral dimensions into its opera-
tional models, but also take into consideration our social interactions, and
the implications of these interactions on our own and others’ well-being.
If we accept these views, then the ultimate goal of economics and the mar-
kets will take a new form. Rather than aiming to meet only material needs
and wants, optimization should focus on maximizing the potential for
human happiness as well.

Given the existence of market inefficiencies in general and externalities
in part i c u l a r, and given the fact that market systems function on the uni-
dimensional premise of individualism, economic theory does recognize
that markets are not perfect and cannot ensure efficient allocation of
resources on their own. In fact, economists also use the evidence of market
failure to justify the very existence of government, which not only estab-
lishes the order necessary for the proper operation of the market in the
f i rst place, but also replaces the market when it fails to function properly.

Markets in and of themselves are incapable of dealing with many press-
ing social issues, including the application of moral values and principles
of social justice, and cannot lead nations to prosperity. Therefore, as pro-
posed and practiced in the Bahá’í community, there needs to be a well-
designed administrative system, parallel to the market, in order for soci-
ety to realize its full potential.

Government and Its Roles
Democratic governments make decisions based on the three foundations of
governance: administrative structure, parliament, and judiciary. Decisions
of government, made on behalf of society at large, are broadly based and
influence many aspects of the political, economic, social, cultural, and reli-
gious life of the citizens.

Historically, governments were expected to establish law and order, pro-
duce and provide public goods, redistribute income using a tax-transfer
mechanism, and ensure price stability in the market. Now, however, based
on the theory of externalities and market failure, additional roles are
assigned to government. Musgrave distinguishes among four “pairings of
state and fiscal theory,” three of which relate to the role of government.9
The first role is the “service state,” in which the state is said merely to
“repair certain leaks in the efficient functioning of the market as provider
of goods and to do so in a way which stimulates what would have been a
market solution” (247). Thus, correcting for, or “internalizing,” externali-
ties becomes one of the economic roles of government.10 This is done
through policy instruments, such as taxation and government expendi-
ture, or by legislation and regulation. A government may impose taxes on
those activities which cause external costs, such as pollution, and subsidize
those which create external benefits, such as charities or public health.

The second role is the “welfare state” which “seeks to correct the market-
determined distribution of income and wealth, moving it towards what
society views as efficient or fair” (Musgrave 247). This amounts to incor-
porating social justice into government policy objectives and rectifying
possible inequities caused by the market system.

The third role is related to the “communal state” in which “the state is
no longer a mere handmaiden to overcome externalities or to add to dis-
tributional adjustments, made in line with the private preferences of its
members” (Musgrave 252). Instead, “Policy goals are now set by the
state’s own needs or, put more moderately, by the public (as distinct from
private) needs of its members” (247). Here, the government is regarded as
an institution made up of bureaucrats and politicians with their unique
and, at times, diverse, and often conflicting preferences.

In addition to attempting to assist in the delivery of perfect market
information and internalizing externalities, modern governments may
also act to encourage competition and prevent monopolies from gaining
excessive control over the market. According to Stiglitz, “[G]overnment
policies to increase competition—both structural policies that inhibit
competition-reducing mergers and policies aimed at reducing restrictive
and collusive practices—not only strengthen the efficiency and innova-
tiveness of the economy but ensure that benefits are passed on to con-
sumers in the form of lower prices” (25). In other words, a new role for
government is to act as a regulator of the economy.

Thus, government functions by providing regulation, facilitating the
flow of information, providing (and sometimes producing) public goods,
attempting to improve equity, and maintaining law and order, thus ensur-
ing that property rights are respected. Such tasks expected of the gov-
ernment are designed to promote social justice while facilitating the
smooth operation of the market.

Government Imperfections and Government Failures
No one expects governments to be perfect. Government is not a single
benevolent planner but a huge organization made up of often self-inter-
ested individuals, many of whom are likely to put their own well-being
ahead of service to their fellow citizens. Because of this and other argu-
ments presented below, governments have their share of failures.

Much of the literature about gove rnment failure focuses on gove rn-
ment inefficiency and rent seeking.11 Many scholarly articles deal with
the failure of government to achieve desired outcomes for the economy
and society.12 These relate to government actions that affect aggregate
economic variables such as the Gross Domestic Product, the distribution
of income and wealth, and the efficiency-seeking policies of government.

Governments may fail because they do not operate on an ethical fo u n-
dation or because of the rent seeking of bu r e a u c rats and politicians. That
is, the agency created to promote a common goal may become hostage to
the goals of those who are employed in it, a phenomenon known as
“ bu r e a u c ratic capture. ” Often, the state will fail to pursue appropriate

52             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 15. 1/4. 2005

policies geared toward social justice and the equitable distribution of
wealth, a task that was one of the main reasons for justifying government
economic roles in the first place. Recent statistical info rmation shows
that the gap between low-income and high-income individuals has been
widening during the past decades in such highly developed countries as
Canada (Yalnizian). At the same time we have witnessed a widening gap
between rich and poor nations (Sheehey).

In addition to the possibility of failure in dealing with social justice issues,
government may not be able to deal with the many externalities that led to
market failure, which in part justified the government’s role in the economy.
Beyond these problems, international public goods and interjurisdictional
spillover can severely hamper national governments’ efficient operation.

If the very bureaucratic organization created to regulate an industry
ends up serving its interests, then government fails to control monopolies.
Indeed, nation-states may end up encouraging rather than discouraging
local monopolies within their borders, particularly if a firm is already, or
has the potential of becoming, multinational. Governments may fear that,
by limiting the power of local monopolies, they may weaken their com-
petitiveness in international markets. Recent experience shows the
unwillingness of governments to take the task of controlling monopolies
seriously. It was easier for the United States government to break up
AT&T in the 1960s than Microsoft during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

In the case of technical externalities, it is a well-known fact that exter-
nal costs and benefits can easily spill over the artificial borders of the
country in question, rendering the task of internalizing such externalities
by the national government very difficult. For example, witness the exter-
nal cost of acid rain created by the heavy industries in the northern
United States when they are carried into another country, in this case,
Canada. Clearly, the government of the United States will be reluctant to
undertake any remedial actions on its own in this regard, first, because the
costs may be too high, and second, because Canada will become a free
rider and benefit tremendously from the U.S. action, without sharing the
cost of controlling acid rain. In this case, neither the United States nor the
Canadian government will act on their own and, in the absence of cross-

border cooperation, no action will be taken. This will lead to the failure on
the part of both governments to deal with a technical externality.

Furthermore, governments are often not well equipped to deal with
some aspects of market failure, such as transborder and transnational
externalities. There are some products—similar to public goods—whose
benefits and cost extend beyond the borders of a particular country. For
example, marine resources: when two countries share common borders,
one country’s overfishing can have devastating economic and environ-
mental effects on the other country. Here again we experience a spillover
of costs from one country to another, making the culprit country a free
rider. These spillover effects give rise to a phenomenon called interna-
tional public good externalities.

Another area in which nation-states experience grave difficulties is the
recent surge in international, or at times government-sponsored, terror-
ism. The enormous economic costs, and more importantly the loss of
innocent lives that the victimized nations have suffered since September
2001 have been caused by a group of individuals (at times fully supported
by a government) who, by committing the act of terror, are pursuing their
own self-interest. The costs associated with these acts have clear interna-
tional implications. Even if terrorism is directed towards one nation, the
damage is widespread and crosses many borders. No single nation-state is
capable of combating such a rash of terror on its own. Combating terror-
ism as a collaborative effort between nations would bring about wide-
spread benefits to both collaborating and other nations—a good example
of an international public good externality.13

Nation-states may suffer from what is commonly referred to as the
brain drain. It has become commonplace for usually less deve l o p e d
countries to spend millions of dollars educating their citizens only to see
them emigrate, usually to a more developed country, to further their
education. Some of these educated people may then decide to remain in
the new country to work and, ultimately, live. In this case, although the
majority of their education costs have been shouldered by the less deve l-
oped country, it is the more developed country which reaps the benefits.
The brain drain may seriously undermine the incentive of some less-

54            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 15. 1/4. 2005

d eveloped countries to maintain their investment in education and may
result in the misallocation of resources, thus failing to help their
economies reach gr e ater levels of efficiency and realize their potential.
In the absence of artificial divisions in nation-states, such inefficiencies
will disappear.

Famine in an African country or an outbreak of a contagious disease
such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China can result in
suffering, death, and devastation with consequences that go far beyond the
borders of the country of origin. Such issues require international coop-
eration, in part because the affected countries may not be willing or may
not have the resources to deal with them on their own. This lack of will-
ingness or ability constitutes another form of government inefficiency in
trying to resolve an internal problem and reach their goal of optimization
at the same time.

Recognition of these problems, particularly those related to the notion
of international public goods, has led nations to engage in negotiations
with each other, in the hope of resolving some of their border-related
issues, and thus move toward improving the collective well-being of all
the parties involved.14 Canada and the United States have been involved
in continuous negotiations over the acid rain issue, with the goal of con-
trolling pollution jointly and ensuring that both countries share the cost
of pollution control. Witness the establishment of the International Joint
Commission between Canada and the United States Water Quality
Agreement signed by the U.S. and Canada in 1978.

Clearly, pollution is a universal problem and requires more than two
nations to address it. The establishment of the United Nations Environ-
ment Programme, the signing of regional agreements such as Western
Mediterranean Sea Project and others for the great European rivers,
acceptance of the Montreal Convention on compensation to victims of air
disasters, or the Kyoto Accord on ozone depletion, to name only a very
few, indicate how far nations have come in dealing with common issues.

When famine, epidemic, or nat u ral disaster strikes in one part of the
world, the international community, either through joint United Nations
action, or as independent nations, is often able to come to the rescue.

Outbreaks of c o m m u n i c able diseases such as smallpox and tuberculosis,
the most recent outbreak of avian flu, or demands imposed by the Asian
tsunami disaster of l ate 2004 are examples of the urgent need for clos-
er cooperation between nations if satisfactory outcomes are to be
expected.

Clearly, nation-states on their own, even with the help of properly func-
tioning markets, are incapable of solving international (transborder)
externalities, achieving the social goals of maximization of well-being,
and addressing the pressing issue of social justice or disaster. When they
fail to address some pressing issues of our time, the implications are far-
reaching.

GLOBALIZATION: PRELUDE TO A WORLD COMMONWEALTH?

Just as market failures provide the rationale for government and for cor-
rective government intervention, so government failures, particularly
those related to the phenomenon of international public goods and other
kinds of externalities, are impelling nation-states into closer cooperation
in different economic and political spheres, leading to international coop-
eration and globalization.

Economists define globalization to mean the increasing internat i o n a l-
ization of production, distribution, and marketing of goods and services. It
implies increasing integration of economic activities through trade and
investment flows, and the production of commodities in different countries
through foreign direct investment, in order to increase efficiency.
However, globalization represents a continuum encompassing social and
economic relations and networks from the local to the regional to the
international. Globalization may be taken to refer to the processes of
change in the organization of human affairs, linking and expanding
human activity across regions and continents, in other words “a stretching
of social, political and economic activities across frontiers such that
events, decisions and activities in one region of the world can come to
have significance for individuals and communities in distant regions of
the globe” (Held and McGrew 54). Globalization goes beyond economics

56            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 15. 1/4. 2005

and refers to “entrenched and enduring patterns of worldwide intercon-
nectedness” (3).15

Two Different Aspects of Globalization
Simply put, there are two different but related aspects of globalization
which can be advanced. The first refers to the expansion of trade through
reduced impediments to the mobility of goods, people, information, and
investment across national borders. The second relates to the creation and
development of international institutions aimed at facilitating cooperation
between nation-states to more effectively deal with the international pub-
lic good externalities. Indeed, expansion of trade may be one outcome of
such cooperation, among others.

With regard to the first aspect, the world community is recognizing
that it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain national economic
borders in light of the current surge in the growth of freer trade.
Economic theory has long maintained that free trade, based on the law of
comparative advantage, will enhance the level of well-being for all the
parties involved.

The advent of globalization, followed by the interconnectedness of the
nations, has led to the reduction or elimination of tariff barriers. This has
led to even more trade,16 the freer flow of capital, the emergence of multi-
national production, and the formation of transnational corporations
engaged in the worldwide movement of raw materials, goods, and ser-
vices. As a result, corporations locate their production wherever it is more
economically viable, that is, where the lowest cost of production can be
realized.

Recent experiences have shown that the global economy, driven by
globalization and the desire to expand freer trade, has experienced
unprecedented innovations in technology and new approaches to market-
ing and consumerism.17 These have been followed by adjustments in poli-
cies and governance, which have led, in turn, to an intense debate over the
effects of this aspect of globalization on the role and functions of nation-
states and the possible implications for their long-term survival.
The other reason for the widespread support for globalization is the fact

that the world community—as a result of radical innovations and changes
in communication technology—has become increasingly interdependent.
As mentioned earlier, no country acting alone can solve international
environmental problems, but all countries acting together can make a sig-
nificant difference.

Recent trends in globalization indicate that nation-states have found it
increasingly difficult to implement economic and social policies aimed at
accomplishing their own internal objectives, while simultaneously having
to deal with international externalities. The solution has been the forma-
tion of regional economic blocks or unions in pursuit of common objec-
tives. Witness the establishment of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the European
Economic Union, the Organization of American States, and the euro
region. Referring to the report by the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development entitled The World in 2020: Towards a New
Global Age, the International Monetary Fund argued that closer linkages
between nations are essential for economic growth and should continue if
the world is to experience improved living standards, elimination of pove r-
ty, promotion of environmentally sustainable policies, and accelerated
movement toward sustainable development in all areas of the world (30).

The Impact of Globalization on Nation-States
What impact will globalization have on the role and power of nation-
states? In answer to this question, different and contradictory views have
been expressed in both the economics and political science literature.18 On
one side of the debate, there are those who predict the weakening of the
economic and political powers of nation-states. This, it is argued, may
eventually give way to the formation of an international government.
Others argue that globalization will require a stronger role in some areas
by nation-states, to ensure their continued existence for the foreseeable
future.19

Hirst and Thompson, for example, argue that, while globalization leads
to a new role for national gove rnments, it will continue to make them
more relevant in a unique way. In their view, “The emerging fo rms of

58            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 15. 1/4. 2005

gove rnance of international markets and other economic processes
involve the major national governments but in a new role: states will
come to function less as ‘sovereign’ entities and more as the components
of an international ‘quasi-polity’; the central functions of the nation-state
will become those of providing legitimacy for and ensuring the account-
ability of supra n ational and subnational gove rnance mechanisms”
(256–57). The other task for the nation-state, they argue, is the regula-
tion of populations, since “people are less mobile than money, goods or
ideas, and in a sense they remain ‘nationalized,’ dependent on passport s,
visas, residence, and labour qualifications.” These give the nation-state
legitimacy in the international community because it can “speak for that
population” (257).

Others argue that globalization poses a threat to the nation-state, not
only by preventing the state from carrying out its traditional functions,
but also by threatening its long-term survival. The growth of transna-
tional corporations—so the argument goes—can undermine the eco-
nomic power of the nation-state, while advances in communication weak-
en their political authority and control. These advances give more power
to the citizens by making information readily available to individuals, thus
reducing the power exercised by national governments. Spybey argues
that with “the organization of communication, production and consump-
tion progresses on a global basis, the organization of the polity in the
form of the nation-state is losing its authority in the face of global com-
munication and global economy” (63).20 Samuels claims that “[i]t is
already the case—to the dismay of some, of course—that national sover-
eignty has been eroded. But—and herein lies another irony—much of the
erosion is due to the increasing hegemony of corporate governance,
increasing globalization of the economy, and the operation of market
forces” (282).

Reich makes an even stronger statement regarding the effect of global-
ization on the nation-state. He argues that globalization will lead to the
disintegration of the national economy and the erosion of national sover-
eignty. According to Reich, this irreversible trend caused by globalization
will continue, and any attempt to resist it is politically ineffectual. On the

other hand, Wendt, relying on the teleological logic of anarchy, shows that
the emergence of a world state is inevitable. According to Wendt, “ The
process moves through five stages, each responding to the instabilities of
the one before: a system of states, a society of states, world society, collec-
tive security, and the world state” (ii). He concludes that, while a world
state may not satisfy all demands of justice, “it would be at least a mini-
mum condition for a just world order” (58).

Weiss summarizes this debate eloquently when she writes:

> Globalists continue to maintain that there are big, fin de siècle trans-
> formations under way in the world at large, which can be laid at the
> door of something called globalization. This new era—popularized as
> a “world without borders” and symbolized by the dismantling of the
> Berlin wall—ostensibly came into its own where the Cold War left off.
> Globalists of all shades see a new world order in the making, marked
> by the de-territorialization of economic and political affairs, the
> ascendance of highly mobile, transnational forms of capital, and the
> growth of global forms of governance. By the same token, globaliza-
> tion skeptics, scrutinizing very similar empirical terrain, continue to
> pose the same insistent question. The dispute between globalists and
> skeptics is not about the reality of change; it is about the nature and
> significance of the changes under way as well as the driving forces
> behind them” (59).21

Although they differ in their predictions of future directions, the pace
of c h a n g e, and degree and nature of final impact, both sides of the debate
agree that globalization has fundamentally altered, and continues to alter,
the ways in which nation-states conduct their traditional economic,
social, and political business. Will this lead to a new system of gove r-
nance worldwide? No reasonable person can doubt that the changes
caused by globalization already underway point in the direction of greater
international integration. Regardless of which side of the argument is
presented, the trend toward globalization will eve n t u a l ly lead to signifi-
cant changes in the way in which nation-states function.

TOWARD A WORLD COMMONWEALTH: A BAHÁ’Í PERSPECTIVE

The principle of unity is at the heart of the Bahá’í conception of global-
ization. Saiedi elegantly reflects on this relationship when he discusses
environmental pollution, world hunger, nuclear war, and the inequality of
opportunities and access to resources facing the modern world. He
explains that such issues “can only be resolved if all people regard them-
selves as members of one human community. . . . It is for these reasons that
Bahá’u’lláh talks about a New World Order and has always declared the
realization of the oneness of humanity to be the ultimate goal of His rev-
elation” (324).

However, reliance on the unity of humanity in the Bahá’í Faith takes us
well beyond the simplistic conception and outcomes of the issues as dis-
cussed in the current globalization literature. The Bahá’í approach recog-
nizes that unmanaged globalization in its present-day forms can lead to
critical social ills which can only be resolved when human unity is
acknowledged. In effect, the Bahá’í Faith provides solutions to these prob-
lems resulting from mismanaged globalization by including the principles
of unity and social justice in the quest for world government. Saiedi
explains that “Bahá’u’lláh is designating and establishing a new unit of
analysis—the global level—at which to reconceptualize human spiritual,
economic, and political culture and institutions” (324).

For globalization to take hold and ensure that its benefits are shared
equitably among the citizens of the world, other conditions must be met.
The formation of the world commonwealth suggested in the Bahá’í
Writings depends on whether they are, indeed, met. It is only in the con-
text of global governance and the establishment of the foundation for an
equitable world community that the Bahá’í principles of oneness of the
world humanity, a universal auxiliary language, equality of women and
men, and eradication of extremes of poverty and wealth, find their rele-
vance. In the words of Bahá’u’lláh, “The well-being of mankind, its peace
and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly estab-
lished” (Gleanings 286).

In its statement “The Prosperity of Humankind,” the Bahá’í
International Community’s Office of Public Information clarifies this
important precondition: “The bedrock of a strategy that can engage the
world’s population in assuming responsibility for its collective destiny
must be the consciousness of the oneness of humankind. Deceptively sim-
ple in popular discourse, the concept that humanity constitutes a single
people presents fundamental challenges to the way that most of the insti-
tutions of the contemporary society carry out their functions” (7).

The impact of globalization reveals that the prerequisites for such
change, although not perfect, are already in place. The trend toward glob-
al governance is underway and it will continue to intensify in the future,
ideally following a gradual process rather than a sudden change caused by
a war or total collapse of existing structures.

The dual phenomena of market and government failure are linked to the
very issues that become relevant in the Bahá’í discourse, particularly the
issues of equity, social justice, and income distribution.22 According to
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “the principal cause of these difficulties lies in the laws of
the present civilization; for they lead to a small number of individuals
a c c u m u l ating incomparable fo rtunes, beyond their needs, while the
greater number remain destitute, stripped and in the greatest misery”
(Some Answered Questions 273). The Bahá’í teachings recognize that gov-
ernments must be made accountable for solving these probl e m s.23
However, it is clear that nation-states—in their present configuration and
condition—are unable to deal with extraterritorial externalities, interna-
tional public goods, and income distribution.

From a Bahá’í perspective, nation-states fail not only because of the dif-
ficulties they encounter in governing, but because of their inability to
address underlying issues of social justice and ethical standards. If d e c i-
sions are frequently founded on the self-interest of government actors
(Musgrave 248), then governments will inevitably be unable to incorp o rate
moral values into their action plan and will fail to move society toward the
goal of maximizing well-being. As Saiedi points out, Bahá’u’lláh’s “per-
spective intentionally transcends the limited nationalistically oriented

62             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 15. 1/4. 2005

d i sc o u rse of political theory because solutions based on the cat egory of the
nation-state are inadequate to meet the needs and moral challenges of a
global human society” (324).

While one may argue that nation-states must continue to exist for many
economic, political, and sociological reasons, there are many functions
which nation-states alone cannot perform satisfactorily. For example,
although they may be able to moderate them to some degree, nation-states
alone cannot implement a sound and effective international program of
environmental stewardship, eliminate or efficiently control transboundary
pollution, eliminate or control economic fluctuations, eradicate poverty,
manage the monopolistic behavior of transnational corporations, or deal
with international public good externalities.24

Given that (a) many of the factors precipitating market and government
failure are inherently international and thus spill over the artificial bound-
aries of the nation-states, (b) many problems facing humanity require
more attention than any single nation-state can offer, and (c) there is every
possibility that increasing globalization will make the nation-state to
some extent less relevant, the need for a more globalized system of gov-
ernance becomes immediately apparent.

What is proposed in the Bahá’í Writings is the establishment of a world
commonwealth comprising all the nations of the world. This would
amount to the eventual abolition of the existing artificial and arbitrary
barriers which, over the course of history, have separated the peoples of
the world and created the conflicts which continue to waste human
resources and lives. If the global community is serious about resolving the
numerous social and economic problems that it is currently facing then it
must take full advantage of the process of globalization to allow for more
meaningful cooperation between nation-states, with the view of ultimate-
ly forming such a commonwealth.

According to Shoghi Effendi, this commonwealth of nations is one in
which the members will, “as the trustees of the whole of mankind, ulti-
mately control the entire resources of all the component nations. . . .” (World
Order of Bahá’u’lláh 203).25 Shoghi Effendi further elaborates by pro-
claiming that “[s]ome form of a world Super-State must needs be evolved,

in whose favor all the nations of the world will have willingly ceded . . .
certain rights to impose taxation. . . . [a] world community in which all
economic barriers will have been permanently demolished and the inter-
dependence of Capital and Labor definitely recognized. . . .” (40–41).

The specific emphasis by Shoghi Effendi on the “component nations”
has implications for the practicality of such a system of world govern-
ment. The system is founded on the Bahá’í principle of unity in diversity,
and therefore recognizes the importance of the culture and history of dif-
ferent regions and peoples of the world, that is, “nations” or “compo-
nents.” These existing cultural units form the basis for the pursuit of com-
mon goals within the world commonwealth. For this, the Bahá’í Faith has
proposed a world parliament operating on behalf of a confederation of
nations called a “commonwealth.” Such an international body will play the
vital role of ensuring peace, equity, justice, and social well-being for the
world community at large, in harmony with the Bahá’í principles, one of
which is the oneness of the world of humanity.26

This is not to argue that nation-states and local gove rnments will
totally disappear. Historically, we have moved from local to regional to
national levels of gove rnment, and are now reaching the stage of world
confederation. Howeve r, this in no way implies the dissolution of local
and national gove rnments, which are necessary for representing local
preferences and administering the affairs of whole communities.27
Rather than replacing them, a world commonwealth, functioning as a
world government, will be needed to ove rsee the operation of these
national and local gove rnments in a globalized world. The main purpose
for the fo rmation of a commonwealth of nations is to ensure cohesive-
ness, cooperation, and coordination, to deal with the provision of i n t e r-
national public goods and other externalities, and, most important, to
monitor and enforce the implementation of unive rsal ethical standards
for the conduct of international relations.

The notion of world government is not unique to the Bahá’í teachings.

Many scholars, including political scientists and economists, have long
been interested and involved in discussing the possibility of fo rming a
world government.28 Although many scholars believe that it will eventually

64            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 15. 1/4. 2005

be realized, no consensus has emerged on how the move toward a world
government would materialize. Some, such as Hedley Bull, see world gov-
ernment coming about by conquest and domination; others suggest that it
will be the result of a social contract among states, or will come about in
the form of a “cosmopolis” founded upon some form of consensus. Wendt,
using the logic of anarchy, argues that a world state will emerge whether
or not the actors involved intend to bring it about, and even suggests that
while it might not satisfy all demands of justice, “it would be at least a min-
imum condition for a just world order” (58).

CONCLUSION

In this essay, I have correlated modern economic theories concerning
market and government failure with the problems faced by nation-states
in attempting to ensure efficient operation of the economy and society and
achieve social justice. I have shown that imperfections inherent in the free
market system necessitate government involvement in the economy to
help achieve those goals. However, nation-states today confront an array
of challenges that extend beyond their borders, requiring regional and
international cooperation. Globalization has created the opportunity for
freer trade and dramatically increased the need for cooperation between
and among nations, as the basis for the formation of a world common-
wealth.

While such trends toward globalization are underway, other conditions
must be met in order to ensure that every citizen of the world can share
in its potential benefits in an equitable and just manner. Such conditions
are outlined in the Bahá’í Writings with the ultimate objective of incor-
porating the principles of unity and justice in the pursuit of well-being,
and establishing a world commonwealth responsible for ensuring social
justice for all the world’s inhabitants.29

NOTES

I wish to thank Pat Gray, John Gray, Natalia Rodriguez, and Gabriel Power for
their helpful comments which greatly improved this paper. I am indebted to the

Managing Editor and two reviewers of the Journal of Bahá’í Studies for their con-
structive, professional comments on an earlier version of this paper. My son,
Arash Abizadeh, should be credited for having encouraged me to begin work on
this project.

> 1. See Heller for some of these studies.

2. Huddleston cites historical trends in the formation of international econom-
ic organization and in the attempts of policy makers to close the gap between the
poor and rich segments of societies, as an indication of a trend toward a world
economy. Meanwhile, Dahl offers a normative view of the principles of the Bahá’í
Faith relating to economics. Although there are many studies dealing with the
Bahá’í views on economic issues (for example, Rassekh and Fish) none has sys-
tematically tried to link the Bahá’í principles to economic theory pertaining to
market and government failure. It must be emphasized here that the Bahá’í
Writings do not set forth an economic system in precise detail. Rather, they out-
line a number of general principles as guidelines for economists in designing a
system which allows for the incorporation of moral values into the process of set-
ting economic goals and policies.

4. For a more detailed discussion of the Bahá’í view, see Graham; Dahl. This is
not to say that economists themselves have ignored the impact of ethical and
social issues. Indeed, volumes have been written on the relationship between eco-
nomics and ethics. For example, see articles by Buchanan; Miller and Paul; Sen;
Crouch and Marquand; Koslowski.

5. The term used in economics is “Pareto-optimality,” referring to the optimum
allocation of resources by the market to achieve maximum social welfare. The
main criterion for this efficiency rule can be termed “minimal harm”; that is, any
action that improves one person’s well-being without harming another should be
taken. This notion obviously ignores the concept of distributive justice.

6. This means that as the scale of a company’s output is increased, the per-unit
cost of production is decreased.

Badi’i 106–7. For a fuller discussion of this important subject, see Badi’i 106–7.

9. The fourth perspective is called “the flawed state,” and relates to government
failure, discussed below.

10. The “internalization” of externalities refers to government policies which
ensure the inclusion of all costs and benefits associated with externalities into the
functioning of the parties involved. For example, a government may impose pol-
lution-abatement taxes on a company in order to force it to bear some of the costs
of pollution it has incurred.

11. “Rent seeking” refers to the activities of individuals who use the political
system to redirect income to themselves, in other words, who use the govern-
ment to obtain higher than normal returns. See Rosen, Dahlby, Smith, and
Boothe 152. Note that rent seeking can become outright corruption, as in bribery,
the buying of candidates or officials by political or industrial lobby groups
attempting to use the political process to redistribute wealth in their favor, influ-
ence peddling, and vote buying by government officials, the abuse of public office
or the public purse for personal gain, and so on.

example.

the formation of regional agreements.

McGrew 54–55.

16. It is important to note that Shoghi Effendi advocated the elimination of
trade barriers in favor of the benefits of freer trade (World Order of Bahá’u’lláh
204). Past and present studies confirm that tariffs and custom duties—originally
designed to control borders—have lost their value as an instrument of econom-
ic control. See articles by Abizadeh and Yousefi; Tosun and Abizadeh.

17. Consumerism refers to the phenomenon of encouraging increased con-
sumption of newly produced goods and services through aggressive marketing.

18. For alternative points of view, see, among others, Jones; Hirst and
Thompson; Spybey.

19. Using theoretical and empirical results, I have argued that globalization
does not always lead to a more intense involvement of the state. Rather, this
depends on historical factors and past practices of particular countries. See
Abizadeh.

20. There are a number of writers on the subject who attempt to introduce
changes to the nation-state in order to help it survive the impact of globalization
and the eventual dismantling of its institutions. For a comprehensive study on
this issue see Jones.

21. For a comprehensive analysis of the globalization debate see Held and
McGrew.

22. The Bahá’í Writings not only contain economic principles concerning the
everyday operation of modern economies (see ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Promulgation 233),
but also take into account the fact that many things may go wrong in this process.
It has also provided specific guidelines to address those issues (see, for example,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions 274–76). Among them is the eradication of
extremes of poverty and wealth. Poverty is a phenomenon that can easily materi-
alize if the market is left unchecked. See Graham 5–8 for more on the subject of
distributive justice and related issues in the Bahá’í Faith. It is worth noting that
recent developments in the literature show that globalization can and does result
in positive outcomes regarding redistribution.

globalizing world, see Chapter 8 in Jones.

29. In this brief paper I have not dealt with the mechanism by which the
nation-state, with all its inadequacies, may come to the conclusion that a new
strategy for global government is indeed needed. Neither have I dealt with the
impediments that may prevent nation-states from developing such strategies.
These, I hope, will be discussed by scholars in the field of political theory in the
not-too-distant future.
