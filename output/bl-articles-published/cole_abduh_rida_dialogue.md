A Dialogue on the Bahá'í Faith

Translation and Introduction by Juan Ricardo Cole

World Order Vol. 15 nos. 3-4 (1981), pp. 7-16

When Mírzá Ḥusayn ‘Alí Núrí (1817-92), entitled “Bahá'u'lláh,” was exiled in the summer of 1863

from Baghdád to Istanbul, it was natural that the Bábí movement, of which He was then the de facto
head, should come face to face with the social issues confronting the Ottoman Empire. Between 1863
and 1868 Bahá'u'lláh not only founded a new religion (the Bahá'ís Faith) but in the process transformed
Bábism from an eschatological protest movement into a religion aimed at reforming world society to
accord with the new social, economic, and political realities then making their impact on the parts of the
Ottoman Empire closest to Europe.1

Bahá'u'lláh began to consider highly charged political issues such as the propriety of adopting a
constitutional monarchy, a parliamentarian form of government, and other European innovations. Even
wider questions of how to stabilize the nationalistic state system that had emerged in Europe and was
spreading to the rest of the world were treated by Bahá'í writings, which also paid attention to the
responsibility of the state to ameliorate the condition of the poor, rather than squandering state monies in
the pursuit of mindless arms race. In short, Bahá'u'lláh in His Ottoman exile developed a coherent
program of institutional reform for societies that found themselves faced with the new world of the
industrial revolution, the mass politics of the French Revolution, and the rise of industrial capital as the
dominating factor in world affairs. In 1875 Bahá'u'lláh’s son ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ‘Abbás (1844-1921) wrote a
book aimed at convincing the Iranian government to adopt a series of modernist reforms based on Bahá'í
ideals.2

The shift of focus from millenarianism to a social gospel made Bahá'í thought suddenly relevant to
Muslim reformers who were confronted with many of the same problems. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá met in later
years with such figures as Midḥat Páshá, the Turkish supporter of constitutionalism, and Muḥammad
‘Abduh, the proponent of Islamic legal reform.3 Muslim modernists often had an ambiguous attitude
toward the Bahá'í Faith. On the one hand, the Bahá'ís produced eloquent and convincing arguments
supporting the reformist position against the opposition of clerical conservatism and autocratic
governments. On the other, the Bahá'í Faith had put itself outside the pale of Islám and so represented, in
its own way, as much a competitor to Islám and a threat to its unity as did Christian evangelism. This
ambivalence helps to explain why Jamálu’d-Dín-i Asabábádi “Afghání” (1839-97), the Iranian agitator
and Pan-Islamist, felt it useful to keep in touch with the Bahá'ís in spite of his vehement and repeatedly
expressed antipathy to the Bábí-Bahá'í movement.4

idealistic young Egyptian reformers, including Muḥammad ‘Abduh. See Nikki Keddie, Sayyid Jamál ad-Dín ‘al-Afghání’: a political

Mixed feelings about the Bahá'ís can be clearly seen in the reformist Salafiyyah movement in Egypt.

Afghání’s own negative feelings toward it do not seem to have affected his student Muḥammad ‘Abduh,
who defended the Bahá'ís to his on student, Muḥammad Rashíd Riḍá (1865-1935).5 Riḍá was born in a
village near Tripoli in Ottoman Syria (now Lebanon). He began his higher studies at the National
Islamic School founded in Tripoli by Shaykh Ḥusayn al-Jisr (1845-1909) and went to Cairo to study
with ‘Abduh in 1897. He originally wanted to join Afghání in Istanbul, but the latter’s death determined
him to seek out his most famous student, ‘Abduh. In 1898 Riḍá began a journal, al-Manár (The
Lighthouse) as a forum for his ideas on the reform of Muslim society. The subject of the Bahá'í Faith
was treated several times in this journal, and the hostile stance Riḍá took against the Bahá'ís there can be
seen in germ in an early conversation with ‘Abduh.6 A translation of this conversation, which Riḍá
recorded, will be given below.

Riḍá’s conversation with ‘Abduh concerning the Bahá'í Faith came near the beginning of their
relationship, soon after Riḍá’s arrival in Cairo. It demonstrates a wide divergence in their outlooks and
tendencies of thought. ‘Abduh’s admiration for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the Bahá'í movement was very great,
at least as of 1897, and it is difficult to believe that he was as uninformed about the nature of the Bahá'í
Faith as Riḍá makes him out to be. We now know that ‘Abduh was little concerned with orthodoxy per
se, and if it is true that he later turned against the Bahá'ís, this was more likely because he wished to
protect his reputation than because he belatedly recognized that there was a great difference between
Sunní Islám and the Bahá'í Faith.7 ‘Abduh did, however, seem unaware that Bahá'u'lláh and the Báb
claimed to bring new religious laws and so to be independent Messengers of God. He referred to the
movement as a sect (ṭá’ifah) of Islám. It may well be that Riḍá managed to convince ‘Abduh that the
Bahá'í Faith was a wholly new religion, and so discredited it for him as a path to the reform of Islám
itself. However, Riḍá’s avowed purpose in devoting several pages of his biography of ‘Abduh to the
latter’s views on the Bahá'ís was to clear his mentor’s name of any connection with them. It is thus
possible that he exaggerated ‘Abduh’s later disillusionment with the Bahá'í Faith.

Whatever the case may be, it seems clear that in 1897 ‘Abduh thought the Bahá'í movement the most
progressive and creative Muslim group and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá a truly great man. It is possible that ‘Abduh
himself felt the influence of Bahá'í ideas. He defends such ideas as restrictions on polygamy and the
unity of religions. His presentation of the theory of progressive revelation is very similar to the Bábí-
Bahá'í schema, and the fact that it came up during a conversation about the Bahá'ís might be an
unwitting indication that it was partially derived from them.8

That Bahá'í ideas were being taken seriously by intellectuals in turn-of-the-century Egypt is not
surprising. Iranian Bahá'ís, most of them merchants, began settling in Egypt in the late 1860s; by the
1890s there was a thriving, though numerically small, community in Alexandria and Cairo. These

communities were reinforced by the arrival in 1894 or 1895 of Mírzá Abú’l-Faḍl Gulpáygání, the
renowned Bahá'í scholar.9 Gulpáygání (1844-1914) was sent by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Egypt from Palestine,
where he had spent ten months after his return from ‘Ishqábád in Russia. He began to establish himself
among students and professors at the Azhar Mosque College as an expert in geography, history,
dialectical theology (kalám), and Qur’án commentary and managed to attract some students to his circle.
They undoubtedly believed him to be a Shi‘ite, and he did nothing to dispel the idea.

In 1896 when a Pan-Islamist follower of Jamálu’d-Dín-i Afghání assassinated Náṣiru’d-Dín Sháh,
the Iranian Muslims in Cairo were convinced that the Bahá'ís were at fault, and there was some
sentiment that a wholesale massacre of the Bahá'ís in Egypt should be carried out in revenge.10 Mírzá
Mihdí Khán Za’imu’d-Dawlih, a knowledgeable enemy of the Bahá'í Faith was among those agitating
against the Bahá'ís.11 However, the ambassador forestalled this action, and it was soon established that
the Bahá'ís were not involved in the assassination.

Soon there, Mihdí Khán openly accused Gulpáygání of being a Bahá'í, to which the latter replied
that he was indeed and not ashamed of it.12 This open proclamation of his faith must have made it easier
for him to comply with the request of the editors of al-Muqtaṭaf, a popular secular magazine, that he
write an article explaining the Bahá'í Faith.13 This was probably the first time that the Bahá'ís in the
Middle East were able to utilize the press to publicize their faith.

Rashíd Riḍá, then a student in Tripoli, read the al-Muqtaṭaf article and with a group of friends wrote
a letter to Gulpáygání protesting its contents. This was the beginning of Riḍá’s antipathy to the Bahá'í
Faith. Later, when he arrived in Cairo, he met with Gulpáygání and was unhappy with the latter’s
exposition of the divinity of Bahá'u'lláh. As a strict Sunní Muslim, Riḍá was unable or unwilling to
understand the doctrine of theophany (ẓuhúru’lláh) preached by the Bahá'ís. It smacked to him of
incarnationism and seemed to make the Bahá'í Faith far more similar to Christianity than to the
transcendalist faith of Islám.

Gulpáygání subsequently published his book, al-Fará’id, in Cairo, and because of this and other
writings, eventually a declaration that he had departed from Islám (takfír) into unbelief was issued by
some ‘ulamá. Under an Islamic government that could have meant his death, as this was a capital
offense under Islamic law. However, Egypt at that time was ruled by the British. Not all the students and
teachers at the Azhar were quite so zealously orthodox. Indeed, Gulpáygání managed to convert some
fourteen students and teachers.14 Some of them were subsequently expelled from the Azhar, at least one
at Rashíd Riḍá’s insistence. Later another of Gulpáygání’s books was published: ad-Durar al-Bahiyyah
(Glorious Pearls). This work was in Arabic, and it attracted the favorable notice of nationalist
spokesman Muṣṭafá Kámil.15 The book incensed Rashíd Riḍá, who did everything he could to ensure
that it was not favorably reviewed in the Cairo press.

From Riḍá’s testimony the three most striking aspects of Gulpáygání’s message were his insistence
that Islamic society and religion be reformed; his conviction that reform could successfully be
undertaken only by a new Messenger of God; and a millenarian belief in the imminent destruction of the

world, particularly Europe. Gulpáygání’s ideas about the theophany must be understood against the
background of Bahá'í theology, in which God’s essence is transcendent and unknowable, while His
attributes can be reflected on earth by a Manifestation of God (mazhar-i-iláhí). Riḍá confused this
Shi‘ite Islamic doctrine with the Christian dogma of the Incarnation. The appearance of such a
theophany helped Middle Eastern Bahá'ís in the nineteenth and early twentieth century explain the rapid
and sweeping changes taking place in their societies and the world at large. The changes were
understood as concomitants of the eschatological advent of a new theophany though whose teachings
traditional society could be transformed to accord with changed social conditions. In late nineteenth- and
very early twentieth-century Egypt the Bahá'í Faith seemed largely to appeal to a small number of
merchants and ‘ulamá, who were looking for a means of asserting their cultural identity against Europe.
The Bahá'í Faith seems to have struck them as exactly the sort of revitalization of Islamic principles that
could allow Muslims to restore the greatness of their civilization. For members of the traditional lower
middle class, the ‘ulamá and the bazaar elements, who were hurt by the competition of European trade,
Gulpáygání’s idea that God was about to rain down his wrath upon Europe cannot have been particularly
distressing.

Riḍá as a contemporary observer, apparently felt that the Bahá'í Faith was appealing enough to
constitute a threat to Sunní Islám. Only this can explain his steady stream of polemics against it. But, in
point of fact, Cairo and Alexandria did not prove to be particularly fertile ground for the Bahá'ís, who
never grew to more than a few hundred in either city. While a nationalist spokesman for the lower
middle class like Muṣṭafá Kámil was impressed by Bahá'í ideas, he did not join the new religion.
Moreover, the competing nationalist current he headed was to be far more representative of Egyptian
social movements in the twentieth century than the Bahá'í Faith.

Between the nationalist tradition running from Kámil through Gamal Abdel Nasser and the
Adventist social gospel of the Bahá'ís stood the reformist Islamic Salafiyyah movement headed by
Rashíd Riḍá. As an advocate of moderate social and religious reform, Riḍá rejected the Bahá'ís as
extremists. He not only bitterly criticized them for accepting the appearance of a prophet after
Muḥammad (Muslim doctrine asserts that he is the last prophet) but also assailed them for their tendency
to behave outwardly as Muslims while inwardly professing a wholly new faith. He claimed that ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá deliberately misled Muslim leaders by telling them that the Bahá'í Faith was simply a reform of
Shi‘ite Islám. In the discretion, doubt derived largely from the repressive atmosphere of religious
intolerance in which the Bahá'ís were forced to operate, a discretion that Riḍá perceived as
secretiveness, he saw a modern recrudescence of the esotericism of the Ismá‘ílís. The subsequent history
of the Bahá'í Faith belies this impression, but it was undoubtedly an easy one to form in turn-of-the-
century Egypt. The claim by Bahá'í leaders that their faith was a reform of Shí‘ism was no doubt an
honest self-perception.

Riḍá was particularly angered by Bahá'u'lláh’s promulgation of a new law concerning marriage,
limiting the number of wives to two rather than the Qur’anic four.16 Reform for Riḍá could only mean a
more perfect understanding of and adherence to the immutable religious law of the Prophet Muḥammad.
Riḍá felt that in revealing a new law Bahá'u'lláh had chosen to abandon Islám rather than reform it.

The following is a translation of a transcription of the conversation between Riḍá and ‘Abduh
recorded in Riḍá’s diary. Riḍá included it in his biography of ‘Abduh and framed it with a clearly biased

\[16\] See Bahá'u'lláh, al Kitáb al-aqdas (Bombay: n.p., n.d.), p. 64.; cf. A Synopsis and Codification of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas the Most Holy Book
of Bahá'u'lláh (Haifa: Bahá'í World Centre, 1973), pp. 39, 47, 59.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá later interpreted the verse concerning polygamy in the Kitáb-i Aqdas to mean that only monogamy was actually
> permissible since true justice was impossible in polygamy. This argument was developed by Muḥammad ‘Abduh and his circle. It was

and polemical account.17 However, the chapter retains a good deal of historical value for students of the
Bahá'í Faith, and the conversation itself shows clearly ‘Abduh’s sympathies for this movement and its
ideals at that time. Riḍá begins by saying that he had become interested in the Bábí and Bahá'í Faiths
while a student of Islamic sciences in Tripoli, Syria (now Lebanon). Determined to investigate them, he
met with Gulpáygání on his arrival in Cairo in 1897 and says he debated with him repeatedly. Riḍá
claims to have had in his possession a letter from Gulpáygání in which the latter openly calls people to
the Bahá'í Faith. Riḍá complains that the Bahá'ís were forbidden to try to spread their religion in the
Ottoman Empire, including Egypt,18 according to the terms prescribed by the Empire “when it allowed
them to live in ‘Akká, to move about freely, and to reside in all its lands.” Riḍá was confused here,
however, since the Bahá'í leadership was exiled to ‘Akká rather than being “allowed: to live there, and
the movement of Bahá'ís was quite restricted. The idea he presents that there was some sort of
agreement between the Bahá'ís and the Ottomans appears to have no basis in fact.

Riḍá claims to have found ‘Abduh rather uninformed about the Bahá'í Faith but believing in what he
had been told about it by “’Abbás Effendi.”19 He says that when ‘Abduh was living in Beirut
(presumably in the late 1880s) ‘Abdu’l-Bahá more than once came to Beirut from Haifa and would
make a point of attending some of Muḥammad ‘Abduh’s study sessions. Bahá'í sources, however, speak
of only one encounter between ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and ‘Abduh, and the matter of how intimate the two men
were bears more investigation. After ‘Abduh returned to Cairo, he continued to correspond with
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and Riḍá said that he had in his possession some of the latter’s letters to ‘Abduh.

After the conversation was over, Riḍá remarked in his diary that ‘Abduh “asserts the necessity of
reform, but the immoderation of the reformers. And were it not for this immoderation of the Bábís
[Bahá'ís], he would have liked to help them.” Riḍá lamented that ‘Abduh had never read Afghání’s Arab
Encyclopedia article on the Bábís and seemed to think of them as simply a reformist movement within
Shi‘ite Islám. Riḍá claims that Gulpáygání once explained to him the Bahá'í doctrine of Bahá'u'lláh’s
divinity and ended by saying “He is God, there is no God but Him” and by applying various names of
God to Bahá'u'lláh. Riḍá seems to be reporting in garbled fashion the Bahá'í doctrine that Bahá'u'lláh
was the manifestation of the names and attributes of God. He says that, when he reported to ‘Abduh this
Bahá'í belief in the divinity of Bahá'u'lláh, ‘Abduh turned against the Bahá'ís and considered them to be
extremist Shí‘ites. Given ‘Abduh’s prejudice against Shí‘ites, this is not impossible, especially in view
of the garbled way in which the Bahá'í doctrine was communicated to him.

Riḍá then discuses the articles against the Bahá'í Faith that he later published in his journal, in which
he attempted to disprove the Bahá'í assertion that the persistence and growth of a religious movement is
proof that it possesses some intrinsic truth. Riḍá argued in utilitarian fashion that any religious
movement, no matter how false, could be kept going by an efficient propaganda machine. He claims that
‘Abduh was impressed with these later articles, in spite of the fact that he had earlier defended the Bahá'í
view. Riḍá says that ‘Abduh also liked a later article in which he attempted to stress sectarian divisions
within the Bahá'í Faith. Even in Riḍá’s time, however, it was clear to most observers that the vast
majority of the Bahá'ís chose to follow ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in accordance with Bahá'u'lláh’s Book of the
Covenant (Kitáb-i-‘Ahd)

‘Abduh and Riḍá were two of the more influential Sunní Muslim thinkers of their day. ‘Abduh’s
own analyses have formed a basis for liberal Islamic reformist thought throughout the Sunní world.
Riḍá’s influence was more circumscribed, but his version of the Salafiyyah movement was highly
influential, especially in North Africa. His journal, al-Manár had a wide following, and he appealed
more to the lower middle class than ‘Abduh, who was more favored by the upper middle class. With the
resurgence of lower middle class Islamic fundamentalism in several Sunní countries in recent years Riḍá

may once again become influential. What these two men had to say about the Bahá'í Faith in Cairo one
evening in 1897, therefore, remains relevant even today.

Translation
Riḍá: (The first conversation that took place between us concerning them [the Bahá'ís] occurred at the
end of a discussion of jurisprudents and Ṣúfís. When I noted the similarity between Ṣúfism and
extremist Shí‘ism (al-báṭiniyyah) in the use of esoteric interpretation (ta’wil) [of the Qur’án], I asked
him his opinion of the Bábí [-Bahá'í] Faith.)
‘Abduh: “This sect is the only one that strives so that sciences and arts might be acquired by the
Muslims. There are learned and wise men among its adherents, but I do not know the truth of their
school, nor do I know if the incarnationism and the like which is attributed to them is attributed rightly
so or not. Rather, I find it exceedingly strange.”
Riḍá: (Then I asked him about Mírzá Faḍlu’lláh al-Íráni.20
‘Abduh: “I have heard of him recently and that he is an historian and a man of refinement, but I haven’t
met him.”
Riḍá:”Yes, he excels in history, and has traveled a great deal. He is of refined character.” I mentioned all
that I knew of his characteristics and remarked, “He appears to me to be one of their propagandists.”
(Then I asked him about ‘Abbás Effendi:) “I hear that he excels in religious science and in diplomacy
(as-siyásah), and that he is wise enough to satisfy all who seek his company.”
‘Abduh: “Yes, ‘Abbás Effendi transcends all that. He is, in fact, a great man; he is the man to whom it is
right to apply that epithet.”
Riḍá: “I have met with Mírzá Faḍlu’lláh several times and have debated with him, finding that he
presents as evidence for the soundness of his teachings the period of their duration, as well as their
diffusion and growth. He protests by means of Qur’án verses that only the truth can endure and
persevere, as ‘Surely falsehood is ever certain to perish’ and ‘To Him is the call of truth,’ etc.”21
‘Abduh: “And I say that only truth and good persevere and endure, and that evil and falsehood do not
endure. If they should spread and grow, even so the people’s propagandizing for them will not be so
long-lived that it would be right to protest against this principle.”

(He saw that I had misgivings about his words, and continued:) “I do not assert that whatever is
stable is true and good; I speak only of that which possesses a spiritual life and growth. The endurance
of spiritual things is not like that of a stone which one finds in a place, and which no one moves, or as a
mountain and the like, the continuing endurance of which is due to the lack of anyone to move it rather
than to a vital power which holds it back from oblivion.

“As for that which possesses life, such as the call to a religion or school, it will neither persevere nor
endure save if the call be intrinsically true, even if some degree of falsehood encompasses it in some of
its phases. For this is an accidental quality that cannot prevent its endurance and continuance, unlike the
call that is false in its foundation. For this reason the call of no one who claimed to be a prophet after out
Prophet—may the peace and blessings of God be upon Him—ever endured, because he is the Seal of
Prophets. Even were the fact that he is the Seal of the Prophets not in the Qur’án, the very nature of
existence would point to it merely on deliberation upon the message and teachings of the Qur’án.”

Messenger according to their intellectual level and the condition of their society at that time. As man
progressed, God ordained more advanced religious laws for him, until He sealed them with the mission
of the Seal of the Prophets, which s the religion for mankind’s maturity.”

(Then he explained the matter in a way such that we may dispense with it here because he set it
down in the Treatise on Divine Unity, in the investigation of the progress of the religious, the seal of
which is Islam insofar as it is God’s message to man at the age of his maturity. The Treatise had not yet
been printed when he spoke these words to me, nor had its composition been completed.)22
Riḍá: “The followers of the Báb and Bahá’ were attracted by them when they saw a miraculous rational
faculty in them.23 Thus they followed them, even though this is something natural. It has been well-
known in nature for some individuals to possess a miraculous rational faculty (such as the late Czar of
Russia). Thus at some times persons exist with miraculous rational faculties, and if any of them arises
with a call to something such as a religion, school (madhhab), or a Ṣúfí order (ṭaríqah), many people
follow him. They are attracted by him and admire his impressive thought, perceptions, and words, even
though his call is to something unreasonable, and even though he cannot establish a proof for it.”
‘Abduh: “I believe that when someone with a miraculous rational faculty calls people to a good things
and has success in this he must be supported by a Spirit from God. For God does not bring this rational
faculty into existence on a whim.”
Riḍá: “Do you believe this on the basis of conscience alone, or on that of rational evidence?”
‘Abduh: “No, it is rational. History from beginning to end witnesses to it and gives evidence for it.
Indeed, the Prophets and the founders of the true schools were all of this sort.”
Riḍá: “Your former and subsequent statements are identical to what the Bábís allege, and you do not
contradict them save in one thing, which is really everything: You have confirmed that no change is
possible in the principles and religious law of Islám. For it is that whereby God addressed mankind at
the time of his attainment to maturity, and in the phase of his intellectual perfection, beyond which there
is no higher phase requiring another divine legislation for his education and perfection. Rather, He has
entrusted man in all that comes thereafter to his own personal endeavor (ijtihád) and self-reliance. But
the import of the words of their propagandists such as Mírzá Faḍlu’lláh, according to what is indicated
in the letter he wrote to some of our brethren, clarifying the article he published in al-Muqtaṭaf, is either
that Bahá’ is a renewer of the Islamic religious law or that he is the bringer of a new religious law.24 Hey
support each of these standpoints with Qur’án verses and Traditions. Their assertion that it is possible
for there to be a renewer is the first stage in their invitation of Muslims to their religion. If the one who
is invited accepts this, they shift him to the second position. Their way of making propaganda and
interpreting Qur’án verses and prophetic Traditions according to their base desires is like the way of
their forbears among the esotericists, such as the Ismá’ílís, etc. They say that the objective of their
religion, or its principles and intentions (maqáṣid), is the unification of the religions. They look into the
books of the Jews and the Christians and interpret them the way they interpret the Qur’án. Mírzá
Faḍlu’lláh claims, as I have heard from him, that the Book of every religious community contains an

\[22\] See footnote 8 above.

\[23\] Riḍá later made the following interjection in his notes. “It would have been more right to have said, ‘unusual psychological states and
strange statements.’ ”

\[24\] See Note 13 above. Riḍá notes here: “Mírzá Faḍlu’lláh had written an article for the al-Muqtaṭaf, the subject of which was ‘The Báb and
> Bábism,’ asserting that it was an historical piece. I read it with some of the other students of religious knowledge in Tripoli, and we
> perceived a contradiction of the Islamic law therein. So we wrote to our brother, Shaykh Ismá‘íl al-Ḥáfiẓ, who was living in the vicinity
> of the Azhar, asking him to inform Mírzá Faḍlu’lláh of our disapproval. He was so informed and wrote a letter clarifying his intent.
> [This] included what we [later] learned from him: that the Bahá'í Faith is a new religion and that they propagandize for it secretly, like the

exposition of all that will befall that community; that the Gospel contains an exposition of the current
condition of Europe and that the Europeans shall be entirely annihilated. Mírzá Faḍlu’lláh appealed for
evidence to the second chapter of 2 Peter concerning the appearance of false teachers who will spread
about the heresy of perdition and who will attract to themselves swift perdition, promising liberty while
they are slaves of corruption, etc.”
‘Abduh: “If Peter had known what was to befall Christianity and reported it, he would have also reported
that which is more important than the appearance of Protestantism and everything else which has
befallen it—that is, its alteration and transformation into idolatry. For Christianity changed into idolatry
in the age of Constantine, three hundred years after Christ. Constantine was a pagan king who claimed
to be Christian that he might call on the support of its adherents against his enemies … and he succeeded
in this.” (He added that the term ‘liberty’ in the Epistle of Peter does not have the commonly known
sense it now bears.)
Riḍá: (After a long discussion of the history of Christianity, I gave him Mírzá Faḍlu’lláh’s handwritten
letter and left. I did not meet him again until a journey to Upper Egypt from which I returned toward the
end of Sha‘bán. I visited him on the second night of Ramaḍán, but we found no time for religious stud
because of the many visitors. Then I visited him on Friday afternoon, the sixth of Ramaḍán, and he
received me in his bedroom-study. The first thing I asked him about was Faḍlu’lláh’s letter, and I
perceived that he thought well of it. [I aid:])

“Yes, its words and style are good, especially its elucidation of the Muslims’ need for reform. But he
mentions two stages of the call for reform. The first is the reform of the Islamic religion, which is
reasonable and acceptable. It is this that we assert and strive for and for the sake of which I desire to
begin a periodical publication. The second is the need for a new revelation. He has expressed this
ambiguously, as in his statement that its comprehension depends on an understanding of ‘the
Resurrection and the folding up of the heavens of the religions.’ His reader will not understand his intent
here. But we have discussed it with him and learned that they believe the Resurrection to have occurred
and that all the descriptions of it in the Qur’an have been realized—including the rolling up of the
heavens as in God’s word, ‘And the heavens are rolled up in His right hand.’25 For them the heavens are
the religions, and the seven heavens are Brahmanism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Zoroastrianism,
Judaism, Christianity, and Islám.” Then I mentioned others of their doctrines and Qur’an interpretations,
which contain things even less likely than the interpretations of their forebears, the Ismá‘ílís and the
Fáṭimids in Egypt.
‘Abduh: “What need is there for such distance from the truth and the right, and for this talk which reason
cannot accept? I never understood any of this from ‘Abbás Effendi. He only explained that they have
undertaken to reform the Shí‘ite sect and bring it closer to the Sunnís. In reality, the Shí‘ite school is —
—.26 They are the sect most in need of reform. But, most unfortunately, none among us arise as
reformers save that they depart from moderation into extremism, and the call cannot succeed with
extremism. The Wahhábís undertook reform, and their sect would be good were it not for their
extremism and excess. What need is there for their call that the tomb of the Prophet be destroyed? Or
their assertion that all other Muslims are infidels? Or that they must be extirpated?27 Yes, there is
nothing wrong with extremism in speech or address for the sake of influencing or attracting people, or
frightening and deterring them. But not everything that is said is to be written down and acted upon. I
often say things in study or preaching sessions that I do not wish to be written down and transmitted

\[25\] Qur’án 39:67.

\[26\] Riḍá notes: “Here he said something he did not allow me to take down during his life-time, and I see the wisdom of leaving it out now
that he has passed away. But I will say that his judgment on them is more severe than that of ibn Taymíyyah.”

\[27\] “This is what was commonly (thought) of them in Egypt and all the lands of the Ottoman Empire. But then we learned from their books
> that the people had exaggerated their excesses, calumniating them to please the Ottoman State. They did not destroy the above-mentioned

from me. Their only value is their immediate effect on the soul of the one who is addressed.” (He then
asked me what it was that I rejected in Mírzá Faḍl’s letter.)
Riḍá: (I mentioned to him that, first of all, there is the matter of polygamy and concubinage and the law
of Bahá’ allows only two wives.28)
‘Abduh: (He began to explain the evils of polygamy and concubinage and the Muslims’ departure from
the guidance of the Holy Law thereby into) “excess in striving mightily after bas desire without taking
notice of the religious aim. This custom developed in ‘Abbásid times and has reached into our own age,
to the extent that you even find hundreds of these concubines with the Sulṭán of the Turks and others.
From this have sprung many corrupt practices that were highly influential in cuing the weakness of the
Muslim community and its fall to the nadir wherein it now subsists. Let alone the selling of female
Muslims from Circassia or the Sudan without the least semblance of religious legality!”

(Then he expanded on this and referred to the destruction of households resulting from polygamy
through the extension of the mutual hostility of the two wives, or more, to their children, making it
impossible to train them up properly. He said in regard to sulṭáns and rulers:) “If this large number of
women is in any of their palaces, when will their thoughts become purified such that their deliberation
upon the affairs of the Muslim community will improve?” (He only digressed so lengthily on this
subject because he thought me one of those who think well of polygamy. This was at the beginning of
our relationship. Then we returned to the subject of the Bahá'í Faith.)
Riḍá: “They assert the soundness of all the religions and religious scriptures and call all peoples of all
religious communities to their religion, that the word of mankind may become one thereby. They give as
evidence, in calling the people of each religion to their faith, what is in the scriptures of the former,
particularly the Pentateuch, the Gospel, and the Qur’an. It has become apparent to me that their way is
wiser than that of the Masons. The Masons found it advisable not to differentiate between the religions
in membership in their association, claiming that it does not touch on religion, even though their
objective is the destruction of all the religions. But the Bahá'ís assert the soundness of each religion in
itself and seek evidence within it for their own religion, which abrogates whatever preceded it.”
‘Abduh: “Drawing the religions closer together is among the things which the Islamic faith brought:
‘Say: O people of the Book! Come now to a word common between us and you.’”29 (But he found it
strange that this group presents evidence for the missions of the Báb and Bahá’ from the heavenly
scriptures.
