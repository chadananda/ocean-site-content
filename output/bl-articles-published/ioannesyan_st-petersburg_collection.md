Introduction

The Russian Empire during the 19th century was highly interested
in the current events and political changes which were developing in
Persia, especially those events surrounding the appearance of the Bábí
and Bahá’í Faiths. As we know Persia has always been a strategic
concern of Russia’s geopolitical interests and this traditional
importance, which has been given to Iran has materialized itself in
hundreds if not thousands of documents and writings collected by the
pre-revolutionary Russian government. Among these materials, which
were constantly flowing into the Russian Empire, was information
about and original Writings of these two emerging religions.
Fortunately this information was supplied regularly and systematized
by the Russian diplomats and scholars working in Persia. Among these
Russian diplomats were also trained Orientalists, who could rightly
ascertain their significance. This paper is a brief introduction to the
work and materials collected by these remarkable men.

Promine nt Figures

The work of gathering, preserving, identifying, classifying,
studying, translating and publishing the materials on the Bábí and
Bahá’í Faiths was conducted by numerous people but the most
prominent of these were A.G. Tumanski (1861-1920), both a scholar
and a diplomat, and Baron V.R. Rosen (1849-1908), a pure scholar.
Some of the other notable figures were scholars like Professor V.A.
Zhukovski and B. Dorn, and diplomats F.A. Bakulin, M. Bezobrazoff
and M.A. Gamazoff. The latter was the Head of the School of
Oriental Languages of the Asian Department of the Foreign Affairs
Ministry. A substantial contribution to the collection of manuscripts
and especially that of lithographs was made by a prominent scholar,
W. A. Ivanow.

It would be fair to say that Russian scholars became acquainted
with the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh before they found out about
Bahá’u’lláh Himself.1 Nevertheless, Russian was the first European
language into which the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh were translated.
Among these translations, the first and foremost is Tumanski’s
translation of the Most Holy Book by Bahá’u’lláh (see below).

Rosen (1849-1908) must be given special credit for classifying,
identifying and describing the manuscripts, and establishing the
Russian Geographical Society. He also edited a periodical journal
“Notes of the Oriental Department of the Russian (Royal)
Archeological Society”, known under its abbreviated title ZVORAO
(Zapiski Vostochnogo Otdeleniya Rossiyskogo Arkheologicheskogo
Obshestva), where his and Tumanski’s translations of Bahá’í texts
were published. This journal covered a large range of subjects
including: history, linguistics, religion, and culture.

Tumanski (1861-1920) was a graduate of the School of Oriental
Languages of the Asian Department of the Foreign Affairs Ministry,
where he studied languages under M. A. Gamazoff’s instruction. He
ended his career as a Major-General of the Russian army, but he was
also an orientalist (iranologist and turkologist). He knew Persian,
Arabic and Turkish. Not much is known about his biography, for he
left Russia after the Bolsheviks took over in 1917 and wasn’t
considered by the ruling regime as one deserving notice. What is
known about him is that for a certain period of his life he was in
Ashkabad where he came into close contact with the Bahá’í
community there and ever since was keenly interested in everything
which concerned the Bahá’ís. He died in emigration in the Prince’s
Islands (near Constantinople). After his death his widow moved to
Belgium. His descendents live in that country.2

We know that as early as in 1877, the first part of Writings of
Bahá’u’lláh was delivered to Russia’s General Consul in (Persian)
Azerbayjan by M. Bezobrazoff and addressed to the Library of the
Educational Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through
M. A. Gamazoff.

Right from the beginning of Rosen’s description of the Tablets he
discerned the special character of the 29 Epistles as well as
distinguished their marked difference from the early Writings of the
Báb. This is not surprising when we consider that among his many
accomplishments, Rosen is credited with the founding of a new
school of Orientalism, which focused on the study of primary sources.
His study of the texts led him to the conclusion that “All the Epistles
should more or less be considered as revelations”3.

As early as 1877, Rosen describes these 29 Tablets (alwá˙), first in
Vol. I. of the Collections Scientifiques and later in 1908, along with a

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven          77

number of other Tablets and Epistles by Bahá’u’lláh, in a copious
volume titled Sbornik poslanii Babída Bahaulláha (A Volume of
Epistles of Bahá’u’lláh, the Bábí). Published by Baron. V/ R. Rosen.
St.-Petersburg, 1908. (see below).

Rosen published a detailed description of the manuscripts, often
illustrated with large abstracts from the original texts in French, in the
Collections Scientifiques de L’Institute des Langues Orientales du
Ministère des Affaires étrangères. Volumes. 1, 3, and 6,4 which was
later to became known as the Collection of the St. Petersburg Branch
of the Institute of Oriental Studies under the Russian Academy of
Sciences. Unfortunately, the materials, which were added to the
collection after Rosen’s death, are not included in this catalogue.

The Origin of the Bábí and Bahá’í Materials Collection
of the St. Petersburg Branch of the Institute of
Oriental Studies, Russian Academy of Sciences

The majority of Bábí and Bahá’í materials collected during the 19th
century ended up in St. Petersburg, the capital of the Russian
Empire5. Eventually, these materials were distributed between the
following three learning centers: The St. Petersburg Branch of the
Institute of Oriental Studies under the Russian Academy of Sciences
(formerly the Asiatic Museum), the National Library (formerly the
Public Library) and the Oriental Faculty of St. Petersburg State
University. The largest of these collections is in the abovementioned
St. Petersburg Branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies, which for
the most part this paper concerns6.

The St. Petersburg 19th Century Orientalist Collection of materials
on the Bábí and Bahá’í Faiths consists of manuscripts, lithographs and
published materials. The most significant of these can be divided
between the (1) the Writings of the Báb, the Prophet-Founder of the
Bábí Faith who was Bahá’u’lláh’s Forerunner and (2) the Writings of
Bahá’u’lláh, the Founder of the Bahá’í Faith.

In this paper I will further distinguish the materials into two broad
groups: primary sources (PS) and secondary sources (SS). PS are
manuscripts or publications of manuscripts of the Writings (with and
without translations), and SS are manuscripts and publications of
other materials like eyewitness accounts and historical documents
about the Bábí and Bahá’í Faiths. The materials are organized in the
following manner. First, I list the PS for the Báb, which are
unpublished7, I then treat the PS for Bahá’u’lláh which are also
unpublished. Second, I list the PS for Bahá’u’lláh, which are
published. Third, are writings (PS) of Bahá’u’lláh’s son — Abdu’l-
Bahá. Fourth, are the SS for Bábí and Bahá’í histories.

The majority of the manuscripts below, whether in Persian or
Arabic as well as the lithographs belong to the collection of The St.
Petersburg Branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies under the
Russian Academy of Sciences, therefore, unless otherwise indicated,
are to be found in three major catalogues and I have organized my
paper starting with the first, second and third respectively. However,
whenever it is necessary to specify the first two catalogues I will refer
to them by their short titles: The Concise Persian MS Catalogue
(PMS) and The Concise Arabic MS Catalogue (AMS). I also make
reference to some materials listed in the Collections Scientifiques . . .
and A Catalogue of Lithographs in Persian Preserved in the Library of
the Oriental Faculty of the St. Petersburg State University.

Please note that all the manuscripts and lithographs are listed and
briefly described according to their language of origin, either Persian
or Arabic.

The following are the three principle catalogues to the Collection.

The catalogues names are given in Russian, but the catalogue itself is
organized according to the works’ heading, which is in Persian or
Arabic:
•   Persidskie i tadzikskiye rukopisi Instituta Vostokovedeniia

> Rossiiskoi Akademii Nauk (A concise catalogue of the
> manuscripts in Persian, preserved at the St. Petersburg
> Branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies under the
> Russian Academy of Sciences, in two volumes), short name
> The Concise Persian MS Catalogue (PMS);8
•   Arabskiye rukopisi Instituta Vostokovedeniia Akademii

> Nauk SSSR. Kratkii katalog (A concise catalogue of the
> manuscripts in Arabic, preserved at the St. Petersburg
> Branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies under the
> Russian Academy of Sciences, in two volumes), short name:

Review of Ma terials

We go on now to the review of the materials. The first number in
each listing stands for the sequential number in the related Catalogue,
while the second number in parenthesis is the code under which the
given manuscript or lithograph is registered under.

I. Unpublished lithographs and manuscripts,
described or registered in Catalogues
1) The Writings of the Báb, the Forerunner of Bahá’u’lláh (1819-1850)
a) The Persian Bayán (‘Bayán-i-Farsi’)12 — the major doctrinal

> work of the Báb. Written in Persian, it comprises 8000 verses
> and is divided into nine sections called Vahids (lit.: ‘units’), of
> 19 chapters each, except for the last which has ten chapters.
The Institute has 2 manuscripts of the Persian Bayán:
i)   #392 (A 458)-PMS. The manuscript is a gift to the

> Institute of Oriental Languages by Russia’s General Consul
> in Astrabad (Northern Iran) F. A. Bakulin, which was
> delivered on 4 April 1877. The manuscript has a
> dedication note. It consists of 394 lists and contains 9
> Vahids. The name of the copyist and the date are not
> mentioned. This manuscript is described by Baron V. R.
> Rosen in his Collections Scientifiques, Vol. III: Mss.
> Persans, pp. 4-13. The description is followed by a large
> extract from the Persian Bayán, containing the whole of
> the first Vahid. Baron Rosen also published there a list of
> the titles of the remaining eight Vahids of the Book. This
> manuscript is also mentioned by B. Dorn: [Mellanges
> Asiatiques, Vol. VII, 177];
ii) #393 (#439)-PMS. Another manuscript of the Persian

> Bayán, which is also a gift from F. G. Bakulin. This was
> received on 5 May 1874, as it follows from the note in the
> manuscript. The manuscript though written in a very clear
> hand is incomplete. It consists of 98 lists and contains only
7 Vahids, without the name of the copyist and the date.

> This manuscript is also mentioned by Baron Rosen in his
> description: Collections Scientifiques, Vol. III. Mss.

Persans, p. 3.
b) The Commentary on the Surih of Josef (Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’) —

> the first chapter of which was revealed in the presence of
> Mullá Óusayn (the first to believe in The Báb) on the evening
> of 22 May 1844. This event marked the Báb’s open
> declaration of His mission. Bahá’u’lláh described the
> Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’ as “the first, greatest, and mightiest of all
> books” of the Báb. Written in Arabic it consists of 9300
> verses and contains 111 chapters. Each of the chapters, except
> for the first, has a verse from the Surih of Josef in the Koran
> and the Báb’s commentary on it. A whole chapter is titled
> “Surih of Josef”.
> The Institute has two manuscripts of the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’.
> Both are beautifully performed, written in a clear hand, and in
> red ink. Neither of them bears the title. However, their
> identification as being manuscripts of the given work of the
> Báb is beyond any doubt (see below):
i)   #3169 (ca. 1167)-AMS. It has 158 lists. Not only does it

> fit into the above description of the content of the
> Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’ (for example, it has on f. 7A a chapter,
> titled “Surih of Josef”), in addition to that on f. 1b the
> work is referred to as: “The Best of Stories” (“Ahsanu’l-
> Qisas”), which, according to E. G. Browne, is but another
> name for the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’.13 Apart from the
> copyist’s postscript the manuscript contains a few others
> which all-together provide a clue to the history of the
> manuscript. It follows from the copyist’s postscript that
> the manuscript was finished in the month of Shawwal of
> 1297 A.H. (1880 A. D.). Below this there is a postscript by
> another hand saying: “What the copyist left out is that this
> noble book was, with God’s help, finished by humble,
> poor, rebellious, [yet] hoping for the Mercy of the Lord,
> the All-Sufficient, — Mu˙ammad Mahdi ibn Karbalayi
> Shah Karam in . . . the month of Jumadiu’l-Ula of 1261 of
> Hijra (1845 A.D.). May the Lord forgive the copyist, the
> reader and him who will ask God to forgive the copyist”.
> As it follows from another postscript (in Russian), the
> given manuscript is “a copy made from the original,
> preserved in the Library of Prince ‘Alí Quli Mírzá
> I‘tizadu’l-Saltanih, son of Fath ‘Alí Shah, [who was]
> Minister of Education”. It also says that the manuscript
was “a gift from I. Grigorovitch, presented on 12 August

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven         81

> 1880 — 17 Ramadan 1297 A. H.” Thus, putting together
> all this information contained in the postscripts, it is fair
> to conclude that the manuscript dated 1880 was a direct
> copy of a much earlier manuscript, written in 1845 (only a
> year after the Báb’s proclamation of his mission in 1844!),
> made by a copyist named Mu˙ammad Mahdi ibn Karbalayi
> Shah Karam.
ii) #3070 (B 1141)-AMS. Another manuscript of the same

> Writing, consisting of 252 lists. Unlike the previous MS.
> this is described in detail by Baron V. R. Rosen in the first
> volume of his Collections . . .14 with the publication of a
> number of extracts. As Baron V. R. Rosen points out, the
> given MS is without a title, divided into 111 chapters,
> each beginning with the words: ‘in the name of God the
> Merciful, the Compassionate’ and except for the first
> chapter contains a verse from the Koranic Surih of Josef.
> These characteristics, after comparing the text with E. G.
> Browne’s description of a manuscript of the Commentary
> on the Surih of Josef, enabled Bar. Rosen to identify the
> work as the famous Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’. In his description
> he even traced the Koranic verse of each chapter of the
> Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’ back to the Koran15.
> The manuscript was a gift from M. Bezobrazoff,
> presented on 4 April 1877. It is undated and has no
> mention of the copyist.
c) ‘Two Suras from the Koran of the Báb’. #3071 (C1660)

> AMS. A manuscript of 52 lists, consisting of 4 texts in Arabic:
> ff. 1b-24b, 25a-32a, 32a-50b, 50b-52b. In the Concise Arabic
> MS Catalogue is designated as: Two Suras from the Koran of
> the Báb. The style of all the four texts is that of divine
> revelations, therefore they could only proceed out of the pen
> of either the Báb or Bahá’u’lláh.
> The first one can with certainty be identified as the Surih-i-
> Baqara of the Báb, described by E. G. Browne in the “27 Bábí
> Manuscripts” (p. 498). The last text mentions the word/name
> “Bahá” (“the light of Bahá” etc) several times, and also the
> ghiyas and the mustaghas.
> F.1 has a memorial note from V. A. Zhukovski, a date: 1919;
> and a number: 82.
d) Untitled and undated manuscript in Arabic consisting of 87

> lists. #3073 (A 923) AMS.
It has a postscript in Russian on the last page, from which it is

> “Bought in Isfahan 24/11 VII 1910. W. Ivanow”, while a note

> of the verses says: “Enter ye the house from the side of the
> Gate (the Báb) on the great and glorious path”, while another
> runs as follows: “We have already ordained unto you in the
> Book of Precepts . . . ”. The latter is a well-known Writing of
> the Báb, translated into French by M. Compte de Gobineau.
> A curious note in Persian, definitely not in the copyist’s hand,
> on the inner side of the cover not only dispels the last doubt

> and the Prophet’s praise be on the guardian of the book

2) The Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, Prophet-Founder of the Bahá’í Faith

> (1819-1892)
a) The Book of Certitude (Kitáb-i-ˆqán) — A Volume in Persian

> revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in Baghdad about two years before
> His declaration of His Mission. In it Bahá’u’lláh among other
> things proclaims and substantiates some key principles of the
> Bahá’í teachings, such as the oneness of God, the progressive
> revelation etc, explains the station and mission of the Prophet-
> founders of world religions (manifestations of God’s will), the
> spiritual meaning of prophecies about the return of Christ, the
> coming of the Qa’im, presents the essential qualities of the
‘true seeker’ of religious truth.

> The lithograph was printed in Bombay in 1310 A. H.(1893
> A.D.) and is described in the Catalogue of Lithographed

> supplement to my academic translation of The Book of
> Certitude into Russian, which came out recently.25 The main

> meaning of the sentence, much less so on the Book as a whole.
> The most beautifully and carefully accomplished are
> manuscripts A 183 and A 461, made upon a common pattern.
b) ‘Baháyiyih’. #384 (ca. 1168- ) PMS. This is a volume of 60

> lists, registered in the Concise Persian MS Catalogue under the
> general title: Baháyiyih. It contains four short Epistles in
> Arabic (ff. 1a-2a; 2a-3b; 3b-7a; 7a-13b) and a much longer
> one in Persian (ff. 13b-60b). Of this latter the above
> Catalogue says that “the treatise deals with and elaborates on
the issues explained in the other Bahá’í work — [the Kitáb-i-

> ]ˆqán. It is composed in the form of an epistle”. All the
> epistles are written in Bahá’u’lláh’s style, though only in the
> one in Persian, which is written in answer to the question “how
> it was possible for the Supreme Letters to be turned into those
> who were doomed for the bottom of hell (Sajjin)” does
> Bahá’u’lláh mention His name, Óusayn, and refers to the
> Bayán of the Báb as “[having been] sent down from the
> Heaven of My previous Manifestation” (f. 16a). The
> addressee is mentioned by name once — ‘Alí (f. 22b), while
> there is also one reference to Jinab Siyyid Jawad (f. 26a).

One of the texts makes mention of “this great prison” (f. 7b).
c) ‘Law˙-i-Bábí’. #3072 (А185) AMS. This one page epistle in

> Arabic, is a text with a beautifully decorated ornament frame,
> and has an intriguing history. The Epistle is registered in the
> Concise Arabic MS Catalogue as “Law˙-i-Bábí”. It is not
> described in the Collections Scientifiques, probably because it
> was received after Baron V. R. Rosen’s death. It is contained
> in an envelope with several explanatory notes (in Russian) on
> separate sheets of paper, enclosed together with the
> manuscript. The note, written probably by A. G. Tumanski,
> says that the Epistle “is undoubtedly of Bábí origin”, “obscure
> in language and mystical in nature”, “is composed in rhymed
> prose”, “it’s author is definitely Bahá’u’lláh”, “containing,
> quite probably, some historical allusions in the end”, “every
> second phrase in the Epistle has invariably the refrain: ‘fa
> subhana rabbi-l-‘ala’”, which “in one instance only is replaced
> by: ‘fa subhana rabbana-l-‘ala”. “From the standpoint of its
> language and style it is most similar to the ‘Alwá˙u-l-Salatin’
> and to the ‘Suratu-l-Haykal’”. The author of the note cites
> certain phrases from this Epistle and the above Tablets to
> highlight this similarity.
> Another, much shorter explanatory note, written by another
> person, tells us a little about the history of this Epistle in
> Russia: “Assistant professor Khilinski, uncle of General von .. .
> (a German name, unclearly written) brought from Mashhad
> (the name of this city is written in Persian) [and] presented as
> a gift the letter of . . . himself”. The name preceding the word
> “himself” could be read as “Bahá’”. If this assumption is
> correct, the writer of this note thought the Epistle to be
> written in Bahá’u’lláh’s hand. This impression is confirmed by
> the logical emphasis on the word “himself” which wouldn’t be
> the case if the words just implied that the Epistle was a work
> of Bahá’u’lláh.
Also enclosed into the envelope is a visiting card, which says:

> “Konstantin Vladimirovitch Khilinski”.
> The manuscript was supposedly joined to the Institute MS
> Collection in the 90’s of the XIXth century.
> The Epistle itself, written in tiny letters, left no room for
> doubt that it belonged to Bahá’u’lláh. The author of the note,
> which I quoted earlier, was absolutely right saying that the
> epistle was not to be found among the materials, published by
> Baron V. Rosen or E. G. Browne. It turned out to be the
> famous Tablet of Bahá’u’lláh: The Tablet of the Holy Mariner
> (Law˙-i-Malláh-i-Quds) in Arabic, revealed on 26 March
> 1863. When I compared the MS in question with the photo of
> the manuscript of the same Tablet, preserved in the Bahá’í
> World Centre (the photo was printed in M. Sours’ “The Tablet
> of the Holy Mariner”, both the manuscripts seemed to me
> written by exactly the same hand. Since the MS in Haifa was
> written by Abdu’l-Bahá, the MS in St. Petersburg must also
> have been written by Abdu’l-Bahá. This is my tentative
> conclusion till it is confirmed by the Research Department of
> the Bahá’í World Centre. In any case in certain instances its
> text is closer to the English translation of the Tablet, made by
> Shoghi Effendi, than that of the MS in Haifa.
d) Bahá’í prayers in Arabic. #3077 (A 182). It has 164 lists and

> (F. 1a.) contains an explanatory note by Baron V. R. Rosen:

Empire:

II. Published manuscripts
1) The Writings of Bahá’u’lláh
a) Kitáb-i-Aqdas (“The Most Holy Book”) — the major Bahá’í

> Writing, the importance of it for the Bahá’ís is not limited to
just the laws and ordinances set forth in it by Bahá’u’lláh.

> In the collection of the Institute there are three
> manuscripts of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (The Most Holy Book),
> all the three are preserved in an excellent state. None of
> them, however, can be identified with the one used by A.
> G. Tumanski for the publication and translation into
> Russian of the given Book (See below).
i)    #3073 (A 460). Consists of 45 lists. Dated 1300 A. H.

> (1882-1883 A.D.), as is indicated in the end of the
> manuscript. It does not contain the last verse, with the
> prohibition of the use of opium (“It hath been
> forbidden you to smoke opium”).
> The manuscript was described by Bar. V. R. Rosen in
> Collections ... VI, pp. 144-145, #246.
> The last page has a postscript with a dedication: “This is
> presented as a gift to his Excellency Matvey
> Avelyevitch Gamazoff”. Signed: I. Grigorovitch. On
> 12 July 1888.
> A little below a note from M. A. Gamazoff says:
> “Gamazoff has delivered it to the Library of the School
> of Oriental Languages on 6 Sept. [18]88”. Signed:
> Gamazoff;
ii) #3074 (A 975). Consists of 80 lists. The manuscript has

> the text of the Most Holy Book in full (including the
last verse).

There is a postscript in Persian in the end: “Has been

> collated with special care with the new manuscript on 1
> Jamadi 1306 A. H. (1888-1889 A.D.)”.
> The last page has a dedication note in Russian: “Is
> presented as a gift to the Library of the School of
> Oriental Languages by G. D. Batyushkoff in 1906”.
> This (the fact of its joining the collection so late)
> explains why the given manuscript was not described by
> Baron V. R. Rosen.
iii) #3075 (A 497). Consists of 44 lists. Contains the text

> of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in full. The text of The Most
> Holy Book is followed by a Bahá’í marital prayer on 2
> pages (the latter is registered in the Concise Arabic MS
> Catalogue under a separate sequential number: 3082;
> the code is the same). The manuscript is undated.

> The manuscript bears a stamp: Library of the School of
> Oriental Languages of the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
> A dedication note says: “Presented as a gift to the
> Library of the School of Oriental Languages in 1906”.
> The original text of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas with Russian
> translation was preceded by a large and very
> informative introductory article, dealing among other
> things with the history of the Bahá’í religion, published
> by A.G. Tumanski in 1899.
> For the history of this translation and publication it is
> best to quote (in our translation) an extract from A. G.
> Tumanski’s above introductory article: “Finally, the
> third volume, which included the “Most Holy Book” —
> the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, which I present now to the reader,
> was lithographed in 1892 (1308 A. H.) in Bombay, and
> I received the first copies of it in early November 1893.
> This was during the time when I was finishing the
> translation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas from the manuscript,
> obtained by me in 1890, consequently, I felt the need
> to collate its text with the canonical edition of the
> Kitáb-i-Aqdas. The present edition is based on the
> latter [canonical] edition, while the differences
> between this version and my manuscript are marked:
> my manuscript version is designated by the letter P”26.
> Thus, as it follows from this account, A. G. Tumanski
> first made his translation from his own manuscript,
> which he then collated with the official edition of the
text, sent to him in an lithographed form, making the

> latter the basis for his publication of the original text
> and the final version of his Russian translation of the
> Most Holy Book. As for A. G. Tumanski’s own
> manuscript, which he mentions in the above quote, he
> also makes reference to its description by Baron V. R.
> Rosen27. Unfortunately, that reference proved
> incorrect. So, his manuscript is not registered in any
> Catalogue, and nothing is known about it as well as
> about the lithographical edition of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas,
> which he used (see also below).
b) Among the scholarly publications of Bahá’í original texts a

> prominent place is occupied by a copious volume of the
> Tablets and Epistles of Bahá’u’lláh, prepared for publi-
> cation from different manuscripts by Baron V. R. Rosen,
> whose sudden death interrupted this work and did not
> allow him to carry the project through.28 Its publication,
> however, was accomplished by Baron V. R. Rosen’s college
> — P. Kokovtseff, who supplied the Volume with an intro-
> duction, which he humbly titled: “Instead of Introduction”.
> In the Introduction he provided us with some important
> clues to the history of the Volume and its sources.
> Thus, we find out from the Introduction, that the texts,
> included into the Volume, were drawn from two
> manuscripts. One of them (under the code B1142, see its
> description below) attracted Baron V. R. Rosen’s attention
> back in 1877, when, making a description of the newly
> obtained manuscripts, he for the first time became closely
> familiar with the Writings of the Central figures of the
> new religion. The above manuscript, presented by M.
> Bezobrazoff, consisted of 29 Tablets in Arabic by a writer,
> named Huseyn [Huseyn ‘Alí Nuri = Bahá’u’lláh], who was
> at the time unknown to Baron V. R. Rosen. One should
> bear in mind, that as A. G. Tumanski rightly pointed out,
> the knowledge of Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings preceded the
> knowledge of Bahá’u’lláh himself in Russian academic
> circles (see above). Therefore, it took a great effort on
> Baron V. R. Rosen’s part to identify the author of these
> Tablets and Epistles. Among the latter there was one (N
> 20), untitled, as all the others and addressed to the kings,
> which was later identified to be the Tablet of Kings or the
> Suriy-i-Muluk. Its comparison with another manuscript,
> namely that of the Commentary on the Surih of Josef (see
> above) by the Báb, enabled Baron V. R. Rosen to make a
> provisional but none the less correct conclusion that the
author of the Epistle in question ‘could in no way be the

Báb himself, as long as the preceding manuscript [i.e. the
Commentary on the Surih of Josef] really proceeded out
of the pen of the reformer [i.e. the Báb]’.29 Later the
Library of the Educational Department of Oriental
Languages received a new group of writings (MS code: A
459, old code: 247, see its description below), among
which Baron V. R. Rosen discovered another copy of the
same Tablet N 20 of the earlier manuscript. This time the
text was titled: ‘Suriy-i-Muluk’ (Tablet of Kings). This
wondrous find enabled Baron V. R. Rosen to identify the
author of the Tablet as Bahá’u’lláh, in spite of E. G.
Browne’s opinion, thinking at the time otherwise. Later E.
G. Browne, a prominent scholar of Babism had to agree
with Baron V. R. Rosen’s brilliant arguments30 and even
reproduce them in English in his article.31
This also prompted Baron V. R. Rosen to publish the whole
manuscript with all the 29 Tablets and Epistles by
Bahá’u’lláh in Arabic. The latter occupy the first half of
the Volume (the text of the Tablet of Kings was published
from both the manuscripts, see below), while the second
half of the book presents 34 other Epistles of Bahá’u’lláh,
including the Tablet of Nasir (Law˙-i-Nasir), from Baron
V. R. Rosen’s own manuscript, which makes the total
number of the texts in the Volume — 63. This latter
manuscript, belonging to Baron V. R. Rosen, unfortunately
is not yet found. All we know about it is that it was dated 9
Sha’ban [12]97 A. H. (17 July 1880) and contained 34
Epistles, half of which were in Persian, half in Arabic. The
manuscript was untitled, Bahá’u’lláh’s authorship of the
Epistles was confirmed by the cryptogram 152 at the end
of the manuscript, which equals the numerical value of the
name Bahá’, according to the abjad system. This was also
figured out by Baron V. R. Rosen. P. Kokovtseff, who
accomplished the publication of the Volume, after Baron
V. R. Rosen’s death, points out that the manuscript was
given to him for temporary use, owing to Prof.
Zhukovski’s help. To conclude, thus, before obtaining a
titled copy of the Tablet of Kings, Baron V. R. Rosen by
using convincing arguments, such as the cryptogram 152 =
Bahá’, similarities of passages between the Tablet of Kings
and the Epistle to the Queen of England, from the
Alwá˙u-l-Salatin and etc., already proved that the author
of the Tablet of Kings was Bahá’u’lláh.
Baron V. R. Rosen also published in full some other
Epistles of Bahá’u’lláh (see below).

c) Untitled work. #3079 (B 1142) AMS. This is a volume of

> 29 Epistles of Bahá’u’lláh in Arabic. These form the first
> part of Baron V. R. Rosen’s published Volume, previously
> referred to.32 The manuscript consists of 72 lists and

7) ‘Majmu‘ih’. #3853 (A 716) PMS. A manuscript of 18 lists with

> poetry in Persian, registered in the Concise Persian MS Catalogue
> under the title: Majmu‘ih. The above catalogue describes it in the
> following way: “The volume contains two short masnavis, a
> fragment of a masnavi and two qasidas. The first [masnavi] has
> 182 verses, the second — 212 verses. The manuscript is dated 20
> Sha‘ban 1270 A. H. (1853-1854 A.D.]. Probably, this masnavi is
> titled ‘Saha’if’”.
> This dating is obviously derived from the added note on the last
> page (f. 18b), written in a hand different from the poetical text
> itself. The note, addressing “God’s people”, calls on them to
> peruse and know the worth of “these pages” (saha‘if, varaqat),
> for, it says, “the day of the greatest testimony is close (yawm-i-
> shahadat-i-akbar nazdik ast)”. It also mentions the day on which
> the manuscript was finished: Thursday, the twentieth day of the
> month of Sha‘ban, year 127 ?. The last figure seems to be missing
> or at least not to be clearly seen. It looks to us highly unlikely that
> the year 1270 A.H., corresponding to 1853-1854 A.D. could be
> the correct date. The main theme of the poetry in the volume is
> bringing glad tidings of and rejoicing at [the revelation] of Bahá,
> whose “visible countenance has arisen” and who “has torn asunder
> the veils”. These metaphors as well as the subject itself are more
> relevant to the time after the declaration by Bahá’u’lláh of his
> Mission in 1279 A.H (1863 A.D).
> Some verses are         preceded    by    introductory    notes    and
> admonishments.

Conclusion

The main imperative of Russian pre-Revolutionary scholars, who
observed the advents of both the Bábí and Bahá’í Faiths was to deeply
study and comprehend these new phenomena. The rich collection of
materials, which they brought together were all accumulated during
the decades prior to the Bolshevik take over in 1917. Pre-
Revolutionary scholars should also be recognized for their scientific
approach, which contributed greatly to the value of their research and

publications and have preserved their significance up to this very day.
Unfortunately, this balanced scientific approach to Religious Studies
was replaced with an extremely political one during Soviet times.
Religion in general was considered “the opium of the people” and it
could only be approached in a highly biased and negative manner, so
the conclusion to be arrived at in the course of a scholarly study was
predetermined from the beginning. These circumstances detracted a
lot from the motivation of scholars interested in the subject, since a
thorough research of any original material on religion lost much of its
significance, while at the same time the publication of primary sources
became useless. Consequently, starting in 1918 these materials were
practically ignored. This doesn’t mean that they were not taken proper
care of. On the contrary, in the all of the learning centers of the
former Soviet Union, manuscripts and lithographs, regardless of their
content, had always been provided with the best conditions possible
for their preservation. In general, the situation regarding scientific
research started to change in the late 80s and early 90s. Now much can
be done in the field of Religious Studies in general and that of Bábí
and Bahá’í studies in particular, so this collection will be of great
importance to contemporary and future scholars.
