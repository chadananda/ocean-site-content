Bahá’u’lláh produced a great amount of Writings, “a hundred volumes”
writes Shoghi Effendi (PDC 6). They are the core of Bahá’í Scripture.

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

Most of Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings are in prose, only a few of them are
in poetry. All these poetic works were seemingly written in the Iraqi
period. Only one of them may have been completed in Adrianople.

Scripture and poetry
All religions have sacred Texts written in poetry. Some of the poetical
passages of the Scriptures of the various religions have become popular
even outside the circles of their respective followers. Hindu Scriptures
are very rich in poems. The Rig Veda and the Mahabharata (ca.500
BC) are written in poetry. The well-known Bhagavad Gita (Song of
God), a part of the Mahabharata, is a poem, comprising 700 verses.
As to Buddhism, the Dhammapada, the Theravada Jatakas and the
Buddhacharita (‘Acts of the Buddha’) are poems. As to Zoroastrian-
ism, many scholars think that Zarathustra was a poet-priest. The five
Gathas, a word variously rendered as ‘Hymns’, ‘poems’, or ‘psalms’,
supposedly composed by Zarathustra Himself (see Boyce, Textual
Sources 2), and the 24 (Boyd, “Zoroastrianism” 110) or 21 (Gnoli, “La
religione zoroastriana” 504) Yashts are poems. As to the Old Testa-
ment, three books of the Ketuvim, also known as Hagiographa, that
is Psalms, Lamentations and Song of Songs, are grouped by the Jews
under the name of ‘Poetry Books’. As to the New Testament, although
verses are not included in its canonical texts, there are a number of
passages of poetical beauty, as for example the so called ‘Song of Mary’,
also known as Magnificat, from the incipit of its Latin version (Luke
1:46–54, KJV), one of the eight most ancient Christian hymns. As to
Islam, the Qur’án is not versified, but some of its pages sound, to our
ears, as highly poetical. The poems written by Imám ‘Alí also are part
of the religious Islamic tradition. The Bahá’ís are familiar with two
verses by Imám ‘Alí, because they are quoted at the beginning of The
Secret of Divine Civilization: “Dost thou think thyself only a puny form,
when the universe is folded up within thee?” (SDC 19).

Bahá’u’lláh’s Persian Poems

Poetical Writings by Bahá’u’lláh

The poems written by Bahá’u’lláh, which the present writer has found
in the main collections of Bahá’u’lláh’s Arabic and Persian Writings
available to the general public or whose existence is mentioned in
public documents, are as follows.

> 1. Rashḥ-i-‘Amá’:3 Shoghi Effendi writes that this poem, composed of
> twenty one-rhymed couplets, was "revealed in Ṭihrán," and is among
"the first fruits of… [Bahá’u’lláh’s] Divine Pen" (GPB 121). Therefore

it may date back to His incarceration in the Síyáh-Chál. Rashḥ-i-
‘Amá was translated by Stephen N. Lambden, an English Bahá’í

> scholar focusing on Shi‘i Islam and Qajar Persia, early Shaykhism,
> the Writings of the Báb, the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, under the tile
> of ‘Sprinkling of the Cloud of Unknowing’.4 Ramin Neshati, who
> also translated other Bahá’í Writings, wrote an introduction and
> translation of this poem, which he called ‘Tablet of the Mist of the
> Unknown’.5 Juan R. Cole, American historian of the modern Middle
> East and South Asia, translated it as ‘Sprinkling of the Cloud Beyond
> Being’.6 John Wiegley, a former student of philosophy at George
> Mason University, a poet, and a student of mysticism and of the Seven
> Valleys (2003), also translated it, as ‘The pre-eternal Reality poureth
> forth from Our ecstasy’.7

2–10. Eight poems, published by the Iranian Bahá’í scholar
`Abdu’l-Ḥamíd Ishráq Khávarí (1902–1972) in his multi-volume

> anthology of the Writings of the ‘Central Figures’ of the Bahá’í
> Faith Má’idiy-i-Asmání (4:176–211). Ishráq Khávarí in reality
> quotes the text of ten poems, because he also gives the texts of
> the above mentioned Rashḥ-i-‘Amá and of Qaṣídiy-i-Varqá’íyyih,
> an ode of 127 verses written in Arabic. Excerpts from these and
> other poems of Bahá’u’lláh are also included by the Iranian Bahá’í
> scholar Mírzá Asadu’lláh Fáḍil Mázandárání (ca.1880–1957), in
> his Taríkh Ẓuhúru’l-Ḥaqq (History of the Manifestation of Truth),

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

a nine volume history of the Bábí and Bahá’í religions (4:141–42).
These poems have been most probably written in Kurdistan, where

> Bahá’u’lláh remained from 10 April 1854 to 19 March 1856 and,
> in `Abdu’l-Bahá’s words, “lived in poverty”, wearing the “garments…
> of the poor and needy” and eating the “food… of the indigent and
> lowly” (Quoted in GPB 124). The attribution of the drafting of
> these poems to the years of His stay in Kurdistan, during which
> He was in touch with the local Sufi communities, seems confirmed
> by their takhallus, the nom de plume introduced in the final verse of
> the poems according to the use of Persian lyrics. All these poems
> are signed ‘dervish’ and in that period Bahá’u’lláh had adopted
> the surname of Darvísh Muḥammad. Three of these poems are
> mentioned in the Bahá’í World volumes among ‘Bahá’u’lláh Best
> Known Writings’: Báz áv-u bi-dih jámí, Qaṣídiy-i-Varqá’íyyih,
> and Sáqí az Ghayb-i-Baqá. A provisional rhyming translation of
> Qaṣídiy-i-Varqá’íyyih has been undertaken by Cole, with the title
‘Ode of the Dove’. 8 Brian Miller has published an unrhymed poetic

> version of this Ode in his Ph.D. dissertation (U.C. Berkeley, 2000).
> Franklin D. Lewis, an expert in Persian Language and Literature,
> especially Rúmí, has offered three different translations of Sáqí az
> Ghayb-i-Baqá (‘Short Poem’ 86–9). Some of these poems, that is
> Bí jánán ján hamí daryaft, Sáqí bidih ábí, Mast-and bulbulán, are
> mentioned, and a few of their verses translated, by Lambden in his
‘Sinaitic Mysteries’ (116–7).

11\. Ay Bulbulán:9 This eleven verses poem, without takhallus, is
ascribed by Fáḍil-i Mazandarání to the Kurd period (Taríkh Ẓuhúru’l-
Ḥaqq 4:142). A partial translation of this poem is authored by Cole.10

12. Mathnavíy-i-Mubárak:11 According to Lewis this 318 verses poem
"was evidently composed over a period of time, beginning perhaps as

> early as his retreat to Iraqi Kurdistan, and certainly by his time in
> Baghdad, but completed only after his arrival in Istanbul" (‘Short
> Poem’ 83). He suggests that this work "is apparently the longest

Bahá’u’lláh’s Persian Poems

work he composed in verse, and perhaps also one of the last, though
the dating of many of his books, tablets, poems and his voluminous
correspondence remains rather tentative" (‘Poetry as Revelation’
103). A provisional verse translation with annotations of this poem
made by the same Lewis and accompanied by an introduction has
been published in 2000.12

13\. The Research Department of the Universal House of Justice
mentions in one of its letters a Tablet by Bahá’u’lláh that begins with
the words, "In My Name, the Humourist [al-mazzah] [provisional
translation]”. The Research Department clarifies that this Tablet

> is a serious mystical poem, revealed in the form of a prayer.
> The text does not illuminate the reference to the ‘Humourist’.
> It is, however, interesting to note that, while dealing with
> an exalted theme, the language of expression is, unexpect-
> edly, that of the common people—light, simple, and even
> colloquial.13

This Tablet has been recently published by Vahid Rafati, director of
the Research Department at the Bahá’í World Centre, in his book
Yádnámiy-i-Baydáy-i-Núrá (171).

14\. A poem beginning with the words Sáqí, bi-dih án jám-i-Huva Hú
(Quoted in Rafatí, Yádnámih 170)

In conclusion we have found 14 poems written by Bahá’u’lláh. Only one
of these poems is in Arabic, Qaṣídiy-i-Varqá’íyyih. Only Mathnavíy-i-
Mubárak was completed when Bahá’u’lláh had already left Iraq.14

As to the Writings by Bahá’u’lláh listed by Lewis among those, which
“observe some, but not all, of the rules of classical metrics and prosody

[and]… transcend the category of rhymed prose [nathr-i Musajja’] and

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

exhibit litany-like features that might be classed as a form of versifica-
tion [nazm) or quasi-verse” (‘Short Poem’ 83)’, they comprise:15

1\. Subḥana Rabbíya’l-A‘lá:16 This 45 verses Tablet, written in Arabic,
part in prose and part in poetry, was composed in Baghdad and trans-
lated by Cole as ‘Praised be My Lord, the Most High’.17 Taherzadeh
writes about it:

> He portrays in dramatic terms the appearance before Him
> of the ‘Maid of Heaven’, personifying the ‘Most Great Spirit’,
> and alludes to His own Revelation in such terms as no pen
> can describe. The whole Tablet conveys in symbolic language
> the joyous tidings of the advent of the Day of God, at the
> same time warning the faithful to beware of tests which will
> befall them, causing many to be deprived of attaining to His
> glory and grace. (Revelation 1:212)

2\. Lawḥ-i-Ghulámu’l-Khuld:18 This Tablet, written partly in Arabic
and partly in Persian, was written in the early 1860s in Baghdad “to
celebrate the anniversary of the Declaration of the Báb” (Taherzadeh
1:213) and translated by John Walbridge, an expert of Near Eastern
Languages and Cultures, as the ‘Tablet of the Deathless Youth’.19

3\. Ḥúr-i-‘Ujáb:20 This Tablet, written in Arabic, was composed in
Baghdad “as the year 1863 drew closer” (Taherzadeh 1:210). It was
translated by Cole as the ‘Houri of Wonder’21 and by Denis MacEoin,
a novelist and a former lecturer in Islamic studies, as ‘Litany by
Baha’Allah’ (Rituals 132–3), and commented upon by Walbridge
(Sacred Acts 239) and Taherzadeh (Revelation 1:218).

4\. Lawḥ-i-Malláḥu’l-Quds, ‘The Tablet of the Holy Mariner’:22 This
Tablet divided into two parts, one in Arabic and the other in Persian,
was revealed in Baghdad just before Naw Rúz 1863 (see GPB 147).
The Arabic part has been translated into English by Shoghi Effendi

Bahá’u’lláh’s Persian Poems

and originally published in Star of the West,23 with the following note,
“received in America in April 1922”. Michael W. Sours, who has

> authored several books dealing with the Bahá’í Faith and Christianity,
> has published a study of this Tablet.24

5\. Lawḥ-i-Bulbulu’l-Firáq:25 This Tablet, written in Arabic and Persian,
was composed, according to Ishráq Khávarí and Taherzadeh (Revela-
tion 1:244–5), in the late period of Baghdad and, according to Cole,
in Istanbul. Cole has translated it as ‘Nightingale of Separation’.26
Taherzadeh writes about it: “Bahá’u’lláh reminds His loved ones
that the period of union has come to an end, that the Nightingale
of Paradise has taken its flight from one branch and is now about to
establish its nest on another” (Revelation 1:244–5).

6\. Az Bágh-i-Ilahí:27 According to Taherzadeh this ode, composed by
31 couples of verses, one in Persian and one in Arabic, was "revealed
not long before the Declaration of Bahá’u’lláh" (Revelation 1:218).

7\. Lawḥ-i-Halih, Halih, Halih, Yá Bishárat:28 This 26 verses poem
was presumably revealed in the spring of 1863 in Baghdad, just a
short time before Bahá’u’lláh’s declaration in the Garden of Riḍván.29
A provisional translation of this poem was offered by Lambden in
1983\.30 Another more metrical version was made by Sen McGlinn,
the author of the so called Leiden list of Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablets.31

8\. A ‘Tablet of the Feast of Riḍván’:32 It is an Arabic Tablet translated
by Ali-Kuli Khan (ca.1879–1966), eminent Iranian Bahá’í and the
first to translate into English some of the most important works of
Bahá’u’lláh, and his daughter Marzieh Gail (1908–1993), an eminent
Bahá’í writer and translator, who wrote the following note: “This
tablet was revealed by Bahá’u’lláh when He Declared Himself to be
recited at the Feast of Ridwan”.33

9. Subḥánika-Yá-Hú, known as Lawḥ-i-Náqús:34 It is an Arabic Tablet
“revealed in Constantinople on the eve of the 5th of Jamádíyu’l-Avval

> 1280 A.H. (19 October 1863), the anniversary of the Declaration of
> the Báb” (Taherzadeh, Revelation 2:18). It was translated by MacEoin
> as the ‘Tablet of the Bell’ (Rituals 169–72) and by Lambden as the
‘Tablet of the Bell’.35

10\. Lawḥ-i-Ru’yá:36 Described by Shoghi Effendi as the “Tablet of
the Vision” (GPB 221), it was revealed in Arabic on the eve of 1
March 1873, in the House of ‘Údí Khammár in ‘Á kká, translated by
Lambden37 and Cole.38 An earlier translation of this Tablet appeared
in Bahá’í Scriptures, under the title ‘The Tablet of the Virgin’ (249–51,
sec. 525). Taherzadeh writes about it:

> In the Lawḥ-i-Ru’yá Bahá’u’lláh describes His vision of
> a Maiden dressed in white and illumined with the light of
> God. She entered the room in which Bahá’u’lláh was seated
> upon His throne of Lordship. She displayed an indescribable
> enthusiasm and devotion, circled around Him, was enrap-
> tured by the inebriation of His Presence, was thunderstruck
> at His Glory. And when she recovered, she remained in a
> state of bewilderment. She longed to offer up her life for her
> Beloved and finding Him captive in the hands of the unfaith-
> ful, she bade Him leave ‘Akká to its inhabitants and repair
> to His other dominions ‘whereon the eyes of the people of
> names have never fallen’, words which found their fulfilment
> nineteen years later with the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh. In the
> absence of a translation it is not possible to convey the beauty
> of the verses and the mystery of the subject revealed in the
> Lawḥ-i-Ru’yá. The theme of this Tablet is as enchanting as it
> is unfathomable and mysterious. (Revelation 3:223)

The contents of this Tablet is summarized by Walbridge as proph-
esizing “Bahá’u’lláh’s death” (Sacred 161).

Bahá’u’lláh’s Persian Poems

11\. Lawḥ-i Anta’l-Káfí, literally, Tablet of ‘Thou the Sufficing’,
known as the Long Healing Prayer:39 The authorized English
translation from the original Arabic of this Tablet was published
on 13 August 1980. 40

12\. Lawḥ-i-Qad-Iḥtaraqa’l-Mukhliṣún, known as ‘The Fire Tablet’
(Quoted in Risáliy-i-Taṣbíḥ va Tahlíl 219–24; Adí‘iy-i-Ḥaḍrat-i-Maḥbúb
169–79; INBA 30; Nafahat-i Faḍl 2): the authorized English trans-
lation from the original Arabic of this Tablet was published on 13
August 1980.41 It is discussed in Taherzadeh, Revelation 3:226–30;
Balyuzi, King 321–22; Cole, ‘Modernity’ 94.

> 13. A poetic composition beginning with the words Shams-i-jamál-i-
> iláhí (Quoted in INBA 32:31–4): this Arabic composition in rhyming
> prose is described by Lambden, who translated a part of it, as possibly
“written by Bahá’u’lláh for His disciple Darvísh Ṣ idq- ‘Alí Qazvíní”

> translated by Necati Alkan, an expert in Turkish Bahá’í Studies, in
> 2003–2007, as ‘Tablet on the Daystar of Divine Beauty’. 42

Possible reasons why Bahá’u’lláh composed His poems
It is very difficult for us to understand the reasons why Bahá’u’lláh
has decided to compose these poems, because it is impossible for us
to enter into a Mind so deep and incomparable. `Abdu’l-Bahá said
about it: ‘This universal mind is divine; it embraces existing realities,
and it receives the light of the mysteries of God’ (SAQ 218, sec. 58,
para.4). The following reflections are purely personal and exploratory.

First of all it seems that Bahá’u’lláh loved poetry very much. We
can deduce it from the numerous quotations from ancient poets He
introduced into His Works, especially the Seven Valleys and the
Four Valleys: Faríd ad-Dín ‘Aṭṭár (1117–1290), whose model of the
Seven Valleys He decided to reproduce and whose verses He quoted
in the Seven Valleys (SV8) and the Four Valleys (FV64); Khájih
Shamsu’d-Dín Muḥammad Ḥáfiẓ-i-Shírází (ca.1318–1390), whose
famous ghazal, “Sugar-shattering… have become all the parrots… of
Hindustan” (Dīvān 310, no.158, v.3), He quoted at the beginning of
His Tablet known as Lawḥ-i-Shikar-Shikan Shikand; Siyyid Aḥmad
Hátif (unknown–1783), whose verses He quoted in the Seven Val-
leys (SV12, 38); ‘Umar Ibn al-Fáriḍ (1182–1235), whose verses He
quoted in the Seven Valleys (SV30, 42) and Jawáhiru’l-Asrár (JA67
and 69); Mawláná Jalál ad-Dín Rúmí (1207–1273); Muṣlih ad-Dín
Sa‘dí (ca.1184–1291), whose verses He quoted in the Seven Valleys
(SV24) and the Four Valleys (FV47, 48, 48-9, 55-6, and 65) and
upon whose verse, “Wonder not, if my Best-Beloved be closer to
me than mine own self; wonder at this, that I, despite such near-
ness, should still be so far from Him”, He commented in a Tablet;43
Majdúd Saná’í (ca.1045–ca.1141), whose verses He quoted in the
Four Valleys (FV52, 60) and in Lawḥ-i-Ra’ís (SLH 170). It seems
that Bahá’u’lláh loved especially Rúmí, considering that He quoted
him more often than all the others. Perhaps this love moved Him
to write His Own Mathnaví, a poem that “in addition to the title
and the trope of the reed pipe which opens Rumi’s Mathnaví and
closes Bahá’u’lláh’s, shares the same metre” (Lewis, ‘Bahá’u’lláh’s
Mathnaví’ 116). Besides, He devoted part of His Lawḥ-i-Salmán
(see GWB, sec. XXI, CXLVIII, CLIV) to a comment upon a verse
by Rúmí (Mathnaví 1:2466):

> When the colourless became enmeshed in colours || a Moses
> came in conflict with a Moses. 44

Moreover `Abdu’l-Bahá narrates, in His description of the life of
Ustád Ismá‘íl, one of the companions who followed Bahá’u’lláh in
the Holy Land, that:

> At one time, Bahá’u’lláh had written down an ode of Rúmí’s
> for him, and had told him to turn his face toward the Báb
> and sing the words, set to a melody. And so as he wandered
through the long dark nights, Ustád would sing these lines:

> I am lost, O Love, possessed and dazed,
> [Ay ‘ishq man-am az tú sar-gashtih-u sawdá’í]
> Love’s fool am I, in all the earth.

[va andar hamiy-i-‘álam mashhúr bi shaydá’í]
> They call me first among the crazed,
> [dar námiy-i-majnúnán az nám-i-man ágházand]
> Though I once came first for wit and worth.
[zín písh agar búd-am sar daftar-i-dáná’í]

> O Love, who sellest me this wine,
> [Ay bádih furúsh-i- man]
> O Love, for whom I burn and bleed,
> [sar máyiy-i-júsh-i-man]
> Love, for whom I cry and pine—
> [Ay az tú khurúsh-i-man]
> Thou the Piper, I the reed.
[man náyam-u tú náyy]

> If Thou wishest me to live,
> [Gar zindigí-am khwáhí]
> Through me blow Thy holy breath.
> [dar man nafasí dar dam]
> The touch of Jesus Thou wilt give
> [man murdiy-i-ṣad sálih]
> To me, who’ve lain an age in death.

[tú ján-i-masíḥá’í]

> Thou, both End and Origin,
> [Avval-i-tú-vu ákhir tú]
> Thou without and Thou within—
> [ẓáhir-i-tú-vu báṭin tú]
> From every eye Thou hidest well,
> [mastúr zi har chashmí]
> And yet in every eye dost dwell.

[dar ‘ayn-i-huvyadá’í] (MF 30–1)45

Thus it is possible that Bahá’u’lláh wrote His poems just because of
His love for poetry.

Two other practical reasons could be that in those early years
Bahá’u’lláh was mostly addressing Sufi audiences who had a great
familiarity with mystical poetry. And moreover poetry is very easy
to memorize.

Bahá’u’lláh wrote about poetry in His Lawḥ-i-Maqṣúd:

> Every word of thy poetry is indeed like unto a mirror in
> which the evidences of the devotion and love thou cherish-
> est for God and His chosen ones are reflected (TB175–6,
> Lawḥ-i-Maqṣúd)

He describes poetry as a mirror of the feelings of the heart. We could
therefore think that His mystical experiences in the Síyáh-Chál
aroused in Him the urgency to speak about them to others, as it
happens to whoever has a mystical experience, as different as the level
of such experience may be for them when compared with the level of
that of the Manifestation of God. However, since He perceived that
human beings were not yet ready to receive His open Declaration,
He preferred to adopt the veiled language of mystical poetry. For
the same reason, He seemingly stopped writing poems in later years,
when He had already declared and proclaimed His Mission. In

this sense the invitation to keep silence that recurs at the end of a
number of His poems could be, not much a mere rhetorical device,
but the reflection of an inner tension between the impulse to reveal
the secret of the Intimation received in the Síyáh-Chál, even at the
cost of His life (see Báz áv-u bi-dih, v. 12, quoted in MA 4:187),
an impulse generated by a great compassion for the world that “is
consumed by the flame of the burning Divine Flame [súkht az ín
shu‘liy-i-ján-súz ilahí]” (Sáqí az Ghayb-i-Baqá, v. 15, quoted in MA
4:211), and the awareness of the immaturity of the times (see Saḥar
ámad bi bistar-am yár, v. 34, quoted in MA 4:184).

In this respect His poems are as windows opened on His heart and
His recent mystical experiences. We can thus expect them to reveal
the human aspects of His nature. This expectation is seemingly
confirmed by the words of Shoghi Effendi who describes

> the odes He revealed, whilst wrapped in His devotions
> during those days of utter seclusion, and… the prayers and

His intimist verses, that is His verses that deal “chiefly with intimate
and private especially psychological experiences”,46 are many indeed:

> Through the window of the soul I behold the cheek of the
> Beloved [Az rawzan-i-ján bínam rukhsáriy-i-Jánán-rá]. (Báz
> áv-u bi-dih, v. 2, Quoted in MA 4:186)

> I have lost the way and Thou art a brilliant Flame [Man gum-
> shudih ráh-am, Tú Shu‘liy-i-núrání]. (‘Ishq az Sidriy-i-A‘lá
> ámad, v. 8, quoted in MA 4:179)

> I am drunk of Thee, ’cause of Thee I am on everyone’s lips
> [Man khúd zi Tú am makhmúr, ham az Tú shudam mashhúr].

(Sáqí, bi-dih ábí, v. 13, quoted in MA 4:193)

The poem Saḥar ámad bi bistar-am yár, especially verses 19 e 29, is a
confession, where Bahá’u’lláh lays bare His heart:

> In my love for Thee I have received many an arrow of cru-
> elty, || And I have fallen into the hands of the infidels. [Gar
> chih zi ‘ishq-at basí tír-i-jafá khúrdam || Ham gashtih asír-i-
> dast-i-kuffár]. (Saḥar ámad bi bistar-am yár, v. 19, quoted in
> MA 4:182)

> The Birds of Eternity have returned to their nest, || We have
> remained downtrodden and abject here on earth [Aṭyár-i-
> Baqá bi-áshyán bar-gashtand, || Má mándih dar ín turáb basí
> dhalíl u khwár]. (Saḥar ámad bi bistar-am yár, v. 29, quoted
> in MA 4:183)

The same thing is true for the poem But-i-má ámad, which from
verse 22 on describes a mystical vision of great beauty. Verse 32 is
especially intimist:

> My mind did not find its way. || My thought stepped back
> [Dhihn-am na-burdih ráh bi-já’í, || Fikrat-am az sayr basí
> vámándih]. (Quoted in MA 4:191)

One gets the impression that Bahá’u’lláh really wanted to show His
hidden thoughts. This feature makes those poems especially precious
for all them who are eager to become more familiar with the figure of
Bahá’u’lláh and with the human aspect of a Personage Who is known
especially through Works that He wrote with the majesty and the
authority of the “divine teacher” (SAQ 11, sec. 3, para.13).

As to a didactic intent, many passages convey useful advice for who-
ever wants to tread the mystical path, that in Bahá’í terms is the
path of spirituality, that is pursuing the development of the spiritual
quality potentially present in each soul. Sáqí az Ghayb-i-Baqá, from
distich 4 to distich 9, is an invitation to detachment, in its various
forms, detachment from the things of the world, detachment from
the self, detachment from anything but Him. There are suggestions
for the mystic path in poem But-i-má ámad as well:

> First, watch your language. || Then, curb and calm down your
> fancy [Avval tu dahán bar-band zi guftár, || Ham zi khayál-at
> shú sákin u ásúdih].

> Set thy heart free from exteriority. || Be inwardly pure and
> excellent [Ham tu bi-shú dil-rá zán-chih buvad ẓáhir, || Van-gáh
> zi báṭin shú pák u guzídih]. (But-i-má ámad, v. 11–2, quoted in
> MA 4:189)

An echo of these words sounds in the Kitáb-i-Íqán:

> He must never seek to exalt himself above any one, must
> wash away from the tablet of his heart every trace of pride
> and vainglory, must cling unto patience and resignation,
> observe silence, and refrain from idle talk. For the tongue
> is a smouldering fire, and excess of speech a deadly poison.
> Material fire consumeth the body, whereas the fire of the
> tongue devoureth both heart and soul. The force of the
> former lasteth but for a time, whilst the effects of the latter
> endure a century. (KI 192)

We could finally suppose that Bahá’u’lláh, “the True Educator, and the
Spiritual Teacher” (ESW 143), indulged His poetical vein, conscious
that future poets and artists may have taken them as models from
which they may draw inspiration. His poems are not many, but they

present a great variety of highly inspiring metaphors. His language,
enriched by the best images of the ancient Persian mystical poetry,
is free from that cloyingness which Persian lyric poetry sometimes
conveys in its excessive uses of stereotypes. His images are not lifeless
rhetorical devices, but a living and transparent instrument, indispens-
able to express mystical meanings, which cannot be described with
the usual language of doctrinal prose. These images, rich in visual
suggestions as they are, will inflame the imagination of future artists,
not only of the pen, but also of the paintbrush and of the chisel.

Love poems

The mystical experiences that Bahá’u’lláh had in the Síyáh-Chál of
Teheran in October 1852 kindled in Him an irresistible ‘fire of love
[nár-i-‘ishqí]’ (Sáqí az Ghayb-i-Baqá, v. 4) that He sang in the poems
He wrote in Iraq. This love that Bahá’u’lláh had conceived in that
obscure prison was not a common love, it was that ‘essence of love’,
which He later on described in His Words of Wisdom:

> The essence of love is for man to turn his heart to the Beloved
> One, and sever himself from all else but Him, and desire
> naught save that which is the desire of his Lord. (TB 155,
> Aṣl-i-Kullu’l-Khayr)

We may find a doctrinal explanation of this ‘essence of love’ born
in the heart of Bahá’u’lláh in `Abdu’l-Bahá’s ‘Commentary to the
Tradition of the Hidden Treasure [Sharḥ-i-Ḥadíth-i-Kuntu Kanzan
Makhfíyan]’.47 In that treatise `Abdu’l-Bahá mentions five stages of
love. The fifth stage as described by Him is not mentioned in the
Sufi classical works. He describes this stage as

> that spiritual attraction and that ecstatic love of the lovers
> of the Beauteous One for the beauty within their own self.

> It is to be counted as a station and a stage of Affection from
> the state of unification towards unification.

> In this stage the traveller leaves the wilderness of annihila-
> tion and perplexed wandering… sees the glimmering of the
> effulgences of the Beauteous One shining from the dawn
> of his own beauty… [and] sees his own beauty annihilated
> in the Beauty of the True One and finds the Beauty of the
> True One enduring in the beauty of his self. (‘Commentary’
> 18–19, provisional translation)

`Abdu’l-Bahá makes clear that the fifth stage of love pertains to the

Manifestations of God. However, He explains,

> the effulgences of this station shine forth from these Suns
> onto the mirrors of the realities of the wayfarers and seekers.
> Thus if the mirrors of the heart be freed from the dust of
> the worlds of plurality and limitations then the effulgences
> of this station will be imprinted upon it. And if the window
> of the soul and the lamp of the heart become purified and
> refined through the power of holy souls, the light of Divine
> Bounty will be kindled within it. (‘Commentary’ 19–20,
> provisional translation)

The possibility of catching a glimpse of this special love, ‘that ecstatic
love of the lovers of the Beauteous One for the beauty within their
own self ’, makes these poems very precious, because they may be a
source of inspiration for any person who is striving to arise towards
His supernal Worlds through her daily actions of service.

The ‘beauty within… [His] own self ’, that Bahá’u’lláh loved so
much is variously described in His poems. In Sáqí az Ghayb-i-Baqá
it is the Cup-Bearer [Sáqí] Who offers the ‘Wine of Eternal Life
[Khamr-i-Báqí]’ (v. 1, quoted in MA 4:209). In ‘Ishq az Sidriy-A‘lá it
is Love itself [‘Ishq] that offers ‘the cup of affliction [jám-i-balá]’ (v. 1,
quoted in MA 4:179). In Bi-Jánán ján hamí dar-yáft it is the Beloved
[Jánán] Who draws to Himself the lover through the effluvia of His
perfume (v. 1, quoted in MA 4:176). In Sáqí, bi-dih ábí it is again
the Cup-Bearer [Sáqí], Who offers a Wine that is of water and of
fire (v. 1–2, quoted in MA 4:192). In Mast-and bulbulán it is once
more the Beloved [Jánán], Who sends his lover into rapture with the
song of His Yá Hú (v. 1–2, quoted in MA 4:194). In Saḥar ámad bi
bistar-am it is the Friend [Yár], Who goes at the bedside of the Lover,
thin and pale because of the love sickness that consumes him, and
comforts him with His sweet words (v. 1, quoted in MA 4:181). In

But-i-má ámad it is the Idol or Charmer [But], so handsome, Who
comes and gives His wise advice (v. 1f, quoted in MA 4:188f). In Ay
bulbulán it is ‘He Who was invisible [Ghayb]’, come to bring a new
springtime (v. 1, quoted in AA 4:200).

Verse after verse Bahá’u’lláh strings the pearls of His images, creating
oneiric atmospheres resounding of angelical voices, like ‘the warbling
of Ṭihrán [ghunniy-i-Ṭá]’ (Rashḥ-i-‘amá, v. 10, quoted in Rafati, Áthár
59); drawing dreamy landscapes like ‘the garden’s ecstasy [ḥálat-i-
bustán]’ and ‘the rapture of creation [jadhbiy-i-hastan]’ (Rashḥ-i-‘amá,
v. 18, quoted in Rafati, Áthár 59). These sceneries are rich in colours,
as ‘the eye of twilight… turned pomegranate [chashm-i-shafaq gulnár]’
(Saḥar ámad bi bistar-am yár, v. 9, quoted in MA 4:181), and soaked
with perfumes, like the ‘stores of all lovers… turned into spice shops
[shikkar-i-la‘l-ash, ‘iyán chún dakkiy-i-‘aṭṭár shud]’ (Ay bulbulán, v. 6,
quoted in AA 4:200). They offer a glimpse of a nature translucent
with infinite, like the ‘running herd of His gazelles in the desert of
Oneness [davad dar barr-i-Vaḥdat galliy-i-áhúy-i-ú]’ (Bi-Jánán ján hamí
dar-yáft, v. 19, quoted in MA 4:178) or the sky that ‘has filled its skirt
with pearls, || To lay it down at the feet [dámán-i-gawhar zán girift, ||
Tá kunad bar maqdam-i-‘izzat nithár]’ (Saḥar ámad bi bistar-am yár,
v. 16 MA 4:182) of the Beloved. At the same time His verses give
important lessons of life:

> If thou art not annihilated to the qualities of existence, O man
> of the path, || How wilt thou sip the wine of eternal life from
> that sweet Idol’s ruby lips [Tá na-gardí fání az vaṣf-i-vujúd, ay
> mard-i-ráh, || Kí chashí khamr-i-Baqá az la‘l-i-núshín-i-Nigár]?

(Sáqí az Ghayb-i-Baqá, v. 5, quoted in MA 4:210)

or

> Purify thyself in the crucible of oneness || And I will give
> thee two or three glasses of this wine [Chún kih shudí kháli

> az bútiy-i-vaḥdat, || Án-gah du sih paymánih daham-at zín
> bádih]. (But-i-má ámad, v. 13, quoted in MA 4:189)

Bahá’u’lláh draws from the entire repertoire of the ancient Persian
poetry, mixing the Anacreontic, love, spring and mystical motifs
of the ghazal and the didactic themes of the qaṣídih. The result is a
phantasmagoria of images, colors, sounds, and scents that hushes the
mind and touches the heart. Therefore these poems, even if read in
a paraphrase and not in an adequate translation, seem an excellent
instrument to create that attitude of meditation and prayer which the
Bahá’í Writings highly recommend, because, in `Abdu’l-Bahá’s words

> Remembrance of God is like the rain and dew which bestow
> freshness and grace on flowers and hyacinths, revive them
> and cause them to acquire fragrance, redolence and renewed
> charm. ‘And thou hast seen the earth dried up and barren:
> but when We send down the rain upon it, it stirreth and
> swelleth, and groweth every kind of luxuriant herb’. Strive
> thou, then, to praise and glorify God by night and by day,
> that thou mayest attain infinite freshness and beauty.

(Quoted in CC 2:232, sec. 1745)

Love in Persian mystical poetry and in these poems
by Bahá’u’lláh

‘That ecstatic love of the lovers of the Beauteous One for the beauty

> within their own self ’ (`Abdu’l-Bahá, ‘Commentary’ 18–19, provi-
> sional translation), that is Bahá’u’lláh’s love for the Most Great Spirit,
> is described in these poems according to the stylistics of Persian
> mystic poetry. However, there are great conceptual differences. In the
Works He wrote in the Iraqi period, Bahá’u’lláh adopted the ciphers

of Sufism and, at first sight, He seems to share its concepts. In reality,

He immediately opened the door to many changes. He already did
it in these early poetical compositions. He did it more completely in
His two Epistles, the Seven Valleys [Haft Vádí] and the Four Valleys
[Chihar Vádí] that He wrote sometime after His return to Baghdad
from Kurdistan in 1856. He did it in the Hidden Words that He
composed in 1858, and in the Kitáb-i-Íqán “revealed within the space
of two days and two nights, in the closing years of that period (1278
A.H.–1862 A.D.)” (GPB 138, sec. 8, para.25). We will thus briefly
illustrate the concepts of love of God, as well as of the Beloved and the
lover, in the Sufi literature and in Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings, and we will
try to highlight their similitude and differences.

The concept of love
The concept of love for God has been introduced into the Islamic
world as early as the second century of the Hegira by the Iraqi Sufi
poet Rábi‘a al-‘Adawiyya (ca.714–801). At the beginning this concept
of the love of God was opposed in the Muslim world, because people
thought it to imply an excessive intimacy between human beings,
mean creatures, and their Creator, Absolute and Unknowable Essence.
However the resemblance between mystical love and human love is
such that, finally, this concept took off and many poets sang this feel-
ing. The descriptions of a number of these poets became in the course
of time so realistic that, as Schimmel puts it, “one of the questions
that has been discussed frequently in connection with Persian lyrical
poetry is whether this literature should be interpreted as mystical or
as erotic” (Mystical Dimensions 288). According to Bausani these two
positions can be both acceptable depending on the poet (see Religion
in Iran 273).

These disquisitions do not apply to the poems by Bahá’u’lláh. It
seems very clear today that the Beloved of those poems is the Most
Great Spirit. It seems difficult today not to consider Rashḥ-i-‘Amá
as a joyous announcement of the encounter with the Spirit in an

extraordinary ‘divine rapture [jadhbiy-i-lahútí]’ (v. 7, quoted in Rafati,
Áthár 59), that draws the Poet to proclaim:

> The Era of ‘I am He’ shone forth from Our Countenance. ||
> The Cycle of ‘He is He’ rolls out from the effusion of Bahá
> [Bá] [Dawr-i-‘Aná Hú’ az Chihriy-i-Má kardih burúz, ||
> Kawr-i-‘Huva Hú’ az ṭafḥiy-i-Bá mí-rízad]. (v. 8, quoted in
> Rafati, Áthár 59)

The same is true in the case of the poem Mast-and bulbulán (see MA
4:194–6), with its significant radíf, yá Húy-i-ú. The description of the
Beloved in verses 6–19 of the poem Sáqí, bi-dih abí also suggests that
the Beloved is a sublime Entity (see MA 4:192–3). Other verses that
also seem to announce the descent of the Most Great Spirit are:

> Thou art Jesus’ breath. Thou art Moses’ bush. || Thou art
> God’s crimson flame that sets the world on fire [Ham nafkhiy-
> i-‘Ísá’í, ham sidriy-i-Músá’í. || Nára’llah-i-ḥamrá’í kátash zadí
> imkán-rá]. (Báz áv-u bi-dih jámí, v. 4, quoted in MA 4:187)

> Marvel not that the lover fell into His snare, || The necks
> of the Monarchs of the spirit are caught in His curly locks
> [Ín ‘ajab níst kih ‘áshiq bih kamand-ash uftádih. || Gardan-i-
> Sháhán-i-ján andar kham-i-gísúy-i-ú].

> Out of love for His cheek Moses hastened to the Sinai of the
> inner meaning, || The Jesus of the Spirit was risen by His
> cheering breath [Músí az ‘ishq-i-Rukh-ash dar Ṭúr-i-ma‘ní mí-
> shitáft, || ‘Ísíy-i-ján zindih ámad az dam-i-dil-júy-i-ú]. (Bi-Jánán
> ján hamí dar-yáft, v. 6–7, quoted in MA 4:177)

The image of the Beloved
In Sufi poems the lover yearns to go closer to the Beloved. But
the Beloved is the Absolute and thus He is described as aloof,

unapproachable, indifferent to the lover’s proffer of love. Therefore
the lover laments His cruelty that makes him suffer. Ḥáfiẓ for exam-
ple asks the Beloved:

> O my soul! From stone-heartedness, why shatterest thou ||
> The feeble heart which, through feebleness, is [fragile] like
> crystal. (Dīvān 233, no.111, v. 6; Persian: Díván, ‘Ghazalyát’,
> no. 97, v. 6)

The lover also laments the Beloved’s changeableness. Rúmí writes
in this vein:

> One moment you brand me, the next you draw me into the
> garden [bágh]. (Mystical Poems 2:16, no. 221, v. 8; Díván,
‘Ghazalyát’, no. 1786, v.8)

This is náz, the coquetry “of the Beloved who pretends to surrender,
but never yields, who responds with his whims, his unfaithfulness,
his arrogance, and his cruelty to the mercy invoked by his lovers “
(Saccone, ‘Introduzione’ 41).

Bahá’u’lláh also adopts the language of the Beloved’s remoteness
and cruelty. The Beloved is erratic and plays with the lover, whom
He sometimes binds to Himself, sometimes ignores. The Beloved
tortures the lover [‘áshiq]: the snake of His tresses sucks the blood
of his heart and soul (see Báz áv-u bi-dih jámí, v. 10, quoted in MA
4:187). With His ‘blood-shedding eyebrow [abrúy-i-khún-ríz]’ (Báz
áv-u bi-dih jámí, v. 9, quoted in MA 4:187) He kills the lover and
asks him to throw his head at His feet:

> If thine aim be to cherish thy life, approach not our court;
> || But if sacrifice be thy heart’s desire, come and let others
> come with thee [Gar khayál-i-ján hamí hast-at bi-dil, ínjá

> ma-yá, || Gar nithár ján va dil dárí, bí-á va ham bí-ár]. (Sáqi
> az Ghayb-i-Baqá, v. 7–8, quoted in MA 4:210)

In the poems written by Bahá’u’lláh, however, the Beloved seems
more indulgent. The pains He causes to His lover have mystical,
rather than earthly, features. His cruelty is but a poetical device. The
Beloved Who wants the sacrifice of the lover in reality wants him to
renounce the inferior qualities of his material nature, those qualities
which in the Bahá’í Writings are described as ‘the insistent self [nafs-
i-ammarih], the evil promptings of the human heart’ (SWAB 256,
sec. 206, Muntakhabátí 247). It is that which Madame Jeanne Marie
Bouvier de La Motte Guyon (1648–1717) called ‘mystical death’. In
her words:

> Death has various names, according to our different manner
> of expression or conception. It is called a departure, that is,
> a separation from Self in order that we may pass into God;
> a loss, total and entire, of the Will of the creature, which
> causes the Soul to be wanting to itself, that it may exist only
> in God. (‘Concise View’, para.43)

Mystical death is the price that should be paid to come closer to the
Beloved. The lover’s pains are therefore the unavoidable consequence
of the intoxication of love, that draws the lover to accept any agony, so
that he may come closer to his Beloved. It is the pain of one’s struggle
against the emotions of the natal self, in order to master them and
bend them towards the direction recommended by the Beloved, so
that one may fulfill in one’s life ‘His trust, and in the realm of spirit
obtain the gem of Divine virtue’ (AHW).

The image of the lover
In Sufi poems the lover, in his unremitting longing for the Beloved,
unapproachable and cruel as He is, is unavoidably overpowered by
feelings of remoteness and pain. The Algerian anthropologist and

psychoanalyst Malek Chebel, an archaeologist of the world of the
Arabian and Islamic imagination, writes that for those poets love

> is experienced as a consuming passion, as remoteness and pain.
> These three elements pervade the mythology of the chaste
> love of Platonists [al-Ḥubb al-‘Udhrí], a bitter love, conducive
> to anguish, nourished by waiting, gnawed by torments of the
> soul and tortures of the body. (Chebel 204–5)

Ḥáfiẓ devoted an entire ghazal to the leitmotiv of separation:

> The reed’s tongue hath no desire for the explanation of
> separation [ faráq] || If not, to thee, I give the explanation
> of the tale of separation.

> Alas! Life’s span, in hope of union || Hath reached to an
> end; and to an end, hath not come the time of separation
> (Dīvān 603, no. 351, vv.1–2; Persian: Díván, ‘Ghazalyát’, no.

297, vv. 1–2).

As to pain, Ḥáfiẓ wrote in one of his ghazals:

> For our pain [dard], is no remedy [darmán], Justice! || For
> our separation [ḥijr] is no end, Justice!

> Religion and the heart, they ravish; and make design
> upon our life: || Justice! against the tyranny of lovely ones
> [khúbán], Justice!

> As the price of a kiss, the demand of a life, || These heart-
> ravishers [dil-sitánán] make, Justice!

> These of Kafir-heart drink our blood: || O Muslims! what
> remedy? Justice!...

> Day and night, self-less, like Hafiz || Weeping and consuming
> (with grief), I have gone, Justice! (Dīvān 231, no.110, v. 1–4, 7;
> Persian: Díván, ‘Ghazalyát’, no. 96, v.1–4, 7)

The words more frequently used to describe the pains of the lover’s
remoteness [hijrán] from the Beloved are ghamm and dard. As to
ghamm, according to Carlo Saccone, an expert in and a translator
of Persian poetry, this word usually denotes “the pain because of
a separation or detachment from the beloved, a classical figure of
the condition of the mystic” (‘Note’ 219n14). As to dard, the same
Saccone writes:

> Persian language makes an interesting distinctions of words,
> whereby the more usual term—‘‘eshq’, from an Arabic root—
> is paralleled by another, strictly Iranian, word, ‘dard’, which
> means love seen in the perspective of its ‘pain’ (which is the
> etymological meaning of ‘dard’), more properly ‘pain because
> of an absence’ or because of remoteness from the beloved.
> This is the reason why ‘Attâr said that angels have an experi-
> ence of ‘‘eshq’ (the love typical of one who attains the union
> with his beloved), but only man knows ‘dard’ (and ahl-e dard,
‘people of pain’ for love, or sorrowful, usually denotes the

mystic lovers). (‘La “via degli amanti”’ 34)

These qualities of the lover are mentioned also in Bahá’u’lláh’s poems.
The lover wants to be united [vaṣl] with his Beloved and therefore
yearns after annihilation [faná], the one condition that, together
with the inevitable pain [dard] it implies, enables the lover to be
united with His Beloved and to enjoy the vision of His quickening
[jánbakhsh] splendor [jilvih]. The lover yearns after pain and death,
because for him existence means remoteness from his Beloved. ‘Turn
my ease into pain [dard-am dih az ásáyish]’ (Báz áv-u bi-dih jámí, v. 3,
quoted in MA 4:187), he invokes. He also says:

> In Thy pathway I have offered up this world and the world to
> come. || Come back, that I may lay down my heart and soul
> for Thee [Dunyá-u ‘uqbá-rá jumlih bi-rah-at dádam || Báz á
> bi-rah-at rízam ham ján-u raván-rá]. (Báz áv-u bi-dih jámí, v.

6, quoted in MA 4:187)

He asks the Beloved: ‘Consume this vanishing temple and go away in
laughter [Ín haykal-i-fání-rá bar-súz-u bu-rú khandán]’ (Báz áv-u bi-dih
jámí, v. 2, quoted ibid.). And moreover:

> Thou didst come with a sword in Thy hand, O Love, || Here

The lover is a derelict, because he is nothing and the Beloved is all.
Therefore he invokes:

> Deliver me from perpetuity. Release me from eternity. ||
> Shelter this poor headless one ’neath the shadow of evanes-
> cence [Az abad-am bi-rahán, vaz qidam-am bi-jahán || Dar
> ẓill-i-faná dih já ín bí-sar-u sámán-rá]. (Báz áv-u bi-dih jámí, v.

5, quoted in MA 4:187)

The lover is eager, because he is looking forward to being united with
the Beloved. He invites the Beloved to lift up ‘the veil from… [His]
cheek [burqa‘… az ‘idhár]’ (Sáqí az Ghayb-i-Baqá, v. 1, quoted in MA
4:209). He asks Him ‘ a drop of the mystic flame [ábí zán shu‘liy-i-
rúḥání]’ (Sáqí, bi-dih ábí, v. 1, quoted in MA 4:192). He wishes ‘to
become informed of the mysteries of love [kih gardí váqif az asrár-i-‘ishq]’

(Sáqí az Ghayb-i-Baqá, v. 9, quoted in MA 4:219). He is a ‘drunkard
of the Lord [makhmúr-i-rabbání]’ (Sáqí az Ghayb-i-Baqá, v. 3).

Beyond the pain of the lover
Beside all these feelings that repeat the classical models of Persian
mystic poetry, in the poems of Bahá’u’lláh there is a strong presence
of the joy for the splendor or unveiling [jilvih] of the Beloved, perhaps
a reference to what He perceived during His mystical experiences
in the Síyáh-Chál, which He now wants to share with His readers.
The description of this reunion suggests to the mystic seekers the
certain possibility of definitively closing the ‘the scroll of remoteness
[daftar-i-hijrán]’ (Báz áv-u bi-dih jámí, v. 3, quoted in MA 4:186) from
the Beloved.

The concept of reunion is clearly explained in a Tablet, known
as Lawḥ-i-‘Áshiq va Ma‘shúq, that is Tablet of the lover and the
Beloved, that could have been written in Edirne in ca.1866–1867
(see Taherzadeh 2:241–5):

> Release yourselves, O nightingales of God, from the thorns
> and brambles of wretchedness and misery, and wing your
> flight to the rose-garden of unfading splendor. O My friends
> that dwell upon the dust! Haste forth unto your celestial
> habitation. Announce unto yourselves the joyful tidings: ‘He
> Who is the Best-Beloved is come! He hath crowned Himself
> with the glory of God’s Revelation, and hath unlocked to
> the face of men the doors of His ancient Paradise.’ Let all
> eyes rejoice, and let every ear be gladdened, for now is the
> time to gaze on His beauty, now is the fit time to hearken to
> His voice. Proclaim unto every longing lover: ‘Behold, your
> Well-Beloved hath come among men!’ and to the messengers
> of the Monarch of love impart the tidings: ‘Lo, the Adored
> One hath appeared arrayed in the fullness of His glory!’ O
> lovers of His beauty! Turn the anguish of your separation

> from Him into the joy of an everlasting reunion, and let the
> sweetness of His presence dissolve the bitterness of your
> remoteness from His court.

> Behold how the manifold grace of God, which is being
> showered from the clouds of Divine glory, hath, in this day,
> encompassed the world. For whereas in days past every lover
> besought and searched after his Beloved, it is the Beloved
> Himself Who now is calling His lovers and is inviting them
> to attain His presence. (GWB 319–20, sec. CLI, paras1–2,
> Lawḥ-i-‘Áshiq va Ma‘shúq)

In the light of this explanation the feeling of remoteness is no more
a desperate feeling, but a conscious longing of a possible fulfillment.

This changed atmosphere, as a result of the lover’s approach to the
Beloved, finds an explanation in a number of aspects of the new mys-
tical vision brought by Bahá’u’lláh. Bahá’u’lláh confirms the concept
of Islamic orthodoxy whereby God is absolutely unknowable and thus
whosoever tries to approach His Essence exerts useless endeavors. He
writes:

> No tie of direct intercourse can possibly bind Him to His
> creatures. He standeth exalted beyond and above all sepa-
> ration and union, all proximity and remoteness. No sign
> can indicate His presence or His absence; inasmuch as by
> a word of His command all that are in heaven and on earth
> have come to exist, and by His wish, which is the Primal
> Will itself, all have stepped out of utter nothingness into the
> realm of being, the world of the visible. (KI 97, para.105)

Unlike certain Sufis, who thought the direct relation with the
Divinity accessible to those few chosen ones who attained the most
advanced stages of mystical quest, Bahá’u’lláh teaches that this direct

relation is barred to everyone. The lover can however enter into a rela-
tionship with Them Whom God sends to the world as His Vicars,

> sanctified Mirrors… Day-springs of ancient glory… Expo-
> nents on earth of Him Who is the central Orb of the universe,
> its Essence and ultimate Purpose (KI 99–100, para.106)

They are the Prophet as Lawgivers [shári’], the revealers of Scriptures
[kitáb], as for example Abraham, Moses, Christ, Muhammad, and
now He Himself. He writes that

> These Prophets and chosen Ones of God are the recipients
> and revealers of all the unchangeable attributes and names
> of God. They are the mirrors that truly and faithfully reflect
> the light of God. Whatsoever is applicable to them is in
> reality applicable to God, Himself, Who is both the Visible
> and the Invisible… By attaining, therefore, to the presence
> of these holy Luminaries, the ‘Presence of God [laqá’u’lláh]’
> Himself is attained. (KI 141 para.152, KMI 110)

The reunion with the Beloved is realized on earth in the meeting with
the Prophet, personally for a few human beings who live in His days
and who have the capacity of recognizing the Beauty of the Beloved
in Him, or through His Writings for all the others: ‘Through the
window of the soul [rawzan-i-ján]’ the lover beholds ‘the cheek of the
Beloved [rukhsáriy-i-Jánán]’ (Báz áv-u bi-dih jámí, v. 2, quoted in MA
4:186). This is the real meeting with the Beloved, that brings infinite
joy, because He breathes , with His ‘soul-stirring lips… a breath of
spirit into… [one’s] breast [bá lab-i-ján-bakhsh-at rúḥí bi-dam arkán-
rá]’ (Báz áv-u bi-dih jámí, v. 9, quoted in MA 4:187). The meeting
with God is now possible through Him, Bahá’u’lláh, ‘the Beloved of
the hearts which long for Thee [ḥabíba qulúbi’l-mushtaqín]’ (PM 209,
sec. 124, para.3, Munáját 142), He Himself the bearer of sublime
attributes and thus the supreme Object of love. He is ‘Jesus’ breath…

Moses’ bush… God’s crimson flame that sets the world on fire
[nafkhiy-i-‘Ísá’í… sidriy-i-Músá’í… Nára’llah-i-ḥamrá’í kátash zadí
imkán-rá]’ (Báz áv-u bi-dih jámí, v. 4, quoted in MA 4:187):

> A glimmer of His image fell on the page of the spirit, || A
> hundred Hellenic wisdoms were thereby confounded [Yik
> jilvih zi ‘aks-ash bar ṣafḥiy-i-ján uftád, || Válih shud az án
> jilvih ṣad ḥikmat-i-yúnání].

> A spark of that flame touched the Sinaitic tree, || A hundred
> Imranite Moses fell into a swoon [Yik jadhvih az án shu‘lih bar
> Sidriy-i-Síná zad, || Madhúsh az án jadhvih ṣad Músíy-i-‘Imrání].

> A flame burst out from that fire and Love pitched || Its tent
> in the water and clay of man and in his heart [Yik shu‘lih az
> án átash shud, ‘ishq bi-zad khar-gáh || Dar áb u gil-i-ádam ham
> dar dil-i-insání]. (Sáqí, bi-dih ábí, v. 3–5, quoted in MA 4:192)

The lover can only yield to Him, against any logic—‘Love becomes
a slave and the Intellect a porter [ham ‘Ishq shudih bandih, ham ‘Aql
kunad darbání]’ (Sáqí, bi-dih ábí, v. 19, quoted in MA 4:194)—in a
total amorous commitment which has no other aim than finding a
shelter ‘’neath the shadow of evanescence [dar ẓill-i-faná]’ (Báz áv-u
bi-dih jámí, v. 5, quoted in MA 4:187).

These poems make clear that for the lover to attain the reunion with
his Beloved he must follow Him. The mystical reunion with the
Beloved is attained through forgetting oneself and putting one’s life
at His service, to fulfill His vision of the future world civilization.
This is the joy of reunion, the joy of pursuing the ideal in action. This
concept is explained by `Abdu’l-Bahá as follows:

> Until a being setteth his foot in the plane of sacrifice, he is
> bereft of every favour and grace; and this plane of sacrifice

> is the realm of dying to the self, that the radiance of the
> living God may then shine forth. The martyr’s field is the
> place of detachment from self, that the anthems of eternity
> may be upraised. Do all ye can to become wholly weary of
> self, and bind yourselves to that Countenance of Splendours;
> and once ye have reached such heights of servitude, ye will
> find, gathered within your shadow, all created things. This is
> boundless grace; this is the highest sovereignty; this is the
> life that dieth not. All else save this is at the last but manifest
> perdition and great loss. (SWAB 76–7, sec. 36)

It is Faust‘s ‘Verweile doch! du bist so schön! Beautiful moment, do not
pass away’ (Faust, line 1699).

Beside their doctrinal meaning, which this is not the place to discuss,
Bahá’u’lláh’s words justify the joyous atmosphere prevailing on the
feelings of anguish and pain. The inebriation, the folly, the longing for
annihilation of the lover do not evoke only the pain of a fire that burns
away ‘all things [jumliy-i-hastí]’ (Sáqí az Ghayb-i-Baqá, v. 4, quoted in
MA 4:210), consumes ‘the world [jahán]’ (Sáqí az Ghayb-i-Baqá, v. 15,
quoted in MA 4:211), ‘sets the world on fire [kátash zadí imkán-rá]’
(Báz áv-u bi-dih jámí, v. 4, quoted in MA 4:187) and destroys ‘this van-
ishing temple [haykal-i-fání]’ (Báz áv-u bi-dih jámí, v. 2, quoted in MA
4:186). That same fire also is light that enlightens; it is ‘water of the
spirit [kawthar-i-rúḥání]’ (Sáqí, bi-dih ábí, v. 2, quoted in MA 4:192)
that nourishes and refreshes; it is a glimmer that falls ‘on the page of
the spirit [ṣafḥiy-i-ján]’ and confounds ‘a hundred Hellenic wisdoms
[ṣad ḥikmat-i-yúnání]’ (Sáqí, bi-dih ábí, v. 3, quoted in MA 4:192), a
spark whereby ‘a hundred Imranite Moses [ṣad Músíy-i-‘Imrání]’ fall
into a swoon (Sáqí, bi-dih ábí, v. 4, quoted in MA 4:192), that kindles
a ‘flame [Yik shu‘lih]’ of love that pitches ‘its tent in the water and clay
of man and in his heart [Dar áb u gil-i-ádam ham dar dil-i-insání]’ (Sáqí,
bi-dih ábí, v. 5, quoted in MA 4:192), that falls ‘upon the rose-bush
of the spirit [gul-bun-i-ján]’ and lights ‘its beauty as a vermilion tulip

> [chún láliy-i-nu‘mání] (Sáqí, bi-dih ábí, v. 16, quoted in MA 4:193); it
> is the theophanic ‘fire on Mount Paran [shu‘liy-i-Fárání]’ (Sáqí, bi-dih
> ábí, v. 11, quoted in MA 4:193). The moan of the lover is a ‘melody
> [naghmih]’ that can bring the world to life (Sáqí az Ghayb-i-Baqá, v. 15,
> quoted in MA 4:211). The ‘wine of the spirit [sharáb-i-ma‘naví]’ (Sáqí
> az Ghayb-i-Baqá, v. 2, quoted in MA 4:209) first intoxicates him and
> then shakes off ‘his languor [khumár]’ (Sáqí az Ghayb-i-Baqá, v. 3,
> quoted in MA 4:210). That Wine is ‘the wine of joy [khamr-i-farah]’
> (Sáqí az Ghayb-i-Baqá, v. 12, quoted in MA 4:210) that is offered in
‘the vessel of immortal life [sághar-i-báqí]’ (Báz áv-u bi-dih jámí, v. 1,

> quoted in MA 4:186) and washes the ‘soul from the whisperings of the
> flesh [vasvasiy-i-nafsání]’ (Sáqí, bi-dih ábí, v. 1, quoted in MA 4:192).
The lover is annihilated ‘to the qualities of existence [vaṣf-i-vujúd]’

> (Sáqí az Ghayb-i-Baqá, v. 5, quoted in MA 4:210), but immediately
> after he quaffs ‘the wine of eternal life from that sweet Idol’s ruby
> lips [khamr-i-Baqá az la‘l-i-núshín-i-Nigár]’ (Sáqí az Ghayb-i-Baqá, v.
> 5, quoted in MA 4:210). He tramples upon ‘the world [mulk]’ and
> enters ‘beneath the shade of Poverty [ẓill-i-faqr]’, but he soon beholds
‘the immortal World on every side [Mulk-i-báqí-rá kunún az har kinár]’

(Sáqí az Ghayb-i-Baqá, v. 6, quoted in MA 4:210).

The Beloved has come. The traditional relation between the Beloved
and His lovers is overturned. Whoever has recognized His Blessed
Beauty ‘steppeth into the sanctuary of the Friend, and shareth as an
intimate the pavilion of the Loved One’ (SV 17) and thus rejoices in
the bliss of reunion, in this Day when

. . . the people of Bahá have entered the blissful abode of the

> Divine Presence, and quaffed the wine of reunion, from the
> chalice of the beauty of their Lord, the All-Possessing, the
> Most High. (GWB 32, sec. XIV, para.13, Lawḥ-i-Riḍván)

As `Abdu’l-Bahá said: “The most great, peerless gift of God to the
world of humanity is happiness born of love—they are the twin sisters

of the superman; one is the complement of the other” (Quoted in ‘A
Fortune’ 103).

From these poems, and from the entire Work by Bahá’u’lláh, a con-
cept of mysticism emerges that is very far from the philosophizing and
aesthetic, always theoretical, abstractions of certain ancient types of
mysticism. Bausani writes that the Bahá’í mysticism is “a preparation
to a renewed active life on the earth, whose realities once again acquire
a new value, as if they were translucent with the absolute” (Saggi 152).
The meeting with the Beloved is accessible to everyone, here on earth.
There is but one prerequisite, an annihilation that is renouncing to the
seductions of the self and of the world and entering the path of service
to humankind, to create a new civilization, the only path that leads to
the reunion with the Beloved and thus the only source of genuine joy.

NOTES

All translations from Persian were done with the precious assistance of Ms.
1    Faezeh Mardani Mazzoli, lecturer of Persian language at the University of

> Bologna. These translations of Bahá’u’lláh’s poetry are temporary and informal.
> They are not authorized translations. They are made only for presentation at
> the `Irfán Colloquium. These translations should not be quoted, published or
> distributed in any form or through any media.

It is normal practice in this journal to italicize quotations from the three
2    Central Figures of the Bahá’á Faith following the practice of Shoghi Effendi.

> However, the editors decided to make an exception for this article to avoid
> confusion that might result due to the heavy use of transliteration from Persian
> and Arabic which is also in italics.
