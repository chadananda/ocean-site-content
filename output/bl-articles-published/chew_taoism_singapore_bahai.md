          Life, Death and Immortality:
the Taoist Religion in Singapore and the
BaháT Faith

Phyllis Ghim-Lian Chew

Abstract

This article outlines the main features of Taoist religious practices in
Singapore and makes a preliminary comparison of two religions, which at
first glance, could not be more disparate, namely the Taoist religion and
the Baha'i Faith. The article seeks to determine whether some sort of
unity may be found beneath the apparent dichotomy between these two
and whether and in what way the gulf between these two distinct religions
from different times and origins, may somehow be spanned.

Introduction

After my mother's miraculous recovery from a serious illness with help
from a Christian doctor, both my parents indicated their conversion to
Christianity by physically disposing of all the "idols" which had graced
their family home. As a child, I was therefore deprived of the direct
influence of the religion of my ancestors. However, I remember vividly
the ancestral home of my uncle, the eldest brother of my father, who Uved
across the road. The influence of religion on tradition was visible
everywhere. Upon entering the house, one saw paper gods both on portrait
and character form posted on the doors for protection against possible
invasion by evil spirits*. Near the door and on the floor was an altar to
Ta-po-kung, the local God of the soil, who brought luck and virtue to the

70             THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ'Í STUDIES REVIEW

family1 and protected the family against destructive influences. In the
courtyard was the Heavenly official, Tien Kuan while the wealth gods,
whose job was to bring prosperity to the family were in the main sitting
room of the house. Of course, there was Tsao-shen, the kitchen God in the
kitchen, whose duty it was to make an annual report to the Jade Emperor,
the "supreme God" in Heaven regarding the conduct and behaviour of the
family and its members. On festival days and during times of birth,
marriage or death, there were even more religious activities in front of the
altars in the home, in temples and on the streets, and on such occasions an
atmosphere of awesome sacredness and reverence was pervasive.

My uncle has since passed away and the house sold, resold, and torn
down to make way for urban renewal, as has been the fate of many old
houses in Singapore since the 1960's. Nevertheless, as an adult, I remain
enthralled by ceremonies, rituals and things religious. In this article, I
would like to make a preliminary comparison of two religions, which on
first glance, could not have been more divergent — the Taoist religion as
popularly practised in Singapore and the Baha'i Faith. My quest is to
discover whether some common denominators exist beneath the surface
contradictions of these two Faiths separated by millennia and vast
distances and demonstrate how such common denominators could be
fashioned into instruments of understanding linking the Taoist and Baha'i
Faiths.

A few salient points must first be noted about the Taoist religion. First
and foremost, the Taoist religion is very different from the Taoist
philosophy. The latter is represented by the philosophies of Lao-tzu and
Chuang-tzu, documented in the texts ascribed to them, namely the Tao-te-
ching and the Chuang-tzu as well as the later materials such as the
Huainanzi and the Liezi. The Taoist religion, on the other hand, can be
traced to Chang Tao-ling (circa 2nd Century CE) who claimed that he had
a vision whereby Lao-tzu gave him the authority to organise religious
communities, to forgive faults and sins, to heal and most important, to
exorcise ghosts, demons and evil spirits. Over the centuries, many
different schools of Taoism arose, built on Chang's vision, and drawing

Sometimes called lao-yeh (the lord), tu-ti-yeh (the lord of the soil) or lao-po-kung
(the elderly po-kung) according to different dialect groups.

inspiration, imagery, and eventually even gods from the original
philosophy of Lao-tzu. Taoism began to focus on revelations, healing,
rituals, oracles and shamanistic practices, developed monasteries inspired
by Buddhism, and established a network of temples throughout China.
Understandably, these two strands - religious Taoism and philosophical
Taoism ~ gave rise to much perplexity by outside observers, one being a
sophisticated philosophy and the other interwoven with elaborate rituals
and fantastic visions of countless gods.

The second noteworthy point is that where the masses of poor Chinese
immigrants to Singapore in the 19th century and early 20th Century were
concerned, they were not from the professional or educated elites (who
would have been more attracted to philosophical Taoism or
Confucianism); rather they were the "Chinese masses" from the lower and
middle working classes,2 and were therefore more attuned to religious
Taoism. These people were my ancestors on both sides of my family and
while the more sophisticated Chinese may not be particularly proud of the
heterogeneous practices of the masses, it would be difficult for them to
deny that it contains much that is meaningful in the culture of the masses
of immigrants. In Singapore, while there may be a handful of small
establishments where philosophical Taoism is practised; it is in its
popular or religious form that Taoism has a strong hold upon the religious
thought and practices of the people.

Third, it must be realised that the Taoist religion is a major part of what
one may call "the Chinese religion".3 In Singapore, this term is taken to
mean a characteristic amalgam of religious Taoism, Mahayana
Buddhism, a dash of Confucianism and a great deal of spirit-
mediumship.4 It is a "Chinese religion" and one which is eclectic and
polytheistic in nature. As the popular saying goes: "The average Chinese

wears a Confucian crown, a Taoist robe, and Buddhist sandals." In other
words, a Chinese can claim that he is both a Taoist (a lover of nature), a
Confucianist (who is serious about his duties), and a Buddhist (deeply
aware of the transience of life) at the same time. This kind of practical
wisdom is illustrated in folk temples not just in Singapore but in the
thriving Chinese communities of Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and Hong Kong
where statues of Confucius, Lao-tzu and Buddha are set up alongside
those of traditional Chinese immortals as objects of veneration.5

Finally, it must be noted that while the religion of the Chinese in
Singapore has always been identified with Buddhism, "Buddhism" is
found to be used as a convenient religious label where in fact a large
number of those who claim to be Buddhists, are actually practitioners of
the Chinese religion.6 Similarly, the Taoist influence is strongly visible in
most Singapore temples, even though these temples may be reputed to be
Buddhist ones.7 The 1990 Singapore census reports that among the
Singapore Chinese population, 68% are Taoist/Buddhist, 13% Christians
and 14% with no religion and 5% of other religions.8 The most prevalent
form of the Chinese syncretic religion is said to be Shén Jiáo> ("Doctrine
of the gods"). Shén means "spirit" - and this refers to the worship of the
spirit of some deified hero or emperor. In this article, the terms shénism
and Taoism can therefore be used interchangeably.

Actually, the Chinese religion is even more complex than this simple trilogy. A
recent survey found that besides Taoism and Confucianism, there were seven schools of
Buddhism (including Mahayana, Theravada, Pure Land, Ch'an and the Japanese
Nichiren school), at least nine syncretic religions (including the Great Way of Former
Heaven, the P'u Tu Men or salvation sect, the Kuei Ken Men or way-of reverting-to-
the-first-principle sect, and the well known Red Swastika Society and many spirit-
medium cults, pure Chinese ones, Sino-Malay ones and Sino-Indian ones. Most of
these were operating from small shop-front temples or shop-houses and even
apartments.

This is because the Chinese hold canonical Buddhism in high regard because of its
strict doctrines and principles. See Tong, Chee Kiong, Trends in Traditional Chinese
Religion in Singapore. A Report prepared for the Ministry of Community Development,
Singapore, 1988.

Life, Death and Immortality                          73

It is time now to look at how one aspect of Taoism - religious Taoism --
is manifested in Singapore. While Taoism is, by self-definition, a way
that does not cling to words or comparison, it is nevertheless one of the
ways to unlock and understand the psyche of the Chinese population in
Singapore. It can be described initially from three perspectives: its ritual
rites, its spiritual functionaries, and through a popular local festival - that
of the Nine Emperor gods.

The Taoist Religion in Singapore - Coping with Life, Death
and Immortality

Religious Taoism is essentially preoccupied with basic concerns, such as
life, death, and immortality, and pragmatic issues relating to health,
wealth, business and marriage. To ensure the wellbeing of such concerns,
it was believed that the regular performance of rituals would placate the
spirit world and enable one to lead a long, healthy and wealthy life free
from unnecessary misfortunes. There was also the belief that the
performance of good deeds would help in the cleansing of one's body, that
physical illness was a consequence of immoral conduct; and that any cure
would therefore require repentance and good work. Good health and long
life could also be achieved through the ancient shamanistic arts of external
alchemy (elixir) or internal alchemy (meditation and exercises).

Taoist Ritual Rites

For the religious Taoist, maintaining harmony with the environment is
important and this is accomplished through the performance of highly
complex rites involving symbolism, music and drama, all of which
contribute to the articulation of the sacred mysteries. In these ceremonies,
the first thing that strikes an observer is perhaps the ubiquitous presence
of icons and symbols. Images of the deities are represented in statutes,
paper figures, portraits, banners and draperies. Accompanying these
images are auspicious signs, cosmological symbols such as dragons,
divine beings, and the diagram of the "great ultimate", a symbol of the
Taoist cosmos. Music accompanies these ritual performances by
signalling the different stages in the ritual. The music is urgent when

74               THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

military action is undertaken against demons; it changes to a sombre note
when the officials approach the noble deities.9

Taoist rituals can be divided into two categories - one for the benefit of
the living and one for that of the dead.10 Both are complementary in the
sense that unless the dead are kept content, according to traditional
Chinese beliefs, lasting peace and prosperity for the living would not be
possible. The first, rituals for the living, are large-scale communal
thanksgiving celebrations marking either the anniversary of a patron deity
of a community or commemorating an important event such as the
completion of a new temple. On such occasions, the Taoist priest conveys
the gratitude of the community to the gods and invites them to come and
partake of the many ostentatious offerings laid on the altars and tables.
There are also street processions, feasting and theatrical performances.
Such occasions help bring the community together.

Like the living, the dead also demand close attention. If properly cared
for, the dead would become caring ancestors and a source of help and
blessings; if neglected, they could turn into malignant spirits. It is thus in
the interest of the descendants to have the necessary rituals performed for
the repose of the dead. The services of a Taoist priest is employed as he is
believed to be able to pacify the soul of the deceased by guiding it, step by
step, first to the subterranean world, then through the courts of judgement,
and finally to the paradise of the blessed.

Like the ancient Hebrews, the ancient Chinese had a three-tiered world
view, of heaven above, the dead below, and earth, the abode of the living,

It is possible that Chinese theatre had evolved from ritual performance. Taoist rituals
are dramatic expressive, and at times even comical. For example, the purification rite
that forms part of the creation of the ritual altar in a thanksgiving offering unfolds as a
playlet, in which the Taoist priest chases and eventually subdues a masked acolyte
impersonating a demon. The sessions called "Despatching the Writ of pardon" and
"Attack on Hell" include lively dialogues, jest and acrobatics. These light-hearted and
motion filled moments are akin to popular drama. The language is concrete and
narrative rather than abstract or bureaucratic. The plot and roles are closely parallel to
those of popular theatre and easily grasped by the audience. See Lee, C.Y., Chan, K. L.
and Tsu, Y.H. Taoism. Outlines of a Chinese Religious Tradition. Singapore: Taoist
Federation of Singapore, 1994.

in between. They believed that at death the upper soul (hun) rises up to
heaven while the lower soul (p'o) descends to earth. The ancestors were
often represented as somewhere "on high" with the Lord, and continued to
have power over the living, whether to protect or bless them or to punish
and curse them. Ancient Chinese literature, especially that of the fifth and
fourth centuries B.C., is fairly rich in essays and poems devoted to
recalling the soul. The soul is called hun-p'o. P'o is the spirit of man's
physical nature expressed in his body and his physical movement while
hun-p 'o survives him at death. When my father passed away, my mother
would still expect his soul to return to the home at certain times of the
year and the entire family would faithfully gather together with huge
offerings of food and small rituals of reverence to observe his return.
Where the masses was concerned, there was no question that the
individual continued to live after death.11

Spiritual Functionaries

A distinctive feature of the Taoist religion is its extravagance which is
manifested in innumerable spiritual beings, gods or celestials and
immortals as well as deified heroes and forces of nature, all of whom are
empowered to intervene in human affairs. Resembling in its functions the
imperial Chinese state bureaucracy, they make up a highly sophisticated
structured pantheon. According to Taoist theology, the divine government
is headed by a triumvirate known as the "three pure ones" (Sanqing), all
three of which emanate directly from the Tao.12 The highest of the three is
generally agreed to be "Celestial Venerable of the Original beginning"
(Yuanshi Tianzun), the embodiment the supreme creator of all things.
The second is to the left of the supreme pure one "Celestial Venerable of
the Luminous Treasure" (Lingbao Tianzun) and is depicted as holding the
famous Taoist "diagram of the supreme ultimate" (taiji tu). The one on
the right is the "most high lord Lao", another formal representation of the
"divine" Lao-tzu.

\[11\] See Ching, Julia. Chinese Religions. London: The Macmillan Press, Ltd, 1993.

\[12\] In a typical Taoist temple, these three deities would sit in the "Hall of the Three
Pure Ones" (Sanquing dian).

However, while there may be thousands of deities, in actual worship, only
a few popular ones stand out because they are perceived to be more
merciful and have a special regard for the people. One of the most
influential is Tianhou, the "Empress of Heaven"13. Another is Dabogong,
the earth deity who presides over a wide range of affairs including health,
wealth and general safekeeping.14 Another popular personage is Guandi,
(Lord Guan) known as Guangong, (the "God of War"), a famous warrior
in early China whose heroic deeds have been immortalised in the classical
novel Romance of the Three Kingdom.15 One must not forget too the
widely celebrated eight immortals (xian) who while occupying a low
category in the divine hierarchy are very appealing to the masses due to
the fact that they have a special affinity for the problems of daily life,
since they were all human beings at one time.

An important functionary on the physical plane who is able to help the
individual make communication with the divinities in the spirit world is
the spirit-medium, who would frequently call on a personal spirit to come
down and enlighten him or her. If one desires to speak urgently to one's
departed ancestor, one would seek the help of a medium who would be
able to relay messages to and from the departed ancestors while in a
trance. Another service which the medium provides is the performance of
ritual healing for illnesses or problems such as spirit possession, the loss
of the soul by witchcraft and ailments caused by natural elements. The
standard cure for the first two is essentially to exorcise the evil spirits
responsible, while the treatment for the disharmony of natural elements is
based on the prescription of herbal medicine. Both categories, however,
entail a lavish use of fu (charms) which include amulets, talismans, and
prayer charms.

\[13\] Tianhou was born into a seafarer's family with the name of Lin, and blessed with
special spiritual powers which she used to help her family and others. In particular, she
is well remembered for having saved her brothers who were caught in a storm at sea, by
going out to them in spirit and guiding them to safety. Eventually her divinity was
recognised and temples built in her honour.

The Festival of the Nine Emperor gods

An example of a popular festival observed in Singapore and Malaysia,
where all the pomp and circumstance of the Taoist religion may be
observed is that of the Nine Emperor gods. While there are many versions
recounting the origin of this festival, the Singapore version has it that
these are the nine divine brothers in charge of life, death, health, disease,
happiness, fortune, prosperity, wealth and longevity. The festival gets
under way on the last day (18th or 19th) of the eighth Moon. This festival
may be said to be proto-typically "taoist" or "shénistic" in the sense that
one sees the central concerns of the faithful, namely, the veneration of life,
the need for protection against evil spirits, and the pursuit for a long,
peaceful, healthy and wealthy life.

The display of these sentiments is clearly represented in the myth, ritual
and symbol which form the dominant pillars of the Nine Emperor God
Festival.16 The start of the festival is signified by the erection of a
gaodeng (tall lamp) to the left of the temple-square. Here, a consecration
ritual is performed to purify the temple ground, and the spirit soldier of
heaven, earth, and water and fire are released and deployed. Actual
celebrations begin with the staging of an Amoy opera on the first day of
the Ninth Moon and reach a climax on the ninth day, with a Koujun
(special feasts to the spirit soldiers and the laity) on the third, sixth and
ninth days. The end of the celebration - on the tenth day ~ is marked by
the lowering of the tall lamp and the recalling of the spirit soldiers from
their respective posts.

The festival also sees street processions, starting from the temple, led by
two disciples carrying one half of the Eight Trigrams flag and others with
musical instruments. During the festival devotees have to offer tea, fruits,
flowers, and money and sacrifice of joss-sticks and white candles, burning
of incense paper, paper images, charm papers and others. Here, a trance
dance and trance rituals are performed by spirit mediums. While in spirit-
mediumship, the spirit deity conveys a message that is comprehensible
and translatable; in spirit possession, the spirit does not convey any
message. The trance dance and rituals are performed in the streets and

vicinity of the temple and are supposed to purify the environment. When
the lion in the lion dance exhales, for instance, its breath is believed to
repel yin forces and when it inhales, it is believed to draw in yang forces
from the surrounding area. By so doing, the lion attracts yang and repels
yin, thereby insuring harmony in the environment. The same effect is also
produced by the fireball or spiked-ball display. In this display, spirit-
mediums would either kick the red-hot iron ball, or swing a spiked-ball
around. This kicking and swinging actions are supposed to enact the
incandescent state of the primal universe to produce the five elements -
fire, wood, water, earth and metal. The underlying significance here is to
ensure the equilibrium of the universe in which humans live.

Having discussed the essential features of popular Taoism or Shénism as
it is practised in Singapore, I will now compare it with the Baha'i Faith;
firstly, in terms of their spiritual/theological principles and secondly, their
social orientation.

Comparing Spiritual and Theological Principles

First, it must be pointed out that there are certain features of Taoism
which are strikingly in harmony with the Baha'i Faith. Both the Taoist
religion and the Baha'i Faith believe that the great religions originate from
the same source, and that in reality, there are no differences between their
persons, words, messages, acts, and manners.17 This feature also explains
why, historically, Taoism was able to assimilate and accommodate
aspects of shamanism, Confucianism and Buddhism over the years. The
Baha'i Faith is also as inclusive in spirit as Taoism in the sense that there
is a stress on the removal of religious prejudices and the establishment of
a spirit of valuation and recognition of other religions that far transcends
mutual tolerance. However, Baha'is would go one step further by
advancing the concept of progressive revelation - that is, that the God or

\[17\] This idea can be likened to the Chinese saying that tributaries branching out from
the same river may start off at different points and time, bearing different names, but
the supply of water content that each receives from its sources does not vary. It is the
water rather than the name of the tributaries that serve a purpose for humanity.

Supreme Ultimate sends various prophets at different times in history
bearing both a spiritual and social message.

There are other threads of connection. As a salvation religion, Taoism
gives special importance to a Messiah figure who would usher in an epoch
of Great Peace. This is found especially in the Tai-p'ing chng (Classic of
the Great Peace). Although incomplete and partially restored (7 th century
AD), it is sometimes regarded as the most important text after the Tao-te
ching. It offers a doctrine of salvation, with a saviour or "divine man", in
possession of a "celestial book", who teaches the return of ideal
government while awaiting the arrival in the fullness of time of the Great
Peace.18 Baha'fs believe that the advent of Baha'u'llah is the fulfilment
of this prophesy as well as other similar prophecies in other Holy
Scriptures.19 They believe that Baha'u'llah is the "Great One" predicted
in various scriptures, including the Taoist scripture, Who will usher in a
period of Great Peace unique in human history and Who is destined to
fulfil the prophecies of the Founders of earlier religions.20

Certainly, like all great religions which have stood the test of time,
Taoism has contributed towards the pool of not only the spiritual but also
the material knowledge of humankind, for example, the development of
such sciences as chemistry, mineralogy, and geography in China can be
traced to Taoism.21 Furthermore, Taoism has also helped to regulate the
moral life and unlock human potential. As a religion, it has

\[18\] Also, according to Taoist belief, Lao-tzu has the power to appear in other times and
places as well as the personification of the Tao. In this regard, a number of Taoist
scriptures are devoted to the numerous transformation of Lao-tzu - the number is
usually 81 ( 9 x 9 ) because of its perceived magical significance. See also Ching, J.
Chinese Religions and Practices in Southeast Asia.

76; Dinkird (23).

\[20\] Many Chinese have dreamt of the Great Peace. Towards the middle of the 2nd
Century, a master, Chang Chiieh, had a revelation that the advent of the Great Peace
(ťa'-ping), which should be the commencement of the earthly paradise, would come
with special signs. See Chew, The Chinese Religion and the Bahd't Faith.

characteristically emphasised the importance of good deeds and the
accumulation of merit. In its unique way, it taught that to become a
"celestial immortal", the highest grade of immortals, one needed to
perform at least thirteen hundred good deeds; to become a lower grade
immortal, no less than three hundred were deemed necessary. Later, when
the genre of Taoist writings known as "ledgers of merit and demerit"
gained currency, the moral teachings of Taoism become even more
widespread. Essentially, this type of religious practice resembles an
account book in which daily actions are classified as good and bad deeds,
each of which is assigned a fixed number of merit or demerit points in late
imperial China.22 Like all the other world religions, the BaháT Faith also
has a great deal of ethical teachings focusing on virtues such as unity,
justice, love, truthfulness, trustworthiness, detachment, humility,
reverence, courtesy and kindness, although not always classifiable or
accountable in such strict material terms as "merit" and "demerit" points.

There are of course as many differences as there are similarities.
Although God is the one unnameable, invisible, the mother of all things in
philosophical Taoism, there is in religious Taoism, the existence of the
pantheon of gods and spirits in the Taoist religion, most of whom have
anthropomorphic names, human characteristics and memorable faces.
Here the BaháT Faith is more akin to philosophical Taoism since it
declares that nothing can describe or give form to "the Absolute";23 its
scripture emphatically asserts that "He is indeed a true believer in the
unity of God, who, in this Day will regard Him as One immeasurably
exalted above all comparisons and likenesses with which men have
compared Him."24 For the Chinese peasants however, spirits and ghosts
were regarded as secondary sources of life and were worshipped and

\[22\] Another type of Taoist writings known as "morality books" became extremely
popular. These aimed at promoting good deeds and subscribed to the six morat
teachings adopted by the government, that is, filial piety, respect for age and authority,
harmony with neighbours and friends and moral instruction for one's descendant
especially proper conduct and avoiding improper behaviour.

\[23\] Philosophical Taoism with the portrayal of "the way" as absolute and transcendent,
is closer in spirit to the Baha'i Faith. See Chew, Phyllis Ghim lian, "The Great Tao",
Journal of Baha'i Studies, 4, 2, 1991.

Publishing Trust, 3rd edn. 1976, p 337

thanked for their benevolence. As maintainers of life on earth, the spirits
of rivers, trees and mountains were also venerated.

It must be noted that while there may be countless gods and goddesses in
the Taoist pantheon, in principle, they are all under the command of a
sovereign high God and have their specific station in the divine hierarchy.
In other words, while polytheism is the popular image of Taoism, it is
actually monotheism which underlies the religious attitude of the Chinese.
A practical reason also accounts for Taoism polytheistic exterior. For a
religion catering to the needs of a much earlier era, the "unknowable" and
remote Tao as expounded in the Tao-te ching of Lao-tzu did not offer
much consolation to the primitive mind. An anthropomorphic pantheon of
gods therefore evolved through time to allow devotees to turn to more
approachable deities who may be of inferior rank but n^'e heless able to
dispense blessings or intercede on their behalf.

It is intellectually difficult for agrarian people of an earlier age to be
comfortable with an absolutely transcendental God, Who, by His own
Will created a spatio-temporal universe within the framework of
contingency. Popular Taoism therefore conceived the Supreme Ultimate
as a kind of immanent transcendental being.25 This immanence is often
expressed emphatically by the immanent universal love and union of
Earth and Heaven. This concept of cosmic union involves the idea of the
one and single God immanent in everything.26 The love of Heaven is
united with that of Earth and everything that is in it. Here, Heaven is
perceived as "giving" and Earth as "receiving". Giving belongs to the
sphere of centripetal power yang; receiving is within the sphere of
centrifugal power yin. The confluence of the two powers, like a
symphony of love, produces an infinite variety of form and colour of
lives.

\[25\] This attribution of transcendence to Tao however is challenged by those who
inspired by the writings of philosopher A. N. Whitehead, consider Taoism to be a kind
of process philosophy. They consider Tao to be immanent, the sum total of being and
non-being.

Philosophy, 17, 1990, p 157-174.

82             THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

While the expression of this dual force takes on a very Chinese
colouring, it should be noted that the Baha'i scriptures, interestingly
enough, also acknowledge these two forces.27 However, the Baha'i
Faith's version of immanence is slightly different. It expounds that in a
sense, the whole of creation is infused with the "presence" of the
Creator. However, while causality is indeed the universal law, yet the
effect is not the Cause (in this instance" the Creator"). Hence the Baha'i
Faith distinguishes "immanence" (presence) from "identity" (essence).
While adherents of religious Taoism believe that they can merge with
God or become God while in a trance, Baha'is view this claim as
misguided since it would again mean merging the cause with the effect.
Here, philosophical Taoism is more in harmony with the Baha'i Faith
since it stresses the transcendence of Tao. The distinction between
essence and presence is clearly emphasised in the Baha'i Faith: "How
can I claim to have known Thee when the entire creation is bewildered
by Thy Mystery, and how can I confess not to have known Thee, when,
lo the whole universe proclaimeth Thy Presence and testifieth to Thy
Truth?"28 In other words, while the Creation is infused with the
Creator's presence, the Creation is not synonymous with the Creator.

Again, while both Taoist and Baha'i generally concur that the status of
the departed spirit can be either promoted or degraded, and that progress
in the spiritual world is influenced by the intercession of others through
prayers and good works done on earth in the name of the departed, yet
there the similarity ends. This is because popular Taoism has elevated the
practice of this principle to the status of "ancestor worship", where death
ceremonies and anniversaries of ancestors become elaborate and costly

Consider the following quotation from the Baha'i scriptures: 'They have said that
the potentialities (qabiliyyat) and the recipients of the potentialities (maqbulat) came
into being and were created simultaneously. For example, it has been stated that all
things are composed of two elements: the "Fashioner" (qabil) and the "Fashioned
(maqbul). By "Fashioned" is meant substance (madda) and primary matter (huyula),
and by Fashioner is meant form and shape, which confines and limits the primary
matter from its state of indefiniteness and freedom to the courtyard of limitation and
definite form." (Makatib 2:35) A provisional translation by Moojan Momen in Bahai
Studies Bulletin 3.4.26-27.

Publishing Trust, 1976 p. 63.

ritualistic affairs. Thus, while the motive is shared - gratitude towards
parents and grandparents for the gift of life - its expression is not.
Religious Taoism has made ancestor worship into a fine art; for the
Baha'i, simplicity and sincerity is the keynote, that is, it is the intention
rather than the form which is valued and emphasised.

Another disparity is that while there are many different Taoist sects
rivalling one another for supremacy and orthodox status, the Baha'i Faith
has remained united in creed and practice throughout the world. While
this fact is often explained away by referring to the age difference — the
Baha'i Faith is only approximately 150 years old in comparison to more
than 2,000 years of Taoism, yet this is not the most important reason. The
unity of the Baha'i community is predicated upon clear and detailed
instructions for the organisation of Baha'i society, which exist within its
sacred text. There is no provision for clergy in the Baha'i Faith. Explicit
instructions concerning successorship is also given. Baha'u'llah clearly
named a successor in His Last Will and Testament, also known as the
Book of the Covenant. This written convenant is unique among the
world's major religions29, and has safeguarded the Baha'i Faith against
division or the rise of individual leadership in the governing of the Baha'i
community, despite it having spread to every nook and cranny of the
planet within its short history of 150 years. Of course, in the case of
Taoism, the process of succession is not an issue since the foremost
proclaimer of the "Tao", Lao Tzu (an anonymous term meaning "old
man") did not claim to be a prophet. As Chew (1993) has noted, while the
Baha'i Faith is a religion in the conventional sense, with a prophet and a
revelation; the Chinese religion in which Taoism plays a major part, is "a
religion without revelation".30 Since there is no dogma based on divine
revelation, or a church as guardian of unchangeable dogmatic truth,
everyone is free to believe anything he or she chooses. The Taoist official
of a particular region may be loosely connected, have a regular job and

\[29\] Jesus obliquely indicated the primacy of Peter, but the comment recorded leaves
room for doubt about its significance. Nor was the guidance given by Muhammad about
His successor enough to prevent Islam splitting into many sects, each recognising a
different line of succession after Muhammad.

It is possible that the timelessness of the Tao-te ching is due to the inspiration
received from an earlier revelation in China's history. See Chew, The Chinese Religion
and the Bahá Y Faith, pp. 49-51.              r

put on priestly vestment only when the occasion arises. In such a
situation, it was not surprising to find great regional variation in the
practice of Taoism. Taoism has, for example, no precise membership
requirements, a point of divergence with not only the Baha'f Faith but the
other major religions, where a believer is defined a little more stringently,
usually by a set of doctrines and practices. Baha'is define their members
as those who have accepted BaháVlláh as the messenger of God for this
age, and this often requires that the member sign a declaration card to that
effect for administrative purposes, including also the electoral roll for the
annual election of their governing bodies.

Possessing multifarious ceremonies andrituals,religious Taoism is also at
variance with the Baha'f Faith. In popular Taoism, ritualistic practices
tend to take the centerstage and often the intention behind the ritual is
forgotten; in the Baha'f Faith, deeds are stressed over rituals, as they are
in the high moral and ethical teachings described by Lao-tzu. For Baha'fs,
a good life does not comprise so much the performance of rituals, but of
praiseworthy moral conduct and righteous deeds to their fellow human
beings. Indeed, the Baha'f scripture points out that "one hour's reflection
is preferable to seventy years of pious worship."31 For the Baha'f, religion
is more than just a system of teaching, commandments, prohibitions, rites
and customs; it is in fact a living, active and transforming force. It must
be acknowledged, however, that popular Taoist rituals serve a function
since they enable their observers to fill their lives with a significance
which they would not otherwise have. Community thanksgiving
celebrations, for example, offer a helpful avenue to reassert good will and
harmony among the members of the community. The engagement of a
ritual often fills the empty spaces in the lives of the adherents and gives
than a connection to the past, providing a satisfactory answer to most, if
not all, of the major questions and quests for life. The difference between
religious Taoism and the Baha'f Faith lies centrally in the degree of how
much priority form should have over essence.

The belief in evil forces, the personification of demons in the Taoist
religion, and the elaborate measures to exorcise them through spirit-

Publishing Trust, 1975.

mediums is also at distinct variance with the relatively more "scientific"
Baha'i Faith, since Baha'u'llah taught that evil has no intrinsic existence
as a separate entity. In the Baha'i scriptures, darkness is described as the
absence of light, hence evil is the absence of good in the same way as
ignorance is the lack of knowledge and hatred the lack of love.
Nevertheless, and in all fairness to Taoism, we must remember that
religious Taoism emerged at a time when the masses were credulous and
mostly uneducated people with no scientific knowledge. If one can see
popular Taoism or shénism as the religion of man's childhood and a
solace to his innermost apprehensions, one may understand that
humanity's spiritual fears and aspirations has always been intrinsically
similar, only that the expression in man's childhood tends to take on more
personified and concrete forms.

Comparing Social Principles

While the spiritual/theological teachings of all religions are basically
similar in terms of their collective belief in an ultimate goal or Being, the
existence of an afterlife and the necessity of good deeds in the material
world of existence, each of them also contain social laws such as those
pertaining to food, marriage, etc. which are peculiar to them alone. The
Baha'i Faith teaches that each religious personage, from Zoroaster,
Buddha etc., on to Baha'u'llah has appeared at different times and in
different places, and thus given laws and ordinances befitting the needs of
the particular time of their appearance.

While the essential spiritual core of religion remains as it always has
been, the evolving aspect concerns the socio-political conditions which
require new laws to fit the different requirements that change from age to
age. Every body of belief, whether religious or secular, has a vision and
ideal. For example, Marx proposes the ideal of an egalitarian society
where there are no classes and no exploitation, and where each individual
receives benefits according to his true needs. Confucianism finds supreme
harmony in a disciplined and ordered human relationship. Buddhism
perceives all reality as interdependent and teaches man to achieve union
with it through rejection of the drives and desires of a separate ego.
Taoism finds harmony in nature and naturalness and dreams of

86            THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ'Í STUDIES REVIEW

immortality beyond life on earth. For the Baha'i the essential goal is to
achieve a vision that is world-embracing and one which would lead to the
unity of mankind and the establishment of a world civilisation based on
peace and justice.

If there is a major difference between religious Taoism and the Baha'i
Faith, it lies centrally in the area of social rather than spiritual principles.
Appearing in the mid- 19th Century, the Baha'i Faith brings with it
distinctive social laws which are necessarily absent in the Taoist
framework. For the first time in history, a religion has explicitly stated
that humanity can and must create an international federation capable of
co-ordinating the use of the earth's resources and solving the problems
facing the entire planet. A high priority is given in the Baha'i Faith to the
just resolution of regional and international conflicts. Efforts are made to
forge a unified approach to environmental degradation, and to establish
conditions where the free movement of goods, services and peoples across
the globe becomes possible.

There is a clear recognition in the Baha'i Holy Writings of the inordinate
disparity between the rich and poor as a source of acute suffering and one
which keeps the world in a state of instability, virtually on the brink of
war. There is a call for all people to internalise the principle of the
oneness of humanity. The implementation of a world auxiliary language
and a standard script, in addition to the mother tongue, is also advocated
as a basis for improved communication between all inhabitants of the
world.32 For Baha'is, social problems must be resolved on the basis of
universal justice. All the resources for the world must be exploited for the
benefit of mankind as a whole.

Another unique social principle of the Baha'i faith, which is a non-issue in
both philosophical and religious Taoism, is that men and women have
equal rights. Women have traditionally played a lesser role in the
patriarchal pantheon of the Taoist religion with most of the major gods
being men. In the Baha'i Faith, the question of equality of education and
opportunity for the female sex takes precedence worldwide. Its scriptures

\[32\] See Chew, Phyllis Ghim lian. "Whither the International Auxiliary Language?"
Journal of Baha'i Studies, 2.2. 1989, pp 1-11.

unequivocally pronounce the equal status of women as the touchstone for
a mature, society, which has given up discriminating against or
suppressing any group on the basis of biological difference.

An additional feature which sets the Baha'i Faith apart from Taoist
beliefs and practices and which places it squarely in the 20th Century is its
pronouncement that religion must be in harmony with science and reason,
that is, religion and science must complement one another and not be
mutually exclusive. Baha'is believe that value-free science without
religious and moral attachment fosters materialism. Similarly religion
without the influence of science often leads to fanaticism. Last but not
least, the Baha'i scripture also stresses that all people must independently
seek the truth with determination and a critical mind, a demand which
Baha'is deem essential because preconceptions hamper the irrefutable
growth of contact between people, races and religions and are a hindrance
to the goal of unification. As the Baha'i Faith is devoid of a clergy (a
significant departure from all previous religions, including religious
Taoism), the independent investigation of truth becomes a crucial
principle.

Conclusion

To be human is to question, and to engage in a variety of quests; for
survival, for liberty, for truth, for happiness, and, in many cases, for some
kind of meaning to life.There are at least six combinations of fundamental
questions and resulting quests comprising human existence. One is
survival: "What must I do to survive?" Next is security: "What can I hold
on to?" or "In whom can I put my trust?" Next is to do with quality of
life: "How can I be happy?". Another common quest is personal identity
"Who am I?" Then there are the transpersonal goals which has brought
forth the quest for truth, excellence, liberty and justice in all periods of
history, such as: "What is the meaning of life?", "Is there a purpose to my
existence?" and "How can I make this world a better place?" In the past,
adherents of religious Taoism have been essentially preoccupied with the
first three questions, being concerned primarily with issues of personal
survival and well-being. The Baha'i Faith, on the other hand, emphasises

88            THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

both personal salvation and social salvation, viewing the two as inter-
related.

It is difficult to reconcile religious Taoism with many classic Taoist texts
such as the Tao-te ching and the Chuang-tzu. Two thousand years of
tradition has set it apart. Religious Taoism has evolved over centuries to
fulfil basic human needs and concerns about the Ultimate and as a result
has accumulated an enormous "bible" of esoteric texts, comprehensible
only to those with special competence. There has also developed a grand
liturgical tradition based on ritual texts, a well-defined eremitic tradition
and distinctive techniques towards transcendent immortality.

Nevertheless, religious Taoism may be viewed as an adaptive set of
strategies for people to cope with their relationship to life, death and
immortality since it offers immediate attention to the devotee and uses a
holistic approach to solve individual problems. Centred on the creation of
harmony between the different worlds of existence and of the relationship
between man and the "spirit" of nature, it affirms the mystical experience
while encouraging a moral life.

Like everything ancient, religious Taoism has to confront the challenges
of societal change. Religious Taoism has been dying for centuries and
modern science and materialism is speeding up the process. Whether it
can continue to survive the test of time and prosper in the modern world
will depend largely on its effort to rein in excesses, renew its spiritual
vigour and serve the needs of a changing society. The Baha'i Faith can be
a way to renew its spiritual life, and apply it to the modern world - a way
to revive it today. It shares with Taoism important fundamental spiritual
values and introduces social principles compatible with the spirit of the
20th Century.

In the period 1980-1990 in Singapore, the number of Taoist/Buddhist
adherents declined from 73% to 68% of the population,33 most of its
remaining adherents coming from the less-educated Chinese-speaking

1990 Advance Data Release. Dept. Of Statistics, Singapore.

segment of the population.34 A 1988 survey of Singapore religions found
that a significant 74.5% of Chinese respondents with no formal education
claim to be Taoist/Shénists, while Christianity seems to appeal to those
with higher education. A correlation was also found between the medium
of instruction (Chinese, English etc) and religious affiliation.
Taoism/Shénism is seen as a religion of the Chinese-educated sector of the
population while Christianity is seen as the religion of the English-
educated. Also, Christianity is on the increase among the younger age
group and this is done at the expense of Taoism.35

In recent years, the Singapore Taoist community has risen to the
challenge. The recently formed (in 1990) Taoist Federation of Singapore
has begun to organise public talks and has encouraged the publication of
literature both in Chinese and English. Its promotion of philosophical
Taoism, rather than religious Taoism is an attempt to return to the
beginning and to emphasise essence over form. It promotes the intrinsic
essence of mysticism, naturalism and simplicity rather than the rites and
rituals of popular Taoism.36 The community has also initiated the
modernising of Chinese temples such as the great Bright Hill Buddhist
Temple, the Tua Peh Kong Temple at Kusu or the Siong Lim Temple at
Toa Payoh — such as renovations, repainting of car parks and
construction of new buildings.37

To conclude, it is obvious that there is a great variety in appearance,
metaphors, and terminology in all the great religions. In this paper, I have
attempted to draw out similarities and differences between one of the

oldest and the youngest religions of the Chinese as practised in Singapore.
The greatest differences between the Taoist religion and the Baha'i Faith
lie in their social laws, vision and practices, rather than in their spiritual
aspirations. Religions' greatest affinity with one another, however, is their
intrinsic spiritual concern with life, death and immortality. All the great
religions have been the foundation of great cultures, and for thousands of
years, provided the moral beacon and ballast for millions of people in
their everyday life. As the / Ching reiterates: "In this world there, are
many different roads but the destination is the same. There are a hundred
deliberations but the result is one."38 The aim of the Baha'i Faith is to
revive the spiritual traditions and extend their teachings to the modern
world.

I am no longer a child and the gods which adorn the altars of my ancestors
have long since been discarded. In their former places of abode, tall
skyscrapers have arisen, reflecting the concerns of a current materialistic
age. Nevertheless, these childhood images of pious worship and deep
reverence to spirits and ancestors have retained a special place in my
heart. If it is true that the child is the father of the man, then in some way,
such images must have helped me to seek and recognise the truth, the
enduring and the sacred, in other places and forms. I continue to walk the
path of my ancestors but with modern shoes. I pray, I worship and give
thanks for blessings and I am sure if my ancient ancestors were alive, they
would have given Baha'uTlah a place of honour on the altar of worship,
believing sincerely in their hearts, that the spirit of this Great Being,
whatever His origin and history, is deserving of praise and veneration and
which comes, naturally, under the umbrella of the unfathomable,
unreachable and utterly remote being -- the Great Tao.
