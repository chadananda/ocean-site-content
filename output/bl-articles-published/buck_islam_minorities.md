Islam and Minorities:
The Case of the Bahá’ís

Christopher Buck∗

Of all religious minorities in the Middle East, Bahá’ís are typically
the least able to practice their religion freely. With several notable
exceptions, the current situation throughout the modern Middle
East and in Muslim countries generally is that Bahá’ís cannot
openly promote their faith. However, the governments of Pakistan
and Bangladesh allow the Bahá’ís to hold public meetings, publicly
teach the Faith, establish Bahá’í centers, as well as elect Bahá’í
administrative councils (known as local and national “spiritual
assemblies”). In Pakistan, moreover, government officials have
occasionally attended events at Bahá’í centers. And in Indonesia,
after several decades of quiet growth, the Faith is now legally
recognized and its adherents free to elect spiritual assemblies (Bahá’í
councils). In Turkey, the Bahá’í Faith has been legal for decades.
The Bahá’í community enjoys legal status in Albania and in most
Central Asian nations as well. Over the past few years, a
groundswell of articles and dialogue on this subject has appeared.
Persian-language media in the United States have begun to openly
talk about the plight of the Bahá’ís in Iran, with some predicting
that, in Iran’s future civil society, even the Bahá’ís must be given
freedom of religion. Moreover, several non-Bahá’í Iranian academics
are beginning to speak out about the conspiracy of silence against
the Faith. Evidence, in the form of listener feedback, indicates that a

wide-ranging audience in Iran is listening to daily Persian-language
Bahá’í shortwave and satellite broadcasts.1 Speaking out on the state
of affairs with respect to governments that have implemented anti-
Bahá’í measures, however, is sensitive and has to be approached
with a certain degree of delicacy.

To criticize an Islamic state in which a small Bahá’í enclave
exists could literally imperil that community. What freedom of
religion they may enjoy is precarious. At best, Bahá’ís continue to
lead a virtually clandestine existence. At worst, in those extreme
cases in which its institutions were proscribed by law, Bahá’ís have
simply dissolved their elected administrative councils in keeping
with the Bahá’í principles of loyalty to “just governments” and
compliance with the rule of law. Since Bahá’ís are forbidden to act
against their respective governments in any way, it is imprudent—
even dangerous—to inventory the situation country by country.
The Islamic Republic of Iran is a special case, however, because its
anti-Bahá’í policies are notorious and have been openly condemned
by the international community for nearly a quarter of a century.
This notoriety has, like the Salman Rushdie affair, resulted in much
negative press for both Iran as a country and, more unfortunately,
for Islam as a religion, even though Iran’s practice of Islam is
peculiar to its own form of Shi‘ism. This paper will argue that “the
Bahá’í question” raises serious questions in the West over just how
“tolerant” Islam really is. One may say that popular perceptions of
Islam will increasingly be shaped by how Muslim countries treat
their minorities, especially religious minorities. The Bahá’í case,
with the possible exception of the Ahmadiyyah in Pakistan,2 is the
premier test case of Islamic claims to religious tolerance.

Muslims, is a case in point, in which Mirza Ghulam Ahmad’s claim to revelation has
precluded an Ahmadi’s right to openly practice Islam. See Antonio R. Gualtieri,

Buck: Islam and Minorities

The definitive study of the Bahá’í question in Iran is Nazila
Ghanea’s Human Rights, the U.N. and the Bahá’ís in Iran,3 written
with special reference to international human rights law. In Iran,
where the Bahá’í Faith originated, Bahá’ís have historically been the
target of persecution. This is all fully documented, of course. Much
ink has been spilled over the bloodshed. Skipping over the history
of their persecution to focus on the case of the Bahá’í question in
Islamic Iran, one may simply say that the Islamic Revolution of
1979 in Iran refocused the synergistic fusion of clerical and state
intolerance of Iran’s largest religious minority, the Bahá’ís. Since
the early days of the revolution, Bahá’ís have been subjected to
systematic torture, execution, and economic deprivation until
international pressure caused the regime to alter its plans to
exterminate the Bahá’í community. From 1982 to 2001, the UN
International Commission on Human Rights had, for nearly each
year for twenty consecutive years, adopted a resolution decrying
the human rights situation in Iran. The oppression is now relatively
quiescent, but still systemic.

While the postrevolutionary persecution of Bahá’ís in Iran has
attenuated, a subtle strangulation of the Bahá’í community is now
in effect, evidenced recently by unprovoked arrests and short-term
detentions of Bahá’ís, confiscation of Bahá’í properties, summary
seizures of liquid assets, wrongful denial of rightful pensions,
desecration or destruction of Bahá’í cemeteries, official and public
denunciations of the Bahá’í religion, harassment of Bahá’í teachers
and students, the effective barring of qualified Bahá’í students from
higher education, and the barring of Bahá’ís from all government
employment enforced as a matter of official policy and adroitly
orchestrated. All attempts to obtain redress are procedurally
frustrated or systematically denied, as Bahá’ís have no legal recourse
under Iran’s constitution. Particularly egregious has been the recent

Ronald, 2002). See also Paul D. Allen, “The Bahá’ís of Iran: A Proposal for

destruction of Bahá’í sacred sites in Iran, comparable to the
Taliban’s demolition of two towering Buddha figures in Bamiyan,
Afghanistan, in 2001.4 This might be more comprehensible,
although no less justifiable, had Bahá’ís acted against Iran or Islam—
both of which they respect and honor. Paradoxically, Bahá’ís have a
strong belief in the prophethood of Muhammad and in the
authenticity and veracity of the Qur’an. The situation is even more
peculiar for a Bahá’í academic, like myself, teaching Islam5 in an
effort to counteract the cultural Islamophobia that still
predominates in the West, as the UN has rightly noted. 6

So why are Bahá’ís denied full freedom of religion throughout
many states in the Muslim Middle East? There are two principal
reasons for this: (1) Bahá’ís lack dhimmi (protected) status and are
therefore excluded from Qur’anic protection, and (2) the Bahá’í
Faith is a post-Islamic religion7—a theoretical impossibility
considering Muhammad’s ontological status as the “Seal of the
Prophets” (Qur’an 33:40). Apart from the Day of Judgment, Islam
cannot conceive of a post-Islamic act of revelation, much less
theologically tolerate a post-Islamic claim to revelation. Since the
two founding figures of the Bahá’í religion, known as the Bab
(Sayyid ‘Ali-Muhammad Shirazi, d. 1850) and Baha’u’llah (Mirza
Husayn ‘Ali Nuri, d. 1892), had each advanced theophanic claims,8
it is quite impossible, Islamically speaking, to accord Bahá’ís full

civil and religious rights. In Islamic countries where this religion is
proscribed or highly regulated with oppressive effect, the Bahá’í
Faith should not exist, whether in theory or in practice. The
problem is that it does.

However, legal recognition of the Bahá’í Faith is not without
historical and legal precedent in the Middle East. In 1924, an
Egyptian court ruled that the Bahá’í Faith is a distinct religion; the
same conclusion was reached in a landmark case in Turkey in 1959.
Suffice it to say that prevailing Islamic theologies of pluralism are
inclusivist at best, in which “recognized” religious minorities may
enjoy Qur’anic protection—but without parity, since such groups
have a secondary status. Such legal recognition typically excludes
Bahá’í faith-communities throughout those countries in the Muslim
Middle East that abide strictly by a conservatively interpreted
Qur’anic and hadith-based legal code. Secularist models appear to
afford more protection (in the form of legal recourse) for the
Bahá’ís.

Although the Islamic position is doctrinally understandable,
sometimes it is morally wrong (by civil rights standards) to be
doctrinally “right.” The theologically unacceptable prospect of a
post-Islamic revelation has justified morally repugnant efforts to
extirpate the Bahá’í community in certain Muslim countries. This
goes far to explain why Bahá’ís either have no constitutional rights
(as under the Iranian constitution) or have restricted rights in
certain other Islamic states. In this respect, the Iranian constitution
contradicts the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, to which
Iran is a signatory. These two documents stand in tension with each
other, as will be explained. 9

Historically, of course, such policies and practices failed to
contain the new religion. In fact, the Bahá’í Faith is now a
“transplanted” religion in the West, and, to make matters worse
perhaps, the Bahá’í community has established its administrative

capital, the Bahá’í World Centre, on Mt. Carmel in Haifa, Israel,
thereby exposing Bahá’ís to charges of Zionism and spying for Israel
as popular pretexts for persecution. It should be noted that the
Bahá’í World Centre has its historical origins in what was once
Ottoman Syria, then British Palestine, and now Israel. This dates
back to August 1868, when Sultan ‘Abdu’l-‘Aziz exiled Baha’u’llah
to the fortress of St. Jean d’Acre in ‘Akka for lifetime incarceration
in what was universally reputed to be the worst penal colony in the
Ottoman Empire.

Early in their history, the Bahá’ís, both gradually and, in some
cases, suddenly, rejected their Islamic ethos in favor of a full
symbolic10 and practical identification with a new religious
movement seen as an independent religion. This has effectively
distanced the Bahá’í claim to revelation from its immediate Islamic
context. Interestingly, the Bahá’í Faith is the first and only religion
in Canada to have been incorporated by an act of Parliament (1949).
Obviously, such legal recognition and protection has not been
afforded the Bahá’ís in a number of countries throughout the
Muslim Middle East, especially in the turbulent aftermath of the
Iranian Revolution of 1979. Except for the 444-day hostage crisis,
the revolution was relatively peaceful, but its consequences were
often violent and continue to be repressive. In 1980, immediately
after the revolution, Canada took the lead in sponsoring human
rights legislation within the UN and mobilized other member states
and nongovernmental agencies (NGOs) in successfully passing a
series of UN resolutions—on an almost yearly basis—for nearly a
quarter of a century. These resolutions have pressured Iran to
honor the several international human rights instruments to which
it has freely subscribed as a signatory.

The latest in this series of resolutions was adopted by the UN
General Assembly on 21 November 2003.11 According to one

December 2004. Passed by a vote of seventy-one to fifty-four, the Canadian-sponsored

report: “By a vote of 73 to 49, with 50 abstentions, the Third
Committee of the United Nations General Assembly approved a
resolution today that expresses ‘serious concern’ over continuing
violations of human rights in Iran—and mentions specifically
‘continuing discrimination’ against Bahá’ís and other religious
minorities.”12 The resolution “welcomes [. . .] reports that religion
will no longer be requested in the registration of births, marriages,
divorces or deaths” (1[c]). The resolution also approves “[t]he re-
establishment of the Majlis [Iranian Parliament’s] Human Rights
Commission” with the hope that this body would complement the
efforts undertaken by the Islamic Human Rights Commission (1[f]).

The Islamic Human Rights Commission was established in
March 1995 by Ayatollah Yazdi, following the precedent set in
1994 when the Iranian Parliament established its committee of
thirteen deputies. To the best of my knowledge, neither of these
two Iranian commissions has dealt with “the Bahá’í question.” Such
Iranian governmental human rights organizations, according to
Reza Afshari, are little more than “smoke-and-mirrors.”13
Resolution 56/171 acknowledged that Iran had committed itself to

grounds.” The resolution decries the “continuing discrimination against persons
belonging to minorities, including Christians, Jews, and Sunnis, and the increased
discrimination against the Bahá’ís, including cases of arbitrary arrest and detention, the
denial of free worship or of publicly carrying out communal affairs, the disregard of
property rights, the destruction of sites of religious importance, the suspension of
social, educational, and community-related activities, and the denial of access to higher
education, employment, pensions, and other benefits.” See “UN Expresses Concern

of the Rights of Religious Minorities,” but this committee has yet to
be launched. Even if it were, the Bahá’í Faith would probably not
fall under its purview. The Bahá’í question is not even a question. It
is a foregone conclusion—viz., that this religion should never be
allowed to flourish under an Islamic system. But to give entrance to
that policy vitiates any claim to equal protection, procedural or
substantive due process, or any other democratic principle that
Islamic states may wish to claim.

Iran has consistently stated that the Bahá’í Faith is not a
religion, but a political community, notwithstanding the fact that
Bahá’ís are studiously apolitical to the extent that they abstain
entirely from partisan politics, which they see as adversarial and,
therefore, divisive. The resolution decries the “absence of due
process of law” and “expresses its concern [over] the continuing
discrimination against persons belonging to minorities, in particular
against Bahá’ís, Christians, Jews, and Sunnis.” The resolution “calls
upon” the Islamic Republic of Iran to “implement fully the
conclusions and recommendations of the Special Rapporteur of the
Commission on Human Rights on the question of religious
intolerance relating to the Bahá’ís and other minority groups, until
they are completely emancipated” (4[d]). Emancipation is simply
what the Bahá’ís are seeking. But, religiously, it seems too much to
ask of an Islamic theocracy. What force of law will ultimately
prevail in this situation? For all practical purposes, the immediate
solution appears to be the supremacy and preemptory authority of
international law over the laws of Islamic states on issues of human
rights. Ideally, international law will eventually become Islamicized,
culturally adapted to Muslim societies and states. But the reach and
force of international law is itself hampered by the fact that
freedom of religion has never been codified in international law.

Although freedom of religion is enshrined in Article 18 of the
Universal Declaration on Human Rights, its full codification in
international law has yet to be enacted. Adopted by the General
Assembly (without vote) in 1981, the UN “resolved to adopt all
necessary measures for the speedy elimination of such intolerance in

Buck: Islam and Minorities

all its forms and manifestations and to prevent and combat
discrimination on the ground of religion or belief.” (I would hazard
to say that this UN declaration was, in large part, actuated by the
crisis affecting the Bahá’ís of Iran.) Yet, over two decades later, the
UN’s Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance
and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief has yet to be
raised to the level of an international convention, even though UN
declarations on the elimination of racial discrimination and
discrimination against women have already been codified as
international law.

On 26 August 2002, at the World Summit on Sustainable
Development in Johannesburg, South Africa, the Bahá’í
International Community observed that the UN has not succeeded
in its efforts to secure freedom of religion under international law:

Unfortunately, the United Nations has been unable to move beyond its
Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of
Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, to create a convention on
freedom of religion and belief. The ability of the United Nations to transform
General Assembly declarations on race and on women into conventions only
highlights its lack of success in the area of religion and belief.

At issue here is the difference between a declaration and a
convention in the context of international law. The reason a
convention takes the force of international law is that it operates as
a multilateral treaty. International law expert Natan Lerner explains
that this declaration, while “obviously of great moral and political
significance,” is “not positive international law.”14 Another expert in
the field, Mohamed Eltayeb, points out that, in the aftermath of the
1979 revolution, a number of Muslim countries attempted “to

Orbis, 2000), 52.

construct alternative ‘Islamic’ human rights instruments,” which,
however, “have fallen far below the international standards.”15

Ironically, some of the UN human rights language has made its
way into the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Outlining the “General Principles” of the constitution, Article 13
states: “Zoroastrian, Jewish, and Christian Iranians are the only
recognized religious minorities, who, within the limits of the law,
are free to perform their religious rites and ceremonies, and to act
according to their own canon in matters of personal affairs and
religious education.”16 These three religions are considered by
Iranian clerics to be “people of the Book” and are therefore
accorded Qur’anic protection. The effect of this provision is to
deny Bahá’ís their freedom of religion. Bahá’ís are simply
considered apostates, and their blood may be shed with impunity,
perhaps even with religious sanction. Note that the vocabulary of
human rights, which has been used in the Iranian constitution, does
not carry the universal application characteristic of international
law. Elsewhere in the constitution, under the rubric, “The Rights of
the People,” Article 20 adds: “All citizens of the country, both men
and women, equally enjoy the protection of the law and enjoy all
human, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, in
conformity with Islamic criteria.”17 Clearly, the Bahá’ís do not
conform to these religious criteria. This provision neither
adumbrates the Bahá’ís as citizens nor vests them with rights. They
are a people within a state, yet legally without a state (in terms of
state protection), while being the target of that state. Bahá’ís are
deprived of fundamental human rights because they do not,
according to “Islamic criteria,” qualify collectively as a religion or
individually as “human.” In many cases, Bahá’ís have quite literally
been dehumanized. Ironically, international pressures may be the

single greatest factor in realizing certain Islamic reforms, which, of
course, will have to be read back into the Qur’an and backed by
supporting hadith, if only at the level of principle.

In the years immediately following the 1979 revolution, clerics
ordered the arbitrary arrest of Bahá’ís and the torture and execution
of over two hundred of them (particularly members of Bahá’í
administrative bodies, often with demands that their families pay
for the bullets used to kill them). Other actions taken against
Bahá’ís include confiscation of property, seizure of bank assets,
expulsion from schools and universities, denial of employment,
cancellation of pensions (with demands that the government be
reimbursed for past pension payments), desecration and destruction
of Bahá’í cemeteries and holy places, criminalizing Bahá’í activities
and thus forcing the dissolution of Bahá’í administration, and
pronouncing Bahá’í marriages as illegal acts of prostitution. In
addition, there were relentless propaganda campaigns aimed at
inflaming anti-Bahá’í passions to instigate mob violence and crimes
against Bahá’ís. There are many documented instances of this state-
instigated incitement to violence. This phase of the anti-Bahá’í
campaign has aptly been described as “civil death”18—a cultural
cleansing that collectively affects a community estimated to be three
hundred thousand to half a million Iranians.

After 1985, with Iran having been scandalized and sanctioned
for its violation of the rights of Bahá’ís and other religious
minorities, the number of executions of Bahá’ís sharply dropped,
and, in 1987 and 1988, most of the Bahá’ís being held in prison were
released. In the early 1980s, a proportionally large number of Bahá’í
children—probably most, but not all—had been expelled from
public and private schools in Iran. (Iran Rahimpour, my wife’s
maternal aunt, was executed in Dizfúl on 12 May 1982 for teaching
Bahá’í children’s classes during this period.) But international
pressure caused that policy to be rescinded, and, in the late 1980s,
the Iranian regime adopted a new policy of concealment. This shift
in anti-Bahá’í tactics masked a new and insidious strategy,

formalized in a secret 1991 memorandum from the Iranian Supreme
Revolutionary Cultural Council on “the Bahá’í question.” This
document surfaced in 1993, first appearing in the report by Special
Representative Reynaldo Galindo Pohl to the UN Commission on
Human Rights. The Bahá’í International Community has
reproduced a facsimile and translation as evidence of the systematic
nature    of    Iran’s anti-Bahá’í campaign.19           The policy
recommendations of this document are still in force.

Personally endorsed by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on 25

February 1991 and written by Dr. Seyyed Mohammad Golpaygani,
secretary of the Supreme Revolutionary Cultural Council, this
document advises government officials, among other things, to
expel Bahá’ís from universities, “once it becomes known that they
are Bahá’ís.” It further states: “Deny them employment if they
identify themselves as Bahá’ís”; “Deny them any position of
influence.” The policy effectively denies Bahá’ís the right to higher
education, a policy that had already been in effect since 1979.20 No
Bahá’í can, in practice, attend university in Iran. As a result, Bahá’ís
have organized the Bahá’í Institute for Higher Education (BIHE),
popularly known as “Bahá’í Open University,” which has also been
the target of government attack, especially in September 1998,
when thirty-six BIHE professors and staff were arrested, some five
hundred homes were raided, and equipment was confiscated. In an
effective variation on the policy of “ethnic cleansing,” Iranian
columnist Iqbal Latif calls Iran’s denial of Bahá’ís’ access to a
university education “[i]ntellectual cleansing of their ethnic

brothers by the clergy-dominated regime.”21 The economic
oppression of the Bahá’ís is yet another urgent problem.

A far more sinister purpose than the denial of higher education
is the “attempted genocide” of the entire Iranian Bahá’í community.
In its recent message to the Iranian Bahá’í community, the
Universal House of Justice (internationally elected governing
council for the Bahá’í world) characterized the post-1979
persecutions of Bahá’ís in Iran as “the calculated attempt at genocide
of these past 25 years.”22 How would non-Bahá’í observers evaluate
this statement in light of an international definition of “attempted
genocide”? In American common law, for instance, all “attempt”
crimes have the element of specific intent that the prosecution has
the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. That seems clear
enough on the part of the postrevolutionary regime. I am assuming,
of course, that the term “genocide” here refers to language found in
the secret 1991 memorandum by the Iranian Supreme
Revolutionary Cultural Council on “the Bahá’í question.” The
question of what constitutes attempted genocide consensed in
international law has already been addressed by the World
Federalist Organization’s Campaign to End Genocide:

The United Nations, Amnesty International, and other activist organizations
report on human right violations against Bahá’í. Annually, the UN
Commission on Human Rights includes them in its reports on Iran. Yet, if
[whether] the treatment of Iranian Bahá’í fits into the limited United Nations
definition of genocide might be questioned. Clearly, the attack on the group is
based on religious distinctions manipulated by the political elite. Although the
number of deaths has not reached the horrific levels of other cases of

genocide, Iran seeks to eliminate them as a group through murder and social
deprivation, thus meeting the UN Convention’s definition of genocide. 23

The question of “attempted genocide” aside, the reality seems to be
that secular events (which may be religiously inspired) have acted
and will continue to act to intervene in order to protect religions
from each other (intercommunal conflict) and even from
themselves (intracommunal conflict). Specifically, international law
has emerged as the most effective guarantor of religious freedom
and ultimately provides the only viable resolution to the Bahá’í
problem. But an Islamic resolution to the Bahá’í problem is
preferable, as Muslim communities would find a natural ally in
Bahá’ís as advocates against Islamophobia. If I may coin this
neologism, allow me to say that the current “Bahá’í-phobia” that
prevails in many Muslim Middle East countries feeds Islamophobia
in the West, and reducing the former will mollify the harsh
criticism that Islam is a tolerant religion in principle, but intolerant
in practice. But, with one or two recent exceptions, Muslim
intellectuals have not come forward in support of the rights of
Bahá’ís as an expression of an authentic Islamic regard for human
rights. According to Afshari, author of Human Rights in Iran: The
Abuse of Cultural Relativism:

The Shiite Muslims have a long way to go in accepting the right of Bahá’ís to
assert their claim to a universal religion that, in their belief, transcends Islam.
This blind spot in the Iranian consciousness, even among most iconoclastic
intellectuals, has been an unexamined aspect of modern Iranian society . . . .
Secular Iranian writers are almost legendary in expressing poetic solidarity
with all the oppressed peoples of the world. Sadly, they remained wordless,
during both the monarchy and the theocracy, on the Bahá’í sufferings.24

The Iranian regime has resisted accepting the fact that the Bahá’í
Faith is a religion. Under the current theocracy, Iranian President
Muhammad Khatami denied human rights violations at a press

conference in Paris on 29 October 1999 and dismissed such reports
as “the Bahá’í organization’s propaganda outside Iran.” Khatami’s
reference to the Bahá’í “organization” is instructive: He is careful to
avoid using the term “religion” in connection with the Bahá’ís. For
several years, the Islamic Republic of Iran had consistently
demanded that human rights representatives should stop referring
to Bahá’ís as a religious minority in Iran, insisting on this as a
precondition to cooperation with the UN.25 Afshari comments:

No savvy diplomat could have expected that the Commission on Human
Rights would ever deny Bahá’ís the status of a religious minority. In fact, this
issue has continued to be the real problem for the diplomats; their clerical
mentors had been blinded by their hatred of the Bahá’ís.26

Iran has been reluctant even to say that the Bahá’í Faith is a false
religion or its adherents are infidels. To acknowledge that the Bahá’í
Faith is a religion would be tantamount to an admission of the fact
that freedom of religion in Iran does not apply to all faith-
communities. Yet the secret Golpaygani document refers twice to
the “religious activities” of the Bahá’ís.27 If the Bahá’ís constitute the
largest religious minority in Iran, then their exclusion from the
Iranian constitution is perforce willful. Even the staunchest Iranian
critics of the regime have scarcely been able to utter the word
“Bahá’í” without fear of withering criticism or a blighted career.
One prominent example of this is Iranian human rights author and
2003 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, who totally ignores
the Bahá’ís as a minority religion in her monograph on human
rights in Iran.28 However, according to the Norwegian Nobel

Committee, “As for religious freedom, it should be noted that
Ebadi also includes the rights of members of the [B]ahai
community, which has had problems in Iran ever since its
foundation.”29 Notable here is the designation of the Bahá’ís as a
religious community, which the regime has strenuously rejected.
However, no independent documentation exists attesting to Ebadi’s
public advocacy of the rights of Iranian Bahá’ís. Among non-Iranian
writers, Iqbal Latif is one exception to this conspiracy of silence by
Muslim reformers and human rights advocates. In the 5 August
2002 issue of The Iranian, Latif states:

Bahais are an enigma in Iran! The Iranian regime, which doesn’t really give a
damn about their basic civil rights, flagrantly denies their existence by
collectively dismissing the 500,000 strong communities as a nameless forgotten
page of Iranian history. . . .

. . . Bahais claim that their supreme mission is none other but the
achievement of organic and spiritual unity of the whole body of nations was
and remains, in my opinion, one of the most groundbreaking ideas of the 19th
century. For such an inspiration to arise in the backward and medieval society
of Qajar Persia is astonishing. . . .

. . . One can remain detached from the rituals of the Bahai faith but
undoubtedly it is very thought-provoking and [a] roadmap of future global
constitution. . . .

. . . Iranians can be proud of the fact that such a global visionary as
Baha’u’llah was born in Tehran. He will be considered as one of the greatest
visionar[ies] of the 19th century and Iranians should definitely take pride in
that.30

Perhaps the only internal solution is for the Islamic world to
subordinate its Sunna-sourced precedents to clear principles
anchored in the Qur’an and Hadith with the aid of a rehabilitated
sense of reason and with a generous application of analogy until
precedent and principle are harmonized and aligned in favor of
universally recognized and egalitarian principles that would even

survive secular scrutiny. As the Bahá’ís have said for the past thirty
years, “Human rights are God-given rights.” This may be an
incipient theology of secularism. At any rate, the age-old Islamic
division of the World of Islam and the World of War must now be
replaced by something else. For these are new historic times.

But this is wishful thinking. According to Ghanea, official
constitutional recognition of the Bahá’ís may be too much to ask:
“Neither the Bahá’í International Community nor the Special
Representative of the human rights situation of Iran has asked for
the Bahá’ís of Iran to be recognized as one of the listed minorities in
the Iranian Constitution. This is of enormous consequence for Iran,
which may consider the primacy of Islam compromised by official
constitutional recognition of a post-Islamic religion.”31 Recognition
of the Iranian Bahá’í community as a religious minority has its own
limitations in international law, as Ghanea elsewhere observes:
“This leads us to a further political dimension: that of the lack of
agreed definitions for either ‘religion’ or ‘minority’ in human rights
law.”32 While Islamic sensitivities should be respected, they do not
outweigh human rights considerations. Strangely, sometimes secular
values can be more universal than religious ones. In a clash of
religious value systems, international law may be the only practical
arbiter until the conflict is resolved. Here, the conflict is one-sided,
as Bahá’ís are strong supporters of the freedom of religion. In
publicly saying, “Human rights are God-given rights,” the Bahá’ís
appear to be sacralizing the secular, whereas secular notions of
human rights probably had their genesis in religious values.

In the case of Iranian Islam, there is a considerable distance
between the constitutional rhetoric of respect for minority rights
and the prevailing sociopolitical reality. As a consequence of Iran’s
treatment of its Bahá’í minority, the ultimate injury-in-fact is
refractory damage to the reputation of Islam in the eyes of a critical
public that uncritically tends to see Islam as monolithic. By the
yardstick of minority rights, Iran’s efforts to preserve Islamic values

\[31\] Ghanea, 221.

have arguably had the effect of perverting them. The majority of
Muslims in Iran, however, have largely accepted the Bahá’ís, as the
latter have earned their respect. The irony is that a powerful
minority (the clerical hardliners) have infringed on the rights of
another minority, the Bahá’ís, while the reformers, with some
notable exceptions, have largely turned a blind eye to the Bahá’í
question.

One positive development is the fact that, in 1998, the Central
Bar Association in Iran had established a Legal Assistance
Department to provide legal advice and assistance to various groups,
including the Bahá’ís, in its effort to implement President Khatami’s
vision of a civil society.33 The 2003 Immigration and Nationality
Directorate’s report on Iran further states:

Over the past 2 years, the Government has taken some positive steps in
recognizing the rights of Bahá’ís, as well as other religious minorities. In
November 1999, President Khatami publicly stated that no one in the country
should be persecuted because of his or her religious beliefs. He added that he
would defend the civil rights of all citizens, regardless of their beliefs or
religion. Subsequently the Expediency Council approved the “Right of
Citizenship” bill, affirming the social and political rights of all citizens and
their equality before the law. In February 2000, following approval of the bill,
the head of the judiciary issued a circular letter to all registry offices
throughout the country, which permits any couple to be registered as
husband and wife without being required to state their religious affiliation.
This measure effectively permits the registration of Bahá’í marriages in the
country. Previously Bahá’í marriages were not recognized by the
Government, leaving Bahá’í women open to charges of prostitution.
Consequently children of Bahá’í marriages were not recognized as legitimate
and therefore were denied inheritance rights.34

But the report corroborates the continuing denial of access of
Bahá’ís to universities: “They are, however, still not allowed to
enroll in Universities, where the form has four boxes for different

religions, none of which is Bahá’í.”35 The policy reason is clear: “In
September 2001, the Ministry of Justice issued a report that
reiterated that government policy continued to aim at the eventual
elimination of the Bahá’ís as a community.”36 Further exacerbating
the situation is a series of articles against the Faith that are
appearing in Jam-i Jam, the official newspaper of the hardline
clerics. So far, three articles have been published, combining old and
new accusations together with fanciful stories based on
nonhistorical fictions.37 Counterbalancing such attacks are Iranians
of conscience who defend the rights of Bahá’ís. The European
Council has recently stated:

The Council is moreover concerned at continued violations of the right to
freedom of religion, particularly in relation to Bahá’ís, whose faith is not
recognised by the Constitution and who face serious discrimination
particularly in relation to education, property rights and employment. 38

Current thinking in Iran reveals a bifurcation of the hardline and
reformist clerics. Such notables as Abdolkarim Soroush, Mohsen
Kadivar, Abdollah Nouri, Akbar Ganji, and Mashallah
Shamsolvaezin are among the most outspoken of reformers, and
some of them have discussed the plight of the Bahá’ís of Iran.

president of the Iranian Association in Support of Freedom of the
Press. In one interview, Kadivar said:

their religion or beliefs, people should have basic human rights—no one

Notwithstanding, Kadivar later went on to say:

In the United States, I was asked which Islamic country I thought most
democratic. I answered, Iran. Despite being jailed during this regime, I still
believe that Iran is the most democratic country in the Islamic world and in
the Middle East.40

The perspective of a Bahá’í whose life has directly felt the effects of
Iranian repression, however, can be quite different. Recently, I
conducted an interview with a Bahá’í informant from Iran, who
will remain unnamed as a security measure. The informant’s
answers to the ten questions asked are given below in quotation
marks:

1. How can you best describe the plight of the Bahá’ís in Iran
today? “A community which was under harsh, sudden attacks for
the first 7–8 years and under more steady silent pressure, with
worse effects (compared to what happened in the earlier years),
from 17 years ago till the present time.”

2. What has improved? What has remained the same? What has
become worse? “Improvement: In the past 5–6 years passports have
been issued for Bahá’ís. Before that, for that [purpose] it was
impossible for a Bahá’í to get a passport when he applied for one
(especially in the second year of the Revolution till 18–19 years
later). Very few passports were issued for Bahai applicant[s] during
that time. Remained the same: No governmental employment, no
permission to get into the universities, no recognition of other
social rights of Bahá’ís. Got worse: The mere passage of time under
this situation makes everything worse. Deprivation from higher
education and from active presence in universities is a sad thing that

\[40\] Ibid.

gets worse and worse as [the] newer generation join[s] the older
ones in this deprivation.”

3. Since Iran still bans Bahá’ís from access to a university
education, please describe the two universities that Bahá’ís have
established. “Bahai Open University: Was established some 17 years
ago with the help of Bahá’í university professors who were
dismissed from the universities. There are different fields in this
university:     engineering    (civil,   computer),       mathematics,
pharmacology, languages (English, Arabic, Persian), psychology,
sociology, law, etc. Interestingly, some of the graduates of this
university have been accepted to Carleton University in Canada for
their graduate studies. Institute for Advanced Bahai Studies:
Established some seventeen years ago. A BA-level academic
curriculum was developed. Half of the courses dealt with the Bahá’í
Writings and the other half with subject[s] such as: Arabic language,
Persian literature, English language, psychology, sociology, history,
philosophy, logic, etc. Students are expected to write a thesis upon
completion of their courses. Already one thousand people have
been graduated from this Institute and one thousand are currently
studying there.”

4. Has Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi promised to help
the Bahá’ís? If so, where does she state this? “As we have already
discussed, I do not know. Nobody seems to have seen the
document.”

5. Have any other Iranian intellectuals or leaders recently spoken
out in support of the human rights of the beleaguered Iranian Bahá’í
community? “Yes, someone named Tavakkoli41 did so in an article
published in Iran Nameh, number 1-2, Winter 1379 and Spring
1380\. In fact I think you will find this issue of Iran Nameh very

State University. Tavakkoli has presented at least two conference papers on the
current plight of the Iranian Bahá’ís: “Islamism and Counter-Bahá’ísm” (Society for
Shaykhi, Babi and Bahai Studies panel discussion, Annual Meeting of the Middle East
Studies Association, 16 November 2000) and, “Oneself as Another: Iranian
Subjectivity and the De/recognition of Bahá’ís” (Society for Iranian Studies, Annual
Meeting of Middle East Studies Association, Washington, DC, 21 November 1999).

interesting and important to this question.42 ‘Bahá’í sitizi va
Islamgarayi dar Iran’ [Anti-Bahaism and Islamism in Iran, 1941-
1955].43

6. What is the most urgent need of the Iranian Bahá’í community
at present? “In my understanding, the most urgent need of the
Iranian Bahá’í community is for the youth to have access to higher
education in the regular official universities. (I need to emphasize
again that this is my very personal judgment. Other friends might
think totally different[ly].)”

7. What can the international community do now to assist? “(1)
To bring into more and more attention of the people of the world,
especially those in decision-making positions, the deprivations
Iranian Bahá’ís are tolerating. (2) To assist the present institutes of
higher education established within the Bahá’í community of Iran.”

8. How can scholars best use their influence to educate the public
and generate support for the Bahá’ís in Iran? “This is my favorite
question to answer. I think, in fact, I have posed my answer to this
in my answer to the above question. Scholars can do a lot through
using the channels available to them (personal contacts with other
academics, writing articles, doing interviews, etc.) to let the world,
especially the academics, know that the Bahá’í[s] of Iran have been
denied higher education for the past 22–23 years.”

9. How can the American Bahá’ís best assist the Iranian Bahá’í
community? “I believe the best way to assist would be through
academic endeavors. Bahá’í professors can help the Institute for
Advanced Bahai Studies design courses. They can graciously teach
the students in Iran through programs for distant e-learning. If in
higher academic standings, they can help graduates from the
Institute for Advanced Bahá’í Studies or the Bahá’í Open
University to be accepted for the graduate studies in their
departments, etc.”

2:79–124. Iran Nameh is published by the Foundation for Iranian Studies (Bethesda,
MD).

10. Finally, does the Iranian Bahá’í community have a “message”
to send out to the international community? “I am surely not in a
position to convey the message of the Iranian Bahá’ís to their fellow
believers all over the world. However, I can imagine such a message
would be: Through the guidance from the [Bahá’í] Writings, and
the UHJ [Universal House of Justice], we know why all the
experience of the past 25 years happened and we are doing our best
to get the message Baha’u’llah is sending us through these events,
and we would love to see the success of our sisters and brothers
outside Iran in propagating the message of Baha’u’llah, in their
building of the foundation of World Unity, and in their scientific
and social progress. The more you achieve the happier and the
more confident we are.”44

This interview with a Bahá’í correspondent in Iran is published
here for the first time. It reflects an honest and fair appraisal of the
current situation and largely authenticates and updates the
information presented in this paper. As the respondent is careful to
qualify, this interview is entirely informal and does not represent
the official position of any Bahá’í agency. The interview itself may
be circumscribed, lacking a more comprehensive view of the
current situation in which Iranian Bahá’ís are plighted. For
instance, the interviewee may have emphasized the difficulties that
Bahá’í youth are experiencing in getting a higher education—as a
new generation of the oppressed—to the relative diminution of
what are arguably more urgent matters facing the Iranian Bahá’í
community at large. Notwithstanding, the Universal House of
Justice, on 26 November 2003, recognized the Iranian Bahá’í
community’s resourcefulness in establishing the Bahá’í Open
University and the Institute for Advanced Bahá’í Studies by saying:

Graduates of the institution you founded to meet the needs of university
students, who are similarly denied education, are today distinguishing
themselves in prestigious universities in other countries where their
credentials have been gladly accepted. God willing, the day is not far distant

\[44\] Personal communication by e-mail, 21 December 2003.

when opportunities for the development of their capacities will be opened for
the thousands of other Bahá’í youth still cruelly deprived. 45

Thus, the “Bahá’í question” has confronted the Islamic world
(widely, but not entirely) with a test case by which Islam’s claims to
religious tolerance will be vindicated, compromised, or reformed.
The recent “Declaration of Iranian Cultural and Political Activists
Regarding Ways to Assist National Resistance Against Foreign
Threats,” posted on 19 May 2003,46 reflects the widespread
discontent of Iranian intellectuals over the state of affairs in Iran, of
which the Bahá’í question is symptomatic. As Afshari notes:
“Experience shows that the mixing of Islam and the modern state
has trapped its citizens in concentric, hermeneutic mazes.”47
Practically speaking, it will probably be the force of international
law that ultimately constrains the application of Islamic restrictions
on Bahá’ís, as has partially happened in Iran. Whether it is possible
for an Islamic state to grant full rights to a religion that it
fundamentally opposes and, thus, has the greatest difficulty in
tolerating, the Bahá’í question invites further discussion in the
context of Islam and minorities.
