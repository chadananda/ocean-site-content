“Progressive Revelation”: The Application of
Principles and Insights from the History of Science1

Jena Khadem Khodadad

The intent of this paper is to explore and discuss the Bahá’í
“paradigm” on unity of religions, that is the fundamental
Bahá’í principle of Progressive Revelation, in the context of the
thesis proposed by Thomas Kuhn, in his classical work, The
Structure of Scientific Revolution. 2,3,4 This paper is organized
in two parts:
I.   Discussion of the process of advancement of scientific

> knowledge through stages which according to Kuhn
> bring about a change in paradigm; this will employ an

Introduction

Thomas Kuhn, an eminent philosopher of science, was the
first to introduce the term “paradigm”. Paradigm comes from
the Greek word, “paradigmia” which means pattern. Paradigm
signifies our worldview; how we believe knowledge or systems
work. The Oxford English Dictionary defines paradigm as “a
pattern or model, an exemplar”. The word “paradigm” as used
in this paper in respect to the Bahá’í principle of Progressive
Revelation, denotes “the religious worldview” on unity of
religions. The term “paradigm” has over time acquired various
connotations and in some instances its application has become
trivialized. However, the concept of paradigm as used by Kuhn
is replete with significant insights. My intent is to apply the

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                     44

concept of “paradigm” in this paper with the depth imparted
to it by Thomas Kuhn.

Kuhn in The Structure of Scientific Revolution discusses the
role of paradigms in advancement of scientific research and
knowledge. This book is considered as one of the most
significant books on the philosophy of science since it was
first published in 1962, and subsequently in 1964 and 1970. The
Structure of Scientific Revolution has been widely read (it has
sold over a million copies) and has influenced scholars from
numerous disciplines. It has generated much discussion and
debate, and won praise as well elicited criticism. Some have
hailed it as “monumental” while others have critiqued and
rejected its central thesis. This book has thus stimulated
extensive discourse leading to numerous other publications.
These have, in turn, contributed to increased understanding in
respective fields. This is indeed the hallmark of any significant
publication. The terms “seminal” and “monumental” rightly
apply to Kuhn’s work regardless of how one may view any of its
possible shortcomings. Kuhn’s contributions, in particular in
respect to the thesis of this paper, warrant in-depth
consideration and reflection. Such reflections are bound to
provide learning and insights heightening one’s understanding
and appreciation of the Bahá’í paradigm of unity of religions.

Kuhn’s central thesis is that advances in scientific
knowledge are essentially revolutionary. He believes that
scientific research consists of long periods of “normal science”
interrupted by a radical shift in paradigm whereby one
paradigm is supplanted by a mutually exclusive one. This is
tantamount to a revolution as it involves the overthrow of an
old paradigm, an old regime, and its replacement with the new.
The thesis of Kuhn has stimulated dialogues and in-depth
discussions on whether advancements in scientific knowledge
follows the revolutionary path or whether it is a process which
is cumulative and hence evolutionary. A revolutionary process
entails a “paradigm shift” whereby the paradigm undergoes a
radical change. An evolutionary process entails “paradigm
expansion” whereby the paradigm undergoes expansion through
gradual accretion of knowledge. Kuhn’s enthusiastic
supporters are numerous; among them is Howard Margolis5
who draws a relationship between a Kuhnian paradigm shift
and a shift in well entrenched “habits of the mind”.

Many of those who have critiqued Kuhn’s view hold that
advancement in scientific knowledge is cumulative and hence

Bahá’í Worldview on Unity of Religions                         45

evolutionary. Stephen Toulmin6 argues against Kuhn’s thesis
that advancement in science is revolutionary and holds that the
process is in fact evolutionary. According to Toumlin’s
understanding of Kuhn, the revolutionary process implies that
there is competition between paradigms which are mutually
exclusive; thus with paradigm shift one paradigm replaces the
other. Whereas the evolutionary process implies a cumulative
process in conceptual change. Kafatos and Nadeau7 also argue
that the process of advancement in science is cumulative and
evolutionary. Hoyningen-Huene8 provides insightful critique
and interpretation of certain points regarding the thesis
presented by Kuhn. In a later publication, Kuhn 9,
acknowledges the cumulative and evolutionary process in the
advance of science. Additionally, Kuhn also acknowledges in
his foreword to the writing of Hoynngen-Huene10 some of this
criticism. Notwithstanding such arguments, the work of Kuhn
in The Structure of Scientific Revolution is significant as it
provides valuable insights in the progression and advancement
of knowledge.

The question of whether the process of advancement of
science is evolutionary or revolutionary will not have a critical
bearing on the discussions presented in this paper. In fact, it is
likely that advances in knowledge have both characteristics;
that is an evolutionary process with features which may exhibit
revolutionary characteristics. Such a process may apply to the
advances in science in certain fields and under certain
conditions as well as to the Bahá’í paradigm of unity of
religions known as the principle of “Progressive Revelation”.
Inherent within the principle of Progressive Revelation is a
cumulative process and hence it is essentially an evolutionary
process; nevertheless, certain factors impart to it also a
revolutionary character. Thus the paradigm of Progressive
Revelation is an evolutionary process with revolutionary
features to which “paradigm shift” as well as “paradigm
expansion” can apply. This matter will be taken up in the
ensuing parts of this paper. The analysis and discussions of
Kuhn are insightful and are in particular applicable to the
thesis of this paper.

I. Advancement of Scientific Knowledge through
Paradigms

Kuhn provides several examples from the history of science
in order to explain and elucidate his thesis on “shift” in a

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                      46

scientific paradigm. Among these, the example of “Copernican
Revolution”, is appropriate and applicable to the thesis and
discussions which will be presented in this paper. The
Copernican Revolution was a tumultuous process which
precipitated the overthrow of the geocentric model of universe
and its replacement with a heliocentric model.
The Essential Stages of a Paradigm Shift

Kuhn identifies and describes several stages which, in
general, take place when a paradigm shift, whereby a new
paradigm replaces the established one.

He first emphasizes that paradigms are essential. Paradigms
are created based on the known scientific achievements in a
specific scientific community; they attempt to explain the
findings, on which there is, in general, agreement among the
scientists in a respective field. Paradigms are essential to
scientific inquiry. They play a significant role in helping the
scientists generate and formulate questions thus stimulating
further inquiries and research. These lead to continuing
scientific advancement and expansion in learning. Thus
paradigms set in motion a dynamic process leading to
escalating levels of research and expansion in knowledge.

The established paradigm generates questions and inquiries.

Such inquiries lead to new observations and data. Accumulated
data, in time, can result in what Kuhn calls “anomalies”;
anomalies are puzzles. The emerging data can no longer fit into
the pattern of thinking embodied in the established paradigm;
thus they generate puzzles. Puzzles persist as they can no longer
be explained in the context of the current paradigm. In time,
anomalous observations, mount resulting in what Kuhn calls, a
“crisis situation”. Kuhn emphasizes that the crisis itself must
be of such magnitude as to produce tension in the system
preparing it for a shift in paradigm. Ultimately, further
investigations into new findings, bring about or may even
force a paradigm shift. Thus the process becomes revolutionary
as the new emergent paradigm replaces the old established one.
It is a change in regime, a coup d’état. The new paradigm
necessitates a reconstruction of the original facts and
assumptions.

However, such a paradigm shift is not a smooth transition
as the emergent new paradigm faces opposition and resistance.
The resistance comes from those in the scientific community

Bahá’í Worldview on Unity of Religions                        47

who are committed to the old paradigm. There are desperate
efforts to hold on to the established paradigm by attempting to
modify and articulate it differently. Additionally, significant
challenges are posed by the new paradigm; as what is now
required is a retooling, a new language, new methodologies and
a whole new mindset. These challenges, when met, can induce
significant advancement in scientific knowledge.

Kuhn goes on to emphasize that the acceptance and
adoption of the new paradigm requires the rejection of the
older established one. When the new paradigm is adopted and
assimilated it is then that in the context of the new paradigm,
the scientists acquire a new way of looking at data, a whole new
worldview. Those observations and findings which seemed
anomalous can now be explained; puzzles are solved. Even the
old data take on their expanded and true meaning.
The Copernican Revolution

The “Copernican Revolution” is, in particular, a suitable
example for the application of the stages described by Kuhn in
process of a paradigm shift. Furthermore, it is also cogent to
the discussion of the Bahá’í paradigm of Progressive Revelation
(to be covered in the second part of this paper).

The Copernican Revolution illustrates the implications of
various stages, described by Kuhn, which lead to a shift in the
established geocentric paradigm of universe. The Ptolemic
paradigm of the universe had long ceased to make sense. It was
based on a pattern of thinking which had created dilemmas and
inconsistencies; the literal understanding of certain biblical
verses on Creation and the Christian doctrine of salvation
posed barriers which seemed impenetrable.

The understanding of cosmos has been a quest ever since the
emergence of man on planet earth. There has always been an
urge to explain the mystery of creation, in a comprehensible
manner in accordance with the state of knowledge of the time.
Explanation of the creation of universe was fundamental to
Greeks and Romans as well as to many religions. The Judeo
Christian view is that the universe had a distinct beginning in a
not very distant time in the past. According to the literal
statements in the Old Testament, the creation of the universe
took place in seven days. St. Augustine, accepted the date of
approximately 5000 B.C. as the date of creation of universe;
this he based on his understanding of the verses in the Book of

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                     48

Genesis. He argued that time is a property of universe that God
created, thus time could not have existed before the beginning
of universe.
The Geocentric Paradigm of the Universe

Aristotle in 340 B.C. argued the sphericity of earth. He
believed that the Earth was stationary and that the sun, the
moon and the stars orbited around it in circles. This idea was
further elaborated by Ptolemy, the Greek astronomer in 140
A.D. into a complete cosmological model. He formulated the
old paradigm of Earth at the center of universe with moon,
sun, and planets revolving around it in circular orbits. This
was based on Plato’s view that the perfect form of motion was
the circular one. Earth was then at the center surrounded by
eight spheres that carried the moon, the sun, the stars and the
five known planets. The outermost sphere carried the fixed
stars. What lay beyond was not made clear as it was not
thought to be part of observable universe.

Ptolemy’s paradigm was conveniently supported, promoted
and adopted by the Christian church as the picture of universe
that was in accordance with the Scriptures. It reinforced and
was in line with the literal understanding of the Bible. Such a
model reinforced religious sentiments and was compatible with
the Christian doctrine of salvation through Jesus Christ for the
significant planet Earth, with its unique position of centrality
in the entire cosmos; for around it revolved all other heavenly
bodies including the Sun itself. The Ptolemic paradigm of
universe also provided a model for the placement of heaven. The
moon at one time had been considered the residence of the
souls of those who had passed away and are there waiting to
return for rebirth. Dante’s Divine Comedy was based on such a
model of universe.

It is of interest and puzzling that even the learned of Islam
seemed to believe in the Ptolemic theory of universe although
certain verses in the Qur’an pointed to the contrary11 . One of
these verses12 states, “The sun moves in a fixed place,” This
clearly indicates that the sun is fixed and moves around an
axis.

Another Quranic verse13 states, “And each star moves in its
own heaven.”

The Paradigm Shift to Heliocentric Universe

The early Church found the cosmology of Aristotle and
Ptolemy convenient. No conflict arose as long as the language
of science was not in significant variance with their beliefs.
However, conflicts emerged in time. Anomalies surfaced and
accumulated. Increasing new observations and data were
presented by notable scientists such as Giordano Bruno, Tycho
Brahe, Johannes Kepler, Galileo, and others. These posed
puzzles which could not fit into the context of the Ptolemic
model of universe. Data presented by Copernicus in the
sixteenth century showed that the sun is the center of the
universe. In time, such mounting anomalies precipitated what
is known as the “Copernican Revolution”. The story of Genesis
no longer seemed to make sense.

The resistance to the new heliocentric model of universe was
vehement. Even when the model explained the new findings it
was still not accepted by the establishment. When Galileo
gathered evidence in support of the new model of universe with
the invention of telescope, he was denounced by the professors
in the university. He went before the Inquisition and was
forced to “abjure, curse and detest” these absurd ideas.
Giordono Bruno was burnt as a heretic in 1600 A.D., because
among other things, he taught that the earth revolved around
the sun.

The resistance to the new model of universe was such that
desperate attempts were made to retain the geocentric model of
universe. Although observations had shown that movement of
planets were not in smooth circles, they tried to address the
new data by introducing into the established paradigm absurd
accommodations, such as inclusion of epicircles into the
orbits of movement of planets. Such attempts at retaining the
geocentric model of universe persisted for centuries.

Mounting anomalies and inconsistencies finally forced the
paradigm to shift. The Ptolemic paradigm of a geocentric
universe was replaced by the Copernican paradigm of a
heliocentric universe. The process was tumultuous; similar to a
revolution, it resulted in overthrow of the regime of the
established paradigm. The adoption and assimilation of the
paradigm of heliocentric universe imparted an expanded
worldview. The new data now fit into the structure of the new
paradigm. The old data also fit! The old data and facts
remained unchanged; however, they took on their true

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                       50

placement and expanded meaning in the context of the new
paradigm. The new paradigm served to stimulate further
observations and findings.
Learning and Insights from the Copernican Revolution

The Copernican Revolution provides important learning
and insights. An extensive discussion of these insights are
beyond the scope of this paper. However few points warrant
special emphasis.

The process of advancement in the knowledge of universe
through the Copernican Revolution followed an apparent
revolutionary path; this can be attributed, to a large extent, to
the barriers which were posed by religious dogmas. It is
reasonable to think that the paradigm shift which took place with
the Copernican Revolution, would have expanded the mindset to
the true meaning and implication of the scriptures. Are they to
be taken in a literal sense? Galileo, in his letter of 1615, to the
Grand Duchess, Christine, argued that Biblical writers had
neither intended nor wanted to convey scientific information
about the natural universe. Opening up of the mindset to the
inherent meaning of the scriptures must surely have relevance to
the paradigm of unity or religions.

Additionally, the advancement in the knowledge of cosmos,
also had an evolutionary feature as it was the result of
accretion of findings. The revolutionary part of this process
was unusually lengthy. It was not until Sir Isaac Newton in 1687,
published his basic laws of gravity in his book, Principia, that
the new model was accepted and the shift of paradigm was finally
completed. The stages described and analyzed by Kuhn provide
insights on the underlying factors which constituted barriers
to the acceptance of the new paradigm. However, once that
resistance was overcome and the paradigm was adopted and
assimilated, the process took on an evolutionary course. It
paved the way to new areas of research. Consequently, it has
taken us beyond the heliocentric universe to a universe of
superclusters of galaxies in a vast universe among many
universes. It has opened vistas of discoveries, and undreamt of
new possibilities. Opening up of new horizons regarding the
universe must surely have its counterpart in the universe of
religions.

II. Advancement of Religious Knowledge through
Paradigm of Unity of Religions (Progressive
Revelation)

The thesis of Kuhn has been widely employed in fields
outside the natural sciences. It is of particular value to apply
his analysis to the field of religion. Science and religion are two
dimensions of reality. The findings of science, whose domain is
the world of matter, are not absolute but relative and
progressive. The revelation of religious truth, whose domain is
the world of spirit, is also relative; it has infinite scope in its
essence but its revelation is progressive. It is important to note
that the process of advancement of scientific knowledge relates
to the physical reality and its manifestation in the phenomenal
world; whereas the process of advancement in the revelation of
divine truth is related to the divine reality and its manifestation
is through the divine educators. The former is investigated by
scientists and the latter is revelation emanating from the
ultimate reality, God. Both science and religion, however, are
facets of reality.

The profound insights derived from the Copernican
revolution, and the essential stages entailed in that process can
be applied to the Bahá’í worldview of unity of religions
(principle of Progressive Revelation). Kuhn’s thesis provides
novel insights regarding the nature of the challenges and the
opposition associated with various stages of a paradigm shift.
Thus the Copernican Revolution serves as an example for
discussion of the Bahá’í paradigm of Progressive Revelation.
There are similarities between the two processes in respect to: the
stages involved in paradigm shift or paradigm expansion; the
insights they both hold; and that both are affected by the
implications of religious dogmas.
The Progressive Revelation

The worldview (paradigm) prevalent among the followers of
religions is that their respective religion has exclusive hold on
God’s absolute truth and that all others are bereft of that
knowledge. Furthermore, they hold the conviction that their
religion provides the only path to salvation and that all others
are bereft of it. These beliefs are based on the limited and literal
understandings of the respective scriptures.

Such a limited paradigm of religious truth adopted by a
particular religion may have been more acceptable at a time in
the course of history of humankind when people were
geographically isolated from one another. Under such
conditions this paradigm may have served its adherents as it
induced inspiration, focus, and was relevant to their
particular needs.
Rising Anomalies and Puzzles

However, with the passage of time the world has emerged out
of isolation. Increasing possibilities and opportunities of this
global age have generated anomalies and puzzles; these can no
longer be addressed by any paradigm which is limited and does
not have answers to the challenges of a world on the verge of a
planetary civilization. Increasing interaction among people,
cultures and religions generate their own set of puzzles. These
have accumulated posing conflicts which can not be resolved
by the prevailing paradigm of exclusivity of truth held by one
religion.

Technological     advances     have    resulted    in    rapid
transportation, communication and mass immigrations. As a
consequence, people of diverse ethnicities, cultures and
religious backgrounds have been brought into close proximity.
Significant inter-religious exposures have been possible in this
global age. We have the opportunity to associate with and
establish friendships with those from the Buddhist, Hindu,
Moslem, Jewish, and Zoroastrian backgrounds. Thus we have
become increasingly aware of other religions; of the nobility
and truths inherent in their teachings, of the transformation in
character such truths can induce and generate in their
followers. The awareness of other religions can inspire study of
their respective scriptures. Previously, if one studied religions
other than one’s own, it would have been most likely through an
occasional course on comparative religions. Such studies often
compared religions in reference to, for example, Christianity.

There are questions that now arise. For example, “How does
one reconcile in the context of the paradigm of exclusivity of
salvation, the mystical sentiments of numerous twentieth
century physicists with the beautiful spiritual writings of the
Buddhists? Such were the probing questions which were raised
by the participants of the Second Parliament of World
Religions in Chicago in 1993. Several of the major presenters in
that Conference were struggling with such anomalies and

puzzles when placed in the confines of an old paradigm of
exclusivity. It was impossible to participate in those sessions
and not pose and reflect on numerous such questions. The
paradigm of exclusivity of Truth and salvation was workable at
a time and in a world characterized by geographical isolation.
However, no longer. No paradigm which claims to hold
absolute religious truth and exclusive salvation can
accommodate the puzzling observations and needs of our
times. Surely, the followers of other religions must also have a
grasp of the truth. Their sacred texts are uplifting and also
inculcate nobility of character. We can rightly ask, whether
their scriptures also emanate from the divine source? Are they
deprived of salvation? Here, we are faced with major puzzles.

Those of us who have hitherto held the belief that one religion
holds the exclusive truth and the only route to salvation, are
faced with such mounting questions and must consider
whether we can provide a satisfying solution. This poses a
major dilemma. How can we uphold the prevailing paradigm of
religious truth centered around one religion as the exclusive
possessor of Truth and salvation? Is this paradigm of
exclusivity meaningful and workable? Such observations and
questions pose challenges to church instituted doctrines.

On one hand any attempt to fit these anomalies into the
limited paradigm of exclusivity of salvation introduces yet
greater complexity. On the other hand, viewing these in the
context of Bahá’í paradigm of unity of religions provides
viable and refreshing solutions to the puzzles.

Another anomalous observation of our particular times
arises from the expanded knowledge of our universe; a universe
encompassing countless superclusters of galaxies, each
harboring numerous galaxies and each galaxy in turn with
numerous solar systems with their own planets. This raises the
inevitable question: Are there other solar systems with planets
like our planet which are capable of harboring intelligent life?
Are these intelligent beings also engraven with the image of
God? Is salvation also open to them? Such questions can
inevitably take us once again to the doctrine of exclusivity of
salvation. Any limited paradigm which applies only to our
planet has major inconsistencies.

Crisis situation

Such mounting anomalies have reached a point which Kuhn
describes, a “crisis situation”; the crisis confronts and poses
challenge to the prevailing paradigm of exclusivity of truth and
salvation. How can these be accommodated in the context of a
paradigm which may have worked well when cultures and
religions were geographically isolated and the knowledge of
universe was limited? How can we explain these findings and
observations in an increasingly interdependent world? In order
to flourish spiritually as well as materially in a multi-religious
world community we are compelled to expand our paradigm
and with it transform our worldview.
The Bahá’í Paradigm of Unity of Religions

The Bahá’í paradigm of Progressive Revelation is a dynamic
and viable substitute paradigm; it provides a major expansion
in one’s worldview of religions. The paradigm of unity of
religions as presented by the Bahá’í Faith, affirms that divine
truth is absolute and that its revelation over time through the
Manifestations of God (divine educators) is relative and
progressive. God’s knowledge has been revealed over time
progressively through Krishna, Zoroaster, Buddha, Moses,
Jesus, Muhammad, the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. All of these great
religions are from the same source; they are interrelated and
their missions are interconnected. They all encompass the same
essence, a common core which runs through all of them. These
Divine Educators bring inspiration for the regeneration of the
individual and society; and provide solutions for the urgent
needs of the time. All of the great religions of the world come
together at this point in the course of human history when the
planet has become one interdependent entity; thus the needs
and requirements of all now merge into one. This requires the
new and expanded paradigm of a common Faith which can
acknowledge and accept the validity of all the religions of the
world. The Bahá’í paradigm of Progressive Revelation provides
a dynamic worldview. Its specific mission is to inspire the
transformation of humankind and guide it toward the
realization of oneness of the human race and a planetary
civilization.

Presentation of Progressive Revelation through the Use of
Diagrams

Here, I would like to explain certain key features of the
Bahá’í principle of Progressive Revelation through the use of
several diagrams (see end of article). It is my hope to convey my
understanding of certain of its important concepts.
Nevertheless, I have an acute awareness that such mode of
presentation has its own inherent limitations and that no
diagrammatic representation can adequately convey a spiritual
principle which is at once mystical, multidimensional,
profound and dynamic. However, the responses to my use of
such diagrams in various settings have been encouraging. Thus,
one can only surmise, based on the level of response and the
ensuing discussions, that this mode of presentation through
use of diagrams can be of value in serving to elucidate, albeit in
a limited way, certain aspects of the Bahá’í paradigm of
Progressive Revelation. More importantly, such diagrams have
served as springboards in stimulating further discussions and
critique leading in turn to expanded understanding of such a
dynamic paradigm. In this process, I have personally reaped the
results and remain its greatest beneficiary.

Figure 1 (at end), is a diagrammatic representation of the
Bahá’í paradigm of Progressive Revelation showing continuing
progression in disclosure of divine truth over time. The circles
(seen in this figure as ovals) represent revelation through
successive dispensations brought by the divine educators:
Krishna, Buddha, Zoroaster, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, and
the Twin Manifestations, the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. These
religions all include the same core of truth, represented in this
diagram by the symbol of the radiant sun. That core relates to a
divine reality which is infinite. The Bahá’í principle of
Progressive Revelation upholds that the disclosure of divine
truth through the divine educators over time is in proportion
and in response to the requirements of time (as well as place).

Figure 2, is a diagrammatic representation of the Bahá’í
paradigm of Progressive Revelation. This diagram is similar to
the previous figure; however it is a rendition which draws
attention to the essential connection between the divine
dispensations. Thus it underscores the interconnection and
linkages among religions. The revelation of God’s Truth
through divine educators continues on into the future.
Bahá’u’lláh has made it very clear that His revelation is not
final and that it will be continued through future

dispensations. The dashed curved line in this diagram
represents this important key point. Thus the Bahá’í paradigm
of Progressive Revelation addresses a major problem which has
caused so much contention and animosity in the past. This has
been a misunderstanding due to the perceived exclusivity of
salvation in the Church instituted doctrine of salvation and
the finality of the revelation to Muhammad in Islam. These
have been major barriers leading to fundamentalism,
fanaticism, persecutions and brutality in the name of religion.

Figure 3, is a diagrammatic representation of the Bahá’í
paradigm of Progressive Revelation. This diagram is similar to
Figure 1. It focuses on the common features of religions. This
diagram attempts to call attention to the need for a different
perspective, a different point of view in looking at religions.
Please note that the rotation of the successive circles
(representing dispensations/religions) at a 450 angle around the
axis of their common core (represented by the sun) gives us the
figure inserted in the upper right corner. This inserted figure
represents a view of religions showing them as concentric
circles, surrounding a common core at their very center; the
core is represented by the sun. This common core is their divine
center. We can obtain the perspective represented by the
inserted figure, only when we refine our point of view; that is if
we look directly on, focused on that inner essence, through the
core (similar to the rotation of 450 degree angle, as indicated
above). This can serve as an effective metaphor for the use of
perspective when viewing religions; that is to look directly with
undeviating focus on the core. It is then that we begin to see
that all of these great religions are in essence, one. They are all
from the same divine source and they surround the same
reality.

Figure 4, is a diagrammatic representation of the Unified
Paradigm of Religions. This figure is an enlargement of the
insert in figure 3, which was obtained by rotation of the figure
at 450 angle around the axis of its central core. This diagram
underscores the common features shared by all religions,
specifically in two respects: a). The concentric circles all
encompass the same radiant common core of the infinite
reality (represented by the sun); this was discussed in the
context of the previous figure b). The common areas (the
overlaps) shared by religions. They share common areas
(overlaps) but also include additional portions. The additional
portions are in response to the needs and challenges of
respective times; the mission of religion is to inspire the

regeneration of the individual and the society as well as to
provide solutions to the challenges and urgent needs of the
time. This paradigm emphasizes the cumulative and hence the
evolutionary aspect of this process. The revelation of the divine
truth which is imparted through religions is progressive. The
Bahá’í paradigm of continuing Progressive Revelation provides
a whole new way of looking at the diversity of religions. It
imbues one with a new worldview.

The core inherent in all of the religions of the world is like
that radiant inner reality depicted in figures 1 through 4. The
core includes, such divine truths as belief in God, the soul of
man, the immortality of the soul, the kingdoms of God, as well
as some other beliefs. The core beliefs are also revealed to man
over time progressively in greater and greater measure (see
Figures 1 and 3). For example, Bahá’u’lláh has revealed writings
about realities such as God, the soul, the stages of the journey
of the soul, the immortality of the soul, the spiritual worlds of
God, and other truths in a significantly larger proportion than
that which had been imparted through the past revelations.
Thus the disclosure of divine knowledge regarding the core
truths also increases progressively with each successive
Revelation.

Additionally, this figure calls our attention to the
continuation of Revelation into the future. The outward
directed arrows in figure 4, emphasize that revelation through
the divine educators will continue on into the future, after the
dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh,. Thus according to the worldview
of unity of religions presented by Bahá’u’lláh, there can never
be a claim to finality in revelation. God’s truth is infinite and
cannot be given in totality through any one dispensation.
Further, the needs and challenges of an ever developing and
changing world require continuation of divine guidance.

Figure 5, is a diagrammatic representation of Progressive
Revelation over time and space through the major religions of
the world. The Hindu, and Buddhist religions are shown,
separate in space from Zoroastrian, Jewish, Christian,
Moslem, the Bábí and Bahá’í religions.

The Hindu and Buddhist Faiths appeared in a part of the
world which was geographically isolated from that part of the
world from which arose the Zoroastrian, the Jewish, the
Christian, the Moslem, the Bábí and the Bahá’í Faiths. However,
at this juncture in history of humankind when the planet has

become one entity through the advances in science and
technology, all of these religion now come together in one
common Faith. Note the line connecting the Hindu and
Buddhist religions to the Bábí and Bahá’í Faith. The specific
mission of the Bahá’í Faith is to address the urgent needs of
humankind at a time when geographical isolation no longer
poses a hindrance. Our world is on the verge of globalization
with its attendant urgent challenges. These challenges must be
addressed and guided toward the realization of a viable and
sustainable planetary civilization. A viable paradigm of unity
of religions, as presented by the Bahá’í principle of Progressive
Revelation, is an absolute essential. It constitutes the
framework for the Bahá’í convictions, actions and worldview.

The Buddhist, the Hindu, the Zoroastrian, the Jewish, the
Christian, and the Moslem dispensations are under the Adamic
cycle with Muhammad, the Seal of the prophets ending this
cycle (see figure 5). The Báb and Bahá’u’lláh initiated the Bahá’í
Cycle (see figure 5),

In reflecting on Progressive Revelation, it is important to be
cognizant of the implications of the factors of geographical
and cultural milieu to which each divine educator brought His
message. The divine educators came to differing tribes and
cultures who were at differing levels of development and
receptivity. For example, Muhammad came to dissenting tribes
of idol worshipers, whereas Jesus came to the Jewish people
who were monotheistic. We can appreciate the relative
magnitude of advancement (progression) in divine revelation
which took place through Muhammad in isolated Arabia
amidst backward peoples and tribes. They were idolaters and
became monotheistic. The revelation of Muhammad induced in
these people a significant level of advancement which some view
as a quantum leap.
Selections from the Bahá’í authoritative writings on
Progressive Revelation

The Bahá’í paradigm of continuing Progressive Revelation
encompasses salient points and certain key concepts conveyed
through the following selections from Bahá’í authoritative
writings through the following passages.

> The fundamental principle enunciated by Bahá’u’lláh …

The Resistance to the Paradigm

The Bahá’í Paradigm of continuing Progressive Revelation
was articulated and proclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh in 1863. This
paradigm has been met with resistance, opposition and
rejection. The resistance may be compared, albeit, at a
heightened level, to the opposition and resistance which
confronted the shift of the paradigm of universe from the
geocentric to the heliocentric.

Much of this resistance and opposition can be attributed to
attachments and entrenchments in the paradigm of exclusivity

of truth as held by one religion. The implications of the process
of paradigm shift from the paradigm of exclusivity to the
Bahá’í paradigm of Progressive Revelation are intriguing. Such
a paradigm shift similar to that which took place with the
Copernican Revolution has implications of the element of
religious dogma which was based on literal understanding of
the scriptures. Again in this context, for the Christians, this is
due to the Church instituted doctrine of exclusivity of
salvation through Jesus Christ and for the Moslems it is the
finality of God’s revelation with Muhammad.

Thus there continues to be rejection and opposition to the
Bahá’í paradigm of Progressive Revelation. Such rejection and
vehement opposition have been to the extent of persecution,
imprisonments, and exile of Bahá’u’lláh, the prophet Founder
of the Bahá’í Faith, who presented this paradigm in mid
nineteenth century. The intensity of persecutions, burnings,
imprisonments and martyrdom of the proponents of the Bahá’í
paradigm have persisted to this day. Over 20,000 who adopted
and defended this paradigm were put to death. Such rejection
and resistance are reminiscent, to some extent, of the
opposition to the heliocentric universe.

Attempts are made to accommodate solutions to the puzzles
which face us within the context of the structure,
methodologies and restricted mindset of the old paradigm.
This is reminiscent of the attempts which were made to retain
the geocentric model of universe by accommodating the new
data on the length of orbits around the sun through the
introduction of epicircles. It did not work. Likewise attempts
to accommodate the requirements for unity of religions in the
context of the old paradigm of exclusivity of truth does not
work. The established structures, systems and organizations
are defective and incapable of addressing the unification of
religions and the urgent needs of our global age. Attempts to
force fit the needs of our times into the established paradigm
can only create further friction causing the breakage of its
framework. Nothing can work which is short of a total
acceptance and appreciation of the divine origin of all
religions and the continuing progression of religious truth.
Adoption of Paradigm

In order to adopt this expanded paradigm of religions
barriers must be overcome. Howard Margolis17 considers the
well entrenched “habits of the mind”, the barriers to a new

paradigm. These well entrenched habits of the mind include the
religious dogmas and the literal understanding of scriptures.
Additionally, there are needs and challenges associated with the
adoption of the Bahá’í worldview. The paradigm of Progressive
Revelation requires adoption of a whole new mindset; a
restructuring, a reeducation, a retooling, and a whole new
language. New methodologies hitherto unknown, must be
developed.

Thoughtful reflection on the Bahá’í paradigm of Progressive
Revelation, is compelling that its adoption can have powerful
implications. It imbues one with a new worldview; all of a
sudden beliefs and doctrines take on their true and expanded
meaning. Furthermore, the accumulating anomalies and puzzles
which have arisen in the context of the prevailing paradigms of
religions can find their resolution.
Assimilation of Paradigm

When the expanded paradigm of Progressive Revelation is
adopted and assimilated one is able to overcome the barrier of
religious dogmas on exclusivity of truth and salvation limited
to one religion. It is then that the anomalies and puzzles find
their solution. Assimilation of this paradigm is tantamount to
opening up of new vistas, vast horizons and new undreamt of
possibilities. The Bahá’í paradigm of Progressive Revelation has
now been assimilated by over some six million inhabitants of
our planet. Its transformative power has been set in motion
radiating out from this relatively small but significant
percentage of humanity. When this paradigm is adopted by a
critical mass of the inhabitant of this planet, it is then that a
fuller measure of its transformative power will be felt.

Discussion
Comparisons between The paradigm of Progressive Revelation
and The Paradigm of the Heliocentric Universe

The paradigm of Progressive Revelation can be compared
and contrasted in certain respects with the paradigm of the
heliocentric universe.

The paradigm of universe is based on scientific discoveries
and the paradigm of Progressive Revelation is based on
revelations whose source is the divine reality. Religion and

science are in harmony and from the same source of knowledge;
however they differ in their domains, their language and modes
of expression. Scientific advancement is brought about by
scientists reaching out to uncover the mysteries of outer
phenomena. Religious progression and advancement are
brought by the Divine Educators who provide to man guidance
from that ultimate reality, God.

The following quotes from Bahá’í sacred Scriptures warrant
in-depth reflection:

> Science may be likened to a mirror wherein the images
> of the mysteries of outer phenomena are reflected. It
> brings forth and exhibits to us in the arena of
> knowledge all the product of the past. It links together
> past and present”…. Science is the governor of nature
> and its mysteries, the one agency by which man
> explores the institutions of material creation. (Abdu’l-
> Bahá’ in BWF 242)
> Religion is the outer expression of the divine reality.
> Therefore, it must be living, vitalized, moving and
> progressive. (Abdu’l-Bahá’ in BWF 224)
The stage of acceptance of the Bahá’í paradigm of
Progressive Revelation bears similarities to the stage of
acceptance of the paradigm of heliocentric universe (in
reference to the thesis of Kuhn). Both were confronted with the
barriers of religious dogmas and the literal understanding of
scriptures. The heliocentric model of universe was finally
accepted after centuries. The paradigm of Progressive
Revelation which was presented in 1863 by Bahá’u’lláh
continues to face this barrier. Both paradigms have elicited
vehement oppositions and reactions from those entrenched and
committed to the previously established paradigms.

The adoption of the Bahá’í paradigm of Progressive
Revelation confers to each religion its rightful place; not at the
center, but rather as a planet revolving around that center,
God, the Sun of Truth. The Copernican revolution provides a
powerful metaphor. With the adoption of paradigm of a
heliocentric universe things took on new meaning. Earth was
no longer at the center of universe with the moon, the known
planets as well as the Sun itself, revolving around it; rather
earth was one planet revolving around the sun. The sun was no
longer a planet revolving around the earth; rather it was at the
very center. The meaning and significance of the sun and planet

earth changed radically. Such a transition had profound
implications introducing a significantly higher level of
comprehension. It changed and transformed Earth
centeredness into Sun centeredness.

Similarly the assimilation of the Bahá’í paradigm of
Progressive Revelation, can bring about a major
transformation in our worldview from exclusivity to
inclusivity of truth. The different religions find their proper
placements as planets revolving around the Sun of Truth, God.
The transition of worldview from dogma centeredness to God
centeredness can bring about a profound transformation. The
divine reality, God, takes on its rightful place at the very center
with religions coursing along their orbits around it!

When paradigms change our world view changes. We begin to
see things in a whole new way. We see them in a different light.
We begin to see what we did not see before. This is tantamount
to a major transformation; it is a gestalt switch. The work of the
Hanover Institute provides an interesting metaphor. In
experiments when the subject wears a goggle with inverting
lenses, initially he becomes disoriented for the world is seen
upside down; however some time after, the visual field inverts
over and the world is seen right side up18 . A transformation has
taken place in visual gestalt. When paradigms change our
worldview changes.

It is important to emphasize that with the adoption of the
new paradigm, old data can be explained and confirmed taking
on new meaning. In the context of the new paradigm the
fundamental facts remain unchanged. The fundamental facts
about the universe did not change with the shift in paradigm of
universe. The fundamental truth underlying religions does not
change in the context of the Bahá’í paradigm of unity of
religions. The truth does not change!

The process of advancement in knowledge of universe,
specifically through the Copernican Revolution, demonstrates
features which can be compared to that of the Bahá’í paradigm
of unity of religions (Progressive Revelation). Both have
revolutionary features although they are essentially evolutionary
processes. The knowledge of the universe has advanced through
observations, findings and collection of data; thus these findings
have been cumulative and therefore evolutionary. The Bahá’í
principle of Progressive Revelation upholds that the revelation of
God’s truth to man is progressive; hence in essence, it is

cumulative and thus evolutionary. However, the implications of
religious dogmas introduce to it a de facto revolutionary
feature. The revolutionary features of both, the heliocentric
model of universe and the Bahá’í principle of Progressive
Revelation can be attributed, to a great extent, to the
implications of religious dogmas. This point was discussed in a
previous section of this paper.

It is important to note that the resistance to the change of
paradigm of universe from geocentric to heliocentric, persisted
over several centuries. However, after that first crucial shift,
that coup d’état, had taken place, research and advancement in
science of universe took on an evolutionary path leading over
time to smooth expansion of paradigms. The rate of
accumulation of data on the knowledge of universe has since
increased by leaps and bounds. Similarly, it is anticipated that
once that initial resistance to the Bahá’í paradigm of Progressive
Revelation is overcome and once the essential tools and
methodologies develop, then the process leading to the adoption
of the paradigm of unity of religions will show significant
acceleration.

It must be borne in mind that the term revolutionary is often
used when the discovery is such that it marks a turning point in
the particular field. There are numerous examples of such
revolutionary processes. In the field of biology, the acceptance
of the structure of DNA as shown through the data of Watson
and Crick as well as those of other scientists, revolutionized the
field. In the domain of religion, the paradigm of unity of
religions as presented by the Bahá’í principle of Progressive
Revelation, has significant implications such that it can
revolutionize mindsets and civilizations. This, in particular, has
profound implications at this critical juncture in history when
humankind is facing the challenges of globalization.

Concluding Comments

In recent times, the urgent need for addressing the rising
religious fanaticism and fundamentalism is deeply felt by
many. There is increase in interfaith activities, groups, and
organizations with the noble mission of improving inter-
religious dialogues and fellowship. This, they see as a solution
in addressing the conflicts which have arisen in our global
society. All these attempts underscore the urgency in
addressing the ever intensifying need for a vital, viable,

sustainable and an all encompassing worldview of unity of
religions. There is a dire need for a paradigm which can unify
all religions. The need for such a paradigm has been there for
some time. Leo Tolstoy, the eminent Russian writer and
philosopher of the early twentieth century was among those
who wished to resolve the question of religious differences and
even contemplated to construct a universal religion which
would encompass all religions. However, the enormity of the
task is such that nothing short of a force with the potency to
transmute mindsets and elevate human consciousness, is
capable of bringing about a transformation of such
magnitude. One may ask, what agency has such potency?

The Bahá’í principle of Progressive Revelation is a candidate
paradigm for bringing about the unification of religions,
cultures and nation in this global age. The acceptance and
adoption of the Bahá’í paradigm of unity of religions can
provide solutions to the dilemmas and needs of our time. Yet,
its acceptance continues to follow a long and difficult path
strewn with resistance and barriers. However, once it is
adopted and assimilated it is bound to bring about a major
transformation in our global society.

Legends to Figures 1 through 5

Paradigm of Progressive Revelation showing progression over time

This figure is a diagrammatic representation of the Bahá’í
paradigm of Progressive Revelation showing continuing
progression in divine truth. The circles represent successive
revelation of God’s truth through the divine educators:
Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad and the
Twin Manifestations, the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. (labeled) The
core, that essence of divine truth within each religion, is
represented by the symbol of the sun.

The essential connection between the divine educators

This figure is a diagrammatic representation of the paradigm.
This diagram is similar to Fig. 1, but this rendering emphasizes
the interconnection and the essential linkages between the
religions brought by the divine educators. The dashed curved
line indicates continuity of revelation into the future.

Features shared by religions: A fresh perspective

This figure is similar to Figure 1 but from different angle of
view. The successive circles (representing dispensations/
religions) are rotated 450 around the axis of their common
core. This results in the figure shown in insert at the upper
right hand corner of this figure. The inserted figure shows
those religions (dispensations) as concentric circles containing
a common corner; this is shown by the image of sun at the
center of concentric circles. This concentric circle provides a
fresh perspective on the paradigm of Progressive Revelation.

Unified Paradigm of Religions
Fig. 4 is an enlargement of the insert from Fig. 3, which was
obtained by rotation of the successive circles (representing
dispensations/religions) at 450 around the axis of their central
common core. This figure represents concentric circles all
encompassing the same common core (represented by the Sun at
the center) of the infinite Divine reality. The circles include
common areas and overlaps which are shared by consecutive
circles. The outward directed arrows emphasize that
continuation of revelation through the divine educators will
continue into the future.

Paradigm of Progressive Revelation showing progression over time, space

This figure is a diagrammatic representation of the major
religions of the world over time and space of which we have
record. These religions arose in different parts of the world and
have been in the past geographically isolated. The Buddhist and
the Hindu arose from India and the Zoroastrian, the Jewish,
the Christian, the Moslem, the Bábí and the Bahá’í Faiths arose
in the Middle East and the Arabian peninsula. Please note the
connecting linkage (at this point in time) of the Hindu and
Buddhist religions to the twin manifestations the Báb and
Bahá’u’lláh. The Buddhist, the Hindu, the Zoroastrian, the
Jewish, the Christian, and the Moslem dispensations are under
the Adamic cycle with Muhammad the seal, the end of that
cycle. The Báb and Bahá’u’lláh initiated the Bahá’í Cycle.
