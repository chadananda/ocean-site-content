     The Dialogue between Yin-Yang Concepts

and the Bahá'í Faith

Phyllis Ghim Lian Chew

Abstract

The yin-yang concept is a pivotal theory in traditional Chinese thought
influencing many aspects of Chinese civilization, government,
architecture, personal relationships and ethics. There are significant
similarities between this ancient paradigm and the spirit and principles of
the Bahá’í Faith, especially regarding the origin of matter, the nature of
history, man-woman relationships and health and healing. Bearing in
mind the UN Year 2001 for a Creative “Dialogue Among Civilizations”,
this paper will set out to discuss how these similarities may be helpful in
the modem encounter between Chinese culture and the Bahá'i Faith.

1\. Introduction

From its earliest expression in myth, legend and verse over 3,000 years
ago, the yin-yang concept has remained central to the Chinese way of
viewing things and can be said to be the primal polarity in the individual
and the cosmos in Chinese thought.1 While this observation of the
prominence of the principle of duality in the frame of things is not unique
to China,2 it is highly pertinent to speak of it as essentially “Chinese”
since it has penetrated deeply into the popular culture and dominated the

1The origin o f yin-yang is not linked to the vision o f any single individual or to any single
text and the question o f its beginning remains a matter o f great dispute. Such a concept
may have existed even in Neolithic China before the rise o f high civilization. It was first
recorded in texts o f the Spring and Autumn period (722-481 BC).
2 One o f the Hermetic texts repeats the same theme: “All things are but two: that which is
made and that which makes. And the one cannot be separated from the other, the Maker
cannot exist apart from the thing made, nor the thing made apart from the Maker”
(Libellus 14:5, qtd. in Brown, “A BaháM Perspective o f Matter” p. 26).

languages of medicine, geomancy, and other accepted “sciences” without
major challenge.

The ancient Chinese first postulated the notion of two opposing basic
forces springing from the framework of Tao (xfi: “One/Totality”) to
explain the tension between stability and change in the seasons. For the
Chinese, yin-yang concepts were able to account for many natural
phenomena. Indeed, current scientific thought deeply reinforces the
feeling that humans are fundamentally shaped by forces—natural and
social—beyond human control, and there is the accompanying belief that
those who understand these forces are somehow able to master them in
the service of human ends. There is thus a quest to align the human realm
with the realm of nature, and while the cosmic individual, Chinese or
otherwise, does not “control” nature, his or her knowledge of how to
“align” the human with the natural immeasurably enlarges the ability to
control his or her life.

What is little known, however, is that there are significant similarities
between this ancient paradigm and the spirit and principles of the Bahá'í
Faith, especially regarding the origin of matter, the nature of history, man-
woman relationships and health and healing. Bearing in mind the UN
Year 2001 for a “Creative Dialogue among Civilizations”, this paper will
set out to discuss how these similarities may be helpful in the modem
encounter between Chinese culture and the Bahá'í Faith. Dialogue is
important because of the need to prevent ethnocentricism in a rapidly
shrinking and inter-connected world. There is a need to be exposed to
different traditions and psychological viewpoints. It becomes important to
view modem science as just one tradition of science amongst many
others.

Before proceeding further with this modem encounter between yin-yang
concepts and the Bahá'í Faith, I need to state from the onset that the
subsequent references to Taoist influence refer more to Taoist philosophy
rather than Taoist religion. The former is represented by the philosophies
of Lao-tzu and Chuang-tzu, documented in the texts ascribed to them,
namely the Tao-te Ching and the Chuang-tzu as well as the later materials
such as the Huainanzi and the Liezi. The Taoist religion, on the other
hand, can be traced to Chang Tao-ling (c. 2nd century CE), who claimed
that he had a vision whereby Lao-tzu gave him the authority to organise

religious communities, forgive faults and sins, and to heal and to exorcise
evil spirits. Over the centuries, many different schools of Taoism arose,
based on Chang’s vision, which drew inspiration, imagery and even gods
from the original philosophy of Lao Tzu.3

2\. The Theory: Yin and Yang

Before the commencement of our dialogue, the basic features of yin-yang
cosmology need to be drawn out. Basically, its essential characteristics
may be summarized into four key concepts: relativity, unity,
complementarity, and balance.

Relativity
Yin and yang are, first and foremost, conceptual archetypes rather than
actual material entities. They are philosophical constructs of two polar
elements and, by themselves, do not mean anything since they are only
employed to express a relation: one notion is the opposite of the other; the
one is positive, the other negative. The ancient Chinese regard these
concepts as balancing powers in the universe for regulating cosmic order,
and use them to describe how things function in relation to each other and
to the universe.

Yin and yang also contain within themselves the possibility of opposition
and change; that is, yin and yang can be further divided into yin and yang.
This is an extension of the logic that divides all phenomena into yin and
yang aspects, allowing further division within aspects ad infinitum. This
means that within each yin and yang category, another yin and yang
category can be distinguished. For example, the son is both yin and yang;
yin because he is believed to be inferior to his father and yang because he
is believed to be superior as male. Nothing is neutral, and everything is
relative and contains within it a multiplicity of relationships. In other
words, nothing is absolutely yin or yang—only more yin compared to
something, or more yang compared to something else.

3 See P. G. L. Chew, “Death and Immortality: the Taoist Religion in Singapore and the
Bahá'í Faith.”

6             THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ1 STUDIES REVIEW

As relative concepts, yin and yang can be used extensively to explain a
host of natural and social phenomena. In an old text of myths, called the
Chang Huang T ’u-shu Pien,4 the unlimited extension of the yin and yang
is further clarified:

> “Heaven and the sun, spring and summer, east and south are yang, the
> earth and the moon, autumn and winter, west and north are yin. But
> during the day heaven and earth are both yang, and at night they are
> both yin. In spring and summer, heaven and earth, the sun and the
> moon are all yang, in autumn and winter they are all yin. In the east
> and the south the four seasons are always yang, in the west and the
> north they are always yin. The left hand is yang, the right one yin, in
> this no change is possible, but raise both hands, then they are both
> yang, and put them down, and they are both yin, and no matter whether
> you raise them or put them down, when they are hot they are both
> yang, and when they are cold they are both yin.”

Therefore, although it is possible to distinguish yin and yang, it is
impossible to separate them since they depend on each other for
definition. Furthermore, the things in which yin and yang are
distinguished could not be defined without the existence of yin and yang
dualities; for example, one cannot speak of temperature apart from its yin
and yang aspects—hot or cold. It is this notion of relativity as suggested
throughout the Tao-te Ching (c. 450 BC), a small (about 5,000 characters)
but extraordinary work on Chinese life and culture written by one called
Lao-tze (“old man” or “teacher”):

> “For what is and what is not beget each other;
> Difficult and easy complete each other;
> Long and short show each other;
> High and low place each other;
> Noise and sound harmonize each other;
> Before and behind follow each other.”5

Su Shih (960-1279 AD), a poet-scholar from the Sung dynasty, indicates
the importance of paying attention to perspectives. When there is a shift

in our position, the objects appear to change. Therefore, we can no longer
be so naive as to assume that what we see constitutes all there is to see.
Again, the notion of relativity is subtly emphasized:

> “From the side, a whole range; from the end, a single peak:
> Far, near, high, low no two parts alike. Why can’t I tell the true shape
> of Lu Shan?

Because I myself am in the mountain.”6

Unity
The second characteristic to note in the discussion of the yin-yang
correlates is their essential unity. While one might have expected that the
two would result in opposite poles, incompatible and irreconcilable, the.
opposite is actually the case. The two are, in essence, basically one. Thus,
in place of the theories of duality, competition, and opposition so common
in Western philosophy, there is instead the theory of succession; e.g., day
follows night, night follows day, small becomes big, big becomes small,
slow changes to fast, fast slackens to slow, what goes up comes down and
vice versa. It is a system of thought whereby all things are seen as parts of
a whole. No entity can ever be isolated from its relationship to other
entities, and nothing can exist in and of itself.

One factor influencing this implicit unity of polarity is the notion that the
correlates originate from and are united in one common principle, i.e., the
Tao, the life-giving power or principle. This idea was also evident in the
ideas of the Greek philosophers of the Ionian School (c. 585-540 BC)
e.g., Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, who argued that orderliness
could only be explained though the existence of a single unifying
substance which was in control of all the parts. The Eastern traditions
constantly refer to this ultimate, indivisible reality which manifests itself
in all things and of which all things are parts. It is called Brahman in
Hinduism, Dharmakaya in Buddhism, and Tao in Taoism. Because it
transcends all concepts and categories, the Buddhist also calls it Tathata
or “Suchness”. This also bears some similarity to the Bahá’í idea of the
“First will” or what the ancient philosophers termed the “First Mind.”
According to 4Abdu’l-Bahá, it is an emanation which is “not limited by

time or place; it is without beginning or end—beginning and end in
relation to God are one.”7

On this mystic concept of Tao, Chuang-tzu (370 to 319 BC), a literary
genius with profound spiritual insights, has constructed his view of the
universe. According to him, the manifestation of this first principle in
each individual thing is called “te” (@: “virtue”). Tao and te, thus, are
actually of one essence, the former being the universal essence, and the
latter the share of the former deposited in every individual being. In short,
Taoism is the philosophy of the unity of the universe and the return of all
to the “Primeval One,” the “Divine Intelligence,” the “Source” of all
things. For the Taoist then, the ideal is, implicitly, to return to Tao. As
Chuang-tzu puts it:

> “In the beginning there was non-being. It had neither being nor name.
> The One originates from it: it has oneness but not yet physical form.
> When things obtain it and come into existence, that is called virtue
> (which gives their individual character). That which is formless is
> divided into yin and yang and from the beginning going on without
> interruption is called destiny (ming np: “fate”). Through movement and
> rest, it produces all things. When things are produced in accordance
> with the principle (li i_!) there is a physical form. When the activities
> follow their own specific principles, that is nature. By cultivating one’s
> nature one will return to virtue. When virtue is perfect, one will be one
> with the beginning. Being one with the beginning, one becomes
> vacuous (thus, receptive to all) and being vacuous, one becomes great.
> One will then be united with the sound and breath of things. When one
> is united with the breath of things, one is then united with the
> universe.”8

In the Tafsir-i-Kuntu Kanzan Makhifiyyan, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that
form and substance arise simultaneously and that they are interdependent:

> “They have said that the potentialities (qábiliyyát) and the recipients of
> the potentialities (maqbúlát) came into being and were created
> simultaneously. For example, it has been stated that all things are
> composed of two elements: the “Fashioner” (qábil) and the “Fashioned

> (maqbúl). By “Fashioned” is meant substance (mádda) and primary
> matter (huyúlá), and by Fashioner is meant form and shape, which
> confines and limits the primary matter from its state of indefiniteness

> 2:3 5)9

It must be noted that this belief in unity or the basic oneness of the
universe is also one of the most important revelations of modem
physics10. However, while Chinese philosophers believe in the existence
of a common principle or life-giving force11 which binds both yin and
yang, they are silent about whether humanity evolved accidentally or as a
result of God’s purpose. All that they are committed to saying are that yin
and yang are united in the essential unity of the Tao and that all changes
in nature are manifestations of the dynamic interplay between the polar
opposites yin and yang. This stands in strong contrast to prophetic
religions, such as the Bahá’í Faith, which teaches that humanity’s origins
can be viewed as the unfolding of God’s plan12 and that the “Word of
God . . . is the Cause of the entire creation, while all else besides His
Word are but the creatures and the effects thereof.”13

Complementarity
We have already discussed how the yin-yang concepts are a pair of
opposites in a dynamic polar relationship with each other. Another
distinctive characteristic of yin-yang cosmology is its essential
complementarity. It is a view of a wholesome nature made up intricately
of halves. In other words, everything that is a half must be completed by
another half, for example, spirit and matter, subject and object, inside and
outside, above and below, man and woman, light and darkness, etc. .

This relationship may be better understood if we look at the yin-yang
symbol. Here, the circle representing the whole is divided into yin (black)

11 “Principle” suggests a more abstract, perhaps “metaphysical” interpretation. In Neo-
Confucianism, this marks the divide between “I” (principle) and “Ch’i” (vital energy).
Earlier, the idea o f a “life-giving force” is used to explain what gives rise to yin and yang

and yang (white). The small circles of opposite shading illustrate that
within yang, there is yin and vice versa. In any yin phenomenon there is a
little yang; in every yang phenomenon there is a little yin. In other words,
the night is never completely dark because there is always some yang
light (from the moon, stars, fireflies), and the yang day has some darkness
(shadows for instance). The dynamic curve dividing them indicates that
yin and yang are continuously merging. Thus, yin and yang create, control
and transform each other.14

This intricate complementarity is also extended to the relationship
between humankind and nature and thus an organic conception of the
cosmos is proposed; that is, the view of the human being as a
microcosmic image of the macrocosm. This embodies a belief that
everything, however small, in some sense reflects this relationship. Just as
the ce]ls of the body imply the whole, so every part of creation implies the
cosmos. As the work of Chuang-tzu portrays, the Tao is the all-pervading
principle that exists prior to the existence of the universe, and it is to be
found in every thing, no matter how trivial or base.15

14 Visually, this is best illustrated in classical Chinese art, e.g., landscape paintings where
men and women, activity and tranquility, mountain and water, etc., are balanced and
harmonized.

The Dialogue between Yin-Yang Concepts and the Bahá 7 Faith                           11

‘Abdu’l-Bahá says something similar which requires further reflection:
“ . . all parts of the creational world are of one whole.”16 In reference to
animals and vegetables, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes: , .the animal, as to its
body, is made up of the same constituent elements as man.”17 “All the
elements that are combined in man exist also in vegetables.”18 In addition,
the following quotation has a broader meaning but is relevant
nevertheless. Quoting the Imám ‘Alí, BaháVlláh writes, “Dost thou
reckon thyself only a puny form, when within thee the universe is
folded?”19

The essence of this complementarity reinforces once again the awareness
of the mutual interrelation of all objects and events, and the experience of
all phenomena in the world as manifestations of a basic oneness. All
things are seen as interdependent and inseparable parts of the cosmic
whole; as different manifestations of the same ultimate reality. The “ten
thousand things,” which the ancient Chinese believed to spin around Tao,
are not isolated entities spinning around time and space, but rather spirit
and matter, mineral and plant, animal and human, which are all
manifestations of the Tao, which is indivisible, transcendent, and
immanent all at the same time.20 To understand any part demands an
understanding of the whole.

This idea is implicit in the cosmology of early Chinese texts. The Shu-
ching (Book of History),21 for example, contains an early mention of the
human and cosmic correspondence. “Heaven,” it says, “hears and sees as
our people hear and see.” The Li-chi (Collection of Rituals) describes
human beings as “the product of the attributes of Heaven and Earth, by
the interaction of the dual force of nature, the union of the animal “kuei”
(J/U: “ghost”), and the intelligent “shen” (jjj$: “soul”), and the finest matter
of the five elements.” This idea of a human being as a miniature heaven

20 Note that the attribution o f transcendence to Tao is challenged by those who consider
Tao to be a kind of process philosophy. Here, Tao is immanent, the sum total o f being and
non-being. This view maintains the inter-relatedness o f all things. The totality o f all the
particulars is Tao. See R. P. Peerenboom, Cosmogony, the Taoist Way.
21 This is a book of sayings ascribed to the legendary sage kings Yao and Shun in the third
millennium BC.

and earth is also fundamental to the Ching (Book of Changes)22 which
likens heaven to the head and earth to the belly. Macro-micro
correspondences constitute a constant theme in many of the hexagrams of
the    I Ching.23

A famous poem by Chang Tsai (1020-77 AD), a pioneer of Neo-
Confucianism, reads: “Heaven is my father and Earth is my mother, and
even such a small creature as I find an intimate place in their midst.
Therefore that which fills the universe I regard as my body and that which
directs the universe I consider as my nature. All people are my brothers
and sisters, and all things are my companions.”24

The Bahá’í perspective, like yin-yang cosmology, points to the
significance of complementarity. Members and elements are
interconnected and influence one another spiritually and materially,
although this has not yet been conclusively substantiated by present-day
science. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá declares, “but I mean that this limitless universe is
like the human body, all the members of which are connected and linked
with one another with the greatest strength. . . . In the same way, the parts
of this infinite universe have their members and elements connected with
one another, and influence one another spiritually and materially.”25

Balance
The fourth important characteristic of yin-yang theory is the delicate role
of balance, which is needed to promote harmony between the two

In Chinese literature, four holy men are cited as authors, namely: Fu Hsi, the legendary
figure representing the era o f hunting and fishing and the invention o f cooking; King Wen;
the Duke o f Chou; and Confucius.
23 This belief is chiefly responsible for the Chinese art o f geomancy, feng shui (literally
“wind and water”). Since the cosmos is a unity, no part o f which is finally independent
from the whole, it follows that events at one level, or in one place, will have their influence
at other levels and in other places. Feng shui thus claims to teach people how to rule nature
and guide their own destiny by revealing to them the ways o f heaven and earth.
Knowledge o f feng shui, was therefore a means o f transforming people from the play­
things o f nature to co-creators with her; this was not only o f benefit to humanity, but also
to the natural world, which was seen in a sense as waiting for the helping hand o f human
understanding and human action for its fulfillment.

polarities. Balance is needed if complementary opposites are to interact to
achieve stability for the entire creation.

While most Western philosophies have tended to be lopsided by
glorifying one pole at the expense of the other—e.g., the mind is
considered to be better than the body, and logic better than intuition—the
yin-yang paradigm emphasizes the equality of proportions. A deficiency
of one aspect implies an excess of the other. Thus, if yin is excessive,
yang will be too weak. For example, summer is considered as yang and
isolated as such, it may seem “excessive,” but not so if the whole of the
four seasons is taken into account. There is a cosmological balance.
Another example is that if it is too hot, then there is not enough coolness
and vice versa. If the temperature is neither too cold nor too hot, then both
cold and hot aspects are mutually controlled and held in check. In human
relationships, as in a marriage, one can say that here the extent to which
one partner can be aggressive depends on the extent to which the other is
passive. They exert mutual control over each other. Thus, in a relationship
in which yin and yang are unbalanced for long periods of time, the
resulting transformation may be drastic.

When Confucius (551-^479 BC) wrote The Doctrine o f the                , he
meant that both excess and inadequacy were extremes and that only by
understanding the “Mean” and holding on to it could harmony be
achieved.26 Thus, there is a saying of Confucius that, “to go beyond is as
wrong as to fall short” {Analects, 11:15). Likewise, BaháVlláh said that
“In all matters moderation is desirable. If a thing is carried to excess, it
will prove a source of evil.”27

This traditional notion of balance has significant implications on moral
values and has been used to explain the relationship between good and
evil. To the Chinese philosophical mind, good and bad are, first and
foremost, opposites that are interrelated in the same way as yin and yang.
For Chuang-tzu (who believed that the notions of right and wrong do not
exist, since right is right only because of the existence of wrong), nothing
can be said to be absolutely right.28 Good and evil are movements along
the same spectrum, and for each concept to be meaningful, the other must

exist.29 This was a very advanced realization for its day, bearing in mind
that ‘Abdiťl-Bahá had to emphasize with great thoroughness in the
twentieth century that just as darkness is but the absence or reduction of
light, so evil is but the absence or reduction of good—the undeveloped
state. A bad person is one who has not developed the better side of his
nature, just as a good person is one who has. Chuang-tzu believes that
conflict arises when a person departs from Tao and tries to act contrary to
nature.

This concept of balancing both yin and yang forces and of being at one
with Tao has been used to teach morality throughout Chinese history.
Lao-tzu illustrates this paradox within a set of instructions on the
cultivation of values:

> “On tiptoe you don’t stand.
> Astride you don’t walk.
> Showing yourself, you don’t shine.
> Asserting yourself, you don’t show.
> Boasting yourself won’t get you credit.
> Vaunting yourself won’t let you endure.
> In Tao, these things are called
> Tumors and dregs, which all things abhor.

Whoever has Tao does not dwell on them.”30

This paradox of the variability between two poles foreshadows the words
of Jesus five hundred years later: “Blessed are the meek for they shall
inherit the earth” (Matt. 5:5) and “The first shall be last and the last first”
(Matt. 19:30).

There i$, however, a distinct difference between the concept of balance in
the Chinese psyche and in the Bahd’i Faith. While keeping to the mean is
imperative for harmony, what exactly the mean is in regard to moral and
social behaviour is not known. For the Chinese, it is a theoretical mean, a
philosophical concept. For the Bahá’ís, however, the Book itself, the

whether there were poverty or not.

Kiláb-i-Aqdas, the “Most Holy Book” is “the unerring Balance
established amongst men.”31

With an understanding of these four essential characteristics of yin-yang
cosmology, I will now proceed to a preliminary exploration of four areas;
namely, the origin of creation, the nature of history, the relationship of
man and woman, and health and healing, and examine these concepts’
relationships across time and space to the Bahá'í Faith.

3\. The Tao of Creation

The idea of causation, central to Western thinking, is almost entirely
absent in Chinese thought. Indeed no Chinese thinker who discusses the
subject admits the possibility of any initial conscious act of creation.
Things influence each another not by mechanical causes but by a kind of
induction effect. For the Chinese, things were connected, rather than
caused. Unlike the ancient Greeks who believed that the essence of
knowledge is to grasp the “why” or to prove the existence of the primary
cause, the Chinese, influenced by the yin and yang paradigm, were most
interested in understanding the interrelations of patterns within the cosmos
and in becoming attuned to the unseen dynamic. As Ronan and Needham
argue:

> “The fundamental difference was that in Europe, there was a need to
> think of God as the creator or the prime mover behind the machine.
> Not the Chinese. To them the parts of a living body as the universe
> could account for the observed phenomena by a kind of will: co­
> operation of the component part was spontaneous, even involuntary
> and this alone was sufficient. There were thus two traditions of the
> universe and each went their separate ways.”32

One reason for the absence of the issue of cause and effect in three
thousand years of Chinese philosophy33 is that the word “cause” implies a

33 However, the term “Creator” (                 Zháo Wú Zhé, and íiH fc # Zháo Húa Zhé) is
found in the Chuang-tzu.

direct dependency with the effects in much the same way that the attribute
of knowledge requires the existence of objects of knowledge. Similarly,
the term “Creator” assumes its counterpart, the created, in order to be
comprehensible. There was therefore no reason to debate on cause and
effect since this was already implied or understood. As the first chapter of
the Tao-te Ching reiterates:

> “If Tao can be Taoed, it is not Tao.
> If its name can be named, it is not its name.
> Has no name: precedes heaven and earth;
> Has a name: mother of ten thousand things.”

The First Cause or the Creator is not the focus here. There is an implied
acceptance that it exists, and no effort is made to postulate the hows or
whys of its existence. Only a description of the Tao suffices. The Bahá’í
Faith, however, explicitly indicates that while God is the creator of all
things, God exists completely outside the order of creation. God is like a
Divine Craftsperson:

> “Lauded be Thy Name, O Lord my God! I testify that Thou wast a
> hidden Treasure wrapped within Thine immemorial Being and an
> impenetrable Mystery enshrined in Thine own Essence. Wishing to
> reveal Thyself, Thou didst call into being the Greater and the Lesser
> Worlds [the world hereafter and this world] . . .”34

According to the Bahá’í scriptures, God is unknowable and is set apart
from his creation. God is outside time and space—both of which are His
creation. Being outside the time-space parameters, it becomes logical then
to assert that “the latter world hath neither beginning nor end,”35
something not incomparable with the Taoist’s (Chuang-tzu’s) notion of
heaven as “one of ceaseless revolution, without beginning or end.”36

Nevertheless, while not concerned in the “whys” of creation, China’s
greatest thinkers were keen to understand the “hows.” Drawing from yin-
yang theory, it was postulated that the cosmos is a series of progressions
from the One Great Ultimate—the T’ai Ch’i—to the two principles yin

and yang; the three sources; heaven, earth and humankind; the four
seasons; “wu-hsing” (Efj- “five phases”) represented symbolically by
wood, fire, earth, metal and water; and so forth. According to this system,
all things, from the big to the small, whether concrete objects, ideas,
situations, etc. are results of the interaction of yin and yang.

Interestingly, BaháVlláh also explains the cause of creation through two
poles somewhat similar in spirit to the yin and yang—the active force and
its recipient or the even and the odd contained in the One that precedes
multiplicity. By their interaction, a “heat” or life-giving energy is
generated that creates and orders the innumerable beings in the universe:

> “The world of existence came into being through the heat generated
> from the interaction between the active force and that which is its
> recipient. These two are the same, yet they are different.”38

BaháVlláh calls that which first results from the active force and its
recipient prior to the generation of the world, “al-failayn”, the twin active
agents, and “al-munfa’il”, the twin passive agents, and affirms that they
“are indeed created through the irresistible Word of God.”39 In other
tablets, he identifies them with the four elements,40 interestingly enough,
something not quite unlike the Chinese “five phases.”

The Chinese conception of the five phases (wood, fire, earth, metal and
water) apparently stabilized as an ordering principle of Chinese organic
philosophy during the late Spring and Autumn period, and like yin-yang,
derive from more ancient roots.41 One notes that the ideas which lay
behind the five phases may not have been associated with actual material
elements, but rather as elements which assume a dynamic “dialectic”

37 The term wu-hsing is often translated as “five elements’’ but that term is misleading,
implying that wood, fire, earth, metal, and water are constituents o f physical matter. The
five are not “elements,” but paradigms or analogies for specific modes o f being or activity.
38 BaháV lláh, Tablets o f Bahá u ’lláh, p 140.
39 Ibid., p 140.
40 That is, “fire,” “air,” “water,” and “earth,” the first tokens by which the material creation
is generated. See Brown, “A Bahá’í Perspective o f Matter” p 28, pp. 35-36.
41 The reasons for developing five categories, rather than some other number, are not
clearly known. However, they may derive from astrological considerations o f the five
visible planets.

relation to each other. Similarly, many of the terms used in Baháh natural
philosophy e.g. earth, water, air, fire, coming from its classical Greek,42
Indo-European, and Islamic heritage, to describe the metaphysical origin
of the universe, cannot always be interpreted in a literary fashion but
should be understood in the context of the tradition from which they
derive. What is significant is the conceptual similarity of its postulation
despite the separation in time and place.

The four elements in the Bahá’í writings which can be held up for
structural and conceptual comparison with the Chinese theory of the five
phases were expounded in the Lawh-i-Ayiy-i-Nur (Tablet of the Verse of
Light):

> “Know ye that the first tokens that emanated from the pre- existent
> Cause in the worlds of creation are the four elements: fire, air, water,
> and earth... Then the natures (ustuqusat) of these four appeared: heat,
> moisture, cold and dryness—those same qualities that ye both reckon
> and know. When the elements interacted and joined with one another,
> two pillars became evident for each one: for fire, heat and dryness, and
> likewise for the remaining three in accordance with these rules, as ye
> are aware. By them God created all that there is in the worlds of
> creation, whether of the higher or lower realms. In whatsoever things
> these natures came into equilibrium that thing endured the passage of
> time, as ye behold with the sun and the moon; and in whatsoever thing
> these natures came not into balance, that thing passed quickly into
> extinction, even as ye observe to be the case with the creatures of the
> lower worlds.”43

The above quotation suggests the gradual development of life on earth,
which is* also a part of the belief of ancient China.44 The I Ching, for

42 In the West, the ancient Greeks had elements which did refer to substance, recognizing

Aristotle, that the Greek elements became properly associated with qualities (Ronan and
Needham, The Shorter Science, p 147).

Matter,” pp 35-36.
44 This contrasts with the literal interpretations o f the Bible that the earth is only around
6,000 years old. Bahá’u’lláh states: “The learned men, that have fixed at several thousand
years the life o f this earth, have failed, throughout the long period o f their observation, to

instance, views civilization as a systematic and progressive development
from simple undifferentiated beginnings towards a complex structure, and
the development of the individual as following a parallel course from
ignorance to enlightenment and from an unwitting identity with Tao to
knowing the Tao. The following is a traditional story accounting for the
gradual creation of the universe:

> “A period of 2,267,000 years was computed to have intervened from
> the beginning of heaven and earth to the year 480 BC. This period was
> divided into great sections, each with its own characteristics. Preceding

> a homogeneous unit without form. Out of this limitless chaos came the

> sun, moon, planets and constellations; and the four lesser Bodies—
> water, fire, earth and stone. Then was the eternal stillness terminated.
> The interactions of these various bodies produced transformations, first
> of a simple then of a more complex kind till they finally culminated in
> the production of man. Though man was the most intelligent of all
> beings, many ages elapsed before the earliest rudiments of civilization
appeared. Some of the remote ancestors of the Chinese dwelt in caves,

> and wandered without fixed abode till one of their number devised a

> heaviest rain would drop off their head. . . .”45

One notes that such stories existed before Darwin’s theory of evolution or
any hints of current concept of cosmology such as those expounded by
Hawking (A Brief History o f Time) where the universe began as a “big

consider either the number or the age o f the other planets” (Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings from
the Writings o f Bahá u ’lláh, p 163).

bang” billions of years ago and the solar system was formed from the dust
of space much later.46 This is not to imply that the Chinese created the
theory of evolution; only that their mythological tradition and literature
enabled them to fit in more easily with later and modem scientific
theories.

With regards to the gradual and systematically progressive nature of
creation, Abdu’l-Bahá himself suggests that creation unfolds in a
sequential manner. The BaháM view is unequivocal and clearer in the
assertion that evolution tended to produce higher and more complex
forms:

> “Then it is clear that original matter, which is in the embryonic state,
> and the mingled and composed elements which were its earliest forms,
> gradually grew and developed during many ages and cycles, passing
> from one shape and form to another, until they appeared in this
> perfection, this system, this organization and this establishment, though
> the. supreme wisdom of God.”47

4\. The Tao of Historical Perspective

The way the Chinese viewed their own cultural, social, and religious
history was also directly influenced by the yin-yang paradigm. Basically a
holistic one, in which parts are viewed as integral to the whole, the yin-
yang cosmological perspective endowed the Chinese with the ability to
interpret events in a larger historical or geographical perspective than
would otherwise have been the case. Two areas will be examined to
illustrate this point: comparative religion and world unity.

In a perusal of Chinese history, one notices that religious conflict has been
less of an issue than in any other major culture,48 a situation due in part to
the yin-yang cosmological perspective. The presence of great religious
teachers at different periods of history among different peoples can be
likened to the Chinese saying that tributaries branching out from the same

river may start off at different points and times and bear different names,
but the water which each receives from its source does not vary. To the
Chinese, each religion has often been understood as a branch of the
educational system, and all founders and sages are but “teachers” of a
particular school.49 Although there have been occasional polemics and
religious persecution in China’s long history, the traditional attitude has
been generally one of tolerance rather than dogmatic discrimination and
ideological opposition. As the existence of strong Buddhist and Taoist
elements in Neo-Confucianism make plain, a willingness to embrace
different ideologies as complementary is characteristic of both Chinese
thought and East Asian thought in general. If there was persecution, it was
more often the result of struggles for power or recognition that a certain
religion was “better,” rather than a denial of essential truths of other
religions.50

This sense of wholeness has always led the Chinese mind towards the
sense of relativity of particulars within the universal totality, and it is not
surprising that the Chinese were among the first to envisage a future
society of world brotherhood and unity. Arnold Toynbee, a great
philosopher of history, included Chinese civilization among the five
survivors of a number of ancient and medieval civilizations that once
existed.51 He found that among these, the Chinese civilization was the
only one that aimed to eliminate war by establishing a world government
of Great Unity (or Great Harmony) guided by the humanistic precepts of
Confucius. While the search for an ideal Commonwealth has been a

and the founders o f religions “Chiao Tsu” - “Teaching Master.”
50 There was persecution in 845 AD where more than 4,600 large monasteries and 40,000
smaller ones were destroyed. The issues at work were basically political and economic;
e g., too many able-bodied men had joined monasteries and thus became unavailable for
agricultural production and army or labour conscription, or too much land belonged to
Buddhist churches and thus became tax-exempt. Significantly, confiscated images o f
bronze were made into currency, those o f iron into agricultural implements, those o f gold
and silver turned to the Treasury and images o f wood, clay and stone left untouched. So it
was never anti-religious. See Chew, Brothers and Sisters, p. 17.

the Middle East and North Africa, the Greek Orthodox Empire ranging from Greece to
Russia, and Western Christianity in Western Europe and America. See A. Toynbee, A
Study o f History.

feature of other civilizations,52 it was only in China that it formed part of
the psyche not just of the scholar class, but also of the common people.

Very early on, the Chinese people entertained the lofty thought of the
“pacification of the world” (^[pj, Ta-t’ung: “Universalism”), bringing to
mind ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s point that “the most important principle of divine
philosophy is the oneness of the world of humanity, the unity of
mankind.”53 Throughout the history of Chinese religion, such calls have
come from its charismatic leaders and visionary prophets. Confucius
dreamt of a united world, which he termed “the Great Unity” (Ta-
t’ung).54 He urged his disciples to strive to produce a paradise covering
the whole world. His ideas have been a motivating force for many
Chinese legislators, scholars, and authors, especially reformers and
revolutionaries such as Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Chinese
Republic in 1912.55 Another Chinese philosopher who was fascinated with
the utopian idea of the Great Unity was Mo-tzu (479-381 BC), who
developed a concept called “all-embracing love” (ípčfl, chien-ai), which
emphasized a love of all humankind rather than just the love of the family.
Then there was Mao Tse-tung, whose aim it was to establish the “Great
Harmony,” and although Mao was much influenced by Marx and Lenin
early in life, much of his philosophy is, interestingly, in tune with the
principles and attitudes of traditional Chinese philosophy.

While this kind of ideal, a united world characterized by world solidarity,
has not been in total keeping with actual practice, as reported in historical
accounts of European traders and diplomats who were more often
regarded as “barbarians” rather than as co-equals in the “Middle
Kingdom,” such isolated individual accounts, most of which occurred in
the time of Western imperial expansion, should be better interpreted in the
context Of the existing political-social situation and do not represent the
essential spirit of Chinese thought.

52 Plato’s Republic is for example, a model for many. A utopian island also occurs in the
Sacred History o f Eluthemerus (c. 300 BC). In addition, there is the story o f Atlantis
which has inspired many utopian legends.
53 Abdu’l Bahá, Promulgation o f Universal Peace, p 31.
54 The term “Ta-t’ung” has been interpreted as “The Great Commonwealth,” “The Great
Harmony,” “One World System,” etc. “The Great Unity” is another such translation.
55 See, for example, Chew, The Chinese Religion, p 74.

5\. The Tao of Man and Woman

Man and woman, like yang and yin, are an example of the creative and
complementary forces which when in complete balance result in harmony
and prosperity. In the                        I Ching, there are many references t
relations in both verbal and nonverbal symbols. The book begins with the
two hexagrams “Ch’ien” and “K’un,” which stand for heaven and earth,
yang and yin, male and female. Part II of the book also begins with
reference to male and female. Hexagram 31, “Hsien,” depicting a lake
above a mountain, refers to the mutual influence and attraction between
the two natural forces. One cannot do without the other.56 Thus, although
heaven is spoken of as the powerful male force and earth as the weak
female force, the two are actually equal, for one cannot exist without the
other. In other words, Heaven can accomplish nothing unless Earth
responds. Ontologically, they form a unity and are therefore equal.

Interestingly, in one of his tablets, ‘Abdu'1-Bahá explains the story of
Adam and Eve as a metaphor for the active force and its recipient:

> “Adam signifieth that reality which is pervasive, effulgent and active,
> that is the manifestation of God’s names and attributes, and the
> evidences of His mercy. Whereas Eve is that reality which is the seeker
> and the recipient of the force, the grace, the message and the
> influence—that reality which receiveth the impact of all God’s Names
> and Attributes.”57

This might be said to be related to the two principles inherent in the
Primal Will mentioned by Bahá’u’lláh as “al-fa’il”, the active force, and
“al-munfa’il,” its recipient.58

However, while yin has been associated with the feminine and yang with
the masculine, this should be interpreted as a means of exemplifying a
polarity of abstractions such as that between “night” and “day” and “hot”
and “cold.” They do not represent the female or male sex in actuality but
rather serve to illustrate the notion of polarity. As a case in point, all

See Rosemont, Early Chinese Cosmology, and also the I Ching.

57 Nakhjavani, Response, p 72.
58 See section in this article on “The Tao o f Creation.”

people, whether male or female, go through yin and yang phases, and the
personality of each man and woman is not a static entity but a dynamic
phenomenon resulting from the play between masculine and feminine
phenomena. This is a theory that also serves to delineate different stages
in life, each with its own different needs and tasks, advantages and
disadvantages. The first half of life, led by yang, is a time of
differentiation, during which we understand ourselves and the world by
dividing it into pieces. The second half is characterized by yin or the
tendency to make whole, to see and experience the connections between
things, to replace separateness with harmony.

However, through the historical passage of time, this concept has been
developed to establish a rigid order in which men were supposed to be
completely masculine and women completely feminine. The patriarchal
bias also saw yin and yang become associated with moral values, and the
correlates were subsequently used to explain the polarity of light and
darkness, and good and bad. Good deeds, for instance, stemmed from the
principle of yang, which through the passage of time represented
principles such as benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom and
faith, and which added to the spiritual bank of merit. Conversely, bad
deeds stemmed from the principles of yin and such principles as passion,
anger, sorrow, likes, dislikes, desires, and violence and anything that
caused punishment in the afterlife in the other world. Such an
interpretation was later symbolized into script so that the character for yin
([Sfj) originally meant the shady side of a slope and is associated with
qualities such as cold, rest, responsiveness, passivity, darkness, interiority,
downwardness and inwardness. On the other hand, the character for yang
(|50) stood for the sunny side of a slope and all that was bright and
creative.

Yin-yang cosmology was also utilized to portray prototypes of the human
social order, e.g., “The ruler is yang, the subject yin; the father is yang,
the son yin; the husband is yang, the wife yin.” Later, writers such as
Tung Chung-shu (179-104 BC), a major representative of the New Text
School (the Han Dynasty form of Confucianism which was heavily
influenced by the five phases and yin-yang theory), taught that “Heaven
has trust in the yang but not in the yin.”59 The patriarchal and patrilineal

\[59\] Bodde, “Harmony and Conflict,” p 619.

bias in Chinese culture therefore transformed the original theory by
elevating the yang principle at the expense of the yin. Not surprisingly,
practices such as female infanticide, footbinding, and the sale of daughters
have shown the status of women in traditional Chinese societies to be
unenviable. The I Ching itself has also contributed to this imbalance.

The patriarchal bias to equate yin with passivity and yang with activity is
also evident in Western culture. The attempt to portray women as passive
and receptive, and men as active and creative goes back to Aristotle’s
theory of sexuality and has been used throughout the centuries as a
“scientific” rationale for keeping women in a subordinate role, subservient
to men. Of course, the understanding of yin as passivity is not itself a
problem. What is problematic is when passivity comes to be viewed as
undesirable. The whole point of Lao-tzu’s teachings, in this respect, is to
point out the artificiality of such value distinction.

Interestingly, in Bahá’í scripture, the feminine principle is depicted as an
active one, which creates, empowers, rears, and nourishes. It is not a fixed
condition of sexuality applied to objects in the created world. Mothering
images, for example, are used to suggest the divine creative principle of
the word of God:

> “Every single letter proceeding out of the mouth of God is indeed a
> Mother Letter, and every word uttered by Him Who is the Well Spring
> of Divine Revelation is a Mother Word, and His Tablet a Mother
> Tablet.”60

Such mothering images are used to suggest the divine creative principle of
the Word of God. Bahá’u’lláh himself identifies the feminine powers of
God with the word “Fashioner”:

> “No sooner is this resplendent word uttered, than its animating
> energies, stirring within all created things, give birth to the means and
> instruments whereby such arts can be produced and perfected. All the
> wondrous achievements ye now witness are the direct consequences of
> the Revelation of this Name.”61

<>() Baha’u’l^h, Gleanings from the Writings o f Bahá 'u 'lláh, p 142.
01 Ibid.

The theme of masculine-feminine complementarity and interaction is
manifested in the Tablet o f Carmel.62 Drewek refers to this tablet as an
instance of the divine dramatization of two forces coming together, the
Ancient of Days as the Manifestation and a feminine personification of
the Mountain of God, the Queen of Carmel, the site of the Manifestation’s
holy seat or throne. She describes a kind of courtship dance with feelings
of separation and longing for reunion followed by a kind of
consummation between heaven and earth. This consummation results in
the appearance of “the people of Bahá.”

It does appear then that Eve’s role as a symbol of the “shadowy” yin is
now discarded in the light of the Bahá’í revelation. In a long-awaited
reunion, the feminine principle is now ready to shift from a competitive to
a complementary opposite. For Bahá’ís then, harmony does not mean a
blurring of difference or a merging of the two into one in which both
natures are sacrificed. On the contrary, following the original spirit of
yim-yang, it signifies the combination of the two different parts to produce
an aesthetically satisfying whole.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá has explained the concept of complementarity in a manner
reminiscent of the yin-yang principle:

> “The world of humanity consists of two parts: male and female. Each
> is the complement of the other. Therefore if one is defective, the other
> will necessarily be incomplete and perfection cannot be attained. . . .
> Just as physical accomplishment is complete with two hands, so man
> and woman, the two parts of the social body, must be perfect. It is not
> natural that either should remain undeveloped; and until both are
> perfected, the happiness of the human world will not be realized.”63

He also compares society to a bird with two wings: “The world of
humanity is possessed of two wings: the male and female. So long as
these two wings are not equivalent in strength, the bird will not fly.”64
This is an image which echoes Lao-tzu’s teachings 2,500 years ago:

62 See Drewek, “Feminine Forms o f the Divine,” p 18.
63 Abdu’l Bahá, Promulgation o f Universal Peace , p 134.
64 Ibid., p 375.

> “Know the masculine;

> To be beneath-heaven’s ravine

> Know the white; [yang]

> Be beneath-heaven’s model.
> To be beneath-heaven’s model
> Is to stay with unerring virtue
> And return to the limitless.”65

It is impossible to read the above (and indeed the Tao-te Ching in its
entirety) without realizing where Lao-tzu, living in a patriarchal age,
placed his true priorities. Replete with yin symbols, it teaches that the
sage should adopt the yin qualities. Balance is once again stressed as the
essential condition for harmony. If so, the equality between men and
women is subtly raised.66 As a modem interpretation of the Tao-te Ching
puts it: “Full Balance is equal mind and body, equal woman and man. To
realize the Tao, both feet must dance.”67

6\. The Tao of Health and Healing

Imbued with the principles of yin-yang cosmology, Chinese medical
theory, like its scientific, historical, and social theories, is based on the
logic which assumes that a part can be understood only in its relation to
the whole. It is a logic that is always organic or synthetic, attempting to

65 Tao-te Ching , ch. 28
66 Similarly, while Confucius did not have much to say directly about women-men
relationships, it must be remembered that he placed great emphasis on being humane and
contributed to basic human rights with his depiction o f the superior person, the
development o f the original concept o f “jen” (“every man can cultivate his nature into
loving man and embracing all men with benevolence"), his belief in the original goodness
o f human beings, his teachings on love and the golden rule. Women are included in the
Chinese concept o f “jen" or “person."
07 Grigg, The Tao o f Relationships, p 219.

organize symptoms into understandable configurations. Just as in the
question of the creation of the universe, the question of cause and effect is
always secondary to the overall pattern, so in Chinese medicine, it is not
so much what x is causing to y, but rather, what the relationship of x to y
is. A symptom, therefore is not traced back to a cause but is looked at as
part of a totality. If a person displays a certain symptom, Chinese
medicine wishes to discover how the symptom fits into that person’s
entire bodily pattern. A person who is well or “in harmony” has no
distressing symptoms and expresses mental, physical, and spiritual
balance. When the person is ill, the distressing symptom is only one part
of a complete bodily imbalance that can be seen in other aspects of his or
her life and behaviour.

In contrast, Western medicine, in keeping with the Western penchant for
cause and effect, is concerned with isolatable disease categories or agents
of disease, which it isolates and tries to change, control, or destroy. The
physician usually starts with a symptom, then searches for an underlying
mechanism that may be a possible cause for a disease. Although the
disease may affect various parts of the body, it is a relatively well-defined
self-contained phenomenon. Precise diagnosis frames an exact,
quantifiable description of the illness, and a cause is then isolated.68

The basic premise on which Chinese medicine is based and its orientation
in finding imbalances and “righting” them, makes it a likely preliminary
basis to what BaháTs believe will be the healing methods of the future.
4Abdu’l-Bahá explains:

> “The outer, physical causal factor in disease, however, is a disturbance
> in the balance, the proportionate equilibrium of all those elements of
> which the human body is composed. To illustrate: the body of man is a
> compound of many constituent substances, each component being
> present in a prescribed amount, contributing to the essential
> equilibrium of the whole. So long as these constituents remain in their
> due proportion, according to the natural balance of the whole—that is,
> no component suffereth a change in its natural proportionate degree

68 Edward and Bouchier, Davidson’s Principles and Practice o f Medicine.

> and balance, no component being augmented or decreased—there will
> be no physical cause for the incursion of disease.”69

According to Chinese medicine, biological rhythms get out of
synchronization when there has been some violation of natural law, such
as the practice of harmful habits, repression of emotions, or incorrect diet.
Imbalance will result in diminishment or cessation of the “ch’i,” a force or
energy which may be equivalent to what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá calls the “mind
force”:

> “The mind force—whether we call it pre-existent or contingent—doth
> direct and coordinate all the members of the human body, seeing to it
> that each part member duly performeth its own special function. If
> however, there be some interruption in the power of the mind, all the
> members will fail to carry out their essential functions, deficiencies
> will appear in the body and the functioning of its members, and the
> power will prove ineffective.”7071

In line with the principles of yin-yang, it is believed that ill health is not
only a result of imbalance within parts of the body or of disharmony
between the mind and the body but also something that can be brought
about by an imbalance between the individual and the environment. The
Yellow Emperor's Classic (Inner Classic or the Huang-di Neijing),1] the
source of all Chinese medical theory, the Chinese equivalent of the
Hippocratic corpus, taught that the winds and seasons have marked effects
on the human body, certain physical conditions being the response to
terrestrial forces. The Inner Classic maintained that it was crucial for
human beings to act in accordance with the seasons so as to avoid
disharmony, for each person breathes the breath of the universe, tastes its
atmosphere, and reflects its rhythm. Interestingly, modem medicine is
now beginning to investigate the effect of atmospheric and meteorological
conditions on the human organism, and it has been shown that the number
of breaths each person draws varies according to the time of the year.
Much like animals and insects (although less immediately apparent),
human beings also respond to a circadian rhythm of sunlight. Humans

also experience annual rhythms, and these have been observed in regular
changes of bodyweight as well as in seasonal hair loss. cAbdu’l-Bahá
explains this theory of interrelatedness:

> “For all beings are connected together like a chain; and reciprocal help,
> assistance and interaction belonging to the properties of things are the
> causes of the existence, development and growth of created beings. It
> is confirmed through evidences and proofs that every being universally

Since the primary objective of Chinese medicine is to restore the balance
in the body and since each body is different, individualized treatment
therefore becomes one of its distinguishing features.73 Treatment is
tailored to the needs of the individual so as to maximize immunity to
diseases and to achieve balance. Here, the Chinese physician directs his or
her attention to the complete physiological and psychological individual.
This diagnostic technique does not turn up a specific disease entity or a
precise cause, but, rather, renders an almost poetic, yet workable,
description of the whole person. The therapy then attempts to bring the
configuration into balance, to restore harmony to the individual. In an
attempt to discover a pattern of imbalance or disharmony in a patient’s
body, all relevant information, including the symptoms as well as the
patient’s other general characteristics, are gathered and woven together.

The validity of individualized treatment of a patient, rather than the
uniform treatment of a disease, is acknowledged by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

> “The skillful physician does not give the same medicine to cure each
> disease and each malady, but he changes remedies and medicines
> according to the different necessities of the disease and constitution.”74

While the Yellow Emperor's Classic dealt with acupuncture, moxibustion,
and surgery as means of restoring balance, one major way in which much
healing is done is through herbal medicine or food. The Chinese have thus
developed a complex classification of foods according to the yin-yang
principle. Classification ranges from cold and cooling, to neutral, to

72 ‘AbduM-Bahá, Some Answered Questions , p 178-79.
73 Individualized treatment is also a distinctive feature in Ayurvedic medicine.
74 Abdu’l Bahá, Some Answered Questions , p 94.

warming and hot.75 Things are also classified not only directly as yin or
yang in nature but also relative to each other. Seaweeds, for example, are
yin because they are passive plants that grow in the sea. Fish might also
be considered yin because they live in the sea, but compared to seaweed,
they are classified as yang because they are active animals.

The importance of food as a means of curing illnesses is referred to often
in the Bahá’í scriptures:

> “When highly-skilled physicians shall fully examine this thoroughly
> and perseveringly, it will be clearly seen that the incursion of disease is
> due to a disturbance in the relative amounts of the body’s component
> substances, and that treatment consisteth in adjusting these relative
> amounts, and that this can be apprehended and made possible by
> means of foods.”76

Because “medical science appears to be in its infancy,”77 not least because
many major diseases are treated primarily by invasive surgery, Bahá'is are
encouraged to “develop the science of medicine to such a high degree that
they will heal illnesses by means of foods.”78 While it will necessarily
take some time before the emergence of such a medical paradigm, in the
meantime Bahá’is are advised to refer to qualified doctors and submit to
current medical opinion.

Despite some promising similarities between Chinese and Bahá’1
perceptions of health and healing, there is one essential difference—for
the Bahá’í, while medical treatment and a skilled doctor may cure a
patient, the actual healer is really God.79 For the Chinese, this is not so
much a relevant point in the practice of healing. What the ultimate cause
of healing is is not as important as the fact that the patient is healed. In

75 In general, foods which grow or live in ponds, lakes, streams, rivers, seas and oceans are
colder or more cooling than those which grow on land. Watercress, seaweeds, fish and all
kinds o f seafood, e.g., have cold or cooling natures, while carrots, leeks, eggs, chicken and
red meats have warming or hot natures. The natures o f all foods can be changed by the
way they are cooked. If watercress is stir-fried for example, it is less cooling than when it
is boiled in a soup. And when chicken is steamed it is less “heating” than when it is grilled.

Chinese medicine, there is also less emphasis on the spiritual or prayerful
aspect of healing.80

7\. Conclusion

The four principles inherent in yin-yang cosmology—relativity, unity,
complementarity, and balance—have gone a long way in influencing
Chinese ideas where the origin of creation, the nature of history, the
relationship between men and women, and health and healing are
concerned. What is of significance to us in this dialogue is the conceptual
similarity of these principles in relation to the Bahá’í Faith despite its birth
separate in time and place. In both the Chinese cosmological worldview
and the Bahá'í Faith, the idea of the Unknowability of the Creator and the
gradual development of life on earth is present. In addition, while
attempting to explain the process of creation, the Bahá'í Faith postulates
two poles and four elements of creation, the former being similar in spirit
to the yin and yang, while the latter is not unlike the Chinese “five
phases.” Yin-yang concepts have also endowed the Chinese with a
capacity to interpret events in a larger historical or geographical
perspective in terms of comparative religion and world unity and this
viewpoint has much in synchrony with the Bahá'í Faith. Again in both
worldviews, the relationship between the sexes, yin and yang, are
represented symbolically as creative forces which when in complete
balance result in harmony and prosperity. Ontologically, both male and
female are viewed as forming a unity and are therefore equal and
complementary. Last but not least, yin-yang cosmology has left its mark
on Chinese medicinal theory which is based on the premise of finding
imbalances and “righting” them. In this perspective, it is similar to what
Bahá'ís believe will be the healing methods of the future. One can only
conclude from this preliminary dialogue that despite the chasm of time
and space which separates the origins of the Chinese cosmological
worldview and the Bahá'í Faith, the conceptual affiliation of many key
principles is striking and merits further investigation.

80 On the popular level, however, many believed that diseases were caused by sins or
visitations.

Future research is needed to investigate the significant correlation of the
principles and spirit of the Bahá'í Faith with traditional paradigms of
thinking in Chinese culture. The multifarious theories of causation and
evolution and relationships between all created things in the universe in
Chinese philosophical thought, the theoretical relationship between man
and women and its practical application in Chinese philosophy and
literary texts, the principle of unity in ordering political and social life,
and last but not least, a more detailed systematic examination of the
intricate correlation between Chinese and Bahá'í medical principles are all
vital, timely and relevant areas of detailed study for future scholars.

Meanwhile, the yin-yang paradigm remains a useful one to explain
cultural imbalance as we stand on the threshold of the millennium. In the
past, yang has been favoured over yin, and the present world seems to
have reached a point of great imbalance in social, ecological, moral, and
spiritual terms. Despite having given birth to the yin-yang theory, a
completing rather than a competing theory, present-day China is also not
spared from a disjointed view of human life, which attempts to divorce
faith from reason and which has departed from the traditional attitude of
tolerance to one of dogmatic discrimination and ideological opposition, an
extremely yang condition.

Nevertheless, the fact that we are witnessing the beginning of a “New
Age” seems to illustrate the idea that yang, having reached its peak, is
now in retreat. Among the laws governing change and nature for the
Chinese, the most fundamental is, after all, that which states, “When a
thing reaches one extreme, it reverts from it.”81 “New age” ideas are
gaining popularity, and there is, for instance, a rising concern with
ecology, a strong interest in mysticism, a growing feminine awareness,
and a rediscovery of holistic approaches to health and healing.82

81 See Rene Wadlow, “Are we on the threshold o f a New Age?” Light Voices, 4, 2, 1999,
pp. 7-8. In addition, there are common Chinese sayings, which may be derived from Lao-
tzu: “Returning is the motion o f Tao,” and, “To be far is to return.” The idea is that if
anything develops certain extreme qualities, those qualities invariably change into their
opposites.
82 See Rene Wadlow, “Are we on the threshold o f a New Age?” Light Voices, 4, 2, 1999,
pp. 7-8.

‘Abdiťl-Bahá elucidated on this phenomenon when he said, at the
beginning of this century, that the “new age” will be “an age in which the
masculine and feminine elements of civilization will be more properly
balanced.” While the world in the past has been ruled by force, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá says, the balance is already shifting and force appears to be losing
its dominance to mental alertness, intuition, and the spiritual qualities of
love and service: “Hence the new age will be an age less masculine and
more permeated with the feminine ideals, or, to speak more exactly, will
be an age in which the masculine and feminine elements of civilization
will be more evenly balanced.”83

A fundamental renewal of society thus appears to be gradually taking
place. The pendulum of balance appears to be at work. The Mean is once
again seen as an attractive standard. The writings of Bahá’u’lláh affirm
that the new world order is being built, one characterized by the
unification of the planet into one commonwealth; and by the reunification,
we may say, of the yin and yang principles as equal co-partners in the
world of existence, united in the principle of the Tao, the life-giving
power.

This time in world history appears to be a watershed era, marked by
radical shifts in viewpoints. The world is being inexorably transformed
into a global society in which many different cultures and peoples are
coming together; often for the first time. Little wonder then that the first
year of the new millennium has been termed as the year of “Dialogue
among Civilizations” by the United Nations. There is a recognition that
bridges need to be built between different traditions and that each holds an
aspect of truth. Bahá’i revelation is little researched but it is vital to go
into depth in such research to get a fuller appreciation of Bahá'í teachings.
Likewise* the Chinese contributions to an alternative psychological
viewpoint and scientific tradition have been overlooked by Eurocentric
scientific views. Once the value of dialogue is widely accepted, it is likely
that different psychological and scientific traditions will be able to learn
and benefit from each other. No civilization is distinct or self-contained
and connections are remarkably plenteous if one looks for them. The
Chinese civilization has had its ups and downs, its highs and lows, its yin
and yang phases; yet its ancient precepts remain embedded in the psyche

83 J. E. Esslemont, Bahá u ’lláh and the New Era , p 149.

of its people and remain relevant for discussion today. While there is no
Bahá'i civilization as yet, Bahá'ís themselves believe there will be one in
the future and feel that dialogue regarding such a civilization is
meaningful. Even at this initial point in time, similarities can be discerned
as we take our first steps towards the Chinese-Bahá'í dialogue on the
origin of matter, the nature of history, male-female relationships, and
health and healing.
