> **Abstract:** The Bahá'í Writings promise an ethical renewal for all the peoples and cultures in the world and ethical guidance for the future personal, social and spiritual evolution of humankind. This paper pursues a philosophical examination of the Writings' ethical teachings, how they relate to the major ethical systems proposed in the past, and how they deal with some of the difficulties inherent in past systems. Among the topics discussed are virtue ethics, utilitarianism, existentialism, Kant's theories, natural law theory, ethical subjectivism and objectivism, relativism, intuitionism, Nietzschean ethics, and self-realization ethics. Special attention will be paid to Udo Schaefer's magisterial two volume "Bahá'í Ethics in Light of Scripture" which was the first study to undertake a systematic review of Bahá'í ethical teachings.

 The Bahá’í Writings: A Meta-ethical Excursion

Part I: Background and a First Dive into the Writings

Ian Kluge

1\. Preface

This paper is part of an on-going project of studying the
philosophic principles explicitly and implicitly embedded in the
Bahá’í Writings and correlating them with other religions
and/or philosophies. Shoghi Effendi recognized the necessity of
such correlation work as early as 1933,1 when he wrote,

> It is hoped that all the Bahá’í students will follow the
> noble example you have set before them and will,
> henceforth, be led to investigate and analyse the
> principles of the Faith and to correlate them with the
> modern aspects of philosophy and science. Every
> intelligent and thoughtful young Bahá’í should always
> approach the Cause in this way, for therein lies the very
> essence of the principle of independent investigation of
> truth.2

In this statement, Shoghi Effendi not only asserts the
importance of correlating philosophy with the Writings, but
also provides a reason why such work is necessary. It is essential
to one of the cardinal principles of the Bahá’í Faith viz. the
independent investigation of truth, because comparing i.e.
finding explicit or implicit similarities and differences is
essential to all learning. This, in turn, helps us to understand the
Bahá’í Writings in greater depth and also to appreciate how far

94                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

the Bahá’í teachings extend into other systems of thought and
belief. Shoghi Effendi says,

> The Cause needs more Bahá’í scholars, people who not
> only are devoted to it and believe in it and are anxious
> to tell others about it, but also who have a deep grasp of
> the Teachings and their significance, and who can
> correlate its beliefs with the current thoughts and
> problems of the people of the world.3

Such correlation work is an important part of bringing the
Faith to the world’s attention. When people see that the
Writings are highly relevant and applicable to the inner psycho-
spiritual and outer economic, socio-political and cultural
problems of our time, they will be more open-minded and more
inclined to investigate the Writings further. Correlating the
Writings to contemporary intellectual and religious currents is a
doorway to the Faith. Shoghi Effendi’s encouragement of
correlation studies is designed to encourage us to open more
such doorways:

> Shoghi Effendi has for years urged the Bahá’ís (who
> asked his advice, and in general also) to study history,
> economics, sociology, etc., in order to be au courant
> with all the progressive movements and thoughts being
> put forth today, and so that they could correlate these to
> the Bahá’í teachings.4

My on-going correlation studies aim at improving our
philosophic understanding of the Bahá’í Writings and their
relation to other systems of belief and/or thought. A
philosophic understanding of the Writings must, of course, base
itself on the Writings themselves and take them as the standard
of truth. As Bahá’u’lláh says,

> Weigh not the Book of God with such standards and
> sciences as are current amongst you, for the Book itself
A Meta-Ethical Excursion: Part 1                              95

> is the unerring Balance established amongst men. [ESW
> 128]

The philosophic approach seeks to understand the Writings
on the basis of the philosophic ideas explicitly and implicitly
present in the Texts themselves. It also examines the philosophic
language and terminology embedded in the Writings. Such
understanding seeks to discover what the Writings say or imply
about topics such as metaphysics, ontology, epistemology,
ethics, philosophy of man, philosophy of history and political
and social philosophy. It aims at elucidating the foundational
principles which underlie and inform or shape the teachings on
these (and other) subjects. The fact that the Writings have so
much to say about these subjects encourages this approach.

The first and most obvious advantage of the philosophic
approach is that it facilitates in-depth engagement with the
divine Texts by training our minds in such essential skills as
questioning, analysis, logic, evaluation, drawing inferences and
identifying premises. This increases our understanding of the
Writings, especially in those frequently encountered passages
that are highly philosophical in nature such as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
argument for the immortality of the soul [SAQ 238] which reveals
more of its depth when approached philosophically. The
philosophical approach also helps us to identify the explicit and
hidden connections that shed light on the meaning of a text and
allow us to discern more of the underlying unity of the
Writings, i.e. their organic, interdependent structure. When
these implicit connections become evident we are better
prepared to see the wider range of topics to which the Writings
are relevant.

Understanding the Writings philosophically draws attention
to the enormous importance of reason in the Writings and,
thereby, demonstrates that reason and faith are not really in
conflict. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá makes this clear when he states, “Reason
is the first faculty of man, and the religion of God is in

96                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

harmony with it,” [PUP 231] and adds that humanity needs to
attain “reasoning faith.” [PUP 321] Furthermore, he states,

> If religious belief and doctrine is at variance with
> reason, it proceeds from the limited mind of man and
> not from God; therefore, it is unworthy of belief and
> not deserving of attention; the heart finds no rest in it,
> and real faith is impossible. How can man believe that
> which he knows to be opposed to reason? Is this
> possible? Can the heart accept that which reason denies?5

What is especially important here is the connection between
reason and the heart, suggesting that to win hearts, we must also
win minds. In a similar vein, he asks,

> How can man believe that which he knows to be
> opposed to reason? Is this possible? [PUP 231]

However, reason is not just necessary for “real faith” in the
heart, it is also necessary because “in this age “the peoples of the
world need the arguments of reason.” [SAQ 7] This leads to
another advantage of a philosophic understanding of the
Writings.

Bahá’u’lláh says we should “Be anxiously concerned with the
needs of the age [we] live in, and center [our] deliberations on
its exigencies and requirements.” [GWB CVI, 213] As we have seen
above, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that people today “need the arguments
of reason.” A philosophic approach to the Writings helps us
fulfill that need by increasing our ability to teach the Faith in a
clear and rational manner. Clear, rational explication of the
Writings makes them more attractive and persuasive because
well-reasoned explications provide facilitate understanding and
enhance credibility, especially in an age inclined to be very
critical of religions. Carefully reasoned presentations inspire
confidence in the teachings instead of perplexity and confusion.

A philosophic understanding of the Writings also facilitates
dialogue with other religions, especially those, that, like
Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism, have well
developed philosophical traditions of their own. Without such
understanding of the Bahá’í Writings, the opportunities for
dialogue with such partners will be limited because they cannot
be adequately understood without their philosophic aspects.
Exploring philosophical correlations with other religions and/or
systems of thought are also important teaching tools because
they strengthen Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation of the essential oneness
of all religions, especially if these correlations go below surface
similarities and deal with fundamental philosophic similarities.
For example, no religion takes matter simply at face value; all
invest the material world with an aspect that is super-natural or
extra-material which is not reducible to matter. This
fundamental unity shows that all religions are working from the
same or similar ontological premises.

Finally, a philosophic understanding of the Writings is also
essential for apologetics, for defending the Faith against
misrepresentations of the teachings. According to Abdu’l-Bahá,
“the possessor of knowledge ... should be the defender of his
faith.” [SDC 39] As the Faith becomes increasingly better known,
the importance of a rational, philosophically informed and
dignified defense of the teachings will grow.

2: Introduction

Ethics, the analysis and evaluation of the systems of
obligations by which people live or should live may be divided
into four aspects. The first, called normative ethics, considers
how we are obligated to act if we wish to be considered ‘moral’
according to an ethical code we and/or our society have
adopted. Sometimes they are called “theories of obligation.”6
Normative ethics are prescriptive, i.e. they tell us how to behave
either by issuing specific injunctions such as ‘Do not steal’ or
by prescribing a principle by which we must judge our

98                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

behaviors. One form of Kant’s categorical imperative, for
example, tells us that we must always treat other human beings
as ends-in-themselves and must never use them as a means or
tool to reach our own goals. While this statement does not
impose any specific action, it does provide a standard by which
we can judge whether our actions are moral or not. Using it, we
can develop a clearer understanding of what we ought to do or
what we ought to avoid.

The second aspect of ethics is descriptive ethics which is the
empirical study of how different cultures deal with particular
ethical issues. For example, while many Western and Far Eastern
cultures regard it as ‘moral’ to care for aged parents, the Inuit
of North America regard it as ethically meritorious to strangle
them or abandon them in the snow. Living in one of the
harshest environments on earth, they have adopted ‘survival
ethics’ which make group survival the standard of right and
wrong. Descriptive ethics remains strictly neutral and never
passes judgment about the moral worth of the actions it studies.
It all ethical system of equal worth.

The third aspect of ethics is applied ethics which examines
ethical issues in regards to specific problems such as civil
disobedience, privacy, physician assisted suicide and abortion.
Almost all areas of professional studies now involve some
examination of ethical problems. For example, doctors and
nurses receive courses in medical ethics; teachers in teaching
ethics; commerce students in commercial ethics and engineers in
engineering ethics. Each of these areas has gradually become a
specialty to itself and is often taught separately from
philosophy in colleges and universities.

The fourth aspect is meta-ethics which analyzes the nature of
ethics itself. Meta-ethics has little or nothing to say about
particular moral problems such as the lying or theft. Rather, it
is a second-order pursuit, i.e. it philosophizes about ethics by
examining the terminology and arguments used by ethicists and

A Meta-Ethical Excursion: Part 1                              99

by seeking to clarify the pre-suppositions implicit in various
moral positions. It explores such questions as

> o What is goodness and what are its properties?”;
o What pre-suppositions are necessary to establish an

ethical system?”;
> o Can there be objective moral facts?”;
> o Can moral claims have cross-cultural validity?”;
o Are moral judgment such as ‘good’ or ‘evil’ mind-

independent?”;
> o Are moral judgments based on emotions or intellect?”;
> o Can ethics be derived from nature?”
o Can ethics be separated from religion?”

Meta-ethics also examines the theories of reality, i.e. the
underlying assumptions about human nature and personhood as
well as the nature and purpose of society since all of these
influence our ethical views. The importance of these questions
and issues can be readily illustrated. If, for example, we assume
that humans are only physical processes, then it is difficult to
defend free-will and the attendant concepts of moral
responsibility for our acts. Without moral responsibility, it is
hard to make any sense of the concept of ethics or even justice
or social order. Nobody discusses the ethics of cars or sewing
machines. They just do what they do without any attributable
intent. (Of course a few philosophers espouse ‘compatibilism’
according to which “human actions can be caused, but still
free,”7 but ethicists tend to agree with Kant that this is
“wretched subterfuge”8 and “word jugglery.”9) Another example
of a meta-ethical question with enormous importance in today’s
globalized world is the issue of cross-cultural judgments. If we
assert that moral claims cannot have any cross-cultural validity,
i.e. that moral claims are not universal and only culture-
specific, then we cannot pass judgment on — and prohibit —

100                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

such cultural practices as female genital mutilation, persecution
of minority sexual orientations or persecution of certain ethnic
or religious groups. As we can see, meta-ethics touches on some
of the central issues of personal and collective existence.

Udo Schaefer’s magisterial two volume study Bahá’í Ethics in
Light of Scripture explores both the normative as well as some
of the meta-ethical issues in the Bahá’í Writings. Nonetheless,
despite Schaefer’s excellent work, there remain various
important meta-ethical subjects to be examined and correlated
with other ethical views. Consequently, this paper focuses
exclusively on the meta-ethical principles embedded in the
Writings.

The most obvious reason for doing so is to widen and deepen
our understanding of the ethics found in the Writings by
making us aware of the principles on which these ethics are
based. This, in turn, helps us correlate Bahá’í ethics with other
ethical schools and understand how Bahá’í ethics are similar and
different. Such knowledge creates opportunities for dialogue
with other religions and/or systems of thought in which
knowledge of the Faith can be spread. As we have already
discussed, such knowledge facilitates teaching work, inter-faith
dialogue as well as apologetics.

3: The Religious Foundationalism of Bahá’í Meta-ethics

Any study of Bahá’í meta-ethics must begin with the
realization that Bahá’í epistemology — including ethical
epistemology — exemplifies strong foundationalism, namely, the
view that all knowledge has a

> a two-tier structure: some instances of knowledge and
> justification are non-inferential or foundational; all
> other instances thereof are inferential and non-
> foundational in that they derive ultimately from
> foundational knowledge or justification ... radical
> [strong] foundationalism ... requires that foundational
A Meta-Ethical Excursion: Part 1                                 101

> beliefs be certain and able to guarantee the certainty of
> the non-foundational beliefs they support.10

In other words, knowledge “rests on a foundation of
indubitable beliefs from which further propositions can be
inferred to produce a superstructure of known truths.”11

The Writings are foundational insofar as the ethical teachings
are not deduced from any preceding human beliefs, premises,
experience or experiments but rather, are based the revelation
of the Manifestations of God. The Manifestations, of course,
are infallible and their teachings are true a priori insofar as they
do not depend on human experience or agreement for their
truthfulness. Rather, because the Manifestations are on a higher
plane of existence, they

> surround the essence and qualities of the creatures,
> transcend and contain existing realities and understand
> all things, therefore, Their knowledge is divine
> knowledge, and not acquired — that is to say, it is a holy
> bounty; it is a divine revelation. [SAQ 157]

However, this does not mean God’s ethical teachings cannot
be rationally explained a posteriori by gathering evidence to
support them and thereby making them intelligible in different
circumstances and cultures by using the “intelligence and reason
whereby [man] is required to determine the verity of questions
and propositions.” [PUP 181] Such explanations help to make the
ethical teachings more intelligible for humankind; they help
some people accept God’s will; they strengthen our own faith
and facilitate inter-faith dialogue. However, the intrinsic truth
of these teachings does not depend on such evidence. Only the
Manifestation can guarantee that.

The Manifestations have this power because, in Bahá’í
epistemology, higher beings can ‘surround’ or ‘comprehend’
lower ones [PUP 114; SAQ 146] and Manifestations are obviously
higher beings.

102                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

Since Their knowledge is a priori it, therefore, is certain. If
these truths depended on empirical research and evaluation, i.e.
if they were dependent on gathered evidence, the revealed
ethical teachings would run into the “induction problem” and,
therefore, could not be certain. With induction from
empirically gathered evidence we can never attain certainty
because there can never be any guarantee that we have collected
all the necessary evidence. Furthermore, because the higher
ontological position of the Manifestations is structural, i.e.
part of the structure of creation, the superiority — and
certainty — of Their knowledge is also a structural aspect of
creation. This makes foundationalism an integral and
inescapable aspect of Bahá’í ethical thinking. Consequently, in
the Bahá’í context, ethical thinking necessarily begins with
deductions from the principles taught by the Manifestations.
We may draw numerous inferences from these foundational
principles but must always ensure our inferences are in harmony
with the divine teachings which are the standard by which to
judge our conclusions.

Because of their foundationalism, the Bahá’í Writings assert
that there are absolute non-relative12 ethical standards, i.e. the
“eternal verities” [PDC 108] as Shoghi Effendi calls them, that are
not mind-dependent, are given by a transcendental non-human
agency, are universal in validity and obligatory on all humans.
Consequently, there are ethical truths that are suited to our
essential human nature both at the personal and collective level
and that correspond to or represent eternal, divine truths.

4\. The Three Foundation Stones

Bahá’í meta-ethics are built on three foundation stones:
metaphysics or the theory of reality; philosophical anthropology
or the theory of human nature; and the nature of the
Manifestations. The teachings on these three subjects shape
Bahá’í meta-ethics and, thereby, Bahá’í ethics. At some point or
another, Bahá’í meta-ethics and ethics are justified by reference

to one or all of these three foundations. They are the ‘first
premises’ of any deductions about ethics.

Metaphysics, the theory of reality, concerns itself with such
questions as,

> o What is the nature and structure of reality?
> o What kinds of things exist?
> o What is their nature?
> o How do they relate to each other?
> o Is matter all there is?
> o Are there non-material realities?
> o What is the ‘origin’ of the universe?
> o Does the universe have order?

o Is the universe teleological in nature or is it random?

Bahá’í metaphysics views reality as originating with God in a
process called “emanation” which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá likens to “the
coming forth of the action from the actor, of the writing from
the writer” [SAQ 205] as well as to the “appearance of the rays
from the luminary of the horizons [the sun].” [SAQ 202] These
metaphors are intended to make clear that the action of the
actor, the writer’s writing and the sun’s rays are all absolutely
dependent on their source for their existence and are also
essentially distinct from their source. We might also think of a
magnet and its surrounding magnetic field. Moreover, the
source is not diminished by what it emanates or changes its
condition in any way. [SAQ 205] We say “emanates” to
distinguish it from ‘manifestation’ in which “a single thing [the
source] appears in infinite forms,” [SAQ 294] like a seed
appearing in branches, leaves and flowers. The impact of this
teaching on meta-ethics is clear: because there is an absolute
source of creation Bahá’í meta-ethics must be some form of
cognitivism which implies that there are objective ethical

104                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

standards that can be known and constitute moral knowledge.
Ethics are not merely subjective.

Furthermore, reality has three parts. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that
“The Prophets ... believe that there is the world of God, the
world of the Kingdom, and the world of Creation: three
things.” [SAQ 295] The ultimate Source of everything is the
Divine or supernatural realm which as the absolutely
independent origin of all other things, is unaffected by time,
space and causality and is absolutely unrestricted His actions.
Because no one but Himself can impose limits on Him, the
Divine is absolutely free: “He doeth what He pleaseth, and
ordaineth what He willeth through the power of His
sovereignty.” [ESW 102] However, because God is absolutely free
does not necessarily mean He acts capriciously or without
reason (Shoghi Effendi refers to “the rational God” [WOB 112]),
or does not limit his powers. For example, humans have free will
to make moral choices — which means that God does not use
His power to compel the right choices even though He could.
Obviously, the Writings also assert the existence of non-
material realities, the inherent order and teleological nature of
creation and the dependence of all things on God.

At the other end of the ‘scale’ of being is the natural realm in
which space, time, causality are operative and, therefore,
freedom is limited to the spiritual or supernatural aspects of
human nature: “And among the teachings of His Holiness
Bahá’u’lláh is man’s freedom, that through the ideal power he
should be free and emancipated from the captivity of the world
of nature.”13 The purpose of humans is to free themselves from
the influences of the natural and to actualize their spiritual
potentialities to the fullest extent possible. Human nature is
therefore, teleological, a fact which is reflected in Bahá’í meta-
ethics and the normative ethics that grow out of them. It is also
important to note that human nature has two aspects:

> In man there are two natures; his spiritual or higher
> nature and his material or lower nature. In one he

> approaches God, in the other he lives for the world alone
> ... In his material aspect he expresses untruth, cruelty
> and injustice; all these are the outcome of his lower
> nature. The attributes of his Divine nature are shown
> forth in love, mercy, kindness, truth and justice, one and
> all being expressions of his higher nature... [PT 60]

Humanity’s double-nature which implies that to one degree
or another, we are always in conflict with ourselves, has
tremendous implications for Bahá’í meta-ethics not the least of
which is the endorsement of some forms of natural law theory.
We shall discuss this in detail below.

Rationality is another essential attribute of human nature
which must be taken into consideration in regards to ethics and
meta-ethics.

> The human spirit which distinguishes man from the
> animal is the rational soul, and these two names — the
> human spirit and the rational soul — designate one
> thing.14

Consequently, all revelations appeal to rationality though to
different degrees according to humankind’s stage of
development in the process of progressive revelation. The
extraordinary importance of the “human spirit” or “rational
soul” is emphasized by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s declaration that “the
spirit of man is the most noble of phenomena ... the meeting
between man and God.” [PUP 239] This assertion shows the
“rational soul” has a special place in phenomenal creation and
even a special spiritual status. From this we may infer that
rationality, as an essential attribute of the soul, holds an exalted
place the gifts bestowed upon humankind. Furthermore, Shoghi
Effendi’s intriguing reference to the “invisible yet rational
God” [WOB 112] also points to a close link between religion and
reason, though it should be remembered that the ‘rationality of
God’ is not assessable to human thought. We know from Shoghi

106                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

Effendi that God is rational, but as humans, we do not
necessarily understand that rationality.

Bridging the “world of God” and the “world of Creation” or
nature is what `Abdu’l-Bahá, calls “the Kingdom” i.e. the realm
of the Manifestations of which Bahá’u’lláh says,

> And since there can be no tie of direct intercourse to
> bind the one true God with His creation, and no
> resemblance whatever can exist between the transient
> and the Eternal, the contingent and the Absolute, He
> hath ordained that in every age and dispensation a pure
> and stainless Soul be made manifest in the kingdoms of
> earth and heaven. [GWB XXVII, 65]

The Manifestations reflect the creative power of God into the
world, and, therefore have a two-fold station:

> The Holy Manifestations of God possess two stations:
> one is the physical station, and one the spiritual. In other
> words, one station is that of a human being, and one, of
> the Divine Reality. If the Manifestations are subjected
> to tests, it is in Their human station only, not in the
> splendour of Their Divine Reality. [SWAB 55]

As we proceed through this paper we shall return to various
aspects of this three-fold nature of existence which shapes
Bahá’í meta-ethics.

5: Meta-ethics and Religion

One of the major questions in meta-ethics is whether or not
ethics depends on religion. Those philosophers who call
themselves secularists believe ethics is distinct and independent
from revelation and can rely on reason alone.15 Others,
however, such as Hume, believe that ethics is based on feeling
and community agreement rather than reason, though they still
agree that ethics and religion are not intrinsically connected.

From the foregoing discussions, it is clear that the ultimate
basis for Bahá’í meta-ethics is the supernatural or the
transcendent, i.e. God, Who, unlike creation, is not subject to
change, time, place or causality, Who is absolutely independent
of all other things and Who is absolutely free. The foundations
of ethics are not in the evolving empirical world observed by
the five senses which, by definition, exclude the non-material or
the transcendent as part of its explanations. Such views exclude
both God and personal soul. However, `Abdu’l-Bahá rejects
such total reliance on the empirical world, saying, “the circle
and range of perception by the five senses is exceedingly
limited,”16 since “whatever falleth not under the power of the
senses is either unreal or doubtful.” [TAF 7] In the Bahá’í view,
ethics cannot be separated from religion without being severely
diminished; indeed, ethics depends on religion, as we shall see
below, for its sustainability and coherence. Shoghi Effendi
supports the connection between religion and ethics by writing,

> The other statement reported to have been made by Dr.
> Einstein to the effect that the ethical behavior of man
> ‘requires no support from religion’ is incompatible with
> the Bahá’í viewpoint which emphatically stresses the fact
> that no sound ethics can exist and become effective
> unless based on revealed religion. To dissociate ethics
> from religion is to render the former not only void of
> any firm foundation but without the necessary driving
> power.17

It is important to note that Shoghi Effendi does not claim there
no ethics at all without revealed religion but rather that “no
sound ethics can exist and become effective unless based on
revealed religion.” Purely man-made ethics such as those offered
by Kant, Marx and Sartre are possible but they are ineffective
for a variety of reasons that will become apparent through this
paper.

There are at least two reasons why ethics depends on revealed
religion. First, it is difficult to see how ethics divorced from a

108                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

belief in God can provide consistent and coherent guidance on
the basis of a constantly changing empirical world in which
physical, social, economic, cultural and scientific change is
ubiquitous. The resulting inconsistent, incoherent and
frequently clashing ethical views result in either ethical
relativism which claims that ethical rules depend on culture as
well as other factors such as economics; or in skepticism in
which we can never justify any ethical belief; or in extreme
ethical nihilism, i.e. the denial of ethics altogether.18 Each of
these positions undermines its own effectiveness since each
makes internal consistency within itself and unity with others
difficult to achieve. If, for example, we cannot justify ethical
theories such as skepticism or error theory in which all ethical
teachings are false (see below), then societal agreement on moral
rules will be difficult if not impossible. Once seen as ‘arbitrary’
ethical rules have severely diminished power or “effectiveness.”

Second, it is obvious that reason alone cannot establish the
degree of social agreement needed to make an ethical system
effective in a society. As `Abdu’l-Bahá says about the rationalist
philosophers,

> They proved things by reason and held firmly to logical
> proofs; all their arguments are arguments of reason.
> Notwithstanding this, they differed greatly, and their
> opinions were contradictory. They even changed their
> views. [SAQ 296]

Such lack of consistency undermines the “effectiveness” of
ethics. As already noted in regards to basing ethics on empirical
data alone, basing it on reason alone leads to problems
regarding internal consistency and consequently, social
cohesion. This, in turn, undermines its effectiveness in ordering
society by influencing human behavior. This lack of a “firm
foundation” with reason rules out what Shoghi Effendi calls the
“eternal verities on which alone a stable and flourishing
civilization can be ultimately established.” [CF 125]

5\.1 Attempts to Separate Meta-Ethics and Religion

Immanuel Kant is one of the most famous philosophers to
maintain that ethics do not depend on religion. In his view,
reason alone is a sufficient foundation for ethics.

> for its own sake morality does not need religion at all
> (whether objectively, as regards willing, or subjectively,
> as regards ability [to act]); by virtue of pure practical
> reason it is self-sufficient.19

He also writes,

> So far as morality is based upon the conception of man
> as a free agent who, just because he is free, binds himself
> through his reason to unconditioned laws, it stands in
> need neither of the idea of another Being over him, for
> him to apprehend his duty, nor of an incentive other
> than the law itself, for him to do his duty. At least it is
> man’s own fault if he is subject to such a need; and if he
> is, this need can be relieved through nothing outside
> himself.20

Kant takes the view that reason is sufficient to guide us to
correct ethical action. In The Critique of Practical Reason he
finds a role for God as a “regulative principle” but this role,
which makes God ‘useful’ for morality, does not make ethics
depend on religion. Revelation is not necessary as long as
people adhere to rationality in their ethical deliberations.
Religion may be linked to ethics by fortuitous historical
circumstances but there is no necessary, i.e. logical connection
between the two. As we have seen above, from a Bahá’í
viewpoint, the problem with reliance on reason is highly
problematical.

A highly influential modern philosopher who believes ethics
do not rely on religion is the ethicist Peter Singer.21 For Singer,
ethics must be autonomous. One of Singer’s (and co-author

110                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

Hauser’s) proofs is that atheists and agnostics share all the
central moral principles of the major religion. Therefore,
“atheists and agnostics do not believe less morally than religious
believers.”22 In short, ‘Who needs religion?’ Their argument has
little to recommend it. No agnostics and atheists have ever lived
in a society without religion as the basis for morals.
Consequently, they internalized these religious teachings as
young children and young adults and retained them as valuable
even when they rejected the religious foundations. Having
absorbed these teachings from their childhood and seeing them
re-enforced in their dealings with other adults explains why the
seeming lack of religion does not affect their moral behavior:
the ethical teachings of religion have simply become part of
their social and mental makeup. It is highly improbable that
agnostics and atheists everywhere invented their own moralities
which, for the most part, just happened to coincide with
society’s highest religious teachings.

In seeking to disengage religion from ethics Singer and
Hauser also draw attention to the history of religious violence.
Religion is so violent that ethics cannot be — or should not be
— associated with it. Any association with religion undermines
the credibility of ethics. This argument is highly problematic.
First, it does not follow that because all wars in the past were
fought by people with religion that the wars were about
religion. Religious people can and have fought wars for
resources necessary for survival; for “lebensraum” and other
geographic advantages; or for strategic political reasons, or
even just ‘glory.’ The fact that the combatants were also
religious is accidental or fortuitous and not essential to the war
itself.23 Indeed, the number of wars fought specifically over
religion is quite small in the five thousand years of recorded
warfare. For example, very few if any wars in the ancient world
were fought over religion. Even the wars presented in the Old
Testament were not simply religious wars: they were wars about
land, i.e. “lebensraum” and security against hostile tribes.

Yahweh’s role in the Hebrew victories was essential but the wars
were not primarily about belief in Yahweh.

Singer and Hauser also try to disengage ethics from religion
by stating that moral rules are inherited responses from our
evolutionary past. In other words, morality has an evolutionary
not religious basis; humans are provided with a “moral faculty
that guides our intuitive judgments of right and wrong”24 on the
basis of what has contributed to survival in the past. However,
the most obvious question is whether biologically-based
responses or instincts are ‘ethics.’ Instincts are automatic
responses, i.e. they do not involve intentions — and the whole
purpose of ethics is to train or reform our intentions. The
instinct to eat is not an ethical decision — but the issue of when
we eat, and what and how much can be ethical issues.
Nevertheless, all of these are guided by intentions. Intentions do
not affect a mother’s biological drive to eat but they do affect
her decision to give her food to her child. In effect, the
‘evolutionary past’ theory of ethics is not really about ethics at
all because it leaves out the issue of ‘intention’ without which
any discussion about ethics is moot.

Two giants of twentieth century philosophy, A.J. Ayer and
Bertrand Russell, reject the view that ethics depends on religion.
Ayer states,

> I suspect that the widespread assumption that religious
> belief is necessary for the maintenance of moral
> standards arises not so much from any assessment of the
> empirical evidence as from a tacit or explicit acceptance
> of the proposition that if there is no God there is no
> reason to be moral.25

This, of course, was Dostoyevsky’s point when Ivan Karamzov
says, “If God does not exist, everything is permitted.”26 (This is
the most common paraphrase of the statement.) Ayer adds that
in the last analysis, “Moral standards can never be justified

112                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

merely by an appeal to authority.”27 This leaves us with the
question of how to justify moral laws.

Bertrand Russell builds his opposition to any connection
between ethics and religion on the principle that humans should
be autonomous and not subservient to any God or divine
revelation. Following divine commands is unworthy of us. He
pursues what we might call ‘the argument from autonomy’ and
even ‘the argument from pride.’ He writes,

> In this lies Man’s true freedom: in determination to
> worship only the God created by our own love for the
> good, to respect only the heaven which inspires the
> insight of our best moments.28

There is no intellectual argument here; rather, there is a ringing
declaration of independence and even a suggestion of defiance
against the very idea of a ‘God’ who is not of our manufacture.
Only in this way can humans retain autonomy in their ethical
lives. The underlying logical problem with Russell’s view is that
we cannot identify which of the man-made ‘Gods’ is really the
best and most inspirational since there is no non-human,
objective standard by which to judge. Further, from a Bahá’í
viewpoint, Russell’s view that we become the creators of God
means that declare ourselves God’s equals or superiors and,
thereby, “join partners” with Him, something which Bahá’u’lláh
explicitly forbids: “Beware, beware, lest thou be led to join
partners with the Lord, thy God.” [GWB XCIV, 192]

Elsewhere he elaborates,

> Science can teach us, and I think our own hearts can
> teach us, no longer to look round for imaginary
> supports, no longer to invent allies in the sky but rather
> to look to our own efforts.29

Here, too, Russell insists on human autonomy based on
science, “our own hearts” and “our own efforts.” But, of

course, there are problems with this view as we shall see shortly.
The insufficiency of “our own efforts” is precisely one of the
reasons why ethics need a religious foundation. The same may
be said about reliance on “our own hearts.” On this issues
`Abdu’l-Bahá:

> Inspirations are the promptings or susceptibilities of the
> human heart. The promptings of the heart are sometimes
> satanic. How are we to differentiate them? How are we
> to tell whether a given statement is an inspiration and
> prompting of the heart through the merciful assistance
> or through the satanic agency? [PUP 254]

Russell has no answer for this difficult challenge — yet, that is
precisely the question that needs to be answered for the heart to
be a trustworthy source of ethics and meta-ethics.

Relying on science also has insurmountable difficulties as
seen which we shall explore in one of the most recent efforts to
make science the basis of ethics, Sam Harris’s The Moral
Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values.
According to Harris,

> science can, in principle, help us understand what we
> should do and should want — and, therefore, what other
> people should do and want in order to live the best lives
> possible.30

Difficulties arise as soon as we ask how science can do this. In
the first place the scientific method, only studies phenomena
that

> o are physical/material
o are susceptible to empirical direct or indirect observation

by the humans senses or instruments
> o are measurable or quantifiable
> o are results of repeatable experiments or observations
114                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> o are observer independent
o are falsifiable, i.e. disprovable by observation and/or

experiment
This brings us to a simple question: ‘Can we solve moral
questions this way?’ How, for example, can we identify what we
“should want” as Harris claims? The scientific method is not
designed to deal with obligations, duties, prohibitions, good,
evil and other values.

Take, for example, the morality of feeding starving children.

We can measure necessary calorie and protein intakes; we can
measure results in survival rates, we can quantify all this
scientific data — but we can never use this method to prove that
we are morally obligated to feed these children. Moral
evaluations are not scientifically testable because moral values
are not physical, measurable, physically observable, observer
independent, objective or disprovable.’ No coroner’s report
will say that certain physical evidence shows the moral evil of
this death. The fact that they are starving is an empirical fact
but there is nothing in this fact itself that obligates us to do
anything for them. Such obligations must come from elsewhere
— but the question is, where? Harris frequently refers to brain-
scans — which not actually tell us which human brain activity is
good or evil. A positive scan may be correlated with acts of
kindness — in a Mother Teresa — or with acts of terror — in Dr.
Josef Mengele. The scan itself shows no preference. The
inescapable conclusion is that moral values are simply not
proper scientific objects, i.e. they are not suited to discovery or
exploration by the scientific method. In sum, there is no
intrinsic and necessary connection between ethics and science.

Curiously enough Harris admits as much: “Science cannot tell
us why, scientifically, we should value health.”31 In effect, he
concedes that science has nothing to say about moral valuations
or obligations and, thereby, he undermines his own thesis. If
“scientifically” speaking there is no reason to value something
as self-evidently important as health, then the there is not much

hope of building an ethical system — with all its complex
questions — on science alone. Because science and the scientific
method are irrelevant to ethical questions, it is impossible to
base meta-ethical principles and ethical rules on them.

To separate ethics from religion, Harris also tries to set aside
the ‘is-ought’ problem, claiming it as “another dismal product
of Abrahamic religion.”32 The modern formulation of this
difficulty came from David Hume who objected to the way
some moral treatises moved from an ‘is’ or ‘is not,’ i.e. from a
matter of fact to an ‘ought’ or ‘ought’ not, i.e. from an
empirical fact to a moral prescription.33 According to Hume —
and numerous other philosophers since then — a description of
facts cannot logically lead to moral prescriptions obligating us
to accept certain acts as ‘good.’ Violating the ‘is-ought’
distinction is precisely the error of social Darwinism which
believes that because we observe a struggle for existence in
nature, our society, which is embedded in nature, ought to be
modeled on this struggle. Yet this supposed obligation to
imitate the struggle for existence is not inherent in the facts
themselves; rather, it is something we bring or attach to the
facts externally.

According to Harris, once the ‘is-ought’ distinction is
removed, science can become a basis of value. In an effort to
show the intimate connection between ‘is’ and ‘ought’ or facts
and values, he says that even a truth-claim about the
composition of water appeals “to the values of empiricism and
logic.”34 This argument has two problems. First, if, as Harris
claims, there is no real distinction between fact and value or ‘is’
and ‘ought,’ then the values must be inherent in the facts i.e.
they must be empirically discoverable and meet the criteria of
being proper objects of scientific study. Values are self-
evidently not scientific insofar as they are non-physical and
cannot be quantified, are not material or physical, are not
objective and cannot be falsified or verified by
experimentation. In short, there is no reason to believe in
necessary, intrinsic, scientific or logical connections between

116                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

facts and values. It is we who make the decision to connect
them, i.e. it is our judgment, externally applied, that gives them
value and nothing else. Hume’s ‘is-ought’ distinction is valid —
at least for all non-theistic metaphysics and ontologies.

Second, the scientific or epistemological value assigned by
Harris to “empiricism and logic” is obviously a different kind
of value from the moral values discussed in meta-ethics and
ethics which concern judgments of right and wrong, good and
evil, as well as obligations and permissibility. The decision to
value scientifically based knowledge bears no significance
resemblance to such issues as child abuse or helping the poor to
alleviate their condition. Harris is comparing apples and
oranges. In what is really a desperate attempt to support his
case about against the ‘is-ought’ disjunction, he quotes Dennett
— a fellow believer in basing meta-ethics on science — who
writes, “If ‘ought’ cannot be derived from ‘is,’ just what can it
be derived from?”35

Dennett’s question is exactly the heart of the problem for
empiricists — if the empirical facts of nature cannot logically
serve as the foundation of morals, what can?

6\. Why Meta-ethics Needs a Religious Foundation

There are at least four major problems with any attempt to
establish a strictly empirical meta-ethics. The first of these is the
ubiquitous flux of creation. This leads to the old platonic
question applied to meta-ethical principles and the resulting
ethics: how can we actually know anything in a world that is
totally unstable? Meta-ethical principles must lead us to ethical
decisions that are not absolutely time-bound but are applicable
consistently throughout the passage of time though it may
appear in various external forms. The “golden rule,” for
example, has a variety of expressions, but the underlying
principle remains the same. Such constancy or stability, such
“eternal verities on which alone a stable and flourishing
civilization can be ultimately established,” [CF 125] are necessary

lest humans become ethically confused and lose their sense of
value, meaning and purpose and possibly even the wish and/or
will to be ethical. Therefore, we must conclude that ethical
systems which accept the limits of materialism or empiricism are
inherently deficient, i.e. incomplete and not adequately
grounded precisely because they cannot provide ethical
stability.

The second reason why divorcing ethics from religion is
problematical concerns the crucial meta-ethical is issue of
authority which in turn affects the “necessary driving power”36
of a civilization. Without rational and logically coherent
answers to questions of authority, no ethical system can be
securely grounded. There are two aspects to the authority issue
— legitimacy and power. Both are needed, and, as the following
discussion shall make clear, no empirical source can supply
them.

The first aspect of authority concerns ‘legitimacy,’ which
deals with the questions, ‘Who — if anyone — has the legitimacy
or the right to lay down moral principles and precepts for the
human race? Who or what — if anything — has the knowledge,
understanding and goodness necessary to legitimize a demand
for obedience? Who — or what — is inherently entitled to make
obedience a condition for attaining ‘rightness,’ or true value
and appropriate worth as a human being?’ It is virtually self-
evident that no human and no collection of human beings
inherently possess such legitimacy by virtue of their human
nature. The reasons are obvious: humans are fallible, are fickle,
have personal interests, lack absolute independence from all
things, i.e. are susceptible to outside influence, interference and
coercion. Thus, humans cannot guarantee objectivity and
justice. They also lack the unlimited knowledge needed to
dispense perfect justice, understanding and compassion.
Another problem is that strictly empirical knowledge gives no
evidence to establish one definitive standard by which to judge
various ethical claims. On strictly empirical bases, the only way
to establish a decisive standard of ethics is by social or political

118                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

convention, or by force. However, this is not the ethical
legitimacy we seek but rather political, social or legal
legitimacy. God, on the other hand, is not only unaffected by
the aforementioned deficiencies, but He is also the actual maker
of the world and the nature of everything in it. Given His
knowledge, it is difficult to imagine who else could have
genuine ethical legitimacy since His knowledge is the only
reliable guide to ‘the good.’

The second aspect of authority is the question of power.

Without legitimacy, power is tyranny and forceful enslavement
but without power, legitimacy remains purely theoretical, i.e.
impotent. Thus, to see how legitimacy is actually put into
practice we must ask ‘Who — if anyone — has the power
necessary to enable people to follow these rules despite their
short-comings and weaknesses?’ ‘Who — if anyone — has the
power to impose His will and His ethical judgments on
humankind? Who — if anyone — can impose both obligations or
laws and consequences for committed or omitted acts? Here,
too, theistic and non-theistic meta-ethical systems part company
since the former believe that only God can adequately fulfill
that role. God has the power, i.e. is omnipotent and has the
legitimacy to rule humankind. God-substitutes such as
governments, priesthoods or ideologies lack this power because
they are subject to the vicissitudes of ubiquitous change and
they lack the legitimacy and the power to make their ethical
requirements effective. Inherent human limitations prevent this.

The third aspect of authority is ‘universality.’ Here, the most
fundamental question is, ‘Is there such a thing as a universal
human nature?’ Answering this will tell us whether the limits of
authority are defined by time, culture, economics or political
ideology. The Bahá’í Writings answer this question
affirmatively. Moreover, they show that a universal ethical
standard follows from a universal human nature. One of their
key principles is the essential oneness of humankind:

> When we observe the human world, we find various
> collective expressions of unity therein. For instance,
> man is distinguished from the animal by his degree, or
> kingdom. This comprehensive distinction includes all the
> posterity of Adam and constitutes one great household
> or human family, which may be considered the
> fundamental or physical unity of mankind.37

God has created human nature as it is, and the teaching of the
oneness of humankind affirms that this nature is universal even
though different cultures may actualize different aspects at
different times. The teaching of the oneness of humankind
starts with the “physical unity of mankind.” Furthermore, all
humans possess a “human spirit which distinguishes man from
the animal [this] is the rational soul, and these two names — the
human spirit and the rational soul — designate one thing.” [SAQ
208] Regardless of culture, time, place or circumstance, all
people share one human nature because they have a rational
soul. We also share a higher, spiritual nature and a lower animal
nature which the higher nature must control. [SAQ 118] In
addition, we all posses “spiritual susceptibilities” [PUP 339]
which must be cultivated in order to make spiritual progress
possible. Since there is a universal human nature, then it
logically follows that a universal ethic is possible, i.e. at least
some ethical rules apply to everyone at all times and in all
places. Since God is the creator of human nature, no one is
better qualified than God to establish what this ethic is.
Consequently, there are ethical standards valid across all
cultures, places, times and circumstances and that cross-cultural
moral judgments are possible. Shoghi Effendi writes,

> He [Bahá’u’lláh] insists on the unqualified recognition
> of the unity of their purpose, restates the eternal verities
> they enshrine, coordinates their functions, distinguishes
> the essential and the authentic from the nonessential and
> spurious in their teachings, separates the God-given
> truths from the priest-prompted superstitions, and on
120                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> this as a basis proclaims the possibility, and even
> prophecies the inevitability, of their unification, and the
> consummation of their highest hopes.38

The core of this statement is that Bahá’u’lláh “restate[d] the
eternal verities” which means (1) that certain truths — including
ethical truths — are not bound to one time and (2) that these
“verities” which Bahá’u’lláh “restated” are the same as those
taught by previous Manifestations in other times and places. In
effect, Shoghi Effendi confirms a meta-ethical perennialism for
those morals that are not “priest-prompted superstitions” and
“nonessential and spurious.” His dismissive description of those
religious teachings that deviate from the “eternal verities”
clearly de-legitimates them. The underlying assumption is that
the “eternal verities” are suited to a universal human nature and
what is best therein. This suggests an important conclusion:
ethical relativism does not apply to the “eternal verities” or
“fundamental verities”39 but it applies to the superstructural
cultural adaptations. The former are universal and the latter are
particular.

It is also important to ask, ‘Can a man-made ethical system
claim to be universally valid for all human beings?’ On the basis
of the foregoing arguments, the answer is clearly negative: man-
made ethical systems lack authority in the form of legitimacy;
authority in the form of power and authority in the form of
universality.

The latter is inescapably deficient in this regard is because
humans only have access to incomplete knowledge conditioned
by time, location and circumstances, and, therefore, cannot,
even in principle, have the insight into human nature to make
their knowledge universal. This limitation is recognized by all
systems of meta-ethics and is the source of much debate and
controversy. Various types of meta-ethical skepticism and
nihilism find their basis here.40 The fact that this deficiency still
causes so much debate suggests that emphatic denials to the
contrary, theistic meta-ethics cannot just be ignored.

6\.1: Contrary Views About Authority and Universality

Non-theistic meta-ethical systems, of course, reject God and
basically set the question of God’s authority aside as
meaningless, irrelevant or insoluble. Some reject God not on
metaphysical grounds but rather, on principle: His very
existence as Creator undermines human freedom and with it, the
very foundation of morality. One such is Jean-Paul Sartre who
argues that if God is the Creator of all things, then our essence
precedes our existence. Humans are compared to paper dolls
that God cuts out.41 This means that human nature or essence is
pre-given by God, and, consequently, we are not truly free to
make or “define”42 ourselves by means of our own ethical
choices. Hence Sartre adopts his “postulatory atheism”43 to
safeguard absolute human freedom. He states, “if God does not
exist then there is at least one being in whom existence precedes
essence,”44 i.e. one being who makes himself by his own actions.
Sartre believes that our choices are only legitimate for
ourselves, have no genuine power over others and are universal
only insofar as they exemplify everyone’s right to choose for
themselves. Our specific personal moral rules and choices apply
only to ourselves. In short, the problems of authority and
universality are simply denied beyond the individual sphere.

Denying authority i.e. legitimacy, power and universality
beyond the individual obviously creates problems in regards to
the social aspects of human existence. No society can exist with
out at least some minimal universal ethical standards applicable
to all. In a constitutional democracy, there is, of course, some
room for individual diversity in ethics. Among them are the
notoriously hard issues of abortion and physician assisted
suicide as well as simple issues like tipping and offering bus
seats to pregnant ladies. However, for society to function
effectively, there must be certain fundamental ethical
injunctions that everyone is expected to obey: honesty in
regards to income tax and other legitimate financial obligations;
respect for the sanctity of life and other people’s bodies as well

122                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

as truthfulness in our dealings with others. Without general
adherence to such rules, moral and legal anarchy will result. The
problem with Sartre is the question of who or what will have
this authority. If the whole point of his existentialism is that we
must make ourselves by our own ethical choices and standards,
then there is no legitimate rule that can be applied to everyone.
The closest Sartre comes to such a universal rule is the
requirement that we must all live in “good faith” i.e. be true to
ourselves, ideas and feelings — but this does not solve the
authority problem. Many evil things have been done in “good
faith.” Besides, who arbitrates what “good faith” is for each
person? In the last analysis, there is simply no room for a
legitimate and universal authority in Sartre’s philosophy which
fails to recognize that we are not only individuals choosing for
ourselves alone but individuals whose identity and well-being is
not entirely in our own hands. The challenge for Sartre’s
existentialism is how to maintain a society in which people
refuse to be defined by anything except their own choices.
Sartre’s later turn to Marxism — generally regarded as poorly
integrated with his existentialism — was an attempt to solve this
problem.

Communism is probably the most wide-spread man-made
meta-ethic in human history even though, since the fall of
Communism in Eastern Europe and Russia, and its gradual
abandonment in China, it is now in eclipse as a practical basis
of government and society. The foundation of Marxist meta-
ethics is the principle that ethics are no more than the “idealistic
superstructure”45 that arises from the relations of material
production. As Marx and Engels say,

> The production of ideas, of conceptions, of
> consciousness, is at first directly interwoven with the
> material activity and the material intercourse of men, the
> language of real life. Conceiving, thinking, the mental
> intercourse of men, appear at this stage as the direct
> efflux of their material behaviour. The same applies to

> mental production as expressed in the language of
> politics, laws, morality, religion, metaphysics, etc. of a
> people. Men are the producers of their conceptions,
> ideas, etc. — real, active men, as they are conditioned by
> a definite development of their productive forces and of
> the intercourse corresponding to these, up to its furthest
> forms.46

In other words, ethical beliefs simply reflect the relations of
production, i.e. the relations all people must enter to survive in
a given economic system, be it slavery, feudalism, capitalism or
Communism. These relations shape our consciousness and with it
our meta-ethical and ethical views. These views are not grounded
in any transcendental power; consequently, there is no
transcendental or divine basis for the legitimacy, power and uni-
versality of any ethical rules. The aim of Marxist philosophy is

> to explain all the different theoretical products and
> forms of consciousness, religion, philosophy, ethics, etc.
> etc. and trace their origins and growth from that
> [material] basis.47

Materialist explanations are the only way to free people from
being enslaved by their masters who use religious beliefs —
“render unto Caesar what is Caesar’s”48 — to oppress them, or
better yet, make them willingly subservient. With materialist
explanations the spell of religion will be broken. The
Communist ethics will prevail and humans shall live in a society
that meets their true needs.

In this struggle, the most advanced section of the proletariat
is the communist movement “which pushes forward all the
others”49 and which has

> over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of
> clearly understanding the line of march, the conditions,
> and the ultimate general results of the proletarian
> movement.50
124                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

In other words, the Communist movement — and later, in
Marxist-Leninism and Marxist-Maoism, the Communist Party —
has special insight about “the ultimate general results of the
proletarian movement,” i.e. the future result of the class
struggle and its social consequences. Such knowledge may be
fairly described as ‘extra-empirical.’ This ‘extra-empirical’
knowledge of the ultimate results of the revolution and the “line
of march” by which it will get there is Marxism’s way of
providing legitimacy to the decisions of the communist
movement or party. Like God, their decisions about everything
from strategy to ethics are legitimated by their superior insight.
The problem for Marxism on this issue is that its empiricist
materialism notwithstanding, there is more than a ‘touch of the
transcendental’ in its basis for legitimacy. It seems to recognize
— albeit it tentatively — that ethical legitimacy requires an
‘extra-empirical’ foundation. Without such a special
foundation, its claim to be the ‘vanguard’ (later spelled out
more fully by Lenin51) that “pushes forward all others”52 is open
to counter-claims by political rivals.

It seems clear that to establish its special legitimacy for
leadership — including moral leadership — Communism puts the
movement, or later, the Party, into the place of God and the
Manifestations. Somebody or something has got to be special to
determine what is or is not ethical. In Communism, morality is
based on whatever the Party decrees — it decides what is good
and bad. This shows that, in the case of Marxism at least, the
effort to build ethics on a purely empirical basis fails.
Consequently, the example of Marxism re-affirms — albeit by
contrast — that meta-ethical principles and the ethical
consequences thereof cannot be purely empirical. God, i.e. a
final ‘extra-empirical’ or transcendental foundation for ethics is
unavoidable.

In addition to undermining its own self-portrayal as strictly
empirical, Marxism has a problem with ethical consistency. If
the same act can be good or evil depending on what the
movement or the Party decides is best for the struggle against

the ruling classes, how can there be any ethical knowledge, how
can a society and personal relations function from one day,
week or year to the next? Under such circumstances, it is simply
impossible for anyone to know right from wrong and good
from evil. In fact, such a view inevitably undermines having
ethical standards at all and encourages mere adaptation to the
latest pronouncements. This cannot be remedied by turning to
the underlying meta-ethical principle according to which what is
moral is whatever furthers the struggle against the ruling class.
That meta-ethical principle is precisely the source of the
problem. This view stands in sharp contrast to the Bahá’í ethical
teaching that the foundation of religious truth are the
unchanging “eternal verities” [PDC 108] whose expression and
practice may vary from culture to culture or epoch to epoch
but whose core principles remain the same. This balances
adaptation to fluid situations with stability.

6\.2: Kant and the Authority Problem

Unlike Sartre, Kant is not blind to the authority problem.

Kant is fully aware of how important it is. That is why in The
Critique of Practical Reason, Kant tries to remedy this problem
in a way that actually (but inadvertently) supports the Writings
by an appeal to a ‘postulatory theism.’ Since Kant denied we
could prove God’s existence rationally and, therefore, we must
postulate or assume His existence if we are to attain the
“summum bonum” i.e. the greatest good for humankind.
According to Kant,

> the supreme cause of nature, which must be presupposed
> as a condition of the summum bonum is a being which is
> the cause of nature by intelligence and will, consequently
> its author, that is God ... Therefore, the summum bonum
> is possible in the world only on the supposition of a
> Supreme Being having a causality corresponding to
> moral character ... the supreme cause of nature, which
> must be presupposed as a condition of the summum
126                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> bonum is a being which is the cause of nature by
> intelligence and will, consequently its author, that is
> God. It follows that the postulate of the possibility of
> the highest derived good (the best world) is likewise the
> postulate of the reality of a highest original good, that is
> to say, of the existence of God. Now it was seen to be a
> duty for us to promote the summum bonum ... and as
> this is possible only on condition of the existence of
> God, it inseparably connects the supposition of this with
> duty; that is, it is morally necessary to assume the
> existence of God.53

Kant states that a morally good life is possible only on the
“presupposition” of a “Supreme Being” Who has the legitimacy
and the power to be the “supreme cause of nature” and Who
also acts morally and is the pre-condition for our moral action.
Kant claims that a “postulatory theism” is needed to lead a good
life. God — even if He is merely “postulatory” — is necessary
for ethical principles to have authority, i.e. legitimacy and
power/effectiveness and universality. He recognizes that a
viable meta-ethics cannot be built on strictly empirical
principles because empiricism offers no way to identify a
definitive standard by which to judge competing ethical claims.
Without such a definitive standard, all meta-ethical principles
and ethical viewpoints are, in effect, equal, i.e. none can be
proven or disproven by empirical appeals alone. Only politics,
social customs or force can establish one claim over another,
but this, of course, only grounds political, not ethical or
intellectual, legitimacy. As we saw previously, Marxism tried to
solve the same by giving the Party ‘extra-empirical’ insight and
understanding and, thereby, ethical legitimacy and power.

Interestingly enough, Kant criticizes various Greek
philosophers for thinking the ‘greatest good’ could be achieved
strictly by human will and intelligence and without an appeal to
God:

> From this deduction it is now intelligible why the Greek
> schools could never attain the solution of their problem
> of the practical possibility of the summum bonum,
> because they made the rule of the use which the will of
> man makes of his freedom the sole and sufficient ground
> of this possibility, thinking that they had no need for
> that purpose of the existence of God.54

Clearly, like the Bahá’í Writings, Kant recognizes that a
purely empirical and humanistic ethic is theoretically and
practically untenable. In other words, Kant adopts a deistic
meta-ethical foundation for his ethical thinking at least as far as
practical reason is concerned. On this matter, he is compatible
with the Bahá’í Writings.

7\. Divine Command Ethics and the Euthyphro Dilemma

The foregoing discussion makes it abundantly clear that the
Bahá’í Writings exemplify what is called the “divine command
theory of moral goodness,”55 i.e. a meta-ethical theory in which
God or a transcendent power is the origin and foundation of
moral truth which may be revealed through special individuals
and/or through nature and history. Furthermore,

> [w]hat divine command theory holds is that God’s will is
> necessary and sufficient in determining the content of
> morality — it actually defines it [morality]. Thus, for an
> act to be “right” it is both necessary and sufficient that
> the act be performed in compliance with God’s will ...
> God’s will is sufficient in that all that is required for an
> act to be “right” is that God wills it is right.56

God’s will is sufficient for ethical “rightness” because as we
have seen above, only God as the Creator of all things has the
capacity and the legitimacy to legislate for the benefit of His
creation. As we shall see below, divine command meta-ethics
also commit the Writings to moral realism, a meta-ethical

128                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

theory according to which “our moral judgments can be true or
false”57 This connects the Writings with other realist meta-
ethical theories such as Platonism or Thomism. God’s will is not
a Platonic Idea but it is equally as real. From this it follows that
a realist meta-ethics precludes ethical relativism since an
absolute ethical standard exists and, through God’s
Manifestations, can be known by mankind.

Divine command meta-ethics faces several challenges, the
most famous of which is the Euthyphro Dilemma.58 In Plato’s
dialogue, Euthyphro, Socrates asks,

> The point which I should first wish to understand is
> whether the pious or holy is beloved by the gods because
> it is holy, or holy because it is beloved of the gods.59

Does God approve certain actions because they are good, or are
certain things good because God approves them? This leads to
the two horns of the Euthyphro dilemma. On one hand, if God
approves them because they are good, then they are good prior
to or without God’s approval, i.e. their goodness is independent
of God. This negates God’s universal sovereignty. On the other
hand, if actions are good because God approves them then
moral good is simply a matter of God’s arbitrary approval. This
starts a vicious circle: if God’s approval is not arbitrary but
based on inherent goodness then this goodness is independent of
God, but if this goodness is not independent of God, then His
approval is arbitrary. Furthermore, if God is omnipotent, any
command — or its opposite — could become good or true
simply because God says so. This — so it is claimed —
undermines the importance of reason in ethics, gives ethics an
arbitrary foundation and raises questions about why we are
obligated to obey such arbitrary selections.

The Bahá’í Writings’ adherence to divine command theory is
beyond question. They make it clear that there are no external
constraints on God’s absolute will in the oft repeated claim that
of “He doeth what He willeth, and ordaineth what He pleaseth.”

[ESW 67]There can be no clearer expression of the consequences
of meta-ethical divine command theory than the following:

> Shouldst Thou [God] regard him who hath broken the
> fast as one who hath observed it, such a man would be
> reckoned among them who from eternity had been
> keeping the fast. And shouldst Thou decree that he who
> hath observed the fast hath broken it, that person would
> be numbered with such as have caused the Robe of Thy
> Revelation to be stained with dust. [PM 67]

In the words of Christian philosophers, J.P. Moreland and
William Lane Craig, “God could have willed that cruelty be
good and love evil and we should be obliged to hate others and
seek to do them harm.”60 Of course, the fact that He could have
does not mean that He has or would. These are simply
statements about God’s power, not about His actions or
intentions.

The Euthyphro Dilemma claims that either God has this
power and is an omnipotent and arbitrary tyrant or He does not
and, therefore is not omnipotent. In neither case is He worthy
of worship. The underlying assumption is that we should no
worship a tyrant or a God Who is not omnipotent.

There are at least three problems with the Euthyphro
Dilemma. First and most obvious is the logical category mistake
which confuses and conflates God — the universal creator —
with a human tyrant. The ‘tyranny of God is not the same kind
of thing as the ‘tyranny’ of a human dictator. Decrees given by
the omnipotent and omniscient creator of the universe Who
knows all possible outcomes of all possible alternatives cannot
be compared with decrees by a tyrant who lacks such knowledge
and, therefore, cannot foresee the results of his orders. A
tyrant’s lack of knowledge undermines his legitimacy and,
thereby, his right to claim absolute power. Furthermore, if we
add God’s inherent goodness to our description of God, the
problem is even more apparent. Calling God a “tyrant” because

130                                          Lights of Irfán vol. 15

He insists on arranging His creation for the maximum goodness
is an arbitrary misuse of the word “tyrant” which is usually
defined as a ruler who uses his power in a “cruel and unfair
way.”61 This is not the God mentioned by the Manifestations.

Furthermore, there is another category mistake insofar as
God cannot be ‘measured’ or judged by the same standard as
His creations. Given His omniscience, what appears as caprice
to our lesser knowledge may be nothing less than reasons we
cannot comprehend. To conclude God has no reasons, i.e. His
choice is arbitrary is unwarranted just because we humans do
not know the reasons. After all He knows all the possibilities
and all their outcomes which is a knowledge no contingent
being has.

Second, if God is the Creator of all things, there simply are
no objects that are inherently good independently of God.
Whatever good they have is from God. Because there are no
things that exist and are good independently of God, there are
no objects that can compel God’s choice in the way outlined by
the Euthyphro Dilemma. Thus, from a Bahá’í perspective, the
Euthyphro Dilemma is a pseudo-dilemma perhaps based on
confusing God as the universal Creator and a pagan ‘god’ who is
not a universal creator and therefore can be confronted by
something he did not create. The Euthyphro Dilemma does not
apply to God as the Bahá’í Writings understand Him.

Of course, if God did not make all things including their
natures, then He is not God — at least as the Bahá’í Writings
understand Him — which makes the Euthyphro Dilemma
irrelevant to Bahá’í philosophy and Christian, Jewish and
Muslim philosophy as well. The Euthyphro Dilemma and the
various revelations are discussing two different concepts of
God. In the last analysis, it is a pseudo-dilemma based on
ambiguous usage of the term ‘God.’

7\.1 Ideal Observer Theory (IOT)

The divine command theory bears significance resemblances
to a contemporary meta-ethical theory known as ideal observer
theory.62 In fact, one might say that the IOT is, in its basic
position, a secularized version of divine command theory. Some
ethicists such as Shelly Kagan recognize this, saying,

> Thus, when presented in theological terms, the ideal
> observer theory becomes the divine command theory:
> valid moral rules are valid by virtue of the fact that God
> commands them.63

The convergence of the two meta-ethical theories is evident in
the following description:

> an ideal observer must be omniscient; omnipercipient,
> i.e. having the ability to imagine vividly any possible
> events or states of affairs, including the experiences and
> subjective states of others; disinterested, i.e. having no
> interest or desires that involve essential reference to any
> particular individuals or things; dispassionate;
> consistent; and otherwise a “normal” human being.64

True ethical propositions, i.e. propositions that are morally
legitimate, authoritative and universal can be made by an
observer who fits these criteria and is perfectly rational and has
all the necessary information.

> Ideal Observer Theory asserts that right and wrong are
> determined by an ideal observer’s reaction to a given
> act. That is, any act X is morally permissible if an ideal
> observer would approve of X; conversely, any act Y is
> morally blameworthy if an ideal observer would
> disapprove of Y.65

Of course, for the IOT in its modern secular form as revived
by Roderick Firth, God is not the ideal observer, nor need He

132                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

be. The capacity to make such ideal judgments can be attained
by asking ourselves how such an ideal being would judge or by
imagining ourselves in the ideal observer’s position. This
requires mental discipline but it is not impossible. So the IOT
claims. From a Bahá’í perspective, however, there is no way for
humans to transcend our inherent limitations. No human can
possibly meet the standards laid out by Firth and others —
omnipercipience, omniscience, pure dispassionate objectivity
and so on. If making absolutely just ethical judgments requires
these attributes, then IOT itself demonstrates the need for God
and the divine command theory. Anything less will merely result
in endless clashes of opinions among less than ideal observers.
This is, of course, precisely what we wish to avoid since it
undermines the entire Bahá’í mission of emphasizing the
oneness of humankind and the unification of humanity into one
global commonwealth.

7\.2: Weak Compatibilism: A Modern Version of Natural Law
Meta-Ethics

The Bahá’í Writings harmonize with a contemporary
variation of natural law theory known as “weak
compatibilism”66 which holds that

> God would not create a natural or moral order that is
> opposed to the divine or a human reason that is
> contradicted by revelation. Yet even though they are not
> in conflict, revelation ... may tell us more than reason is
> able to disclose ... Although this content does not
> contradict reason, it does go beyond it.67

In other words, God would not create a world in which His
reason, mankind’s reason, the order of nature and revelation are
out of harmony or in conflict with one another. There is no
intrinsic conflict between them and whatever conflicts arise are
problems with human perception and understanding. Of course,
the inherent limits of human reason prevent it from grasping

God’s reasoning which transcends and exceeds ours. However,
the fact that we cannot follow God’s reasoning does not mean it
does not exist. Science itself suggests this. Everything in nature
is orderly and follows rules/laws that can be understood by
human reasoning. If such were not the case, science would be
impossible. Consequently, since reason is universally evident in
nature, there are no grounds to suppose that God’s reason
‘suddenly stops’ just because it reaches a point at which our
understanding ends.

At this point a note of clarification is necessary. In regards
to reason, weak compatibilism represents what I have called
“moderate rationalism” in several previous papers.68 Moderate
rationalism contrasts with ‘extreme’ rationalism which asserts
that only rational/logical knowledge and empirical knowledge
are true knowledge. It also contrasts with irrationalism which
says that reason cannot give us any true knowledge, a position
held by Nietzsche and the postmodernists. Moderate rationalism
lies between these two extremes claiming that reason can give us
knowledge up to a point, but after that point it must be
augmented by revelation or the guidance of the “spirit of faith.”
Reason and revelation are not intrinsically in conflict; there are
truths that cannot be fully articulated by human reason because
the divine reason transcends the human mind. Revelation,
therefore, “may tell us more than reason is able to disclose.”

Both the Bahá’í Writings and weak compatibilism support
their adherence to a natural law meta-ethic with a ‘platonic’
theory of reality. If the “natural or moral order” is in harmony
with the divine reason, then the divine reason is somehow
reflected in the natural order which God has created and of
which humanity is a part. In short, the spiritual has a presence in
the material realm. Metaphysical theories that advocate such a
two-part view of a heavenly model reflected in earthly images or
shadows are called ‘platonic’ because Plato is the first known
explicator of this view. In Plato’s theory of reality, the physical
world is a reflection or copy of a non-physical Ideal world
which contains models for everything we see in the material

134                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

realm. This clearly harmonizes with the Bahá’í Writings which
state,

> The spiritual world is like unto the phenomenal world.
> They are the exact counterpart of each other. Whatever
> objects appear in this world of existence are the outer
> pictures of the world of heaven.69

Elsewhere he says,

> For physical things are signs and imprints of spiritual
> things; every lower thing is an image and counterpart of
> a higher thing.70

When the spiritual has a presence in the material, when there
are signs and intimations of a superior world in nature, then
nature is obviously functioning in a teleological manner insofar
as it encourages our awareness of a transcendental world and
our “supernatural vocation.” This teleological function of
nature encourages us to understand the material in terms of the
spiritual. Failure to do so, i.e. interpreting the higher in terms
of the lower, as for example understanding love in terms of
physical lust, distorts our understanding. This inevitably leads
to the animalization of man and the failure to achieve his super-
natural destiny. However, we must raise our existence above the
material. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says, “Strive that your high ideals may
be realized in the Kingdom of God on earth, as they will be in
Heaven.” [PT 43]

8\. Teleology: the Foundation of Natural Law

Another major issue in studying the meta-ethics of the Bahá’í
Writings is the question of whether or not the Writings
exemplify or are consistent with a natural law meta-ethic. This
study finds that such is, indeed, the case albeit it in a variant
version. To explain why, it is necessary to briefly outline the
relevant theory and history of natural law meta-ethics.

Teleology is the foundational concept in any natural law
meta-ethic. It means that everything, especially all living things,
have an innate purpose or final cause that guides their
development and that they must actualize in order to be
genuinely themselves. This final cause, these inherent goals
constitute the nature or essence of every particular being.
Moreover, this final cause is the standard by which we judge
whether or not a thing “is functioning well or appropriately.”1
Insofar as things fail to actualize their final cause, they are
incomplete and not authentically themselves, i.e. not
authentically what they are intended to be. Such a deficient
condition negatively affects the behavior of any living being,
but especially humans, in whom these imperfections inevitably
affect their ethical behavior because humans have a spiritual
nature that should be actualized.

140                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

To begin, natural law, which must be distinguished from
man-made positive or conventional law, is “usually understood
as involving a superhuman legislator,”2 i.e. God Who embeds
these laws in the intrinsic nature or essence of minerals,
vegetables, animals and humans. [FWU 48] Each of these
essentially different kinds of being has its own “prescribed
ways”3 of being and flourishing. This leads us to the key concept
in any natural law meta-ethic: teleology. All beings have an
intrinsic goal, a final cause or purpose and can only achieve
well-being if they strive towards these goals. For example,
regardless of culture, a human child must learn to communicate
and/or understand some language if its well-being is our goal.
Tadpoles have no such requirements since they are intrinsically,
i.e. essentially, different from humans. In other words, ‘the
good’ for any kind of being consists in fulfilling its goals, its
final cause or teleology. The ‘good’ is self-actualization
according to our own particular nature which in humankind
includes our spiritual aspect. Any activity that prevents or
harms the pursuit of the intrinsic ‘good’ is evil to that particular
being. Because humans have free will, they can also be evil to
themselves insofar as they can reject or misuse their teleological
nature. This is an important issue because identifying ‘the good’
is one of the chief functions of any meta-ethical theory.

The earliest known statement about teleology — Aristotle’s
Nicomachean Ethics — is also one of precise and compact:

> Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action
> and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this
> reason the good has rightly been declared to be that at
> which all things aim. But a certain difference is found
> among ends...4

This means that every being and every action is for the sake of a
particular ‘good,’5 which means that they have a goal, a final
cause and are, therefore, teleological in nature. To this,
Aristotle adds, “Each animal is thought to have its proper
pleasure, as it has a proper function; viz., that which

corresponds to its activity.”6 This is its ‘good.’ For humans,
‘good’ means acting according to our spiritual potentials i.e. in
harmony with the divinely given virtues which exist as capacities
or potentials within us. As Aristotle says, “human good turns
out to be activity of soul in accordance with virtue.”7 For the
Bahá’í Writings, such virtuous action occurs when we realize
our teleological nature. In other words, every kind of creation
has its own proper or appropriate happiness based on its
essential nature; from this it follows logically that what is
appropriate for one kind of being is not necessarily appropriate
for another.

Aristotle’s statement about living “in accordance with
virtue” harmonizes with the Bahá’í Writings for the obvious
reason that it locates the basis of true happiness in our spiritual
and not our physical nature. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá declares,

> As for the spiritual perfections they are man’s birthright
> and belong to him alone of all creation. Man is, in
> reality, a spiritual being, and only when he lives in the
> spirit is he truly happy. This spiritual longing and
> perception belongs to all men alike.8

In this statement, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá confirms that this final cause or
“spiritual longing” is universal, i.e. intrinsic to human nature —
is unique to man and, therefore, defines him and his essence.

St. Thomas Aquinas, the great medieval philosopher and
theologian developed the concept of natural law in more detail
than any other thinker. He writes,

> all things partake somewhat of the eternal law, insofar
> as, namely, from its being imprinted upon them, they
> derive their respective inclinations to their proper acts
> and ends. Now among all others, the rational creature is
> subject to divine providence in a more excellent way,
> insofar as it partakes of a share of providence, by being
> provident for itself and for others. Wherefore it has a
142                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> share of the eternal reason, whereby it has a natural
> inclination to its proper act and end, and this
> participation of the eternal law in the rational creature is
> called the natural law.9

The “proper acts” referred to by Aquinas are those acts which
are in harmony with our God-given essential nature, our goal or
purpose; they are ‘proper’ or ‘appropriate’ to our nature.
Moreover, Aquinas’s “natural inclinations[s]” correspond to the
“spiritual susceptibilities” [PUP 7] of the Writings because both
incline us to correct moral action but neither can compel it,
thereby safe-guarding humankind’s free will. Both in the
Writings and in Aquinas, these inclinations or susceptibilities
are oriented to or ‘aimed’ at achieving our divinely given final
cause, purpose or end or what is known in Catholic philosophy
as our “supernatural vocation.”10 This supernatural end is
intended to guide our actions in this world and lead to our
happiness or well-being.

8\.1: Objections to Natural Law Theory

The first and most obvious objection to natural law theory is
Hume’s ‘is-ought’ problem according to which we cannot
assume that because a certain situation is the factual case that it
ought to be the case, i.e. we must not suppose that the facts of
nature place a moral obligation on human action.11 According
to Hume, facts and values are two distinct kinds of things and
to confuse them is a logical category error that mixes up
descriptive statements, which tell us what is the case, with
prescriptive statements which tell us what ought to be the case.
Besides, no empirical analysis can show us any ethical imperative
in living things. Consequently, it is argued, natural law meta-
ethics is impossible because nature cannot be claimed as the
basis for any prescriptions, i.e. any ethics at all.

One problem with “Hume’s Guillotine” as it is sometimes
called, is that it only applies to a strictly empiricist and
materialist concept of nature in which values have no place.

However, it does not apply if nature, i.e. living things and
humans, are teleological, and, therefore, have an inherent goal
for which they strive. Having such a purpose necessarily means
that values are at work in the form of preferences or
requirements for optimal development of living things. A plant
must seek water to grow, an animal must reach maturity to
reproduce its kind. Some possibilities have greater value than
others in reaching optimal results for a living being and,
therefore, are more valuable, better, good, natural and so on.
At the most basic level, ‘good’ is what enables a living thing to
attain its optimal condition, and, therefore, has utilitarian
value. For animals, of course, there is no point in asking if they
should strive for optimal development — they have no choice
and that is what they just do. Should a human do the same, i.e.
is there a moral obligation to do so? In our view, the answer is
clear: if the purpose of morality is not to attain optimal well-
being, then the concept of ‘morality’ is meaningless and any
discussions about whether or not there is a moral obligation for
optimal development are futile.

Moreover, there is a third, unintended consequence to
“Hume’s Guillotine.” If empirical facts can tell us nothing
about morals, if ‘is’ cannot lead to ‘ought,’ then it follows that
science is irrelevant to ethics. There is no way to establish a
scientific ethic to guide human kind because values cannot be
tested by the scientific method. They do not meet the criteria of
being objects for scientific study insofar as they are not
physical, cannot be measured, they cannot be predicted and
tested for truth or falsity. Sam Harris recognizes this difficulty
in his book The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine
Values, in which he tries to undo Hume’s ‘is-ought’ conundrum
by claiming it as “another dismal product of Abrahamic
religion.”12 However, pointing out the — in his view —
unrespectable origin of the problem does not prove that the
problem is unreal. His claim is an example of the genetic fallacy
which tries to disprove an idea by referring to allegedly
‘unrespectable’ origins.13

144                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

Hume’s is-ought problem has one other weakness: it cannot
be universally applied but only works with an empirical and
materialist view of nature. However, if nature is teleological
and, as in ‘platonic’ theories, there is a spiritual presence in
nature, it is not at all difficult to derive an ‘ought’ from an ‘is.’
We can see why such is the case in of Bahá’u’lláh’s statement,

> Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
> is a direct evidence of the revelation within it of the
> attributes and names of God, inasmuch as within every
> atom are enshrined the signs that bear eloquent
> testimony to the revelation of that Most Great Light.14

From a Bahá’í perspective, nature is inherently value-laden
first, by virtue of its origin with God and second, because each
thing reflects the values of God in the material realm. If nature
is value-laden, then obviously we can draw conclusions about
values, including moral values from it. These values are
imperative insofar as they are sanctioned or authorized by God
and are obligatory for the kinds of beings to which they pertain.
A human, for example, has spiritual capacities that must be
developed (unless distortions in our development are to occur)
whereas a horse does not.

There is one other famous and often-used argument against
natural law meta-ethics. Sartrean existentialism rejects the
concept that humans have a ‘ready-made’ essence or nature
given to them, a view often encapsulated in the phrase
“existence precedes essence.” In practice, this means that
humans make themselves and have no nature or essence given to
them ‘ready-made’ by God or anyone else. As Sartre puts it,
“Human freedom precedes essence in man,”15 meaning, we are
not constrained by a pre-established essence and are free to
make our own. Simone de Beauvoir, author of the archetypal
feminist text, The Second Sex, applies this Sartre’s idea to
women in her statement “One is not born a woman; one
becomes a woman.”16 Some schools of feminism (as well as post-
modern philosophy17) have also adopted the meta-ethical belief

that there is no given human essence or sexuality, and that we
personally and/or collectively construct human nature as we
find it. Michele M. Schumacher writes, “[A] majority of
academic and western feminist assume that whatever nature is,
it is not human. There is ... no such ‘thing’ as specifically human
nature.”18 According to these philosophers, we could re-
construct human nature — or sexuality — in some other way if
we choose to do so. Our ethics and our nature is in our hands
because we have no intrinsic teleological nature.

8\.2 The Basis for Natural Law Meta-Ethic in the Bahá’í Writings

In our view, the Bahá’í Writings adhere to a variation of a
natural law meta-ethic. The convergences with Aristotle’s and
Aquinas’ views are obvious and need no further elaboration.
Bahá’u’lláh shows humanity’s teleological nature when He
affirms,

It is for thee to direct thyself towards the Ultimate
> Goal, and the Supreme End, and the Most Sublime
> Pinnacle, that thou mayest hear and behold what hath
> been revealed by God, the Lord of the worlds.19

This passage shows that in order to fulfill our teleological
nature or final cause and “supernatural vocation,” we must
develop our “spiritual susceptibilities” [PUP 7] so we can “hear
and behold,” i.e. comprehend and follow God’s new revelation
and harmonize our lives with God’s Will. Harmonizing our will
with God’s Will in daily practice is precisely what ethics is all
about.

The Universal House of Justice expressly identifies human
nature as teleological and asserts that certain attributes are
“intended by God for human nature.” These attributes
constitute our essence and, thereby, define us as human beings.
Any attribute that contradicts our essence is “unnatural”:

146                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> The Bahá’í concept of human nature is teleological; that
> is, there are certain qualities intended by God for
> “human nature”, and qualities which do not accord with
> these are described as “unnatural.”20

The consequences of this statement are clear: any attributes
not in harmony with God’s will for human nature are
“unnatural” and, thereby, not ethical. This is because going
against God’s goodness and His good will for us cannot, by
definition, be ethically good. Actualizing our God-given
teleological nature, i.e. acting on the basis of our spiritual
aspects means that we at least strive to act ethically. In other
words, what accords with our true spiritual nature and what is
ethical are one and the same thing.

As previously noted, because our teleological nature is from
God, this “Ultimate Goal” or final cause is real, objective and
mind-independent. It is ‘the good’ towards which we are all
striving, either unconsciously or consciously. From this, along
with the guidance given by Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Shoghi
Effendi and the Universal House of Justice, it follows logically
that some actions are more suited to attaining that “Ultimate
Goal” than others i.e. not all actions are equally suited to
attaining ‘the good.’ This suggests that our divinely given
human nature establishes an objective standard by which to
evaluate and choose our actions from an ethical standpoint.
Consequently, moral relativism is negated since it lacks such an
objective standard and, therefore, reduces all moral choices to
subjective preferences. However, we must also recall that a
diversity of appropriate choices may well exist in some cases
and that the range of appropriate choices is not necessarily
reduced to one. In other words, humanity’s teleological nature
does not violate the Bahá’í principle of unity in diversity.

Moreover, because these laws originate with God, they are
mind-independent and objective and, therefore, they are not
determined by human perceptions, wishes or cultural agendas.
For example, we can (somewhat) shape the basic communication

needs of human beings — as by using sign language — but we
cannot eliminate them. They are needs that must be fulfilled. In
addition, natural laws are unchangeable because they are based
on the intrinsic nature of a being and as long as that particular
kind of being exists, the applicable natural laws will also exist.
This idea is implicit in the concept of progressive revelation
which divides laws into two parts, the temporary and the
eternal:

> Each of the divine religions embodies two kinds of
> ordinances. The first is those which concern spiritual
> susceptibilities, the development of moral principles and
> the quickening of the conscience of man. These are
> essential or fundamental, one and the same in all
> religions, changeless and eternal — reality not subject to
> transformation ... The second kind of ordinances ...

relate to the material affairs of mankind.21

The “essential or fundamental” laws do not change because
human nature does not change; hence, they are “the same in all
religions” which, in effect, means the same in all places and at
all times. Only the actualization of human potentials changes as
we progress spiritually, culturally, economically and so on.
Once again, it is important to note that if collective/societal or
individual acts coincide with natural law, we may legitimately
call it ‘just’ or morally ‘good’ and if they do not, the individual
act or the positive/conventional law is unjust and “unnatural”22
and will degrade our well-being. According to natural law
theory, man-made, i.e. conventional law must either be based on
or at least not be in conflict with natural law if we are to gain
true benefit from legislation. In this sense, the theological laws
revealed by the Manifestation take precedence over positive
man-made law.

At this point, it must be emphasized that references to
natural law do not refer to the physical laws of nature or the
behavior of animals in nature. Therefore, the Writings explicitly
reject the concept that human behavior should model itself on

148                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

animal behaviors in the natural world. Our ethics are derived
from our essential nature and the Bahá’í theory of human nature
includes our rational and spiritual aspects which do not exist in
animals. This issue is especially relevant in light of vigorous
contemporary debate about homosexuality. For example, the
Bahá’í Faith sees homosexual acts as “unnatural”23 which, of
course, is a reference to our God-given rational and spiritual
nature. The Bahá’í view cannot be scientifically disproven by
cataloging alleged homosexual acts in the animal kingdom and
then arguing that the acts found in nature give legitimize the
same actions among humans. Bruce Bagemihil famously tried
this in his book Natural Exuberance.24 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá makes clear
that what is natural and appropriate for animals is not
necessarily so for humans: “the fact that some species eat their
young does not mean that it is acceptable for human beings to
do so.”25 Actions that violate our higher natures are not
appropriate for us and violate our nature.

This is why Bahá’í meta-ethics cannot uncritically accept
beliefs that nature is a moral exemplar for us to follow. The
aspects of nature that orient us towards ‘the good’ are in
harmony with our essence and, above all, are sanctioned by or in
harmony with the Writings themselves. Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá often illustrate their teachings with reference to nature —
“Doves are of many colors; nevertheless, they live in utmost
harmony” [PUP 45] — but we must remember that using nature to
illustrate a divinely ordained principle is not the same as basing
a moral teaching on what we find in nature. The Writings reveal
God’s teachings and illustrate them with selected examples from
nature; the starting point is God, not nature. Nature alone can
never be a self-sufficient foundation of our ethical principles
which can only have their legitimacy, authority and universality
from God. Perhaps the fastest way to illustrate this is to point
out some especially horrible habits among animals: dogs
packing, chickens pecking a deformed chick to death, or gang
rape among dolphins. Naturalist ethical systems avoid examples
like this for obvious reasons. Taoism, European Romanticism,

and various modern nature ‘spiritualities’ are examples of such
thinking that look towards the co-operative aspects of nature as
a moral model. However, nature also has brutal competition
which was the focus of Darwinism and Social Darwinism and
their Fascist descendents. Nature alone is not a reliable guide to
morals.

We must be very clear in our minds that applying animal
behaviors to judge human actions is also irrational for the
simple reason that humans are not merely animals; we are, as the
Writings teach, essentially different. To behave like something
we are not, is irrational because it is against our own best
interests. From the perspective of Bahá’í meta-ethics, irrational
behavior is deeply problematic because it violates our essential
nature as “rational souls” [SAQ 208-209] which distinguish us
from animals. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes:

> The human spirit which distinguishes man from the
> animal is the rational soul, and these two names — the
> human spirit and the rational soul — designate one thing.
> This spirit, which in the terminology of the philosophers
> is the rational soul, embraces all beings, and as far as
> human ability permits discovers the realities of things ...
> But the human spirit, unless assisted by the spirit of
> faith, does not become acquainted with the divine
> secrets and the heavenly realities. [SAQ 208-209]

Here, too, we find convergence between the Bahá’í Writings
and Aristotle, who said that the highest virtue for humans is the
exercise of reason which is “something divine.”26

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement indicates that without the “rational
soul” either in actuality or in potential, we are seriously
defective as humans. Something that should be there is not or is
not functioning as it should. However, the “rational soul” while
necessary is not sufficient because to fully actualize ourselves
we must “awaken spiritual susceptibilities” [PUP 7] to receive
inspiration and guidance of the “spirit of faith.” Furthermore,

150                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

humans are constituted by two natures, i.e. a physical, bodily
nature and a spiritual nature “born from the bounty to the Holy
Spirit.” [SAQ 118] From this it follows that in Bahá’í meta-ethics,
ethical decisions must harmonize with both our physical and
spiritual natures as well as with our inherent rationality.

Of course, humans also have free will in regards to moral
matters and, therefore, can violate their own natures i.e. act
irrationally and unnaturally but this results in their own
detriment. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, for example, regards racial prejudice
as “unnatural” [PUP 287] which is to say, against our own
spiritual and rational natures. Indulging in this irrational and
“unnatural” behavior damages us individually and socially.

8\.3: Udo Schaefer’s Rejection of Natural Law Meta-ethics

On the subject of a natural law meta-ethic in the Bahá’í
Writings, it is important to specifically examine Udo Schaefer’s
discussion of this subject in his Bahá’í Ethics In Light of
Scripture. In the discussion below, we shall endeavor to show
that alternative understandings of this issue are possible and
should also be considered.

In this work, Schaefer accepts that “Insofar as the virtues
have a telos, or purpose, that of right being Bahá’í ethics may be
called teleological.”27 Despite this statement, he vigorously
rejects the concept of a natural law meta-ethics in the Bahá’í
Writings. However, the matter may be understood differently
than he does. Once we accept teleology, i.e. purposive, goal
oriented behavior, it is, in our view, difficult to avoid the
conclusion that this goal is a standard by which all action must
be judged, and that all ‘virtues’ are by definition those acts that
advance our way to the goal. The necessity of performing these
acts to attain the goal constitutes natural law, i.e. the
requirements we must meet to actualize our essence. In short,
there are desirable and undesirable results that we strive for.
This also throws doubt on the deontologic aspects of Bahá’í
ethics28 for the simple reason that commands obeyed for the

sake of attaining our teleologic goal or for the love of God
cannot be deontologic, i.e. done for their own sake. We shall
have more to say about this below.

In regards to teleology, our view is that the Writings seem to
follow a middle-path between the outright rejection of natural
law meta-ethics in its traditional form and a complete
acceptance of the traditional or conventional natural law
theory. In other words, there is another, alternative way to
understand this topic and its associated issues.

According to Udo Schaefer, “The Bahá’í Faith does not
support the idea of an innate, natural law, moral law inscribed
by God in human nature;”29 he adds that “Neither Bahá’í
scripture not the Qur’an contain even a hint at natural law.”30
The key point in Schaefer’s understanding is the belief that the

> highest criterion in moral judgment is recourse to God’s
> arbitrary will and to the infallibility of the divine
> Messenger who mediates this will to humanity ... To this
> will which is arbitrary, absolute, not bound by principles
> ... man owes absolute obedience . . .[The moral order] is
> not anchored in preceding Platonic ideas of good and
> evil, in eternal truths immanent in nature and
> identifiable by reason, nor in a rational concept of
> human nature ... nor in a rationally recognizable ‘nature
> of things’ (rerum natura). Rather morality proceeds from
> the decisions of God’s arbitrary will.... His will has no
> reason to will as he wills other than that he wills it so.31

In other words, the basis of Schaefer’s rejection is that God’s
will cannot be limited by anything external to Himself, such as
“preceding Platonic ideas of good and evil” that would limit His
power of choice in any way. Moreover, God’s Will is non-
rational and “arbitrary,” i.e. He “has no reason to will as he
wills.” Such is the case because the

152                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> existence of a preceding idea of the moral good, the
> existence of a natural moral order, of a natural law ,
> binding upon God would make it ‘an associate of his
> [God’s] judgment ... and would thus limit God’s
> sovereignty.32

The view that anything can precede God or limit His Will is, of
course, unacceptable according to the Bahá’í Writings. In
addition, contrary to the traditional theory of natural law,
Schaefer maintains that human reason alone cannot identify
these moral values:

> [a] basic proposition of all natural law is that moral
> norms are recognized as such by human reason. The
> question then arises as to the place assigned to reason in
> Bahá’í ethics. Can human beings distinguish between
> right and wrong, good and evil, virtue and vice by means
> of reason alone, without the aid of scripture. Is reason
> an independent, primary or supplementary source of
> values?33

This, of course, brings us to the crucial question of moderate
rationalism and what can be known and how.34 Finally, we
should note that natural law,

> is based on the idea that [t]here is an ‘eternal and
> unchangeable law that encompasses all peoples and all
> ages’, a law that is ‘in accord with right reason (recta
> ratio) and shared by all human beings. Thus the rules of
> conduct are inherent in all human nature and are based
> upon eternal, rational ideas of justice, upon an imagined
> apriori nature of the human being and its innate moral
> sense. According to this philosophy the basic principles
> of ethics, the magna principia, are recognizable by
> reason.35

Let us examine Schaefer’s argument to see if there are
alternate ways of understanding the points he raises.

As we have seen, Schaefer outlines and rejects what may be
called the ‘standard’ or traditional view of natural law meta-
ethics. We do not deny that this is one way to understand the
subject, but we do not believe this is the only way to
understand to do so. We shall outline an alternative viewpoint
by examining the key issues involved. There are four major
issues in natural law meta-ethics: (a) the power of God; (2)
teleology; (3) intrinsic moral knowledge. We shall examine these
and some of the issues that grow out of them and (d) the role of
reason.

First of all, contrary to what Schaefer seems to claim, a
natural law meta-ethics does not necessarily limit the power of
God by subordinating them to preceding morals that exist
independently of God like Platonic Ideas. Such subordination is,
of course, one of the horns of the Euthyphro Dilemma we have
already discussed. Bahá’í, Jewish, Christian or Muslim versions
of natural law meta-ethic reject the concept that anything can
precede God because God is the Creator of all things. Such a
view is logically absurd. Furthermore, to believe that anything
can precede God and exist independently denies God’s
omnipotence — but such a notion of God is simply not relevant
to the Bahá’í Writings. In the last analysis, there is absolutely
nothing in the idea of a natural law meta-ethic that denigrates
God by requiring Him to choose among pre-existing,
independent values for humankind. All that a natural law meta-
ethic requires is that moral laws, moral knowledge or moral
capacities be intrinsic to human nature and that in some way
play a role in our ethical evolution. Consequently, Schaefer’s
objection on this matter need not hinder the development of an
alternative view to natural law ethics in the Writings.

In order to emphasize God’s omnipotence and, thereby,
sharpen his argument against the slightest hint of pre-existing or
Platonic Ideas, Schaefer portrays God as “arbitrary, absolute
and not bound by principles: “His will has no reason to will as
he wills other than that he wills it so.”36 God’s omnipotence is,
of course, the basis of a natural-law meta-ethic because without

154                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

an omnipotent God, humanity and nature could not be
universally endowed with their inherent capacities and the
values these embody in unactualized, ‘embryo’ form. However,
it is not necessary that God’s “arbitrary” Will be understood in
the human sense of the word, i.e. random, whimsical or
capricious. Nor do we need to claim that He necessarily acts
non-rationally, i.e. that He has no reasons to act. In fact, to
over-emphasize God’s arbitrariness not only falls onto one of
the horns of the Euthyphro dilemma but seems more aligned
with certain interpretations of Protestant Christianity such as
Lutheranism and Calvinism.37

We do not need to deny God’s omnipotent and “arbitrary”
power to realize that just because God could act in any way He
chooses with or without any reason, it does not necessarily
mean that He would act in a capricious and irrational manner.
Being all-powerful does not prevent God from choosing to act
consistently with reason or His own laws. Indeed, God can even
choose to limit the use of His power — as He does in bestowing
free will on human beings. He certainly knows when we make a
moral mistake, but He limits His power by not interfering.
Doing this is logically consistent with the freedom He has given
us and avoids the logical contradiction of taking with one hand
the freedom He has given with the other. If God constantly
interferes with human action to ensure that we make the right
moral choice, true moral progress would be impossible because
humans would, in effect, not be tested and reduced to robots.
Morality itself would be abolished. After all, morality depends
on the possibility of free choice. Here, too, we observe that
omnipotent God chooses to act in a manner consistent with the
laws of reason He created. In that sense he acts like Shoghi
Effendi’s “rational God.” [WOB 112]

There are two important caveats on the foregoing discussion.

First, it must be emphasized that our discussion does not allow
us to conclude that God in His essence is rational. God’s essence
is simply unknowable to His creations. However, the fact that
God’s essence is absolutely unknowable does not prevent us

from observing that God’s Will has revealed itself in way that is
consistent with human reason at least in this ‘corner of
creation.’ Furthermore, making the human essence the “rational
soul” suggests that we are being ‘fitted’ or adapted to a creation
that is fundamentally rational. Otherwise, the mismatch
between the “rational soul” and a capricious creation would
make intellectual and moral development impossible. Science
would also become impossible in a mismatch between the
rational human soul and a non-rational creation. Second, it is
important to note that because God chooses to reveal His Will
in a way consistent with human reason does not mean that God
Himself reasons in the human way. In fact, we cannot know if
God ‘reasons’ at all. All we can say is that in creation, He
reveals His Will in manner consistent with our reasoning
processes and consequently, there is no intrinsic conflict
between reason and religion. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says, “Reason is
the first faculty of man and the religion of God is in harmony
with it.” [PUP 231]

The second and third pillars of natural law meta-ethics are
teleology and the existence of inherent moral knowledge.
Although distinct in themselves, they are intertwined and so we
shall discuss them together. Teleology is the belief that all
things, but especially all living things and most especially human
beings have an intrinsic purpose that guides their development.
Although we have already discussed this above, there is more to
say specifically vis-à-vis the Bahá’í Writings and Udo Schaefer’s
presentation of this issue. We shall begin with a quotation from
the Universal House of Justice:

> The Bahá’í concept of human nature is teleological; that
> is, there are certain qualities intended by God for
> “human nature”, and qualities which do not accord with
> these are described as “unnatural.”38

This passage confirms humanity’s teleological nature —
thereby agreeing with the bed-rock principle of natural law
meta-ethics as we have seen above. Moreover, the teleological

156                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

nature or final cause must be within us i.e. within nature, since
otherwise it could not be our goal as human beings. Finally, this
passage asserts that there are “certain qualities intended by God
for ‘human nature” which means that certain qualities are
deemed by God as good and, therefore, desirable for humanity.
If God considers such qualities desirable for human nature, then
obviously these qualities are part of human nature because of
His endowment. Moreover, among these good qualities is the
orientation (or ‘vector’) towards God Who is “the Desire of all
things.” [PM 58] The desire for God is in “all things” though “all
things” may not be conscious of it as humans should be.
Obviously, if God is the goal or “the Desire of all things” then
all things, humans included, have an intrinsic teleological nature
to seek Him in a way appropriate to their essence. Here, too, we
see that these qualities are within human nature, and that there
is something in each individual which orients us towards the
good and the true, i.e. our “supernatural vocation.” In addition,
these qualities “intended by God” are an objective standard by
which humans can evaluate whether our actions have lived up
God’s intentions or not. In other words, we have within us an
objective and universal divine standard to judge our conduct.
We shall explore this issue further below.

There is additional evidence that mankind’s nature is
teleological, and specifically oriented towards moral knowledge
and the desire for God. The Writings speak of “the universality
or perfection of virtues potential in mankind. Therefore, it is
said that man has been created in the image and likeness of
God.”39 This implies that if these potentials were not present in
mankind, we would not be made in God’s image which, in
effect, means we would not be human. In short, these potentials
are part of our essence as human beings. A similar line of
argument develops from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s frequent references to
the “spiritual susceptibilities”40 within human beings and his
calls on us to “to awaken spiritual susceptibilities in the hearts
of mankind.”41 How could one awaken what is not there? If
these susceptibilities are to be awakened, then they must exist —

at least, in potential — be within us, waiting for actualization
by the Manifestation. Indeed, these “spiritual susceptibilities”
distinguish humans from animals which are “utterly lacking
spiritual susceptibilities, ignorant of divine religion and without
knowledge of the Kingdom of God.” [PUP 177] In our view, these
“spiritual susceptibilities” are a moral sense in potentia. The
Bahá’í International Community also sees moral potentialities as
inherent to humankind:

It not only sees the individual as a spiritual being, a “rational
soul”, but also insists that the entire enterprise that we call
civilization is itself a spiritual process, one in which the human
mind and heart have created progressively more complex and
efficient means to express their inherent moral and intellectual
capacities.42

What could “express[ing] their inherent moral and
intellectual capacities” refer to if not expressing the moral
truths and understandings that have been awakened from
potentiality by the Manifestation? This, at least, is our
understanding of the matter.

We can also observe the intrinsic nature of these qualities.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> The holy Manifestations of God come into the world to
> dispel the darkness of the animal, or physical, nature of
> man, to purify him from his imperfections in order that
> his heavenly and spiritual nature may become quickened,
> his divine qualities awakened, his perfections visible, his
> potential powers revealed and all the virtues of the
> world of humanity latent within him may come to life.43

It should be pointed out that here, too, that moral virtues are
potential within us: “the virtues of the world of humanity [are]
latent within [us].” Moreover, our divine qualities” cannot be
“awakened,” our “perfections [made] visible” and our
“potential powers revealed” if they are not within us, i.e.

158                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

inherent. These inherent attributes — whether in potential or in
actuality — are necessary for an natural law meta-ethic. Without
them and without a teleological nature, a natural law meta-ethic
is impossible.

The existence of potential moral knowledge raises the
question of whether or not reason alone can help us discover the
virtues entailed in our final cause. Aquinas, for example,
accepts that at least some of these ethical precepts can be
known by “the light of natural reason alone44 (although
revelation is needed for faith) whereby we discern what is good
and what is evil.45 However, the Bahá’í Writings disagree.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá makes it clear that reason alone is not sufficient
for true knowledge: “But the human spirit [rational soul], unless
assisted by the spirit of faith, does not become acquainted with
the divine secrets and the heavenly realities.” [SAQ 208] Reason is
necessary but not sufficient to awaken our “spiritual
susceptibilities” which are a moral sense in potentia. The matter
could not be more clear: our spiritual and moral knowledge
cannot develop without assistance from “the spirit of faith.”
[SAQ 208] Elsewhere ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> How shall we attain the reality of knowledge? By the
> breaths and promptings of the Holy Spirit, which is light
> and knowledge itself. Through it the human mind is
> quickened and fortified into true conclusions and
> perfect knowledge. [PUP 22]

Furthermore, the Writings make it clear that humanity’s
spiritual and moral evolution cannot occur without the
Manifestations; consequently, reason is not sufficient. It
requires the aid of the Manifestations. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes,

> It is evident that the holy Manifestations and divine
> dawning points are necessary, for these blessed and
> glorious Souls are the foremost Teachers and Educators
> of mankind, and all human souls are developed through
> Them by the bounty of the Holy Spirit of God.46

It is, of course, obvious that if reason alone were sufficient
to acquire spiritual and moral knowledge and to carry on
humanity’s evolution, the Manifestations would not be needed.
Indeed, this is exactly what such philosophies as Humanism
claim. Humanity is sufficient to itself.47 Unfortunately, daily
experience and history prove otherwise. As Schaefer says,

> Human beings cannot recognize the moral order by
> reason alone; they are dependent on divine revelation on
> a God-given standard, a hierarchy of supreme values, on
> fixed point constituting an immovable yardstick and not
> subject to reason.48

However, the fact that reason is not sufficient, does not
automatically mean that reason is not necessary for humans to
know, understand and apply our moral knowledge in daily life.
Reason is unavoidable when dealing with morals. First of all, we
must use reason to understand precisely what the divine
guidance means, i.e. we must interpret it in a way that does not
fall into logical absurdity, into self-contradiction and into
contradiction with the rest of the Writings. As Schaefer says,
we must interpret it ‘in accord with right reason.” Furthermore,
if we find ourselves in a situation in which there is no explicit
textual guidance, we must reason our way to a solution on the
basis of the Writings. There is not always time or opportunity
to consult with others or the Universal House of Justice.
Finally, we must evaluate whether or not our actions harmonize
with the Writings and why. In other words, God establishes the
ideal moral standards and reveals them in a manner consistent
with reason but humanity applies them in creation in a rational
way within the guidelines of the Writings. We cannot judge
God’s choices of moral principles but we must understand and
apply them rationally. Thus, as we can see, reason is necessary in
our moral lives. This, of course, is a modification of traditional
natural law meta-ethics.

160                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

Such an essential role for reason in our ethical lives is not
surprising, given the emphasis on reason in the Writings.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá states,

> that which is found to be real and conformable to reason
> must be accepted, and whatever science and reason
> cannot support must be rejected as imitation and not
> reality. [PUP 175]

and,

> God has endowed man with intelligence and reason
> whereby he is required to determine the verity of
> questions and propositions ... If a question be found
> contrary to reason, faith and belief in it are impossible,
> and there is no outcome but wavering and vacillation.

[PUP 181]

In addition, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says God

> has bestowed upon him [man] the power of intellect so
> that through the attribute of reason, when fortified by
> the Holy Spirit, he may penetrate and discover ideal
> realities and become informed of the mysteries of the
> world of significances.49

Reason is even applicable to matters related to faith and
knowledge that does not pertain to the world of matter. Hence
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement that

> In divine questions we must not depend entirely upon
> the heritage of tradition and former human experience;
> nay, rather, we must exercise reason, analyze and
> logically examine the facts presented so that confidence
> will be inspired and faith attained.50

Further emphasizing the importance of reason in all aspects
of human life is the fact that the essential human feature is the

“rational soul” which is universal. It distinguishes us from
animals. Consequently, there are no good grounds to doubt the
applicability of reason to moral issues since we cannot exclude
our essential nature from anything we do. If we could, it would
no longer be essential.

To emphasize: according to the Writings, the Manifestations
are necessary to activate our inherent potentials.51 However,
this does not contradict natural law since natural law does not
logically require that our moral knowledge be awakened in any
specific way. Recognizing moral laws by reason alone is a
Thomistic teaching but the Bahá’í Writings reject this view for
the obvious reason that if humankind can recognize the moral
laws by itself, there is no reason for the Manifestations to exist.
Moreover, the Manifestations are necessary to motivate
humanity to do what is right; knowledge alone is not enough,
i.e. necessary but not sufficient. This is the great weakness in
the Socratic view of ethics, namely, the belief that people will
naturally do the right thing once they know what the right thing
is. This is a charming delusion. By itself, knowledge does not
make people ethical — there must also be motivation or
willingness to do the right thing and the strength to do it.
Providing willingness and strength is one of the irreplaceable
roles of the Manifestation.

According to Schaefer, natural law meta-ethics

> is based on the idea that [t]here is an ‘eternal and
> unchangeable law that encompasses all peoples and all
> ages’, a law that is ‘in accord with right reason (recta

162                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

Once again, there are alternative ways of understanding these
ideas. In our view, it seems clear that the Bahá’í Writings also
advocate an “apriori nature of human being and its innate moral
sense” that is “shared by all human beings.” Because this issue is
so essential to a natural law meta-ethic, a review is worthwhile.
In the first place, human nature universally shares the same final
cause — to know and worship God. It is teleological, i.e. it
shares the same final cause. Therefore, humankind is not only
physically but spiritually one. Shoghi Effendi states that “In
origin and intention of creation mankind is one” [ADJ 37] which
is to say, we originate from God and have the same teleological
nature of evolving towards God. All human beings, regardless
of culture, time, place or historical circumstance share the same
essence which is the “rational soul” distinguishing us from
animals. The Bahá’í International Community which states, “The
rational soul, in the Bahá’í view, is a phenomenon with limitless
potentialities: intellectual, spiritual, emotional and moral.53
Furthermore, all humans have a double nature, a physical
‘animal’ nature and a spiritual nature which draws them towards
God. This human nature is endowed with latent potentials,
including moral potentials and “spiritual susceptibilities.” Thus,
from our perspective, the Writings clearly advocate an
identifiable view of a universal human nature.

In addition, in our view the Bahá’í Writings accept that there
is, as Schaefer puts it,

> an ‘eternal and unchangeable law that encompasses all
> peoples and all ages’, a law that is ‘in accord with right
> reason (recta ratio) and shared by all human beings.54

Given the existence of a universal human nature, it is only
rational that such a law should exist. Indeed, how else could
humanity be essentially one as the Writings teach? How else
shall humankind be unified? Without an essentially
unchangeable law based on what Shoghi Effendi calls the
“eternal verities” passed on from one revelation to another,
mankind would remain so badly diversified that conflict would

remain inevitable. There would still be adaptations to different
cultures — but these adaptations would still embody the “eternal
verities.” Moral standards would be superficially or accidently
different but essentially the same.

9\. Motivation: Happiness: Eudaimonian Ethics

One of the key meta-ethical questions concerns motivation,
i.e. why we should be good — especially when it is to our
advantage not to be?’ Are the reasons to be good entirely
intrinsic or extrinsic or are they a combination of both? Is
personal satisfaction even necessary or can dedication to a
greater cause be sufficient? Is such dedication to a greater cause
necessary? These are some of the questions that arise.

In regards to the various schools of meta-ethics, the Writings
and Aristotle’s “eudaimonic ethics” seem to converge.
Aristotle’s “eudaimonia” which is often translated as
“happiness,” “well-being” and “flourishing” is also linked to
“arête” or personal virtue. In both the Eudemian Ethics and
Nichomachean Ethics, Aristotle asserts that happiness is the
final goal, ‘the good’ for which all human beings strive, the
motivation that energizes them: “Happiness is at once the
pleasantest and the fairest and best of all things whatever.”55 To
achieve it, we must strive to exist in the most perfect and
complete state possible; in other words, all things strive to self-
actualize, to move from potency to act, or, to make their
potentials actual. Striving for this ‘good’ is their true happiness.
Aristotle notes that happiness comes in “activities in accordance
with our human estate”56 or nature, and connects actualization
with happiness in his claim that “philosophic wisdom”57
produces happiness by being actualized within a person. This
activity actualizes our highest, specifically human, potential
and, thereby, cannot help but bring supreme happiness. Both the
Bahá’í and Aristotelian concepts of happiness are process
concepts of happiness, i.e. happiness is found in the process of

164                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

drawing nearer to God or the universal “object of desire” and,
thereby, actualizing one’s potentials.

In our view, the Writings see the deepest motivation is to
attain happiness but, as we shall see, the Bahá’í concept of
happiness must not be confused with comfort and lazy
contentment or immediate, short-term pleasure or avoidance of
unpleasant and challenging undertakings. Regarding happiness,
Bahá’u’lláh asserts “whatsoever are the effective means for
safeguarding and promoting the happiness and welfare of the
children of men have already been revealed by the Pen of
Glory.” [TB 220] Elsewhere, He says, “We desire but the good of
the world and the happiness of the nations.” [PB, n.p.] “Abdu’l-
Bahá declares,

> The primary purpose, the basic objective, in laying down
> powerful laws and setting up great principles and
> institutions dealing with every aspect of civilization, is
> human happiness; and human happiness consists only in
> drawing closer to the Threshold of Almighty God. [SDC
> 60]

These beliefs are succinctly encapsulated in the assertion that
“Bahá’u’lláh has brought you divine happiness.” [PUP 188] In
regards to the individual ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> The purpose of these statements is to make it abundantly
> clear that the Divine religions, the holy precepts, the
> heavenly teachings, are the unassailable basis of human
> happiness, and that the peoples of the world can hope
> for no real relief or deliverance without this one great
> remedy.58

He also advises individuals to

> Seek ye divine happiness through the hardships and
> sorrows of this physical world, and behold spiritual well-
> being in the struggles of this fleeting existence. Distill

> sugar and honey from the bitter poison of suffering.
> Recognize the caress of divine favor in the arrows of
> misfortune.59

In other words, the kind of happiness envisaged by the
Writings is not the secular happiness of comfort or even calm
and contented stasis In fact, every revelation at least to some
extent, is intended to bring a certain amount of ‘divine
discomfort’ and to awaken us from our moral and spiritual
complacency and slumbers; to encourage us to make greater
efforts to actualize our spiritual potentials, and to attain
spiritual happiness even amidst physical and worldly
discomfort. [PUP 341] Of course, the happiness we seek must be
the happiness of our spiritual nature which can only be attained
by pursuing ‘the good.’ In other words, the Writings require the
dynamic happiness of growth and developmental struggle and
actualizing our intrinsic human nature as we seek ‘the good,’ i.e.
God. In regards to its final cause, such happiness is found in
drawing nearer to God. In other words, happiness and well-
being lie in the struggle itself. It is not a happiness and well-
being that can be achieved once and for all because the effort
itself — no matter at what spiritual level — is the happiness we
seek. The surest way to lose this happiness is to stop trying.

10: Virtue Ethics

As Udo Schaefer demonstrates in Bahá’í Ethics in Light of
Scripture, Volume 2, the Bahá’í Writings espouse a form of
virtue ethics. Virtue ethics have a long and rich tradition
beginning with Aristotle60 in the West but also developed in
Islamic and Buddhist ethics.61 In addition, it has a substantial
history in Chinese Confucian philosophy.62 Consequentially,
virtue ethics may serve as a bridge from the Bahá’í Writings to
other religious and philosophical traditions in various parts of
the world. After several centuries of decline in the West, virtue
ethics have undergone a growing revival since the last half of
the twentieth century, thanks especially to three women

166                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

philosophers, G.E.M. Anscombe, Philippa Foot and Rosalind
Hursthouse.63

Virtue ethics differ from other meta-ethical systems because
of the belief that good, i.e. virtuous, behavior can only be
expected from a good character who pursues happiness in the
appropriate way.

> [I]t is generally agree that virtue ethics maintains that
> character, human excellences, virtues are the basic mode
> of evaluation in the theory, as opposed to act
> evaluations such as “right” and “wrong.” It is important
> to note that many virtue ethicists do not believe the
> theory to be incompatible with act evaluation at all.
> Rather, act evaluation is to be understood in terms of
> character evaluation.64

The key to good ethical behavior is for us to acquire the
virtues that are suitable to us as human beings, i.e. “rational
souls” with both a material and spiritual aspect, whose prime
purpose is to “know God and to love Him.” In the words of
Philippa Foot, one of the modern revivers of virtue ethics,

> Natural goodness as I define it, which is attributable
> only to living things themselves and to their parts,
> characteristics and operations is intrinsic or
> ‘autonomous’ goodness in that it depends directly on the
> relation of the individual to the ‘life form’ of its
> species.65

In other words, “natural goodness” is based on how well we
actualize the essential attributes of our species, i.e., of the kind
of creatures we are. For humans, building a good character who
can be relied upon to act virtuously and with the right
motivations is thought to be more effective in dealing with a
constantly changing world than trying to determine the right
action by assessing the greatest good for the greatest number or
the applicability of categorical imperatives or developing one’s

own unique scheme of values. “Not the rule follower, then, but
the person disposed by character to be generous, caring,
compassionate ... is the one we will hold up as a moral model.”66
Virtue ethics contrast “with modernist attempts to ground
morality in subjective preference or in abstract principles of
reason.”67 We know what the necessary virtues are because we
know human nature and what it needs to flourish, not only for
ourselves alone but as members of society, and, as the Writings
would point out, as a spiritual and immortal being made in the
image of God. The result of actualizing especially our highest
potentials will keep us in harmony with natural law and will
bring us the right kind of happiness. In other words, we need
only follow our teleological nature.

As the foregoing description shows, the virtue ethics depends
on the underlying theory of human nature, and on this score,
Bahá’í virtue theory, while similar to Aristotle’s in many
important respects as we have just seen, also differ from him on
a crucial issue of human nature. In fact, on the issue of feeling
and sympathy, the Bahá’í view converges with some Confucian
Chinese philosophers who put a great emphasis on sympathy and
“connectedness with others”68 and overcoming the false view
that we are ‘atomic,’ i.e. completely separate individuals.
Consequently, having a somewhat different view of human
nature means that the virtues to be cultivated differs.

There is no need to go into detail about the importance of
character in the Bahá’í Writings. The following advice from
‘Abdu’l-Bahá urges mothers to train their children “to have a
goodly character and good morals, guide them to all the virtues
of humankind, prevent the development of any behaviour that
would be worthy of blame.”69 Similarly, he says,

> Training in morals and good conduct is far more
> important than book learning. A child that is cleanly,
> agreeable, of good character, well-behaved — even
> though he be ignorant — is preferable to a child that is
> rude, unwashed, ill-natured, and yet becoming deeply
168                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> versed in all the sciences and arts. The reason for this is
> that the child who conducts himself well, even though he
> be ignorant, is of benefit to others, while an ill-natured,
> ill-behaved child is corrupted and harmful to others,
> even though he be learned. If, however, the child be
> trained to be both learned and good, the result is light
> upon light.70

The issue could not be stated more clearly.

In our view, there is no point in reviewing Udo Schaefer’s
magnificent categorization of the Bahá’í virtues in Bahá’í Ethics
in Light of Scripture, Volume 2. Given the nature of this survey
paper, there is nothing to add at this point. The case for virtue
ethics in the Bahá’í Writings could not be made more clearly.

11: Consequentialism and Utilitarianism

Among modern meta-ethical theories, consequentialism and
its main representative, utilitarianism also share the Bahá’í
Writings’ goal of happiness. In this sense, there is a convergence
between the Writings and consequentialism and utilitarianism.
We shall examine the differences below.

For consequentialism itself, happiness is one possible
outcome by which we may evaluate the morality of an action. It
is not focused solely on happiness; it is focused on achieving the
“right kinds of overall consequences”71 even if these do not
always lead to unadulterated happiness, e.g. a root canal or
victory in WW II. The “right kinds of consequences” are those
leading to the goals we wish to or need to achieve. Morality is
identified with these results. Tom. L Beauchamp adds,

> Consequentialism asserts that actions are right or wrong
> according to their consequences, rather than because of
> any intrinsic features they may have such as truthfulness
> or beauty. There are several types of utilitarian theory,
> but they hold in common that the rightness or wrongness

> of actions and practices is determined solely by their
> consequences; what makes an action morally right or
> wrong is the total good or evil it produces. This
> contention distinguishes utilitarianism from ethical
> theories maintaining that the act itself has moral value
> part from the good or evil produced.72

Utilitarianism, on the other hand, is concerned only with the
consequence of happiness or pleasure. According to John Stuart
Mill, the best known proponent of utilitarianism,

> The creed which accepts, as the foundation of morals,
> Utility, or the Greatest-happiness Principle, holds that
> actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote
> happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of
> happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure and the
> absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain and privation of
> pleasure.73

Mill’s idea obviously implies that actions must be judged by
their consequences for happiness and unhappiness.

From a Bahá’í perspective, consequentialism and utilitarian-
ism put the cart before the horse: an action is not good because
it leads to positive results and/or makes us happy but it leads to
positive results and/or makes us happy because God’s authority
makes it good. The rightness or goodness of moral injunctions
is ensured by the inherent legitimacy, authority, universality
bestowed by God’s commands. These are precisely the “intrinsic
features” which make an act good. If moral commands do not
exemplify harmony with God’s Will, i.e. if they are not based on
God’s legitimacy, authority and universality, they are not right
or good regardless of their seemingly positive consequences
and/or happiness to which they lead. (Once again, we recall the
“hospital scenario.) In other words, positive, happy
consequences alone — even if they benefit a majority — are not
sufficient to make a command or an action moral. The moral

170                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

rightness of an act is not intrinsic to it but comes from God’s
Will.

Because actions must reflect the intrinsic goodness of God’s
commands in addition to producing happiness, Bahá’í ethics
also avoid the problem of the end justifying the means. No
matter how much happiness or supposed positive results an
action may bring, it is not moral if it violates God’s command.
Indeed, there may be actions society considers socially good or
acceptable that do not agree with God’s commands, and,
therefore, even though they appear to bring happiness at least in
the short-run, will not bring “the greatest good for the greatest
number” in the long run. These seemingly positive actions may
be spiritually bad.

This means that from a Bahá’í perspective, the positive social
utility or consequences are not sufficient to make an action
good. Furthermore, the utilitarian and consequentialist view is
incomplete because it only concerns itself with one aspect of
human nature and society — namely our material and not our
spiritual well-being. However, the Bahá’í Writings indicate such
an incomplete understanding of human nature inevitably leads
to negative results and/or unhappiness for individuals and
societies. Such truncated views of human nature are unrealistic
because, in this case, the spiritual nature of man will eventually
demand its due and if this is not forthcoming, serious problems
will arise. For their part, the Bahá’í Writings recognize that
both our material as well as spiritual natures must be satisfied
and developed.

Of course, because God’s moral commands reflect His love
for His creation, they also benefit humankind and bring
happiness. However, happiness may not always conform to our
pre-conceptions; positive results make take unexpected forms.
This is where the Bahá’í Writings distinguish themselves from
utilitarianism in particular: the Writings do not necessarily
regard suffering — be it physical or spiritual — as always
inherently bad. This puts them at odds with utilitarian ethics

which see happiness as the standard for morality. In regards to
suffering, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states,

> The labourer cuts up the earth with his plough, and from
> that earth comes the rich and plentiful harvest. The more
> a man is chastened, the greater is the harvest of spiritual
> virtues shown forth by him. [PT 51]

As Bahá’u’lláh says,

> O Thou Whose tests are a healing medicine to such as are
> nigh unto Thee, Whose sword is the ardent desire of all
> them that love Thee ... I implore Thee, by Thy divine
> sweetness and by the splendors of the glory of Thy face,
> to send down upon us from Thy retreats on high that
> which will enable us to draw nigh unto Thee. [PM 220]

In the Arabic Hidden Words, God states, “My calamity is My
providence, outwardly it is fire and vengeance, but inwardly it
is light and mercy.”74 Events that feel bad “outwardly” i.e. in a
worldly sense, are not necessarily bad because they lead to
positive spiritual results. The negative outward experiences may
be the means to a greater, i.e. happier spiritual goal.

A worldly illustration of this is a training camp for a hockey
team. Recruits are put through strenuous even ‘unfair’ physical
and psychological suffering but in the process of suffering they
actualize and develop their skills, they acquire the discipline of
being part of a team and they develop an all important ‘team-
spirit’ necessary for success. Are they happy? Indeed, they are,
even when they are uncomfortable — because we should never
confuse comfort with happiness. They are happy because they
are doing what it is in their nature to do i.e. they have a
teleological happiness (despite the distress and anxiety) that is
not in the utilitarian world-view. In this sense, they have
Aristotle’s well-being or eudemonia which is foreign to Bentham
and Mill’s utilitarianism. A consequentialist might be able to
accept such a concept of teleological happiness up to a point —

172                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

but s/he will not be able to accept the spiritual results which
must also count as consequences to be evaluated. In our view,
the Bahá’í view of happiness is, theologically speaking, closeness
to God and philosophically speaking the fullest possible
actualization of our spiritual and physical capacities. This
becomes clearer when we distinguish between being comfortable
and contented and having growing pains which inevitably move
us closer towards completion and maturity.

In the Bahá’í view, there is, ultimately, really only one way to
attain happiness in its fullest measure and that is to fulfill our
final cause which is know God and to worship Him as sated by
the Noonday Prayer. Without fulfilling our final cause we
cannot truly be our true selves, i.e. we cannot fulfill our own
purpose and destiny and, therefore, remain deeply alienated
from our own lives. In that case, how can we be anything but
incomplete, unfulfilled — in a word, unhappy? If we are
unhappy at such a fundamental level, it is difficult to see how
we can bring genuine happiness to others. Thus, the prime or
foundational motivation is intrinsic, i.e. spiritual self-
actualization, i.e. knowing and worshipping God, which is the
necessary and sufficient condition for carrying out the mandate
to help spiritual healing to the world. This second motivation is
extrinsic. Both kinds of motivation are necessary and present
but the order is architectonic: knowing and worshipping God is
the foundation from which other motives must develop. To
actualize our final cause we must follow the Manifestation for
our age.

12\. Kant’s Deontology and the Bahá’í Writings

In Groundwork of a Metaphysic of Morals (1797), Immanuel
Kant presents his theory of deontological meta-ethics according
to which morals must be based solely on a priori reasoning
about duty or obligations. He defines duty as “the necessity to
act out of reverence for the law.”75 Moreover, in contradiction
to consequentialism, utilitarianism or pragmatism, he believes

that “Empirical principles are always unfitted to serve as a
ground for moral laws”76 because of ever-changing
circumstances. He also wants to avoid any dependence on
religious revelation as a basis of ethics. His final position is
simple: only when we do our duty for the sake of doing our
duty can we be moral. A good act performed out of fear or
ambition or even love may be ‘right’ but it is not moral.77 Kant
writes,

> Therefore, nothing but the idea of the law in itself,
> which admittedly is present on in a rational being ... can
> constitute that pre-eminent good which we call moral, a
> good which is already present in the person acting on
> this idea and has not to be awaited merely from the
> result.78

A few comments are in order before going further. From a
Bahá’í perspective, Kant’s meta-ethic is built on poor
foundations insofar as the Writings do not regard human reason
alone as a sufficient basis for morals. Because of its inherent
limitations, reason cannot meet the problems of legitimacy and
power that we have explored above. What human being can
claim to have the legitimacy, i.e. the complete knowledge, the
infallible understanding and the infinite goodness to make
absolute judgments about moral acts and to demand our
adherence to his/her laws? Moreover, since legitimacy without
power is impotent, what human being can claim to have the
power to impose his/her moral rules in one way or another by
means of consequences?79 Who has the power necessary to
enable people everywhere to follow these rules despite their
short-comings and weaknesses? At this point it is already clear
that the Bahá’í Writings are at odds with Kant’s deontological
meta-ethics.

Another reason for the difference between the Writings and
Kant’s deontology is the teleological foundation of the Bahá’í
meta-ethic. The teleological nature of humankind means that
our actions are aimed at achieving a certain goal and for this

174                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

reason alone are not done strictly for the sake of duty itself as
required by Kant’s ethics. Acting for love of God — as advised
in the Noonday Prayer — also prevents action purely for the
sake of duty itself.

At this point it is important to avoid confusing the good will
which Kant posits as the foundation of truly moral action and
deontologic ethics. According to Kant, “It is impossible to
conceive anything at all in the world, or even out of it which
can be taken as good without qualification, except a good
will.”80 All other virtues depend on good will. In the Arabic
Hidden Words, Bahá’u’lláh states

O SON OF SPIRIT!

> My first counsel is this: Possess a pure, kindly and
> radiant heart, that thine may be a sovereignty ancient,
> imperishable and everlasting.81

This is the foundation in which our actions and moral
reasoning should rest. On this matter the Writings and Kant are
in agreement. However, saying that actions must be based on
good will and a “pure, kindly and radiant heart” is not the same
as saying that an action must be performed for its own sake and
not for any other goal, teleologic or otherwise. Basing actions
on good will does not lead to a deontologic view of ethics in the
Bahá’í case.

Kant’s statement about the foundation of good will reveals
another deficiency in Kant’s meta-ethics. Just how is good will
or purity of heart to be attained? What are the necessary and
sufficient conditions for acquiring it? Kant is silent on this issue
— and for that reason his deontological meta-ethic lacks a solid
foundation which it cannot explain. The Bahá’í Writings, on the
other hand, do not have this problem in as much as good will
towards our fellow man is generated by our love for God.

> Love the creatures for the sake of God and not for
> themselves. You will never become angry or impatient if
> you love them for the sake of God. Humanity is not
> perfect ... if you look toward God, you will love them
> and be kind to them, for the world of God is the world
> of perfection and complete mercy. [PUP 92]

It is worth noting that this fits in well with divine command
theory which makes God, not humanity, the center and basis of
all ethics.

Kant has three rules or categorical imperatives, i.e. rules
without exceptions, in order to help us identify what our duty
is. We already know that it cannot be the consequences of an
act since an action is good in and of itself whatever the
consequences might be. In other words,

> Certain kinds of acts are intrinsically right and other
> kinds intrinsically wrong. The rightness or wrongness of
> any particular act is thus not (or not wholly) determined
> by the goodness or badness of its consequences.82

The first form of the categorical imperative states, “Act only
on that maxim through which you can at the same time will that
it should become a universal law.”83 In everyday language, we
appeal to this form of the imperative when we ask about a
behavior, ‘What if everybody else did that?” The obvious
implication is that if an act is not all right for everyone, it is
not all right for any individual. As common sense guidance this
form of the categorical imperative is good — as long as
universal good will remains foundational. From a Bahá’í
perspective, the first form of the categorical imperative is not
so much ‘wrong’ as insufficient because it is ‘empty,’ i.e. it
prescribes nothing in particular, and even worse, as a standard
for judging moral acts it only rules out hypocrisy. Any action
can pass this test as long as we are willing to allow others to do
the same. Indeed, like some revolutionaries — Lenin for
example, we can convince ourselves that our harsh deeds were

176                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

examples of good will in the long run. A moral maxim that, in
the last analysis, only rules out hypocrisy is not specific enough
to genuinely practical. It is just too wishy-washy.

The second of Kant’s categorical imperatives states,

> Act in such a way that you always treat humanity,
> whether in your own person or in the person of any
> other, never simply as a means but always at the same
> time as an end.84

In short, we should not use people only for our own
advantage. Of course, we all use people in some way by hiring
them to work for us, but by paying them fairly, we also treat
them as ends. The second form of the categorical imperative is
clearly in agreement with the Writings insofar as everyone is an
‘end’ and, therefore, innately valuable and to be cherished. This
harmonizes with the Bahá’í belief that all humans are made in
the image of God, although, of course, Kant does not say so.
Moreover, the harmonization with the Writings is clear vis-à-vis
treating each individual as an “end,” in a way that is conducive
to their spiritual growth and actualization of their “spiritual
susceptibilities” as well as other gifts.

The third form of the categorical imperative states,

> A rational being must always regard himself as making
> laws in a kingdom of ends which is possible through
> freedom of the will — whether it be as a member or as a
> head.85

The “kingdom of ends” refers to a mental construct of a
kingdom, “a systematic union of rational beings under common
objective law”86 in which members are both means and ends in
their relation to one another. In the “kingdom of ends” the
three forms of the categorical imperative are the common
rational laws by which people judge their own and each others’
actions. From our perspective on the Bahá’í Writings, the

concept of the “kingdom of ends” is interesting because it
invites people to think of themselves as members of an ideal
community and to act as if such were real in the here and now.
In short, it helps us to improve or ‘idealize’ our behavior and
speech. This — in our view — is exactly what we strive for in our
Bahá’í communities: an idealized community which encourages
us to practice speech and action in accordance with the
Writings.

In our view, the major problem with Kant’s meta-ethical
approach is its absolute reliance on reason. The Writings
obviously reject the concept that reason alone is a sufficient
basis for meta-ethics since that would obviate any need for God
or the Manifestations in humanity’s ethical life. Another
problem is the non-teleological view of human nature. Kant’s
presentation of his meta-ethical theory in Groundwork of the
Metaphysic of Morals lacks any mention or even hint that
humanity has as natural and super-natural vocation, and,
therefore, leaves out significant aspects of human nature that
must be accounted for in ethics. In short, while Kant’s theory is
clear and logically coherent, it has a tendency to be a Procrustes’
Bed that oversimplifies ethical issues as we have already seen
vis-à-vis good will and the first form of the categorical
imperative.

13\. A Non-Naturalist Meta-ethic

In 1903, G.E. Moore published Principia Ethica, one of the
key texts in modern and contemporary ethics. Moore’s “mode
of inquiry was later to be known as metaethic — the
philosophizing about the very terms of ethics and considering
the structure of ethics as an object of inquiry.”87 Moore had a
startlingly simple suggestion: ethics is “the general enquiry into
what is good.”88 The ‘good,’ however, turns out to be more
difficult to identify than we might think. Moreover, he rejected
as “the naturalist fallacy” any attempt to reduce or explain the
meaning of ‘the good’ in such empirical or natural terms as the

178                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

practical, or the greatest good for the greatest number, or
conformity to natural law or any other empirical terms. This
because we cannot reduce ethical terms to non-ethical terms
without falling into a logical category mistake, i.e. conflating
and confusing two different kinds of things, such as horse shoes
and sea cucumbers. Doing so leads to mistaken conclusions.
Moore writes,

> My point is that good is a simple notion, just as yellow
> is a simple notion; that, just as you cannot, by any
> manner of means, explain to anyone who does not
> already know it, what yellow is, so you cannot explain
> what good is.89

The ‘good’ is a simple fact and cannot be broken down and
explained in simpler terms. Like the color yellow, it is either
apprehended it is not. No amount of explanation can make a
blind man understand what yellow is, and no naturalist,
empirical explanation can inform us what the good is. Moore
identifies the attempt to offer such empirical accounts of the
‘good’ as “the naturalistic fallacy.”90 Such accounts are
fallacious because they confuse and conflate (1) what is
empirical with (2) what is ethical. Like Hume, Moore maintains
these two orders or kinds of things are not and cannot be
related. Unless we are working in a theistic system ‘is’ cannot
lead to ‘ought.’ Thus, even though an action has positive
consequences, is desirable and/or pragmatic we cannot
necessarily conclude that an action is ‘good.’

According to Moore, our understanding of ‘the good’ must
come by strictly non-natural, non-empirical means, such as an
insight into Platonic Ideas. Moore himself seems to take such a
Platonic position, stating,

> The Ethics of Plato are distinguished by upholding, far
> more clearly and consistently than any other system, the
> view that intrinsic value belongs exclusively to those

> states of mind which consist in love of what is good or
> hatred of what is evil.91

The Bahá’í Writings both agree and disagree with Moore. The
fact that Moore’s ‘good’ transcends empirical knowledge
corresponds to the fact that in the Writings God, Who is the
good, also transcends empirical knowledge. Because the ‘good’
is transcendent, it is obvious that no empirical and naturalistic
characterizations of it will be adequate. That is why God is
essentially unknowable. Moore’s intuitionism — the sense of
knowing directly without empirical explanation of evidence —
finds its counterpart in the Bahá’í teaching that inspiration
from the “spirit of faith” is necessary to attain true knowledge.
This applies not just to the things we can reason about but to
spiritual truths as well. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> But the human spirit [the rational soul], unless assisted
> by the spirit of faith, does not become acquainted with
> the divine secrets and the heavenly realities. It is like a
> mirror which, although clear, polished and brilliant, is
> still in need of light. Until a ray of the sun reflects upon
> it, it cannot discover the heavenly secrets.92

Knowledge of ‘the good’ may be reasonably seen as part of
the “divine secrets and the heavenly realities.” Until reason is
augmented by the spirit of faith, we are “veiled souls” [SAQ 239]
unable to recognize or intuit the good or intuit the good to our
fullest capacity. In other words, there comes a point at which
humans simply have to recognize or intuit the existence of the
good the way they recognize the sun — not by argument but by
looking. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says about the immortality of the
soul:

> if the inner sight becomes opened, and the spiritual
> hearing strengthened, and the spiritual feelings
> predominant, he will see the immortality of the spirit as
> clearly as he sees the sun.93
180                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

Similarly, when our spiritual sight is opened, we will ‘see’ or
intuit the existence of God Who is also the ultimate good. We
will do so without benefit of inferential reasoning. Although by
different paths, the Bahá’í Writings and Moore’s moral
intuitionism converge.

However, the Bahá’í position incorporates both Moore’s
intuitionist view and naturalistic ethics, a position made
possible by theism. The created empirical world is totally
suffused with the signs and signatures of God’s Will which in
itself is a sign of ‘the good.’

> Such is their virtue that not a single atom in the entire
> universe can be found which doth not declare the
> evidences of His might, which doth not glorify His holy
> Name, or is not expressive of the effulgent light of His
> unity.94

With such a proliferation of evidence of God’s Will, it is
hard to resist the conclusion that we also gain some idea of ‘the
good’ by observation and reason. Such conceptions of ‘the
good’ are, of course, limited but they are able to tell us
something about ‘the good.’ However, such knowledge of the
good is tentative, incomplete and inadequate for the evolution
of humankind. It may be described as a ‘lure’ to direct our
thoughts and feelings in a spiritual direction but in itself, is not
adequate as knowledge of ‘the good.’ For such knowledge, and
even better knowledge of the signs of God’s Will in nature, our
“spiritual susceptibilities” must be awakened and our reasoning
must be inspired as we have discussed above.

Several important consequences follow from the foregoing
discussion. First, the Bahá’í Writings are able to form a bridge
between Moore’s non-cognitivist meta-ethics and various moral
cognitivist theories. Second, the transcendent nature of ‘the
good’ ensures that this value is objective and mind-independent
in itself; it does not depend on us for its existence or nature and
in that sense, it is like a Platonic Idea of which humans only

grasp fleeting images. Finally, ‘the good’ itself is changeless, like
the “eternal verities.” Of course, our perspective on ‘the good’
changes — but the change is in us, not in ‘the good.’

14\. Moral Cognitivism (Ethical Realism) or Non-
cognitivism

Perhaps the most basic division in meta-ethics is between
cognitive and non-cognitive theories. All ethical theories
advocate or tend towards one or the other. Moral cognitivism
(or moral realism) refers to

> Ethical theories that hold that there is knowledge of
> moral facts and that normative ethical judgments can be
> said to be true or false. Cognitivism includes the
> majority of traditional ethical theories. In contrast, non-
> cognitivism,     represented      by    emotivism       and
> prescriptivism, holds that moral statements do not
> possess truth-values and cannot be known.95

Another way of approaching this subject is to ask,

> Is there moral knowledge? (And also, do moral
> statements make knowledge claims?) [as well as] Is there
> moral truth? (And also, do moral judgments make truth
> claims?)96

In both of these descriptions of cognitive meta-ethics the key
issue is whether or not moral truths exist mind-independently,
or whether all moral statements are merely subjective opinions
with no objective content. If such truths are objective, then
they are obviously mind-independent and their essences not
determined by human observers. (Human observers may have
different perspectives on such truths but that does not affect
the essence or nature of the truth itself.) As Andrew Fisher says,
“To be a moral realist is to think that moral properties are real
and that these properties are in some sense independent of what

182                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

people think.”97 Neither individual thought nor collective
cultural beliefs can make or negate objective moral truths.
Furthermore, cognitivism holds there are objectively real moral
properties, qualities or attributes that we can associate with
such terms as ‘good,’ ‘evil,’ ‘true’ or ‘false.’ This, of course, is
at odds with G.E. Moore’s central claim that ‘the good’ cannot
be related to anything else. Finally, according to moral
cognitivism, moral judgments can be true or false, which means
that moral judgments can assert truth claims.

In the Bahá’í Writings, it is clear that humans are not the
creators of their own morals. We receive our morals from God,
which, of course, makes them completely mind-independent as
well as ontologically real and objective. In this sense, the Bahá’í
Writings converge with Plato’s theory that ‘goodness’ or ‘the
good’ has objective existence in the supersensible world of
Ideas just as the moral teachings revealed by the Manifestations
reflects God’s knowledge about what is ethically good for
humankind. What God knows to be true and best for us (as
revealed by the Manifestations) cannot help but be real and
objective, i.e. cannot help but exist independently from human
perception, belief and judgment. How could we rely on
ourselves to invent morals when we inherently lack the divine
omnipotence which enables God to know what moral standards
are best suited to the human nature He has created?

In sharp contrast to cognitivism, non-cognitivism rejects all
of the foregoing assertions. Non-cognitivism maintains that the
truth (or falsity) of moral propositions is mind-dependent, i.e.
depends on the individual or collective making the proposition.
Truth or falsity are not objective and cannot be proven true or
untrue. There are no real i.e. mind-independent moral qualities
or attributes that can be used to prove or disprove a moral
judgment. One of the most famous non-cognitive meta-ethical
theories is A. J. Ayer’s emotivism according to which ethical
statements do not describe anything, i.e. they do not tell us
what something is like and they do not prescribe anything i.e.
they do not show us any obligation. According to Ayer’s

emotivism, moral ‘statements’ really only express feelings.
“Murder is bad” really means nothing more than “Murder —
Boo! Hiss!” Obviously such statements cannot be judged as
either true or false because there is no way to verify them, they
are purely subjective i.e. mind-dependent, and have no real
moral content. All they tell us is that someone disapproves of
murder — which is not in itself an ethical statement. There is no
possibility here of identifying good and evil in the acts
themselves because such moral content must be extraneously by
us. Clearly, the meaning of ‘good’ has been reduced to an
exclamation without any intellectual content about the nature
of ‘good’ or its distinction from ‘evil.’

In our view, Bahá’í meta-ethics            exemplify    ethical
cognitivism. `Abdu’l-Bahá points out that

> [e]ach of the divine religions embodies two kinds of
> ordinances. The first is those which concern spiritual
> susceptibilities, the development of moral principles and
> the quickening of the conscience of man. These are
> essential or fundamental, one and the same in all
> religions, changeless and eternal — reality not subject to
> transformation. [PUP 106]

Nothing here suggests that humans create or invent these
fundamental moral values on their own or, indeed, have any
kind of influence on them. They are ‘platonic’ insofar as they
transcend the phenomenal realm although they should not be
understood as Platonic Ideas present in their own realm.
However, there is no question that they are mind-independent,
are real and objective and have real content in and of
themselves.

`Abdu’l-Bahá declares that the first of two kinds of
ordinances

> constitute essential, or spiritual, teachings of the Word
> of God. These are faith in God, the acquirement of the
184                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> virtues    which    characterize     perfect    manhood,
> praiseworthy moralities, the acquisition of the bestowals
> and bounties emanating from the divine effulgences — in
> brief, the ordinances which concern the realm of morals
> and ethics.98

It should be noted that `Abdu’l-Bahá refers to the virtues we
need as “the ordinances which concern the realm of morals and
ethics.99 These, he tells us, come from God. Moreover, to attain
“perfect manhood” — a concept which also implies an objective
standard by which to judge — we must acquire certain attributes
and ethical qualities. The key is that we must acquire them from
the “Word of God,” not that we should invent or choose them
for themselves. Humans have no role in deciding the nature of
“perfect manhood” or of “praiseworthy moralities.” `Abdu’l-
Bahá also makes it clear that humanity is completely dependent
on the Manifestations for our knowledge of ethics. They are the
“divine Educators” [PUP 345] of humankind.

> The holy Manifestations of God come into the world to
> dispel the darkness of the animal, or physical, nature of
> man, to purify him from his imperfections in order that
> his heavenly and spiritual nature may become quickened,
> his divine qualities awakened, his perfections visible, his
> potential powers revealed and all the virtues of the
> world of humanity latent within him may come to life.
> These holy Manifestations of God are the Educators and
> Trainers of the world of existence, the Teachers of the
> world of humanity. They liberate man from the darkness
> of the world of nature, deliver him from despair, error,
> ignorance, imperfections and all evil qualities. They
> clothe him in the garment of perfections and exalted
> virtue ... Man is base, treacherous and mean; the
> Manifestations of God uplift him into dignity, nobility
> and loftiness.100

The values brought by the Manifestations are remedies for
our “despair, error, ignorance, imperfections and all evil
qualities,” i.e. it is the Manifestations and not human beings
who bring these values. The fact that “[m]an is base,
treacherous and mean” shows that we lack the ability to
identify, awaken, actualize and establish the values that are
appropriate for us. That is why the Manifestations are
necessary. This, too, shows that humans do not invent their
fundamental values.

For his part, Shoghi Effendi also refers to objective, mind-
independent ethics when he writes, “But when true religion is
combined with true ethics, then moral progress becomes a
possibility and not a mere ideal.”101 He also says, “We should
take our stand on a higher plane of moral and spiritual life and,
setting for them the true example, urge them up to our level.”102
Here, too, we observe both directly and by implication that
there are, indeed, moral truths and even a hierarchy of moral
development about which we can have genuine knowledge.

These and other statements make it clear that humans are not
the creators of their own morals. We receive our morals from
God, which, of course, makes them completely mind-
independent as well as ontologically real and objective. In this
sense, the Bahá’í Writings converge with Plato’s theory that
‘goodness’ or ‘the good’ has objective existence in the
supersensible world of Ideas just as the moral teachings revealed
by the Manifestations reflects God’s knowledge about what is
ethically good for humankind. What God knows to be true and
best for us (as revealed by the Manifestations) cannot help but
be real and objective, i.e. cannot help but exist independently
from human perception, belief and judgment. How could we
rely on ourselves to invent morals when we inherently lack the
divine omnipotence which enables God to know what moral
standards are best suited to the human nature He has created?

186                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

14\.1 Subjectivity and Relativism

It may be argued that subjectivity and, in that sense, non-
cognitivism enters Bahá’í ethics insofar as people are entitled to
their own understanding of the Manifestation’s moral
pronouncements or the declarations of His authorized
interpreters. Everyone has a right to such personal
understanding and no individual has the right to insist on the
acceptance of his or her viewpoints. However, it is just as
important to remember that having rights does not make our
opinions immune from analysis or critique as indicated by
`Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement that “The shining spark of truth
cometh forth only after the clash of differing opinions.” [SWAB
87] In other words, while we all have the right to our own
understandings, there is no necessary expectation to exemption
from respectful analysis. Moreover, having a right to a certain
understandings does not guarantee that all understandings are
equally well supported by the Writings or equally well reasoned
or equally relevant to a passage.103 In other words, the Writings
do not forbid clashing opinions but they do forbid an insistence
that others must accept our views. Finally, it should be noted
that not all understandings are cognitive — some may be
emotive or may express attitudes instead of making declarative
propositions about ethics or the world. Since such
understandings or interpretations are not cognitive, they cannot
be declared to be true or false.

The right to hold our own understandings is a de jure right
belonging to the person and not to the argument s/he is making.
This should not be confused with relativism which asserts that
all view are true or must be regarded as true from some
perspective and that we have no standard by which to judge
moral actions. If that were the case, we would have to reject
`Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement that “we must train the immature to
proper or true moral standards: Some have unworthy morals; we
must train them toward the standard of true morality.”104 There
are objective, “changeless and eternal” [PUP 106] moral rights

and wrongs, i.e. the “eternal verities” which the Manifestations
provide for our use. Declaring some people to be “immature” in
a moral sense also implies that there exists an object, mind-
independent standard by which to make a judgment. The
existence of “true” morals is a claim that negates any notion
that all moral positions can be considered correct from some
particular point of view. If values had no objective and real
status and could not be known with some degree of accuracy,
then the Writings would be useless in providing moral guidance
since all such guidance would be reduced to conflicting
opinions that would only revive the tower of Babel.105

From the foregoing, it seems clear that we should not
confuse the right to personal opinion about the Writings with
relativism which is position about the truth-value of our
opinions. The first is unchallengeable insofar as it grows out of
the independent search for truth while the second is a logically
dubious position that makes ethical knowledge and unity
impossible and, as we have seen, is flatly contradicted by the
Writings. In ethics, relativism is especially dangerous because it
abolishes the difference between servants to humanity such as
Mother Teresa and servants of evil ideologies such as Dr.
Mengele — a problem also present in non-cognitivist ethics
where ethics are simply feelings or attitudes. The idea that the
differences between them are only a matter of perspective
seems perverse. Such a confusion is incompatible with the whole
purpose of the Writings which is to lift our morality above
those of Josef Mengele.

To conclude: the meta-ethics of Writings exemplify a
foundational cognitivism although there is some room for
subjectivity in the interpretation of moral guidance.

14\.2 Two Opponents to Bahá’í Cognitivism

Naturally, there are various non-cognitive or antirealist meta-
ethical theories that disagree with the Bahá’í Writings about the
truth and falsity of ethical propositions. One of these is the

188                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

influential meta-ethical view known as “error theory”106 which
asserts that without exception all ethical propositions,
judgments and injunctions are false. They report nothing about
the world, i.e. they are not knowledge, and, therefore, have no
truth value. They can neither be falsified nor confirmed. J.L.
Mackie, the main proponents of error theory writes,

> But the denial of objective values will have to be put
> forward ... as an ‘error theory,’ a theory that although
> most people in making moral judgments implicitly claim
> ... to be pointing to something objectively descriptive,
> these claims are all false. It is this that makes ‘moral
> scepticism’ appropriate.107

The most obvious consequence of J.L. Mackie’s statements is
that if moral propositions and judgments “are all false,” then
ethics ceases to exist as a subject. There is simply no point in
pursuing such so-called ‘knowledge’ and there is no validity in
trying to teach these judgments to others. Since error theory is
unable to say that any action is either moral or immoral, some
writers have identified it as a form of ethical nihilism,108 a
viewpoint with which we concur. Of course, this does not mean
that error theorists or ethical nihilists cannot judge whether an
action is socially useful, or pleasure-giving or convenient in a
utilitarian sense but those judgments would have to be made on
non-ethical grounds, and, therefore, are not really ethical in
nature. For example, we can say ‘Feeding the poor is good’ for
ethical reasons because it is morally positive to treat God’s
children well, or, we can say it is ‘good’ for law-and-order
reasons because it prevents food riots. The first statement is
untenable for Mackie, the second, non-ethical statement is
acceptable.

Error theory negates the purpose of the Manifestations to
teach us how to distinguish good from evil. Bahá’u’lláh exhorts
us to “Forsake all evil, hold fast that which is good” [TB 138] —
an impossible task if good and evil did not have objective
existence and if we cannot distinguish the two. The same can be

said of the statement that “the choice of good or evil belongs to
the man himself.” [SAQ 249] Indeed, if there were no objective
distinctions between good and evil, why would humans need a
Manifestation to reveal ethical rules to help our individual and
collective progress? How could we even believe in ethical
progress, i.e. advancement from lower to higher moral
development? There could be no “eternal verities” [PDC 108] for
successive Manifestations to reaffirm. In short, meta-ethical
error theory negates the very foundations of Bahá’í ethical
teachings and cannot be harmonized with them. Even of error
theory were to allow the Manifestations a special kind of ethical
knowledge, error theory still has to maintain that the way
humans interpret these exceptional pronouncements is
inherently false. Consequently, practicing ethics is impossible.

Postmodernism, in all its various forms, is another
philosophical movement that rejects the ethical cognitivism and
realism found in the Bahá’í Writings.109 In general terms, this
philosophy represents an

> an anti- (or post) epistemological standpoint; anti-
> essentialism; anti-foundationalism; opposition to
> transcendental       arguments       and      transcendental
> standpoints; rejection of the picture of knowledge as
> accurate representation; rejection of truth as
> correspondence to reality; rejection of the very idea of
> canonical descriptions, rejection of final vocabularies,
> i.e. rejection of principles, distinctions, and descriptions
> that are thought to be unconditionally binding for all
> times, persons, and places; and a suspicion of grand
> narratives, metanarratives of the sort perhaps best
> illustrated by dialectical materialism.110

This description shows why postmodernism is not compatible
with the Bahá’í Writings except in accidental features.111 Their
positions on various fundamental issues are antithetical and,
therefore, any similarities are coincidental rather than the
products of harmonious basic principles. The teleological view

190                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

of humanity and the definition of the human spirit as the
“rational soul” show that, postmodernism to the contrary, the
Writings clearly espouse essentialism, as does the natural law
meta-ethic. The Writings have a well-developed theory of man.
The Manifestations are not only privileged knowers but also
introduce “transcendental standpoints” into our ethical
discourse. The “eternal verities” and the “changeless and
eternal” guidance from the Manifestations is — postmodernism
notwithstanding — “binding for all times, persons, and places.”
Furthermore, ‘progressive revelation’ is exactly the kind of
grand or metanarrative that postmodernism rejects.
Furthermore, the tremendous emphasis on reason and the
rationality of religion and science in the Writings both in
empirical and spiritual matters has no counterpart in
postmodern literature. Finally, the Bahá’í Writings are
committed to finding the truth which corresponds to reality as
seen in the following declaration:

> It means that man must forget all hearsay and examine
> truth himself, for he does not know whether statements
> he hears are in accordance with reality or not. Wherever
> he finds truth or reality, he must hold to it, forsaking,
> discarding all else; for outside of reality there is naught
> but superstition and imagination.112

Elsewhere, he says, “we discover the realities of all things,”
[PUP 264]which means that our discoveries correspond to what is
‘out there.’ In addition, he asserts, “He has endowed him [man]
with mind, or the faculty of reasoning, by the exercise of which
he is to investigate and discover the truth, and that which he
finds real and true he must accept.”113 The very purpose of
reason is the discovery of truth: “God has created man in order
that he may perceive the verity of existence and endowed him
with mind or reason to discover truth.”114

Discovering the truth in the Writings includes discovering
the truth about ethics. This is precisely what Richard Rorty, one
of the quintessential postmodern philosophers, rejects. He sees

no value in objectivity which he dismisses as wanting a “sky-
hook provided by some contemporary yet-to-be-developed
science”115 to free us from the biases of being culture-bound
because he does not think we can ever escape being imprisoned
in our cultures. Therefore,

> [t]hose who wish to reduce objectivity to solidarity —
> call them “pragmatists” — do not require either a
> metaphysics or an epistemology. They view truths as, in
> William James’ phrase, what is good for us to believe. So
> they do not need an account of a relation between
> beliefs and objects called ‘correspondence’ nor an
> account of human cognitive abilities which ensures that
> our species is capable of entering into that relation ...
> For pragmatists, the desire for objectivity is not the
> desire to escape the limitations of one’s community but
> simply the desire to for as much intersubjective
> agreement as possible.116

When the idea of replacing the quest for truth in ethics is
replaced with the quest for solidarity — which is not an ethical
category but a political one, we have, perhaps reached the end
of ethics. In short, politics is to replace ethics since there is
really nothing to know — only a consensus to negotiate. On
Rorty’s view, philosophy cannot be a quest for ‘truth’ or ‘true
understanding’ since the most we can do is redescribe things to
our individual and/or collective liking and converse about our
various descriptions. In other words, the purpose of philosophy
is to be edifying: “I shall is ‘edification’ to stand for this project
of finding new, better, more interesting more fruitful ways of
speaking.”117 Edifying philosophy “takes its point of departure
from suspicion about the pretensions of epistemology,”118 i.e.,
edifying philosophy is not longer interested in attaining truth.119
Thus, rather than take part in an inquiry for the ‘knowledge,’
“we just might be saying something”120 simply in order to “keep
the conversation going rather than to find objective truth.”121
This, for Rorty is “a sufficient aim of philosophy.”122

192                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

The concept that ethics is merely “edifying” conversation
that just goes on — until we attain, for now, anyway —
solidarity, is wholly incompatible with the serious business of
ethics as seen in the Bahá’í Writings. The problem is that it is
incredibly dangerous. As people who have lived under the most
brutal dictatorships of the last century know, sometimes
solidarity with crowd is treason to humanity. Sometimes
solidarity with injustice is the last thing we want and is simply
unethical to the roots. Yet, by Rorty’s standards, we cannot
know which choice to make. Transforming the epistemological
and ethical into the political is not only a huge logical category
mistake, it is also a huge ethical mistake because it assumes that
ethics can be negotiated and bargained with in order to achieve
some compromise satisfactory to all. This kind of ‘solidarity’
should not be mistaken for the ‘unity’ taught by the Writings
which is based on commitment and obedience to God’s law and
guidance instead of a quest for an edifying conversation.

15: Conclusion

Our survey of the major meta-ethical theories makes it clear
that Bahá’í meta-ethics form a logically coherent and consistent
whole. While there is doubtlessly much more to be added as all
kinds of implications and inferences are pursued, the outlines of
Bahá’í meta-ethics are plainly visible. These ally the Writings
with foundationalism, natural law meta-ethics, non-
consequentialism, virtue ethics, ethical realism and objectivism,
divine command theory, eudaimonian ethics, cognitivism and
non-relativism.
