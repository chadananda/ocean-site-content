Báb í and Bah á’í M ater ials

Youli Ioannesyan

Baron V. R. Rosen after his death left behind a vast
collection of unpublished materials which among other things
are of extreme value for the study of the Bábí and Bahá’í Faiths
as well as for research on the Bábí and Bahá’í studies in Europe
especially for those interested in having an historical
perspective. These materials are preserved in the Archive of the
Russian Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg, Russia. They
comprise Rosen’s correspondence with A. G. Tumanski, E. G.
Browne (the larger part of the collection), Y. Batyushkov,
academic Oldenburg, V. I. Ignatyev, Sebastyan Vuarot, I.
Kheyrulláh.

Of special importance are      manuscripts (and copies of
manuscripts), official reports     of Russian diplomats from
Persia on the Bábís and reports   from Adrianople on the Bábís
residing there at the same time   when Bahá’u’lláh was exiled in
Adrianople.

It would be relevant to say a few words about the key figures
featuring in the given collection of materials.

A Russian aristocrat of German descent, Baron Victor
Romanovich Rosen (1849-1908) was an academic, professor of
Arabic, head of the Oriental Branch of the Russian
Archeological Society, and the translator of several Bahá’í
Writings into Russian. He prepared for publication in the
original Arabic and Persian a volume of Epistles by Bahá’u’lláh
and left profound descriptions of many Bábí and Bahá’í
manuscripts which now belong to the manuscript collection of
the St. Petersburg Branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies
of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Rosen also properly
identified some important Epistles such as the Surih-i-Muluk

12                      Rosen’s Collection of Bábí and Bahá’í Materials

(The Surih of the Kings) as revealed by Bahá’u’lláh. He
encouraged his students A. G. Tumanski and others to collect
and study materials related to the Bábí and Bahá’í Faiths.

Alexandr Grigoryevich Tumanski (born in 1861), who
belonged to an old Lithuanian aristocratic stock, was Rosen’s
student. When he was a young captain in the Russian Imperial
army, and while he was serving in the Turkistan region, namely
in Ashkabad, he came into close contact with the recently
established Bahá’í community there. He undertook a trip to
Persia arranged by Bahá’ís and sanctioned by the Russian
authorities to collect information about the Bahá’ís in Persia.
He was accompanied on his trip by his young wife, and his
journey to Persia at that time was a real adventure. Among
Tumanski’s good friends was prominent Bahá’í scholar Abu’l-
Fa∂l Gulpáygání. Tumanski was the first translator of the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas into a European language (Russian). According
to Professor Akimushkin of St. Petersburg, after the so called
Bolshevik October Revolution, Tumanski fled with his family
into Turkey and died in 1920 on the Prince Islands. His
descendents live in Belgium.

The third prominent figure whose correspondence is
contained in the archive is the British orientalist E. G. Browne,
who does not need any introduction. His letters to Rosen form
the largest part of the preserved correspondences in the
Archive. The above three figures were pioneers of the Bábí and
Bahá’í studies in Europe.

Also represented in the collection of materials are:
1\. Academic Oldenbourg, who mentions the Bábís in his

letter to Rosen;
2\. Vladimir Ivanovich Ignatyev — another of Rosen’s

> University students, diplomat working in Tehran,
> Ashkabad and Bukhara;
3\. Yu. Batyushkov — Persian and Arabic scholar and

diplomat working in Tehran in 1893-1899;
4\. Sebastian Vuarot — a French Bahá’í.

Let us now briefly describe the materials preserved in the
Archive collection. They consist of the following items:
1\. Tumanski’s letters to Rosen, which date 1892-1899. These

> comprise over 23 letters (in Russian). The latter deal with
> a wide range of issues: the Bábí community in Ashkabad,
> the translation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (and related issues),
> Tumanski’s trip to Persia and some information he
> gathered there about the Bahá’ís, other subjects. Among
> these is a news-paper “Kavkaz” article on the ascension of
> Bahá’u’lláh by Tumanski in which he gives an unbiased
> account of the history of the Bahá’í Faith and calls
> Bahá’u’lláh “a prophet.”
2\. Browne’s correspondence with Rosen comprises 73

> letters, dating 1889-1902 (one letter is in Persian, the rest
> are in English). These letters too cover a very wide range
> of issues and show in what close cooperation with Rosen
> Browne was doing his research on the Bábí and Bahá’í
> Faiths. From these letters one, for example, finds out that
> Browne used for his work both manuscript copies of the
> Persian Bayán from the St. Petersburg manuscript
> collection, made available for him owing to Rosen.
3\. Ignatyev’s correspondence with Rosen comprises 3

> letters (in Russian). These throw light on the stance of
> Russia’s Foreign Ministry on the Bábí/Bahá’í issue and
> reveal the differences between the Foreign Ministry and
> the Russian authorities in Turkistan in this respect.
4\. Batyushkov’s correspondence with Rosen consists of 3

> letters (in Russian), revealing Batyushkov’s attraction to
> the Bahá’í Faith and his protective attitude towards it.
5\. Sebastian Voirot’s letter (in French) throws some light on

the French Bahá’í community of the time.
6\. Kheyrulláh, who was put in touch with Rosen by Browne,

offers Rosen his book in his letter (in English).
7\. Official reports of Russian diplomats in Persia on the

> Bábís/Bahá’ís (one is in French, the rest are in Russian
> written in a Russian script specially modified to make its
> reading difficult). These cover a period of 1855-1879.
14                      Rosen’s Collection of Bábí and Bahá’í Materials

> Among them is a report by the Russian Charge d’Affaire
> in Tehran Mr. Zinovyev to Duke Gorchakov (in French).
8\. “The Bábís in Adrianople” — a report by the head of the

> Russian Consulate in Adrianople based on eye-witness
> accounts (the report was compiled in Russian on Rosen’s
> request).
9\. Manuscripts:
•   The Law˙-i-Samsun (in Arabic) also known as the

> Law˙-i-Hawdaj (Tablet revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in
> Samsun on his way to Constantinople). The
> manuscript is preserved in an excellent condition.

> •   The Law˙-i-Jawad (3 pages in Persian).
•   A chapter from the Qayyúm al-Asmá (‘chapter of

Josef’) in Arabic.

> •   Prayers
•   ‘History of Haji Mu˙ammad Riza’ — a history in

> Persian of the martyrdom of Haji Mu˙ammad Riza
> Isfahani in Ashkabad, manuscript in Abu-l-Fazl
> Gulpáygání’s hand.

> All the above manuscripts (except for the Law˙-i-Jawad ,
> included into Rosen’s Volume of Epistles by Bahá’u’lláh)
> have not so far been available for general public, because
> they have been preserved in the Archive, which accounts
> for their excellent condition. They are not described in
> any published descriptive catalogue of manuscripts.
10\. Two letters in Judeo-Persian1 with a translation into

> regular Persian, giving an account of the events which
> happened to Bábís (Bahá’ís) of Jewish background in Iran
> and the persecutions they suffered. One letter is
> addressed by Agha Sulayman ‘Attar Hamadani from
> Tehran to Agha Sulayman Shalfurush Hamadani in
> Ashkabad.
11\. A letter written by Abu’l-Fa∂l Gulpáygání to Tumanski

> (in Persian) on behalf of Abdu’l-Bahá. The letter is
> probably a transcript of Gulpáygání’s original letter.

From Tumanski’s and Browne’s correspondences with Rosen
we would know many interesting facts. For example, we can
retrace fully how these two scholars were proceeding with their
work on the translation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the study of
the Persian Bayán respectively. We would also know that
Abdu’l-Bahá was originally against the publication of the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas and would find out what were the
considerations behind this objection. We would know that
Tumanski chose to wait for the Master’s consent and approval.
We would also find out why Browne after so much labor on the
manuscripts was eventually forced to cut his work on the
Persian Bayán in the middle and give up his attempts to publish
it. Since these letters contain and touch upon so many various
subjects, it is impossible to class them according to their
content. So I arrange them chronologically, sometimes
emphasizing the main subject of the letter or quote. All the
Russian language materials are quoted in this presentation in
my English translation. I would start with Tumanski and
several of his letters dated 1892:

> The Bábí [community] in Ashkabad consists of very
> interesting members. Many of them have been
> witnesses of and participants in very interesting
> events. Some of them personally knew the Báb. The
> most interesting of all the Bábís is my friend whom I
> met last year, a Samarkand dweller, who came to
> Ashkabad for the sole purpose of helping me translate
> the Kitáb-i-Aqdas…
> Also I managed to obtain autographs of Bahá’u’lláh2
> and the Báb. I have also been promised a photo of the
> house in Akka. As for the picture [of Bahá’u’lláh], it
> cannot be obtained. The Tarikh-i-Sayyah (Traveller’s
> Narrative) mentions a drawing of the Russian Consul.
> The Bábís are very eager to know whom exactly that
> drawing was by and whether you are familiar with this
> drawing. If it were possible to make a copy or take
> picture of it this could afford great pleasure to
> Bahá’u’lláh… [February 28, 1892]
Having received the news of the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh
Tumanski wrote:

16                    Rosen’s Collection of Bábí and Bahá’í Materials

> It has finally occurred. The page is turned over. ‫ﺁﻥ‬
> ‫‘( ﺭﻡﻭﺩﻩﻑ ﺹﻉﻭﺩ ﺡﺽﺭﺕ‬His Holiness has ascended’) —
> These are the words in which the Bábís of Ashkabad
> informed me of the passing away of Beha… [July 3, 1892]
He published an article about this event in the newspaper
‘Kavkaz,’ from which I will read you a quote:

> A report has been received the other day about the
> death of the Head of the Bábís and their prophet, which
> occurred in Akka…, Syria on 16 May 3. This is a
> remarkable person, who managed to attract about a

> This teaching has made a proud shi’ih Persian, who

> turns his back on people of other beliefs (tabarra’ va
> tavalla), into a humble person, a Bábí, who considers
> everybody to be his brother.

> people he displayed at quite an early age great mental
> capacity and a wonderful moral mindset… [July 9, 1892]
About the publication of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas with his Russian
translation Tumanski tells Rosen the following:

> On the publishing [of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas] I recently
> received a letter from Mírzá Abu’l-Fazl, in which he
> asks me to delay the publication due to the Most Great
> Branch (Ghusn-i-‘Azam)’s concern about the possible
> consequences [of such a publication] for them.
> Enclosed is a copy of the letter. In response to this
> letter I wrote Mírzá [Abu’l-Fazl] to reassure their

> caused to them by a Russian translation and that I
> would not proceed with its publication unless I got the
> permission of his Holiness (hazrat ).

Tumanski goes on to say:

> I have to be on good terms with them, as Bahá’u’lláh’s
> biography is on its way and this is something which
> would be interesting to get. Please, don’t write Browne
> about it so that he won’t beat me to it. If an

> with extracts from the Tarikh-i-Jadid (Manukchi) [New
> History] and the Maqala-yi-Sayyah [Traveller’s
> Narrative]. This would serve as a kind of introduction
> to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas… [October 24, 1892]
Several letters are about Tumanski’s trip to Persia. He writes in
one of them:

> The Bábís with their stories about Persia greatly
> enkindle the flame of my desire to undertake this trip
> and draw a picture of a very interesting journey for
> me. God willing (en sha Alláh). Of course
> recommendations will not be lacking. By now reports
> have gone to many places concerning my forthcoming
> arrival… The point is that to make this trip secret has
> not worked out, because from the very first this whole
> affaire has not been handled quietly and before my
> arrival in Ashkabad almost everybody had already
> known about my forthcoming business trip, and surely
> inferred that the Bábís were the main purpose of it… I
> can only count on the negligence of the Persians
> themselves and fear lest the English should get in my

> Is there any news from Browne? How is he getting on
> with the Bábís [corrected into] Bahá’ís. Has he got
> along with or most probably broken further apart from
> them because of his publication of Subh-i-Azal’s
> portrait and writings?… [January 9, 1893]
An extract from another letter shows how Tumanski was
proceeding with his work on the Kitáb-i-Aqdas:

> In the next mail I am sending you the translation of the
> Kitáb-i-Aqdas with footnotes. As for the supplements
> only three of them are ready so far, namely: 1) an
> extract from the Tablet to Karim Khan, the Shaykhi, 2)
18                     Rosen’s Collection of Bábí and Bahá’í Materials

> a translation of the Tablet on the elementary reality
> (basit al-haqiqa ), in which Bahá’u’lláh touches upon
> pantheism, 3) a Tablet about the Sufis. 4 I also intend to
> add a few Tablets containing commandments (ahkam).
> No real news so far. Just an increased activity in Bábí’s
> visiting Akka can be seen. A treatise titled Risala-yi-
> Siyaysiya has recently been received from the Most
> Great Branch (Ghusn-i-`Azam), of which I will give you
> an account, for I am planning to include its content
> into my Introduction. In the meanwhile it is now time
> to end. Let peace and Bahá’ abide upon you. [January 21,
> 1894]

The closing line of the above letter merits special attention.

Tumanski uses this expression: ‘let Bahá abide upon you’ in the
closing part of several of his letters. On one occasion
Batyushkov does the same in his reference to E. G. Browne. He
says: alayhi Bahá (“let Bahá abide upon him”).

Meanwhile Tumanski ran into some difficulties with the
Russian authorities while arranging his trip to Persia. Baron
Rosen as it is clear from the given correspondence was
instrumental in paving Tumanski’s way to that country. After
sharing with Rosen some details of his itinerary Tumanski says:

> It is going to be organized in the following way. A
> report will be sent to Akka concerning my journey, and
> a circular letter will be sent out from there requesting
> the believers as part of their obligation to give me full
> assistance. I don’t know how to thank you for all this.
> My fiancée and I are completely delighted. The Bábís
> are also jubilant, while giving their praises (zikr’es) they
> are promising me the most exciting trip. One of them
> will be sent from Ashkabad to accompany me on my
> journey… [January 17, 1894]
As his journey was drawing to a close Tumanski wrote:

> I have almost finished my journey. I cannot say that it
> was an easy one. Though I was never exposed to a real
> danger, I had a lot of troubles… As to the Bábís I can
> say that almost everywhere where they exist I came into
> contact with them and this will be the subject of my
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                     19

> special note which I will include into my report…
> [October 28, 1894]

Tumanski takes up this issue in another letter after the
completion of his trip. This letter dated January 4, 1895 is of
special interest for in it Tumanski among other things gives
statistical data about the Bábís living in different parts of
Persia. He, for example, says:

> Their total number mustn’t exceed 100000 or 150000.
> The figure given by Curson and quoted by Browne is to
> the best of my knowledge exaggerated. However, this by
> no means detracts from their importance. Presently
> there is an especially large number of Bábís in Tehran,
> among whom you can find very high-ranking and
> influential people. Moreover, Bábíism also serves as a
> banner around which elements unhappy with the
> existing regime group together. Among these there are
> some very influential khans and chiefs of nomadic
> tribes… I personally met two highly influential
> Baktiyari khans and an Arab shaykh from Fars…
Although Batyushkov’s letters are few, they also contain
some very interesting information. 5 For example, in a letter
dated January 18, 1894 he writes about Mírzá Yahyá:

> Finally about Subh-i-Azal, he is said to be dragging out
> a very miserable existence now. For his sons, who are
> almost his only adherents, leave no hope for a bright
> future, though they have traveled extensively around the
> world. By the way, they have often been to…,6 but
> without showing any tendencies to preoccupy
> themselves with the salvation of either their souls or
> other people’s. The rest of the Bábís have already
> become convinced of the meaning of the words of
> Nuqta-yi-Awla, that Bahá had to be in concealment for
> 9 years in order to be saved from an inevitable death.

Therefore [Subh-i-Azal’s] role is limited to this period…
In another letter to Rosen, dated June 3, 1899, Batyushkov
writes:

> Valentin Alekseevitch7 tells me that Tumanski’s
> publication of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas is nearing completion

> if not already completed. You, surely, know of what
> importance it is for Persia and how greatly demanded
> it would be. Some people already made inquires to me
> about it and therefore I am wondering if the
> translation is printed together with the [original] text
> or separately and in the latter case, if it is possible to
> have the original text alone. In case of your positive
> [reply to this question] I would ask you to do me a
> favor by sending me about 20 copies of the text with
> the translation and 80 copies of the [original] text
> without the translation…
Ignatyev’s letters are no less interesting. They enlighten us as
to the Russian authorities’ approach to the Bahá’í Faith and to
some controversy characteristic of this approach. Thus
Ignatyev wrote:

> When correspondence about granting Russian
> citizenship to the Bábís living in Ashkabad started our
> Envoy in Tehran informed the Head of the
> [Transcaspian] Region, that about the spread of the

However, the opposite has happened: Christians

From here Ignatyev goes on to say:

> inconceivable to me that such a reason would ever (at
> least in the foreseeable future) be found… Not a single

> 25, 1892].

Needless to say that the assertion sometimes made in Iran by
some Iranian circles that Bahá’ís were supported and used in
Iran by foreign (Western) powers to promote their own
political aims, in the light of the above confession made by the
high-ranking Russian diplomat, appears totally unfounded. In
another letter to Rosen Ignatyev touches upon the passing of
some Bahá’í Writings to Russian officials:

> In reply to your letter dated April 8, which I received
> on 20th I need to inform you urgently that for some

> political considerations, when publishing Bábí
> documents it seems to me more proper not to mention
> my name as well as the fact that these documents were
> presented by the Bábís to General Kuropatkin.9 As you
> well know, our Ministry is not quite sympathetic to the
> attempts of the authorities of the Transcaspian Region
> to offer the Bábís exceptional support. The mention of
> my name, given my official status here, would accord
> to the delivery of Bahá’u’lláh’s epistles into my hands
> by the Bábís a somewhat official character, which is
> undesirable… [April 23, 1892]
I will now turn to the “Report on the Bábís in Adrianople,”
which was compiled on Baron Rosen’s special request by the
Russian Consul of the time. It comprises several accounts
made by different individuals. All the accounts emphasize that
the Bábís lived quite peacefully in Adrianople and were far from
being trouble-makers. Among these materials there is a
document titled: “A rough translation from German of the
petition of the Bábí Shaykh (i.e. Bahá’u’lláh) to the Austrian
Consulate” concerning the new upsurge of persecutions that
befell the Bábís, by which Bahá’u’lláh’s banishment to Akka is
implied. I will not quote this document here. Instead I will read
you an extract from a report based on the accounts of some
Sufi Shaykhs in Adrionople:

> According to the testimony of old Adrionople dwellers
> (Shaykhs belonging to the dervishes of the Mevlevi and
> Qadrikhane Sufi orders…, who were people with whom
> Shaykh Óusayn Ali had a personal relationship), the
> Bábís lived a quiet and humble life. Shaykh Óusayn Ali
> was a very clever and respectable person. He was
> engaged in the study and interpretation of many
> theological issues. Haji Izzet Pasha finds that the Bábí
> teaching is an aspiration for self-perfection. The Báb is
> the outward sign of a gate leading the soul to Paradise.
> Humility and self-possession, and also firmness in
> sustaining sufferings purify the soul and open for it
> the gate (Báb) of Paradise. The person preaching this,
> enlightening people and guiding them unto salvation is
> the one who is the Báb. This is also what the Gospel
> speaks about. Isa (Jesus Christ), the prophet, calls

> himself the Báb, for through him people enter Paradise.
> According to Hadr and Izzet Pasha, the Báb’s pure
> doctrine was distorted by uneducated people, while in
> essence it by no means contradicts Islam. Mu˙ammad,
> in the exalted sense of the word, was also the Báb, and
> Musa and Isa, as well as all the great saints and wise
> men, who taught and corrected humankind.
Turning now to E. Browne’s correspondence with Rosen, we
will start with a quote from a letter in which the British scholar
describes his recent journey to Cyprus and the Palestine. He
says:

> My journey — as I daresay you will have desired was
> intimately connected with the same object. It appeared
> to me that for a proper understanding of the subject
> (apart from the great interest one feels in beholding
> face to face the prime movers in a great national or
> religious movement) it was very desirable to have a
> personal interview with the chiefs of both parties of
> Bábís, since from them (if they chose to speak) the most
> authentic and detailed accounts might be expected.
> So, having obtained some extension of the Easter

The following letter helps us to understand how Browne
classified and selected Bábí and Bahá’í writings from the
standpoint of their importance. He wrote:

> But of course the printing of oriental works is
> expensive, & we cannot publish the whole of the
> extensive literature which the Bábís have managed to
> produce in this short time, so that I am anxious to
> make a wise selection… As regards the work about the
> Bábís, I think it would be a good thing to publish –
> (i) Selections from the Báb’s writings, including the
> whole of the Persian Beyan, the Dala’il-i-Sab’a, 11
portions of the 12

Commentaries on the Suras of Joseph,
> ‫ ﺍﻝﻉﺹﺭ ﻭ‬, ‫ ﻕﺭﻩﺏ‬, one or two of the ‫; ﺍﺭﺍﺕﺯﯼ‬13 & other
> shorter writings,
> (ii) Selections from Beha’s works, including,
> ‫ ﺍﻕﺩﺱ ﮎﺕﺍﺏ‬14
> ‫ﻥﺹﯼﺭ ﻭﺡﻝ‬
> ‫ﻡﮎﻥﻭﻥﻩ ﻝﻡﺍﺕﮎ‬
> ‫ﻑﺭﺩﻭﺱﯼّﻩ ﻝﻡﺍﺕﮎ‬

> Some other of the shorter ‫( ﺍﻝﻭﺍﺡ‬Tablets) which you have
> not published, and selections from the ‫ﻕﺍﻥﺍﯼ‬. (Kitáb-i-
> ˆqán)

> (iii) Selections from Subh-i-Ezel’s writings, including
> portions of his ‫ ﺍﻝﺭﻭﺡ ﻍﻡﺍﺕﻥ‬, (Persian)
> ‫ ﻡﺝﺍﻝﯼ ﺉﺍﻝﯼﻝ‬and the short account of the Bábí
> movement which he wrote for me.
> … If you would give me your advice as to how I had

> spend a few weeks in London to collate it with the
> British Museum MS. Unfortunately their rules are very
> stringent, & it is impossible to borrow any MS… [From
> a letter dated July 12, 1891]

In another letter Browne says:

> I am very glad to hear that your Collections
> Scientifiques15 are so nearly ready, as they will be a very
> great acquisition not only to ‘Bábology,” but to
> Oriental Studies in general…
> As you say that M. Tumanski 16 is at present working at
> a popular resume of his sojourn amongst the Bábís in
> Ashkabad, & that he thinks of adding to it a brief
> account of my investigations, and also that he will
> soon be returning to his military duties in Asia, I
> thought that it might perhaps be convenient to him to
> be able to refer to my forthcoming work without
> further delay…
> Still I think there can  be no doubt that you are right as
> to the ‫ﻑﺍﺭﺱﯼ ﯼﺍﻥﺏ‬17 being more important by far, and
> it would be a pity  if the University Press after finishing
> the ‫ ﺝﺩﯼﺩ ﺍﺭﯼﺥﺕ‬, 18 should weary of spending money on
> what one of my un-initiated friends had termed “a
> religion of which nobody ever heard before” I shewed
> what you had written to Professor Robertson Smith,
> by whose opinion the University Press Syndicate would
> be chiefly guided in the matter, & I also shewed him my

> MS. of the text & translation of the ‫ ﺩﯼﺩﺝ ﺍﺭﯼﺥﺕ‬, and he
> said that he did not think it would be advisable to urge
> the Press to incur the expense of publishing so large a
> work unless you, who were best able to judge
> impartially of its value, recommended it strongly. He
> also said that he thought that they would certainly
> print the Persian Beyan for me if I prepared a text; and
> if I have decided to get to work on that as soon as

> energy on the ‫ ﻑﺍﺭﺱﯼ ﯼﺍﻥﺏ‬. It rests with your kindness

> be glad to begin the work during the vacation if it were
> possible, for from now till October 10th I shall have
> much more leisure than when term time begins… [From a
> letter dated July 28, 1891]

The theme of the Persian Bayán also features in Browne’s
following letters:

> First of all as to the Persian Beyan. It is unfortunate
> that delay is unavoidable, but it is very generous of
> your librarian to allow their MSS. to go abroad at all,
> and eager as I am to commence the work, I cannot but
> feel that they are right in safe-guarding possessions so
> precious in whatever way seems best to them. And after
> all I can always be employing myself in collating my
> own two MSS, & if I am in London, the British
> Museum codex also. I am chiefly sorry to give you so
> much trouble… [From a letter dated August 15, 1891]

> …I returned to Cambridge after my vacation at the end
> of last week… this morning to my great delight I
> received from our Foreign Office the MS. of the
> Persian Beyan belonging to the Academy of Sciences,

> words sufficiently to express my deep sense of
> gratitude to you for all the trouble you have taken in
> the matter and to the Academy of Sciences for the
> generosity with which they have placed at my disposal

> so precious a manuscript. Pray convey to them my
> most sincere and warmest thanks.
> Two days ago I dispatched the application for the

> …I have been steadily collating my best MS. of the

that. However

‫ﻕﻁﺭﮤ ﺏﺍ ﻕﻁﺭﮤ ﺩﺭﯼﺍ ﺵﻭﺩ‬19

Quotes from a few more letters I will read without comments.
For they speak for themselves:

> You will see therefore, that my trip to Paris has not

> What you tell me about M. Gamazof inspires me with

The following letter explains what he means:

> I feel my countrymen are tired of Bábís (sic), and that
> there is little chance of my getting either the Beyan or
> Mírzá Jani’s history published, unless it be at my own
> expense… [From a letter dated October 27, 1894]

> …I thank you very sincerely for what you say about the

> remunerable, published here, I may tell you that I have
> just applied to the Press to print my Catalogue of
> Persian MSS. in the University Library, and that even
> about this I am having some difficulties and anxiety…
> [From a letter dated December 23, 1894]

> …Your letter of Feb. 26 reached me in the Island of Cyprus

> The assassination of the Shah of Persia is naturally

> every country in Western Asia. I met him in London in
> 1891, where he was trying to stir up public feeling
> against the Shah by articles in the magazines on what he
> called “The Reign of Terror in Persia.” He    conducted

> influence. He is, I suppose, safe for the present as I see
> that the Sultan refuses to give him up to the Persian
> Ambassador at Constantinople… [From a letter dated May
> 9, 1895]

The theme of the emerging Bahá’í community in America is
also reflected in Browne’s letters. It is touched upon in 3 of the
4 letters with which I would like to conclude this presentation:

> P.S. I think I told you about the Bábís in America
> (Chicago). There are Americans who account them-
> selves of the sect. I send you herewith (enclosed with the
> J.R.A.S. 35 extracts) a little work published by their
> leader, Kheyru’lláh, which may amuse, though it can
> hardly instruct you… [From a letter dated February 2, 1898]

> … I hope that you are well, and that your official work
> leaves you some time free for the Bábís. I think I told
> you that the sect has established itself in America. And
> has several hundred ardent behaits in New York,
> Chicago and San Francisco. I had a visit from one of
> them last June. As a rule they seem to know very little
> about it, but some of them perform pilgrimages to 36St.
> Jean d’Acre, and are received there by the ‫… ﺹﺍﻥﻍﺍ‬
> [From a letter dated November 1, 1899]

> …I am most delighted to receive yesterday Captain
> Toumansky’s edition and translation of the Kitáb-i-
> Aqdas and other Bábí works, with Commentary,
> Introduction, etc. As I do not know his address, I am
> taking the liberty of sending you my letter of thanks to
> him, hoping that it will not trouble you too much to
> forward it to him. I have naturally only had time at
> present to glance at it… [From a letter dated February 6, 1900]
> … I had a visit last week from a Bábí ‫ﺍﻉﯼﺩ‬37 on his way
> to America — a very serious intelligent & interesting
> man, who put me en courant as to the very serious

> quarrel and schism which has arisen between ‘Abbas
> Efendi — ‫ — ﺍﻉﻅﻡ ﺹﻥﻍ‬and his younger brothers. The
> latter represent the stationary or conservative element,
> while the former, so far as I can learn, wishes to be
> regarded in the same light as Beha’u’lláh… [From a letter
> dated February 10, 1901]

In conclusion I would like to say that what I have presented
to you is but a glimpse of the highly valuable materials
preserved in Baron Rosen’s archive in the Russian Academy of
Sciences in St. Petersburg. I would also like to stress again that
this collection has so far neither been published nor even
referenced. Some of its items such as manuscripts of
Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings and Abu’l-Fazl Gulpáygání’s autograph
of the “History of Haji Mu˙ammad Riza Isfahani” have a
special value of their own. In order to make this collection
available to the public the soonest publication of all these
materials in the original languages and translation (with all the
necessary references) seems to me highly desirable.
