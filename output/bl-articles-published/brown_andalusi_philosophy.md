                 Andalusí T h e o s ophy
A Recon t e x tua liza tion

J. Vahid Brown

Medieval Spain witnessed the birth and fundamental development
of Islamic and Jewish theosophical movements that were largely to
become the defining modes of mysticism for these faiths throughout
their domains and down to modern times: the Kabbalah in Judaism,
and Akbarian or wujúdí Íúfism in Islam.1 Why both of these
movements emerged into the light of history at virtually the same
moment and in the same region is a question that has been almost
entirely neglected by modern scholarship.2 What I will attempt to
accomplish in this paper is a rapprochement of three lines of research
that are relevant to this question but that have hitherto been carried
out in isolation from one another. These are, first, the historiographic
discussion regarding the “symbiosis” and “interconfessionalism”
prevailing in pre-Expulsion Andalusí philosophy; second, the vexed
question of the emergence and early history of the Kabbalah; and
third, the obscure intellectual origins of the Íúfí mystic Ibn al-‘Arabí
and his “school.”3 In the scholarship on the latter two issues, almost
no attempt has been made to situate these developments in relation to
each other, nor have scholars given due attention to the role of
Andalusí interconfessionalism in creating the necessary fertile ground
for the explosion of these revolutionary theosophies. It will not be my
intention to establish lines of “influence” from Íúfism to Kabbalah or
vice versa. Rather, my purpose will be to suggest a recontextualization
of these emergent Jewish and Islamic theosophies or esotericisms,
such that the interconfessional revolution in religious philosophy in
tenth- to thirteenth-century al-Andalus can be seen as the most critical
source for the development of these two movements, an
interconfessionalism that would continue to mark their later
trajectories through history.

Symbiosis: Judeo-Islamic Philosophy in the
“Golden Age”

Throughout the history of Islamicate4 civilization, philosophy has
been a pursuit carried out in interconfessional contexts. The first
flowering in Islamdom of philosophy proper — falsafah — was owing
to the joint efforts of Syriac Christians and Arab and Persian Muslims
working in Baghdád under the aegis of the first ‘Abbásid caliphs

during the eight and ninth centuries.5 Their translations of the
intellectual legacies of ancient Greece, India and Persia into Arabic
spurred the ‘Abbásid-era renaissance of science and philosophy,6 and
these legacies presented similar challenges to the Abrahamic religious
traditions. The initial Islamicate encounter with the Hellenistic
heritage developed in two distinct directions, that of the falásafah,
often dubbed the “humanists,”7 and that of the dialectical
theologians, the mutakallimún. In both cases the contexts of
development were inherently interconfessional. Oliver Leaman
described the former as having taken place in “an atmosphere [that]
consisted of the thought of Muslims, Christians, Jews and pagans,
and, perhaps more significantly, of those within a religious group
regardless of doctrinal differences.”8 Beginning in the eighth century,
and in a more reactive tone to the philosophical tenets that challenged
such shared dogmas as the temporal, ex nihilo creation of the universe
and the resurrection of bodies, Jewish and Muslim mutakallimún set
down, often in shared social and cultural contexts, their elaborate
philosophical theologies of these Abrahamic faiths.9

Later, in al-Andalus — Islamicate Spain — the development of
philosophy continued to be marked by Jewish-Muslim
interconfessionalism. In a certain sense, the cultural efflorescence of
medieval al-Andalus was a mirror image of ‘Abbásid Baghdád, an
image that was consciously manipulated as much by the founders of
the independent Andalusí Umayyad caliphate as by the Jewish
leadership associated with that court. The process by which the
Andalusí Umayyads created a foundation myth that drew upon
‘Abbásid symbolism while simultaneously affirming their legitimate
independence from Baghdád has been documented at length by
Janina Safran.10 Equally important for our purposes is the fact that
the Andalusí Jewish community, under the leadership of Óasdai ibn
Shapru† (d. 975), physician and advisor to the court of the first
independent Andalusí Umayyad caliph, ‘Abd al-Ra˙mán al-Náßir (r.
961-976), had simultaneously broken with the yeshivot of Baghdad
and set the Jews of al-Andalus on an independent course that would
lead them to rival the Babylonian centers in the spiritual and
intellectual leadership of world Jewry.11 The fact that both Muslims
and Jews of al-Andalus understood the parallelism of these
developments is evidenced by the literature emanating from both
sides of the confessional divide, in which the link is made explicit.12

The ensuing centuries of Andalusí civilization have often been
hailed as a “Golden Age” of Jewish-Muslim symbiosis, with Jews
attaining unprecedented heights in the state apparatus, and witnessing
a general flowering of poetry, literature, and philosophy that
transcended religious boundaries.13 As there are numerous detailed
studies of this period, I will here only briefly identify the most

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven         3

important personalities associated with the “Golden Age” of Andalusí
philosophy, emphasizing the interconfessional aspects of these
thinkers’ lives and works. First, though, a few words must be said
regarding the categorization of this literary output as “philosophy.”

The distinctions made between philosophy and religion, science
and magic, or rationalism and mysticism, often confuse more than
they reveal about the medieval literatures to which they are applied.14
This anachronistic division is at the heart of the problem of the
inadequate contextualizations of Spanish Kabbalah and Andalusí
Íúfism, and I will have more to say about this below. It would be well
to emphasize from the start that for every one of the individuals
mentioned below, the pursuit of philosophy was an explicitly religious
affair, having as much to do with the character and knowability of
God and prophecy as with the nature and properties of “natural”
phenomena. The very few Islamicate philosophers for whom religious
concerns were indifferent to the pursuit of truth — such as Abú Bakr
al-Rází (d. 925) or Ibn al-Ráwandí (d. 910) — are the exceptions that
prove the rule. The distinction made between Neoplatonism and
Aristotelianism, with the former considered more congenial to
religious applications than the latter, is likewise an inadequate one,
not least because one of the single most Neoplatonic texts known to
medieval Islamdom was thought until modern times to have been a
work of Aristotle.15 The strictest Aristotelian known to al-Andalus
was Ibn Rushd, who was however famous throughout the Islamicate
world not as a philosopher, but as a scholar of Islamic law.16 His alter-
identity in the Latin West as Averroes, the enemy of religion, was
predicated upon a rather selective process of translation and
mistranslation such that “the Averroes whom the West first
encountered was not the full man, and . . . the writings the thirteenth
century did not translate could have significantly altered the
perception of him as an irreligious naturalist, and the perception of
Aristotelianism as an implacable foe of organized religion.”17

With this caveat in mind, let us briefly survey the interconfessional
development of philosophy in al-Andalus. Mention should first of all
be made of Isaac Israeli (d. c. 955), the first great Jewish Neoplatonist
who, though not an Andalusí, was to play a significant role in the
interconfessional career of philosophy in al-Andalus.18 Famous to
medieval Muslims, Jews, and Christians primarily for his medical
treatises, his philosophical works left a prominent mark on many
Jewish thinkers of al-Andalus, especially Solomon ibn Gabirol (d.
1054 or 1058), Moses ibn Ezra (c. 1060-1139), Joseph ibn Íaddíq (d.
1149), Abraham ibn Óasdai (fl. 13th cent.), and Shem Tov ibn
Falaquera (d. c. 1295). He may also have been a principle source for
Andalusí knowledge of the so-called long version of the Theology of
Aristotle, a critical source both for Isma’ílí thought and for Jewish

Neoplatonic theology in the Middle Ages, which likely emerged from
a Judeo-Isma’ílí context.19 The Theology was also to play an important
role in both Kabbalah and Andalusí wujúdí Íúfism, being cited by the
Gerona Kabbalists,20 Moses de Leon (the author of the Zohar),21 and
Ibn al-‘Arabí.22 In addition to the Jewish philosophers noted above,
Israeli is also quoted by the 11th century Andalusí Muslim author of
the Gháyat al-˙akím23 (the Picatrix of the Latin alchemical tradition),
attributed to Maslamah ibn A˙mad al-Majri†í (d. 1007), and appears
to have been a source for the Muslim philosopher Ba†alyúsí (d. c.
1127),24 about whom more will be said below.

The next major figure of Andalusí philosophy is Ibn Masarra of
Cordoba (b. 883), often considered in both Muslim and Western
sources to have been the first Íúfí of al-Andalus. Few of his works
have survived, though his views can be extrapolated from quotations
and summaries in later Muslim works, chiefly those of Ibn al-‘Arabí.25
From these sources we learn that Ibn Masarra taught that the Throne
of God governs or rules the cosmos; that human beings can attain the
gift of prophecy; and that given the homology between the universe
and the supernal, divine Book, the key to metaphysical understanding
is the esoteric interpretation of the letters of the alphabet. All three
of these theses were to be discussed by Ibn al-‘Arabí, and he expressly
adopted the last of them.26 The emphasis on the Throne of God
immediately puts one in mind of the “throne mysticism” of Judaism,
whereas the latter two principles were both fundamental to the
Kabbalah of Abraham Abulafia, on whom see below. Whatever Ibn
Masarra’s relationship with pseudo-Empedocles, the Hermetic
doctrines associated with the latter were to find many an enthusiast in
later Andalusí centuries.27

Solomon Ibn Gabirol (1021-1054 or 1058), generally regarded as
the first Jewish philosopher in Spain,28 carries on the tradition of
Israeli and Ibn Masarra in Neoplatonism and in a cosmology with
strikingly pseudo-Empedoclean features.29 His writings were to be
extremely influential to later Kabbalists, especially his doctrine of the
Divine Will as something of a demiurge, intermediate between the
unknowable Godhead and the creation.30 Ibn Gabirol’s doctrine that
even spiritual entities are composed of matter and form appears to
presage later Íúfí theosophical developments, particularly Ibn al-
‘Arabí. His most famous work, known in Latin translation as the Fons
Vitae, a dialogue in which the characters are given almost full-blown
literary personalities, marks the beginning of a trend toward
narrativization in philosophical writing which would come to
predominate in Andalusí literature.

With Ibn Óazm (d. 1064), we stray somewhat from the course of
Andalusí philosophy. The importance of Ibn Óazm for our purposes

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven         5

lies in what his writings reveal about the character of Jewish-Muslim
relations in his time. He was not particularly well-disposed towards his
Jewish compatriots, but nonetheless displays a wide knowledge of
contemporary Jewish literature in his polemical works. Ibn Óazm
knows not only the Bible, but also parts of the Talmud, the Shi’ur
Qomah literature, and even perhaps the writings of the Karajites.31
His polemics against Samuel Ibn Nagrela (d. 1056), the Jewish
commander of the Zirid army of Cordoba and a much-celebrated
literary virtuoso of the court, should probably be read as springing less
from a pious distaste at seeing the exaltation of a non-believer as
from a certain bitterness at their respective fortunes (Ibn Óazm wrote
from exile, having fled first Cordoba and then Seville in the wake of
an auto-de-fé of his works there).32 In any case, Ibn Óazm, by drawing
upon it while reacting to it, reveals the remarkable extent of the
Jewish-Muslim “symbiosis” prevailing in his time.33

If Ibn Óazm turned to Jewish texts for polemical purposes, Ba˙ya
ibn Paqúda (fl. second half of 11th cent.) found in Islamic literature an
inspiration for Jewish pietism. It would probably not be overstating
the case to term Ibn Paqúda the first Jewish Íúfí.34 In his Fará’i∂ al-
qulúb (“Duties of the Hearts”) Ibn Paqúda quotes various Íúfís as well
as Islamic ˙adíth literature, often camouflaging the material by
putting the sayings of Mu˙ammad in the mouths of anonymous
“sages” and replacing Qur’anic quotations with appropriate Biblical
parallels. Like many of the Judeo-Islamic philosophers and
theosophers of al-Andalus, Ibn Paqúda drew inspiration from and
quoted the writings of the Ikhwán al-Íafá , a mysterious group of
10th-century authors, most likely writing in Basra and bearing a close
relationship with the Isma’ílís, whose Rasá’il (“Epistles”) won for
Neoplatonism a far-reaching impact in subsequent Islamic thought.35
Regarding the Hebrew translation of Ibn Paqúda’s Fará’i∂ al-qulúb,
Fenton writes that it “was to have an abiding influence on Jewish
spirituality right down to present times, infusing generations of
Jewish readers with Sufi notions. After having strongly influenced the
Spanish and thereafter the Palestinian Kabbalists, who were
particularly interested in Ba˙ya’s reflections on solitary meditation,
the Duties of the Heart was avidly read in the eighteenth century by
Polish ˙asidim.”36

Ibn Síd al-Ba†alyúsí (d. 1127) is one of the more obscure figures of
the period, perhaps because this Islamic philosopher did not find
much of an audience among Muslims for his philosophical works,
being chiefly known to them as a grammarian.37 His Kitáb al-Hadá’iq
was almost exclusively read in Andalusí Jewish circles, with the
notable exception of the school of Ibn al-‘Arabí; the latter refers to
him approvingly and attributes to him two common tropes in Íúfí and
Kabbalistic literature: that of the divine unicity as distinct from

mathematical unity, and underlying all numbers; and that of the point
(= the divine Will or unicity) as the primordial source of line, plane,
and volume.38

The remaining luminaries of Andalusí Judeo-Islamic philosophy are
too well-known to require any introduction. The interconfessional
contexts in which these thinkers lived and wrote has been remarked
upon by many scholars. In the circle of the Jewish poet-philosophers
centering on Judah Halevi (d. 1140),39 Abraham ibn Ezra (d. c. 1164),
and Joseph ibn Íaddíq (1149), we find a tradition in full swing of
conscious and often positive use of Islamic sources, association with
Andalusí courts, and participation in a social class of — most
commonly — physicians, contexts that brought Jewish and Muslim
philosophers into contact with one another. Their Islamic counterparts
— Ibn Bájjah (d. 1138), Ibn ˇufayl (d. 1185), and Ibn Rushd (d. 1198)
— while showing few explicit indications of influence by Jewish
sources, were nonetheless integrated into the same socio-political
networks, and were clearly aware of their Jewish colleagues.40 The
popularity of these Islamic philosophers among Jewish readers was
often far greater than among Muslims, and in some cases it is due to
the efforts of Jews in the preservation and translation of their works
that we know them today.41

Moses Maimonides (d. 1204) stands unparalleled among this
group, exerting an influence which, in its capacity for leaping over
confessional and philosophical boundaries, has no peer among any
thinker of the Western Islamicate world. His profound knowledge of
the whole course of Islamic philosophy made him a peer of such
minds as Ibn Rushd, whom he further parallels in achieving lasting
fame and influence as a scholar of the sacred law. As we will see
below, he was studied in the theosophical movements of both
religions, a fact which is perhaps the most striking evidence of his
importance in the interconfessional atmosphere of al-Andalus.
Maimonides and Ibn al-‘Arabí both resided in Cairo at the same time,
in 1203.42 That they may have met is by no means farfetched, as both
had access to the same philosophical and courtly circles there. Both,
likewise, maintained and continuously asserted their identities as
Andalusís while living the latter halves of their lives in other parts of
the Islamicate world.43

Jewish Theosophy: Kabbalah and the Andalusí Context

Steven Wasserstrom has already noted that, given that the field of
Jewish-Islamic studies is still in its infancy, no “unproblematic story”
can be told of the history that we are here concerned with.44 It will
thus not be my intention to present an alternative history of the
emergence of Kabbalah, integrating it into the interconfessional

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven         7

history of Andalusí thought. Rather I hope simply to point out that
the need for such a recontextualization is suggested by the evidence,
of which I will discuss here only four areas: the Gerona school of
Kabbalists, Isaac ibn La†if, Abraham Abulafia, and the so-called
“Jewish Íúfís” that emerged under the leadership of the Maimonidean
dynasty in Egypt. First, though, some remarks on the prevailing trends
in the historiography of the Kabbalah must be made.

No scholar did more to establish Kabbalah studies as an academic
discipline in its own right than Gershom Scholem (d. 1982), the
undisputed master of the field. No twentieth century historian of
Jewish spirituality has been able to dispense with his insights, and the
historiography of Kabbalah has largely followed the lines of research
that he initiated. When it comes to the origins of Kabbalah, however,
Scholem showed little interest in considering the context of Spain and
the currents of Andalusí philosophy, much less of the latter’s
interconfessional character, and posited instead a re-emergence of
“subterranean” gnosticism latent in Jewish thought as the key to
understanding the emergence of Kabbalah.45 He took this stance in
reaction to the approaches of 19th-century Wissenschaft des
Judentums scholars, who tended to denigrate Kabbalah as an anti-
rational reaction to the glories of Spanish-Jewish philosophy.
Scholem’s much more sympathetic view of Kabbalah’s place in the
history of Judaism led him to divorce the early history of Kabbalah
from its relation to this immediate, philosophical context.46 Scholem’s
“counter-history,”47 while it has been questioned and criticized with
reference to a number of particular issues, has not been superceded by
alternative narratives sensitive to the historical context that I am
suggesting here.48 When Scholem did offer suggestions for immediate
historical antecedents, they were generally not from the direction of
al-Andalus, and subsequent research has often shown up their
weakness.49 Eliot Wolfson has noted that, “[d]espite the fact that
Scholem was keenly aware of the textual, philological, and historical
influence of philosophical authors on Jewish mystics in the Middle
Ages, he dichotomized the intellectual currents of mysticism and
philosophy in too simplistic a fashion.”50

The Gerona school of Kabbalists, whose works constitute the most
important body of pre-Zohar Kabbalistic literature, shows just how
inadequate this dichotomy is. This circle of Kabbalists was active in
Spain roughly between the years 1210 and 1260, and includes among
its members the well-known Biblical exegete Na˙manides (d. 1270)
and his contemporaries Ezra ben Solomon, ‘Azriel, and Jacob ben
Sheshet.51 Though living in Christian Spain, the continuity of their
thought with Andalusí Judeo-Islamic philosophy is proven by the
sources which provided much of their inspiration: Ibn Gabirol, the
direct source for Azriel’s doctrine of the primal Will; Judah Halevi52,

Abraham ibn Ezra,53 and Maimonides.54 As Idel has shown, Jacob ben
Sheshet knew and employed the cosmological scheme of the long
version of the Theology of Aristotle,55 and explicitly utilized
Maimonides’ Guide as a source for Platonic material, albeit material
which Maimonides had only quoted in order to refute.56 A particularly
interesting document originating from this circle is the Sefer ha-
Temunah, which crystallizes certain speculations about cosmic cycles
earlier elaborated by Abraham bar Óiyya, writing in Aragon around
1125\. Contrary to Scholem’s suggestion of Joachimite influence,
Wilensky has shown the remarkable consistency between the Sefer ha-
Temunah and Isma’ílí schema of cosmic cycles. Setting forth the
theory as the “teachings of certain philosophers,” bar Óiyya wrote:

> After all the creatures have passed from potentiality to
> actuality, God once again returns them to potentiality as in
> the beginning and then brings them back to actuality a
> second and third time, and thus without end . . . Others say
> that the days of the world are 40,000 years and that each of

> God destroys His world, leaves it for 1,000 years in a state of
> tohu, and at the end of the fiftieth millennium He renews it
> as in the beginning.57

What is truly remarkable about this theory is that it appears again,
almost contemporaneously with the Sefer ha-Temunah, in a work by
‘Azíz Nasafí, an Iranian Muslim follower of the Murcian school of
Íúfism to be considered below.58 In Nasafí’s words, written in the
latter half of the 13th century:

> Know thou that the Transmigrationists say that there is a
> cycle every thousand years and at the end of a cycle there is a
> resurrection, a lesser resurrection. And there is a cycle every
> seven thousand years, and at the end of each seven thousand
> years there is another resurrection, a greater resurrection.
> And there is a cycle every forty-nine thousand years, and at
> the end of each forty-nine thousand years there is another
> resurrection, a supreme resurrection. Since you have

> seven thousand years is the cycle of Saturn . . . Another seven
> thousand years is the cycle of Jupiter . . . [And so on with the
> seven planets.] With the supreme resurrection [after 49,000
> years] the earth is completely flooded, and water covers the
> entire land.59
This is an exact parallel, in every particular, of the doctrine set
forth by the Gerona Kabbalists. In addition, the Sefer ha-Temunah is
the first Kabbalistic text to use the term gilgul for transmigration of

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven        9

the soul,60 and it is to the Transmigrationists (ahl al-tanasukh) that
Nasafí attributes the belief. This is certainly one of the most
compelling pieces of evidence arguing for an interconfessional
recontextualization of these literatures.61

Another important Spanish Kabbalist demonstrating continuity
with the Andalusí interconfessional context is Isaac Ibn La†if, to
whom Sara Wilensky has devoted a number of important studies. As
she has shown, Ibn La†if declared himself to be a disciple of
Maimonides,62 and draws at length upon the Andalusí Neoplatonists
discussed above, particularly Solomon Ibn Gabirol.63 He even went
“behind” Maimonides, so to speak, directly citing al-Fárábí in
elaborating his theory of prophecy rather than simply utilizing
Maimonides, who likewise was indebted to al-Fárábí on this issue.64
He then parted company with both al-Fárábí and Maimonides on the
issue of psychology, drawing instead upon Ba†alyúsí in enumerating
the five-fold division of vegetative, animal, rational, philosophical
and prophetic souls.65 He continues the doctrine of the cosmic cycles
held by the Gerona school, and Wilensky has posited direct
dependence on Isma’ílí sources in this regard.66 She has also
demonstrated such dependence in Ibn La†if’s negative theology,
wherein the Divine Will is a demiurgic “first created being” (al-
mubda` al-awwal ), from which the cosmos is emanated.67 I quote at
length one passage from Wilensky’s article on this doctrine, as it
admirably illustrates how intertwined the earliest Kabbalah was with
the Andalusí interconfessional context:

> His [Ibn La†if’s] reply to the question: how can a link exist
> between infinite God and finite and material man (a question
> posed by Judah Hallevi through the Khazar), is that there is
> no relationship between the transcendent, infinite God and
> finite man, and that the infinite God cannot be grasped by
> human thought. He quotes Plotinus, as formulated by Ibn
> Gabirol in Fons Vitae, and adds: “I say that the limit of
> cognition is when the intellectually cognized subject is able
> to encompass the object of cognition; and He who is infinite
> cannot be encompassed by the finite intellect.” He maintains
> that the source of prophecy is not the transcendent, infinite,
> hidden God, but the First Created Being. The paradox can be
> solved by positing a link between the First Created Being and
> the prophetic soul (the intuitive soul). The latter term was
> adopted from the Kitáb al-Hada’ik [sic] of the Andalusian
> philosopher al-Batalyawsi68 (1052-1127), who in turn
> borrowed it from the Epistles of the Sincere Brethren
> (Ikhwan al-Safa), Neoplatonic texts closely connected to the
Isma’ilia.69

With regard to Abraham Abulafia (d. c. 1291), another Spanish
Kabbalist of the thirteenth century, we have a number of studies by
the eminent historian of Kabbalah, Moshe Idel, who has shown
Abulafia’s intimate continuity with Andalusí philosophy and provided
evidence of the influence of Íúfism on various elements of Abulafia’s
thought.70 Considered the progenitor of an ecstatic or prophetic
version of Kabbalah — as distinct from the theosophical mode which
centered on the theory of the sefirot and the mystical meanings of the
commandments71 — Abulafia, like many of the earliest Spanish
Kabbalists, studied Andalusí philosophy prior to becoming a
Kabbalist.72 He was one of the first people to write a commentary on
Maimonides’ Guide, and no one since him wrote as many
commentaries of this work.73 And once again, Ba†alyúsí’s Kitáb al-
Hadá’iq appears as an important source.74 Idel summarizes the
importance of the Andalusí interconfessional philosophical tradition
thus:

> In other words, Abulafia read Maimonides in Avicennian and
> Averroistic keys, decoded his own spiritual adventures
> according to Maimonides’ teaching in the Guide, and added
> philosophical conceptions out of Arabic philosophy.75
Perhaps more important for our purposes than Abulafia’s
continuity with Andalusí Judeo-Islamic philosophy is the fact that he
represents the beginning of a trend toward direct engagement of
Íúfism in Kabbalah, rather than the mediated influence via earlier
authors like Ibn Paqúda or Ghazálí-in-translation such as can be
identified in many theosophical Kabbalistic works. There are traces of
Íúfism throughout Abulafia, both in matters of doctrine and in terms
of the innovation of ecstatic techniques modeled after Íúfí
practices.76 In his circle of followers, many of whom dwelt in
Palestine, this becomes a much more marked tendency, extending to
the adoption of cosmological schemas and even terminology from
Íúfism, and, most notably, from the school of Ibn al-‘Arabí.77 To give
but one example of the many adduced by Idel, we find in a
Kabbalistic compilation made by Rabbi Isaac of Acre78, one of the
foremost Kabbalists of the fourteenth century and a leading figure of
the Abulafian tradition, the following five-world hierarchy: the
World of Divinity, the World of the Intellect, the World of the
Souls, the Imaginal World, and the World of the Senses.79 While this
schema baffled Scholem, who saw it as an odd departure from the
dominant Kabbalistic cosmologies based on Neoplatonic schema, it
exactly corresponds with the Íúfí five-world hierarchy that first
appears in the writings of Ibn al-‘Arabí’s disciples.80 The specific
attributes of the Imaginal World are exactly the same in both cases, as
Idel has shown in a point-by-point analysis, showing that this Íúfí-

Kabbalistic parallel “is not only one of terminology, but also of
conceptual content.”81

The trend of explicit adoption of Íúfí material as represented by
the Abulafian Kabbalistic tradition finds its most radical expression in
the so-called “Jewish Íúfís,” who have been the subject of several
ground-breaking studies by Paul Fenton. Utilizing material from the
Cairo Geniza, he has greatly enriched our picture of this remarkable
Jewish pietist movement in 13th century Egypt, led by the descendents
of Maimonides, which explicitly drew its inspiration from Islamic
mysticism and attempted an Islamicization of Jewish worship. The
beginnings of this movement lie at least during the tenure of Moses
Maimonides as ra’ís al-yahúd (president of the Jewish community) in
Cairo during the last decades of the twelfth century. The first
historical personality definitely associated with this movement was a
younger contemporary of Moses Maimonides, Rabbi Abraham ha-
˙asíd (d. 1223) 82, of whose extant works Fenton writes that, while
“they are thoroughly permeated with the Sufi terminology and tenets
which typify the [Jewish Íúfí] Pietist writings, they voice an original
and specifically Jewish doctrine whose underlying inspiration was
Yehúdáh ha-Levi’s Kuzarí and Moses Maimonides Guide for the
Perplexed, tempered by Sufi ideology.”83 One of Rabbi Abraham’s
disciples was Moses Maimonides’ son, Abraham Maimonides (d.
1237), whose Kifáyat al-‘Abidín is one of the classics of Jewish
Íúfism. Samuel Rosenblatt, in his edition and translation of a portion
of that work, noted as early as 1927 that Abraham Maimonides:

> . . . not only openly shows his admiration for the Sufis by
> praising their way of life, calling them the real lineal
> descendents of the prophets, and regretting that the Jews do
> not imitate their example84, but his whole ethical system as
> outlined in the portion of the ‫ כפאיה‬85 with which we are
> concerned appears to be Sufic from beginning to end in
> terminology and ideology, or at least based on some Sufic
> prototype.86

Subsequent studies of this text have confirmed these assertions, and
have further revealed that Abraham stood at the head of a line of
Íúfí-inclined Maimonides, from his son down to his great-great-
grandson, who followed him not only in leading the Egyptian Jewish
community, but also in composing Jewish-Íúfí tracts and pressing
vigorously for Islamic-inspired modifications to the daily rituals of
Jewish life.87 From ‘Obaydah Maimonides, son of Abraham, we have
the deeply Íúfí work translated by Fenton as The Treatise of the Pool,
which follows the lead of the Kifáya in valorizing Íúfism as the
inheritor of the spiritual praxis of the ancient Israelite prophets and in
setting forth a mystical program cast in a Íúfí idiom. Three

generations later, with David Maimonides’ (d. 1415), we find the
Jewish-Íúfí pietist tradition still going strong. His Murshíd ilá al-
tafarrud (“The Guide to Detachment”) is remarkable for two reasons.
First of all, the range of Íúfí sources is much broader than was the
case for any previous Jewish-Íúfí, encompassing such luminaries as
Dhu’l-Nún al-Mißrí, Abú Tálib al-Makkí, al-Sarráj, Suhrawardí
Maqtúl, Ghazálí, the Andalusí Ibn al-‘Aríf, al-Qushayrí, and al-
Halláj.88 Secondly, this work also quotes writings of the early
Kabbalists, marking a significant attempt at dove-tailing the two
predominant phenomena of Spanish-born Jewish mysticism.

While this last example has described events and personalities
outside of al-Andalus, it is clear that such a movement as the Egyptian
Jewish-Íúfís could not have come into being were it not for the prior
interconfessional developments in Iberia. While Moses Maimonides,
the interconfessional Andalusí par excellence, does not appear to have
shown any direct affinity for Íúfism, it could be argued that his
attitude toward Greek and Islamic philosophy prepared the way for his
son’s approach toward Islamic mysticism. Moses Maimonides felt that
the mysteries of creation and of the divine chariot (ma’aseh bereshit
and ma’aseh merkaveh ), as found in the Torah, had been opaque to
Jews since Tannaitic times, the keys to their secrets having somehow
how been lost.89 His claim to have rediscovered them among the
wisdom of the “Gentiles,” in the Neoaristotelean corpus that would
provide the basis for his own philosophy and theology, is reflected in
his son’s claim to have found in the Íúfís the lost piety of the
prophets of Israel.

Islamic Theosophy: The Murcia School and Its
Interconfessional Conte xt

The figures that I will be concerned with here were all Íúfís born
in Murcia in south-eastern al-Andalus, sometimes referred to as
wujúdí Íúfís. Much like the Jewish theosophies considered above, the
Murcia school presents striking evidence of an interconfessional
context.

By far the most important figure of this school is Mu˙yí al-Dín
Ibn al-‘Arabí (d. 1240), the most influential theosopher of Islamic
history. In more than 400 books — the longest of which would cover
37 volumes in its projected critical edition — he presented an
astonishing synthesis of Islamic knowledge and spiritual reflection
into a grand mythological picture of the cosmos. Research into the
sources of his thought has been tentative at best, and like the
Kabbalah, has been at times subject to the whims of counter-history.90
As was the case with Scholem and Kabbalah, the occasional attempts
at tracing the history of his thought that have been made have paid

too little attention to the Andalusí context. For example, in the sole
monograph on the important doctrine of the “perfect man” in Ibn al-
‘Arabí, the author surveys Augustine and Ghazálí before concluding
that Ibn al-‘Arabí has the patent on the concept.91 More proximate
sources of possible precendents to Ibn al-‘Arabí’s usage is neglected,
and no attention is given to the fact that Maimonides uses the precise
terminology (al-insán al-kámil ) throughout the Guide, developing the
earlier usage of the term by the great Islamic philosopher, al-Fárábí.92

Ibn al-‘Arabí’s work is indeed of such a grandeur and profundity
that no intellectual history could “explain” it simply by identifying
sources and influences. However, his thought does not exist in a
vacuum, and the attribution of novelty to his formulation of Islamic
spirituality rings hollow when no attempt is made to mark off what is
truly new with him from what is drawn from his milieu. Again, I am
not going to attempt here to reconstruct the history of his thought,
but only to point out certain facts which place him in the context of
the Andalusí Judeo-Islamic symbiosis, a context in light of which the
history of Ibn al-‘Arabí and his influence needs to be rewritten.

Despite the vastness of his output, Ibn al-‘Arabí very rarely refers
to philosophical predecessors. Of the contacts with his
contemporaries, he refers several times to his meetings with Ibn
Rushd, but his judgment of the latter is a complex issue.93 He refers
in his magnum opus, the Futú˙át al-Makkiyya, to a discussion he had
with a Rabbi about the mystical significance of the letter “B,” (Arabic
bá`, Hebrew bet), with which both the Torah and the Qur’an begin.
In a number of places, he refers to the Torah, but these appear to be
very general allusions. And while his works lack any direct reference
to most of the towering figures of Islamic philosophy — al-Kindí, al-
Fárábí, Ibn Síná, Ibn Tufayl — he does refer at least twice to
Ba†alyúsí, which underlines the commonality of sources between he
and the Spanish Kabbalists. In a highly significant passage in the
Futú˙át, where Ibn al-‘Arabí describes his encounter with the
mysterious “Youth” around the Ka’aba, he quotes from the Theology
of Aristotle.94 Once again, Ibn al-‘Arabí shares the same critical
source-texts as the Judeo-Islamic philosophers and the Kabbalists.95

It is with two of Ibn al-‘Arabí’s Murcian compatriots, however,
that we find the most direct evidence of the interconfessional context
for this theosophy. ‘Abd al-Óaqq Ibn Sab’ín (d. 1270), a younger
contemporary of Ibn al-‘Arabí, propounded a radically pantheistic
doctrine, known in Islamic sources as wa˙dat al-wujúd, and insisted
fiercely on the independence of his thought.96 Thus, he directly
criticized Ibn Masarra and Ibn al-‘Arabí, his Andalusí predecessors,
while at the same time developing his system using their terminology.
The strikingly Hermetic character of Ibn Sab’ín and his school —
Hermes is included in the Sab’íniyyún silsilah - links it with Kabbalah,

which also found Hermeticism a fertile source for contemplation.97
Most importantly, though, Ibn Sab’ín found inspiration in Jewish
sources, citing Maimonides’ Guide of the Perplexed in his Risála
Núriyya98 and including the Jewish angels Yahoel and Metatron in an
invocation found in his treatise on the letter qáf.99 His philosophical
correspondence with Emperor Frederick II further displays his
knowledge of Maimonidean thought.100 A later follower of both Ibn
Sab’ín and Ibn al-‘Arabí, the thirteenth-century Egyptian magician al-
Búní, also “included Metatron in his repertoire, along with other
Jewish motifs.”101

This interconfessionalism becomes even more pronounced when
we consider the career of Ibn Sab’ín’s disciple, the fellow-Murcian Ibn
Húd (d. 1300), who worked as a physician and mystical guide in
Damascus, finding clients among both Muslims and Jews. He is said
to have proclaimed his readiness to guide any aspirant in any of the
three ways — Christianity, Judaism, or Islam. Following Ibn Sab’ín’s
interest in Maimonides, Ibn Húd is known to have taught the Guide
of the Perplexed to Damascene Jews. One source calls him the
“Shaykh of the Jews,” and Kraemer suggests that there may have been
some connection between Ibn Húd’s circle in Damascus and the
“Jewish Súfís” of Cairo.102 Obviously, while the school of Murcia may
have been concerned first and foremost with the inner meaning of the
Qur’an, their contributions to the history of Islamicate thought
cannot be understood without placing them in the context of
Andalusí interconfessionalism.

Conclusion

It should be clear by now how limited such historiographical
distinctions as those between philosophy and mysticism, or even
between Muslim and Jew, ultimately are in aiding our understanding
of the movements considered above. It can also be unequivocally
stated that any explanation of the Judeo-Islamic symbiosis in al-
Andalus that rests on the assumption that “the high culture of the
[Muslims] was to a great degree secular”103 is absurd. What we find in
these events and personalities is not simply thinkers who were
incidentally Jewish interacting creatively with counterparts who were
incidentally Muslim. On the contrary, we find here an
interpenetration and crosspollination of values, of precisely religious
ideas and ideals. The ever-eloquent Lenn Goodman wrote, referring to
the medieval Judeo-Islamic philosophical “conversation”:

> What we learn from these conversations, as we cock our ears
> to listen, is first to doubt and then to deny the stereotypic
> notions of nineteenth-century scholarship that would assign
to each race and nation a particular genius or spirit of its

> own, uncommunicable and inscrutable to any other,
> incapable of mixture without adulteration of each distinctive
> and    pristine   essence,     but   transparent,  invisible,
> unexchangeable and uncriticisible by those who share it or
> those who live within its thrall.104
In these words lies a compelling critique of the whole
historiographic debate over convivencia, which sees in medieval Spain
an experience of human “togetherness” only through the lens of
reified differences, naturalized ideological divides. Obviously, such
lines were not drawn on the landscape. In terms of what this suggests
for how we approach the history of mysticism, consider this
influential declaration by Gershom Scholem:

> There is no mysticism as such, there is only the mysticism of
> a particular religious system, Christian, Islamic, Jewish
> mysticism and so on.105

This historian’s appeal itself begs the question of historicity, for what,
indeed, is a religious system “as such?”

The recontextualization that I have argued for here challenges not
only the prevailing historiographical approaches to the beginnings of
the Jewish and Islamic philosophical mysticisms of the Middle Ages; it
also questions the common Western view of medieval Islam as a
civilization “intermediate” between the Hellenistic Age and the
Renaissance,106 whose sole purpose in the grand telos of history was to
rescue the torch of Greek enlightenment that it might duly be passed
to Europe, its rightful inheritor.107 The importance of the Andalusí
“Golden Age” in the development of Western civilization cannot be
gainsaid, but nor should this symbiotic achievement be seen as having
been without issue for the Islamicate world. Far from being simply
passed on, the torch held aloft in al-Andalus fired not only the
scientific revolutions of Europe; it also flooded with its lights the
minds of the Jewish and Muslim mystics of the East.

\[77\] I have noted a great many similarities between the Abulafian
