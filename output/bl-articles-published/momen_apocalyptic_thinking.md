      Apocalyptic Thinking and Process Thinking:
> A Bahá’í Contribution to Religious Thought

Moojan Momen

The key feature of classical religious apocalyptic thinking is that affairs are
static until they are suddenly moved from one state to another by God.
Thus the change in affairs is sudden and immediate and it is supernaturally
directed and actioned. Human beings are passive participants in this in
that although the change usually affects them they play no part in bring-
ing the change about. The Báb and Bahá’u’lláh initiated a change in this
type of religious thinking. They initiated the idea that religious change is
a process not a jump from one state to another and that it is to be brought
about through human effort and not by a magical Divine intervention. In
this paper, this change in religious thinking will be examined in relation
to Bahá’í expectations of the peace, about which there was a great deal of
apocalyptic thinking in the years prior to 2000. The main features that are
a precondition or accompaniment of peace as described in the Bahá’í texts
are listed and then the extent to which these have come to pass in the course
of the twentieth century is considered. From this, a sequence of four stages
for the fulfillment of these features is delineated. It is furthermore suggested
that all of these features reached the third stage during the twentieth cen-
tury. It is therefore for this reason that the Universal House of Justice was
able at the close of the 20th century to confirm `Abdu’l-Bahá’s description of
this century as the “Century of Light”.

There are a number of ways in which the religion initiated by the Báb
and Bahá’u’lláh produced a major change in structures of religious
thought. One of these is the change from what I will for the purposes
of this paper call apocalyptic thinking to process thinking.

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

In classical religious apocalyptic thinking, affairs are static until they
are suddenly moved from one state to another by God. The key fea-
tures of this then are that the change is sudden and immediate and
it is supernaturally directed and actioned. Human beings are passive
participants in this in that although the change usually affects them
they play no part in bringing the change about. This type of thinking
tends to see matters in black-and-white terms and favours the literal
and physical interpretation of texts.

The Báb and Bahá’u’lláh initiated a change in this type of religious
thinking. They initiated the idea that religious change is a process not
a jump from one state to another and that it is to be brought about
through human effort and not by a magical Divine intervention. This
type of thinking favours the spiritual and metaphorical interpretation
of texts and texts to see matters as a rainbow of colours or shades of
grey—rather than black-and-white. Thus for example, the Báb and
Bahá’u’lláh came to a world that was expecting, as a result of their
reading of their scriptures, that the Promised One would arrive and
within a short space of time defeat the forces of evil and establish
justice throughout the world. After this would come the Day of
Judgement or Day of Resurrection. All of these were events that
would happen by Divine intervention suddenly and within a short
space of time. Humans would for the most part, especially in rela-
tion to the events of the Day of Resurrection, be passive participants.

The Báb and Bahá’u’lláh spent much of their ministries and much of
their writings with interpreting these religious expectations. They
explained that these passages of scripture are metaphorical and
spiritual descriptions, not intended to be taken literally. God does not
work in this magical interventionist way. The scriptures of the past do
write of a Day of God but they also write that a day of God is as one
thousand years in human reckoning. The promised saviour will estab-
lish his sovereignty and will establish justice in the world but it will
be a slow process taking one thousand years. Furthermore, it will be

Apocalyptic Thinking and Process Thinking

the actions of human beings that will bring about this transformation.
This may be described as a change from static, magical or apocalyptic
thinking to process thinking.

However, this change in religious thinking is not just confined to
interpretation of the prophecies of the past. It also applies to the
vision that the Central Figures of the Bahá’í Faith present about
the future direction of the world. While the interpretations of past
prophecies have been comparatively easy for the Bahá’í community
to accept and internalize, this application of the new way of thinking
has been more difficult to adopt when projected forward to future
events. In this paper, I want to examination this change of religious
thinking by examining an example that demonstrates this.

The Bahá’í Teachings about Peace
One of the main features of the vision of a future society that
Bahá’u’lláh brings is that there will be peace. This peace is envisaged
as occurring in two stages: The Lesser Peace (which is how Shoghi
Effendi translates both ṣulḥ’-i-aṣ’ghar and ṣulḥ’-i akbar), a political
peace brought about by the governments of the world and needing
to be enforced; a Greater Peace or Most Great Peace (ṣulḥ’-i a`ẓ’am),
an enduring more deeply-rooted peace brought about by the wide-
spread acceptance of the Bahá’í teachings. Although many Bahá’ís
think of these two as successive events, first the Lesser Peace and
then the Most Great Peace, it will appear from the evidence I cite in
this paper that the authoritative Bahá’í texts see these two processes
as intertwined and evolving together. Among the features and neces-
sary pre-conditions for peace found in the writings of the Central
Figures of the Bahá’í Faith it is sometimes not clear whether the
feature refers to the Lesser Peace or the Most Great Peace, but since
these are concurrently developing and inter-twined processes, the

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

difference need not concern us here. The following is a list of these
features and pre-conditions:

1\. The need for a world assembly of leaders and governments that would
confer for the purpose of establishing peace. (GWB 249), (ESW30–
31), (SDC, 64–5) This would be a feature of the Lesser Peace.

2\. The establishment by the world’s leaders of arrangements about
collective security—an agreement made that if any government later
violate any one of the provisions of these treaties, “all the governments
on earth should arise to reduce it to utter submission.” (GWB 249; ESW
31; SDC 65). This would be a feature of the Lesser Peace.

3\. The establishment of the World Commonwealth, Shoghi Effendi
says that this ‘momentous and historic step’ will involve the ‘recon-
struction of mankind, as the result of the universal recognition of its
oneness and wholeness’ (PDC 122).

4. Another key feature of peace described by Shoghi Effendi, is that
of ‘some form of a world superstate’ that must needs be ‘be evolved’
(WOB. 40), although this would appear to be more of a feature of the
Most Great Peace than of the Lesser Peace.

5\. The general features of this world commonwealth and world super-
state should include:
• “This commonwealth must, as far as we can visualize it,

> consist of a world legislature, whose members will, as the
> trustees of the whole of mankind, ultimately control the
> entire resources of all the component nations, and will
> enact such laws as shall be required to regulate the life,
> satisfy the needs and adjust the relationships of all races
> and peoples.

Apocalyptic Thinking and Process Thinking

• A world executive, backed by an international Force, will

> carry out the decisions arrived at, and apply the laws
> enacted by, this world legislature, and will safeguard the
> organic unity of the whole commonwealth.

• A world tribunal will adjudicate and deliver its compulsory

> and final verdict in all and any disputes that may arise
> between the various elements constituting this universal
> system.

• A mechanism of world intercommunication will be devised,

> embracing the whole planet, freed from national hindrances
> and restrictions, and functioning with marvellous swiftness
> and perfect regularity.

• A world metropolis will act as the nerve center of a world

> civilization, the focus towards which the unifying forces of
> life will converge and from which its energizing influences
> will radiate.

• A world language will either be invented or chosen from

> among the existing languages and will be taught in the
> schools of all the federated nations as an auxiliary to their
> mother tongue.

• A world script, a world literature, a uniform and universal

> system of currency, of weights and measures, will simplify
> and facilitate intercourse and understanding among the
> nations and races of mankind.”(WOB 203–4)

6\. Among the characteristics of the world society in which this
super-state will operate as described by Shoghi Effendi as being:

• ‘all economic barriers will have been permanently

demolished’

• ‘the interdependence of Capital and Labour definitely

recognized’

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

• ‘the clamour of religious fanaticism and strife will have been

forever stilled’

• ‘the flame of racial animosity will have been finally

extinguished’

• a single code of international law—the product of the

> considered judgment of the world’s federated representa-
> tives—shall have as its sanction the instant and coercive
> intervention of the combined forces of the federated units’

• ‘the fury of a capricious and militant nationalism will have

> been transmuted into an abiding consciousness of world
> citizenship’ (WOB 41)

7\. The presence of peace should allow nations to disarm and reinvest
their expenditure on armaments into constructive developmental
activities. This principle was first stated by Bahá’u’lláh (TB 165)

To this list should also be added the Seven Candles of Unity that
`Abdu’l-Bahá lists and links to peace:

> Hence the unity of all mankind can in this day be achieved.
> Verily this is none other but one of the wonders of this won-
> drous age, this glorious century. Of this past ages have been
> deprived, for this century—the century of light—hath been
> endowed with unique and unprecedented glory, power and
> illumination. Hence the miraculous unfolding of a fresh marvel
> every day. Eventually it will be seen how bright its candles will
> burn in the assemblage of man.

> Behold how its light is now dawning upon the world’s darkened
> horizon.

• The first candle is unity in the political realm, the early glim-

merings of which can now be discerned.

Apocalyptic Thinking and Process Thinking

• The second candle is unity of thought in world undertakings,

the consummation of which will erelong be witnessed.

• The third candle is unity in freedom which will surely come

to pass.

• The fourth candle is unity in religion which is the corner-stone

> of the foundation itself, and which, by the power of God, will
> be revealed in all its splendour.

• The fifth candle is the unity of nations—a unity which in this

> century will be securely established, causing all the peoples
> of the world to regard themselves as citizens of one common
> fatherland.

• The sixth candle is unity of races, making of all that dwell on

earth peoples and kindreds of one race.

• The seventh candle is unity of language, i.e., the choice of a

> universal tongue in which all peoples will be instructed and
> converse.

> Each and every one of these will inevitably come to pass, inas-
> much as the power of the Kingdom of God will aid and assist in
> their realization. (SWAB 32)

In all, from these passages, a list of about 25 points related to the
coming of peace can be drawn up.

Bahá’í expectations of the Lesser Peace
It is clear that many Bahá’ís, locked into the older static pattern of
religious thought were expecting the Lesser Peace to arrive through
a miraculous Divine intervention. From as early as the start of the
twentieth century, Bahá’ís were speculating as to the date that it
would arrive. One of the first to set a date for the arrival of peace

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

was Ibrahim Kheiralla, who interpreting a prophecy in Daniel,
concluded that peace would come in 1917. Although Kheiralla was
discredited and expelled from the Bahá’í community, his idea about
the “time of the end” and the dawn of peace occurring in 1917 lived
on in the Bahá’í community and was referred to by other Bahá’ís.1
Even after this date passed, however, the expectation of a sudden
advent of world peace continued. The Second World War obviously
made some think that this was the calamity that should precede the
advent of peace. Some focused on the year 1957, because of their
understanding of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s words regarding a prophecy in the
Bible, others looked to 1963 as the fulfilment of that same prophecy.
The centenary of the proclamation of Bahá’u’lláh to the kings and
leaders of the world excited attention because the Universal House
of Justice, in referring to this wrote that “the hundred years’ respite”
has ended and “the struggle between the forces of darkness—man’s
lower nature—and the rising sun of the Divine teachings which draw
him on to his true station, intensifies day by day.” (The Universal
House of Justice, Messages 1963 to 1986, p. 113). The centenary
of the passing of Bahá’u’lláh in 1992 was another occasion when
expectations heightened. Up to the year 2000, it was not unusual
to find Bahá’ís stating that the Lesser Peace would come by the
year 2000.2 Evidence of the continuing speculation among Bahá’ís
regarding this matter can be found in the need that the Universal
House of Justice felt to issue letters trying to play down these expec-
tations among Bahá’ís.3 The significant aspect of these predictions
was that those Bahá’ís who were most involved in these speculations
usually expected peace to arrive out of thin air, with no human effort
required. They were, thus, caught up in what I have named above as
an apocalyptic mode of thought.

This mode of apocalyptic thought existed despite the fact that the
authoritative Bahá’í texts say something different. What is clear
from texts that we have from `Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi is

Apocalyptic Thinking and Process Thinking

that the coming of the Lesser Peace and the Most Great Peace is a
slow evolving process:

> Gradually whatsoever is latent in the innermost of this Holy
> Cycle shall appear and be made manifest, for now is but the
> beginning of its growth and the dayspring of the revelation of
> its Signs. Ere the close of this Century and of this Age, it shall
> be made clear and manifest how wondrous was that Springtide
> and how heavenly was that Gift! (BA 15–16)

> The kingdom of peace, salvation, uprightness, and reconcili-
> ation is founded in the invisible world, and it will by degrees
> become manifest and apparent through the power of the Word
> of God! (BWF 409)

> To the general character, the implications and features of
> this world commonwealth, destined to emerge, sooner or
> later, out of the carnage, agony, and havoc of this great world
> convulsion, I have already referred in my previous communi-
> cations. Suffice it to say that this consummation will, by its
> very nature, be a gradual process…. (PDC 122–3)

Peace as a Process
I now propose to show how process thinking has been applied
by the Bahá’í leaders to these 25 points related to the coming of
peace. When at the end of World War I, Woodrow Wilson drew
up his 14 points to be the guiding principles for an enduring peace
and established the League of Nations, `Abdu’l-Bahá is reported by
Shoghi Effendi to have declared that these achievements signalled
the “Dawn of the Most Great Peace”. (CF 36). This points to the fact
that the developments towards the Lesser Peace and the Most Great
Peace are intertwined and occurring together not successively.

Similarly, Shoghi Effendi, writing in 1936, hailed a decision by the
League of Nations in October 1935 to sanction Italy for an act of
aggression towards Ethiopia as “one of the most distinctive milestones
on the long and arduous road that must lead it to its goal, the stage
at which the oneness of the whole body of nations will be made the
ruling principle of international life.” ( WOB 193).

This quotation establishes an important point of principle in this way
of thinking about world events. Even though that particular action
of the League of Nations was unsuccessful, the important point for
Shoghi Effendi was that the principle had been established—for
him this was an important step—it would only be a matter of time
before the principle would be universally enforced. In other words
that things progress by a number of steps: that first a principle is
established in one particular case then gradually it becomes more
universally acknowledged.

Writing in 1941, and despite being in the midst of World War II,
Shoghi Effendi commented on yet further progress along the path
towards peace:

> The world is, in truth, moving on towards its destiny. The
> interdependence of the peoples and nations of the earth,
> whatever the leaders of the divisive forces of the world may
> say or do, is already an accomplished fact. Its unity in the eco-
> nomic sphere is now understood and recognized. (PDC 200)

This points to another principle that: that there may be what appear
to be major reverses at the hands of the “leaders of the divisive forces
of the world” but that such reverses are only temporary and may
even be necessary steps in the long-term evolving process described
in the Bahá’í texts. This fact is more clearly enunciated in the fol-
lowing quotation:

> Whatever the present status of the League or the outcome of
> its historic verdict, whatever the trials and reverses which, in
> the immediate future, it may have to face and sustain, the fact
> must be recognized that so important a decision marks one of
> the most distinctive milestones on the long and arduous road
> that must lead it to its goal, the stage at which the oneness of
> the whole body of nations will be made the ruling principle of
> international life. (WOB 193)

Features of the Processes leading to Peace
We can now look at the various features that are necessary precondi-
tions or accompaniments of the process towards peace and see how far
the process leading to this progressed during the twentieth century.

> A. The first element of the Lesser Peace that we can look at is the
> need for a world assembly of leaders and governments that would
> confer for the purpose of establishing peace. (Bahá’u’lláh GWB 249;
`Abdu’l-Bahá, SDC 64–5)

Now it is clear that the convocation called for by Bahá’u’lláh and
`Abdu’l-Bahá has not occurred but it is equally clear that the establish-

> ment of the League of Nations, the United Nations and particularly
> the round of major summits that occurred in the last decade of the
> twentieth century, bringing together world leaders to discuss such
> subjects as sustainable development, the position of women, the
> environment and particularly the Millennium Summit that brought
> the world leaders together to review the past and look forward to the
> future—these are all important advances towards that process.

B. Among the items that the Bahá’í writings state that the world’s
leaders need to agree about are arrangements about collective secu-
rity—an agreement made that if any government later violate any

one of the provisions of these treaties, “all the governments on earth
should arise to reduce it to utter submission.” (SDC 65)

Such arrangements have existed in theory ever since the establishment
of the League of Nations. Indeed when in October 1935, the League
decided to impose sanctions on Italy over its invasion of Ethiopia,
Shoghi Effendi acclaimed this:

> For the first time in the history of humanity the system
> of collective security, foreshadowed by Bahá’u’lláh and
> explained by ‘Abdu’lBahá, has been seriously envisaged, dis-
> cussed and tested. For the first time in history it has been
> officially recognized and publicly stated that for this system
> of collective security to be effectively established strength
> and elasticity are both essential strength involving the use
> of an adequate force to ensure the efficacy of the proposed
> system, and elasticity to enable the machinery that has been
> devised to meet the legitimate needs and aspirations of its
> aggrieved upholders. For the first time in human history
> tentative efforts have been exerted by the nations of the
> world to assume collective responsibility, and to supplement
> their verbal pledges by actual preparation for collective
> action. And again, for the first time in history, a movement
> of public opinion has manifested itself in support of the ver-
> dict which the leaders and representatives of nations have
> pronounced, and for securing collective action in pursuance
> of such a decision. (WOB 191192.)

Again the principle was invoked in the United Nations when com-
munist forces invaded Korea just after the second World War. After
that however, the world appeared to forget about it until 1992 when
Iraq invaded Kuwait and the Gulf War was launched again invoking
and re-awakening the awareness of this principle. Now of course the
energetic response of the USA was not pure altruism and a sense of

global responsibility on the part of the USA and was much more
concerned with protecting its sources of oil, but nevertheless an
important principle has been established. The Universal House of
Justice in message of Riḍván 1991, referred to the importance of this
event in the process: “The forces which united the remedial reactions
of so many nations to the sudden crisis in this region demonstrated
beyond any doubt the necessity of the principle of collective security
prescribed by Bahá’u’lláh more than a century ago as a means of
resolving conflict. While the international arrangement envisioned
by Him for the full application of this principle is far from having
been adopted by the rulers of mankind, a long step towards the
behaviour outlined for the nations by the Lord of the Age has thus
been taken.”

The agreement by Indonesia to pull back from its occupation of East
Timor in 1999 is another example of this principle gradually coming
to the fore.

> C. Regarding the establishment of the World Commonwealth, Shoghi
> Effendi says that this ‘momentous and historic step’ will involve the
‘reconstruction of mankind, as the result of the universal recognition

> of its oneness and wholeness’ (PDC 122). And the Universal House
> of Justice has stated that “Acceptance of the oneness of mankind is
> the first fundamental prerequisite for reorganization and administra-
> tion of the world as one country, the home of humankind. Universal
> acceptance of this spiritual principle is essential to any successful
> attempt to establish world peace.” ( PWP 10)

At first glance, it would appear that the world is a long way away from
acknowledging this principle. But if we consider more closely, we can
see that enormous strides have been made in this direction during
the twentieth century. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide,
the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights all mark

major steps forward from the situation earlier in the twentieth cen-
tury when large parts of the human race were considered inferior and
not deserving of any rights by other parts. All these steps have been
taken in the last fifty years or so.

D. A third feature of the peace described by Shoghi Effendi, is that
of ‘some form of a world superstate’ that must needs be ‘be evolved’
(WOB 40). Our first reaction may be to think that we are a long
way away from such a world government. But Shoghi Effendi says
that this is something that will evolve and not something that will
suddenly appear and if we have this long-term evolutionary vision of
Shoghi Effendi and we look around us, we can see much evidence of
its evolving presence in our midst. At the United Nations, a report
on global Governance was commissioned and there has been talk of
convening a summit to consider this report.

The first step towards the creation of a true world government
is, Shoghi Effendi says, ‘the inevitable curtailment of unfettered
national sovereignty’. Those features of sovereignty which will need
to be curtailed are:

• ‘every claim to make war,

• certain rights to impose taxation and

• all rights to maintain armaments, except for the purposes

> of maintaining internal order within their respective
> dominions’. (WOB 40)

Now we do not see much evidence of this happening in the world at
large, but if we look at what is happening within the European Union,
then we see a group of nations which throughout the twentieth cen-
tury went to war twice with each other in a major way—and they
have agreed to curtail their unfettered national sovereignty, they have
agreed to limit certain rights to impose taxation, and they are in the
process of co-ordinating their foreign policies which would inevitably

lead to a curtailment of their right to make war and therefore logically
also of their right to maintain independent armies.

So on a smaller scale, the very conditions that Shoghi Effendi sets
are being put into effect—the principle of putting limits on unfet-
tered national sovereignty are being accepted. And it should be
born in mind that until fifty years ago this principle was considered
sacrosanct and unassailable.

Furthermore, we have seen an international example of the refusal of
the world’s governments to allow the principle of unfettered national
sovereignty to over-ride concerns about human rights abuses in the
example of what happened in Kosovo in 1999. The world refused to
allow a national government to do whatever it liked within its own
internationally-recognized borders. More recently, this has happened
again in the case of Libya in 2011.

E. Let us look at the accessories that Shoghi Effendi said would have
to exist alongside this “world super-state”:

Such a state will have to include within its orbit

• an international executive adequate to enforce supreme and

> unchallengeable authority on every recalcitrant member of
> the commonwealth;

• a world parliament whose members shall be elected by the

> people in their respective countries and whose election
> shall be confirmed by their respective governments;

and a supreme tribunal whose judgement will have a binding effect
even in such cases where the parties concerned did not voluntarily
agree to submit their case to its consideration. (WOB 40–41)

Elsewhere he says that this world super-state will be ‘backed by an
International force’ (WOB 203)

Again all of these things may on the one hand be considered to be
very remote from the present situation of the world. But, if we look
with a long-term evolutionary vision, we can see the seeds of them
already present.

We have an international executive in the office of the secretary-
general of the United Nations. It does not yet have the power “to
enforce supreme and unchallengeable authority on every recalcitrant
member” of the United Nations but at least it exists. In the case of
the European Union, we even have the beginnings of a supra-national
executive with limited powers to enforce itself upon its member states.
We also have “a world parliament” in the United Nations General
Assembly. It is not yet one “whose members shall be elected by the
people in their respective countries,” but the European Parliament is.
Again, an International Court of Justice exists based in the Hague.
It does not yet have the right to intervene in cases where either part
has not agreed to submit to its jurisdiction, but other supra-national
courts, such as the European Court of Human Rights, do have this
right. The establishment of the International Criminal Court was
a further major step in the movement towards having a world legal
system that over-rides national sovereignty. And with respect to an
international force that will back up the world super-state, we can
again see the seeds of this in the various United Nations forces that
are operating in different parts of the world.

Other elements in this statement of Shoghi Effendi include:
• A mechanism of world intercommunication will be

> devised, embracing the whole planet, freed from national
> hindrances and restrictions, and functioning with mar-
> vellous swiftness and perfect regularity.

• A world metropolis will act as the nerve center of a world

> civilization, the focus towards which the unifying forces of
> life will converge and from which its energizing influences
> will radiate.

• A world language will either be invented or chosen from

> among the existing languages and will be taught in the
> schools of all the federated nations as an auxiliary to their
> mother tongue.

• A world script, a world literature, a uniform and universal

> system of currency, of weights and measures, will simplify
> and facilitate intercourse and understanding among the
> nations and races of mankind.” (WOB 203–4)

The first of these can be said to have been achieved with the advent of
the internet, which occurred during the last decade of the twentieth
century. There are no signs of the second occurring at the world level
although on a continental level, Brussels and Strasbourg are competing
to become the “nerve centre” of the European Union. The development
of a world language is identical to `Abdu’l-Baha’s seventh candle and
is discussed below. There have been a few developments in the fourth
point above with the kilogram and kilometre being increasingly the
world system of weights and measures, while a European currency has
emerged in the course of the twentieth century.

F. We can also examine some of the characteristics of the world
society in which this super-state will operate, as they have been
described by Shoghi Effendi:
• ‘all economic barriers will have been permanently

demolished’

• ‘the interdependence of Capital and Labour definitely

recognized’

• ‘the clamour of religious fanaticism and strife will have

been forever stilled’

• ‘the flame of racial animosity will have been finally

extinguished’

• a single code of international law—the product of the

> considered judgment of the world’s federated representa-
> tives—shall have as its sanction the instant and coercive
> intervention of the combined forces of the federated units’

• ‘the fury of a capricious and militant nationalism will

> have been transmuted into an abiding consciousness of
> world citizenship’ (WOB 41)

We can see that gradually all of these elements are falling into place:
economic barriers are collapsing—we already have a globalized
economy (the main area which is not yet globalized is that of the
protectionist policies of the United States and Europe towards their
agriculture and heavy industries); the interdependence of Capital
and Labour are largely already recognized; the clamour of religious
fanaticism and strife cannot be said to be stilled but at least they are
widely recognized as undesirable; a single code of international law
cannot yet be said to have been put into place, but there is a growing
body of international law which is acknowledged as binding by the
nations of the world.

G. The presence of the Lesser Peace should allow nations to dis-
arm and reinvest their expenditure on armaments into constructive
developmental activities

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been consider-
able talk of a “peace dividend”. Numerous US and other military bases
around the world have been closed down and military expenditure was
cut back. Again I know that there has been a reversal of this process in
the last few years but again the principle has been established, the idea
implanted and eventually it will lead to fruition.

H. With regard to `Abdu’l-Bahá’s Seven Candles of Unity, a number
of significant advances have been made:

1\. Unity in the Political Realm
It is not immediately obvious what `Abdu’l-Bahá means by this until
we look at some other quotations. `Abdu’l-Bahá in Promulgation
of Universal Peace talks of “national unity where various peoples live
under one form of government such as French, German, British, etc.; and
political unity, which conserves the civil rights of parties or factions of
the same government.” (PUP 191) Thus this level of unity may imply
the achievement of a situation where the various racial, political and
social groupings within a country feel that they are being treated
justly and therefore able to unite politically. We will consider this
candle again when we come to the 5th candle.

2\. Unity in World Undertakings
The Universal House of Justice in its letter to the Bahá’ís introducing
the document The Prosperity of Humankind in 1995, sees the recent
round of United Nations conferences as ‘capstones to the myriad
activities taking place in different parts of the world involving a wide
range of non-governmental organizations and networks in an urgent
search for values, ideas and practical measures that can advance pros-
pects for the peaceful development of all peoples’ and it considers that
in these conferences and activities can be discerned ‘the gathering
momentum of an emerging unity of thought in world undertakings,
the realization of which our sacred scriptures describe as one of the
lights of unity that will illumine the path to peace’. Shoghi Effendi
has also commented on this second candle that it might also involve
the development of a universal culture. (CC2, no. 1628, 195)

3\. Unity in Freedom.
During the twentieth century, we saw a number of important
developments. At the time that `Abdu’l-Bahá was writing, most of
the world was either under colonial control or under despotic and

authoritarian governments. There could be no real unity when such
inequalities and lack of freedom exist. The twentieth century saw
the emergences of new states out of colonial control. Similarly, the
twentieth century saw many other nations emerging from centuries
of authoritarian monarchical structures into freer democratic ones.
Not all of the peoples of the world can yet be said to be free but it is a
process that is well under way.

Other aspects of this unity in freedom are of course freeing of women
from centuries of oppression under male-dominated societies, the
freeing of the working and agricultural classes from the oppression
of the ruling classes and feudal social structures, and the freeing of
ethnic minorities and castes from subservience to the upper echelons
of society.

4\. Unity in Religion.
Arguably, this is the area of these seven candles of unity in which
humanity has achieved the least progress. The Universal House of
Justice has acknowledged this in its letter to the world’s religious
leaders issued in 2002, calling upon them to take a lead in this sphere.
There was however, in 1992, a revival of the Parliament of the World’s
Religions and there have been a number of other initiatives such as
the World Conference on Religions and Peace (since 1970) and the
Summit on Religions and Conservation (1993).

5\. Unity of Nations.
The achievement of the unity of nations is what `Abdu’l-Bahá stated
would be achieved in the course of the twentieth century—not the
Lesser Peace as many have thought.

> In relation to the decision of the League of Nations to impose sanc-
> tion on Italy in 1935, referred to above, Shoghi Effendi asserted that
“the fact must be recognized that so important a decision marks one

of the most distinctive milestones on the long and arduous road that

must lead it to its goal, the stage at which the oneness of the whole
body of nations will be made the ruling principle of international life.”
(WOB 193.)

Since then we have seen the United Nations emerge with much
stronger powers than the League of Nations had and several bodies
coming together forming regional unities of nations. All of these are
steps along this pathway. However, the union of nations seems to
point to something more than just political union which is the first
candle. Shoghi Effendi was asked by Marion Hoffman about the
difference between the first (which was unity in the political realm)
and the fifth candle, and he replied:

> With reference to your question concerning `Abdu’l-Bahá ‘s
> reference to “unity in the political realm”: this unity should
> be clearly distinguished from the “unity of nations”. The first
> is a unity which politically independent and sovereign states
> achieve among themselves; while the second is one which is
> brought about between nations, the difference between a
> state and a nation being that the former, as you know, is a
> political entity without necessarily being homogeneous in
> race, whereas the second implies national as well as political
> homogeneity. (CC no. 1623 194)

> Thus it would appear that unity in the political realm is one that is
> achieved at the governmental level while unity of nations is a unity
> that is achieved by the peoples of the nations of the world. Thus
`Abdu’l-Bahá is here pointing to a deeper underlying consciousness of

> the oneness of humanity. This consciousness can be discerned to be
> slowly emerging. We saw it for example in the response that ordinary
> people made to the famine in the Sudan and to disasters elsewhere.
> People are increasingly gaining a consciousness of themselves as
> members of a single human family and the feeling that what happens

to people on the other side of the world is happening to members of
their family.

6\. Unity of Races
At the beginning of the twentieth century, there was, among the
European nations, a general acceptance of the idea that the white
races were superior to the other races. Racist ideologies were widely
accepted and very fashionable. The last part of the twentieth century
saw the discrediting of these racist ideas and the relegation of rac-
ism to an intellectual back-water. Politically, racism survives in many
parts of the world but is under increasing pressure even in these parts.

7\. Unity of Language
This is a principle which was enunciated by Bahá’u’lláh (TB 22)
and also mentioned in the lists of Shoghi Effendi (see above). The
concept was widely discussed during the twentieth century and
Esperanto was widely advocated for this purpose. Again while on
the surface, not much progress has been made in this area, in fact,
the last few decades have seen the establishment of English as the
international language in the areas of business and finance, science
and the academic world, and in youth culture.

The Calamity
With regard to apocalyptic thought in the Bahá’í community, it is
also necessary to deal with the points made by those who object to
these arguments against apocalyptic thinking and point to the fact
that far from speaking of the future as a process, Bahá’u’lláh has
clearly stated that a calamity will precede the coming of peace and
that this will occur suddenly, apocalyptically:

> And when the appointed hour is come, there shall suddenly
> (baghtatan) appear that which shall cause the limbs of mankind

> to quake. Then, and only then, will the Divine Standard be
> unfurled, and the Nightingale of Paradise warble its melody.

(GWB 118–9)

Such a quotation strengthens the conviction of many Bahá’ís that there
will be some apocalyptic event—a calamity followed by the advent of
peace. If we read the letters of the Universal House of Justice, however,
we find that this institution has indicated that we have already passed
through the calamity.

The calamity is a feature of the Age of Transition and, as long ago as
October 1967, we find the Universal House of Justice indicating that
the calamity had begun:

> As humanity enters the dark heart of this age of transition
> our course is clear. (MUHJ63 114)

For the next few years, there are indications that humanity continued
to be in this dark heart; see the following example from June 1983:

> The dark horizon faced by a world which has failed to recog-
> nize the Promised One, the Source of its salvation, acutely
> affects the outlook of the younger generations. (WH 158)

And even more clearly in a letter from February 1984, the fact that
humanity is in the midst of the calamity is stated:

> …the believers should understand that a catastrophic break-
> down of human society as a result of mankind’s ignoring His
> Message has been clearly foretold by Bahá’u’lláh, and that
> we are, indeed, in the midst of such a breakdown.4

Then in its Riḍván message of 1988, the Universal indicated that we
were through the worst part of this calamity and able to see the silver
lining at the end of the cloud:

> A silver lining to the dark picture which has overshadowed
> most of this century now brightens the horizon. (WH 54)

Although even two years later in Riḍván 1990, the Universal House
of Justice was warning that reverses could still occur, nevertheless,
their language was such as to indicate that the worst was over:

> Hopeful as are the signs, we cannot forget that the dark pas-
> sage of the Age of Transition has not been fully traversed; it
> is as yet long, slippery and tortuous.5

Thus it appears that the Universal House of Justice thinks that the
calamity was a process that has been going on for several decades
and the worst of which is now behind us—although there is still a
possibility for reverses. Thus this “suddenly” of Bahá’u’lláh would
appear to be similar to the Divine “Day” and consists of an extended
period of time and this calamity is seen in Bahá’í terms as a process
and not an apocalyptic event.

Summary
In summary, this process way of thinking in relation to the progress
made towards peace reveals the following features:

A. The Bahá’í Faith holds that God does not usually intervene in
the world in dramatic miraculous ways (or only rarely) forcing His
will upon humanity, rather He works by slowly evolving processes
over long periods of time, inviting human beings to participate in
these processes.

B. With regard to the establishment of the features of the vision of
the Bahá’í Faith for the future of humanity, this process can be said
to consist of a number of stages:

> 1. The enunciation of a principle in the writings of the Central
> Figures of the Bahá’í Faith.

> 2. The independent enunciation of the principle by a gov-
> ernment or inter-governmental body and its insertion into
> international treaties or declarations.

> 3. The partial implementation of the principle, thus establish-
> ing it as a reality on the international stage. This may involve
> an unsuccessful attempt to implement the principle (as in
> the case of the response to Italy’s invasion of Ethiopia or
> the United Nations as an implementation of a World Com-
> monwealth) or an implementation that is geographically
> circumscribed and does not yet involve all nations (as in
> the steps towards the creation of a super-state within the
> European Union).

> 4. The general and full implementation of the principle such
> that it becomes regarded as the norm in world politics.

Only a few of the features of peace, as delineated in the authoritative
Bahá’í texts can be said to have achieved stage 4 (for example the
Internet can be said to be the fulfilment of the need for a “mechanism
of world intercommunication will be devised, embracing the whole
planet, freed from national hindrances and restrictions, and func-
tioning with marvellous swiftness and perfect regularity”). Most of
the features of peace delineated in the text above did however reach
stage 3 during the course of the twentieth century.

C. The process of the implementation of these features is not smooth
and there may be set-backs on the way.

> Seen in this light, one can recognize all of the features of peace
> delineated in the authoritative Bahá’í texts achieved up to the
> third stage in the process of implementation during the course of
> the twentieth century. Some even reached stage 4. Thus it can be
> said that if the Lesser Peace and the Most Great Peace are seen as
> processes rather than apocalyptic events, then the prerequisites and
> accompanying features of these two categories of peace developed
> greatly and were securely established by the end of the twentieth
> century. It is therefore for this reason that the Universal House
> of Justice was able at the close of the twentieth century to confirm
`Abdu’l-Bahá’s description of this century as the “Century of Light”.
