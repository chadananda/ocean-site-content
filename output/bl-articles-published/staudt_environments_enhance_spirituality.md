             Creating Environments that Enhance

Spirituality by Dawn Staudt
Abstract
This paper sets out to explain that all of the teachings, laws and
ordinances of the Bahá’í Faith are there to advance both the individual
and society spiritually. Its purpose is to highlight three areas that
particularly lend themselves to creating the environment for individual
spiritual development: the use of personal prayer, the use of the arts (with
a description of Tranquillity Zones) and the use of encouragement
(focusing on the Virtues Project).

Introduction
Since it is obvious that spiritual development of the individual is
what the Bahá’í Faith is fundamentally about, it seems fair to say
that it could likely be that the conditions that encourage one
person to develop along the path of spirituality could well apply
to others. In fact, the Writings confirm this view. It is this outlook
that has inspired this author to attempt to share and support the
view that certain factors can indeed lend to this all-important goal
of individual spiritual development.

The most fundamental principle of this spiritualization
process is to obey the basic tenants of the Faith. Obviously, the
more one is able to be firm in the Covenant – that is, obey all the
laws and ordinances of Bahá’u’lláh – the more one will progress. It
is not within the scope of this brief work to go into details of this
vast ocean of requirements and possibilities. The assumption is
made that the reader is well aware of the many basic concepts
involved, namely: twice daily reading of the Word of God, daily
reciting of one of the three Obligatory Prayers, observing the
ordinances of the Bahá’í calendar, i.e. the Fast, Feasts and Holy
Days. Obedience to all Bahá’í laws and to the Bahá’í institutions,
as well as observation of the teachings on consultation, are but a
few of the many other specific ways that one can internalise the
teachings of the Faith and become a more spiritual person – that is,
draw closer to God.

There are three specific areas this paper will address
regarding ways to create or to enhance an environment for
spiritual development. These will include: the use of personal
prayer, the use of the arts, and the use of encouragement.

The Use of Personal Prayer
The Writings of 'Abdu’l-Bahá tell us many things about prayer:

> There is nothing sweeter in the world of existence than
> prayer. Man must live in a state of prayer. The most blessed
> condition is the condition of prayer and supplication. Prayer
> is conversation with God … It creates spirituality, creates
> mindfulness and celestial feelings, begets new attractions of
> the Kingdom and engenders the susceptibilities of the higher
> intelligence.1

This one quote alone says so many profoundly spiritual things:
‘nothing sweeter in the world of existence.’ It was this quote that
recently made this author wish to try harder to feel that connection
with God when praying when, in fact, ‘conversing with’ Him.
Surely, if this is considered ‘the most blessed condition’ and if we
are specifically told ‘it creates spirituality,’ this must be something
that we can strive to do for ourselves more and more seriously,
more and more steadfastly. Bahá’u’lláh tells us this exactly and
very clearly when He says:

> At the dawn of every day he should commune with God,
> and, with all his soul, persevere in the quest of his Beloved
> (author’s emphasis).2

This shows that daily prayers – whether the Obligatory Prayer or
other personal prayers – should not consist of ‘casual’
conversation with God. ‘Communing’ with God and ‘the quest’ of
our Beloved do not imply a simple ‘chat’ with God, merely reciting
the words of prayers, merely running through our list of requests
and our few words of thanks. ‘Communing’ implies, rather, a deep
connection of our heart and soul to our Lord. It implies a real desire
to make that connection. Bahá’u’lláh refers to this longing with a
promise of reward: ‘whenever thou shalt long for Me, thou shalt
find Me close to thee.’3 Is this not the object of our lives – to be
close to God? It seems so simple, but too often we don’t seem to
find it so.

As this quotation shows, communing is a condition of our
heart, a yearning, a true longing. It is simply, yet so profoundly,

the love in our hearts for our Creator and for Bahá’u’lláh, His
Manifestation for this age. Of course, God knows what’s in our
hearts, so it doesn’t necessarily have to be put into words. We do,
however, have to create the feeling or awareness of that longing. It
would seem that the phrases above, ‘communing with God’ and
‘with all his soul,’ do not imply a mere intellectual knowing that
we love God and trusting that He knows that we know. Love is,
again, a matter of the heart and soul.

The Báb tells us that it is indeed the condition of our hearts
that matters most when we pray. He writes: ‘The most acceptable
prayer is the one offered with the utmost spirituality and radiance
… The more detached and the purer the prayer, the more
acceptable is it in the presence of God.’ The word ‘radiance’ seems
to imply joy and brilliancy. If this radiance is truly with us when
we pray, surely we will feel the result of this communing, this
conversation with God. It is as we are told in the Hidden Word:
‘Love Me that I may love thee. If thou lovest Me not, My love can
in no wise reach thee. Know this, O servant!’4 We know God
created us because He loves us, but this aphorism tells us that if
we don’t love Him, His love cannot reach us. Prayer, then, is one of
the ways we show our love for God.

It seems that when we are aware of this radiance and this
love when we pray, it is then that ‘It creates spirituality, creates
mindfulness and celestial feelings, begets new attractions of the
Kingdom,’ as stated above. It seems that these qualities of
spirituality, mindfulness and new attractions is what will go out
with us from our prayers for the rest of the day. Is this not what
makes us ‘spiritually attractive’ to others, what will make us the
‘magnets’ of the hearts of men? Is this not what it means in that
same first quote above when it is stated by 'Abdu’l-Bahá: ‘Man
must live in a state of prayer?’

Perhaps these are not new insights to the reader on prayer.

One can say that one is already well aware of these quotations and
the fine implications they make. So why is it so difficult to
cultivate this attitude of prayer on a regular basis? Shoghi Effendi
tells us:

> It is often difficult for us to do things because they are so
> very different from what we are used to, not because the
> thing itself is particularly difficult … Bahá’u’lláh would not

give us these things if they would not greatly benefit us …
> we must accept to obey these ordinances even though at first
> we may not see any need for them. As we obey them we will
> gradually come to see in ourselves the benefits they confer.5

This is precisely what this author is proposing: that we do
not, in fact, follow the advice given closely enough. The Guardian
refers to it as ‘obedience’ and that really goes back to the
introductory comments relating to firmness in the Covenant, which
is a far greater topic than this paper will endeavour to cover.
Instead, I will examine this is in another light with details of
practical assistance that can aid us toward this with this gradual
obedience.

There are several examples of details which we might try to
improve. One is the timing of our personal prayers. In addition to
the specific time required for the Obligatory Prayers, we are
specifically enjoined to pray ‘at the dawn of every day’, as
indicated in the quotation above, while in another quote we are
told ‘at times, such as midnight, when freed from daily cares.’6

‘When freed from daily cares …’ This denotes that by
following this advice of either of these two certain times of the
day, our minds will be less occupied with other thoughts and
concerns. It makes sense that this will thus make it easier for us to
concentrate and give our full attention to this communing with our
Lord. This last quotation, as well as the one following, refers to
another important point in creating this environment for spiritual
development through prayer, namely, offering our prayers in
private:

> The reason why privacy hath been enjoined in moments of
> devotion is this, that thou mayest give thy best attention to
> the remembrance of God, that thy heart may at all times be
> animated with His spirit, and not be shut out as by a veil
> from thy Best Beloved.7

This, of course, does not mean praying with one’s children playing
in the same room or with one’s spouse reading a book there. How
can we possibly get into this special frame of mind described
above as ‘communing’ with God and this longing in our heart with
someone else present who is not in the least in that same

condition? (Of course, praying in a larger gathering of Bahá’ís is a
different matter.)

Cleanliness is another condition we are told in the Writings
that affects our spirituality and should be considered when
approaching prayer:

Wings that are besmirched with mire can never soar.8

When man in all conditions is pure and immaculate, he
> will become the centre of the reflection of the manifest light
> … The channel must be cleansed before it is filled with sweet
> water … External cleanliness, although it is but a physical
> thing, has a great influence upon spirituality.9

The point is this: the Divine Physician not only tells us what
the remedy is, He also tells us how to apply that remedy. The
details of the ‘how to’ pray are actually what create the proper
‘environment’ for prayer. The more closely we can try to apply the
various details given to us regarding prayer, the more likely we
will feel these sacred effects in our hearts and the more they will
effect our behaviour in spiritual ways.

What is it that gets in the way of putting into practice these
small details that can make such a difference? Obviously, each
person needs to consider this for themselves. Is it lack of
detachment from the material world, namely, our precious sleep?
We may see ourselves as being either a ‘morning lark’ or a ‘night
owl’, so one specific time of the day or night must be appropriate
to seek this ‘quest of our Beloved’ when ‘freed from daily cares.’
Are we not organized enough to properly wash and dress
ourselves before we set out to recite our prayers? Perhaps our
homes are small, but, again, with thought and consultation with
those with whom we live, privacy is likely to be attainable.

Two other details of how to administer the remedy and how
to create this special environment relates to what is learned in
Study Circles, namely, that to ‘intone’ means ‘to say out loud.’ We
have also learned that ‘recite’ means ‘to say from memory.’
Perhaps learning the prayers we use most often by heart can also
contribute to creating this atmosphere of yearning to be close to
God, simply because we can close our eyes, block out distractions
in the room around us and not have to fumble with a prayer book.
The Báb tells us: ‘every breast which committeth His Words to

memory, God shall cause, if it were that of a believer, to be filled
with His love …’10 Is this not what we are seeking in our prayers –
‘to be filled with God’s love?’

We are told that when we make a sacrifice, we receive a gift.

The sacrifice involved in any of these issues will be well rewarded
with this increased connection of our hearts to our Beloved in
those precious moments of prayer. We must remind ourselves that
the prolongation of prayer is not what God requires from us;
however, the more one experiences the true condition of prayer, as
described in the Writings, the longer, in fact, one wishes to remain
in it! The bounties it bestows are priceless. The effects in our daily
lives are tangible.

The power of Divine Assistance gained through prayer can
never be underestimated. The Writings contain many references to
the benefits of prayer – strengthening in divine virtue, healing,
awakening, mindfulness, protection, preservation from tests, to
name but a few. It seems that most often we miss numerous
opportunities because we have not relied on this power of prayer.
We may and must consciously strive more faithfully to attain this
‘best of conditions’, which in fact is within our own power to
achieve. This author proposes that it is the daily acquiring of the
details of how to pray that will help us create the special
environment that will enhance our own spirituality. Perhaps we
can begin by asking God’s assistance in this matter of enhancing
the quality of our prayers.

In the Five Year Plan (2001-2006), where we are to be
systematic in all that we do, perhaps we can choose but one of
these little details of how we should pray to start us on our way to
creating this condition of spiritual development. One can work
toward that one little detail first, whether it be:

> -   the special time of day,
> -   the spotless cleanliness,
> -   the intonation of our prayers,
> -   memorizing prayers or
> -   seeking privacy while praying.

If we can master first just one of these details, we are likely to feel
some effect, some improvement. Once one is mastered, we can add
in another one; and so, as the Master tells us, ‘little by little, day by

day,’ we will see this very special area of our lives improve and
move forward in preciously spiritual ways and thus affecting our
lives in ways we never thought possible before.

The Use of the Arts
There have been one kind of events over the last couple of years
that have highlighted to this author that the use of the arts can
contribute to creating tremendous spirituality. (We know, of
course, as well, that this point has been made in recent plans from
the Universal House of Justice, notably in the Ridván letter of
1996\.) This event includes what have come to be called
‘Tranquillity Zones,’ which will now be described and discussed.

Most Irish Bahá’ís are probably familiar now with the
Tranquillity Zones. These were developed over several years by
the Bahá’ís in Swindon, England. The original premise was to offer
an opportunity to raise spiritual awareness among the people of
Swindon. This was done by setting up a truly beautiful
environment to which the public was invited. Special music,
flowers, candles, and fragrance were combined with verses from
the Writings to create this atmosphere of heightened awareness of
the spiritual within us all.

Among the Bahá’ís thus involved in Swindon there was a
question for quite some time as to whether the Tranquillity Zones
were a teaching project or a service project. In the end the Bahá’ís
seemed to feel that it is one and the same. The following quotation
from their 40-page report entitled ‘From Events to Environments’
shares the insights they gained on this special approach to
teaching:

> Therefore in teaching, two processes can be seen at work. The
> first is the process of spiritual growth, which every human
> being is capable of developing in their heart; much like the
> seed of a tree that has the capacity and potential to grow.
> This is between the individual and Bahá’u’lláh. The second
> process is creating the environments in which this spiritual
> capacity has the opportunity to grow and this is something
> that we as Bahá’ís can help to create. The term ‘teaching’ then
> refers to a process that creates environments of spiritual
> growth.

Notice that this last phrase is the same as the title of this paper.

This is what it is all about: creating the environment for spiritual
growth. When each of the senses are awakened – when the eyes
behold the beauty of the flowers, when the nose inhales the
sweetness of the scent, when the ear is touched by the sound
brought forth by the musician – then is the heart and soul enabled
to feel the spirit of the Word of God.

This verse from the Writings tells us that first there must be
purity. Perhaps the beautiful environment of the Tranquillity Zone
contributes to creating the pure heart at that particular moment:

> in all his actions and conduct there must first be purity, then
> beauty…The pure eye comprehendeth the sight and the
> meaning of God; the pure nostril inhaleth the perfumes of
> the rose-garden of bounty; the pure heart becometh the
> mirror of the beauty of truth …11

Of course, Bahá’ís know that the Word of God has the power
to touch the hearts and souls of the whole human race:

> The Word of God is the king of words and its pervasive
> influence is incalculable … The Great Being saith: The Word
> is the master key for the whole world, inasmuch as through
> its potency the doors of the hearts of men, which in reality
> are the doors of heaven, are unlocked … It is an ocean
> inexhaustible in riches, comprehending all things.12

In a Tranquillity Zone, the beautiful surroundings simply enhance
the opportunity for the hearts to be touched by the Word of God –
both our own hearts and those of our friends. When our own hearts
are moved at a Tranquillity Zone, as well as the heart of our friend
attending, a special bond of unity is created that is endowed with
spirit.

When inviting a friend to a Tranquillity Zone, one can
describe it as a ‘kind of meditation.’ Often a particular theme or
topic is chosen for each occasion (e.g. happiness), so it would be a
meditation on that theme. However, it is important to make it
clear that there is no one kind of meditation in the Bahá’í Faith, no
set format to be rigidly followed. To Bahá’ís, drawn from diverse
backgrounds, meditation is simply an opportunity to contemplate

the Writings. One might want to explain the simplicity of the
occasion as follows: a lovely environment will be created with
candles, flowers, scents and music and one person will slowly read
some verses for your contemplation. This is all a Tranquillity Zone
is and people coming may like to have a clear understanding of
this at the outset. This can be especially important as other
traditions invoke various images of what meditation will involve
and may not necessarily be the sort of event to which they are
attracted!

Tranquillity Zones are a very effective way to open the
hearts of our seeking friends. (In fact, as the Swindon project
developed over those months and years, their community doubled
in size.) Thus, it can be seen that we can become more ‘natural’
teachers, more naturally able to share this precious Faith of ours
with others in such a specially created environment that enhances
spirituality. It is the beauty of the environment created from the
beauty of the gifts God has given to us – including the Word of
God – offered in an attitude of service that has this effect on the
hearts of those attending. (Of course, the beauty and serenity of
the souls offering the Tranquillity Zone is another important
condition that they will have presumably prepared with their
prayers prior to the event.)

The arts and the beautiful environment combined with the
sincere love and fellowship of the friends serve to create this
atmosphere of spirituality. It is, or can be, a glimpse of heaven on
earth. The stranger has become a friend. The friend has become like
a lover. This closeness of hearts has been brought about by this
spiritually created atmosphere. The hearts of all those in
attendance were truly uplifted, as the Writings well attest to this
possibility: ‘We, verily, have made music as a ladder for your soul,
a means whereby they may be lifted up unto the realm on high
…’13 Another verses tells us:

> Whatever is in the heart of man, melody moves and
> awakens. If a heart full of good feelings and a pure voice are
> joined together, a great effect is produced. For instance: if
> there be love in the heart, through melody, it will increase
> until its intensity can scarcely be borne … The meaning is
> that melody causes whatever feeling is in the heart to
> increase …14

Regarding all art, including music and poetry, 'Abdu’l-Bahá tells
us:

> All art is a gift of the Holy Spirit. When this light shines
> through the mind of a musician, it manifests itself in
> beautiful harmonies. Again, shining through the mind of a
> poet, it is seen in fine poetry and poetic prose … These gifts
> are fulfilling their highest purpose, when showing forth the
> praise of God.15

The Writings support this idea and clearly encourage the use of
these arts for the gatherings of the friends and tell us of the great
benefits to be received, both in this quotation, as well as from
several others from the same source, though not all cited here:

> Continue as long as thou canst this melody in the gatherings
> of the beloved; thus may the minds find rest and joy and
> become in tune with the love of God. When eloquence of
> expression, beauty of sense and sweetness of composition
> unite with new melodies the effect is ever great, especially if
> it be the anthem of the verses of oneness and the songs of
> praise to the Lord of Glory.16

As long ago as 1933, Shoghi Effendi stated:

> The day will come when the Cause will spread like wildfire
> when its spirit and teachings will be presented on the stage
> or in art and literature as a whole. Art can better awaken
> such noble sentiments than cold rationalising, especially
> among the mass of the people.17

Those who have seen or been part of the Diversity Dance
Theatre groups that have toured around Ireland over the last
couple of years can recall how these dancers have touched many
hearts. Over several years, there has also seen an increased
emphasis on the use of the arts from the institutions of the Faith.
This has been seen from the Training Institute programmes prior
to the use of the Ruhi materials, as well as now in the Ruhi

materials with the ‘gift of oneself’ used during Study Circles, from
the National Spiritual Assembly at its recent Institutional
Meetings, and from speakers at Summer Schools. We are slowly
but surely getting the idea that the use of the arts is a very
powerful way to create environments for spiritual growth.

The Use of Encouragement
The third area that is conducive to creating spiritual growth is that
of the use of encouragement. One might think this a rather
simplistic approach, but attempts will be made to show how truly
powerful this can be. The author recently did an hour-and-a-half
session at the annual conference for a national organisation (not
Bahá’í) on this topic, and was rather overwhelmed with the
positive response received afterwards. This prompted the
inclusion of this topic in this paper.

If one first looks at the definition of the word ‘encourage,’
one will find in The Oxford Dictionary: ‘to give support,
confidence, or hope to; to help or stimulate the development of.’
There it is – ‘stimulate the development of’ something. In this case,
I will look at spiritual development. From the definition, we can
see that by offering encouragement we are simply offering support
and hope to others. Is this not what all of us need in our everyday
lives? Certainly we need it in all that we undertake that is good,
but if we could receive encouragement in all that pertains to
spiritual development, then all the rest would much more easily
fall into place.

At the conference just mentioned, this author coined the
phrase of an ‘encourager’ as being someone who is ‘a bringer of
light’ to others. We all know how wonderful we feel when
someone – stranger or loved one – tells how well we did at
something. It is as if a magic wand touched us and our heart feels
warm and happy. It is sweet to know that someone thought it
went well, that someone noticed the effort made (even though we
are to offer our deeds as service to God), that someone else
benefited in some way from what we have tried to do. In all
humility, we may well know that it was accomplished only by the
aid of the Almighty. But still it can even be the comment made that
makes us more fully aware of this. It is then that this realization
fills us with a special glow that warms heart and soul. So, such

simple words as ‘well done’ can help us to develop radiance of
spirit, a deeper dedication to try to be of service and also humility.

We should not underestimate the worth of such simple
words of encouragement. The Writings offer definite support for
this:

> Thus it is incumbent upon us, when we direct our gaze
> toward other people, to see where they excel, not where they
fail.18

Never speak disparagingly of others, but praise
without distinction. 19

See nothing but good in one another, hear nothing but
> praise of one another, and speak no word of one another
> save only to praise.20

The Writings go on to tell us that it is not enough only to speak
encouragingly of others, but, as both the quotes above and below
show, we should also see only what is good in others:

> Thus it is incumbent upon us, when we direct our gaze
> toward other people, to see where they excel, not where they
fail.21

One must see in every human being only that which is
worthy of praise.22

This is indeed a tall order, but we remember that 'Abdu’l-Bahá has
told us that even our thoughts have power. For example, we are
told that we must replace a thought of war with a stronger
thought of peace, a thought of hatred with a more powerful
thought of love.23 So, even our thinking should be of a positive,
encouraging nature.

These few quotations give us insights into how we can go
about encouraging others, as well as ourselves, to bring about this
development of spirituality. This way of speaking and thinking
that keeps us looking to the positive/spiritual side of life and not
letting the negative/unspiritual side dominate are again habits
that we can consciously strive to acquire. Let us now turn our
attention to the point of encouraging children.

The dictionary definition said that to encourage also was
about giving confidence. We all would be aware of the extreme
importance of giving confidence to children. This is what develops
their self-esteem, i.e. how they feel about themselves. Sociology
and psychology studies have long ago shown that a child’s self-
esteem affects them in many ways: how they learn, how they make
friends, how they progress in fulfilling their potential both
academically and socially. It boils down to how happy and content
they will be in life.

These studies also clearly indicate that it is the home
environment that has the biggest influence on the development of
this self-esteem. (Perhaps this is no longer true in modern Western
societies where many or most mothers work full-time out of the
home and children under the age of five spend the vast majority of
their waking hours with people who are not their parents.) We
know as Bahá’ís, however, that the mother is considered the ‘first
educator’ of the child. A great deal of responsibility is clearly
placed on her in this capacity:

> The mother is the first teacher of the child. For children, at
> the beginning of life, are fresh and tender as a young twig,
> and can be trained in any fashion you desire. If you rear the
> child to be straight, he will grow straight, in perfect
> symmetry. It is clear that the mother is the first teacher and
> that it is she who establisheth the character and conduct of
> the child.24

Of course, fathers have a very responsible role to play as well:

> Ye should consider the question of goodly character as of the
> first importance. It is incumbent upon every father and
> mother to counsel their children over a long period, and
> guide them unto those things which lead to everlasting
> honour.25

We know clearly, as well, that ‘those things which lead to
everlasting honour’ refer to all that pertains to the spiritual
development of the child. Again, 'Abdu’l-Bahá delineates this as
follows:

It is the bounden duty of parents to rear their children to be
> staunch in faith … For every praiseworthy deed is born out
of the light of religion. 26

From the very beginning, the children must receive
> divine education and must continually be reminded to
> remember their God. Let the love of God pervade their
> inmost being.27

Encouraging the child in the development of praiseworthy
character and habits is, therefore, of the utmost importance in
family life. This is not an easy task, when we, sadly, live in a world
that tends to dwell on ‘the unpleasant things of life’. News
broadcasts, newspaper headlines, soap operas, gossip columns
and magazines, backbiting: so many negatives surround us that it
is not always easy to take the positive, encouraging approach.
'Abdu’l-Bahá tells us:

> Know that this matter of instruction, of character
> rectification and refinement, of heartening and encouraging the
> child, is of the utmost importance, for such are basic
> principles of God (author’s emphasis).28

Certainly, all the above quotations regarding seeing the good
in others and not speaking disparagingly of them are applicable to
our child-rearing practices. At the same time these must be
tempered with the important realization that the child does, in
fact, need to be corrected when misbehaving. It is not enough to
see only the good and ignore the bad. Perhaps we can distract a
child to create a more positive situation at times, but certainly at
other times the child must be lovingly, patiently, but definitely
corrected and made to understand clearly that his or her negative
deeds are not to be repeated. The parent must obviously see where
the child ‘fails’ in order to correct him or her and guide them on
the path of proper spiritual development. The Writings tell us:

> Whensoever a mother seeth that her child hath done well, let
> her praise and applaud him and cheer his heart; and if the
> slightest undesirable trait should manifest itself, let her
> counsel the child and punish him. 29

Perhaps the following quotation will help parents keep this
discipline, this training issue in better perspective: ‘Love the
creatures for the sake of God and not for themselves. You will
never become angry or impatient if you love them for the sake of
God.’30

Again, this is a tall order when one is spending an entire day
with a two-year old. Much more could be said of these matters,
but space does not permit. The author refers readers to the book
Bahá’í Education: A Compilation as an excellent and detailed source
from the Writings on many various aspects of the parenting and
training of children.

To conclude this section, I would like to offer an example of
how to encourage children and fellow adults in very positive ways
that highlight the spiritual development of each and every
individual. This concept comes from the Virtues Project. The
concept, as well as many others from this Project, can create an
atmosphere of spiritual development both within our homes and
broader community environments, both within and outside the
Bahá’í community.

The Virtues Project, developed by three Bahá’ís in the United
States in the early 1980s, uses this quotation from Bahá’u’lláh as a
premise: ‘Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable
value.’31 The virtues latent within us all are considered those
‘gems.’ The virtues are universally valued by all cultures as the
content of our character. They run ‘like a silver thread’ through the
Scriptures of the world’s great religions. Bahá’ís know that part of
our purpose in this life is to develop ‘divine attributes’, which, of
course, are these virtues. Bahá’u’lláh says:

> The purpose of the one true God in manifesting Himself is to
> summon all mankind to truthfulness and sincerity, to piety
> and trustworthiness, to resignation and submissiveness to
> the Will of God, to forbearance and kindliness, to
> uprightness and wisdom. His object is to array every man
> with the mantle of a saintly character, and to adorn him with
> the ornament of holy and goodly deeds.32

The Virtues Project proposes that we can learn the ‘language
of the virtues.’ The idea of a ‘virtues acknowledgement’ is used to

thank or honour a person – child or adult – for the virtue that they
have just demonstrated in their behaviour. For example:

- ‘I would like to thank you, Johnny, for your kindness and co-

operation in helping Sally pick up.’
- ‘I would like to honour you for the courage it took to tell me

the truth.’
- ‘I thank you for your perseverance in making sure that all

> community members were aware of the Local Assembly’s
> plans for the Holy Day.’
- ‘I would like to honour your trustworthiness and thank you

for having kept this matter confidential.’

In all of these statements, the positive is being acknowledged.
Praise, support, confidence, in a word, encouragement is being
given for a specific spiritual behaviour. By specifically naming that
behaviour with the virtue, the development of that virtue is
reinforced, particularly in a child. Sometimes we simply classify all
such behaviours as ‘good’, rather than being specific. So, we then
fall into the trap of saying to a child, ‘What a good boy!’ The child
may not be sure exactly what he did that was so good. Meanwhile,
if this is used frequently, he has now become ‘labelled’ as being a
‘good’ boy. This exerts pressure on the child and can create a lot of
guilt when he does fall off the wagon of being a ‘good’ boy. Use of
specific labels for the behaviour – as distinct for the person – can
help healthy growth occur.

These same techniques offer encouraging interactions with
adults. More importantly, for adults as well as for children, the
specific positive spiritual qualities are encouraged and reinforced.
As mentioned above, this is part of our purpose in life – part of
what we should always be striving to work toward. It can be seen
how such a simple concept of learning to ‘speak the language of
the virtues’ helps to create an environment that enhances spiritual
development.

Specifically in relation to child-rearing, this ‘language of the
virtues’ can be used to encourage positive behaviour when it is
lacking and thereby avoid the more commonly used negative
expressions of anger and impatience. Consider these examples:

- ‘Johnny, you need to be more considerate and kind to your

sister. Stop doing that, please, now.’
- ‘I think you need to develop more courage and

> trustworthiness so you can learn to tell the truth the first
> time you are asked a question. You know how important
> truthfulness is.’
- ‘You need to be more generous and learn to share your

sweets with your friends.’
- ‘You need to be more courteous and not interrupt me when

I’m on the phone, please.’

These sound perhaps rather strange because they are so
different than what would normally be said in our current culture
of negativism. Try to imagine the positive outcomes that could
develop with this kind of straightforward approach if applied
across the board at home and in schools. A greater awareness of
the virtues would result, which couldn’t help but increase a greater
recognition of the need to develop spiritually.

It is important to point out that using this ‘correction’ or
‘instruction’ approach of the Virtues Project is not appropriate for
adult-to-adult interactions, as the Writings make it very clear that
we should not see the faults of others, as indicated above. Thus it
is not appropriate for any adult to tell another that he or she needs
to develop trustworthiness. We should use a sin-covering eye at all
times in other adults’ behaviour and, instead, concentrate fully on
developing our own spiritual qualities. Using the language of the
virtues with children in either a home or school setting would have
a positive effect on the spiritual attitude of adults present,
however, as mention of the virtues would remind the adults
themselves that they, too, should possess those attributes.

It is also perhaps worth considering that possibly in
marriage relationships, use of this instruction/correction technique
might be possible, since couples are to be as spiritual ‘helpmates’
to each other ‘who should be concerned about the welfare of each
other’33 and ‘loving companions … that they may ever improve the
spiritual life of each other.’34 This would not be on an ongoing
daily basis, presumably, but at times of consultation. Of course,
consultation is the specific tool for Bahá’ís with which to
communicate fully and directly about problems and difficulties
and should be used in marriage. Always the guidelines of using

‘moderation’ and ‘purity of motive’ in consultation should be
employed. Perhaps use of the virtues correction could be part of
consultation in a marriage.

To assist the reader to realize the credibility of this
innovative and spiritual approach, it should be mentioned that the
Virtues Project was honoured as a model programme for families
at the World Conference of Cities, Local Governments and Private
Sector Partners on Families in association with the United Nations
Secretariat during the International Year of the Child. It has been
used on many Native Reservations in the States, in many prisons,
by many different denominations of the Christian Church, as well
as by the personnel departments of many large US businesses to
promote healthier, more wholesome – in fact, more spiritual –
environments for all concerned.

Conclusion
Spiritual development is fundamentally all about bringing out the
best in each and every one of us. Whether it is through the most
personal spiritual exercise of all, namely prayer, where we truly
feel connected with our Creator; or whether it is the spiritual
enlightenment that a beautiful environment coupled with the
Word of God can bring us; or that breath of the Holy Spirit that
has inspired the artist’s work that in turn touches our own soul; or
the gentle, kind words that cheer and encourage another person’s
heart on their way in life – whatever it is that assists in drawing
each of us closer to pursuing our own spiritual destiny, that is
something that we need to actively seek to create and sustain in
our own environments.

‘All that which ye potentially possess can, however, be
manifested only as a result of your own volition.’35 This is exactly
what distinguishes us from all of the other mammals that make up
the animal world: we have been endowed with the will to
determine our own actions, i.e. the ability to choose either to live
as the other beasts with our animal nature ruling our lives or to
chose to live as the spiritual beings God created us to be. It does
require a decision, a choice, a will to act as we are more naturally
inclined toward our lower nature. By not consciously deciding to
act, we abnegate our free will and miss the precious opportunities
to change, go forward and improve our lives in spiritual ways.
Such choices and use of our volition are, in fact, a daily process, as

some of the various ideas presented in this paper have sought to
illustrate.

Spirituality is a deeply personal affair that is enacted
between each individual’s heart and his or her Creator on a daily
basis. Yet the spirituality of the individual has great influence on
all aspects of that person’s own life – in both this world and in the
world to come. The spirituality of each individual influences, in
turn, all the other people with whom he or she will come into
contact every day. Indeed, ‘human happiness is founded on
spiritual behaviour.’36 It is hoped that some small part of this
paper may assist in that process in each reader’s life as we all
strive to create environments that will enhance spirituality.
