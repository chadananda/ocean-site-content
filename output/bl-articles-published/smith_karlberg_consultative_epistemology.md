Articulating a Consultative
Epistemology: Toward a
Reconciliation of Truth and
Relativism

TODD SMITH AND MICHAEL KARLBERG

Abstract
The field of epistemology has been characterized by a perennial tension between
two broadly contrasting approaches to knowledge—one associated with the
search for foundational truth, the other associated with assertions regarding the
relativity of truth. This paper resolves this tension within the framework of a con-
sultative epistemology. This epistemological framework demonstrates and explores
the relativity of the social construction of truth, and in so doing, resolves the par-
adoxical truth claim, associated with relativist approaches to knowledge, that
there are no universally valid truths. The ultimate purpose of the paper is to artic-
ulate an epistemology that supports the development of more integrative
approaches to knowledge.

Résumé
Le domaine de l’épistémologie a été marqué par une tension continuelle entre
deux approches de la connaissance plutôt divergentes : l’une associée à la
recherche de la vérité fondamentale, l’autre affirmant que la vérité est relative. Le
présent exposé vise à concilier ces approches dans le cadre d’une épistémologie
consultative. L’auteur propose un cadre épistémologique qui démontre et exam-
ine la relativité de la construction sociale de la vérité; ce faisant il réconcilie cette
notion avec l’affirmation paradoxale associée aux approches relativistes de la con-
naissance voulant qu’il n’existe pas de vérité universellement valide. L’auteur vise
au bout du compte à proposer une épistémologie pouvant mener à l’élaboration
d’approches davantage intégrées à l’égard de la connaissance.

Resumen
El campo de la epistemología se ha caracterizado por una tensión perpetua entre
dos enfoques al conocimiento generalmente contrastantes: uno asociado con la
búsqueda de la verdad fundamental, y el otro asociado con afirmaciones sobre la
relatividad de la verdad. Este artículo resuelve esta tensión en el marco de una
epistemología consultiva. Este marco epistemológico demuestra y explora la
relatividad de la construcción social de la verdad y al hacerlo, resuelve la preten-
sión de verdad paradójica asociada a los enfoques relativistas al conocimiento,
que no hay verdades universalmente válidos. El propósito final del trabajo es
articular una epistemología que apoya el desarrollo de enfoques al conocimiento
más integrados.

Epistemology is a field of philosophy that is concerned with the nature
and generation of knowledge. It is concerned, in other words, with what
we can know as well as the methods by which we can know it. The field of
epistemology has been characterized by a deep and long-standing tension
alluded to in the title of this paper by the terms “truth” and “relativism.”
More precisely, this tension exists between two sets of broadly contrast-
ing approaches to knowledge. These approaches can be seen in the
opposed categories of objectivism and subjectivism, foundationalism and
antifoundationalism, absolutism and relativism, realism and antirealism,
essentialism and antiessentialism, modernism and postmodernism, and so
forth.1 In each pair, the former term embodies a variation on the theme
that human knowledge, when pursued through the correct methods, can
have a direct connection with, or correspondence to, reality or truth. The
latter term, on the other hand, embodies a variation on the theme that all
human knowledge is socially constructed within diverse interpretive
frameworks, meaning that it has no direct connection with, or correspon-
dence to, foundational reality or truth.

To date, this tension has never been effectively resolved. However, we
believe that the teachings of the Bahá’í Faith, and principles of Bahá’í con-
sultation in particular, contain insights that offer a resolution to this epis-
temological conflict. Epistemology, however, has received little attention
so far within Bahá’í scholarship. Most of what has been written—such as
works by Mahmoudi, McLean, Saeidi, and Hatcher—has focused either on

Articulating a Consultative Epistemology                   61

the epistemology of mystical knowledge or on the relationship between
faith and reason, rather than on the issue of relativism itself.2

Four works of Bahá’í scholarship that touch directly on epistemological
relativism are Momen’s “Relativism: A Basis for Bahá’í Metaphysics”;
Kluge’s “Bahá’í Ontology: An Initial Reconnaissance”3 and “Relativism
and the Bahá’í Writings”; and Lample’s Revelation and Social Reality.
Momen asserts that Bahá’í epistemology embodies “a cognitive or epis-
temic relativism” in which comprehension is ultimately limited by cogni-
tive viewpoints or perspectives (207). According to Momen, this means
that “we are unable to make any absolute statements about Reality or the
structure of being (that is, ontology) because any knowledge or under-
standing that we have of these is relative” (207). Kluge’s first article offers
slightly more nuanced conclusions than Momen’s. Kluge asserts that
Bahá’í epistemology is characterized by a qualified relativism in which
some truth claims are more epistemologically privileged than others; in
which some truth claims are historically contingent while others are not;
and in which truth claims pertaining to foundational realities must be dis-
tinguished from truth claims pertaining to socially constructed realities.
In Kluge’s second article, he abandons the term relativism altogether
because the term is associated with a rejection of three positions that he
demonstrates are supported, in some respects, by the Bahá’í writings.
These positions are universalism, objectivism, and foundationalism. Kluge
then argues that the phrase evolutionary Platonic perspectivism is a more
accurate way of describing Bahá’í epistemology. Epistemological state-
ments in the Bahá’í writings, according to Kluge,

> are ”evolutionary” because they see our knowledge of truth advancing
> in scope, accuracy and effectiveness . . . Platonic because they believe
> in the existence of universal truths, or ‘eternal verities’ that do not
> change . . . ‘perspectivist’ because humankind’s view of the eternal
> truths may be different according to standpoint and/or evolve through
> time, though this does not imply that any and all views are necessari-
> ly correct. Thus the Bahá’í Writings occupy a middle ground between
> relativism on the one hand and a static absolutism on the other. (44)
62             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

Lample adopts a broadly similar approach to Kluge in that he accepts the
existence of underlying truths; he acknowledges the limitations of human
knowledge, as well as its perspectivist nature, in relation to underlying
truths; and he recognizes the potential evolution or refinement of human
knowledge, over time. Lample’s focus, however, is primarily on the applied
question of how we can translate the transcendent truths that are embedded
in religious revelation into practical knowledge, and into corresponding
social practices, that contribute to an ever-advancing civilization. In this con-
text, and building on the insights of Richard Bernstein in Beyond Objectivism
and Relativism, he rejects epistemologies that are characterized by extreme
objectivism and extreme relativism, or foundationalism and antifoundation-
alism. Instead he articulates a “nonfoundational” epistemology that can
coexist with a foundational ontology by recognizing, on one hand, that
human knowledge of reality is constructed and, on the other hand, that
human comprehension can, over time, through the dynamics of consultation,
action, and reflection, lead to increased attunement with the truths of
Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation and the nature of reality, as gauged by measures
such as the betterment of the world and the prosperity of its peoples.

We agree, in broad terms, with the conclusions of Kluge and Lample
above. Our goal, however, is to articulate a set of concepts, and some ini-
tial vocabulary for discussing these, that enable us to probe more deeply
into the specific ways in which a Bahá’í-inspired epistemology transcends
objectivism and relativism, or foundationalism and antifoundationalism.
We believe that these efforts may be especially useful to students, scholars,
and others who are drawn into prevailing discourses on epistemology,
where they encounter polarizing and often highly antagonistic arguments
from the seemingly irreconcilable camps of modernist and postmodernist
philosophers and social theorists. In this regard, thoughtful individuals
can benefit from any insights that help them transcend the false
dichotomies that inform both camps.

Toward these ends, in the discussion that follows, we articulate aspects
of what we call a consultative epistemology. Our specific objectives are three-
fold. The first is to further advance inquiry and insight into Bahá’í-inspired
epistemology. The second is to use insights from such an epistemology to

Articulating a Consultative Epistemology                     63

explain and demonstrate how the long-standing tension between founda-
tional and relativist approaches to truth can be resolved. The resolution,
we argue, involves a justification of the idea that some truth claims are
more socially constructed, and thus less attuned to a foundational reality,
than other truth claims—a claim advanced by Turner (105), alluded to by
Kluge, and more fully conceptualized in this paper. The third objective is
to explore the epistemological implications that follow from demonstrating
and conceptualizing the relativity of the social construction of truth. In
this context, we hope specifically to “contribute to a gradual forging of the
more integrative paradigms of scholarship” that the Universal House of
Justice has called for (Letter).

THE PERENNIAL TENSION

The epistemological tension alluded to above is referred to by Rorty as
an opposition between vertical and horizontal approaches to knowledge.
Vertical approaches are characterized by the assumption that truth has an
independent and absolute existence, that human minds are capable of dis-
covering and representing it, and that some methods for accessing it are
superior to other methods. Horizontal approaches are characterized by
the assumption that truth has no independent existence outside of the
human minds and discourses that socially construct it. For horizontalists,
a representation or belief about reality is true if it is congruent with the
rest of what a community has established as true. As Rorty explains, “The
first tradition thinks of truth as a vertical relationship between represen-
tation and what is represented. The second tradition thinks of truth hor-
izontally. . . . This tradition does not ask how representations are related
to nonrepresentations, but how representations can be seen as hanging
together” (Consequences of Pragmatism 92).

The terms vertical and horizontal denote, of course, ideal types. In practice,
these approaches sometimes blend together in complex, and often contra-
dictory, ways. Yet these ideal types are worth examining closer because
they have heuristic value: they help us understand and explore the peren-
nial tension associated with them.

VERTICAL EPISTEMOLOGIES

The vertical drive to unravel the workings of the universe through sanc-
tioned methods of inquiry and investigation is a powerful force in human
societies that has deep historical roots. Plato epitomized it. “The true lover
of knowledge,” Plato wrote, “naturally strives for truth” and “soars with
undimmed and unwearied passion till he grasps the essential nature of
things” (490a). For Plato, to grasp this world of essences one must rely
upon pure reason because the senses are easily beguiled by the contingent
world of ephemeral shadows that shroud the true nature of things.

The history of Western thought is filled with other verticalists who ele-
vate particular methods of inquiry over others in their search for essential
truths. Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, and Bacon are among them.
Descartes and Husserl also typify this tradition. In his Discourse on the
Method, Descartes applies a method of radical skepticism through which he
discards anything that can be doubted until he can doubt no further. He
thus arrives at the well-known cogito, “I think, therefore I am.” Upon this
foundation he seeks to rebuild the edifice of human knowledge through a
series of clear and logically irrefutable assertions. Husserl also seeks cer-
tainty. He attempts to create a presuppositionless philosophy through phe-
nomenal reduction that aims to pierce through all mental and social con-
structions to achieve “apodicticity”—the level of absolute truth or reality
of objects. His goal, as he states in The Idea of Phenomenology, is to reduce
every contingent phenomenon to “a pure phenomenon, which exhibits its
intrinsic (immanent) essence . . . as an absolute datum” (45).

Though spanning a period of over two millennia, and though commit-
ted to divergent methods, all of these individuals exemplify the vertical
tradition. Given the assumption that truth is “out there,” waiting to be
known, they each aim at establishing a hierarchy of approaches to truth,
dividing methods of inquiry up into those “which represent reality well,
those which represent it less well, and those which do not represent it at
all” (Rorty, Philosophy 3). Plato and Descartes, in their own ways, champi-
oned pure reason while rebuffing reliance on sensory perceptions. Their
rationalism has been challenged, however, by the empiricism of Locke,

Articulating a Consultative Epistemology                  65

Hume, and Ayer, among others, as well as by the falsificationism of Popper.
Both approaches have aimed to lay down criteria that clearly demarcate
science from nonscience, and have thereby promoted the rise of science to
a position of dominance within the verticalist tradition.

The modern approach of science as the ultimate arbiter of truth is what
Sorell calls scientism. Scientism has taken basically two forms. Broadly
speaking, the first follows the empiricist or logical positivist tradition that
repudiates the rationalists’ search for metaphysical truth. Instead, empiri-
cists focus on observable phenomena that can be directly measured or test-
ed. The second form of scientism embraces scientific realism, which expands
the empiricist focus to include phenomena that can only be observed indi-
rectly, such as the human mind. Both traditions insist, however, that truths
exist, that those truths can be known, and that they can best be discovered
through prescribed methods of objective and context-independent scien-
tific inquiry. Thus, like Plato’s rationalism or Husserl’s phenomenal reduc-
tionism, logical positivism and scientific realism are variations on the ver-
ticalist theme.

HORIZONTAL EPISTEMOLOGIES

Horizontal approaches to knowledge reject the vertical tendency to exalt
certain truths, and the methods for arriving at them, over others. Instead,
horizontalists assume either that the truth of things is inaccessible to the
human mind or, more radically, that there is not really any truth out there
to access. In either case, truths are considered mere social constructs
because phenomena have no intrinsic “meaning” or “essence” in the
absence of background assumptions, interpretive frameworks, shared dis-
courses, theoretical perspectives, language games, and so forth. Based on
this premise, horizontalists reject epistemological hierarchies, totalizing
theories, and monopolistic knowledge systems—along with the
Enlightenment project that these have been so closely associated with
(Benson and Stangroom 18).

Lyotard—a seminal figure in horizontal epistemology—provides a
good illustration. For Lyotard, the impulse underlying modernism is the

66            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

quest for truth. To advance this quest, modernism privileges some
approaches, such as empirical science, over others. These approaches are
legitimated, structured, and differentiated from less fruitful approaches by
metanarratives such as the Enlightenment story of human progress and
liberation. But, as far as Lyotard is concerned, we have moved into a post-
modern age now that is characterized by a collapse of metanarratives.
Thus traditional dividing lines between disciplines are evaporating,
knowledge hierarchies are blurring, totalizing theories are crumbling,
and in their place diversified, decentralized, fragmented, and competing
knowledges are emerging.

Foucault—another seminal figure in horizontal epistemology—pro-
pounds the “insurrection of subjugated knowledges” (81) based on broad-
ly similar assumptions about the social construction of reality. He thus
advocates on behalf of marginalized stories and localized knowledges that
have been suppressed by totalizing knowledge systems. According to
(some readings of) Foucault, truth may exist but we can never know it
because we cannot transcend our sociohistorical perspectives to find it.
What we can do, however, is unearth the social origins of specific truth
claims and examine how they function in society. It is toward this end that
Foucault, following Nietzsche, employs his genealogical approach to
demonstrate the historicity of dominant truth claims in order to expose
the power relations embedded in them. This link between power and
knowledge is central to many other horizontalists as well, who point out
that we are not all equal in our ability to socially construct truths. Some
have more say than others because they have greater access to, or control
over, the means of cultural production and reproduction, such as the class-
room, the lab, the media, the legislature, the courtroom, and the pulpit.

Other versions of horizontalism also exist, but cataloging all of them
is beyond the scope of this discussion. It is important to note, however,
that some versions are more radical than others. For example, while
social constructionism (or social constructivism) typically limits its concerns
to epistemology—or what we can know—antifoundationalism extends its
concerns to ontology, disavowing any concrete reality outside our social
constructions. Some antifoundationalists, like Derrida, claim there is no

Articulating a Consultative Epistemology                    67

independent realm beyond that of language and signification and that the
practice of dividing reality up into signifiers and the aspects of reality
they signify is fallacious. For Derrida, there is nothing outside of signi-
fication, no underlying foundational reality. Signifiers merely lead to
other signifiers ad infinitum. That is our world. The method that he pio-
neered therefore involves the semiotic deconstruction of texts—the criti-
cal analysis of all repositories of meaning in order to reveal, among other
things, how meanings have been constructed within them, how contra-
dictory, transitory, and unstable they are, and the temporary purposes
they serve.

Antifoundationalists like Derrida therefore agree with Nietzsche when
he says, “There are no facts, only interpretations” (qtd. in Ayers and
O’Grady 318); or with Rorty when he maintains that truth is not truth
because it corresponds to some external reality, but rather because it “just
plain enables us to cope” (“Pragmatism and Philosophy” 31). We have only
each other, our communities, and the truths we create. Any given para-
digm, be it scientific, philosophical, political, economic, social, or religious,
is just one more coping strategy, one more tool, one more vocabulary, with
temporary practical utility, but with no foundational basis.

Granted, some horizontalists are not this extreme. Many social con-
structionists acknowledge that a real world exists beyond discourse, sig-
nification, or other forms of social construction (Atkinson and Gregory
603). However, while they may avoid antifoundationalism, they agree
with Kuhn when he says that data do not simply appear to us as an
unmediated presence (as discussed below). Rather, we notice and interpret
data in ways that are molded by our paradigmatic expectations. Therefore,
for both social constructionists4 and more extreme antifoundationalists,
the question of whether or not an underlying reality exists ultimately
makes little epistemological difference in terms of how we know and inter-
act with the world. In both cases, for all practical purposes, there is no
ultimate foundational basis for truth, universal principles, or shared stan-
dards, because there is no realm of fixed knowledge or meaning (at least
that we can access) from which we can assess the relative merits of any
truth claims. This view leads, of course, to postures of extreme cultural

68            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

and ethical relativism. It also leads to the central and well-known paradox
of horizontal approaches to knowledge: to state that all truths are social-
ly constructed and hence relative, and that universal truths therefore have
no foundational basis is, itself, an absolutist universal truth claim.5

CONSULTATIVE EPISTEMOLOGY: UNDERLYING PREMISES

Having outlined the vertical and horizontal approaches to knowledge and
the unresolved tension between them, we now turn toward the task of
articulating a consultative epistemology that we claim draws upon valid
insights from both approaches, resolves the tension between them, and
transcends their respective limitations. Our approach is informed by a
number of premises, all of which stem from our understanding of the
Bahá’í teachings, especially those related to the practice of Bahá’í consul-
tation and the acquisition of knowledge.

Bahá’í consultation is, in brief, an approach to collective inquiry and
deliberation that is intended to be unifying rather than divisive.
Participants are encouraged to exercise freedom of expression and engage
in probing, critical analysis, yet they must strive to express themselves
with care and moderation, and remain detached from preconceived opin-
ions and positions. They are to regard diversity of perspective as an asset
and actively solicit the views, concerns, insights, and expertise of others.
After ideas are expressed, the ideas are no longer bound to the individu-
als who express them. Instead, ideas become collective resources that can
be freely adopted, refined, or discarded, according to the collective wisdom
of the group (Consultation). Referring to the epistemological function of
this model, Bahá’u’lláh writes that

> “[c]onsultation bestoweth greater awareness and transmuteth conjec-
> ture into certitude. It is a shining light which, in a dark world, leadeth
> the way and guideth. For everything there is and will continue to be
> a station of perfection and maturity. The maturity of the gift of under-
standing is made manifest through consultation.” (Consultation no. 3)

There are a number of basic premises that appear to underlie the epis-
temological function of consultation. These include (but are not limited
to) the following:

1. Reality has a definite and ordered existence outside of human perception or
comprehension.6 Bahá’u’lláh writes that God, “out of utter nothingness,
hath created the reality of all things” and “hath brought into being the
most refined and subtle elements of His creation. . . .” (Gleanings 64–65).
“Upon the inmost reality of each and every created thing,” Bahá’u’lláh
continues, “He hath shed the light of one of His names, and made it a
recipient of the glory of one of His attributes” (65). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá further
explains that

> nature is subjected to an absolute organization, to determined laws, to
> a complete order and a finished design, from which it will never
> depart—to such a degree, indeed, that if you look carefully and with
> keen sight, from the smallest invisible atom up to such large bodies of
> the world of existence as the globe of the sun or the other great stars
> and luminous spheres, whether you regard their arrangement, their
> composition, their form or their movement, you will find that all are
> in the highest degree of organization and are under one law from
> which they will never depart. (Some Answered Questions 3)

2. Human comprehension is limited and finite but still capable, to some degree,
of discovering foundational truths. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states, “[T]he human
mind, the human intellect, the human thought are limited” (Promulgation
421). Or, as Bahá’u’lláh explains, “To whatever heights the mind of the
most exalted of men may soar, however great the depths which the
detached and understanding heart can penetrate, such mind and heart can
never transcend that which is the creature of their own conceptions and
the product of their own thoughts” (Gleanings 317). Yet, according to the
Bahá’í teachings, the pursuit of knowledge is still a valid and important
goal. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá assures us that, to some extent at least, humans “can
discover the realities of things, comprehend the peculiarities of beings, and

70             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

penetrate the mysteries of existence” (Some Answered Questions 188). He
also states that “[t]he mind and the thought of man sometimes discover
truths, and from this thought and discovery signs and results are pro-
duced. This thought has a foundation” (Some Answered Questions 253). At
the same time, there remain “limitations to which man’s finite mind hath
been strictly subjected” (Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings 317).

3. Human comprehension is divergent. The human mind is shaped by the
different innate capacities, life experiences, educational training, and so
forth, of individuals, resulting in diverse understandings of, or perspec-
tives on, the same phenomena. “[C]onceptions vary,” Bahá’u’lláh thus
states, “by reason of the divergences in men’s thoughts and opinions”
(Tablets 139). As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains, “[A]lthough the object being
viewed is the same, nevertheless the viewpoints and stations of these mys-
tic knowers are different” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “Commentary”).

4. While we cannot penetrate the ontological essences of phenomena, we can
gain knowledge of them by examining their attributes or qualities. According
to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “Phenomenal, or created, things are known to us only by
their attributes. Man discerns only manifestations, or attributes, of
objects, while the identity, or reality, of them remains hidden. . . . the real-
ities of material phenomena are impenetrable and unknowable and are
only apprehended through their properties or qualities. . . .” (Promulga-
tion 421).

5. Diverse perspectives on complex and multifaceted issues can be complemen-
tary. This is because a given perspective may only “illumine but one aspect
of things” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Divine Philosophy 186). In our efforts to compre-
hend the reality or essence of a given phenomenon, our cognitive perspec-
tives cause us to notice different attributes, qualities, or facets of that phe-
nomenon. In this regard, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written that “[t]ruth has many
aspects” and “there are many roads leading thereto”; and “truth is one,
although its manifestations may be very different” (Paris Talks 53, 128).
This premise appears to underlie ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s explanation, in reference
to consultation, that “the views of several individuals are assuredly prefer-
able to one man, even as the power of a number of men is of course greater
than the power of one man” (Consultation no. 17).

6. Knowledge of reality can be advanced and refined systematically, over time.

This premise underlies the Bahá’í teachings regarding the complementary
roles that science and religion play in carrying forward an ever-advancing
civilization. Regarding science, the Bahá’í writings are replete with refer-
ences to “scientific advancement,” such as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s observation that
“[i]f comparison be made with the sum total of all former human achieve-
ments, it will be found that the discoveries, scientific advancement and
material civilization of this present century have equaled, yea far exceed-
ed the progress and outcome of one hundred former centuries”
(Promulgation 143). Regarding religion, the Bahá’í concept of progressive
revelation speaks to a parallel process in the advancement of humanity’s
collective spiritual insight, as diverse facets of truth are revealed over
time. As Shoghi Effendi explains,

The fundamental principle enunciated by Bahá’u’lláh . . . is that reli-
> gious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is a
> continuous and progressive process, that all the great religions of the
> world are divine in origin, that their basic principles are in complete
> harmony, that their aims and purposes are one and the same, that
> their teachings are but facets of one truth, that their functions are
> complementary, that they differ only in the non-essential aspects of
> their doctrines and that their missions represent successive stages in
> the spiritual evolution of human society.

In summary, Bahá’í epistemology appears to be based on the following
premises (among others). Many phenomena do have an existence that is
independent of human thought. Such phenomena can be complex and
multifaceted. Human comprehension is finite and limited—as well as
divergent—relative to such phenomena. Humans gain knowledge of the
manifest aspects of phenomena (that is, their attributes, qualities, proper-
ties) rather than of their essences. Knowledge of complex phenomena is
maximized when diverse perspectives illuminate multiple aspects of the
same phenomena. Knowledge of phenomena can accumulate, and be
refined, over time.

CONSULTATIVE EPISTEMOLOGY: DERIVED CONCEPTS

Based on the premises above, we develop a network of concepts below
aimed at resolving the perennial tension between vertical and horizontal
approaches to knowledge. Our central concern is to reconcile the perceived
incompatibility between foundational and relative approaches to truth.

PARADIGMATIC DIVERSITY AND ASPECTS OF PHENOMENA

Paradigmatic Diversity. Our line of reasoning begins with the third prem-
ise discussed in the preceding section: that human comprehension is diver-
gent and human conceptions of any given phenomenon often vary.
Another way of saying this is that different people often look at reality
through different cognitive lenses or interpretive frameworks. Kuhn’s
concept of a paradigm provides a useful model for thinking about these
lenses or frameworks. He reminds us that diverse human conceptions are
not entirely idiosyncratic. Rather, different conceptual frameworks are
often shared by groups of people whose minds have been shaped or
trained to see various phenomena in similar ways. A paradigm, in this
sense, can be defined as a cognitive lens or, more broadly, an interpretative
framework made up of shared ideas, assumptions, metaphysical principles,
values, methodological approaches, and instrumental techniques that con-
dition the way we observe, make sense out of, and relate to, specific phe-
nomena.7 While some paradigms are more compelling than others, para-
digms are not all-encompassing mental cages from which we cannot
escape. People can employ multiple paradigms, which can overlap in com-
plex ways, to make sense out of different aspects of reality. Some para-
digms are also more encompassing in the range of their views than oth-
ers. In addition, although it can be dramatic in some cases, people are
capable of abandoning familiar paradigms and adopting new ones, or
revising existing paradigms, under certain circumstances—as can be seen
with revolutions in scientific thought, with conversions in religious belief,
or, less momentously, with the consideration a given problem or issue
from a substantially different point of view.

Given the above definition of a paradigm, one can say that human com-
prehension is divergent because it is paradigmatically conditioned. The
implications of this statement are twofold. First, any given human mind
can employ different paradigms to understand different phenomena. For
instance, a person can employ one interpretive framework to explain the
motion of a falling object and another interpretive framework to explain
the behavior of a crying child, without any cognitive dissonance.8 Second,
different minds often adopt different paradigms in their attempt to under-
stand the same phenomena. For instance, historically, some physicists
studied the behavior of light by employing particle theory while others
employed wave theory. Most physicists now understand both theories to
be equally legitimate and complementary because they each appear to
reveal different aspects of the same phenomenon.

Aspect Selection, Aspect Interpretation, and Aspect Relativism. The last exam-
ple above helps to reintroduce premises 4 and 5 from the preceding sec-
tion: we know phenomena by their qualities or aspects, and complex phe-
nomena are multifaceted or have many aspects. Given the multifaceted
nature of many phenomena, along with the paradigmatically structured
nature of human comprehension, one can say that diverse understandings
of a given phenomenon arise for two reasons. First, different people notice
different aspects of a given phenomenon depending on the paradigmatic
lenses through which they view it. The example from physics cited above,
in which one theory suggests the particle-like aspect of light and another
theory suggests the wave-like aspect of light, is a good illustration of this.
Figure 1, below, provides an even simpler (and widely familiar) illustra-
tion of this, as some people are cognitively inclined to notice the duck
while others are inclined to notice the rabbit within the illustration. We
will refer to this process of noticing different aspects of a phenomenon as
aspect selection.

The second reason diverse understandings of a given phenomenon arise
is that, even when different people notice the same aspect of a given phe-
nomenon, they often interpret that aspect differently because of the differ-
ent paradigmatic lenses they employ. For instance, one person might

Figure 1. The duck-rabbit.

notice the rabbit in the above illustration and be cognitively inclined to
interpret it as a friendly pet. Another person might also notice the rabbit
but be inclined to interpret it as a tasty meal. The same process occurs
with more complex phenomena as well. For example, some people might
notice inner-city poverty among African-Americans in parts of the United
States and interpret it primarily as a function of ongoing institutional
racism in that country. Other people might notice the same thing but
interpret it primarily as a function of rigid class barriers, while others
might interpret it as a function of learned cultural patterns, or even inher-
ent biological differences. We will refer to this process of interpreting a
phenomenal aspect (whether that interpretation is valid or not) as aspect
interpretation.

The combination of aspect selection and aspect interpretation results
in two forms of aspect relativism that we will call selective relativism and
interpretative relativism. In other words, the relativity of truth claims
regarding a given phenomenon can result from divergent processes of
aspect selection and divergent processes of aspect interpretation.
However, as illustrated by the particle theory and wave theory of light

discussed above, divergent truth claims do not necessarily imply the
existence of conflict or error in human comprehension. Rather, the con-
cepts of selective relativism and interpretative relativism help us under-
stand the relativity of truth, because the aspects we notice and how we
interpret them are, to some extent at least (see below), relative to the par-
adigms we employ.

In light of the concepts of selective relativism and interpretive rela-
tivism, we can also rephrase our initial definition of a paradigm. For our
purposes, we can define a paradigm as a cognitive lens or a perceptual
framework that influences our selection and interpretation of phenomenal
aspects. Paradigms thus enable us, however imperfectly, to approach foun-
dational reality by bringing different aspects of phenomena to our atten-
tion and by conditioning our interpretations of those aspects.

Interpretations, it should also be noted, fall into two broad categories
that are important to distinguish for analytical purposes. On one hand,
some interpretations of phenomena are associated with the assertion of
truth claims, or knowledge, regarding those phenomena. The assertion
that light acts like a particle and the assertion that light acts like a wave
are interpretations of this type. We refer to these as epistemic interpreta-
tions because they pertain to knowledge claims. On the other hand, some
interpretations are associated with the attachment of meanings to phe-
nomena. For instance, some cultures attach a positive connotation to
dogs, considering them “man’s best friend” and letting them live inside
the home in close and affectionate contact with members of the family,
while other cultures attach a more negative connotation to dogs, consid-
ering them unclean animals and never allowing them into homes. We
refer to these as semiotic interpretations because they pertain to meaning.
Even though the boundary between knowledge and meaning, or epistemic
and semiotic interpretations, is not easily demarcated, and the two can
overlap and influence each other in complex ways, this paper, as a study in
epistemology, is concerned primarily with the former. Therefore, when
we refer to aspect interpretation and interpretive relativism in this paper,
we are generally referring to epistemic interpretations.

It is also important to note that the boundary between aspect selection
76             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

and aspect interpretation can be equally difficult to demarcate at times
because the two processes can impact each other. For example, the process
of categorizing distinct, previously selected phenomenal aspects (that is,
constructing systems of categorization) is a highly interpretive act that
can dramatically affect further aspect selection. In fact, some categoriza-
tion schemes can even cause us to “perceive” phenomenal aspects that may
have little basis in foundational reality. However, if these important quali-
fications are kept in mind, we believe that the distinction between aspect
selection and aspect interpretation is very useful as a heuristic device.

Finally, we should acknowledge that our discussion up to this point
merely reaffirms insights that many vertical and horizontal epistemolo-
gists have already articulated in various ways. We have simply ground-
ed certain epistemological insights from both traditions in a set of prem-
ises found in the Bahá’í writings, and have also provided simple concep-
tual vocabulary that will make it easier for us to discuss and expand
these insights as we take further steps down the path of reconciling
truth and relativism.

Summary. To summarize the main insights we have covered so far, we have
pointed out that many phenomena are complex and multifaceted, and that
human comprehension is limited and divergent in relation to such phe-
nomena. We have noted that human conceptions of a given phenomenon
can vary because human thought tends to be paradigmatically condi-
tioned. We have defined a paradigm as a cognitive lens, or a perceptual
framework, that influences the process of aspect selection (that is, which
aspects of a phenomenon we notice) as well as the process of aspect inter-
pretation (that is, how we understand, explain or make sense of those
aspects, and indeed, how we categorize an aspect). Furthermore, we have
suggested that these paradigmatically conditioned processes of aspect
selection and aspect interpretation results in two forms of aspect relativism
that we call selective relativism and interpretative relativism. Or stated anoth-
er way, we have suggested that the relativity of truth claims regarding a
given phenomenon can result from divergent processes of aspect selection
and/or divergent processes of aspect interpretation.

THE DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REALITY AND PARADIGMS

Paradigm/Aspect Attunement. The next step down the path of reconciling foun-
dationalist (vertical) and relativist (horizontal) conceptions of truth is to rec-
ognize that, although different paradigms may offer complementary insights
into reality, this does not imply that all paradigmatic lenses yield equally valid
insights regarding a specific phenomenon, or, by extension, that all truth
claims are equally valid, as some horizontalists assert. It merely implies that
any given paradigmatic lens has the potential to yield valid insights about
reality. There are two closely related reasons for this qualification.

First, we believe that some paradigms are more (or less) well-attuned to
specific phenomenal aspects than other paradigms are to those same
aspects. This is the reason, presumably, that if we have a broken femur, we
would turn to an orthopedic surgeon rather than a political economist
who studies health care industries; yet if we want to reform our health
care industries through public policy measures, we might do well to turn
to a political economist for insight and advice. Both paradigms represent-
ed by these two individuals, we assume, are (more or less) attuned to dif-
ferent aspects of health care delivery.

Second, we believe that any given paradigm may be more (or less)
attuned to one or more specific aspects of a phenomenon than it is to other
aspects of that same phenomenon. For instance, assume we are trying to
understand and address the conditions that inhibit social and economic
development among impoverished communities in a given region. If we
examine this complex issue through the lens of feminist development the-
ory, we are likely to find strong empirical evidence that the education and
empowerment of females is one of the greatest single determining factors
in the social and economic advancement of an entire community. However,
feminist development theory may reveal less about other specific aspects
of community development that may also require attention, such as tech-
nical challenges that may be related to water purification needs in the
region, or ecological constraints that may apply to specific agricultural
practices in the region. To better understand and address those aspects,
we might benefit from turning to other paradigmatic lenses.

78             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

In all of the cases described above, we refer to this relationship between
a paradigm and a phenomenal aspect as the relative attunement between the
two. Attunement, as we define the term, refers to the goodness-of-fit
between a specific paradigm (or specific paradigmatic insight) and a specif-
ic phenomenal aspect. For instance, the Ptolemaic paradigm of a geocen-
tric solar system appears to have less attunement to orbital relationships
within our solar system than the Copernican paradigm of a heliocentric
solar system. As a result of the relative attunement between different par-
adigms and different phenomenal aspects, some paradigmatic truth claims
appear to represent certain features of reality more accurately than do
other paradigmatic truth claims.

Reality as Both Enabling and Constraining the Social Construction of
Knowledge. Verticalists, of course, will have no problem with the concept
of attunement. Horizontalists, however, will find the concept highly prob-
lematic. Even horizontalists who acknowledge the possibility of a founda-
tional reality (that is, many social constructionists) tend to dismiss its rel-
evance on the grounds that the human mind does not have access to it. In
other words, horizontalists assume that our paradigms can never become
attuned with any aspects of phenomena in the sense that they in any way
reflect some underlying reality. However, in our view, by making this
sweeping assumption horizontalists fail to take seriously the dynamic
relationship between foundational reality and the social construction of
truth. Our next step down the path of reconciling foundationalist and rel-
ativist approaches to truth will therefore be to explore this dynamic rela-
tionship.

For reasons that we will elaborate below, we believe that foundational
reality imposes constraints on the extent to which it can be socially con-
structed. In other words, reality sets conditions on the degree to which our
truth claims about it can lack correspondence with the way it actually is.
Feyerabend provides a clue to understanding why this is so when he says
that scientists “are sculptors of reality” (269). Taking this analogy further,
we suggest that sculptors need materials with which to work, otherwise
they cannot sculpt; those materials must retain properties, otherwise they

would not be materials; those properties must involve conditions, other-
wise they would not be properties; those conditions must impose demands,
otherwise they would not be conditions; and those demands must con-
strain, otherwise they would not be demands. Hence, the social construc-
tion of truth, like sculpting, is conditioned by the “stuff ” with which it
works. As Longino explains, “there is ‘something out there’ that imposes
limits on what we can say about it” (222).

The sculpting analogy also suggests that because reality constrains, it
enables our ability to socially construct it as well. One cannot sculpt
unless there is something, with properties and thus constraints, to sculpt.
Social construction is impossible in the absence of at least some trace of
reality that imposes demands on it. Reality-as-enabling and reality-as-con-
straining are thus two sides of the same coin. Moreover, the enabling and
constraining nature of reality affirms that it is foundational. It may be, for
instance, that some cultural groups categorize a certain combination of
light-wave frequencies as the distinct color “green,” while others catego-
rize it simply as a “shade of blue.” However, this combination of light-wave
frequencies is less likely to be categorized as a variation of red, and it is
even less likely to be categorized as a shape (a triangle?).

The fact that light-wave frequencies permit us to socially construct cat-
egories of color from them demonstrates the enabling nature of reality,
while the fact that we are unlikely to categorize some colors as others
(that is, yellow as blue—although color blindness might lead to this), and
even less likely to categorize any color as a shape, demonstrates con-
straint. As another example, consider the physical death of human beings.
The foundational nature of this process has enabled different cultural
groups to imbue it with a range of interpretations: the end of life, the
beginning of an afterlife, the beginning of a next phase of reincarnation,
and so forth. Yet the foundational reality of death simultaneously places
some constraints on its interpretation. It is not easy, for instance, to
socially construct death as a mere color (green?) or a mere shape (a trian-
gle?), nor can its existence rationally be denied, since everyone has to
grapple with it.9

Contrary to Rorty, therefore, we conclude that the social construction of
80            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

truth cannot enable us to “cope” with the world unless it is in some (direct
or indirect) way anchored to a foundational reality. Returning to the sculp-
tor metaphor: the only reason a sculptor can effectively chisel a piece of
marble is because the sculptor is addressing, upon impact, some aspect of
“the way marble is”—such as the way it breaks. Using a chisel effectively
to chip away marble requires some attunement on the part of the sculptor
with this quality of the marble. Thus the sculptor does not mistake “the
way marble is” with “the way water is” in the process of sculpting.
Moreover, why is it that sculptors have, over time, been able to make bet-
ter chisels (that is, develop better instruments for coping)? Is it not
because, upon repeated encounters with marble, some sculptors have
become increasingly attuned to certain qualities of the marble and the way
it responds to the chisel? Coping entails working within constraints,
which entails the possibility of ever-increasing attunement with those
constraints, and thus with some aspects of the way things are. However,
as the discussion that follows will make clear, some aspects are more
enabling than others, resulting in some truth claims being more socially
constructed than other truth claims (that is, in the interpretations of some
phenomenal aspects corresponding less directly with those aspects than
the interpretations of other aspects).

Summary. Before exploring this theme it will help once again to summa-
rize the main insights from the last two sections of our discussion. We
have noted in these sections that, although different paradigms may offer
complementary insights into reality, this does not imply that all paradig-
matic lenses yield equally valid insights regarding a specific phenomenon,
or, by extension, that all truth claims are equally valid. It merely implies
that any given paradigmatic lens has the potential to yield valid insights
about reality. In this regard, some paradigms are more (or less) well-
attuned to specific phenomenal aspects than other paradigms are to those
same aspects; in addition, any given paradigm may be more (or less)
attuned to one or more specific aspects of a phenomenon than it is to other
aspects of that same phenomenon. We refer to this relationship between a
paradigm and a phenomenal aspect as the relative attunement between the

two. Attunement, as we define the term, refers to the goodness-of-fit
between a specific paradigmatic interpretation and a specific phenomenal
aspect (or aspects). After articulating the concept of attunement, we then
began to explore the dynamic relationship between foundational reality
and the social construction of truth. In this regard, we noted that founda-
tional reality both enables and constrains the extent to which given phe-
nomenal aspects can be socially constructed—as illustrated by the sculpt-
ing analogy.

ASPECT TANGIBILITY AND THE DYNAMICS OF SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION

Aspect Tangibility. Some phenomenal aspects are more constraining of
social construction than others due to a property we call aspect tangibility.
Tangibility, as we are using the term, refers to the degree to which a given
phenomenal aspect (a) will be noticed by different paradigmatic lenses and
(b) will be interpreted similarly by the different paradigmatic lenses that
notice it. In other words, tangibility is like an anchor that increases, in pro-
portion to its weight, (a) the possibility that an aspect will be noticed, or
selected, by different paradigms (thus reducing selective relativism); and
(b) the likelihood that a given aspect will be interpreted in a consistent
way by different paradigms (thus reducing interpretive relativism).

The concept of tangibility can be illustrated with the following con-
trasting examples. On the one hand, the physical pain from a broken bone
or a toothache has relatively high tangibility. Such pain is almost impos-
sible not to notice (it exerts highly indiscriminate selective pull across
paradigms), and it constrains the degree to which it can be socially con-
structed by different paradigmatic lenses (it exerts relatively high inter-
pretive constraint). Few people, for instance, would interpret such pain as
pleasure, or as a normal state of affairs requiring no attention. On the
other hand, the physical attribute of skin color is less tangible than a bro-
ken bone or a toothache. Though some people pay little attention to it,
everyone with functioning vision can physically see it (like a toothache, it
exerts relatively indiscriminate selective pull). Yet skin color is prone to a
wide range of interpretations as evidenced by the many ways we have

82            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

been paradigmatically conditioned to think about it (it offers low interpre-
tive constraint).

Another illustration of tangibility, which Bahá’ís will be familiar with,
pertains to the relative tangibility of different revealed statements. As
the Universal House of Justice has explained, “Some sayings of the
Manifestation are clear and obvious. Among these are laws of behaviour.
Others are elucidations which lead men from their present level of under-
standing to a new one. Others are pregnant allusions, the significance of
which only becomes apparent as the knowledge and understanding of the
reader grow” (Messages 547). While Bahá’ís accept all revealed statements
as truth, our ability to comprehend any given statement (and thus the
aspect[s] of reality that the statement refers to) depends on the tangibili-
ty of the statement and/or the relative attunement between the statement
and the paradigmatic lens through which it is read. In this regard, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and Shoghi Effendi, as the authoritative interpreters of the revealed
Word, assist us in this process of attunement. Without their help, we
would tend to arrive at very divergent (or highly socially constructed)
individual interpretations (or truth claims) about the meaning of the less
tangible aspects (e.g., the pregnant allusions) of the Revelation.

The Relativity of Social Construction. The concept of tangibility therefore
helps us to understand how truth claims regarding some phenomenal
aspects tend to be more socially constructed than truth claims regarding
other phenomenal aspects. In other words, the social construction of an
aspect is directly related to the degree of tangibility of the aspect (assum-
ing we ignore the possibility of an authoritative interpretation, as dis-
cussed in the preceding paragraph).

With this in mind, it would be easy to assume that the likelihood for
social construction simply increases as tangibility decreases, in a simple,
inverse, linear relationship. Upon closer inspection, however, it appears
that this is not in fact the case. Instead, we suggest that the highest
degrees of aspect tangibility and the highest degrees of aspect intangi-
bility both constrain the social construction of truth. There appear to be
two reasons for this. First, highly tangible phenomena have such strong

interpretive constraint that they leave relatively little latitude for social
construction, as illustrated by the examples of the broken bone and the
toothache. Second, highly intangible phenomena provide very little to
work with, a situation which also constrains the process of social con-
struction. For instance, many of the ephemeral images and feelings that
flash through our dreams when we sleep are unlikely candidates to con-
struct viable truths from because most of these images and feelings are
so intangible they hardly register in consciousness. In this case, any
grounding in the foundational is tenuous, thus providing little of sub-
stance to construct.

To grasp the relationship between tangibility and social construction
more fully, a simple analogy is again helpful. Consider a sculptor desiring
to work with clay. On one occasion, the sculptor comes across a piece of
hardened clay that has already been through the kiln. Its hardness—or its
complete tangibility—prevents the sculptor from molding it (that is,
socially constructing it). On another occasion, the sculptor comes across a
bucket of water containing scraps of mostly dissolved clay. This time its
liquidity or lack of constraint—its complete intangibility—also prevents
the sculptor from molding it. On a third occasion, the sculptor finds a
supply of pliant, supple clay. This time its supple plasticity—or its semi-
tangibility—allows the sculptor to mold it in creative ways (reflecting his
or her paradigmatic expectations and skills).

Thus, the maximum potential for social construction appears to occur
somewhere midway between the two extremes of strong tangibility and
strong intangibility, with phenomenal aspects that we call semi-tangible.
Semi-tangibility refers to that level of tangibility at which moderate to
strong selective pull combines with minimal interpretive constraint.
Given that the highest degrees of tangibility and intangibility both con-
strain the social construction of truth, and that the maximum potential
for social construction occurs somewhere midway between the two
extremes, there appears to be a bell-shaped relationship between aspect
tangibility and the potential for social construction, as illustrated in
Figure 2, below. This bell-shaped relationship illustrates two distinct
but related points. First, the more semi-tangible any given phenomenal

84            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

Figure 2. Relationship between the tangibility of a phenomenal aspect and the
potential degree to which the truth of that aspect can be socially constructed.

aspect is, the more prone it is to (or, the more it enables) social construc-
tion according to the interpretive logic of any given paradigm. From
this it follows that truth claims regarding some aspects can be more
socially constructed than truth claims regarding other aspects, notwith-
standing the paradigm being employed. Second, and consequently, the
more semi-tangible any given phenomenal aspect is, the more prone it is
to being socially constructed in divergent ways by people employing
diverse paradigms. This is a result of the aspect’s tendency to be (a)
selected by diverse paradigms and (b) socially constructed in accordance
with the interpretative logics of those diverse paradigms. Thus the
degree of diversity among paradigmatic constructions of any given phe-
nomenal aspect is a function of the degree to which that aspect is semi-
tangible. In other words, the relativity among the various social con-
structions of truth regarding a given phenomenal aspect is, itself, rela-
tive to the degree to which the phenomenal aspect is semi-tangible. We
refer to this as the relativity of relativity.
The relativity of relativity can be understood by extending the clay

metaphor outlined above using three distinct scenarios. First, imagine a
diverse group of potters with different training, assumptions, and tech-
niques (that is, paradigms) who are each given a round piece of clay that
has already been fired in a kiln. Despite the diverse paradigmatic expec-
tations each of the potters bring to his or her craft, none of the potters
are able to mold this clay because its extreme hardness, or tangibility, is
too constraining to work with. Second, imagine the same potters are
each given a piece of equally pliable clay. They now create diverse ceram-
ic objects because the clay’s pliancy, or semi-tangibility, enables them to
mold the clay in different ways in accordance with their divergent
expectations and skills. Third, imagine the same potters are given bowls
of water containing largely dissolved scraps of clay. None of the potters
create anything from this clay because its liquidity, or intangibility, pre-
vents them from working with it at all, regardless of the different train-
ing, assumptions, and techniques (that is, paradigms) they bring to it.

As these three scenarios demonstrate, the diversity of constructions the
potters produce is a function of the degree of semi-tangibility of the clay.10
Or stated another way, the relativity among the various constructions is,
itself, relative to the degree to which the clay (that is, the phenomenal
aspect) is semi-tangible. Hence the relativity of relativity.11

Summary. Given the density of this discussion, and the highly abstract
nature of these insights, it will again help to summarize some of our
recent points before moving on. In building our argument regarding the
relativity of relativity, we suggested that some phenomenal aspects are
more constraining than others due to a property we call aspect tangibility.
Tangibility, as we are using the term, refers to the degree to which a given
phenomenal aspect (a) will be noticed by different paradigmatic lenses
and (b) will be interpreted similarly by the different paradigmatic lenses
that notice it. At this point we stated that tangibility thus acts like an
anchor that, in proportion to its weight, reduces selective relativism and
interpretive relativism. This insight enables us to recognize, in turn, why
truth claims regarding some phenomenal aspects might be more socially
constructed than truth claims regarding other phenomenal aspects. This

86            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

is because the social construction of an aspect is directly related to the
tangibility of that aspect. However, we then went on to clarify our state-
ment by arguing that the relationship between tangibility and social con-
struction is not simply an inverse linear one, but is in fact curvilinear.
That is, we suggested that high degrees of aspect tangibility and high
degrees of aspect intangibility both constrain the social construction of
truth. Thus the maximum potential for social construction appears to
occur midway between the two extremes of strong tangibility and strong
intangibility, with phenomenal aspects that we call semi-tangible. Semi-
tangibility refers to that level of tangibility at which moderate to strong
selective pull combines with minimal interpretive constraint. The more
semi-tangible any given phenomenal aspect is, the more prone it is to (the
more it enables) social construction according to the interpretive logic of
any given paradigm. Furthermore, the more semi-tangible any given
phenomenal aspect is, the more prone it is to being socially constructed
in divergent ways by people employing diverse paradigms. The result is
the relativity of relativity.

TYPES OF PARADIGM/ASPECT ATTUNEMENT.

Having explained how some truth claims can be more socially construct-
ed than others, and why some truth claims tend to be socially construct-
ed in more divergent ways than others, we return to our discussion of
attunement. In particular, it is important to further probe and elaborate
the ways that different paradigms potentially access and represent differ-
ent aspects of reality. To discuss this relationship we offer a rudimentary
schema that enables us to think about four different types of attunement:
general attunement, specified attunement, anomalous attunement, and fabricated
attunement, each of which is described briefly below.

General Attunement. As our discussion of tangibility indicated, some phe-
nomenal aspects are noticed and understood basically (not necessarily
completely) for what they are, across a wide variety of paradigmatic
lenses (sometimes, perhaps, independently of any paradigmatic lenses).

Such phenomenal aspects radiate tangibility in a strong and indiscrimi-
nate manner. “Walls are solid, fire burns, knives cut”; these realities have
what Benson and Stangroom call “brute clarity” (41)—or what we call
general aspect clarity. Notwithstanding our diverse views of the world, we
experience such realities quite directly, immediately, in a largely unmedi-
ated or transparent manner. They are almost universally manifest, cut-
ting through nearly any paradigmatic fog.

Of course, there are probably no phenomenal aspects or qualities, no
matter how tangible, that constrain epistemic interpretation completely.
Moreover, some degree of semiotic interpretation can always occur, since
diverse meanings can be attached to anything. For instance, a naturalist
might come across a ten-ton granite boulder and consider it a thing of awe
and beauty while a road builder might consider the same boulder a nui-
sance. This paper, however, is concerned with epistemic interpretations. In
this regard, every rational person who comes across this boulder should
agree that it is too heavy for a single human to pick up. The mass of the
boulder, upon experience, constrains epistemic interpretations or truth
claims to the contrary. Due to the extreme tangibility of phenomenal
aspects such as the mass of the boulder, epistemic interpretation of such
an aspect is constrained across paradigms, resulting in minimal epistemic
construction and relativism. The result is general attunement. Likewise,
most people would agree that the sun provides light that is essential to
many forms of life. This is another example of general attunement.

Specified Attunement. Other phenomenal aspects appear to be less directly
or experientially accessible to human comprehension and are therefore
more dependent upon paradigmatically facilitated forms of knowing. Such
phenomenal aspects offer the possibility of attunement with some para-
digms more than with others—or they offer specified aspect clarity. In other
words, a specific phenomenal aspect might be noticed and, over time,
brought into relatively clear focus, only by a specific paradigm, because of
the particular configuration of that paradigm. Specified attunement is thus
an instance of positive feedback between an aspect and a paradigm. Upon
initial investigation, the aspect partially confirms the paradigmatic

88            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

probes; the paradigm is in turn refined, through experience, according to
demands asserted by the aspect; through further investigation this
process continues, in a reiterative manner, resulting in ever-greater levels
of specified attunement. Unlike general aspect clarity, therefore, the result
is increasing levels of aspect clarity specific to a given paradigm. For
instance, consider the study of health and healing. Biomedical sciences
have clearly achieved a degree of specified aspect clarity with regard to
some aspects of emergency health care. The methods of biomedical sci-
ence work relatively well with certain conditions, suggesting some
grounding in, and at least some specified attunement with, some aspects
of reality that other paradigms may not be well attuned to. This is why
most of us would turn to medical doctors, rather than sociologists who
study the social construction of medicine, in an effort to cope with a brain
aneurysm. Yet these social constructionists have arguably (and ironically)
achieved a degree of specified aspect clarity regarding the social construc-
tion of some illnesses, such as the disease known as “female hysteria” in
the nineteenth century and the way this social construct perpetuated gen-
der inequalities.

Anomalous Attunement. Some phenomenal aspects are noticed only by some
paradigmatic lenses, but those lenses may still be incapable of yielding valid
knowledge about them. Such aspects can present fundamental challenges to
a paradigm, appearing as anomalies that defy the paradigm’s internal logic
or expectations. At the same time, this defiance of the paradigm’s logic is
how such aspects come to be noticed. Anomalous attunement is thus an
instance of negative feedback. As Kuhn explains, anomalies present a chal-
lenge or a crisis, and thus an opportunity for paradigmatic refinement—or
paradigmatic revolution when the anomaly is (or anomalies are) sufficient-
ly persistent and challenging. If such refinement or revolution is successful
then the anomalous relationship can potentially become a relationship of
specified attunement bringing about aspect clarity.12

Fabricated Attunement. On the other hand, if an anomaly presents itself to
a given paradigm and the proponents of that paradigm are able to socially

construct an explanation for the anomaly according to the original logic
of the paradigm or compatible auxiliary hypotheses/assumptions, the
result is fabricated attunement—an invalid truth claim that reflects the
relative absence of aspect clarity. For instance, when increasingly accurate
methods were developed to measure the movement of celestial bodies
across the night sky, and anomalies to the Ptolemaic/geocentric model of
the solar system started to emerge, astronomers adhering to the
Ptolemaic system attempted to explain away those anomalies by socially
constructing elaborate concepts such as “epicycles” and “equant points”
that served, for a time, as somewhat plausible explanations. As Kuhn
explains, defenders of such a paradigm “will devise numerous articulations
and ad hoc modifications of their theory in order to eliminate apparent
conflict” (140). They will attempt to neutralize anomalies by forcing them
to conform to paradigmatic expectations. Moreover, the less challenging
the anomalies are to a specific paradigm, or the more semi-tangible they
are (that is, amenable to social construction across paradigms), the more
they will be conformed. Of course, this need not be an intentional process,
but therein lies the problem. Proponents of fabrications generally do not
recognize them as such. Rather, these proponents can simply be too
attached to their own paradigmatic lenses, and therefore to the fabrica-
tions their lenses engender. Fabricated attunement is thus easily mistaken
for specified attunement.

Summary. The schema outlined above thus provides additional insight
into how some truth claims can be more socially constructed than other
truth claims. In summary, general attunement results from strong tangibil-
ity and thus general (close to universal) aspect clarity. It is associated
with phenomenal aspects that exert indiscriminate selective pull (that is,
where most, if not all paradigms notice them) along with a high degree
of constraint on epistemic interpretation. In cases of general attunement,
the social construction of an aspect is limited and relatively homogenous
across paradigms. Specified attunement is associated with phenomenal
aspects that exert more discriminate selective pull across paradigms and
strong interpretative constraint. When such aspects are viewed through

90            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

well-attuned paradigmatic lenses, the result is aspect clarity, which again
limits social construction (by those specific paradigms). Anomalous
attunement, if it results in successful paradigmatic change, can also lead
to specified attunement, and hence minimal social construction. On the
other hand, anomalous attunement can lead to fabricated attunement,
which is associated either with (a) highly semi-tangible aspects that
exert relatively indiscriminate selective pull along with minimal inter-
pretive constraint, or with (b) specific paradigms that are poorly attuned
to specific aspects. In either case, truth claims about those aspects will
be highly socially constructed in paradigmatically determined ways.
Moreover, in the case of the most semi-tangible aspects, the diversity
among paradigmatic constructions is maximized, resulting in the great-
est levels of relativity.

OVERVIEW

Together, the entire network of concepts articulated above helps explain
why some truth claims are more socially constructed than other truth
claims and, in turn, how the existence of foundational truths can be rec-
onciled with the relativity and social construction of truths. First, the
concepts of selective relativism and interpretative relativism assist us to
understand that those aspects of reality we select as significant, and
how we interpret them, are largely relative to the paradigms we employ.
Second, the concept of attunement assists us to understand that the valid-
ity of a particular paradigmatic truth claim is relative to the goodness-
of-fit between the paradigm that is employed and the phenomenal aspect
that is examined. Third, the concepts of aspect tangibility, semi-tangibil-
ity, and intangibility assist us to understand that some phenomenal
aspects are more (or less) likely to be noticed or selected through
diverse paradigmatic lenses, and then are more (or less) likely to be inter-
preted or socially constructed in divergent ways through those diverse
lenses. Fourth, the schema of general attunement, specified attunement, anom-
alous attunement, and fabricated attunement assists us to better understand

the processes by which any given paradigm can produce a range of social
constructions. Specifically, where general attunement and specified attune-
ment occur, aspect clarity results and the social construction of truth is
consequently minimized. Alternatively, where fabricated attunement
occurs, aspect clarity is negligible and the social construction of truth is
consequently maximized.

This network of concepts, and the consultative epistemology it is asso-
ciated with, thereby reconciles the perennial tension between vertical and
horizontal epistemologies while providing a conceptual vocabulary that
facilitates further inquiry that transcends these approaches. A consultative
epistemology affirms the verticalist position that foundational truths
exist, that some truth claims are more valid than others, and that some
paradigms are better suited than others for the investigation of specific
aspects of reality. A consultative epistemology also appreciates, in gener-
al, the horizontalist insight regarding the social construction of truths,
and that, in addition to reasons of justice, it is also epistemologically ben-
eficial to engage marginalized or subjugated paradigms to see what they
can offer.

However, a consultative epistemology transcends vertical and horizon-
tal approaches by affirming and explaining the relativity of the social con-
struction of different aspects of reality. In the process, it also affirms the
possibility that diverse paradigms can yield relatively valid and potential-
ly complementary truths as a result of their potential to achieve specified
aspect clarity regarding different aspects of reality. Finally, by affirming
and explaining the relativity of the social construction of different aspects
of reality, a consultative epistemology resolves the central paradox of hor-
izontal epistemologies: the universal truth claim that all knowledge is
socially constructed, and hence relative, and that universal truths there-
fore have no foundational basis. This paradox dissolves when one is able
to explain how and why the relativity of truth is, itself, relative. All truths
are, to some degree, socially constructed. Yet some truths are more social-
ly constructed than other truths, including the truth claim that all truths
are socially constructed.

CONSULTATIVE EPISTEMOLOGY: APPLICATIONS AND NEXT STEPS

The network of concepts articulated above, and the consultative episte-
mology it is associated with it, have practical applications within all do-
mains of human inquiry, deliberation, and collective decision making: from
the generation of knowledge through dynamics of systematic learning to
processes of community deliberation, institutional decision making, and
public policy formulation. This network of concepts, at a minimum, sug-
gests the need for profound humility regarding our presumed knowledge
regarding diverse aspects of reality; selfless detachment from our own
paradigmatically conditioned views; and moderation in the ways we set
forth our views. These concepts also highlight the need to sincerely value
and solicit diverse paradigmatic perspectives in order to gain a more com-
prehensive understanding of complex phenomena through inter-paradig-
matic collaboration. In this regard, these concepts remind us that “true
consultation is spiritual conference in the attitude and atmosphere of love”
(Promulgation 72). These concepts also reinforce the imperative of devel-
oping more integrative approaches to the acquisition and generation of
knowledge, as prescribed by the Universal House of Justice (20 July 1997).
In the absence of integrative approaches to knowledge pursued in a mode
of spiritual conference, egoistic attachment to specific paradigms tends to
result in the fragmentation of knowledge; in the perpetuation of unfound-
ed, misguided, and problematic social constructions; and in the generation
of unnecessary conflicts, as diverse paradigmatic insights are assumed to
be inherently incommensurable, conflictual, and irreconcilable rather than
potentially complementary.

There is much work remaining to be done in the elaboration of a con-
sultative epistemology and the development or refinement of its practical
applications. Drawing upon the principles of consultation outlined in the
Bahá’í Writings, next steps may include the development of more effec-
tive methodologies for inter-paradigmatic collaboration, by which propo-
nents of different paradigmatic perspectives can, with humility and
detachment, better learn how to probe and sift through their respective
truth claims, assess the relative merits of these claims, retain and inte-

grate that which is relatively true to reality, and discard what is not.
Other steps may include closer examination of the social, political, eco-
nomic, and spiritual conditions that support such integrative methodolo-
gies, and that enable all participants to transcend or diffuse the dynamics
of power that lead to the subjugation of relevant knowledge. Insights
from a consultative epistemology might also be adapted for the purpose
of shedding light on contemporary debates regarding cultural relativism,
in order to provide a rational basis for distinguishing valuable and enrich-
ing forms of cultural diversity from harmful cultural practices that violate
fundamental spiritual truths.

Finally, there is much work to be done correlating the conceptual
insights articulated in this paper with the practical challenges that
Lample addresses regarding learning, practice, and social transforma-
tion. Specifically, how can the conceptual insights developed in this
paper be applied by an expanding and increasingly diverse global com-
munity as it strives to learn how “to translate what is written into real-
ity”? How can these conceptual insights deepen our understanding of,
and appreciation for, the systematic processes of consultation, action,
and reflection that we are learning to apply in so many of our collective
endeavors? One of these endeavors, of course, is our participation in the
discourses of society—including our participation in prevailing dis-
courses on epistemology.

NOTES

1. Refer, for example, to discussions in Bernstein; Rorty, Consequences of Prag-
matism; and Turner.

2. Semple’s “Knowledge and the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh,” which examines
challenges associated with the pursuit of contemporary scholarship within the
framework of the Bahá’í Covenant, and Khan’s “Some Aspects of Bahá’í Scholar-
ship,” which outlines a series of basic concepts and principles that should guide
Bahá’í scholarship, also touch indirectly on the field of epistemology, but they are
not immediately relevant to the focus of this paper.

3. In contrast with epistemology, which is a branch of philosophy concerned
94              The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

with how we can know reality, ontology is a branch of philosophy concerned with
the nature of reality.

4. The so-called weak (including Mertonian) social constructionists represent
an exception to this form of relativism. They include thinkers such as Searle
(Construction) and Pinker (The Blank Slate) who draw a clear distinction between
social and “brute” facts. Some of their thinking is integrated in subsequent sec-
tions of this paper.

5. William Gairdner, in The Book of Absolutes: A Critique of Relativism and a
Defense of Universals, articulates a strong critique of this self-contradictory truth
claim, while establishing a compelling argument for the existence of universal,
foundational truths.

6. Kluge offers other compelling arguments in support of this premise, derived
from the Bahá’í writings, in his “Bahá’í Ontology: An Initial Reconnaissance;”
“Further Explorations in Bahá’í Ontology,” and “Relativism and the Bahá’í
Writings.”

7. Although Kuhn used the term paradigm in a number of ways, we have adopt-
ed his broadest use of the term, which has taken off within the philosophy of sci-
ence, where it has proven compatible with many horizontal epistemologies. The
paradigm, in this sense, has similarities with Wittgenstein’s language games and
Foucault’s discourses, as frameworks that influence human perception, understand-
ing, and action.

8. It is important to point out that many paradigms share common underlying
assumptions and other elements that can bring some level of coherence and mutu-
al reinforcement across paradigms, thus making some paradigms more mutually
compatible than others. For example, many of the dominant paradigms that are
employed in Western liberal cultures to understand and organize key social insti-
tutions (e.g., political, legal, economic, and educational institutions) are informed
by an underlying social contest schema that creates a level of mutual compatibil-
ity, and mutual reinforcement, across these paradigms. Refer to Karlberg for a dis-
cussion of this theme.

9. In emphasizing the impact of the foundational, Bryan S. Turner explains,
“[I]t’s obvious that people are born into different cultures in which processes of
sexuality, ageing, death, and dying are already schematized, elaborated and

symbolized in cultural terms. But I want to say just two things. One is a lot of
current theorizing entirely emphasizes classificatory processes, but classifica-
tion of what?” (255). In other words, classification must invariably be tied to
something foundational. As Turner goes on to explain in relationship to sex dif-
ferences: “Conventional distinctions between male and female have been made
very problematic by both anthropology and sociology. But even if sexuality is
produced by classificatory systems, it still seems to me that male and female
bodies are organically, physiologically, biochemically different phenomena. I
know there are problems with classifying biological sex differences. Biological
difference is socially produced by the endless reproduction of human beings, but
the classificatory systems can be seen as reflections upon differences in natural
phenomena” (256).

10. The diversity of social constructions is also a function of other factors,
such as motivation, which is not addressed in the preceding analogy and is, in
general, beyond the scope of this paper. Many horizontalists have already gen-
erated considerable insight into the role of motivation in processes of social con-
struction. Reconciling their work more fully with the conceptual framework
developed in this paper is a project that will need to be undertaken in the future.
Along the same lines, humanity’s response to the Revelation of God, notwith-
standing how tangible it is, also warrants particular attention. As Bahá’u’lláh
explains: “The Day-Star of certitude is shining resplendent but the people of the
world are holding fast unto vain imaginings. The Ocean of divine knowledge
hath risen high whilst the children of men are clinging to the hem of the foolish”
(Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh 252).

11. It is important to acknowledge that many phenomena are constructed
through paradigmatic interaction with different constellations of aspects that are
themselves constructed to varying degrees and combined in complex ways.
Again, elaborating these complex interactions is a project that is beyond the scope
of this paper and will need to be undertaken in the future.

12. An example would be Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which was able
to explain the particular orbit of Mars, which could not be accommodated by
Newtonian theory (see Chalmers 70).
