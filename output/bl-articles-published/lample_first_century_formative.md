Some Insights from the First
Century of the Formative Age
PAUL LAMPLE

Abstract
In 1930, Shoghi Effendi explained that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament would
require “at least a century of actual working before the treasures of wisdom hid-
den in it can be revealed.” In the closing years of the first century of the
Formative Age, we now have some greater insight into the implications of this
charter document. This article explores six concepts: the Covenant from a histor-
ical perspective; the range of authority and powers of the Universal House of
Justice; learning within an evolving framework for action; organic growth and
development; relationships among individuals, communities, and institutions; and
society-building power.

Résumé
En 1930, faisant référence au Testament d’‘Abdu’l-Bahá, le Gardien expliquait
qu’il faudra « au moins un siècle de travail réel avant que les trésors de la sagesse
qui y sont cachés puissent être révélés. » Alors que nous approchons de la fin du
premier siècle de l’âge de formation, il est possible de commencer à saisir quelque
peu les implications de cette charte. L’auteur explore six concepts : l’Alliance dans
une perspective historique; l’ampleur de l’autorité et des pouvoirs conférés à la
Maison universelle de justice; l’apprentissage dans un cadre d’action en constante
évolution; la croissance organique et le développement; les relations entre les
individus, les communautés et les institutions; le pouvoir de bâtir une société.

Resumen
En 1930, el Guardián explicó que la Voluntad y el Testamento de ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
requiere “por lo menos un siglo de trabajo real antes de que los tesoros de
sabiduría escondidos en él puedan ser revelados”. En los últimos años del primer
siglo de la Edad Formativa es posible tener un mayor conocimiento de las impli-
caciones de este documento carta magna. Se exploran seis conceptos: La Alianza
desde una Perspectiva Histórica; El Alcance de la Autoridad y los Poderes de la
Casa Universal de Justicia; Aprendiendo dentro de un Marco para la Acción que
Evoluciona; El Crecimiento y Desarrollo Orgánicos; Las Relaciones entre los
Individuos, las Comunidades y las Instituciones; y el Poder para Construir
Sociedad.

In outlining the unfoldment of the Cause, Shoghi Effendi described three
great ages: Heroic, Formative, and Golden. The Heroic, Apostolic, or
Primitive Age, marked by the ministries of the three Central Figures of
the Faith, was “unapproached in spiritual fecundity by any period associ-
ated with the mission of the Founder of any previous Dispensation” and
“was impregnated, from its inception to its termination, with the creative
energies generated through the advent of two independent Manifestations
and the establishment of a Covenant unique in the spiritual annals of
mankind” (Citadel 5).

The Formative, Transitional, or Iron Age of the Dispensation, the peri-
od in which the Faith progresses toward maturity, will, according to the
Guardian, witness the crowning stage in the erection of the framework of
the administration, the election of the Universal House of Justice, the cod-
ification and promulgation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the Mother-Book of
Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation, and the establishment of the Lesser Peace. He
also observed that the “unity of mankind will have been achieved and its
maturity attained, the Plan conceived by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will have been exe-
cuted, the emancipation of the Faith from the fetters of religious ortho-
doxy will have been effected, and its independent religious status will have
been universally recognized” (Citadel 6).

And finally, in the course of the Golden Age, the age of the culmination
and fulfillment of the promises of the Dispensation, “the banner of the
Most Great Peace, promised by its Author, will have been unfurled, the
World Bahá’í Commonwealth will have emerged in the plenitude of its
power and splendor, and the birth and efflorescence of a world civilization,
the child of that Peace, will have conferred its inestimable blessings upon
all mankind” (Citadel 6).

As people embrace the Faith and become struck by the wonder of a new
Manifestation and His Teachings, which offer the healing remedy to the
ills afflicting a sore-tried humanity, it is not unreasonable to expect to see
a dramatic transformation expressed in the lives of individual believers, in
the spirit and practice of the community, and in the wise and just minis-
trations of its institutions. While some faults are anticipated as part of the
developmental process, how long, one may wonder, must humanity wait

Some Insights                            33

for the promise of these Teachings to appear? The answer, Shoghi Effendi
explained, was to recognize that the profound changes promised by
Bahá’u’lláh would not appear spontaneously, but had to be patiently pur-
sued over a prolonged period through the sacrifice and struggles of those
who recognize Him. “I consider it my duty,” he wrote, “to warn every
beginner in the Faith that the promised glories of the Sovereignty which
the Bahá’í teachings foreshadow, can be revealed only in the fullness of
time, that the implications of the Aqdas and the Will of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, as
the twin repositories of the constituent elements of that Sovereignty, are
too far-reaching for this generation to grasp and fully appreciate” (World
Order 16).

The embryo in the womb, though fully human, cannot manifest the
powers of a later stage but is concentrated on its current developmental
needs. Even after birth, capabilities are acquired according to the degree
of effort and within the range of possibilities and limitations of organic
development, until the age of maturity is achieved, when, even as an adult,
development continues within another set of prospects and constraints.
What is necessary in order to contribute as much as possible to the
advancement of the Faith, is a greater awareness on the part of every
Bahá’í of its particular requirements, it potentialities, and its challenges
during each stage of development.

In the first years of the Formative Age, as Bahá’ís endeavored to forge
the instruments of the administrative order to systematically execute the
Divine Plan, Shoghi Effendi repeatedly emphasized their rudimentary
conceptions of the work at hand. A letter written on his behalf states, “The
contents of the Will of the Master are far too much for the present gener-
ation to comprehend. It needs at least a century of actual working before
the treasures of wisdom hidden in it can be revealed” (qtd. in Messages
1963-86 par. 75.18). “How vast is the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh!” he wrote,
in another context. “And yet, how poor, how inadequate our conception of
their significance and glory! This generation stands too close to so colos-
sal a Revelation to appreciate, in their full measure, the infinite possibili-
ties of His Faith, the unprecedented character of His Cause, and the mys-
terious dispensations of His Providence” (World Order 24). And, stressing

34            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 23. 1/4. 2013

the importance of obtaining a “clear conception of the exact purpose and
methods of this new world order, so challenging and complex, yet so con-
summate and wise,” he further explains,

> We are called upon by our beloved Master in His Will and Testament
> not only to adopt [the new world order] unreservedly, but to unveil
> its merit to all the world. To attempt to estimate its full value, and
> grasp its exact significance after so short a time since its inception
> would be premature and presumptuous on our part. We must trust to
> time, and the guidance of God’s Universal House of Justice, to obtain
> a clearer and fuller understanding of its provisions and implications.

(Bahá’í Administration 62)

Decades have passed since these statements were made. Only a few
years remain until the close of the first century of the Formative Age.
After almost a century of actual working, it is now possible to have much
greater insight into the implications of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament
and the unfoldment of Bahá’u’lláh’s new order that remained beyond the
grasp of the believers of an earlier age. These insights are significant not
simply for the perspective they offer on the past but also for understand-
ing the current efforts of the Bahá’í world, and they will continue to be
meaningful in shaping the course the Faith will trace in future centuries
throughout the Dispensation. Different individuals may well derive differ-
ent understandings from the experience of the past ninety-three years.
The following is a personal perspective only, touching on six critical
points.

THE COVENANT FROM A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
First among the concepts that can be better grasped by the current gen-
eration of believers is a historical perspective of the unfoldment of the pro-
visions of the Covenant. At any given time, the Bahá’í community has a
particular understanding of the Covenant based on the Sacred Text and
its authoritative interpretation as well as the experience of the communi-
ty. Because the outward form of the institutional arrangements pertaining
to the Covenant changed at certain points in history, most notably at the

Some Insights                           35

passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and of Shoghi Effendi, the believers at those
moments were challenged to reshape their prevalent assumptions and
understandings to accommodate realities, inherent in the Text, that they
had not anticipated or appreciated. For some this was a challenging task,
resulting, in extreme cases, in a loss of faith or even violation of the
Covenant. From the vantage of almost a century of actual working, how-
ever, a coherent picture of the provisions and safeguards of the Covenant
provided by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament has emerged.

When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá passed away in 1921, the Bahá’ís of the world,
shocked and saddened, had no clear idea what the future arrangements for
the Cause would be. Cognizant of the Universal House of Justice from the
Writings of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, many believers surely anticipat-
ed that it would soon be formed. Except for an awareness among a few,
there was no anticipation of the Guardianship or explicit understanding
of the future role of Shoghi Effendi (see, for example, Priceless Pearl 2–3);
even he later indicated that “he had no foreknowledge” of the position to
which he would be called (Priceless Pearl, 42).

Only after the reading of the Will and Testament, its translation, and
its wide circulation did the friends begin to understand this new institu-
tion. While the vast majority responded with firmness in the Covenant
and rallied to support the Guardian, others, beyond the group of old
Covenant breakers yet equally lost in the wilderness of their idle fancies
or personal ambitions, sought to raise questions, plant seeds of doubt and
confusion, pursue their own path, and attempt to incite open revolt. Such
challenges included questioning the authenticity of the Will and
Testament, attempting to ignore or supplant the Administrative Order ,
and endeavoring to undermine the Guardian’s authority.

Surveying the range of such attacks, Shoghi Effendi, in God Passes By,
notes the “strenuous exertions of an ambitious Armenian, who, in the
course of the first years of its establishment in Egypt, endeavored to sup-
plant it by the ‘Scientific Society,’” the “agitation provoked by a deluded
woman who strove diligently both in the United States and in England to
demonstrate the unauthenticity of the Charter responsible for its cre-
ation,” the “volumes which a shameless apostate composed and

36            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 23. 1/4. 2013

disseminated, during that same period in Persia, in his brazen efforts
not only to disrupt that Order but to undermine the very Faith which had
conceived it,” the “schemes devised by the remnants of the Covenant-
breakers,” and “the infamous and insidious machinations of a former sec-
retary of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá . . . to pervert the purpose and nullify the essential
provisions of the immortal Document from which that Order derives its
authority.” Yet, he concludes, none of the opponents who “misrepresented
its character, or derided and vilified it, or striven to arrest its march, or
contrived to create a breach in the ranks of it supporters, succeeded in
achieving their malevolent purpose” (God Passes By 327). In The Priceless
Pearl, Rúhíyyih Khánum describes these attacks and the toll they took on
the young Guardian:

> The entire life of the Guardian was plagued and blighted by the ambi-
> tion, the folly, the jealousy and hatred of individuals who rose up
> against the Cause and against him as Head of the Cause and who
> thought they could either subvert the Faith entirely or discredit its
> Guardian and set themselves up as leaders of a rival faction and win
> the body of believers over to their own interpretation of the
> Teachings and the way in which they believed the Cause of God
> should be run. No one ever succeeded in doing these things, but a
> series of disaffected individuals never ceased to try. The ringleaders
> misled the fools, the excommunicated tried to pervert the faithful.
> . . . Shoghi Effendi, particularly after reading the denunciation of the
> old Covenant-breakers in the Will of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, was prepared for
> their attacks, but the sudden stirring up of so much mischief and
> opposition in so unexpected a quarter left him shocked and greatly
> disturbed. I shall never forget how he looked when he called my
> mother and me to his bedroom, in 1923; we stood at the foot of his
> bed, were he lay, obviously prostrated and heart-broken, with great
> black shadows under his eyes, and he told us he could not stand it, he
> was going away. It must have been terribly difficult for such young a
> man to find himself the centre of so many attacks and to realize it
devolved upon him to exercise his right and perform his duty of

> excommunication in order to protect the Faith and keep the flock safe
> from the wolves prowling around it. (118–19)

Among his earliest responsibilities, Shoghi Effendi had to clarify and
defend the administrative order in general and the institution of the
Guardianship in particular. This task included an explanation of how the
existence of the Guardianship in no way infringed upon the authority and
prerogatives of the Universal House of Justice. He provided a number of
clarifications, especially within the letters compiled in The World Order of
Bahá’u’lláh (including pages 8–9, 16–25, 143–57).

The Bahá’í Writings do not suggest that misguided individuals will not
attempt to create sects or divisions in the Faith; such efforts have repeat-
edly been made throughout its history. What the Writings do state is that,
because of a firm and explicit Covenant, such attempts will ultimately fail
(Messages to America 50). By the end of Shoghi Effendi’s ministry, the
attacks were refuted, and the validity of the administration and impor-
tance of the Guardianship were well understood by the entire body of
believers. However, another shock and challenge to their understanding
came when Shoghi Effendi passed away without the appointment of a suc-
cessor. How, some wondered, was it possible for the line of Guardians to
come to an end? How could the Faith continue without a Guardian? Thus,
in 1921, the friends had no idea there would be a Guardian, expecting the
House of Justice alone to guide the Faith, and they had to be patiently edu-
cated about the Guardianship in the face of attacks against it. Only 36
years later, in 1957, the friends had to learn to accept that there would no
longer be a Guardian and to understand how, even without a Guardian,
the Universal House of Justice was fully empowered to guide the affairs of
the Cause to unfailingly achieve Bahá’u’lláh’s purpose. The experience and
expectations of the Bahá’í community in 1921 were reversed, and then
reversed again in 1957.

As in 1921, the years following the passing of the Guardian witnessed
misunderstandings of the believers as well as attacks by some on the pro-
visions of the Covenant and on the Centre of the Faith—this time on the
authority of the Universal House of Justice. A handful of susceptible individuals

38            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 23. 1/4. 2013

were swept away in the tide of their personal imaginings, yet ultimately
the result was a greater clarity and firmer ties to the Covenant among the
mass of believers. Ironically, whereas after the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
problematic individuals complained about the existence of the
Guardianship and sought the immediate formation of the House of Justice,
after the passing of Shoghi Effendi, problematic individuals complained
that there was no longer a Guardian and sought to undermine the author-
ity of the House of Justice. Just as the Guardian did at the start of his min-
istry, the House of Justice after its establishment in 1963 began to clarify
the understanding of the friends and help them grasp the implications of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament. A series of letters gradually elucidat-
ed a range of questions, especially messages of the House of Justice dated
6 October 1963, 9 March 1965, 27 May 1966, 7 December 1969, and most
recently, 18 February 2008. The House of Justice explained that it found
“that there is no way to appoint or to legislate to make it possible to
appoint a second Guardian to succeed Shoghi Effendi” (Messages par. 5.1);
yet, “the mighty Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh remains impregnable” (Messages
par. 75.14), and “the House of Justice is in a position to do everything nec-
essary to establish the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh on this earth” (Messages
par. 23.20).

Now, many years after these two dramatic events that deeply affected
the understanding of the friends, the provisions of the Covenant can be
seen in a clearer light. The House of Justice has stated, “An attentive read-
ing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will makes it clear that He did not indicate a predes-
tined outcome but did provide for a number of circumstances which,
depending on future conditions, might eventually confront the Faith” (18
Feb. 2008). It has further explained that in the early 1900s, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
life was in jeopardy, and provision was made for the possibility that the
House of Justice might be formed while Shoghi Effendi was but a boy and
could not yet fulfill the duties of the Guardian. If such a situation had
unfolded, the House of Justice would have functioned initially after the
passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá without a Guardian. When Shoghi Effendi
assumed his responsibilities as Guardian, he initially, although only briefly,
considered establishing the House of Justice. If conditions had made it

Some Insights                            39

possible to establish it in his lifetime, or if conditions had allowed for him
to appoint a successor according to the specific criteria laid down by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Will, then the Guardian and the House of Justice
would have functioned simultaneously. Furthermore, the Text holds no
guarantee that the line of Guardians would continue throughout the
Dispensation. As historical circumstances actually unfolded, the line of
Guardians did come to an end before the formation of the House of Justice.

In one of His Tablets, Bahá’u’lláh asks a question central to every soul
that professes belief: “Where shalt thou secure the cord of thy faith and
fasten the tie of thine obedience?” (Gems 13). After nearly a century in
which the provisions of the Will and Testament were put to the test—
including two events, the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the passing of
Shoghi Effendi, that radically challenged the understanding of the believ-
ers—the answer is evident and will stand over the course of the
Dispensation. For Bahá’ís there are two centers of authority: the Book,
with its body of authoritative interpretation, and the guidance of the
House of Justice. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains, “Unto the Most Holy Book
every one must turn and all that is not expressly recorded therein must be
referred to the Universal House of Justice. That which this body, whether
unanimously or by a majority doth carry, that is verily the truth and the
purpose of God Himself ” (Will and Testament 39–40).

THE RANGE OF AUTHORITY AND POWERS

OF THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE
Another concept pertaining to the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
that can be more fully grasped by the current generation of believers is the
range of authority and powers of the Universal House of Justice. In his
writings, Shoghi Effendi makes a number of statements that define certain
types of specific decisions that are left to the House of Justice. For exam-
ple, the House of Justice will determine whether National Assemblies will
continue to be elected on an annual basis, describe details concerning the
use of birth control, and address questions associated with the implemen-
tation of the Bahá’í calendar, such as specifying the observance of the twin
festivals marking the births of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. Yet, there are also

40            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 23. 1/4. 2013

emphatic and far-reaching statements by the Guardian that describe its
authority and powers in a broad manner.

The function of the House of Justice, Shoghi Effendi explains, “is to lay
more definitely the broad lines that must guide the future activities and
administration of the Movement” (Bahá’í Administration 63). It “will guide,
organize and unify the affairs of the Movement throughout the world”
(Bahá’í Administration 39), and it will share, in common with the Guardian,
the responsibilities “to insure the continuity of that divinely-appointed
authority which flows from the Source of our Faith, to safeguard the unity
of its followers and to maintain the integrity and flexibility of its teach-
ings” (World Order 148). When established, the House of Justice will “con-
sider afresh the whole situation, and lay down the principle which shall
direct, so long as it deems advisable, the affairs of the Cause” (Bahá’í
Administration 41), and it will launch in the Formative Age, as part of the
execution of the Divine Plan, “world-wide enterprises . . . that will sym-
bolize the unity and co-ordinate and unify the activities of these National
Assemblies” (qtd. in Compilations 1 340). He adds, “[I]t will lay down new
methods, establish a firm and inviolable Constitution and will initiate com-
prehensive projects and undertakings. Then all the meetings of the
friends, be they private or public, local or national, will come under its
shadow, deriving inspiration from it and will be sustained by it.”1 “When
this most great edifice shall be reared on such an immovable foundation,”
the Guardian states, “God’s purpose, wisdom, universal truths, mysteries
and realities of the Kingdom, which the mystic Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh
has deposited within The Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, shall grad-
ually be revealed and made manifest” (qtd. in Bahá’í World 436). And, in
addition,

> When the Universal House of Justice shall have stepped forth from
> the realm of hope into that of visible fulfillment and its fame be

The range of authority and powers granted to the House of Justice are
summarized more fully in the preamble to its constitution. The House of
Justice does not merely act within the context of a fixed administrative
structure laid out by the Guardian. Indeed, for many issues that arose dur-
ing his ministry, Shoghi Effendi, in order to meet the pressing concerns of
the moment, either enacted a temporary measure to address a situation or
permitted National Assemblies to take a preliminary decision. This course
of action was continued until such time as the House of Justice could
address the matter, which means to apply the Teachings, guide the contin-
uing evolution of the administrative order, and direct the unfoldment of
the Faith through the stages of the Divine Plan.

An example of authority of the House of Justice in guiding the admin-
istration and the direction of the Divine Plan can be found in the evolu-
tion of the institution of the learned and in the collaboration of the two
arms of the administrative order2, especially in relation to the propagation
of the Faith. Shoghi Effendi did not appoint living Hands of the Cause of
God until 1951, and thus, the institution of the learned had only been
functioning actively for some six years before his untimely passing.
Indeed, an important element of that institution, the Auxiliary Boards for

nates an elected branch, which He terms “the rulers,” as having legislative and
executive authority, and an appointed branch, which He terms “the learned in
Bahá,” as functioning in the role of advisors to the various institutions.

42            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 23. 1/4. 2013

protection, was created only a matter of days before that tragic event. By
comparison, Shoghi Effendi had discussed the importance and responsibil-
ities of Local and National Assemblies and had guided the friends in their
operation for over thirty-six years.

Obviously, much more was said about the functioning of Assemblies and
much less about the functioning of the Hands of the Cause and the
Auxiliary Boards. Therefore, the task has fallen to the House of Justice to
fully describe the function of this arm of the administration. Additionally,
the House of Justice established the International Teaching Centre and
Boards of Counsellors to carry forward the work of the Hands into the
future, defined in detail their role in the administrative order, and
explained how the two arms interact and collaborate. Much of this infor-
mation is summarized in The Institution of the Counsellors.

In more recent years, the House of Justice further clarified the duties of
these standard-bearers of the teaching work in the unfoldment of the
Divine Plan. The responsibilities of National and Local Assemblies have
similarly evolved and grown in complexity in recent years under the
direction of the House of Justice. New institutional arrangements to guide
a new approach to the teaching work have been created—including
Regional Bahá’í Councils, training institutes, and agencies at the cluster
level—which operate under the direction of National Assemblies, in close
collaboration with the Counsellors, and which require careful attention for
their sound development and integration with the Assemblies’ other lines
of action. And, where communities are growing, Local Assemblies find
themselves drawn into greater responsibilities for the progress of the Plan
and into the affairs of the wider community, as discussed in the letter of
the House of Justice dated 28 December 2010.

At any given historical moment, then, there may be a certain idea about
the way Assemblies function, or about how the Counsellors and their
Auxiliaries are to operate. Outwardly, it may even appear that there is
some variance in guidance set forth by Shoghi Effendi. Yet, it is the duty
of the House of Justice to progressively define these roles; any change it
institutes is a necessary part of evolution and organic development, and an
indication of the Faith’s flexibility and growing capacity. The guidance

of the House of Justice is a further clarification of the administrative order,
suited to the needs of the time in order to achieve the aims of the Faith.
Such changes are a movement toward, not away from, true Bahá’í admin-
istrative practice. The believers were instructed by the Guardian to “trust
to time, and the guidance of God’s Universal House of Justice” (Bahá’í
Administration 62) to ensure the unfoldment of the potentialities of the
new order enshrined in the Will and Testament.

Since the establishment of the Universal House of Justice in 1963, a
number of challenges to its authority have followed a pattern similar to
the challenges directed against the Guardianship, whether in attempting
to usurp its authority by baseless claims to leadership or in trying to
undermine its authority by imposing personal views about the aims and
purpose of the Faith or the meaning of the Teachings. Such challenges
have arisen through the acts of the avowed enemies of the Faith and by
Covenant breakers, but also by those who profess to be faithful, while hid-
ing their true motives, and even, to an extent, through the unwise acts of
the believers themselves.

Of course, a sharp distinction must be drawn between the honest
inquiry of a soul seeking to understand the Teachings and the heedless
individual who knows the Teachings well but is determined, for personal
motives, to obscure the truth. Nevertheless, just as in earlier stages of
development, the friends must continue to guard themselves and the Faith
from spurious assertions that are made in an attempt to divide or damage
the community or to force it to change in a manner that accords with the
speakers’ personal views. For example, in attempting to confuse or con-
vince those investigating the Faith or those believers who have a limited
grasp of the provisions of the Covenant, some individuals circulated asser-
tions and whisperings from time to time that the House of Justice was not
properly established, that it does not have sufficient knowledge to formu-
late its decisions, that its decisions merely represent the personal views of
particular members, or that the House of Justice is moving the Faith in the
wrong direction. Others have suggested that, without a Guardian, the
decisions of the House of Justice may be called into question, that elucida-
tions of the House of Justice on matters addressed in the Text are mere

44             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 23. 1/4. 2013

opinion, and that all matters pertaining to the meaning of the Teachings
are left to debate or to determination by learned individuals. All such false
charges and misrepresentations directly contradict the explicit guidance
and assurances set forth in numerous unambiguous passages of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, such as the following:

At whatever time all the beloved of God in each country appoint
> their delegates, and these in turn elect their representatives, and these
> representatives elect a body, that body shall be regarded as the
> Supreme House of Justice. . . . That is all. (qtd. in Messages par.

More than ninety years after the Will and Testament was disseminat-
ed, the Bahá’í world is now able to have a much greater understanding of
the provisions of the Covenant and the authority and powers exercised by
the Universal House of Justice. “Thus it is seen that no means for dissen-
sion hath been left, but carnal desires are the cause of difference,” ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá warns (Selections 187.3). In establishing the Covenant, stipulating the
formation of the House of Justice, and assigning it certain powers and
responsibilities, and in the emphatic and absolute language in which this
was done, Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá intended to close all doors to dif-
ferences and dissention; to prevent protracted disputes on matters of the-
ology, doctrine, practice, and purposeful direction that divided previous
religions; and to ensure that Bahá’ís remain united in thought and action
as they learn how to translate the Teachings into reality to build a new
world that is the central objective of this Dispensation. “For nothing short
of the explicit directions of their Book, and the surprisingly emphatic lan-
guage with which they have clothed the provisions of their Will, could

46            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 23. 1/4. 2013

possibly safeguard the Faith for which they have both so gloriously
labored all their lives,” Shoghi Effendi explains. “Nothing short of this
could protect it from the heresies and calumnies with which denomina-
tions, peoples, and governments have endeavored, and will, with increas-
ing vigor, endeavor to assail it in future” (World Order 22).

LEARNING WITHIN AN EVOLVING FRAMEWORK FOR ACTION
Within this perspective on the Covenant, it is also possible at this time to
better understand the efforts of the believers as they strive to translate
Bahá’u’lláh’s Teachings into action in an ever more systematic way. In the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh are various concepts, principles, laws, and exhor-
tations that address the ills that afflict individuals and society. The
Manifestation of God innately understands the condition of humanity and
its potentiality and limitations, and, as the Divine Physician, He prescribes
a healing remedy in His Teachings. However, if those Teachings remain
merely as written exhortations in a book—if the remedy is not applied—
then humanity will not be transformed. There must be a systematic effort,
a type of practice and method in which the believers are engaged so that
they come to understand what is in the Sacred Text and gradually trans-
late that understanding into reality and action.

Individuals, in the course of their own lives, engage in such an effort as
they read the Writings, study the laws and exhortations of Bahá’u’lláh, try
to live a Bahá’í life, and bring themselves to account by reflecting on their
behavior each day so that, after prayer and reflection, they can try to make
the necessary changes to improve their character and make tomorrow bet-
ter than today. A similar effort is expressed through the collective enter-
prise that involves the raising of the administrative order and the execu-
tion of the Divine Plan. This process is accomplished through application
of the learning process described by the House of Justice that involve
study of the relevant guidance, consultation, action, and reflection on
action over time.

Such an approach to learning about the collective efforts of the commu-
nity began under the direction of Shoghi Effendi, although the believers
may not have been fully conscious that they were engaged in a learning process.

The first area addressed was the understanding and practice of the administra-
tion; the Guardian set forth the principles and encouraged the friends to
act. Over time, mistakes were made, and progress was often delayed or dis-
rupted. Questions arose about innumerable facets of the administration,
such as the procedures for elections and the matter of nominations, the
nature of the national convention and whether it should be a standing con-
sultative body, the relationship between the individual and the Assemblies,
and the association between the National and Local Assemblies. Each time
the Guardian provided the necessary guidance, the friends refined their
efforts, capacity grew, and challenges were resolved. The long-term result
was an increase in levels of development in the administrative field and the
opening of new horizons for progress but also, in turn, new questions and
challenges.

Another major area of endeavor that unfolded through a process of
learning during the ministry of Shoghi Effendi was the creation and exe-
cution of Plans, first national and then global, but all of which were
aspects of the Divine Plan set forth by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Once the basis for the
administrative machinery of the Faith was in place—the instrument
intended for the propagation of the Cause—Shoghi Effendi encouraged
the friends in North America to create a “systematic, carefully conceived,
and well-established plan” to be “devised, rigorously pursued and contin-
uously extended” (Messages to America 7). Finally, in 1937, the Seven Year
Plan was initiated.

In subsequent years, other national communities, as they reached a
stage of maturity, were able to adopt their own national plan. Eventually,
as a result of this learning process, the twelve communities with National
Assemblies were able to unite, in 1953, in a single global plan, the Ten
Year World Crusade. By learning to use the instrument of the administra-
tion to act in a united and systematic manner in the collective execution
of the Plan, the Bahá’í world was able to achieve more progress in the
work of expansion and consolidation of the Faith during that decade than
it had in the previous 109 years combined.

In a letter written on his behalf, the Guardian summarized the strug-
gles of the believers over many years and in different countries to build the

48            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 23. 1/4. 2013

administration and expand the Faith:

> One of the main reasons why the Faith does not advance more rapid-
> ly is because the friends have not learned to live with, and work with-
> in the framework of the Administrative Order. Either they crystallize
> it into too set a form, or they rebel against what they feel to be a
> System, and do not give it sufficient support. Both of these extremes
> impede the progress of the Faith, and the efficiency of the believers.

(Divine Guidance 185)

Shoghi Effendi’s introduction of the concept of a framework helps clarify
how the complex objectives that must be addressed to enable the Faith to
grow, to attend the ills of humanity, to raise the nucleus and pattern of a
new world order, and to contribute to the emergence a spiritual civiliza-
tion all require more than implementing a formulaic approach or merely
insisting upon a single action. Nor can the friends set aside Bahá’u’lláh’s
divine system simply because some aspect of the Teachings conflicts with
their own strong inclinations or convictions. A number of concepts and
practices, laws and exhortations, spiritual qualities and principles, and
methods and instruments must be employed, over time, in various ways,
in different combinations, in diverse contexts, across changing conditions,
within organic developmental stages—all to be integrated in a coherent
manner. Learning, as described by the House of Justice, is the process of
discovering through experience the approaches to putting the full range
of these concepts into practical and systematic action.

Thus, whether or not the friends were aware of it, the current process
of study, consultation, action, and reflection has been part of the efforts of
the believers from the start of the Formative Age. Since 1996, the House
of Justice has encouraged individuals, communities, and institutions to
consciously engage in this learning process and to make their efforts more
systematic. At the start of the Four Year Plan, it observed the need for the
“active supporters of the Faith in each region” to “identify the approaches
and methods applicable to their specific conditions and to set in motion a
systematic process of community development. This process should be

one in which the friends review their successes and difficulties, adjust and
improve their methods accordingly, and learn, and move forward unhesi-
tatingly” (Turning Point par. 1.23). By the end of that Plan, the House of
Justice stated,

> The culture of the Bahá’í community experienced a change. This
> change is noticeable in the expanded capability, the methodical pat-
> tern of functioning and the consequent depth of confidence of the
> three constituent participants in the Plan—the individual, the insti-
> tutions and the local community. That is so because the friends con-
> cerned themselves more consistently with deepening their knowledge
> of the divine Teachings and learned much—and this more systemat-
> ically than before—about how to apply them to promulgating the
> Cause, to managing their individual and collective activities, and to
> working with their neighbors. In a word, they entered into a learning
> mode from which purposeful action was pursued. (Turning Point par.

21.2)

By 2008, “thousands upon thousands” were “engaged in systematic study
of the Creative Word in an environment that is at once serious and uplift-
ing” and, as they endeavored “to apply through a process of action, reflec-
tion and consultation the insights thus gained, they see their capacity to
serve the Cause rise to new levels” (Ridván 2008). “For those who are
actively participating in the process described,” a letter written on behalf
of the House of Justice explains, “it becomes readily apparent that, far
from being an attempt to impose uniformity, the framework for action
serves as a creative matrix, shaping an environment that is fostering sig-
nificant growth” (20 July 2009).

As the series of Plans since 1996 have unfolded, it has become increas-
ingly evident how the understanding of the Covenant, the broad range of
the powers and capacities of the House of Justice, and the learning process
in which individuals, communities, and institutions are engaged come
together in the unfoldment of the Faith through various stages over time.
For example, the concept of the institute has its roots in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s

50            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 23. 1/4. 2013

emphasis on the systematic training of teachers of the Faith. It emerged
in various forms after the Ten Year Crusade—as the friends in different
parts of the world experienced large-scale growth—in an effort to balance
expansion and consolidation permanent institutes, weekend institutes, and
teaching institutes were established. It took its present form from the
guidance of the House and experience in the world since 1996. The devel-
opment of the current curriculum, which combines study and action to
help develop human resources for participation in the work of expansion
and consolidation, is also shaped by a process of learning; the intent is nei-
ther a mere deepening program nor an exhaustive study of the Revelation,
although it does lay the foundation for a lifelong exploration of the Word
of God by the believers.

In the Four Year Plan (1996-2000), training institutes worldwide creat-
ed or adopted their own courses, until, as a result of experience and
because of certain practical advantages, the House of Justice called for
institutes everywhere to adopt the books of the Ruhi Institute in 2005, “at
least through the final years of the first century of the Formative Age”
(Turning Point par. 36.4). Since that time, the evolution of the materials has
advanced significantly. No longer are there simply a few books designed
for the advancement of the Faith in Colombia, but a substantial curricu-
lum created through an intensive process of learning in all parts of the
world that produced the majority of the content of the children’s classes,
the materials for junior youth, and the sequence of courses after Book
Four. Doubtless the institute and its curriculum will continue to evolve,
both in content and form, to a level of greater complexity in regions and
nations within the framework of the administrative order throughout the
various stages of the Divine Plan in the second century of the Formative
Age.

Another example of the learning process is the emergence of intensive
programs of growth. At the beginning of the first of the series of Five
Year Plans in 2001, it was not possible to describe the features of an inten-
sive program of growth. But based on the previous experience of Bahá’í
communities in the teaching field, the House of Justice described certain
prerequisites, characteristics, and principles that constitute such a program

and then encouraged the friends to translate those concepts into practical
action. By Ridván 2004, the Bahá’í world, through its efforts to put into
practice the precepts of the Plan and revise and improve their action
though reflection on experience, was just beginning to see the first stir-
rings of intensive programs of growth in a few clusters.

Since then, work toward the establishment of programs of growth has
expanded to more than three thousand clusters, with some fifteen hundred
reaching an intensive level. Scores of additional clusters have advanced
even further to the point where a vibrant pattern of community life has
been created, in which hundreds are supporting the participation of thou-
sands, as illustrated in the video Frontiers of Learning. Such endeavors are
described more fully in the document of the International Teaching
Centre titled Insights from the Frontiers of Learning.

What began with an effort to learn about the development of capacity
for participation in the teaching work and the establishment of a few core
activities has become a complex pattern of growth and community-build-
ing that is unfolding within an evolving framework for action that
embraces an array of concepts, methods, instruments, activities, approach-
es, practices, and institutional arrangements. A letter written on behalf of
the House of Justice summarizes the effort:

> The four core activities are but the nucleus of an organic pattern of
> life that, as the number of individuals who can initiate activities mul-
> tiplies, increases in complexity over time, eventually requiring coher-
> ence among a range of efforts that also includes visits to homes, social
> gatherings, Feast and Holy Day observances, deepenings, administra-
> tion, strengthening the Fund, social action, involvement in the dis-
> courses of society, and so on. All these activities are sustained and
> expanded by the constant endeavors of individuals to reach out to
> their personal contacts as well as to receptive populations through
> direct teaching, both personal and collective, and engagement in
> meaningful conversations. The process of building growing commu-
> nities is cultivated within three-monthly cycles of planning and
> action, and it is supported by institutional arrangements at the local,
> cluster, regional, national, and international levels. (17 February 2014)
52            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 23. 1/4. 2013

Of course, while the endeavor in certain clusters has advanced, in oth-
ers it has struggled. In some, a once vibrant pattern of activity has dimin-
ished, and in almost ten thousand clusters in the world, no Bahá’ís yet
reside. In still others, the friends were unable to avoid a tendency either to
“crystallize” the guidance into “too set a form” or “rebel against what they
feel to be a System” and fail to “give it sufficient support”—the persistent
challenge identified by the Guardian in an earlier age. In such instances,
however, just as in the past when believers were learning about the frame-
work of the administration, there is no alternative but to better under-
stand the concepts and provisions of the framework for action of the Plan
and to strive to implement them more effectively. After all, the framework
itself also evolves, through guidance provided by the House of Justice and
the experience of the friends, and it contains within it the necessary ele-
ments for the believers at the local and cluster levels to reflect upon and
revise their actions to resolve practical problems that appear.

Much remains to be done. Yet, the learning process, practically invisi-
ble during the ministry of Shoghi Effendi, has become a conscious and dis-
tinguishing feature of the systematic work of individuals, communities,
and institutions worldwide.

ORGANIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Yet another aspect of the Faith that can be grasped more fully as the close
of the first century of the Formative Age approaches is the nature and pat-
tern of the organic growth and development of the Bahá’í community.
Shoghi Effendi refers to the community’s organic development and to its
organic life, which reflects the characteristics it shares with the unfold-
ment of a living organism and with the coherent, integrated, and harmo-
nious nature of its component parts. He speaks of the “the internal func-
tions of the organic Bahá’í community” (God Passes By 339), explaining
that its “embryonic state, shall evolve within the shell of His law, and shall
forge ahead, undivided and unimpaired, till it embraces the whole of
mankind” (World Order 23). The progress of national communities is pro-
pelled by “prosecuting specific Plans designed to foster their organic
development” (Messages to Canada 29). “Such close interaction, such

complete cohesion, such continual harmony and fellowship between the
various agencies that contribute to the organic life, and constitute the
basic framework, of every properly functioning Bahá’í community,” he
states, “is a phenomenon which offers a striking contrast to the disruptive
tendencies which the discordant elements of present-day society so tragi-
cally manifest” (Advent 1). And in one of its earliest messages, the
Universal House of Justice writes,

> In the human body, every cell, every organ, every nerve has its part
> to play. When all do so the body is healthy, vigorous, radiant, ready
> for every call made upon it. No cell, however humble, lives apart from
> the body, whether in serving it or receiving from it. This is true of the
> body of mankind in which God “hast endowed each and all with tal-
> ents and faculties,” and is supremely true of the body of the Bahá’í
> World Community, for this body is already an organism, united in its
> aspirations, unified in its methods, seeking assistance and confirma-
> tion from the same Source, and illumined with the conscious knowl-
> edge of its unity. . . . The Bahá’í World Community, growing like a
> healthy new body, develops new cells, new organs, new functions and
> powers as it presses on to its maturity, when every soul, living for the
> Cause of God, will receive from that Cause, health, assurance and the
> overflowing bounties of Bahá’u’lláh which are diffused through His
> divinely ordained order. (Messages par. 19.4)

Among the characteristics of organic development are growth, differen-
tiation, integration, evolution, developmental stages, complexity, internal
coherence, maturation, and the dynamic engagement of an organism with
its environment. For example, a human being is a very complex organism
with significant and far-reaching capacities to understand and act in the
world. But a person begins very simply, with a single cell and a single
focus—cell division. A single cell obviously cannot act to be at the same
time a brain, a kidney, a liver, skin, hair, and everything else. It cannot go
off to university, get a degree in economics, and solve the economic prob-
lems of the world. Only over time does the organic process unfold and the

54            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 23. 1/4. 2013

human organism begins to take on a more complex form and capacity.
Cells multiply, then gradually there is differentiation and specialization,
different organs appear and then different systems, until finally a baby
emerges from the protective womb. Even this significant transition is but
a beginning for new stages in the organic process that result in continu-
ing physical, mental, and social development. The individual passes
through infancy to childhood to adolescence and beyond until the mature
human being emerges who, indeed, can go to college, get that degree, and
tackle the economic problems of the world.

The characteristics of organic development are similarly found in the
unfoldment of the Faith, in the progressive stages of the establishment of
the administration and implementation of the Divine Plan. One need only
trace the path from the birth of the Bahá’í Era, at the time of the fateful
evening encounter between the Báb and the first believer, to the initial
capacities for administration and teaching in the first years after the pass-
ing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, to the far flung and complex global community and
its capabilities evident in the harvest of the fruits of the Ten Year Crusade,
and to its current size, scope, capabilities, and influence as the first centu-
ry of the Formative Age draws to a close. The past century has witnessed
a series of developmental stages beginning in 1921, from the initial efforts
to establish the system of Local and National Assemblies, to the adoption
of the first plans to spread the Faith throughout the world from 1937 on,
to the start of the focused development of the international sphere in
1950, to the establishment of the House of Justice and implementation of
initial plans beginning in 1963, and to the current systematic approach to
learning about growth and development initiated in 1996.

However, one should not think that organic development is impervious
to intervention—that change is completely fixed and moves at its own
pace. A knowledgeable farmer or agriculturalist, while serving the inher-
ent organic characteristics of a plant and subject to the limitations of
nature, can have a direct effect on the outcome of the harvest and even on
plant genetics. The capacity of the parent and teacher leaves an indelible
mark on the rate and extent of the progress of a child, who thrives from
the optimum union of nurture and nature.

Of course, one critical difference between biological organic develop-
ment and social organic development is that, in the former, the process is
intrinsic and, within a range of material conditions, involuntary; in the lat-
ter, there is choice. The individual, possessing free will, must decide to act.
The twin duties of recognition of the Manifestation of God and adherence
to all that He revealed create the deontological commitment to the organ-
ic processes of the Faith. Individuals, communities, and institutions, as the
House of Justice has repeatedly explained in recent years, are to become
increasingly conscious of, and capable of acting within, the parameters of
the Faith’s organic process of growth and development in order to con-
tribute to its efficient and effective progress.

Nevertheless, these stages of development take shape under the guid-
ance of the Universal House of Justice. As the Guardian writes, “‘God will
verily inspire them with whatsoever He willeth,’ is Bahá’u’lláh’s incontro-
vertible assurance. They, and not the body of those who either directly or
indirectly elect them, have thus been made the recipients of the divine
guidance which is at once the life-blood and ultimate safeguard of this
Revelation” (World Order 153). The friends, confident in the source of this
guidance, are united in a collective enterprise, and each can find a part to
play in bringing the potentialities of the Plan into reality.

An example of how the organic process continues to unfold under the
direction of the House of Justice is found in the effort, extending more
than a half-century, to accelerate the process of growth by learning to
achieve a balance between expansion and consolidation. In outlining the
stages through which the Faith would grow, the Guardian describes “a
steady flow of reinforcements” that would “presage and hasten the advent
of the day which, as prophesied by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, will witness the entry by
troops of peoples of divers nations and races into the Bahá’í world,” a
process that, in turn, would be a “prelude to that long-awaited hour” of a
“a mass conversion on the part of these same nations and races” (Citadel
117).

The stage of entry by troops began during the ministry of Shoghi
Effendi, when in various countries in Africa, individuals began to embrace
the Faith by scores, then hundreds; the process spread to other countries

56            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 23. 1/4. 2013

and grew to thousands and tens of thousands. The main challenge that
immediately presented itself was how to ensure that the process of consol-
idation could keep pace with expansion so new believers could be deep-
ened and begin to serve, children and youth could be educated, Assemblies
could be formed, administrative processes could become well established,
the pattern of community life might flourish, and teaching could contin-
ue.

Some years earlier the Guardian emphasized that the community must
“maintain a proper balance between these two essential aspects of its
development.” “Every outward thrust into new fields,” he writes, “every
multiplication of Bahá’í institutions, must be paralleled by a deeper thrust
of the roots which sustain the spiritual life of the community and ensure
its sound development” (Antipodes 246). Soon after its establishment, the
House of Justice in its first Plan, the Nine Year Plan, emphasized the same
critical task, observing that “[e]xpansion and consolidation are twin
processes that must go hand in hand” (Messages par. 18.6).

The struggle to achieve this elusive balance, upon which the ability to
sustain large-scale growth depends, continued over five Plans and three
decades until 1996. By that time, two patterns of growth and development
within local communities were fairly evident in the Bahá’í world. One con-
sisted of small but well-established communities, generally inward look-
ing, with most activities organized for the believers themselves. The sec-
ond consisted of campaigns of teaching among receptive populations and
resulted in the enrollment of large numbers, with a constant struggle to
find effective methods to deepen and build community among more than
a small number of individuals.

At the start of the Four Year Plan, therefore, the House of Justice
focused the community on learning to become more systematic in its
approach to expansion and consolidation, thereby requiring a different
mode of functioning and a different way of thinking about capacity build-
ing. By 2005, the House of Justice observed, “Persistent questions of how
to sustain the process of growth, of how to achieve a balance between
expansion and consolidation, that have engaged the Bahá’í community for
nearly half a century found clear answers in the experiences shared from

diverse clusters on all continents” (Turning Point par. 37.2). Although
there is still much to be learned, there are now nearly two hundred clus-
ters in the world where a hundred or more capable individuals are able to
engage the ever-increasing participation of some thousand and more in a
vibrant, expanding pattern of community life.

Another example of the organic nature of the development of the Cause
is evident in the emergence of the Mashriqu’l-Adhkár.3 This distinctive
edifice or institution in Bahá’u’lláh’s vision for community life is centered
on the essentials of collective worship and service to humanity that are
vital to the world’s regeneration. The establishment of the first House of
Worship in ‘Ishqábád in the early 1900s inspired a similar project by the
Bahá’ís of North America, which was eventually followed by the establish-
ment of additional continental temples in Uganda, Australia, Germany,
Panama, Samoa, and India, and a final one soon to be completed in Chile.

The concept of the Mashriqu’l-Adhkár, however, is not confined only to
formal structures but extends to collective worship for all Bahá’í commu-
nities. “The Mashriqu’l-Adhkár is of great import,” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes;
“At least once per week, it should become the gathering-place of the cho-
sen friends who have discovered the secrets and become the intimates of
mysteries. It may assume any form, for even if it be an underground pit,
that pit shall become even as a sheltering paradise, an exalted meadow,
and a garden of delight.”4 Thus, the effort of constructing formal Houses
of Worship at the continental level has been complemented by a much
broader effort in local communities worldwide. This grassroots endeavor
has accelerated in the recent series of Plans by multiplying devotional
gatherings, open to all, as an integral part of the community-building
process. The aim is to bring collective devotional life to every Bahá’í and
to as many people from the wider society as possible by carrying out “acts

3. Mashriqu’l-Adhkár is an Arabic term meaning roughly “Dawning-place of
the worship of God.” More generally referred to as a Bahá’í House of Worship, the
Mashriqu’l-Adhkár is open to people of all religions.

of collective worship in diverse settings, uniting with others in prayer,
awakening spiritual susceptibilities, and shaping a pattern of life distin-
guished for its devotional character” (Ridván 2008).

These two thrusts, a top-down and bottom-up approach for the devel-
opment of collective worship, unfolding for more than a century, are now
becoming entwined in a new stage of organic development. At Ridván
2001, the House of Justice stated that a “feature of the Fifth Epoch will be
the enrichment of the devotional life of the community through the rais-
ing up of national Houses of Worship, as circumstances in national com-
munities permit” and “in relation to the advancement of the process of
entry by troops within countries” that “will unfold throughout successive
stages of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan” (Turning Point par. 25.9). In the
2012 Ridván message, the House of Justice announced that two national
Mashriqu’l-Adhkár were to be built along with local temples in five clus-
ters across the world.

This course of action will open far-reaching possibilities for learning
about how the elements of worship and service so eloquently described by
Shoghi Effendi will combine to shape the spiritual and material life of
humanity: “For it is assuredly upon the consciousness of the efficacy of the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, reinforced on one hand by spiritual communion
with His Spirit, and on the other by the intelligent application and the
faithful execution of the principles and laws He revealed, that the salva-
tion of a world in travail must ultimately depend” (Bahá’í Administration
186).

RELATIONSHIPS AMONG INDIVIDUALS,

COMMUNITIES, AND INSTITUTIONS
The Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the charter “which called into
being, outlined the features and set in motion the processes” of the admin-
istrative order (God Passes By 325), introduced potentialities for reorder-
ing the relationships among individuals, communities, and institutions
that are now increasingly evident as the Cause progresses. In past ages,
different societies and political ideologies have had various conceptions of
these entities and their relationships. Bahá’u’lláh’s new world order, based

on the principle of the oneness of humanity, will emerge as individuals,
communities, and institutions learn how to collaborate and interact
according to new laws and ordinances, using new approaches, methods,
and instruments, in an evolving process that will take humankind from an
age of adolescence to an age of maturity. As the processes of learning and
organic development previously discussed unfold within the Faith, these
relationships will take shape; will become more effective, powerful, and
distinctive; and will evolve until they reflect Bahá’u’lláh’s intended pur-
pose for society. The House of Justice has explained that the “relationships
that bind” these three protagonists “are undergoing profound transforma-
tion, bringing into the realm of existence civilization-building powers
which can only be released through conformity with His decree” (28
December 2010).

In introducing the administration at the start of the Formative Age,
Shoghi Effendi had to assist the friends to overcome their misunderstand-
ings and misgivings and to grasp and put into practice its precepts.
Because numbers were small and the concept of administration was new,
the initial focus was naturally on the relationship between individuals and
institutions. Numerous passages from Shoghi Effendi and letters written
on his behalf reflect the struggle by individuals and nascent institutions to
learn to cooperate in implementing the most rudimentary elements of the
administration.

He explains, “The Guardian feels very strongly that everywhere,
throughout the entire Bahá’í world, the believers have got to master and
follow the principles of their divinely laid down Administrative Order.
They will never solve their problems by departing from the correct pro-
cedure” (Dawn 129). “The Local Assemblies should inspire confidence in
the individual believers, and these in their turn should express their readi-
ness to fully abide by the decisions and directions of the Local Assembly,”
a letter written on his behalf explains. “The two must learn to co-operate,
and to realize that only through such a cooperation can the institutions of
the Cause effectively and permanently function” (qtd. in Compilations 2
254). “The Bahá’ís,” another letter cautions, “must learn to forget person-
alities and to overcome the desire—so natural in people—to take sides and

60            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 23. 1/4. 2013

fight about it” (Divine Guidance 152). Individuals are “fully entitled to
address criticisms to their Assemblies; they can freely air their views
about policies or individual members of elected bodies to the Assembly,
local or national, but then they must whole-heartedly accept the advice or
decision of the Assembly, according to the principles already laid down for
such matters in Bahá’í administration” (Antipodes 226). Members of insti-
tutions “should approach their task with extreme humility, and endeavor,
by their open-mindedness, their high sense of justice and duty, their can-
dor, their modesty, their entire devotion to the welfare and interests of the
friends, the Cause, and humanity, to win, not only the confidence and the
genuine support and respect of those whom they serve, but also their
esteem and real affection” (Bahá’í Administration 64). They must, he states,
“set aside their own inclinations, personal interests, likes and dislikes, and
regard only the welfare of the Cause and the well-being of the friends”
(Unfolding Destiny 14). Elsewhere, Shoghi Effendi notes, “The beloved
Master pointed out over and over again that unity and love among the
friends promotes harmony and the rapid spread of the Faith, and that
when these are sacrificed and disputes, anger and violent criticism take
their place, the Cause cannot move forward” (Antipodes 230).

Each believer bears the responsibility to act like a true Bahá’í, demon-
strating support for the institutions in order to establish the pattern of the
administration. Throughout the struggles to learn about the proper rela-
tions among individuals and institutions, the Guardian emphasizes
patience and unity in the face of mistakes, misunderstandings, and out-
breaks of contention:

There is only one remedy for this: to study the administration, to
> obey the Assemblies, and each believer seek to perfect his own char-
> acter as a Bahá’í. We can never exert the influence over others which
> we can exert over ourselves. If we are better, if we show love, patience,
> and understanding of the weaknesses of others, if we seek to never
> criticize but rather encourage, others will do likewise, and we can
> really help the Cause through our example and spiritual strength.
The Bahá’ís everywhere, when the administration is first established,

> find it very difficult to adjust themselves. They have to learn to obey,
> even when the assembly may be wrong, for the sake of unity. They
> have to sacrifice their personalities, to a certain extent, in order that
> the community life may grow and develop as a whole. These things
> are difficult—but we must realize that they will lead us to a very
> much greater, more perfect, way of life when the Faith is properly
> established according to the administration (qtd. in Compilations 2

112).

> If one of the friends is dissatisfied over the local situation he should
> nevertheless co-operate with his Spiritual Assembly and do all he can
> to help it. He can pray for it, he can show through his own deeds a
> noble Bahá’í example. The system is perfect, but if the instruments
> are imperfect we must still uphold the system, knowing God will
> watch over and protect His Cause, and that such conditions are only
> temporary and will pass away as the Cause grows and the Bahá’ís
mature.

He urges you not to lose heart, and never to stop serving the Faith.

> No matter what the attitude of others may be, it cannot exonerate you
> from showing the right attitude; your duty is to God, and you should
> rest assured in the end He will solve all these problems. (Community
> 16–17)

The Bahá’í administration is only the first shaping of what in future
> will come to be the social life and laws of community living. As yet
> the believers are only first beginning to grasp and practice it proper-
> ly. So we must have patience if at times it seems a little self-conscious
> and rigid in its workings. It is because we are learning something
> very difficult but very wonderful—how to live together as a commu-
> nity of Bahá’ís, according to the glorious teachings. (qtd. in Guidance
> 42)

In recent years, the Universal House of Justice has further elucidated
our understanding of the relationships among individuals and institutions,
while adding emphasis on the community. The Four Year Plan, beginning

62            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 23. 1/4. 2013

in 1996, focused on a single aim, a significant advance in the process of
entry by troops, which was to be “achieved through marked progress in
the activity and development of the individual believer, of the institutions,
and of the local community,” described as “the three constituent partici-
pants in the upbuilding of the Order of Bahá’u’lláh.” “It is the individual
who manifests the vitality of faith upon which the success of the teaching
work and the development of the community depend,” writes the House
of Justice. While “the maturity of the Spiritual Assembly must be meas-
ured not only by the regularity of its meetings and the efficiency of its
functioning, but also by the continuity of the growth of Bahá’í member-
ship, the effectiveness of the interaction between the Assembly and the
members of its community, the quality of the spiritual and social life of the
community, and the overall sense of vitality of a community in the process
of dynamic, ever-advancing development.” Finally, the House of Justice
observes, “The community, as distinguished from the individual and the
institutions, assumes its own character and identity as it grows in size,”
while noting that “Bahá’ís everywhere are at the very beginning of the
process of community building” (Turning Point par. 4.17–25). In expound-
ing upon this evolving set of relationships, the House of Justice states,

> The individual, the institutions, and the community—the three pro-
> tagonists in the Divine Plan—are being shaped under the direct influ-
> ence of His Revelation, and a new conception of each, appropriate for
> a humanity that has come of age, is emerging. The relationships that
> bind them, too, are undergoing a profound transformation, bringing
> into the realm of existence civilization-building powers which can
> only be released through conformity with His decree. (28 December
> 2010)

In the past decade, as the processes of the Plan have accelerated and the
bonds and patterns of action uniting individuals, communities, and insti-
tutions have evolved and grown richer and more intricate, the House of
Justice has explored facets of these relationships that build upon and tran-
scend the patterns of engagement manifest in the early decades of the

Formative Age. For example, the interaction between the Counsellors and
National Assemblies, “an evolving relationship that becomes richer as the
two institutions face the challenge of building Bahá’í communities and
witness with pride the onward march of the Faith” (Counsellors 15), was
expanded in areas of mutual responsibility, as described in the document
The Institution of the Counsellors and in other correspondence. The ongoing
and distinctive conversation, “grounded in allegiance to Bahá’u’lláh and
safeguarded by firmness in His Covenant” that “increasingly transcends
the habits of speech characteristic of an age preoccupied with trivial or
misdirected interests,” and that links individuals, communities, and insti-
tutions across the country with the National Spiritual Assembly in the set-
ting of the National Convention, was explored in a letter from the House
of Justice (16 May 2013). Even the effort required by the individual to live
up to the standard of Bahá’í law takes on a very different character when
it moves beyond a misplaced emphasis on institutions and sanctions to
examine the responsibilities and relations of the three protagonists.

In this context, then, every individual finds himself or herself
> immersed in a community that serves increasingly as an environment
> conducive to the cultivation of those attributes that are to distinguish
> a Bahá’í life—an environment in which a spirit of unity animates one
> and all; in which the ties of fellowship bind them; in which mistakes
> are treated with tolerance and fear of failure is diminished; in which
> criticism of others is avoided and backbiting and gossip give way to
> mutual support and encouragement; in which young and old work
> shoulder to shoulder, studying the Creative Word together and
> accompanying one another in their efforts to serve; in which children
> are reared through an educational process that strives to sharpen
> their spiritual faculties and imbue them with the spirit of the Faith; in
> which young people are helped to detect the false messages spread by
> society, recognize its fruitless preoccupations, and resist its pressures,
> directing their energies instead towards its betterment. The institu-
> tions of the Faith, for their part, strive to ensure that such an environ-
> ment is fostered. They do not pry into the personal lives of individu-
64            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 23. 1/4. 2013

> als. Nor are they vindictive and judgmental, eager to punish those
> who fall short of the Bahá’í standard. Except in extreme cases of bla-
> tant and flagrant disregard for the law that could potentially harm
> the Cause and may require them to administer sanctions, their atten-
> tion is focused on encouragement, assistance, counsel, and education
> (19 April 2013, and see 23 April 2013).

As the individuals, communities and institutions further develop in light
of the conceptions set forth in Bahá’u’lláh’s Teachings, the society-build-
ing implications of this evolving set of relationships become ever more
manifest. The House of Justice states:

> Animating the Bahá’í effort to discover the nature of a new set of rela-
> tionships among these three protagonists is a vision of a future soci-
> ety that derives inspiration from the analogy drawn by Bahá’u’lláh, in
> a Tablet penned nearly a century and a half ago, which compares the
> world to the human body. Cooperation is the principle that governs
> the functioning of that system. Just as the appearance of the rational
> soul in this realm of existence is made possible through the complex
> association of countless cells, whose organization in tissues and
> organs allows for the realization of distinctive capacities, so can civi-
> lization be seen as the outcome of a set of interactions among closely
> integrated, diverse components which have transcended the narrow
> purpose of tending to their own existence. And just as the viability of
> every cell and every organ is contingent upon the health of the body
> as a whole, so should the prosperity of every individual, every family,
> every people be sought in the well-being of the entire human race. In
> keeping with such a vision, institutions, appreciating the need for
> coordinated action channeled toward fruitful ends, aim not to control
> but to nurture and guide the individual, who, in turn, willingly
> receives guidance, not in blind obedience, but with faith founded on
> conscious knowledge. The community, meanwhile, takes on the chal-
> lenge of sustaining an environment where the powers of individuals,
> who wish to exercise self-expression responsibly in accordance with
> the common weal and the plans of institutions, multiply in unified
action. (3 March 2013)

SOCIETY-BUILDING POWER
In a letter titled “The Unfoldment of World Civilization” published in The
World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, Shoghi Effendi speaks of the “society-building
power” of the Faith. In referring to the community of the Most Great
Name, he states,

Conscious of their high calling, confident in the society-building
> power which their Faith possesses, they press forward undeterred and
> undismayed, in their efforts to fashion and perfect the necessary
> instruments wherein the embryonic World Order of Bahá’u’lláh can
> mature and develop. It is this building process, slow and unobtrusive,
> to which the life of the world-wide Bahá’í Community is wholly con-
> secrated, that constitutes the one hope of a stricken society. For this
> process is actuated by the generating influence of God’s changeless
> Purpose, and is evolving within the framework of the Administrative
Order of His Faith.

In a world the structure of whose political and social institutions is
> impaired, whose vision is befogged, whose conscience is bewildered,
> whose religious systems have become anemic and lost their virtue,
> this healing Agency, this leavening Power, this cementing Force,
> intensely alive and all-pervasive, has been taking shape, is crystalliz-
> ing into institutions, is mobilizing its forces, and is preparing for the
> spiritual conquest and the complete redemption of mankind. Though
> the society which incarnates its ideals be small, and its direct and tan-
> gible benefits as yet inconsiderable, yet the potentialities with which
> it has been endowed, and through which it is destined to regenerate
> the individual and rebuild a broken world, are incalculable. (World
> Order 195)

What must it have meant for the Bahá’í community of the West to
receive this letter in 1936 that declared unambiguously the Faith’s “soci-
ety-building power” and its potentialities “to regenerate the individual
and rebuild a broken world”? One can well imagine what many local com-
munities were like at the time. Outside of Iran, the numbers of believers

66            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 23. 1/4. 2013

were so small they barely constituted communities at all—indeed, only a
portion could establish a Local Assembly. Imagine such small groups of
people gathered in a home to study the message. Looking around the
room, well aware of their own shortcomings and the challenges they faced
to carry out even the most basic requirements of Bahá’í life, these early
believers might understandably have asked with some sense of disbelief,
“Does this refer to us? Do we have society-building power?” Of course, the
Guardian’s statement was accepted on faith, as the friends were certain of
the power of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation, but at that period of time, such a
capacity was surely very difficult to imagine. Yet, now, as we near the end
of the first century of the Formative Age, the signs of this emergent
capacity are increasingly evident, especially in the work of social action
and involvement in the discourses of society.

Until 1983, the friends everywhere outside of Iran were advised, owing
to the fewness of their numbers, to concentrate their work on the expan-
sion and consolidation of the Faith. A letter written on behalf of the
Guardian explains, “[O]ur contributions to the Faith are the surest way
of lifting once and for all time the burden of hunger and misery from
mankind, for it is only through the system of Bahá’u’lláh—Divine in ori-
gin—that the world can be gotten on its feet and want, fear, hunger, war,
etc., be eliminated.” Others “cannot contribute to our work or do it for us;
so really our first obligation is to support our own teaching work, as this
will lead to the healing of the nations” (qtd. in Guidance 192). And, on 19
November 1974, the House of Justice similarly writes, “[W]e have the
divinely given remedy for the real ills of mankind; no one else is doing or
can do this most important work, and if we divert our energy and our
funds into fields in which others are already doing more than we can hope
to do, we shall be delaying the diffusion of the Divine Message which is
the most important task of all” (Messages par. 151.5). In 1983, after some
six decades of systematic effort in the Formative Age, the House of Justice
was able to write,

From the beginning of His stupendous mission, Bahá’u’lláh urged
upon the attention of nations the necessity of ordering human affairs

> in such a way as to bring into being a world unified in all the essen-
> tial aspects of its life. In unnumbered verses and tablets He repeated-
> ly and variously declared the “progress of the world” and the “devel-
opment of nations” as being among the ordinances of God for this day.

. . . Now, after all the years of constant teaching activity, the
> Community of The Greatest Name has grown to the stage at which
> the processes of this development must be incorporated into its reg-
> ular pursuits. . . . (Messages par. 379.2–3)

Since that time, initiatives for social and economic development have been
a regular part of the activities of the Bahá’í world; the learning of three
decades is summarized in documents such as For the Betterment of the World
and “Social Action,” prepared by the Office of Social and Economic
Development at the Bahá’í World Centre. Across the world, Bahá’í activi-
ties for development take place at three levels of complexity. One involves
thousands of grassroots initiatives of varying duration in which the
Bahá’ís attempt to apply the Teachings to address local problems. Another
involves hundreds of sustained projects, including a large number of
schools. Finally, scores of Bahá’í-inspired development organizations have
emerged and are increasingly concerned with more complex challenges.

Also in the 1980s, the House of Justice began to emphasize a greater
involvement in the life of society, a specific objective of the Six Year Plan.
Such an effort has its roots in Bahá’u’lláh’s proclamation to the kings and
rulers and the public engagement of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in notable ways, such as
His Tablet to The Hague. The community carried this effort further dur-
ing the ministry of the Guardian, including associating the Bahá’í inter-
national community with the United Nations. More recently, the House of
Justice has extended this effort in terms of participation in the discourses
of society at various levels of involvement:

> There are, of course, a great many Bahá’ís who are engaged as indi-
> viduals in social action and public discourse through their occupa-
> tions. A number of non-governmental organizations, inspired by the
> teachings of the Faith and operating at the regional and national lev-
68            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 23. 1/4. 2013

> els, are working in the field of social and economic development for
> the betterment of their people. Agencies of National Spiritual
> Assemblies are contributing through various avenues to the promo-
> tion of ideas conducive to public welfare. At the international level,
> agencies such as the United Nations Office of the Bahá’í International
> Community are performing a similar function. To the extent neces-
> sary and desirable, the friends working at the grassroots of the com-
> munity will draw on this experience and capacity as they strive to
> address the concerns of the society around them. (Ridván 2010)

At the United Nations, the Bahá’í International Community (BIC)5

engages governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in
thinking about the different problems that are faced by the world, such as
the advancement of women. Rather than promoting its own particular
agenda on a topic, the BIC is able to assume a disinterested position in an
effort to strengthen unity of thought and action among all those who are
concerned about the issue. The BIC accomplishes this through a process
of consultation, action, and reflection. Because it has learned how to work
with others in the search for solutions, the influence of the BIC has grown
and has been noted in the wider society. Furthermore, over the years,
many Bahá’í national communities have engaged peoples, organizations,
and governments in a range of topics such as world peace, the equality of
women and men, communal harmony, moral education, the elimination of
racial prejudice, and the environment. Recently the Bahá’í World Centre
established the Office of Public Discourse in order to assist National
Assemblies to increase capacity within their national communities for
greater involvement in such social discourses. And where growth has
intensified in clusters, the friends have gradually developed capacity and a
degree of success in engaging others in fruitful interactions.

Thus, despite admittedly nascent and tentative influence in the face of
the enormous problems confronting humanity, the society-building power

Nations since 1948.

of the Faith has, in this first century of the Formative Age, emerged from
the realm of potentiality into practice. A decade ago, for example, the pro-
gram for the spiritual empowerment of junior youth was not much more
than a concept that emerged from exploration of a few literacy projects. It
has now spread to communities worldwide, involving some 125,000 jun-
ior youth in more than 13,000 groups across some 2,000 clusters, support-
ed by a network of 48 learning sites that work directly with more than 400
clusters and 150 regional institutes.

A steady stream of reports indicate the extensive impact on the lives of
junior youth and the youth who serve as animators, as well as on parents,
families, communities, and leaders of thought. Transformed by a new
vision of themselves as builders of a unified world, young people in diverse
parts of the world have engaged problems such as tribalism, prejudice,
fundamentalism, and consumerism. As noted in the Ridván 2014 message,
in the Tanna cluster of Vanuatu, where a local House of Worship will soon
rise, junior youth groups have participated in a variety of activities for
social action, including constructing a fish pond, raising poultry, and
acquiring carpentry skills to contribute to home-building. Parents, after
some initial reluctance, have grown to appreciate the impact of the pro-
gram on youth and junior youth in changing their character, contributing
to the strengthening of family life, and focusing the purpose of their lives
so as to avoid alcohol, fighting, and other destructive habits in which they
were previously ensnared. The program has even contributed to the
prominence and influence of the Local Assembly. News of its value has
spread, and other villages have appealed for inclusion of their own young
people.

Another example of the society-building power evident in bourgeoning
efforts for social action is found in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, where a
capacity for the establishment of community schools is growing within a
network of nearly two dozen Bahá’í-inspired agencies, currently involving
more than 400 primary schools, 1,200 teachers, and 22,000 students in
153 clusters in 21 countries. In the Central African Republic, before recent
challenges with civil war, the process had grown under the direction of
the Ahdieh Foundation to the point at which some of the Bahá’í-inspired

70            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 23. 1/4. 2013

community schools were able to perform better than government schools,
and opportunities for greater collaboration in a dialogue about education
with the official agencies emerged. And in the video Frontiers of
Learning, this society-building power is evident in the most advanced
clusters in the world in addressing profound cultural problems such as the
inequality of men and women, the early marriage of girls, and the impact
of the caste system in India. In cluster after cluster, there is growing tes-
timony from inside and outside the Bahá’í community of a transformation
of young people that enables them to throw off the shackles of prejudice,
narrow-mindedness, and conformity, thereby helping them to see the pos-
sibility for a different way of life and become empowered to find their own
role in contributing to the betterment of the world.

Among the aims of the Bahá’ís, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote, are to eradicate the
causes of war and raise the banner of the Most Great Peace; to eliminate
racial, national, religious, sectarian, or political prejudices; to forget per-
sonal interests and work for the betterment of the world; and to establish
the oneness of humanity. How many the challenges Bahá’ís must learn to
address in order to assist humanity in its current plight to achieve
Bahá’u’lláh’s high aims! We feeble ones are only at the beginning of this
conscious process of learning, struggling with the most basic processes of
our expansion and consolidation in order to eventually become large and
capable enough to have an impact of these more profound and intractable
problems of humanity. Yet, generation after generation will build on what
has already been accomplished to meet ever more complex challenges,
until, in the centuries ahead, the society-building power of the Cause will
ultimately contribute to the birth and efflorescence of a new world order.

NAVIGATING THE PITFALLS OF THE PRESENT

AND OF FUTURE CENTURIES
In reflecting upon the insights derived over the course of the first centu-
ry of the Formative Age, a clearer understanding emerges of what it
means to be a Bahá’í, the mission that Bahá’u’lláh intends for His commu-
nity, the aims of the Divine Plan, the nature of Bahá’í administration and
the manner in which it evolves and unfolds, and how the Bahá’í communi-

ty grows and develops in order that its society-building power may con-
tribute to the gradual and inevitable emergence of a new civilization. The
six points previously discussed are only a personal perspective and are not
intended to be exhaustive, yet each holds profound implications for the
progress of the Faith in centuries to come. Future stages of the organic
unfoldment of the Faith under the guidance of the House of Justice will
undoubtedly involve significant changes that cause a rethinking of person-
al understandings about the Teachings and the administrative order. This
is in no way a movement away from, but a movement toward, what
Bahá’u’lláh intends—a deeper insight into the meaning of the revealed
Word and an increased ability to translate it into reality and action.

In His Writings, Bahá’u’lláh again and again refers to the concept of idle
fancies and vain imaginings. “Idle fancies have debarred men from the
Horizon of Certitude, and vain imaginings withheld them from the Choice
Sealed Wine” (Epistle 44), He states. He is referring to the conception of
the things in our own mind, how we understand reality, what we under-
stand the world to be, and what we choose to do—as opposed to what He
understands the world to be and what He wishes us to do. “Those words
uttered by the Luminaries of Truth must needs be pondered, and should
their significance be not grasped, enlightenment should be sought from
the Trustees of the depositories of Knowledge, that these may expound
their meaning, and unravel their mystery” (Kitáb-i-Íqán 181), Bahá’u’lláh
explains. “For it behooveth no man to interpret the holy words according
to his own imperfect understanding, nor, having found them to be con-
trary to his inclination and desires, to reject and repudiate their truth.”
And thus He admonishes, “Abandon the things current amongst you and
adopt that which the faithful Counsellor biddeth you” (Tablets 71).

Our responsibility as Bahá’ís, then, is to weigh our personal conceptions
and ideas to determine to what extent they are derived from contending
viewpoints and forces that operate within the wider society—the society
in which we were raised that leaves its imprint on us. We must also strive
to transcend the perceptions of our own limited consciousness, even in
regard to such matters as our personal understanding of the meaning and
practice of the Teachings. For our capacity to truly understand what
Bahá’u’lláh intends is, at any moment, circumscribed. Shoghi Effendi

72             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 23. 1/4. 2013

reminds us that “[a]n exact and thorough comprehension of so vast a sys-
tem, so sublime a revelation, so sacred a trust is for obvious reasons the
beyond the reach and ken of our finite minds” (World Order 100).
Therefore we cannot claim that we personally understand absolutely what
Bahá’u’lláh says, nor can we insist that the Faith must move along the path
of our own understanding. We cannot allow our imperfect opinions to
become idle fancies and vain imaginings that prevent us from growing in
understanding as we “trust to time, and the guidance of God’s Universal
House of Justice” (Bahá’í Administration 62).

It is easy to perceive the mistakes and shortcomings of the believers of
an earlier age. How obviously wrong it was to reject the idea of need for
an administrative order or the leadership of the Guardian. Looking back,
we can realize how shortsighted were those who could have grasped the
immortal crown of Knight of Bahá’u’lláh in the first year of the Ten Year
Crusade, yet failed to arise. How foolish were those who accepted the
ridiculous claim of Mason Remey. But it is much harder to perceive the
mistakes and limited understandings of the present day, whether it is an
inability to grasp the vision and possibilities of the current stage of the
Divine Plan or the evolution of the administration, or the implications of
Bahá’u’lláh’s Teachings for a future society.

In 1924, Shoghi Effendi wrote two messages that shed light on this pro-
found and most fundamental responsibility facing every Bahá’í. One mes-
sage was written at a time when Shoghi Effendi withdrew from the Holy
Land for an extended period. He wrote to the Bahá’í world and poured out
his heart. The letter was addressed “For the attention of all the Bahá’ís of
the world in both the East and the West without exception.”6 He says, “At
this time, when this poor unfortunate one is absent from the Holy Land,
burning in the fires of grief and bereavement, and in the secluded corner
to which I have retired—remote and isolated from friend and stranger
alike—my heart is so surging with emotion, and my spirit in such a state

6. Letter from Shoghi Effendi to the Bahá’ís of the world in both the East and
the West, January 1924; published in Tawqí‘át-i-Mubárakih 1922-26, pp. 184–94.
Provisional translation

of turmoil, that, straightway picking up my pen, I am resolved, putting my
whole trust in God, to declare and communicate to the generality of the
Bahá’ís in all lands my true feelings, and by means of these few words,
each letter of which proceeds and springs from a wounded sensibility and
a broken heart, to remonstrate, acutely pained and abashed as I am to do
so, with the friends of both the East and the West.”

Shoghi Effendi was at that time overwhelmed by the loss of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá; he dearly missed Him. And he was suffering from the attacks of the
Covenant-breakers who again arose with various plots against the Faith.
But these were not the reasons for his departure at that time. Instead,
what weighed upon him was the response of the sincere Bahá’ís to their
duties. He writes, “That, however, which has chiefly given rise, and prima-
rily contributed, to the anxiety and despondency of this downcast servant;
aggregated the distress and anguish of this Most Great Calamity; induced
me, regretfully, to compose this letter; and engender diverse problems . . .
, is none other than the lack of true fellowship and co-operation among
His loved ones.” In particular, he notes the “signs of disunity; of negli-
gence and neglect; of a lack of co-operation; of carelessness; of rivalry; and
a grievance about the contents and purport of the messages received”;
indeed, “grievance about the contents and purport of the messages
received” from the Guardian himself !

Shoghi Effendi had given the faithful believers the new instruments of
the administrative order. They needed to arise and put the administration
into effect, in the most efficacious and efficient way, in order to apply the
healing remedy of the Teachings. But what happened instead, was that
these devoted friends, whether intentionally or largely as a result of imma-
turity, misused these instruments. Those elected as members of
Assemblies made decisions that served their own inclinations and inter-
ests, while those not elected complained about the administration, criti-
cized their Assemblies, and ignored the decisions and directions. In the
face of such debilitating conditions, the Guardian decided, “Since . . . it is
not possible for me to attend to important matters, I have, therefore, of
necessity chosen to remove myself to a secluded corner. . . .” He not return
until “the sweet breath of fellowship and amity, of concord and unity is

74             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 23. 1/4. 2013

wafted abroad, and reaches the nostrils of this yearning and expectant
exile. . . .” Without this, he concludes, “there has never been, nor ever shall
there be, any hope.”

After expressing his confidence that the friends would respond favor-
ably, he then raised their vision about the nature of their work. By build-
ing Local and National Spiritual Assemblies, he explains, eventually the
House of Justice would be established. “When the Universal House of
Justice shall have stepped forth from the realm of hope into that of visible
fulfilment,” the “recipient of the bounties of God and His inspiration,” it
will “proceed to devise and carry out important undertakings, world-wide
activities and the establishment of glorious institutions,” so that “[b]y
this means the renown of the Cause of God will become world-wide and
its light will illumine the whole earth.”7

The second letter, also written in 1924, is published in Bahá’í
Administration. The Guardian begins by acknowledging signs of difficulty
among some members of the community to correctly understand and
respond to his instructions to establish and ensure the proper functioning
of the administration. He writes, “I have learned with feelings of sadness
and surprise that some vague sense of apprehension, a strange misconcep-
tion of its immediate purpose and methods, is slowly gaining ground,
steadily affecting its wholesome growth and vigorous development
throughout the continent.” And he continues,

Though such signs should appear from time to time, and however
> unrepresentative they be of the vast and growing mass of its con-
> vinced and zealous supporters, the world over, what, I wonder, could
> have caused this uneasiness of mind? Are such misgivings possible,
> though on the part of but a few, in the face of the remarkable manifes-
> tations of so remarkable a movement? To what extent do they form a
> part of those mental tests and trials destined at various times by the
> Almighty to stir and reinvigorate the body of His Cause, and how far
> are they traceable to our imperfect state of understanding, to our
> weaknesses and failings?

7. Though from the same letter, this particular passage is an authorized trans-
lation published in Compilation of Compilations, vol. 1, p. 329, no. 741.

That the Cause of God should, in the days to come, witness many
> a challenging hour and pass through critical stages in preparation for
> the glories of its promised ascendancy in the new world has been,
> time and again, undeniably affirmed by our departed Master, and is
> abundantly proved to us all by its heroic past and turbulent history.
> And yet, if it is the lot of the chosen ones of God, the people of Bahá,
> to face adversity and suffer tribulation before achieving ultimate vic-
> tory, are we to believe that whatever befalls us is divinely ordained,
> and in no wise the result of our faint-heartedness and negligence?

(Bahá’í Administration 60)

And then Shoghi Effendi laid out the duty of the believers, in a manner
that applies equally to every new stage of the organic unfoldment of the
Faith:

What, let us ask ourselves, should be our attitude as we stand under
> the all-seeing eye of our vigilant Master, gazing at a sad spectacle so
> utterly remote from the spirit which He breathed into the world? Are
> we to follow in the wake of the wayward and the despairing? Are we
> to allow our vision of so unique, so enduring, so precious a Cause to
> be clouded by the stain and dust of worldly happenings, which, no
> matter how glittering and far-reaching in their immediate effects, are
> but the fleeting shadows of an imperfect world? Are we to be carried
> away by the flood of hollow and conflicting ideas, or are we to stand,
> unsubdued and unblemished, upon the everlasting rock of God’s
> Divine Instructions? Shall we not equip ourselves with a clear and
> full understanding of their purpose and implications for the age we
> live in, and with an unconquerable resolve arise to utilize them, intel-
> ligently and with scrupulous fidelity, for the enlightenment and the
promotion of the good of all mankind?

Humanity, torn with dissension and burning with hate, is crying at
> this hour for a fuller measure of that love which is born of God, that
> love which in the last resort will prove the one solvent of its incalcu-
lable difficulties and problems. . . .

And as we make an effort to demonstrate that love to the world may

> we also clear our minds of any lingering trace of unhappy misunder-
> standings that might obscure our clear conception of the exact pur-
> pose and methods of this new world order, so challenging and com-
> plex, yet so consummate and wise. We are called upon by our beloved
> Master in His Will and Testament not only to adopt it unreservedly,
> but to unveil its merit to all the world. To attempt to estimate its full

> connection. Let us be on our guard lest we measure too strictly the
> Divine Plan with the standard of men. I am not prepared to state that
> it agrees in principle or in method with the prevailing notions now
> uppermost in men’s minds, nor that it should conform with those
> imperfect, precarious, and expedient measures feverishly resorted to
> by agitated humanity. Are we to doubt that the ways of God are not
> necessarily the ways of man? Is not faith but another word for implic-
> it obedience, whole-hearted allegiance, uncompromising adherence to
> that which we believe is the revealed and express will of God, howev-
> er perplexing it might first appear, however at variance with the shad-
> owy views, the impotent doctrines, the crude theories, the idle imag-
> inings, the fashionable conceptions of a transient and troublous age?
> If we are to falter or hesitate, if our love for Him should fail to direct
> us and keep us within His path, if we desert Divine and emphatic prin-
> ciples, what hope can we any more cherish for healing the ills and
> sicknesses of this world? (Bahá’í Administration 60–63)

The challenge for each generation of believers is to orient itself to the
two centers of authoritative guidance, the Book and the House of Justice,
that their footsteps in the path of service may be firm, whatever the chal-
lenges of the age in which they live, until the Teachings take root in the
hearts of the people of the world and in the structures of a new social
order.
