Paradise & Paradigm, University of Toronto Ph.D. thesis (1996),
published by the State University of New York Press, 1999.
Page 135: “Principles practically have a life of their own. They
restructure consciousness. They act as social forces. They can
revolutionize worldviews. They crystallize into symbols. They can
become institutions. They are dynamics of world-building. A
system of principles wrestles the social monster of chaos, and the
creation myth becomes a recreative reality. Social evolution is
catalyzed.
Perspectivally, a paradigm can function as a worldview. It patterns
what we perceive. A paradigm shift, like the mirrors in a
kaleidoscope, changes this pattern. Bahā’u’llāh has tried to effect
a paradigm shift in the direction of world unity through a set of
principles.”
Ideas are anchored in history. This chapter introduces the Bahā’ī
paradigm of unity in its historical context.”

BAHA’U’LLAH
The Tablet of Unity

1. Unity in Religion
Baha’u’llah (ittiḥād dar dīn)

Distinct from the plurality of ‘unity among         Religious solidarity ‘has always been the
religions’ (see Principle 11, infra), ‘unity in     cause of the victory of the Faith of God in
religion’ is a singularity.                         every age and century’, as Baha’u’llah
It is unity within the Baha’i community             underscores metaphorically:
itself:                                             ‘Togetherness is the mystic sword of God’.
‘The first kind of unity is unity in religion
(ittiḥād dar dīn)’.

2. Unity in Speech
Baha’u’llah (ittiḥād dar qawl)

A faith-community should speak with one           He explains that internal dissension can
voice …                                           foment discord and thus deprive the

reflect its social cohesion.                      unity.

‘Unity in speech’ has three dimensions:
‘And another kind of unity is unity in
speech (ittiḥād dar qawl)’, Baha’u’llah           (1) unity of discourse;
writes.                                           (2) harmony of word and deed; and

(3) exercise of wisdom in speech.
3. Unity in Religious Acts

Baha’u’llah (ittiḥād-i ā’māl)

This unity focuses not on deeds in general,
but on pious practices in particular, which
can divide as well as unite:
‘And in another respect, unity in [ritual]
acts (ittiḥād-i āmāl) is intended. For any
difference in these is the cause of disunity.’
From the ‘ocean’ Islam have branched
numerous ‘gulfs’:
‘Thus do the stones weep and the Pen of
the All-High laments.’

4. Unity of Station
Baha’u’llah (ittiḥād-i maqām)

‘And amongst the realms of unity is the          If this were truly put into practice, then ‘the
unity of rank and station’ (ittiḥād-i            world would become as the Abhá Paradise’.
maqām)’.
Here, ‘unity’ means ‘equality’ of station.
The ideal demeanour of Baha’is is to see
one’s own self in relation to others …
… such that all people might ideally be on
the same ‘plane’ (ṣuq‘) and station
(maqām).

5. Unity of Souls
Baha’u’llah (ittiḥād-i nufūs)

‘The meaning of the unity of souls (ittiḥād-i     The unity of souls (ittiḥād-i nufūs), from the
nufūs) is that all should gather around and       beginning of creation until now, hath been

Tablet of Unity interrelate:                      according to the Decree of God and His Law.
These unities (ittiḥād-hā) that We have
mentioned are each an army among the
hosts of God, a part of the party of God, and
a command that is part of the Decree of God.
6. Unity of People and Wealth

Baha’u’llah (ittiḥād-i nufūs va amvāl)

‘Another example is the unity of souls and      After acknowledging the virtues of
of wealth (ittiḥād-i nufūs va amvāl) and        equality, Baha’u’llah explains that
with this example we will end our               voluntary sharing (muvāsāt) ranks higher

(amvāl) to one another altruistically, as       that altruistic individuals who ‘prefer
needed.                                         others over themselves have a station that,

> in truth, is above this station’.

Baha’u’llah then cites Q. 59:9.
7. Unity of God
Baha’u’llah (tawḥīd-i ilāhī)

Baha’u’llah ends this Tablet by reminding
the recipient to contemplate God:
‘Everyone must meditate upon God and in
particular upon the Unity of God (tawḥīd-i
ilāhī)’.

BAHA’U’LLAH
Other Types of Unity

8. Unity of Existence & Unity of Vision
(Arabic: waḥdat al-wujūd wa shuhūd/Persian: vaḥdat-i vujūd va shuhūd)

Here, this ‘oneness’ is not the ‘Unity of     Elsewhere, Baha’u’llah explains that true

ineffable.
9. Unity of the Manifestations of God

Baha’u’llah (maqām-i tawḥīd)

A major Baha’i doctrine is that of prophetic      ‘These Manifestations of God have each a
unity, wherein all Messengers of God – such as    twofold station. One is the station of pure

10. Spiritual Oneness/Unity of Spirit

Baha’u’llah (vaḥdat-i rawḥānī)

Tablet of the Holy Mariner is an important       In the untranslated Persian section of the
Baha’i allegory.                                 Tablet of the Holy Mariner, there is a scene

Effendi translated after his appointment as
the Guardian of the Baha’i Faith in 1921.

11. Unity Among Religions
‘Abdu’l-Baha: Peace among Religions (ṣuḥul bayn-i adyān)

This Baha’i principle of unity is inferred from   ‘’I hope that the noble congress may become
such passages as the ‘Tablet of                   assisted . . . and create a compact of eternal
Ornaments’ (Lawḥ-i Ṭarazāt). Baha’u’llah          peace among the adherents of religion

The Seven Candles of Unity
12. Unity in the Political Realm

‘Abdu’l-Baha (vaḥdat-i siyāsat)

‘Abdu’l-Baha’s vision of the future is based       ‘As to “unity in the political realm”, Shoghi

> The UN is far from perfect, but its formation

13. Unity of Thought in World Undertakings

‘Abdu’l-Baha (vaḥdat-i ārā)

The next global development foreseen by
‘Abdu’l-Baha is that of international
cooperation:
‘The second candle is unity of thought
(vaḥdat-i ārā) in world undertakings, the
consummation of which will erelong be
witnessed’.
The authors of ‘Century of Light’ observe
that this prediction, for the most part, has
already taken place.
14. Unity in Freedom

‘Abdu’l-Baha (vaḥdat-i āzādī)

‘Abdu’l-Baha’s next predicate, in the form of     ‘“Unity in freedom” has today, of course,
a prediction, is the burgeoning desire for        become a universal aspiration of the Earth’s
freedom and independence and national             inhabitants’.
self-determination worldwide:
‘The third candle is unity in freedom
(vaḥdat-i āzādī) which will surely come to
pass’.
In Century of Light, the authors note that
this urge to freedom is now a global
phenomenon:
15. Unity in Religion

‘Abdu’l-Baha (vaḥdat-i dīnī)

‘Abdu’l-Baha next writes of unity in religion
(i.e. eventual uniting of all religions in
common cause for the commonweal):
‘The fourth candle is unity in religion
(vaḥdat-i dīnī) which is the corner-stone of
the foundation itself, and which, by the
power of God, will be revealed in all its
splendour’.
This principle is closely related to Principle
#1 above.

> 16. Unity of Nations

The eventual unity of nations is distinct       This fifth ‘candle of unity’, according to

homogeneity’.
17. Unity of Races
‘Abdu’l-Baha (vaḥdat-i jins)

‘The sixth candle is unity of races (vaḥdat-i
jins), making of all that dwell on earth
peoples and kindreds of one race’.
In Century of Light, the authors comment
that ‘the processes involved’ in the ‘unity of
race’ are ‘far advanced’.
Elsewhere, ‘Abdu’l-Baha urges the Baha’is
to perfect their unity, irregardless of race or
ethnicity, so that the Baha’i community can
offer a living model of unity.
18. Unity of Language

‘Abdu’l-Baha (vaḥdat-i lisān)

‘The seventh candle is unity of language
(vaḥdat-i lisān), i.e., the choice of a
universal tongue in which all peoples will
be instructed and converse’.
In Century of Light, the authors observe
that ‘the processes involved’ in achieving
‘unity of language’ are ‘far advanced’ …
… ‘while the need for formal adoption of a
universal auxiliary language remains’.

‘ABDU’L-BAHA
Other Types of Unity
19. Unity of All Mankind/World Unity

‘Abdu’l-Baha (ittifāq-i kull va ittiḥād-i ‘umūm)

The overarching principle of Baha’i
teachings is the consciousness of the
oneness of humankind:
‘Hence the unity of all mankind (ittifāq-i
kull va ittiḥād-i ‘umūm) can in this day be
achieved’.
‘Verily this is none other but one of the
wonders of this wondrous age, this
glorious century’.
20. Unity of Species

‘Abdu’l-Baha (vaḥdat-i jins)

Appeals to nature are commonly met with
in ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s discourse.
This is one example, from ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s
Howard University speech in Rankin Chapel
on 23 April 1912:
‘Often a white dove soars aloft with a black
one. Throughout the animal kingdom we
do not find the creatures separated because
of color. They recognize unity of species
and oneness of kind’.

21. Unity of Truth
‘Abdu’l-Baha (vaḥdat-i ḥaqīqat)

With confidence, ‘Abdu’l-Baha expresses        Truth is seen as a necessary adjunct of
hope that ‘the unity of truth (vaḥdat-i        unity, largely because disunity is the
ḥaqīqat), through the power of God, will       outcome of illusion, such as the pernicious

22. Unity of Conscience

‘Abdu’l-Baha (vaḥdat-i vujdān)

The question of peace requires ‘unity of          ‘[U]ntil the minds of men become united,
conscience’ in reaching consensus:                no important matter can be accomplished.
‘There is not one soul whose conscience           At present universal peace is a matter of

23. All-Unifying Power/Collective Center/Covenant

‘Abdu’l-Baha (jihat-i jāmiʻih)

in Tablets of the Divine Plan, after speaking of       ‘It establishes a relationship between the East
various kinds of ‘collective centers’ (an              and the West, organizes the oneness of the

eternal Collective Center’.                            Justice, national, regional and local spiritual

assemblies), and Baha’i laws and ethics.
24. Unity of Science and Religion

‘Abdu’l-Baha (vaḥdat-i ‘ilm va dīn)

The harmony and complementarity of
science and religion is a bedrock principle
of Baha’i belief:
‘For every era hath a spirit; the spirit of this
illumined era lieth in the teachings of
Bahá’u’lláh’. …
‘They are founded upon the unity of
science and religion (vaḥdat-i ‘ilm va dīn)
and upon investigation of truth’.
25. Unity of the Rights of Men and Women

‘Abdu’l-Baha (vaḥdat-i huqūq-i rijāl va nisā’)

‘Equality of both sexes’, that is, gender       ‘Equality of the sexes will be established in
equality, is presented by ‘Abdu’l-Baha as       proportion to the increased opportunities
one of the foremost principles of Baha’i        afforded woman in this age, for man and
precept and praxis:                             woman are equally the recipients of powers
‘Bahá’u’lláh proclaimed equality of the         and endowments from God, the Creator’.
sexes (literally, ‘oneness of the rights of
men and women’ (vaḥdat-i huqūq-i rijāl va
nisā’)) – that both man and woman are
servants of God before Whom there is no
distinction’. …

26. Unity in Education
‘Abdu’l-Baha (vaḥdat-i uṣūl va qavānīn-i tarbiyat)

Universal compulsory education is another      ‘a universal curriculum (tarbiyat-i vāḥidih)
core Baha’i belief, and the curriculum must    should be established, and the basis of
be the same, irrespective of gender,           ethics be the same (yik usūl va adab)’.
according to ‘Abdu’l-Baha:
Eighth, education is essential, and all
standards of training and teaching (vaḥdat-
i usūl va qavānīn-i tarbiyat) throughout the
world of mankind should be brought into
conformity and agreement’ …
27. Unity of Husband and Wife

‘Abdu’l-Baha (vaḥdat)

Unity of husband and wife is capable of
fulfilment if true equality exists between
husband and wife, and if that unity is
spiritual as well as physical:
‘Among the people of Bahá, however,
marriage must be a union of the body and
of the spirit as well, … for if the marriage is
based both on the spirit and the body, that
union (vaḥdat) is a true one, hence it will
endure’.

28. Unity of the Family
‘Abdu’l-Baha (ittiḥād va ittifāq dar miyān-i khāndān)

In a Baha’i perspective, the family is         ’Note ye how easily, where unity existeth in
considered the fundamental unit of             a given family (ittiḥād va ittifāq dar miyān-i
society:                                       khāndān), the affairs of that family are
‘Bahá’u’lláh came to bring unity to the        conducted’, ‘Abdu’l-Baha observes,
world, and a fundamental unity is that of      ‘what progress the members of that family
the family’.                                   make, how they prosper in the world’.
If society is an aggregate of families, then
family unity is an index of social cohesion:

29. Baha’i Unity
‘Abdu’l-Baha (vaḥdat-i Bahā’ī)

Moral authenticity is needed before Baha’i        ‘They must bring to an end the benighted
ideals can be respected and taken seriously       prejudices of all nations and religions and

Widely acknowledged as the youngest independent world religion, the Baha’i Faith offers an
ideology, theory, modality and model of social harmony, or ‘unity’, for bringing about an ideal
world order, from family relations to international relations. Any first-order (i.e. descriptive)
phenomenology of the Baha’i religion must therefore appreciate its paradigmatic focus on ‘unity
and concord’ which, for Baha’is, entails harmonizing pluralities in order to advance civilization.
A social solution presupposes its opposite, the problem. In the Baha’i worldview, such
descriptors as disunity/unity, discord/concord, disharmony/harmony, estrangement/engagement,
enmity/amity and so forth, are meaningful concepts for understanding Baha’i belief and its social
dynamic in action. These binary opposites can metaphorically be expressed as an ‘illness/cure’
model of social reality, which model offers a useful phenomenological approach to the study of
religions in general, and the study of the Baha’i Faith in particular.

The present study is therefore contextualized within a broader discussion of the illness/cure
soteriological analytical model in the phenomenology of religions, as popularized by the best-
selling author, Stephen Prothero, professor of religion at Boston University, who specializes in
American religions. Then follows a discussion of how the Baha’i religion frames the human
predicament and its resolution, with unity acclaimed as social salvation. As for the history of
ideas within Baha’i thought concerning unity, Raymond Frank Piper’s typology of Baha’i
principles of unity is reviewed. The methodology of the present study is then presented, followed
by a discussion of unity as paramount in the Baha’i value system. Some fifty (50) distinct Baha’i
principles of unity are then enumerated and briefly described, including, inter alia, types of unity
as propounded by Baha’u’llah in the Tablet of Unity (Lawḥ-i Ittiḥād); other types of unity; types
of unity as defined by ‘Abdu’l-Baha, beginning with the ‘Tablet’ of ‘The Seven Candles of

Unity’; other types of unity; types of unity articulated by Shoghi Effendi as foundational to
Baha’i administration and the future World Commonwealth; other unities – a splendid array of
understudied elements of the Baha’i social gospel and the social laboratories of their coordinated
application in Baha’i communal life.

As to primary sources, every effort has been made to select only exemplars from the Baha’i
writings that are authenticated as to the original and authorized as to their English translations. In
several cases, when authorized English translations are not available, professional translations
have been given instead. (Where a non-authoritative text has been cited, the status of that text has
been indicated as such.) All transliterations, unless otherwise indicated, have been supplied by
the present writer (who takes responsibility for any errors), after consulting the relevant original
Persian and Arabic texts, with online links provided so that the reader has access to these primary
sources.

Since the present study is a first extended survey, based squarely on authenticated primary
sources, of the notion of unity vis-à-vis the Baha’i Faith,2 the results are preliminary, not
definitive. No doubt additional Baha’i principles of unity will be found that may significantly
expand and enrich this list. Finally, conclusions and recommendations for further study are
offered.

I.   The Illness/Cure Soteriological Model in the Phenomenology of Religions

World religions are systems of salvation, liberation or harmony. Their respective offers of
salvation, liberation or harmony are in direct response to what is defined as the human
predicament. If humanity’s fundamental problem is sin, as in Christianity generally, then
Christianity’s redemptive offer is that of salvation from sin. Similarly, in early Buddhism, the
principal difficulty affecting the world is suffering. Thus early Buddhism offered liberation from

suffering. In the Baha’i Faith, the most recent independent world religion, the human
predicament is profound estrangement at all levels of society. Thus the social salvation that the
Baha’i religion offers is that of unity, from family relations to international relations.

Universally, the root of all moral and societal problems, and their eventual redemption,
may be problematized as the ‘human predicament’. Generally, the concept of the human
predicament operates as a meaningful category of comparison within the phenomenology of
religions. In ‘The Human Predicament as Illness: The Medical Model as a Tool for Comparison’,
John J. Thatamanil proposes a ‘standard fourfold medical model or therapeutic paradigm’ of the
human predicament: (1) diagnosis, (2) etiology (origin or cause), (3) prognosis and (4) therapy.3
The Buddha’s Four Noble Truths, for instance, can be mapped out onto this medical model: ‘All
is suffering (diagnosis); (2) Suffering has a cause, namely craving (etiology); (3) Suffering can
be brought to cessation (prognosis); (4) The eightfold path is [the] way to bring an end to
suffering (therapy)’.4 Thus the medical model is a ‘promising tool for comparative religion’ since
it allows for commensurable comparisons across traditions.5

Stephen Prothero adopts a similar illness/cure approach, but reduces the analysis to
diagnosis and prognosis. In God Is Not One Prothero argues that the world’s religions each
responds to the ‘human predicament’ as defined by each religion. Prothero offers this ‘admittedly
simplistic’ four-part approach to his illness/cure model of religious offers of salvation, liberation
or harmony: ‘Each religion articulates: a problem; a solution to this problem, which also serves
as the religious goal; a technique (or techniques) for moving from this problem to this solution;
and an exemplar (or exemplars) who chart this path from problem to solution’.6 This is an

excellent answer to the problem of ‘how’ to teach world religions in a public school setting. Here
are the problem/solution paradigms that Prothero presents for the eight religions he covers in his
book:

•   Yoruba (West African): The problem is disconnection/the solution is connection with

our destinies, to one another, and to sacred power.7

•   Hinduism: The problem is the perpetual cycle of birth, death, rebirth/the solution is

liberation.8

•   Buddhism: The problem is suffering/the solution is awakening.9

•   Confucianism: The problem is chaos/the solution is proper social order.10

•   Taoism: The problem is lifelessness/the solution is flourishing, to live life to its

fullest.11

•   Judaism: The problem is exile/the solution is to return to God.12

•   Christianity: The problem is sin/the solution is salvation.13

•   Islam: The problem is pride/the solution is submission.14

This approach has much to commend it, although one may differ as to the problem/solution
formulas. In a nutshell, one can say that the Irano-Semitic religions (i.e. Zoroastrianism and the
‘Abrahamic religions’, including Judaism, Christianity, Islam and the Baha’i Faith) offer types of
‘salvation’, variously defined, while South Asian religions (i.e. Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism

and Sikhism) offer forms of ‘liberation’, while East Asian religions (i.e. Confucianism and
Taoism), along with some indigenous religions (such as the Yoruba tradition referenced above)
emphasize the restoration of ‘harmony’ in the cosmic and social order. These promises of
salvation, liberation or harmony are offered in direct response to how the human predicament is
variously defined in the world’s religious traditions.

II.    The Baha’i Problematic of the Human Predicament

As signalled in the epigraph above, Baha’u’llah (1817–92, prophet-founder of the Baha’i Faith),
has formulated the human predicament in this striking statement: ‘No two men can be found who
may be said to be outwardly and inwardly united. The evidences of discord and malice (nafāq)
are apparent everywhere, though all were made for harmony (ittifāq) and union (ittiḥād)’.15 The
solution to the human predicament is unity: ‘The well-being of mankind, its peace and security
(īn iṣlāḥ va rāḥat) are unattainable unless and until its unity (ittifāq va ittiḥād) is firmly
established. This unity can never be achieved so long as the counsels (naṣā‘iḥ) which the Pen of
the Most High hath revealed are suffered to pass unheeded’.16

The Baha’i doctrine of unity offers a powerful explanatory account of the human
predicament and its way out. The central problematic in the Baha’i worldview is estrangement,
i.e. ‘disunity’, according to the Universal House of Justice (the democratically elected
international Baha’i council that oversees the affairs of the Baha’i world): ‘Few will disagree that
the universal disease sapping the health of the body of humankind is that of disunity’.17

The Baha’i writings use a variety of terms for this basic and pervasive disease of disunity.

One example is ‘estrangement’, an example of which is this: ‘The word of God which the

wisdom among nations! Shut your eyes to estrangement (bīgānigī), then fix your gaze upon unity
(yigānigī).’18

If the disease is disunity, what are its symptoms? They range from problems in family
relations all the way up to international relations, from divorce to war. Indeed, the Universal
House of Justice writes of ‘these other ills’ which ‘are but various symptoms and side effects of
the basic disease – disunity’.19 This calls for a remedy capable of ‘healing the countless ills
which, in the final analysis, are the consequences of the disunity afflicting the human family’,20
as the Baha’i International Community has likewise framed the Baha’i remedy/cure analysis. ‘As
unity is the remedy for the world’s ills’, the Universal House of Justice further states, pointing to
the primary source for this panacea, ‘its one certain source lies in the restoration of religion’s
influence in human affairs. The laws and principles revealed by God, in this day, Bahá’u’lláh
declares, “are the most potent instruments and the surest of all means for the dawning of the light
of unity amongst men”.’21

III. The Baha’i Response to the Human Predicament: Unity

What, then, does the Baha’i religion offer as a response to the human predicament, as formulated
in the previous section? The illness/cure soteriological model in the phenomenology of religions
offers a useful approach to understanding the Baha’i paradigm of social salvation. In a number of
passages, Baha’u’llah likens the founders of the world religions to skilful physicians who, with
their fingers on the pulse of humanity, can diagnose the disease and prescribe the remedy, which
will be different from age to age:

The Prophets of God (payāmbarān) should be regarded as physicians (pizishkān) whose
> task is to foster the well-being of the world and its peoples (parvarish-i gītī va kisān-i ān),
> that, through the spirit of oneness (bi-darmān-i yigānigī), they may heal (chārih) the

Here, the ‘spirit of oneness’ is the equivalent of ‘unity’, as Baha’u’llah clearly states in this
exhortation: ‘The Great Being saith: O well-beloved ones! The tabernacle of unity (yigānigī)
hath been raised; regard ye not one another as strangers (bīgānagān). Ye are the fruits of one tree,
and the leaves of one branch.’23 ‘Unity’ (yigānigī) and ‘estrangement’ (bīgānigī) provide
a contrasting and rhyming pair of antonyms often used for poetic effect:

> The first utterance of Him Who is the All-Wise is this: O children of dust! Turn your faces
> from the darkness of estrangement (bīgānigī) to the effulgent light of the daystar of unity
> (yigānigī). This is that which above all else will benefit the peoples of the earth. O friend!
> Upon the tree of utterance there hath never been, nor shall there ever be, a fairer leaf, and
> beneath the ocean of knowledge no pearl more wondrous can ever be found.24

‘Abdu’l-Baha (1844–1921), successor to, interpreter and exemplar of the teachings of his
father, Baha’u’llah (1817–92), prophet-founder of the Baha’i Faith, wrote: ‘O ye beloved of

the unity and the harmony (dar vaḥdat va yigānigī) of the human race, and that spiritual
and material developments are conditioned upon love and amity (ulfat va maḥabbat) among all
men.’25 Here, ‘unity’ (vaḥdat), ‘harmony’ (yigānigī), ‘amity’ (ulfat) and ‘love’ (muḥabbabat) are
roughly synonymous. In another passage, ‘Abdu’l-Baha writes of the overriding need of this day
and age:

> Today (imrūz) the one overriding need (ahamm-i umūr, lit. ‘most important affairs’) is
> unity and harmony (ittiḥād va ittifāq) among the beloved of the Lord, for they should have
> among them but one heart and soul (bā yik dīgar yik dil) and should, so far as in them lieth,
> unitedly withstand the hostility of all the peoples of the world; they must bring to an end
> the benighted prejudices of all nations and religions and must make known to every
> member of the human race that all are the leaves of one branch, the fruits of one bough.26

Consistent with the prescriptions propounded by Baha’u’llah as the divine physician for
this day and age, ‘Abdu’l-Baha, in a tablet revealed in January 1920 for the acclaimed Baha’i
journalist and teacher, Martha Root, likens religion to a medicine that can cure the disease of
fanaticism, or prejudice, in its various forms. But if religion itself becomes fanatical, then it has
ceased to be a remedy, having now become part of the disease that afflicts humanity. In such a
state, it would be better to be rid of the religion that is fuelling such turmoil:

> For religion (dīn) is like unto a remedy (’alāj).27 If the remedy (’alāj) causes disease
> (sabab-i maraḍ), it is better to abandon it (tark-i ‘alāj aḥsan ast).

Similarly, religious fanaticism (taʻaṣṣub-i dīnī), racial fanaticism (taʻaṣṣub-i jinsī),
national fanaticism (taʻaṣṣub-i vaṭanī), political fanaticism (taʻaṣṣub-i siyāsī) – all such

Applying the illness/cure soteriological analytical model in the phenomenology of religions
to the Baha’i Faith, it is clear that, from the Baha’i perspective, the human predicament, i.e. the
metaphorical ‘illness’ and ‘disease’ of society – is pervasive ‘estrangement’ and ‘disunity’ at all
levels of human society – from family relations to race relations to international relations – and
that the metaphorical ‘cure’ or ‘remedy’ is the promotion and implementation of Baha’i
principles of unity.

IV.   Piper’s Typology of Baha’i Principles of Unity

In 1943–4, Raymond Frank Piper attempted a typology of Baha’i principles of unity that was
quite well received and widely disseminated. A typology involves typification of a discrete set of
data, that is, imposing a classification system on that data set and structuring it by means of
categorical types. Probably the most well-known typology published by a Baha’i academic is
Alessandro Bausani’s ‘Notes for a typology of monotheism’, published in 1957.29 Methods for
generating typologies are generally underdeveloped, and may appear, more often than not, as a
rather arbitrary imposition of categories in order to organize and reduce a body of data, so that it

may be more readily comprehended and compared with other sets of commensurable data. Such
is the case with Piper’s typology of Baha’i principles of unity.

Piper (1888–1962) was professor of philosophy, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New
York.30 In 1920, Piper received his PhD in Philosophy from Boston University after defending
his dissertation, The Metaphysics of Personality in the Light of Recent American Philosophy.31
Since 1920, Piper had been teaching and writing on aesthetics, philosophy and comparative
religions. Prior to 5 October 1935, when he spoke on ‘The Quest for a Universal Religion’, it
was reported that Piper had travelled some 45,000 miles over 17 months and ‘interviewed 550
people, including such teachers as Krishnamurti, Rabindranath Tagore, Shoghi Effendi and
visited the birthplaces of various religions’.32 The purpose of this trip was to prepare ‘a
philosophical study of government, religion and art’.33 Some anecdotes surrounding that trip are
recounted in the biography of Piper’s second wife, Lila, which, oddly enough, is silent as to
Piper’s Baha’i affiliation, perhaps because Lila, as a missionary who taught in India for nine
years, was a committed Methodist. Both were active in the University United Methodist
Church.34

Piper’s last work, Cosmic Art, was completed by Lila and published in 1975.35 This was
preceded by his book, The Hungry Eye: An Introduction to Cosmic Art, which appeared in

1956.36 It is not clear when Piper became a Baha’i, but it was likely in 1936 or shortly before,
judging from the date of his first two Baha’i publications.37 His papers, archived by Syracuse
University, provide ample evidence of his wide-ranging research interests, including the subject
of the Baha’i Faith itself.38

Piper was a systematic thinker, as evidenced by the ambitious college textbook that he co-
authored in 1929: The Fields and Methods of Knowledge: A Textbook in Orientation and Logic.39
In like systematic fashion, Piper formulated a typology of Baha’i principles of unity. Piper’s
paradigm, ‘Ways to Wholeness’, was published in two instalments in World Order magazine.40
He later wrote: ‘My article on “Ways to Wholeness” (World Order, Dec., 1943; Jan., 1944) …
specified a dozen kinds of fruitful ethical unities which remain empty abstractions until
individual persons actualize, organize, embody them in action’.41 Piper specified 16 Baha’i
principles of unity, actually. They are:

The two instalments of ‘Ways to Wholeness’, enumerating and explicating some ‘sixteen
unities’, were evidently well received, as a special reprint of ‘Ways to Wholeness’ was prepared:
‘A special reprint of Dr. R. F. Piper’s ‘Ways to Wholeness’ was prepared for the Bureau, and over

200 copies were mailed out with a personal letter to educators.’42 An abridged version of ‘Ways
to Wholeness’ subsequently appeared in The Bahá’í World in 1945.43 The inclusion of Piper’s
article was significant in that The Bahá’í World volumes were the most important Baha’i
publications next to the authorized translations of Baha’i scriptures. Piper’s paradigm must not
only have gained the respect of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of the United
States and Canada, but also must have earned the approval of Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the
Baha’i Faith (1921–57), since he personally oversaw the publication of the Bahá’í World
volumes.

V.     Methodology of the Present Study

A typology of Baha’i principles of unity implicates an inchoate Baha’i theory of social cohesion,
which broadly may be defined as the solidarity, or ‘unity’, of a group. The Baha’i unity paradigm
aims at cultivating social cohesion at all levels of human society, from family relations to
international relations. Although there is no agreed definition of social cohesion, social cohesion
theories do, however, have three elements in common: (1) shared vision (universal values,
mutual respect and common aspirations or identity); (2) well-functioning of a group or
community (shared goals and responsibilities and readiness to cooperate with fellow members);
and (3) a process (an ongoing dynamic of achieving social harmony).44

Although Dr Piper’s typology enjoyed high-level approbation and was published widely
within the Baha’i context, it has all but been forgotten in the contemporary Baha’i world.
Perhaps it is not the substance of Piper’s typology itself that is of significance, but the fact that

he perceived the pervasive nature of the Baha’i principles of unity and their profound potential
for world reform.

As a preliminary investigation into the Baha’i illness/cure soteriology, with its paradigm of
unity, the methodology pursued in the present study is simply to inventory those Baha’i
principles that are directly presented as ‘unity of’ or ‘oneness of’ formulations, as indicated by
selected genitive constructions, or ‘of-constructions’ (i.e. the Persian/Arabic ‘iḍāfa) involving the
Persian/Arabic terms of ittiḥād, ittifāq, yigānigī, vaḥdat, ulfat, vaḥīd, etc.45

There are, in fact, numerous Baha’i ethical and social teachings. Unlike Piper’s selections,
however, the principles inventoried here are narrowly restricted to explicit principles of unity,
and further delimited to those that are authenticated in the original source languages, where
translated texts are marshalled as proof-texts.

Primary sources will therefore be consulted in the original Persian and Arabic source
languages (texts by Baha’u’llah and ‘Abdu’l-Baha) and, where applicable, in English (texts by
Shoghi Effendi). The relatively few texts in Ottoman Turkish (texts by ‘Abdu’l-Baha) are not
surveyed, however. Thus a typology of Baha’i principles of unity is arguably premature, unless
and until such principles are properly inventoried.

VI. Unity as Paramount in the Baha’i Value System

An inventory of Baha’i principles of unity should first be contextualized. These principles spring
from the premise that unity is paramount in the Baha’i value system. A single passage (with
transliteration of the original Persian text supplied by the present writer), should suffice in
underscoring the paramount importance of unity within the Baha’i hierarchy of values:

\[45\] !    In the Arabic linguistic tradition, the ‘iḍāfa (’annexation’/‘relation’, often referred to as a

> ‘genitive relation’ or ‘construct state’) is a grammatical construction that links two Arabic
> nouns in a noun phrase (tarkīb ismī), such that the second noun (definite) amplifies the first
> (indefinite). See Karen Ryding and Kees Versteegh, ‘ʾIḍāfa’, Encyclopedia of Arabic
> Language and Linguistics, Leiden: Brill, 2005, vol. 2, 43. In the Persian linguistic tradition,
> the ‘iḍāfa compound is represented with the postfix –i (except that when a word ends with a
> vowel, the postfix becomes –yi).

The utterance of God is a lamp (mishkāt-i bayān), whose light (miṣbāh) is these words (īn
> kalima): [’O peoples of the world! (ay ahl-i ‘ālam)’ – missing in translation.] Ye are the
> fruits of one tree, and the leaves of one branch (hama bār-i yik dārīd va barg-i yik
> shākhsār). Deal ye one with another with the utmost love (bi-kamāl-i maḥabbat) and har-
> mony (ittiḥād), with friendliness (mavaddat) and fellowship (ittifāq). He Who is the Day-
> Star of Truth beareth Me witness! So powerful is the light of unity (nūr-i ittifāq) that it can
> illuminate the whole earth (āfāq). … This goal excelleth every other goal (īn qaṣd sulṭān-i
> maqāsid, lit. ‘this goal [is] the king of all goals’), and this aspiration is the monarch of all
> aspirations (īn amal malik-i āmāl).46

The superlative expressions in this passage are not just rhetorical. They are quite literally
true insofar as they represent what may be regarded as not only the paramount Baha’i ideals, but
the fundamental orientation and organizing principles of Baha’i precept and praxis.

VII. Baha’i Principles of Unity

Piper’s ‘Ways to Wholeness’ was published in 1943–4. It is now some 68 years later (as of
2012). Piper’s paradigm, while attractive initially, has not ‘caught on’, so to speak, within
contemporary Baha’i discourse. Piper’s unity paradigm is but a historical footnote, little more
than a citation. A fuller and more natural order of Baha’i principles has been long overdue, if
indeed unity does have paramount importance in the Baha’i hierarchy of values.

It makes more sense to present Baha’i principles of unity roughly in order of their sources,
first by way of Baha’u’llah (1817–92), prophet-founder of the Baha’i Faith (i.e. the
‘Manifestation of God’ for this day and age according to Baha’i belief), then by ‘Abdu’l-Baha
(1844–1921), successor to Baha’u’llah, authorized interpreter and matchless exemplar of Baha’i
lived ideals, and finally by Shoghi Effendi (1897–1957), ‘Guardian’ of the Baha’i Faith
(successor to ‘Abdu’l-Baha).

VIII. Types of Unity as Propounded by Baha’u’llah: The Tablet of Unity (Lawḥ-i Ittiḥād)

> reference.bahai.org/fa/t/b/GWB/gwb-132.html.

The Tablet of Unity (Lawḥ-i Ittiḥād) is the fullest single statement by Baha’u’llah on the subject
of unity. A provisional translation by Moojan Momen was published in 2001.47 This tablet was
revealed by Baha’u’llah, during the ‘Akka period (1868–92), in response to a question posed by
Siyyid Asad’u’llāh of Rasht (in northern Iran): ‘Thou hast asked about unity (ittiḥād)’.48 This
tablet is dated sometime after c.1879 when Siyyid Asad’u’llah converted to the Baha’i Faith –
along with his four brothers (the ‘Sādāt-i Khams’) – through the efforts of the celebrated Baha’i
poet and teacher, Āqā ‘Alī-Ashraf-i-Lāhījānī, known by his sobriquet, ‘Andalīb
(’Nightingale’).49 Baha’u’llah expatiates on six or seven (depending on whether the last two are
read as one) kinds of unity, expounding on such aspects of unity as ‘religion’ (dīn),
‘speech’ (qawl), religious ‘acts’ (āmāl), ‘rank’ or ‘station’ (maqām), ‘souls’ (nufūs), and earthly
‘wealth’ (amvāl).

1\.       Unity in Religion (ittiḥād dar dīn): This first unity, which Baha’u’llah prioritizes
(perhaps for the benefit of the recipient), sets the context for the remaining types of unity.
Distinct from the plurality of ‘unity of religion’ (see below), ‘unity in religion’ is a singularity. It
is unity within the Baha’i community itself: ‘The first kind of unity is unity in religion (ittiḥād
dar dīn)’. Clearly, the questioner was not united with his own Baha’i community. Of Siyyid
Asad’u’llah, Mīrzā Yahyā ‘Amīdu’l-Atibbā Hamadānī, a contemporary, wrote: ‘Although he was

a believer, he hid his allegiance and strenuously avoided all the Baha’is of Rasht.’50 This may, in
part, explain why Baha’u’llah begins his discourse with the problem of consolidation within the
religious community.

Religious solidarity ‘has always been the cause of the victory of the Faith of God in every
age and century’, as Baha’u’llah underscores metaphorically: ‘Togetherness is the mystic sword
of God’.51 Here, what Momen translates as ‘togetherness’ is ijtimā‘, which Shahrokh Monjazeb
renders ‘assemblage of people’52 and Juan Cole as ‘gathering together’.53 This latter translation
has been used in official Baha’i translations, such as this sentence from the ‘Tablet of the
World’ (Lawḥ-i Dunyā): ‘The mere act of your gathering together is enough to scatter the forces
of these vain and worthless people.’54 Here, ‘gathering together’ is religious in nature.

Here, Momen translates saif-i maʻnavī-yi ilāhī as the ‘mystic sword of God’, where
Steingass glosses maʻnawī as ‘Significant; true, real, intrinsic, essential, absolute; spiritual’.55
This quintessential or real ‘sword’ (saif) is not a weapon of war. Rather, it is an instrument of
success. The ‘victory’ in the struggle to overcome religious division internally in order to

realizeth that the majority of its citizens have rent the veil asunder and directed themselves
toward the Horizon of God’s Revelation [i.e. Baha’u’llah] it would be compelled to take note and
listen.’56 For such to become a reality, other kinds of unity must come into play as well.

2\.     Unity in Speech (ittiḥād dar qawl): It stands to reason that a faith-community should
speak with one voice, and that its public discourse ought to truly reflect its social cohesion. ‘And
another kind of unity is unity in speech (ittiḥād dar qawl)’, Baha’u’llah writes. He explains that
internal dissension can foment discord and thus deprive the community of the inherent power of
its unity.

‘Unity in speech’ has three dimensions: (1) unity of discourse; (2) harmony of word and
deed; and (3) exercise of wisdom in speech. Here, Baha’u’llah speaks also of voluntary sharing
and of personal virtue. More effective than ideal discourse are ideal deeds: ‘That which aids the
One True God has always been and is words (bayān, lit. ‘explanation’), but in this most mighty
Dispensation, [goodly] deeds and a goodly character are the hosts of the One True God and are
responsible for the triumph of the Cause.’57 Thus the advancement of the Baha’i community is
coefficient with the degree to which its adherents contribute to the betterment of society.

3\.     Unity in [Ritual] Acts (ittiḥād-i ā’māl): This unity focuses not on deeds in general, but on
pious practices in particular, which can divide as well as unite: ‘And in another respect, unity in
[ritual] acts (ittiḥād-i āmāl) is intended. For any difference in these is the cause of disunity.’58
Monjazeb translates āmāl as ‘actions’59 and Cole as ‘deeds’.60

Baha’u’llah points to Islam as a case in point, having split over praxis. From the ‘ocean’
Islam have branched numerous ‘gulfs’: ‘Thus one gulf is Shi‘a, one gulf is Sunni, one Shaykhī,
another Shāh Ni‘matu’llāhī, one Naqshbandī, another Malāmatī, one Jalālī, another Rafā‘ī, and
yet another Kharābātī’. These sects and Sufi orders have compromised Islam: ‘Thus are
multiplied the innumerable pathways to hell. Thus do the stones weep and the Pen of the All-
High laments.’61 Monjazeb points out that the clear implication here is that differences of actions
(ikhtilāf-i āmāl), such as divergent modes of worship, etc., have led to the weakening of religion,
especially Islam.62 From this perspective, such pluralism has come at considerable cost, as the
Islamic world has forfeited its former role as a (medieval) superpower and is now in a state of
malaise. A parallel text that emphasizes power of the Baha’i revelation to promote
transconfessional affinity, i.e. ideal interfaith relations, is the following:

> The second question concerneth faith and religion (kīsh va āyīn). The Faith of God (kīsh-i
> yazdān) hath in this day been made manifest. He Who is the Lord of the world (jahāndār)
> is come and hath shown the way (rāh). His faith is the faith of benevolence and His
> religion is the religion of forbearance (kīsh-ash nīkūkārī va āyīn-ash burdbārī). This faith
> bestoweth eternal life (zindigī-yi pāyandih) and this religion enableth mankind to dispense
> with all else. It verily embraceth all faiths and all religions (īn kīsh va āyīn dārā-yi kīsh-
> hā va āyīn-hā-st). Take hold thereof and guard it well.63

While this text emphasizes intra-religious unity (i.e. unity within religion, i.e. a single
religion, the Baha’i Faith), other passages promote inter-religious unity (i.e. unity among
religions). (See principle #11, infra.)

4\.     Unity of Station (ittiḥād-i maqām): There is a shift now from assemblage to self: ‘And
amongst the realms of unity is the unity of rank and station’ (ittiḥād-i maqām)’. Here, ‘unity’

means ‘equality’ of station. The ideal demeanour of Baha’is is to see one’s own self in relation to
others, such that all people might ideally be on the same ‘plane’ (ṣuq‘) and station (maqām). If
this were truly put into practice, then ‘the world would become as the Abhá Paradise’.64 Thus
Paradise may be realized in the here-and-now, just as it may be gained in the Hereafter, if unity
of station is put into practice.

5\.     Unity of Souls (ittiḥād-i nufūs): Although treated as a distinct type of unity, ‘unity of souls’
bears some resemblance to ‘unity in religion’. The subtle difference here likely inheres in the
integrity of the faith-community in putting into practice professed ideals, as distinct from social
cohesion within the community itself: ‘The meaning of the unity of souls (ittiḥād-i nufūs) is that
all should gather around and cling to the Love of God and the Word of God.’65 Indeed, all of the
types of unity propounded in the Tablet of Unity interrelate, as explicitly stated in this passage:

> These unities (ittiḥād-hā) that We have mentioned are each an army among the hosts of
> God, a part of the party of God, and a command that is part of the Decree of God. The unity
> of souls (ittiḥād-i nufūs), from the beginning of creation until now, hath been and shall be
> that which doth assist and bring victory to the Truth – that is to say that unity that is
> established according to the Decree of God and His Law. In this station, unity does not
> exceed this degree.66

The next type of unity is more challenging because it involves a certain measure of
sacrifice in terms of one’s wealth.

> ahm-402.html.

6.   Unity of People and Wealth (ittiḥād-i nufūs va amvāl): Baha’u’llah concludes the
discourse on the several manifestations of unity within Baha’i communities so: ‘Another
example is the unity of souls and of wealth (ittiḥād-i nufūs va amvāl) and with this example we
will end our discourse on unity.’ Here, by ‘wealth’, Baha’u’llah means money, property, goods,
earthly possessions, etc. He exhorts people (nufūs) to be united so that they can give their wealth
(amvāl) to one another altruistically, as needed.

After acknowledging the virtues of equality, Baha’u’llah goes on to explain that voluntary
sharing (muvāsāt) ranks higher than equitable distribution of wealth (musāvāt). ‘This station
goes beyond just equality’ in that altruistic individuals who ‘prefer others over themselves have a
station that, in truth, is above this station, as has already been … revealed in the Qur’an’.
Baha’u’llah then cites Q. 59:9 as a proof-text (’and preferring others above themselves, even
though poverty be their portion …’).67 Baha’u’llah states that unity of wealth (ittiḥād-i amvāl) is
the source of cheer and joy and exultation and that, from it, the attribute of voluntary sharing –
that is, charitable giving (muvāsāt) – is manifested. Thus, the philanthropy of muvāsāt exceeds
the equitable distribution of wealth that is the reflex of musāvāt. On this principle, which has
limits, Shahrokh Monjazeb has commented:

> Baha’u’llah warns, however, that this act of ‘charitable giving’ is only limited to ‘earthly
> possession’ (māl) and nothing more. Baha’u’llah then states that this attribute (i.e. muvāsāt)
> ranks above ‘equality’ (musāvāt). He defines equality as when a person expends generously
> to his fellow men the material riches that God has bestowed upon him. … But the acts of
> those who prefer others over themselves is even nobler, for in this state the person is
> sacrificing his own material needs for the needs of others. … Baha’u’llah insists that the act
> of ‘charitable giving’ (muvāsāt) is only confined to material possessions. In fact, in another
> Tablet, in which He expounds on the meaning of muvāsāt, Baha’u’llah declares that the act

\[67\] !    Momen, ‘Tablet of Unity’ 97. Original Persian/Arabic tablet online at http://

of anyone who exceeds this limitation is considered before God only the result of the
prompting of his over-indulgent self and passion.68

Similarly, in his ‘Tablet to The Hague’, ‘Abdu’l-Baha states that ‘among the teachings of
Bahá’u’lláh is voluntary sharing of one’s property with others among mankind’, adding: ‘This
voluntary sharing is greater than equality, … [in] that man should not prefer himself to others,
but rather should sacrifice his life and property for others … and spend willingly for the poor,
just as is done in Persia among the Bahá’ís.’69

7\.     Unity of God (tawḥīd-i ilāhī): Baha’u’llah ends this tablet by reminding the recipient to
contemplate God: ‘Everyone must meditate upon God and in particular upon the Unity of God
(tawḥīd-i ilāhī)’.70 Tawḥīd, the doctrine of the Oneness of God, is the most fundamental concept
of monotheism in Islam. Meditating on the transcendence and mystery of God orients the
believer’s thoughts, in which the proverbial ‘brotherhood of man’ follows from the ‘fatherhood
of God’. This particular ‘unity’ (tawḥīd), it should be pointed out, is distinct from ittiḥād and its
synonyms. Whereas ittiḥād conveys the idea of unifying people, tawḥīd has no such meaning in
reference to God. In Baha’i doctrine, the unity of God transcends even intrinsic oneness, and so
is beyond numeric singularity. So, in a sense, it could be argued that the ‘unity of God’ cannot be
considered among the various kinds of unity enumerated in this paper, and certainly, in the Tablet
of Unity, Baha’u’llah does not conflate ittiḥād and tawḥīd. In popular Baha’i discourse, however,
the ‘Three Onenesses’ (of God, the Messengers of God, and humankind), are widely proclaimed
as the epitome of Baha’i belief. These three unities are formally expressed in the following
statement by Shoghi Effendi: ‘The Baha’i Faith upholds [1] the unity of God, recognizes [2] the

unity of His Prophets, and inculcates [3] the principle of the oneness and wholeness of the entire
human race.’71

IX. Types of Unity as Propounded by Baha’u’llah: Other Types of Unity

8\.     Unity of Existence (Oneness of Being) and Manifestation (Arabic: waḥdat al-wujūd wa
shuhūd/Persian: vaḥdat-i vujūd va shuhūd): The previous principle of unity should steer the
believer away from the pantheistic inclination of Sufi mystics who predicated their claims of
union with God (via such peak mystical experiences as beatific vision or divine audition) on
notions of divine immanence pervading creation.

In Baha’u’llah’s pre-eminent mystical work, The Seven Valleys (Haft Vādī), a Sufi doctrine
known as the ‘oneness of being’ and commonly construed as pantheism, is referenced: ‘In this
Valley, the wayfarer leaveth behind him the stages of the ‘oneness of Being and
Manifestation’ (vaḥdat-i vujūd va shuhūd) and reacheth a oneness (vaḥdat) that is sanctified
above these two stations. Ecstasy alone can encompass this theme, not utterance (bayān) nor
argument; and whosoever hath dwelt at this stage of the journey, or caught a breath from this
garden land, knoweth whereof We speak.’72

Here, this ‘oneness’ is not the ‘Unity of Existence and Manifestation’ per se, but rather
what is described as ‘a oneness that is sanctified above these two stations’ (emphasis added)
which has no name because it is beyond description, representing the pinnacle of mystical
experience, which is ineffable. Elsewhere, Baha’u’llah explains that true ‘unity of
vision’ (tawḥīd-i-shuhūdī) is witnessing God’s attributes and seeing the reflection of God’s
uniqueness in all things.73 Further to this line of discussion, ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s discourse on the

distinction between the Baha’i doctrine of ‘manifestation’ and the Sufi doctrine of
‘emanation’ (leading to pantheism) is illuminating, but ‘technical’ in its intricate elucidation of
the relevant Sufi metaphysical terms.74

9\.     Unity of the Manifestations of God (maqām-i tawḥīd): From the doctrine of the unity of
God, it follows that anything that emanates from God must likewise be a unity. This holds true
for any and all revelations from God. A major Baha’i doctrine is that of prophetic unity, wherein
all Messengers of God – such as Abraham, Moses, Christ and Muhammad in the Abraham faiths,
along with Zoroaster, Krishna and the Buddha in the Indo-Aryan religions, for instance – are
considered one in spirit and teachers of religious doctrines that are quintessentially harmonious,
as Baha’u’llah metaphorically writes in this oft-quoted passage:

> Inasmuch as these Birds of the Celestial Throne are all sent down from the heaven of the
> Will of God, and as they all arise to proclaim His irresistible Faith, they therefore are
> regarded as one soul and the same person. … Sayings such as this, which indicate the
> essential unity (tawḥīd) of those Exponents of Oneness, have also emanated from the
> Channels of God’s immortal utterance, and the Treasuries of the gems of divine knowledge,
> and have been recorded in the scriptures.75

This key doctrine is explained by Shoghi Effendi: ‘The Bahá’í Faith upholds the unity of
God, recognizes the unity of His Prophets, and inculcates the principle of the oneness and
wholeness of the entire human race.’76 These are the so-called ‘Three Onenesses’ in popular
Baha’i discourse. ‘Abdu’l-Baha explains in more detail: ‘We believe in that which Jesus Christ
and all the Prophets have believed. For example, the Báb states, “I am the return of all the
Prophets.” This is significant of the oneness of the prophetic virtues, the oneness of power, the

oneness of bestowal, the oneness of radiation, the oneness of expression, the oneness of
revelation.’77

10\.    Spiritual Oneness (vaḥdat-i rawḥānī): In the untranslated Persian section of the Tablet of
the Holy Mariner (the Arabic portion of which was the first complete tablet that Shoghi Effendi
translated following his appointment as the Guardian of the Baha’i Faith),78 there is a scene in
which the captain of the Baha’i ship of salvation, called the ‘Crimson Ark’, imparted a secret to
the dwellers of the Ark that transports them with such joy that they attain ‘spiritual oneness’ or
‘unity of spirit’.

In this extended Baha’i allegory, there came a decree from Heaven, which the ‘eternal
Mariner’ (mallāḥ-i baqā’) discloses to the shipmates (ahl-i fulk) – not in full, but in part –
divulging but a single letter from the mystic, arcane word (ḥarfī az kalima-yi ikhfā’) sent from
Heaven, so that, with assistance from the invisible realm, these seafarers might pass through the
Valley of Bewilderment of their lower natures (vādī-yi ḥayrat-i nafsānī), enter into the joyous
atmosphere of spiritual oneness (vaḥdat-i rawḥānī), and reach the summit of the divine Qāf of
Immortality (qāf-i baqā’-yi jān) [mystic mountain thought to be in Qafqāz], to attain the
presence of the Beloved (liqā‘-i haḍrat-i jānān), who is Baha’u’llah.79

Of course, the reader who has little or no familiarity with the Tablet of the Holy Mariner
will not understand this allegory, but it is nevertheless recounted here in the course of
cataloguing the various Baha’i principles of unity.

11\.   Unity/Peace Among Religions (sabab-i ulfat bayn-i adyān/ṣuḥul bayn-i adyān): This
Baha’i principle of unity is inferred from such passages as the following, which is from the
‘Tablet of Ornaments’ (Lawḥ-i Ṭarazāt) where ‘ornaments’ metaphorically refer to attributes of a
goodly and godly character:

> The second Ṭaráz is to consort with the followers of all religions (muʻāsharat bā adyān) in
> a spirit of friendliness and fellowship (bi-rawḥ va rayḥān), to proclaim (iẓhār) that which
> the Speaker on Sinai (mukallam al-ṭūr, i.e. the Manifestation/Interlocutor of God) hath set
> forth and to observe fairness (inṣāf) in all matters.

They that are endued with sincerity and faithfulness (aṣḥāb-i ṣafā va vafā) should
> associate (bāyad … muʻāsharat namāyand) with all the peoples and kindreds of the earth
> (bā jamī‘-i ahl-i ‘ālam) with joy and radiance (bi-rūuḥ va rayḥān), inasmuch as consorting
> (muʻāsharat) with people hath promoted and will continue to promote unity and concord
> (sabab-i ittiḥād va ittifāq), which in turn are conducive to the maintenance of order in the
> world (ittiḥād va ittifāq sabab-i niẓām-i ‘ālam) and to the regeneration of nations (ḥayāt-i
> umam). Blessed (ṭūbā) are such as hold fast to the cord of kindliness and tender mercy
> (ḥabl-i shafaqat va ra‘fat) and are free from animosity and hatred (ẓaghīnih va baghẓā).80

In this remarkable passage (that is, noteworthy with respect to the scriptures of world
religions generally), the term ‘rayḥān’ literally means ‘fragrance’ and refers to the herb, sweet
basil, a spice that has its own pleasant aroma. Steingass defines rayḥān as ‘sweet basil; any
odoriferous herb’.81 Here, the purport of the metaphor is given, rather than its literal translation.

\[81\] !     Steingass, Persian-English Dictionary 601.

Friendly association with adherents of religions other than one’s own co-religionists is no
guarantor of interfaith concord, of course, but certainly it is a step in the right direction. From
this standpoint, it has been suggested that muʻāsharat is a ‘precursor’ to ittiḥād.82

One barrier to interfaith co-fraternity is the law of ritual impurity, where contact with
adherents of other religions must be minimized for fear of contamination. Baha’u’llah
proclaimed that this barrier, in principle (and thus, eventually, in practice), has been abolished:

> God hath, likewise, as a bounty from His presence, abolished the concept of ‘uncleanness’,
> whereby divers things and peoples have been held to be impure. … Verily, all created
> things were immersed in the sea of purification when, on that first day of Riḍván, We shed
> upon the whole of creation the splendours of Our most excellent Names and Our most
> exalted Attributes. … Consort (‘āshirū) ye then with the followers of all religions (al-
> adyān), and proclaim ye the Cause of your Lord, the Most Compassionate; this is the very
> crown of deeds, if ye be of them who understand.83

Here, Baha’u’llah categorically abolishes the Islamic law of ritual impurity, whereby
certain things (and people) are declared to be defiling (najis) when, if touched, will alter a
Muslim’s state of ritual purity by contamination. In Shi‘i teaching, moreover, non-Muslim
minorities are deemed ritually impure. Restrictions were thus imposed on Zoroastrians, Jews and
Christians so that Muslims could avoid pollution by unwanted contact. The result was avoidance
at the cost of social solidarity. No society could be truly egalitarian under such alienating
practices. By sweeping away this pejorative category and its oppressive practices, Baha’u’llah, in
theory if not in practice, opened the way to social rapprochement across intercommunal
boundaries within predominantly Muslim societies and thereby reducing, if not eliminating
sectarian strife over time.

A corollary of the principle of unity among religions is that of peace among religions.

Baha’u’llah’s first legislative act, in fact, was the abolition of holy war (jihād). Notwithstanding,

‘Abdu’l-Baha (see below) wrote of the continuing problem of ‘war among the religions’.84 In a
tablet addressed to the ‘Congress of Religions’ (kungrih-yi adyān), ‘Abdu’l-Baha states that what
is needed is ‘peace among religions’ (sabab-i ṣulḥ bayn adyān shavad).85 In other words, unity
among religions is an essential prerequisite to world peace. This tablet was addressed to the
Unitarian minister, Dr Charles William Wendte (1844–1931), secretary of the sixth International
Congress of Religious Progress, held in Paris from on 16–22 July 1913, and to which ‘Abdu’l-
Baha was invited to participate.86 In fact, ‘Abdu’l-Baha was invited, in person, by the French
members of the organizing committee during a visit to the Protestant Theological Faculty in
Paris in 1913. The fact that Dr Wendt is addressed by name it means that ‘Abdu’l-Baha must
have received a written invitation as well.87 This tablet was first published in the Persian section
of Star of the West.88 An English translation may be found in Abdul Baha on Divine
Philosophy,89 and in Abdul Baha in Egypt,90 although the two translations differ somewhat. On

Baha’is expect that, over the course of time, affinity among religions will increase to the
point that differences will be subordinated to common denominators shared by most, if not all
major world religions, which, in any case, are expected to ultimately merge as part of the future
golden age of world civilization that the Baha’i texts envision. Thus, ‘unity among religions’ will
culminate in ‘unity in religion’. Peace among religions is part of the agenda of the Lesser Peace,
a term that Baha’i texts use to describe the process of progressive reconciliation among nations
and improved international relations as the world advances in its social evolution, eventually

X. Types of Unity as Defined by ‘Abdu’l-Baha: The Seven Candles of Unity

‘Abdu’l-Baha (1844–1921) was Baha’u’llah’s eldest son, appointed successor, authorized
interpreter and perfect exemplar of Baha’i ideals. Perfectly consistent with Baha’u’llah’s
teachings above, ‘Abdu’l-Baha emphasized the importance of unity:

> It is certain that the greatest of instrumentalities for achieving the advancement and the
> glory of man, the supreme agency for the enlightenment and the redemption of the world, is
> love and fellowship and unity among all the members of the human race. Nothing can be
> effected in the world, not even conceivably, without unity and agreement, and the perfect
> means for engendering fellowship and union is true religion.92

Just as the Tablet of Unity is the single most important statement on unity by Baha’u’llah,
the tablet known as the ‘Seven Candles of Unity’ is the single most important statement on unity
by ‘Abdu’l-Baha. In a tablet (dated 1906) written for Jane Elizabeth Whyte (1857–1944), an
ardent sympathizer of the Baha’i Faith, if the first native Baha’i in Scotland,93 ‘Abdu’l-Baha
presages seven types of world ‘unity’ that will eventually come to pass:

> O honoured lady!… Behold how its [unity’s] light is now dawning upon the world’s
> darkened horizon. The first candle is unity in the political realm, the early glimmerings of
> which can now be discerned. The second candle is unity of thought in world undertakings,
> the consummation of which will erelong be witnessed. The third candle is unity in freedom
> which will surely come to pass. The fourth candle is unity in religion which is the corner-
> stone of the foundation itself, and which, by the power of God, will be revealed in all its

splendour. The fifth candle is the unity of nations – a unity which in this century94 will be
> securely established, causing all the peoples of the world to regard themselves as citizens of
> one common fatherland. The sixth candle is unity of races, making of all that dwell on earth
> peoples and kindreds of one race. The seventh candle is unity of language, i.e., the choice
> of a universal tongue in which all peoples will be instructed and converse. Each and every
> one of these will inevitably come to pass, inasmuch as the power of the Kingdom of God
> will aid and assist in their realization.95

Here, the seven ‘candles of unity’ are the motive force in the social evolution of the planet
that will culminate in the establishment of a global commonwealth, leading to a future golden
age of world civilization. In Century of Light (an official Baha’i statement commissioned by the
Universal House of Justice), the authors conclude that much of this remarkable prophetic passage
has, in fact, already come to pass: ‘While it will be decades – or perhaps a great deal longer –
before the vision contained in this remarkable document is fully realized, the essential features of
what it promised are now established facts throughout the world.’96

12\.    Unity in the Political Realm (vaḥdat-i siyāsat): ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s vision of the future, based
the prescience of insight and foresight, begins with a prediction of political unity: ‘The first
candle is unity in the political realm (vaḥdat-i siyāsat), the early glimmerings of which can now
be discerned’.97 This first ‘candle of unity’ is ‘a unity which politically independent and

sovereign states achieve among themselves’.98 In Century of Light, the authors note that political
unity was institutionally realized in the establishment of the United Nations: ‘As to “unity in the
political realm”, Shoghi Effendi has explained that the reference is to unity which sovereign
states achieve among themselves, a developing process the present stage of which is the
establishment of the United Nations.’99 The UN is far from perfect, but its formation was a
landmark achievement.

13\.     Unity of Thought (vaḥdat-i ārā) in World Undertakings: The next global development
foreseen by ‘Abdu’l-Baha is that of international cooperation: ‘The second candle is unity of
thought (vaḥdat-i ārā) in world undertakings, the consummation of which will erelong be
witnessed.’100 The authors of Century of Light observe that this prediction, for the most part, has
already taken place: ‘“Unity of thought in world undertakings”, a concept for which the most
idealistic aspirations at the opening of the twentieth century lacked even reference points, is also
in large measure everywhere apparent in vast programmes of social and economic development,
humanitarian aid and concern for protection of the environment of the planet and its oceans.’101
Thus this part of ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s vision is largely realized as well.

14\.     Unity in Freedom (vaḥdat-i āzādī): ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s next predicate, in the form of a
prediction, is the burgeoning desire for freedom and independence and national self-
determination worldwide: ‘The third candle is unity in freedom (vaḥdat-i āzādī) which will
surely come to pass.’102 In Century of Light, the authors note that this urge to freedom is now a

global phenomenon: ‘“Unity in freedom” has today, of course, become a universal aspiration of
the Earth’s inhabitants.’ The authors point to the end of the colonial era and the various freedom
movements that have since arisen: ‘Among the chief developments giving substance to it, the
Master may well have had in mind the dramatic extinction of colonialism and the consequent rise
of self-determination as a dominant feature of national identity at century’s end.’103 By and large,
this aspect of ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s vision has been fulfilled as well.

15\.     Unity in Religion (vaḥdat-i dīnī): ‘Abdu’l-Baha next writes of unity in religion: ‘The
fourth candle is unity in religion (vaḥdat-i dīnī) which is the corner-stone of the foundation itself,
and which, by the power of God, will be revealed in all its splendour.’104 (This principle is
closely related to principle #1 above, the distinction being that the latter concerns unity within
the Baha'i religion, where as this instant unity is of world religions in general.) In Century of
Light, the authors indicate that the world has witnessed great progress insofar as unity in religion
is concerned: ‘In several of the great changes envisioned – unity of race and unity of religion –
the intent of the Master’s words is clear and the processes involved are far advanced, however
great may be the resistance in some quarters.’105

The ‘process’ spoken of here appears to be a growing appreciation of the quintessential
unity of religions, as Shoghi Effendi has said: ‘He is happy to hear of your great devotion to the
Cause of Bahá’u’lláh and how clearly you have grasped the fundamental truth that all the
Prophets are from One Essence and one in spirit. This is one of the greatest blessings the Faith
has to offer to people – the knowledge of the unity of all religions.’106

The reference here appears to be primarily about harmony among religions, in the context
of religious pluralism, through the abolition of religious prejudices, and, secondarily, to unity

within religion, that is, within the Baha’i religion. While those who embrace the Baha’i Faith hail
from all religious backgrounds and experience intra-religious unity, the purpose of the Baha’i
religion is to promote unity, both within and without. Teaching the fundamental harmony of all
religions serves to foster interfaith reciprocity.

16\.     Unity of Nations (vaḥdat-i vaṭan): ‘Abdu’l-Baha gives assurance of the eventual unity of
nations, which is distinct from political unity: ‘The fifth candle is the unity of nations (vaḥdat-i
vaṭan) – a unity which in this century107 will be securely established, causing all the peoples of
the world to regard themselves as citizens of one common fatherland.’108 This fifth ‘candle of
unity’, according to Shoghi Effendi, ‘is one which is brought about between nations, the
difference between a state and a nation being that the former, as you know, is a political entity
without necessarily being homogeneous in race, whereas the second implies national as well as
political homogeneity.’109

After referring to Shoghi Effendi’s statement just cited, the authors of Century of Light note
that this prediction of ‘Abdu’l-Baha is progressively becoming a social reality: ‘The Master’s
promise of “unity of nations”, on the other hand, looked forward to today’s widespread
acceptance among the peoples of the world of the fact that, however great the differences among
them may be, they are the inhabitants of a single global homeland.’110

age or era, rather than a hundred years in a particular calendar.

17.     Unity of Races (vaḥdat-i jins): ‘The sixth candle is unity of races (vaḥdat-i jins), making
of all that dwell on earth peoples and kindreds of one race’.111 Elsewhere, ‘Abdu’l-Baha urges
the Baha’is to perfect their unity, irregardless of race or ethnicity, so that the Baha’i community
can offer a living model of unity that transcends such superficial distinctions:

> Strive with heart and soul in order to bring about union and harmony among the white and
> the black and prove thereby the unity (vaḥdat) of the Bahá’í world wherein distinction of
> colour findeth no place, but where hearts only are considered. Praise be to God, the hearts
> of the friends are united and linked together, whether they be from the east or the west,
> from north or from south, whether they be German, French, Japanese, American, and
> whether they pertain to the white, the black, the red, the yellow or the brown race.
> Variations of colour, of land and of race are of no importance in the Bahá’í Faith; on the
> contrary, Bahá’í unity overcometh them all and doeth away with all these fancies and
> imaginations.112

In Century of Light, the authors comment that ‘the processes involved’ in the ‘unity of race’
are ‘far advanced’.113

18\.     Unity of Language (vaḥdat-i lisān): ‘The seventh candle is unity of language (vaḥdat-i
lisān), i.e., the choice of a universal tongue in which all peoples will be instructed and
converse.’114 In Century of Light, the authors observe that ‘the processes involved’ in achieving
‘unity of language’ are ‘far advanced’ while the need for formal adoption of a universal auxiliary
language remains:

Whether or not English emerges not only as the de facto international language, but one by
universal acclaim, remains to be seen.

XI. Types of Unity as Defined by ‘Abdu’l-Baha: Other Types of Unity

19\.     Unity of All Mankind/World Unity (ittifāq-i kull va ittiḥād-i ‘umūm): The overarching
principle of Baha’i teachings is the consciousness of the oneness of humankind: ‘Hence the unity
of all mankind (ittifāq-i kull va ittiḥād-i ‘umūm) can in this day be achieved. Verily this is none
other but one of the wonders of this wondrous age, this glorious century.’116 Commenting on this
principle, Shoghi Effendi states that world unity is the next stage in the world’s social evolution:
‘Unification of the whole of mankind is the hall-mark of the stage which human society is now
approaching.’117 ‘Up to the present Unity of Mankind was only of an academic importance,’
Shoghi Effendi elsewhere states, ‘Now it is becoming more and more a subject for international
statesmen to think of. … It is therefore a wonderful chance for us to come to the front and
expound the teaching which is the goal and aim of the social precepts of Bahá’u’lláh’.118

20.   Unity of Species (vaḥdat-i jins): Appeals to nature are commonly met with in ‘Abdu’l-
Baha’s discourse. This is one example, from ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s Howard University speech in
Rankin Chapel on 23 April 1912:

> Often a white dove soars aloft with a black one. Throughout the animal kingdom we do not
> find the creatures separated because of color. They recognize unity of species and oneness
> of kind. If we do not find color distinction drawn in a kingdom of lower intelligence and
> reason, how can it be justified among human beings, especially when we know that all have
> come from the same source and belong to the same household? In origin and intention of
> creation mankind is one. Distinctions of race and color have arisen afterward.119

Although the Persian original of this historically poignant speech is available, with every
likelihood that this Persian text accurately represents the speech verbatim, vol. 2 of Khiṭābāt is
not authenticated and therefore not authoritative (although Shoghi Effendi quotes this passage
with approval.120 Fortunately, there are authoritative texts that convey the same idea, such as this:

‘But the docile, good-natured and gentle animals, whether they belong to the flying or grazing
species, associate with one another in complete affinity, united in their flocks, and living their
lives with enjoyment, happiness and contentment.’121 While ‘unity of species’ is not a positive
Baha’i principle of unity that can be put into practice, this appeal to the animal kingdom (which,
as stated, draws no distinction as to colour) is calculated to elevate prejudice-ridden mindsets
from what is essentially an animalistic tendency, yet one which finds no counterpart in the
natural world as to racial distinctions.

21\.   Unity of Truth (vaḥdat-i ḥaqīqat): The reality of the human predicament and its solution,
from the Baha’i perspective, will become increasingly obvious as the world, impelled by the
forces of its social evolution, advances ever closer to its inevitable integration. With confidence,
‘Abdu’l-Baha expresses hope that ‘the unity of truth (vaḥdat-i ḥaqīqat), through the power of
God, will make these illusory differences to vanish away’, such that, over time, truth becomes
self-evident. Truth is seen as a necessary adjunct of unity, largely because disunity is the outcome
of illusion, such as the pernicious notions of racial, national or religious superiority. ‘This is the
one essential,’ ‘Abdu’l-Baha goes on to say, ‘for if unity be gained, all other problems will
disappear of themselves.’122

22\.   Unity of Conscience (vaḥdat-i vujdān): The question of peace requires ‘unity of
conscience’ in reaching consensus:

> There is not one soul whose conscience does not testify that in this day there is no more
> important matter in the world than that of universal peace. … [U]ntil the minds of men
> become united, no important matter can be accomplished. At present universal peace is a
> matter of great importance, but unity of conscience (vaḥdat-i vujdān) is essential. …

\[122\] !     ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections 30. Original Persian/Arabic tablet online at http://

Therefore Bahá’u’lláh, fifty years ago, expounded this question of universal peace at a time
when He was confined in the fortress of ‘Akká and was wronged and imprisoned.123

Freedom of conscience is a related Baha’i principle, but, here, the need for consensus on
matters of world-historical importance is stressed.

23\.     All-Unifying Power (jihat-i jāmiʻih): While a departure from the terminology used so far,
the Baha’i concept of an ‘All-Unifying Power’ is important, as it conveys the source of authority
– and the unity and integrity – of the Baha’i community itself. In the Tablet to August Forel,
Swiss scientist (1848–1931), ‘Abdu’l-Baha, in setting forth a logical proof of the existence of
God, writes of the ‘all-unifying agency (jihat-i jāmiʻih) known as the human soul’,124 and
analogizes this to God as the ‘all-unifying Power (jihat-i jāmiʻih)’ of the universe, which
agencies operate to ‘connect and harmonize these diverse and infinite realities’.125 Elsewhere, in
Tablets of the Divine Plan, after speaking of various kinds of ‘collective centers’ (an alternative
translation to ‘All-Unifying Power’) – patriotism, nationalism, identity of interests, political
alliance, union of ideals, etc. – ’Abdu’l-Baha writes of the Baha’i ‘Collective Center’ that
embodies its institutions and teachings:

> But the Collective Center (jihat-i jāmiʻih) of the Kingdom, embodying the institutions and
> divine teachings, is the eternal Collective Center. It establishes a relationship between the
> East and the West, organizes the oneness of the world of humanity, and destroys the
> foundation of differences. … Consequently, the real Collective Center is the body of the

divine teachings, which include all the degrees and embrace all the universal relations and
necessary laws of humanity.126

A synonym for ‘Collective Center’ would be the Baha’i ‘Covenant’, a term that adumbrates
fidelity to the authority of the Baha’i ‘Central Figures’ (the Bab, Baha’u’llah, ‘Abdu’l-Baha), the
Baha’i institutions (The Guardianship, i.e. Shoghi Effendi as ‘The Guardian of the Cause of
God’, the Universal House of Justice, national, regional and local spiritual assemblies), and
Baha’i laws and ethics.

24\.   Unity of Science and Religion (vaḥdat-i ‘ilm va dīn): The harmony and complementarity
of science and religion is a bedrock principle of Baha’i belief:

> For every era hath a spirit; the spirit of this illumined era lieth in the teachings of
> Bahá’u’lláh. … They are founded upon the unity of science and religion (vaḥdat-i ‘ilm va
> dīn) and upon investigation of truth. They uphold the principle that religion must be the
> cause of amity, union and harmony among men. They establish the equality of both sexes
> and propound economic principles which are for the happiness of individuals. They diffuse
> universal education, that every soul may as much as possible have a share of knowledge.
> They abrogate and nullify religious, racial, political, patriotic and economic prejudices and
> the like. Those teachings that are scattered throughout the Epistles and Tablets are the cause
> of the illumination and the life of the world of humanity.127

Given that these are among the most important of Baha’i principles, privileging the ‘unity
of science and religion (vaḥdat-i ‘ilm va dīn)’ is noteworthy, if not remarkable, given the fact that
the Baha’i religion appears to be the only religion that has adopted this principle as a core belief.
As with religion, the purpose of science is to further the unity and progress of the human race, as
Baha’u’llah states: ‘O people of Bahá! The source of crafts, sciences and arts is the power of
reflection. Make ye every effort that out of this ideal mine there may gleam forth such pearls of

wisdom and utterance as will promote the well-being and harmony of all the kindreds of the
earth.’

25\.     Unity of the Rights of Men and Women (vaḥdat-i huqūq-i rijāl va nisā’): In the passage
cited above, ‘equality of both sexes’, that is, gender equality, is presented by ‘Abdu’l-Baha as
one of the foremost principles of Baha’i precept and praxis. This same teaching is commonly met
with in other passages, such as this:

> Bahá’u’lláh proclaimed equality of the sexes (literally, ‘oneness of the rights of men and
> women’ (vaḥdat-i huqūq-i rijāl va nisā’)) – that both man and woman are servants of God
> before Whom there is no distinction. … Equality of the sexes will be established in
> proportion to the increased opportunities afforded woman in this age, for man and woman
> are equally the recipients of powers and endowments from God, the Creator. God has not
> ordained distinction between them in His consummate purpose.128

Here, the teaching that men and women are equal is shorthand for their equality of rights
and opportunities, although differences between the sexes tend to be de-emphasized in Baha’i
discourse, especially as regards the education of boys and girls. Education, in fact, is seen as the
single most pragmatic and direct approach in promoting gender equality. ‘He promulgated the
adoption of the same course of education for man and woman’, ‘Abdu’l-Baha proclaimed.
‘Daughters and sons must follow the same curriculum of study, thereby promoting unity of the
sexes.’129 ‘Abdu’l-Baha goes on to say that the education of women will be the single greatest
factor in the abolition of war.

26\.     Unity in Education (vaḥdat-i uṣūl va qavānīn-i tarbiyat): Universal compulsory education
is another core Baha’i belief, and the curriculum must be the same, irrespective of gender,
according to ‘Abdu’l-Baha:

Eighth, education is essential, and all standards of training and teaching (vaḥdat-i usūl va

> and agreement; a universal curriculum (tarbiyat-i vāḥidih) should be established, and the
> basis of ethics be the same (yik usūl va adab).130

There is a direct relationship between this Baha’i principle of unity and the preceding one:
‘He promulgated the adoption of the same (vaḥdat) course of education for man and woman.
Daughters and sons must follow the same curriculum of study, thereby promoting unity (ittiḥād)
of the sexes’, ‘Abdu’l-Baha declares, with the result that: ‘When all mankind shall receive the
same opportunity of education and the equality (vaḥdat) of men and women be realized, the
foundations of war will be utterly destroyed.’131

The source on which this Baha’i principle of unity is based requires some explanation,
which will raise an important issue regarding the methodology of the present study. Every effort
has been made to validate each of the Baha’i principles of unity in an authenticated original
Persian or Arabic text, except for the several Baha’i principles of unity that were articulated by
Shoghi Effendi in English as the original language (infra). A collection of the Persian speeches
by ‘Abdu’l-Baha delivered in Europe, America and Canada from 1911 to 1913 was published in
Majmū‘ih-yi Khiṭābāt Ḥaḍrat-i ‘Abdu’l-Bahā fī Ūrūpā va Āmrīkā (hereafter, Khiṭābāt;

‘Abdu’l-Baha’s approval,132 whereas volumes 2 and 3 have not been similarly authenticated,
although their reliability is certainly superior to the stenographic notes that were set down in
English as a result of contemporaneous translation. Thus any of these Baha’i principles of unity
that invoke volumes 2 or 3 of Khiṭābāt require additional attestation.133

Fortunately, a number of authenticated texts directly bear on the Baha’i principle of ‘unity
in education’, although not necessarily using that particular expression. One example will
suffice: ‘Ignorance is thus utterly to be blamed, whether in male or female; indeed, in the female
its harm is greater. I hope, therefore, that the friends will make strenuous efforts to educate their
children, sons and daughters alike.’134

27\.     Unity of Husband and Wife (vaḥdat): Although this is a separate principle, unity of
husband and wife is capable of fulfilment if true equality exists between husband and wife, and if

that unity is spiritual as well as physical: ‘Among the people of Bahá, however, marriage must be
a union of the body and of the spirit as well, … for if the marriage is based both on the spirit and
the body, that union (vaḥdat) is a true one, hence it will endure.’135

28\.     Unity of the Family (ittiḥād va ittifāq dar miyān-i khāndān): In a Baha’i perspective, the
family is considered the fundamental unit of society: ‘Bahá’u’lláh came to bring unity to the
world, and a fundamental unity is that of the family.’136 If society is an aggregate of families,
then family unity is an index of social cohesion. ‘Note ye how easily, where unity existeth in a
given family (ittiḥād va ittifāq dar miyān-i khāndān), the affairs of that family are conducted’,
‘Abdu’l-Baha observes, ‘what progress the members of that family make, how they prosper in
the world.’137

29\.     Baha’i Unity (vaḥdat-i Bahā’ī): this principle of unity is closely related to principle #1, yet
maybe distinguished by its emphasis on organic unity, through the power of ‘the Covenant’,
which is adherence to decisions promulgated by the elected institutions: ‘Do not disrupt Bahá’í
unity (vaḥdat-i Bahā’ī), and know that this unity cannot be maintained save through faith in the
Covenant of God.’138 ‘Abdu’l-Baha gives assurances that the Baha´i model of unity will attract
the world at large if Baha’i ideals are authentically put into practice and become a lived reality.
‘If once the beauty of the unity (vaḥdat) of the friends – this Divine Beloved – be decked in the

adornments of the Abhá Kingdom’, ‘Abdu’l-Baha assures us, ‘it is certain that within a very
short time those countries will become the Paradise of the All-Glorious, and that out of the west
the splendours of unity will cast their bright rays over all the earth.’139

> from north or from south, whether they be German, French, Japanese, American, and
> whether they pertain to the white, the black, the red, the yellow or the brown race.140

Moral authenticity is needed before Baha’i ideals can be respected and taken seriously by
the world at large:

> Today the one overriding need is unity and harmony (ittiḥād va ittifāq-i aḥibbā-yi ilāhī)
> among the beloved of the Lord, for they should have among them but one heart and soul
> (yik dil va yik jān) and should, so far as in them lieth, unitedly withstand the hostility of all
> the peoples of the world (ahl-i ‘ālam); they must bring to an end the benighted prejudices
> of all nations and religions and must make known to every member of the human race that
> all are the leaves of one branch, the fruits of one bough. Until such time, however, as the
> friends establish perfect unity (ittiḥād va ittifāq) among themselves, how can they summon
> others to harmony and peace (ittiḥād va ittifāq)?141

This dynamic relationship between internal and external unity is reinforced, time and again,
in the Baha’i writings. ‘Today the most remarkable favour of God centereth around union and
harmony (ittiḥād va ittifāq) among the friends’, ‘Abdu’l-Baha explains, ‘so that this unity and
concord (ittiḥād va ittifāq) may be the cause (sabab) of the promulgation of the oneness of the

world of humanity (vaḥdat-i ‘ālam-i insānī), may emancipate the world from this intense
darkness of enmity and rancour, and that the Sun of Truth may shine in full and perfect
effulgence.’142 The world needs an exemplary community as a model of unity, and the Baha’i
community endeavours to live up to its ideals of harmonious and progressive social life.

30\.     Unity among Baha’i Women (al-ittiḥād wa’l-ittifāq): While this Baha’i principle of unity
may be considered to be a subset of the previous one, ‘Abdu’l-Baha exhorts the ‘spreading the
spirit of unity (al-ittiḥād wa’l-ittifāq) among His handmaids’143 as a worthy endeavour with its
own intrinsic value. This text is authenticated, and finds further support in several ‘reported
utterances’ much in the same vein. ‘The news concerning the unity, harmony, affinity and
oneness of the maid-servants of the Merciful One and the friends of God in those parts, imparted
the utmost joy and happiness (to me),’ ‘Abdu’l-Baha exclaimed. ‘This indicated that the Cause
will before long yield results in that country.’144

31\.     Oneness of Emotions (iḥsāsāt-i vāḥidih): In a talk given on the morning of 9 June 1912 at
the Unitarian Church, Fifteenth Street and Girard Avenue, in Philadelphia, ‘Abdu’l-Baha ends his
speech with this prediction: ‘All will become as one family, one people, and the same
susceptibility to the divine bounty and education will be witnessed among mankind.’145 A Persian
transcription for this speech exists. In the Persian original, in a single sentence, ‘Abdu’l-Baha
enumerates seven types of unity: (1) One Family (’a’ila-yi vāḥidih); (2) One Nation (millat-i
vāḥidih); (3) One People (jins-i vāḥid); (4) One Nation/Homeland (vatan-i vāḥid); (5) One
Political System (siyāsat-i vāḥid); (6) Oneness of Emotions (iḥsāsāt-i vāḥidih); (7) Oneness of

Education (tarbiyat-i vāḥidih).146 This statement is remarkable for its rhetorical stress on the
importance of social cohesion at every level of society which are, at any rate, interrelated.
‘Oneness of Emotions’ is understood by the present writer as the power of empathy, by which
human beings become alive to the needs and sufferings of others, and are motivated to provide
assistance thereby.

32\.     Unity of the Nations/International Unity (vaḥdat-i ‘ālam-i insānī): ‘Today the world of
humanity is in need of international unity (vaḥdat) and conciliation (vaḥdat-i ‘ālam-i insānī)’.147
Although there is a Persian original for this statement, volume 2 of Khiṭābāt is not authenticated
and therefore not authoritative. There are authoritative texts that convey the same idea,
conveying the teaching that, once ‘the oneness of the world of humanity’ is accepted worldwide,
then ‘peace and universal reconciliation’ will come to pass, such that ‘the pavilion of the unity of
nations may cast its shadow over all regions’.148

33\.     Unity of the Spiritual Assembly (yigānigī): Just as each Baha’i community should be
united and supportive of the elected local spiritual assembly (Baha’i consultative council), the
members of that institution itself should be united, as their efficacy depends upon it. ‘The first
condition is absolute love and harmony amongst the members of the assembly’, ‘Abdu’l-Baha
counsels, adding: ‘They must be wholly free from estrangement and must manifest in themselves
the Unity (yigānigī) of God.’149

34.     Unity of The Universal House of Justice and Governments: The Baha’i community is
administered by elected councils at the local, national and international levels. The supreme
Baha’i institution is the Universal House of Justice, first elected in April 1963 at the Baha’i
World Centre in Haifa, Israel. The Baha’i administrative order aspires not only to serve as a well-
functioning administrative order, but also to evolve into a model of good governance. Thus, if
and when Baha’is reach a majority in any given country, the will of the majority would be to turn
that model of good governance into an institution of the government. This would only happen as
the result of a democratic process, and the rights of non-Baha’i minorities would be respected
and safeguarded as a matter of principle and as an ethic of justice. Long before the Universal
House of Justice came into actual existence, it was originally conceived by Baha’u’llah and
elaborated on by ‘Abdu’l-Baha, who stated that the future House of Justice and Baha’i
governments must cooperate with ideal harmony in applying Baha’i principles of justice:

> And now, concerning the House of Justice which God hath ordained as the source of all
> good and freed from all error, it must be elected by universal suffrage, that is, by the
> believers. … This House of Justice enacteth the laws and the government enforceth them.
> The legislative body must reinforce the executive, the executive must aid and assist the
> legislative body so that through the close union and harmony (irtibāṭ va iltīyām, literally,
> ‘affinity150 and conciliation’151) of these two forces (īn du qūvat), the foundation of fairness
> and justice may become firm and strong, that all the regions of the world may become even
> as Paradise itself.152

connection, affinity, familiarity, close friendship’.

Here, the principle of intra-governmental coordination serves as a complement of
international cooperation, where a unified system is advocated, both in constitutive structure and
in operational functioning. Justice is a necessary precondition of unity, as Baha’u’llah writes, the
‘Words of Paradise’:

> The word of God which the Supreme Pen hath recorded on the sixth leaf of the Most
> Exalted Paradise is the following: The light of men is Justice. Quench it not with the
> contrary winds of oppression and tyranny. The purpose of justice is the appearance of
> unity among men. The ocean of divine wisdom surgeth within this exalted word, while the
> books of the world cannot contain its inner significance.153

XII. Types of Unity Articulated by Shoghi Effendi: Foundations of Baha’i Administration

and the Future World Commonwealth

35\.   Unity in Diversity: The types of unity that follow focus primarily on the foundations of the
Baha’i administrative order, and on the future world commonwealth. ‘For the bedrock of the
Bahá’í administrative order is the principle of unity in diversity’, Shoghi Effendi stresses, ‘which
has been so strongly and so repeatedly emphasized in the writings of the Cause.’154 While a
commonplace catchphrase today, ‘unity in diversity’ remains a watchword in the Baha’i
community.

36\.   Unity of the Baha’i Revelation: Baha’u’llah was preceded by a religious figure, known as
the Bab, a spiritual title meaning ‘the Gate’ (1819–50). Parallel to John the Baptist in relation to
Jesus Christ, the Bab prepared his followers for the advent of Baha’u’llah and, in the process,
revealed a considerable body of religious texts that ought to be considered as Baha’i scripture:
‘Shoghi Effendi feels that the unity of the Bahá’í revelation as one complete whole embracing

Publishing Trust of India, 1970, 48.

the Faith of the Báb should be emphasised.’155 Thus the Bab is considered the ‘Co-founder’156 of
the Baha’i religion, historically, doctrinally and legislatively (to the extent that certain laws of the
Bab have been adopted, in modified form, in Baha’i praxis).

37\.     Unity of Doctrine: A necessary corollary of scriptural integrity is doctrinal integrity, which
is safeguarded by an established set of primary sources with a clear line of interpretive authority,
acting as a bulwark against schism – a typically irreversible problem that has has caused other
world religions to be fragmented, often with serious tensions or even antagonisms. On this, the
Universal House of Justice has stated: ‘Unity of doctrine is maintained by the existence of the
authentic texts of Scripture and the voluminous interpretations of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi
Effendi, together with the absolute prohibition against anyone propounding “authoritative” or
“inspired” interpretations or usurping the function of Guardian.’157 With such lines of authority
being clear and unambiguous, there is room for diversity of private understanding and personal
elucidations that may be offered. ‘Doctrinal unity and administrative unity, these are the two
chief pillars that sustain the edifice of the Cause’, writes Shoghi Effendi, ‘and protect it from the
storms of opposition which so severely rage against it.’158

38\.     Unity of Baha’i Administration: The unity and integrity of the Baha’i administrative
order is considered to be divinely inspired in its essential features and is therefore highly valued.
Shoghi Effendi urges Baha’is to ‘maintain the unity of the administrative order’ along with ‘the
unity of the believers’.159 ‘Differences which are not fundamental and contrary to the basic

teachings of the Cause should be maintained’, Shoghi Effendi goes on to say, ‘while the
underlying unity of the administrative order should be at any cost preserved and insured.’160

The Baha’i religion would forfeit moral authority in its efforts to promote world unity if its own
integrity as a unified community was ever to be compromised. Diversity is still valued, and
differences respected, so long as they do not divide:

> For the bedrock of the Bahá’í administrative order is the principle of unity in diversity,
> which has been so strongly and so repeatedly emphasized in the writings of the Cause.
> Differences which are not fundamental and contrary to the basic teachings of the Cause
> should be maintained, while the underlying unity of the administrative order should be at
> any cost preserved and insured. Unity, both of purpose and of means is, indeed,
> indispensable to the safe and speedy working of every Assembly, whether local or
> national.161

The mechanism of administrative integrity and coherence is the authority of the
democratically elected (elected every five years) international Baha’i council, the Universal
House of Justice, to wit: ‘Unity of administration is assured by the authority of the Universal
House of Justice.’162

39\.     Unity of Purpose: ‘With unity of purpose firmly established in our minds, with every trace
of personal animosity banished from our hearts, and with the spirit of whole-hearted and
sustained fellowship kindled in our souls’, Shoghi Effendi counsels, ‘can we hope to deliver
effectively the Message of Bahá’u’lláh, and execute faithfully the various provisions of our
Beloved’s Will and Testament.’163 And further, Shoghi Effendi urges ‘unity of purpose and
action’ in order to ‘form one united front and combat, wisely and tactfully, every force that might
darken the spirit of the Movement, cause division in its ranks, and narrow it by dogmatic and

sectarian belief’.164 Disunity, i.e. internal disagreements, will result in a faith community at
cross-purposes with itself. Unity within the Baha’i community is a paramount concern, and is
expressed in terms of remaining faithful to the Baha’i ‘Covenant’, which mandates that the
Baha’i community supports the institutions (i.e. the Universal House of Justice, along with
national and local spiritual assemblies) that were brought into existence by Baha’u’llah and
‘Abdu’l-Baha, and which the Baha’is themselves democratically elect.

40\.     Unity of Means: Closely related to unity of purpose is the process of accomplishing that
purpose, i.e. ‘unity of means’. ‘Unity, both of purpose and of means’, Shoghi Effendi explains,
‘is, indeed, indispensable to the safe and speedy working of every Assembly, whether local or
national.’165 This is an emphasis on congruence and coherence in effectively carrying out
administrative tasks.

41\.     Unity of Vision: The next few Baha’i principles of unity are pragmatic. Vision precedes
action. Shared vision is necessary for forming a collective plan of action. The Universal House of
Justice employs the expression, ‘unity of vision’ in the context of ‘systematic action’. Speaking
of the ‘requirements of systematic action in advancing the process of entry by troops’ (i.e.
attracting significant numbers of new Baha’is), the Universal House of Justice stresses the
strategic importance of conducting Baha’i ‘reflection meetings’ at the local ‘cluster’ level, in
which ‘participatory discussions’ serve ‘to maintain unity of vision, sharpen clarity of thought
and heighten enthusiasm’.166

42\.     Unity of Action: Once ‘unity of vision’ is reached, ‘unity of action’ follows. This Baha’i
principle of unity is to be distinguished from ‘Unity of (Ritual) Acts’ (principle #3, supra). As to
the observance of Baha’i feasts and holy days, Shoghi Effendi wrote:

Today, unity of action is even more essential for the current emphasis on systematic action
involving worldwide ‘coherence’ in furthering the collective interests of the Baha’i Faith in its
efforts to significantly grow in size and in its leavening influence in wider societies. ‘Unity of
action’ is not only important within the Baha’i community, but has implications for the world at
large, as indicated by the Baha’i International Community, which is an international agency that
officially represents the Universal House of Justice in published statements on various issues of
international concern, such as in the statement regarding ‘unity of thought and action’ in the
pursuit of justice:

> Justice is the one power that can translate the dawning consciousness of humanity’s
> oneness into a collective will through which the necessary structures of global community
> life can be confidently erected. An age that sees the people of the world increasingly
> gaining access to information of every kind and to a diversity of ideas will find justice

> candid light of the standards it requires. …

At the group level, a concern for justice is the indispensable compass in collective

This language reflects such exhortations by Shoghi Effendi as in his 1928 call ‘that a
concerted effort be made and a unity in thought and action be obtained’169 and in his 1948

cablegram, ‘URGE UTMOST UNITY ENERGETIC ACTION’.170 This principle complements
the ‘second candle’ of the ‘Seven Candles of Unity’ (presented above), which is ‘unity of thought
in world undertakings’.171 Thus there should be agreement both within the Baha’i community
and as well as in international undertakings, be they scientific, medical, economic,
environmental, political or otherwise.

43\.     Evolving Social Unities: Underlying the future golden age of world civilization that the
Baha’i writings envision is a theory of social evolution, where civilization advances throughout
history in a progressive series of widening circles of unity, as Shoghi Effendi has framed it:

> Unification of the whole of mankind is the hall-mark of the stage which human society is
> now approaching. Unity of family, of tribe, of city-state, and nation have been successively
> attempted and fully established. World unity is the goal towards which a harassed humanity
> is striving. Nation-building has come to an end.172

Thus, ‘unity of family’, ‘unity of tribe’, ‘unity of city-state’ and ‘unity of nation’173 are
evolutionary stages in social evolution, culminating, in due course, in a world civilization,
described below.

44\.     Unity of the World Commonwealth: The preceding Baha’i principles of unity are
teleological, in that they synchronically and synergistically aim to hasten the day in which the
world commonwealth, as envisaged in the Baha’i writings, emerge, and the future golden age of
world civilization will come into fruition:

> The unity of the human race, as envisaged by Bahá’u’lláh, implies the establishment of a
> world commonwealth in which all nations, races, creeds and classes are closely and
> permanently united, and in which the autonomy of its state members and the personal

XIII. Other Unities

Other types of unity round out this preliminary survey. What follows is a sampling of various
exhortations and rhetorical expressions, all aimed at reinforcing the Baha’i focus on unity
socially and administratively in all aspects of Baha’i thought and life. Due to lack of space, the
following examples will be given without quotation or explanation:

45\.   Mystic Unity of God and His Manifestations: ‘Abdu’l-Baha was charismatic and,
without any intention to do so, attracted some followers who variously thought him to be the
return of Christ or to share the powers of Baha’u’llah, etc. In the course of addressing the error of
such views, Shoghi Effendi wrote of the ‘the mystic unity of God and His Manifestations’:

> Moreover, to maintain that the assertion ‘He is Myself’, instead of denoting the mystic
> unity of God and His Manifestations (vaḥdat-i ma‘navīyih-yi maẓāhir-i ilāhīyih), as
> explained in the Kitáb-i Íqán, establishes the identity of Bahá’u’lláh with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
> would constitute a direct violation of the oft-repeated principle of the oneness of God’s
> Manifestations – a principle which the Author of these same extracts is seeking by
> implication to emphasize.175

The ‘mystic unity of God and His Manifestations’ expresses a vertical relationship, whereas
‘the oneness of God’s Manifestations’ (represented in principle #9, supra) is horizontal in nature.
This subtle distinction is incidental to the main point, which is that ‘Abdu’l-Baha is not a prophet
or, in the Baha’i term of art, a ‘Manifestation of God’.

> Manifestations’ is rendered vaḥdat-i ma‘navīyih-yi maẓāhir-i ilāhīyih.

46.     Unity of Meaning: Historically, many schisms in other religions were precipitated by
disagreements over the purport and application of various scriptural texts. Not so in the Baha’i
context. Taken together, the Baha’i scriptures constitute a considerable corpus of authoritative
religious texts. They are accepted as infused and imbued with a perfectly consistent gist: ‘In
attempting to understand the Writings, therefore, one must first realize that there is and can be no
real contradiction in them, and in the light of this we can confidently seek the unity of meaning
which they contain.’176 While ‘unity of meaning’ is not a term commonly met with in Baha’i
discourse, the principle for which it stands is universally accepted and adhered to within the
Baha’i community at large.

47\.     Economic Unity (ittiḥād-i iqtiṣādī): In an untranslated Persian text, within the short space
of the single sentence, ‘Abdu’l-Baha sets forth five principles of unity: political unity (ittiḥād-i
siyāsī); religious unity (ittiḥād-i dīnī); racial unity (ittiḥād-i nizhādī); economical unity (ittiḥād-i
iqtiṣādī); social unity (ittiḥād-i ijtimā’ī).177 This Baha’i teaching is far better known as “abolition
of the extremes of wealth and poverty.”178

48\.     Methodological Coherence: In what essentially amounts to the harmony of faith and
reason as applied to the academic study of the Baha’i religion, The Universal House of Justice —
a strong supporter of Baha'i scholarship as well as of the pursuit of all academic disciplines —
recommends that the academic study of religion not be divorced from an ontological
commitment (or, at least, a first-order phenomenological acknowledgment) of spiritual reality, as
a key dimension of religion and spirituality that must be appreciated in any holistic appraisal:

> The principal concern of the House of Justice is over a methodological bias and discordant
> tone which seem to inform the work of certain of the authors. The impression given is that,
> in attempting to achieve what they understand to be academic objectivity, they have
> inadvertently cast the Faith into a mould which is essentially foreign to its nature, taking no

account of the spiritual forces which Bahá’ís see as its foundation. Presumably the
> justification offered for this approach would be that most scholars of comparative religion
> are essentially concerned with discernable phenomena, observable events and practical
> affairs and are used to treating their subject from a western, if not a Christian, viewpoint.
> This approach, although understandable, is quite impossible for a Bahá’í, for it ignores the
> fact that our world-view includes the spiritual dimension as an indispensable component
> for consistency and coherence, and it does not beseem a Bahá’í to write … about his Faith
> as if he looked upon it from the norm of humanism or materialism.179

Baha’i scholars are thereby encouraged to avoid “adopting what is, in essence, a
materialistic and localized stance.”180

49\.    Unity with the Environment: This Baha’i principle of unity in the present survey departs
slightly from the criterion for inclusion that the principle is explicitly expressed as a ‘unity’ or
‘oneness’, etc. Former Vice-President Al Gore, quotes Shoghi Effendi to the effect that humanity
and nature are inseparable and exert reciprocal influence, one upon the other:

> One of the newest of the great universalist religions, Baha’i, founded in 1863 in Persia
> by Mirza Husayn Ali [Baha’u’llah], warns us not only to properly regard the relationship
> between humankind and nature but also the one between civilization and the
> environment. Perhaps because its guiding visions were formed during the period
> of accelerating industrialism, Baha’i seems to dwell on the spiritual implications of the
> great transformation to which it bore fresh witness: ‘We cannot segregate the human heart
> from the environment outside us and say that once one of these is reformed everything will
> be improved. Man is organic with the world. His inner life molds the environment and

is itself deeply affected by it. The one acts upon the other and every abiding change in the
life of man is the result of these mutual reactions.’181

This application of the Baha’i emphasis on unity to environmental concerns demonstrates
the integrative nature of the Baha’i worldview, in that any concerted effort to address
environmental concerns necessarily should presuppose a dynamic interplay, or ‘mutuality’,
between humanity, in terms of its spiritual conscience, and the physical world.

50\.   Unity of the Free: Baha’i texts distinguish been ‘true liberty’ (i.e. freedom within the
bounds of propriety and moderation) and unbridled libertarianism that, in its extreme form, can
slip into anarchy. The Universal House of Justice has developed this reasoning in a message that
will be quoted at some length, so that the reader can better follow it:

> The spirit of liberty which in recent decades has swept over the planet with such
> tempestuous force is a manifestation of the vibrancy of the Revelation brought by
> Bahá’u’lláh. His own words confirm it. ‘The Ancient Beauty’, He wrote in a soul-stirring
> commentary on His sufferings, ‘hath consented to be bound with chains that mankind may
> be released from its bondage, and hath accepted to be made a prisoner within this most
> mighty Stronghold that the whole world may attain unto true liberty’. …

> Consider what Bahá’u’lláh has done: He revealed laws and principles to guide the free, He
> established an Order to channel the actions of the free, He proclaimed a Covenant to
> guarantee the unity of the free.

> Thus, we hold to this ultimate perspective: Bahá’u’lláh came to set humanity free. His
> Revelation is, indeed, an invitation to freedom – freedom from want, freedom from war,
> freedom to unite, freedom to progress, freedom in peace and joy.182

‘Unity of the free’ is closely related to principle #14, ‘Unity in Freedom’ (i.e. the ‘third
candle’ of the seven candles of unity, recounted above), yet may be distinguished as the reflex of
the responsible individual exercise of freedom within a free society, where freedom may be taken
to excess and may end as oppressive to others by impinging on their rights and dignities.

XIV. Conclusions and Recommendations for Further Study

The illness/cure soteriological model in the phenomenology of religions is a useful method for
understanding the core paradigms of world religions. This analytic prism commends itself in
shedding light on the interior, coherent ‘logic’ of soteriological paradigms among the various
world religions. As applied to the Baha’i Faith, the illness/cure model reveals that, in the Baha’i
perspective, the human predicament is estrangement – what the Baha’i poet, Robert Hayden, in
his poem, ‘American Journal’, called ‘strangering’183 – and the ‘cure’ or social salvation that is
offered is that of unity, or harmony, ranging from family relations to race relations to
international relations. This is consistent with what Baha’u’llah proclaims as the distinctive
contribution of the Baha’i revelation:

> O ye that dwell on earth (ay ahl-i ā‘lam)! The distinguishing feature that marketh the pre-
> eminent character of this Supreme Revelation (faḍl īn ẓuhūr-i a‘ẓam) consisteth in that We
> have, on the one hand, blotted out from the pages of God’s holy Book whatsoever hath
> been the cause of strife, of malice and mischief (sabab-i ikhtilāf va fisāl va nifāq) amongst
> the children of men, and have, on the other, laid down the essential prerequisites of
> concord, of understanding, of complete and enduring unity (‘illat-i ulfat va ittiḥād va
> ittifāq). Well is it with them that keep My statutes.184

And further, this following passage in Arabic uses the illness/cure metaphor, in which the
remedy for the body politic is prescribed by the prophet-as-physician, which is basically to
restore harmony of all systems and constituents within that collective body:

> O ye elected representatives (aṣḥāb al-majlis) of the peoples in every land! Take ye counsel
> together, and let your concern be only for that which profiteth mankind, and bettereth the
> condition (ḥāl) thereof, if ye be of them that scan heedfully. Regard the world (ā‘lam) as
> the human body (kih haykal insān) which, though at its creation whole and perfect (ṣaḥīḥ,
> kāmil), hath been afflicted, through various causes (asbāb), with grave disorders and
> maladies (amrāḍ). … That which the Lord hath ordained as the sovereign remedy (al-
> daryāq al-a‘ẓam) and mightiest instrument for the healing (ṣiḥḥat) of all the world (al-arḍ)
> is the union (ittiḥād) of all its peoples in one universal Cause (amr wāḥid), one common
> Faith (sharī‘a wāḥida). This can in no wise be achieved except through the power of a
> skilled, an all-powerful and inspired Physician (ṭabīb ḥādhiq kāmil mu’ayid).185

Here, there is a remarkable congruence between the data and the analytical prism used to
study that data. The illness/cure model and the Baha’i texts themselves – where the passage cited
above is a perfect exemplar – both invoke the metaphor of disease and cure, whether individual
or social. Extending this medical metaphor could have significant implications in broader
contexts, such as the appropriateness of the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis by a given
religion, which may involve value judgments. It goes without saying that typically a plurality of
salvation/liberation theories may coexist within a given world religion. Issues not only of
efficacy, but of actual ‘medical malpractice’ at the hands of members of the clergy may be raised,
where financial, political, sexual and/or other improprieties may call into question whether any
‘cure’ under review is being administered ethically. Other issues implicated by extending the
medical metaphor of the illness/cure framework of analysis may be whether one religious ‘cure’
is appropriate (‘Let the treatment fit the disease’,186 as the adage goes), or outmoded (where ‘the

remedy may change’,187 as ‘Abdu’l-Baha observes) or where the cure is at the peril of others, in
situations where the competing cures are not simply plural approaches, but may impinge on the
well-being of each other, as in the case of inter-communal conflict or outright civil war, where
religion is a major, aggravating factor, as in present-day Syria. But these issues are outside the
scope of the present study.

The inventory of Baha’i principles of unity enumerated above – as indicated by selected
genitive constructions (i.e. ‘iḍāfa exemplars) involving the Persian/Arabic terms of ittiḥād,
ittifāq, yigānigī, vaḥdat, ulfat, etc. – is by no means exhaustive. This paper is prolegomenonal to,
and indeed invites, an in-depth study, by further applying this analytical prism to the fundamental
Baha’i paradigm of unity. Notwithstanding the open-ended nature of the foregoing results, the
number of reiterative searches made to confirm the present results increases confidence that the
present study has identified the majority of Baha’i principles of unity that may be found in the
available primary sources.

The principles presented in the present study are explicit Baha’i principles of unity. Many
other Baha’i teachings may be said to be implicit Baha’i principles of unity. The implications for
future research are quite clear: once this inventory of explicitly formulated Baha’i principles of
unity receives independent attestation, then a typology may be attempted, whether or not that
means revisiting Piper’s original typology or devising another classification scheme that appears
to naturally emerge from the source material itself.

All of the foregoing Baha’i principles of unity are presented as part of the ‘remedy’ that
Baha’u’llah, in his professed role as the ‘Divine Physician’, has prescribed for the healing of the
world. ‘[T]he people of religions find, in the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh, the establishment of
Universal Religion,’ ‘Abdu’l-Baha proclaims, ‘a religion that perfectly conforms with present
conditions, which in reality effects the immediate cure of the incurable disease, which relieves

every pain, and bestows the infallible antidote for every deadly poison.’188 These principles, each
with their own intrinsic worth, synergize and synthesize in the Baha’is’ collective effort – and
leavening influence – to unify the world, to establish universal peace, to advance civilization, to
promote godliness and virtues, and to deepen the bonds of human fraternity, as ‘Abdu’l-Baha
declares:

> Direct thine attention to the holy Tablets [of Bahá’u’lláh]; read thou the Ishráqát,
> Tajallíyyát, the Words of Paradise, the Glad Tidings, the Ṭarázát, the Most Holy Book.
> Then wilt thou see that today these heavenly Teachings are the remedy for a sick and
> suffering world, and a healing balm for the sores on the body of mankind. They are the
> spirit of life, the ark of salvation, the magnet to draw down eternal glory, the dynamic
> power to motivate the inner self of man.189

And further, in announcing the fulfilment of the prophecies in the Book of Revelation,
‘Abdu’l-Baha has proclaimed, in patently Christian terms, that the Baha’i principles of unity
constitute ‘the remedy of true salvation’:

> He [Baha’u’llah] is Alpha and Omega. He is the One that will give unto him that is athirst
> of the fountain of the water of life and bestow upon the sick the remedy of true salvation.

He whom such grace aideth is verily he that receiveth the most glorious heritage from the

Prophets of God and His holy ones. The Lord will be his God, and he His dearly-beloved
son.190

Given the Baha’i emphasis on unity, there are many Baha’i teachings that may be
characterized as good for the unity of society. The present study, however, has limited its inquiry
to those teachings that are expressly characterized as Baha’i principles of unity. This limited
scope notwithstanding, the research results are fairly impressive. The fifty (50) Baha’i principles
of unity, as outlined above, cover quite a range of social contexts spanning, as previously stated,
family relations to international relations.

Space does not permit an explanation as to how each of these teachings are typically put
into practice, as that would likely require a separate monograph. Ideally, these Baha’i principles
of unity should have a synergetic effect in furthering efforts to achieve social harmony within
Baha’i communities and their orbits of influence throughout their locations worldwide – a social
laboratory on a global scale. Whether the Baha’i ‘cure’ to the malady of agonistic disunity will
be effective, only time will tell. The cure is no easy panacea. Yet the medicine, having been
