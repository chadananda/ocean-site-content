Coherent Chaos and Chaotic Cosmos:
The Qur’ān and the Symmetry of Truth

“Divine grace comes to the help of a man menaced by earthly confusion and

Ruin – this is the framework of the vision.”

“Symmetry, in any narrative, always means that historical content is being subordinated to mythical

demands of design and form.”

The somewhat playful title of this article alludes first to the long tradition of seeing the
Qur’ān, at least upon first encounter, as a disordered ‘chaotic’ collection of
intermittent, random or casual pericopes, which have been put in “some kind” of order
by the early generations of redactors and editors as a scripture for the Islamic religion
and Muslims. Research over the past few years, however, has clearly demonstrated that
the present form of the Qur’ān represents a number of interconnected ‘logics’ of
structure, content, performance, imagery, textual grammar, vocabulary and poetics.3
Thus, while from the ‘outside’ the Qur’ān appears to lack those essential features of
‘the book’, namely a beginning, middle and end, recent scholarship has remarked about
and elucidated the many ways, some more subtle than others, in which the Qur’ān

reveals its textual secret of unity and consistency.4 True, the Qur’ān is not like other
books, but despite this, in reading the Qur’ān one is never in doubt about its “centre of
narrative gravity”.5

The second half of the title of this paper refers to the Sitz im Leben of the Qur’ānic
revelation, the conditions of life, the social matrix, the notion, or its absence, of history
and the general malaise we are told by sources that seemed to permeate daily life, at
least in some quarters: meaninglessness, despair, anarchy and nihilism as these were
felt and expressed in the Arabian Peninsula on the eve of the rise of Islām, a mood and
ethos frequently denoted by the Arabic word jahl, ignorance, barbarity, injustice (about
which more below). However chaotic and brutal this pre-Islamic period was, the Islamic
ethos is confident that it was part of a larger scheme, a higher and broader inscrutable
sense of order and that without it Islām as we know it would not have distinguished
itself. The juxtaposition of these two epithets is intended to evoke the creative tension
that may be seen to have been resolved, or at least addressed, in the Qur’ān and its later
interpretation. Here, we are concerned only with the Qur’ān.

However chaos is defined or however it functions, there is no getting away from the
fact that one of its main tasks is to affirm and support the terribly human experience of
(and, if you like, addiction to), symmetry.6 It is, moreover, clearly no accident, and less
an oversight, that not only is there no entry for chaos in the remarkable Encyclopaedia of
the Qur’ān, the word itself seems not to occur more than once anywhere in its nearly
4,000 pages.7 While in the Qur’ān and Islām there are a number of “chaoses”
(apparently there is no real plural) acknowledged, whether obliquely, by inference,
allusion or metaphor, and as such presumed, the familiar one of a pre-creational chaos
of emptiness and/or uncontrolled water as the starting point of a cosmogonic process
is virtually absent (see a possible exception below). The pioneering study of this chaotic
water we owe, of course, to the illustrious Göttingen alumnus, Hermann Gunkel.8 But
water, in the Qur’ān at least, is always firmly connected to the ultimately rational (if

the dynamics of inclusios, keywords, iqtiṣāṣ and intertextuality in the Qur’ān, it also provides a very
useful overview of the earlier scholarship referred to above.

currently inscrutable and mysterious) will of God. Even when there is an apparent
irrational and violent or chaotic deluge, it is clear that the water is under the ultimate
control of God, and is a rational instrument of God’s will. Thus, it may be used to mirror
or dispense divine Mercy and Wrath9, and it may even represent an apocalyptic
cataclysm10, but it does not stand for the nothingness or void which is at a core
meaning of chaos and which may be, in other traditions, coeternal or coeval with God.11

A number of vestigial references to primordial chaos may be read in a series of
Qur’ānic words and verses. For example, it is possible that al-ṭāmmat al-kubrā in Qur’ān
79:34 usually understood as an eschatological eventuality, may indeed reflect, at least
in its etymology, the great dragon ti‘amat and thus an interesting cosmogonic – and also
apocalyptic reversal: chaos comes at the end of creation as paradoxical affirmation of
the truth of Islām. Note, in this connection, such words as – al-dukhān ‘the great smoke’
in Qur’ān 41:11 and 44:10, the crumbling of mountains (Qur’ān 101:5), the splitting of
the moon (Qur’ān 54:1) and so on. The exegetes have confidently placed these emblems
of terrestrial chaos and disorder at the end of time.12 One notable exception where
primordial disintegration plays an important role may be in Qur’ān 21:30:

“Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of
creation), before we clove them asunder? We made from water every living thing. Will they not
then believe?”

Such a verse could, in fact be read to support the view that creation is precisely not
tinged by disorder of any kind. The original state was unitary. And, such a view would
be very much in line with the cardinal Islamic doctrine of tawḥīd, the commitment to
the oneness of God, as distinct and opposed to shirk or polytheism. What splitting or
apparent disorder one might see is actually the result of God’s creative will, a will that
is presented as being pre-eminently orderly, reasonable and harmonious.

\[10\] As in Q. 79:34: “When comes the most great overwhelming”/ fa‘idhā jā’ati ’ṭ- ṭāmmatu’l-kubrā. An
interesting exception may be read in the famous Ḥadīth of the Cloud, al-‘amā’. This is an extra Qur’ānic
creation myth particularly dear to the Islamic mystical tradition preserved in both the Sunan and the
Musnad. See, for example, Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn Ḥanbal (d. 855), al-Musnad, (Egypt: Dār al-ma‘ārif,
1949), 4: 11. For a detailed discussion of this important ḥadīth see Stephen Lambden, “An Early Poem of
Mīrzā Ḥusayn ‘Alī Bahā’u’llāh: The Sprinkling of the Cloud of Unknowing (Rashḥ-i ‘Amā’),” Bahá’í Studies
Bulletin 3, no. 2 (Sept. 1984): 4-114. In it the prophet Muḥammad is asked “Where was God before he
created the heavens and the earth?” Muḥammad responded: “He was in a cloud (al-‘amā) above which
there was no air and below which was no air.” Toshihiko Izutsu, in the context of his study of Ibn ‘Arabī
(d. 1240) translates al-‘amā’ as “abysmal Darkness”, see his Sufism and Taoism: A Comparative Study of Key
Philosophical Concepts, (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1983), 116. Ibn Masarra (d. 931) indeed had
already placed it as the first of ten sub-lunar principles from which creation proceeds and where it seems
to correspond quite neatly to ‘chaos’. R. Arnaldez, “Ibn Masarra,” EI2. This could be a topic for the further
study of extra- or post- Qur’ānic notions of chaos.

\[12\] I am pleased to express my thanks to Professor Emerita Wadād al-Qāḍī for suggesting the significance
of this for the present discussion (personal communication, September, 2009).

The significant primordial event in the Qur’ān is referred to in the literature as the
Day of the Covenant, yawm al-mīthāq. Because of the distinctive events described in
Qur’ān 7:172-4, it is also universally known as the Day of a-last: the day of “Am I not
[your Lord?]”. The Qur’ān reads as follows:

“[Prophet], remember when your Lord took out the offspring from the loins of the Children of
Adam and made them bear witness about themselves, He said, ‘Am I not your Lord? (a-lastu bi-
rabbikum)’ and they replied, ‘Yes, we bear witness (balā’ shahidnā).’ So you cannot say on the Day
of Resurrection, ‘We were not aware of this,’ [173] or, ‘It was our forefathers who, before us,
ascribed partners to God, and we are only the descendants who came after them: will you
destroy us because of falsehoods they invented?’ [174] In this way We explain the messages, so
that they may turn [to the right path].”

This scenario is universally understood as having transpired prior to actual creation
and, in fact, represents “the beginning” in the great universal histories, such as that of
al-Ṭabarī, produced during the hey-day of Abbasid power. Long recognized as having
important influence in the realm of purely religious, theological and spiritual thought,13
recent research indicates that this Qur‘ānic vignette reflects something salient and
irreducible about the Islamic view of the world and its place in its history.14 There is
obviously no space here to pursue this topic further at this time. We mention it as the
only pre-creational scenario in the Qur’ān and one that would seem to reflect and
emphasize certain key features of the Islamic religion, especially as they might pertain
to the question of chaos, and its conceptual twin, order. Indeed, the primordial,
“precreational” Day of the Covenant radiates order, meaning, justice and, indeed,
harmony. The idea that all future souls are somehow present in Adam is familiar from
Augustine.15 God’s act of creation, as we are informed by the Qur’ān, seems to be a
species of creatio ex nihilo although some have argued persuasively that however
striking the frequent and characteristic Qur’ānic phrase may be (see below), it cannot
be demonstrated, on the evidence that the Qur’ān therefore holds that God “was
existing with absolutely nothing else.”16 This mode of creation is nonetheless clearly
and powerfully expressed in nine separate contexts throughout the Qur’ān with some
variation on the basic idea: When God wishes to create something he merely says to it

\[13\] The standard, classical treatment of this last category is Gerhard Böwering, The Mystical Vision of
Existence in Classical Islam: the Quranic Hermeneutics of the Sufi Sahl At-Tustari (d. 283/896) (Berlin & New York:
de Gruyter, 1980).

monograph by Wadād al-Qāḍī, [Wadad Kadi], The Primordial Covenant and Human History in the Qur’ān,

discussion in Todd Lawson, “Seeing Double: the Covenant and the Tablet of Ahmad,” in Bahai Studies 1:

American Academy of Religion 50, no. 3 (1982): 365-378.

\[16\] Peterson quoting Averroës, “Creation,” EQ, 475-6.

“Be”, and it is. A representative example is the one that occurs earliest in the muṣḥaf,
the Qur’ān text17:

“He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth, and when He decrees something, He says
only, ‘Be,’ and it is (kun fa-yakūnu)” (Qur’ān 2:117). 18

This is possibly akin to the creation described in Genesis, where the forms of life are
spoken into existence.19 Such ensures that whatever chaos and void might have existed
prior to creation as such, it could not have been coeval with God. Thus the Qur’ān and
Christian understanding of the Hebrew Bible would seem to share the same basic point
of view. Again, the notion of order emerging from primordial chaos is not present. The
analogue of this may be thought, as suggested above, the apocalyptic chaos described
and indicated numerous times throughout the Qur’ān. Here “smoke” or “deluge” or all
images of uncontrollable nature, are organized in an eloquent and frightening
symmetrical scenario of the coming Hour (al-sā‘a) or Event (al-wāqi‘a). As disturbing and
cataclysmic as these obviously are, the Qur’ān never hesitates about them being the
result of God’s justice and will. So, they are controlled chaos, or paradoxical chaos. We
frequently find this notion attested to and expressed in some of the more powerful,
shorter Qur’ānic suras, such as the Chapter of the Chargers (Q.100, Sūrat al-‘ādiyāt) or
the Chapter of the Clatterer (Q.101, Sūrat al-qāri‘a), to name only two. In these instances
the powerful apocalyptic energies of destruction and confusion are in some sense
simultaneously tamed and intensified by the compelling verbal artistry of the actual
Arabic.20

There is one more interesting example, or possible example, of a kind of chaos. The
famous Light Verse, Qur’ān 24:35 has long been esteemed as one of the more beautiful
and compelling passages in the Qur’ān. Indeed, it has recently been compared with the
Paradiso vision of Dante.21 But here in the Qur’ān the lack of symmetry leaves us always
poised on the edge of a kind of chaos. The verse is as follows:

“God is the Light of the heavens and earth. His Light is like this: there is a niche, and in it a
lamp, the lamp inside a glass, a glass like a glittering star, fuelled from a blessed olive tree from
neither east nor west, whose oil almost gives light even when no fire touches it— light upon

\[17\] This technical term designates the current, post-Muḥammadan form, order and arrangement of the
text as it is found in all manuscripts and editions in the Muslim world. It is also known as the ‘Uthmānic
codex. The word muṣḥaf is used to distinguish this ‘edition’ of the text from the actual Qur’ān, the aural
Word of God, whose chronological revelation almost perfectly reverses the order of the text in printed
versions.

\[18\] Other Qur’anic verse which repeat some version of this formula are: 3:47; 3:59; 6:73; 16:40; 19:35; 25:7;
36:82; 40:68.

\[19\] On this phenomenon, see the interesting discussion by Frye, The Great Code, 104-116. The asexual
creativity of God (of a type found also in the Qur’ān) is, accordingly, a critique of nature cosmogonies and
ontologies.

‘Ādiyāt,” in Literary Structures of Religious Meaning in the Qur’ān, ed. Issa J. Boullata (Richmond, U.K.: Curzon,

light—God guides whoever He will to his Light; God draws such comparisons for people; God
has full knowledge of everything.” Sūrat al-nūr (Light) 24:35

The image of undifferentiated, perhaps blinding light presents us with the interesting
paradox or irony that the first principle of order and knowledge is a powerful symbol
for the unknowableness and inaccessibility of God, in line with other similarly
apophatic pronouncements (e.g. Qur’ān 112). The beauty of this divine ‘chaos of light’ is
almost immediately counterbalanced by a true image of ignorance, disbelief and
confusion. Indeed, the uncontrollable effulgence of the divine light acquires an
immediate intensification of meaning by the comparison with darkness (and vice
versa):
“But the deeds of those who disbelieve are like a mirage in a desert, the thirsty person thinks
there will be water but, when he gets there, he finds only God, who pays him his account in
full—God is swift in reckoning. Or like shadows in a deep sea covered by wave upon wave, with
clouds above—layer upon layer of darkness—if he holds out his hand, he is scarcely able to see
it. The one to whom God gives no light has no light at all.” Sūrat al-nūr (Light) 24:39-40

If we wish to find real disorder and chaos in the Qur’ān, we must turn, then, to a
different realm, one that is under the immediate control of not God, but men. A few
Qur’ānic terms explicitly denote social disorder, disruption or even cataclysm. For
example, fitna, a word that occurs 30 times in this nominal form, strongly connotes
disorder on a social scale, its root meaning is “test” or “temptation”. It is frequently
translated as “civil war” and is used to refer to the great, apparently irreparable breach
in the unity of the Muslim community that issued in what we now refer to as Sunnī and
Shī‘ī Islām. Here, the understanding is that there was an inability to withstand the
temptation for which the unity of the Muslim community was sacrificed.22 The word in
the plural (fitan) refers to those later “intramural” skirmishes, struggles and battles in
which the idea of religious authority was at stake and derives special meaning to the
degree that it engages with the apocalyptic topos of the Hour (al-sā‘a) so frequently
mentioned in the Qur’ān.23 Another pair of terms, tafāwut (fault, disharmony) and ƒuṭūr
(flaws, fissures) occurs in one of dozens of verses espousing a distinctive Islamic
teleological argument as heard in Qur’ān 67:2-5:

“He is the Mighty, the Forgiving; [3] who created the seven heavens, one above the other. You
will not see any flaw (tafāwut) in what the Lord of Mercy creates. Look again! Can you see any
flaw (fuṭūr)? [4] Look again! And again! Your sight will turn back to you, weak and defeated.”24

Nonetheless, the dialectic of such oppositions and dualities as ‘chaos and order’ –
even if this particular pair is not mentioned in the sacred text - is a very strong
subtheme throughout Islamicate literature beginning with the Qur’ān. Here we will
touch on how this dialectic functions in Qur’ānic discourse by focusing on three
different categories: scripture, society and history. The various and multiple

\[22\] A good general but brief discussion is L. Gardet, “Fitna,” EI2.

Muslim Apocalyptic (Princeton: Darwin Press, 2002).

interconnected symmetries of the Qur’ān may be thought of as representing two banks
of a river through which the central epic theme of Qur’ānic sacred history (which is the
only kind) flows. Such symmetry is present, either explicitly or implicitly, in every
verse — of which there are just over 6,000. For convenience, an excerpt from my recent
study of this feature of the Qur’ān is quoted here to demonstrate how the central
Islamic notion of ‘affirming oneness’ – tawḥīd, is implicated and indicated in the
constant interplay of duality and opposition in the Qur‘ān.25

become the task of exegesis to identify.[ . . . ]

In the case of the Qur’ān itself, the basic Islamic desideratum of tawḥīd may

\[27\] ‘Work’ may conjure, through the accident of etymology, the idea of Opera and raises the very
interesting question about the operatic aspects of the Qur’ān, its recitation (performance) and audition
(reception), its power to hold, transport and explain or at least contextualise the great mysteries and
deep sufferings of life. A suggestive study that would certainly be of use in such an exploration is the
recent work by Linda Hutcheon and Michael Hutcheon, Opera and the Art of Dying (Cambridge, MA:
Harvard University Press, 2004). The guiding insight is that audiences of opera are “[…] participating in a
ritual of grieving or experiencing their own mortality by proxy [...] they can feel both identification and
distance as they – safely – rehearse their own (or a loved one’s) demise [...] death is made to feel logical
or somehow right” (10–11).

The late Norman O. Brown made the important remark that it does not

that one is ‘in the right place’29 as it were: 30

\[28\] It is interesting to observe here the type of attributes that are never used to designate God, e.g. happy,
gay, laughing, etc. See also the interesting observation in Schmidtke, “Pairs and Pairing,” EQ, on those
pairs of divine names that are in fact not opposites, what she refers to as ‘double divine epithets’.

\[29\] This may be thought the literary equivalent or analogue of one of Nicholas of Cusa’s favorite
philosophical and theological maxims: “God is a sphere whose center is everywhere.” Jasper Hopkins,
Nicholas of Cusa On Learned Ignorance: A Translation and Appraisal of De Docta Ignorantia (Minneapolis: Arthur
J. Banning Press, 1985), 59. (See also 33). We know, though, that Nicholas of Cusa (d. 1464) got this image
from his reading of Meister Eckhart (d. 1328). On the history of this metaphor see Karsten Harries, “The
Infinite Sphere: Comments on the History of a Metaphor,” Journal of the History of Philosophy 13, no.1
(1975): 5–15.

\[30\] The passage continues: “[…] hence the beautiful inconsequentiality of the arrangement of the Suras:
from the longest to the shortest. In this respect the Koran is more avant-garde than Finnegans Wake, in
which the over-all organization is entangled in both linear and cyclical patterns which it is trying to
transcend.” Norman O. Brown, “The Apocalypse of Islam,” Social Text 8 (Winter, 1983–4): 166.

Among the many pairs of opposites used in this way throughout the Qur’ān, one is
of particular interest for thinking about chaos and order in Islām: islām≠jahl. A brief
examination of the semantic value of these two words will illustrate why it is perhaps
not necessary for the Qur’ān to either posit or even contemplate primordial
cosmogonic chaos in order to supply a foil or mate for its opposite. The interesting
question, whether such an absence represents an inter-confessional apologetic, is
enticing but will not be explored here.32 We will begin with the second term. Jahl, from
the Arabic root J-H-L, means in the first instance “ignorance”. It is, according to the way
in which the root and its derivations occur in the Qur’ān, an ignorance of far-ranging
consequence and influence. In keeping with the “myth of symmetry,” so important to
the Qur’ān and Islamic religiosity, later commentators and theorists divided historical
time into two major periods: the period of ignorance, known as al-Jāhiliyya in the
Qur’ān, and its polar opposite, al-Islāmiyya. The word is used to describe the condition
most frequently exemplified by the Arabs of the Hijaz and environs prior to the
revelation of Islām. It is in this context that the two terms, though one contains two
syllables, may be thought to function as an ideational “minimal pair”. The root occurs
twenty-four times. A related term, and one which is expressive of a strictly moral chaos
and corruption of the type that obtained during the jāhilī period, is represented by the
Arabic word fasād which occurs no less than fifty times in some form or another in the
Qur’ān. As observed by the author of the article on creation in the Encyclopedia of the
Qur’ān: “The universe has been organized into a cosmos rather than a chaos and
humanity is accordingly warned to introduce no human disorder into the divinely
ordained arrangement of the physical world: Do not sow corruption (lā tufsidū) in the
earth after its ordering (ba‘da iṣlāḥihā). (Qur’ān 7:56).”33 In this instance, what might be
thought the linguistic accident of rhyme and homophony obtaining between the words
iṣlāḥ (order, well-being) and islām is, in the context of the seamless vision of the Qur’ān,
a most happy one. Thus jahl and fasād, as diametric opposites of islām shed light on the
meaning of that word in the process of supplying a symmetrical counterweight to it.

It may be useful to reproduce here all of the twenty or so verses in which the
word in some form or another actually appears in the Qur’ān. These verses will be
arranged according to the grammatical form of the root in textual order34, the first
being the nominal jāhiliyya, which occurs four times.

\[34\] We will leave to one side the very interesting “verse of the Trust”: “We offered the Trust to the
heavens, the earth, and the mountains, yet they refused to undertake it and were afraid of it; mankind
undertook it — they have always been inept and foolish (jahūl).” Sūrat al-aḥzab (The Joint Forces) 33:72.

“After sorrow, He caused calm to descend upon you, a sleep that overtook some of you. Another
group, caring only for themselves, entertained false thoughts about God, thoughts more
appropriate to pagan ignorance (jāhiliyya), and said, ‘Do we get a say in any of this?’ [Prophet],
tell them, ‘Everything to do with this affair is in God's hands.’ They conceal in their hearts
things they will not reveal to you. They say, ‘If we had had our say in this, none of us would
have been killed here.’ Tell them, ‘Even if you had resolved to stay at home, those who were
destined to be killed would still have gone out to meet their deaths.’ God did this in order to
test everything within you and in order to prove what is in your hearts. God knows your
innermost thoughts very well.” Sūrat Āl ‘Imrān (The Family of Imran) 3:154

“Do they want judgment according to the time of pagan ignorance (jāhiliyya)? Is there any
better judge than God for those of firm faith?” Sūrat al-mā’ida (The Feast) 5:50

“Stay at home, and do not flaunt your finery as they used to in the pagan past (jāhiliyya); keep
up the prayer, give the prescribed alms, and obey God and His Messenger. God wishes to keep
uncleanness away from you, people of the [Prophet's] House, and to purify you thoroughly.”
Sūrat al-aḥzāb (The Joint Forces) 33:33

“While the disbelievers had fury in their hearts — the fury of ignorance (jāhiliyya) — God sent
His tranquility down on to His Messenger and the believers and made binding on them [their]
promise to obey God for that was more appropriate and fitting for them. God has full
knowledge of all things.” Sūrat al-fatḥ (The Triumph) 48:26

The second form of the root to be noticed here is jahāla. It also occurs four times in the
Qur’ān:

“But God only undertakes to accept repentance from those who do evil out of ignorance (bi-
jahāla) and soon afterwards repent: these are the ones God will forgive, He is all knowing, all
wise.” Sūrat al-nisā’ (The Women) 4:17

“When those who believe in Our revelations come to you [Prophet], say, ‘Peace be upon you.
Your Lord has taken it on Himself to be merciful: if any of you has foolishly (bi-jahāla) done a
bad deed, and afterwards repented and mended his ways, God is most forgiving and most
merciful’.” Sūrat al-an‘ām (Livestock) 6:54

“But towards those who do wrong out of ignorance (bi-jahāla), and afterwards repent and make
amends, your Lord is most forgiving and merciful.” Sūrat al-naḥl (The Bees) 16:119

“Believers, if a troublemaker brings you news, check it first, in case you wrong others
unwittingly (bi-jahāla) and later regret what you have done.” Sūrat al-ḥujurāt (The Private
Rooms) 49:6.

Thus the two forms are used to express, respectively, (1) a general period of ignorance,
whose chief characteristic we eventually learn is the absence of strict monotheistic
worship as revealed to Muḥammad and (2) specific cases of ignorance or foolishness
which although they need not have the greater theological implications of the first
usage, nonetheless enhance its meaning by elaborating a broader semantic field. By far,
the most numerous occurrences of the root J-H-L is found in the fifteen verses in which

it appears in verbal or participial form. These related, various forms demonstrate and
dramatize the meanings thus far encountered. We will list the verbal instances first:

“Even if We sent the angels down to them, and the dead spoke to them, and We gathered all
things right in front of them, they still would not believe, unless God so willed, but of this most
of them are ignorant (yajhalūna).” Sūrat al-an‘ām (Livestock) 6:111

“We took the Children of Israel across the sea, but when they came upon a people who
worshipped idols, they said, ‘Moses, make a god for us like theirs.’ He said, ‘You really are
foolish people (tajhalūna).” Sūrat al-a‘rāf (The Heights) 7:138

“My people, I ask no reward for it from you; my reward comes only from God. I will not drive
away the faithful: they are sure to meet their Lord. I can see you are foolish (tajhalūna).” Sūrat
Hūd (Hud) 11:29

“How can you lust after men instead of women? What fools you are (bal antum qawm
tajhalūna)!” Sūrat al-naml (The Ants) 27:55

“He said, ‘Only God knows when it will come: I simply convey to you the message I am sent with
but I can see you are an insolent people (’arākum qawman tajhalūna)’.” Sūrat al-aḥqāf (The Sand
Dunes) 46:23

With the verbal form we acquire a new appreciation for the active dimension of jahl. It
is something perpetrated. Even though it may seem to represent a passive or negative
quality, such as ignorance or foolishness, it nonetheless requires a kind of existential or
individual conscious decision to be ‘deployed’. It may be forgiven, as we saw above in
verses 6:54 and 16:119. But repentance is necessary - an equally authentic conscious act,
it would seem. The notion of individual choice in the matter of jahl is most clearly
drawn in these following verses that use the active participle jāhil: “one who does jahl”.
This can occur in singular or plural:

“Remember when Moses said to his people, ‘God commands you to sacrifice a cow.’ They said,
‘Are you making fun of us?’ He answered, ‘God forbid that I should be so ignorant (min al-
jāhilīn)’.” Sūrat al-baqara (The Cow) 2:67

“[Give] to those needy who are wholly occupied in God's way and cannot travel in the land [for
trade]. The unknowing (al-jāhil) might think them rich because of their self-restraint, but you
will recognize them by their characteristic of not begging persistently. God is well aware of any
good you give.” Sūrat al-baqara (The Cow) 2:273

“If you find rejection by the disbelievers so hard to bear, then seek a tunnel into the ground or
a ladder into the sky, if you can, and bring them a sign: God could bring them all to guidance if
it were His will, so do not join the ignorant (falā takūnanna mina al-jāhilīna).” Sūrat al-an‘ām
(Livestock) 6:35

“Be tolerant and command what is right: pay no attention to foolish people (al-jāhilīna).” Sūrat
al-a‘rāf (The Heights) 7:199

“God said, ‘Noah, he was not one of your family. What he did was not right. Do not ask Me for
things you know nothing about. I am warning you not to be foolish (min al-jāhilīn)’.” Sūrat Hūd
(Hud) 11:46

“[Joseph] said, ‘My Lord! I would prefer prison to what these women are calling me to do. If
You do not protect me from their treachery, I shall yield to them and do wrong (wa’akun min al-
jāhilīna)’.” Sūrat Yūsuf (Joseph) 12:33

“He said, ‘Do you now realize what you did to Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant
(idh antum jāhilūna)?’” Sūrat Yūsuf (Joseph) 12:89

“The servants of the Lord of Mercy are those who walk humbly on the earth, and who, when
the foolish address them (wa’idhha khāṭabahumu al-jāhilūna), reply, ‘Peace’.” Sūrat al-furqān (The
Differentiator) 25:63

“Whenever they hear frivolous talk they turn away, saying, ‘We have our deeds and you have
yours. Peace be with you! We do not seek the company of ignorant people (lā nabtaghī al-
jāhilīna)’.” Sūrat al-qaṣaṣ (The Story) 28:55

“Say [O Muḥammad to the disbelievers], ‘Do you order me to worship someone other than God,
you foolish people (al-jāhilūna)?’” Sūrat al-zumar (The Throngs) 39:64

Linguistic studies of this word jahl have made it clear that however much the term may
be in some ways correctly considered a semantic opposite of the Arabic word for
‘knowledge’ or ‘knowing’ (viz, ‘ilm) its meaning in the context of the evolution of an
Islamic semantic world-view is more to be found as a polar opposite of another,
perhaps more revealing concept. As was demonstrated so clearly by Goldziher, who in
the process of his explanation revised a millennium of thinking about the semantics of
the term jahl, the proper opposite is not ‘knowledge’ or ‘knowing’ – but, precisely ḥilm,35
a well-attested pre-Islamic concept and virtue described as “the moral reasonableness
of a civilized man [. . .] thus jahl in the sources had the primary semantic function of
referring to the implacable, reckless temper of the pagan Arabs.”36 Building on this
research, Izutsu, nearly fifty years ago, revised further the understanding of the term
by demonstrating that the semantic field of islām as understood as designating the
master ethos of the religion that goes by this name, is profoundly entwined with all of
those virtues and moral qualities subsumed in the term ḥilm: forbearance, patience,
generosity, compassion, slowness to anger, and humility. Izutsu further argued that in
fact the word islām’ stands for a religious and moral ‘recital’ of all of those qualities
understood by the word ḥilm. 37 As a result of this painstaking research by both
Goldziher and Izutsu it becomes clear that in an Islamic context the opposite of the
word jahl is precisely islām, as indicated in the above gloss on verses 25:63 and 28:55
where the linguistic crux of the problem is eloquently expressed. Thus, if jahl means

ignorance it is the opposite of the kind of ‘knowledge’ denoted by the Spanish notion of
educado or the English notion of ‘cultivated’ and the Arabic notion of adab. To quote
Izutsu:
“All things considered, it will be clear by now that in the semantic category of jahl there
is comprised the central notion of a fierce, passionate nature which tends to get stirred
up on the slightest provocation and which may drive a man to all sorts of recklessness;
that this passion tends to manifest itself in a very peculiar way in the arrogant sense of
honor characterizing the pagan Arabs, especially the Bedouin of the desert; and lastly
that in the specifically Qur’ānic situation the word refers to the peculiar attitude of
hostility and aggressiveness against the monotheistic belief of Islām, which was to the
minds of most of Muḥammad’s contemporaries, too exacting ethically and which,
moreover, called upon them to abandon their time-honored customs and their idols.” 38
In such a context, Islām then comes to stand for the opposite of barbarity, savagery,
brutality and vainglory as well as standing for the opposite of ignorance and
polytheism. ‘Submission’ thus becomes understood as obedience to an ethical norm
which, if put in practice, will allow the greatest variety of human communities to live
together peaceably. Such a vision has been associated with the famous “Constitution of
Medina” in which numerous tribal and religious groups are identified and called upon
to obey the law of Islām. In such a context, then, Islām may be seen as having raised the
notion of civilization to the level of religious value. In the process, and as a result of the
distinctive Islamic view of history and its profound relationship to prophecy, the
prevailing “chaos of religions” obtaining at the time of the prophet Muḥammad, could,
under the guidance of distinctively Islamic insights and teachings, be understood as
equal partners in the spiritual and religious journey of humanity, al-nās. The mindless
fate (dahr, cf. Qur’ān 45:24 & 76:1) of the pre-Islamic jāhilī Arab is transformed under the
pressure and immediacy of Muḥammad’s revelation into a seamless history of
communities whose respective histories are determined by their obedience to or
deviation from their own particular revelation. As the Qur’ān (16:36) says:

“We sent a messenger to every community, saying, ‘Worship God and shun false gods.’
Among them were some God guided; misguidance took hold of others. So travel
through the earth and see what was the fate of those who denied the truth.” Sūrat al-
naḥl (The Bees) 16:36

The Qur’ān insists that it teaches a divine and perennial wisdom. The 26 or 27 prophets
it names in its pages and the 124,000 prophets recognized by Islamic tradition are all
related as emissaries of a consistent, harmonious and supremely rational and ordered
divine message. It is with such an extensive ‘alphabet of prophets’ that the language of
the Qur’ānic ethos came to be spoken and understood over a heretofore unimaginably
vast cultural and geographic range. Thus the Qur’ān demonstrates through the
orchestration of an equally vast number of interlocking and mutually reinforcing

suggestion.

symmetries a heretofore-undetected sacred and luminous order of enlightenment and
plan.

At the deeper levels, each symmetry is connected to all others by virtue of its
symmetry. Taking as the central and defining metaphor of Islamic religious orientation
the notion of tawḥīd, it may be argued that far from being a mere abstract ‘theological’
idea, it is – perhaps in addition to this – a metaphor or emblem of a social
transformation which took place in the wake of Muḥammad’s powerful religious
experience, the revelation, for which one cognate is the word apocalypse, the evidence
for which is known as the Qur’ān. Thus each key term of the Qur‘ānic Weltanschauung is
determined and understood by an opposite or companion term.39 So, tawḥīd ‘affirming
or making one[ness]’ is contextualized by its conceptual opposite, the unforgivable sin
in Islam, shirk ‘violating divine oneness’.40 It is perhaps for this reason that the
asymmetrical final respective verbal forms of these two central concepts have acquired
their permanence in the discourse.

A chaos of Religions

The Qur’ān may be slyly speaking of itself, when in Sura 12, the remarkable Sūrat Yūsuf
(Joseph), Pharaoh’s benighted advisors dismiss the sequence of images that came to the
royal sleeper as “jumbled dreams” (aḍghāth aḥlam, verse 44). These are the same dreams
that will soon be interpreted by the young, imprisoned prophet Yūsuf and thereby
achieve the status of divine revelation. Moreover, it is the public act of properly
reading and interpreting these Pharaonic dreams that wins Yūsuf his release from
prison and elevates him to a powerful royal position. In short, Yūsuf’s reading of the
dreams causes his heretofore secret status as prophet to be revealed along with the
true meaning of the heretofore coded or ‘jumbled’ message of Pharaoh’s dream.
Meaning emerges from apparent chaos and meaninglessness. This is a key feature of
the Qur’ānic apocalypse: revelation occurs through interpretation. In the first place,
and perhaps the most obvious, this interpretation occurs when the Qur’ān understands
all previous religious history as leading to its own vision. From one – somewhat cynical
point of view, this is the all-too- familiar ‘imperial device’ known in countless contexts
and periods of human experience. From another angle it solves the problem of the
‘chaos of religions’ confronting both Muḥammad and his community, transforming this
disorder into order through narrative and interpretation. Thus both intellectual or
spiritual and social chaos are the atemporal terminus post quem of the Islamic
Weltanschauung as this is encoded in the Qur’ān text. There is no cosmogonic or
ontological equivalent. This is perhaps unsurprising and ‘as it should be’ in a religion
for which the primary spiritual-cum theological value is oneness and its affirmation.

Islam does not teach an original sin, there is nonetheless a Fall. The distinctive
Islamic Fall is understood not as the result of sin as such but the result of forgetting the
original covenant mentioned above. Indeed, in order to make this point some
commentators, beginning with the so-called ‘father of exegesis’, Ibn ‘Abbās (d. 687)

\[39\] Toshihiko Izutsu, Ethico-Religious Concepts.

\[40\] “God does not forgive the joining of partners with Him (an yushraka bihī): anything less than that He
forgives to whoever He will, but anyone who joins partners with God has concocted a tremendous sin.”
Sūrat al-mā’ida (The Feast) 4:48.

have derived the word for humanity, al-nās not from its etymologically sound root uns
(‘conviviality’) but from nasiya ‘forgetfulness’.41 And just as Islām acknowledges a Fall
without original sin, there seems also to be a Creation without previous chaos. The
chaos that lurks in Islām is actually always a threat, even though historically the
jāhiliyya period is given a specific date. This periodization would seem to be more for
convenient reference to remind the believer of the true character of jahl so that it may
be recognized and countered whenever it is present.

“[J]āhilīyah was conceived by Muḥammad and his companions not as a period of time
that had now passed away, but rather as something dynamic, a certain psychological
state apparently driven away by the new force of Islām, but surviving secretly in the
minds of the believers, ready to break in at any moment upon their consciousness; and
that this was felt by the Prophet to be a standing menace to the new religion.”42

Islām thus means, in addition to ‘submission’, order, self-discipline and enlightenment
in the context of its own space-time continuum where it sees itself as ringed round by
chaos, temporally (the historic jāhiliyya), spatially (the medieval dār al-Islām), and
existentially (jāhiliyya as a constant inward pressure). Islām as such emerges as a refuge
of order and meaning, precisely a dār al-hijra. In this refuge, symmetry and morality
reflect the oneness (source of symmetry) of God and in the community, the umma,
social and political justice and equity, (of the type delineated, for example, in the
Constitution of Medina) also reflect divine oneness. Thus it emerges that another
possible synonym for jahl is the unforgivable sin mentioned above, shirk ‘polytheism’.
As the opposite of islām and tawḥīd there can be no doubt that these two key words of
the Qur’ānic Weltanschauung bespeak a chaos that is exponentially more dangerous and
threatening than the cosmogonic void of tohubohu; dangerous because it threatens to
break through at all times and, it would seem, is not the sole responsibility of the
merciful God who speaks through the Qur’ān. Perhaps the single most eloquent
argument or statement against chaos, nihilism, meaninglessness, vanity and emptiness
(for which a frequent Qur’ānic term is bāṭil - the diametric opposite of the Qur’ānic
term for truth or reality in the highest possible degree, al-ḥaqq43) is the theory of signs
found in those several verses thought of as elaborating and constituting a distinctive
Qur’ānic theme. The most frequently quoted is the one in which it is made clear in no
uncertain terms that human consciousness is “imprisoned” in a cosmos of meaning
from which there can be no escape. The key term here, āya, sing. (āy/āyāt, pl.), is also
the distinctive term by which a Qur’ānic verse is known (verses of ‘mere’ poetry are
called bayt/abyāt). It is equivalent to the Hebrew oth, and the Aramaic and Syriac āthā.
In the Qur’ān and Islamic usage it should be further nuanced as ‘miraculous sign’,
‘portent’, or perhaps even ‘meaning event’.44 As such, the term may have something in

common with the sēmeia of the Gospel of John.45 In any case, it has provided countless
generations of Muslim intellectuals with guidance, confirmation and inspiration in
their attempts to reconcile the twin sources of knowledge recognized by their
tradition: revelation and reason. The verse runs as follows:

“We shall show them Our signs in every region of the earth and in themselves, until it becomes
clear to them that this is the Truth.” Sūrat fuṣṣilat (Expounded) 41:53

Thus the entire creation is a cosmos of order, beauty and, most importantly meaning.
Each created thing (and all ‘things’ – ashyā ’ – are by definition created) is a ‘sign’, a
meaning event. Such signs appear in every region (fī ’l-afāq, lit: ‘in the horizons’, ‘in the
external realm’, ‘in the macrocosm’) and in the souls of human beings: “in themselves”
(fī anfusihim, lit: “in their souls”, ‘in the interior realm’, ‘in the microcosm’). All of these
multifarious loci of meaning are to be understood by the aid of those literary ‘signs’ of
the Qur’ān, the divine verses themselves. According to the Qur’ān, it was not a
cosmogonic creation of a perfect world out of primordial chaos that is responsible for
such order, rather it is the birth of consciousness identified with the Day of the
Covenant mentioned above. The difference between jahl and islām, savagery and
civilization, chaos and order is determined by the ability to read aright the signs of
Allāh wherever they may be encountered, and they are encountered everywhere.

Is this an apocalyptic vision? Recent scholarship has advanced the study of
apocalypse by refining a definition of the genre. Such refined definitions are based
upon the identification of several motives and categories frequently found in such
texts. Of the several literary and religious textual features thus isolated and
characterized it is important to note that many, if not all, occur in the Qur’ān. Such an
insight has implications for the study of comparative scripture. This research could
help to refine our thinking about the relationship between the Qur’ān and an
apocalyptic cultural and literary landscape out of which it may have arisen. These
striking literary qualities are what seem to set the Qur’ān text apart from other
scriptures. Simultaneously, they also provide evidence for the ebbing of an apocalyptic
imagination. Such a study helps us approach the question, using terminology from
other traditions, of how in Islam heresy became orthodoxy. The apocalyptic themes so
prominent in the Qur’ān are eventually pressed into the service of dividing the world
into two mutually exclusive domains: the so-called dār al-islām, ‘the abode of islām’ and
the dār al-ḥarb, ‘the abode of strife’. It is difficult not to associate these two categories
with the parallel notions of cosmos and chaos.

in the Gospel of John (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2004).
