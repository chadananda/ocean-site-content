 The Ten Plagues of the Exodus in Light of the

Bahá’í Writings

JoAnn M. Borovicka

The biblical narrative of the ten plagues is one of the most
memorable accounts in the Hebrew Bible1 and plays a central
role in the larger story of the Israelites’ Exodus from Egypt
under the leadership of Moses. While traditionally assumed to
be a record of ancient history, research in archaeology as well as
studies in ancient literature over the past century report a lack
of extra-biblical evidence of the Exodus events. This is of
interest to Bahá’ís because the Central Figures2 of the Bahá’í
Faith mention elements of the Exodus in Their Writings.
Questions arise: how are we to understand the Bahá’í references
to the Exodus? Are the Central Figures using superhuman
knowledge to confirm the historical accuracy of some elements
of the Exodus story, or is there another explanation? Is belief in
the historicity of the Exodus important in the Bahá’í Faith? The
purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the historical
accuracy of the Exodus story is not essential to a Bahá’í
appreciation of that scripture. To this end, it will review the
story of the Exodus, look at a sample of scholarship regarding
the historicity of the Exodus in general and the ten plagues
specifically, examine a selection of Bahá’í teachings regarding
ancient scripture, and explore possibilities on the contemporary
significance of the story of the ten plagues in light of the Bahá’í
Writings.

The setting of the Exodus narrative is generally dated to the
thirteenth century B.C. in the Nile Delta area of Egypt.3 As
presented in the Book of Exodus the Israelites, who had come

10                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 16

as immigrants to Egypt about four hundred years earlier, were
under the control of a tyrannical Pharaoh4 who kept them in
forced labor. Despite this treatment, the Israelites strengthened
and multiplied. Pharaoh, noting their strength and numbers,
became fearful of an uprising and consequently ordered the
murder of all baby boys born to Israeli women. From this
oppression arose the heroic figure of Moses.

Speaking from the Burning Bush, God commissioned Moses
to confront Pharaoh and deliver the Israelites from Egypt.
Pharaoh responded by increasing the people’s workload. After
another refusal by Pharaoh, God, through Moses, smote the
land with a series of ten plagues: the Egyptian waters turning
into blood; an invasion of frogs; gnats as numerous as the dust;
swarms of flies; diseased livestock; festering boils on people
and animals; thunder, fire and hail; an invasion of locusts; three
days of darkness; and the death of every Egyptian firstborn.5

After the last plague, Pharaoh agreed to release the Israelites,
who were then led by Moses out of Egypt by way of the Red
(Reed6) Sea. The refugees had travelled just a few days when
Pharaoh changed his mind and set out with his army and
charioteers to retrieve them. As the Egyptian forces
approached, Moses stretched His hand over the sea, the water
parted, and the Israelites crossed through this dry passage.
When the Egyptians pursued, Moses stretched His hand over
the sea once more, the waters closed, and all of the Egyptian
forces were drowned. Thus, the Israelites escaped oppression in
Egypt and Moses continued to lead the people through the
wilderness toward the Land of Canaan — roughly present day
Israel.7

The story of the Exodus has endured well over two thousand
years8 and is commemorated annually by the Jewish holiday of
Passover. But does it represent historical fact? Mírzá Abu’l-
Fa∂l,9 a renowned Near Eastern scholar of the early 20th
century, points out the lack of evidence of any of the Exodus
events up to that time. He states, “No trace has been found of

Plagues of the Exodus                                           11

Moses’ mission to the Israelites, their plea for salvation from
Pharaoh's tyranny through Moses’ leadership, or their
emigration to the plains of Syria under his standard.”10 He says
that “those with insight” should note this lack of evidence:

> For it is unimaginable that the Egyptians, who depicted
> on walls every event, great or small, and inscribed in
> stone everything that happened in Egypt, whether
> temporal or religious in nature, should have neglected to
> mention such extraordinary and stupendous occurrences
> as Moses’ demonstration of amazing signs and the
> drowning of Pharaoh and his huge army.11

Since the time of Mírzá Abu’l-Fa∂l much has been learned
about the history of the ancient Israelites, but evidence
regarding the Exodus is still lacking. As recently stated by the
eminent Egyptologist Donald B. Redford, the entire Exodus
story “remains the most elusive of all the salient events of
Israelite history. The event is supposed to have taken place in
Egypt, yet Egyptian sources know it not.”12 While the general
situation of immigrants being conscripted into forced labor in
the delta region of ancient Egypt is verified, extra-biblical
evidence of a large group of Israelites in Egypt, the ten plagues,
or the movement of the Israelites from Egypt to the Land of
Canaan is lacking.13 Eric H. Cline, professor of ancient history
and archeology at George Washington University, states, “there
is currently virtually nothing that sheds a specific light on the
historicity of the Exodus — all is inference so far.”14 Israel
Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman, both noted archaeologists
and historians, describe the rigorous Egyptian monitoring and
record-keeping of the Egypt/Canaan border at the calculated
time of Moses and point out the unlikelihood of an unrecorded
mass escape:

> The border between Canaan and Egypt was thus closely
> controlled. If a great mass of fleeing Israelites had
> passed thorough the border fortifications of the

> tomb inscriptions, nor in papyri. Israel is absent — as a
> possible foe of Egypt, as a friend, or as an enslaved
> nation.15

The eventual settlement of the Israelites in the Land of
Canaan is historical fact.16 The Israelites enslavement in or mass
escape from Egypt has not been confirmed. Considering this
lack of empirical evidence in Egypt as well as other information
gleaned through study of extra-biblical texts and extensive
archaeological research in Israel,17 the story of the Exodus is, in
many circles, thought of as “not a miraculous revelation, but a
brilliant product of the human imagination . . . woven together
from an astonishingly rich collection of historical writings,
memories, legends, folk tales, anecdotes, royal propaganda,
prophecy, and ancient poetry” sometime in the sixth or seventh
century B.C.18,19 Today, among biblical scholars, the Exodus
narrative is often referred to as one of “the founding myths of
Israel.”20

While the historical record thus far indicates a lack of
evidence of the Exodus events, there have been many attempts
to prove the physical truth of the ten plagues through the earth
sciences. Some of these ‘natural cause’ theories have taken on
an aura of fact as they have become popularized by television
documentaries. Velikovsky’s hypothesis, the earliest of the
natural cause theories, proposes that the series of plagues was
initiated by a comet passing to close to earth.21 Another

Plagues of the Exodus                                          13

suggests that the plagues were initiated by the concurrent
flooding of the Nile, a red tide of algae, and widespread anthrax
infection.22 The medical team of Marr and Malloy suggest the
possibility that Pfiesteriae, a toxic microorganism fatal to fish,
contaminated the Nile and caused widespread havoc.23 Perhaps
the most popular proposal, the Thera Theory, places the cause
of the plagues on two ancient volcano eruptions on the Greek
Island of Thera (present day Santorini) in the Aegean Sea.24

While the details of the natural cause theories vary, in
general they propose a domino-like series of catastrophes such
as: a weather anomaly causing poisoned water resulting in dead
fish; frogs escaping the water and invading the land; a
consequent overgrowth of gnats, flies, and locusts; pollution of
the food supply resulting in disease; and (in some theories)
human sacrifice of the firstborns in an effort to appease the
gods who were blamed for all the chaos, thereafter remembered
as the death of the firstborns. Some theories include a parting
of the waters caused by a tsunami initiated by post-volcanic
seismic forces.25

The common theme of the various natural cause explanations
is that the plagues and the parting of the waters were caused by
a sequence of natural events that may or may not have been
intentionally initiated by God Himself. However, despite the
popularity of these theories, definite proof is still not
forthcoming.26 Refuting the natural cause model, physicist and
theologian Mark Harris, University of Edinburgh’s Lecturer on
Science and Religion, states, “considerable scholarship, both
scientific and biblical . . . indicate that this model cannot be
reasonably sustained.”27,28 To date, there is no conclusive
evidence of the Exodus events in the historical records
disclosed by archaeology, the study of ancient Near Eastern
literature, or the earth sciences.

The lack of evidence of the Exodus events in the historical
record is noteworthy. But how important should the extra-
biblical historical record be to the Bahá’í community in its

14                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 16

understanding of the story? According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the
historical record is important and can be used as an indicator of
whether biblical verses should be understood literally or
symbolically. In response to a question about the historicity of
certain other biblical events,29 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states, “As these
events have not been recorded in any history, it is evident that
they are not to be understood literally but according to their
inner meaning.” [SAQ 44] In light of this guidance, it follows
that Bahá’ís should look for inner meaning in the Exodus
narrative as, to date, the historicity of these events has not
been corroborated by extra-biblical records. Indeed, seeking
spiritual truth without being attached to the necessity of having
a literal interpretation is a fundamental principle in a Bahá’í
approach to the Bible. As explained in a letter written on behalf
of Shoghi Effendi: “When ‘Abdul-Bahá states we believe what is
in the Bible, He means in substance. Not that we believe every
word of it to be taken literally or that every word is the
authentic saying of the Prophet.” [LOG 494] Therefore, the
possibility that the Exodus narrative is not journalistic history
and that one should focus on its allegorical meanings is
consistent with Bahá’í teachings.

In the process of investigating the symbolic nature of the
Exodus narrative, it is fascinating, even a little surprising, to
see that all of the Central Figures of the Bahá’í Faith mention a
key element of the story — the enslavement of the Israelites
under a tyrannical Pharaoh — in Their Writings.30 For example,
in a commentary on the Mosaic Dispensation in The Secret of
Divine Civilization, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states, “The enslavement . . .
of the Hebrews was such that they were not able to provide any
defense for their wives and families against the tyranny of their
Pharaonic captors.” [SDC 75] How is this reference, and others
similar to it, to be understood? Does mention of an Exodus
event in the Writings of the Central Figures of the Faith
indicate its literal truth, or is there another way to interpret
these references? How are Bahá’ís to understand it when the

Plagues of the Exodus                                             15

Central Figures mention a biblical story that modern scholars
largely identify as parable — not fact?

Mírzá Abu’l-Fa∂l addresses this question directly by
explaining that the Prophets often speak to the traditional
understandings of the people. He states:

[T]he prophets have indulged the people in regard to
> their historical notions, folk stories, and scientific
> principles, and have spoken to them according to these.
> They conversed as was appropriate to their audience and
> hid certain realities behind the curtain of allusion. . . .

> Finally, it is well known that neither the Prophet
> Muhammad nor the rest of the Prophets ever engaged in
> disputes with the people about their historical beliefs,
> but addressed them according to their local traditions.31

Addressing students ‘where they are’ in the process of
moving them forward is a universal method of effective
teachers and one described by Bahá’u’lláh as a strategy of the
Divine Educator. He states, “All that I have revealed unto thee
with the tongue of power, and have written for thee with the
pen of might, hath been in accordance with thy capacity and
understanding, not with My state and the melody of My voice.”
[AHW #67] Knowing that the Prophets speak to the capacities of
the people includes awareness that the words of the Prophets
are not limited to cultural connotations. The Universal House
of Justice states:

> Although, in conveying His Revelation, the
> Manifestation uses the language and culture of the
> country into which He is born, He is not confined to
> using terminology with the same connotations as those
> given to it by His predecessors or contemporaries; He
> delivers His message in a form which His audience, both
> immediate and in centuries to come, is capable of
> grasping. [8 February 1998]
16                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 16

Cultural connotations could be literal understandings as well
as other culturally imposed perceptions. Considering the above
guidance, it follows that when the Central Figures of the Faith
draw on the imagery of a biblical story in Their teachings
additional information may be required to determine if that
event is historical fact or cultural tradition.

An examination of the complete passage from The Secret of
Divine Civilization previously mentioned offers additional
information which suggests that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is conforming to
the audience’s traditional understandings of the Exodus. Before
His commentary on the Israelites captivity under a tyrannical
Pharaoh and their movement from Egypt to the Promised Land,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá states,

> The events that transpired at the advent of the Prophets
> of the past, and Their ways and works and
> circumstances, are not adequately set down in
> authoritative histories, and are referred to only in
> condensed form in the verses of the Qur’án, the Holy
> Traditions and the Torah. . . . To preclude once and for
> all objections on the part of any of the world's peoples,
> We shall conduct Our discussion conformably to those
> authoritative accounts which all nations are agreed
> upon. [SDC 75]

If historical happenings are “not adequately set down” but
“condensed” to essential meanings, it may be possible that the
final product could be mythology, legend, parable, fable,
poetry, or any number of literary forms suitable for conveying
higher significances to the heart. However reliably these
figurative forms of language may communicate significant
meanings, they may or may not express historical facts. Also,
considering ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement that He is reviewing the
story of the Israelites “conformably” to that which is generally
agreed upon, it is important to note that this commentary was
written in 1875 which was just at the dawn of higher biblical
criticism (the application of analytical measures to biblical

Plagues of the Exodus                                            17

texts).32,33 At that time it was largely thought that Moses wrote
the Torah and that it represented historical fact. Indeed,
Finkelstein and Silberman report that until the 1970s even the
science of archaeology in the land of the Bible was driven by an
acceptance of the narratives of the Torah “at face value”.34,35

After this introduction, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá mentions the
Israelites’ captivity in Egypt and eventual movement toward
the Promised Land in a manner that directs the reader’s focus to
the spiritual essence of the story: the Divine guidance of the
Manifestation, the enlightenment of the people, and the
evolution of unity. For example, He states:

> In the midst of the Israelites, He [Moses] blazed out like
> a lamp of Divine guidance, and by the light of salvation
> He led that lost people out of the shadows of ignorance
> into knowledge and perfection. He gathered Israel's
> scattered tribes into the shelter of the unifying and
> universal Word of God, and over the heights of union
> He raised up the banner of harmony, so that within a
> brief interval those benighted souls became spiritually
> educated, and they who had been strangers to the truth,
> rallied to the cause of the oneness of God, and were
> delivered out of their wretchedness, their indigence,
> their incomprehension and captivity and achieved a
> supreme degree of happiness and honor. [SCD 76]

The above passage engages the imagery of the Exodus while
simultaneously widening the concept of ‘captivity’ by equating
bondage with conditions of the mind and the spirit, such as
ignorance — thereby making this element of the Exodus story
universally relevant.36 It also confirms the spiritual
transformation engendered by the Mosaic Dispensation in the
general context of the Exodus narrative without focusing on
historical details that require literal interpretation.

In light of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement that He was conducting
His discussion of the Israelites development under Moses

18                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 16

“conformably” to what was “agreed upon”, His focus on the
inner meaning of the captivity of the Israelites in the same
passage, His guidance that lack of evidence in the historical
record indicates that biblical scripture should be understood
for its inner (not literal) meaning, and the lack of evidence of
the Exodus events in the historical record to date, I propose
that when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá mentions the Israelites enslavement
under a tyrannical Pharaoh He is not giving a history lesson —
He is giving a spiritual lesson delivered through the imagery of
a cultural tradition.

In addition, given Bahá’u’lláh’s statement that the
Manifestation of God speaks according to the capacity of the
people, and also taking into account the elucidation by the
House of Justice that cultural connotations cannot be assumed
in the words of the Manifestation, I would propose that it
would not be unreasonable to understand Bahá’u’lláh’s and the
Báb’s occasional mention of the Israelites’ captivity under
Pharaoh in the same symbolic manner.

When asked why symbolism was such an integral part of
religious scripture, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explained,

> Divine things are too deep to be expressed by common
> words. The heavenly teachings are expressed in parable
> in order to be understood and preserved for ages to
> come. When the spiritually minded dive deeply into the
> ocean of their meaning they bring to the surface the
> pearls of their inner significance. [ABL 79]

One wonders about the inner significances of the ten plagues
— this ancient story that continues to engage imaginations over
two thousand years after its composition. Fortunately, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá provides an authoritative interpretation for the first
plague of waters turning into blood.37 His explanation comes in
an unexpected context — the section of Some Answered
Questions entitled “Commentary on the Eleventh Chapter of
the Revelation of John” (the last book of the New Testament).

Throughout this commentary, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains how the
eleventh chapter of the Book of Revelation foretells events in
the Dispensation of Muhammad. Revelation 11:6 draws on the
imagery of water turning to blood. In the process of
interpreting this verse, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also unveils an
interpretation of the first plague of the Exodus:

“And have power over waters to turn them to blood.”
> [Rev 11:6] This means that the prophethood of
> Muhammad was similar to that of Moses, and the power
> of ‘Alí like that of Joshua. That is, it was in their power,
> had they so desired, to turn the waters of the Nile into
> blood for the Egyptians and the deniers — or, in other
> words, to turn, in consequence of their ignorance and
> pride, that which was the source of their life into the
> cause of their death. Thus the sovereignty, wealth, and
> power of Pharaoh and of his people, which were the
> source of that nation’s life, became, as a result of their
> opposition, denial, and pride, the very cause of their
> death, ruin, destruction, degradation, and wretchedness.
> Hence these two witnesses have power to destroy
> nations. [SAQ 58]

From this explanation it can be understood that the Nile, in
all aspects the water of life to the Egyptians, symbolizes the
traditional source of sovereignty, wealth, and power that
became outdated with the appearance of the Mosaic
Revelation. This same dynamic repeated itself with the
appearance of the Muhammadan Revelation as prophesied in
the Book of Revelation. In Abdu’l-Bahá’s explanation, the
spoiling of the river is symbolic of the way that denying the
Manifestation of God and holding onto outdated forms of
sovereignty, wealth, and power can be oppressive. Archetypal
truth is expressed in figurative terms as waters turning to
blood.

While direct explanations for the other nine plagues are not
found in the Bahá’í Writings,38 examining the plague terms as

20                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 16

they are used in other contexts in the Writings can inform
personal reflection and help lovers of the plague narrative to
discover spiritual meanings for themselves. For example, the
following statement by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá where He compares
rumormongers with the “croaking of frogs” and the “buzzing
of flies” inspires ideas of what the plagues of frogs and flies
may symbolize today:

> Verily, I, through the grace of my Lord, have never
> heeded these souls, even to reading their articles,
> inasmuch as their articles signify no other than the
> buzzing of flies to the hearing of an eagle, or the
> croaking of a frog of the material world to the ears of
> the leviathan of the sea of the Kingdom. Is it to be
> considered as anything? No, by no means! Verily, the
> eagle soareth high in the supreme apex while the flies
> rumble in the lowest rubbish. [TAB2 349]

Along the same vein, the plague of gnats comes to mind in
Bahá’u’lláh’s encouragement to not become disheartened by the
peoples of the world who are “filled with dismay”:

> Take heed lest Thou falter on that Day when all created
> things are filled with dismay; rather be Thou the revealer
> of My name, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.
> Assist Thy Lord to the utmost of Thine ability, and pay
> no heed to the peoples of the world, for that which their
> mouths utter is like unto the droning of a gnat in an
> endless valley. [SLH 10]

The plague of lightening, thunder, and hail becomes
something more than violent weather when considered through
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s interpretation of these images in a New
Testament verse:

“And there were lightnings, and voices, and
> thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail”
> [Revelation 11:19], meaning that after the appearance of

> the Book of the Testament there will be a great storm,
> and the lightnings of the anger and the wrath of God
> will flash, the noise of the thunder of the violation of
> the Covenant will resound, the earthquake of doubts
> will take place, the hail of torments will beat upon the
> violators of the Covenant, and even those who profess
> belief will fall into trials and temptations. [SAQ 69-70]

Similarly, the plague of darkness takes on fresh meaning
when one considers Bahá’u’lláh’s teaching that God’s purpose in
sending His Prophets unto men is “first is to liberate the
children of men from the darkness of ignorance, and guide
them to the light of true understanding.” [GWB 79]

Reflection on a sample of the plagues in light of the above
Bahá’í quotations demonstrates the value of focusing on inner
meanings. Instead of one-time frogs, flies, gnats, darkness,
lightening, thunder, and hail that may or may not have caused
mayhem three thousand years ago, these afflictions become
powerful symbols in an easy-to-remember story that reminds us
of the ultimate futility of falsehood and dismay, the dangers of
the violation of the Covenant, the inevitability of doubts and
temptations, and the suffering caused by ignorance. There is no
need to argue about whether or not the plagues happened three
thousand years ago — these are things that plague us today.

While the above Bahá’í quotations may inspire ideas about
the spiritual meanings of the plagues, the suggested
interpretations are not offered as a primitive exegesis. We may
never know the intent of the storytellers who passed on the
images of the plagues, or know how later editors and redactors
understood them — and that is perfectly acceptable because
reading the Bible is not all about historical context. Noted
theologian Gerald L. Bruns points out that, “The whole
orientation of Scripture is toward its future, not toward its
past.”39 One of the greatest values of pondering the inner
meanings of biblical Scripture is not necessarily to focus on the

22                                               Lights of Irfán vol. 16

context of ancient cultures, but to nurture the heart today and
tomorrow. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states:

> All the texts and teachings of the holy Testaments have
> intrinsic spiritual meanings. They are not to be taken
> literally. I, therefore, pray in your behalf that you may
> be given the power of understanding these inner real
> meanings of the Holy Scriptures and may become
> informed of the mysteries deposited in the words of the
> Bible so that you may attain eternal life and that your
> hearts may be attracted to the Kingdom of God. [PUP
> 459]

More historical information concerning the physical
journeys and circumstances of the Israelites in the early days of
the Mosaic Dispensation may be discovered by archaeology and
other disciplines in the future, or may be lost to time, but the
Bahá’í Writings indicate that inner meanings related to the
Mosaic Dispensation live in the biblical story. Whether or not
the details are confirmed in the historical record, the Bahá’í
Writings acknowledge the biblical text as a spiritual guide to
the Kingdom.

NOTES

\[1\] . The Hebrew Bible correlates in general to the Old Testament of the

Christian Bible.

\[2\] . The Central Figures of the Bahá’í Faith are Bahá’u’lláh, the Báb, and

‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

\[3\] . Killebrew, p. 151.

\[4\] . The Pharaoh is not named. According to Fokkelman, “Pharaoh” is

> probably an emblematic title meant to encompass all of the Egyptian
> kings who exploited generations of Israelites in the Exodus story
> (Fokkelman, p. 59).

\[5\] . The ten afflictions are variously referred to as signs and wonders, plagues,

and blows (Houston, p. 73).

\[6\] . Hebrew Yam Suph; that is, Sea of Reeds (Exodus 15:4 NIV, note a.).

\[7\] . Biblical and historical terms for this land area include Land of Canaan, the

> Promised Land, the Holy Land, Palestine, Israel and Judah, the State of
> Israel, and the Southern Levant. Biblical boundaries of this land area vary.

See Genesis 15, Exodus 23, Numbers 34, and Ezekiel 47.

\[8\] . The current understanding based on the Documentary Hypothesis is that

> the Book of Exodus was created from a variety of materials through a
> long two-stage process of authorship. One source (referred to as J or
> Jawist/Yawist) composed the bulk of the work probably in the sixth or
> seventh century B.C. The second (P or Priestly) author expanded on the
> story in the late sixth or fifth century B.C. (Houston 68). For more
> information on the Documentary Hypothesis see Friedman 1987, 2005.

\[9\] . Mírzá Abu’l-Fa∂l-i-Gulpáygání: “The most outstanding scholar of the

> Bahá’í Faith”; lived at the time of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; named
> one of the nineteen Apostles of Bahá’u’lláh by Shoghi Effendi (Momen,
> pp. 6-7).

\[16\] . For example, the Merneptah stele indicates the existence of a people

> referred to as “Israel” in the Land of Canaan at the very end of the
> thirteenth century B.C.; archaeological evidence shows signs of a distinct
> Israelite presence in the Land of Canaan in the Iron Age; the Tel Dan
> inscription shows evidence of the existence of the House of David in the
> ninth century (Finkelstein and Silberman, pp. 57, 118-119, 129).

\[17\] . Extensive archaeological research in Israel over the past thirty years

> reveals a story that differs from the Hebrew Bible — that being the
> gradual emergence of the Israelite tribes from within the Land of Canaan.
> In the words of Finkelstein and Silberman, “There was no mass Exodus
> from Egypt. There was no violent conquest of Canaan” (Finkelstein and
> Silberman, p. 118). It is noteworthy that Israel Finkelstein, one of the
> authors of this statement, is the past Director of the Sonia and Marco

\[28\] . For example, the Thera hypothesis suffers in that it is now known that

\[29\] . Matthew 27:51-53.

\[30\] . For example: Bahá’u’lláh, ESW 63; Bahá’u’lláh, KI 63; The Báb, SWB 26;

Writings, see Stockman, pp. 107-114.

\[34\] . Finkelstein and Silberman, p. 21.

\[35\] . Divine authorship of the Bible is still a popular view. In the 1996 Gallup

> pole it was reported that 35% of Americans believed that the Bible is the
> literal and inerrant word of the Creator of the universe (Gallup, 1996).

\[36\] . The concept of captivity as a condition of the soul is a prominent theme

> in the Bahá’í Writings. Bahá’u’lláh states, “He is indeed a captive who
> hath not recognized the Supreme Redeemer, but hath suffered his soul to
> be bound, distressed and helpless, in the fetters of his desires” [GWB
> 169].

\[37\] . Exodus 7:19-21.

\[38\] . That is, at this time, this writer has not found direct interpretations of

> biblical plagues two through ten in the Bahá’í Writings that are available
> to her in English.
