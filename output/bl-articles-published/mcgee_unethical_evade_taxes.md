Introduction

Until recently, not much has appeared in either the accounting
or ethical literature on the ethics of tax evasion.2 Perhaps the reason is

for their comments and suggestions. The author can be contacted at

2 The most comprehensive recent item on this topic is THE ETHICS OF TAX EVASION
(Robert W. McGee, ed. 1998). Many of the chapters in this book also appeared in THE
JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING, ETHICS & PUBLIC POLICY (1998). The most
comprehensive treatment of tax evasion from an ethical perspective, as far as the author
can determine, is Martin T. Crowe, The Moral Obligation of Paying Just Taxes.
Catholic University of America Studies in Sacred Theology No. 84. Doctoral
Dissertation, 1944. However, Crowe's treatment is limited to Christian (mostly Catholic)
scholarship.

that accountants cringe at the thought of admitting in writing that tax
evasion is not always unethical. Perhaps scholars are afraid that the
Internal Revenue Service will punish them if they take the wrong
position on the topic. However, the topic is an important one and one
that needs to be discussed in these times of corrupt governments and
bloated welfare states.

This article reviews the literature on the ethics of tax evasion
from various religious perspectives, focusing on the question of whether
tax evasion is unethical if the payments would go to an evil or corrupt
state. Not surprisingly, the various religious perspectives do not agree.
Surprisingly, the Jewish literature strongly suggests that it would be
unethical to evade taxes under the Nazi regime, even though the taxes
collected might be used to kill Jews.

There is at least one caveat that the reader must keep in mind
when reading this article. The various religious views discussed in this
article are based on just one or two authors from each religious
perspective. For example, I could find just two Jewish authors who
addressed the ethics of tax evasion from the Jewish perspective. My
comments on the Jewish view of tax evasion is based on the premise
that the views expressed in their articles are representative of "the"
Jewish view.3 I could find only one article on the Baha'i, Mormon and
Muslim views and a few on various Christian perspectives, other than
the articles I wrote from these perspectives,4 so the reader must be

warned that the views of the authors I cite in this article may not be
representative of the various religious views. But since I was unable to
find other articles from the various religious perspectives, it is the best
approach that could be taken under the circumstances. If readers
disagree with the views expressed by any of the authors I cite, I invite
them to write articles of their own expressing their differing opinions and
citing the relevant religious literature to support their view. There is still
room for contributions to the literature in this area, since it is so sparsely
covered.

What Constitutes an Evil or Corrupt State?

Perhaps the threshold question is what constitutes an evil or
corrupt state? The answer is complicated by the fact that all
governments are evil or corrupt to a greater or lesser extent. The Nazi
regime of 1933-45 is regarded by many as the most evil regime of the
twentieth century, although Stalin's Russia and Mao's China actually
killed more people than did Hitler and Pol Pot's regime in Cambodia
killed a larger percentage of the local population than did any of the
three evil regimes mentioned above.5 The Turks killed two million
Armenians in 1915, so that regime might also be added to the list of evil
regimes.

But a regime does not have to kill a lot of people to be evil or
corrupt. Some governments in Eastern Europe, the CIS, Latin America

OF ACCOUNTING, ETHICS & PUBLIC POLICY (Summer 1998).
5 In Germany, Austria, Switzerland and (perhaps) Canada it is illegal to ask "How many
died?" regarding the Nazi holocaust. I find such laws disgusting. The "official" number of
Jews killed by Hitler is six million. However, this number has been challenged. Several
studies have estimated the number of Jews killed to be much lower. The authors of these
studies were immediately labeled anti-Semitic, as is anyone who asks the question, "How
many died?" which I think is unfortunate. To further complicate matters, some of the
people who have made a career of asking this question are admitted Nazis. Someone
should write an article on this point from the perspective of free speech and press and the
abuse of government power and special interest group influence on government.

and Asia could be labeled as corrupt, if not evil, because of the rampant
bribery and suppression of individual rights. Western welfare states
could be labeled corrupt because of their high tax rates and
redistributive policies.6

Another measure of corruption is the degree of economic
freedom that is denied to citizens. Various studies have attempted to
measure the amount of economic freedom in various countries, using up
to 50 different variables. The Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street
journal publish such surveys annually.7

How evil or corrupt does a government have to be before tax
evasion is no longer unethical?8 Should evil or corruption be measured
by the number or percentage of lives terminated or ruined? Or by the
total per capita tax bite taken? What if the government in question does
not ruin many lives but merely makes life much more difficult? What if
the government occasionally bombs other countries or confiscates the
assets of its citizens without due process?9

If the system is a federal system and neither the federal nor the
state or local governments meet the threshold for evil or corruption, can
tax evasion be ethical if the total tax bite or total evil or corruption from
all three levels of government exceeds the threshold amount? Can it be

good case has been made to this effect. See BERTRAND DEJOUVENEL, THE ETHICS OF

withhold more than that portion?

ethical to evade some taxes but not others? Does the moral duty to pay
taxes end when tax collections exceed a certain percentage of income
or a certain dollar amount?10 Could it be that tax evasion is ethical for
some individuals and unethical for other individuals who live under the
same regime? If so, what determines when evasion is ethical and when it
is not? Does income level determine when evasion changes from
unethical to ethical? Or need? Does evasion for a family of 10 become
ethical at a different income level than evasion for a single individual with
no dependents?11

There are many ways to look at the question of when evasion
changes from being unethical to being ethical. This article will not
address these issues in any depth because the focus of this article is to
compare and analyze the various religious arguments that have been
made on the topic of the ethics of tax evasion. Examination of these
issues, however, is ripe, because they have not yet been examined in the
literature.

The Jewish Perspective

The two articles on the ethics of tax evasion from the Jewish
perspective that I could find reached remarkably similar conclusions
although the authors cited different literature to support their positions.12

154 McGee: Is It Unethical to Evade Taxes in an Evil or Corrupt State?

Meir Tamari states that there is a moral obligation on society to fund
social costs, which are recognized by halakhah (the corpus of Jewish
law). This obligation goes beyond funding for defense and infrastructure
and includes the needs of the poor, the sick and the old as well as
religious study and the religious needs of the community.13 But the tax
laws may be disregarded where the king usurps power or where the
laws are capricious or discriminatory.14 This view would seemingly
allow for tax evasion in some cases. However, Tamari goes on to say:

> Jewish legal literature is clear that non-payment of taxes
> is theft and is therefore forbidden. This is shown in all

> case of public theft since all the owners and
> beneficiaries are unknown to the perpetrator.15

In this statement, Tamari turns the traditional "taxation is theft"

argument on its head by stating that it is tax evasion that is theft. This
position can easily be criticized, at least in cases where the tax is unjust.
If a tax is unjust, there is no obligation to pay. The fact that others must
pay more if you pay less merely means that the tax collector must steal
more from others. That sin is on the head of the tax collector, not those
who are able to evade the tax. Tamari does not address this possibility.

Tamari also states that tax evasion is unethical because it must
necessarily involve lies and falsehoods, which can lead to corruption in
other areas of life as well.16 According to Tamari, telling a lie, even
when not under oath, amounts to a denial of the existence of God.17

The literature on the ethics of lie-telling could be discussed here,
but Tamari does not do it. This literature, going back to Plato and
Aristotle, points out that telling lies is not always unethical. For example,
if a crazed husband barges into your home shouting "I am going to kill
my wife, where is she?" there is no moral obligation to tell him where
she is. You can say you don't know, even if you do know.

However, Tamari's point is well-taken. Where lying is rampant
in one area, such as in tax evasion, there is a tendency for it to spread
into other areas, thus corrupting the society. However, the blame for
that corruption should be placed on those who have made the unjust tax
laws (assuming they are unjust), not on those who merely try to protect
their property. Tamari goes on to say:

> So even if the tax evasion seems justified morally,
> because of the high tax rates or waste in the public

> perhaps involving a jail sentence, rather than accepting
> the unethical effects of tax evasion.18

One problem with Tamari's position is that a wasteful public
sector or a government that has high tax rates cannot easily be changed
via the ballot box. The literature that has been generated by the Public
Choice School of Economics over the last thirty years or so makes this
point clear. Special interests convince the legislature to pass some
spending bill that benefits them at the expense of the general public.
Every special interest group under the sun tries to influence the
legislature to pass laws that benefit them and the legislature often
responds favorably. So, as a practically matter, the ballot box is almost
useless. In the meantime, Tamari would allow the taxpaying public to
continue to be fleeced.

Serving a jail sentence rather than evade unjust taxes seems a
bit extreme, especially if one has to support a family. It is not unethical
to hide money from a thief, even if the thief would spend the money
wisely. How can it be unethical to hide money from a corrupt
government that squanders the money it raises from tax collections?

Perhaps the central flaw in Tamari's reasoning is that he thinks
that individuals have some duty to "society." The problem with this view
is that "society" does not exist. Society is just a convenient collective
term that describes a collection of individuals who share certain things in
common, like geographic location, language (maybe) and culture
(maybe). All obligations are individual in nature. Individuals owe
obligations to other individuals, not to some collective term.

Another flaw in Tamari's argument is that he ignores property
rights. The State does not have an unlimited claim on the property of
taxpayers. There is a limit. The State does not own all the assets, merely

18 Tamari, supra, at 177.
Journal of Accounting, Ethics & Public Policy                    157

Volume 2, No. 1 (Winter, 1999)

allowing individuals to keep and use some of them.19 Individuals own
assets. Before the State can spend money it first has to take it from
those who have earned it. Tamari ignores this point. If Tamari's position
can be summed up in a single sentence, it would be that tax evasion is
always unethical, even where the government is corrupt.

Gordon Cohn, the other Jewish author, arrives at the same
conclusion using different arguments and citing different Jewish sources.
For Cohn, tax evasion is unethical for four reasons:

> The Halachic (Jewish legal) perspective on paying
> taxes has four components. First, there are laws related
> to a citizen's duty to follow his country's statutes. This is
> called dina damalchusa dina. Second, laws prohibit
> lying. Third, a Jewish person may not do anything which
> could discredit the religion. This is known as Chillul
> Hashem. Finally, since it is essential for a Jewish person
> to perform the maximum number of mitzvos
> (commandments and good deeds), he is required to
> refrain from any activity which could result in
> confinement in a place where Judaism cannot be
> properly practiced, e.g., jail. 20

I will examine these arguments one at a time. Cohn's first
argument is that there is a duty to follow the laws of one's country.
While there may be a duty to follow just laws, strong arguments have
been made that there is a duty to disobey unjust laws. Thus, one cannot
categorically say that one must obey all the laws of the country where
you live because some laws may be unjust. Certainly it would not be

19 When Louis XIV of France heard that the people were complaining about high taxes,
he said that since everything belonged to him, he was only taking what was his.

COURSE OF CIVILIZATION 217 (1993).
unethical to disobey some of the laws of Nazi Germany. One may even
have a duty to do so. Cohn ignores this possibility. If unjust laws (like
segregation in the United States, for example) were not openly
disobeyed, they might never be changed.

Cohn points out that there are laws prohibiting lying. However,
as was pointed out above, lying is not always unethical. It is not
unethical to tell an enraged husband that you do not know where his
wife is. It is not unethical not to tell a thief that you are hiding $20 in
your shoe. And it is not unethical not to disclose the fact that you have
unreported income if the tax collector is not morally entitled to the
funds. Cohn does not allow for any of these possibilities, although he
does mention later that lying in certain situations might not be
unethical.21

The view that a Jewish person may not do anything that would
discredit the religion is based on the premise that someone can owe a
duty to a group or to a group of ideas. However, duties can be owed
only to individuals. Thus, he begins his argument from an incorrect
premise.

The view that one must not do things that might result in a jail
term runs contra to one of Tamari's suggestions, that one should protest
unjust taxes even if it means a jail term, rather than evade the tax in
question. It might also be possible that more mitzvos could be
performed in jail than out of jail, since the jail population has more
needs unfulfilled than the general population.

Cohn elaborates on each of these four reasons, so I will
comment on some of his elaborations as well. Cohn points out that the
Jewish literature states that "the king owns the country and therefore
everyone is required to give him a portion of their income as rent."22
There are a number of problems with this line of reasoning.

21 Cohn, supra, at 184-185.
Volume 2, No. 1 (Winter, 1999)

First of all, most countries don't have kings anymore. Even if we
concede that a modern government might assume the power that kings
formerly had, it does not follow that tax evasion is always unethical
because the king (or the government) is not entitled to all the income or
property of the people living under the government's protection. At
most, they are only entitled to a portion of it. When tax collections
exceed this portion, tax evasion may be justified. Cohn ignores this
possibility, although he does state that "In cases where the king or
leader is not legitimate, dina damalchusa dina could not suffice to
forbid tax evasion."23

Cohn also states that "Continuing to live in a country is an
implicit agreement to abide by its rules."24 There are at least two
problems with this position. For one thing, it may not be possible to
leave a country if you disagree with its rules. You may not have the
financial resources to leave. You may not be able to find another
country willing to admit you due to immigration restrictions. Or the
country in which you live might not allow you to leave. Thus, it cannot
be said that you must obey the rules of the country in which you live
because of some implicit agreement.

The second problem with Cohn's position is that it is possible
that an individual may not agree with the rules of any country. Yet it is a
physical necessity that the individual must live somewhere. Even with
free immigration and emigration and sufficient financial resources to live
anywhere, it is quite possible that an individual would choose to live in
the country that violates his rights the least. So it cannot be said that the
individual in question consents to the laws of the country of residence.
He may have chosen the country in question because it is the least evil
of a number of possible choices.

Cohn states that "…someone living in a society where there is
an illegitimate dictatorship should still pay taxes in order to avoid
prison."25 Presumably, this would include an ethical duty to pay taxes in
Nazi Germany. To push this line of reasoning to its logical conclusion,
one might say that there is an ethical duty to pay taxes to support
concentration camps since failure to do so might result in being placed in
a concentration camp. Very few ethics scholars would agree with this
position.

The reasons these two Jewish scholars advance to support their
positions that tax evasion is unethical tend to crumble upon close
examination. The authors do not address a number of arguments that
would justify tax evasion at least some of the time.

Christian Perspectives26

The various Christian positions differ somewhat. Some Christian
scholars take the position that tax evasion is sometimes justified while
others hold that tax evasion is never justified. These groups even cite
some of the same literature to support their position.

The most comprehensive study I could find on the ethics of tax
evasion from the Christian perspective was Crowe's 1944 study. 27 The
strength of his study is its comprehensiveness. Because he was able to
read Latin, he was able to read source material going back to the days
when Church documents were written in Latin.

If one were to summarize Crowe's paper in a single sentence, it
would be that one should pay just taxes but there is no ethical duty to
pay unjust taxes. This begs the question, of course, since the next logical

26 Some of the material for this portion of the article was taken from Robert W. McGee,
When is Tax Evasion Unethical? in THE ETHICS OF TAX EVASION 5-35 (Robert W.
McGee, ed. 1998).

1998).

Volume 2, No. 1 (Winter, 1999)

question to ask is what is a just tax? He goes into a rather lengthy
discussion of this point, citing numerous religious scholars who do not
always agree with each other.

The most recent Catholic pronouncement that addresses this
point is the new (and improved?) catechism, which states that tax
evasion is a sin.28 The catechism does not go into much detail and many
of the authors Crowe cites would dispute the position given in the new
catechism. Given the fact that the new catechism does not go into much
explanation, coupled with the fact that dozens of Church scholars have
given more detailed explanations that often disagree with the conclusion
given in the new catechism, one may reasonably conclude that the new
catechism's position does not fairly represent the Catholic Church's
view on the matter. If one were to take the catechism's position literally,
that tax evasion is (presumably always) a sin, then it would be a sin not
to pay taxes to the Roman authorities who would fund programs to
throw Christians to the lions, which is ridiculous.

Crowe sets out three criteria for a just tax. 29 To be just, the tax
must:

> • be imposed by a legitimate legislative authority;30
> • for a just cause;31 and
> • where there is a just distribution of the tax burden. 32

These criteria seem like a good starting point for determining
whether a tax is a just tax. However, upon closer analysis, one finds

28 For some brief summaries of the new catechism, see New Rules for an Old Faith,
NEWSWEEK, November 30, 1992, at 71; Sins, ancient and modern, THE
ECONOMIST , November 21, 1992, at 50. For those who don't know what a catechism is,
it might be described as a collection of rules that Catholics are expected to follow. The
new catechism was the first one issued since 1566.

problems. For example, what is a legitimate legislative authority? Hitler
and Mussolini both came to power via the democratic process. Many
older Russians would eagerly elect Stalin if he were on the ballot. Many
people in China would still vote for Mao even though he killed 30 or 40
million Chinese through a combination of brutality and stupid economic
policies that caused millions to starve to death.

If any legislative authority is legitimate, it is probably the U.S.

Congress. Elections are more or less open and fair. The problem is that
the vast majority of elected representatives represent special interests
rather than the general public, which the Public Choice School of
Economics has been pointing out for several decades. If most tax laws
are heavily influenced by special interests, how legitimate is the
legislative authority?

Another problem with determining whether a tax is just is to
determine what is a just cause. Taxes that support activities that protect
life, liberty and property would be the easiest taxes to justify. But what
about the many other activities that bloated welfare states engage in?
Some of those activities are much more difficult to justify. Is a tax just if
the proceeds force some people to pay for other people's leisure? The
unemployment compensation laws in most western democracies are so
attractive that many people find it makes more sense to be on welfare
than to work.

What about forcing those who work to pay retirement benefits
for those who are retired? That is what Social Security taxes do. People
who are still working are forced to pay for those who do not work.
There is no such thing as a legitimate Social Security trust fund. The
people who pay into the fund have no claim on any of the proceeds.
The money in the "trust fund" is not really in trust for anyone. If a private
insurance company established such a fund, the corporate officers
would be convicted of fraud.

Volume 2, No. 1 (Winter, 1999)

The bottom line is that it is questionable, at best, whether a tax
can be just if it forces some people to pay for the benefits that other
people receive. Basically, any redistributive tax is suspect.33

Crowe's third requirement, that there is a just distribution of the
tax burden, is also fraught with ethical problems. The central problem
with Crowe's view is that be subscribes to the ability to pay principle.
"Moralists are unanimous in their teaching that the ultimate basis of
apportioning a tax is the ability of the citizen to pay."34

First of all, moralists are not unanimous in their views that the
ability to pay principle is ethically legitimate.35 Secondly, even if they
were unanimous, that would not make it so. At one time, everyone
thought that the world was flat and that the sun revolved around the
earth. That did not make it so. Morality and truth are not determined by
majority opinion.

The third problem with the ability to pay principle is that it
begins from an incorrect premise. There are basically just two
relationships that can exist between the State and the individual. Either
the State is the master and the individual is the servant or the individual
is the master and the State is the servant. The United States government
was founded on the principle that the State was created to protect life,
liberty and property, and that when the State no longer adequately
performed these functions, individuals had the right to abolish it and

supposed to be the servant and the people were to be the masters.

The other view is that the State is the master and the people are
supposed to serve. Perhaps Marx summarized this viewpoint best when
he said: "From each according to his abilities: to each according to his
needs."37 Former President John F. Kennedy espoused this view in a
different way when he said: "Ask not what your country can do for you;
ask what you can do for your country." Under this approach, whether
one takes the Marxist or Kennedy variant, individuals are treated as
means rather than ends in themselves which, for Kant, Rand and many
other moral philosophers, is illegitimate.

Crowe examined the views of a number of religious and secular
writers on the topic of the just tax. One of them, Angelus of Clavisio,38
said:

Berardi, a later thinker on the subject, takes the position that
there is probably no moral duty to pay a tax even if lying and deceit are
involved.

Crowe cites numerous other Christian scholars who debate the
ethics of evading various types of taxes. For example, there have been
debates on the relative merits of paying or evading direct taxes such as
per capita taxes, inheritance, land, building or income taxes, as
compared to indirect taxes, such as customs, duties, imposts and sales
taxes.41 Others have argued that the morality of paying a tax has nothing

40 BERARDI, PRAXIS CONFESSARIORUM II (1898), quoted in Crowe, supra, at 35.
41 Crowe, supra at 17 and elsewhere in the text. Those who take the position that there
is a moral duty to pay only direct taxes are in a curious position. For example, in 1881,
the U.S. Supreme Court held that the income tax was an indirect tax. Springer v. U.S., 102
U.S. 586 (1881). But in 1895, it reversed its position and held that the income tax is a
direct tax. Pollock v. Farmers Loan & Trust Co., 157 U.S. 429; 158 U.S. 601 (1895).
Does that mean that anyone who evaded the U.S. income tax before 1895 was not
committing a sin but those who evaded it thereafter were sinners? But in France, certain
income taxes are legally classified as indirect taxes, which means that evaders do not
commit a sin, which leaves one in the curious position of being a sinner if one evades the
U.S. income tax but not the French tax. Crowe, supra, points this out at 139.

to do with whether the tax is direct or indirect. Some scholars have
taken the position that it is a sin to break any law.42

A few Christian scholars have more recently addressed the
ethics of tax evasion. Robert T. Pennock wrote an article on
conscientious war tax resistance.43 While this topic is not limited to
Christians, much of what he has to say could be taken as a Christian
approach and some of his citations are to Christian (Quaker) sources.44

Pennock's basic premise is that it is not unethical to refuse to
pay taxes if the proceeds go to finance war. Pennock personally refused
to pay the telephone excise tax during the 1980s because this tax was
earmarked to pay for Reagan's military buildup.45 He mentions several
other forms of tax resistance that would please an accountant. For
example, some war tax resisters refuse to pay the portion of their
current income tax that goes for current military spending. Some
resisters refuse to pay not only for current military spending but also
compute what they would pay for past military spending that was
financed by increasing the national debt -- interest and veteran's
benefits.46 A book has even been published that helps war tax resisters

42 The logic of this position is as follows. "It is sinful to act unreasonably. But it is
unreasonable to break a law. Therefore, it is sinful to break a law." Crowe, supra, at 97.
But this line of reasoning begs the question: What if the law is unreasonable or unjust?
Few, if any, modern theologians would take this position. But this position was common
when it was thought that the king derived his authority from God. The divine right of
kings is supported by Romans 13, 1-2, which says: "Let every soul be subject unto the
higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained by
God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation."

compute the percentage of their total tax bill that goes for military
spending.47 Some resisters refuse to pay any federal income tax
because they are not able to earmark the money they would otherwise
send for nonmilitary purposes.

Pennock takes an approach that is different from that of other
tax evasion authors in at least two distinct respects. For one, war tax
resisters who refuse to pay taxes are not necessarily tax evaders. They
may more properly be classified as tax protesters if their nonpayment is
open. They are evaders only if they hide the fact that they are not paying
taxes. The second difference between Pennock and most other scholars
on this topic is that Pennock takes the position that not paying taxes is
ethical. Indeed, he might say that there is an ethical duty not to pay, at
least in cases where one can avoid payment.48

Schansberg49 takes the position that one should usually pay
taxes, subject to some exceptions. He points to the Biblical passage
where Christ said "give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God, what is
God's,"50 and concludes that tax evasion has, at most, "a limited role
within any ethic developed from Biblical Christianity."51

He also cites Romans 13:1-7, where Paul instructs the people
to "submit to the governing authorities."52 The reasoning he gives is that
those in authority are established by God and anyone who rebels

against authority rebels against God. Again, citing Paul: "This is also why
you pay taxes … Give everyone what you owe him; If you owe taxes,
pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor,
then honor."53

Schansberg raises the interesting question of whether
submission must be absolute or whether some balance must be
struck.54 He interprets Romans to mean that they should give honor and
respect where it is due. When obedience to the State results in
disobedience to God, men should be disobedient to the State.55

Schansberg raises another interesting point about tax evasion
and the spirit versus the letter of the law. What about barter? If you pay
for something by giving something else, either products or services,
rather than money, are you liable for taxes? The U.S. Internal Revenue
Code states that income includes anything received of value. It does not
specify that money need be received. There are many rules and court
cases regarding the taxability of barter transactions. Does it make any
difference whether the barter transaction is entered into to evade taxes
or merely to facilitate the transaction? For Schansberg the answer is
yes, it does make a difference. He points to I Corinthians 4:5, which
states that God will judge "the motives of men's hearts."56

Another interesting point Schansberg raises is the obligation to
pay taxes even if some of the proceeds are wasted. For example, what
if it is legitimate to pay government $1X for national defense but the
government has to collect $1.5X to pay for the waste that is inherent in
the Defense Department budget? Schansberg concludes that tax
evasion is not acceptable in such a situation because, for one thing, it is
not possible to accurately measure the amount of waste. He states that

53 Schansberg, supra, at 148. He also cites Titus 3:1, where Paul tells believers "to be
subject to rulers and authorities." He also cites I Peter 2:13-17, where Peter tells listeners
to submit themselves to every authority "for God's sake."
55 Schansberg, supra, at 149-150.
Volume 2, No. 1 (Winter, 1999)

it is better to turn the other cheek and be taxed twice rather than not be
taxed at all.57

However, there are cases where tax evasion at some level is
legitimate. "If much of what government does is sinful or promotes sin, a
case could be made for a subsequent level of tax evasion."58 Examples
might include prosecuting an inappropriate war, subsidizing abortions,
making SSI payments to substance abusers, promoting indigence and
illegitimacy through redistribution of income to the poor and the many
programs that redistribute income to the non-poor.59 Another possible
reason for ethically evading taxes is if the government takes so much in
taxes that there is not enough left to "give tithes and offerings to the
Lord."60

One of the problems that must be faced once the possibility of
ethical tax evasion is recognized is one of measurement. How many of
my tax dollars must be taken to subsidize sinful behavior before I am
ethically justified in evading taxes? At what point does government take
so much in taxes that it interferes with my duty to tithe? If I am ethically
justified in evading some taxes, how much am I ethically justified in
evading? Schansberg concludes that the answer is a matter of individual
conscience.61

Another instance where tax evasion may be ethically justifiable
is where tax evasion is a matter of survival. In some countries, the tax
burden is so heavy in comparison to the income level that it may at times
be literally required to evade taxes in order to keep enough money to
pay for basic needs. In such cases, there is nothing unethical about tax
evasion.62

> is a necessary aspect of life. The bottom line from the

Gregory Gronbacher takes a slightly different approach to the
Christian view of tax evasion.64 After reviewing the Catholic literature
he concludes that the traditional Catholic teaching on taxation is
compatible with the classical liberal view that taxation should be kept to
a minimum and that the State should engage in activities that benefit only
the common good. He contrasts this traditional Catholic view with the
views of contemporary bishops, who take a more statist view in
advocating all kinds of State intervention and support for special interest
group projects, to the detriment of the general public.65

Classical liberalism does not so much oppose collection of taxes
but only the use to which the funds are put. It balks at the use of the tax
system for redistribution and social engineering.66 Citing Adam Smith,
he says:

> Taxes should only be used to fund the legitimate
> purposes of government: courts, police, and defense.

To use it for other purposes would inhibit capital

In the papal encyclical Rerum Novarum, issued by Leo XIII,
the right to property was recognized as important. This encyclical also
expressed the classical liberal idea that taxes could not be levied other
than for purposes of the common good. "The common good was
defined as that set of social conditions which permitted the individual,
and groups of individuals, to freely attain self-actualization and reach
their final end in Christ."68 I this encyclical, Leo XIII renounced both
socialism and redistribution and egalitarian taxation.

Another papal encyclical, Quadragesimo Anno, issued by Pius
XI, broadened the definition of property. 69 It stated that the State's
authority to confiscate property was limited.

The American bishops issued a letter castigating legislators for
passing tax legislation that resulted in arbitrary wealth redistribution and
stressed that taxes should be levied only to support the natural functions
of government.70 They also pointed out that forced charity was no
charity at all. They went on to say that taxation could never be justified
for special interests. "The placing of the interest of one group of people
over another, in terms of taxation, was unjust."71

Gronbacher does not address the question of whether tax
evasion is justified when the government is evil or corrupt. He merely
quotes a scholar who addressed the question of what should be done
when the burden of taxation is too heavy.

The Mormon Perspective

First of all I would like to point out that Mormons73 are
Christians, too. The reason I separated Mormons from other Christians
is because the Mormon literature is significantly different from other
Christian literature. In addition to the Old and New Testaments,
Mormons have religious literature that is strictly theirs.

The one article I could find that expresses the Mormon view on
the ethics of tax evasion74 concludes that tax evasion is always
unethical, presumably even in cases where the State is evil or corrupt.
One of the basic statements on the relationship of the individual to the
State is as follows:

> We believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold
> the respective governments in which they reside, while
> protected in their inherent and inalienable rights by the
> laws of such governments; and that sedition and
> rebellion are unbecoming every citizen thus protected,

This view was reiterated in a letter from Joseph Smith to the
editor of the Chicago Democrat: "We believe in being subject to kings,
presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining
the law."76 Another Church document states:

> Church members in any nation are to obey applicable
> tax laws. "If a member disapproves of tax laws, he may
> attempt to have them changed by legislation or
> constitutional amendment, or, if he has a well-founded
> legal objection, he may attempt to challenge them in the
> courts. A member who refuses to file a tax return, to
> pay required income taxes, or to comply with a final
> judgment in a tax case is in direct conflict with the law
> and with the teachings of the Church."77

Smith and Kimball cite a number of other Church documents
and statements by Church leaders, all of which say basically the same
thing -- tax evasion is not in keeping with Church law. Church doctrine
views tax evasion as a form of dishonesty, even fraud. None of the
documents Smith and Kimball cite make exceptions for unfair tax laws,

tax rates that are deemed to be too high, or taxes that are paid to an evil
or corrupt State.

The Mormon Church has addressed the issue of tax evasion on
more occasions than most other churches. The views of the Church are
also consistent. Tax evasion is wrong -- period. Nowhere in the
literature the authors cite is there any possibility for concluding that there
might be an exception.

Several criticisms may be made of the Mormon position. For
one, Mormon doctrine would apparently require Church members to
comply with even the worst laws of an extremely corrupt or evil State,
which does not make sense. Political theory for the last few hundred
years recognizes cases where obedience to the State is not absolute. If
one begins with the basic premise that the State exists to serve the
individual and that evil laws may (or must) be disregarded, then the
Mormon position is untenable.

Any issue relating to tax fairness could also be raised to criticize
the Mormon position. Assuming there is such a thing as paying one's
"fair share," it might be argued that if one is forced to pay well beyond
one's fair share there is no longer any moral duty to pay. Excessive
redistribution and taxes that aim at social engineering rather than raising
revenue for legitimate governmental purposes might also be cited as
legitimate reasons for evasion. Using tax proceeds to kill Jews,
Palestinians or Mormons might also be used to justify evasion. The
Mormon view does not take any of these cases into consideration.
Assuming that God exists and that God gave us reason, it follows that
tax evasion might not be unethical under certain circumstances. The
Mormon position disregards reason entirely.

Volume 2, No. 1 (Winter, 1999)

The Muslim Perspective

Paying zakat is one of the five requirements for being a
Muslim.78 Zakat is a voluntary form of payment, along the lines of
charity. It differs from taxation in that the motive to pay is internally
generated rather than imposed by the State.

Islam recognizes strong property rights. However, all property
is owned by Allah. Humans merely are custodians for Allah's
property. 79 They are required to give some of their property to the
community for charitable activities. Zakat is "the pivot and hub of the
Islamic public finance"80 system. In an Islamic State where expenditures
are sufficiently low, zakat could be sufficient to pay for all government
expenses. Problems arise either when zakat is not sufficient to cover all
expenses in an Islamic State or where the State is not Islamic. What is
the duty to pay in these circumstances? Alternatively, is it unethical not
to pay all that the State demands?

At certain times in Islamic history, zakat ceased to be voluntary
and became required by the State.81 Murtuza and Ghazanfar go into
some details of the history of Islamic public finance, which includes
some other forms of revenue raising in addition to Zakat. Unfortunately,
they do not spend much time discussing the ethics of tax evasion in
Islam. If one may infer anything from their discussion of Islamic public
finance, it would be that failure to pay legitimate zakat could be viewed
as an offense against Allah.

the Nature of Zakat, 1 JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING, ETHICS & PUBLIC POLICY

80 M.A. MANNAN, ISLAMIC ECONOMICS: THEORY AND PRACTICE 284 (1970), as
cited in Murtuza and Ghazanfar, supra, at 195.
What is legitimate is another question. Assessment of zakat can
be only on surplus wealth, not on wealth that the owner needs.82 Thus,
zakat that is assessed on property that the owner needs might be
viewed as illegitimate zakat.

Some forms of taxation are considered illegitimate. Presumably,
there is no ethical duty to pay illegitimate taxes. To be legitimate, the tax
must be direct.83 Zakat is a proportional tax on property, not on
income. Progressive taxes are illegitimate because of the implication that
the income is illegitimate.84 Any taxes on income are illegitimate because
they dilute the incentive to produce and be productive. Inheritance taxes
are also illegitimate, as are customs duties, since trade should be free.85
Any laws that protect domestic industry from competition, such as high
tariffs, are also illegitimate.86 Any tax that causes prices to rise artificially
is also illegitimate.87 Such taxes would include sales and excise taxes as
well as value added taxes.

While Muslims have a duty to pay some taxes, it does not
follow that they have a duty to pay any and all taxes that the State
assesses.88 Their duty to pay is limited to the amount needed to provide
83 Murtuza and Ghazanfar, supra, at 209. A simplified definition of a direct tax is a tax
that individuals or corporations pay directly. See JOSEPH E. STIGLITZ, ECONOMICS OF
THE PUBLIC SECTOR 387 (2nd ed. 1998). Indirect taxes are taxes on commodities.
However, the burden of a corporate tax is ultimately borne by individuals, either
shareholders, customers or the corporation's employees. So a case can be made that a
corporate income tax is actually an indirect tax.

for the general welfare of society.89 Thus, there is no ethical duty to
pay for taxes that support special interests.90

The scant Muslim literature on tax evasion that I have been able
to find does not directly address the issue of whether it is unethical to
evade taxes that would be paid to an evil or corrupt State. Very little is
said about the ethics of tax evasion. The discussion usually takes the
form of which kinds of taxes are legitimate, which might lead one to
logically conclude that there is nothing unethical about evading an unjust
tax.

The Baha'i Perspective

The Baha'i religion incorporates viewpoints from numerous
other religions. Thus, one would think that the Baha'i religion would
have the most diverse views on the ethics of tax evasion. But such is
not the case. At least, that is what one may conclude from reading the
one article I could find that has been written about the ethics of tax
evasion from the Baha'i perspective.91

The Baha'i position is remarkably similar to the Mormon
position, although the literature cited is different. Basically, tax evasion is
never justified, presumably even in cases where tax proceeds are used
to kill members of the Baha'i faith. DeMoville's article focuses on the
ethics of tax evasion as a form of civil disobedience and on the

89 Mushtaq Ahmad, Business Ethics in Islam 134 (1995), cited in Robert W. McGee,
The Ethics of Tax Evasion in Islam, supra, at 215.
90 This raises an interesting point, since many taxes go to support special interests at the
expense of the general public. If one defines a special interest as some subset of the
general population that is less than 50 percent of the total, then Social Security taxes
would qualify as a special interest tax. Those who work pay the tax while those who are
retired reap the benefits. Thus, a case can be made that there is no ethical duty to pay
Social Security taxes.

obey the laws of the State in which they live.

Perhaps the most interesting and revealing quote DeMoville
makes is a letter written by a Baha'i religious leader to the Baha'i
community in Germany in 1934, shortly after Hitler's rise to power.

And this seems to be doubtful at present.94

Although the religious literature cited by DeMoville is different
than that cited in the Mormon article, the content is remarkably similar.
Individuals must submit to the laws of the State in which they live. Thus,
the criticisms I made of the Mormon view could be made of the Baha'i
view as well. There is no need to repeat my criticisms here.

Concluding Comments

Since the various religious views do not agree on when tax
evasion is unethical, it is tempting for the lazy individual to pick the view
that is most convenient rather than the view that makes the most sense.
Practically any view under the sun is supported by some religious
scholar, just as practically every economic view under the sun is
supported by some Nobel prizewinning economist. It is comforting to
know that some eminent scholar supports your view on some particular
issue. But that is not enough, or at least it should not be enough, to
make a personal decision on an issue. Positions should be determined
based on the quality of the argument, not by the person who made the
argument.95

The views expressed by the Jewish, Mormon and Baha'i
scholars give new and modern meaning to the Marxist idea that religion
is the opiate of the people. Those who are oppressed by government
are told that they must not rise up and challenge their oppressors lest
they pay a heavy price in the next world.

The rationalist approach to the question of tax evasion leads in
an entirely different direction. The rationalist approach recognizes that
not all taxes are automatically just. Some taxes are unjust. Where a tax
is unjust, perhaps there is no ethical duty to pay. Rationalists would

95 I find it necessary to make this point because of the disturbing trend that is taking
place in the United States and elsewhere. Classical Marxists judged the value of an
argument by the individual who made it. Any arguments made by a member of the
bourgeoisie were dismissed immediately while the views of members of the proletariat
were immediately taken to heart and recognized as the truth. Modern Marxists readily
accept the views (any views, no matter how ridiculous) made by gays, lesbians and
various assorted oppressed minorities and immediately dismiss the views of white
heterosexual males, living or dead. This anti-intellectualism is rampant in American
universities. For critiques of political correctness in American universities, see SPEAKING
FREELY: THE CASE AGAINST SPEECH CODES (Henry Mark Holzer, ed. 1994); ALAN
CHARLES KORS AND HARVEY A. SILVERGATE, THE SHADOW UNIVERSITY: THE
BETRAYAL OF LIBERTY ON AMERICA'S CAMPUSES (1998); Robert W. McGee,

(1990).

recognize that what is illegal is not automatically unethical. Rationalists
may differ regarding the definition of an unjust tax but their premise is
the same, that people are ethically obligated to pay only just taxes. A
closer examination of what constitutes a just tax reveals that few, if any,
taxes fall into this category.96 However, we will leave discussion of that
question for another day.
