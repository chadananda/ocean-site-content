Thus in his approach to the study or the Baha'i Faith,! feel MacEoin is out                  Shoghi Ef:endi's interpretation of Baha'u'llah'a Revelation.In other worda,it

Scientific Theories

Baha'i Scriptures (much expurgated and bowdlerised in.translation) teach.In this                     The Baha'i Faith believes that there is an Absolute Truth which is beyond the              pow~rs
