The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh
Notes on recent secondary literature, and material from the Bahá’í World
Centre.

Steve Cooney
Wellington, Independent Scholar


What follows is a very useful Memorandum from the Research Department
of the Universal House of Justice. It includes an earlier memorandum
“World Government and the Universal House” which was an important
source for Wendi Momen‟s paper trying to answer the question “How close
are we to the Lesser Peace?”1 and was the principal reason for initiating the
request to the Research Department. It‟s almost a dozen years since that first
European Bahá‟í Conference on Law and International Order and another
five since this Research Department memo which is formally published
here.2 It seems then an opportune place to introduce this memorandum,
which itself so helpfully points to published material on the theme of world
order evolution, by making a few notes on other Bahá‟í material about
World Order available since the turn of the twentieth century.

World Order represents a very broad terrain. In the process of writing an
elaborate defence of their religion, Schaefer, Gollmer and Towfiqh 3 spent
considerable time discussing the nature of the Bahá‟í World Order. Gollmer
is a political scientist whose work has recently been reviewed4
Unfortunately his thesis on Bahá‟í political thought remains unpublished5.
Schaefer, a jurist, is an important intellectual in the present Bahá‟í
community of scholars, who has had an interest since his university days
concerning the features of the Bahá‟í World Order system. Recently his
landmark thesis was reprinted making it much more widely available6.
Subsequently he has looked at some of the theological and ethical

              The memorandum includes a letter dated 27 April 1995 which has already been widely discussed and
circulated on the Internet. See also fn.44.

underpinnings7 of this world order as well as interesting discussions of its
legal and constitutional basis8.

Making the Crooked Straight inspired a whole issue of World Order
magazine9 devoted to reviewing its implications especially notable the
article by Roshan Danesh10 which joins another well thought out paper on
the constitutional dimensions of a putative Bahá‟í world order11 essential
reading for any serious reader of Bahá‟í thought on the topic of world order
and how to approach its gradual unfoldment rather than to prematurely
crystallise it. World Order magazine has also produced interesting issues on
post nationalism12 and the international criminal court13 and germane
discussions on global electoral process14

A number of the leading publishers of Bahá‟í material have contributed new
collections of material in the area of world order studies. These include a
collection of articles from the Bahá‟í Politics and International Law Special
Interest Group of the Association of Bahá‟í Studies, English-Speaking
Europe15, and practitioners and academics in the fields of law, governance,
conflict resolution economics linguistics and international relations have
assembled a provocative collection of Bahá‟í perspectives on peace and
conflict resolution16. The North American Association for Bahá‟í Studies

has used its periodical to publish papers of continuing interest and relevance
to a growing understanding of Bahá‟í notions of world order17

Elsewhere in North America, Bahá‟í publishers have also contributed to this
body of work. Kalimat press assembled a diverse group of reflections and
scholarly papers on global issues18 while Brian Lepard, a specialist in
human rights published his vision for a global ethic19 which tries to establish
the core values which would underpin a globally federated world order
congruent with Bahá‟í principles and mankind‟s faith traditions, written in a
style appealing to the general public.SimilarlyJohn Hatcher, in the has
updated his model of the ascending society in the bookstore friendly Baha‟i
Publishing series which effectively recaps the main features of the Bahai
world order models20. Hong Kong based Juxta electronically published an
excellent collection of papers on human rights, a key component of a just
world order21 which has proved popular enough to recently issue in a print
version.

Outside of the Bahá‟í publishing system, a number of authors have been
able to publish perspectives on social evolution22, terrorism and secession23,
international law24, education25, interreligious dialogue26, world theology27

social identity28 and sociology of linguistics29. Globalization is a phenomena
which has not only been of interest to Bahá‟ís30, but was the theme of a
conference on Globalization and the Bahá‟í Faith held at the University of
Copenhagen and which has produced a diverse collection of views and
perspectives: „the first comprehensive treatment of the Bahá‟í religion
viewed in the light of globalization‟31.

Another source of valuable essays is those published in the annual survey of
activities and reporting‟s in the series The Bahai World. These include the
evolution of consciousness32, world order and global governance33, human
obligations and responsibilities in constructing a world civilization,34 law
and religion35 and most recently an essay questioning Western liberal
democracy as an inevitable pattern for the future36. This issue of the Online
Journal of Bahá‟í studies has an important study by Nalinie Mooten of I-R
theory, cosmopolitanism and the Bahá‟í Faith37.

There has been several book length, highly original contributions that have
deepened and broadened the corpus of Bahá‟í material in this field. In
particular Michael Karlberg‟s study of the opposing cultures of contest and
mutualism38, Mark Perry‟s review of the history of racist culture and the
requirements of moving to a future of racial oneness 39, and Huschmand

Sabet‟s analysis of the forces forming world identity40 are warmly
recommended. Equally useful are Guy Sinclair‟s detailed study of the
constitution of the Universal House of Justice41 and Ali Nakhjavani‟s
focussed collection of notes42 on the World Order of Baha‟u‟llah both
projects relying heavily on the scope and range of the World Order of
Baha‟u‟llah as explicated by Shoghi Effendi. We can also add Foad Katirai‟s
excellent monograph on the Bahá‟í proposals for global governance
including a convocation of world leaders43. In press is Sovaida Ma'ani
Ewing‟s „Collective Security Within Reach‟ which promises detailed
proposals for Security Council reform44

The Head of the Bahá‟í Community, the Universal House of Justice has also
remained active in promoting peace and world order with two influential
documents; an open letter to the “world‟s religious leaders‟45 asking them to
take steps to put out the fires of religious fanaticism and hatred, identifying
that as a real threat to the world‟s present order and a document aimed
primarily internally at their own community, and designed to remind them
that in the Bahá‟í view the emergence of a global socio-political order had
to be grounded in a fundamental moral and attitudinal re-orientation to
mankind‟s religions which re-visioned them as one common faith46.

Externally, national Bahá‟í communities represent themselves to the body of
mankind, through their external affairs agency, the Bahá‟í International
Community. This agency has a long tradition promoting world order in
international fora most especially at the agencies of the UN system. In this
period the BIC issued several documents essential to understanding the
Bahá‟í vision of a global world order. These include freedom of religion47,
UN institutional reform48 and overcoming corruption in human institutions49

Until recently the Bahá‟í view of its world order has been remarkably
unified and self consistent, with the general scheme widely accepted for

more than a century. Recent challenges narrowing the scope and functions
of the Bahá‟í world order and indeed its desirability or theological
feasibility have not been received enthusiastically50, largely because they are
marred by problems of selective assembly of materials, highly idiosyncratic
readings and a general failure to satisfactorily engage the existing consensus
of Bahá‟í scholars. In religious communities preferred world orders are
often juxtaposed against catastrophes and apocalypses. There have been a
few such recent studies in this area as well51

In concluding our brief survey, students of the Bahá‟í world order can enjoy
a reissue of an important compilation, available twenty years ago which
assembles in one volume key texts from the Bahá‟í central figures and
authorities52 on the theme of peace and a new volume from Craig Loehle on
the spiritual power inherent in the Revelation of Baha‟u‟llah and its ability
to recreate human society.53. Recently published also is a study of the
common ground offered by the world‟s scriptures as the foundation for a
new world order54. Electronic publishing and text digitization capabilities
have lead to rejuvenating long out of print titles using print on demand
technology. Examples of this include a compilation which was influential at
the time of the First World War, recently re-issued.55 and which still contains
very useful sources for research on the Bahá‟í approach to World Order, and
the recent reprint of an early but idiosyncratic attempt at re-organising
Bahá‟í thought into a humanistic utopia56 by a former secretary of the
Bahá‟í leader Abdu‟l-Baha.

                                          MEMORANDUM



To:         The Universal House of Justice                              Date: 5 May 2002


From: Research Department


                    Request for Materials about the World Order of Baha'u'llah

       In his email message of 19 December 2001, Mr. .… requests a copy of a Research
Department memorandum dated 10 September 1990, entitled "World Government and the Universal
House of Justice", which was cited in the Proceedings of the First European Bahá‟í Conference on
Law and International Order, De Poort, The Netherlands, 8-11 June 1995. In addition, he seeks
copies of "any subsequent memoranda or papers which bear upon any aspect of the World Order of
Baha'u'llah".

         We attach for Mr. …. copies of the following materials:

       The memorandum dated 1 0 September 1990 prepared by the Research Department entitled
"World Government and the Universal House of Justice", and a compilation entitled "Extracts from
Letters Written by and on Behalf of the Universal House of Justice on Evolution Towards World
Order", which was originally prepared in conjunction with the memorandum. The compilation was
revised in 1995.

     A letter dated 27 April 1995 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual
      believer in response to questions on such subjects as theocracy, church and state, and related
      matters. An extract from a letter dated 14 January 1996 written on behalf of the Universal House
      of Justice to an individual on global governance.

     A 1999 statement prepared at the instruction of the Universal House of Justice entitled
      "Peace Among the Nations".

       In addition, Mr. …. might find it helpful to refer to the following items: a letter dated 19
April 2001 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer in
response to a question about the unity of nations and the Lesser Peace, and a memorandum of the
same date prepared by the Research Department with the heading "Attainment of the Unity of
Nations and the Lesser Peace". As these materials were subsequently shared with all National
Spiritual Assemblies, it is suggested that Mr. …. request copies of these documents from his
National Assembly.
        With respect to Mr. ….'s request for papers that address "any aspect of the World Order of
Baha'u'llah", the Research Department regrets that, given the limitation of resources, it is not possible,
at this time, to undertake a comprehensive search of the literature of the Faith on this broad theme. We
note, however, that there are a number of recent statements by the Bahá‟í International Community
with such titles as Prosperity of Humankind, Turning Point for all Nations, and Who is Writing the
Future? Reflections on the Twentieth Century, which impinge on his area of interest. Likewise, the
volumes of The Bahá’í World contain essays on

:

From:        Research Department



           WORLD GOVERNMENT AND THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE

        The Research Department has studied the questions raised by Mr ............. and Mr ......in their
letter postmarked 10 July 1990 to the Universal House of Justice. Messrs ............... and ..... are law
students who are preparing a research paper relating the concept of sovereignty in international law to
the Bahá‟í World Order. As a background to their questions, they refer to the following statements:


                 The remark attributed to 'Abdu'l-Baha in "The Promulgation of Universal Peace:
                 Talks Delivered by 'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in
                 1912", 2nd. ed. (Wilmette: Bahá‟í Publishing Trust, 1982), p. 455, in which the Master
                 indicates that the Universal House of Justice "is endowed with a political as well as a
                 religious function, the consummate union and blending of church and state" .



                 Shoghi Effendi's comments about the non-political character of the Faith and his
                 assertion that, no matter how "advanced their institutions," the Bahá‟ís will not
                 "violate, under any circumstances, the provisions of their country's constitution" nor
                 "allow the machinery of their administration to supersede the government of their
                 respective countries." See "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters"
                 (Wilmette: Bahá‟í Publishing Trust, 1982), pp. 65-66.

                 The reference in "The Promise of World Peace" (Haifa: Bahá‟í World Centre, 1985), p.
                 15, to the means by which a World Parliament will be constituted, namely, its members
                 will be elected by the people of each country and confirmed by their respective
                 governments.

       Mr .... and Mr .... note that a future world government will consist of an international
executive, legislature, and a supreme tribunal, and they pose a number of questions that pertain to the
relationship between the institutions of the world government and the future role of the Universal
House of Justice. We provide the following comment.

       Before addressing the specific questions raised by Mr .... and Mr .... , it is useful to consider, in
broad terms, the nature of the evolution of systems of world government, the unfoldment of the
Bahá‟í Administrative Order into the World Order of Baha'u'llah, and the ultimate convergence of
these two evolutionary trends into the Bahá‟í World Commonwealth in the Golden Age of the Faith.

 Stages in the development of world government

       The letters of Shoghi Effendi outline two stages in the development of world government.
The first stage in this evolution is the emergence of "a world superstate" which will be associated with
the establishment of the Lesser Peace. See "The Goal of a New World Order" in "The World Order of
Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters". The "World Parliament" referred to in "The Promise of World Peace" is
an institution associated with this "superstate". In relation to the Lesser Peace, it is interesting to note
that Shoghi Effendi, in a letter dated 14 March 1939 written on his behalf, indicated that it "will come
about through the political efforts of the states and nations of the world, and independently of any
direct Bahá‟í plan or effort".
       A second, more distant, stage in the evolution of a system of world government, i.e. the "world
commonwealth", is described in "The Unfoldment of World Civilization", in the book "The World
Order of Baha'u'llah", The "world legislature" mentioned on p. 203 of this book is a term applied to
the institution which performs the legislative function in the Bahá‟í World Commonwealth. This same
term can also be applied to the "World Parliament" associated with the Lesser Peace that was
mentioned in the paragraph above. The following extract from "The Promised Day Is Come"
(Wilmette: Bahá‟í Publishing Trust, 1980), p. 123, explicitly links not only the two stages in the
evolving world government but also allies them with the "New World Order" of Baha'u'llah.

                To the general character, the implications and features of this world commonwealth,
         destined to emerge, sooner or later, out of the carnage, agony, and havoc of this great world
         convulsion, I have already referred in my previous communications. Suffice it to say that this
         consummation will, by its very nature, be a gradual process, and must, as Baha'u'llah has
         Himself anticipated, lead at first to the establishment of that Lesser Peace which the nations of
         the earth, as yet unconscious of His Revelation and yet unwittingly enforcing the general
         principles which He has enunciated, will themselves establish. This momentous and historic
         step, involving the reconstruction of mankind, as the result of the universal recognition of its
         oneness and wholeness, will bring in its wake the spiritualization of the masses, consequent to
         the recognition of the character, and the acknowledgment of the claims, of the Faith of
         Baha'u'llah - the essential condition to that ultimate fusion of all races, creeds, classes, and
         nations which must signalize the emergence of His New World Order.


 Development of the World Order of Baha'u'llah

         The development of Baha'u'llah's New World Order, as outlined in the writings' of Shoghi
 Effendi, is an evolutionary process. In "The Unfoldment of World Civilization", the World Order
 of Baha'u'llah is described as "evolving within the framework of the Administrative Order of His
 Faith". The Administrative Order precedes the emergence of the New World Order. For example, it
 is referred to as, among other things, "the precursor, the nucleus and pattern" of "that Order" and as
 the "sole framework" of the "Bahá‟í Commonwealth of the future".


       Shoghi Effendi also identifies a number of stages in the evolution of the Faith. For instance,
 in "The Advent of Divine Justice" (Wilmette: Bahá‟í Publishing Trust, 1984), p. 15, he refers to

                      World Government and the Universal House of Justice

         ... the successive stages of unmitigated obscurity, of active repression, and of complete
         emancipation, leading in turn to its being acknowledged as an independent Faith, enjoying the
         status of full equality with its sister religions, to be followed by its establishment and
         recognition as a State religion, which in turn must give way to its assumption of the rights and
         prerogatives associated with the Bahá‟í state, functioning in the plenitude of its powers, a
         stage which must ultimately culminate in the emergence of the worldwide Bahá‟í
         Commonwealth, animated wholly by the spirit, and operating solely in direct conformity with
         the laws and principles of Baha'u'llah.

Further, in "Messages to the Bahá‟í World, 1950-1957" (Wilmette: Bahá‟í Publishing Trust, 1971), p.
155, Shoghi Effendi refers to the anticipated impetus to the development of the Faith provided by the
World Crusade and he designates the point in time when the Faith will begin to assume responsibility
for "religious and civil matters". The Guardian states:

        This present Crusade, on the threshold of which we now stand, will, moreover, by virtue of the
        dynamic forces it will release and its wide repercussions over the entire surface of the globe,
        contribute effectually to the acceleration of yet another process of tremendous significance
        which will carry the steadily evolving Faith of Baha'u'llah through its present stages of
        obscurity, of repression, of emancipation and of recognition - stages one or another of which
        Bahá‟í national communities in various parts of the world now find themselves in - to the stage
        of establishment, the stage at which the Faith of Baha'u'llah will be recognized by the civil
        authorities as the state religion, similar to that which Christianity entered in the years following
        the death of the Emperor Constantine, a stage which must later be followed by the emergence
        of the Bahá‟í state itself, functioning, in all religious and civil matters, in strict accordance with
        the laws and ordinances of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Most Holy, the Mother-Book of the Bahá‟í
        Revelation, a stage which, in the fullness of time, will culminate in the establishment of the
        World Bahá‟í Commonwealth, functioning in the plenitude of its powers, and which will
        signalize the long-awaited advent of the Christ-promised Kingdom of God on earth - the
        Kingdom of Baha'u'llah - mirroring however faintly upon this humble handful of dust the
        glories of the Abha Kingdom.

Finally, in relation to the future of the Faith, Shoghi Effendi indicates that it is

         ... destined to attain, in the fullness of time, the status of a world-embracing
         Commonwealth, which would be at once the instrument and the guardian of the Most
         Great Peace announced by its Author.
                ("The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters", p. 196)

And, the Universal House of Justice in a letter dated 23 December 1985 written on its behalf to an
individual believer states that

         ... the interests of the entire world ... and those of the Faith are destined to merge in the
         Most Great Peace.

Compilation

       The Research Department has been able to find few references that pertain specifically to the
questions raised by Mr .... and Mr ..... To assist them in their study we attach a compilation of extracts
from letters written by and on behalf of the Universal House of Justice. These letters amplify aspects
of the evolution toward World Order and comment on the relationship between the Bahá‟í institutions
and the new institutions referred to in the Guardian's letters. A number of important general points
emerge from consideration of these extracts, for example:


         I.    As mentioned earlier, the letters of Shoghi Effendi describe successive stages in the
               evolution of the institutions of the Faith and their relationship to the world at large. At the
               time of the establishment of the Bahá‟í Commonwealth, of which the Universal House of
               Justice is the "supreme organ", the House of Justice indicates that "the religious and
               secular aspects are clearly merged into one set of institutions, i.e., the institutions of the
               World Order of Bahau'Ilah". See extract I.

        2.     The future "governmental functions" of the Houses of Justice have not been clearly
               defined. See extract 2.

        3.     The nature of the relationship between the evolving World Order of Baha'u'llah and the
               institutions of a "slowly awakening world" will require further elucidation by the
               Universal House of Justice. Extracts 3 and 4 contain statements written on behalf of
               Shoghi Effendi concerning the International Executive, the Universal Court of Arbitration
               and the International Tribunal.

        4.    The process of evolution toward the Bahá‟í World Commonwealth is a long and
              gradual one. See extracts 5 and 6.


       5.     While the Writings of the Faith contain many passages with "guidance for the changing
              conditions under which the followers of Baha'u'llah will be labouring during the passing
              centuries, ... it is not possible to see in advance the details of how they will be applied".
              See extract 7.


 Question 1:          Relationship between the international legislature and the Universal
                      House of Justice

        In a letter dated 27 May 1966, published in "Wellspring of Guidance: Messages 19631968"
 (Wilmette: Bahá‟í Publishing Trust, 1976), p. 90, the House of Justice is described as both the
 "highest legislative body of the Faith" and as the "supreme organ" of the Bahá‟í Commonwealth.
 The Universal House of Justice has indicated that this system of government coincides with the
 "Bahá‟í system". See extract 4 of attachment. Further the House of Justice confirms that at the time
 of the establishment of the Bahá‟í Commonwealth the "religious and secular aspects are clearly
 merged into one set of institutions, i.e., the institutions of the World Order of Baha'u'llah." See
 extract 1.

 Question 2:          Enforcement of the laws of the Universal House of Justice on the peoples of
                      the world


       With regard to the question about the manner in which the laws of the Universal House of
Justice will be enforced on the peoples of the world, this needs to be understood within the context of
the gradual evolution of the Faith and the emergence of the world commonwealth. From the extract
from "Messages to the Bahá‟í World, 1950-1957", p. 155, already cited, it is clear that the "Bahá‟í
state" will function, "in all religious and civil matters, in strict accordance with the laws and
ordinances in the Kitab-i-Aqdas".

       With respect to how the laws of the Universal House of Justice will be enforced, information
on this subject is fragmentary. It is interesting to note that 'Abdu'l-Baha, in His Will and Testament
(see "Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha" (Wilmette: Bahá‟í Publishing Trust, 1971), pp. 14-15),
refers to the fact that the Universal House of Justice enacts the laws and the government enforces
them. He states:

         This House of Justice enacteth the laws and the government enforceth them. The legislative
         body must reinforce the executive, the executive must aid and assist the legislative body so
         that through the close union and harmony of these two forces, the foundation of fairness and
         justice may become firm and strong, that all the regions of the world may become even as
         Paradise itself.

Further, Shoghi Effendi, in a letter dated 18 April 1941 written on his behalf in response to a
question about the "government" referred to in the above excerpt, provided the following
clarification:


        By "Government" ... is meant the executive body which will enforce the laws when the
        Bahá‟í Faith has reached the point when it is recognized and accepted entirely by any
        particular nation.

 And, the Universal House of Justice in a letter dated 9 March 1977 written on its behalf to an
 individual believer in response to a question about the rights of the minority of non-Bahá‟í citizens
 in a Bahá‟í state indicated:

               As to your question concerning the rights of the minority of non-Bahá‟í citizens in a
        Bahá‟í state, it is clear from the writings of our Faith that under a Bahá‟í system the rights of
        the minorities of any type must always be respected and upheld. Just as Bahá‟ís today show
        obedience and loyalty to the government but refuse to bow to the majority if they are asked to
        deny their Faith, so in the future, when the majority is represented by the Faith the Bahá‟ís will
        not force the minority to become followers of Baha'u'llah but they will expect the minority to
        be similarly obedient and loyal.

                The ultimate safeguard in the Faith of Baha'u'llah to ensure that this principle and all its
         other fundamental tenets are not violated is the Universal House of Justice, which, as its
         Constitution clearly stipulates, is charged with the responsibility of maintaining the integrity of
         the teachings and of safeguarding their inviolability.

 Question 3:            Sacred order and secular order


       Mr .... and Mr .... make reference to the historical Western model of the division between
church and state. They enquire whether or not it is valid, in the Bahá‟í model, to draw a distinction
between a sacred order (the Bahá‟í Commonwealth) and a secular order (the political institutions of
the world). From the foregoing discussions, it is apparent that the sacred and secular begin to merge
with the emergence of the Bahá‟í state and that, by the time of the establishment of the world
commonwealth, the "religious and secular aspects are clearly merged into one set of institutions".


        The historical division between church and state which characterizes the Western model of
 government provides a means for preserving a clear distinction between the religious and political
 powers in society and for curbing any unwarranted interference of the church in the affairs of the state.
 Such provisions were particularly relevant to the relations between church and state during the late
 Middle Ages and the Reformation. It is suggested that, as part of their research, Mr .... and Mr ....
 might give some attention to a consideration of the uniqueness of the Bahá‟í system and the provisions
 it contains for avoiding the problems and difficulties associated with other religious and governmental
 systems. In this regard they may well be familiar with the material contained in "The World Order of
 Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters", pp. 18-22 and pp. 152-54.

Dear Bahá‟í Friend,

       Your email of 19 February 1995 addressed to the Research Department was referred to the
Universal House of Justice. In it you quote two phrases which appear in a book you have recently
read, and which seem from the context to be citations from Shoghi Effendi. These phrases are
"Bahá‟í theocracy" and "humanity will emerge from that immature civilization in which church and
state are separate". You ask whether these references can be authenticated and dated. We have been
instructed to send you the following reply.

     A reference to "Bahá‟í theocracy" is to be found in a letter written on behalf of the
Guardian to an individual Bahá‟í on 30 September 1949. This reads as follows:

                He thinks your question is well put: what the Guardian was referring to was the
        theocratic systems, such as the Catholic Church and the Caliphate, which are not divinely
        given as systems, but man-made, and yet, being partly derived from the teachings of
        Christ and Muhammad are in a sense theocracies. The Bahá‟í theocracy, on the contrary,
        is both divinely ordained as a system and, of course, based on the teachings of the
        Prophet Himself.

       The other passage does not comprise words of Shoghi Effendi, although its purport was
approved by him. As you yourself have since discovered, it can be found in The Bahá’í World,
volume VI, on page 199, in a statement entitled "Concerning Membership in Non-Bahá‟í Religious
Organizations", about which the Guardian's secretary had written on his behalf on
11 December 1935: "The Guardian has carefully read the copy of the statement you had recently
prepared concerning non-membership in non-Bahá‟í religious organizations, and is pleased to
realize that your comments and explanations are in full conformity with his views on the subject."


        The complete paragraph in which the words appear is as follows:

                 In the light of these words, 1 it seems fully evident that the way to approach this
        instruction is in realizing the Faith of Baha'u'llah as an ever-growing organism destined
        to become something new and greater than any of the revealed religions

    Addressed to the Bahá’ís of North America, 1932-1946 (Wilmette: Bahá‟í Publishing Committee,
    1947), pp. 4-5.

        of the past. Whereas former Faiths inspired hearts and illumined souls, they eventuated in
        formal religions with an ecclesiastical organization, creeds, rituals and churches, while
        the Faith of Baha'u'llah, likewise renewing man's spiritual life, will gradually produce the
        institutions of an ordered society, fulfilling not merely the function of the churches of the
        past but also the function of the civil state. By this manifestation of the Divine Will in a
        higher degree than in former ages, humanity will emerge from that immature civilization
        in which church and state are separate and competitive institutions, and partake of a true
        civilization in which spiritual and social principles are at last reconciled as two aspects of
        one and the same Truth.

      You also ask how these statements could be reconciled with Shoghi Effendi's comment on page
149 of Bahá’í Administration, which appears to anticipate "a future that is sure to witness the formal
and complete separation of Church and State", and with the following words in his letter of 21 March
1932 addressed to the Bahá‟ís of the United States and Canada:
        Theirs is not the purpose, while endeavoring to conduct and perfect the
        administrative affairs of their Faith, to violate, under any circumstances, the
        provisions of their country's constitution, much less to allow the machinery of their
        administration to supersede the government of their respective countries.
       A careful reading of the letter dated 6 December 1928 in which the Guardian's comment about
the separation of Church and State occurs would suggest that, rather than enunciating a general
principle, Shoghi Effendi is simply reviewing "the quickening forces of internal reform" that had
"recently transpired throughout the Near and Middle East", and enumerating a number of factors that
impinge on the development of the Faith in those parts of the world.'

       As for the statement made by Shoghi Effendi in his letter of 21 March 1932, the well-
established principles of the Faith concerning the relationship of the Bahá‟í institutions to those of the
country in which the Bahá‟ís reside make it unthinkable that they would ever purpose to violate a
country's constitution or so to meddle in its political machinery as to attempt to take over the powers
of government. This is an integral element of the Bahá‟í principle of abstention from involvement in
politics. However, this does not by any means imply that the country itself may not, by constitutional
means, decide to adopt Bahá‟í laws and practices and modify its constitution or method of
government accordingly. The relationship between the principle of abstention from involvement in
politics and the emergence of the Bahá‟í State is commented on later in this letter. In the meantime we
can quote the following extracts from letters written on behalf of the Guardian in response to queries
from individual believers, which indicate that the relationship is an evolving one:

               Regarding the question raised in your letter, Shoghi Effendi believes that for the
        present the Movement, whether in the East or the West, should be dissociated entirely
        from politics. This was the explicit injunction of 'Abdu'l-Baha .... Eventually, however,
        as you have rightly conceived it, the Movement will, as soon

       as it is fully developed and recognized, embrace both religious and political issues. In
       fact Baha'u'llah clearly states that affairs of state as well as religious questions are to be
       referred to the Houses of Justice into which the Assemblies of the Bahá‟ís will
       eventually evolve.
                       (30 November 1930)

              The Bahá‟ís will be called upon to assume the reins of government when they
       will come to constitute the majority of the population in a given country, and even then
       their participation in political affairs is bound to be limited in scope unless they obtain
       a similar majority in some other countries as well.
                      (19 November 1939)
                 The Bahá‟ís must remain non-partisan in all political affairs. In the distant
        future, however, when the majority of a country have become Bahá‟ís then it will lead
        to the establishment of a Bahá‟í State.
                       (19 April 1941)
      A proper understanding of all the above passages, and of their implications, requires an
acceptance of two fundamental principles for the exegesis of Bahá‟í Texts.

      The first, which derives from the Covenant, is the principle that the writings of 'Abdul-Baha
and the Guardian are thoroughly imbued with the spirit of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah and intimately
linked with the Teachings of Baha'u'llah Himself. This principle is clearly expounded in two
paragraphs from a letter written on behalf of the Guardian to an individual believer on 19 March
1946:
                Whatever the Master has said is based on the teachings of Baha'u'llah. He was
        the perfect Interpreter, had lived with Him all His life; therefore what He says has the
        same standing, even if a text of Baha'u'llah is not available ....

               We must take the teachings as a great, balanced whole, not seek out and
       oppose to each other two strong statements that have different meanings; somewhere
       in between, there are links uniting the two. That is what makes our Faith so flexible
       and well balanced. For instance there are calamities for testing and for punishment -
       there are also accidents, plain cause and effect!
         Baha'u'llah has given us a Revelation designed to raise mankind to heights never before attained.
It is little wonder that the minds of individual believers, no matter how perceptive, have difficulty in
comprehending its range. It is the words of 'Abdu'l-Baha and the Guardian which elucidate this vast
Revelation and make clear the manner in which different statements relate to one another and what is
implied by the Revealed Word. Without the bright light of the • Covenant, this Faith, like all those
before it, would be torn to pieces by the conflicting opinions of scholars applying limited human
reasoning to divinely revealed truths.
       The second fundamental principle which enables us to understand the pattern towards which
Baha'u'llah wishes human society to evolve is the principle of organic growth which requires that
detailed developments, and the understanding of detailed developments, become available only with
the passage of time and with the help of the guidance given by that Central Authority in the Cause to
whom all must turn. In this regard one can use the simile of a tree. If

a farmer plants a tree, he cannot state at that moment what its exact height will be, the number of its
branches or the exact time of its blossoming. He can, however, give a general impression of its size
and pattern of growth and can state with confidence which fruit it will bear. The same is true of the
evolution of the World Order of Baha'u'llah. For example, we find the following illuminating
explanation in a letter written by Shoghi Effendi to the Bahá‟ís in America on 23 February 1924:4


               And as we make an effort to demonstrate that love to the world may we also clear
      our minds of any lingering trace of unhappy misunderstandings that might obscure our
      clear conception of the exact purpose and methods of this new world order, so
      challenging and complex, yet so consummate and wise. We are called upon by our
      beloved Master in His Will and Testament not only to adopt it unreservedly, but to unveil
      its merit to all the world. To attempt to estimate its full value, and grasp its exact
      significance after so short a time since its inception would be premature and
      presumptuous on our part. We must trust to time, and the guidance of God's Universal
      House of Justice, to obtain a clearer and fuller understanding of its provisions and
      implications. But one word of warning must be uttered in this connection. Let us be on
      our guard lest we measure too strictly the Divine Plan with the standard of men. I am not
      prepared to state that it agrees in principle or in method with the prevailing notions now
      uppermost in men's minds, nor that it should conform with those imperfect, precarious,
      and expedient measures feverishly resorted to by agitated humanity. Are we to doubt that
      the ways of God are not necessarily the ways of man? Is not faith but another word for
      implicit obedience, whole-hearted allegiance, uncompromising adherence to that which
      we believe is the revealed and express will of God, however perplexing it might first
      appear, however at variance with the shadowy views, the impotent doctrines, the crude
      theories, the idle imaginings, the fashionable conceptions of a transient and troublous
      age? If we are to falter or hesitate, if our love for Him should fail to direct us and keep us
      within His path, if we desert Divine and emphatic principles, what hope can we any more
      cherish for healing the ills and sicknesses of this world?

                Pending the establishment of the Universal House of Justice, whose function it
       is to lay more definitely the broad lines that must guide the future activities and
       administration of the Movement, it is clearly our duty to strive to obtain as clear a view
       as possible of the manner in which to conduct the affairs of the Cause, and then arise
       with single-mindedness and determination to adopt and maintain it in all our activities
       and labours.

        At this time we have the benefit of many subsequent interpretations by Shoghi Effendi and also
 the initial guidance of the Universal House of Justice, which will continue to elucidate aspects of this
 mighty system as it unfolds. In striving to attain a "clearer and fuller understanding" of the World
 Order of Baha'u'llah, we need to contemplate the operation of the Bahá‟í principles of governance and
 social responsibility as they persist through changing sets of conditions, from the present time when
 the Bahá‟í community constitutes a small number of people living in a variety of overwhelmingly
 non-Bahá‟í societies, to the far different situation

in future centuries when the Bahá‟ís are becoming, and eventually have become, the vast
majority of the people.

        The Administrative Order is certainly the nucleus and pattern of the World Order of Baha'u'llah,
but it is in embryonic form, and must undergo major evolutionary developments in the course of time.
Certain passages in the writings on this subject establish matters of principle, certain ones describe the
ultimate goal of the Most Great Peace, and certain of them relate to stages of development on the way
to the attainment of that goal. For example, in this familiar passage in His Will and Testament,
'Abdu'l-Baha states:5

        This House of Justice enacteth the laws and the government enforceth them. The
        legislative body must reinforce the executive, the executive must aid and assist the
        legislative body so that through the close union and harmony of these two forces, the
        foundation of fairness and justice may become firm and strong, that all the regions of
        the world may become even as Paradise itself.

       In response to a question about the "government" in the above passage, Shoghi Effendi's
secretary wrote on his behalf, on 18 April 1941, the following clarification:

       By "Government" ... is meant the executive body which will enforce the laws when the
       Bahá‟í Faith has reached the point when it is recognized and accepted entirely by any
       particular nation.

      The same relationship between legislature and executive is expressed in the well-known
passage in "The Unfoldment of World Civilization"6, showing how one principle is applied over
successive periods.

        A world executive, backed by an international Force, will carry out the decisions arrived
        at, and apply the laws enacted by, this world legislature, and will safeguard the organic
        unity of the whole commonwealth.

      In relation to other international institutions, the Guardian has given the following
guidance:

                Touching the point raised in the Secretary's letter regarding the nature and scope
        of the Universal Court of Arbitration, this and other similar matters will have to be
        explained and elucidated by the Universal House of Justice, to which, according to the
        Master's explicit Instructions, all important fundamental questions must be referred.7

Canada written on 27 February 1929,8 Shoghi Effendi stated:

                Not only will the present-day Spiritual Assemblies be styled differently in future,
       but they will be enabled also to add to their present functions those powers, duties, and
       prerogatives necessitated by the recognition of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, not merely as one
       of the recognized religious systems of the world, but as the State Religion of an
       independent and Sovereign Power. And as the Bahá‟í Faith permeates the masses of the
       peoples of East and West, and its truth is embraced by the majority of the peoples of a
       number of the Sovereign States of the world, will the Universal House of Justice attain
       the plenitude of its power, and exercise as the supreme organ of the Bahá‟í
       Commonwealth all the rights, the duties and responsibilities incumbent upon the world's
       future superstate.
       Complementing these words are the Guardian's repeated and forceful requirement that
Bahá‟ís strictly abstain from involvement in politics. This requirement has far-reaching implications
for the method by which Baha‟u'llah's Administrative Order will evolve into His World Order. We
can consider, for example, the well-known passage in his letter of 21 March 1932 to the Bahá‟ís in
the United States and Canada9
                Let them refrain from associating themselves, whether by word or by deed, with
        the political pursuits of their respective nations, with the policies of their governments
        and the schemes and programmes of parties and factions .... Let them affirm their
        unyielding determination to stand, firmly and unreservedly, for the way of Baha'u'llah, to
        avoid the entanglements and bickerings inseparable from the pursuits of the politician,
        and to become worthy agencies of that Divine Polity which incarnates God's immutable
        Purpose for all men ....

               ... Let them beware lest, in their eagerness to further the aims of their beloved
      Cause, they should be led unwittingly to bargain with their Faith, to compromise with
      their essential principles, or to sacrifice, in return for any material advantage which their
      institutions may derive, the integrity of their spiritual ideals.
      As one studies these words, one begins to understand the processes at work in the gradual
unfoldment and establishment of the Bahá‟í System.
       Clearly the establishment of the Kingdom of God on earth is a "political" enterprise, and the
Teachings of the Faith are filled with "political" principles - using the word in the sense of the science
of government and of the organization of human society. At the same time the Bahá‟í world
community repeatedly and emphatically denies being a "political" organization, and Bahá‟ís are
required, on pain of deprivation of their administrative rights, to refrain from becoming involved in
"political" matters and from taking sides in "political" disputes. In other words, the Bahá‟ís are
following a completely different path from that usually followed by those who wish to reform
society. They eschew political methods towards the achievement of their aims, and concentrate on
revitalizing the hearts, minds and behaviour of people and on presenting a working model as evidence
of the reality and practicality of the way of life they propound.

       The Bahá‟í Administrative Order is the "nucleus and pattern" of the divinely intended future
political system of the world, and undoubtedly non-Bahá‟í governments will benefit from

learning how this system works and from adopting its procedures and principles in overcoming the
problems they face. Nevertheless, this Administration is primarily the framework and structure
designed to be a channel for the flow of the spirit of the Cause and for the application of its
Teachings. As the Guardian wrote: 10

                It is surely for those to whose hands so priceless a heritage has been committed
        to prayerfully watch lest the tool should supersede the Faith itself, lest undue concern for
        the minute details arising from the administration of the Cause obscure the vision of its
        promoters, lest partiality, ambition, and worldliness tend in the course of time to becloud
        the radiance, stain the purity, and impair the effectiveness of the Faith of Baha'u'llah,


      The gradual process of the evolution of the Bahá‟í Administrative Order into the World Order
of Baha'u'llah has been described by Shoghi Effendi in many of his writings, as in the following
excerpt from his letter of 30 April 1953 to the All-America Intercontinental Teaching Conference: 11


                This present Crusade, on the threshold of which we now stand, will, moreover,
       by virtue of the dynamic forces it will release and its wide repercussions over the entire
       surface of the globe, contribute effectually to the acceleration of yet another process of
       tremendous significance which will carry the steadily evolving Faith of Baha'u'llah
       through its present stages of obscurity, of repression, of emancipation and of recognition
       - stages one or another of which Bahá‟í national communities in various parts of the
       world now find themselves - to the stage of establishment, the stage at which the Faith of
       Baha'u'llah will be recognized by the civil authorities as the State Religion, similar to that
       which Christianity entered in the years following the death of the Emperor Constantine, a
       stage which must later be followed by the emergence of the Bahá‟í state itself,
       functioning, in all religious and civil matters, in strict accordance with the Laws and
       Ordinances of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Most Holy, the Mother-Book of the Bahá‟í
       Revelation, a stage which, in the fullness of time, will culminate in the establishment of
       the World Bahá‟í Commonwealth, functioning in the plenitude of its powers, and which
       will signalize the long-awaited advent of the Christ-promised Kingdom of God on earth -
       the Kingdom of Baha'u'llah - mirroring however faintly upon this humble handful of dust
       the glories of the Abha Kingdom.

       In answer to those who raise objections to this vision of a worldwide commonwealth inspired
by a Divine Revelation, fearing for the freedom of minority groups or of the individual under such a
system, we can explain the Bahá‟í principle of upholding the rights of minorities and fostering their
interests. We can also point to the fact that no person is ever compelled to accept the Faith of
Baha'u'llah and moreover, unlike the situation in certain other religions, each person has complete
freedom to withdraw from the Faith if he decides that he no longer believes in its Founder or accepts
His Teachings. In light of these facts alone it is evident that the growth of the Bahá‟í communities to
the size where a non-Bahá‟í state would adopt the Faith as the State Religion, let alone to the point at
which the State would accept the Law of

 God as its own law and the National House of Justice as its legislature, must be a supremely
 voluntary and democratic process.

         As the Universal House of Justice wrote in its letter of 21 July 1968 to the National
  Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá‟ís of the United States:
                It is not our purpose to impose Bahá‟í teachings upon others by persuading the
        powers that be to enact laws enforcing Bahá‟í principles, nor to join movements which
        have such legislation as their aim. The guidance that Bahá‟í institutions offer to mankind
        does not comprise a series of specific answers to current problems, but rather the
        illumination of an entirely new way of life. Without this way of life the problems are
        insoluble; with it they will either not arise or, if they arise, can be resolved.

        Two quotations from the writings of the Guardian bear particularly on these principles of the
 rights and prerogatives of minorities and of individuals. In The Advent of Divine Justice is a passage
 which is of fundamental significance for Bahá‟í constitutional law 12:

                 Unlike the nations and peoples of the earth, be they of the East or of the West,
        democratic or authoritarian, communist or capitalist, whether belonging to the Old
        World or the New, who either ignore, trample upon, or extirpate, the racial, religious, or
        political minorities within the sphere of their jurisdiction, every organized community
        enlisted under the banner of Baha'u'llah should feel it to be its first and inescapable
        obligation to nurture, encourage, and safeguard every minority belonging to any faith,
        race, class, or nation within it.

       As for the protection of the rights of individuals, there is the following translation of a forceful
passage which appears in a letter from Shoghi Effendi to the Bahá‟ís of Iran, written in July 1925, in
relation to a situation involving a Covenant-breaker:

                ... the mere fact of disaffection, estrangement, or recantation of belief, can in no
       wise detract from, or otherwise impinge upon, the legitimate civil rights of individuals in
       a free society, be it to the most insignificant degree. Were the friends to follow other than
       this course, it would be tantamount to a reversion on their part, in this century of radiance
       and light, to the ways and standards of a former age: they would reignite in men's breasts
       the fire of bigotry and blind fanaticism, cut themselves off from the glorious bestowals of
       this promised Day of God, and impede the full flow of divine assistance in this wondrous
       age.
       All Bahá‟ís, and especially those who make a profound study of the Cause, need to grasp the
differences between the Bahá‟í concepts of governance and those of the past, and to abstain • from
measuring Bahá‟í institutions and methods against the faulty man-made institutions and methods
hitherto current in the world. The Guardian graphically stressed these differences in his letter of 8
February 1934, known as "The Dispensation of Baha'u'llah": 13

               The Bahá‟í Commonwealth of the future, of which this vast Administrative Order
      is the sole framework, is, both in theory and practice, not only unique in the entire history
      of political institutions, but can find no parallel in the annals of any of the world's
      recognized religious systems. No form of democratic government; no system of autocracy
      or of dictatorship, whether monarchical or republican; no intermediary scheme of a purely
      aristocratic order; nor even any of the recognized types of theocracy, whether it be the
      Hebrew Commonwealth, or the various Christian ecclesiastical organizations, or the
      Imamate or the Caliphate in Islam none of these can be identified or be said to conform
      with the Administrative Order which the master-hand of its perfect Architect has
      fashioned.

       Among the many complementary Teachings in the Faith which resolve the dilemmas of past
societies are those of the unity of mankind on the one hand, and loyalty to the Covenant on the other.
As already mentioned, no one in this Dispensation is compelled to be a Bahá‟í, and the division of
humankind into the "clean" and the "unclean", the "faithful" and the "infidels", is abolished. At the
same time, anyone who does choose to be a Bahá‟í accepts the Covenant of Baha'u'llah and, while free
expression of opinion within the Bahá‟í community is encouraged, this cannot ever be permitted to
degenerate to the level of undermining the Covenant, for this would vitiate the very purpose of the
Revelation itself.

      One of the major concerns of the Universal House of Justice, as the Bahá‟í Administrative
Order unfolds, will be to ensure that it evolves in consonance with the spirit of the Bahá‟í
Revelation. While many beneficial aspects of human society at large can be safely incorporated into
Bahá‟í Administration, the House of Justice will guard against the corrupting influence of those non-
Bahá‟í political and social concepts and practices which are not in harmony with the divine standard.



       The House of Justice appreciates your concern about such a fundamental issue, and asks us to
 assure you of its prayers in the Holy Shrines for the confirmation of your services to the Cause of
 God.

                                                   With loving Bahá‟í greetings,

                EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS WRITTEN BY AND ON BEHALF OF
               THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE ON EVOLUTION TOWARDS
                                  WORLD ORDER



       You have also asked whether the institutions of the Faith will in the future only concern
themselves with the spiritual affairs of the community or whether they will also be engaged in matters
of state and be identical with the civil government. We have been asked to state that a careful reading
of the words of the beloved Guardian will reveal that what you describe are two future stages in the
development of the Faith. Thus, he wrote: "Not only will the present-day Spiritual Assemblies be
styled differently in future, but they will be enabled also to add to their present functions those
powers, duties, and prerogatives necessitated by the recognition of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, not merely
as one of the recognized religious systems of the world, but as the State Religion of an independent
and Sovereign Power." ("The World Order of Baha'u'llah", pp. 6-7)



        The statement quoted above envisages the development of the institutions of the Faith purely as
agencies conducting the affairs of the community of the followers of Baha'u'llah. In "The Advent of
Divine Justice" (p. 12), however, Shoghi Effendi goes beyond the stage when the Faith becomes the
"State Religion". This stage, he explains, " ... must give way to its assumption of the rights and
prerogatives associated with the Bahá‟í state, functioning in the plenitude of its powers, a stage which
must ultimately culminate in the emergence of the worldwide Bahá‟í Commonwealth, animated
wholly by the spirit, and operating solely in direct conformity with the laws and principles of
Baha'u'llah", This last stage is described in slightly different terms in the following words of Shoghi
Effendi: "And as the Bahá‟í Faith permeates the masses of the peoples of East and West, and its truth
is embraced by the majority of the peoples of a number of the Sovereign States of the world, will the
Universal House of Justice attain the plenitude of its power, and exercise, as the supreme organ of the
Bahá‟í Commonwealth, all the rights, the duties, and responsibilities incumbent upon the world's
future superstate." (Cf. "The World Order of Baha'u'llah", p. 7) It is obvious that in these last stages
the religious and secular aspects are clearly merged into one set of institutions, i.e., the institutions of
the World Order of Baha'u'llah. This concept is further confirmed by Shoghi Effendi when he clearly
states that the "Administrative Order" will in the future "assert its claim and demonstrate its capacity
to be regarded not only as the nucleus but the very pattern of the New World Order destined to
embrace in the fullness of time the whole of mankind". ("The World Order of Baha'u'llah", p. 144) (9
March 1977 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer) [1]




      In answer to your question on future governmental functions of Houses of Justice, ... we have
been directed to quote the following from two letters written on behalf of the Guardian to ' individual
believers:



I This extract appears on p. 15 of the 1984 edition of "The Advent of Divine Justice".

               The Bahá‟ís will be called upon to assume the reins of government when they will
        come to constitute the majority of the population in a given country, and even then their
        participation in political affairs is bound to be limited in scope unless they obtain a similar
        majority in some other countries as well.

               You asked regarding the status of the different governments when the House of
        Justice will be established: this is not fully explained in the teachings, and what is not
        definitely provided for, it is for the House of Justice to legislate upon once that body is
        formed.

       The Universal House of Justice points out that as the World Order of Baha'u'llah unfolds, these
points will become clearer to the believers, and at this time it does not wish to go beyond what Shoghi
Effendi has already expounded in his letters.
              (8 January 1979 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual
               believer)                                                                             [2]

        Your last question concerns the relationship of the evolving World Order of Baha'u'llah to the
institutions of a slowly awakening world. The following three extracts from letters written on behalf
of the Guardian to individual believers should prove helpful to your study of this subject.


               As regards the International Executive referred to by the Guardian in his "Goal of a New
        World Order", it should be noted that this statement refers by no means to the Bahá‟í
        Commonwealth of the future, but simply to that world government which will herald the advent
        and lead to the final establishment of the World Order of Baha‟u‟llah. The formation of this
        International Executive, which corresponds to the executive head or board in present-day
        national governments, is but a step leading to the Bahá‟í world government of the future, and
        hence should not be identified with either the institution of the Guardianship or that of the
        International House of Justice. (March 17, 1934)

               The Universal Court of Arbitration and the International Tribunal are the same.
        When the Bahá‟í State will be established they will be merged in the Universal House of
        Justice. (17 June 1933)

               You asked regarding the status of the different governments when the House of
        Justice will be established: this is not fully explained in the teachings, and what is not
        definitely provided for, it is for the House of Justice to legislate upon once that body is
        formed. (12 January 1933)

                 (5 July 1982 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual
                 believer)                                                                                [3]
... the five questions which arose concerning the world legislature, the world executive, and the
world tribunal during your study of the letters of the beloved Guardian collected and published under
the title of "The World Order of Baha'u'llah" have been conveyed to us.

      Regarding the five questions you have asked, it is clear from the text on pages 203-204 of "The
World Order of Baha'u'llah" that the system the Guardian is describing is the Bahá‟í system under
which "the causes of religious strife will be permanently removed", and "whose life is sustained by its
universal recognition of one God and by its allegiance to one common Revelation." In support of his
theme, Shoghi Effendi quotes 'Abdul-Baha's statement "that all nations and kindreds will be gathered
together under the Shadow of this Divine Banner ... ".

     As to the relationships of these three bodies, on page 7 of "The World Order of Baha'u'llah" the
Guardian has referred to the Universal House of Justice as "the supreme organ of the Bahá‟í
Commonwealth".

      We have so far also noted in Shoghi Effendi's writings two other elucidations which we share
with you.

               Touching the point raised in the Secretary's letter regarding the nature and scope of the
        Universal Court of Arbitration, this and other similar matters will have to be explained and
        elucidated by the Universal House of Justice, to which, according to the Master's explicit
        Instructions, all important and fundamental questions must be referred. ("Bahá‟í
        Administration", p. 47).

              The Universal Court of Arbitration and the International Tribunal are the same.
       When the Bahá‟í State will be established they will be merged in the Universal House of
       Justice. (Letter to an individual believer, dated June 17, 1933, written on the Guardian's behalf
       by his secretary).

      The Universal House of Justice at this time does not wish to go beyond the general guidelines
found in the Writings. When the time is ripe, however, it will have to provide further necessary
elucidations.
(23 June 1971 from the Universal House of Justice to a Local Spiritual Assembly) [4]


       As you are no doubt aware, the Guardian indicated that the development of mankind from its
present chaotic condition to the stage of the Bahá‟í World Commonwealth would be a long and
gradual one. The coming into existence of a World Authority and the initiation of the Lesser Peace
constitute one major transformation in this process, and will be followed by other stages of the
development of the Faith as outlined by Shoghi Effendi in his writings. Undoubtedly, as these
developments are taking place, the counsel the institutions of the Faith can give to governments, the
pattern of world administration offered by the Bahá‟í community and the great humanitarian projects
which will be launched under the aegis of the Universal House of Justice will exercise a great
influence on the course of progress.

      The Universal House of Justice has received your letter of 13 December 1984 inquiring about
the Lesser Peace and the Supreme Tribunal referred to in the writings of the Faith. We are asked to
convey the following comments.

        Baha'u‟llah's principal mission in appearing at this time in human history is the realization of the
        oneness of mankind and the establishment of peace among the nations; therefore, all the forces
        which are focused on accomplishing these ends are influenced by His Revelation. We know,
        however, that peace will come in stages. First, there will come the Lesser Peace, when the unity
        of nations will be achieved, then gradually the Most Great Peace the spiritual as well as social
        and political unity of mankind, when the Bahá‟í World Commonwealth, operating in strict
        accordance with the laws and ordinances of the Most Holy Book of the Bahá‟í Revelation, will
        have been established through the efforts of the Bahá‟ís.


       As to the Lesser Peace, Shoghi Effendi has explained that this will initially be a political unity
arrived at by decision of the governments of various nations; it will not be established by direct action
of the Bahá‟í community. This does not mean, however, that the Bahá‟ís are standing aside and
waiting for the Lesser Peace to come before they do something about the peace of mankind. Indeed,
by promoting the principles of the Faith, which are indispensable to the maintenance of peace, and by
fashioning the instruments of the Bahá‟í Administrative Order, which we are told by the beloved
Guardian is the pattern for future society, the Bahá‟ís are constantly engaged in laying the
groundwork for a permanent peace, the Most Great Peace being their ultimate goal.

       The Lesser Peace itself will pass through stages; at the initial stage the governments will act
entirely on their own without the conscious involvement of the Faith; later on, in God's good time,
the Faith will have a direct influence on it in ways indicated by Shoghi Effendi in
his "The Goal of a New World Order". In connection with the steps that will lead to this latter stage,
the Universal House of Justice will certainly determine what has to be done, in accordance with the
guidance in the Writings, such as the passage you quoted from "Tablets of Baha'u'llah", page 89. In the
meantime, the Bahá‟ís will undoubtedly continue to do all in their power to promote the establishment
of peace.
              (31 January 1985 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an
               individual believer)                                                                    [6]


The process leading to the ultimate achievement in all its aspects of "the world-wide sovereignty of
Baha'u'llah", the establishment in its fullness of His New World Order, will necessarily be a long
one, and the world during that time will pass through many stages. The details of that process cannot
now be discerned. Only through the passage of time and the enactments of the Universal House of
Justice can such details be gradually unfolded before the eyes of the friends and of the world.


      There are in the Sacred Texts and in the writings of Shoghi Effendi passages replete with
guidance for the changing conditions under which the followers of Baha'u'llah will be labouring
during the passing centuries, but it is not possible to see in advance the details of how they will be
applied. The eternal verities, the laws and guiding principles of the Faith are, however, clearly
revealed for all to see, and it will be in accordance with these, and through the power of the Covenant,
which 'Abdul-Baha called "the axis of the oneness of the world of humanity", that the Cause will
advance.

                         Extract from a letter regarding global governance



        Any activity on the part of Bahá‟ís to influence the processes toward the Lesser Peace, such as
the convocation of world leaders, should be undertaken with the understanding that the achievement
of the Lesser Peace is dependent on the initiatives of non-Bahá‟í leaders and not on the basis of any
Bahá‟í scheme. In this regard, the following reply was written on behalf of the beloved Guardian in a
letter dated 14 March 1939 to an individual believer:


        Your view that the Lesser Peace will come about through the political efforts of the states and
        nations of the world, and independently of any direct Bahá‟í plan or effort, and the Most Great
        Peace be established through the instrumentality of the believers, and by the direct operation of
        the laws and principles revealed by Baha'u'llah and the functioning of the Universal House of
        Justice as the supreme organ of the Bahá‟í superstate-your view on this subject is quite correct
        and in full accord with the pronouncements of the Guardian as embodied in "The Unfoldment
        of World Civilization". (See The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters (Wilmette:
        Bahá‟í Publishing Trust, 1991), pp.161-206)


        It is clear, then, that the friends must respect the prerogatives of political leaders in this matter
and allow them the latitude to exercise the initiative that only they can effectively take towards the
establishment of the Lesser Peace. It should be borne in mind in this regard that because of the
political gravity of the decisions involved in the establishment of the Lesser Peace, and the differing
political attitudes which it evokes, certain actions on the part of the Bahá‟í community would embroil
the friends in partisan politics. There is quite a difference between identifying the need for a
convocation of world leaders, as does the Peace Statement, and initiating the political processes
towards its realization. Even though the establishment of the Lesser Peace, of which the conference of
leaders will be a related event, will come about independently of any Bahá‟í plan or action, Bahá‟ís
should not be inert. Indeed, they may promote the concept of world peace with all that it implies
without allowing their activities to assume a character that could be identified with the political
processes which its realization will require.

       It is not the wish of the House of Justice to dampen anyone's enthusiasm for assisting in
developments towards peace, but it is critical that the friends understand the proprieties to be
observed by the Bahá‟í community in a matter of such vital importance. If, for example, the Bahá‟ís
attempt to take a leading role in organizing events associated with the anticipated convocation of
world leaders, their motives could be misunderstood. The risk is that Bahá‟ís might act in a manner
which would put non-Bahá‟ís in the awkward position of appearing to endorse a specifically Bahá‟í
vision or make them feel that they are seeking to impose the requirements of our religion upon
others. One needs to be aware that we Bahá‟ís can, in our zeal, easily overwhelm others and even,
owing to the wariness that we might inadvertently engender, cause them to lose sight of the practical
importance of establishing world peace.
(From a letter dated 14 January 1996 written to an individual on behalf of the Universal House
                of Justice)

                                       PEACE AMONG THE NATIONS


      World Peace, a hallmark of the emerging global civilization, will be realized as a tangible
expression of the principle of the oneness of humankind. This assurance is given in the teachings of
Baha'u'llah,

        Such a peace will result from the culmination of two distinct but simultaneous and mutually
reinforcing processes: one leading to the spiritual unity of the human race, referred to as the "Most
Great Peace"; the other to the political unity of nations and known as the "Lesser Peace". The former
is a distant goal, requiring a monumental change in human conduct that only religious faith can
ensure; the other is more immediate and can already be detected on the political horizon. The one is
directly related to the efforts of the Bahá‟í community in promoting the pivotal principle of their
Faith; the other is dependent on the actions of world political leaders and not on any Bahá‟í plan or
action.

       The political unity of nations implies the achievement of a relationship among them that will
enable them to resolve questions of international import through consultation rather than war and that
will lead to the establishment of a world government. The attainment of peace in the political realm
is discernible through the workings of a process that can be seen as having been definitely
established in the twentieth century amid the terror and turmoil that have characterized so much of
this period. It is noteworthy that the majority of the nations have come into being during this century
and that they have opted for peaceful relations with one another by joining in the membership of the
United Nations and through participation in regional organizations that facilitate their working
together. Moreover, the process of political unification is gaining acceleration through the awakening
of a consciousness of peace among the world's peoples that validates the work of the United Nations,
and through advances in science and technology, which have already contracted and transformed the
world into a single complex organism.


       The horrific experiences of two world wars which gave birth at first to the League of Nations
and then to the United Nations; the frequency with which world leaders, particularly in the decade of
the nineties, have met and agreed on the resolution of global issues; the call for a global order that
issued from the participation of these leaders in the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the
United Nations; the multiplication of organizations of civil society that focus attention on a variety of
international concerns through the operation of an ever-expanding network of activities; the
widespread debates on the need for global governance and numerous organized efforts towards world
peace; the emergence of international tribunals; the rapid developments in communications
technology that have made the planet borderless-these are among the voluminous evidences of a
momentum toward peaceful international relations that has clearly become irreversible.


       The Bahá‟í writings indicate that peace among the nations will be established in the twentieth
century; they do say, however, that a universal fermentation and horrendous social upheavals would
mark the transition from a warlike world to a peaceful one, but they do not point to the occurrence of
any specific cataclysmic event at the end of the century. Inevitably, the movement leading to world
unity must encounter opposing tendencies rooted in stubborn habits of chauvinism and partisanship
that refuse to yield to the expectations of a new age. The torturous suffering imposed by such
conditions as poverty, war, violence, fanaticism, disease,

and degradation of the environment, to which masses of people are subjected, is a consequence of this
opposition. Hence, before the peace of nations matures into a comprehensive reality, it must pass
through difficult stages, not unlike those experienced by individual nations until their internal
consolidation was achieved. But that the process toward peace is far advanced can hardly be denied.
