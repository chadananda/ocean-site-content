 The Rise of Justice in th e S piritual and

Sec ular Lif e of Man
An Exp osition on excerp ts from The Advent

of Divine Justice by Sh oghi Effendi

James B. Thomas

Introduction

Shoghi Effendi, the Beloved Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith and
great grandson of its founder Bahá’u’lláh, began the follow-up
to the ground work laid out in his previous letter The
Unfoldment of World Civilization in 1936 with his treatise, The
Advent of Divine Justice in late December of 1938. The
purpose here is to examine four vital issues in this pivotal work.
First is the manner in which he raised the consciousness of the
young Bahá’í community in the West to a deeper level of Bahá’í
theology as the dark clouds of WWII were beginning to sweep
over Europe. Second is the systematic manner by which the
Guardian introduced methods for expansion of the Faith while
in the midst of a disintegrating society including how barriers
were to be overcome in the face of enormous challenges. Third
is the introduction of a form of justice not seen before in
human history. Fourth is the special role that the American
Bahá’í community would play in the future progress of the Faith
with special emphasis on the unique station of its community
and of its members.

He addressed the young American Bahá’í community just
when it was endeavoring to achieve one of the many plans,
which would ultimately be assigned to them in the fullness of
time. He found it difficult to adequately express his joy and
exultation when contemplating “the ceaseless evidences of the
dynamic energy which animates the stalwart pioneers of the
World Order of Bahá’u’lláh in the execution of the Plan
committed to their charge.” He applauded the close cohesive
interaction and harmony between the various agencies that
constituted the basic framework of every properly functioning

392          The Rise of Justice in the Spiritual and Secular Life of Man

Bahá’í community. And he referred to this as a “striking
contrast to the disruptive tendencies” which the discordant
elements of society so tragically manifested. (ADJ-2)

Recurren t Crises

These disruptive tendencies caused recurrent crises that were
described as “afflicting an ever-increasing portion of the human
race” which must continue to exercise, at least temporarily, a
morbidly negative influence on the young Bahá’í community
that had by then reached the far corners of the world, albeit in
small numbers. He asked:

> How can the beginnings of a world upheaval, unleashing
> forces that are so gravely deranging the social, the
> religious, the political, and the economic equilibrium of
> organized society, throwing into chaos and confusion
> political systems, racial doctrines, social conceptions,
> cultural standards, religious associations, and trade
> relationships -- how can such agitations, on a scale so vast,
> so unprecedented, fail to produce any repercussions on the
> institutions of a Faith of such tender age whose teachings
> have a direct and vital bearing on each of these spheres of
human life and conduct? (ADJ 2-3)

This did indeed affect the lives of the followers of
Bahá’u’lláh as they found themselves in a maelstrom of
“contending Passions” wherein their institutions were
endangered while the very core of their belief system was under
attack. In mid-Europe the Bahá’í community with its potential
to “radiate the splendor of the light of the Faith on the
countries that surround it“ was stifled by the Nazi regime and
its voice silenced.

The large Bahá’í community of ’Ishqábád, Turkistan in
central Asia where the first Bahá’í Center and Mashriqu’l-
Adhkár (House of Worship) had been built, was at the mercy of
forces that, for decades were bent on reducing it to utter
impotence. This culminated with the expropriation of its
Temple by the Soviet Union concurrently with disbandment of
its Spiritual Assemblies and the imprisonment of a number of
the followers of the Faith.

In Iran where the vast majority of Bahá’ís lived and whose
Capital, Ṭihrán had been hailed by Bahá’u’lláh as "the mother of
the world" and “the dayspring of the joy of mankind" there was
a civil authority “as yet undivorced officially from the

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                   393

paralyzing influences of an antiquated, a fanatical, and
outrageously corrupt clergy.” The fact was that the political
collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1908 left the smoldering
remains of a spiritually bankrupt priesthood as the only
meaningful influence on the people of the Middle East, civil
authority notwithstanding. And with the pathetic demise of the
despicable, corrupt Qájár Dynasty of Iran in 1925, the vestigial
remains of a once glorious civilization offered its final death
rattle. The Guardian described the actions by this unholy
symbiotic relationship of clergy and state as it relentlessly
repressed the adherents of the Bahá’í Faith in the land of its
birth.

> Indifferent to the truth that the members of this
> innocent and proscribed community can justly claim to
> rank as among the most disinterested, the most
> competent, and the most ardent lovers of their native
> land...such an authority refuses to grant to a Faith
> which numerically outnumbers the adherents of either
> the Christian, the Jewish, or the Zoroastrian Faiths in
> that land, the necessary legal right to enforce its laws,
> to administer its affairs, to conduct its schools, to
> celebrate its festivals, to circulate its literature, to
> solemnize its rites, to erect its edifices, and to
> safeguard its endowments. (ADJ-4)
Concurrently, in the Holy Land, incidents of racial strife,
terrorism and fratricide enflamed the animosities between Jew,
Christian and Muslim alike. The rising tide of lawlessness
endangered the neutral status of the Bahá’í community and
interfered with its normal functions. Its very members were
imperiled, as was the flow of Bahá’í pilgrims and yet the Bahá’í
Holy places were miraculously preserved.

Shoghi Effendi then defined the world as being “torn with
conflicting passions, and perilously disintegrating from within,”
but a world also confronted by an infant Faith that... “seems to
be drawn into its controversies, entangled by its conflicts,
eclipsed by its gathering shadows, and overpowered by the
mounting tide of its passions.” He further explained that within
the heart of the cradle of “the as-yet unemancipated Faith of
Bahá'u'lláh,..” the forces of violence were impelling its retreat.
(ADJ-5)

> The strongholds of such a Faith, one by one and day after
> day, are to outward seeming being successively isolated,
> assaulted and captured. As the lights of liberty flicker and
394            The Rise of Justice in the Spiritual and Secular Life of Man

> go out, as the din of discord grows louder and louder
> every day, as the fires of fanaticism flame with increasing
> fierceness in the breasts of men, as the chill of irreligion
> creeps relentlessly over the soul of mankind, the limbs and
> organs that constitute the body of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh
> appear, in varying measure, to have become afflicted with
> the crippling influences that now hold in their grip the
whole of the civilized world. (ADJ-5)

He then quoted ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s timely comment on the
seriousness of the hour. “The darkness of error that has
enveloped the East and the West is, in this most great cycle,
battling with the light of Divine Guidance. Its swords and its
spears are very sharp and pointed; its army keenly bloodthirsty.”
(ADJ-6)

> And again:
> This day, the powers of all the leaders of religion are
> directed towards the dispersion of the congregation of the
> All-Merciful, and the shattering of the Divine Edifice. The
> hosts of the world, whether material, cultural or political
> are from every side launching their assault, for the Cause
> is great, very great. Its greatness is, in this day, clear and
> manifest to men's eyes. (ADJ-6)

Chief Remainin g Cita del

In spite of these crises there was still an enduring hope for
the embryonic Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. Shoghi Effendi declared the
Bahá’í community of North America to be the chief remaining
citadel of the Faith and he further identified it as the cradle of
the New World Order of Bahá’u’lláh. He reminded the doubters
of the special spiritual destiny of America with a quote from
‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

> The continent of America is, in the eyes of the one true
> God, the land wherein the splendors of His light shall be
> revealed, where the mysteries of His Faith shall be
> unveiled, where the righteous will abide, and the free
> assemble.” (ADJ-6)
The Guardian observed that the North American believers
had “shown its capacity to be recognized as the torchbearer of
that light, the repository of those mysteries, the exponent of
that righteousness and the sanctuary of that freedom.” He then,
with great honor, referred to the American believers as “the

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                   395

spiritual descendants of the Dawn-Breakers of an heroic Age”
who would usher in the New World Order, “the shell ordained
to enshrine that priceless jewel, the world civilization, of which
the Faith itself is the sole begetter.” (ADJ-7)

He asked: What community other than the North American
Bahá’ís had established the administrative institutions that
would become so critical to the new Order? It had also, with
consistency, resourcefulness, perseverance and fidelity extended
the framework within which those nascent institutions could
alone multiply and mature. The community was fired by noble
vision to raise an edifice that could be regarded “as the greatest
contribution ever made by the West to the Cause of
Bahá'u'lláh?” Furthermore, the community had secured the
allegiance of Royalty with marvelous testimony. It had shown
foresight, organizing ability in establishing schools “for the
enrichment and consolidation of its teaching force.” (ADJ-8)

The community had produced pioneers with qualities of
audacity, consecration, tenacity, and devotion that would
forsake their all to “scatter over the surface of the globe, and
hoist in its uttermost corners the triumphant banner of the
Faith. They undertook the labor to exercise the patience, and to
provide the funds required for the translation and publication
of their sacred literature. It was the first Bahá’í community

> to frame its national and local constitutions, thereby
> laying down the fundamental lines of the twin charters
> designed to regulate the activities, define the functions,
> and safeguard the rights, of its institutions.”(ADJ 9-10) It
> secured the basis of its national endowments, and obtained
> the necessary documents assuring the recognition of its
> Spiritual Assemblies.
> And finally what other community has had the privilege,
> and been granted the means, to succor the needy, to plead
> the cause of the downtrodden, and to intervene so
> energetically for the safeguarding of Bahá'í edifices and
> institutions in countries such as Persia, Egypt, Iraq,
> Russia, and Germany, where, at various times, its fellow-
> believers have had to suffer the rigors of both religious
> and racial persecution? (ADJ-10)
> Shoghi Effendi acknowledged the achievements of the
American Bahá’í community during the previous two decades as
deserving to rank “as a memorable chapter in the history of the
Formative Period of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh.” He commented

396           The Rise of Justice in the Spiritual and Secular Life of Man

further that, great as had been the friends achievements, the
tasks before them were far greater in magnitude than anything
they had achieved in the past. History would bear out the truth
of those words.

The Guardian described a “Crusade of still greater
magnitude” with the explanation that the virtual establishment
of the Administrative Order of their Faith was the first task for
the American Bahá’ís called into being by the Will of 'Abdu'l-
Bahá. They addressed themselves, with equal zest and
consecration, to the next more arduous task of erecting the
magnificent House of worship at the holiest spot in North
America and then resolved to undertake yet another task--the
Seven Year Plan, the first practical step towards the fulfillment
of the Tablets of the Divine Plan.

The opening of the second century of the Bahá'í era was to
include the formation of at least one center in each of the
Republics of the Western Hemisphere. And most interesting
was his declaration that the Plan espoused by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
would, after perusal “instantly reveal a scope for their activities
that stretches far beyond the confines of the Western
Hemisphere.”

> The moment this Divine Message is carried forward by the
> American believers from the shores of America and is
> propagated through the continents of Europe, of Asia, of
> Africa, and of Australasia, and as far as the islands of the
> Pacific, this community will find itself securely estab-
lished upon the throne of an everlasting dominion. (ADJ-13)

In effect then, The Tablets of the Divine Plan, addressed to
the Bahá’ís of the U.S. and Canada, were ultimately intended to
inspire the expansion of the Faith throughout the world. The
believers in the west thus initiated the Seven Year Plan as
decreed by Shoghi Effendi.

The Guardian then laid out a startling array of possibilities
for the future of the American Bahá’ís, possibilities that far
exceeded anything that they might have imagined. They were to
erect the various dependencies of the first Mashriqu'l-Adhkár of
the West, and to deal with the intricate issues involving the
establishment and the extension of the structural basis of Bahá'í
community life. They were to play a significant part in the
election of the International House of Justice and its
establishment in the Holy Land, and to help establish the
spiritual and administrative center of the Bahá'í world, together

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                   397

with the formation of its auxiliary branches and subsidiary
institutions. They were to be vitally involved in the worldwide
Bahá’í community efforts regarding the multitude of challenges
facing that community. Listed was the codification and
promulgation of the ordinances of the Most Holy Book, and the
third Mashriqu'l-Adhkár of the Bahá'í world in the outskirts of
the city of Ṭihrán. Also included were the precautionary and
defensive measures to be devised, coordinated, and carried out
to counteract the full force of the inescapable attacks that the
organized efforts of ecclesiastical organizations of various
denominations would progressively launch and relentlessly
pursue. And they were to “enable a sore-tried Faith to pass
through the successive stages of unmitigated obscurity, of
active repression, and of complete emancipation.” He further
commented:

> The challenge offered by these opportunities the
> American believers, I feel confident, will, in addition to
> their answer to the teaching call voiced by 'Abdu'l-Bahá
> in His Tablets, unhesitatingly take up, and will, with
> their traditional fearlessness, tenacity, and efficiency,
> so respond to it as to confirm, before all the world,
> their title and rank as the champion-builders of the
> mightiest institutions of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh. (ADJ-
> 15)
The believers were kindly encouraged to acknowledge the
bounty spread before them and they were lovingly nourished in
preparation for the arduous trials that would confront them in
the dark days before WWII. He reminded them that His
unfailing light was shinning upon them with incomparable
splendor.

> Though small in numbers, and circumscribed as yet in
> your experiences, powers, and resources, yet the Force
> which energizes your mission is limitless in its range and
> incalculable in its potency. Though the enemies which
> every acceleration in the progress of your mission must
> raise up be fierce, numerous, and unrelenting, yet the
> invisible Hosts which, if you persevere, must, as
> promised, rush forth to your aid, will, in the end, enable
> you to vanquish their hopes and annihilate their forces.

(ADJ 16)
The Guardian paused to emphasize the distinction between
the North American believers and the people from which God
had raised them up. It was important that they recognize the

398            The Rise of Justice in the Spiritual and Secular Life of Man

impact of the transmuting power of Bahá’u’lláh on their lives.
“Otherwise, the supreme and distinguishing function of His
Revelation, which is none other than the calling into being of a
new race of men, will remain wholly unrecognized and
completely obscured.” (ADJ-16)

The Supr eme Function Of His Revelation

The historical consistency of the appearance of the Great
Prophets of God in times and places where man had sunk to the
lowest levels of spiritual and moral degradation were noted.
Examples were the Hebrews under the Pharaohs before Moses
came to lead them to the Holy Land, the decline of the Jews
when Christ appeared, the barbarity of Arabia when Muhammad
arose and the decadence of Persia in the hour of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Revelation. It was never the high moral standards nor the social
attainments of any people that would initiate the appearance of
a Divine Messenger.

> For it is precisely under such circumstances, and by such
> means that the Prophets have, from time immemorial,
> chosen and were able to demonstrate their redemptive
> power to raise from the depths of abasement and of
> misery, the people of their own race and nation,
> empowering them to transmit in turn to other races and
> nations the saving grace and the energizing influence of
their Revelation. (ADJ-18)

Persia had sunk to the lowest depths of perversity and
thereby became the receptacle of the transforming power of the
Revelations of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. Their regenerating spirit
transformed “the most cowardly, and perverse of peoples into a
race of heroes,..” It was untenable to maintain the belief that
the excellence of Persia and the nobility of its people were the
basic reasons for the appearance of the new Revelation. In a
similar manner, but lesser extent, this principle would also apply
to the country that would be designated as the cradle of the
World Order of Bahá’u’lláh. The United States, the country that
would bear such an honor was not chosen because of its
excellence or special merit.

> It is precisely by reason of the patent evils which,
> notwithstanding     its   other     admittedly    great
> characteristics and achievements, an excessive and
> binding materialism has unfortunately engendered
> within it that the Author of their Faith and the Center
> of His Covenant have singled it out to become the
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                    399

> standard-bearer of the New World Order envisaged in
> their writings. (ADJ-19)
Shoghi Effendi declared that this was the best way that
Bahá’u’lláh could demonstrate His power to raise up men and
women who were “immersed in a sea of materialism, and
notorious for its political corruption, lawlessness and laxity in
moral standards,” to become the champions of moral rectitude
and undiscriminating fellowship. This would be prerequisite to
their call to bring into being the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh
and a new world civilization.

He pondered the staggering responsibility that would be born
by the young, inexperienced American believers in their efforts
to weed out the faults and habits derived from their own nation
while cultivating the characteristics so necessary to their
participation in the work of their Faith. He further stressed
what he felt were the essential requirements for the work that
would demand the undivided attention of the North American
believers.

Spiritual Prerequisites

The first of these spiritual prerequisites was defined as a high
sense of moral rectitude in their social and administrative
activities. This would particularly apply to their elected
representatives at all levels of administration. The second would
primarily concern Bahá’í youth who must all observe chastity in
their individual lives. The third would require that all members
of the Bahá’í community be free of prejudice of any kind. The
Guardian strongly reaffirmed these points.

> A rectitude of conduct, an abiding sense of undeviating
> justice, unobscured by the demoralizing influences
> which a corruption-ridden political life so strikingly
> manifests; a chaste, pure, and holy life, unsullied and
> unclouded by the indecencies, the vices, the false
> standards, which an inherently deficient moral code
> tolerates, perpetuates, and fosters; a fraternity freed
> from that cancerous growth of racial prejudice, which
> is eating into the vitals of an already debilitated society
> -- these are the ideals which the American believers
> must, from now on, individually and through concerted
> action, strive to promote,... (ADJ-23)
Shoghi Effendi called upon the words of Bahá’u’lláh and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá extensively in the effort to unequivocally

emphasize the importance of the rectitude of conduct that all
Bahá’ís must observe. Following are a few admonitions:

> The companions of God are, in this day, the lump that
> must leaven the peoples of the world. They must show
> forth such trustworthiness, such truthfulness and
> perseverance, such deeds and character that all mankind
> may profit by their example. I swear by Him Who is the
> Most Great Ocean! ‘Within the very breath of such
> souls as are pure and sanctified far-reaching
> potentialities are hidden. So great are these
> potentialities that they exercise their influence upon all
> created things. (ADJ 23)
Again from Bahá’u’lláh an explanation of purpose:

> The purpose of the one true God in manifesting
> Himself is to summon all mankind to truthfulness and
> sincerity, to piety and trustworthiness, to resignation
> and submissiveness to the will of God, to forbearance
> and kindliness, to uprightness and wisdom. His object
> is to array every man with the mantle of a saintly
> character, and to adorn him with the ornament of holy
> and goodly deeds. (GWB 299)
Also He warns:

> Beware, O people of Bahá, lest ye walk in the ways of
> them whose words differ from their deeds. Strive that ye
> may be enabled to manifest to the peoples of the earth the
> signs of God, and to mirror forth His commandments. Let
> your acts be a guide unto all mankind, for the professions
> of most men, be they high or low, differ from their
> conduct. It is through your deeds that ye can distinguish
> yourselves from others. Through them the brightness of
> your light can be shed upon the whole earth. Happy is the
> man that heedeth My counsel, and keepeth the precepts
> prescribed by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

(GWB 305)
And ‘Abdu’l-Bahá counseled the believers:

> Should any one of you enter a city, he should become a
> center of attraction by reason of his sincerity, his
> faithfulness and love, his honesty and fidelity, his
> truthfulness and loving-kindness towards all the peoples
> of the world, so that the people of that city may cry out
> and say: ‘This man is unquestionably a Bahá'í, for his

> manners, his behavior, his conduct, his morals, his
> nature, and disposition reflect the attributes of the
> Bahá'ís. Not until ye attain this station can ye be said to
> have been faithful to the Covenant and Testament of
> God...The most vital duty, in this day is to purify your
> characters, to correct your manners, and improve your
> conduct. (BWF-401)
He further asserted: “Truthfulness is the foundation of all
human virtues.” Bahá’ís embrace this for without it, progress
for the soul is impossible in any of the worlds of God! Shoghi
Effendi elaborated on the potency of such conduct in the
actions of elected representatives, and of participants in
business dealings. The same should be true in domestic matters
and in service. In fact, all human conduct should be in
compliance with the Most Holy, the Book of Laws. Such
rectitude of conduct at all levels of Bahá’í life constitutes the
transcendental principle of Divine Justice “that must be
regarded as the crowning distinction of all Local and National
Assemblies, in their capacity as forerunners of the Universal
House of Justice...” (ADJ-27) This concept is then supported by
numerous quotes from the writings of the Faith followed by this
statement from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

> God be praised! The sun of justice hath risen above the
> horizon of Bahá'u'lláh. For in His Tablets the foundations
> of such a justice have been laid as no mind hath, from the
> beginning of creation, conceived. The canopy of existence
> resteth upon the pole of justice, and not of forgiveness,
> and the life of mankind dependeth on justice and not on
> forgiveness. (ADJ-28)
The implications of modesty, temperance and decency require
moderation in all the things that we do, according to the
Guardian. Spiritual prerequisites are restated:

> It requires total abstinence from all alcoholic drinks, from
> opium, and from similar habit-forming drugs. It condemns
> the prostitution of art and of literature, the practices of
> nudism and of companionate marriage, infidelity in
> marital relationships, and all manner of promiscuity, of
> easy familiarity, and of sexual vices. It can tolerate no
> compromise with the theories, the standards, the habits,
> and the excesses of a decadent age. Nay rather it seeks to
> demonstrate, through the dynamic force of its example,
> the pernicious character of such theories, the falsity of
> such standards, the hollowness of such claims, the

> perversity of such habits, and the sacrilegious character of
> such excesses. (ADJ-30)

The Most Challen ging I ssue

The Guardian identified racial prejudice as the most
challenging issue facing the American Bahá’í community. He
referred to it as a corrosion that had bitten into the fiber of
American society. He declared that it would take ceaseless
efforts in sacrifice, vigilance, moral courage and fortitude to
resolve this issue of paramount importance. And he appealed to
both white and Negro alike who identify with the Bahá’í Faith,
to participate and lend assistance to the task of fulfilling the
instructions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He admonished them to follow
the examples set by Him, “Let them remember His courage, His
genuine love, His informal and indiscriminating fellowship, His
contempt for and impatience of criticism, tempered by His tact
and wisdom.” He further stated:

> To discriminate against any race, on the ground of its
> being socially backward, politically immature, and
> numerically in a minority, is a flagrant violation of the
> spirit that animates the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh...Freedom
> from racial prejudice, in any of its forms, should, at
> such a time as this when an increasingly large section of
> the human race is falling a victim to its devastating
> ferocity, be adopted as the watchword of the entire
> body of the American believers, in whichever state they
> reside, in whatever circles they move, whatever their
> age, traditions, tastes, and habits. (ADJ-35)
He appealed to white friends to resolve to contribute their
share to the solution of racism and to abandon any sense of
superiority and to avoid a patronizing attitude. Most
importantly a genuine friendship and sincerity of intentions is
required in dealing with a people who have suffered “such
grievous and slow-healing wounds.” He then admonished the
Negroes to make a corresponding effort to forget the past, to
show their power of warmth and to wipe out any trace of
suspicion. Neither should assume that the solution to such
problems is exclusively the responsibility of the other.

Their Double Crusade

Shoghi Effendi again emphasized the rectitude of conduct
and declared it to be the primary weapon that the American
believers must weld in their double crusade of regenerating the

inner life of the Bahá’í community and of assailing the evils that
remained entrenched in the life of their nation. The perfecting
of such weapons was far more important than the development
of any particular plan. More than anything else, this would
prepare them to bring into operation that “World Order which
was incubating within the worldwide administrative institutions
of their Faith.”

> In the conduct of this twofold crusade the valiant warriors
> struggling in the name and for the Cause of Bahá'u'lláh
> must, of necessity, encounter stiff resistance, and suffer
> many a setback. Their own instincts, no less than the fury
> of conservative forces, the opposition of vested interests,
> and the objections of a corrupt and pleasure-seeking
> generation, must be reckoned with, resolutely resisted, and
> completely overcome. (ADJ-41)
> He pleaded that the Bahá’ís in the west be not afraid of
criticism for it is a voice that indirectly reinforces the
proclamation of the Cause. But to effect a spiritual
transformation in the multitudes of the hungry, restless and un-
shepherded requires that the agency by which the message of
Bahá’u’lláh is imparted be free of the defilements that it seeks
to remove!

It was the Seven Year Plan that would occupy the believers
time and thought in the ornamentation of the Temple in
Wilmette, Illinois and the expansion of teaching efforts in
North and South America. The Temple stood on the holiest spot
in the western hemisphere and its completion would, in time,
have a profound effect as a “silent teacher” in the Cradle of the
Administrative Order of the Bahá’í Faith. The teaching goal was
to have at least one local spiritual assembly in every state of the
United States and every province in Canada. Also, one Bahá’í
center was to be created in each Latin American Republic.

The Tea chin g Requiremen ts

At this juncture, Shoghi Effendi felt compelled to clarify the
purpose of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár of the West “as no more than
an instrument for a more effective propagation of the Cause...”
over and above its beauty and the ideals that it symbolized. In
addition, the teaching requirements of the Seven Year Plan
would include the sustained attention of the entire Bahá’í
community in spite of any limited experience. Teaching was not
to be the sole domain of the administrative institutions.

> The field is indeed so immense, the period so critical, the
> Cause so great, the workers so few, the time so short, the
> privilege so priceless, that no follower of the Faith of
> Bahá'u'lláh, worthy to bear His name, can afford a
> moment's hesitation... That God-born Force, irresistible in
> its sweeping power, incalculable in its potency,
> unpredictable in its course, mysterious in its workings,
> and awe-inspiring in its manifestations...is, under our very
> eyes, sundering, on the one hand, the age-old ties which
> for centuries have held together the fabric of civilized
> society, and is unloosing, on the other, the bonds that still
> fetter the infant and as yet unemancipated Faith of
Bahá'u'lláh. (ADJ-46)

The    Guardian      intimated that such      extraordinary
circumstances to spread the knowledge of their Faith might not
recur again. Moreover, the importance of the teaching
campaign in Canada and throughout the United States could not
be overestimated. And he felt that it must follow certain
principles to attain its objective.

First, the believers were to thoroughly familiarize themselves
with the history and teachings of the Faith, the station of its
Forerunner, the Báb and the laws revealed by its Author,
Bahá’u’lláh. To do so would require conscientious study if its
literature and assimilation of its laws and principles. It would
also require memorization of prayers and exhortations. It would
be necessary to master the essentials of its administration and to
keep abreast of current affairs and latest developments.

Following this, they were to familiarize themselves with the
languages of Latin America as well as the three great Island
groups in the Pacific Ocean. He advised the teaching pioneers,
with an admonition from Bahá’u’lláh: “Be unrestrained as the
wind,” The Guardian further added:

> No participator in this inter-American campaign of
> teaching must feel that the initiative for any particular
> activity connected with this work must rest solely with
> those agencies, whether Assemblies or committees, whose
> special concern is to promote and facilitate the attainment
> of this vital objective of the Seven Year Plan. It is the
> bounden duty of every American believer, as the faithful
> trustee of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's Divine Plan, to initiate, promote,
> and consolidate, within the limits fixed by the
> administrative principles of the Faith, any activity he or
> she deems fit to undertake for the furtherance of the Plan.

> (ADJ 50)
> Shoghi Effendi then suggests a wide variety of approaches to
teaching depending upon the characteristics of a given culture
yet all the while safeguarding the integrity of the Faith. Then he
emphasized how important the spirit of teaching should be:

> Let him remember the example set by 'Abdu'l-Bahá, and
> His constant admonition to shower such kindness upon
> the seeker, and exemplify to such a degree the spirit of the
> teachings he hopes to instill into him, that the recipient
> will be spontaneously impelled to identify himself with the
> Cause embodying such teachings. (ADJ 52)
Yet, Shoghi Effendi tempered the afore mentioned flexibility
with the following guidelines.

> Let every participator in the continent-wide campaign
> initiated by the American believers, and particularly those
> engaged in pioneer work in virgin territories, bear in mind
> the necessity of keeping in close and constant touch with
> those responsible agencies designed to direct, coordinate,
> and facilitate the teaching activities of the entire
> community. (ADJ 52)
> The Guardian unequivocally placed the mandate of teaching
upon every participant in the Seven Year Plan with the caveat
that it be “the all-pervading concern of his life.” This would
apply to “all the republics, classes and denominations of the
entire Western Hemisphere.”

The Awakening Of Latin Amer ica

The next step for the North American Bahá’ís in their
initiation of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan was to set in motion a
tremendous exertion to assist a few isolated believers in their
efforts to awaken the nations of South America to the call of
Bahá’u’lláh. This second phase of the Seven Year Plan would
have to be entered before it could be considered as fully
launched. And they were assured of the effusions of Divine
Grace that would be poured upon them with overwhelming
evidences of their regenerative power.

Central and South America embraced twenty independent
nations equaling one third of the sovereign states at the time
and would play “an increasingly important part in the shaping
of the world’s future destiny.” Shoghi Effendi then exuded one
his inspiring appeals to the Bahá’í community of North

America:

Let some, at this very moment, gird up the loins of their
> endeavor, flee their native towns, cities, and states, forsake
> their country, and, “putting their whole trust in God as the
> best provision for their journey,” set their faces, and direct
> their steps towards those distant climes, those virgin fields,
> those unsurrendered cities, and bend their energies to
> capture the citadels of men's hearts -- hearts, which, as
> Bahá'u'lláh has written, “the hosts of Revelation and of
> utterance can subdue.” Let them not tarry until such time as
> their fellow-laborers will have passed the first stage in their
> campaign of teaching, but let them rather, from this very
> hour, arise to usher in the opening phase of what will come
> to be regarded as one of the most glorious chapters in the
> international history of their Faith.(ADJ 59)
His appeal then relied upon the call of Bahá’u’lláh:

> O wayfarer in the path of God! Take thou thy portion of
> the ocean of His grace, and deprive not thyself of the
> things that lie hidden in its depths.... A dewdrop out of
> this ocean would, if shed upon all that are in the heavens
> and on earth, suffice to enrich them with the bounty of
> God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. With
> the hands of renunciation draw forth from its life-giving
> waters, and sprinkle therewith all created things, that they
> may be cleansed from all man-made limitations, and may
> approach the mighty seat of God, this hallowed and
> resplendent Spot. Be not grieved if thou performest it thy-
> self alone. Let God be all-sufficient for thee... (GWB 279)
Following this were the inspiring words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

> O ye apostles of Bahá'u'lláh! May my life be sacrificed for
> you!... Behold the portals which Bahá'u'lláh hath opened
> before you! Consider how exalted and lofty is the station
> you are destined to attain; how unique the favors with
> which you have been endowed...My thoughts are turned
> towards you, and my heart leaps within me at your
> mention. Could ye know how my soul gloweth with your
> love, so great a happiness would flood your hearts as to
> cause you to become enamored with each other...The full
> measure of your success is as yet unrevealed, its
significance still un-apprehended. (BWF 423)

The goal was to establish in each Latin American country at
least one Bahá’í center by the hundredth anniversary (22 May,

1944) of the birth of the Faith. This would provide the
foundation upon which the North American believers could
build, in Central and South America, the Administrative Order
during the opening years of the second century of the Bahá’í
era.

The object was to establish a necessary foundation, to pave
the way in a systematic manner of the laying of the basis for the
permanent national and local Bahá’í institutions in Latin
America. Further, the campaign would initiate the revealing of
essential stages the American believers were to play in the
worldwide propagation of their Cause. Ultimately, it would be
the believers in Latin countries that would distinguish
themselves but first it would require the sending of settlers and
itinerant teachers “to raise the call of the New Day in a new
continent.”

All manner of support and resources were to be provided the
pioneers including properly translated literature and
appropriate publicity for its distribution. The teachers were to
mix in a friendly manner, with all sections of the population
regardless of creed or color. They were to patiently endeavor to
implant such love and devotion in their hearts of the few who
were receptive to enable them to become self-sufficient
promoters of the Faith in their localities. But they were also
advised to exercise care so that their efforts would not be
misconstrued to be proselytizing.

In his appeal for pioneers, the Guardian particularly
addressed the American believers who were able to establish
permanent residence in Latin countries by establishing their own
means of livelihood. This would greatly relieve the pressure on
the Teaching Fund while allowing them to partake of the sacred
privilege of carrying out so noble an enterprise. For those who
were unable to go should appoint and support one who could.

Shoghi Effendi was especially grateful to the “Handmaidens
of God” who had, since the inception of the Faith, opened up so
many diversified countries around the globe. They, more than
the men, had boldly moved forward in the selfless act of
teaching at all levels.

A special appeal was made to the Bahá’í youth to exercise
their adventurous spirit and vigor in arousing the interest of
their fellow youth in the Faith. Though inexperienced, it would
be their optimism and alertness that would animate them to
fulfill their potential in service to the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh.

He then made special note of Panama, observing that the
unique geographical position of Panama endowed it with great
importance in connecting the North American Bahá’í
communities to the Central American States as well as to the
South American Continent. In like manner it was noted by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá that it connected the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific
through the Canal and would thus provide significant traffic
that would allow the Faith to unite the East and West. Teaching
in Panama would therefore have great importance because a
strong Bahá’í community in Panama would provide a key matrix
from which the Faith could spread North to South and East to
West.

The Guardian recalled the vision set by the Seven Year Plan as
a vast functional priority facing the American believers and
called upon them to not let strife and confusion befog their
own vision. Upheavals should never deflect their course nor
should denunciations sap their loyalty. Reliance on God’s all
compelling Will would always be their pillar and guide.

> Far from yielding in their resolve, far from growing
> oblivious of their task, they should, at no time, however
> much buffeted by circumstances, forget that the
> synchronization of such world-shaking crises with the
> progressive unfoldment and fruition of their divinely
> appointed task is itself the work of Providence, the design
> of an inscrutable Wisdom, and the purpose of an all-
> compelling Will, a Will that directs and controls, in its
> own mysterious way, both the fortunes of the Faith and
the destinies of men. (ADJ 72)

The Seven Year Plan was but an initial stage in a far greater
Plan as delineated by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and authored by Bahá’u’lláh.
Reflections on these aspects would steel the resolve of the
American Bahá’í community and would dissipate their
forebodings regarding the ultimate objective of unity for the
entire planet.

The Adven t of The K ingdom

The Guardian noted a valuable insight offered by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá:

> The full measure of your success is as yet unrevealed, its
> significance still unapprehended. Erelong, ye will, with
> your own eyes, witness how brilliantly every one of you,
> even as a shining star, will radiate, in the firmament of

> your country, the light of Divine Guidance, and will
> bestow upon its people the glory of an everlasting life....
> The range of your future achievements still remains
undisclosed. (TDP 39)

It was His hope that the success attending their efforts in the
Americas would carry over to the rest of the world. Following
this, the advent of the Kingdom of the Lord would be
proclaimed in all inhabited continents of the globe. The positive
consequences of this would be very great for the American
Bahá’ís because they would then be recognized as spiritually
illumined and divinely guided. But to rest on such laurels would
be tantamount to betrayal of the trust placed upon them by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, a trust that Shoghi Effendi reassured us would
never be broken. The Guardian then reinforced this with
copious utterances gleaned from the untranslated reservoir of
Bahá’u’lláh’s billowing words, a few of which follow:

> Cling ye to the Cord of steadfastness, in such wise that all
> vain imaginings may utterly vanish. Speed ye forth from
> the horizon of power, in the name of your Lord, the
> Unconstrained, and announce unto His servants, with
> wisdom and eloquence, the tidings of this Cause, whose
> splendor hath been shed upon the world of being. Beware
> lest anything withhold you from observing the things
> prescribed unto you by the Pen of Glory, as it moved over
> His Tablet with sovereign majesty and might. Great is the
> blessedness of him that hath hearkened to its shrill voice,
> as it was raised, through the power of truth, before all
> who are in heaven and all who are on earth.... O people of
> Bahá! The river that is Life indeed hath flowed for your
> sakes. Quaff ye in My name, despite them that have
> disbelieved in God, the Lord of Revelation. (ADJ 76)
He continues describing deeper aspects of His Cause:

> Verily I say! No one hath apprehended the root of this
> Cause. It is incumbent upon everyone, in this day, to
> perceive with the eye of God, and to hearken with His ear.
> Whoso beholdeth Me with an eye besides Mine own will
> never be able to know Me. None among the
> Manifestations of old, except to a prescribed degree, hath
> ever completely apprehended the nature of this
> Revelation. I testify before God to the greatness, the
> inconceivable greatness of this Revelation. Again and
> again have We, in most of Our Tablets, borne witness to
> this truth, that mankind may be roused from its

heedlessness. (ADJ 77)

These quotes of Bahá’u’lláh as used by the Guardian not only
inspired the pioneers but also further educated the embryonic
community of American Bahá’ís in the verities of the Faith.

> This is the Day in which God's most excellent favors have
> been poured out upon men, the Day in which His most
> mighty grace hath been infused into all created things....
> This is the Day whereon the Ocean of God's mercy hath
> been manifested unto men, the Day in which the Daystar
> of His loving-kindness hath shed its radiance upon them,
> the Day in which the clouds of His bountiful favor have
> overshadowed the whole of mankind. (GWB 6)
> The window of opportunity to teach in virgin lands had
never been greater and every effort was precious to the Cause as
characterized by Bahá’u’lláh:

> This Day a door is open wider than both heaven and earth.
> The eye of the mercy of Him Who is the Desire of the
> worlds is turned towards all men. An act, however
> infinitesimal, is, when viewed in the mirror of the
> knowledge of God, mightier than a mountain. Every drop
> proffered in His path is as the sea in that mirror. For this
> is the Day which the one true God, glorified be He, hath
> announced in all His Books, unto His Prophets and His
Messengers. (ADJ 78)

A regenerating energy was showered upon the believers by
Bahá’u’lláh’s words, which would serve as a balm to them when
faced with enormous challenges in fulfilling the Seven Year
Plan.

> Through the movement of Our Pen of Glory We have, at
> the bidding of the Omnipotent Ordainer, breathed a new
> life into every human frame, and instilled into every word
> a fresh potency. All created things proclaim the evidences
> of this worldwide regeneration. O people! I swear by the
> one true God! This is the Ocean out of which all Seas have
> proceeded, and with which every one of them will
ultimately be united. (GWB 92)

These were but a few of the extraordinary utterances by
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that were previously unavailable
to the Bahá’ís. Shoghi Effendi finally referred to what he called
“some of the most momentous and thought-provoking
pronouncements ever made by 'Abdu'l-Bahá, in the course of

His epoch-making travels in the North American continent....”

> May this American Democracy be the first nation to
> establish the foundation of international agreement. May
> it be the first nation to proclaim the unity of mankind.
> May it be the first to unfurl the Standard of the Most
> Great Peace... The American people are indeed worthy of
> being the first to build the Tabernacle of the Great Peace,
> and proclaim the oneness of mankind.... For America hath
> developed powers and capacities greater and more
> wonderful than other nations.... The American nation is
> equipped and empowered to accomplish that which will
> adorn the pages of history, to become the envy of the
> world, and be blest in both the East and the West for the
> triumph of its people....The American continent gives
> signs and evidences of very great advancement. Its future
> is even more promising, for its influence and illumination
> are far-reaching. It will lead all nations spiritually. (PUP 36)

The Destin y Of America

As a literary convenience, the Guardian would often
interchange the terms ‘nation’ and ‘American’ when addressing
the Cradle of the Administrative order of Bahá’u’lláh,
specifically the United States of America and when doing so
there were three things that he brought to bear regarding the
future of that embryonic order. First, the nation was endowed
with the worthiness to play the part envisioned by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
It was the recipient of spiritual capacities of which a God-given
mission had fused into its people and which were even then
being manifested through the teaching efforts of the Bahá’ís.
Second, the orientation of that nation was inexplicably
gravitating toward policies and associations that would put it
on the course of its true destiny as a result of the creative
energies generated by the first stirrings of the World Order of
Bahá’u’lláh. Third, the world was rapidly moving toward a
conflict of ominous proportions and “the Great Republic of the
West” was being reluctantly drawn into its vortex. Shoghi
Effendi recognized the significance of these events within the
prophetic utterances of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

> The world is contracting into a neighborhood. America,
> willingly or unwillingly, must face and grapple with this
> new situation. For purposes of national security, let alone
> any humanitarian motive, she must assume the obligations
> imposed by this newly created neighborhood. Paradoxical

> as it may seem, her only hope of extricating herself from
> the perils gathering around her is to become entangled in
> that very web of international association which the Hand
of an inscrutable Providence is weaving. (ADJ-59)

The populace, except for the small community of believers
did not recognize the Hand that directed their destiny. Yet the
activities of both groups were contributing to the fulfillment of
the promises voiced by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Concurrently the world
had become an armed camp as religion’s light was diminishing
and moral authority was disintegrating. The words of
Bahá’u’lláh in the 1870s echoed a still fresh concern: “The winds
of despair are, alas, blowing from every direction, and the strife
that divides and afflicts the human race is daily increasing. The
signs of impending convulsions and chaos can now be
discerned....”(GWB-216) And, soon after the termination of the
first World War, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá prophesied:

> The ills from which the world now suffers will multiply;
> the gloom, which envelops it, will deepen. The Balkans will
> remain discontented. Its restlessness will increase. The
> vanquished Powers will continue to agitate. They will
> resort to every measure that may rekindle the flame of
> war. Movements, newly born and worldwide in their
> range, will exert their utmost for the advancement of their
> designs. The Movement of the Left will acquire great
importance. Its influence will spread. (ADJ-88)

The clear, emphatic voice of President Franklin Roosevelt
warned that attack was very possible due to the advanced
development of military aircraft and by other factors. The
Secretary of State said “These resurgent forces loom
threateningly throughout the world -- their ominous shadow
falls athwart our own Hemisphere...” And in the American
press: “We must mount vigilant guard over the Western
Hemisphere.” (ADJ-89)

Meanwhile, Shoghi Effendi noted the significant distance
that the nation had traveled since its formal repudiation of the
Wilsonian ideal (League of Nations) and found it to be highly
encouraging. He pondered the future possible relationships
between the Western republics and the affairs of the world
under the impact of international crises with respect to the
ultimate destiny of America. However, he emphasized that
nothing could alter the eventual course ordained by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá in The Tablets of The Divine Plan.

The Guardian further surmised that the impending
perplexities afflicting humanity would bode darkly for America
but that she would emerge determined to bring the full weight
of its influence “to exorcise forever, in conjunction with its
sister nations of both the East and the West, the greatest curse
which, from time immemorial, has afflicted and degraded the
human race.” It was felt that America would become purified
from the crucible of a common war and would be disciplined,
even molded by its lessons. Only then would it be positioned to
“lay the cornerstone of a universal and enduring peace, proclaim
the solidarity, the unity, and maturity of mankind, and assist in
the establishment of the promised reign of righteousness on
earth.” (ADJ 90-91)

> Then, and only then, will the American nation, while the
> community of the American believers within its heart is
> consummating its divinely appointed mission, be able to
> fulfill the unspeakably glorious destiny ordained for it by
> the Almighty, and immortally enshrined in the writings of
> 'Abdu'l-Bahá. Then, and only then, will the American
> nation accomplish “that which will adorn the pages of
> history, become the envy of the world and be blest in both
> the East and the West.” (ADJ-91)
> This last quotation concluded his communication and was
signed “SHOGHI” on Christmas Day, 1938. Now, with the
benefit of seven decades of hindsight it is astonishing to
observe the accuracy and insight expressed in the writings of the
Guardian when comparing his views to the historical events that
ensued after his remarkable utterances regarding the human
condition in the late 1930s.

In Summary

The first vital issue under question in The Advent of Divine
Justice mentioned earlier involved the Guardian educating the
Western Bahá’ís in the verities of their Faith by immersing them
in certain of its writings regarding the overriding principles,
virtues and administrative requirements that would armor them
in dealing with the travails of a disintegrating age. In the second
issue, he identified the most challenging spiritual barriers they
would face and the methods they would need to employ in
achieving success of the ambitious Seven Year Plan for teaching
the Faith in the Americas. Moreover, this would open the door
for worldwide expansion. Indeed, the future of the Faith was in
their hands as America was declared to be its Chief Remaining

Citadel. Regarding the third vital issue, that is Justice, the
Guardian explained in his inimitable way that the infusion of
laws and principles annunciated by Bahá’u’lláh within the
rectitude of conduct at all levels of Bahá’í community life
literally defined the transcendental principle of Divine Justice.
Thus a concept of justice that had never been acknowledged
before was born in those initial stages of the Divine Plan. He
declared this to be the “crowning distinction of all Local and
National Assemblies.”(ADJ-27) Of the fourth issue, Shoghi
Effendi surmised that America would be purified and molded by
the impending conflicts of world conflagration in a way that
would prepare her to lay the cornerstone of universal peace. Its
Bahá’í members were honored with the designation as the
Spiritual Descendants of the Dawn Breakers and the country
was given the high honor of being the Cradle of the Bahá’í
Administrative Order.

Conclusion

Perhaps the most subtle and enduring of these issues under
discussion is the notion of Divine Justice. With it, Justice has
reached an unprecedented plateau for it will henceforth embody
the spiritual characteristics that are so necessary for the
advancement of civilization. With it, the scourge of war will be
obliterated from the planet as will the most challenging issue of
racism. Such a perspective was previously augmented by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá as noted by Shoghi Effendi: “The continuance of
mankind depends upon justice and not upon forgiveness.”
(SAQ-270) This infers that justice is earned whereas forgiveness
is acquired by grace but grace alone will not suffice the rigors
and complexities of the modern age. In the words of
Bahá’u’lláh: “The structure of world stability and order hath
been reared upon, and will continue to be sustained by, the twin
pillars of reward and punishment...”(GWB-219) He also exalts
the spiritual ramifications of this concept when, speaking with
the voice of God, He says “The best beloved of all things in My
sight is Justice...By its aid thou shalt see with thine own eyes
and not through the eyes of others...Verily justice is My gift to
thee and the sign of My loving-kindness. Set it then before thine
eyes.”(HWB-3)

Finally, we can say with full conviction that the theory of
justice, which traditionally has tended to parallel the prevailing
range of ethical and political philosophy, now is embraced by a
profound new paradigm of spiritual parameters.
