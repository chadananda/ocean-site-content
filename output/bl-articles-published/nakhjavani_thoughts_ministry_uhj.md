Some Thoughts on the Ministry of the Universal House

of Justice

‘Alí Nakhjávání

Preamble

When the beloved Guardian passed away on November 4,
1957, the news of his passing convulsed the entire Bahá’í World.
A second distress soon followed when the announcement was
made by the Hands of the Cause that Shoghi Effendi had left no
Will and Testament, had appointed no successor as Guardian
of the Faith, and that the Aghsán one and all had broken the
Covenant. The “first effect” of this realization, as indicated in
the message of the Hands of the Cause to the Bahá’í world, “was
to plunge” them “into the very abyss of despair” (MC 36). A
similar sense of dismay seized the entire Bahá’í World.

Soon after the Universal House of Justice was established it
sent a message (dated 6 October 1963) to the Bahá’í World. This
message states that the House of Justice “finds that there is no
way to appoint or to legislate to make it possible to appoint a
second Guardian to succeed Shoghi Effendi” (MUHJ 14).
Reflecting on this message, the friends everywhere soon realized
that they had not properly understood the contents of the Will
and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

Shoghi Effendi had already stated that the World Order as
delineated by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Will “undoubtedly”
contained “manifold mysteries” (BA 8), and that we “must trust
to time, and the guidance of God’s Universal House of Justice,
to obtain a clearer and fuller understanding of its provisions
and implications” (BA 62).

The obligation of the friends was now well-defined. They had
to wait for the “guidance” of the Universal House of Justice,
to elucidate what certainly appeared to be “obscure questions”
(WT 20). The expectations of the believers were fulfilled when, in
response to questions asked, the Universal House of Justice

Elucidations                                                   335

wrote on 9 March 1965, on 27 May 1966, and on 7 December
1969, three letters (See MUHJ items # 23, 35 & 75 respectively) and
explained for the friends the basic truths underlying the
evolution of the Administrative Order of our Faith, and left
them free to conclude that the passing of the beloved Guardian,
without having appointed a Successor as Guardian and
Authorized Interpreter, was a clear possibility and an
understandable event.

When the English translation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas was
published in 1992, the Universal House of Justice had yet
another opportunity to explain the implications of Paragraph
42 of the Most Holy Book. In relation to the Law of Succession
in the Faith, this paragraph stands out as a most significant
and decisive statement. In this paragraph, Bahá’u’lláh clearly
envisages a time when there would be no institution to embody
the functions incumbent upon the Appointed and Authorized
Aghsán (that is to say, a Guardianship). Further, the Universal
House of Justice would not exist at that time and it would not
be propitious to elect that Body. These points are fully covered
in Notes 66 and 67, (pages 196 and 197) of the English text of the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas.

Regarding the timing of the election of the Universal House
of Justice we see in its letter mentioned above, dated 9 March
1965, the manner in which Shoghi Effendi foreshadowed the
election of the Universal House of Justice: “The Guardian had
given the Bahá’í World explicit and detailed plans covering the
period until Ridván 1963, the end of the Ten Year Crusade.
From that point onward, unless the Faith were to be
endangered, further divine guidance was essential”. The
rightness of the time was further confirmed by references in
Shoghi Effendi’s letters to the Ten Year Crusade being followed
by other plans under the direction of the Universal House of
Justice. One such reference is the following passage from a
letter addressed to the National Spiritual Assembly of the
British Isles on 25th February 1951, concerning its Two Year
Plan which immediately preceded the Ten Year Crusade:

> On the success of this enterprise, unprecedented in its
> scope, unique in its character and immense in its
> spiritual potentialities, must depend the initiation, at
> a later period in the Formative Age of the Faith of

> undertakings embracing within their range all National
> Assemblies functioning throughout the Bahá’í World….
> undertakings constituting in themselves a prelude to
> the launching of worldwide enterprises destined to be
> embarked upon, in future epochs of that same Age, by
> the Universal House of Justice, that will symbolize the
> unity and coordinate and unify the activities of these
> National Assemblies. (UD 261)
There can be no doubt that the “undertakings embracing
within their range all National Assemblies functioning
throughout the Bahá’í World” mentioned in the above passage
of the Guardian, certainly refer to the plans that Shoghi
Effendi gave to each of the twelve National Assemblies which he
described as the Generals of the Ten Year Plan.

With the stipulation made in Paragraph 42 of the Kitáb-i-
Aqdas, as well as with such statements, as quoted above, it
would be, in my opinion, totally untenable to maintain that
Shoghi Effendi was not aware that his passing would occur
some time during the Ten Year Crusade. If, therefore he did not
appoint a second Guardian as his Successor, and if he did not
write a Will and Testament in the traditional way, would it not
be entirely logical to conclude that lack of action in these
matters was a conscious act on his part?

In his personal conversations with pilgrims Shoghi Effendi
was reported to have repeatedly said that his ‘Dispensation’
was like his Will and Testament. The closest statement made by
him in writing, however, hinting at such a conclusion, is a
letter, written on his behalf, dated 10 January 1935 to Dr.
Mühlschlegel, in which he states that his ‘Dispensation’
constitutes “an invaluable supplement” to the Will and
Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, as well as to the Book of the
Covenant, which is Bahá’u’lláh’s Will and Testament. (LDG Vol.
1, 65)

Regarding the prophecy of Daniel as it relates to 1963, we
read the following in one of the Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

> Now concerning the verse in Daniel, the interpretation
> whereof thou didst ask, namely “Blessed is he who
> cometh unto the thousand three hundred and thirty
> five days. …according to this calculation a century will
> have elapsed from the dawn of the Sun of Truth, then
> will the teachings of God be firmly established upon the
> earth, and the Divine Light shall flood the world from
Elucidations                                                    337

> the East even unto the West. Then, on this day, will the
> faithful rejoice. (PA 49-50)
Indeed it was in 1963 that the Bahá’í World Community,
under the galvanizing and sustaining motivation of Shoghi
Effendi’s Ten Year Crusade, was enabled to diffuse the Light of
the Faith worldwide, and celebrate not only this victory, but
also the emergence of the Universal House of Justice at the
Bahá’í World Congress in London.

Furthermore, the following two paragraphs might well bear
upon this very theme. They contain an early hint by Shoghi
Effendi on the importance of this very date of 1963, which he
says would witness the “final erection” of the “Edifice” of
God’s Holy Cause:

> Ours, dearly-beloved co-workers, is the paramount
> duty to continue, with undimmed vision and unabated
> zeal, to assist in the final erection of that Edifice the
> foundations of which Bahá’u’lláh has laid in our hearts,
> to derive added hope and strength from the general
> trend of recent events, however dark their immediate
> effects, and to pray with unremitting fervor that He
> may hasten the approach of the realization of that
> Wondrous Vision which constitutes the brightest
> emanation of His Mind and the fairest fruit of the
> fairest civilization the world has yet seen.
> Might not the hundredth anniversary of the
> Declaration of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh mark the
> inauguration of so vast an era in human history? (WOB
> 48)

Compatibility of Texts

From the above summary three points clearly emerge:
1\. It had been contemplated in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas that there

> would be no co-existence between the Guardianship and
> the Universal House of Justice.
2\. The date for the election of the Universal House of

Justice had to be in 1963, at the end of the Ten Year Plan.
3\. It would certainly be reasonable to assume that Shoghi

Effendi was conscious of his impending passing.

It would be helpful at this point to consider the method
adopted by Bahá’u’lláh in His Kitáb-i-’Ahd regarding the line
of succession. In it He stipulates that Mírzá Muhammad-’Alí is
to succeed ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Now, compare that with ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s method in the first part of His Will and Testament. In
it He stipulates that Shoghi Effendi is to be succeeded,
generation after generation, by Appointed Aghsán serving as
Guardians. To me there is a similarity of method here, one that
provided a sense of continuity and concealed for a time the
tests that were inevitably to fall on the friends as future events
unfolded. Shoghi Effendi’s mention of “future Guardians” in
his writings could well be, in my opinion, equally understood
as a further application of this same method. All would be
tested in due course as to their faithful adherence to the
Covenant.

Does this similarity of method not remind us of the golden
key that Shoghi Effendi placed in our hands with which to
unlock one of the mysteries of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and
Testament? He pointed out to us that a study of the
authenticated texts of the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh and those of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá “will reveal the close relationship that exists
between them, as well as the identity of purpose and method
which they inculcate” (WOB 4).

Is this not also a reminder of the warning given by
Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán: “from time immemorial even
unto eternity the Almighty hath tried, and will continue to try,
His servants, so that light may be distinguished from darkness”
(KI 8) and furthermore we read in the same Book: “the divine
Purpose hath decreed that the true should be known from the
false….He hath, therefore, in every season sent down upon
mankind the showers of tests from His realm of glory” (KI 53).

Who Limits the Spheres of Jurisdiction?

In the ‘Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh’ Shoghi Effendi points
out that one of his duties was to provide “the necessary
guidance to define the sphere of the legislative action of its [the
Faith’s] elected representatives” (WOB 148). It is obvious that
the reference here is to the elected members of Local Spiritual
Assemblies, National Conventions, National Spiritual
Assemblies, as well as of the Universal House of Justice.

This function of the Guardianship was partly discharged
when, under his guidance and direction, the Constitutions of

Elucidations                                                   339

Local and National Spiritual Assemblies were formulated and
put into effect during his own ministry. What remained was to
determine the boundaries of the work of the Universal House of
Justice. The terms of the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
were superlative. He wrote: “Whatsoever they [the Guardian
and the Universal House of Justice] decide is of God” (WT 11).
He further added: “That which this body, [the elected members
of the Universal House of Justice (WT 20)] whether unanimously
or by a majority, doth carry, that is verily the Truth and the
Purpose of God Himself” (WT 19).

To complete his duty as Interpreter of these words in
relation to the work of the Universal House of Justice, Shoghi
Effendi wrote in his ‘Dispensation’ the following:

> The interpretation of the Guardian, functioning
> within his own sphere, is as authoritative and binding
> as the enactments of the International House of
> Justice, whose exclusive right and prerogative is to
> pronounce upon and deliver the final judgment on such
> laws and ordinances as Bahá’u’lláh has not expressly
> revealed. Neither can, nor will ever, infringe upon the
> sacred and prescribed domain of the other. Neither will
> seek to curtail the specific and undoubted authority
> with which both have been invested. (WOB 150)
It is highly significant that Shoghi Effendi, while defining
his duty as Guardian to interpret what had been revealed, goes
on to give the assurance to the Community, as well as to the
world, that the Universal House of Justice, when elected, will
never “infringe upon the sacred and prescribed domain” of
interpretation, which is the exclusive right of the
Guardianship. This assurance was fully realized and
permanently set in place when the Universal House of Justice,
in its Constitution wrote:

> The provenance, the authority, the duties, the sphere of
> action of the Universal House of Justice all derive from
> the Revealed Word of Bahá’u’lláh which, together with
> the interpretations and expositions of the Centre of
> the Covenant and the Guardian of the Cause… who,
> after ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, is the sole authority in the
> interpretation of Bahá’í Scripture…constitute the
> binding terms of reference of the Universal House of
> Justice and are its bedrock foundation. (CUHJ 4)

It must be remembered that apart from its vital function as
the Supreme Bahá’í Legislative Body, the Universal House of
Justice is named by Bahá’u’lláh Himself in Paragraph 42 of the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas as the Central Institution to which the Bahá’í
Community must turn after the termination of the line of the
Aghsán. This is confirmed by the statement made by the
Guardian that the two institutions of the Guardianship and
the Universal House of Justice are the “chosen Successors” of
Bahá’u’lláh and of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (WOB 20). On the basis of these
texts, the Universal House of Justice in its Constitution
describes its own “fundamental object” as the responsibility
“to ensure the continuity of that divinely-appointed authority
which flows from the Source of the Faith” (CUHJ 4), and then
adds the following statement: “There being no successor to
Shoghi Effendi as Guardian of the Cause of God, the Universal
House of Justice is the Head of the Faith and its supreme
institution, to which all must turn” (CUHJ 4). The position of
the Universal House of Justice as Head of the Faith will be
maintained, “until such time” in the words of this
Constitution, “as Almighty God shall reveal His new
Manifestation to Whom will belong all authority and power”
(CUHJ 4).

In light of the above quotations, it becomes clear that in
addition to its legislative authority, the Universal House of
Justice, while it is assured of divine guidance in not infringing
upon the domain of interpretation, is invested with
responsibilities which do and must include such powers and
duties that are incumbent upon the Head of the Faith.
Furthermore it is obvious that the two broad areas of
responsibility of the Universal House of Justice — namely
legislation and headship of the Faith, are as inseparable and
indispensable as were, in the case of Shoghi Effendi, his
responsibilities as Interpreter and Head of the Faith. Thus, if
anyone may venture to state that the sphere of jurisdiction of
the Universal House of Justice is confined to legislation, such
an assumption would clearly be baseless and entirely
unwarranted and unjustified.

It follows therefore that no institution or individual can
correctly determine whether the Guardian or the Universal
House of Justice are, at any given time, within or without their
own respective limits of jurisdiction. This point is confirmed
by the Guardian in one of his letters where this truth is clearly
set forth:

Elucidations                                                     341

> It is not for the individual believers to limit the sphere
> of the Guardian’s authority, or to judge when they have
> to obey the Guardian and when they are free to reject
> his judgment. Such an attitude would evidently lead to
> confusion and to schism. The Guardian being
> appointed interpreter of the Teachings, it is his
> responsibility to state what matters which, affecting
> the interests of the Faith, demand on the part of the
> believers complete and unqualified obedience to his
> instructions. (LG 312)
The principle clearly outlined above by the Guardian applies
equally to the Universal House of Justice, inasmuch as matters
affecting the interests of the Faith on a world-scale are best
judged and determined by the House itself. As indicated above,
Shoghi Effendi’s formal and confident assurance in his
‘Dispensation’ to the Bahá’í s everywhere and to the world at
large, to the effect that the Universal House of Justice will
never transgress its own limits of jurisdiction, should provide
the ultimate safeguard and guarantee, to one and all, that the
foundations on which the structure of the Administrative
Order is resting are firmly set and stable.

Is the Universal House of Justice the Head of a Complete
and Unmutilated World Order?

Let us now consider the contents and implications of a
crucial paragraph in ‘The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh’:

> Divorced from the institution of the Guardianship the
> World Order of Bahá’u’lláh would be mutilated and
> permanently deprived of that hereditary principle
> which, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written, has been invariably
> upheld by the Law of God. ‘In all the Divine
> Dispensations,’ He states, in a Tablet addressed to a
> follower of the Faith in Persia, ‘the eldest son hath been
> given extraordinary distinctions. Even the station of
> prophethood hath been his birthright’. Without such
> an institution the integrity of the Faith would be
> imperiled, and the stability of the entire fabric would
> be gravely endangered. Its prestige would suffer, the
> means required to enable it to take a long, and
> uninterrupted view over a series of generations would
> be completely lacking, and the necessary guidance to

> define the sphere of the legislative action of its elected
> representatives would be totally withdrawn. (WOB 148)
So the question is, did the ending of the Guardianship in
November 1957 have the negative effects described above, or
did the Cause survive this event complete and undamaged?

Shoghi Effendi definitely knew that the line of the Aghsán
would at some time come to an end. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas openly
contemplates this eventuality in the very paragraph (42) that
anticipates the Institution of the Guardianship. Further,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá makes no provision in His Will and Testament
for the continuation into the future of the Guardianship in the
event that the line of the Aghsán is extinguished. So it is very
clear that this passage in ‘Dispensation’ cannot be saying that
the Cause will be wounded or damaged unless there is an
unbroken line of living Guardians during the entirety of the
Dispensation. So, how are we to understand the paragraph?

When one looks at the paragraph that immediately follows
it, that is, the one that refers to the paralysis that would ensue
if the World Order were ‘severed’ from the House of Justice, it
is clear that Shoghi Effendi is simply describing, in dramatic
language, the centrality and vital importance of these two
institutions. Each, in turn, is anticipated to perform
indispensable and essential functions.

We therefore need to consider and analyze the various
points Shoghi Effendi has made and relate them to the period
of his ministry, considering what his absence would have
entailed. We set forth the points in brief, followed by
comments:
1\. Without the Guardianship, the World Order would be
deprived of the hereditary principle.

> COMMENT: The 36 years of the Guardianship
> certainly endowed the World Order with this
> eminent grace.
2\. Without the Guardianship, the World Order would have
been beset by peril and danger.

> COMMENT: If ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Will and
> Testament had not installed the Office of the
> Guardianship as His immediate Successor, Mírzá
> Muhammad-’Alí would have played havoc with the

> community, using the Book of the Covenant to
> advance his case.
3\. Without the Guardianship the prestige of the World
Order would have suffered.

> COMMENT: By making the Guardian the “sacred
> head” (WT 14) of the House of Justice, and because of
> the provision that the Guardian “cannot override the
> decisions” of the Universal House of Justice (WOB
> 150), ‘Abdu’l-Bahá enhanced the prestige of the
> Supreme Body (WOB 8).
4\. Without the Guardianship the World Order would not
have benefited from Shoghi Effendi’s breadth of vision.

> COMMENT: The Guardian’s book ‘God Passes By’
> provides an historical panorama covering the first
> one hundred years of Bahá’í history. Shoghi Effendi
> gives us an invaluable interpretation of this history
> and correlates it with the major events of the
> century. Thanks also to the Guardian’s World Order
> letters, his entrancing vision of the future, and the
> steps which would lead to its realization, have been
> fully laid out for us.
5\. Without the Guardianship the elected institutions of the

> Faith, locally, nationally and internationally, would have
been deprived of the Guardian’s guidance.

> COMMENT: As already indicated above, Shoghi
> Effendi gave his guidance for the formulation of
> National and Local Bahá’í Constitutions. As to the
> Constitution of the Universal House of Justice, in
> view of the provision that he “is debarred from laying
> down independently the constitution that must
> govern the organized activities of his fellow-
> members” (WOB 150), Shoghi Effendi made it clear in
> his ‘Dispensation’ that the two areas of authorized
> interpretation and binding legislation had been
> exclusively reserved to each of the two successive
> Successors of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, namely
> the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice
> respectively.

How Can the Universal House of Justice Determine That
its Enactments do Not Depart from the Spirit of the
Teachings?

The statement in the ‘Dispensation’ which gives rise to this
issue is the following:

> the Guardian…cannot override the decision of the
> majority of his fellow-members, but is bound to insist
> upon a reconsideration by them [members of the
> Universal House of Justice] of any enactment he
> conscientiously believes to conflict with the meaning
> or to depart from the spirit of Bahá’u’lláh’s revealed
> utterances. (WOB 150)
To understand adequately the implications of this
statement, we must first consider the meaning or meanings of
the word “enactment” or the word of which it is a derivative,
namely “enact”. According to the Webster dictionary the verb
“enact” is used when a “legal and authoritative act” is
performed. It also implies the act of passing a “bill” or a legal
draft into a law. It is obvious that in the sentence from the
“Dispensation” quoted above, the first meaning is meant,
because of the categorical statement, also in the same sentence,
clearly affirming that when a final decision is taken, the
Guardian “cannot override” or veto such a decision. Thus the
issue of reconsideration is a step to be taken in the process of
arriving at the final decision.

This issue has been dealt with in the Constitution of the
Universal House of Justice. In the absence of the Guardian, the
Universal House of Justice has formally stated that among its
“binding terms of reference” and the elements which constitute
“its bedrock foundation”, are the “interpretations and
expositions” of the Guardian. (CUHJ 4)

Furthermore in a letter dated 27 May 1966 the Universal
House of Justice assures us that “a careful study of the
Writings and interpretations on any subject on which the
House of Justice proposes to legislate always precedes its act
of legislation.” In the same letter the Universal House of
Justice makes this further clear affirmation: “the Universal
House of Justice, itself assured of divine guidance, is well
aware of the absence of the Guardian and will approach all
matters of legislation only when certain of its sphere of

jurisdiction, a sphere which the Guardian              confidently
described as ‘clearly defined’”. (MUHJ 85)

In the light of the above quotations, in my view, it should
not be difficult to arrive at the conclusion that Shoghi
Effendi’s statement in the ‘Dispensation’ could well be
understood as a reminder of, and indeed an emphasis on, the
imperative obligation to refer to his interpretations and
expositions prior to any act of legislation. This assurance has
been explicitly given to the Bahá’í World in the statements
quoted above from the writings of the Universal House of
Justice.

Wide Range of Responsibilities of the Office of Head-
ship, as Invested in the Universal House of Justice

Based on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s and Shoghi Effendi’s writings these
responsibilities include the following duties and powers:
1\. to safeguard the unity of the community (WOB 148)
2\.   to resolve all problems which have caused differences (WT

20)
3\.   to maintain the integrity of the Bahá’í teachings (WOB 148)
4\. to elucidate questions that are obscure (WT 20)
5\. to maintain the flexibility of the teachings of the Faith

(WOB 148)
6\. to promulgate and apply its laws (WOB 20 & 145)
7\. to protect its institutions (WOB 20)
8\. to adapt it loyally and intelligently to the requirements of

progressive society (WOB 20)
9\. to conduct all Bahá’í administrative affairs (WOB 153)
10\. to resolve difficult problems and all important and

fundamental questions (WT 14 & BA 47)
11\. to create new institutions (CC Vol. 1, 329)
12\. to make deductions from the sacred and authorized

writings (CC Vol. 1, 323)
13\. to launch and direct teaching plans (CC Vol. 1, 340)

14\.   to be the last refuge of a tottering civilization (WOB 89)
15\. to consummate the incorruptible inheritance which the
Founders of the Faith have bequeathed to the world (WOB

20)
As the Universal House of Justice is, after the Guardian, the
Central Authority in the Cause, the body unto which “all things
must be referred” (WT 14), it was able to create institutions to
ensure the “discharge of the functions of protection and
propagation” and to provide “for the receipt and disbursement
of the Huqúqu’lláh” (CUHJ 4).

The Constitution of the Universal House of Justice outlines
in five paragraphs what it considers to be “among the powers
and duties with which the Universal House of Justice has been
invested” (CUHJ 5). The contents of these paragraphs, without
any exception, are based on, and have their roots in, Tablets
revealed by Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, as well as letters of
Shoghi Effendi. They deal with the responsibilities of the
Supreme Institution in such matters as preserving the sacred
Texts, defending and protecting the Cause, proclaiming and
propagating its Message, advancing its interests, promoting
universal peace, ushering in the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh,
safeguarding the personal rights, freedom and initiative of
individuals, and promoting the advancement and betterment
of the world. The last three paragraphs also enumerate the
legislative, executive and judicial powers vested in the
institution of the House of Justice.

What does unconditional obedience imply?
Bahá’u’lláh in the thirteenth Glad-Tidings (Bishárát) wrote:

> The men of God’s House of Justice have been charged
> with the affairs of the people….Inasmuch as for each
> day there is a new problem and for every problem an
> expedient solution, such affairs should be referred to
> the Ministers of the House of Justice that they may act
> according to the needs and requirements of the time.
> They that, for the sake of God, arise to serve His
> Cause, are the recipients of divine inspiration from the
> unseen Kingdom. It is incumbent upon all to be
> obedient unto them. (TAB 26-27) (This self-same passage is
> repeated in the Eighth Ishráq.)

Furthermore in the Eighth Leaf of Paradise we read: “It is
incumbent upon the Trustees of the House of Justice to take
counsel together….God will verily inspire them with whatsoever
He willeth, and He, verily is the Provider, the Omniscient.” (TAB
68)

We note in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament His insistent
call to the friends to turn to the Universal House of Justice,
and obey its directives. We read the following: “the Universal
House of Justice, to be universally elected and established, [is]
under the care and protection of the Abhá Beauty, under the
shelter and unerring guidance of His Holiness, the Exalted One
[the Báb]….Whoso rebelleth …against them hath rebelled against
God…., whoso contendeth with them hath contended with
God” (WT 11). “That which this body….doth carry, that is verily
the Truth and the Purpose of God Himself. Whoso doth deviate
therefrom is verily of them that love discord, hath shown forth
malice and turned away from the Lord of the Covenant.” (WT
19-20)

In one of His Tablets ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has furthermore written
the following:

> The Supreme House of Justice will take decisions and
> establish laws through the inspiration and
> confirmation of the Holy Spirit, because it is in the
> safekeeping and under the shelter and protection of the
> Ancient Beauty, and obedience to its decisions is a
> bounden and essential duty and an absolute
> obligation, and there is no escape for anyone. (MUHJ 85)
To confirm the sense of the above passages we read in Shoghi
Effendi’s ‘Dispensation’, the following affirmation which
corroborates Bahá’u’lláh’s and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statements on
the inspiration and divine guidance which surround and
overshadow the decisions of the Universal House of Justice. He
writes: “the members of the Universal House of Justice, …and
not the body of those who either directly or indirectly elect
them, have thus been made the recipients of the divine guidance
which is at once the life-blood and ultimate safeguard of this
Revelation.” (WOB 153)

From these explicit and authoritative statements we should
know of a certainty that when divine inspiration is well-
assured, obedience becomes a spiritual obligation. This theme
is fully discussed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Some Answered
Questions:

> Know that infallibility is of two kinds: essential
> infallibility and acquired infallibility…. Essential
> infallibility is peculiar to the supreme Manifestation,
> for it is His essential requirement…. But acquired
> infallibility is not a natural necessity; on the contrary,
> it is a ray of the bounty of infallibility which shines
> from the Sun of Reality….Thus many of the holy
> beings….were the mediators of grace between God and
> men. If God did not protect them from error, their
> error would cause believing souls to fall into error, and
> thus the foundations of the Religion of God would be
> overturned, which would not be fitting nor worthy of
> God…
> … For instance, the Universal House of Justice …. will
> be under the protection and the unerring guidance of
> God….Now the members of the House of Justice have
> not, individually, essential infallibility, but the body
> of the House of Justice is under the protection and
> unerring guidance of God; this is called conferred
> infallibility. (SAQ 173)
This statement made by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explicitly and certainly
gives us the assurance that when an individual or institution,
authorized in revealed sacred texts as freed from error, renders
a decision or issues a directive requiring the friends to obey,
the community of the faithful should be confident that such a
decision or directive has been prompted and motivated by
divine inspiration. Should this be otherwise, it would not only
be unbecoming and unbefitting of a just God, but the result
would certainly be the subversion of the very foundations of
God’s Holy Faith.

The friends of course realize that the objectives specified in
the plans and messages of the Universal House of Justice are
designed to help us in our direct teaching work. To the extent
that we adhere to the wishes of the Supreme Body will we be the
recipients of added confirmations and blessings.
