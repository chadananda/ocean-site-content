         “Some Answered Questions”

and Its Compiler

Baharieh Rouhani Ma‘ani

A young American living in Paris at the turn of the twentieth
century had a life-changing experience. As a result, she was
steered in a direction utterly different from anything she and
her parents had in mind. Laura Clifford Barney was born in
1879 to Alice Pike and Albert Barney. At a very young age her
parents took her to Paris, where she studied at a prestigious
school for about nine years. In 1892 she returned to the United
States and entered Visitation, a Catholic Convent School in
Georgetown. She later returned to Paris, and studied philosophy
and religion. She was a bright and serious student with an active
and enquiring mind, keenly interested in discovering the
frontiers of knowledge. Her mother had established a salon in
Paris where artists and writers gathered. Laura “often attended
her mother’s circle of friends in the French Salon” and
“participated in the intellectual discussions among influential
writers and artists…” Her “serious questions often led to
insightful observations on the part of those present.”1

During her stay in Paris in early 1900, Laura heard of the
Bahá’í Faith and studied its tenets with May Eliss Bolles
(Maxwell), the renowned Bahá’í teacher. Heeding the voice of
her conscience, Laura embraced the nascent Faith and pursued a
lifelong career of service to humanity, which made her world

renown. This paper is about one of her most remarkable
achievements that have immortalized her name in the annals of
religion. Some Answered Questions is the descriptive title of
the book she has compiled of answers to the questions she
presented to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the eldest Son and Successor of
Bahá’u’lláh and the authorized Interpreter of His Writings. In a
cable sent to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of
France on the occasion of her passing in August 1974, the
Universal House of Justice, the Supreme governing body of the
Bahá’í Faith, said: “She achieved immortal fame through
compilation Some Answered Questions unique entire field
religious history.”

Asking Questions A Potent Means to Expand
the Horizon of Knowledge

Human beings have ever used the means of inquiry to unlock
the doors of understanding matters initially appearing beyond
their ability to comprehend. Thought-provoking questions
emanating from the minds of sincere seekers expand the
horizon of knowledge; enlightened answers widen the scope of
understanding abstruse concepts. The most opportune time for
asking questions is when God’s Mouthpiece and the authorized
interpreter of the revealed Word live among humankind. Many
of the Báb’s Writings have been revealed in response to
petitions. The declaration of His Mission to Mullá Óusayn
followed an exchange of questions and answers leading to the
revelation of commentary on the Súrih of Joseph, in response
to a question he considered to be the proof of the truth of His
Mission, if it were revealed unasked, which came to pass as he
had expected.

The Writings of Bahá’u’lláh revealed in response to petitions
are numerous. The Kitáb-i-ˆqán, the Book that “occupies a
position unequalled by any work in the entire range of Bahá’í
literature, except the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh’s Most Holy
Book” [GPB 139], has been revealed in response to questions He

Some Answered Questions and Its Compiler                         427

received from one of the Báb’s uncles. The process of the
revelation of the laws did likewise begin with enquiries received
from the believers early in Bahá’u’lláh’s ministry. It was during
the years of exile in Adrianople (Edirne of today), almost
immediately after His Declaration in Baghdad in 1863 that
Bahá’u’lláh permitted all to ask whatever questions they had
concerning laws and ordinances needed by humankind. The
responses were initially revealed in Persian. Later in ‘Akká, in
response to further requests, He revealed the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.2
Had the early believers not asked questions, the inexhaustible
reservoir of divine knowledge, although unsealed, would
probably not have been revealed in such pronounced measure.

Although the Báb had forbidden His followers “to ask
questions of Him Whom God will make manifest (Bahá’u’lláh)
unless their questions were submitted in writing and pertained
to subjects worthy of His lofty station” [KA note 146],
Bahá’u’lláh relieved them of the prohibition:

> In the Bayán it had been forbidden you to ask Us
> questions. The Lord hath relieved you of this
> prohibition, that ye may be free to ask what you need to
> ask, but not such idle questions as those on which the
> men of former times were wont to dwell. Ask ye that
> which shall be of profit to you in the Cause of God and
> His dominion, for the portals of His tender compassion
> have been opened before all who dwell in heaven and on
> earth. [KA π126]

Bahá’u’lláh continued to encourage the believers to ask
questions. In a Tablet revealed in honor of a believer titled
Vafá, He says:

> We have noted the Questions thou hast asked and will
> readily answer thee. It behoveth everyone in this Day to
> ask God that which he desireth, and thy Lord will heed
> his petition with wondrous and undeniable verses. [TB 183]
428                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

Some of Bahá’u’lláh’s major works published in English have
been revealed in response to questions. In addition to The
Kitáb-i-ˆqán (The Book of Certitude), they include: The Seven
Valleys and the Four Valleys, Javáhiru’l-Asrár (The Gems of
Divine Mysteries); Law˙-i-Óikmat (Tablet of Wisdom); Súriy-i-
Vafá (Tablet to Vafá); Law˙-i-Siyyid-i-Mihdíy-i-Dahají (Tablet
to Siyyid Mihdíy-i-Dahají); Law˙-i-Mánikchí Íá˙ib (Tablet to
Mánikchí Íá˙ib); Responses to questions of Mánikchí Íá˙ib
from a Tablet to Mírzá Abu’l-Fa∂l; Tablet of the Seven
Questions. In addition to these titles, Shoghi Effendi has
included in Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh some
Tablets or excerpts thereof revealed in response to questions.

Some of Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablets have been published as
provisional translations, such as Law˙-i-Kullu’†-ˇa`ám (Tablet
of All Foods), Law˙-i-ˇibb (Tablet to the Physician), and
others. These Tablets can be found in some Bahá’í journals.

Numerous other Tablets revealed in Persian and Arabic, as
yet un-translated, have also been revealed in response to
questions. Bahá’u’lláh particularly encouraged the friends to ask
questions about the laws of the new dispensation almost
immediately after His declaration in April 1863. In Adrianople
(Edirne) He revealed some laws in response to a number of
questions. Later in ‘Akká the Kitáb-i-Aqdas was revealed, which
incorporates the laws revealed in Adrianople. After the
revelation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Jináb-i-Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín
was authorized to submit questions concerning the laws. The
treatise, titled Questions & Answers, an appendix to the Kitáb-
i-Aqdas, is a compilation he made of Bahá’u’lláh’s answers to
questions concerning the laws of the Most Holy Book.

The practice of responding to questions continued during
the ministry of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. When the light of Bahá’u’lláh’s
revelation moved westward and illumined North America, the
new adherents’ access to the vast ocean of Bahá’u’lláh’s
writings was confined to drops, because material translated to
English was scarce, indeed. The scarcity caused them to turn to

Some Answered Questions and Its Compiler                     429

‘Abdu’l-Bahá for answers to questions occupying their minds.
One of the newly enrolled believers, a young woman of twenty-
one with an active and enquiring mind was Laura Clifford
Barney, who after marriage with Hippolyte Dreyfus, became
known as Madam Laura Dreyfus-Barney. The answers she
received to her numerous questions were of such inestimable
value that with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s approval, she compiled them
into a book, titled Some Answered Questions.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the infallible Interpreter of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Writings and His Successor, received and answered countless
questions concerning various aspects of His Father’s revelation.
The responses to these questions are contained in many volumes
of His Writings; in Farsi they usually bear the title Makatíb, in
English they were originally known as Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
Those retranslated have been published in Selections from the
Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Some Answered Questions is a
compilation devoted in its entirety to the questions presented
to Him by Laura Clifford Barney and of answers He revealed in
response.

The process of asking questions and being enlightened by
answers from infallible sources of guidance has been ongoing
since the ascension of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Shoghi Effendi, the
Guardian of the Cause of God (1921-1957) received and
answered questions from individual Bahá’ís and institutions
throughout the world. Some National Assemblies have compiled
and published the answers to questions from their respective
communities. The Universal House of Justice, the supreme
governing body of the Bahá’í Faith, has likewise received and
answered questions ever since its inception in April 1963. Many
volumes containing its messages have been published in Persian
and English; many of the messages are in response to questions.
A good source of reference for messages issued by Shoghi
Effendi and the Universal House of Justice in response to
questions is Lights of Guidance.

A more detailed survey of Bahá’í writings in response to
questions is a theme worthy of further exploration. The
purpose of this brief explanation is to highlight the importance
of asking intelligent questions, the answers to which expand the
horizon of knowledge.

Questions & Answers and Some Answered
Questions — Similarities and Differences

Among a multitude of titles containing Bahá’í Sacred
Writings two are devoted entirely to authoritative answers to
questions: The first is titled Questions & Answers, the second
Some Answered Questions. The first is a document comprising
exclusively of answers Bahá’u’lláh revealed in response to
questions about the laws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. It is by nature
of small size and regarded an appendix to the Most Holy Book.
Its compiler is Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín, one of the erudite, devoted
and trusted followers of Bahá’u’lláh. He was a mujtahid
(specialized in Islamic jurisprudence) before embracing the Bábí
and Bahá’í Faiths. Bahá’u’lláh authorized him not only to ask
questions about the laws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, but also to
compile Risálih-i-Su’ál va Javáb (Questions & Answers).

The second, Some Answered Questions consists entirely of
answers ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gave to scores of questions on a variety
of subjects from Laura Clifford Barney. The circumstances
surrounding the compilation of Some Answered Questions
were very different from those leading to Questions &
Answers: Unlike Questions & Answers, which was compiled
before the Bahá’í Faith had spread to the western hemisphere,
Some Answered Questions took shape when the Cause of
Bahá’u’lláh had reached the shores of North America and spread
to parts of Europe. Many westerners, who had embraced the
Bahá’í Faith made their way to the Holy Land, to attain the
presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Centre of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant
and the authorized Interpreter of His Writings. Laura Clifford
Barney was one of them.

Some Answered Questions and Its Compiler                       431

Meeting ‘Abdu’l-Bahá shortly after she had embraced the
Bahá’í Faith in Paris confirmed Laura Barney in the belief that
He was the living embodiment of divine wisdom and the
inexhaustible source of true knowledge, the Person to Whom
she could turn for convincing answers to her unanswered
questions. To gain a deeper understanding of the subjects that
fascinated her mind, she wasted no time in presenting questions
to Him, begging for answers. Recognizing her insatiable quest
for knowledge and understanding, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá patiently
nurtured her inquiring mind and responded to her questions
with supreme compassion. However, His tasks were many and
time for answering questions was extremely tight.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s decision to respond to Laura Barney’s
questions when she was present in ‘Akká seems to have been
prompted by other considerations: Laura initially had no
knowledge of Persian or Arabic; she spoke English and French.
It was of crucial importance to the success of the undertaking
for the interpreter to understand and translate her questions
accurately. The interpreter had to also convey precisely
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s response. Any difficulty in understanding the
question or conveying the answer could be rectified speedily
when it was done in person. Another major concern was the
slowness and unreliability of the postal service during those
difficult times in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ministry, when His internal
and external enemies liked nothing better than seeing Him
completely annihilated. They colluded to ensure the success of
their schemes, which appeared successful when He was
incarcerated in the early years of the twentieth century. He was
under surveillance, His communications were censored and His
life threatened. It was at a time like this, so fraught with danger
that Laura Barney’s quest for deeper knowledge was addressed.
However, every precaution had to be taken to avoid placing in
the hand of the enemy pretexts for adding to the stringent
restrictions in force. In person communication proved
invaluable; it avoided the pitfalls of communication by mail, at
the same time it made clear that no earthly force could hamper

432                                         Lights of Irfán vol. 18

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s will to move the Cause of God forward. With
His permission, she presented her questions to Him in person
and arranged for His answers to be recorded.

One major difference between Questions & Answers and
Some Answered Questions is that in the case of Questions &
Answers, questions were submitted in writing, answers were
likewise revealed in writing. Some Answered Questions
comprises responses to questions presented in person but
recorded as they were uttered. To ensure authenticity, before
Some Answered Questions was published, the responses were
reviewed and approved by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Laura Barney outlines
how the process began and moved forward: “While I desired
from the very beginning that the Master’s utterances be
recorded in Persian, it was only when the Master mentioned
that at some time these transcripts would have to be reviewed
and corrected, that He made the decision that His utterances be
also recorded in Persian.” She adds: “... the Master not only
corrected Mírzá Munír’s first draft,3 but after the corrections
were incorporated ‘Abdu’l-Bahá again reviewed the corrected
version and signed each corrected subject.”4

Unlike Some Answered Questions, which was published
immediately after it was approved by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the text of
Questions & Answers, though compiled during Bahá’u’lláh’s
ministry, remained unpublished until 1910. Its English
translation was published together with the authorized English
translation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in 1992. The reason for the
delay in the publication of Questions & Answers was the
necessity for Bahá’u’lláh’s Book of Laws to be translated and
annotated under the aegis of the Universal House of Justice.
Without the Book, the appendix would have had no source of
reference.

Although Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín and Laura Clifford Barney
enjoy the honor of being the compilers of Questions &
Answers and Some Answered Questions respectively, some
differences set them apart: Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín was a man from

Some Answered Questions and Its Compiler                       433

Iran, the state religion of which has been Islam for centuries.
He was well versed in Islamic jurisprudence. Laura Barney did
not belong to a religious class. She was an emancipated young
woman raised in the cradle of liberation. As stated earlier,
Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín was authorized to present questions in
writing to Bahá’u’lláh exclusively about the laws of the Kitáb-i-
Aqdas, Laura Barney enjoyed the opportunity to present
questions to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on subjects of her choice. She also
enjoyed the permission to arrange for the publication and
dissemination of Some Answered Questions in two languages
almost immediately after it was compiled, while Questions &
Answers took more than two decades to be published in Persian
and much longer to be published in English and other languages.
Unlike Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín, Laura Barney had no familiarity
with Persian and/or Arabic when she set foot on the path of
search, yet her “imperishable service”, as Shoghi Effendi, the
Guardian of the Cause of God, says,

> was to collect and transmit to posterity in the form of
> “Some Answered Questions,” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s priceless
> explanations, covering a wide variety of subjects, given
> to her in the course of an extended pilgrimage to the
> Holy Land, and undertook the complex task of
> compiling the book. [GPB 260]

The Compiler of Some Answered Questions

From among the early western believers Laura Clifford
Barney was most qualified to undertake the compilation of
Some Answered Questions. Not only did she have scholastic
qualifications and intellectual maturity for undertaking the
task, but also possessed the inherent qualities needed to
successfully accomplish the goal. Additionally, she had the
means to have the compilation published in a befitting manner
in Persian and English, and disseminated internationally. To
accomplish her objective, she made repeated visits to ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and persevered until the daunting task was complete.

434                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

Learning was her lifelong objective. When a question occupied
her mind she enthusiastically pursued the path of search until
she found the answer. She was both meticulous and methodic in
her work. Above all she was a dedicated believer and utterly
devoted to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, she had complete faith in Him as the
Centre of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant and the authorized
Interpreter of His Writings. When she was unsure about the
accuracy of a piece of information, she sought clarification.
Before publishing the book, she did her utmost to ensure that
every detail was checked carefully and highest standards were
observed.

The process of asking questions probably started with Laura
Barney submitting them in writing. Soon it became clear that
the scope of her endeavor and the complexities involved made
it most difficult, if not impossible, to carry out the work
through correspondence. Also, with the heavy responsibilities
‘Abdu’l-Bahá shouldered and the little time He had available to
achieve so much, expounding on Laura Barney’s complex
questions could be achieved efficiently and with speed if she
were present in ‘Akká. Therefore, she received permission to
present her questions in person. Being in the presence of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá while He responded to her questions proved of
crucial importance, because it provided her with the
opportunity to pay careful attention to the answers as they
were uttered, and could seek clarification if the interpreters did
not convey the response clearly, or if she had difficulty
understanding the concept.

To reach the Holy Land, which was part of the Ottoman
Empire at the time, the western pilgrims travelled to France,
whence to Egypt and the Holy Land, where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and
his family continued to live as exiles after Bahá’u’lláh ascended
to the Celestial Realm. The pilgrims waited in Egypt until called
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Since restrictions were in place, only a few
could visit Him at a time. As a result, the pilgrims were
afforded the opportunity to get to know the Bahá’ís residing in
Egypt, the most prominent of whom was Mírzá Abu’l-Fa∂l. The

opportunity was priceless: The pilgrims not only recovered
from the rigors of travel but also used the time to prepare
themselves spiritually for the realization of their long-awaited
dream; their visit to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Center of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Covenant. Mírzá Abu’l-Fa∂l was available to answer their
questions and help them prepare for the sanctity of the
experience they were about to witness. The person who made
the most of her stay in Egypt and gathered many a priceless gem
from Mírzá Abu’l-Fa∂l’s treasury of knowledge was Laura
Barney. Encouraged by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, she never failed to
consult him when she needed sound advice. Seeing her vast
capacity for acquiring knowledge, Mírzá Abu’l-Fa∂l
unhesitatingly tutored and deepened her understanding of
Bahá’í history and teachings. He was her beloved teacher, the
person she appreciated for his rare qualities of knowledge,
wisdom, humility and generosity of heart and mind. To show
her appreciation for his assistance, while he was alive,5 she
never failed to help him in spreading the light of the knowledge
of the Faith among humankind. She financed the publication of
some of his writings in English. She also paid for his trip to and
sojourn in Paris for about three and a half months, she likewise
financed his trip to and stay in the United States lasting over
three years.

Never before in a religious dispensation had a woman the
opportunity to submit a wide range of questions to an infallible
Centre of Authority and receive His detailed and authoritative
answers. In addition to the questions Laura Barney asked in
person, she submitted questions in the missives she sent to
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. A few Tablets revealed in her honor, which have
been published, confirm this. One case in point is the Tablet
revealed in response to her question about the institution of
Mashriqu’l-Adhkár, another is about the wisdom of burying the
dead.

Laura Barney gave careful consideration to the nature of
questions she asked, also to the organization of the material she
compiled. According to Stockman, “The book explored eighty-

436                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

four questions covering such subjects as “The Resurrection of
Christ’, ‘The Holy Spirit’, ‘The trinity’, ‘Predestination’,
Modification of Species’, ‘The Progress of Man in the Other
World’, Healing by Spiritual Means’, ‘The Influence of the
Stars’ and Strikes’. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was also asked to comment on
specific verses in Revelation and Isaiah and to describe the
missions of Abraham, Moses and Jesus.”6 In her preface to the
book, Laura Barney explains how the book came about:

> During my several visits to ‘Akká, these answers were
> written down in Persian while ‘Abdul-Bahá spoke, not
> with a view to publication, but simply that I might have
> them for future study ... In these lessons He is the
> teacher adapting Himself to His pupil, and not the
> orator or poet.
> This book presents only certain aspects of the Bahá’í
> Faith, which is universal in its message and has for each
> questioner the answer suited to his special development
> and needs.
> In my case the teachings were made simple, to correspond
> to my rudimentary knowledge, and are therefore in no
> way complete and exhaustive ... [SAQ 2014, xix]

Describing the organization of the contents of Some
Answered Questions, Laura Barney says: “Originally they were
not given in any special order, but have now been roughly
classified for the convenience of the reader.” She confirms the
addition of a Table of Contents “merely to indicate the subjects
treated of”, adds that the Persian text has been closely followed
and that “many of the Persian and Arabic names have been
written in their simplest form without strictly adhering to a
scientific system which would be confusing to the average
reader” [SAQ xx].

Living in Paris, a city far closer to the Holy Land
geographically than any part of the United States, was a great
advantage. It afforded Laura Barney repeated trips to and from

Egypt with relative ease and speed. She then traversed the
distance between Port Sa`id and Holy Land in a relatively short
time. The means of transport were in those days by sea. Her
flexibility made it possible for her to go at short notice and
stay for as long as it was possible and prudent. She was ecstatic
and truly grateful for whatever time she was allowed to spend
close to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and His family. When she was not busy
formulating questions, presenting them, listening and recording
the answers, organizing her work and studying the Faith with
the holy family, she was able to learn Persian, which ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá encouraged her to do.

Learning Persian proved helpful in enhancing Laura Barney’s
understanding of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s utterances. She also taught
English and French to the daughters of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
particularly Rú˙á Khánum and Munavar Khánum, the youngest
two.

Laura Barney’s visits were of varying duration, at times
extended to many months. Between 1900 and 1908 she visited
‘Abdu’l-Bahá several times. According to H.M. Balyuzi, it was
during her “repeated and extended visits to the Holy Land …
during those months, stretched over several years, that a book
unique in the entire range of the Writings of the Founders of
the Faith took shape. The book was Some Answered Questions.
Questions came from Laura Barney and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá answered
them.”7 Laura Barney presented her questions when ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá had time to spare, invariably at mealtime. His response
was translated on the spot by a resident Bahá’í proficient in
both English and Persian.

To record the answers in English, initially Laura Barney made
notes. Later she was allowed to bring with her a stenographer.
On her visit to ‘Akká in 1904 she was accompanied by Ms.
Ethel Rosenberg, an English Bahá’í, who recorded on the spot
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s translated explanations. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s answers
were also recorded in Persian for the benefit of the members of
the family who were not present at the table.8 Afrukhtih, one of

438                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

the interpreters, explains that Mírzá Munír, the son of Mírzá
Mu˙ammad-Qulí, the faithful half-brother of Bahá’u’lláh, was
assigned the task.9 The Foreword to the latest revised edition of
Some Answered Questions prepared at the Bahá’í World Centre
states:

> Arrangements were made for one of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
> sons-in-law, or for one of His three secretaries of that
> time, to take down in Persian the text of His replies.
> From the resulting collection of notes a selection was
> made; ‘Abdu’l-Bahá then corrected these notes twice in
> His own hand, sometimes substantially revising them in
> the process as well as carefully reviewing the final
> wording. [SAQ 2014, xii]

Laure Barney herself prepared the English translation of
Some Answered Questions on the basis of the approved Persian
text. The descriptive title was carefully selected and approved
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. In the preface to the first English edition,
published in 1908 she explains the conditions under which
‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded to her questions:

> “I HAVE GIVEN TO you my tired moments,” were the
> words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as He rose from table after
> answering one of my questions.
> As it was on this day, so it continued; between the hours
> of work, His fatigue would find relief in renewed
> activity; occasionally He was able to speak at length;
> but often, even though subject might require more time,
> He would be called away after a few moments; again,
> days and even weeks would pass, in which He had no
> opportunity of instructing me. But I could well be
> patient, for I had always before me the greater lesson —
> the lesson of His personal life. [SAQ xix]

The 1904 visit of Laura Barney and Ethel Rosenberg
coincided with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s re-incarceration. The strict

conditions imposed on Bahá’u’lláh and His family after their
arrival in ‘Akká in 1868 had eased over the years affording them
some freedom of movement. The relaxation of the stringent
restrictions had made it possible for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to meet with
western pilgrims in small groups and to initiate the
construction of the Shrine of the Báb on Mount Carmel. After
Bahá’u’lláh’s ascension, Mírzá Mu˙ammad ‘Alí, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
half-brother, unhappy with the provisions of his Father’s Book
of the Covenant, which bestowed upon him a station beneath
that of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, started a campaign to discredit Him.
Mírzá Mu˙ammad ‘Alí’s constant agitation and baseless
accusations against ‘Abdu’l-Bahá resulted in the dispatch of a
commission of enquiry by the central government, which
resulted in the re-imposition of restrictions on Him. One of the
affected areas was the number of visitors He could receive, not
more than a few at a time. That Laura Barney and Ms.
Rosenberg visited Him at that time was in itself an
extraordinary event. The purpose of the visit was for Laura to
present her questions to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in person and for Ms.
Rosenberg to have His translated responses recorded in English.
During their prolonged stay, they lived in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
House,10 and enjoyed the incomparable blessing that living with
the members of His family, particularly the Greatest Holy Leaf,
afforded them. The visit extended over many months.

Living in the rarefied atmosphere of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s House
accentuated the spiritual susceptibilities of the person who had
come with a mind surging with questions. In His presence, her
power of absorption and reflection were most intense.
Deprived of these blessings, it would have been most difficult
for Laura Barney to accomplish what she did. During her 1904
visit, she was inspired to make available to others, who did not
have the priceless opportunity of hearing from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
lips answers to the questions she was privileged to put before
Him. It was at that time that arrangements were made for
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s responses in Persian to be recorded for the
benefit of those who could not be there in person. This text

440                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

was later corrected and signed by Him, as stated earlier in this
account.

Laura’s knowledge of history and scripture, also her
familiarity with topics of interest to intellectuals of the time
made her an ideal person to formulate questions for
presentation to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Her organizational ability and
meticulous pursuance of tasks at hand were assets she employed
with great success. Never did she lose sight of what she wanted
to ask, ever was she ready for the opportunity to present her
questions and imbibe His answers. Fully aware of the unique
honor ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had graciously bestowed on her and of the
preciousness of the moments He spared to answer her questions
made Laura Barney all the more attentive and committed to her
work. In the process she also learned the value of patience, not
one of her intrinsic characteristics. In addition to the many
questions her active mind formulated, a few probably came
from other believers who submitted their questions through
her.

Laura Barney loved life near ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and preferred a
place like ‘Akká, a penal colony with its harsh environment to a
life of luxury and comfort, to which she was used. During her
visits, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded with loving kindness to the
questions she presented to Him at the dining table, the only
time He could spare to respond to her questions. At the table,
in addition to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the interpreter, Laura Barney and
Ms. Rosenberg, were usually seated several pilgrims and
resident believers. In consideration of traditional Middle-
Eastern practices, female members of the holy family did not
eat with the men if they were not close relatives. Therefore, one
of the resident Bahá’ís versed in English, often Youness Khán
Afroukhteh, served as interpreter. But when the family gathered
at breakfast and only female western pilgrims were present,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s youngest daughters, Rouha Khánum and
Munavar Khánum served as interpreters. It seems that they
helped also with interpretation at the table when male pilgrims
and resident Bahá’ís were not present.

Afroukhteh says the members of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s family
“realized that if Miss Barney had not immersed herself in the
depths of this divine Ocean, those precious gems would have
remained undiscovered forever; those heavenly jewels would
have been left concealed in the depths of the storehouse of
meanings. And now that these hidden gems had come to light,
what could be better than to record them in the Persian
language so that they might remain intact and inviolate for
posterity in the annals of the Faith. So they asked ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
to assign an amanuensis to attend the meetings and take down
in Persian each and every gem-like word.” He adds that ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá approved the request and “Mírzá Munír, son of the
departed Mírzá Mu˙ammad-Qulí was assigned the task...”11
Afroukhteh says later in his book: “I was not aware that Miss
Barney had desired a Persian compilation of the book from the
outset.”12

When in ‘Akká, Laura Barney lived in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s House
and spent considerable time associating with the ladies of the
Holy Family and deepening her understanding of the verities of
the Faith. Afroukhteh says: “During her one year stay, she not
only became familiar with the fundamental principles and
mysteries of the Cause of God but also emerged as a source for
the diffusion of these divine blessings among the people.”13

Laura Barney’s recognition of the One Whose innate
knowledge provided infallible answers to whatever puzzled her
mind was key to her success in seeing to completion the task she
had undertaken. Many were the pilgrims who attained ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s presence. Some asked questions, many did not. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá was most generous in giving of His time to meet them and
respond to their entreaties. Even non-Bahá’ís who sought His
presence were not turned away; they were accommodated with
utmost kindness. Myron Phelps is an example. But none
achieved what Laura Barney accomplished. She sought and
received permission to ask numerous questions, hear the
answers and arrange for them to be recorded. “As a result of
Laura Barney’s probings, answers to many questions of eternal

442                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

significance, as well as those reflecting a Western or Christian
orientation, became a part of the Bahá’í sacred writings. The
book has always been one of the most popular Bahá’í texts.”14
Speaking of the manner the book came to be, Stockman says:

> … Laura Barney, a Persian-speaking American Bahá’í,
> frequently visited ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in ‘Akká and asked Him
> questions about the Faith, often over the dinner table —
> much to the exasperation of the Persians present, who
> were not used to anyone, let alone a woman, closely
> questioning ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Barney took extensive notes
> which were informally circulated. Eventually ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá read, modified and approved her notes of His
> replies and gave her permission to publish them. Because
> He had approved the exact wording in the original
> Persian, the book became a part of Bahá’í scripture.15

Were one to enumerate outstanding attributes in a person
singled out to be the recipient of the bounty bestowed on Laura
Barney, top on the list would be: Utter dedication to the Centre
of the Covenant, an inquisitive mind, sound knowledge of
scripture and history, familiarity with issues current in early
twentieth century, perseverance, meticulousness, keen interest,
mature understanding, flexibility, patience and gratitude. Laura
appreciated the value of the honor vouchsafed to her and did
her utmost to accomplish the task to the best of her ability.
Nonetheless, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s gracious approval of her
undertaking to turn the outcome of her incessant probing, at a
time when He was beset by incalculable difficulties, into a book
for future generations to benefit from is the single most
important element in eternalizing her name in the annals of the
Bahá’í Faith. Concerning the circumstances surrounding
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s life when He answered Laura Barney’s questions,
Balyuzi says:

> Weighed down with the oppression of the times; facing
> hostile officials resolved to destroy Him — officials

> dispatched under the guise of a ‘Commission of
> Enquiry’ from the seat of Ottoman autocracy, ‘the
> Enquiry’ set afoot by the treachery of His own kith and
> kin; baulked momentarily in the greatest enterprise He
> had undertaken — raising the mausoleum of the Báb on
> Mount Carmel; every minute of the life of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
> was filled with sorrow demanding vigilant action and
> unflinching fortitude. Such were the moments that He
> gave to Laura Clifford Barney as she sought knowledge
> and understanding.16

Laura Barney initially had no intention of publishing the text
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s answers to her questions. However, realizing
the value of the answers to others, she sought His permission to
publish the material:

> ... these answers were written down in Persian while
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke, not with a view to publication, but
> simply that I might have them for future study .... But I
> believe that what has been so valuable to me may be of
> use to others, since all men, notwithstanding their
> differences, are united in their search for reality; and I
> have therefore asked ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s permission to
> publish these talks. [SAQ xix]

When permission was granted, Laura Barney carefully
checked the contents against the original words spoken by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. “The Persian text has been closely followed, at
times even to the detriment of the English, a few alterations
being made in the translation merely where the literal rendering
seemed too involved and obscure …” [SAQ xx]

To make the collected material accessible to all, Laura Barney
herself arranged for its publication in English. The choice of a
befitting and descriptive title for the book was important.
Laura Barney received ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s approval for it to be
called Some Answered Questions. The original Persian was
titled Al-Núru’l-Abhá fi Mufavi∂áti-‘Abdu’l-Bahá. While

444                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

arrangements were being made for the publication of the book
in Persian and English, Hippolyte Dreyfus, a distinguished
French lawyer, who had become a Bahá’í in Paris in early 1901
and later married Laura Barney, translated it to French. The
French translation under the title Les Leçons de Saint Jean-
d’Acre was published about the time the English translation and
Persian original were published.

Laura Barney was an active promoter of the Cause of
Bahá’u’lláh, especially among the elite class in whose circle she
moved and with whom she had close contact. She travelled
widely to spread the teachings of the Blessed Beauty,
particularly the principles of the oneness of humankind and
international peace. Her international travels began with a trip
to Russian Turkistan, the Turkmenistan of today, and Iran in
the summer of 1906. She was on that trip accompanied by
Marianne Jerard and Hippolyte Dreyfus. While in Iran, she
witnessed the disturbances associated with the constitutional
revolution, which had reached its climax that summer. After
marriage with Hippolyte Dreyfus in April 1911, together they
made a trip to the Far East in 1914. It coincided with World
War I, forcing them to cut short their trip and return to
France, where Hippolyte served in the army and Laura rendered
invaluable service to the wounded soldiers. The War made her
all the more conscious of the pivotal need of international
peace. According to Dr. Giachery,

> At the end of that global conflict she placed her faith in
> the League of Nations and represented the International
> Council of Women in that body, playing an important
> role in cultural exchange. She was the only woman
> named by the League Council to sit on the Sub-
> Committee of experts on Education, a post which she
> held for many years, beginning in 1926. On 23 July 1925
> she was appointed Chevalier de la Legion d’Honneur. In
> that same year she formed under the aegis of the League
> of Nations the ‘Liaison Committee of Major

> International Organizations to promote through
> Education better Understanding between Peoples and
> Classes’ and became a permanent member of the
> committee as well as its liaison officer. In 1934 she
> became a member of the Advisory Committee of the
> League of Nations on Teaching; she was also a member
> of the French Committee on Intellectual Co-operation.17

Laura and Hippolyte made another trip to the Far East and
Southeast Asia in 1921. It lasted several months and culminated
in the spread of Bahá’u’lláh’s redeeming message to places never
reached before. They were in Burma when the news of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s ascension reached them. They were among the individual
believers Shoghi Effendi invited to gather in Haifa for
consultation.18

Laura Barney carried out successfully the assignments
‘Abdu’l-Bahá entrusted to her. One can imagine there were
many. She travelled extensively and lectured eloquently “on the
impelling necessity of a united world. She was a true pioneer in
this field of activity at a time when the world was still
geographically and politically divided and quite insensible to the
call of spiritual unity. Her enthusiasm for this ideal never
lessened”, says Dr. Giachery.19 Her devoted services won her the
unique title of Amatu’l-Bahá (Handmaid of Bahá). She is the
only western female believer so designated by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.20
Vast and illuminating as her Bahá’í services, international
travels, undertakings and generous contributions to various
projects have been, what has made her a unique personality
among the Bahá’ís of renown is her probing mind, a crucial
element in the successful completion of Some Answered
Questions.

Laura Barney made many trips to ‘Akká before Some
Answered Questions was published. In her letter to Youness
Khán, she provides first-hand information about her trips to
the Holy Land during ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ministry and about the
manner Some Answered Questions was compiled and published.

446                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

In it she clarifies that “[t]he English and French editions were
translated directly from the final Persian text corrected by the
Master himself.” She also indicates that “the Master not only
corrected the first draft made at a certain period by Mírzá
Monir (Munír), but afterwards it was copied out and re-read by
Abdu’l Bahá who corrected and signed each one of these Talks.”
She also says:

> … it was on my third visit to Akká that I arrived with
> Miss Rosenberg. I spent the winter of 1904 there. I
> visited Egypt briefly and in the spring of 1905 paid a
> visit to my mother, after which we both returned to the
> Holy Land. I left again in the midsummer of 1905,
> returning to ‘Akká in the fall of that year. I spent a part
> of the winter in Cairo and returned to ‘Akká and Haifa
> by the end of spring. After that summer, I journeyed to
> Iran and then came back to Europe, and in the fall
> returned to ‘Akká. On my return, Some Answered
> Questions had been corrected and permission had been
> granted for its publication.
> The following year, the Persian version as well as the
> English and French versions of the book were published
> and distributed. In the second edition of the book two
> additional subjects were added.21

Laura Barney supervised the preparation of the text in
English and Persian. She personally selected publishers for both
editions, which came out in 1908. The French translation of the
book was also published the same year.

The publication of Some Answered Questions coincided
with the year the Young Turks revolution forced the Ottoman
authorities to free political prisoners. As a result, the strict
restrictions on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s life were lifted. Laura Barney
returned to Haifa in 1908. This visit was different from her
previous trips to the Holy Land. Not only did she celebrate the

accomplishment of the formidable task, but also the freedom
that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had been denied for so long.

Dissemination of Some Answered Questions

In the early years of the twentieth century when Some
Answered Questions was published, marketing techniques were
as yet undeveloped compared with what they are today. To
disseminate the book widely, Laura Barney had copies mailed to
major newspapers and to places where the light of the Faith had
spread. This step was crucial if the book was to help the
teaching work. The popularity of the book can be measured by
the number of times it has been republished. After its
publication in 1908, a US edition was published in 1918,
republished in 1930, 1954, 1964 and 1981. The first pocketsize
edition was published in 1984, reprinted in 2011. The book has
undergone revisions authorized by the Universal House of
Justice. The last revision was by a Committee at the Bahá’í
World Centre in 2014.

The publication of Some Answered Questions in Persian and
two popular languages of the time, as well as its wide
dissemination among the believers, notabilities familiar with
the Faith, and through important newspapers in America,
England, France and India was the first large scale publicity of
its kind that the Bahá’í Faith enjoyed early in its history. The
book informed a significant segment of the world’s population
of the views of the Centre of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant and the
authorized interpreter of His writings on subjects that
occupied their minds. It also enlightened and enthused the
Bahá’ís at a time when available Bahá’í writings in English and
French were scarce, providing those unfamiliar with the Faith
with authentic information on a variety of topics.

A prominent Persian figure, to whom Laura had sent a copy
of Some Answered Questions was Mu˙ammad-Valí Khán,
Sipahdar-i-A‘zam. When Mu˙ammad-‘Alí Sháh was deposed and
his eldest son Sultan A˙mad Mírzá installed on the Iranian

448                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

throne, Sipahdar-i-A‘zam “became the first prime minister of
the restored constitutional regime.”22 He was forced to resign
in 1911, when the abortive attempt of Mu˙ammad-‘Alí Sháh to
win back the throne took place. According to Balyuzi,

> [H]e was in Paris in March, at the time when ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá was still visiting the French capital. Either then, or
> possibly sometime earlier, Mme Laura Dreyfus-Barney
> had presented to him a copy of the Persian version of
> Some Answered Questions by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. One day
> Sipahdar-i-A‘zam opened the book to read the story of
> Badí`, and as he read he recalled an incident of his early
> youth, and wrote his recollections in the margin.23

The notes written in Persian describe how Badí` delivered the
Tablet revealed by Bahá’u’lláh to Náßiri’d-Dín Sháh and how
brutally he was put to death in the summer resort of Lar in
Mazandaran, where the Sháh was on a hunting expedition. The
Sipahdar explains how he heard the account and gives the name
of the man in charge of torturing Badí`, to force him disclose
information about the Bahá’ís he knew in Tihran. When
nothing worked, including the use of bastinado and beating,
even branding, his head was smashed with a pounder. The
Sipahdar’s note of 2 March 1913 in the margin of page 39 of
the Persian version of Some Answered Questions reads:

> Tonight I could not sleep. Mme Dreyfus had sent me
> this book and I had not yet read it. It is early morning. I
> opened the book and read on till I reached the theme of
> Letters to the Kings, and to Náßiri’d-Dín Sháh. Because
> I had been there on that journey and had heard this
> account personally from Kázim Khán-i-Farrásh-Báshí, I
> wrote it down.
> A year and a half later, on the journey to Karbila, this
> Kázim Khán went mad. The Sháh had him chained and
> he died miserably. The year I went to Tabriz, as the
> Governor-General of Adharbayjan, I found a grandson

> of his, begging. ‘Take heed, O people of insight and
> understanding.”24

In a Tablet revealed in honor of Laura Dreyfus-Barney over a
decade after Some Answered Questions had been first
published, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that He always awaited receiving
her joyous news indicating that she was holding in her hand
Some Answered Questions and using its proofs and arguments
to stir and enthuse the friends and handmaids of the Merciful
and generating fervor among them, for she had been singled out
for the honor, He said.25

Laura Barney continued to ask questions after the
publication of Some Answered Questions. Some of her
questions were in writing, in response to which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
revealed Tablets. One case in point is her question about
strikes, the response to which was included in the second
edition of Some Answered Questions. Another is her question
about the institution of Mashriqu’l-Adhkár.

The Fate of the Persian Original of Some
Answered Questions

Fully cognizant of the inestimable value of the Persian
original of Some Answered Questions, corrected and signed by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Laura made a conscious decision to send it to
Shoghi Effendi. In her letter of Aug. 7th, 1937 to Youness Khán
Afroukhteh, she conveys this crucial piece of information:
“Last winter I had Mrs. Angiz Khánum Tabrizi deliver to
Shoghi Effendi the final draft of the book as corrected and
signed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.”26 She had in her possession a treasure
trove of precious items. She had been in the presence of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá during the difficult early years of the twentieth
century, had compiled Some Answered Questions during those
perilous years and kept with her the documentation. She had
other papers of historical value. About three years before
World War II broke out, she felt moved to send the items to

450                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

Shoghi Effendi rather than keeping them in Paris. As a result of
her timely action before the onset of World War II, the
precious documents and the items she sent to the Bahá’í World
Centre were spared, but her other papers and belongings were
confiscated, probably destroyed during the Nazi occupation of
Paris.

Selected Tributes to Some Answered
Questions and Its Compiler

Among the many tributes to the compiler of Some Answered
Questions, one stands out as a powerful testimony to Laura
Barney’s sound understanding of the responses she received to
her questions. Afroukhteh says: “One day as He rose from the
table, while expressing a bit of weariness, He happily remarked,
‘It is encouraging that after all this labour, at least she
understands the concepts. This is refreshing. What would I have
done if after all this effort she still failed to comprehend the
issues?’”27

Praising the book and its compiler, Horace Holley says: “In
Some Answered Questions, Laura Barney accurately recorded
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s answers to questions related to the Prophets, to
man’s destiny, his attributes and powers, to immortality and the
life hereafter, which have long been cherished as an ideal
introduction to this new age of universal religion.” [SDC viii]

H. M. Balyuzi describes the book in more detail and praises
its compiler:

> ... in this book, Some Answered Questions, the supreme
> genius of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is overwhelmingly manifest. Men
> who have devoted precious years of their lives to study
> and research — to the building of arguments, the laying
> of premise, and the marshalling of facts — have never
> presented the fundamentals of life and belief, the basic
> truths of the universe around them, and the mainsprings
> of action, with such lucidity and coherence as are here

> apparent. Nor can they hope to rival, much less to
> match ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s all-encompassing wisdom. And
> these were words spoken without previous intimation of
> the nature and purport of the query. Not only do His
> answers arrest attention and compel thought, the
> strength wedded to the crystal clarity of the language
> enchants the mind. His statements are unencumbered,
> His similes most apt. His reasoning is flawless. His
> conclusions are unhedged and emphatic, informed with
> authority. Some Answered Questions has no equal, and
> the service rendered by its compiler has been
> characterized by the Guardian of the Faith as
> ‘imperishable.’28
