The Emerging Universe

The message of the Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh is that the
universe is God’s creation and every created thing in this world
is leading to God.

> Every created thing in the whole universe is but a door
> leading into His knowledge, a sign of His sovereignty, a
> revelation of His names, a symbol of His majesty, a token
> of His power, a means of admittance into His straight
Path.... (GWB 160)

This paper is exploring how science, studying the universe, is
little by little discovering this vision of Bahá'u'lláh. This
development of science is in its beginning and certainly not
unchallenged, nevertheless, this trend ought to be followed up
by those who have a knowledge of the Most Sublime Vision of
Bahá'u'lláh. Every scholarly engaged Bahá'í can recognize what is
said about the pervasiveness and generality of this vision.

> So pervasive and general is this revelation that nothing
> whatsoever in the whole universe can be discovered that
doth not reflect His splendor. (GWB 184)

First some new discoveries in Neuroscience and
Neurocardiology will be presented and following that the
interpretations of Quantum Mechanics, as presented today in
numerous books will be sorted out from this perspective. The
emergence of a new understanding of the universe is becoming a
popular topic and the horizon of this development cannot be
defined, as of yet.

That means that we can ask questions today in order to
understand what the new view of the world means to Bahá'í
theology, but we must be ready to revise them over time, as the
scientific knowledge and the understanding of the Revelation is

constantly evolving in a progressive process. We can only see
what is available today and have to develop our understanding
in a progressive evolution, which will abolish some ideas, will
change others, and will find new answers to the question of the
harmony between religion and science in the future. If this
approach is used in keeping the Covenant of the Faith, it will
not endanger, but enhance our understanding of the Cause of
Bahá'u'lláh.

The following two sections are rather brief and provisionally,
yet they are inserted here to demonstrate that many aspects of
modern science correspond and sometimes support concepts
and thoughts presented in the Bahá’í Scriptures. That does not
necessarily mean that these findings prove anything about the
Bahá’í Cause, but it makes the message of Bahá’u’lláh less open
to attacks from science, as the Christian message was attacked
by a materialistic and mechanistic scientific world view. The
Christian message, as presented in the different churches, was at
the time in clear opposition to scientific progress.

It is a personal experience of this writer as to how much
more difficult it is to believe in and defend the Christian
theology, which requires a philosophical separation between
religion and science, than to attempt the same with the Bahá’í
Faith, which has as one of its principles the harmony of science
and religion. That was why Teilhard de Chardin had so many
difficulties with the church, yet was having such a great impact
on religious thought, because he tried to avoid this separation
and used his scientific expertise to write his book The
Phenomenon of Man (1959). In it he attempts to explain that
the Christian message, if understood progressively, is not in
contradiction with the modern idea of evolution, but can be
translated into these new conceptualizations of progression and
unification. Teilhard was and is often misunderstood and
misused, nevertheless his influence is still remarkable.

Neurocardiology

The common medical understanding of the heart as a
mechanical pump was in drastic contradiction to the historical
understanding of the heart as the center and locus of personal
self. Writing about the Education of the Heart Thomas Taaffe
stated that this old and traditional understanding is based on the
heart in a metaphorical sense only, implying that there is no
reality to the metaphor of the heart as expressing the inmost
self and our true identity. Science has recently discovered that

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                        7

the old understanding of the heart as the center of emotions and
health is more realistic and can be researched scientifically.

The new science of neurocardiology attributes to the heart
the ability to have memory, to learn, to make decisions and
communicate with the brain, yet there is no consciousness in
these functions of the heart. According to McCraty et al.:

> The heart is a sensory organ and an information encoding
> and processing center with an extensive intrinsic nervous
> system, enabling it to learn, remember and make
> functional decision independent of the cranial brain.

While these neurological pathways do not directly explain the
above mentioned structure of the process, they might give us an
indication that this spiritual process has its physiological
correspondence in the human heart, nervous system, and brain.
It has also been established that the heart is the first to perceive
input from the perception through the senses. As a matter of
fact, it could be proven experimentally that changes in sensual
input are detected by the heart seconds before the random
computer program is started that will select the presentation to
the senses.

> Of greatest significance here is our major finding, namely,
> the electrophysiological evidence that the heart is directly
> involved in the processing of information about a future
> emotional stimulus seconds before the body actually
> experiences the stimulus.” … “The heart appears to play a
> direct role in the perception of future events.

This fact of intuition of future events can only be explained
scientifically if we consider the physical reality as seen in
quantum mechanics. This will be explained below in the section
dealing with physics and quantum mechanics. The heart, which is
a key concept in the Bahá’í Writings, and its physical and
spiritual capabilities, is a topic that certainly needs further
research. Here a short anticipatory comment must suffice.

What is most important in the context of this paper is the
fact that the heart is a sophisticated information processing
center.

> An understanding of the complex anatomy and function
> of the heart’s nervous system contributes an additional
> dimension to the newly emerging view of the heart as a
> sophisticated information processing center, functioning
> not only in concert with the brain but also independent of

> it. Further exploration of the part, that neurocardiological
> interactions play in sustaining healthy functioning may
> permit a more comprehensive understanding of the heart’s
> multidimensional role in facilitating successful adaptation
to the challenges of daily living.

Furthermore, it must be emphasized that, according to these
new findings about the heart, the influence the heart has into
the physiological, ethical and social well being of man needs to
be further investigated and compared with the Bahá’í statements
about the theological importance of the heart.

> During states of psycho-physiological coherence, bodily
> systems function with a high degree of synchronization,
> efficiency, and harmony and the body’s natural
> regenerative processes appear to be facilitated.
> Psychologically, this mode is associated with improved
> cognitive performance, increased emotional stability, and
> enhanced psychosocial function and the quality of life.
> Additionally, many people report experiencing a notable
> reduction in inner mental dialogue along with feelings of
> increased peace, self-security, and sustained positive
> emotions after practicing maintaining this mode even for
short periods such as a few days or weeks.

To appreciate the following Hidden Word of Bahá’u’lláh
about the heart becomes much more reasonable when it is
placed in the context of the new scientific findings about the
sensory capacity and ability of the heart to “learn, remember
and make functional decision,” so that we can talk about the
knowledge and wisdom of the heart from a scientific point of
view.

> Quaff from the tongue of the merciful the stream of
> divine mystery, and behold from the dayspring of divine
> utterance the unveiled splendor of the daystar of wisdom.
> Sow the seeds of My divine wisdom in the pure soil of the
> heart, and water them with the waters of certitude, that
> the hyacinths of knowledge and wisdom may spring up
> fresh and green from the holy city of the heart. (HW P78)

Neuroscience

Besides the unifying power of the heart, which has been
described above, some ideas about the human mind or intellect
will be added here.

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                      9

The picture of Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel is taken
from a book with the title The Humanizing Brain, Where
Religion and Neuroscience Meet. It is here reproduced in order
to show how in the artist’s imagination of a truth can be
expressed that will take centuries to be fully understood.

As can be clearly seen below, the cloud around God the
Creator has the shape of the human brain. Michelangelo was
familiar with this shape and most likely selected it to show that
man was created in the image of God, and the brain (or the
mind, the human consciousness) is the most obvious element in
man that can show this similarity in the image of God. It seems
that “Michelangelo meant to portray that what God is giving to
Adam is the intellect, and thus man is able to plan the best and
highest and to try all things received.” The authors continue to
say: “Since we are created in the image and likeness of God, we
have the ability to think and imagine and decide – yes, and the
ability to distort and destroy.”

This ability of the heart was described by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in
similar words:

> He has bestowed upon him the power of intellect so that
> through the attribute of reason, when fortified by the
> Holy Spirit, he may penetrate and discover ideal realities
> and become informed of the mysteries of the world of
> significances. (PUP 303)
> In the above mentioned book it is stated that the human
mind, as recently studied in neuroscience, presents a picture of
the nature of God as perceived in traditional religion, a
speculation that might go sometimes too far in speaking about
God; but it indicates the way the human brain and mind is part
of this world, and that consciousness is related to the material
aspect of this universe. Much more about this ability of the
human mind has recently been said in the interpretation of the
findings of quantum mechanics and has been developed by many
other writers, especially in the context of quantum mechanics
and its implications.

Unity in Quantum Mechanics

It is commonly accepted that the findings of quantum
mechanics have consequences that reach into metaphysics and
ontology. “It should be clear by now that one of the
fundamental problems thrown up by quantum mechanics in
general, and the measuring problem, in particular, is the nature

of reality – what is it that ‘really exists’ in the universe?”

The different interpretations of these connections fill books;
how far these applications can go was described by E. H.
Walker. At a conference at “New Visions of Reality”,
sponsored by the Department of Physics of the University of
Berkeley, and in the Journal of Time, Space and Knowledge,
Evan Harris Walker stated: “What we have been doing here is
laying the foundations for a religion of the twenty first
century,” and he reports that he was astounded “how quickly the
other speakers agreed with this assessment of a meeting in which
neither God nor religion had figured as the primary topic.”

Most books on this topic try to insert these new ideas into
Buddhist or Hindu thinking, into some New Age cosmology, or
into the mystic traditions. The value and meaning of these
diverse interpretations can be questioned. But these different
interpretations make one thing clear, i.e., we cannot understand
the new findings of quantum mechanics unless we place them in
a philosophical and/or theological conceptual frame.

When writers attempt to conceptualize the new findings of
Quantum Mechanics using old religious or philosophical
conceptualizations, they frequently make the logical failure Ken
Wilber calls the Pre/Trans Fallacy. In short, they think that an
early developmental state can be compared to a more recent and
more differentiated one, because often the undifferentiated
magic, mythic or pre-rational notion looks for the superficial
observer similar to a later differentiated and higher developed
concept.

It is therefore easy to understand that Hindu, Buddhist,
Biblical and other early conceptualization are used to explain
the findings of Quantum Mechanics. The words of 'Abdu'l-Bahá
about the new age and all the new discoveries in science indicate
that the old ways, the old concepts, are gone and forgotten
(SWAB 253). This is the truth of all Revelations and it is clearly
stated in the Bible (Mark 2:22) in the form of the parable of the
wineskins, translated as bottles in the King James translation.

And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new
wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the
bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new
bottles.

Therefore, only those interpretations, which can be
understood within the Vision of Bahá’u’lláh were used by this
writer. And that is deliberate and required by the concept of

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                    11

progressive theology.

In introducing this topic it must be noted that nothing fits
the following description of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá better than the
findings of quantum mechanics:

> All the sciences and arts we now enjoy and utilize were
> once mysteries, and according to the mandates of nature
> should have remained hidden and latent, but the human
> intellect has broken through the laws surrounding them
> and discovered the underlying realities. The mind of man
> has taken these mysteries out of the plane of invisibility
> and brought them into the plane of the known and visible.
> (PUP 351)
> The science of quantum mechanics certainly is a
breakthrough and a discovery of underlying realities, taken by
the “mind of man [from] the plane of invisibility … into the
plane of the known and visible” through the science of the
smallest particles of matter. Events observed in experiments at
the microscopic level of subatomic particles are experimentally
transferred to macroscopic effects through the instruments of
observation, which transfer the effect of these microscopic
events to the scientific macroscopic apparatus, such as a Geiger
counter. In this way “the mind of man has taken these mysteries
out of the plane of invisibility and brought them into the plane
of the known and visible.”

It needs to be considered that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said these words
about the scientific discoveries of His days, such as electricity,
x-rays, radio and other new inventions of the time; nevertheless,
these words fit equally well to the newest and most innovative
findings of modern science.

Quantum mechanics is introduced here for two reasons. One
is the change quantum mechanics has made to the cosmology
and the presuppositions of the mechanistic milieu of modern
science – away from a materialistic and reductionistic viewpoint
toward an understanding, which is more open to spiritual issues.
The other is that some of these findings and of their
philosophical interpretations are in surprising harmony with the
philosophical and theological implications of the Bahá’í
Writings, as will be shown below.

This later point will be portrayed here with the understanding
that the surprising development of quantum mechanics out of
the physics of the smallest particles has not happened just
“naturally” but rather follows this statement of Bahá’u’lláh:

> All the wondrous achievements ye now witness are the
> direct consequences of the Revelation of this Name. In the
> days to come, ye will, verily, behold things of which ye
have never heard before. (GWB 141)

Of all the achievements of science and technology, especially
in the area of the natural sciences and physics, the findings of
quantum mechanics, developed during the last century, and their
interpretations can certainly best be described “as wondrous
achievement, … of which ye have never heard before.” Two
things must be noted about this statement. Bahá’u’lláh predicts
these wondrous achievements in general, and He claims that
they are a direct consequence of His revelation of the name “the
Fashioner” as one of the names of God presented in His
Writings.

Additionally, quantum mechanics is not only such an
achievement, it further stimulates explanations, at least in some
of its interpretations, which make it easier to understand many
of the statements of Bahá’u’lláh about the renewal of the whole
world through His Revelation. Even in the Christian context, it
explains how to understand the words about Christ, by Whom
everything was made, as stated in the prologue of the Gospel of
John (1:1-3):

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
> God, and the Word was God. The same was in the
> beginning with God. All things were made by him; and
without him was not anything made that was made.

In describing quantum mechanics there are several possible
approaches. While even simple textbooks mention that the
findings of this science have repercussions in the fields of
cosmology, of philosophy and metaphysics, there are a number
of scientific and popular books, mostly written by physicists,
which develop these inferences in the different fields of
thinking.

In this paper we will take some new concepts of quantum
mechanics and develop their implication towards the Bahá’í
Revelation. The different reference books are chosen as samples
of how this new understanding can be presented; the last book
of E. H. Walker was chosen because its findings are the most
interesting for this writer and are most in harmony with the
topic of this paper.

Quantum mechanics will here be presented under the topics
of Enchantment through Spiritualization, Emergence of the

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                      13

New Creation, Entanglement in Unity, and Excellence of the
Human Mind and Consciousness. These concepts and findings
will be compared with ideas presented in the Bahá’í Writings.

Enchantment through Spirituality

Ervin Laszlo in his book Science and the Reenchantment of
the Cosmos, The Rise of the Integral Vision of Reality describes
the changes quantum mechanics has made to the understanding
of the cosmos:

> The current finding of the universe’s wholeness is the fruit
> of sustained investigation, based on observation and
> tested by experiment. It provides an entirely different
> image of the world than the mechanistic, materialistic and
> fragmented image we were taught in school. A cosmos that
> is connected, coherent, and whole recalls an ancient notion
> that was present in the tradition of every civilization; it is
> an enchanted cosmos. (2)
> In this book Laszlo connects the findings of quantum
mechanics with the Hindu concept of the Akashi Field and
develops an Integral vision of Reality in the sense of a “first
meeting-ground between science and spirituality.” (p. 93) As
with many of the new books using quantum mechanics as a
philosophical springboard to the area of spirituality, it is not
necessary to follow all of their conclusions while evaluating
their contributions.

In this case it is the connection with Hindu philosophy,
which we cannot follow except in the sense of a unity of all
religions. Other issues elucidated are valuable, i.e., the
enchantment of the cosmos compared to the traditional and
“objective” concept of classical scientific and deterministic
cosmology, which can be described as a worldview devoid of
spirituality, value and meaning.

The meaning of the word enchantment here is obviously not
“bewitchment” but “fascination.” Both meanings are used in the
translation of the Bahá’í Writings, and they are clearly
distinguished. Here a verse is presented from a prayer of
Bahá’u’lláh, in which He compares the ordeal of the martyrs of
the Faith with the Divine presence as Enchanter of the worlds in
a question.

> The bodies of Thy chosen ones lie quivering on distant
> sands: Where is the ocean of Thy presence, O Enchanter of

> the worlds? (BP 212)
> In order to understand this comparison, one must accept the
Vision of Bahá’u’lláh, which includes the following belief
expressed in another prayer:

> Had not every tribulation been made the bearer of Thy
> wisdom, and every ordeal the vehicle of Thy providence,
> no one would have dared oppose us, though the powers of
earth and heaven were to be leagued against us. (PM 14)

The apparent contradiction of gruesome martyrdom with an
enchanting world, created by a loving God, who is called the
Enchanter, can only be solved when we accept the Vision that
all ordeals are signs of God’s providence and wisdom. This is,
according to Bahá’u’lláh, as quoted by Shoghi Effendi, the
newness of the whole world and the fruit of His Revelation
which He compares with the “loftiest trees” and its most
“enchanting blossoms,” which are the most “heavenly blessings.”

“The whole earth,” writes Bahá’u’lláh, “is now in a state of
pregnancy. The day is approaching when it will have yielded its
noblest fruits, when from it will have sprung forth the loftiest
trees, the most enchanting blossoms, the most heavenly
blessings. Immeasurably exalted is the breeze that wafteth from
the garment of thy Lord, the Glorified! For lo, it hath breathed
its fragrance and made all things new! Well is it with them that
comprehend.” (WOB 169)

Consequently, it could be said that quantum mechanics opens
up the possibility of understanding the world as the fascinating
Creation of God, which Bahá’u’lláh reveals to us in His new and
Most Sublime Vision.

Emergence of the New Creation

The Nobel Prize laureate in physics, Robert B. Laughlin,
developed the concept of emergence in his book A different
Universe, Reinventing physics from the bottom down. He
considers this change as so important that he formulates it as a
new age, stating

> I think a good case can be made that science has now
> moved from an Age of Reductionism to an Age of
> Emergence, a time when the search for ultimate causes of
> things shifts from the behavior of parts to the behavior of
> the collective. (208)

In other words, reality is defined by a view that takes the
whole into consideration, and this whole is a whole that
integrates its parts; it is an integrated whole, as described in the
section on philosophy of the previous paper “Unity of
Revelation / Revelation of Unity.” The concept of emergence
as presented by Laughlin includes a different understanding of
reality in which the truth or certainty of a statement is not
caused by its reduction to the smallest parts but by recognizing
its organization on a specific level. This principle is accepted by
modern biology as well and has been described psychologically
and philosophically by Ken Wilber in his concept of the Holon.
Holons are at the same time parts of higher Holons and at the
same time have lower Holons as their parts.

According to Laughlin, reality is not an aggregate of elements
amassed by the physical deterministic principles of cause and
effects, but it is a product in a hierarchal order established by
collective organizations on the different levels of reality. This is
his understanding of the consequences of quantum mechanics in
understanding the reality of this world.

The concept of emergence implies that the world is not
organized from the bottom up, i.e., in a reductionistic and
atomistic sense, but that the bottom, i.e., the atoms or smallest
particles, indicate that the world is organized in a meaningful
and hierarchical way, which cannot be explained in any
reductionistic manner:

> It is not uncommon for a committed reductionist to
> dismiss the evidence of the fundamental nature of
> collective principles on the grounds that there actually is a
> deductive path from the microscopic that explains the
> reproducibility of these experiments. This is incorrect.
> (ibid. 19)
> This emergence and collective structure of reality originates
in the fact of Creation, as Bahá’u’lláh revealed:

> Nothing short of His all-encompassing grace, His all-
> pervading mercy, could have possibly achieved it. How
> could it, otherwise, have been possible for sheer
> nothingness to have acquired by itself the worthiness and
> capacity to emerge from its state of non-existence into the
> realm of being? (GWB, XXVII, 64-65)
This statement can certainly be understood in the sense that all
emergence of unity at any level of reality is caused by God, by
His “all-encompassing grace” and His “all-pervading mercy,”

i.e., by the creative power of God “the Unifier.” Therefore we
are admonished to

> …strive ye to knit together the hearts of men, in His
> Name, the Unifier, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. (GWB
8)

Shoghi Effendi applies this principle of unification to the
social and political unity of the world. He points out that unity
has been misconceived in the past as uniformity, clearly
referring to the classical view of the reality as particularistic and
mechanistic, where unity can only be understood as forced
uniformity, or to the fact that unity could be just a magical or
utopian concept and not the reality of unity in diversity in the
Bahá’í sense.

> The principle of unification which it advocates and with
> which it stands identified they have misconceived as a
> shallow attempt at uniformity, its repeated assertions of
> the reality of supernatural agencies they have condemned
> as a vain belief in magic, and the glory of its idealism they
have rejected as mere utopia. (WOB 73)

He further explains this unity of society and of religion as
evolutionary or progressive and gradual, exemplifying it in the
different forms of social unity during the history of humanity.

> Just as the organic evolution of mankind has been slow
> and gradual, and involved successively the unification of
> the family, the tribe, the city-state, and the nation, so has
> the light vouchsafed by the Revelation of God, at various
> stages in the evolution of religion, and reflected in the
> successive Dispensations of the past, been slow and
> progressive. Indeed the measure of Divine Revelation, in
> every age, has been adapted to, and commensurate with,
> the degree of social progress achieved in that age by a
constantly evolving humanity. (PDC 118)

The emergence of humanity and the gradual development of
society and civilization in history are described by Shoghi
Effendi as an internal process, requiring new virtues and moral
standards, and higher capacities of humankind. He describes this
newness as a process that leads humanity from the state of
adolescence towards maturity.

> Humanity has emerged from its former state of limitation
> and preliminary training. Man must now become imbued
> with new virtues and powers, new moral standards, new

> capacities. New bounties, perfect bestowals, are awaiting
> and already descending upon him. The gifts and blessings
> of the period of youth, although timely and sufficient
> during the adolescence of mankind, are now incapable of
> meeting the requirements of its maturity. (WOB 165)

Entanglement in Unity

Giancarlo Ghirardi, the chair of the Department of
Theoretical Physics at the University of Trieste, described the
concept of entanglement in his book, Sneaking a Look at God’s
Cards, Unraveling the Mysteries of Quantum Mechanics. This
book gives a historical description of quantum mechanics
without omitting the rather difficult conceptualizations
necessary to understand its development.

In quantum mechanics, entanglement is developed from the
findings that

> Practically every interaction [of particles] brings with it a
> loss of identity of the systems that are interacting. But
> since in the long run everything in practice interacts with
> everything, what emerges is a vision of the universe as an
> ‘unbroken whole,’ an undivided unity whose parts no
> longer have any identity. The theory implies a
> fundamentally holistic vision of the universe. (190)
The analysis of this process of entanglement

> brings an extension of the holistic view of reality even at
> the macroscopic level and in practice for all the physical
> systems of the universe. It was not by chance that David
> Bohm and Basil Hitley entitled their recent book The
> Undivided Universe. (191)
This process       has   been   developed   under   the   name     of
entanglement:

> The original German expression used by Schrödinger,
> Verschränkung, has become known in the scientific
> literature as “entanglement. (165)
Erwin Schrödinger, born near Vienna, Austria, (1887-1961)
formulated the importance of this concept:

> I consider [Entanglement or “Verschränkung”] not as one,
> but as the characteristic trait of Quantum Mechanics, the
> one that enforces its entire departure from classical lines

of thought.
Ghirardi concludes

> The analysis [of entanglement] brings an extension of the
> holistic view of reality, even at the macroscopic level and
in practice for all the physical systems of the universe.

In other words all parts of the universe are entangled,
interwoven or intertwined with each other; the universe is a
whole and is organized as mentioned above in emerging units on
all levels of existence.

The physical unity of the universe and its emerging
hierarchical order is best described in the Bahá’í Writings by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá (sentences separated by this writer):

> The rational proof of this is that the atoms of the material
> elements are transferable from one form of existence to
> another, from one degree and kingdom to another, lower
> or higher.
> For example, an atom of the soil or dust of earth may
> traverse the kingdoms from mineral to man by successive
> incorporations into the bodies of the organisms of those
> kingdoms.
> At one time it enters into the formation of the mineral or
> rock; it is then absorbed by the vegetable kingdom and
> becomes a constituent of the body and fibre of a tree;
> again it is appropriated by the animal, and at a still later
> period is found in the body of man.
> Throughout these degrees of its traversing the kingdoms
> from one form of phenomenal being to another, it retains
> its atomic existence and is never annihilated nor relegated
to nonexistence. (PUP 87-88)

This description of the way of an atom from mineral to
human is a clear description of the entanglement of all physical
elements as well as of the emergence of organization on
different levels of reality, which levels are here called kingdoms.
In a letter, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá added to this description that unity is a
product of attraction and love:

> O honoured lady! Look about thee at the world: here
> unity, mutual attraction, gathering together, engenders
> life, but disunity and inharmony spell death.

“When thou dost consider all phenomena, thou wilt see

> that every created thing hath come into being through the
> mingling of many elements, and once this collectivity of
> elements is dissolved, and this harmony of components is
> dissevered, the life form is wiped out. (SWA 3)
> Again, the created reality is considered in its structure as it
emerges in the integral combination of its elements on the
different levels of existence. It is important to realize that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá stresses the unification of the elements through
mutual attraction as the dynamic principle of this process. This
mutual attraction is a consequence of God’s love for the world,
according to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The harmony of their collective
structure is stressed here, and how disharmony and disunity
creates death or the end of their reality.

Concluding this section it can be summarized in this
statement of Bahá’u’lláh – that the unity of the world of being
is the concealed power underlying creation. This sentence
introduces the Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh appointing 'Abdu'l-Bahá
as His successor, but it could as well be understood in a wider
sense as the mighty unifying force holding together not only the
covenant but also and fundamentally the world of being:

> O ye My Branches! A mighty force, a consummate power

Excellence of the Human Mind and Consciousness

Here in this section the most daring conclusions from the
findings of quantum mechanics are presented. They have been
questioned and doubted, depending on the bias of their critics,
but have not been disproved. Quantum mechanics depends
widely on conceptualization, and making conclusions from the
findings in the subatomic level to the phenomenal world of
human reality is necessary in order to understand it. How far
these conclusions can go and remain still scientific and true is
hard to evaluate. In this case the closeness of these conclusions
to statements of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh presents an
added proof, at least for those thinkers who accept this
Revelation. The fact that, at least in some ways, these finding
are in harmony with certain passages from the Christian
Revelation as well, give them an added aspect of truth for the
followers of Christianity.

Bahá’u’lláh explains the power of the human mind in the

following statement:

> Say: Spirit, mind, soul, and the powers of sight and hearing
> are but one single reality which hath manifold expressions
> owing to the diversity of its instruments. As thou dost
> observe, man’s power to comprehend, move, speak, hear,
> and see all derive from this sign of his Lord within him. It
> is single in its essence, yet manifold through the diversity
> of its instruments.
> Reflect upon this subject that thou mayest comprehend
> the true meaning of what hath been intended, find thyself
> independent of the sayings of the people, and be of them
> that are well assured. In like manner, when this sign of
> God turneth towards the brain, the head, and such means,
> the powers of the mind and the soul are manifested. Thy
> Lord, verily, is potent to do whatsoever He pleaseth. (SLH
154)

The spirit, the mind and/or the soul are a single reality – are,
as Bahá’u’lláh reveals “single in its essence, yet manifold
through the diversity of its instruments.” In other words, the
singleness of the mind cannot be studied except through the
difference and the diversity of its physical instruments in the
material body. Furthermore, Bahá’u’lláh says “man’s power to
comprehend, move, speak, hear, and see all derive from this sign
of his Lord within him,” which means that the power of the
mind is exerted through the senses and the human ability to
move, speak and hear. The mind is described here as the
manifestation of the “sign of his Lord within”, but it can only
be seen in its effect in the material world. It is important that
the mind is effective in the physical world, which usually is
understood by the concept of free will, and that the mind, or
the spiritual aspect of man, as it is expressed in the human
mind, can therefore be studied only in its effects on the material
world, when it is expressed in speech, in movement and/or when
it communicates with other minds.

This will be described below in the comments on a book
about the Quantum Mind by E. H Walker, The Physics of
Consciousness, the Quantum Mind and the Meaning of Life.
Walker calls the cause of these changes the Quantum Mind, and
attributes to this mind powers that have been described before
only in theological writings, describing God or God’s Word in
its universal and fundamental power.

How did E. H. Walker do this? What follows is a

concentrated and simplified summary of this book. As a
physicist he said he is interested in reality, in everything that is
real. And, consciousness is a fact of reality; we all have it and
know it. How can a physicist approach it? The same way any
other new phenomena in physics were recognized in the past.
For example, when electricity was recognized as a reality that
was unknown before, physicists developed methods and
approaches that connected this new reality with known things
and developed a new aspect of physics.

Walker tries the same approach with consciousness. First he
defines it as not material and not mechanical, later as non-local
and non-time dependent, all of which we know from knowing
our mind. This definition actually can be said to define
spirituality, or as the Bahá’í Writings say, the Unseen, the
Hidden, Inwardness, contrasting it with the Seen, the Manifest,
Outwardness, or in the above quoted passage, “sign of his Lord
within.”

Then Walker says that we all know this consciousness of
humankind acts on the physical reality of this world; i.e., the
human consciousness has changed the world much more than the
mighty dinosaurs. Bahá’u’lláh said something very similar in the
quote above, i.e., that we know of the spiritual, the mind or
soul only through its “expressions owing to the diversity of its
instruments.”

Walker studies what we know about consciousness and how
it acts on physical reality. He develops, in typical scientific
manner for example, the field of consciousness, describing its
speed of change as 1/25 of a second (if the pictures or the
movie goes slower, we see them separate; if they are faster we
blend them together, because consciousness does it that way).
Then he describes the dimension of consciousness, explaining
the size of the visual field during that fraction of second and
brings in a certain number of “bits of information” that are
transferred through the two million nerves from the eye to the
brain. He knows the speed these nerves fire, and he can, in this
way, mathematically describe the field of consciousness. He
brings many other numbers together that define consciousness
from neurophysiologic research, and develops his view of
consciousness from the point of view as it affects physical
reality.

And then he asks: how does this consciousness, this non
material mind, make the brain do things with the body, with
matter, like move, etc., which obviously is where the rubber

meets the road, where consciousness (and he appropriately
includes here free will) affects physical reality.

To the contrary, the classical understanding in science was
expressed in psychology by the behaviorist Skinner, who tried to
solve the problem by negating mind and will, and claiming that
our brain, which he calls an unknown black box, is exclusively
determined by conditioning from the outside. This conditioning
he then studies physically and materially, since it fits into the
deterministic and materialistic cause and effect thinking of
science. During my studies in psychology this understanding was
in vogue, and I had a seminar on this rather strange and
reductionistic approach, which was proven by Skinner in his
experiments with the pigeon (and his young daughter) in the
famous “Skinner box.”

Contrary to this, Walker would claim that all “scientific”
denial of consciousness, of the mind or its reduction to
neurophysiologic facts, is not really required by science but only
by the materialistic and reductionistic bias of science, which
developed from Newton’s mechanistic cosmology. He discusses
several of these attempts, for example the work of the
Churchlands, among others.

What is quite interesting is that Walker’s conclusions about
the interaction between the spiritual (consciousness) and the
physical is derived from some findings of quantum mechanics,
and yet it fit surprisingly well in the description of the mind by
Bahá’u’lláh, Who stated that “Spirit, mind, soul, and the powers
of sight and hearing are but one single reality which hath
manifold expressions owing to the diversity of its instruments.”
(SLH 154) In other words, what Bahá’u’lláh reveals about the
mind, the soul or the spirit is the fact that it is a single reality,
therefore not physically located or describable, but this reality
is expressed in the diversity of its instruments, which are the
sensual and physical characteristics of the human brain and
body.

According to Walker, the human mind or consciousness can
be measured and physically described by its effects on the
brain’s nervous synapses and consequently on the physical brain
and nervous system that directs all bodily actions. According to
Bahá’u’lláh, the human mind, soul or spirit finds its expression
in its bodily instruments, which is saying almost the same from
the other aspect of the relationship.

Seen from the world of physics we have to explain how this

spiritual aspect of man, his consciousness and mind, causes
change in the material world. This Walker attempts to do. Seen
from a spiritual point of view, we need to look at this question
by asking how this spiritual element in man expresses itself in
the physical world. Bahá’u’lláh states it expresses itself through
its instruments, i.e. through the bodily senses and movements.

The astounding fact in this comparison is the new science of
quantum mechanics, which according to Walker gives an
explanation of this possibility of the spiritual affecting the
material in quantum events in the synapses of the nervous
system in the brain. These quantum effects, which are not
deterministically defined by cause and effect, can be influenced
by the observer, i.e., by consciousness of the human mind.

Therefore, according to Walker, the spiritual mind can
influence matter at the level of the undetermined quantum
processes in the brain’s synapses that are small enough to allow
quantum effects to happen. Walker describes this process in
detail with the physics of quantum mechanics. In the context of
this description he explains a number of functions of the mind,
like sleep, ability to influence matter in rare cases, and why the
power of the mind is usually restricted, as common sense
experience tells us. Another not yet considered question is the
effect of the little brain of the heart (as described above), which
does not have consciousness. Walker does not consider this, but
it needs to be included in this equation, a rather new and
difficult task that this writer will develop in a later paper.

In the following we will take some concluding statements by
Walker and compare them with statements from the Bahá’í
Writings, drawing inferences from one to the other. The reader
is referred to the book of Walker to see how he came to these
conclusions, because, to describe these details here would
breach the format of this paper.

When talking about the history of the big bang theory
Walker states:

> Consciousness may also exist somewhere without being
> part of either a living body or a data-processing system.

(256)
This indicates that consciousness is transpersonal and not
confined to the human person. Interestingly enough even
Aristotle had said that the mind (nous) is coming from the
outside. Then Walker relates the mind to quantum mechanics
when, in summarizing, he said:

> We have found that in their essential nature, quantum
> fluctuations are the stuff of consciousness and will.
> And now, here, we find that this mind stuff was the
> beginning point of the universe – the stuff that out of a
formless void created everything that was created. (334)

This is what Walker calls the Quantum Mind, which he
describes as being the beginning of the universe and the
underlying power of its existence.

In his chapter about “A God for Tomorrow,” Walker claims
that

> Everyone worships reality. Each person looks about him,
> listens a moment – listens as long as life will let him pause
> to listen – and then he falls down and worships whatever it
> is that looks like this is what it is all about. (372)
As a conclusion of his research into the reality of consciousness
Walker then concludes:

> There must exist a supreme Consciousness out of which
> everything else springs. (334)
Then he describes this reality (the sentence is here broken up to
better compare its structure):

> We discover that in the beginning, there was the Quantum
> Mind,
> • a first cause
> • itself time-independent
> • and non-local
> • that created space time and matter/energy.

In this quote from Walker, he seems to say something rather
unexpected. He speaks about the Quantum Mind (which is
capitalized by Walker), and gives Him attributes that do not fit
to anybody else than the Manifestations.

First cause relates to the Big Bang theory, as Walker explains
it, because the origin of all that came to exist is Consciousness.

This consciousness of the Quantum Mind is time-
independent, another conclusion from quantum mechanics, and
it is also non-local which was proven experimentally; one
electron can influence its pair even if they are separated by wide
distances. If one is observed as a wave or as particle, the other
will be the same, and there is no possibility of physical

communication in space and time between these particles or
waves. This unity of all particles and of the whole cosmos is
called entanglement as described above. There are other non-
local relationships in quantum mechanics, and Walker describes
how the brain’s consciousness functions on that basis.

In the following these three attributes given to the Quantum
Mind (i.e., being time-independent, non-local, and the first
cause of everything) are compared to how Bahá’u’lláh describe
the Manifestations, albeit in different words but with a similar
meaning, at least as I read it today.

The issue of First cause is expressed in this statement by
Bahá’u’lláh:

> Nay, all else besides these Manifestations, live by the
> operation of Their Will, and move and have their being
> through the outpourings of Their grace. (GWB 179)
The fact of the Manifestations being time-independent can be
compared to the statement from the Kitáb-i-Íqán about the
Manifestations:

> Even as in the ‘Beginning that hath no beginnings’ the
> term ‘last’ is truly applicable unto Him who is the
> Educator of the visible and of the invisible, in like
> manner, are the terms ‘first’ and ‘last’ applicable unto His
> Manifestations. They are at the same time the Exponents
> of both the ‘first’ and the ‘last.’ (KI 163)
> About the issue of non-locality, that plays an important role
in quantum mechanics and is an attribute of the Quantum Mind
in the description of Walker. The following can be said in
comparison to the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh about the
Manifestations:

> Whilst walking amongst mortals, they soar in the heaven
> of the divine presence. Without feet they tread the path of
> the spirit, and without wings they rise unto the exalted
> heights of divine unity. With every fleeting breath they
> cover the immensity of space and at every moment
> traverse the kingdoms of the visible and the invisible. (KI
> 66)
> The Quantum Mind described by Walker above is the first
cause and the creator of time and energy. This compares with
the statement of Bahá’u’lláh about the Manifestations:

Thus it is that through the rise of these Luminaries of God

> the world is made new, the waters of everlasting life
> stream forth, the billows of loving-kindness surge, the
> clouds of grace are gathered, and the breeze of bounty
bloweth upon all created things. (KI 33)

Closer and more basic to Walker’s understanding of religion
is probably the quote from the Gospel of John (1:1-3), repeated
here in the same sense of Christ, the Word, being the creator of
everything:

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
> God, and the Word was God. The same was in the
> beginning with God. All things were made by him; and
without him was not any thing made that was made.

We need to mention here again that there is much more to
know in the future about this surprising correlation of modern
physics with the Bahá’í Writings, and progress of theology in
understanding the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh will give new and
deeper meaning to all of these Revelations. It must be
emphasized that this is what we can see today, contemplating
the wondrous achievement of modern physics, cosmology and
ontology. The harmony between science and religion is
constituted by this progress of both, of science and of theology,
coming closer as humanity progresses.

Conclusions

In the book of Revelation (21:5) the returning Christ is on
the Throne of the heavenly Jerusalem, which is described as the
New Heaven and the New Earth, and it is said about Him:

> And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all
things new.

It is the thesis of this paper that this prophesy has been
verified in the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, Who is regarded by
Bahá'ís as the return of Christ and of all previous
Manifestations or Luminaries.

> Thus it is that through the rise of these Luminaries of God
> the world is made new, the waters of everlasting life
> stream forth, the billows of loving-kindness surge, the
> clouds of grace are gathered, and the breeze of bounty
> bloweth upon all created things. (KI 33)
How do we understand this? Bahá’u’lláh clearly explains what is
understood with New Heaven and New Earth when He said:

> On the contrary, by the term “earth” is meant the earth of
> understanding and knowledge, and by “heavens” the
> heavens of divine Revelation. Reflect thou, how, in one
> hand, He hath, by His mighty grasp, turned the earth of
> knowledge and understanding, previously unfolded, into a
> mere handful, and, on the other, spread out a new and
> highly exalted earth in the hearts of men, thus causing the
> freshest and loveliest blossoms, and the mightiest and
> loftiest trees to spring forth from the illumined bosom of
> man. (KI 47-48)
> In this paper this earth of understanding and knowledge was
followed up, especially as it is new and has changed the whole
conception of this world “in the hearts of men.”

Concluding, it has to be kept in mind that all the ideas
presented in this paper are provisional and related to the present
level of understanding science, as well as, the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh, with the understanding that both the processes of
science and the comprehension of the Revelation are
progressive. So, any conclusion presented here needs to be
revised over time. The major conclusion of this paper can be
summarized in the following sentence:

Metaphysics and physics of consciousness can facilitate the
understanding of the Bahá’í Revelation, if compared to the
sacred Writings of the Faith.

The absolute newness of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh and
how it requires a new understanding of this world was expressed
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

> Until the old ways, the old concepts, are gone and
> forgotten, this world of being will find no peace. (SWAB
> 253)
> In a more prophetic and mystic pronouncement, this was
stated by Bahá’u’lláh in a Hidden Word as a condition of
understanding His Most Sublime Vision … “that with a clear
vision, a pure heart and an attentive ear thou mayest enter the
court of My holiness”

> Blind thine eyes, that thou mayest behold My beauty; stop
> thine ears, that thou mayest hearken unto the sweet
> melody of My voice; empty thyself of all learning, that
> thou mayest partake of My knowledge; and sanctify
> thyself from riches, that thou mayest obtain a lasting share
> from the ocean of My eternal wealth. Blind thine eyes, that

> is, to all save My beauty; stop thine ears to all save My
> word; empty thyself of all learning save the knowledge of
> Me; that with a clear vision, a pure heart and an attentive
> ear thou mayest enter the court of My holiness. (PHW 11)
