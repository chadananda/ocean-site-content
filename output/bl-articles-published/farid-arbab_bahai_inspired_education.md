## Advancing in Bahá'í-inspired Education

> **Abstract:** In order to advance significantly in Bahá'í-inspired education, we need to keep in mind Bahá'u'lláh's extraordinary vision of the human being who will walk this earth in the fullness of time. While being respectful of accomplishments in the field of education, we need to remember that in its present state, it is incapable of cultivating such an individual. Humbled by the realization of the magnitude of the work ahead, a growing number of us, together with other like-minded individuals, have to labor in diverse cultural and ecological settings, identifying educational needs, developing elements of a coherent pedagogy, and creating a series of teaching-learning experiences in which these elements are given practical expression. The experience of the Junior Youth Spiritual Empowerment Program is offered as an example of an endeavor to advance Bahá'í-inspired education in which modest contributions accumulate and lead to significant progress.

more of us to fix our eyes on the vision of the human being and the future
civilization revealed by Bahá’u’lláh, to gain a more profound understanding of
the attributes of that human being, and, through a systematic process of action,
reflection, study, and consultation, move toward the goal of Bahá’í education. In
this endeavor, we should not attach ourselves to fashionable educational models.
We should create a culture that does not favor fads or the dominance of technique
over substance. We must do our best to integrate spiritual insights gained from
the study of the Bahá’í teachings and from our experience in applying them to
the life of humanity with knowledge generated through painstaking scientific
research.
