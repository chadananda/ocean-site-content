To conclude, the reality expressed
in The Woman can be seen to revolve
around reading as a progressive so-
ciopolitical act that undermines both
the secular and religious hegemony at
the same time that it is equated with
spiritual discernment. Reading within
this transnational work of historical
fiction is an act that can result in im-
prisonment and death and, in this way,
it is estranged from the mundane and
safe act that it is regarded to be in the
West. The estrangement of the act of
reading functions to support a post-
secular interpretation of the novel,
where reading brims over its secular
meaning and flows into the mystical.
This interpretation of the reading
motif also points to the rejection of
narrow religiosity. This analysis, in
short, shows how Nakhjavani’s narra-
tive rescues the delegitimized voice of
a Bahá’í heroine by affirming the act
of reading as a vehicle for, and expres-
sion of, spirituality.
