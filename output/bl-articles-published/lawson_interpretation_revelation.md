Abstract
This article attempts to describe and place in context two of the earliest writings of the Báb. Both writings are
commentaries on the Qur’án. The earliest of these, a commentary on the Chapter of the Cow, was written before the
Báb made his claim to be the Promised One; the second is the famous Qayyúm al-Asmá or Commentary on the
Chapter of Joseph. Apart from pointing out the dramatic differences in style and content between these two
commentaries, the article offers some observations on the nature of these contents, the history of the ideas put forth,
and their relationship to Shí‘í Islam and the thought of Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsá’í and Siyyid Kázim Rashtí.

Résumé
Cet article tente de décrire et de replacer dans leur contexte deux des premières oeuvres du Báb. Ces deux oeuvres
sont des commentaires sur Ie Coran. Le premier, un commentaire sur le Chapitre de la Vache, a été écrit avant que le
Báb ne se soit proclamé Le Promis; le second est le fameux Qayyúm al-Asmá ou Commentaire sur Ie Chapitre de
Joseph. En plus de faire ressortir les différences dramatiques quant au style et au contenu de ces deux commentaires,
cet article propose quelques observations portant sur la nature de ces contenus, sur l’ histoire des idées avancées et
sur leur relation avec l’Islam Shi‘ite et de la pensée de Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsá’í et de Siyyid Kázim Rashtí.

Resumen
Este artículo se esfuerza a describir y poner en contexto dos de los primeros escritos del Báb. Ambos escritos son
comentarios sobre el Corán. El primero de estos, un comentario sobre el Capítulo de la Vaca, fué escrito antes de
que el Báb se anunciara ser El Prometido; el segundo es el famoso Qayyúm al-Asmá o Comentario sobre el Capítulo
de José. A su vez de hacer visible la diferencia tanto de estilo como de contenido entre estos dos comentarios, el
artículo presenta algunos comentarios sobre el carácter de estos contenidos, los antecedentes históricos de las ideas
expuestas, y su relación a el Islam Chiíta y al pensamiento del Jeque Ahmad al-Ahsá’í el Siyyid Kázim Rashtí.

he writings of the Báb are many; on his own estimate they exceed 500,000 verses. 1 In the past, these writings
T    have been examined mainly for what they have to tell us about the history of the Bábí movement. The purpose
of this discussion is to draw attention to the literature itself in order to begin an evaluation of what must surely be
one of the most important questions to be raised not only by students of the Bábí and Bahá’í religions but also by
those interested in the history of the nineteenth-century Iran, upon which the dramatic events associated with the
name of the Báb made such a vivid mark. That question, how did the Báb read the Holy Book of Islam, will
automatically be of interest to those engaged in studying the history of the interpretation of the Qur’án. It should be
mentioned that tafsír represents only one of several types of exposition to which the Báb applied Himself. That it
should be regarded as among the most important types is clear from the mere fact that it comprises a large per-
centage of his extant work and that it was by means of a tafsír that He first made his claims known.

It was the Tafsír súrat Yúsuf, also known as the Qayyúm al-Asmá, which the Báb’s earliest followers used
to propagate his cause. It has been referred to by Bahá’u’lláh as “the first, the greatest and mightiest of all
books”(Kitáb-i-Íqán 231), and by Shoghi Effendi as being “universally regarded, during almost the entire ministry
of the Báb, as the Qur’án of the people of the Bayán”(God Passes By 23). In addition to this work, there are three
other major tafsírs extant and a series of shorter commentaries.2 It appears that all of these belong to the earliest
period of the Báb’s career and are, therefore, important in themselves as a source for his earliest thought (E.G.
Browne, Encyclopedia 2:300-305a).

As will be seen, some of this material represents a distinct type of scriptural interpretation; this is
particularly apparent in the Tafsír súrat Yúsuf, excerpts from which will appear below. That there are problems
connected with the proper categorization of some of these writings is something that Browne suggested long ago; in

speaking of the above-mentioned tafsír he said: “A Commentary in the strict sense of the word it is not, but rather a
mystical and often unintelligible rhapsody.”3

In the following pages an attempt will be made to show some aspects of this work and one other of the
Báb’s tafsír in an attempt to indicate, in however limited a form, some elements of the logic of structure and content
of this important work while calling attention to the clear transformation of style and thought between it and the
earlier Tafsír súrat al-baqara. Before proceeding directly to the texts, a brief outline of the life of the Báb will help
put the following discussion in perspective.

1\. LIFE OF THE BÁB
The Báb was born in Shiraz on 20 October 1819 (1 Muharram 1235) into a family of prosperous merchants. His
father died when the Báb was about seven years old, and the responsibility for the Báb’s upbringing devolved upon
his uncle. His formal education consisted of six or seven years at a local maktab under the direction of one Shaykh
‘Ábid, who happened to be an adherent of the then somewhat popular Shaykhí school. It appears that the Báb,
whose name was ‘Alí Muhammad, was not particularly fond of school, although. according to some reports, this
antipathy was not the result of any intellectual incapacity. On the contrary, the few reports that exist tend to show
the Báb at this early stage as the owner of a precociously inquisitive and outspoken nature.4

At age thirteen the Báb left the maktab and two years later moved with his uncle to Búshihr to pursue the
family business there. After about four years of working in partnership with his uncle, the Báb became independent.
There is disagreement about what the Báb’s attitude to trade was, but so far no compelling evidence has been
brought to light to support the statement that this basic attitude was negative.5 While in Bushíhr the Báb began to
write various religious works. Although it is not known exactly what these were, they probably included essays on
various theological topics and eulogies of the Imáms. Some of these were apparently written at the request of certain
of his fellow merchants. There is also an indication that even before voicing any particular claim to spiritual
authority, the Báb had aroused a certain amount of attention, and even ill will, by the production of these earliest
works (Balyuzi 40; MacEoin, “Charismatic” 138-39).

In 1840, the Báb closed his business and left Bushíhr for the region of ‘Atabat (lit. “thresholds,” it refers to
the holy cities of Karbalá’ and Najaf), where He remained for nearly a year.6 It was during this time that He attended
lectures by Siyyid Kázim Rashtí, the undisputed successor of Shaykh Ahmad, founder of the Shaykhí school. It
seems that the Báb’s family did not approve of his preoccupation with things religious and that his marriage, in
1842, was arranged in the hope of inducing Him to concentrate his attention more on the practicalities of existence.
Prior to his marriage, while He was still in Karbalá’, it is said that the Báb became acquainted with and attracted a
certain amount of attention from a number of Shaykhís, some of whom later became his followers (Smith, In Iran
3:60 and references). Even his arch-enemy, Muhammad Karím Khán Kirmání, says in his polemical Izháq al-bátil
that, although he himself never met the Báb, it was true that the Báb was held in respect in Karbalá’ and that He did
in fact meet and serve Siyyid Kázim (MacEoin, “Charismatic” 140).

The picture that emerges, then, is of a pious young man, who, despite a lack of formal training in the higher
religious sciences was nevertheless motivated to produce religious works, the nature of which was sufficiently
impressive to win the respect of his readers. Indeed, it was undoubtedly the very fact of this lack of training, together
with his status as a merchant, that called attention to his undeniable spiritual and literary gifts. Thus, a variation on
the Islamic theme of the “unlettered prophet” begins to take shape. In this connection it is also interesting, and
perhaps instructive with reference to the way in which Muhammad’s so-called illiteracy may be understood, to
observe that the Báb was manifestly not illiterate; in fact, many of his writings were produced before witnesses. That
these works were written by one untutored, or at best self-taught, and perhaps more convincingly, that they were
written with astonishing speed and fluency, combined to present to some people at least an evidentiary miracle
comparable, in every way, to the Qur’án itself.7

In 1844, shortly after the death of Siyyid Kázim, the Báb put forth his claim, in writing, to be in direct
contact with the Hidden Imám and so a locus of tremendous spiritual authority. Mullá Husayn and seventeen other
young Shaykhís, including the famous poet Táhirih, gave their allegiance to Him, and the Bábí movement was born.
Some months later the Báb departed on his pilgrimage, returning to Shíráz in March 1845. As a result of the activity
of his followers, He was now arrested for the first time and shortly released. In 1846, the Báb took up residence in
Isfahán where He remained from September of that year until March 1847, shortly after his powerful protector, the
mu‘tamad-i dawla, Manuchir Khán, died on February 21. At this time He was arrested by government troops and
escorted to the western frontier of Iran where He was to spend the rest of his life in secluded imprisonment.

During this last stage of his career, the Báb continued to experience and record revelations. It was at this
time that his Persian Bayán was written, together with many prayers, ajwiba, and other correspondence to his by
now numerous following throughout Iran. According to Nabíl, the Báb, during the nine months He was held in the

castle at Máh-kú, produced no less than nine complete commentaries on the Qur’án (Nabíl, 31). As is well known,
the Báb’s literary activity came to an end on 9 July 1850, when He was publicly executed in Tabríz.8

2\. THE SHAYKHÍ SCHOOL
In a foreword to his account of the first hundred years of the Bábí/Bahá’í religion, Shoghi Effendi asserts the
significance of the Shaykhíya in Bábí and Bahá’í history:

> I shall seek to represent and correlate, in however cursory a manner, those momentous happenings which
> have insensibly, relentlessly, and under the very eyes or successive generations, perverse, indifferent or
> hostile, transformed a heterodox and seemingly negligible offshoot of the Shaykhí school of the Ithná-
> ‘Asharíyyih sect of Shi‘ah Islám into a world religion ... (God Passes By xii)

The “seemingly negligible offshoot” here mentioned is of course the Bábí religion. It has already been mentioned
that the Báb’s teacher, Shaykh ‘Ábid, was a follower of this Shaykhí school. It is also known that several of the
Báb’s merchant relatives were attracted to the teachings of this movement (Nabíl, 30). As was mentioned above, the
Báb Himself attended the lectures of Siyyid Kázim Rashtí and in at least two works directly refers to him as “my
teacher”(mu‘allimí).9 It is therefore important that some brief statement on the history and teachings of the Shaykhí
school be offered so that a better understanding can be gained of the context in which the Báb wrote his quranic
commentaries.
The founder of the Shaykhíya, or the Kashfíya as its adherents preferred to be designated, was Shaykh Ahmad ibn
Zayn al-Din ibn Ibráhím ibn Saqr ibn Ibráhím ibn Dághir al-Ahsá’í. He was born in 1752 in a small village in
Bahrayn (namely al-Ahsá) apparently of pure Arab lineage, and his family had been followers of the Shí’í version of
orthodoxy for five generations. From his early childhood, it was clear that Shaykh Ahmad was strongly predisposed
to the study of religious texts and traditions. By the age of five he could read the Qur’án, and during the remainder
of his primary education he studied Arabic grammar and became exposed to the mystical and theosophical
expressions of Ibn ‘Arabí (d. 638/1240) and the less well-known Ibn Abí Jumhúr (d. c. 901/1495-6), author of the
Kitáb al-mujlí. In 1772, Shaykh Ahmad left his home to pursue advanced religious studies in the area of the ‘Atabát
in Iraq. He received his first ijáza (degree) from the renowned scholar Siyyid Muhammad Mahdí Bahr al-‘Ulúm (d.
1797), and eventually six others from various recognized teachers.10

Shaykh Ahmad remained away from Bahrayn for about a year and then returned to pursue his studies,
presumably independently, for the next twenty-five years. As a result of the Wahhábí attack on his native al-Ahsá,
he travelled to Basra in 1797 and remained in the religious centres and other localities of Iraq and Iran until the end
of his life. He died on pilgrimage to Mecca in 1825 and was buried in the famous Baqí’ cemetery of Medina. The
work of Shaykh Ahmad was continued by his favorite student, Siyyid Kázim Rashtí (1798-1844). After the death of
Siyyid Kázim, his students divided into several groups, one centred around the personality of Muhammad Karím
Khán Kirmání, another around Siyyid ‘Ali Muhammad, the Báb.

3\. SHAYKHÍ TEACHINGS
The distinguishing features of this school, as is the case with most Muslim religious sects, are related to the manner
in which spiritual authority is to be defined. At this time, the Shí‘í world was experiencing an active controversy
carried on by the followers of two groups called the usúliya and the akhbáríya. These terms refer to the way each
group tended to support its statements on Islamic law and theology. The debate was based on the question of
whether ijtihád, “exerting individual effort to form an opinion,” rather than wholesale acceptance of the guidance
contained in the preserved statements (akhbár) of Muhammad and the Imáms, was the best way to resolve the
questions of religion, which would of course include questions of law. Finally the usúliya, those in favor of ijtihád,
won the day, and for the last 200 years this basic attitude towards the written sources of the Islamic religion has held
sway over most of the Shí‘í world.

Shaykh Ahmad grew up in one of the last bastions of the akhbárí approach, and his synthesis can be seen as a
radicalization of this method. By means of propounding a doctrine of the Perfect Shí‘a, an obvious adaptation of the
Sufi idea of the Perfect Man (al-insán al-kámil), Shaykh Ahmad was able, at least in theory, to circumvent the
restrictions imposed by either of the two above methods and arrive at a much less fettered and independent position
vis-à-vis the reinterpretation of the raw material of the Islamic religion—the Qur’án, the sunna, and the teachings of
the Imams that were preserved in the akhbár. In short, this doctrine held that the Perfect Shí‘a was always present on
earth as a direct link to the Hidden Imám, Muhammad ibn al-Hasan, the twelfth Imám of the Shí‘a, who disappeared
from public ken at the age of six after succeeding his late father as Imám and whose occultation had now lasted
nearly one thousand years. While neither Shaykh Ahmad nor Siyyid Kázim ever publicly claimed the rank of Perfect
Shí‘a, it seems fairly certain that their followers considered them as such.

Shi‘ism has traditionally based itself on five main principles: divine unity (tawhíd), prophethood (nubúwa),
return (ma’ád), the imamate (imáma), and divine justice (‘adl). Shaykh Ahmad reduced these to three by combining
‘justice’ with ‘unity’ and placing the ‘return’ in the category of ‘prophethood’. To these three, Unity, Prophethood,
and the Imamate, was added the idea of the Perfect Shí‘a sometimes referred to by the Shaykhís as the Fourth
Support (al-rukn al-rábi’) or religion, an allusion, in parallel, to the four pillars of God’s throne (‘arsh, kursí).11
Other distinguishing characteristics of the beliefs held by the Shaykhís pertained to eschatology, in which a
corporeal resurrection was denied in favor of a somewhat complex recourse to a separate reality in which a
resurrection of one’s spiritual or subtle (latíf) body underwent a process designated by the familiar terminology of
ma‘ád, qiyáma, and so forth. Surely the emphasis here is on the denial of the scientifically untenable bodily
resurrection that so many Muslim philosophers prior to Shaykh Ahmad also found impossible to believe.12 Shaykh
Ahmad’s contribution on this matter is in the form of a sufficiently detailed and appealingly possible alternative—
even the most hard-bitten skeptic would never completely deny the possibility of the totally spiritual process that
Shaykh Ahmad propounded. These three features—the doctrine of the Perfect Shí‘a, the extreme veneration of the
Holy Family, and the denial of bodily resurrection—are perhaps the most important with regard to the relationship
of Bábism to Shaykhism.

The doctrine of the Perfect Shí‘a was inseparable from the Shaykhí apophatic theology and implied a
virtual deification13 of the Fourteen Pure Ones (chehardeh ma‘súm) of orthodoxy: Muhammad, Fátimih, ‘Alí, al-
Hasan, al-Husayn, and the remaining Imams of Twelver Shi‘ism. God here is eternally unknowable (rather than
remote) and makes his will known through various stages. Eternally crucial to this process is the twofold institution
of prophecy/imamate, and whenever any positive statement about divinity is made, its proper reference is to this
institution. The Prophet and Imams are a different order of creation as mediators between God and humanity. The
Perfect Shí‘a acts as mediator between the Imams, represented by the twelfth, Muhammad ibn al-Hasan, and
humanity. Therefore, when the Báb claimed to have received the Tafsír súrat Yúsuf from the Imám (see below),
even though He did not explicitly claim for Himself the title of the Perfect Shí‘a, those Shaykhís who were his first
readers were already convinced of the necessity for such a link as a Báb (gate), even if they were not agreed as to
who was best qualified to act as such, or, less important, what the exact name for such a link should be.

Before leaving the subject, it is important to point out that up until the period of time in which the Báb
wrote, the Shaykhíya were probably not yet seen as a separate sect of Twelver Shi‘ism. According to Rafati:

> Although the terms “Shaykhí,” “Posht-i Sarí,” and “Kashfíya” refer to a certain group of people, and were
> intended to distinguish them from the rest of Shí‘a, the group solidarity and identity of the Shaykhís was in
> fact not so distinct as to sharply separate them from the rest of the Shí‘í community of Iran as an
> independent sect or even branch of Twelver Shí‘a. The Shaykhís considered themselves true Shí‘a who
> thought and behaved in accordance with the teaching of the Shí’í imáms; they did not consider themselves
> innovators. It is difficult to believe that during Shaykh Ahmad’s lifetime he was considered the founder of
> a new school of thought within the Shí’í framework. However, as time went on and the nature of his
> ideology received greater intellectual attention, a group of fundamentalist ‘ulamá perceived a radical
> distinction between his views and the established doctrines of the Shi‘a and increasingly differentiated
> themselves from the Shaykhís. The Shaykhí school, then, gained more group solidarity as it developed
> historically, reacting as a group against the main body of the Shi‘a when it encountered social and
> intellectual opposition.14

4\. TAFSÍR WORKS
Among the Báb’s writings there are numerous works of tafsír.15 Some of these are commentaries on such important
traditions as the hadíth al-járíya or the hadíth Kumayl. Most of the others are commentaries on either a complete
súra of the Qur’an or one of the more notable verses, such as the light verse (Q. 24/35) or the throne verse (Q.
2/255). These commentaries present a broad range of ideas and exegetical techniques—to such a degree that any
attempt to discuss all of them here would ultimately be meaningless. This is so in spite of the fact that they all seem
to come from the same general period, usually referred to as early Bábism (Browne, Encyclopedia). Despite the
astonishingly varied nature of the style and content of these commentaries, or more accurately because of it, they are
of course extremely valuable for a study of the development of the Báb’s thought. Collectively they represent a
unique individual corpus of Islamic scriptural commentary.

Of the numerous titles in this genre, however, four stand out as major works. In chronological order they
are commentaries on al-baqara (súra 2), Yúsuf (súra 12), al-kawthar (súra 108), and wa’1-‘asr (súra 103). In the
following discussion attention will be focused exclusively on the first two of these commentaries .16

i. Tafsír súrat al-baqara
The Báb was just under twenty-five when He completed the first volume of this work in Muharram 1259.17 The
work was therefore completed a few months before He made his momentous claim to Mullá Husayn, the young
Shaykhí, on the evening of 22 May 1844 (4 Jumádá 1, 1260). In corroboration of this dating, Mullá Husayn is
reported to have noticed this tafsír resting on a shelf in the Báb’s house during the course of that very evening.18
This earliest sustained religious work of the Báb includes a brief commentary on al-fátiha (súra 1), prefaced in some
manuscript copies by an introduction noteworthy for the reference it makes to the date on which composition was
begun. Here the Báb says that the night before He began the work, He had a dream in which the entire city of
Karbalá’ (ard al-muqaddas) rose bit by bit into the air and came to rest before his house in Shiráz, whereupon He
was informed of the approaching death of Siyyid Kázim Rashtí, the Shaykhí leader, to whom He here refers as his
revered teacher (TBA 6).

The way in which súrat al- fátiha is treated is in some ways characteristic of the rest of the commentary. For
the Báb, meaning may be derived from the book chiefly by way of relating its contents to the Holy Family
(Muhammad, Fátimih, and the twelve Imáms). To this end, each of the seven verses of the opening súra is
designated as a writing (kitáb) of one of these sacred figures. Beginning with Muhammad, these include (in this
order) ‘Ali, Fátimih, al-Hasan, al-Husayn, Ja‘far al-Sadiq, and finally Músá ibn Ja‘far. As will be seen below, the
number seven plays an important part throughout this work.19 In this instance, the seven names represent the
different names by which each of the fourteen Pure Ones are known. That is, each of the names Muhammad, ‘Ali,
and al-Hasan may be applied to more than one figure. The names Fátímih, al-Husayn, Ja‘far, and Músá, however,
may only be used once. The name Muhammad is applicable not only to the Prophet Himself but also to Muhammad
al-Báqir, the fifth Imám (d. 113/731–2), Muhammad al-Jawád, the ninth Imám (d. 220/835), and Muhammad ibn al-
Hasan al-‘Askari, the twelfth Imám, also known as al-Mahdí (disappeared 260/873–4). The name ‘Ali may properly
designate not only the first Imám (d. 40/661) but also his grandson the fourth Imám, ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn (d. 94/712–
13), the eighth Imám, ‘Alí al-Ridá (d. 202/817-18), and ‘Alí al-Hádí, the tenth Imám (d. 254/868). The name al-
Hasan may be applied to both the second Imám (d. 50/670) and the eleventh (d. 260/873–4). The result is that
although there are fourteen different personalities involved, it may be said that there are in reality only seven
different names. That the Báb has chosen to associate each verse with one of these seven names has, as will be seen,
implications for the way in which He understood one of the more common names for this súra, namely, al-sab‘ al-
mathání (“The seven oft repeated” or “the seven doubled”) (cf. Q. 15/87), the meaning of which is disputed by the
classical exegetes.20 Later in the commentary, the Báb states that one of the results of the process of creation is that
seven becomes fourteen.21 Thus this opening chapter, which is also known as the “Mother of the Book” (umm al-
kitáb) because in it is contained the essence of the entire Qur’án, may be likened to the divine will which, in Shaykhí
thought, is represented by the pleroma of the Holy Family and may be understood as containing, in potentia, all
creation.22

One of the main concerns of this tafsír is in fact the propounding of this particular metaphysical notion.

This, together with the method adopted for such—constant reference to the Holy Family as the principle of this
process—is the most distinctive and distinguishing feature of the work and may be designated by the rather
awkward term “imamization.” It is unlikely that this represents, at the time and place it was written, a polemic in the
context of an immediate Sunní–Shí‘í debate.23 Rather, it would seem that this method of interpretation is linked to at
least two factors. The first is that it reflects the extreme veneration in which the Imams were held by the Shaykhís,24
and, of course, the Shaykhí influence on the author of this work. But perhaps more important, especially for
understanding the eventual development of the Báb’s teaching, it allows the Báb to assert his complete
independence from all others, including Shaykh Ahmad and Siyyid Kázim (who are not mentioned in the main body
of the tafsír 25), apart from the Holy Family, and, of course, the Qur’án itself.

A ready example of this allegorical method is found at Q. 2/26: “God is not ashamed to strike a similitude
even of a gnat, or aught above it.”26 Here the “gnat” is explained as being ‘Alí Himself, while “aught above it,” má
fawqahá, is none other than Muhammad. This interpretation is not new with the Báb; it is found in at least three
other well-known Shí‘í commentaries where it is ascribed to the sixth Imam, Ja‘far al-Sádiq. Unlike his practice in
similar instances in the commentary, the Báb cites no isnád here. The adoption of this interpretation must therefore
be seen as an example of the abundantly attested and universally approved process of selection from the overall
tradition (rather than “creation”) as a means of offering an “original” interpretation, which is so characteristic of
Muslim religious scholarship.27 That the Báb was creative in the modem sense as well will be seen in what follows.

A more extended allegory is found at Q. 2/49–51 in the Báb’s reading of the story of Moses in the
wilderness with his troublesome retinue:

(49) And when We delivered you from the folk of Pharaoh who were visiting you with evil chastisement,

slaughtering your sons, and sparing your women; and in that was a grievous trial from your Lord. (50) And
> when We divided for you the sea and delivered you, and drowned Pharaoh’s folk while you were
> beholding. (51) And when We appointed with Moses forty nights then you took to yourselves the Calf after
> him and you were evildoers ....

The Báb says verse 49 is being addressed to (mukhátabatanli-) Fátimih, her husband, and her father.28

“Pharaoh” stands for “Abú‘l-Shurúr”29 while his “folk” stands for “wherever kufr, shirk or sharr exist, because these
are the various places where he appears (mazáhir nafsihi).” In this place the specific reference is to Yazíd, the
Umayyad caliph responsible for the killing of Husayn, while “slaughtering of your sons” is a direct reference to “the
sons of the Messenger and their lord, Abú‘Abd Alláh al-Husayn” (the third Imám).

At this point, the Báb embarks upon a rather lengthy discussion to justify why God would allow such a
heinous deed as the murder of one of the Holy Family to take place. During the course of this discussion, the Báb
compares the killing of Husayn with the sin of Adam. The main point seems to be that this apparent victory of evil
over goodness, the murder of an Imám, was not due to any weakness in Husayn. On the contrary, the Imám, because
of the strength of his perfect (mu‘tadil: “harmonious”) body, would have been able to destroy the whole world had
such been the divine purpose. At verse 50 the “sea” is the “sea of divine power.” Those being addressed are the
“People of Infallibility” (ahl al‘isma), another name for the Holy Family. “The meaning of the second ‘Pharaoh’,”
says the Báb, “is the one who rejected the signs of ‘Alí, upon him be peace, which exists in all things.” “Moses,” at
verse 51, “according to the primary meaning (fa’l-murád bi’ l-haqíqat al-awwalíya) is Muhammad.” “Forty” is
understood as referring to ‘Alí and the ten proofs (hujaj) from his progeny. The Báb explains as follows: “‘Alí
stands for thirty since he lived for thirty years after the death of Muhammad. ‘Forty’ is arrived at when reference is
made to the ten remaining Imáms (who were allowed to fulfil their mission, the mission of the last or twelfth Imam
being at this time still incomplete and therefore the number ‘ten’ would not pertain to the length of time spent in the
wilderness precisely because the parousia of the last Imám will signal the end of this spiritual banishment).”30 But
“nights” alludes to the concealment of the glory of the Imáms by the darkness of disbelief.

This section is concluded with a reference to the qá’im, whose return will cause all that has been alluded to
in the foregoing to appear (TBA 179–84). This is an example of the idea that each divine manifestation (zuhúr) sets
in motion a replay of the major events of a kind of primal sacred history. Later, in some of his other writings, the
Báb refers to his very first followers, the eighteen “Letters of the Living,” as the reappearance of the fourteen Pure
Ones and the four abwáb—those leaders of the Shí’a who are believed to have been in contact with the Hidden
Imam Muhammad ibn al-Hasan during to so-called Lesser Occultation (MacEoin, “Charismatic” 146; Shoghi
Effendi, God Passes By 32).

In the course of this interpretation, the Báb alludes to the metaphysics from which it ultimately springs.

Repeated reference is made, for example, to the process of divine self-manifestation—tajallí. Once again, the
commentary on súrat al-fátiha provides a characteristic example. The third verse of the opening súra is
characterized by the Báb as the “book (kitáb) of Fátimih.” He continues by saying that

> God has put in it all that is hers and all that pertains to her. This verse is the Garden of Grace. God has
> provided its shade for whoever believes in her and loves her after he has properly recognized her—
> according to what she manifested to him (li’l- ‘arif) by means of his own capacity for understanding. At
> this time this Garden will open to him.31

The operative phrase here is: kamá tajallat Ii’1-‘árif lahu bihi.32 An interesting parallel to this usage is found in the
Fusús al-hikám of the great mystic Ibn ‘Arabi. Here the author discusses tajallí or the way in which God makes
Himself known to humanity, with these words: fa-wasafa nafsahu laná biná, “He has described Himself to us by
means of us,” or, less concisely: “He has described Himself to us by means of our own ability and willingness to
perceive His description”(lbn al-‘Arabi, Fusús al-hikam 1:53). It is not intended to go into great detail here on the
relation of the Báb’s thought to that of Ibn ‘Arabi, nor is it intended to go into great detail about the nature of the
Báb’s thought per se; attention is drawn to this subject only by way of indicating the kinds of ideas that find
expression during the task the Báb has set for Himself (and which is the subject of this discussion), namely, the
interpretation of the Qur’án. Suffice it to say that here both the Báb and Ibn ‘Arabi appear to rely on Q. 41/53 for the
ultimate justification of such a view: “We shall show them Our signs in the horizons and in themselves, till it is clear
to them that it is the truth.” The frequency with which this idea is encountered in the Tafsír súrat al-baqara throws
into sharp relief the curious fact that there seems to be no mention of it at all, at least in the above terms, in the
Tafsír súrat Yúsuf.

This metaphysics is also related to ethical concerns .in one interesting passage of the commentary on súrat
al-baqar, ad.Q. 2/3: “[Those] who believe in the Unseen, and perform the prayer, and expend of that We have
provided them.” Here the Báb chooses to comment on the significance of “faith” (imán) represented in the above
citation by the verb “believe.” In his introductory remarks to this lengthy section He says the following:

> If man knew how God had created His creation, no one would ever blame another.33 This means that God
> has created mankind (khalq) according to the creature’s already existing propensities for acceptance or
> rejection [of the truth]. The cause of rejection is the same as the cause of acceptance, namely, choice
> (ikhtiyár). God has given to each what he deserves according to his already existing propensity (bi-má
> huwa ‘alayhi). This divine knowledge is the knowledge of potentialities. (TBA 22)

The object of the discussion is an extended treatment of the problems surrounding the perennial mystery posed
by the ideas of an individual’s free will and God’s role in determining a person’s fate. Once again, statements of the
Báb appear to have much in common with the views of Ibn ‘Arabí, in particular his notoriously difficult idea of al-
‘ayán al-thábita.34 It is probably the case here, as in the above comparison with Ibn ‘Arabi, that these coincidences
are due more to the traces of Ibn ‘Arabi’s thought existing in the teaching of the Shaykhís (which, as has been said,
is acknowledged to be of the single most formative influence on the way on which the Báb expressed his ideas) than
to any direct borrowing by the Báb from Ibn ‘Arabí himself. Indeed, in one of his later tafsír, the Báb makes it clear
that He does not agree with Ibn ‘Arabí at all on at least one point.35

Continuing with the Báb’s commentary on this same verse, we are soon in the presence of another major
pattern in the work. The importance of the number seven has already been mentioned and briefly illustrated; a few
more brief examples are added here for emphasis.

In his discussion of imán, the Báb speaks of seven different levels or grades (marátib). The first is applied
to the people of the garden, or paradise, of the Divine Will (ahl jannat al-mashíya). The remaining six grades are
respectively applicable to the people of the heaven of the Divine Purpose (al-iráda), the sea of the Divine Decree
(bahr al-qadr), Eden (‘adn), Divine Permission (idhn), Eternity (khuld), and finally Refuge, or Repose (ma’wá).
Other examples of this seven-fold structure of spirituality may be found in the tafsír at Q. 2/1 where eight gardens,
or paradises, and seven hells are described. Here, each hell is but the shadow of the heaven above it. The reason that
there are only seven is because the highest heaven casts no shadow, in fact, it is completely isolated from the rest of
the structure. The highest heaven represents the Absolute of this apophatic theological model.36 At Q. 2/2 we are
introduced to seven classes of people (TBA 14); at Q. 2/5 we read of seven different grades of lordship (rubúbíya)
(TBA 38–40). A final example is at Q. 2/22, where seven heavens and seven earths are enumerated (TBA 81–82).
Another example of the Báb’s exegesis may be taken once again from Q. 2/3, which is divided into two parts for the
purposes of the commentary: “[Those] who believe in the Unseen, and perform the prayer.” Ghayb (“Unseen”) is
interpreted in the following way. The Báb says that it represents Muhammad because He is truly known only by
Himself, and only God knows his true nature (kunh). The particular place (wa mahall tafsíl hádhá’l-ghayb37) is none
other than the currently concealed Qá’ím, Muhammad ibn al-Hasan. The Báb then quotes a tradition from the sixth
Imam Ja‘far al-Sádiq wherein several stages of ghayb are enumerated (TBA 23-24). It has already been explained
how for the Báb, who at the time of writing this particular commentary was making use of the terminology and
thought of the Shaykhís38; the number seven represents the totality of the Holy Family. While it may be of some
interest to try to determine other influences apart from the Shaykhí school, to insist on such would be to miss this
most important point. One of the more pertinent lessons to be learned here, it would seem, is how the number seven
can have importance for both the Ithná ‘Asharíya (“Twelvers”) and the so-called Sab’íiya (“Seveners”), or the
Ismá‘ílíya.39

To conclude this somewhat random sampling from this earliest of the Báb’s commentaries, attention will
be paid to his reading of the word salát (prayer, divine service) in this same verse, Q. 2/3. First of all, its
performance symbolizes obedience to Muhammad and his legatees and progeny—which in turn represents absolute
guardianship (waláya). From the beginning to the end of its performance, it is the “form of divine aloneness” (súrat
al-tafríd), the shape of divine unity (haykal al-tawhíd), and the “outward representation of love or allegiance”
(shabah al-waláya). However, none but Muhammad and his Family performs it properly, because salát is the
foremost station of distinction between the lover and the Beloved (God). The Holy Family is the collective bearer of
this love and as such is the object of the famous hadíth qudsí, “I was a hidden treasure and desired to be known,
therefore I created mankind [khalq here refers specifically to Imáms, according to the Báb’s interpretation] in order
to be known.” Thus it is through the Imám that “lordship” (rubúbíya) appeared and “servitude” (marbúbíya) was
perfected. The perfect performance of salát by the Imáms is therefore an ability or quality directly from God (wasf
Alláh) which they have been endowed with by means of their own innate capacities (lahum bihim), while in the case
of others who perform the salát, this ability comes from the Imáms. This is a perfect example of the Shaykhí
imamology referred to above.40

The Báb then states that the Imáms are in fact the seven mathání. This becomes clear when the worshipper
recites the fátiha, in each verse of which God has described one of the Holy Family by means of the tongue of the
servant, who, in the course of two prostrations, will have uttered the seven verses of the fátiha twice, which is, of
course, an affirmation of the sanctity of the Fourteen Pure Ones. If the prayer is performed in this spirit, then the
worshipper has succeeded in performing it as properly as he or she can. The prayer has then become a meeting with
the Beloved and the Face of the worshipped One—a true means of spiritual elevation, mi’ráj, for the individual
believer.41

Having briefly examined the Báb’s very early work, which, it must be remembered, was written before his
declaration in which He claimed special spiritual authority and is therefore concerned more with the Shí’í tradition
than with any new system, we will now turn to a tafsír of a very different order.

ii. Tafsír súrat Yúsuf
Approximately four months after the completion of the commentary on súra 2, the Báb began his commentary on
the quranic story of Joseph (súra 12). This tafsír is utterly different in all of its aspects from the Tafsír súrat al-
baqara. Unlike the previous commentary, this work contains no direct references to doctrinal discussions on such
important Shaykhí topics as the Fourth Support, and no architectonic metaphysical representations.42 Although
allegory and typological exegesis are still among the chief methods of the actual interpretation, they are of a
somewhat different character. Indeed, direct interpretation of the verses represents only a portion of the material. In
one way, the work is much more structured, taking as its model the Qur’án in its use of súra divisions, and in
another way it is much less “logical,” in that it is difficult many times to see just how the text is tied to the quranic
material itself. It is also a very long work and one in which a variety of concerns, images, terminology, laws,
exhortations, and prayers are presented. Interestingly, there seem to be no hadíth. What is offered in the next few
pages is merely a very brief description of the work. The intention is to give some idea of the kinds of problems the
tafsír presents to the student of the history of Qur’án commentary, to point out the dramatic difference between the
two works that are the subject of this discussion, and to make some very general conclusions.

The Tafsír súrat Yúsuf also known widely as the Qayyúm u’I-Asmá43 and the Ahsan al-qasas, which is of
course the name that the Qur’án gives to the súra of Joseph (Q. 12/3), was described in some detail by Rosen in
1877 and discussed by Browne in 1889 and again in 1892.44 Since then, it has received a certain amount of attention
from scholars concerned chiefly with the social history of the Bábí movement.45 Several manuscripts of the work
exist, two of which have been consulted for the purposes of this study.46 The older of the two, and perhaps therefore
the most reliable, was transcribed in 1261AH/AD1845 and differs from the later manuscript in many details. The
work itself is quite long, the manuscript of 1261 running to 234 pages, with each 9.5 x 17.5 cm.47 page bearing 25
lines of closely written text; this copy is today found in Haifa.

The text is modelled after the Qur’án, with its use of disconnected introductory letters, súra divisions, and
verse divisions. In fact, the older Haifa manuscript, in imitation of the sajdat al-tiláwa tradition in the Qur’án,
carries the instruction sajda wájiba at various places on the margin of the text where the word sajada or some
derivative occurs, to indicate that a prostration should be performed while reading the particular verse. In addition,
the Haifa manuscript supplies at the head of the 111 súras (each chapter of the commentary is called a súra by the
Báb) the number of verses, which in this manuscript is invariably forty-two, and the Cambridge manuscript, where
the verses number forty, indicates the place of revelation, which is invariably Shíráz.48 The number of verses is
thought to represent the abjad value of the word balá, which according to the Qur’án, was the word used to convey
humanity’s ascent to the primordial divine covenant (Q. 7/172).49

Immediately following this comparatively technical information comes the standard Islamic basmala: “In
the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.” This occurs without exception at the beginning of each chapter
and is followed by the verse from the Qur’án that is to be the subject of the commentary. However, the first súra of
the tafsír does not contain such a citation and is anyway of a slightly different order from the rest, being something
of an introduction.

Continuing this imitation of the form of the Qur’án, the Báb has placed between the áya to be commented upon
the main text of each súra (except four50), a series of disconnected letters, some of which are quranic. Thus, chapter
3, súrat al-imán, bears the two letters tá’ -há’, while the súra immediately following, al-madína, carries the
unquranic alif-lám-mím- tá’ -há’. While the vast majority of these sets of letters must remain at this stage somewhat
mysterious, it is interesting to note that at the head or súras 108 and 109, the following combinations occur: ‘ayn-
lam- yá’ and mím-há’ -mím-dál, giving the names ‘Alí and Muhammad. The titles of these two súras are
respectively al-dhikr and al-‘abd, both of which represent titles assumed by the Báb in the course of his commentary
(QA 223 and 225, respectively). It is likely, therefore, that these two names pertain first of all to the Báb Himself

(Siyyid ‘Alí Muhammad) and indirectly to the first Imám and the Prophet Muhammad. Needless to say, the
ambiguity was no accident.

Following the disconnected letters, there are usually one or perhaps two verses (terminations of which are
marked in QA by the typical quranic versemarker, an independent há’ marbútá, and in the Cambridge manuscript by
means of a space), which offer some variation on the frequent quranic introductory formula: dhálika al-kitáb ... (Q.
2/2), or kitabun unzila ilayka ... (Q. 7/2), which has been shown to be one of the common elements shared by those
suwar that bear disconnected letters (Welch, ‘af-Kur’án, E/2 v, 414a). A few examples will serve as illustrations.

Sura 1, al-mulk, begins after the title material described above and the respective quranic verse as follows:

> (1) al-hamdu li-lláh alladhí nazza/a al-kitáb ‘alá ‘abdihi bi’ l-haqq li-yakúna li’l-‘al/amín sirájan
> wahhájan. (QA 3)

> Súra 2, al-‘u/amá’: (I) alif lám mím, dhálika al-kitáb min ‘imdi Alláh, al-haqq fí shán al-dhikr qad kána bi’
> l-haqq hawl al-nár’ manzúlan; (2) wa inna nahnu qad ja‘alná’l-dhálika’ l-kitáb mubínan [sic]. (QA 5)

> Súra 3. al-imán: (1) tá’ -há’; (2) Alláh qad anzala al-Qur’án ‘alá ‘abdihi li-ya‘lama al-nas anna Alláh qad
> kána ‘alá kulli shay’ qadíran. (QA 6)

> Súra 37, al-ta‘bír: (1) fa’ ‘ayn sín nún; (2) al-hamdu li-lláh alladhí anzala ‘alá ‘abdihi al-kitáb li-yakúna
> ‘alá’ l-‘alamin bi’l-kalimat al-‘alí shahídan. (QA 67)

The slightly variant súra 59, aI-af’ ida, just as one example, has the following, which is however still
concerned with the way God communicates to humanity:

> (1) káf há’ ‘ayn sád; (2) Alláh qad akhbará’ 1- ibád bi’l-ism al-akbar: an lá iláh illá huwa al-hayy al-
> qayyúm. (QA 116)

Finally, the example of sura 111, al-mu’minin, is offered by way of emphasizing the more or less standard
pattern that obtains throughout the work:

> (1) alif lám mím; (2) inná nahnu qad ja‘alná baynakum wa bayna al-qurá’l-mubáraka min ba’d al-báb
> hádhá unásun táhirín yad’úna al-nás ilá dín Alláh al-akbar wa lá yakháfúna min dún Alláh al-haqq ‘an
> shay’, ulá’ika hum qad kánú ashab al-ridwán fí umm al-kitáb maktúban; (3) wa inná nahnu qad ja‘alná
> hádhá’I-kitáb áyát li-ulí al-albáb alladhína yusabbihúna al-layl wa’l·nahár wa lá yafturúna [cf. Q. 21/20]
> min amr Alláh al-haqq min laday al-báb ‘alá dharra min ba‘d al-shay’ qitmíran. (QA 231)

This then gives some idea of the Báb’s conscious desire to make his tafsír structurally resemble or
“imitate” the Qur’an. It is doubtful whether one of the reasons súra 12 was chosen was because the number of its
verses closely approximates the total number of quranic suwar,51 although the effect of this coincidence was
undoubtedly not lost upon the readers of the commentary. The quranic story of Joseph is a favorite among Muslims
because it contains within the confines of a single sustained narrative many subjects of importance to Islam,
including its link with past religions.52 The súra had also been the subject of earlier commentaries and elaborations;
thus, the renowned Abú Hamíd al-Ghazzálí (d. 505/1111) composed a somewhat mystical tafsír on this súra.53

The great mystic Ibn ‘Arabí also took up the quranic Joseph in his Fusús al-hikam as a basis for his
discussion of the spiritual imagination (1:99-106). It would seem also that the choice of the súrat Yúsuf as the
subject of this commentary of the Báb is connected with a long tradition that reveres the story of Joseph as
representing the spiritual mystery of taqíya, or cautious concealment, which is so important to Shí’í religiosity in
general,54 and Shaykhí religious thinking in particular. According to Nabíl, Mullá Husayn, the young Shaykhí who
was the first to accept the Báb’s claim, had once asked the Shaykhí leader Siyyid Kázim Rashtí to write a
commentary on súrat Yúsuf. His teacher responded that such a task was beyond his abilities but that the “great One,
who comes after me will, unasked, reveal it for you. That commentary will constitute one of the weightiest
testimonies of His truth, and one of the clearest evidences of the loftiness of His position”(Nabíl, 59). Rashtí’s
response here would appear to be conditioned by numerous hadíths which say that the qá’ím will resemble Joseph in
several respects.55 Throughout the Báb’s commentary it seems clear that He is seeing Himself as Joseph, in that the
quranic story is read as a prefigurement, however allegorical, of the Báb’s own mission.

After the disconnected letters and the above-mentioned introductory verses that claim divine revelation, the
next section of a given súra begins. This section is most difficult to characterize because of the variety of concerns
that may appear in it. Generally speaking, the last section of a súra is where the Báb turns his attention directly to
the verse of the Qur’án under which his commentary is written. The method of exegesis, then, is usually simple
paraphrase of the Qur’án in which the Báb makes various substitutions with words that give a meaning much more
specific to his own claims and situation. In the course of his exegesis, there is never recourse to the usual markers of
an interpretative statement such as ay or ya’ní (“that is”), or aqúlu (“I say”). Rather, the exegetical equivalences are
offered by the Báb as much closer to the quranic material than would be the case if the above words, along with the
semantic distance to be travelled that their use implies, were used.56 Before giving examples of this kind of
commentary, it may be of interest to discuss in some detail the first súra of the tafsír.

The súrat al-mulk, which is in fact the part of the work that was written in the presence of Mullá Husayn on
the night of 22 May 1844, forms a kind of introduction to the whole and is unusual in that it is not written under a
verse of Qur’án súra 12. Evidence that it is indeed part of a commentary on the Qur’án does not occur until well into
the text, where the following statement is found:

> God hath decreed that this book, in explanation (fí tafsír) of the ‘best of stories’ ... should come forth from
> Muhammad, son of Hasan, son of ‘Alí, son of Músá, son of Ja‘far, son of Muhammad, son of ‘Alí, son of
> Husayn, son of ‘Alí, son of Abú Tálib, unto his servant [the Báb] that it may be proof of God on the part of
> the Remembrance (dhikr) reaching the two worlds. (Trans. Browne, JRAS 2 [ [1889]: 908)

The title of this súra is related to the fact that the entire chapter, rather than dealing with subjects connected to an
understanding of the twelfth chapter of the Qur’an, is a sustained and impassioned challenge first to Muhammad
Sháh, the reigning monarch of Iran at that time, and then to his Prime Minister, Hájí Mírzá Aqásí, to submit to the
command of the Remembrance (dhikr, that is, the Báb). In the course of this súra we see several elements that are,
however, characteristic of the whole book. The first of these is the proclamation of the Báb’s spiritual rank, either as
Báb or dhikr, to name only two of the several different designations used throughout the text.57 Then there are the
fluent paraphrases of the Qur’án, the call to absolute obedience, the summons to the world beyond Iran, the
reference to laws (ahkám), the language, and the imagery, which is striking in the extreme. An example of this last is
the Báb’s juxtaposition of opposites. In the súrat al-mulk, one reads, for example: inna al-nár fí nuqtati’ 1má’ li’lláh
al-haqq sájidan ‘alá’l-ard (“the fire which is in the drop of water is itself prostrate upon the earth before God, the
Reality”).58 This may, of course, be a simple case of an echo of basic alchemical imagery, particularly in this
instance; in later suwar, however, this combining of opposites appears to take on original characteristics that seem to
somehow designate the source of the Báb’s inspiration.59

This third section of a given súra may also consist of a running exegetical paraphrase of extended sections
of the Qur’án. For example, chapters 52 and 53, al-fadl and al-sabr (QA 100–105) present a detailed rewriting of the
first fifty or so verses of the second súra of the Qur’án, al-baqara.

At Q. 2/2–5, for example, we have:

Qur’án                                                          The Báb
That is the Book wherein is no doubt, a guidance to             By thy Lord! Thou [the Hidden Imám and, by
the godfearing who believe in the Unseen, and per-              implication, the Báb Himself] art the Book wherein
form the prayer, and expend of that We have                     there is no doubt, and thou art praiseworthy in the
provided them; who believe in what has been sent                estimation of God. Those who believe in the
down to thee and what has been sent down before                 Remembrance of God, in his ghayba, and rule among
thee, and have faith in the Hereafter; those are upon           mankind with truth by means of his verses, We will,
guidance from their Lord, those are the ones who                in very truth,60 bestow upon them, as a blessing from
prosper.                                                        Our side, a great reward. Those are upon a guidance

> with the Remembrance of God, and those are the
> ones who hastened first, in truth, in the Book of God.

(QA 100)
Another more extended example of this running paraphrase may be found in súras 80 to 95 inclusive (QA
160–95), which treat most of the quranic material from Q. 10/57 up to the first few verses of Q. 17. A random
example in the Báb’s rewriting of Q. 10/87.

Qur’án                                                           The Báb
And We revealed to Moses and his brother, ‘Take                  And We revealed to Moses and his brother, “Take
you, for your people, in Egypt certain houses; and               you, [or ‘set aside’] in the Egypt of the hearts, for the
make your houses a direction for men to pray to; and             people of the earth, houses consecrated to the exclu-
perform the prayer; and do thou give good tidings to             sive unity (ahadíya) of the Most Great Remembrance
the believers. ‘                                                 of God, the Living, and He is God, the Knowing, the

> Judge. And verily God made them [houses] a
> direction for men to pray to, and to perform all the
> prayers in, so give good tidings to the sincere
> servants of God.” (QA 161)

As mentioned above, the fourth section of a given súra usually returns to the verse of the Qur’án under which it is
written. The method again is paraphrase, of which the last two of the following three examples are characteristic.
The second chapter, súrat al-‘ulamá’, is written under Qur’án 12/1, ‘alif-lam-rá’; “these are the verses of the
Manifest Book.” The passage thus ends with a commentary on these three disconnected letters. The Báb says that
God created the letter alif, to represent that servant of his [the Báb Himself?] who is strong in the divine cause
(amr). The letter lám signifies the ascendancy of his rule over the rule of the book [the Qur’an?]. The letter rá’ was
made by God for the spreading (inbisat) of his Cause according to the way it has been ordained in the Mother of the
Book.

Súra 71, al-qalam, is written under Qur’án 12/70: “Then when he had equipped them with their equipment,
he put his drinking-cup into the saddlebag of his brother. Then a herald proclaimed, ‘Ho, cameleers, you are
robbers!’” The Báb’s paraphrase of the verse is as follows:

> Verily, We command the angels to place the drinking-cup of the Remembrance in the saddlebag of the
> believers, by the leave of God, the Exalted, and God is Knower of all things. O crier (al-mu’ adhdhin), cry
> out! O camel-riders, you are robbers. Indeed the cup of the Remembrance is concealed from you in the
> highest station, in very truth. And God is the Preserver of all things. And God is powerful over all things.

(QA 145)

The metaphors in the above commentary (drinking-cup/Remembrance; saddlebag/believers) are similar to
the previously cited “Egypt of the hearts.” In this instance, however, they refer to a subject raised in the Tafsír súrat
al-baqara, namely one’s innate, and in a sense predetermined, capacity for accepting or rejecting the Imám as the
locus of divinity, in this case represented by the Báb. The believers are therefore privileged to be so because they
hold within themselves the “signs” of Remembrance, here represented by “drinking-cup.” Likewise, the “robbers”
are prevented from accepting the truth because these signs have been withheld from them.61

The súrat al-hajj, number 103, is written under Qur’án 12/102: “That is of the tidings of the Unseen that
We reveal to thee; thou wast not with them when they agreed upon their plan, devising.” The Báb’s paraphrase is as
follows:

> This (dhálika) tafsír is of the tidings of al-‘amá, written upon the leaf of the heart by the permission of
> God, the Exalted, in the vicinity of the sacred fire. Verily, God has revealed to you the tidings of the
> Unseen while you were the most Great Truth, when their word conflicted, lying. God is, in very truth,
> Witness over you.62

The examples of the textual concerns of Tafsír súrat Yúsuf provided here, along with the general
description of the work, are sufficient to make possible a few very general observations. While it is clear that the
work is most unusual vis-á-vis the tafsír tradition, or for that matter any other genre of Arabic literature, it would
appear that by categorizing the work as tafsír the author wished it to be read and judged in this context. This, of
course, raises the question of what in fact distinguishes tafsír from other types of literature. It should not be assumed
that since the Báb was not a typical religious scholar, He was therefore unaware of the standard works of tafsír63 or
that he thought this work of his should be received as a continuation of the tradition. Rather, the contrary would

seem to be the case, particularly in view of the earlier Tafsír súrat al-baqara, which, however different from the
main sources of orthodox Shí’í Qur’án commentary it may be, exhibits many of the usual approaches and methods
found in those works. In composing the later commentary, the Báb was attempting a break with a tradition He
perceived as moribund, particularly so in the context of the advent of a new order of which He Himself claimed to
be the herald. In addition, there seems to have been a certain amount of eschatological expectation centred on the
appearance of one who would produce a commentary on the twelfth súra of the Qur’án.

Browne’s statements that the work is inappropriately titled notwithstanding, it is abundantly clear that it not
only offers interpretative statements on the súra of Joseph but also comments on a large portion of the rest of the
Qur’án in the process, albeit usually by means of paraphrase. Unusual, there is no doubt. To say that it is not
interpretative or that it does not make clear what the Qur’án meant, at least to the Báb, is either not to have read it or
to have imposed too rigid a notion about what constitutes tafsír, which is after all fundamentally only “explanation.”
Given the method of allegorical and typological exegesis that is fluently and ceaselessly expressed in the constant
use of such rhetorical devices as metaphor and simile, in addition to the “heresy of paraphrase” and the exploitation
of ambiguity—all of which have been cast in an unabashed imitation of the Qur’án64—the work is clearly one of
interpretation. The Qayyúm u’l-Asmá’ is the result of a re-ordering of the basic elements of the scripture of Islam
that have been fully internalized and transformed by the apparently opposite processes of imitation and inspiration to
become finally an original “act” of literature. Taken as a whole, this remarkable work of the 25-year-old merchant
from Shíraz, representing as it does a text within a text that strives to interpret itself, offers a concrete and literary
example of a singularly heroic attempt to transform what became known much later, and in a culture quite alien to
his own, as the hermeneutic circle,65 into a hermeneutic spiral.

By comparing these two works, which were written at about the same time, we see how differently the act
of interpretation, yet springing from the same source, is capable of expressing itself. And with the second work, we
not only have a new example for the history of tafsír but (because the work itself is a call to action) also the rather
startling example of tafsír directly affecting history—in a sense, becoming history.66

Microfilms, Ann Arbor, hereafter: MacEoin, “Charismatic” 137-42. Another important discussion of the problems
associated with the biography of the Báb, is Stephen Lambden, “An Episode in the Childhood of Sayyid Ali
Muhammad the Báb,” in Peter Smith. ed., In Iran: Studies in Bábí and Bahá’í History 3:1–3 1

5. The Báb’s statement, cited by MacEoin, “Charismatic” 138, that a dog belonging to a Jew is to be
preferred to the people of the bazaar because of the latter’s lack of religious devotion, must be seen as an indictment
of the people themselves, not their occupation.

6. Opinion is divided on just how long the Báb stayed in Karbalá’, where Siyyid Kázim held his classes.
The discussion appears rooted in polemic; sources favorable to the Báb prefer a shorter length of time.

7. See, for example, A.-L.-M. Nicolas, Seyyed Alí Mohammed dit le Báb 234.
8. There is some disagreement about the exact date; see Moojan Momen, cd., The Bábí and Bahá’í
Religions, 1844-1944: Some Contemporary Western Accounts 77–82.

9. The two works are Risála al-sulúk and Tafsír súrat al-baqara; they are, as it happens, probably the two
earliest of the Báb’s works remaining to us.

10. The most recent detailed account of the Shaykhíya is: Vahid Rafati, “The Development of Shaykhí
Thought in Shí‘í Islam.” Other important discussions of this subject are: Said Amir Arjomand, The Shadow of God
and the Hidden Imam: Religion, Political Order and Societal Change in Shi‘ite Iran from the Beginning to 1890, see
index, “Shaykhism”; Mangol Bayat, Mysticism and Dissent: Socioreligious Thought in Qajar Iran 37–58; Henri
Corbin, En Islam iranien 4:205–300. See also Abbas Amanat, Resurrection and Renewal 48–69.

11. Concern with the doctrine of the Fourth Support is, therefore, one of the most convincing evidences that
the Báb was writing his first tafsír in a Shaykhí milieu. Early in his commentary on súrat al-baqara He says that the
Fourth Support is, in fact, the main body of the Shi‘a. That the Báb understood the Fourth Support in this way is also
evidence that at this time He either did not harbor any claims to the special spiritual authority implied by other uses
of this term, or He did not want to be perceived as doing so. Compare with the way in which later Shaykhís were to
eventually discuss the idea of the Fourth Support (viz., as ecclesia spiritualis), in Corbin, En Islam iranien 4:274–
86, esp. 285. Also see D. MacEoin, “Early Shaykhí Reactions to the Báb and his Claims,” in M. Momen, Studies in
Bábí and Bahá’í History 1:1–42.

> 12. See Oliver Leamas, An Introduclion to Medieval Islamic Philosophy 17.

13. This statement must be tempered by reference to the innumerable assertions of the servitude of
Muhammad and the Imáms to the essence of God. It would be misleading in the extreme to suggest incarnationism.
See a characteristic statement on this question by the Báb in his Risálah-ye i‘tiqadál in Majmú‘ah-yi athár-yi hazzat-
i A’lá, Iran National Bahá’í Archives, Tehran, 69:411–16.

14. Rafati, 48–49. For a helpful summary of the points that came to be regarded as representing the most
important differences between the Shaykhís and the Shí‘a, see Moojan Momen, An Introduction to Shí‘í Islam: The
History and Doctrines of Twelver Shi‘ism 226–28; on the importance of the doctrine of the Perfect Shí‘a, see
Browne, “Báb, Bábís,” Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics.

> 15. See note 2 above.

16. The other two works deserve some brief mention at this time, inasmuch as they both exhibit one of the
more distinctive exegetical procedures or the Báb, and one which is not applied by Him to the two suwar under
detailed discussion here. Both of Suwar 108 and 103, which are among the shortest chapters in the Qur’án, are
explained by the Báb not verse by verse, or even word by word, but rather letter by letter. In this way, the quranic
material is “exploded” by the commentator in an attempt to mine it for as much meaning as possible. See B.T.
Lawson, “Exploded Commentary,” paper presented at the American Academy of Religion Annual Meeting,
Anaheim, California, 1985, for a study of this method and its antecedents, hurúfí, súfi, and others.

17. Numerous manuscripts of this work, which represents a commentary on the complete first juz’ of the
Qur’án, exist; five copies have been consulted for this discussion: Cambridge, Brown F. 8; Teheran Bahá’í Archives
6014 C (hereafter: TBA); the privately published limited edition, in photocopy, found in Majmú‘ah-yi athár-yi
hazzat-i A’lá, Iran National Bahá’í Archives, 69 (1976): 157–4l0; two uncatalogued manuscripts in the Princeton
University “Bábí Collection.” Many thanks to Mr. James Weinberger, curator of the Near Eastern Collection,
Princeton University, for access to these last two items. All references in this paper, are to TBA (which has been
paginated in a photocopy).

A word should also be said about the notorious vol. ii or the Tafsír súrat al-baqara. According to Nicolas
(n. 7 above), this was among those works by the Báb that were stolen from Him during his pilgrimage (see pp. 45–
46). However, MacEoin, “Critical” 36, lists a manuscript of the Biblioteque Nationale which he says may be this
missing volume. An examination of BN Or. 5805 indeed discloses that it is a commentary on the second juz’ of the
Qur’án. At this time, however, it is not possible to ascribe its authorship to the Báb with complete confidence. The
manuscript in the British Library (BL Or7845) is a similar case. Finally, a few pages of a commentary on this
second juz’ are found in the Majmú‘a (mentioned above) 377–4l0. There seem to be some important stylistic
differences between this material and the preceding tafsír, one example being a much more frequent use of the first
person.

18. See the Táríkh-i-jadíd as quoted by E. G. Browne, “Catalogue and Description of 27 Bábí Manuscripts”

\[496\] 19. The question, often raised, of Ismá’ílí (“Seveners”) influence on the Báb is probably best answered by
emphasizing the importance of Shaykhí influence on his writings (see Rafati, 167). The better question to ask would
be about the Ismá’ílí influences on the writings of Shaykh Ahmad and the later elaboration of his school, especially

by Siyyid Kázim Rashtí. To quote a recent treatment of this problem: “The Babi movement derived both its
theoretical formulation and its converts more from Shaykhism than from any other school. Such a continuity in
esoteric thought can be best appreciated when Shaykhism in itself is considered as the final outcome of a fusion of
three major trends in post-Safavid Shi’ism: (1) the Sadrá’í theosophic school of Isfahan, which itself benefited from
the theoretical Sufism of Ibn ‘Arabi, as well as the illuminist theosophy of Suhravardí; (2) the Akhbári Traditionist
school of Bahrain, which traced its chain of transmission to the early narrators of hadíth and (3) the diffuse
gnosticism that was strongly influenced by crypto-Ismá’ílí ideas as well as other heterodoxies of southern and
southwestern Iran” (Amanat, 48). It would appear that Browne’s advice and hope, written nearly one hundred years
ago, that “a full and critical study of the Shaykhí doctrines would ... form an indispensable preliminary to such a
philosophical history of the Bábís as must some day be written” (Browne, Encyclopedia) remains to be completely
acted upon.

20. See below, pp. 31–32; also see Mahmoud Ayoub. “The Prayer of Islam: A Presentation of súrat al-
fátiha in Muslim Exegesis,” Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Thematic Issue 635–47, esp. 638.

21. TBA 112–13, ad Q. 2/29: “It is He who created for you all that is in the earth, then He lifted Himself to
heaven and levelled them the seven heavens; and He has knowledge of everything.” The Báb’s Arabic is: wa’l-sab‘
idhá karrarat fi’l-ibdá‘ wa’ l-ikhtirá‘ sárat arb‘a ‘ashar.

22. For the idea of tajallí much used by the Shaykhís, but which as a technical term in Muslim discussions
of ontology and metaphysics has a much longer history. see Rafati, 69–101. For one of the major antecedents for
this usage, see Toshihiko lzutsu, Sufism and Taoism: A Comparative Study of Key Philosophical Concepts 152–58.

23. This “imamization” is reflected in tafsír works of Akhbarí Shi‘ism. Sec, for example, Muhsin Fayz al-
Káshání (d. 1092/1680), al-Safí fí tafsír kalám Alláh al-wáff, and Siyyid Hashim al-Bahraní (d. 1107/1695), Tafsír
al-burhán. On these authors and the Akhbarí hermeneutic, see Corbin, En Islam iranien, vol. I, chs. 4 and 5.

24. See sect. 2, above. This veneration was one of the main reasons that the Shaykhíya ran afoul of the
more orthodox interpretations of Shi‘ism, which did, in fact, denounce the group as extremists (ghulát) on several
occasions. In his Tafsír súrat al-baqara it is clear that the Báb was sensitive to such charges. Very early on in the
work He cites the following tradition from al-Báqir, the fifth Imám: “O concourse of the Shí‘a....Be the true Shí‘a—
a middle position (al-numraqat al-wustá) so that even the extremist (al-gháli), might return to you and the one who
lags behind (al-tálí) might catch up to you.” See TBA 20.

25. They are, however, referred to in the Tafsír súrat Yúsuf, as, for example, the “two gates” (bábayn). It is
just this kind of terminological association which, of course, represents a doctrinal or philosophical affinity that was
so instrumental in the Báb’s winning to his cause a number of Shaykhís.

26. All translations of the Qur’án are from A.J. Arberry, The Koran Interpreted. In some cases the
translation has been adapted slightly.

27. Al-Bahrání, al-Burhan, 1:70; ‘Abd ‘Alí al-Huwayzi, Tafsír núr al-thaqalayn 1:37–38; al-Tabarsí,
Majma‘ al-bayán fi tafsír ai-Qur’án 1:38.

28. Two of the manuscripts add “and her grandfather”(jadd), although this word is not quite so clear in
TBA 179.

29. “Father of Iniquities.” The term, a way of referring to one of the usurpers of ‘Alí’s right to the caliphate
(possibly ‘Umar) reflects the Shí’í milieu in which the Báb wrote. That such terminology is extremely rare in other
of the Báb’s writings indicates (1) that He was not interested in what He obviously considered to be a vain and
destructive sectarian dispute and (2) that He was more interested in evil or iniquity as such than in associating it with
a particular historical figure. See Goldziher, Richtungen 288, 298.

> 30. Cf. Q. 7/142 where God extends the desert sojourn from 30 to 40 days.
> 31. TBA 7–8. The quranic verse thus explained is al-rahmán al-rahím—”the Beneficent and Merciful.”
> 32. My thanks to Dr. Muhammad Afnan for suggesting the above translation.
> 33. Unascribed statement of one of the Imáms or the Prophet.

34. See, for example, Izutsu, 159, where the author defines al-‘ayán al-thábita as the “eidetic realities” of
possible things. A possible thing becomes actualized in the phenomenal world, each according to the requirements
of its own personal archetype.

> 35. Tafsír súrat wa’ 1-‘asr, MS Cambridge, Brown F. 9(6), fn. 7l.

36. In the Báb’s words: 1á didd lahá (al-jannat al-ulá) wa lá zill, bal fí’ l-haqíqa khalwa min al-jínán wa’ l-
jínán khalwa minhá: wa hiya jannat al-tawhíd (TBA 9).

> 37. TBA 23 has tafdíl, an obvious mistake.

38. See, for example, the description of Shaykh Ahmad’s ontology and his “absolute distinction between
Possible Being and Necessary Being,” which is illustrated by a seven-stage hierarchy (Rafati, 103–4).

39. See, for example, one of the four Shí’í canonical books of hadíth, al-Kulayní (d. 328/939 or 329/940), al-
Usúl min al-káfí 1:149, no. 27; one of its chapters is headed: báb fí annahu lá yakún shay’ fí’l-samá’ wa’l-ard illá
bi-sab’a.

> 40. See sect. 2, above.

41. TBA 26. The use of the word mi’ráj here brings an association with another distinctive aspect of Shaykhí
theology. While the mainstream of both “orthodoxies,” Sunni and Shí’í, interpret the account of Muhammad’s
ascent, mi’ráj, through the seven heavens as an actual journey, the Shaykhí school taught that the story should rather
be taken more figuratively. Therefore the journey was indeed accomplished, but in the spiritual realm of húrqalyá
and not in the world of mundane experience; see Rafati, 115. On the Shaykhí understanding of worship, see Corbin,
1:194.

42. There are on occasion lists of “spiritual types” such as are found in the Tafsír súrat al-baqara. See, for
example, the Haifa manuscript, Tafsír súrat Yúsuf 226, where nine types are detailed. Oblique reference to the
“Fourth Support” may also be found. e.g., p. l07.

43. “Colui che s’erge sugli Attributi,” as translated by Alessandro Bausani, Persia Religiosa, da Zaratustra a
Bahá’u’lláh 460.

> 44. In the study cited above, n. 3. For the 1889 discussion see Browne, JRAS 21 (1889): 904–6.

45. Moojan Momen, “The Trial of Mullá ‘Ali Bastami: A Combined Sunní-Shí’í Fatwa against the Báb,”
Iran 20 (1982):113–43. This important article contains the translation of several excerpts from the Tafsír. See also
Amanat, 201–7 and passim; MacEoin, “Charismatic” 157–62.

46. For a fairly complete list of manuscripts see MacEoin, “Critical” 46. The two I used are photocopies of
the Cambridge, Browne F.11 (9), dated 1891, another Haifa copy, elated 1261, which according to MacEoin,
“Critical” p. xxxviii, n. 213, was discovered only recently. An addition. to MacEoin’s list would be the Princeton
University “Bábí Collection,” no. 55 (uncatalogued). All further references are to pages of a photocopy of the Haifa
manuscript, hereafter cited as QA.

> 47. Dimensions are of the area covered by the text, not the actual size of the page.

48. Thus a typical chapter heading in the Cambridge manuscript would appear as follows: Súrat al-imám, wa
hiya Shírazíya, wa hiya arba‘ún áya.

49. Dr. Muhammad Afnan, personal communication. Concerning the Cambridge MS, Browne notes in
“Some Remarks,” JRAS 24 (1892): 262, that the abjad value of the quranic Ií, “to me” or “before me,” is 40. The
prepositional phrase refers of course to the dream of Joseph: “Father, I saw eleven stars, and the sun and the moon; I
saw them bowing down before me [Ií]’’ (Q. 12/4). In either case, the number of verses is taken to be symbolic of
either the acceptance, or the assertion, of spiritual authority.

50. Suwar 1, 2, 52, and 95 in QA. Incidentally, there are many blank spaces at the heading of the suwar in
the Cambridge MS. It appears that the scribe intended to insert rubrications in these blanks to carry such information
as the number of verses, and so on.

51. Súra has 112 verses, while 17 and 12 both have 111. No súra has 114 verses, the number that
corresponds exactly to the total number of suwar in the Qur’án.

52. According to al-Tha‘labí (d: 437 /1036), Qisas al-anbiyá’, the story of Joseph is the most beautiful
(ahsan) “because of the lesson concealed in it, on account of Yásuf’s generosity and its wealth of matter, in which
prophets, angels, devils, jinn, men, animals, birds, rulers and subjects play a part.” See B. Heller, “Yúsuf ibn
Ya’qub’ ,” E12, ad loc.

53. Abú Hamid al-Ghazzálí, Tafsír súrat Yúsuf. The work has virtually nothing in common with the Báb’s,
except of course the quranic citations from the súra of Joseph.

54. As when Jacob warns Joseph not to tell his dream to his brothers (Q. 12/5). The concealment (ghayba) of
the Imám is considered a kind of taqíya. See R. Strothmann, “Taqíya,” E11, ad loc.

> 55. Muhammad ibn ‘Alí al-Qummí ibn Bábúya, Ikmál al-dín wa itmám al-ni‘ma fí ithbát al-raj‘a 18.

56. This method may be a reflex of the idea contained in the famous Shí’í hadíth that quotes the Imám al-
Báqir as: “It is we who are the meanings (ma’áni). We are the Hand of God, His vicinity, His tongue, His command,
His decision, His knowledge, His truth. We are the Face of God which is turned toward the terrestrial world in your
midst. He who recognizes us has certitude for an imám. He who rejects us has Hell as an imám’” cited in Corbin, En
Islam iranien 1:194. The interesting statement “we are the meanings,” among other things, takes for granted the
absolute spiritual authority implied in the act of paraphrase.

57. Some others are the word (kalima). qá’im of the year one thousand, the blessed tree in Sinai, and the
resurrection. For a discussion of these and other designations of spiritual authority, see M. Afnan and W.S. Hatcher,
“Western Islamic Scholarship and Bahá’í Origins,” Religion l5 (l985): 29–51.

58. In this same súra the following statement occurs: wa inna qad sayyarná’ l-jibál ‘alá’l-ard (cf. Q. 18/47)
wa’l-nujúm ‘alá’ 1-‘arsh hawl al-nár fí qutb al-má’ min ladai’l-dhikr bi-lláh al-haqq (“We have set the mountains

in motion upon the earth, and the stars upon the Throne around the fire which is the point [lit. axis] of water in the
presence of the Remembrance in God (bi-lláh), the Reality”).

59. Another more dramatic example of this “figure” is: “We have apportioned mountains on the earth, and
placed the earth upon the water, and the musky air [we have caused to come forth] from under the hot coldness (al-
harr al-bard),” QA 137. Numerous other examples could be cited. The coincidence of opposites is a standard figure
in this work; the Báb’s use of it is undoubtedly influenced by such important traditions as the khutbat al-tatanjíya.
For a fuller discussion see B.T. Lawson, “The Qur’án Commentary of the Báb.”

60. “In very truth” translates a frequent “refrain” throughout this work: ‘alá’1-haqq bi’ l-haqq. The
translation does not carry the all-important allusion to God, al-haqq, “The Truth” par excellence.

> 61. On this idea see Corbin’s discussion of isomorphisme in En Islam iranien 4:286–300.

62. QA 212. Al-‘amá is a frequent term in this work. For a treatment of its spiritual significance, see Stephen
Lambden, “An Early Poem of Mírza Husayn ‘Alí Bahá’u’lláh: The Sprinkling of the Cloud of Unknowing (Rashh-i
‘Amá),” Bahá’ í Studies Bulletin 3.2: 4–114, esp. 42 to end.

63. For example, one of the few mentions of any but an Imám in the Tafsír súrat al-baqara is a reference to
“the author of al-sáfí,” i.e., Muhsin Fayd Káshání, author of the Tafsír al-sáfí. The reference itself is not flattering;
see Majmú’a, 402. Kashání is criticized for his purely superficial (qishr mahd) interpretation of Q. 2/143. In
addition, the Báb says that He has not referred to the tafsír of the “ulamá” because “such is not worthy of the pur-
pose of this book.” It must be noted that this reference comes in the course of the commentary on the second juz’ of
the Qur’án, the authorship of which is open to debate.

64. The Báb repeatedly asserts that the work is in fact the same Qur’án that was revealed to Muhammad; see,
for example, Adib Taherzadeh. et al., Selections from the Writings of the Báb 67.

65. Cf. Mohammed Arkoun, “Lecture de 1a Fátiha,” in his Lectures du Coran 41–67, esp. 49. Here the
author, who appears to be speaking from a Sunní standpoint, makes reference to Ricoeur’s definition of the “cercle
herméneutique” in selling forth what he considers to be the eight principles, either explicit or implicit, of classical
exegesis. I stress the Sunní nature of the schema because in it he presents his seventh principle in the following
terms: “La disparition du prophète a enfermé tous les croyants dans un cercle herméneutique: chacun est confronté,
désormais, au texte qui re-présent la Parole; chacun doit ‘croire pour comprendre et comprendre pour croire’.” By
comparison, it would appear that the same thing occurred within Twelver Shí’í Islam or at least was perceived later
to have occurred, with the disappearance of the twelfth Imám.

66. I am grateful to Prof. H. Landolt, McGill University, for his interest. encouragement, and assistance with
this paper.
