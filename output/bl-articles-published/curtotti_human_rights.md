Human Rights: Reflections from a

Bahá’í Viewpoint

BY MICHAEL CURTOTTI

Since its inception in Iran in 1844, the Bahá’í Faith has developed into
a global religion in both its geographical spread and in the diversity of the
composition of its community. As of May 1995 the Bahá’í community
world-wide numbered over five million. A total of 174 National Spiritual
Assemblies had been established in separate countries and territories, each
representing a well-established Bahá’í community. 1 Today just under 90%
of local Bahá’í communities are found in the developing world, approxi-
mately 10% in western countries, and less than 2% in the original Islamic
heartlands where the Bahá’í Faith emerged.2

Born in modern times, the Bahá’í Faith addresses human rights in the
language of modernity. As well, however, we find traditional religious
terminology with which religions have characteristically dealt with issues
now falling within the human rights framework. In the earliest writings
of Bahá’u’lláh, the prophet-founder of the Bahá’í Faith, we find rights
themes addressed in terms of the spiritual journey of the soul. From this
seed, references to rights evolve into a well-defined set of principles which
form the foundation of the Bahá’í teachings, many of which have subse-
quently been championed by the modern human rights movement, and
some of which suggest future human rights agendas.

The Bahá’í community has long undertaken activities which promote
human rights, particularly in fields such as the abolition of racial and
other prejudices and the advocacy of the equality of men and women.
Since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the com-
munity has also advocated human rights through its contribution as an

Human Rights: Reflections from a Bahá’í Viewpoint

non-government organisation represented at the United Nations, and in
the work of national communities around the world.

A significantly expanded involvement in human rights issues since 1994

has compelled the community to develop a better understanding of the
scriptural basis of the Bahá’í commitment to human rights, and to begin
to develop methodologies for the effective advocacy of rights which are
consistent with the community’s non-political character and its emphasis
on building unity between people. The focus on rights also raises the ques-
tion of how to deal maturely with areas where the standards of the Bahá’í
Faith and particular aspects of human rights may seem to be in tension.

Bahá’í Scripture and human rights principles

In a forty-year period from 1852-1892, Bahá’u’lláh delivered a com-
plex body of religious teachings directed to his followers, to enquirers, to
leaders of society and to humanity in general. Born to a leading ministe-
rial and noble family of Persia, Bahá’u’lláh spent this entire period as an
exile in the Ottoman Empire, held in varying degrees of detention and
imprisonment by its government.

A common theme throughout all of Bahá’u’lláh’s writings is the con-
cept of the oneness of humanity. Replete with human rights resonance, it
symbolises complex ideas concerning the nature of the human person
and society. This principle is regarded as the “pivot” around which the
Bahá’í teachings are built.3 It expresses the common spiritual origin - and
thus equality - of all human beings:

> Know ye not why We created you all from the same dust? That no one should
> exalt himself over the other.4

It symbolises the value of the human person, in language which paral-
lels the concept of human dignity in article 1 of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights:

> Noble have I created Thee, yet thou hast abased thyself. Rise then to that for which
> thou wast created.5

Human Rights: Reflections from a Bahá’í Viewpoint

It expresses the basic moral paradigm of Bahá’u’lláh’s teaching,
emphasising a vision of service to humanity as the highest moral order:

> Do not busy yourselves in your own concerns; let your thoughts be fixed upon
> that which will rehabilitate the fortunes of mankind and sanctify the hearts and
> souls of men.6

It expresses the close bonds uniting all human beings together:

> Ye are the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch. Deal ye one with another
> with the utmost love and harmony, with friendliness and fellowship ... So power-
> ful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth ... Exert yourselves
> that ye may attain this transcendent and most sublime station, the station that
> can ensure the protection and security of all mankind. This goal excelleth every
> other goal, and this aspiration is the monarch of all aspirations. So long, however,
> as the thick clouds of oppression, which obscure the day star of justice, remain
> undispelled, it would be difficult for the glory of this station to be unveiled to
> men’s eyes.7

Bahá’u’lláh’s teaching that “the earth is but one country, and man-
kind its citizens” expresses yet another aspect. It concisely conveys not
only the idea of oneness but also the idea of equality of all humans before
one global law. The foundational philosophies of the Universal Declara-
tion - dignity, equality, fraternity and non-discrimination - find expres-
sion in the idea of the oneness of humanity and the other core Bahá’í
principles.

Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings

It is possible to discern four phases in Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings. Despite
the marked differences between the various categories of scripture, all
feature the thread of human rights, which are given expression in an
evolutionary way.

During the first phase, his Baghdad teachings from 1852 to 1863,
Bahá’u’lláh’s writings were largely mystical and theological in character,
focussing on the relationship between man and God and on the nature of
religion. Observance of human rights is regarded as an element of the

Human Rights: Reflections from a Bahá’í Viewpoint

soul’s search for God. The second phase, from 1863 to 1872, during which
Bahá’u’lláh was successively exiled to Constantinople, Adrianople and
finally the prison city of Akka in Palestine, featured a key series of letters
to various kings and rulers. Here observance of human rights is a divine
obligation imposed on the rulers of society. The third phase is represented
by the writing in 1873 of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the Bahá’í book of sacred law,
in which human rights are foundational elements of the ordering of the
‘divine’ society. The fourth and final stage is expressed in a series of letters
written to various followers in which Bahá’u’lláh provides his vision of
an enlightened society, outlining a series of teachings designed to address-
ing the healing of social ills. As aspirations for the future, human rights
are at the core of the healing of society’s ills and the redemption of hu-
manity.

The journey of the soul (1852-1863)

The earliest references to rights concepts in Bahá’í scripture are found
in Bahá’u’lláh’s mystical and theological writings. From a Bahá’í point of
view rights are a far richer concept that mere legal prohibitions limiting
the power of those governing society. They are enjoined on the believer,
not only because they represent justice, but because the believer must ex-
press them to be able to attain to God. The following passage from the
Kitab-i-Iqan, in which Bahá’u’lláh discusses the religious path, is an ex-
ample of this:

> When a true seeker determines to take the step of search in the path leading to the
> knowledge of the Ancient of Days he must ... never exalt himself above anyone ...
> That seeker should regard backbiting as grievous error ... He should succour the
> dispossessed, and never withhold his favour from the destitute. He should show
> kindness to animals, how much more to his fellow man, to him who is endowed
> with the power of utterance ... He should not wish for others that which he doth
> not wish for himself ... These are among the attributes ... of the spiritually minded.8

In the previous section we have reviewed a number of quotations from
the Hidden Words which come from this period and which address equal-
ity in spiritual terms. In the same works we find a range of other rights
concepts such as adherence to justice, care for the poor and condemna-
tion of injustice, in each case expressed in mystical language. These kinds
of references, as Bahá’u’lláh himself states, crystallise the teachings ‘re-

vealed unto the prophets of old’. One such example is the following pas-
sage in which the prophet Isaiah talks of the kind of worship that is ac-
ceptable to God:

> “The multitudes of your sacrifices - what are they to me?” says the Lord. “I have
> more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals ...
> Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me ... I cannot
> bear your evil assemblies. Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts
> my soul hates. They have become a burden to me ... even if you offer many prayers
> I will not listen ... Your hands are full of blood; wash and make yourselves clean.
> Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong, learn to do right! Seek
> justice, rebuke the oppressor. Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of
> the widow”.

Sources such as this, which could be multiplied from a variety of reli-
gions, underline the universality and antiquity of philosophies which are
the roots of the modern human rights movement.

The duties of the rulers of society (1863 - 1873)

The next phase of Bahá’u’lláh’s writings is represented by letters to
various kings and rulers of society in which he proclaims his divine mis-
sion. These letters include an active advocacy of rights expressed in terms
of divinely imposed duties binding on the rulers of society. It is a theme
that continues in subsequent periods of his teachings.

Thus we find the core of civil and political rights: a condemnation of
oppression and praise of just governance and the securing of rights.

> God hath committed into your hands the reins of the government of the people,
> that ye may rule with justice over them, safeguard the rights of the down-trodden
> and punish the wrong-doers.9

We also find the basic outlines of the concepts of economic rights in
repeated calls for economic justice. Thus Bahá’u’lláh calls on the Otto-
man sultan to address the extremes of wealth and poverty under his rule:

> Deal with ... undeviating justice so that none among [your subjects] may either
> suffer want or be pampered with luxuries. This is but manifest justice ... for this is
> what we observed when we entered the City [Constantinople]. We found among
> its inhabitants some who were possessed of an affluent fortune and lived in the
> midst of excess riches, while others were in dire want and abject poverty. This ill
> beseemeth thy sovereignty, and is unworthy of thy rank.10

In addition to these two major themes we find a number of specific
rights references addressed to rulers of society. Religious discrimination is
condemned in a reference to the persecution of the Jewish community by
two governments. 11 In an allusion to the suffering of the Bahá’í commu-
nity Bahá’u’lláh outlines the kinds of abuses of governmental power that
are impermissible and which should be addressed by the world’s leaders,
including violation of life, property, and reputation. He emphasises the
duty of kings (in modern terminology, governments) to prevent oppres-
sion.12 The role of the will of the people in the process of governance is
alluded to in an early letter to Queen Victoria: “We have heard that thou
has entrusted the reins of counsel into the hands of the representatives of
the people. Thou, indeed, hast done well”.13 To these representatives he
emphasises that they should regard themselves as “the representatives of
all that dwell on earth”14 , a concept which emphatically suggests the duty
to advance the rights of all people:

> O ye the elected representatives of the people in every land! Take ye counsel
> together, and let your concern be only for that which profiteth mankind, and
> bettereth the condition thereof.15

A third major theme which dominates Bahá’u’lláh’s message to the
rulers is his encouragement for them to establish peace in the world. While
examination of this theme is beyond the scope of this paper, it is impor-
tant to note that a full appreciation of the promotion of peace was central
in his writings to kings and rulers.

The Kitáb-i-Aqdas and human rights

The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh’s book of sacred law, is the fundamen-
tal source for the way of life practiced by Bahá’í s. The Aqdas provides for
prayer, fasting, religious institutions, places of worship and religious fes-
tivals. It deals with traditional religious subjects - morality, man’s rela-

tionship with God and individual spiritual growth. It is concerned with
basic social laws such as the prohibition of theft and murder. It deals with
basic matters of personal status such as marriage, divorce and inherit-
ance. Within this overall context we find in the Aqdas basic human rights
principles - dignity, equality, fraternity, non-discrimination - and the out-
lines of the concepts of civil and political rights and economic, social and
cultural rights. In addition there is a range of provisions bearing directly
on human rights principles found in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.

The idea of human unity is expressed in the Aqdas in a call to Bahá’ís to
“consort with all religions in the spirit of amity and concord”, with the
added emphasis that “all things proceed from God and unto Him they
return”. Here we find both the idea of the human fraternity and the idea
of the equality of human beings found in article 1 of the Declaration.16 Its
basic intent is reinforced in provisions such as the abolition of ritual impu-
rity, a concept whose discriminatory impact and destructiveness to equality
and dignity (particularly for women) requires no elaboration. In the con-
text of this abolition Bahá’u’lláh again calls on his followers to “consort
with the followers of all religions”.17

Human dignity is expressed in passages which emphasise the sacred-
ness of the human person - “the human temple”, “temple of man” - and
which encourage behaviour worthy of that dignity. 18

The way in which the prohibition of murder is expressed emphasises
the sacredness of human life:

> let no soul slay another ... What! Would ye kill him whom God hath quickened,
> whom He hath endowed with a breath of spirit through a breath from Him?
> Grievous then would your tresspass be before His throne! Fear God, and lift not
> the hand of injustice and oppression to destroy what He hath Himself raised up.19

From a religious viewpoint the “right to life” set out in article 3 of the
Declaration could not be more strongly stated. The applicability of this
prohibition to the agents of government is implicit in the condemnation of
the abuse of power to take life expressed in this passage.

The abolition of the slave trade and the practice of slavery set out in
article 4 of the Universal Declaration is advocated in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas:

> It is forbidden to you to trade in slaves, be they men or women. It is not for him
> who is a servant to buy another of God’s servants ... Let no man exalt himself over
> another: all are but bondslaves before the Lord.20

As well as forbidding both the slave trade and slavery the language
emphasises the concept of human equality - including by implication the
equality of men and women, an equality explicit in other of Bahá’u’lláh’s
writings.

The right to social security found in articles 22 and 25 of the Declara-
tion is expressed in a variety of provisions of the Aqdas:

> All have been enjoined to earn a living, and as for those who are incapable of
> doing so, it is incumbent on the Deputies of God and on the wealthy to make
> adequate provision for them.21

Other passages confirm the system of charitable contributions for re-
lief of the poor known as Zakat, which was taught by Muhammad.22 The
estate of a deceased who leaves no children and no will is to be expended
“on the orphaned and widowed, and on whatsoever will bring benefit to
the generality of the people”.23 These passages envision a society provid-
ing systems of social security.

The right to education found in article 26 of the Declaration is expressed
in the Aqdas:

> Unto every father hath been enjoined the instruction of his son and daughter in
> the art of reading and writing ... He that putteth away that which is commanded
> unto him, the Trustees are then to take from him that which is required for their
> instruction if he be wealthy and, if not, the matter devolveth upon the House of
> Justice. Verily have We made it a shelter for the poor and needy.24

This passage provides successive mechanisms to ensure that all chil-
dren receive an education. Like the passage dealing with slavery, where
equality of men and women is implied, this provision promotes equal gen-
der access to education.

The principles of protection of privacy and reputation found in article
12 of the Declaration are expressed in the Aqdas: “take heed that ye enter

no house in the absence of its owner, except with permission.” Believers
are forbidden to commit “backbiting or calumny”, a prohibition strongly
emphasised in Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings.

References in the Aqdas to the kings and rulers of society continue elabo-
ration of the basic elements of civil and political rights, reinforcing state-
ments addressing such rights in greater detail elsewhere. Bahá’u’lláh
reminds the Kings that their power is not arbitrary: they are subject to a
higher law and to divine sovereignty. 25 This concept reminds us of the
non-secular sources of the concept of the “rule of law”. He is contemptu-
ous of the “throne of tyranny” in Constantople, the capital of the Otto-
man Empire.26 In a paragraph specifically addressed to the rulers of
America he calls on them to “Adorn the temple of dominion with the
ornament of justice and fear of God”. He calls on them to “Bind the bro-
ken with the hands of justice, and crush the oppressor who flourisheth
with the rod of the commandments of your Lord, the Ordainer, the All-
wise.”27 In a reference to his native city of Teheran he predicts that even-
tually God will bless its throne “with one who will rule with justice” and
that “erelong, the reins of power” would fall into the hands of the people.28
In a later work he clarifies the intent of this reference:

> Referring to the land of Ta [Teheran] We have revealed in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas that
> which will admonish mankind. They that perpetrate tyranny in the world have
> usurped the rights of the peoples and kindreds of the earth and are sedulously
> pursuing their selfish inclinations.29

Bahá’u’lláh later expresses support for constitutional monarchy, as it
is “adorned with the light of both kingship and of the consultation of the
people”.30

These provisions of the Aqdas establish a broad foundation for human
rights. The significance of this scriptural foundation cannot be
overemphasised. Bahá’í support of human rights is not a question of re-
sponse to current social trends; it falls rather into the category of funda-
mental norm of Bahá’í community life. Advocacy of human rights is one
aspect of aspiring and doing justice to the way of life inculcated in the
Bahá’í teachings.

An enlightened world society

The final phase of Bahá’u’lláh’s writings was embodied in a series of
major letters to the faithful and others which set out his vision of an
enlighted world society. Here again we find the stream of human rights
thought expressed.

In the Tablet of the World, for instance, he defines societal evil in terms
which only too well capture the depths of violations of human dignity in
the twentieth century:

> The unbelievers and the faithless have set their minds on four things: first, the
> shedding of blood; second, the burning of books; third, the shunning of the fol-
> lowers of other religions; fourth, the extermination of other communities and
> groups.31

A flavour of the writings of this period can be gleaned by an examina-
tion of the letter known as Glad-Tidings which, among others, abolishes
the law of holy war, encourages association with the followers of all reli-
gions, promotes the adoption of a universal language so that “the whole
earth will come to be regarded as one country”, encourages loyalty to
government, calls for the establishment of global peace, promotes free-
dom in dress, encourages service to the community, prohibits the destruc-
tion of books, promotes the sciences and the arts, regards work as worship,
and promotes constitutional monarchy. Similar passages are found in other
writings of the period.

It is also in this period that Bahá’u’lláh defines the distinguishing char-
acter of his teachings:

> We have on one hand, blotted from the pages of God’s Holy Book whatsoever
> hath been the cause of strife, of malice and mischief amongst the children of men,
> and have, on the other, laid down the essential prerequisites of concord, of under-
> standing, of complete and enduring unity.32

It is from passages such as this that the core principle of the oneness of
humanity is drawn.

Again we find additional human rights elements represented in this
period. For instance, the idea of fair reward for work: “The people of

Bahá should not deny any soul the reward due to him, should treat crafts-
men with deference”.33 The proper administration of justice is referred to:
“Shed not the blood of anyone, O people, neither judge ye anyone un-
justly.”34 Respect for the property of others is embodied in such passages
as: “Deal not treacherously with the substance of your neighbour. Be ye
trustworthy on earth”.35 The Aqdas instruction to ensure the education of
children is reiterated as a central principle. The obligation to work is iden-
tified as a form of worship, which later we see elaborated as a right to
work and as a duty on those who organise society to ensure work is pro-
vided for all.

Seen from the Bahá’í paradigm

Religions provide meaning to life, and in doing so they provide a con-
ceptual world or paradigm within which the religion’s principles and
teachings are elaborated. Accordingly, though we have seen a powerful
affirmation of rights themes in the Bahá’í teachings, those teachings can-
not be seen as merely an expression of human rights philosophy or any
other system of thought. The Bahá’í approach to human rights needs to
be understood in its own context, if it is to be fully appreciated.

The difference in paradigm between secular modernism and a reli-
gious system such as the Bahá’í Faith inevitably gives rise to a number of
areas of conceptual tension. These tensions need to be acknowledged and
explored. In some cases the tension can be resolved by a better under-
standing of the nature of human rights, or of the Bahá’í teachings, and by
better understanding what is essential to each.

Fundamentally the Bahá’í approach to human rights is one that bal-
ances communitarian approaches with individual interest. Unsurprisingly,
given its religious character, responsibilities are as important as rights from
a Bahá’í point of view. This issue, of course, only becomes problematic if
one views human rights as in any sense anti-communitarian or anti-re-
sponsibility. Such an interpretation must be regarded as highly question-
able, certainly in respect of the principles of the human rights movement
grounded in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

If one looks to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, one finds that its very first phrase is a
reference to a duty, not a right: the duty of the individual to know God
and his prophets and to obey their teachings. Curiously, we can observe
that the Universal Declaration itself begins with a duty rather than a right:

> every individual and every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly
> in mind, shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights
> and freedoms and by progressive measures, national and international, to secure
> their universal and effective recognition and observance”.36

In addition, every right implies duties. The “right to life”, for instance,
in an active sense is addressed to all mankind and only has meaning if we
understand by it “thou shalt not abuse power to take human life”. Article
29 of the Universal Declaration includes the idea of community responsi-
bility, stating “everyone has duties to the community in which alone the
free and full development of his personality is possible”. The emphasis on
rights as opposed to duties in the Declaration itself also needs to be under-
stood in its historical context. The language, for very good reasons, is con-
cerned to emphasise the limits of governmental power, because
governments have so prominently been the principal violators of rights.
The introduction of extensive reference to duties would potentially un-
dermine this purpose. The same is true of the international human rights
treaties, which are concerned to bind governments with legal obligations
not qualified by ambiguities arising from duties which might be read by
those minded to avoid human rights obligations as making rights condi-
tional.

A second area of difficulty is presented by the revolutionary origin of
human rights philosophy. To the extent that human rights can be inter-
preted as continuing to endorse the violent overthrow of government,
they would not accord with Bahá’í principle. Violence is a methodology
antithetical to the character of the Bahá’í Faith and is profoundly rejected.
Bahá’ís are counselled to be obedient and loyal to government:

> None must contend with those who wield authority over the people; leave unto
> them that which is theirs, and direct your attention to men’s hearts.37

In the last clause of this passage we see encapsulated the Bahá’í view
that the true transformation of society depends ultimately on the trans-
formation of the individual. The pacific character of the Bahá’í Faith is
emphasised by other provisions such as the prohibition on carrying arms
unless essential, and on engaging in conflict, striking another, or commit-
ting similar acts “whereby hearts and souls may be saddened”.38 These
statements do not imply an acceptance of unjust rule, but they define a

methodology based on the peaceful and progressive transformation of
such injustice.

Fundamental to an appreciation of the Bahá’í approach is its emphasis
on unity as the prerequisite to social well-being and the Bahá’í Faith’s
own unifying mission which mandates that all its activities be directed to
the achievement of unity in the human family.

The foregoing is not necessarily outside the bounds of modern human
rights thinking. The preambular paragraphs to the Declaration in fact
note that one of the purposes of human rights is to obviate the necessity
for individuals to resort to “rebellion against tyranny and oppression”.

Further, the modernity of the Bahá’í Faith in its social principles does
not equate to an acceptance of moral indifference or moral relativism in
matters of personal conduct, which is a prominent characteristic of mod-
ern cosmopolitan society. Indeed the Bahá’í Faith expects high standards
of morality from its followers including in areas such as personal ethics,
chastity, and abstinence from alcohol, drugs and gambling.

The Faith’s emphasis both on peace and on high standards of conduct
is reflected in Bahá’u’lláh’s critical reference to liberty in the Aqdas. It is a
reference which can be easily misunderstood if taken out of context. In
the Aqdas, Baha’u’llah refers to excesses of liberty as contrary to human
well-being. As indicated by the Universal House of Justice, the world gov-
erning body of the Bahá’í Faith, such references cannot be construed as
approval of oppressive governance:

> A true reading of the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh leaves no doubt as to the high
> importance of [freedom of thought, expression and action] to constructive social
> processes. Consider, for instance, Bahá’u’lláh’s proclamation to the kings and
> rulers. Can it not be deduced from this alone that attainment of freedom is a
> significant purpose of his Revelation? His denunciations of tyranny and His
> urgent appeals on behalf of the oppressed provide unmistakable proof. But does
> not the freedom foreshadowed by His Revelation imply nobler, ampler manifesta-
> tions of human achievement? Does it not indicate an organic relationship be-
> tween the internal and external realities of man such as has not yet been attained?39

An analysis of the relationship between the teachings of the Bahá’í
Faith and human rights is found in a major essay in the 1996-1997 vol-
ume of The Bahá’í World. The inclusion of this essay in an official publica-
tion of the international Bahá’í community reflects the significance of

human rights in the current work of the community. Titled “The Human
Rights Discourse: A Bahá’í Perspective”, the article addresses the philoso-
phy of rights and makes a number of observations. First and foremost, it
discusses the basic congruence between human rights values and the Bahá’í
teachings. Secondly, it is concerned to critique moral relativism and thus
to support the universality of human rights, commenting that relativistic
statements about rights (such as in the Bangkok Declaration) “are often
intended to insulate governments from international criticism regarding
treatment of their citizens”. Thirdly, the article discusses the various sources
posited for human rights (nature, reason etc) supporting the validity of
arguments for a divine origin for those rights. Fourthly the article
emphasises the communitarian character of the Bahá’í teachings which
call for a balance between individual freedom and the promotion of the
collective good.

Beyond these thematic issues are specific provisions of Bahá’í law that
need to be considered in the overall context of the relationship between
the Bahá’í teachings and human rights. The following examples illustrate
some of the issues that arise.

A social law introduced by Bahá’u’lláh requires that once intending
spouses have decided they wish to marry each other, they should seek
and obtain the consent of their parents to the marriage. This might be
seen as impeding free consent of the spouses as referred to in article 16.2
of the Universal Declaration. Yet Bahá’u’lláh’s intent in introducing this
provision furthers an aim of this article, which is the well-being of the
family:

> Desiring to establish love, unity and harmony amidst Our servants, We have
> conditioned [marriage], once the couple’s wish is known, upon the permission of
> their parents, lest enmity and rancour should arise amongst them.40

The intestacy laws provided by Bahá’u’lláh provide for a complex se-
ries of inheritors who receive different portions of the inheritance. The
first male child receives significant preference over other potential benefi-
ciaries, and in other instances a greater proportion of inheritance is pro-
vided for male as opposed to female beneficiaries. Here again difficult
issues arise, a full appreciation requiring consideration of the context of
these inheritance laws.

The death penalty is allowed for in the case of murder and arson, as is
its commutation to life imprisonment.41 A significant body of work in the
human rights movement is undertaken to bring about the full abolition of
the death penalty, although there is an equally significant resistance to
this aim.

Rather than creating a fundamental divergence, such issues need to be
seen in the context of an evolutionary and diverse human rights system,
whose basic provisions vary over both time and place, although its funda-
mental principles and intent remain in essence unchanging. Since 1948
new “generations” of rights have been created and different regions have
emphasised different aspects of human rights. Work within the interna-
tional system to elaborate rights continues largely unabated. Furthermore,
rights are themselves not absolute and are balanced against each other.
For instance, the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination
limits the right to freedom of expression in order to promote racial equal-
ity. Universality thus cannot be taken to mean uniformity: within limits
there is scope for a diversity of approaches to achieving the minimum
aspirations set out in the Universal Declaration.

Bahá’í aspirations for human rights

A review of the Bahá’í approach to human rights would be incomplete
without reference to those areas where the Bahá’í teachings suggest the
need for further development of human rights principles.

Of central importance to unfulfilled human rights aspirations from a
Bahá’í point of view is the concept of the oneness of humanity - a concept
at the core of Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings and which he emphasises repeat-
edly. It is expressed in various ways including the idea of global citizen-
ship. “The Earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens.” This idea
of universal human citizenship implies, in stronger terms than expressed
in the Declaration, the equality of rights of all members of the human
family. Citizenship is the organising principle that replaced hierarchical
medieval society with egalitarian concepts of modernity. Yet, in today’s
world we still do not practice full equality of human rights. One’s country
of birth still determines whether one will live in abject poverty or in mate-
rial affluence unimaginable to previous generations, whether one will
experience peace or warfare, whether one lives in a democratic society or
whether one is subject to tyranny. It is a reality implicitly endorsed by the
Declaration, which in this respect gives priority to the rights of states as
opposed to the rights of the individual. For instance articles 13 (freedom

of movement, and the right to leave a country), 14 (the right to asylum)
and 15 (the right to nationality) can be seen from a Bahá’í point of view as
steps along the way to adopting the principle that all humanity are the
citizens of a common homeland.

In this context article 28, which states that “everyone is entitled to a
social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth
in the Declaration can be fully realised”, would be seen as an area of
neglected human rights advocacy. From the point of view of the Bahá’í
teachings, human rights will not be achieved until the unity of the human
race is established.

The Bahá’í principle that extremes of wealth as well as the extreme of
poverty need to be addressed suggest another area of human rights advo-
cacy. In broader terms the attention given to economic rights in the Bahá’í
writings contrasts with western approaches which in the past were pri-
marily focussed on civil and political rights. Thus far efforts towards the
achievement of basic economic standards for all human beings, as called
for in the Universal Declaration, have been notably unsuccessful; and
extremes of poverty and wealth are increasing, both globally and within
national borders.

The concept of the “oneness of religion” takes article 18 of the declara-
tion one step beyond recognising the freedom of others to practice their
beliefs - it implies the idea that all religions are from God and therefore
sacred and worthy of reverence. It is an idea that promotes reconciliation
and mutual respect between the followers of all faiths. Religious tolerance
remains an unachieved aspiration, as sadly evident in conflict between
followers of different faiths in a number of countries.

Bahá’í community advocacy of human rights

The Bahá’í teachings provide rich sources for action to promote hu-
man rights. Thus, as one would expect, the Bahá’í community has sought
to translate these principles into practical action.

In a general sense Bahá’í community life intrinsically involves the pro-
motion of human rights. The practices of free and fair elections, the role of
the community in the governance of its own affairs, the promotion of
unity between people irrespective of race and background, the pursuit of
gender equity are all inherent aspects of Bahá’í community life. In a Bahá’í
International Community statement on human rights education the pro-

motion of human rights principles in Bahá’í moral education classes is
discussed: “Bahá’í communities in 173 countries are already both pro-
moting and providing education, based on the principle of the oneness of
humanity, which seeks to cultivate respect for the rights of others, a sense
of responsibility for the well-being of the human family, and the moral
attributes that contribute to a just, harmonious and peaceful world civili-
zation. As a fundamental tenet of their religion, Bahá’ís are committed to
the eradication of all forms of prejudice, including those based on race,
ethnic origin, religion, sex or nationality — prejudices that fuel hatred
and cause otherwise good people to deprive their fellow citizens of
rights.”42

As well as this general context there is an increasing body of specific
human rights advocacy in which the Bahá’í community is engaged.

Statements issued by the Bahá’í International Community, which rep-
resent some of its work at the United Nations, give an indication of the
length of commitment to human rights at the international level. The Bahá’í
community contributed to the drafting of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights through its Bahá’í Declaration of Human Obligations and
Rights. From 1974 onwards there has been a steady stream of Bahá’í con-
tributions to the human rights work of United Nations bodies, covering a
broad range of topics including women’s rights, racial prejudice, rights of
minorities, religious tolerance, rights of indigenous people, economic so-
cial and cultural rights, human rights education, violence against women
and combatting racism.43

A 1974 document on the elimination of discrimination against women
illustrates how the Bahá’í community, as a global entity, has worked over
many years to promote human rights:

> Since this is the first occasion we have had to report on publicity given to the
> Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, we would like
> to mention that as far back as 1968 we were making available to our affiliates
> [national communities] information on the [Declaration on the Elimination of
> Discrimination Against Women], as well as mailing supplies for United Nations
> Day or Human Rights Day meetings.

This description is representative of the kind of global and grass roots
activity that Bahá’í communities have pursued for many years.

During the International Year of Peace in 1986, the Universal House of
Justice issued The Promise of World Peace, a document which focussed on
the prerequisites for the achievement of peace. It was shared with com-
munity leaders from the Secretary General of the United Nations to the
chiefs and mayors of local communities, as well as the public in general. It
continues to be distributed by the Bahá’í community. Its themes include
the abolition of racism, the equality of men and women, the abolition of
extremes of wealth and poverty, and the need for universal education.

In 1994 Bahá’í advocacy of human rights was given a greater focus
through the adoption of an international policy for a Bahá’í contribution
to the fostering of peace that focussed on four thematic issues: human
rights, advancement of women, global prosperity and moral development.
This policy has had the effect of significantly increasing national and lo-
cal Bahá’í focus on these issues. In 1997 the Bahá’í community launched a
program of action to support the implementation of national measures
pursuant to the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education. In
this campaign Bahá’í communities have been encouraged to undertake
promotion of commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and steps to implement the UN plan of
action for the decade.

In Australia, the Bahá’í community has participated in such activities
over many years. The community’s work for peace was recognised by an
award from the United Nations Secretary General in the International
Year of Peace. Since 1996 there has been an increased focus on commemo-
ration of Human Rights day, adding to routine activities in support of
other international and national commemorations such as United Na-
tions’ Day, International Women’s Day, Reconciliation Week and Refu-
gee Week. In its national work the community has sought to increase its
contribution to non-government work in the field of human rights. A wide
range of activities were organised to promote the fiftieth anniversary of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1998, including local com-
memorations and the conference at which this paper was presented.

Conclusion

As we explore the body of Bahá’í teachings we see a deep stream of
reference to human rights expressed in traditional religious terminology -
terminology drawn not from modern western political philosophy, but
rather from the traditions of the great prophetic traditions of the Middle
East. The comprehensiveness of this reference to human rights underlines

the centrality of rights in the Bahá’í Faith. The traditional language ex-
pressing rights concepts signals what can be deduced from a study of
Judaism, Christianity, Islam and indeed the other great faiths: that these
systems of thought have contributed directly to the assumptions and ways
of thought from which human rights and instruments such as the Uni-
versal Declaration of Human Rights have emerged.

The very act of humanity gathering in 1948 to declare its global values
and its aspirations for all human beings was profoundly spiritual in char-
acter. It was both a step and a beacon towards a future worthy of human
dignity.
