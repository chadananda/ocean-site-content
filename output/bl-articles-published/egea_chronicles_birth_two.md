Religion s in Spain ( 18 5 4- 1 8 7 6 )

by Amín E. Egea
translated by Francisco J. Díaz

On a previous occasion1 we reviewed Spain’s earliest references to
Babism. We saw, for example, how news of the uprising in Zanján
and the Báb’s martyrdom received some national press coverage in
1850\. We also demonstrated how the assassination attempt against
the young monarch Náßiri’d-Dín Sháh in August 1852 received the
same amount of coverage in Spain as in other parts of the West. Daily
newspapers also gave extensive coverage to the persecution of Bábís
in Persia as a result of the foiled plot against the monarch, and, even
as late as July 1853, some Spanish dailies continued to offer related
news, a fact which gave us the opportunity to comment briefly on
what might have been the actual extent of such persecutions. Finally,
after considering the readership of each of the daily newspapers
reporting stories about the Bábís, we ventured a guess as to the
potential number of readers that might have learned about the new
religion for the first time.

As we shall now see, additional stories about the infant religion
continued trickling into Spain.

The Enciclopedia Moderna

Between 1851 and 1855, Francisco de Paula Mellado, a prolific
author, was finishing in Madrid what was to become the first truly
comprehensive Spanish encyclopedia of the nineteenth century, the
Enciclopedia Moderna, Diccionario universal de literatura, ciencias,
artes, agricultura, industria y comercio [Modern Encyclopedia /
Unabridged Dictionary of Literature, Science, Art, Agriculture,
Industry, and Commerce]. The work was actually an adapted and
enlarged version of a French encyclopedia bearing the same name and
published by the Firmin Didot brothers several years earlier (1846-
1851). The Spanish version comprised forty volumes in total. Volume
30 was published in 1854 and contained a reproduction of the
definition pertaining to “Persia.” The French version identifies the
author of the article as A. Bouchot, about whom no further
information has yet come to light.

68          Chronicles of a Birth

The author’s exposition on the history of Persia concludes with the
reign of Mu˙ammad Sháh, to wit:

> The son of Feth-Alí, Abbas Mírzá (1831-1833) did nothing
> of great account and was succeeded by Mahomed-Mírzá
> [sic] (1833-1848). The events surrounding this prince’s reign
> are too recent to warrant any further analysis.

Bouchot then immediately describes briefly Persia’s fragile state at the
time, concluding the final paragraph of his article as follows:

> Today she thus finds herself gripped by a decadence that
> cannot last much longer, inasmuch as the prince now
> governing her is incapable of asserting his power; he has
> neither revenues nor a navy nor an army to speak of, unless
> these are the terms applied to a bunch of unruly soldiers
> whom he calls upon at his pleasure and on whom he relies so
> infrequently that he chooses to live among his tribesmen, the
> only ones he feels safe and secure with. If we add to this the
> ruin of her trade and commerce, so vibrant in times past, a
> weakened agriculture, excessive taxation, setback after
> setback, anarchy, and the subversive doctrines propagated by
> the Báb’s disciples, who preach communion of their property
> and their women, we cannot but admire how Persia has
> resisted for so long such powerful forces of destruction.2

Thus we have here a reference to Babism that could not have been
penned any later than 1851, and which is very likely older.

Bouchot’s statement that the Bábís practiced “communion of their
property and their women” was not gratuitous; rather, his article
merely reflects a fairly typical misunderstanding about Babism during
the movement’s early years.3 The reasons for such an accusation are
varied, Lord Curzon would comment years later:

> Certainly no such idea as communism in the European sense,
> i.e., a forcible redistribution of property, or as socialism in
> the nineteenth century sense, i.e., the defeat of capital by
> labour, ever entered the brain of the Bab [sic] or his
> disciples. The only communism known to and recommended
> by him was that of the New Testament and the early
> Christian Church, viz, the sharing of goods in common by
> members of the faith, and the exercise of almsgiving, and an
> ample charity. The charge of immorality seems to have arisen
> partly from the malignant inventions of opponents, partly
> from the much greater freedom claimed for women by the
> Bab [sic], which in the Oriental mind is scarcely dissociable
from profligacy of conduct ....4

1857 — False Rumors

For certain, the assassination attempt against Náßiri’d-Dín Sháh in
1852 did little to dispel this misunderstanding about the Bábí Faith.
As we already saw, Persia’s religious and political authorities took
advantage of the incident not only to rid themselves of as many Bábís
as they could, but also to foster an aura of ill will against their
movement.

In October 1856, Persia annexed the predominantly Shí’a Afghan
province of Herat. This maneuver by Náßiri’d-Dín Sháh helped to
destabilize the region’s fragile balance of power and eventually led to
war with Great Britain. Persia’s defeat was swift, and the impact the
conflict had on the state’s coffers led to nationwide public
disaffection bordering on civil war.

The Spanish and European press alike provided extensive, in-depth
coverage of the conflict. On November 17, 1852, El Estado, a
Madrid daily newspaper, published the following story in an article
about the country’s domestic situation:

> Several foreign newspapers have written about a plot against
> the life of the shah [sic] perpetrated by an individual
> belonging to the Babi [sic] sect. Le Pays categorically denies
> this account.5

This denial probably reached Spain by way of the news agency
Havas, which likely was not the one that distributed news of the
alleged attempt against the Sháh, or at least that is what can be
deduced after verifying that Spain’s major daily newspapers that
subscribed to the Havas Bureau did not publish such information.6

It would not be the last time that the Western press wrongly
implicated the Bábís in assassination attempts, whether real or
imagined, against the Sháh of Persia. It happened again in 18697,
18788, and twice again in 18969.

The 1860s

In 1862, an expanded translation of Charles Dreyss’s Cronología
Universal was published in Madrid. Its author, Antonio Ferrer del Río,
based his translation on the second French edition (1858). The entry
for the year 1852 mentions the assassination attempt against the Sháh
and the execution of 400 Bábís. That we are aware of, no mention of
the religion is made again in any Spanish reference works other than
the Enciclopedia Moderna and Cronología Universal until 1876.

In 1865, two highly significant works were published
simultaneously in France that would have a decisive influence on the
West’s understanding of Babism. One was Mírzá Kazem-Beg’s Báb et

70           Chronicles of a Birth

les Bábís, which, beginning that year, was published in installments in
the Journal Asiatique. The other was Les Religions et les Philosophies
dans l’Asie centrale by Count Joseph A. de Gobineau.

Gobineau’s work achieved much greater popularity. Though not
exempt from historical errors or critical omissions, the book greatly
influenced oriental studies of the period and awakened a certain
sympathy toward the nascent religion in intellectual and public
opinion circles.

Few in Spain came to know Kazem-Beg’s work. Gobineau’s book,
on the other hand, was very favorably received. Most Spanish authors
as well as the mass media that mentioned the Bábí Faith from that
moment on based themselves on Gobineau’s work, mirroring both its
vices and its virtues.

The first publication in Spain taking material directly from
Gobineau in its coverage of the Bábí Faith appeared in 1868, when
the first Spanish translation of Ernst Renan’s Les Apotres [The
Apostles] was published in Barcelona by the printer “La Ilustración.”
It is quite probable that this publication was originally a supplement in
one of the daily newspapers and journals distributed by that publisher,
although no such proof has yet been found to substantiate this
suspicion. One year later, the same work was published by José
Codina, another Barcelona printer.

Juan Valera

One of the nineteenth century’s most outstanding writers and
thinkers was Juan Valera (1824-1905). Holding degrees in philosophy
and jurisprudence, Valera had a long diplomatic and political career.
He worked in several consulates in Europe and South America prior to
his being appointed ambassador in Frankfurt (1865). He would later
serve as ambassador in Lisbon; Washington, D.C.; and Brussels. In
1858, he was elected as a member of the Spanish Parliament, and in
1872 he accepted a senior post within the Ministry of State
Education. Also worthy of mention, from a cultural standpoint, are
his induction in 1861 into Spain’s Royal Academy of the Spanish
Language, and in 1904 into the Royal Academy of Moral and Political
Sciences.

As a writer, he was a prolific novelist and essayist. He was also a
renowned correspondent. Among his most famous novels are Pepita
Jiménez and Juanita la Larga.

In 1868, he submitted his article titled Sobre el concepto que hoy
se forma de España [Perceptions of Spain Today], which was
published simultaneously in the magazines La América and La Revista
de España10. In it, Valera attempted to tackle the issue of Spain’s

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven          71

decadence at the time and how the country was perceived by the rest
of Europe. In the first section of his article he posits his theory about
the fate of civilizations. To Valera, peoples and races do not perish,
but rather alternate between periods of decadence and remarkable
achievement. He perceives the peoples of Aryan descent as best
exemplifying his theory and, after reviewing the cases pertaining to
other nations, has this to say about Persia:

> Persia succumbs to Alexander’s rule, but once again becomes
> a powerful, formidable, and feared rival of the Roman
> Empire under the Sassanid dynasty. In the time of the
> Ghazna sultans, during the Middle Ages, Persia’s civilization
> shines with extraordinary splendor. Her epic and lyrical
> poets, her arts and sciences of the time are superior to those
> of the rest of the world7. Later on, her philosophical and
> religious schools and sects begin to flourish, as well as the
> lyrical, and even dramatic, poetry that comes into being there
> in our own age. Recently, the strange historical phenomenon
> marked by the appearance and spread of Babism [sic] has
> made evident the intellectual and moral vigor of that race,
> that perchance it may become regenerated and arise anew to
> the heights of its sister European races, when a more fertile
> and noble coming into being arrives to awaken and bestir
> it.11
Valera was not to be the only Spanish author that would see in the
Bábí Faith a new hope for Persia’s progress. Nor would this be his last
reference to the new religion.

In October / November 1889, he published an article titled La
Religión de la Humanidad [Humanity’s Religion] in La España
Moderna.12 It was in fact a letter addressed to Chilean philosopher
Enrique Lagarrigue (1852-1927). Both authors maintained an
interesting correspondence in which they debated the role and future
of religion. Valera, contrary to Lagarrigue, believed in the vigor and
usefulness of religion. Throughout the development of his argument,
he writes:

> I believe that we are living squarely in an age of faith, and
> that if losing it signifies progress, then we could scarcely
> boast about progress. Even now, in the middle of this
> century, in 1847, a new religion has appeared in Persia, one
> which has made rivers of blood to flow and given the world
> untold martyrs. This religion’s moral core is very pure and
> tender-hearted; its sacred writings, highly poetic; its beliefs
> and its love in god and of god [sic], profound. Count
> Gobineau and Mr. Franck, of the French Institute, have set
out its doctrines and written the history of this recent

72           Chronicles of a Birth

> religion, Babism, whose cardinal dogma is god’s [sic]
> incarnation in nineteen persons.
Upon comparing these two excerpts from Valera’s writings against
excerpts about the Bábí Faith from other Spanish authors of the
period, we see that they are highly representative of the approach
taken by Spanish intellectuals in the final decades of the nineteenth
century toward the Bábís.

The Diccionario Universal

Following the publication in 1862 of Charles Dreyss’s Cronología
Universal, we know of no other reference work in Spanish that
mentions the Báb until 1876, the year in which the second volume of
the Diccionario Universal edited by Nicolás María Serrano was
published.

Said volume contained definitions for the entries Bab and Babism
[sic]. All of the information contained in both volumes is clearly
taken from Gobineau’s Religions et Philosophies. The term Bab [sic]
is defined thus:

> Bab [sic]: Biog. Celebrated Persian reformer born in 1825 and
> killed when he was barely thirty years old; his actual name
> was Mirza-Alí-Mohammed [sic]; he belonged to the middle
> class and had received a rigorous education; he planted, so to
> speak, the seeds of a new doctrine destined perhaps to
> transform Islamism; always occupied with pious works, he
> had extraordinarily simple habits and a pleasing tender-
> heartedness, revealing these gifts through a marvelously
> enchanting personality and a kindly and penetrating
> eloquence of speech: he was incapable, those that knew him
> attested, of uttering anything without shaking the very core
> of the hearts of his listeners; his doctrine, which borrows
> somewhat from Greek philosophy, is full of flowery phrases
> reminiscent of a “Paradise of roses.”
> In defining the term Babism, the dictionary provides an article
comprising ten columns divided into two sections — Historia del
Babismo [History of Babism] and Exposición de la Doctrina del
Babismo [Exposition of the Doctrine of Babism] — preceded by a
preamble. In total, the article comprises four pages summarizing point
by point the very topics Gobineau covered in the chapters he devoted
to the Bábí Faith. As can be gleaned from the quote above, the tone
that is used is highly positive. Indeed, it is the very tone that has been
generally employed since then, and well into the twentieth century, by
all dictionaries and encyclopedias containing an entry pertaining to
Babism. Consequently, it replicates those same conceptual and
historical errors committed by Gobineau.

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven           73

It is especially interesting to see how the figure of ˇáhirih is dealt
with: “Not for nothing has a woman been one of the staunchest of
apostles, one of the most valiant of martyrs of this new religion; in
Guret-ul-Ayn [sic] (the Eloquent, the Beautiful), the entire female sex
has been liberated, ennobled, glorified; reduced by Islamism to the
condition of mere objects, women in Asia will henceforth be
considered as persons.” And further on: “Her beauty, her spirit, her
eloquence, her knowledge, her singular exaltation is forever engraved
in the memory of those that witnessed this drama.”

In late 1876, Francisco García Ayuso published his Iran o del Indo
al Tigris [Iran or From the Indus to the Tigris], devoting three pages
to the Bábís. Meanwhile, his pupil, diplomat Adolfo Rivadeneyra, was
making his way to Persia. His chronicle of the trip included a lengthy
explanation of the faith taught by the Báb. Several years later, in
1889, Náßiri’d-Dín Sháh visited Europe for his third and final time.
As a result, the Spanish press, as it had done in 1873, made mention
of the Bábís yet again. One important writer, Countess Emilia Pardo
Bazán, was able to meet the Sháh. On account of this encounter, that
same year she would write Un Diocleciano [A Diocletian (alluding to
Roman emperor Gaius Aurelius Valerius Diocletanius, noted for his
persecution of Christians)], a work whose title hints at its stirring
content. We will, on another occasion, deal with this and other
subjects in greater detail when we explore references made to the
Faith from late 1876 until 1895.
