In Bangladesh, a large number of people of different communities and indigenous
groups, being inspired with that same spirit have become Bahais. Let me here
acknowledge the main sources from which I have drawn the information on Bahais in
Bangladesh. I conducted interviews and consulted written documents provided by
individuals whom I met and consulted in their Bahai Centre located at Shantinagar,
Dhaka, and where I made my own observations. I am especially indebted to those who
have helped me with some rare and important unpublished written documents and other
valuable information. I may specially acknowledge Mahmudul Haq, Abdullah Brooks (an
American scientist with the ICDDRB, who has been living in Bangladesh for over twelve

years), Rahim Sarwar, Mr. M ilon and Mr. Rashidunnabi. All of them are knowledgeable
Bahais.

Bahai tradition in Bangladesh: early contacts:

Bahai contacts with the Indian subcontinent may be dated from the very inception of the
propagation of this new religious movement. This contact was predominantly commercial.
Some early disciples, including relatives of the Bab (forerunner of the Bahaullah, founder
of Bahai faith) had business offices in Bombay, India. The first converts in India were
from the Parsee community in Bombay. More organized efforts to propagate the faith in
India started at the time of Bahaullah, when in 1872 he sent a learned Persian, Sulaiman

Khan Tunukabani, better known as Jamal Effendi, to India. This Jamal Effendi was an
influential figure in the cultural life of the Indian subcontinent. He visited almost all the
major cities of India and arrived in Kolkata in 1878. In the course of his travels in India he
met a young man, Siyyid Mustafa Roumi, in Madras. Impressed by the great spiritual
personality of Effendi, Roumi accepted the new religious faith and accompanied him on
his journey to Bengal and Burma. Jamal Effendi was an influential preacher and had a
large following of learned Bahai missionaries. They sought out great Muslim religious and
other notables and discussed with them the advent of a new message from God. By their
religious fervor, missionary zeal, exemplary character and humanitarian activities, they
could greatly influence the minds of the masses and attract them to Bahai faith. On their
way to Burma Jamal Effendi and Roumi stopped in Dhaka and Chittagong for a few days
and met notables of both cities. There is no doubt that under the guidance of Effendi
Mustafa Roumi played a vital role in introduction of Bahai faith in Bangladesh.

In the late eighteen-nineties and early thirties Bahais from the West had a large share in
the spread of Bahai Faith among the great scholars and leaders. These Persian and
Western Bahais had detailed discussions with Indian Intelligentsia that included poet Sir
Mohammad Iqbal, Sarojiono Naidu, Annie Besant, Rabindranath Tagore and rulers of the
Indian native states and their prime ministers. Miss Martha Root, an American Bahai,
who met Tagore on Feb. 13 & 14, 1938, remarks in her published memories he talked
about his deep love and appreciation of Abdul Baha. There was an excellent collection of
Bahai books in the library of Santiniketan. Tagore expressed hope that there would be a
Bahai chair at Santiniketan. Those Bahais created a good impression on their listeners
with their vast knowledge, modesty and tolerance of and respect for the views of others.

First conversion to the new religion among the masses by Jamal Effendi’s and Mustafa
Roumi’s efforts occurred in Burma. Missionary zeal and ideal life of Jamal Effendi’s
companion Mustafa Roumi gained a large number of converts particularly from the
villages. He served the cause of Bahai Faith in many ways and due to his good efforts in
Barma drew the attention of a sizeable Bengali community there. One Sultan Gazi is
considered to be the first person to accept the new religion from among the Bengalies. By
the mid-1930s there was a small Bahai group in Chittagong. Small Bahai group belonging
to Satkania, Panchlaish and Putia of Chittagong were brought into the faith by Mustafa
Roumi, Sultan Gazi and some other Burmese Bahais. At the time of the partition of India
in 1947 there were about nine Bahais in what became East Pakistan, all of them living in
Chittagong.

In December 1948, Amjad Ali of Bihar, India settled downed in Dhaka with the aim of
developing the Bahai community in East Pakistan. He was followed byhis relatives and
some other Bahais from West Bengal. Taking advantage of the peaceful atmosphere he
was able to establish a local governing body (local spiritual assembly) in Dhaka in 1952.
It was the first local council to be elected in the eastern part of Pakistan. Later on with
gradual increase in the number of Bahais another local assembly was elected in
Chittagong in 1955 and a third one in Mymensingha in 1961.

Hundreds of Bahai preachers subsequently came to then East Pakistan in different times
from Iran, India, the USA, and other countries to help locally settled Bahais in promoting
the Bahai Faith. Some of those pioneers even settled down in Bangladesh for the sake of
their religion (a person who settles in a foreign country for the sake of promoting religion
is called by the Bahais a ‘pioneer’). In 1965 a great initiative was taken to spread the
message of Baha Faith among the rural people. By 1971 there were about ten local
assemblies in the province. To make the efforts more dynamic a Bahai centre was
established at Shanti Nagar in Dhaka.

With emergence of independent Bangladesh, Bahais also formed their own National
Spiritual Assembly, which was elected in April 1972. This assembly and thirteen local
assemblies were incorporated on June 2, 1972. Soon after the independence of
Bangladesh, a delegation of Bahai representatives which included a Bahai dignitaryfrom
India (Shirin Boman, Counselor) met the then Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
The Prime Minister assured the delegation that all religious minorities were free to
practice their religions     in the independent, sovereign and secular Bangladesh. Bahais
have continued this practice of meeting with President, Prime Minister, Ministers, Police
Chiefs, Justices and other relevant authorities .At the end of the first decade of
independence there were Bahais in 465 localities and 83 local assemblies. Bahai religion
was also taken to minority ethnic groups particularly in Chittagong and Rajshahi.

Ethnic and Religious Background:

Bahai Faith came with the Iranian Indian and Western Bahais. The missionary works of
pioneers and preachers and the acceptance of Bahai faith by the Muslims, Hindus, and
different ethnic groups—who were attracted by its religious simplicity and social equality
and justice—resulted in the growth of the Bahai population and development of the Bahai
Society of Bangladesh. I talked to some learned and lay converted Bahais in their
Centrein Shanti Nagar, Dhaka and asked them why and how you have been attracted to

a newfaith? All of them gave a more or less uniform answer: “Bahai vision of unity.” Let
me share with you a view of a learned Bahai on this point.

> During the late seventies, I was serving in a Bank in Karachi, Pakistan. I came of a
> Muslimfamily but had lost my faith due to prejudices among Muslims. One day I found a
> bookabout the Bahai faith entitled Bahaullah and New Eraand I immediately picked it up. I
> read the book and was immediately attractedto the Bahai vision of Unity. When I learned
> about the Bahai concept of the unityof mankind, I was much exited. I was inspired by the
> Bahai teachings, because they were free of prejudice.

In 1989, after becoming a Bahai, he migrated (as a pioneer) to Bangladesh, to help with
Bahai projects in and outside Dhaka and topromote development among Bahai
community in Bangladesh. Finally he settled downed in Dhaka.

Bahai people of Bangladesh come from different religious communities and ethnic
groups. The immigrant Bahais belong mainly to the stock of the Persians, Indian and
Western countries. Till now no accurate statistical surveys, sociological studies or
population projection have been made to determine the number of followers. But a
conservative estimate by the early 1990s says that there are around 60,000Bahais in
Bangladesh. Bangladeshi Bahais are serving in various important elected and appointed
positions of the country. Bahais are thinly spread allover the country. Socially it is difficult
to categorize Bangladeshi Bahais, but the majority of them lives in villages and generally
belong to the lower middleclass. Bahais of both urban and village areas are engaged
apart from agriculture, in small business, government and private employment and
technical jobs. Bangladeshi Bahais have achieved about 95 percent literacy rate in
contrast to a national literacy rate of less than 50%.

Bahai literature in Bengali:

The first Bahai book to be translated into Bengali was Bahaullah and the NewEra, written
by Dr. J.E Esslemont, an English Bahai. It was translated by Amirul Islam, a dedicated
Bengali Bahai. This translation was published in 1936 inKolkata. This book is considered
to be the authoritative introduction to the Bahai faith. This book is very important because
it is followed by translations of Bahai holy scriptures like the Hidden Words and the Kitab-
i-Iqan(Book of Certitude). These two books were translated by Safdar Ahmed, a Bahai
from Chittagong. Presently there are about 60 titles in Bengali language, ranging in
subjects from the writings of the central figures of the religion to its history, administrative
system, introduction to religion and textbooks for Bahai students. It should be mentioned
that all of these books have been translated from English versions. There are also many
Bahai booklets and pamphlets in Bengali. These too are translations of English versions.
Some periodicals are also published, though not very regularly. One such periodical
Bangladesh e-Journal of Sociology. Volume 8, Number 1. 2011

isNobo Dibosh, which is being published since July 1987. The most sacred and important
scripture of Bahais is the Kitab-i-Aqdas (Most Holy Book). Revealed during the dark days
of Bahaullah’s imprisonment in Acre, it is the chief repository of the laws and institutions
which Bahaullah designed for the world order he conceived. It was written in Arabic and
is characterized by a wide range of styles. The Most Holy Book was translated into
Bengali from its authorized English version for publicationin 1998. Bahais keep their
library opened to all. Therefore anyone can visit their library and collect pamphlets and
periodicals.

Social Work:

Let me start this section with a quotation, “Let your vision be world embracing,rather than
confined to your own self.” Therefore around the globe, Bahais are united by a common
outlook that holds to high moral standards, a modern worldview, and a commitment to
serving the wider community. As a result Bhais consider spreading the message of
religious tolerance, cooperation, unity, consultation and village-based decision-making as
laying the foundation of a new society which will solve social ills more comprehensively
and more effectively. Bahais believe that the purpose of earthly life is to acquire spiritual
qualities, such as love, faith, and self-service. They seek to fulfill this purpose through
avariety personal, family, and community actions. They undertake public projects as
important means for the training of the soul. In the same way with growing numbers plus
increasing resources and experience, Bahais in Bangladesh are taking up more and
more projects of social work like medical camps, vocational training and the like. In 1983
the National Bahai Development Institute was established to train teachers for village
tutorial schools, as well as for running clinics for poor women and children. Since1994
annual courses are held to train rural health workers. Conscious efforts are made to
involve women in all community affairs. Women are serving in important Bahai
administrative posts. They have served as secretary of National Spiritual Assembly in
Bangladesh.

Propagation of the faith:

Giving the message of Bahai religion to others is called ‘teaching the Cause’ bythe
Bahais. In the absence of a clergy this is an obligation of every individual Bahai. In
Bangladesh the method usually adopted is that Bahais go to a village where there is
already a Bahai or a sympathizer who helps in meeting people interested to hear about
the Bahai religion. They keep many pamphlets, booklets, newsletters; periodicals etc.
Bangladesh e-Journal of Sociology. Volume 8, Number 1. 2011

onthe shelves of their centers’ libraries by which interested non-Bahais can easily know
about the faith.

Concluding comment: Bahai impact on society:

The total number of Bahais in Bangladesh is too small for them to have any major direct
impact on society at large.          But by bringing together people from different religious,
cultural and social backgrounds, especially at the village level, and by their systematic
efforts to overcome religious sectarianism, promote education of children and better
concepts about women they can attract the attention of others and through them expect
to have positive influence upon the wider society. Till now they have been able to
maintain a peaceful co-existence with others and live a happy life in Bangladesh.
