           “I Know Not How to Sing Thy Praise”
> Reflections on a Prayer of Bahá’u’lláh

Wolfgang Klebel

This prayer by Bahá’u’lláh1 gives access to the basic question of theol-
ogy about “God” for this day and age, in which practical and theoretical
atheism and irreligion have captured at least half of mankind, not only
in the East but also in the West. It presents an answer to the question
how to believe in God today and how to understand words like the
following in another prayer by Bahá'u'lláh: “O Thou Who art the most
manifest of the manifest and the most hidden of the hidden!” (PM 248)

In these reflections the four modes of Revelation described by the Báb
are used to understand the theological location of the many prayers of
the Bahá’í Manifestations. According to the Báb, prayer is the second
mode of Revelation after the Verses of God. Here the language of
revelation is uttered in the voice of the Prophet Who now speaks in
the station of the creation, addressing the Creator with an attitude of
servitude and effacement (an affirmation of ‘Thou art God’)2 .

“kneeling” and “sitting” theology.3 This distinction between the two

> plative prayer, on the one hand, and to a theology as scientific and
> educational understanding of the Revelation, on the other. This

distinction can benefit the student of theology and clarify issues,
previously not clear.

The reflections on this prayer of Bahá'u'lláh brings a number of
important questions to light. What is the difference between not
knowing how to praise and describe God in the Bahá'í Faith, and
the denial of the existence of God in atheism? What is the relation
of the Manifestation to God? Consequently, how do these questions
affect religion in today’s world? What is the meaning of modern
atheism and agnosticism and in what way has the understanding of
God changed during the last centuries? Does theology today have to
be a “post-atheistic” theology and has any previous theology become
inadequate? What is the theological position of the praying person
and what is prayer and what is it not? What should we pray for and
what is the effect of prayer?

According to the Bahá’í principle of progressive revelation, every rev-
elation responds to the needs of the time; every revelation abolishes,
conserves, and expands the previous revelations. Therefore, trying
to find new theological insights from Bahá'í prayers is a legitimate
scholarly task and this paper attempts to serve as an example of this
process. Consequently, Bahá’í theology can legitimately be called
progressive theology as it documents the progress of understanding
the Bahá'í Revelation throughout the time given to this Revelation.

These reflections have a personal aspect. Bahá’í prayers are used by
the faithful as private prayers. It appears to be the first time in the
history of religion, that the prayers of the Manifestation are used by
the faithful in this personal way. The following reflections helped the
writer and, hopefully, will help the reader to improve their devotional
life and to understand what is expressed when reciting or chanting
Bahá'í prayers. Any theological inquiry needs to be applicable in the
life of the faithful; otherwise, “such academic pursuits as begin and end
in words alone have never been and will never be of any worth.” (TB 169)

Reflections on a Prayer of Bahá’u’lláh

Let us now turn to Bahá’u’lláh’s prayer which is divided into four
paragraphs. The first describes the Not-knowing of how to sing God’s
praise, how to describe God’s glory and how to call God’s name. In
this paragraph, it is emphasized that no creature can do this. This
impotence is extended to the issue of praising God’s essential oneness,
which is included in this declaration of impotence, of Not-Knowing.
Any attempt to do this is described as vain imagination.

In the second paragraph the impossibility of knowing God is again
pointed out, but then the mercy of God is depicted, which allows
the servant to praise God. It presents a colorful picture of this praise.
Further, it is noted that this praise will result in the believers attain-
ing what God has destined for them through divine will and purpose.

In the third paragraph, the total impotence of all created beings, even
of the Manifestations to praise God, is again declared. Following this,
it is explained that it is God—the all Powerful and Supreme Ruler—
Who draws the believer towards Him.

In the last paragraph this relationship between God and the human
person is again the topic and it is emphasized the personal charac-
teristics necessary to appeal to God’s mercy and grace. Moreover, it
is again pointed out that God is the cause of the prayer, which allows
the servant to reach the heights to which he aspires. The closure of
the prayer again lauds God’s forgiving mercy and bountiful gift.

Bahá’u’lláh’s Prayer

> All-praise be to Thee, O Lord, my God! I know not how to sing
> Thy praise, how to describe Thy glory, how to call upon Thy
> Name. If I call upon Thee by Thy Name, the All-Possessing, I
> am compelled to recognize that He Who holdeth in His hand
> the immediate destinies of all created things is but a vassal

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

dependent upon Thee, and is the creation of but a word pro-
ceeding from Thy mouth. And if I proclaim Thee by the name
of Him Who is the All-Compelling, I readily discover that He
is but a suppliant fallen upon the dust, awe-stricken by Thy
dreadful might, Thy sovereignty and power. And if I attempt
to describe Thee by glorifying the oneness of Thy Being, I soon
realize that such a conception is but a notion which mine own
fancy hath woven, and that Thou hast ever been immeasurably
exalted above the vain imaginations which the hearts of men
have devised.

The glory of Thy might beareth me witness! Whoso claimeth to
have known Thee hath, by virtue of such a claim, testified to his
own ignorance; and whoso believeth himself to have attained
unto Thee, all the atoms of the earth would attest his powerless-
ness and proclaim his failure. Thou hast, however, by virtue of
Thy mercy that hath surpassed the kingdoms of earth and heaven,
deigned to accept from Thy servants the laud and honor they
pay to Thine own exalted Self, and hast bidden them celebrate
Thy glory, that the ensigns of Thy guidance may be unfurled in
Thy cities and the tokens of Thy mercy be spread abroad among
Thy nations, and that each and all may be enabled to attain
unto that which Thou hast destined for them by Thy decree, and
ordained unto them through Thine irrevocable will and purpose.

Having testified, therefore, unto mine own impotence and the
impotence of Thy servants, I beseech Thee, by the brightness of
the light of Thy beauty, not to refuse Thy creatures attainment
to the shores of Thy most holy ocean. Draw them, then, O my
God, through the Divine sweetness of Thy melodies, towards the
throne of Thy glory and the seat of Thine eternal holiness. Thou
art, verily, the Most Powerful, the Supreme Ruler, the Great
Giver, the Most Exalted, the Ever-Desired.

Reflections on a Prayer of Bahá’u’lláh

> Grant, then, O my God, that Thy servant who hath turned
> towards Thee, hath fixed his gaze upon Thee, and clung to the
> cord of Thy mercifulness and favor, may be enabled to partake
> of the living waters of Thy mercy and grace. Cause him, then,
> to ascend unto the heights to which he aspireth, and withhold
> him not from that which Thou dost possess. Thou art, verily, the
> Ever-Forgiving, the Most Bountiful (PM 122–124).

Here follows the commentary sentence by sentence, interrupted by
personal reflections and theological comments.
All-praise be to Thee, O Lord, my God!
This prayer starts with an invocation of God in which the approach
to God is a personal and direct address: “O Lord, my God.” This is a
conventional way of addressing God, common to the religions of the
past. There is no doubt expressed to whom this prayer is directed, no
doubt that it articulates the dependent existence of the supplicant and
no doubt that all praise and glory belongs to Him, who is addressed
in this first sentence as the Lord of life, the God of creation. After
this conventional introduction that places the prayer in the spiritual
sphere of openness to God, we come to the surprising claim that the
believer, who comes to His Lord, does not know how to do what he
is attempting to do.
> I know not how to sing Thy praise, how to describe Thy glory,
> how to call upon Thy Name.
This sentence contains the main topic of the first part of the prayer.
The three basic affirmations that are included in prayers of all religions

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

are mentioned and we are asked to admit that we “know not” how to
articulate them. In other words, we do not know how to pray, how to
raise our voice to God and sing His praise, how to give Him Glory and
even how to call His Name. It is as if we do not know any more how to
say even the Lord’s Prayer to “Our Father in Heaven.” This is the first
statement and the most ominous declaration of this prayer, i.e. to have
to admit that we “know not” how to pray.

It appears that after the suppliant has addressed God in the conven-
tional manner of all religions, he stops and confesses an impotence
and inability to go farther. I “know not,” I am incapable, I am helpless
and I am not even able to ask for help to pray. “I know not how to call
upon Thy Name.”

One of the roots of modern atheism is this “not knowing,” this
agnosticism, this helplessness in the face of modern science and all
the tragedies, evils and catastrophes of life. We do not know any
more how to call to God, how to pray to Him and how to mention
His Name. This is illustrated by a Jewish friend who lost her faith
when her entire family perished in Nazi concentration camps. Even
though she calls herself agnostic, she has even stated that she wished
she could believe. In other words, she is one of those who no longer
know how to call God’s name.

Another reason why we “know not to pray” is modern science. The
knowledge of science has removed the naïve childlike ability to
trust and believe in God, to accept Our Father in Heaven and to
give Him glory and honor. We do not know any more to whom to
direct our prayer; the God of the old religions has ceased to exist for
many of us. Even many apparently religious people are really agnos-
tics in the sense that they do not know any more how to address the
God in Whom they claim to believe. Instead, they may cling to the
God of their childhood, when they heard the story of Moses and

Reflections on a Prayer of Bahá’u’lláh

of Jesus, Mohammed, or the Buddha and when they still knew to
Whom to pray.

Yet, when we go to work, when we live the modern life with all its
technology and electronic equipment, do we really believe in God and
pray to him in that old fashioned way? Can we? Do we thank Him for
all the modern technological achievements, or is He no longer in the
picture of our practical life.

Hence, it is not only the unbeliever, who was raised in atheistic Rus-
sia or China, it is not only the capitalist, whose God is money—it is
everybody, who “knows not” how to praise God and sing His glory.
The world today has lost its religious aura. God has been removed
from this world and He seems to have lost out. 4 Growing numbers of
people wonder “who needs Him anyway?’

Bahá’u’lláh identifies the place where the paths of believers and non-
believers part: the “dwellers of the city of self… adorning their heads
and their bodies with the emblem of knowledge, have proudly rejected
Thee and turned away from Thy beauty. (PM 77). It is clear that it
is not the difficulty to know God, not the honest question about
God’s existence that has been raised in the last centuries, which
Bahá’u’lláh deplores, rather, it is the selfishness of man, the self cen-
teredness of the “dwellers of the city of self ” that creates this rejection
of God’s message. Additionally, it is the pride in their knowledge
that prevents them from recognizing the truth of creation and turn
away from Him.

To confess with Bahá’u’lláh in a prayer to God that we know not how
to pray is the total opposite from the modern man who, in all his
knowledge, proudly claims, yes, we do know that there is no God and
we can prove scientifically that God does not exist.

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

While the acceptance of God’s plan for man was always a challenge
and was always open to rejection, now it is not only the message that
is questioned, it is the One who sends the message, Whose existence
is questioned. Is there a God or not is the question of our time. The
two thousand year quest of Christianity to define God and religion
and the numerous different ways of doing so has created this great
insecurity about God’s existence. Forcefully and belligerently pit-
ting one way of defending religion against another has led to war
and discord among the believers of the Messenger of love, and unity.

Theological Comment: Modern Atheism

> Karl Marx (1818–1883), the most influential of modern atheists,
> was not unfamiliar with the religious and philosophical issues of his
> time. His formulation of the question of God’s existence for the 19th
> Century, assumed the authority of science and philosophy. It found
> dedicated believers all over the world, in spite of the fact that all his
“scientific” predictions failed to materialize. In his early writings in

1844, Karl Marx made the following fundamental announcement:
“The foundation of irreligious criticism is this: man makes religion,

religion does not make man.”5 Man makes God, not God makes man.

Teilhard de Chardin’s answers to this question present an unexpected
view from which the solution needs to come. He understands Marx’s
point about man making God but answers it rather ingeniously
through his new understanding of evolution and creation. Teilhard
states “Properly speaking, God does not make: He makes things
make themselves”6

> One could follow Marx’s statement about man making God to its
> logical conclusion and say that the problem is exactly this belief that
“Man makes religion”, because any man-made religion is restricting

the conception of God as Bahá'u'lláh revealed:

> Some, deluded by their idle fancies, have conceived all created
> things as associates and partners of God, and imagined them-
> selves to be the exponents of His unity. By Him Who is the one
> true God! Such men have been, and will continue to remain, the
> victims of blind imitation, and are to be numbered with them that
> have restricted and limited the conception of God (GWB 166).

> This verse clearly states that any attempt to draw God down into
> the world, which happens in pantheism and in all attempts to try
“to know God” in theism, leads consequently to atheism, because it

restricts and limits the conception of God.

Marx’s statements were not new but followed the tradition of the
French Enlightenment7 and of the German Hegelian philosophical
school of thought. 8 This atheistic and irreligious ideology in Com-
munism and in a similar attempt in National Socialism led to all
the horrendous consequences of a world without or against God,
and caused one tenth of humankind to perish in wars, persecution,
torture and terror. The numbers of people killed, starved or worked
to death, or condemned to die during the last century is about 100
million.9 The defenders of atheism never seem to even consider this
historical fact.

Modern atheism has been called postulatory,10 indicating that the non-
existence of God has to be postulated in order to preserve the dignity
of the human condition and the freedom of man. Karl Marx intended
to free man from the shackles of the religion and politics of his time
and anticipated a time in the future when the “free development of
each is the condition for the free development of all”.11 None of these
developments ever took place where Marx’s ideology was applied.

During the last two thousand years of Christianity, the existence of
God was never really in question, even though our understanding
of God has changed over time. In her book, “The History of God”,

> Karen Armstrong describes the development of the understanding of
> God in the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions. Her last chapter
“Does God have a Future?” ends with the statement: “Human beings

> cannot endure emptiness and desolation; they will fill the vacuum by
> creating a new focus of meaning. The idols of fundamentalism are not
> good substitutes for God; if we are to create a vibrant new faith for
> the twenty-first century, we should, perhaps, ponder the history of
> God for some lessons and warnings.”12

In spite of her theologically and historically excellent analysis and
her well-founded warnings about the history of religion, Karen Arm-
strong—in this writer’s opinion—misses the point here. Human
beings cannot fill the vacuum, especially after they declared the
death of God and they cannot re-create a new faith. Her statement
is yet another expression of a modern woman, who wishes she could
believe, but who “knows not how.”

> When teaching Bahá’u’lláh’s message, we need to be cognizant of the

Theological Comment: Apophatic Theology

It seems that any attempt “to know God” in human terms will nec-
essarily conclude with a picture of God that reasonable thinking
people today find unacceptable. That is the meaning of the famous
declaration of Nietzsche about the death of God, i.e., any God, we
could ever know is dead, we have killed this God.

It needs to be noted here that not-knowing God, that the fact we
cannot know who God is has a long tradition in theology and is
described under the term Apophatic Theology. Stephen Lambden in
his paper “The Background and Centrality of Apophatic Theology in
Bábí and Bahá’í Scripture” states:

> The following paper will attempt to trace aspects of the his-
> tory of the theological position of the incomprehensibility-
> unknowability of God in past major Abrahamic religions
> and to highlight its importance and significance for contem-
> porary Bahá’ís. 14

After describing the history of this concept in Jewish, Christian
and Islamic religion (especially as expressed in the Shiite tradition),
Lambden describes how this Apophatic Theology pervades all of
Bahá’í Scripture. God cannot be known by His creatures, all what
we know is the Revelation given us through His messengers, the
Manifestations. Lambden’s conclusion is:

> Apophasis as unknowing can be experienced by the Bahá’í
> who seeks the God whose door is ever closed though ever
> open. Through the Manifestation of God the door to divine
> knowledge is eternally open. Yet mystical bewilderment
> before the Divine is an experience of unknowing: “To merit
> the madness of love, man must abound in sanity”. To approach

> the All-Knowing human beings must be full of the ecstasy of
> unknowing; spiritual excitement before the Ultimate Deity.

Bahá’u’lláh in this prayer will lead to the understanding that the
confession of not-knowing is the presupposition of knowing God and
praising him. It is God Who in his mercy and through His manifes-
tations has opened up the way for humans to praise God, as will be
shown in the commentary below.

In this context, it is necessary to ask, “What is the relationship
between modern atheism and apophatic theology?” In other words
what is the difference between apophatic theology and postulatory
atheism, which thinks it has negated God’s existence in order to
allow man to be free and himself? What is the distinction between
postulatory atheism and an apophatic theology which teaches that
man knows not how to praise God and how to describe God’s glory
and how to call upon God? Deciding between the two appears to be
the same decision which is described in the book of Genesis when
the serpent told Eve that in not serving God and not following His
commands, man shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

> And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
> For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes
> shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

(Genesis 3:4–5)

In fact, Adam and Eve did die, did lose the paradise and were expelled
into a life that ends in death. Translating this primitive picture into
our time, one could say that the same happened during the last cen-
tury; atheism, instead of making man free and bringing the paradise-
like new changes to earth, brought nothing but death, war and misery
encompassing most of this earth. The new man, as postulated by
Marx, who had celebrated the death of God and had declared the
end of religion, is declaring a new “religion of atheism”—better called

“irreligion,”—yet, he did not become as gods, did not know all (good

> and evil), but ended up in war and destruction of human life and
> civilization. As Bahá’u’lláh stated: the dust of irreligion hath enwrapped
> all men (SLH 67). His interpreter Shoghi Effendi has explicated this,
> describing state atheism as irreligion in the last century:

> From Soviet Russia a definitely anti-religious Communism
> is pushing west into Europe and America, East into Persia,
> India, China and Japan. It is an economic theory, definitely
> harnessed to disbelief in God. It is a religious irreligion…
> (WOB 1181)

And he has described it as a worldwide phenomenon, which is affecting
the Western world as well, weakening the moral fiber of civilization
even today:

> In these days when the forces of irreligion are weakening the
> moral fiber, and undermining the foundations of individual
> morality, the obligation of chastity and holiness must claim
> an increasing share of the attention of the American believers,
> both in their individual capacities and as the responsible cus-
> todians of the interests of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. (ADJ 29)

It is the not-knowing of God that opens up the real knowledge of
God, it is the apophatic theology, the theology that admits that we
cannot know God, and it is the conviction that we have to give up all
attempts to know God that is the presupposition of any real know-
ing of God. This attitude of impotence and accepted limitation, this
acceptance of being created, is required, before we can know God.
This was expressed by the Báb in these words:

> I have known Thee by Thy making known unto me that Thou
> art unknowable to anyone save Thyself. (SWB196)

In the tradition of apophatic theology, a similar statement was made
in the last century by the Jewish philosopher Franz Rosenzweig
(1886–1929), who stated

> Of God we know nothing. Yet, this Not-Knowing is the
> Not-Knowing of God, as such, this is the beginning of our
> Knowing of Him.15

In the biblical thinking, which is not concerned about the essence
of God, but is mainly talking about God’s wisdom for this world,
the fact that we cannot know God was expressed in terms of God’s
providence for man. Paul in Romans 11:33–35 expressed this in
these words:

> O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of
> God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past
> finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who
> hath been his counsellor?
> If I call upon Thee by Thy Name, the All-Possessing, I am com-
> pelled to recognize that He Who holdeth in His hand the imme-
> diate destinies of all created things is but a vassal dependent
> upon Thee, and is the creation of but a word proceeding from
> Thy mouth
At the first reading of that prayer, I was shocked; I could not believe
it and tried to interpret the following statement in any other pos-
sible way. Yet, what is said here leaves no doubt: this “not knowing” is
attributed to all humans, even to the Manifestations of God.

This is the situation of the world today, where at least one third of
humankind has been educated to ridicule and reject the mere idea

of God. The other two thirds have a tainted picture of what religion
is. Bahá’u’lláh in this prayer does not apologize for this situation or
helplessly deplore it, nor does He try to go back to the old security
of knowing. He does not even try to dispute it; on the contrary, He
carries the “not knowing,” of which He speaks much farther and
gives it its proper place in the understanding of God. Furthermore,
He includes Himself in this “not knowing.” He acknowledges this
fact of “not knowing.” His understanding of God, which culminates
in His and everybody else’s “not knowing” becomes a guiding light
for modern man and the basis of a theology of the future.

Here Bahá’u’lláh speaks not only of you and of me, of women and
man, of believers and unbelievers. Instead, he explicitly speaks of
Himself; of Him, “Who holdeth in His hand the immediate destinies of
all created things.16” Without any doubt, He includes in this “I know
not” the Manifestations of God.

Theological Comment: Manifestation of God
In these words, Bahá’u’lláh describes the Manifestation as “the cre-
ation of but a word proceeding from Thy mouth.” With this statement,
He reminds us of the Prolog to the Gospel of John (1:1–3) speaking
about Christ as the Word of God, “In the beginning was the Word, and
the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning
with God. All things were made through Him and without Him nothing
was made that was made.”

What the gospel describes in a static and historical way as happening
“in the beginning,” Bahá’u’lláh brings into the present and affirms that

> the Manifestation holds the immediate destiny of all created things
> in His hand: Here and now and in reality17. Given this divine power,
> one would expect that the Manifestations at least know God; that
> They for sure know how to sing His praise, describe His glory, and

call to Him upon His Name. Yet, Bahá’u’lláh clearly states that they
are nothing but dependent vassals of God and created by His word.
Even they participate in the “know-not” of all creation. That fact alone
should give us an indication that this not-knowing is not merely a rhe-
torical phrase but an ontological statement, a statement that tells us
something about the reality of being, i.e., of all created being.

Before God, even the Manifestation is nothing in itself, and knows
nothing, except the Will of God. This understanding explains much
better the agony of Christ before His crucifixion (Mathew: 36–42)
than the theory of the Trinity.18 On the other hand, in relation to
humankind, the Manifestation holds the immediate destiny of all
created things in His hand.19 This view of God puts God at two
removes from us. Looking at the Manifestation of God—Who is
the destiny of the world—we have to recognize that God is abso-
lutely supreme above all created things and that there is no path of
understanding and knowing that leads from our created existence
to Him. Especially the attempts by “dwellers of the city of self ” (PM
77) cannot ever reach this height and even the faithful and believers
in the message from God have first to confess that they “know not”,
before the understanding of God can become open to them. The
only way to God is in the other direction, from God to humanity
through the Manifestation.
> And if I proclaim Thee by the name of Him Who is the All-Com-
> pelling, I readily discover that He is but a suppliant fallen upon
> the dust, awe-stricken by Thy dreadful might, Thy sovereignty
> and power.
Therefore, Bahá’u’lláh applies the same principle of I-know-not to
every human being, and even to the Divine Messenger, Who, like

us, is but a suppliant, a beggar, in the dust and awe-stricken by God’s
might, sovereignty and power. Again, it is not the knowing, the theol-
ogy, the science of the Divine, or any other sciences that allows access
to God, because we “know not.”

This fact has become clear during the last centuries. The more the
familiar picture of the Father in Heaven faded away in the light
of modern science; the more the concept of God became distant.
Consequently, thinking people lost their faith in such a God. The
Churches did not make this process easier. Their insistence in the
old understanding and their condemnation of science and modern
thought pushed may people into the denial of God 20.

What Bahá’u’lláh asserts in this prayer is the opposite. God, in His
eyes is not becoming smaller and fading away, rather He becomes the
All-Compelling, to Whom a suppliant falls in the dust. Therefore,
the know-not statement here is not a statement about God, but a
statement about the futile human effort to understand God, to grasp
the essence of God, or as one could say, to make a God in the image
of man. It is the issue of idolatry and only the acknowledgment of
God as the total Otherness and unknowable Essence can save man
from at first making his own God and then, in an attempt of being
honest, throwing this graven image out and proclaiming the death of
God. This process is the topic in A. N. Wilson’s book: God’s Funeral,
who describes the history of European atheism and modernism from
Hume to Pius XI, quoting on the last page of his book Tyrrell, who
stated in 1906: “One has to pass through atheism to faith; the old
God must be pulverized and forgotten before the new can reveal
himself to us.”21.

Theological Comment: Theodicy

The question of the justification of the physical and moral evil in the
creation of a good God must be raised here. 22 This question, why evil
exists in the world cannot be solved with a God, who is made in the
image of man in an unchanging world. The belief in the “Father in
Heaven”, which was easily understandable two thousand years ago,
cannot simply be ‘translated’ into our modern world 23. How can we
explain physical and especially moral evil, where the innocent are
tortured, where children are abused, or die of painful diseases?

The first answer is the answer of Job. It is not for us to understand and
judge: God, the All-Compelling, is greater than our imagination, so
how can we understand His plans and the place of evil in the world.
Yet, this answer is not satisfactory for modern reasoning. Another,
more contemporary understanding of this question is to see God as
the God of Evolution.24 Only this view of the world as it really has
evolved will make us somehow understand, what the meaning of evil
in the world might be.

Evil is the price of evolution and the rebellion against this process
played out in the progression of man and the world. The final answer,
given to us, is the answer of the cross, of the suffering of the Messen-
gers send by God, indicating that the progressive revelation of God
does lead to the ever-advancing civilization, but not without pain and
suffering. We need to understand that the shadow of this progress is
the evil, which is part of this developing, progressive world. This is
expressed in another prayer of Bahá'u'lláh:

> Had not every tribulation been made the bearer of Thy wisdom,
> and every ordeal the vehicle of Thy providence, no one would
> have dared oppose us, though the powers of earth and heaven
> were to be leagued against us (PM 14)

> And if I attempt to describe Thee by glorifying the oneness of
> Thy Being, I soon realize that such a conception is but a notion
> which mine own fancy hath woven, and that Thou hast ever
> been immeasurably exalted above the vain imaginations which
> the hearts of men have devised.

Here Bahá’u’lláh tells us that even the highest attributes we can give
God are not reaching into His inaccessible essence. Even if we call
God the One and we praise the Unity of God, we are only talking
about a human concept, we only attempt to attribute to God some-
thing of our world; we again make our own God. As legitimate as this
expression might seem, and as frequently as it is used in the Bahá’í
Writings, seen in this context of human knowing, Bahá’u’lláh calls it
a vain imagination designed in the hearts of man. We cannot know,
we cannot praise, and we cannot call to God because we only put our
imagination to work whenever we pretend to know to whom we speak.

What is required of the true seeker (GWB 264–265) is the aban-
donment of all his knowledge and even his wish to know and letting
himself fall into the hands of God. This is the mystical aspect of
faith and prayer, which, as of yet, we Bahá’ís in America have hardly
touched in our devotions. To accept that even the highest expres-
sion we can make about God is nothing but a vain imagination, is
difficult; it requires a detachment and purity of heart that is not
easily acquired or reached fully in this world. It is with a sense of
loss of our own pride in our thinking and knowing, it is with a sense
of an all-embracing dedication that we can only come near to this
aspiration of finding God. The purity of heart and of life, as Shoghi
Effendi (ADJ 46–55) has stressed, is a precondition of recognizing
this reality. The deepest expression of this truth is expressed in the
mystical writings of Bahá’u’lláh, where he speaks of the lover seeking
the beloved everywhere, even in the dust:

One must judge of search by the standard of the Majnun of Love.

> It is related that one day they came upon Majnun sifting the
> dust, and his tears flowing down. They said, “What doest thou?”
> He said, “I seek for Layli.” They cried, “Alas for thee! Layli is of
> pure spirit, and thou seekest her in the dust!” He said, “I seek
> her everywhere; haply somewhere I shall find her.”

> Yea, although to the wise it be shameful to seek the Lord of
> Lords in the dust, yet this betokeneth intense ardor in searching.
“Whoso seeketh out a thing with zeal shall find it.”

> The true seeker hunteth naught but the object of his quest, and
> the lover hath no desire save union with his beloved. Nor shall the
> seeker reach his goal unless he sacrifice all things (SVFV 6–8).

The glory of Thy might beareth me witness!

Bahá’u’lláh returns to the beginning in this new paragraph of the
prayer. While there, He addresses God by giving Him glory and
praise; he calls on God to witness the fact that we know not and can
never know.

> Whoso claimeth to have known Thee hath, by virtue of such a
> claim, testified to his own ignorance; and whoso believeth him-
> self to have attained unto Thee, all the atoms of the earth would
> attest his powerlessness and proclaim his failure.

There is no claim to know God. What was stated before is reiterated
from a different point of view. Before the inability and helplessness,

the nothingness of the creature in front of God was expressed in the
prayer; now the pride of man who claims to know is declared as total
ignorance. Again, there is no way to attain God, to reach to Him, to
build an intellectual tower of Babel high enough to reach to God.
The whole creation will attest the failure of such an attempt. Any
attempt to do so, to build a society based on atheism will lead to
destruction and terrorism, because of it being contrary to human
nature and contrary to reality. All the atoms of the earth indicate
that even human sciences dealing with the atoms of the world cannot
attain knowledge of God. They can indicate, and this is remarkable,
that the old picture of God as a static, defined and definable entity
is wrong, and cannot be sustained 25. They only can open some new
venues to approach God through His Messengers.

Theological Comment: Hierarchical Religions
When praying to God, when approaching Him, there is never a
human claim; there is never an institution that has a special privilege,
a special power in the sight of God. Bahá’u’lláh’s abolition of priest-
hood and church is clearly implied in this statement. Nobody, not
even the Manifestation can claim to know God. Therefore, nobody
can speak in the name of God, except He, Who speaks the “Word of
God” as revealed to Him.

The meaning of the Revelation and of the Manifestations of God is
expressed in the Bahá’í Writings, but it is not easy to understand it
fully. We might recall that Jesus said (John 14:10): “The words that
I speak to you I do not speak on my own authority, but the Father who
dwells in me does the works.” The messages of all the Manifestations
must be understood this way; they speak not from their human
nature and knowledge, no matter how stainless and perfect their
humanity is. They are only a conduit bringing the message from God;
they are the mirrors of God’s Spirit. They never claim to have power

or authority over God’s message or to be able to reach God through
their human knowledge.26

At this point the prayer changes without starting a new section. The
meaning of this continuity of the prayer might help us to understand
that there is no separation between the “not-knowing of God” and
between the “Mercy of God,” that one requires the other, that it is
the mercy of God giving us permission to pray to God, as long as we
accept the “not-knowing of God.” Bahá’u’lláh does not talk about the
human suppliant. Rather, He talks about God and His mercy, which
allows us to pray, even if we know not how to do it. Yet, it is clear that
this understanding was there from the beginning of the prayer allow-
ing us to pray with Bahá'u'lláh, to speak His words of prayer while
He gives us the confidence to confess our impotence.

> Thou hast, however, by virtue of Thy mercy that hath surpassed
> the kingdoms of earth and heaven, deigned to accept from Thy
> servants the laud and honor they pay to Thine own exalted
> Self, and hast bidden them celebrate Thy glory, that the ensigns
> of Thy guidance may be unfurled in Thy cities and the tokens
> of Thy mercy be spread abroad among Thy nations, and that
> each and all may be enabled to attain unto that which Thou
> hast destined for them by Thy decree, and ordained unto them
> through Thine irrevocable will and purpose.

Bahá’u’lláh, in this long sentence seems to express two thoughts. The
first answers the question of how can we pray if we do not know how,
the other concerns what the gift of prayer means to mankind.

Why and how can we pray, when we do not know God, cannot know
God and cannot praise him? The answer is clear and simple: by vir-
tue of God’s mercy alone can we pray. God’s mercy is additionally

described in its absolute surpassing character. God’s mercy not only
surpasses our understanding, it surpasses the kingdoms of earth and
heaven, i.e. the whole universe, known and unknown. No matter what
science will reveal about heaven and earth, no matter what human
progress and evolution will be in the future, God’s mercy surpasses it.

This is another statement about the unknowable essence of God,
of the absolute impossibility of man, of all men, to know God. Yet,
God’s mercy is above and beyond this impossibility and opens up for
man the possibility to pray to him. God has ordered humankind to
celebrate His glory. God has deigned to accept man’s efforts to laud
and honor His exalted self. The movement comes from God Who
extends to man the possibility of paying honor to His exalted self.
God gives man the power of reason to seek to know Him.

What does that fact mean to humankind? Bahá’u’lláh describes the
consequences in beautiful imagery encompassing the whole world.
Ensigns, colorful banners of joy and guidance will be unfurled in
the cities and the tokens of Thy mercy will be spread abroad among
Thy nations. All men will be able to attain to what God has decreed
for them. This is a prayer anticipating the Kingdom of God, like the
Lord’s Prayer “Thy Kingdom come” (Matthew 6:10).

Theological Comment: Predestination and Freedom
This issue raises the old question of predestination as it was debated
by Christian theologians mainly since the reformation. The freedom
of man, on the one hand, and the foreknowledge, or pre-destining
of man’s fate by God is the issue of this theological debate. How
can God know the individual fate of man and how can man freely
decide his fate given this absolute foreknowledge of God? How can
man be called free to pray, when he is totally dependent on God in
doing so? The solution, which transcends logic, is in the fact that the

freedom of man is a gift of God’s mercy, something that surpasses
our understanding and is therefore included in His foreknowledge.
Actually, the word foreknowledge is erroneous in itself because
there is no “before” or “after” in God; time is part of creation only.
In the final analysis, we do not know how, we only know that God’s
mercy allows it. The old debate about predestination could only arise,
because theologians thought they could know God and could define
His actions according to human logic and according to the time con-
straint to which all creation is subject.

In the Bahá’í Faith this thinking is reversed. Bahá’u’lláh clearly
affirms in the beginning of the prayer that we know not, that we
cannot know and that even the Manifestations of God do not know
God. We cannot attain to the knowledge of God at all, because God
is much more exalted and removed from human speculation than
ever thought before, and this is what it means to laud and honor Him
rather than constructing a God of superstition and imagination. On
the other hand, we believe that He is closely and intimately related to
humankind, through His mercy, and therefore He is called “the most
hidden of the hidden and the most manifest of the manifest.” (PM 248)

The fact that for each and all, the future is destined by God’s decree
and has been ordained through His irrevocable will and purpose
does not mean that man is not free in his decisions, it only means,
that man’s freedom does not limit God because it is a gift of God’s
mercy, which surpasses any limitation by time because time is a fact
of creation and cannot be used when talking about God.

Therefore, considering man’s impotence in the face of the knowledge
of God, Bahá’u’lláh prays in the next section to God to open His
beauty to the seeking faithful and to give access to the bounty of
His mercy.

> Having testified, therefore, unto mine own impotence and the
> impotence of Thy servants, I beseech Thee, by the brightness of
> the light of Thy beauty, not to refuse Thy creatures attainment
> to the shores of Thy most holy ocean.

Here Bahá’u’lláh revisits the statement of man’s impotence and again
clearly includes all of mankind in this statement, himself and all Thy
servants. He continues to ask for God’s mercy, described as God’s
beauty, brightness and light. This is a poetical description of what
could metaphysically be described as the opening of God to man.
Light and beauty are the attributes that open all beings to sight and
delight, to human enjoyment and knowing. If we can see the light and
the beauty of anything, we can enjoy and understand it. This is true
for a work of art, for the beauty of a person, and, for the enjoyment
of life and of the whole world. Even the light of understanding that
science brings is included here.27 The modern quest of science to see,
to know, and to understand this world becomes worship, like every
work performed in the service of humanity. Here, it is applied to God,
Whom we cannot know, but Who gives us the gift of light and beauty
emanating from Him through his Messengers. This light, which is
the origin of all understanding, is also implanted in all beings of this
world, especially in man.

Another image is brought to our attention. The immensity and inex-
haustibility of the Revelation is compared with the ocean, which
confronts the seeker so he prays to be able to attain to its shores.
This leaves the infinite depth and expanse of the ocean for the future
evolution of the human soul through eternity. The exploration of
the shores of this ocean will promote the highest hopes for man-
kind: “All men have been created to carry forward an ever-advancing
civilization.”(GWB 215)

We are here now at the juncture, where the impotence confessed to
above becomes the power to attain to the light and the beauty of God
in our life and in this world. In many prayers, Bahá’u’lláh expresses
the joy and fulfillment that this attainment can give. Paradoxically,
all that was acknowledged before as unattainable now becomes the
most attainable, becomes the essence of the life of the believer. Being
detached from all knowledge leads to the knowing on a deeper level,
which surpasses all other knowledge. God the most hidden becomes
the most manifest.

Consider this passage of another prayer of Bahá’u’lláh:

> I am well aware, O my Lord, that I have been so carried away
> by the clear tokens of Thy loving-kindness, and so completely
> inebriated with the wine of Thine utterance, that whatever I
> behold I readily discover that it maketh Thee known unto me,
> and it remindeth me of Thy signs, and of Thy tokens, and of
> Thy testimonies.

> By Thy glory! Every time I lift up mine eyes unto Thy heaven, I
> call to mind Thy highness and Thy loftiness, and Thine incom-
> parable glory and greatness; and every time I turn my gaze to
> Thine earth, I am made to recognize the evidences of Thy power
> and the tokens of Thy bounty. And when I behold the sea, I find
> that it speaketh to me of Thy majesty, and of the potency of Thy
> might, and of Thy sovereignty and Thy grandeur. And at what-
> ever time I contemplate the mountains, I am led to discover the
> ensigns of Thy victory and the standards of Thine omnipotence.

> I swear by Thy might, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of
> all mankind, and the destinies of the nations! I am so inflamed
> by my love for Thee, and so inebriated with the wine of Thy one-
> ness, that I can hear from the whisper of the winds the sound of
> Thy glorification and praise, and can recognize in the murmur

> of the waters the voice that proclaimeth Thy virtues and Thine
> attributes, and can apprehend from the rustling of the leaves the
> mysteries that have been irrevocably ordained by Thee in Thy
> realm. (PM 271–272)

Progressive Theology

“I-know-not” reveals two aspects. The first has to do with the way

If we look at the diagram below we find the words “ability” and “per-
mission” as the first steps from not knowing to knowing. Certainly
we need to be able to know, but do we need permission to know?
While this is not always true, in important issues we cannot learn
and know something, unless we have the permission to learn it. Even
a teacher will tell her students, you are not ready for knowing this
or that, you have to first get my permission and you will get it when
you are ready. Obviously, we are not to know many things of a pri-
vate nature about another person unless we get the permission of
the person. We are not allowed to know about specific government
secrets, unless we get the permission to learn about it and to know
it. The same is true and even more important when we speak of the
knowledge of God. We do not only have to have God’s permission to
know, we need His help and assistance in order to know. God gives
us the ability and the permission to know. And that is expressed in
this prayer with the statements on the right side below, which are all
quoted from the prayer.

We are asked to pray to God, “that each and all may be enabled to attain
unto that which Thou hast destined for them by Thy decree, and ordained
unto them through Thine irrevocable will and purpose.” (PM 123) God’s
irrevocable will and purpose enables us to do, what we “know-not’ to
do, such as “how to sing Thy praise, how to describe Thy glory, how to call
upon Thy Name.” (PM 123)

The instructions are given and we are drawn “through the Divine sweet-
ness of Thy melodies, towards the throne of Thy glory and the seat of
Thine eternal holiness.” (PM 123) Even the practice of what we learned
is ultimately God’s work: He has to draw us to do what gets us closer
to Him, so everybody can “ascend unto the heights to which he aspireth.”

> The Human Learning             The Divine Learning Process
Process

> 1.   Not knowing                6. “I know not how to…”
> 2.   Ability                   7. “that all may be enabled…
> 3.   Permission                 8. ” by Thy decree and… will…
> 4.   Instruction               9. “Divine sweetness of Thy melodies”
5.   Practice                  10. “Cause him, then, to ascend unto

the heights to which he aspireth…”

This description of the learning process describes the need to
recognize that it is God, in His mercy, Who enables us and gives
us permission to know Him. What is it in the human condition
that enables us to accept this ability and permission given by God?
With this question we approach the field of epistemology, the field
of “how do we know?”

There are at least three ways of knowing, Reason, Intuition and
Vision (Anschauung). The Catholic theologian Romano Guardini
has defined these three ways in his book on the oppositeness of real-
ity, which he calls “Gegensatz.” 28 In this description the three ways of
knowing are described as Rational, Transrational and Superrational.

We can refer these three ways of knowing to the three instruments
used by the mind: the left hemisphere of the brain corresponds to
the rational, the right to the transrational way of knowing i.e. to
intuition. The third way of knowing is best attributed to the heart,
bringing unity and vision into the area of knowing.29 The rational
is the abstract-logical way of thinking. What Guardini calls Tran-
srational is the way of knowing the individual-in-the-concrete, as a
distinct living being. These two ways are in opposition, are a “Gegen-
satz” i.e., they are opposite, yet have something in common, and,
therefore cannot exist without each other.

Whenever we think about an abstract concept, the concrete reality
which it refers to must—at least to some degree—be included in
the same thought. The same is true when we consider the individual.
We always have to include in this thought the abstract and general
meaning. For example, we cannot think about humanness, without
knowing and including in this thought the individual humans we
know; whenever we think about a human being we must include all
that generally belongs to humanness in this thought, as well. Only a
sociopath can treat humans like things, using and abusing them, with-
out considering or caring about the specific human quality of every
human being. This is the condition of the Gegensatz, of the opposite,
which is pervasive in all thinking about living concrete reality.

The third way of knowing is called Superrational (Über-rational). It
includes the first two modes of knowing and exists in the tension of
this Gegensatz and it is described by Guardini in the following way
(translated by this writer):

> To understand the core of the living reality and to approach
> its mystery is not a nebulous imagination, or a mysterious
> experience; it rather takes vision (Anschauung), which is pos-
> sible only in tension, and in respect of the mystery requiring
> discipline and self-control.

Real vision is not a mysterious experience, even though it approaches
the mystery of reality, it includes the tension between reason and
intuition, and this consideration is important, it requires discipline
and self-control. In other words, it is not easy and requires efforts in
the area of ethics.

Bahá’u’lláh mentions the same qualities when talking about his Rev-
elation and how to approach its sublime Vision:

> Were the breezes of Revelation to seize thee, thou wouldst flee
> the world, and turn unto the Kingdom, and wouldst expend all
> thou possessest, that thou mayest draw nigh unto this sublime
> Vision.” (ESW 56)

While Guardini talks about discipline and self-control, Bahá’u’lláh
expands that concept and speaks about additionally expending all
thou possessest as demanded by Jesus:

> The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from
> my youth up: what lack I yet? Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt
> be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and
> thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.

(Matthew 19:20–21)

To understand this demand, which was unacceptable to the young
man at the time of Jesus, must it not be said that following Christ
required total detachment from all possessions and not necessarily
the selling of all possessions? Does not the statement of Bahá’u’lláh
imply the same detachment? This transcends the concept of Guar-
dini that having this vision requires discipline and self-control. In
any case, vision is not easy, and it is, like all real understanding,
based on the permission and ability given by God, as `Abdu’l-Bahá
interpreted this situation:

> But the human spirit, unless assisted by the spirit of faith, does
> not become acquainted with the divine secrets and the heavenly
> realities. (SAQ 208)

Here vision means acquaintance with divine secrets and heavenly
realities, which directs our thoughts to the understanding of the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.

To understand the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, indeed, to understand
any Revelation, this vision is required and it is a gift of God to the per-
son who is detached from the possessions of this world. Additionally,
to acquire this vision and to understand the Revelation is a process,
which never ends, individually and even collectively, until the next
Manifestation brings a renewed vision.

Another image is presented in the next sentence of the prayer:

> Draw them, then, O my God, through the Divine sweetness of
> Thy melodies, towards the throne of Thy glory and the seat of
> Thine eternal holiness.

The divine sweetness of these melodies will draw mankind towards
the throne of God’s glory and the seat of His eternal holiness. Glory
and holiness are described as sweet melodies and we are reminded
here of the nightingales that play such a role as indicators of divine
love to the believer in the Bahá’í writings. This picture of God as
drawing humanity to Him is used by Bahá’u’lláh for all Dispensa-
tions. The melody of the Divine Messenger is like the song of the
nightingale, the beauty of the rose and the scent of the hyacinth. 30

Theological Comment: Progressive Revelation

When we pray these words, we are reminded of the mercy of God,
Who sends His messengers, a Krishna, a Buddha, a Moses, a Zoro-
aster, a Jesus, a Muhammad and finally the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh to us,
so we may pray to be drawn to their message, their eternal World of
God. It gives us the understanding that outside the great religions of
the World, as they are revealed through the Messengers of God, our
understanding of the world is not complete. As religion needs the
assistance of science to avert superstition, so science needs the assis-
tance of religion to prevent materialism and all its dire consequences31.

> Thou art, verily, the Most Powerful, the Supreme Ruler, the
> Great Giver, the Most Exalted, the Ever-Desired.

Here the prayer seems to close with an invocation to God Whom
we “know not,” as we prayed before. We are invited to praise and
acknowledge Him with the words of the Messengers of God. What
are the attributes that are invoked here? First, God is described as
the Most Powerful. We can praise God with that name, as long as
we have first testified to our impotence as servants of God. The Most
Powerful is experienced in our lives when we experience the mercy
of God and the fulfillment of all our aspirations in our love to Him.
This experience prevents us from transferring God’s power into the
human situation except through His mercy.

Power is never to be used against another person; not in the name of
“true” religion against “false” religion, not in the name of orthodoxy

> and church administration and not in inquisition or excommunica-
> tion. No eternal damnation can be invoked merely on the basis of
> human power even in a church or religion. Only if we could know
> God with our power could we claim this divine right. Not even if

we could have attained to Him with our own power and knowledge,
could we claim this right, could we use our power to exercise church
politics and authority. Nothing of that kind is possible after the
revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.

The same applies individually. We can and must praise God as the
Most Powerful. Yet, we cannot derive from this knowledge any power
over other human beings. Neither in gossip, nor in suspicion, neither
in politics nor in personal interaction with others, neither in love, nor
in hate can we assume God’s privilege of power. God gives no one this
power over his or her fellow human being.

Theological Comment: Administrative Power
Any power exerted in politics and civil interactions is of a different
sort: it is not personal, but administrative only and it depends on the
needs of society. It never stretches into the area of consciousness, of
thought or religious belief where independent investigation is the rule.
Civil as well as religious societies must exert power to keep themselves
organized and orderly. Civil society must incarcerate or otherwise
make the criminal unable to disturb the peace. Churches and reli-
gious communities must be able to exclude members who deliberately
try to destroy their community. The power is conditioned and should
not be exerted other than by law and in a proper process. That should
eliminate the individual abusing this power of administration.

One of the greatest differences between the Bahá’í Faith and my
previous experiences as a priest in the Catholic Church was the form
of its administration and how modern man has difficulties with the
present regime in the Church. With the best intentions and in the
sincere belief they are following God’s will, the Popes in the Catholic
Church seem to have created more difficulties for the believers than
all the atheistic philosophers and aberrant theologians together.

This is why many Catholics now abandon the Church or at least
become passive and discouraged. I am not saying that there are no
possible problems of power even in the Bahá’í Faith, but the struc-
ture of the administration and the abolition of priesthood and clergy
will make any aberration temporary and transient. The problem in
the Catholic Church is the fact that this situation is believed to be
unchangeable because it is based on dogma.

The administrative authority of the Bahá’í Faith functions on a dif-
ferent level. It is exerted not by one but by a group of faithful servants
in consultation. It is not given to making new laws and dogmas that
cannot be revised in the future. It is instituted for protection and for
assistance to the individual believer and the Cause. Fortunately, the
Bahá’í administration has not only the guidance of the Spirit and
a functional infallibility, it can, whenever times change, revise its
decisions and provide new guidance in the light of new consultation.

God, the Supreme Ruler, is another title that has to be seen in that
light. Nobody on this earth is a ruler in his own right; there is no
ruler, who rules as the Son of Heaven, as the Chinese emperors used
to be called; there is no ruler in the name of God, as absolute kings
and emperors in Europe used to claim. There is no power in the
name of the leader of a race or class either. The time of dictators and
autocratic rulers is over, even of rulers imposing their power on the
faithful of a specific religion.32

The Great Giver, the Most Exalted, the Ever-Desired

These three attributes express the mercy of God and man’s need for
this mercy. Since we know not and are helpless without the gift from
God, we praise him as the Great Giver. We exalt Him beyond all

limits and declare him as the desire of the whole creation. All religions
of God have expressed this need in their prayers and adorations.

While most human prayers are basically a request to God for his
assistance in this world, this prayer only now turns to ask God a favor.

> Grant, then, O my God, that Thy servant who hath turned
> towards Thee, hath fixed his gaze upon Thee, and clung to the
> cord of Thy mercifulness and favor, may be enabled to partake
> of the living waters of Thy mercy and grace.

Again, the praying believers are described in their relation to God.
They have turned towards Him and have fixed their gaze upon him,
clinging to the cord of God’s mercy and favor. This movement towards
God is the precondition of any prayer. Only when we assume this
attitude, are we allowed to ask God for a favor. Here is no mention
of knowledge and theology, no attempt to try to attain closeness and
understanding of God’s ways and plans. The description is that of
men or women who are servants and who turn to their master with no
questions and no demands, except for asking God’s mercy.

It is impossible here to elaborate on this openness to God, which
has been required in all dispensations of God. For example, Jesus
required the rich man to leave everything behind and follow him
(Luke 18. 22–23). In the description of the true seeker Bahá’u’lláh
has laid out the qualifications to participate in God’s favors.

The first thing we are taught to ask is for the ability to partake of the

> living waters of Thy mercy and grace. What are those living waters
> and how does Bahá’u’lláh use this imagery in His writings? The
> following is a selection of passages in which the diverse meanings of
“living waters” is presented. There are many more quotes than could

be referenced here, but these give an idea of the widespread use of
this phrase.

> Living waters of Thy mercy and grace (PM 124)
> Living waters of Thy pardon (ESW 6)
> Living waters of uprightness and understanding (KA 139)
> Living waters of immortality (ESW 38)
> Living waters of God’s counsels (ESW 59)
> Living waters of acknowledgment (ESW 161)
> Living waters of faith (ESW 169)
> Living waters of friendliness and charity (GWB 7)
> Living waters of truth (PM 197)

`Abdu´l-Bahá describes the “living waters ofthe teachings of God” as the

> only means to bring tranquility and peace to the whole world.33 These
> are the gifts of the revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. The fruit of His teaching
> and the bounty is promised to every believer. A meditation on these
> gifts alone could last a lifetime and is the basis of every prayer to God,
> the Great Giver.

There is one more surprise in this prayer—it is the reference to the
highest aspiration of the one, who contemplates this prayer and the
fulfillment of this aspiration.

> Cause him from that which Thou dost possess, then, to ascend
> unto the heights to which he aspireth, and withhold him not
> from that which Thou dost possess.

Here we are encouraged to ask God to cause us to ascend unto the
heights to which we aspire. How can we ask for more? How could

we ask for anything better? What else is there to ask for, except ask-
ing for the heights of our aspiration? Therefore, we ask that God not
withhold what He possesses. Obviously, this must be the height of
our aspiration, or it certainly should be.

We need to look back at our personal aspiration and wishes and the
gifts we usually ask in our prayers to God. While it is stated that it
is acceptable to formulate your own prayers, this need to direct our
aspiration towards God, should make us careful. The conclusion is
to rarely pray with one’s own words, and always use the words of the
Manifestations. That way, one at least is sure that the words are right,
and all what has to be done, and this is not easy, is to conform to our
heart’s desire, which should be the Revelation Bahá’u’lláh has given us.

As St. Paul said (1 Corinthians 13:11): “When I was a child, I spoke as
a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a
man, I put away childish things. For now we see in a mirror, but then face
to face.” We can no longer think as children especially about God, we
can no longer speak in our prayer like children; we need to see God in
a more mature fashion because humankind has reached the stage of
maturity, as Bahá’u’lláh stated:

> No sooner had mankind attained the stage of maturity, than
> the Word revealed to men’s eyes the latent energies with which
> it had been endowed—energies which manifested themselves in
> the plenitude of their glory when the Ancient Beauty appeared,
> in the year sixty, in the person of `Alí-Muḥammad, the Báb.

(GWB 77)

Alternatively, `Abdu´l-Bahá has interpreted the same situation of
humankind, which has matured during the last two thousand years
of Christianity and Islam:

> The Cause of Bahá’u’lláh is the same as the Cause of Christ. It
> is the same Temple and the same Foundation. Both of these are
> spiritual springtimes and seasons of the soul-refreshing awak-
> ening and the cause of the renovation of the life of mankind.
> The spring of this year is the same as the spring of last year. The
> origins and ends are the same. The sun of today is the sun of
> yesterday. In the coming of Christ, the divine teachings were
> given in accordance with the infancy of the human race. The
> teachings of Bahá’u’lláh have the same basic principles, but
> are according to the stage of the maturity of the world and the
> requirements of this illumined age. (BWF 400)

The maturity of mankind, the new revelation of God, the global tests
and upheavals of the last generations—all of these are included in
the not knowing and yet knowing of God Who is “the most hidden of
the hidden and the most manifest of the manifest.” Do we not all have
to go through this experience of loss of old securities and concepts,
of traditional rituals and customs, of ingrained understandings and
misunderstandings? The Dawn of the new revelation tests us to see
if we have this measure of maturity. It is the quest of a new humanity
in the Kingdom of God.

This promised development of humankind is a slow, spiritual process;
it works its way from person to person and is not a mass movement
which can be covered by the media, measured by government statis-
tics or proclaimed by election outcomes. Yet, its “latent energies” are
transforming the world while we speak and its Divine fecundity can
be observed by anybody who will look and has the eyes to see. As
Bahá’u’lláh has stated at the beginning of His mission: “The universe
is pregnant with these manifold bounties, awaiting the hour when the
effects of Its unseen gifts will be made manifest in this world. (KI 60–61)

This hour of God has come. We can see the influence of the Faith
in the world; we can teach it and live it and we need to be alert to

all the signs and events that tell us about it. This appears to be what
Shoghi Effendi intended to say, when fifty years ago a letter writ-
ten on his behalf stated, “The world has—at least the thinking world—
caught up by now with all the great and universal principles enunciated
by Baha’u’llah over 70 years ago, and so of course it does not sound ‘new’
to them. However, we know that the deeper teachings, the capacity of His
projected World Order to re-create society, are new and dynamic. It is
these we must learn to present intelligently and enticingly to such men!”34

It might well be that even the facts of atheism and agnosticism, which
influence so many of our contemporaries are not merely a negative
and deplorable development of history. These historical developments
have certainly caused great pain and destructiveness to humankind,
yet, were also caused by the distortion of religion, at least to some
degree. `Abdu´l-Bahá clearly states: “If religion becomes a cause of dis-
like, hatred and division, it were better to be without it, and to withdraw
from such a religion would be a truly religious act.” (PT 130) Therefore,
we can join Bahá’u’lláh in this prayer and admit that we know not
and thereby learn from him how to pray in a world of unbelievers.
We can do this because we know this world is getting ready for the
Kingdom of God, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary.

The prayer closes with a final Praise to God;

Thou art, verily, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Bountiful.

Again, it is affirmed here that God is verily the Ever-Forgiving. The
errors and sinfulness of humankind can only find forgiveness from
God. We need to pray not only for forgiveness of our transgressions
but also for the forgiveness of the transgressions of this century with
the knowledge that God is the Ever-Forgiving. That must be our
approach to the victims and perpetrators alike, to the people who

caused the terror and who suffered from it. They—and we—need
the forgiveness of God.

God is the Most Bountiful who gives freely and makes us free.

Theological Comment: God’s Grace
Let’s consider the last attribute, the Most Bountiful. Not knowing
the original meaning of this word as written by Bahá’u’lláh, we have
to follow the translation, which fortunately is from Shoghi Effendi’s
pen. We know that he used an English Dictionary extensively in his
translations to find the fitting words. So it seems to be legitimate to
look up the word bountiful in the dictionary35 where the following
definitions are given: “1. Full of bounty, liberal in bestowing gifts and
favors; gracious; 2. Abundant, Plentiful.”

This Divine grace here certainly includes all the Gifts we have
described above. Especially the gift of the living waters is meant here,
which `Abdu’l-Bahá calls the “living waters of the teachings of God.”
This includes the supreme and unique gift of freedom to humankind
as well.

Conclusion
With this understanding, I read the last sentence of praise in two
complimentary ways. First, God gives freely and graciously, and what
is more, He gives me the gift of freedom to accept His mercy and to
sing His praise. Knowing that such freedom includes the possibility
to refuse to obey God or even work against Him, we learn as well,
that even opposition to God’s will does not limit the providence and
wisdom of God, so that “all abide by His bidding.” (SWB 15) When
it was stated in the beginning, that “I know not how to sing Thy praise,

how to describe Thy glory, how to call upon Thy Name”, and when we
accept the truth of this statement, we now can freely accept the gift
of God to know Him and to love Him and to give praise to Him,
because God is the Ever-Forgiving and Most Bountiful, the Most Giv-
ing, giving freedom and choice, giving humankind independence and
self, yet giving the ability to freely choose God, to love Him, and to
accept the infinite bounty of God.

In another prayer Bahá’u’lláh describes this situation, with empathic
18   understanding:

> He Who was Thy Spirit (Jesus), O my God, withdrew all alone in the darkness
> of the night preceding His last day on earth, and falling on His face to the ground
> besought Thee saying: “If it be Thy will, O my Lord, my Well-Beloved, let this cup,

> uttered, and can feel the glow of the fire that had inflamed His soul in its longing to
> behold Thy face and in its yearning after the Day-Spring of the light of Thy oneness,
> and the Dawning-Place of Thy transcendent unity. (PM 192–193).

This understanding of the Manifestation not only being the cause of creation,
19    but also the sustaining power behind the world, could be understood within the

> the other from the Christian revelation as understood in a new way by
> Teilhard, is worth further exploration following the statement of `Abdu´l-Bahá:
“Furthermore, religion must conform to reason and be in accord with the conclusions

The doctrine about the justification of God in the face of physical and moral evil
22    is called theodicy.

Modern man cannot believe in a good God who creates a world that was good
23    and then became bad through the original sin of the first man Adam. This in

> turn required the salvation of the world through a divine sacrifice. As a matter
> of fact Teilhard, a Jesuit, had expressed this impossibility in one of his early

> theology to studying paleontology in China. (See Pierre Teilhard de Chardin,
> Christianity and Evolution. San Diego, New York, London: Harcourt Brace &
> Company, 1969, note on page 55).

Teilhard de Chardin has addressed this problem in the book The Phenomenon
24    of Man. New York: Harper & Row, 1975, pages 311–313) and has attempted to

> see this issue in a much wider perspective. His thoughts are surprisingly close
> to those of `Abdu´l-Bahá, who describes sin as falling back into the animal

> God. Teilhard sees sin in a similar context of man evolving in a spiritual pro-
> gression and sin and evil as a problem, or a fall from progressive development
> in the direction to “humanization” and “spiritualization” of the world. This
> seeming parallel certainly needs further illumination.

The concept of a God of Evolution, coined by Teilhard de Chardin is such an
25   attempt of the scientific understanding of the world and implies as well that the

One way to try to understand it is the following thought. Each progressive
26   Revelation opens the ability of man to know and love God, they even illuminate

> man to see and find God in the nature of all created things and in men’s own
> nature. The Bahá’í writings in numerous places speak about the openness of the
> creation to the knowledge of God, but that knowledge originates in a movement
> from God to the world, which seems to be the truth behind the notion of

The dedication of scientists to the service of humanity is described as worship
27   by `Abdu´l-Bahá: “In the Bahá’í Cause arts, sciences and all crafts are (counted as)

> worship. The man who makes a piece of notepaper to the best of his ability, conscien-
> tiously, concentrating all his forces on perfecting it, is giving praise to God. Briefly,

To quote only one passage of (`Abdu’l-Bahá: “Religion and science are the two
31   wings upon which man’s intelligence can soar into the heights, with which the

It is interesting what Bahá’u’lláh wrote to Pope Pius IX, just around the time
32   the Pope defined his own infallibility at the Vatican I council. If seen in the light

> of God’s supreme power and of men’s inability to know and to attain this power
> of God, it certainly limits the functions of the Pope and every future religious
> leader. Bahá’u’lláh in his message praises the Pope with these words: “You, in
> truth, are one of the sons of heaven in his name.” And yet he directs him to “Aban-
> don thy kingdom unto the kings, and emerge from thy habitation, with thy face set
> towards the Kingdom, and, detached from the world, then speak forth the praises of
> thy Lord betwixt earth and heaven. Thus hath bidden thee He Who is the Possessor
> of Names, on the part of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Knowing.” ( PB 85).

“Note thou: could these fevers in the world of the mind, these fires of war and hate, of
