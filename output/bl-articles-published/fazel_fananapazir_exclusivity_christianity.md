A Baha'i Approach to the Claim of Exclusivity
and Uniqueness in Christianity

Seena Fazel and Khazeh Fananapazir
Abstract
This article examines the nature of the claims of exclusivity in Christianity.
Differing interpretations of certain scriptural passages have led to conflicts
within the church and also between Christianity and other faiths. A Bahd' i
approach is offered to reconcile these conflicts. The language of the Gospels is
examined using insights gained from the Baha'i writings and from
contemporary Christian thinking. This perspeetive in the context of progressive
revelation provides a rational framework on which similar issues in other
religions can be approached.

> and Shiites. (KUng, Christianiry 442)

One need only add the Arab-Israeli conflict and the fighting in Lebanon to show
that the litany of crimes still perpetrated in the name of religion is bewildering.
And it may be getting worse. A recent editorial of The Economist reviewing the
revival of Islamic fundamemalism ends with the forecast: "Relax a bit about
Iran. Brace yourself for the ne.x t explosion" ("Still Islam" 16). While it is not
fair to blame religion for all these political conflicts or to reduce these scruggles
to religious ones, it is clear that religions have contributed significantly to recent
strife. Hence, it is not surprising that Kung concludes his 1985 book by stating
that " there will be no peace among the peoples of this world without peace
among the world religions" (Christianity 443).

For Christianity, it wo uld appear that the erroneous inte rpre tations o f
scripture, particularly those leading to the dogmas of exclusivity, have played
an import.ant role. Historically, issues in the debate of exclusivity within the
early Christian Church became "not so much the cause of conflict but its most
convenient and hallowed battlefield" (Johnson, History 92). The dogma of the
uniqueness and finality of Christianity has not only been a source of conflict
and p e rsecuti o n within the Church but has also been used to justify
triumphalism and crusades. Three particular examples are wonhy of mention.

First, there is a connection between the Christian sense of superiority with its
corollary of the inferiority and backwardness of the Judaism it "superseded,"
and the consequent almost subconscious anti-Semitism of the Christian world,
continuing into the twentieth century. Christianity regarded Judaism not only as
incomplete in failing to be fulfilled by God's final revelation but also as
responsible for having deliberately rejected and killed ChrisL As the feminist
scholar Rosemary Rue the r writes, "Thus Jews could be seen as having an
especially demonic status as those who should have been able to recognize
Christ o n the basis of their spiritual predictions of the Messiah, and yet chose to
reject and kill him. They are quasi-apostates and C hrist-killers, not merely
ignorant believers" (Dialogue 141).

A second consequence of the Christian sense of superiority was the European
colonization and consequent exploitation of what we now call the Third World."
The basic incentive was economic, but "the moral validation of the imperialist
enterprise rested upo n the conviction that it was a great civilising and uplifting
mission, one o f whose tasks was to draw the unfonunate heathen up inio the
higher, indeed highest, religion of Christianity" (Hick, Non-Absoluteness 19).

Finally, such claims of exclusivity are frequently at the root of a Christian's
difficulty in investigating and respecting other religions. Indeed many of the books
and pamphlets attacking Baha'i thought repeatedly revert to exclusivist doctrines.
For instance, o ne such work states, "According to the Bible, God's revelation
throug h Jesus is not subject to replacement by any newer, higher, or more
complete revelation ... Lordship is something Jesus does not share" (Boykin,
Bah.a' ( 23, 30). Another such work starts a chapter with the heading, "Jesus Christ
is the only Saviour for all eternity" (Beckwith, BaM' { 26). A third concludes by

A Baha' £Approach to the Claim of Exclusivity                            17

asking: "As a Baha'i have you read John's Gospel and evaJuaLcd Lhe claims of
Christ to be the 'way, Lhe crulh, and Lhe life .. . '?" (McConnick, History 20).

It is important to bear in mind that there are differ ing. and frequently
contradictory, attitudes towards the dogma· of exclusivity among the various
schools of Christian thought. The Christian groups Lhat are most clearly
exclusivist have been labelled evangelicals and fundamentalists.• However,
many Christians, including Catholics, believe I.hat their religion is not the only
way to salvation.2

In attempting to address the issue of religious conflict, an important
prerequisite is a dispassionate examination of those scriptural passages that
have been used in support of the two main forms of exclusivist assertion,
namely that the founder of their Faith is unique and eternally supre me and that
each Faith provides its followers with the sole means of salvation. In this article,
an approach from a Baha'i perspective is offered to the rcsolulion of conflicts
arising from such claims in Christianity. It is our submission that Lhe Baha'i
approach outlines models for resolving similarly divergent claims.

Texts and Interpretations
Traditional Christian doctrine presenLs Lwo sels of scriptural quoLalions in
support of its claims. First, there are those quotations dealing with the idea that
Jesus Christ is the unique incarnation of God:

> ... for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son. (Jn 3: 16)
> The Word was God ... and the Word was made flesh. (Jn l :l,14)
> Jesus Himself stated, "I and my F:ither :ire One. (Jn 10:30)
> He that seeth me seeth him that sent me. (Jn 12:45)
> I :irn the way, the truth. and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. (Jn 14:6)

Equally. many biblical passages support the second category of exclusivist
assertions, namely that Jesus Christ provides the exclusive route to salvation
and that therefore salvation is an exclusively Christian preserve. The latter set of
quotations are categorized by Christian doctrine as being soteriological, as
distinct from the ontological passages, which confer uniqueness to the person of
Jesus ChrisL

> For there is none other name under heaven given :irnong men, whereby we must be
> saved. (Acts 4: 12)
> He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, he that bclieveth not shall be
> damned. (Mk 16:16)

> 1. For an explanation of these terms, see Barren, World Christian Encyclopedia 71.

2. See, for instance, Second V:itican Council's (1965) Declaration on the
Re/aJion.ship of the Church to Non·Christian Religions. However, some commentators
believe that even the ecumenical attitude to other religions is shon lived. For instance. a
1989 article states, '"The new Pope (John Paul 0) was not interested in accommodation
with the world, but in reaffirming the Church's Catholic identity on the way to
reconquering it" (The Economist, "Lonely" 20).

18                THE JOURNAL OF BAHA'i STIJDIES                 3.2.1990

> For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ
> Jesus. (1 Tm 2:5)

Christian exclusivity was later summarized in the Lraditional Roman Catholic
doctrine, which stated that outside the Church there is no salvation, and in its
Protestant missionary equivalent, that outside Christianity there is no salvation.
Further, one of the Articles of Faith of the Church of England states, "For holy
Scripture doth set out unto us only the Name of Jesus Christ, whereby men must
be saved" (Book of Common Prayer 619). The Evangelical Alliance puts it
more bluntly, "Those who receive Christ are saved; those who reject him are
lost" (Christianity 23).                             ·

Our assertion is that these beliefs are not consistent with a reasonable
Christian faith. Is it credible that the loving God and Father of aJI people, "the
true light which lighteth every man" (Jn 1:9), who desires "all men to be saved"
(1 Tm 2:4), who "love(s) them that love me" (Prv 8: 17), who "accepted" those
who "worketh righteousness" (Acts 10:35), has decreed that only those born
within one particular thread of human history shall be saved? The manifest
injustice of an exclusive access to salvation has even been apparent to the church
for some time. An example of this conceptual problem is evident in the statement
from the Chicago Congress on World Mission, intended as an incitement to
missionary activity, as far back as 1960: "Since the War (World War IT) more
than one billion souls have passed into eternity and more than half of these went
to the torment of hell fire without even hearing of Jesus Christ, who he was, or
why he died on the cross of Calvary" (quoted in Hick, Second 77).

Conversely, the Baha'f approach sLresses the unity of all religions and the
need to eradicate all sources of prejudice. In The Book of Certitude, Baha'u'llah
explains the rank and station of the Manifestation of God. In essence, this
involves the recognition of both a human and a divine nature in each of the
Manifestations. In each of these stations, a different type of language is used by
the Manifestation of God. The utterances of their divine station-the first
station-involve the use of "the anributes of Godhead, Divinity, Supreme
Singleness, and Inmost Essence . . ." (Gleanings 53). This station is also
called the station of "essential unity" (Gleanings 51). Here, all the
Manifestations "abide in the same tabernacle, soar in the same heaven, are
seated upon the same throne, utter the same speech, and proclaim the same
Faith" (quoted in Shoghi Effendi, 'fhe World Order 58). The second station is
characterized by distinction between the Manifestations, " . . . temporal
limitations ... they manifest absolute servitude, uner destitution, and complete
self-effacement" (Gleanings 53-54). Their language in this station, therefore,
reflects this distinction. These two stations are summarized later by Baha'u'Uah:
"Were any of the all-embracing Manifestations of God to declare: 'I am God,'
He, verily, speaketh the truth .... And were they to say, 'We are the Servants of
God', this also is a manifest and indisputable fact" (Gleanings 54).

And since there can be no tie of direct intercourse to bind the one uue God with
His creation. and no resemblance whatever can exist between the transient and the

A Bahd' (Approach to the Claim of Exclusivity                     19

> Eternal, the contingent and the Absolute, He hath ordained th:n in every age and
> dispensation a pure and stainless Soul be made manifest in the kingdoms of earth and
> heaven. Unto this subtle, this mysterious and ethereal Being He hath assigned a
> twofold narure; the physical, pertaining to the world of mauer, and the spiritual,
> which is born of the substance of God Himself. He halh, moreover, conferred upon
> Him a double station. (BaM'u 'll:ih, Gleanings 66)

There is much evidence in the Gospels thaL can be viewed as supporting this
perspective. During an inLerview with a group of Roman Catholic bishops in
Paris in 1913, •Abdu'l-Baha provides an example of this approach when he was
asked , "Who is Jesus ChrisL and whaL was Lhe naLure of His Being?" In
response, 'Abdu'l-Baha said ChrisL "was as is stated in the Gospels, buL we
explain their meanings"3 (Khitalxit 737). This invites us Lo investigate whaL the
scripLures Leach and whaL their. explanations are.

The Gospels can indeed be seen to provide Lwo opposiic aspects Lo Chrisl's
personality: his humaniLy and his divinity. Previously quoLed passages indicate
ChrisL's divinicy. The following verses are expressions of his humaniLy:

> Jesus cried and said, He that believelh on me, bclieveth not on me, but on him who
> sent me. (Jn 12:44)
> And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal
> life? And Jesus said unto him. Why caHest thou me good? none is good, save one,
> that is. God. (Lk 18: 18)
> For I came down from heaven. not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent
> me. (Jn 6:36)
> My Father is greater than I. (Jn 14:28)4
> Jesus, faithful to the One appointing him,5 just as Moses also was. (Heb 3:2)
> But of that day (the Day of Judgment) and that hour knoweth no one, not even the
> angels which are in heaven, neither the Son. but the Father. (Mk 13:32)

The last of these Gospel verses clearly does not equate the knowledge of Jesus
"the Son'' and that of God "the Father." In summary, the Lwo aspects of Christ's
relationship with God are reconciled and may be understood by BaM'u' ll:ih's
explanation of the station of the Manifestation of God. ln a simplified manner, it
is possible to say that this perspective identifies Christ as God, but not God ~s
Christ. Tue-Manifestation is a reflection of God's auributes, and therefore all
humanity can know of God, but the ManifestaLion is noL the incarnation of
God's essence. The late Bishop John Robinson uses the term "expression•'6 in
his explanation of ChrisL's station, "He was the complete expression, the Word
of God. Through him, as through no one else, God spoke and God acted; when
one me t him, one was met and saved and judged by God" (Honest 71). This
insight is reiterated in Professor Dodd's brilliant study of the Fourth Gospel

> Father and the Father in me" (Jn 10:38) "is conceived as a dynamic and not a
.static re lation; it consists in an activity originating with the Father and
manifested in the Son" (Interpretation 194).

In addition, the literal interpretation of exclusive statements has been
> questioned by several Christian thinkers. Their objections have been based on an
> awareness of the type of language used in the Gospels. The first of these has
> been discussed, among others, by John Hick. He observes that the writing of

> commitment. "of spiritual reflection rather than reliable history" (Carpenter,
> Jesus 14). Hick concludes that the treaunem of many Gospel passages as literal
> propositions misrepresents their purpose and meaning. To call Jesus "God,"
> "Son of God," or "God incarnate" is to use "poetic" or "mythological" language
> (Hick, Jesus 175; God 172). He gives this analogy: "That Jesus is my Lord and
> saviour is language like that of the lover for whom Helen is the sweetest girl in
> the world. Logically, there can only be one sweetest girl in the world; but if we
> treat the lover's words literally and infer from them the claim that every girl is
> less sweet than Helen, we shall not be doing justice to the kind of language he is
> using'' (Hick, Second 32). Likewise, if the confession of Jesus as Lord and
> Savior is taken to mean that humankind cannot respond to God except through
> Jesus, "we misuse the language of personal commiunem and tum living religion
> into dogmatic exclusiveness" (llick, Second 32).

Allegorical Language
The second basis of Christian objection to literal interpretation derives from an
understanding of the allegorical language used in the Bible. Jesus used thirty-
nine parables to explain spiritual meaning. Of them, He says, "I speak to them in
parables, because they seeing see not, and hearing hear not, neither do they
understand" (Mt 13: 12-13). Barr interprets the incident of the temptation of
Jesus by the devil in the following way:

> The narratives as we have them in Matthew and Luke are two attempts to express the
> inexpressible in human terms ... the stories arc something like a legend. They arc not
> factual reporting of conversations that acoustically took place. The encounter of Jesus
> with the devil was real, and so the story relates to a real event of some kind: but the
> description which it gives of it is a legendary one, such as to give us a sufficient and
> adequate impression of its meaning. (Escaping 79~0)

The expression of the "inexpressible" to which Barr refers is precisely the
purpose of metaphor. In using metaphor, however, it is necessary to examine the
two components that are being compared and to look for qualities in common.
In this context. the qualities are not physical but spiritual. In saying that He is,
for example, the "bread of life" (Jn 6:48), Jesus is obviously not referring to the
literal interpretation but to the common spiritual qualities that such a metaphor
suggests. That He is essential, vital, abundant, and a source of spiritual
nourishment is clearly a more reasonable interpretation (Hatcher, Purpose 90-91).

A BaM' l Approach to the Claim of Exclusivity                 21

Dodd points out that the synoptic parables should not be confused with the even
richer symbolism of the Fourth Gospel (Interpretation 134). The explicit use of
symbols in this Gospel such as bread of life, living water, the true vine, and the
good shepherd, is different from the narratives and other parables of earlier
Gospels. A parable is a real life story, presenting a situation that the hearers will
recognize. F rom this story they will be able to infer a moral or spiritual
significance. Symbolism, however, presupposes knowledge of the realities for
which the symbols stand and derives its significance from a background of
thought in which these had already served as symbols for religious conceptions.
In this context the Fourth Gospel writer's acquaintance with the Platonic Doctrine
of Ideas is probably relevant This conception of a world of invisible realities of
which the visible world is a copy clearly "had entered into the texture of thought"
(Dodd, Interpretation 139). In this light the use of symbolism in describing the
nature of J esus can be understood. For example, Jesus says "I am a good
shepherd" (Jn 10: 11). "What makes a shepherd a shepherd? The fact that he
realizes in himself the eternal idea of shepherdhood, which is manifested in
Christ" (Interpretation 140).

The relevance of the Platonic influence can be clearly seen in the light of a
passage in Paul's epistle to the Colossians. Christ here is described as the One
"Who is Image of the Invisible God" (Col 1:15). The Greek word used for
image is eikon, the very same word Plato used to describe the reflection of the
sun in the water. "Paul's teaching to the Colossians was that there was not a
mere coincidental resemblance between Jesus Christ and His Father
(homoioma), but they were eternally related One to the Other (eikon). The One
was a reflection of the Other who was real and not merely the figment of
thought or imagination" (Study Bible 1456). This perspective correlates with the
analogy often used in Baha'i writings to explain the relationship of the
Manifestation to God. The analogy is that of a mirror reflecting sunlight As
Sabet. explains, "If we compare Divinity with the sun, the messenger is like a
pure and perfect mirror in which the sun is reflected. Now, the mirror in
referring to the sun might say of itself: 'The sun is in me', or 'I am a reflector of
the sun', or 'I am a fragile mirror'" (Sabet, Heavens 102).

Thus the "veiled and concealed" (Book of Certitude 255) language of
revelation can be understood in light of these hermeneutic insights: "These
things we also speak . . . . they are spiritually discerned" (1 Cor 2:13-14).
Similarly, Jesus' identity with God can be seen as a divine metaphor. Because
Jesus is not physically similar to the Almighty, the Baha'i perspective is that He
is the incarnation of names and attributes rather than an incarnation of the
essence of God.1

Relativity and Religious Truth
The final approach that could be considered is the relativity of religious truth
conveyed by scripture. The fundamental principle enunciated by Baha'u'llah is

7. Baha'{ writings point out that God "can in no wise incarnate His infinite, His
unknowable. His incorruptible and all-embracing Reality in the concrete and limited
frame of a monal being" (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order 112).

22                THE JOURNAL OF BAHA'I STUDIES                     3.2.1990

that " religious truth is not absolule but re lative . . . " (Shoghi Effendi,
Promised Day v); it is relative (as shown by the use of metaphor and parable in
the Gospels) to the kind of literature it is, lO the kind of event being narrated, to
the kind of theological use to which the statement is being put, and to the
theological importance of the realities Lo which the stalement refers. An
important aspect of this principle is lhe relativity of lhe revela tion of the
Manifesiation to the age in which He lived. Both in referring to the pasl and the
future, this principle is propounded in the Bible. Of the past, God "at sundry
times and in divers manners spake in times past unto the fa the rs by the
prophets" {Heb 1: 1). The criterion for belief in Jesus is belief in Moses: " Had ye
believed in Moses, ye would have believed Me" (Jn 5:44). And of the future,
the writer of Acts of the Apostles states that "the times of refreshing shall come
from the presence of the Lord, ... the times of the restilution of all things"
(Acts 3: 19, 21). Accordingly, Jesus stated that "I have yet many things to say
unto yo u, but you cannot bear !hem now" (Jn 16:12), and Paul explains !hat " I
have fed you with milk, and not wilh meat.: for hilherto ye were not able to bear
it. neither yet now are ye able" (1 Cor 3:2). Here the distinction between Jesus
{the individual Manifestation of God for his age) and Lhe Christ (the Word of
God, the divine Logos which "lightcth every man that cometh into lhe world"
[Jn 1:9) and is the "same yesterday, today, and forever" [Heb 13:8)) is critical to
the understanding of the progressiveness of divine revelation.

The assertion of uniqueness is not exclusive lO Christianity; indeed elsewhere
in lhe Bible repeated mention is made of lhe uniqueness of Moses, lhe High
Prophet of Judaism. The Bible teaches that "unco his brother Aaron" {who was a
prophet in his own right), Moses was "instead of God" (Ex 4: 16). He is lhe only
individual in human history "whom lhe Lord knew face to face" (Dt 34: 10), and
with whom the Lord spoke "mouth to mouth" (Nm 12:8). In addition to Moses'
personal uniqueness, the Laws and statules He esiablished were intended to be
"for ever," lO be followed " throughoul their generations" (Ex 27:2 1, 28:43; Lv
6: 18, 6:22, 7:34, 10:9, 10: 15, 16:3 1, 17:7, 18:33, 23:14). The salvation offered
to the peo ple of Israel was to be permanent and abiding. The God of Israe l
announced to them that " beside me there is no saviour" (ls 43: 11) and that " this
salvation shall be forever" (Is 51 :6). If the same lOOls of lileral interpretation
were used for these quotations of the Old Testament lO show Jewish exclusivity,
as have been used for the New Testament to demonsl!ate the absoluteness of
Christianity, Christians would have difliculty in demonstrating the fulfillment
of the Jewish religion in Christianity.8

8. Maimonides demonsLrates Lhis problem in Lhe case of the Laws of Lhe Jewish
religion: "You must not imagine that Lhe Messiah must prove his Mcssianity by signs
and miracles, doing something unexpected, bringing the dead lO life, or similar things,
etc. The principal thing is Lhis: Lhe starutes and precepts of our Torah remain for ever,
and nothing can be added to them nor ought taken from them. If. therefore, a descendan t
of David earnestly studies the law, observes, like David his father, what the Law, both
written and oral. enjoins, causes all Israelites to act similarly, exhorts those who are lax
in the performance of the commandments. and fights the wars of the Lord: he may
possibly be Messiah" (quoted in Friedlander. Jewish 226-27).

A Ba}uj' (Approach to the Claim of Exclusivity               2.3

In conclusion, we have auempled to show Lhat the sublimity and unique
impon.ance of Jesus Christ resides in his station of diviniLy. However, this is no
basis for exclusivity because in their divine stalion all the Manifestations of
God are exponents of one unity. The Baha'i principle of progressive revelation
argues against the attribution of uniqueness Lo any single founder-prophet and
instead accords a unified exclusivity to all the Manifestations of God. The
contribution of this insight to interreligious dialogue may facilitate Lhe process
of reconciling theological differences among the major world religions "in a
great spirit of mutual forbearance that will enable them to work together for the
advancement of human understanding and peace" (Universal House of Justice,
Peoples 13).
