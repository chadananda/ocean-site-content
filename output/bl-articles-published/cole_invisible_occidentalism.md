texts, contains importantinsights. It also, of course, presents only one side of
the equation.

Here we might play turnaboutby inquiringinto three eighteenth-centurydepic-
tions of the West written in Persian by Shi'ite notables. Although our main
concerns are thematic,an attemptwill be made to set them in the context of so-
cial interests. On the face of it, we might expect to find in these texts, written
at a time of unprecedentedEuropeanencroachmenton the Muslim lands, a mir-
ror-image of Orientalism, a systematic critique of Western colonialism and
Westem culture. But do we?

Muslims were, of course, in contact with Europeans throughouttheir history,
especially in the Mediterranean.Nevertheless, the public culture in most Mus-
lim lands little acknowledgedEuropeansor Europeanculturein the early modern
period. The Renaissance,the Copernicanrevolution,the printingrevolution, the
Reformation,and the Enlightenmentall might as weil not have occurred for all
the cognizance most Muslim intellectuals took of them.2 Although the Euro-
pean expansion and the tradingcompanies made an impact upon Muslims right
from the beginning of the Iberiantransoceanicvoyages, relatively few indige-
nous accountsof Westemerssurvivebefore the eighteenthcentury.

In the course of the eighteenthcentury the British emerged as the predominant
Europeanpower in the PersianGulf (succeeding the Portugueseand the Dutch),
and they graduallycrafteda new politicalorder.3In India,of course,they defeated
in turn the army of the Shi'ite-ruled Bengal province in 1757 and the Mughal
forces led by the Shi'ite governorof Awadh(Oudh),Shuja' al-Dawlah, at Baksar
in 1764. Despite the numericalpredominanceof Hindus in the population and
of Sunnis among the Muslims, the post-Mughal era had witnessed the
emergenceof importantIan-linked Shi'ite elites in northemIndia,particularlyin
Bengal and Awadh, though these were graduallydisplaced from power by the
British.4 Although only occasionally do the Shi'ite leanings of these authors

emerge in the accounts under discussion, it does so happen that all the authors
covered adheredto thatbranchof Islam.

The Westerners loomed too large after 1750 for Persophonewriters in Iranand
India to ignore them any longer. Natives of Lucknow, or of Shushtarand Ker-
manshah,began makingextensive Persiannotes on Europeand the Europeansin
the late eighteenth century, several of which were published in manuscriptform
or lithographedearly in the nineteenthcentury. What were the institutionaland
technological contexts for this writing? We know that the advent of moveable-
type printingand the age of Europeanexpansionism,along with the literatureof
travel and description the latterspawned, coincided with one anotherin the late
fifteenth century. Did the rise of printing in the Persophone world in the late
eighteenth century have a similar relationshipwith the literaturedescribing Eu-
rope to Iranians,CentralAsians and Indiansin Persian?

Other social practices are also importanthere. The literate class of Muslim
courtiers, landlords, garrisoncommanders,and clergymen were called locally in
Arabic, Persian and Turkish the a'yan, or notables. In a classic essay Albert
Hourani discovered in their interests and activities the essence of pre-modern
Middle Eastern politics.5 They often held land or engaged in court service or
both. The three authorsdiscussed below all derived from this class.

In this period the notables became divided between those who opposed the ex-
pansion of Europeanpower in the Muslim world and those willing to ally them-
selves or collaboratewith the foreigners.6 Sometimes the careerof a leader, such
as Shuja' al-Dawlah of Awadh (r. 1754-1775), demonstratedboth leanings, with
early opposition to the foreigners followed by a collaborationist phase in the
wake of a decisive defeat at Britishhands. The adventof new transportationand
communication technologies brought these elites into closer contact with one
anotherand also established a context for new sorts of culturalproductionin the
Indo-Iranianculturearea.

late 1760s) of their nawab. In a bizarrevictory for Orientalism,notables often
received patronagefrom Europeanconsuls or agents to write Persian chronicles
about the local political events of the day, from a point of view that flatteredthe
British.

Iranians,who retainedat least a nominalindependence,were often more ambiva-
lent about the foreigners, but those most likely to know anything serious about
Great Britain were immigrantsto India or students studying in London, and so
they gravitatedtowardthe circle of collaboratingelites or subsidiaryallies. Un-
der much of the Persian writing about Europe lay the question of what benefit
the notable class might derive from the new encounterwith the West. In the ab-
sence of notions like nation-state or citizenship in Asia, exclusive national or
even communal loyalty had no resonance. Many Iranians,after all, had emi-
grated to join the Mughalarmy and bureaucracy. In India Muslim notables fre-
quently served in the courts of Hindu potentates,and Shi'ite courtiersroutinely
served Sunni rulers. In keeping with this traditionof cosmopolitanism, Shi'ites
felt that there was nothing wrong with taking service in the British East India
Company, so long as they did nothingcontradictoryto their religious principles.

Although the Persian texts underconsiderationpurportto discuss "Europeans"
(farang), the authors mostly concentrateon high culture and high politics-in
short, on the Europeanequivalent of the notable class. Here we will focus on
their views of the British, discussing three major positive themes in these por-
trayals: egalitarianismand parliamentarygovernment, science and technology,
and gender. Next we will turnto a considerationof their criticisms of European
society.

The value of these texts lies in their being some of the first widely-available ac-
counts of Europe to reach literatePersian speakers early in the nineteenth cen-
tury, much before "Westernization"began in these societies in any meaningful
sense. The texts have their flaws and idiosyncrasies, but none of these detracts
from their value for our immediate purpose. The authors appear to have de-
pended on interviews with Persian-speakingEuropeans,ratherthan upon printed
texts, for their information. This caused them sometimes to garble facts and de-
tails (one writer confidently asserts that British monarchs are permitted legal
polygamy, and that the hair of all Native Americans is white).7 The question
arises, moreover,of to whatextent the picturethey derivedof Europeansreflected
the self-image of their informants;but this problemexists in all "ethnography."

'Abdul-LatifKhanof Shushtarin southwesternIran,born in 1760, emigrated to
Hyderabadaround1790 and duringthatdecade took the notes on which he based
his Tuhfat al-'alam (Gift to the World), written in 1800-1801. The book was
printedin Hyderabadin 1805. Anotherwriter,Mirza Abu Talib Khan, was bom
in 1752 in Lucknow, in the post-Mughal, Shi'ite-ruled state of Awadh. He

eighteenth-centuryIran. After a mixed career as a local revenue officer, he set
out for England from Calcuttain 1799. On his returnto Bengal he wrote up his
observations in 1803-1805 as The Travels of Talib in the Lands of the
Franks. The Persian text was published in Calcuttain 1812, after a two-volume
English translationhad already appearedin London in 1810.8 Aqa Ahmad Bih-
bahani, an Iranianclergyman brought up in Kermanshah,escaped his debts by
emigrating to India, where he ultimately settled as a leader of Friday prayers in
British-ruled Patna, writing his travelogue, The World-Revealing Mirror,
around 1810; he had access, apparently,to a manuscriptof Abu Talib Khan's
work.9 Of these three authors only one, Abu Talib, had a direct experience of
late-eighteenth-centuryBritain, but all three had ample opportunityto associate
with Britishersand derive informationfrom them. We are concerned with these

These authors saw Great Britain as a more egalitarian,less hierarchicalsociety
than Muslim Iranor South Asia, though Shushtaristresses this aspect of Britain
rathermore than does Abu Talib, who moved in aristocraticcircles and who had
an opportunityto observe the practiceas well as the theoryof British parliamen-
tarianism. Shushtariobserves: "Anotherof the laws of these people is that no
one may dominateanother. If the king or nobles make unreasonabledemandson
their subordinates, these latter may lodge a complaint in the courts."'0 Abu
Talib concurs that masterscould not directlypunish their servants,but ratherhad
to take them before a magistrate,and is awed thateven the heir apparentcould be
sued by an ordinaryperson."I He thinks that this equality before the law made
the ordinaryfolk impudent,and recountsthe story of how a lord, when he sullied
his gloves on a newly-painted, unmarkeddoor, upbraided the painter-who
saucily asked whether the nobleman had eyes in his head or not. He continues,
"Their lawmakers, however, are of the opinion that this freedom tends to make

Persian, and it raises questions to be consideredbelow. He concentrateson the
political system and Its principles, giving an idealized and somewhat collapsed
account of the decline of absolutismInEngland:

According to him the English system based itself on threepillars-the king, the
aristocracy,and the subjects-and no greataffaircould be undertakenwithoutthe
consentof all threeestates. He thendescribeshow the Britishbuilta greatedi-

Although Abu Talib also saw the British system as a union of the monarchical,
aristocratic,and democratic forms of government,and approvedof the mixture,
he neglected to give any such detailed pictureof how MPs were elected, instead
stressing the king's power to approve laws, to command the army, to pardon
criminals and to dismiss cabinets. He does observe that, in appointingjudges
for life, the king gives up control over the judiciary. Furthermore,he depicts
Parliament'spowers as extendingprimarilyover taxes and public contractorsand
agents, and acting as a check on the power of cabinet ministers.15

The third writer, Aqa Ahmad Bihbahani,who came from a clerical background,
puts a unique twist on his descriptionof the British form of government. In re-
sponse to the wars of succession, he says, the philosophersand the learnedmade
the affairs of state dependenton the consent of threeentities: the king, the minis-
ters, and the membersof Parliament,which he describes as an assemblage of no-
bles (umara') who are well-wishers of the king and his subjects. So he appears
to have known only of the House of Lords and not of Commons. The king, he
maintained, was chosen by the nobles; and he must be learned, a sort of muj-
tahid or accomplished jurist.'6 Interestingly enough, George III was not the
philosopher-king of Muslim neo-Platonism as described in its medieval litera-
ture, but something of a precursorto Ayatollah Khomeini-an expert in Chris-
tian legal reasoning elevated to rulershipbecause of his learning. In the devel-
opment of Shi'ite thought in the eighteenth century, the victorious Usuli school
asserted that all laymen must emulate and obey the most learnedof the Muslim
jurists, or mujtahids. The laity was to choose the most learned on its own, so
that in Iran and Iraqtwo or three top mujtahids became "exemplars"(marja'-i
taqlid) for very large numbersof believers. Theoretically,Usulism admittedthe
possibility of a single most learnedjurist at the top of the hierarchy,but the in-
formal and fluid natureof clerical charisma in fact militated against the emer-

> gence of a single Shi'ite "pope."17 In this period monarchy was accepted as
> natural to Islam, and no one advocated that the Shi'ite mujtahid actually rule.

Muslim rulers, from the Ottomans in Istanbul to Muhammad 'Ali in Cairo,
took a dim view of the Frenchrevolutionand its principles;nor could the Indian
nawabs be any less sensitive to the questioning, implicit in parliamentary
democracy, of the basis of their authority. Yet our authorsfelt free to depict the
British system quite openly, even though Shushtaricontinued to reside off and
on in Hyderabadand Abu Talib could well have returnedto Lucknow. Perhaps
the fact that this parliamentarysystem operated in a foreign, exotic land made
writing about it seem less seditious than if the writershad been proposing it for
India and Iran. Bihbahani, living under British protection in Patna, was at
greaterliberty to say what he pleased, but his clericalist Shi'ite ideology appar-
ently made it difficult for him to grasp some of the egalitarian implications of
parliamentarygovernance. As noted, Abu Talib's stress on the remainingpower
of the king may have derived, in part, not only from circumspection but also
from the elitist social circles in which he moved while in London. Shushtari's
account clearly exaggeratesBritishdemocracyas practicedin the late eighteenth
century, depicting the king as no more than a figurehead who was ultimately
pensioned off. His informantscould very well have been Whig East India Com-
pany officials who strongly believed in the achievements of the Glorious Revo-
lution.

Shushtarisees the Westerners'egalitarian,rationalizedgovernmentalsystem as a
productof the same sort of ratiocinationthat led to their mechanical sophistica-
tion. "After organizing the state and laws," he writes, "the philosophers then
turned their attention to investigating the reality of things on sea and land."'9
After giving an accountof the magneticcompass and of the voyages of Christo-
pher Columbus,he (bizarrelyenough) depicts the exploreras an Arabic-speaking
native of the Arabianpeninsula. Shushtariis fascinatedby clocks, orreries,tele-
scopes, and other technical achievementsof the Europeans. Perceiving that the
mechanizationof life had far-reachingeffects, the authordepicted all Europeans
as subject to a peculiar work-time discipline, such that they carried clocks on
their persons and "organize all their activities-writing, riding, eating, sleep-
ing-and all time by means of clocks."20 Likewise, they showed inventiveness
in weaponry and ordered their military rationally, unlike Asian commanders
whose arnies often resembleddisorganizedcrowds. So long as the British, he
writes, "maintaintheir formations,which they call 'lines,' they are like an im-
movable volcano spewing artilleryand rifle fire like unrelentinghail on the en-
emy, and they are seldom defeated."2' Thus he displays an awarenessof not just
the mechanical inventiveness of the Europeans but of the synergy between
technologyand rationalizedsocial organization.

Shushtarilists three reasons for this Western excellence in all fields: first, their
kings and rulers"striveto see thateach personreceives an educationappropriate
to his station";second, every individual works full-time in his own specializa-
tion, and performsno other work-"They say that life is short,and if one learns

to excel in one thing during one's seventy years, that is enough"; third, new
ideas are protectedby patent. If artisansand craftsmeninvented something, the
patent was purchasedby the crown and its inventors taught it to others. No in-
vention, he says, could be manufactureduntil its inventor was protected by a
patent. He believed that the gulf which existed in Iran between theoretical or
philosophical knowledge and practicalmechanics had been bridgedin the West,
so that even humble blacksmiths knew how to use levers and pulleys.22 Bih-
bahani agrees: "The great philosophersof the West are exceedingly abundant,to
the extent that even the characterof the common people is philosophicaland in-
clined to investigatemathematicsand nature."23

Abu Talib sees the people of Englandas highly individualistic,speculating that
the climate and soil are responsible not only for a vast variety of crops grown,
but also for "such a difference in the tempersand mannersof its inhabitantsthat
no two of them appearto think or act alike."24 He lauds the mechanical inven-
tiveness of the West, including the printingpress, whereby any book "may be
circulated among the people in a very short time, and by it the works of cele-
bratedauthors are handed down to posterity, free from the errorsand imperfec-
tions of a manuscript."25Commentingon British shipbuildingtechnology, the
casting of cannon, and the use of the steam engine in manufacturing,he at-
tributes to this mechanizationof industrya sharpdrop in commodity prices and
an improvement in the lot of the common people. He thinks the British more
persevering in their determinationto set up machineryfor any extensive works
than, say, the French.26

The achievements of Westernscience and technology had not only made the Eu-
ropeans formidable, they had also refigured cosmology. Shushtaridiscovered
from his encounters with the British in Hyderabadand Bombay the Copernican
model of the solar system. Muslims had remainedoblivious to the Copernican
revolution and continued to adhere to Ptolemaic astronomy into the nineteenth
century. Moreover, as in sixteenth-centuryEurope, the Ptolemaic system had
been adopted into theology, and the pious saw heliocentrismas an affront to Is-
lamic cosmology, so that discussing the issue was as fraught with dangers as
was the delineation of constitutional monarchy in politics. Not only is
Shushtariconvinced by the Copermicanview of the solar system, but he also ar-
gues in favor of the roundnessof the earth. The traditionalMuslim view of the
cosmos as a series of stacked heavens, he points out, is incompatible with the
circular conception of the solar system currentamong Western scientists; he
goes on then to discuss Newton and the laws of planetarymotion.27

about cosmology and astronomywere largely derived from the Greeks. Thus he
sets up a choice between ancientEuropeanideas and modem ones, ratherthanbe-
tween Islamic orthodoxyand Westernscience. Second, he employs a mystical,
Sufi languageused to discuss the inadequacyof the intellect to understandGod's
mysteries. Here, an orthodoxrejectionof eighteenth-centuryscience in favor of
medieval theology becomes equatedwith the sort of hubrisinappropriateto a pi-
ous believer.28 (Such remindersof the fallibility of humanreason had also been
a feature of Galileo's writings.) Abu Talib was convinced of the truth of the
Copernicantheory,especially once he had seen an orrery,or mechanicalmodel of
the heliocentric solar system.29 Bihbahani's reports on eighteenth-century
Europeancosmology containlittle comment,but are interspersedwith numerous
pieties such as "and God grants success."30 No doubt, his status as a leading
Shi'ite clergymanmade it less necessaryfor him to defend his orthodoxythan for
a layman such as Shushtari.

Shushtariconcludes his discussion of Europeanscience with the reminderthat
the wondersof the modernEuropeanswere "innumerable,"pointing out thatEu-
ropean civilization was, after all, three thousand years old. He remains con-
vinced, however, that neither the Western Europeansnor the Chinese had suc-
ceeded in producinga thousandthof the wondersof the ancient Greeks; had their
books not been destroyedby the Caliph 'Umar in Andalusiaand Alexandria,the
world would have been far betteroff.31 The traditionthat the Caliph 'Umar, the
second vicar of the Prophet according to Sunni Islam, was responsible for
burningthe libraryat Alexandria,is, of course, apocryphal. The Shi'ite rational-
ist pins blame on Sunni know-nothingismfor the destructionof the Hellenistic
heritage, which by its richness might have made the Muslims-its most vigor-
ous heirs in the early medieval period-great. Modernwondersare offset with a
wistful appealto the myth of a squanderedgolden age.

One of the majordifferencesbetween Asian and Europeansocieties, according to
our authors,lay in genderrelations. Shushtarinoted that Europeansin Indiadid
not impose veiling or seclusion on their wives, even when these were local
Hindu or Muslim women, and he remarkedon the prohibitionagainst English-
men taking their Indianwives back to Britain for fear of tainting the homeland
with miscegenation.32 Abu Talib hugely enjoyed the greateropenness of Eu-
rope, and was apparentlyan incorrigibleflirt. He explains the lack of seclusion
and veiling among Britishwomen in four ways. First,the gender-dividedhouse-
hold in Muslim lands, with separatesets of servantsfor husbandand wife, would
have been too expensive in a country like England, with its high labor costs.
Second, the cold weather inclined the husbandto live and sleep with his wife.
Third, the British were more homogeneous as a population; in India, Muslims
and Hindus secluded their women from each other. Fourth,Europeansexpected

their wives to take partin the husband'sbusiness, which militatedagainstgender
segregation.33

Nonetheless, Abu Talib defends the treatmentof women in Muslim lands, insist-
ing that Muslim women enjoyed certainadvantagesover theirWesterncounter-
parts. Indian Muslim men let their women control the family finances, choose
the sect of Islam to which the childrenwould belong, and exercise greatauthority
over the servants. Muslim women could separate easily from their husbands
withoutdivorce, and in case of divorcewere awardedcustodyof the daughters-in
contrast to Europe where fathersgot custody of all children.34The idea of rela-
tive sexual equality plays no part in Abu Talib's constructionof gender roles.
(Incidentally, female segregationensuredthat we heardfrom no Muslim women
travelersto Englandin this periodwho might have disagreedwith Abu Talib.)

It should not be thought that these authorshad no criticisms of the Europeans,
though their discussion of the positive aspects of Europeanlife appearsto differ
radically in naturefrom their criticisms of it. Shushtarithoughtthat British de-
pendence on strategicand technologicaladvances in warfareaccounted for their
victories, whereas they "have none of the delight in braveryand courage pos-
sessed by other peoples."35 In short, what they lacked in manliness they made
up for in machinery. More particularly,Abu Talib forthrightlydevotes a chapter
to their faults. Although he speaks of the "English"as a whole, he in fact di-
rects his twelve major criticisms at the aristocratswith whom he associated-
another indication of the degree to which Shi'ite views of the Europeansper-
tained actually to the Europeanupperclasses. Abu Talib decries the ethics and
morals of the British, their lack of religious belief, and their inclinationto secu-
lar philosophy, which he thoughtbred dishonesty among the lower classes. He
also finds them wanting in chastity, exclaiming that hardly a street in London

> lacked a brothel. Besides, he believed, the Britishwere often selfish, irritableand
> inconsiderate, consumed with acquiringmaterialthings. The upperclasses are
> faulted for living extravagantly,keeping more carriagesthan they needed, over-
> furnishing their homes, and wasting a greatdeal of time on eating and dressing.
> These habits he contrasts unfavorablywith the ascetic warriorcode of Muslim
> Arabsand Turks.

> According to Abu Talib the English aristocracyerredbadly in allowing irreligion

> placent toward working-class riots and strikes, ascribing this insouciance to a
> half-century of British progress and triumphs,which feeling of invulnerability,

Finally, some of his criticisms bear upon the issue of colonialism. Although as
a guest of the aristocracyand a memberof the collaboratingnotable class in In-
dia Abu Talib does not cavil at the colonial enterprisein and of itself, even he is
hurt by some British attitudes. These include their vanity and arroganceabout
their attainmentsin science and theirknowledge of foreign languages. In partic-
ular, he thinks that the British official class knew Asian languages like Persian
much less well than they believed themselves to. One may attributethis partic-
ular criticism to professional disappointment:Abu Talib had planned to set up
an institute in London for teaching Persian to colonial officials but, for most of
his stay there, had found no encouragement. In conclusion he cites the British
"contempt for the customs of other nations."37 Once the question of colonial
hegemony arises, then, a discordantnote creeps into Abu Talib's generally flat-
tering estimate of the British. It is followed by the issue of the law courts, on
which he displays his pique at colonial abuse. While praisingthe functioningof
the judicial system in Britain,he excoriates the British courts in India, which he
thought laid local Indians open to abuse at the hands of expatriate carpet-
baggers.38 Even this early in its career, the collaboratingAsian elite expressed
discomfortat the mannerin which Europeanarrogancemanifesteditself, and the
thoughtlessness with which Europeaninstitutionswere grafted onto local ones.
Needless to say, for the members of this class such discomfort was not nearly
sufficient cause for abandoningthe collaboration.

It strikes one that whereas these authorsfocus on systemic features when they
discuss Europeansociety positively, their criticisms tend to concentrateon flaws
in what might be called national(or even class) character. The Europeannota-
bles, despite their philosophicaland technologicalprowess, were puffed up with
pride, or overly concerned with material acquisitions, or insufficiently coura-
geous, or too convinced of theirmasteryof foreign languages. The closest thing
to a systemic critique offered appears to be Abu Talib's comments on how
British justice went awry when the proceduresof London were transplantedin
Bengal. The objection is aimed ratherat the way the system worked than simply
characterflaws in colonial judges. Differentconceptionsof class also color Abu
Talib's cavils. His criticism of opulence in British aristocraticlife is a protest
against the embourgeoisementof the aristocracy in England. The contrasting
image he had in mind was the steppe or desert warriorsamong the Arabs and
Turks, who, in lore at least, were depicted as possessing ascetic values. His
friends, the lords and ladies of London, were closer in their actions to Muslim
long-distancemerchantsthanto the feudal warlordsin Iranor India. Shushtari's
depiction of the British officers as lacking in martialspirit echoes this percep-
tion-that the rulingclasses in the Indo-Iranianworld held vastly differentvalues
from those in Britain. While our authorswere much impressed by the govern-
mental and technologicaladvancesof the Europeans,it is clear that they had dif-
ficulty admiringan aristocracythey felt lackedSpartanvalor.

As hintedearlier,an important  contextfor the new writingaboutthe Europeans
lies in the greaterimpactof printingin the Persian-speaking

worldfromaround

especiallyimportant.Two of the worksherediscussedwerelithographed     in the
