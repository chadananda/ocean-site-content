             Heaven in China without "Religion"
And Manifestation

Theo A. Cope

"The Mandate of Heaven,
How beautiful and unceasing!
Oh, how glorious
Was the purity of King Wen's virtue!
With blessings he overwhelms us.
We will receive the blessings.
They are a great favor from our King Wen.
May his descendents hold fast to them".
(Book of Odes, ode no. 267, "The Mandate of Heaven")

It has often been asked by Baha'is who inquire into such things, "How is
it that China developed as it did, into a society founded upon morals and
ethical principles, without the acknowledged presence of an 'identifiable'
Manifestation of God?" This question seems to lead many into searching
for answers, into an understanding based upon a predominantly Western
notion of "religion," or reaching back through philosophical works
attempting to find justification for asserting that, in fact, ancient China did
have a Prophet. This assertion is based upon the belief that there never
was a time that humanity was without a Prophet to guide it, and perhaps in
the case of China, the absence of clear reference to such a Personage is
indicative of the ancientness of such a Being. Absence of such records
should not persuade us of the absence of such guidance, given the belief
that "[T]he only reason there is not more mention of the Asiatic prophets
is because their names seem to be lost in the mists of ancient history... We
are taught there always have been Manifestations of God, but we do not
have any record of their names."1 Thus, some conclude that China may

have had such a Prophet for guidance. Unfortunately, as there is no
evidence to support such a contention, and since a Baha'i-Chinese
dialogue cannot be based upon such a contention in today's academic
milieu demanding empirical evidence, perhaps a different approach may
enable us to contemplate religion without a Prophet.

This paper will present some ideas that may enable us to begin an
approach to this query from a different perspective. It will also present
briefly some teachings of the Baha'i corpus that indicate a harmonious
manner of conceiving what we discern in Chinese philosophy. In making
this assertion, it will be necessary to suspend our notions of "religion" and
adopt a more inclusive construct.2 We are emboldened in this manner of
advancing by a definition offered by 'Abdu'1-Bahá. We read: "Religion,
then, is the necessary connection which emanates from the reality of
things..."3 And in another passage we read, "... religion is the essential
connection which proceeds from the realities of things."4 We also notice
another passage that forces us to stop and ponder deeply: "Now
concerning nature, it is but the essential properties and the necessary
relations inherent in the realities of things."5 Religion is the necessary or
essential "connection," and nature is the "essential properties and
necessary relations." If one takes a brief perusal at the corpus of Baha'i
Writings existing in translation, it will become apparent that the dominant
view of religion, as heretofore used and taught in many Western
constructs, is too limited. Even if we take an etymological view, religion
is derived either from the Latin religare meaning "to bind fast," or from
religio, which is what the Church Fathers derived from religare; it could
even be from religere which means to "go through again, think over,
recollect, or consider carefully." Thus, we see in the Western word
"religion" a few ways of conceiving it. What 'Abdu'1-Bahá permits us to
do is to radically rethink this concept, and to begin to ponder religion in a
manner that is not fixed by specific definition.

\[2\] In the Baha'i Writings, we find many "definitions" or characterizations of the term
religion that indicate the need for a broader consideration than a doctrine or set of
teachings.

One current Baha'i thinker defines religion, based upon this conceptual
clarification by ' Abdu'1-Bahá, by asserting that it "is the name we give to
the relationship or link between these two values, God and humanity. The
living embodiment of this link is the Manifestation. Religion thus consists
of the three fundamental components: God, Man and the relationship
between God and Man, namely the Manifestation."6 This central
component, this tripartite relationship will become clear as we
contemplate the concept of tian/heaven as it developed within Chinese
thought. It needs commenting, though, that this tripartite relationship
extends beyond the Manifestation as the connective "link" with an
Unknown Deity, and is reflected in the injunctions found in the Baha'i
religious corpus that "He who knoweth himself knows his Lord."7 This is
similar to the relational view espoused in many Chinese philosophical
works, wherein we learn that "He who exerts his mind to the utmost
knows his nature. He who knows his nature knows tian."* It is herein
contended that if we limit our view of religion to a connective link
between an Unknown (and Unknowable) Reality and the Manifestation or
Prophet that is the "Spokesman" for this Reality, we endanger the
fundamental relationship that emanates from the "reality of things." The
relationship which results from the connections emanating from the reality
of things could be construed to be, in Chinese thought, what was

In the Chinese Weltanschauung, that is, world-view, there is not a unique
word for religion. As Phyllis Chew informs us, "In discussing the
'Chinese religion', one should note too that there is no Chinese word that
corresponds exactly to the word 'religion.' To the Chinese there is no
difference between religion and education. The Chinese people use the
word 'teaching' (chiao) to include all religions."9 In fact, for one who

challenged by most works on Chinese thought to find the current transliterated term. E.g.

standardization. Thus, the current word \sjiao. Through out this paper, I will provide both

peruses Chinese thought, to find such a differentiating term would be
surprising. In the current English-Chinese dictionaries, religion is
transliterated from zongjiao; zong is the 1st tone and means ancestor or
school, and jiao is the 4th tone and means teach, instruct and consult.
Chinese philosophy and religion are characterized by one essential fact:
there never was conceived to be a separation between Tian/Heaven and
Earth and Humanity. The central idea of this article is that it was, among
other factors, the notion of tian/heaven and its implicit unity with Earth
and Humanity that provided the religious orientation to Chinese culture
and philosophy. Since this trinitarian construct is central to Chinese
thought, it would behove us to pare it down and consider the idea of
tian/heaven. In so doing, we will be permitted a glimpse into a
fundamental thread that runs through the Chinese Weltanschauungen. The
lack of separation between Humanity and heaven implies much for a
world-view that is oriented by observation of the principles of nature, and
a deduction from these into the essential human principles of social and
personal life.

The Chinese word for heaven is t'ienltian and carries translations that
differ in dictionaries:

"The standard Chinese-English dictionary translations for tian are: (1) the
material heavens, the firmament, the sky; (2) the weather; (3) a day; (4)
Heaven Providence, God, Nature; (5) husband; (6) indispensable. In spite
of some overlap, these equivalences contrast rather starkly with those
provided by the Chinese-Chinese dictionary: (1) the sky; (2) qi; (3) the
movement and pattern of the heavens; (4) the sun; (5)
spirituality/divinity/mystery (shen); (6) nature, what is so-of-itself (zirari)
... The most significant gap in these two definitions of tian is the clear
absence of "Heaven, Providence, God, Nature" in the Chinese dictionary.
In fact, the dualism that requires appeal to transcendent deity in the
Western tradition has no relevance at all to Chinese culture."

This passage is offered to orient our ponderings, and provides our
ponderings with a view of the orient. What we clearly notice in many

transliterated terms for scholarly and common usage. See Chew's work, p. xi, for similar
reasons in her choice of systems.]

discussions, based upon the denotations of the term, is a diversity and
plurality of views. It may plausibly be asserted that the absence of these
three terms is indicative of the dominant Marxist-materialist philosophy
and cultural values in modern China, and does not indicate what the
authors cited may take it to mean. The work of Hall and Ames makes a
strong and cogent case that in Chinese thought, at least in the Han
dynastic times (206 BC-220 AD), that had significant impact upon
subsequent philosophical thought, there was no notion of a transcendent
tian (also spelled ťien by some)/"heaven." This evocation of
transcendence is, they assert, a Western conceptual overlay due to its
inherent dichotomous thought. They are not alone in the insistence that
the notion of transcendence that is dominant in the Western philosophical
tradition is not applicable to Chinese thought, while other authors make
assertions that, in fact, the concept of tian involves the notion, of
transcendence. That there will ever be a resolution to this debate is
uncertain; what is certain is that the authors who debate these issues are
involved in a process of hermeneutics and interpretation. What is also
certain is that, even in translations of the ancient texts, translators give
differing views.

One factor we are contemplating in this article, spelled out only briefly
here, is that of semantic slides. Semantics, as the field that studies word
use and meaning, indicates that the words we use change over time,
"slide" upward or downward in their usage. Thus, we note that the Greek
term psyche originally was used to refer to "breath," underwent a slide to
imply the "soul". Likewise, as we ponder the Chinese term tian, it may
serve us well to consider that what we may observe in our understandings
of its referent is how the meaning of tian is changing in human
consciousness and usage. Even if traditional Chinese culture had no overt
belief, expressed philosophically, about a transcendent field or Being in a
manner consonant with Western thought, the fact that many are now
"seeing it" or "reading it into the texts" does not imply its presence or
absence for the originators of the texts. It implies a different
understanding. But this is exactly what has occurred in the West; we
clearly witness it in the Chinese interpretations of their early philosophical
texts, beginning with the different understandings of tian in
Confucius/Kongzi, and his successor, Mencius. It should be noted here
that the Chinese term tian, often translated as "H/heaven" by some,

38           THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

"N/nature" by others, may best be left untranslated. We shall observe this
in what follows.

In pre-Zhou dynastic times (before 1100 BC), we find the word Ti (Di)
existed when referring to a tribal Lord. This tribal concept was later
expanded to mean the Deity for all humanity. "In the Shang [dynasty], he
was the supreme anthropomorphic deity who sent blessings or calamities,
gave protection in battles, sanctioned undertakings, and passed on the
appointment or dismissal of officials. Such belief continued in the early
Chou [Zhou], but was gradually replaced by the concept of Heaven
(T'ien) as the supreme spiritual reality."11 This supremacy of Ti which
was later transformed into Tian, occurred in the Shang times (1600-1100
BC) and "coincides with the supremacy of the Shang and its ruling
clan."12 The continuance of this God-concept seems to be relatively stable
at an early date, and is reminiscent of a similar transformation that
occurred in the Israeli tradition when Yahweh was "transformed" from a
local tribal volcano god into the Supreme Deity. In China, Tian was
perceived as intimately involved in human affairs, especially the ruling
dynasty. The king was the counterpart of Tian, as the Son of Heaven, and
Tian bestowed favour upon righteous kings, and sent portents if the
dynasty fell into disfavour through disregard for the proper rules of
conduct (//). Thus, the concept of Tian Ming, the Mandate of Heaven,
played a significant role in Chinese socio political history. This remained
consistent until the establishment of the People's Republic in 1911.

It is important at the outset to acknowledge that there is not unequivocal
certainty as to the historical origin of the word or its referent. "The
etymological origins of the term t'ien are obscure. The earliest
unambiguous instances of usage date from the early Western Chou, that
is, the eleventh century BC."13 Eno's work reviews two of the dominant
theories of the origin of tian and finds in both plausible and implausible
referents. He asserts that the tradition associated with the word indicates
that it might have referred to tian as the literal sky, the direction that the
ashes of the dead floated. This created in the minds of the people, an

association with immortality, death and a cosmic order. It also indicated
the importance in China of ancestor worship.

After the Shang and during the Chou/Zhou dynasties, the concept of tian
is seen to appear with that of £>/~God. "Just how the three terms were
understood in the early Zhou is less than clear, but it appears that, over
time, the term di would come to be used increasingly not to refer to a
supreme deity, as in the Shang, but to the supreme ruler of human society,
the emperor, while the word tian or 'Heaven', would more often be
employed to denote the power that governed all creation."14 However this
may be, it is generally mentioned that the "[U]ses of the word also varied
over time and among different filiations or schools of thought."15 It will
be helpful to keep this in mind as we proceed.

Kongzi (Confucius 531-479 BC) used the appellation Tian instead of the
more personal Ti when referring to heaven. The recorded sayings of the
Master in The Analects, which was likely written down by his followers,
had a more naturalistic conception than personal. Tian operated in the
affairs of Humanity through Nature, which were regular, seasonal and
balanced between the opposites of Yin and Yang, as well as the Five
Agents {Wu Xing): earth, fire, metal, water, and wood. In the Chinese
tradition, there were Five Classics that were central to Confucian
ideology: the Book of Documents/History {Shu Jing); the Book of
Songs/Odes {Shi Jing); the Book of Changes {I Qing or Yi Jing); the Book
of Rites {Li Ji); and the Book of Ceremonies/Spring and Autumn Annals
{YiLi).

Each of these books present images of //Wheaven that are
complementary. We shall limit ourselves to a consideration of /zTm/heaven
as it is presented in the works attributed to Kongzi, and the Confucian
School, and the Yi Jing (I Ching). The reason for limiting our inquiry is
not only due to the complexity of the idea, but also due to the diversity of
views in the Chinese tradition. From 1313 until 1905, a Confucian
quadrad known as the Four Books was the required standard for civil
service examinations in the country. These four books were The Analects

(Lunyuf6, the Book of Mencius, the Great Learning {Da Xue) and the
Doctrine of the Mean (Zhong Yung). The interpretations used were those
of Chu Hsi (Zhu Xi), 1130-1200 AD, who established Neo-Confucian
ideology m ways that stripped it of its Daoist and Buddhist influences that
had gathered over the decades. Thus, even though we will look only at
Confucian tradition, this in no way detracts from the understanding we
can gain offtTm/heaven,nor imply the insignificance of Daoist views.

We find in the Yin Yang School, which developed the doctrine of yin and
yang to cosmological principles from the likely origin of referring to
physical phenomena, a philosophy that impacted all aspects of Chinese
civilization. 77úw/Heaven is said to have given King Yu, the founder of
the Xia dynasty (2200-1700 BC) the Nine Categories. These were central
to philosophy, in various guises. These categories have been given as
consisting of sets of five and include: five agents (elements); five
activities; five directions; five arrangements of time; five musical notes;
five grains; five sense organs; five atmospheric conditions; five metals.
The Five Agents, or Five Elements were used conceptually to extend to
different dynastic reigns, thus each dynasty was characterized by a
particular manner represented by an element, and a particularly dominant
colour. "Philosophically, however, it resulted not only in the concept of a
common law governing both man and Nature, but also in a most important
doctrine that has dominated Chinese philosophy in the last eight hundred
years, namely the unity of man and Nature, or 'Nature and man forming
one body'."17 There is little remaining of this school of thought, but its
impact was highly significant.

Heaven, as a term used by translators of Chinese thought, was translated
from tian. However, this term was also translated more in the sense of
"nature" by many of Kongzi's followers, thus presenting a philosophy that
was integrated with the human world. In The Analects, when tian is
mentioned, it is usually with reference to an impersonal, but conscious
order, or being. This does not mean that Kongzi disavowed belief in a
personal heaven, but that the interpretations usually offered on this theme

\[16\] It is interesting that even this term, translated from the term Lunyu, comes from the
Greek term analekta meaning "selection," while it could just as well be defined as
"conversations, discussions, or viewpoints." I am indebted to the presentation of this
concept in DeBary and Bloom, see p. 42.

are presented more naturalistically. A modern interpreter presents an
image of Kongzi and asserts that he was deeply religious from his youth,
and inculcated this religiosity in his followers.18 Analects (14, 37) is a
comment on Kongzi's belief that Heaven knows him and his purpose. We
read: "But there is Heaven, He knows me!" Another interpreter gives us
this: "It is heaven that knows me." We notice immediately the
personalistic attribution in the first translation by Jingpan, and this may be
due, m part, to his education at a St. John's University in Shanghai, a
Christian university. We also notice that in the first translation, Heaven is
given, while the second has heaven. The capitalization of the transliterated
term may be indicative of a Western oriented transcendental bias, but no
matter what, it is indicative of semantic changes. Heaven must be
transcendent, and must be "H" since this indicates a superior reality. Be
that as it may, //Wheaven was intimately concerned with Kongzi's
mission. In The Analects we also find that ft'Wheaven communicates

Kongzi's role was, as presented by himself, not a reformer, but a
transmitter. This has been debated, but in his transmission of the concept
of ftTWheaven, he seems to hold to the view as expressed in the earlier
Chinese religious traditions.21 As long as there were noble men and sages

\[20\] This is Jingpan's translation in op. cit., p. 362, but is consistent with other translations
available.

\[21\] The debate in this arena is summed up as follows: the "Ancient Text" school asserts that
Kongzi was a transmitter of ancient knowledge, and what we read in the Analects should
read this; the "Modern Text" school asserts that Kongzi was a reformer, and he simply
asserted it was not out of genuine humility and cultural propensity to not assert one's self.

who worked to redeem mankind from straying from the Dao, the Way,
heaven supports their workings, even if it is inscrutable to individuals. In
fact, we find in The Doctrine of the Mean passages that require our
reflection:

"(31) Only the perfect sage in the world has quickness of apprehension,
intelligence, insight, and wisdom, which enable him to rule all men;
magnanimity, generosity, benignity, and tenderness, which enable him to
embrace all men...There fore we say that he is a counterpart of Heaven.
(32) Only those who are absolutely sincere can order and adjust the great
relations of mankind, establish the great foundations of humanity, and
know the transforming and nourishing operations of heaven and earth.
Does he depend on anything else? How earnest and sincere—he is
humanity! How deep and unfathomable—he is abyss! How vast and great-
-he is heaven! Who can know him except he who really has quickness of
apprehension, intelligence, sageliness, wisdom, and understands character
of Heaven?"22

In these passages we notice clearly that the sage is the counterpart of
heaven, and is heaven. No sense of transcendence is implied here, but an
immanence that the sage embodied. In fact, the entire corpus of
Confucian philosophy was about embodiment and becoming a sagely
person. The rectification of one's conduct and names, the becoming ren,
or the noble person (junzi), having integrity, and living up to one's word,
is about embodying the qualities and characteristics that these entail. So,
even if Kongzi did not overtly talk about tian, in a doctrinal sense, but
only informs us that he did not talk about it, it does not tell us why or if he
believed it was immanent or transcendent (if these terms even are
applicable).23

One of Kongzi's grandson's disciples was Mencius/Mengzi/Meng Ke
(371-289 BC). Little is known about his life, but the extant writings
attributed to him clearly show a continuance of the personal idea of
Heaven. He believed that God (Di) was the supreme moral authority, and

humanity's goal was to live a life in order to keep the harmony with
//aw/heaven. He also spoke as if he had a role to play in continuing the
transmission of taw/heaven's dictates to humanity. We read: "Heaven's
plan in the production of mankind is this-that they who are first informed
should instruct those who are later on being informed, and they who first
apprehend principles should instruct those who are slower to do so. I am
one of Heaven's people who have first apprehended; -- I will take these
principles and instruct this people in them. If I do not instruct them, who
will do so?" We thus notice a clear notion of tow/heaven as intimately
involved and concerned with the affairs of Humanity, and Its spokesmen
as striving to keep people following the Way of //aw/heaven. TzWheaven
has endowed Humanity with faculties and senses. Humanity's task is to
use these senses, under the control of the mind, to find the principles
inherent in all things. "If we do not think, we will not get them. This is
what Heaven has given to us. If we first build up the nobler part of our
nature, then the inferior part cannot overcome it. It is simply this that
makes a great man."25

Following Mengzi, Xun Kuang, or Xunzi (?310 BC-7215 BC), an
influential scholar at the Jixia Academy in the feudal state of Qi, presents
tian as simply natural order that does not interfere with human affairs and
should not be interfered upon by humans. It is, rather, the given context
within which all beings exist. As natural order, it is unconcerned with the
dynastic changes, or the fortunes of any sovereign or individual; but
individual effort and responsibility is required. The complementarity that
exists with /zWheaven and Humanity, and the recognition of the trinity of
these and Earth, formed a seminal idea in Confucian thought.

Dong Zhong-Shu (Tung Chung Shu) was a minor philosopher who lived
from 179-104 BC, but historically he is significant inasmuch as he was
pivotal in getting Confucian philosophy to be the state doctrine. He saw
the universe as an organic whole, and man as a microcosm. With Nature
the macrocosm and Humanity the microcosm, the dynamic interplay
observable in Nature were reflected in Humanity. Tzzzzz/heaven has its
forces of yin and yang, the opposites of passive and active, etc., and

\[26\] DeBary and Bloom, Sources of Chinese Tradition, p. 170.

Humanity likewise has its opposites of humanity (jenlren) and greed. As
//arc/heaven can restrict the operations of these two forces, so can a
person. From this, we are given to learn that tian/heavm and Humanity
operate m a similar manner. On the personal level, humanity was viewed
to have inherent goodness, but potentially so. What was needed was
education to discipline this human nature. "The activity of Heaven
extends to a certain point and then stops. What stops within the operation
of Heaven is called human nature endowed by Heaven, and what stops
outside the operation of Heaven is called human activity."2' This
dimension of human endeavour needs to be trained, thus the king and the
sage are set up to provide the society in which these aspects can be
cultivated. Dong Zhong-Shu even went to far as to make a
correspondence with tian/heaven and the physical body, as we also notice
in Jewish and Islamic mystical speculations, with the human mind
resembling the spiritual intelligence of/raw/heaven.

The persistence of the belief and teaching thatri<zw/heaven,Earth, and
Humanity formed a trinity was long lasting in Chinese thought. In
generations of Confucians succeeding Mengzi, we notice a gradual
transition in the idea of tian. Instead of maintaining the usual usage as
tian/heaven, in a Zhou or Shang perspective, the developments and
philosophical integration during the Han dynasty (202BC - 220 AD), it
became to be presented more in reference to natural phenomena. In part
this was due to Mengzi himself. He is quoted as saying, "He who
exercises his mind to the utmost knows his nature. Knowing his nature,
he knows Heaven." Another translation gives us: "He who fully realizes
the potentialities of his heart knows his nature. He who knows his nature
knows Heaven."28 From this was deduced that tianlhtavQn was immanent
in the heart of Humanity. What we also notice here is the use of mind and
heart for the same term. This is not unusual, and represents the fact that
one term, xin, is used for both ideas, and is often translated in more recent
philosophical works as "mind-heart," or "heart-mind". The role of the
sage is to continually guide mankind to what is immanent in human

given as "human nature" and mentioned in the Analects only twice, but developed more
fully in Mengzi and other Confucianists.

nature, and to educate humanity in the proper use of the mind, and the
right attachments of the heart, thus to "attain heaven."

A contemporary of Meng Zi was Xuanzi (Hsun Tzu), and he was often
considered a rival to Mengzi's theories. Even though his thought
dominated until the Han period (206 BC - 220 AD), Mengzi is considered
as the heir of Kongzi's teachings. However, in Xuanzi, we notice clearly
the presentation of tian in a more natural manner, and translators often use
"nature" and this became part of many subsequent ideas of /zWheaven in
Confucian philosophy. To him, tian/heaven was invisible and "The sage,
however, does not seek to know Heaven. When the office of Heaven is
established and the work of Heaven is done, the body will be provided
and the spirit born, and the feelings of like, dislike, pleasure, anger,
sorrow, and joy embodied. These are called the natural feelings."25
Nature and natural law is called Dao or Li (Principle), which everyone
needs to obey. For Xuanzi, tian/nature and Earth were the source of life,
and the noble man or the sage, formed a triad by following and
embodying the principles of Nature. As we will see, from these followers
of Kongzi, many others held to the notion that tian/heaven was immanent,
and the role of the sage was not to attempt to discern //aw/heaven's will,
but to embody it. This embodiment was not accomplished only through
Humanity, but became to be primarily reflected in the speculations and
observations upon Nature as an embodiment of tian's will.

Before progressing further in time, let us pause and consider the concept
of tian/heaven as presented in the Book of Changes, the Yi Jing. This
work, more than any other, formed a central basis of both Confucian and
Daoist thought. This work is attributed to King Wen, who preceded
Kongzi by about 500 years. While there are questions about some of the
current text, there are parts that all scholars concur existed in pre-
Confucian times. Both Kongzi and Laozi were reported to have consulted
this work and meditated deeply upon its meanings. In this work, we notice
that the first hexagram, Ch Hen (Chen), meaning the Creative, is connected
with tian/heaven, and oftentimes, ch'ien is even translated as heaven.
"Through the inclusion of the heavenly in the concept of creativity,
something truly significant happens to heaven. It is drawn down out of its
heights into the human cosmos. The divine heaven becomes a human

heaven. The idea of a divine heaven is also known in the Book of
Changes, but the places where only the divine heaven are meant are so
clear and stand in such a lively and fruitful contrast to those signifying the
human heaven that the interplay is easily recognizable."30

We notice that the second hexagram, Kun, which is attributed to earth, is
the counterpart of heaven. There is no duality implied in this construct,
but a complementarity/polarity that is essential to Chinese thought.
Heaven is yang, the ruler, the father, dynamic, creative, and bold; earth is
yin, the subject, recipient, passive, and yielding. We see here that Nature
is the counter-part of Heaven, and neither is complete without its
complement. "Heaven is high, earth is low; thus the Creative and
receptive are determined. In correspondence with this difference between
low and high, inferior and superior places are established... In the heavens
phenomena take form; on earth shapes take form. In this way change and
transformation become manifest."31

The "Great Appendix" which discusses this book claims, "the tao of
Heaven is in it; the tao of man is in it; the tao of earth is in it."32 We also
notice that the "Great Appendix" is referred to as "The Great Treatise"
and was a commentary on the Book of Changes by successive generations
of scholars. In this work we read: "The Book of Changes contains the
measure of heaven and earth; therefore it enables us to comprehend the
tao of heaven and earth and its order."33 It is through contemplation on the
changes visible in nature and humanity that the images of the trigrams
(three lines, either broken or solid) were composed, combined into
hexagrams, and said to represent all the manifold changes in existence.
The persistence of the trinity of fta^/heaven, Earth and Humanity is
enforced and carries through to successive generations of Chinese. One
significant fact of the Book of Changes is its pronouncements on life. It
provided an imagistic and some say proto-philosophical view that looked
to the natural world and its images and events to discern tarn's/heaven's
ways. In this work, interpreters present spirit as connoting natural forces
of observable life, and #<z«/heaven is conceived to be Principle {Li), a
cornerstone idea of Confucian and Neo-Confucian thought.

In the 8th and 9th century AD, a revival of Confucian thought is seen m the
philosophy of Han Yu and Li Ao. Before their time, Confucian doctrines
were becoming more and more entangled with Daoist and Buddhist
speculative ideas about mind, spirits, emptiness, and the reality or non-
reality of created existence. These two worked to strip Confucianism of
these tendencies, the inaction ascribed to by Daoists, and the silence and
illusory nature of existence ascribed to by the Buddhists, and to return its
focus to moral society and moral action. Neo-Confucian thought followed
the reformulating by these two men, and is said to begin with Zhou Tun-i
(Chou Tun-i) (1017-1073).34 He re-establishes the philosophical focus
upon human nature and the Way (Dao), which had been neglected in the
intervening years due to too much emphasis upon textual studies of the
classics, for attaining bureaucratic positions, and not enough upon living
the implications of the views expressed.35 One of his major works was
"An Explanation of the Diagram of Great Ultimate," which gave the
framework of Neo-Confucian metaphysics for centuries. "Therefore it is
said that 'yin and yang' are established as the way of Heaven, the weak
and strong as the way of Earth, and humanity and righteousness as the
way of man."3} The correlation between /m/i/heaven, Earth and Humanity
is continued, and sincerity, righteousness, purity of heart, and other
Confucian ideals again become the thrust of this philosophy.

Continuing the Neo-Confucian thought, we notice two brothers, Zheng
Hao (Ch'eng Hao) and Zheng Yi (Ch'eng I) who rise to dominance and
greatly impact later developments. In the case of the first brother (1032-
1085), we see a focus on the manifestation of existents from the one
principle (//), and his brother's (1033-1107) focus on production and
reproduction. Zheng Hao's dominant motif is the Principle of Nature, that

\[34\] There seems to be disagreement about this by various scholars, but let us not concern
ourselves with this here.

\[35\] In considering Confucian philosophy, we must remember its integral relationship to
bureaucracy in China. Ever since the implementation by King Wu (141-187 BC) of
Academies, at the urging of Dong Zhongshu, the examinations for bureaucratic office were
based upon Confucian texts. This guaranteed the dominance of Confucian over other
philosophies, and integrally linked Confucian thought with political position. Thus, in
understanding the development of Confucian thought, an awareness of this relationship is
helpful. It was utilitarian to know the Classics, pragmatic and financial more than purely
philosophical (if there was ever a time that it was since from its inception Confucianism
was intimately concerned with the socio political order).

\[36\] W.T. Chan, A Source in Chinese Philosophy, p. 464.

is, Tian-li, the Principle of Heaven. This became to refer to Natural Law.
"The great innovations of the Ch'engs, as we have seen, is the elevation of
principle to the place formerly occupied by heaven; and this involves
treating 'heaven' and its 'decree', as well as the 'Way', as merely names
for different aspects of principle."37 We even notice that the ancient term
for Heaven, 77, which also referred to God, becomes simply another^name
for Principle that controls all things. Both brothers adhere to this
construct. We find, "Heaven is principle. 'The word 'psychic' refers to
what is inscrutable in the innumerable things.' God (ti) is the name given
to it as the ruler of events."38 In this passage, psychic refers to a state of
being that can also be characterized by integrity, or composure.

Semantic change, like what is witnessed in the alteration from ri^m/heaven
as a ruling concept, as an ordering principle for human life, becoming
subsumed under the rubric of Principle, indicates the non-theological
nature of this concept in Chinese thought. More than that, it seems to
demonstrate the alternative aspect of religare, that is, the aspect of
relationship which is built upon "the necessary connection which
emanates from the reality of things." It is essential here that we briefly
consider how Heaven became so subsumed.39
Since Confucian philosophy was not given over to speculative
metaphysical thought in the same manner as found in Daoism, it remained
grounded, so to speak, by "investigation into the nature of things," ke-wu.
Even when Confucianism became embroiled in such debates, it was in
response to Daoist and Buddhist philosophies. As indicated above,
Confucianism always seemed to return to its "roots" in an embodied, life-
as-lived, relationally-defined and textually documented approach.

\[37\] A.C. Graham, Two Chinese Philosophers, 1992, p. 23.

\[38\] ibid., p. 117.

\[39\] In what follows, we shall follow one line of reasoning: the notion of Heaven was altered
from a transcendent field that was also an immanent field. With yin and yang, at their
extremities, yang becomes yin, and yin becomes yang. These corollaries are inherent in its
polar dimension; thus to speak of an immanent-transcendent field is to acknowledge the
polar necessities here as well. Below in the text, we shall present a view that eschews any
notion of a transcendent reference to heaven. Ultimately, we must acknowledge that we do
not know what the Chinese philosophers in the "Warring States" or Han dynasty believed.
The hermeneutic process invariably involves the hermeneut's frame of reference and locus
of understanding, etc.

The investigation into the nature of things has its origin in the Da Xue, the
Great Learning. There, we read in Chapter 4: "Confucius said, Tn hearing
litigations, I am as good as anyone. What is necessary is to enable people
not to have litigations at all.' Those who would not tell the truth will not
dare to finish their words, and a great awe would be struck into people's
minds. This is called knowing the root." Chapter 5: "This is called
knowing the root. This is called the perfecting of knowledge."40

Based upon the interpretations of chapter five, it was taken to mean the
investigation of things and the extension of knowledge. This investigation
was into the principles that underlie all phenomena, based upon careful
observation and penetration. Investigation was taken to extend from the
observation of the myriad things of existence, with their flux and
harmony, leading one to inner sincerity, peace and harmony with the .
//an/heaven and Earth, thus forming the trinity. The precursors to Neo-
Confucian thought, Han Yu and Li Ao, worked to reconnect
Confucianism with the classics, and by so doing, re-establishing the social
component implicit in this tradition.41

Investigation into principles meant the principles of proper social order as
well as one's nature, yin and yang visible in natural events, and the
material force (qi I chi) running through all things. Since humanity was an
integral part of nature, investigation was into the roots of one's self and
these forces operating within the individual, and one's social
relationships. We find this fundamental component of Neo-Confucianism
articulated clearly by Zheng Hao and his younger brother, Zheng Yi. In
the works of the former we find: "The investigation of principle to the
utmost, the full development of nature, and the fulfillment of destiny
(ming, fate)—these three things are to be accomplished simultaneously.
There is basically no time sequence among them. The investigation of
principle to the utmost should be regarded merely as a matter of
knowledge. If one really investigates principle to the utmost, even one's

*° These passages are translated and cited in W.T. Chan's work, pp. 88-89.

\[41\] It is important to note that one of the distinguishing characteristics of Confucian thought
was its insistence upon "returning to the texts" for legitimization. We note that in the
West, it was metaphysical assertions and claims that impelled speculative
theosophers/philosophers to harken to ancient traditions and texts for "verification" of
their veracity.

nature and destiny can be fulfilled."42 Principle, since it is coursing
through all things, can be approached in an external or internal manner.
The younger brother comments thusly, "To learn them from what is
outside, and grasp them within, is called 'understanding.' To grasp them
from what is within, and connect them with outside things, is called
'integrity.' Integrity and understanding are one."43 Graham comments on
this, "Yi-ch'uan, followed by Chu Hsi and his school, lays stress on the
objective approach, which Ming-tao, anticipating Lu Chiu-yuan (1139-
1192) and Wang Shou-jen (1472-1528), prefers the subjective. But the
two points of view are of course not incompatible, and the difference,
which was to become the great controversial issue in Neo-Confucianism
for the next five-hundred years, is only a difference of emphasis in the
Ch'eng brothers."44

However, this difference of emphasis, this extraverted and introverted
approach taken by these two brothers, forever alters the discourses and
understandings of Li/Principle, 7ia«/Heaven and Humanity as portrayed
and debated in Neo-Confucian thought. We see how easy it was to
subsume //aw/heaven under the primary concept of Principle (//), and to
assert that the various names, as presented above are all different aspects
of Principle. For the Zheng's (Ch'eng's) Principle became the primary
referent, and the concept of Heaven was more "naturalized." Following
this move, Lu Hsiang-Shan (Lu Xiang-shan) declared that "Principle is
endowed in me by Heaven, not drilled into me... The mind is one and
principle is one. Perfect truth is reduced to a unity; the essential principle
is never a duality. The mind and principle can never be separated into
two."45 Here, to investigate things means to investigate mind, since mind
is principle. Neo-Confucian thought was thenceforth divided over the
concept of //arc/heaven and Principle (//), without coming to a resolution
or clear determination as to the nature of either. But, one consistency is
that ^Tm/heaven became equated with the Principle of Nature in its
naturalistic guise. It does, however, remain a moral obligation to follow
tian Vheaven's decree and the investigation of things.

So far we have seen how the concept of fcWheaven served, in Chinese
philosophy, a mediating role in human consciousness, with all of
existence. By coming to learn the Mandate of Heaven, (tianming) society
was to be ordered. In order to balance the needs of society, one must
balance the other relationships of human life. In order to balance the
relationships of life, one must live in balance with /zWheaven. In its
initial guise, the Mandate was a relationship relegated to the King, but
later became the Principle of Nature, and Nature's decrees, an inherent
component of every person. It was the nobleman, the sage, that could best
embody this Mandate and best understand the Principle. From its roots in
pre-Confucian religious thought, the idea of ftWheaven has played a
dominant role in all subsequent permutations of Confucianism. While the
concept has fundamentally changed to a viewpoint that is more natural,
the continuation of the belief in Heaven, Humanity and Earth forming a
trinity remained consistent, and religious in orientation.

It seems a bit disingenuous not to mention that the discussion about
//Wheaven being 'religious' and transcendent, is a modern Western-
originated one. In the philosophical works of Chinese thinkers, we find no
such debate. It is not until after the impact of Western thought, and
Christianity, as presented to the Chinese in the late 1800's, that the debate
of a 'religious' aspect to ^'aw/heaven enters the literature.46 Levenson
asserts that "[I]t was left to the nineteenth century Christians, Western and
Taiping, to dwell on the shadowy classical concept of Shang-ti as a
transcendental supreme power. The traditional Confucian sancta were all
bound up in T'ien, Heaven, whose 'mandate' (ming) made rulers
legitimate and committed them to virtue (not power) to the end of
harmony (not creative change). T'ien and Shang-ti had different
origins."47 He is not alone in this contention, and its mention serves to
forewarn us to not exclude this consideration in our ponderings.

Likewise, the work by Hall and ^™ies, as indicated above, calls our
attention to the assertion that tian/heaven was never a transcendent field
of reference in Chinese thought. There was simply no conception of a
separation that implied transcendence. 77<WHeaven was immanent in life

\[46\] It is telling that we do not find such a change after the initial encounter with Christianity,
under the Jesuit, Matteo Ricci, who came to China in the late 16th century.

and the heart. Indeed, it has been asserted by one Chinese scholar that "...
whatever might be construed as transcendent in classical Chinese
thought, it is not independent of the natural world, nor is it theistic. Far
from entailing the dualism entailed by Western models of transcendence,
classical China's world order, according to Mou, is altogether 'this
worldly'."48 The sage was concerned with actively transforming his inner
character in order to transform the outer social structure and interactions.
Thus, as we saw above, the sage is the representative of //arc/heaven, and
is tian/heaven. The Chinese view affords us an alternative and
complement to the Western concept of transcendence that has dominated
philosophical discourse and interpretive hermeneutics. It also affords us
insight into the alternative meaning of religion that is under
consideration.

It would appear that much of Confucian thought, both in its original and
Neo-Confucian strain, utilized the concept of ftarc/heaven and the
relationship with the individual and the collective, to contemplate man's
place in the universe. While it retained its relationship in the formation of
a trinity, the strong religious nature of i/arc/heaven was altered, without
losing its moral prerogatives. If we contemplate the definitions of religion
proffered by 'Abdu'1-Bahá given in the opening passages of this work,
then it seems logical that a civilization and culture that based much of its
philosophy upon the views of Kongzi, deriving from ancient Chinese
heritage, would find religious fulfilment by determining the essential
connections that emanate from the reality of things.

While there is no way to verify the thesis that China never was graced
with a Manifestation, and while it is a central component of Baha'i belief
that humanity has always been guided by such Mediators, unless some
empirical historical evidence is forthcoming, perhaps we may be better
served in learning how it is that Chinese thought retained its essential
connection to ^arc/heaven and the principles (If) emanating from the
reality of all things. If we are enabled to understand this dimension of the
Chinese psyche and thought, we may learn from Chinese thought how to
conceive of Heaven, Earth and Humanity forming a trinity. And lest we
pass over this casually, to conceive also means to "take to oneself (thus

\[48\] Cited in Hall and Ames, Thinking from the Han: Self, Truth, and Transcendence   in
Chinese and Western Culture, 1998, p. 223.

its use as conception in a physical sense); so we conceive new ways of
understanding by new ways of embodying and taking these conceptions as
our own.

By so doing, we come to de-literalize the Western concept of Heaven,
permit a fluid and unfixed definition, as well as learn to see religion in a
manner that truly focuses on the "essential connections emanating from
the reality of things." Then religion can be reconceived from being merely
a set of rules that one is obligated to follow, imposed upon humanity from
a Deity, to one that also acknowledges religion as a relationship which is
inherent in the very structure of existence. In so doing, we are also
enabled to overcome the strict transcendence that is the cultural heritage
of Western theology that has created such a gulf between heaven and
earth, spirit and nature, God and creation. Indeed, the Baha'i corpus
provides us with the means of conceiving this polar view, but this is not
the place to develop this line of thought.49
It may serve us well if we now very briefly consider how it is that the
Baha'i Writings present the concept of Heaven, Nature and the
Manifestation, and determine if there is a concordance of thought with
these Chinese ideas. In fact, it is very apparent that in Baha'i thought,
"heaven" is a concept of immense import. We notice clear teachings
indicating its metaphorical nature. In Baha'u'llah's work, Kitáb-i-Iqán,
The Book of Certitude, He elucidates many of the meanings of heaven as
used in the Judeo-Christian-Islamic traditions. We read, referring to the
term heaven as used in these Holy Scriptures:

"In the utterances of t^e divine Luminaries the term 'heaven' hath been
applied to many and divers things; such as the 'heaven of Command,' the
'heaven of Will,' the 'heaven of the divine Purpose,' the 'heaven of divine
Knowledge,' the 'heaven of Certitude,' the 'heaven of Utterance,' the
'heaven of Revelation,' the 'heaven of Concealment,' and the like. In
every instance, He hath given the term 'heaven' a special meaning, the

\[49\] What this would entail is a consideration of the concept of the Manifestation as
presented in the Baha'i corpus, as well as a profound realization of a Both/And
complementarity. The Writings present such a consideration by permitting us to
contemplate the "distinction and unity" of the Manifestation. See Baha'u'llah, Kitáb-i-
íqán, p. 21. We are given to hold such disjuncts without conceiving therein essential
opposition. Likewise, to hold a transcendent/ immanent disjunct without seeing these as
opposites, moves us closer to grasping the polar terminology as used in Chinese thought.

significance of which is revealed to none save those that have been
initiated into the divine mysteries, and have dmnk from the chalice of
immortal life."50

The process by which "heaven" became concretized into a "place" is
beyond the scope of this article. However in the New Testament, we read
that Christ ascended into heaven, and in the Qu'ran we read that
Muhammad ascended to the seven heavens, and these were interpreted to
refer to the physical sky, and spiritual places.51 We find, contrary to these
notions, that the Baha'i corpus emphasizes the non-literal and non-
physical meaning of these terms. When they do refer to a physicalist-sky
concept, it is made clear. Commenting on the idea of the "seventh
heaven", 'Abdu'1-Bahá informs us that:

"With regard to that which hath been mentioned concerning the seven
spheres and the seven heavens referred to in the Books revealed by the
Dawnmg-places of Light and Repositories of Secrets in previous ages,
such references were dictated by the conventional wisdom prevailing in
those times, for every cycle hath its own characteristics which are
determined by the capacities of the people and their readiness to accept
fresh revelations of the truth from behind the veil. All things are ordained
by God according to a given measure. When the Prophets spoke of the
celestial spheres what they intended was no more than the orbits of the
planets falling within that greater world that embraces the sun and its
attendant planetary system."52

The psychological tendency to concretise these spiritual concepts led
many into assuming that heaven referred to the physical sky and that there
were levels of heavens of a subtle nature, and that both Jesus and
Muhammad physically ascended into the immensity of space. But it must
be noted that "space" is a modern concept that replaced the notion of

author's work, Re-Visioning, Re-Thinking, Re-Placing: From Neo-Platonism to Baha'i in a
Jung Way, to be published in February 2001 by George Ronald Press.

place in Western thought.53 Thus, heaven was a place where souls. of
believers went after death, and where the true believers were rewarded
with meeting the Cherubim and Seraphim as well as the other elect and
Prophets. The Baha'i concepts shatter this concretisation, persuading us
that a new manner of envisioning "heaven" is needed.

Indeed, this new manner impels us to conceive of a relationship between
heaven and humanity that is embodied. This embodiment is derived from
the fact that "Earth and heaven cannot contain Me; what can alone contain
Me is the heart of him that believeth in Me and is faithful to My Cause."54
This immanent presence of the Divine in the human reality and
consciousness enables us to realize that the connection between heaven
and humanity, between the Prophet and humanity is closer than our life-
vein.55 The heart is the "seat of the All-Merciful and the throne wherein
abideth the splendor of His revelation,"56 and it is by cleansing the heart
that knowledge of the Manifestation is attained. This conscious
knowledge establishes a relationship with this Presence, and in so
establishing a relationship, humanity recognizes its connection to the
physical and spiritual cosmos.                "*

In a manner similar to the re-visioning of the. concept of heaven, the
Baha'i Writings present the idea of Nature in a way that also impels us to
conceive a connection similar to that found in Chinese thought:

"Say: Nature in its essence is the embodiment of My Name, the Maker,
the Creator. Its manifestations are diversified by varying causes, and in
this diversity there are signs for men of discernment. Nature is God's Will
and is its expression in and through the contingent world. It is a
dispensation of Providence ordained by the Ordainer, the All-Wise. Were
anyone to affirm that it is the Will of God as manifested in the world of
being, no one should question this assertion. It is endowed with a power
whose reality men of learning fail to grasp. Indeed a man of insight can
perceive naught therein save the effulgent splendour of Our Name, the

History, 1997.

\[54\] Baha'u'llah, Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 186. This reiterates a hadith
attributed to Muhammad.

\[56\] ibid.

Creator. Say: This is an existence which knoweth no decay, and Nature
itself is lost m bewilderment before its revelations, its compelling
evidences and its effulgent glory which have encompassed the
universe."

While it is clear that the Chinese world-view does not include the concept
of Names of God, nor the Will of God in a manner similar to that in the
West, the notion of Principle (//) can be discerned to be a harmonious
concept. Indeed, a man of discernment would observe the workings of the
laws of nature and perceive these signs and principles underlying them.
In fact, the Yi Jing uses the observations of the principles of nature
discerned by humanity, codifies them into a symbolic system that has
sustained Chinese speculative thought for centuries and still resonates
deeply in the Chinese psyche. To present the concept of Nature in such a
fashion, Baha'u'llah reveals passages that have profound reverberation in
the human psyche, both in the East and West, and permits us to re-
consider the connection inherent in the reality of all things.

It also provides us a framework with which to grasp the interconnection of
all existence as well as imagine how it is that the reality of the
Manifestation is conceived by Baha'u'llah to be "...transfigured before
Him into a sovereign Potency permeating the essence of all things visible
and invisible."58 This potency, reflected in the human heart and Nature,
provides the foundation of the harmony that exists between Humanity,
Nature and Divinity.

In like manner, to re-conceive the concept of God, we note how the Baha'i
corpus presents ideas of profound import. Perhaps it would be better to
assert that there is not a concept of God found in the Baha'i Writings, but
a concept of the Manifestation of God that dominates. In fact, we are
informed clearly that any concept we may have, any Name or Attribute
that humanity has attributed to God must be re-considered. 'Abdu'1-Bahá
informs us, "Accordingly all these attributes, names, praises and eulogies
apply to the Places of Manifestation; and all that we imagine and suppose
beside them is mere imagination, for we have no means of comprehending

\[57\] Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Translated by
H. Taherzadeh, 1978, p. 142.

\[58\] Baha'u'llah, Gleanings, p. 102.

that which is invisible and inaccessible."59 Likewise, He informs us. that
contingent reality can never conceive the non-contingent Reality, that
Reality, that "Potency" mentioned by Baha'u'llah.

"Then how could it be possible for a contingent reality, that is, man, to
understand the nature of that pre-existent Essence, the Divine Being? The
difference in station between man and the Divine Reality is thousands
upon thousands of times greater than the difference between vegetable
and animal. And that which a human being would conjure up in his mind
is but the fanciful image of his human condition, it doth not encompass
Goďs reality but rather is encompassed by it. That is, man graspeth his
own illusory conceptions, but the Reality of Divinity can never be
grasped: It, Itself, encompasseth all created things, and all created things
are in Its grasp. That Divinity which man doth imagine for himself
existeth only in his mind, not in truth. Man, however, existeth both in his
mind and in truth; thus man is greater than that fanciful reality which he is
able to imagine."60

This assertion seriously challenges many of the concepts of God that
humanity has held for centuries. It compels us to humble ourselves,
accept the limitations of our concepts, and begin to envision in a manner
that maintains the immanent connection between us and that Potency,
while honouring fully the station of humanity as an embodied servant.
Again, we discern how it is that the Baha'i Writings present to us a
concept of the harmony of humanity with existence.

Chinese thought pursued an understanding of this relationship by
investigating the principles they observed in life processes and
phenomena.       Chinese philosophy, in its Confucian and Daoist
manifestations, encouraged and inculcated the notion of embodying the
principles of tian, in order to effectuate the fullness of being a human,
which carried over into the social relationships, society and the kingdom.
The West pursued an understanding by abstract metaphysical
speculations. The Chinese way (dao), as articulated in Confucianism, was
of embodiment; the Western way was of separation from nature and

transcendence. The Western philosophical ideal was founded upon
rationalism, while Chinese ideal never forgot the body with its needs and
implications.61 Chinese thought never divided tian from Earth, Yin from
Yang, positive from negative, etc. It saw all life as a unified and coherent
whole, with polarities that were essential to existence. As the root of
"whole" can be found in "holy" perhaps to contemplate within the temple
of a unified holistic reality may permit us to grasp in greater depths of the
essential connection emanating from the reality of things. By so doing, we
can move beyond the secular/sacred, holy/unholy franscendent/immanent
dichotomies of Western religious thought. As part of the trinity composed
of Heaven, Earth and Humanity, we are an integral part of one whole, not
isolated in reality, but only in our thoughts. We have but to understand
that we form an integral part of existence, a connection that is essential to
its operations, at least for us. Chinese religious and philosophical thought
enables us to begin an approach to this essential connection we serve. The
Way of Heaven and the Way of Humanity coincide. It is our
misunderstandings that divide.

When Westerners or religious adherents approach Chinese philosophy,
and when contemporary Chinese do likewise, it may behove us to
examme closely the notion of transcendence in Chinese thought, and our
field of reference for this idea. While we can never get behind these
views as held by early philosophers, we are well served by considering
whether or not the Western notion of transcendence is applicable to
Chinese philosophy. We may ask ourselves: "Why should it be?" If the
thrust of Chinese thought is embodiment, in order to perpetuate the
harmony that was believed to exist between tian and humanity and the
earth, surely the immanent dimension of tian should be considered. We
must move beyond our Western constructed and influenced categories in
our interpretive hermeneutics of Chinese thought. Akin to the notion that
light is a wave and a particle, and ultimately is electromagnetism, to hold
that there can be a transcendence in polar union with an immanence
effectually enables us to conceive new manners of thinking. As we
conceive, new ways are born.

\[61\] For a wonderful work that presents this idea clearly, see Lin Yutang, The Importance   of
Living.

Religion, as the "necessary connection" seems to have imbedded in it an
immanent component. By hesitating to translate tian as H/heaven, we
may be enabled also to learn how it is that Chinese philosophers
conceived of existence as an integrated whole with polar dimensions that
are integral to the human experience. We may also learn how to conceive
without fixed categories and terms, akin to how the Baha'i corpus present
the notions of heaven and religion, and how quantum physics presents
current understandings of "matter." For philosophical works, especially as
developed in the West, specificity of terms is essential. Aristotle spent
many works coming up with clearly demarcated definitions and this set
the precedence. We see no such specificity in Chinese thought.
Pluralism, as a philosophical view, as well as a pluralistic manner of
perceiving, is not new. This is exactly what quantum physicists hold in
their approaches: matter is and is not solid. It is our frame of reference
that, in part, determines what we observe. Tian is and is not transcendent;
is and is not "heaven"; it is much more than this. In this way, and by
extension, in considering other terms that have been given decidedly
Western interpretive frameworks, we may learn more of what is implied
in the Baha'i Writings when Baha'u'llah informs us that "[T]he highest
essence and most perfect expression of whatsoever the peoples of old
have either said or written hath, through this most potent Revelation, been
sent down from the heaven of the Will of the All-Possessing, the Ever-
Abiding God."62 Likewise, we note a clear principle proffered: "He also
saith: "We speak one word, and by it we intend one and seventy
meanings; each one of these meanings we can explain."63 Likewise, "...
the classical Chinese commentators focus their interest in how a living
term discloses its meaning within its various contexts, rather than
assuming that terms have some univdcal, essential meaning independent
of how they are used."64 Westerners, seeking to understand philosophical
or religious texts are inclined to literalize and concretise these terms.
Perhaps we can learn not to, thus not to ossify these dynamic systems.

The resonance we notice within the language of the Baha'i corpus and
Chinese thought may enable humanity to learn a new manner of
envisioning the full complexity of our existence. We are transcendent and

immanent; the Manifestation is the immanent Representative of a
transcendent "Energy" we have learned to call "God". 65 The focus in the
West on transcendence to the exclusion of immanence, except the
mystical doctrines that served to counterbalance this tendency, has served
to fragment our views from nature, society, self-in-relation, and
ultimately, from our self

These considerations, it is herein proposed, may provide us with views as
to how China could develop as it did without records of an identifiable
Manifestation. By suspending traditional interpretive notions and terms,
we may be enabled to envision manners of approaching existence,
approaching an understanding of Chinese thought as well as the Baha'i
Religion that are in harmony with "heaven".
