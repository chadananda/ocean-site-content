> **Abstract:**  
>   
> This paper aims to trace some of the analogies and essential differences between the concept of the "Perfect Man" (Pole) in Sufism and the Bahá'í notion of the Manifestation of God based on the Bahá'í Writings and the works of prominent Sufi scholars-theologians: At-Tirmidhí, Ibn al-'Arabí, Dáwud-al-Qaysarí, Haydar Amulí etc. What underlies both these notions is the idea that at all times the Divine Will manifests Itself to humanity through or in a certain Person, whose purpose is to be a shepherd, guardian and educator of humankind, directing it towards the good and keeping it from what is wrong.  
>   
> This idea is expressed in Sufism by the teaching about the "Muhammadan Essence" or "Muhammadan Light" (analogous to the "Logos" of Neoplatonians and the "Word" of the Christians), the first emanation from God, also going by the name of the Primal Intellect. This is the Image of God in its undifferentiated (undivided) unity, by Whom and from Whom all things were created and Which preexisted all things in creation (not in time but as a cause to the effect). This "Muhammadan Essence" is realized successively in Adam, the Prophets and the Poles each of whom is "The Perfect Man of the age."  
>   
> The philosophic development of this issue in the form of a doctrine is associated with the name of the great Sufi philosopher from Andalousia (Southern Spain) Ibn al-'Arabí (11651240), though clear allusions to the same idea can be traced in the work of an earlier Sufi writer—at-Tirmidhí (IX c.).  
>   
> In the Bahá'í teaching there is also a notion of the Divine Will making Itself manifest at certain intervals in a special Person, divinely preordained for this Mission. The similarity of the characteristics applied to the "Perfect Man" in Sufism and the Manifestation of God in the Bahá'í teaching is obvious. However, in spite of these remarkable analogies there are also striking differences between the Sufi and the Bahá'í notions. What is implied by the Divine Manifestations in the Bahá'í Faith is a special category of created Beings who are sent down to humanity with a new Revelation from God at more or less definite intervals. These are the Great Prophet-Founders of' the Religions. In contrast to this the Sufi concept reflects the predominant Moslem view that Prophethood was terminated in the Prophet Muhammad, consequently there can be no prophet after Him. From this point in history the "Muhammadan Essence" is realized in the "saints," specially chosen by God, who are called "Wali." The latter act on behalf and within the teaching of the Prophet Muhammad.

                                           The Perfect Man

The Perfect Man and the Manifestation of God

by Y.A. Ioannesyan

bdu’l-Bahá mentions a Perfect Man several times. In his “Commentary on the 11th Chapter of

‘A       the Revelation of St. John” He says, “In the beginning of the eleventh chapter of the Revelation

of St. John it is said: ‘And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, say-
ing, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein. But the court
which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy
city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.’” Then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá goes on to explain: “This reed
is a Perfect Man Who is likened to a reed, and the manner of its likeness is this: when the interior of a
reed is empty and free from all matter, it will produce beautiful melodies; and as the sound and melodies
do not come from the reed, but from the flute player who blows upon it, so the sanctified heart of that
blessed Being is free and emptied from all save God, pure and exempt from the attachments of all human
conditions, and is the companion of the Divine Spirit. Whatever He utters is not from Himself, but from
the real flute player, and it is a divine inspiration. That is why He is likened to a reed; and that reed is
like a rod—that is to say, it is the helper of every impotent one, and the support of human beings. It is
the rod of the Divine Shepherd by which He guards His flock and leads them about the pastures of the
Kingdom” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Some Answered Questions, p. 45].1 “Therefore, it cannot be said there was a
time when man was not. All that we can say is that this terrestrial globe at one time did not exist, and
at its beginning man did not appear upon it. But from the beginning which has to beginn in g, to the end
which has no end, a Perfect Manifestation always exists. This Man of Whom we speak is not every man;
we mean the Perfect Man [ibid, 196]. In another instance ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ mentions the Perfect Man in Paris
Talks: “To man is given the special gift of the intellect by which he is able to receive a larger share of
the light Div in e. The Perfect Man is as a polished mirror reflecting the Sun of Truth, manifesting the
attributes of God” [Paris Talks, p.13].2

These, along with other occasions,3 have caused me to reflect upon the nature of the “Perfect Man” in
Sufism where this concept originated in order to trace some of the analogies and essential differences
between the concept of the “Perfect Man” (“Pole”) in Sufism and the Bahá’í notion of the Manifestation
of God. What underlies both these notions is the idea that at all times the Divine Will manifests Itself
to humanity through or in a certain Person, whose purpose is to be a shepherd, guardian and educator
of humankind, directing it towards the good and keeping it from what is wrong. This idea can be traced
to the Qur’án: “He directeth the ord in ance from the heaven unto the earth; then it ascendeth unto Him
in a Day, whereof the measure is a thousand years of that ye reckon” [32:4].4

That the Divine Command needs an expression in the form of a Divine Vicegerent and Educator for
the education of humankind, is clearly stated by Sufi philosophers. Sufism, as we are aware, does not
have a singular nor uniform teaching. Every ind iv idual writer may have a slightly different view on a
particular issue. Here we may neglect these minor differences between Sufi thinkers and talk about
Sufism as a whole. Let us now consider some quotations from Sufi works, paying close attention to the
highlighted terms and expressions (highlighted by author):

“For God chooses Messengers from among the angels and people, so that these may direct hum an s
towards what profits them in this world and the next, and remind them of the Days of the Lord, the
Exalted, and of the things, which they have forgotten, in order to occupy them with [their] develop-
ment…. He teaches them the Book, wisdom and ..., in which (Book) the commands and prescriptions
about adm in is t ration, purity and worship are clearly stated.... There of necessity exists for humankind,

Lights of ‘Irfán

d im in is h ed by [its human] nature,...a Governor, confirmed by God, so that he may visibly or invisibly
overpower souls, which resist the Truth and are subject to their passions. But for him order would never
be established in their earthly existence…. If there were no one to restrain them through [his] overpow-
ering might and force, both inwardly and outwardly or in one of these [two ways], their submission and
resignation to His decrees and commandments would be impossible.... But for the restrictions imposed
on the subjects, the world would never be in order.... Necessar il y, at all times there is an Educator, as a
vicegerent of the true Prophet, who turns the creation towards the Truth. The vicegerent of necessity
possesses divine confirmation, so that he may subdue people [who seek] learning and profit those who
can draw benefit [from it]” [‘Alá-al-Dawla Simnání.5             – Al-Tirmizí, Khatm... (Appendix), p. 488
(all translations are the author’s unless otherwise stated)].

“Since this vicegerency is a necessity, established by God in the world... , consequently the appearance
of a vicegerent at all times is needed for... attaining unto perfection, which is worthy of each human
being” [Qaysarí.                   , lithography, p. 34].6

“The Divine Command/Cause needs an expression, in order to adm in is ter Justice,.... [and] guard the
order in this world and the next. That this [expression] should rule in Its Lord, Who is the Lord of Hosts,
in heaven also, executing Justice. So that each of them (images) may attain unto its perfection, both out-
ward and inward. He is the Prophet, the True Pole, eternal and ever abiding, the First and the Last, the
Manifest and the Hidden. And He is the Mu˙ammadan Essence/Reality” [Qaysarí.                              –
Al-Tir m iz í, Khatm... Appendix), p. 490].

We come here to the important notion of the “Mu˙ammadan Essence” or “Mu˙ammadan Light” (anal-
ogous to the “Logos” of Neoplatonians and the “Word” of the Christians), the first emanation from God,
also going by the name of the “Pr im al Intellect.” This is the Image of God in its undifferentiated (undi-
vided) unity. It is by and from this Essence, Which preexisted all things in creation (not in time, for time
and space are peculiar properties of the physical realm, but as a cause, which preexists its effect), that
all things were created. The “Mu˙ammadan Essence” is successively real iz ed in Adam, the Prophets and
the Poles each of whom is “The Perfect Man of the age.”

The philosophic development of this issue in the form of a doctrine is associated with the name of
the great Sufi philosopher from Andalousia (Southern Spain) Ibn al-‘Arabí (1165–1240), though clear allu-
sions to the same idea can be traced in the work of an earlier Sufi writer – Al-Tirmizí (IX c.).
This is how the origin of the “Mu˙ammadan Essence” is explained by Ibn al-‘Arabí and Dáud Qaysarí:

> “There was God, and there was none other than Him (lit.: nothing with Him).... When He
> desired the existence of the world, He initiated its origin within the bounds of what He knew of
> it by His knowledge in Himself                                      . Out of this holy volition, by a
> flash of shining light there appeared a separation of the uni versal substance/reality               ,
> called the “Pr im al Dust”          . This is analogous to a sculptor molding the gypsum or plaster
> of Paris, so that patterns and forms, which he desires, may be revealed in it. This is the first of
> all existing things.... Then the All-Glorious shone forth with His light through the Dust. This is
> called by thinkers the “Pr im al /U n iversal Matter”              . The whole world          is [con-
> ta in ed] in it in a potential and ideal form. And each thing in this Dust received from this [Light]
> to the extent of its power and capacity, like the corners of a house receive the light from the
> lamp to the extent of their proximity to this light, which (proximity) accordingly contributes to
> their share of illumination and receptivity. As He, the Exalted, has said: “Allah is the Light of
> the heavens and the earth. The similitude of His light is as a niche wherein is a lamp” (Qur’án.
> 24: 35). Thus He has likened His Light to a lamp. And there is nothing in that Pr im al Dust near-
> er to this [Light] to receive it, than the Mu˙ammadan Essence/Reality, called the “Pr im al
> Intellect.” It became the Lord of the world in its entirety and it is the first to appear in the
> [realm] of being. Thus, its origin is from this divine Light, the Pr im ary Dust and the Universal
Substance/Reality” [Ibn al-‘Arabí.                  (the pa s sage is quoted by Ámulí in his

, p. 410)].7

\[54\] The Perfect Man

> “In expl an ation of the ‘Vicegerency’ of the Mu˙ammadan Essence, Which is the ‘Pole of Poles.’
> According to what has been established, for each of the Divine Names there is an image                    .
> in God’s Knowl ed ge, call ed the ‘t r ue self ’         or the ‘arc h e t y p e/pr im al im age’
All of them have outward forms, called the ‘expressions’             and ‘m an i fest bein gs’ (          .

)These Names are the masters              of these expressions, who are their subjects
You have learnt that the Mu˙ammadan Essence is the [ideal] image of God’s general Name

[reality] of the Universe, for It is the possessor of the Greatest Name”                          [Qaysarí.

, lithography, p. 33].
The situation can be presented in the following table:

The above quotations may be summ ar iz ed in the following manner:
1\. God chooses people (and angels).
2\. These Chosen Ones of God direct humans towards what is good for them.
3\. They teach people spiritual principles, laws and whatever is related to the next world.
4\. Humanity is never left without an Educator.
5\. He has divine confirmation.
6\. He brings order into existence.
7\. His Purpose is to perfect the human race.
8\. He is the Ruler, enjoying ind is putable Authority.
9\. He executes Justice.

How does, then, according to Sufi thinkers, the Mu˙ammadan Essence/Reality make itself manifest?
Let us again turn to the texts:

> “[Mu˙ammad/Mu˙ammadan Essence] is the manifestation of God’s general Name (Alláh). He is
> forever and ever God’s Vicegerent in the world. The other Poles and Perfect [Men] are His
> vicegerents in His community.... Whoever of the dwellers of the ‘Jabarút,’ ‘Malakút’ and the
> physical realm (‘Mulk’) exists in the world does not receive [anything] but from Him. Their per-
> fection is from Him, as well as His Vicegerency is through them.... This Vicegerent does not
> govern the dwellers of the earth but in accordance with the requirements of the Divine
> Command (lit.: except that what the Divine Command requires) and the Essential Will            .

Lights of ‘Irfán

> And He bestows [His bounties] upon the archetypes to the extent of their readiness in eternity”
> [Qaysarí.             –Al-Tir m iz í, Khatm... (Appendix), p. 497].

> “The Mu˙ammadan Spirit                     has a manifestation in the world. The most perfect of
> His manifestations is in the ‘Pole of the time’...” [Ibn al-‘Arabí.            (quoted by Ámulí
> in his                       , p. 418 (see endnote 7)].

> “The one, who has inherited vicegerency from his Father, Adam, as legacy, is the the one, who
> truly receives the property. For He is God’s Vicegerent and He is also the Perfect [Man] of [His]
> time and the Pole of Poles” [Al-Til im sani (quoted by Ámulí in his                          , p.

505)].8

> “The manifestation         of this Mu˙ammadan Essence is through special (separate) manifesta-
> tions (lit.: is through the special manifestations of each of them) to the extent suitable to the
> people of a given epoch and time, depending on what the name of the given age
> requires at that moment of the manifestation of perfection. These (manifestations) are in the
> forms of Prophets, may peace be upon them!

> “Considered from the standpoint of their individualization and personification, and the princi-
> ples of plurality and creation, governing this realm, which (principles) account for the difference
> and differentiation between them in things unrelated to the Mu˙ammadan Essence, which is
> common to all the names, the manifestation of each One of them occurs under a certain name
> and [is] characterized by certain qualities. If you consider them from the standpoint of their
> Reality and relation to the level of Unity (lit.: the presence of Unity), and the principle of one-
> ness that governs it, you will grasp the mystery behind the union between them and the unity
> of things of God’s religion which they brought with them.... Therefore, the Pole, who is the axis
> of the fundamental principles of the world and the Center around which existence revolves from
> the eternity past to the e ternity fut ure, is one, though con side red from the angle of plu-
> ral i t y, It is plural” [Qaysarí .                 , lithography, p. 34].
From the above quotations we learn the follow in g:
1\. The Mu˙ammadan Essence, which incorporates in itself [the principles of] the Divine Command and

the Divine Will, is God’s Vicegerent in the world;
2\. It manifests Itself to the creatures;
3\. It manifests Itself through separate manifestations;
4\. Such manifestations are His (Its) vicegerents on earth (in the physical world);
5\. These manifestations are in the form of God’s chosen Ones—a category, which includes also Prophets;
6\. Though each of these manifestations personifies the same Reality, it occurs under a certain name and

is characterized by certain qualities;
7\. They all demonstrate the principle of the Essential Unity on one level, and the principle of plurality, which

is inherent in the realm of creation, on the other (in things unrelated to the Mu˙ammadan Essence);
8\. The most perfect of His manifestations is in the ‘Pole of the time’, who is also the Perfect [Man] of

[His] time and “Pole of Poles”;
9\. Each manifestation of the Mu˙ammadan Essence occurs to the extent, which is suitable to the people

of a given epoch and time.
For all this there are analogies in the Bahá’í teaching about the Manifestation of God. In the Writings
we find the following passages:

> “God leaves not Hi s chi ldren comfortless, but, when the darkness of winter overshadows them ,
> then again He sends His Messengers, the Prophets, with a renewal of the blessed spring. The Sun
> of Truth appears again on the horizon of the world shining into the eyes of those who sleep, awak-
> ing them to behold the glory of a new dawn. Then again wi ll the tree of humanity blossom and
> bring forth the fruit of righteousness for the healing of nations” [Paris Talks, p. 22]. (emphasis
> added)

\[56\] The Perfect Man

“All the Manifestations of God came with the same purpose, and they have all sought to lead
men into the paths of virtue” [ibid, p. 121]. (emphasis added)

“...the Source of infinite grace... hath caused those luminous Gems of Holiness to appear out of
the realm of the spirit, in the noble form of the human temple, and be made manifest unto all
men, that they may impart unto the world the mysteries of the unchangeable Being, and tell of
the subtleties of His imperishable Essence” [Bahá’u’lláh. Kitáb-i-ˆqán, 99].9

“These Countenances are the recipients of the Divine Command, and the day-springs of His
Revelation” [ibid., p. 153]. (emphasis added)

“Through their appearance the Revelation of God is made manifest, and by their countenance
the Beauty of God is revealed” [ibid., 177-178].

“Furthermore, it is evident to thee that the Bearers of the trust of God are made manifest unto
the peoples of the earth as the Exponents of a new Cause and the Bearers of a new Message.
Inasmuch as these Birds of the Celestial Throne are all sent down from the heaven of the Will
of God, and as they all arise to proclaim His irresistible Faith, they therefore are regarded as
one soul and the same person” [ibid., p. 152].

“These Manifestations of God have each a twofold station. One is the station of pure abstraction
and essential unity. In this respect, if thou callest them all by one name, and dost ascribe to
them the same attribute, thou hast not erred from the truth.... For they one and all summon the
people of the earth to acknowledge the Unity of God, and herald unto them the Kawthar of an
infinite bounty. They are all invested with the robe of Prophethood, and honoured with the
mantle of glory.... Say in gs such as this, which indicate the essential unity of those Exponents of
Oneness, have also emanated from the Channels of God’s immortal utterances, and the
Treasuries of the gems of divine knowledge, and have been recorded in the scriptures. These
Countenances are the recipients of the Divine Command, and the day-springs of His Revelation.
This Revelation is exalted above the veils of plurality and the exigencies of number.... Inasmuch
as the Cause is one and the same, the Exponents thereof also must needs be one and the same....
It is clear and evident to thee that all Prophets are the Temples of the Cause of God, who have
appeared clothed in diverse attire. If thou wilt observe with dis c r im in ating eyes, thou wilt
behold them all abiding in the same tabernacle, soaring in the same heaven, seated upon the
same throne, uttering the same speech, and proclaiming the same Faith. Such is the unity of
those Essences of being, those Lum in aries of infinite and immeasurable splendor” [ibid.,
152–154]. (emphasis added)

“Purge thy sight, therefore, from all earthly limitations, that thou mayest behold them all as the
bearers of one Name, the exponents of one Cause, the manifestations of one Self, and the reveal-
ers of one Truth...” [ibid., 159]. (emphasis added)

“We have already in the foregoing pages assigned two stations unto each of the Lum in aries aris-
ing from the Daysprings of eternal holiness. One of these stations, the station of essential unity,
We have already explained.... The other is the station of distinction, and pertaineth to the world
of creation and to the limitations thereof. In this respect, each Manifestation of God hath a dis-
tinct individuality, a def in i tely prescribed mission, a predestined Revelation, and specially des-
ignated limitations. Each one of them is known by a different name, is characterized by a spe-
cial attribute, fulfils a definite Mission and is entrusted with a particular Revelation. Even as
He saith: ‘Some of the Apostles We have caused to excel the others.... It is because of this dif-
ference in their station and mission that the words and utterances flowing from these Well-
springs of divine knowledge appear to diverge and differ. Otherwise, in the eyes of them that
are initiated into the mysteries of divine wisdom, all their utterances are in reality but the
expressions of one Truth” [ibid., 176–177]. (emphasis added)

Lights of ‘Irfán

> “Thus, viewed from the standpoint of their oneness and sublime detachment, the attributes of
> Godhead, Divinity, Supreme Singleness, and Inmost Essence, have been and are applicable to
> those Essences of being.... Viewed in the light of their second station—the station of distinction,
> differentiation, temporal limitations, characteristics and standards—they manifest absolute
> servitude, utter destitution and complete self-effacement. Even as He saith: ‘I am the servant of
> God. I am but a man like you’” [ibid., 177–178]. (emphasis added)
This last quotation merits special notice. It has direct parallels in the Sufi description of the
“Perfect Man”:

> “Except for the [attribute of] ‘self-subsistence’                 all the divine attributes of necessity
> should be applicable to the vicegerent, who truly exemplifies all His names.... We make this [dis-
> tinction]: except for ‘self-subsistence,’ because it is by this [attribute] that the [One Who is] Self-
> Subsisting is distinguished from him (vicegerent).... Because he (vicegerent) incorporates all the
> divine mysteries, manifesting God’s general Name (Alláh). Consequently, the vicegerent is a ser-
> vant to God and is the Lord to the world owing to his ‘Lordship’” [Qaysarí.                        – Al-
> Tir m iz í, Khatm... (Appendix), p. 497].

> “This Lordship is from the standpoint of his Reality and not from the standpoint of his human-
> ity. For in the latter aspect [he is] a governed servant          , who is in need of his Lord”
> [Qaysarí.                    , lithography, p. 33].
The first sentence of the first paragraph also has a direct parallel in Bahá’í Writings:

> “Therefore, all that the human reality knows, discovers and understands of the names, the
> attributes and the perfections of God refer to these Holy Manifestations” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Some
> Answered Questions, p. 148].
Thus, if we compare the definition of the Manifestation of God in the Bahá’í literature with the Sufi
description of the Perfect Man we can hardly escape noticing the similarities of the characteristics
applied to the Manifestation of God and the Perfect Man, especially those which are related to their pur-
pose, function and stations. To make this compar is on easier we highlighted the most obvious phrasal
analogies in the quoted texts. Let us now consider other terms, which bear the same meaning as or are
used in the context of the Perfect Man:

> “The Perfect Man is one, who leads by his essence (in his essence?)...to his Lord. None other than
> the Perfect Man is the crown of the physical world             . He is the one who [is referred to] in
> His (God’s) say in g: ‘God created Adam in His own image’ and ‘He is the First and the Last, the
> Manifest and the Hidden.’ He is the one, who combines nature and intelligence. As regards his
> nature, in him there is the crudest and the most refined composition. In him there is an abstrac-
> tion from the materials and the power, which dom in ate the bodies. No other created being pos-
> sesses this [quality]. It is for this reason that he is uniquely marked with the knowledge of all the
> names and the Word in its entirety. God does not reveal [to us] that He has bestowed this [qual-
ity] upon anyone but the Perfect Man.... It is by the Perfect Man that the Divine Decree

about the reward and pun is hment becomes manifest in the world             , and by him order
is established and destroyed, in him it is fulfilled, introduced and administered” [Ibn al-‘Arabí.

– Al-Tirmizí, Khatm... (Appendix), p. 275–276].

> “‘Perfect’ is a man, who has attained unto the level of perfecting [others], who is perfect in the
> knowledge of the religious law             , the mystical Path       and its true experience. Because
the attainment unto [this] position is necessary that he may perfect others” [Ámulí.

– Al- Tir m iz í, Khatm... (Appendix), p. 505].

> “A Prophet is a Perfect Man, who is sent down from God to His creation, for him to summon
> them (people) to Him, and for their salvation from darkness and ignorance” [ibid, 504].

\[58\] The Perfect Man

> “A Messenger is a Perfect Man, who combines these stations – [that of] a Prophet and [that of]
> a chosen One, and [accumulates] all the properties of these two, related to knowledge, gno-
> sis, apostleship and the communication [of the message]     ” [ibid, 504].
“Therefore it is said: ‘The Absolute Man                       is the Prophet of the time (lit.: of his time)’”
[Ámulí.                          , p. 378].

From the former of the above quotations it is clear that a Prophet and a Messenger are included into
the category of the Perfect Man. In the latter “the Prophet of the time” is identified with the “Absolute
Man,” which suggests that the Absolute Man is but another term to designate the Perfect Man. That
other terms, namely “the True Man” and “the Pole,” are also applied to the Perfect Man, follows from
the passages below:

> “Know that what is implied by the ‘True Man’ is the Pr im al light, which is the first Emanation
> ( l i t.: the light to be the first to eman ate –             , the Inte ll ect, the Holy Spir i t”
> [ibid, 518, see endnote 5].

> “The Pole is the means, whereby the inhabitants of the world attain unto a true life. He is the
> one, on whom the gaze of Him, [Who is] the Exalted, is focused, when He contemplates creatures,
m an i fest and hidden. ‘The Greatest Pol ar i t y’                is the station of the ‘Pole of Poles’

, which is the inner reality          of Mu˙ammad’s Prophethood.... It is but by her-
> itage         , which is exclusively                and altogether           h is (Mu ˙ amm ad’s), that
> this [station] is conferred upon” [ibid, 504].
It is evident from these statements that the relation of the ‘True Man’ and the ‘Pole (Pole of Poles)’ to
the Mu˙ammadan Essence (or the Mu˙ammadan Essential Light), which is clearly def in ed as the first
Emantion and Ind iv idu al iz ation, is the same as that of the Perfect Man. That the ‘Pole’ is but a Perfect
Man becomes ever more obvious from the following passage:

“The Perfect Man of necessity is diffused in all creatures like the flow of the Truth in them.... As the
Shaykh (Ibn al-‘Arabí)...stated in his ‘Fut uh at’ in the chapter ‘about the position of the Pole’: ‘The Perfect
Man is the one, whom God has desired to be the Pole of the world and God’s vicegerent therein.... It is
necessary for him to watch all human beings, who until the Day of Judgment are goin (lit.: will in g) to
enter the [realm of] being’” [Qaysarí.                      , lithography (section 8), p. 33].

It is clear from the considered quotations, that according to the Sufis, the “Perfect Man,” who is the
expression of God’s Will, is not applied solely to Prophets. This conclusion is confirmed by another pas-
sage from Sufi works:

> “The Prophethood and Saintship              have a twofold meaning—the absolute and restricted,
> in other words: general and particular, legislative            and non-legislative.... As regards to ‘the
> absolute,’ it is the basic         , real          Prophethood, which is ac qu ired in pre-eternity
> and is preserved forever.... The real, basic Prophethood consists in the knowledge of the
> Prophet, who is endowed with it (Prophethood), concerning the capacities of all the creatures
> from the standpoint of their essences                       , t h ei r cor re s p onde nce to their ideal
> mo de l s/arc h e t y p e s     and [in knowledge about] their [innermost] realities                    . [It
> also includes] administering justice to all who deserve it in a language, in which they (people)
> are capable [of receiv in g] a message about the essential [reality], and [capable of receiving] a teaching,
> [which is] true and eternal ,                   about what is known to be the ‘Highest Lordship’
> and ‘Supreme Authority.’ The possessor of this station is named the ‘Greatest Vicegerent,’ ‘Pole
> of Poles,’ ‘Macrocosm,’ ‘True Adam (Man),’ defined as the ‘Supreme Pen,’ ‘Primal Intellect,’

Lights of ‘Irfán

> ‘Greatest Spirit’ etc.... This is referred to by the initiated        in their utterances about the
> likeness between God and the world: ‘The Perfect Man is like God, who (the Perfect Man) is the
> true Great Connecting Link                      . For God, the Exalted, gazes upon the world by his
> gaze and graciously bestows existence upon it (the world)...” [Ámulí.                      , p. 380].
This passage is highly remarkable, for it highlights at one time a point of considerable difference from
and a point of obvious sim il arity with the Bahá’í teaching. One Difference consists in the fact, that in
the Bahá’í teaching the Manifestation of God or God’s Will is identified only with the Prophet-founders
of religions. They are the sole channels for the Divine Will to manifest Itself to creation:

> “The splendors of the perfections, bounties and attributes of God shine forth and radiate from
> the reality of the Perfect Man—that is to say, the Unique One, the supreme Manifestation of
> God. Other beings receive only one ray, but the supreme Manifestation is the mirror for this Sun,
> which appears and becomes manifest in it, with all its perfections, attributes, signs and won-
> ders. The knowledge of the Reality of the Divinity is impossible and unattainable, but the
> knowledge of the Manifestations of God is the knowledge of God, for the bounties, splendors
> and divine attributes are apparent in Them. Therefore, if man attains to the knowledge of the
> Manifestations of God, he will attain to the knowledge of God...” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Some Answered
> Questions, p. 222].

> “The Manifestation—that is, the Holy Lawgiver—unless He is aware of the realities of beings,
> will not comprehend the essential connection which proceeds from the realities of things, and
> He will certainly not be able to establish a religion conformable to the facts and suited to the
> conditions. The Prophets of God, the supreme Manifestations, are like skilled physicians, and
> contingent world is like the body of man: the divine laws are the remedy and treatment” [ibid,
> 158].

> “The Manifestations of universal Prophethood Who appeared independently are, for example,
> Abraham, Moses, Christ, Mu˙ammad, the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. But the others who are follow-
> ers and promoters are like Solomon, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel. For the independent
> Prophets are founders; They establish a new religion and make new creatures of men...” [ibid,
> 164–165]. (emphasis added)

> “From this it is certain and evident that if we imagine a Divine Reality outside of the Holy
> Manifestations, it is pure imagination...” [ibid, 149].
That the Mu˙ammadan Essence—the Sufi analogue of the Divine Will can, according to the Sufi
thinkers, be manifested through channels, other than the Prophets, namely classed under the category of
the ‘Chosen’ or ‘Sa in ts’, is explicitly stated by the Sufi authors (we will consider this in more detail later).
As for the point of obvious similarity, it consists in the definition of the function of the Prophets, their
purpose and mission. The idea, that the Prophet possesses knowledge of the essences of things and bases
his relationship with humanity upon this essential knowledge (see above) is also part of the Baha’i teach-
ing, which can be illustrated by the following quotations from ‘Abdu’l Bahá:

> “Briefly, the supreme Manifestations of God are aware of the reality of the mysteries of beings.
> Therefore, they establish laws which are suitable and adapted to the state of the world of man,
> for religion is the essential connection which proceeds from the realities of things. The
> Manifestation—that is, the Holy Lawgiver—unless He is aware of the realities of beings, will not
> comprehend the essential connection which proceeds from the realities of things, and He will
> certainly not be able to establish a religion conformable to the facts and suited to the conditions.
> The Prophets of God, the supreme Manifestations, are like skilled physicians, and the contin-
> gent world is like the body of man...” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Some Answered Questions, p. 158]. (empha-
> sis added)

\[60\] The Perfect Man

> “Religion, then, is the necessary connection which emanates from the reality of things; and as
> the supreme Manifestations of God are aware of the mysteries of beings, therefore, They under-
> stand this essential connection and by this knowledge establish the Law of God.” [ibid, 159].
One of the most striking analogies is between the Bahá’í teaching about the role of a Manifestation
in bringing humans to the knowledge of God and the Sufi doctrine concerning the sim il ar role of a
Prophet:

> “Know that reunion with God, the Exalted, is not possible except by following the Prophets and
> [God’s] chosen Ones, peace be upon them.... There is no way for him (man) to [attain unto] the
> knowledge of the True [God] but that he would contemplate the creation (lit.: creations) and
> become assured by it of its Creator, who is the True [God], may He be glorified and His domin-
> ion be ever exalted ! And [man will become assured of] His uniqueness          and self-subsistence,
> His knowledge and His might. [Man] will not learn beyond this measure from His attributes,
> [defined by] analogy                  , while from the attributes related to His holiness he will
> know [only] that He is not corporeal, not temporal, not spatial. All this is nothing other than

> no other way than by His informing [His creation] about His Essence, His attributes and names
> or through His revelation to His servants                 and His testimony to them about Himself.
> Exalted is He, Who is the true Master, above [all, in] that the religious law should be revealed
> [not] to everybody, and that it should be communicated [not] except in succession (lit.: one after
> another) by them who are the Prophets and His chosen Ones.... These are the choicest of the
> inhabitants of [the realm of] being             . It is incumbent upon the seeker of Truth to fol-
> low them and be guided by them. To the extent of his following the Prophets and His chosen
> Ones the rays of the divine light and God’s mysteries will be revealed to him....

> “Prophethood is God’s gift. There is no way to obtain it. A Prophet is sent from God, the
> Exalted, for the direction of the people                     and their guidance      . He is one, who
informs them of His (God’s) Essence, His attributes, His deeds and the recent commands

.... The Prophethood has an inner real i t y, which is Sa in ts h i p     . Thus, the
> Prophet draws by his Sa in tship the spiritual truths, correspondi ng to the degree of his per-

99–100]. (emphasis added)

> [ibid, 147–148]. (emphasis added)

“...His Essence is above all comprehension” [ibid, 148].

> “This is why it is said: ‘All that you have distinguished through the illusion of your imagination
> in your subtle mental images is but a creation like unto yourself, and returns to you’.... It is clear

(emphasis added)

> “God sent His Prophets into the world to teach and enlighten man, to explain to him the mys-

> Writings have been given by God as guides into the paths of Divine virtue, love, justice and
> peace” [Paris Talks, 57]. (emphasis added)
These passages speak for themselves, highlighting the similarities between the Bahá’í teaching on the
role of a Manifestation in bringing to humankind knowledge about God, incomprehensible in His hid-
den Essence, and the Sufi view on the same role of a Prophet. His role in the spiritual education of man
is also described in very similar terms:

\[62\] The Perfect Man

> “In like manner, the Holy Manifestations of God are the centers of the light of reality, of the
> source of mysteries, and of the bounties of love. They are resplendent in the world of hearts and
> thoughts, and shower eternal graces upon the world of spirits; They give spiritual life and are
> shining with the light of realities and mean in gs. The enlightenment of the world of thought
> comes from these centers of light and sources of mysteries. Without the bounty of the splendor
> and the instructions of these Holy Beings the world of souls and thoughts would be opaque dark-
> ness. Without the irrefutable teachings of those sources of mysteries the human world would
> become the pasture of an im al appetites and qualities, the existence of everything would be
> unreal, and there would be no true life” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Some Answered Questions, p. 162].

> “But for the ord in ances of the religious Law, which come down from the Divine Presence, encom-
> passing the good of the both worlds, the actions of each one of them (people), when seized by
> lust, would [consist in] the desire to oppress his brother, and in claiming what is forbidden for
> the gratification of their basest instincts. Order would never prevail in this world and the next....
T h e refore God, the Exalted, chooses in His wis dom an gels, that these may be med i ators

between Him and the elect from among the most excellent [people]                       .

> They (angels) inspire these with the God breathed [word], so that they may be Messengers unto
> the high and low” [‘Alá-al-Dawla Simnání.               – Al-Tirmizí, Khatm... (Appendix), p. 489].
The Bahá’í teaching about Divine Manifestations includes the notion of cycles:

> “Each of the Divine Manifestations has likewise a cycle, and during the cycle His laws and com-
> mandments prevail and are performed. When His cycle is completed by the appearance of a new
> Manifestation, a new cycle begins. In this way cycles begin, end and are renewed, until a uni-
> versal cycle is completed in the world, when important events and great occurrences will take
> place which entirely efface every trace and every record of the past; then a new universal cycle
> begins in the world, for this universe has no beginn in g...Briefly, we say a universal cycle in the
> world of existence signifies a long duration of time, and innumerable and incalculable periods
> and epochs. In such a cycle the Manifestations appear with splendor in the realm of the visible
> until a great and supreme Manifestation makes the world the center of His radiance. His appear-
> ance causes the world to attain to maturity, and the extension of His cycle is very great.
> Afterward, other Manifestations will arise under His shadow, Who according to the needs of the
> time will renew certain commandments relating to material questions and affairs, while remain-
> ing under His shadow” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Some Answered Questions, p. 160–161].
A sim il ar idea is expressed in the Sufi writings:

> “For the Prophets...are the manifestations of God’s Essence from the standpoint of Its Lordship
over the manifest beings and Its Justice among them (

). Consequently, the Prophethood refers exclusively to the outer. All of them (Prophets)
> participate in summoning, guiding and governing the people, and in the other things, which of
> necessity are related to Prophethood. Each one of them differs from another in degree: [Prophets]
> of an entire extent of powers              , like the independent Messengers..., and those with a
> limited extent, like the prophets of the people of Israel.... Thus, the Prophethood of a full
cycle consists of cycles, which are separate and different in magnitude (

). You have already learnt that the outer does not obtain assis-
> tance, strength, might, the power to govern, knowledge and eve ry t h in g, which proceeds out of
> the Truth, Who is the Exalted, except by the inner. This is the station of a chosen One           ”
> [Qaysarí.                    — Al-Tirmizí, Khatm... (Appendix), p. 490–491].
That the Manifestations of God differ in degree is also part of the Bahá’í teaching:

> “Know that the attributes of perfection, the splendor of the divine bounties, and the lights of
> inspiration are visible and evident in all the Holy Manifestations; but the glorious Word of God,
> C hr ist, and the Greatest Name, Bahá’u’lláh, are manifestations and evidences which are beyond

> imagination, for They possess all the perfections of the former Manifestations; and more than
> that, They possess some perfections which make the other Manifestations dependent upon
> Them” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Some Answered Questions, p. 149–150].
Until now we have been focusing mostly on the parallels between the Bahá’í religion and Sufism. Now
it is time to consider the most essential differences between them. As has been already pointed out,
unlike the Bahá’í teaching, according to which the Divine Will is manifested solely through the Prophets
founders of religions, called the Manifestations of God, the Mu˙ammadan Essence—the Sufi analogue
of the Divine Will can, according to the Sufi thinkers, be manifested through channels, other than the
Prophets, namely classed under the category of the “Chosen” or “Sa in ts.” Let us consider this aspect more
closely. The Manifestations of God as they are described in Bahá’í Writings, are a special category of
created Beings.

> “Briefly, The Holy Manifestations have ever been, and ever will be, Luminous Realities; no
> change or variation takes place in Their essence. Before declaring Their manifestation, They are
> silent and quiet like a sleeper, and after Their manifestation, They speak and are illum in ated,
> like one who is awake” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Some Answered Questions, p. 85–86].

> “The dawning-place of these splendors, the place of these reflections, and the appearance of
> these manifestations are the Holy Dawning-places, the Universal Realities and the Div in e
> Beings, Who are the true mirrors of the sanctified Essence of God” [ibid, 147].

> “Know that the Holy Manifestations, though They have the degrees of endless perfections, yet,
> speaking generally, have only three stations. The first station is the physical; the second station
> is the human, which is that of the rational soul; the third is that of the divine appearance and
> the heavenly splendor.... The second is the station of the rational soul, which is the human real-
> ity. This also is phenomenal, and the Holy Manifestations share it with all mankind....
> Therefore, the reality of prophethood, which is the Word of God and the perfect state of man-
> ifestation, did not have any beginning and will not have any end; its rising is different from all
> others.... Then it is evident that the Manifestations possess three conditions: the physical con-
> dition, the condition of the rational soul, and the condition of the divine appearance and heav-
> enly splendor” [ibid, 151–152]. (emphasis added)

> “We said that the Manifestations have three planes. First, the physical reality, which depends
> upon the body; second, the individual reality, that is to say, the rational soul; third the div in e
> appearance, which is the divine perfections, the cause of the life of existence, of the education
> of souls, of the guidance of people, and of the enlightenment of the contingent world…. But the
> individual reality of the Manifestations of God is a holy reality, and for that reason it is sanc-
> tified and, in that which concerns its nature and quality, is distinguished from all other things.
> It is like the sun.... So other human realities are those souls who, like the moon, take light from
> the sun; but that Holy Reality is luminous in Himself... We have mentioned, that the Holy
> Manifestations have three planes. The physical condition, the individual reality, and the center
> of the appearance of perfection.... Other individuals have the physical plane, the plane of the
> rational soul—the spirit and the mind...” [ibid, 154, 155]. (emphasis added)

> “For these Holy Souls are pure from every sin and sanctified from faults.... These Holy Beings
> are lights, and light does not unite itself with darkness. They are life, and life and death are not
> confounded. They are for guidance, and guidance and error cannot be together. They are the
> essence of obedience, and obedience cannot exist with rebellion” [ibid, 170].

> “Ve r il y, from the beginning that Holy Reality...is conscious of the secret of existence, and from
> the age of childhood signs of greatness appear and visible in Him” [ibid, 155].

> “Know that infallibility is of two kinds: essential infallibility and acquired infallibility. In such
> manner there is essential knowledge and acquired knowledge.... Essential infallibility is peculiar

\[64\] The Perfect Man

> to the supreme Manifestation.... To epitom iz e: essential infallibility belongs especially to the
> supreme Manifestations, and acquired infallibility is granted to every holy soul.... Briefly, it is
> said that the ‘Dayspring of Revelation’ is the manifestation of these words, ‘He doeth whatso-
> ever He willeth’; this condition is peculiar to that Holy Being, and others have no share of this
> essential perfection...for the Manifestation arises with perfect wisdom...” [ibid, 171, 172, 173].10
Though the Sufis describe the “Prophethood” as a special gift from God, they do not attribute to the
Prophets a special category among the created beings, a category, which is distinct from that of humans,
and emphasize their human aspect:

> “Do not think that this is peculiar to the Prophets (Messengers). For the quintessence of all
> humans                   in [their] innate nature               is worthy of it                .... A
> Prophet is also a human—‘Say: I am only a mortal like you’ [Qur’án 18:110]. Everyone, for whom
> this way has opened, were he to be shown what is to the advantage of humanity as a whole and
> were he to summon [the people] to what he has been shown, this would be called a religious law,
> and himself—a Prophet, while his condition [will be called] ‘mu‘jiza’ (prophetic miracle). Were he
> not to apply himself to the exhortation of people, he would be called ‘a chosen One’, and his con-
> dition—‘karámát’ (miracles). It is not necessary, that to whomsoever this state has been revealed,
> should occupy himself with the admonition of the people. For it is within the power of God, the
> Exalted, not to occupy him with it, either because the religious law of the given time is still new
> and there is no need for new exhortations, or because the conditions are not suitable for an
> exhortation...” [Al-Ghazálí.11             . Lithography, p. 14].12

“Therefore God, the Exalted, chooses in His wisdom angels, that these may be mediators

between Him and the elect from among the most excellent [people                           .

> They (angels) inspire these with the God breathed [word], so that they may be Messengers unto

And every Prophet is an Apostle, and every Apostle is a Prophet” [‘Alá-al-Dawla Simnání.

· – Al-Tir m iz í, Khatm... (Appendix), p. 489].

“‘Perfect’ is a man, who has attained unto the level of perfecting [others] (

), who is perfect in the knowledge of the religious law        , the mystical Path

> tic’s) return to the basic starting point               and the real abode               , [where] with
> the eye of insight he contemplates the beginning and the return               and becomes perfect in
Saintship (as God’s chosen One) or Prophethood and Apostleship, or in all of these (

), and in the contemplation of the True [God], the Exalted, in

> so that these may contemplate the Truth through the prism (lit.: eye) of the plurality, [inherent
> in] the creation                         , as has been pointed out” [Ámulí.                     · – Al-
> Tirmizí, Khatm... (Appendix), p. 505].
It is worth noting, that ‘becoming perfect in the Prophethood’ is explicitly stated in the passage. The
latter demonstrates that for the illustrious Sufi thinkers (Ámulí here quotes the great Junayd Baghdádí)13
the Prophethood implied an act of attaining to a certain level of perfection, which suggests that this
perfection is not innate.

According to the Bahá’í teac h in g, the Manifestations of God/founders of religions, have always been
and will continue to be sent to humanity at a def in i te interval, which is about a thousand years:

> “...the Manifestations of His Beauty no beginning hath beheld, and they will continue to the
> ‘End that knoweth no end’” [Bahá’u’lláh. Kitáb-i-ˆqán, p. 167].

> “They that valiantly labour in quest of God’s will, when once they renounced all else but Him,
> will be so attached and wedded to that City that a moment’s separation from it would to them
> be unthinkable. They will hearken unto infallible proofs from the Hyacinth of that assembly, and
> receive the surest testimonies from the beauty of its Rose and the melody of its Nightingale.
> Once in about a thousand years shall this City be renewed and re-adorned...That city is non other
> than the Word of God revealed in every age and dispensation. In the days of Moses it was the
> Pentateuch; in the days of Jesus the Gospel; in the days of Mu˙ammad the Messenger of God
> the Our’án; in this day the Bayán; and in the dispensation of Him Whom God will make man-
> ifest His own Book—the Book unto which all the Books of former Dispensations must needs be
> referred, the Book which standeth amongst them all transcendent and supreme” [ibid, 198–200].

(emphasis added)
The Sufi view on this matter, which is no different from the traditional Moslem view, is based on the
concept of the Prophet Mu˙ammad being the “Seal of the Prophets,” which is understood as Mu˙ammad
being the last Prophet. This interpretation of the expression “Seal of the Prophets” originated in Islam
quite early. To consider it here is not our point. The founder of the Bahá’í Faith, Bahá’u’lláh, treats this
subject in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán. Suffice it to say that, according to the Sufi thinkers, after the Prophet
Mu˙ammad and the discontinuation of the cycle of Prophets, the Divine Command is expressed solely
through God’s chosen Ones (Sa in ts). These, called the “men of the hidden”              , govern the uni-
verse through an uninterrupted invisible hierarchy with the Pole (Quèb) or Ghauth at the top. It is unin-
terrupted, because whenever one of the men in the hierarchy departs from his position, his place is taken
by someone from the level below. This is believed to continue until the rise of the Mahdí, the com in g
of the Hour and the Day of Resurrection. The particular details related to that hierarchy vary from
author to author, but the general idea is the same. Let us consider some extracts from the texts, which
illustrate it.

> “With the termination of the Prophethood, which is—bringing the religious Law, and the con-
> clusion of its cycle and the appearance of the inner Saintship, the position of the Pole was alto-
> gether transferred to [God’s] chosen Ones          . Thus without interruption one of these is in
> this position (of the Pole) in order to guard this order and state of things.... The Sa in tship will
> be terminated with the manifestation of the ‘Seal of Saintship’, who is the One sealing the
> ‘absolute Saintship.’ Thus, when this cycle (Saintship) is also finished, the coming of the Hour
> will become necessary...” [Qaysarí.                   , p. 34].

> “‘The Seal of the Prophets’ is the One by whom God, the Exalted, sealed the Prophethood. He
> is none other than the One, namely—our Prophet.... Likewise is the ‘Seal of the Sa in ts’. He is the
> One by whom the welfare of this world and the next reaches its top perfection, and the order of
> the universe will be destroyed by His death. He is the Mahdí, promised [to appear] at the end of
> time” [Ámulí.                         , p. 384].

> “...God has sa in ts (awliyá) whom He has specially distinguished by His friendship and whom He
> has chosen to be the governors of His kingdom and has marked out to manifest His actions and
> has peculiarly favoured with diverse kinds of miracles (karámát) and has purged of natural cor-
> ruptions and has delivered from subjection to their lower soul and passions, so that all their
> thoughts are of Him and their intimacy is with Him alone. Such have been in past ages and are
> now, and shall be hereafter until the Day of Resurrection, because God has exalted this (Moslem)
> community above all others and has promised to preserve the religion of Mu˙ammad. Inasmuch
> as the traditional and intellectual proofs of this religion are to be found among the divines
> (‘ul am á), it follows that the visible proof is to be found among the sa in ts and the elect of God....
> God, then, has caused the prophetic evidence (burhán-i nabawí) to remain down to the present
> day, and has made the saints the means whereby it is manifested, in order that the signs of the

\[66\] The Perfect Man

> Truth, and the proof of Mu˙ammad’s veracity may continue to be closely seen. He has made the
> Sa in ts the governors of the universe; they have... become entirely devoted to His business, and
> have ceased to follow their sensual affections. Through the blessing of their advent the rain falls
> from heaven, and through the purity of their lives pl an ts spring up from the earth, and through
> the purity of their spiritual influence the Moslems gain victories over the unbelievers. Among

> Divine court there are three hundred called Akhyár, and forty called Abdal, and seven called
> Abrár, and four, called Awtád, and three, called Nuqabá, and one, called Quèb or Ghauth. All
> these know one another and cannot act save by mutual consent” [Hujwírí. Kashf al-Mahjúb, p.

212-214].14
The idea of the invisible hierarchy of sa in ts, governing the world, as well as that of this body of saints,
acting as a collective manifestation of God’s Command on earth, is not found in the Bahá’í Writings.
On the other hand, though this is not part of the Bahá’í teaching, it would be too strong to assume that
it goes altogether against the Bahá’í teac h in gs either. For, this hierarchy, according to the Sufi authors,
exists only till the appearance of the Mahdí, who is identified with the Pole (or Pole of Poles). Sufi writ-
ers also describe the Mahdí as the “Seal of the Sa in t”’(see above), Who terminates by His manifestation
the circle of Saintship. According to the Bahá’í teac h in g, the prophecies about the Mahdí were fulfilled
in the Báb. I do not know of any authoritative Bahá’í interpretation of this subject, but in my own opin-
ion, one way to interpret this from the Bahá’í standpoint, would be to assume that the Báb, Who is the
Mahdí and, therefore, in Sufi terminology, is the “Seal of the Saints,” sealed or ended by His manifesta-
tion the circle of Saintship.

In conclusion we will try to sum up the main sim il ar i ties and differences between the concept of the
“Perfect Man” (“Pole”) in Sufism and the Bahá’í notion of the Manifestation of God. The basic analogies
can be traced down to the followi ng ideas:

God’s Will/Command needs an expression. This Will/Command consists in the education and guid-
ance of humankind and the governing of the world upon spiritual principles. This Will/Command is
expressed through a person/persons, who act as representatives/vicegerents of God on earth. The world
is never left without divine guidance. These divine representatives on earth are both servants in relation
to God and Lords in relation to the world. Viewed from the standpoint of their essential unity they all
manifest the same Reality, but from the standpoint of their individuality each of them appears under a
certain name and is characterized by certain qualities. All the divine attributes are applicable to these
Representatives of God and they play a major role in bringing humanity to the knowledge of God.
The differences between the teachings can be summ ar iz ed as follows:

a) In the Bahá’í teaching these divine representatives, called the Manifestations of God (God’s Will),
are considered a special category of created beings, who are superior to humankind in the hierarchy of
creation and are endowed with innate perfection. While the Sufis lay strong emphasis on the human
aspect of the Prophets and God’s chosen Ones (see below), who, in their view, attain to the spiritual
level, which enables them to perfect others and promote their spiritual growth; b) in the Bahá’í teaching
the Manifestations of God are limited to the Prophets—founders of religions, who are sent down to
humanity at set intervals. In Sufism the Prophets are but a group within a broader class, called the Elect
of God or God’s chosen Ones (Sa in ts), all of whom (and not just the Prophets) serve as channels for the
manifestation of the Will of God (God’s Command); c) in the Bahá’í teaching the Manifestations of
God/the Prophets will forever continue to be sent down to humankind, while the Sufis hold the view
that their can be no Prophet after Mu˙ammad, Who completed the cycle of Prophethood, to be suc-
ceeded by the cycle of Saintship. From that point onward until the end of time the role of the channels
for the operation of the Divine Will passed from the Prophets to the Elect of God. These, acting with-
in the Mu˙ammadan Law and His dispensation, govern the world through an invisible hierarchy.
