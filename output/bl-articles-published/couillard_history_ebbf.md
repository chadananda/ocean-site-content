groups. After an extensive consul-
tation process, the EBBF governing
board announced in the fall of 2014
that the name of EBBF would change
to Ethical Business Building the Fu-
ture. It also removed the formal link
with the National Spiritual Assembly
of the Bahá’ís of France.

These changes could poten-
tially open up many more opportuni-
ties for EBBF. For example, it is now
officially global rather than solely
“European” in its orientation and or-
ganization. Likewise, although still
Bahá’í inspired, the word “Bahá’í” is
no longer in the name, a change that,
some believe, might remove barriers to
engaging in discourse with other busi-
ness organizations. It is my personal
feeling that as long as EBBF remains
loyal to its core principles, and the
same stimulating, dynamic, and caring
atmosphere continues to permeate all
its activities, it will continue to attract
new members and remain a sought-af-
ter contributor to the discourses of
society.
