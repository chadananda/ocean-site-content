Just such a refutation of my work on Babism has appeared in a recent
issue of Religion [15 (1985) : 29-49], in the shape of an article entitled

`Western Islamic Scholarship and Baha'i Origins' . Penned by two Baha'i

> have not carried out any independent original research on which to base
> their conclusion that my findings are invalid - not, in itself, an illegitimate
> undertaking, but one open to serious criticism . Third, I cannot escape the
> conclusion that the authors have taken advantage of the fact that very few
> non-Baha'i academics have any specialized knowledge of the field and that
> many readers may well be unable to recognize essentially fundamentalist
> arguments as such . It is unlikely that amateur fundamentalist critiques of

> journal, but that seems to be the equivalent of what has happened here,
> which is why I feel it to be imperative to look more closely at their argu-

> been rather forced by the appearance of such an article in a scholarly
> journal, making it necessary for me to engage in what has, at a certain
> level, to be a sort of apologetic for my work . Ordinary academic arguments
> on their own are obviously inadequate in such a situation, where other
> considerations lurk, possibly unseen and unsuspected by those unfamiliar
with the context, beneath the surface of the debate .

Perhaps I can best underline what seems to be happening here if I draw
> attention to the fact that neither of my critics is, in my view, academically
> qualified to engage in a discussion of what is, in effect, a very specialized
> research area . Afnan is a former professor of clinical bacteriology and infec-
> tious diseases who has made an amateur study of the history of his religion .
> He may well be quite well-versed in this field, but he has not, to my
> knowledge, contributed any serious work on the subject, and the few
> articles of his that I have seen have been written explicitly for Iranian
> Baha'i audiences . In particular, I doubt seriously if he has much under-
> standing of the methodology employed in academic work of this kind or
> whether he would be sympathetic to it . Hatcher is a professor of mathe-
> matics who has written some general material on Baha'ism and has, as far
> as I am aware, no knowledge of Persian and Arabic-certainly not the
> kind of knowledge necessary to a study of the notoriously difficult Babi
texts . He has carried out no original research on early Babi or Baha'i

Baha'i Fundamentalism   59

> history, nor is he apparently qualified to do so . Both authors are active
members of the Baha'i community .

I do not wish to appear churlish or to be pleading professional immunity

> may often be of real value to scholarship . Believers are often sensitive to
> things the outsider can never appreciate and may provide important correc-

> aware of the risks inherent in amateur scholarship when difficult texts and
> complex methodological considerations are involved, especially where those
> concerned are committed members of a religious group which perceives
> itself as threatened by what may appear to it as unsympathetic research .
> Indeed, I am perhaps less concerned about the amateur status of my critics
> than by the intellectual and ideological assumptions which inform their
> undertaking and dictate the terms of their debate . Since these assumptions
> may not be familiar to most readers, it is, I feel, crucial that they be made
clear before proceeding further .

Baha'ism has inherited from Islam a tradition of apologetic centred
> around the notion of defending the faith from both internal and external
> attack . Baha'i sensitivity to misrepresentation owes much to the attitudes
> and values of Shi%ism, out of which it emerged, where the notion of the
> misunderstood and maligned minority has dominated the group self-image
> from the sect's inception . Defence of the faith was made a religious duty for
> all believers by Baha'ism's founder, Mirza Husayn `Ali Baha' Allah (1817-
> 1892) : `It is incumbent upon all men . . . to refute the arguments of those
> that have attacked the Faith of God' .' It is a measure of the importance of
> this injunction in Baha'i life that it has been institutionalized in the modern
> period in the form of continental and national bodies for `protection', the
> purpose of which is to refute internal dissent and external attack . This is, of
> course, an entirely legitimate exercize for members of a small and often
> genuinely misrepresented religious community, particularly where intellec-
> tual attacks on it (as in Iran) have tended to be gross, dishonest and
> vitriolic, and where calculated misrepresentation has led and still leads to
> physical violence . Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out that, in common
> with many modern Muslims, Baha'is tend to be unfamiliar with and resis-
> tant to the assumptions and methods of contemporary western scholarship,
> to the extent that independent academic studies which contradict estab-
> lished dogma are often lumped together with religiously- or politically-
motivated polemic produced by non-academics .

This process goes back as far as the late nineteenth century, when the
> work of the British orientalist E . G . Browne provoked hostile comment from
Baha'i writers disturbed by his accounts of Babi and Baha'i history . These

60    D . MacEoin

> writers attempted, among other things, to demonstrate that the text of an
> important early Babi chronicle published by him was actually a forgery
> produced by a rival sect with his connivance . Browne's view that `the more
> the Baha'i doctrine spreads, especially outside Persia, and most of all in
> Europe and America, the more the true history and nature of the original
> Babi movement is obscured and distorted" has been echoed in one form or
> another by several later writers (some of whom have, admittedly, used the
> notion for polemical purposes) . The Baha'is, in their turn, have continued
> to reject Browne's interpretation of their methods of writing (or re-writing)
> history, and have refused to accept any substantial modifications to the
> version of Babi and Baha'i events supplied in a series of officially-approved
> publications and by now sanctioned as more or less irrefutable in content
> and interpretation . Although certain favourable elements in Browne's work
> have continued to be used by Baha'is (and his role in bringing the subject
> to the attention of western scholars praised), none of his less favourable
> criticisms have ever been accepted, even partially, by the movement . It
> would be an insult to the memory of a brilliant scholar to suggest that he
> made no valid criticisms in a subject he knew inside out, and one must
> regret the tardiness of the Baha'is in coming to terms with his views on
> many matters that affect them quite vitally . The response that met
> Browne's work a century ago continues to greet that of any modern scholar
> attempting to re-write Babi or Baha'i history on the basis of contemporary
> materials coupled with a non-hagiographic reading of events . The tendency
> is to describe alternative versions as `distortions' or `doubtful judgements'
> which have to be `corrected' by reference to a body of `facts' contained in
> the standard histories . Mutatis mutandis, I face today substantially the same
> problem E . G . Browne faced in his time, and often with respect to the same
issues .

There is more to the matter than this . While not, in principle, opposed to
> intellectualism or scholarship, and while, in many ways, seeking to en-
> courage the growth of studies on Babi and Baha'i subjects, the Baha'i
> authorities are eager to promote only a limited type of scholarship that
> accepts for its basic premise the underlying validity of divine revelation as
> expressed in the Baha'i scriptures . This approach has much in common
> with that of some modern Muslim educational theory that seeks to re-
> articulate academic disciplines to render them consonant with Quranic
> principles (as interpreted by generally conservative ulema) . Nor is it unlike
> certain Creationist and other Christian fundamentalist approaches, which
> attempt to align scientific, historical, or archaeological data with Biblical
revelation .

This attitude is made clear in the following statement issued by the
Research Department of the Baha'i World Centre in Haifa : `The principle

Baha i fundamentalism   61

> of the harmony of science and religion means not only that religious teach-
> ings should be studied with the light of reason and evidence as well as of
> faith and inspiration, but also that everything in this creation, all aspects of
> human life and knowledge, should be studied in the light of revelation as
> well as in that of purely rational investigation' .' Since revelation is, in the
> Baha'i system, infallible and unquestionable, it inevitably has the edge in
> any dispute with mere human reason . Later in the statement it is argued
> that `In scientific investigation when searching after the facts of any matter
> a Baha'i must, of course, be entirely open-minded, but in his interpretation
> of the facts and his evaluation of evidence we do not see by what logic he
> can ignore the truth of the Baha'i Revelation which he has already accepted' .

This approach may seem relatively innocuous, but in practice it often
> results in a hardening of attitudes against academics whose work has not
> been illumined by the `light of revelation', particularly, of course, where
> they are involved in research touching on Baha'ism itself . In a report from
> an Australian `Institute on Baha'i Scholarship' held in 1982, a contrast was
> drawn between `the Baha'i scholar, well-versed in the teachings, upholding
> the covenant, bound by its laws, guided by wisdom, and humbled by know-
> ledge of his responsibilities' on the one hand, and `the scholar of the 20th
> century, whose knowledge has fed his ambition, set him aloof from society,
> and allow [sic] him to do anything he could [sic] justify in the name of
intellectualism' on the other . 4

Within the Baha'i community itself, historical and doctrinal `accuracy' is
> preserved by keeping a very tight rein on the published writings of
> members . All the major national Baha'i bodies operate some form of
> reviewing procedure (usually by means of a committee set up for that
> purpose), and arrangements also exist for selected materials to be vetted at
> the Baha'i World Centre in Haifa . It is obligatory for any Baha'i, academic
> or other, to submit his work to the proper authorities for approval prior to
> publication, whether it is intended to issue the material in question as an
> official Baha'i text or not . There are no exceptions to this rule, which also,
> of course, demands that authors incorporate into their work any alterations
> or `corrections' that may be deemed necessary as conditions for publication .
> Failure to comply (either by non-submission or a refusal to make changes)
> may result in the imposition of sanctions and can, if an individual publishes
in a spirit of non-compliance, lead to excommunication .

Those responsible for carrying out the review of publishable material are
> not normally trained academics, but are usually drawn from the ranks of
> `knowledgeable' and experienced Baha'is deemed capable of ensuring that a
> given text conform to accepted standards in terms of both style and content .
> More than one Baha'i scholar has told me in private that they would prefer
not to publish some of their work rather than submit it to a body which

62    D . MacEoin

> they know will reject it or ask for radical alterations . By way of corollary, of
> course, one can have a high degree of confidence that anything published
> by Baha'i writers-including the present article by Afnan and Hatcher-
> will have been vetted and approved at some stage . Rather more worrying is
> the fact that even materials submitted by non-Baha'i writers to Baha'i
> publishing houses will still be subject to some form of official review, since
> the publishers themselves are bound by the rules laid down for this
purpose .

More disturbing to the academic is the application of this reviewing
> process to original historical materials . In 1982, for example, Kalimat Press
> of Los Angeles published a translation of the memoirs of Ustad

> Muhammad `Ali Salmani, originally written in the last part of the 19th
> century . Following publication, the central Baha'i authorities in Haifa
> stated that, even though the text had been reviewed for publication in
> America, had they themselves checked the manuscript, they `would not
> have given permission for its publication or translation' .' Prior to this,
> however, an ad hoc committee had already taken action `to eliminate the
> most harmful passages so that the publication of the book . . . could
> proceed' .' Nevertheless, not all the required deletions had, in fact, been
> made, and the Haifa authorities concluded that they would have to review
> all such documents themselves in future . 7 Such tampering with historical
> documents already seems to be common practice in Iran, where books
> sometimes contain statements to the effect that an editorial committee has
> introduced `corrections', even though no details of these are provided in the
> text . I even possess a second edition of a Persian book which originally
> contained two early historical memoirs, from which the second document
has been wholly removed without explanation .

All of this is, of course, directed towards the end of establishing a single
> `authentic' version of Baha'i history and belief . Such a version is not, of
> course, intended merely for internal consumption . In one of its letters refer-
> ring to the Salmani memoirs mentioned above, the Universal House of
> Justice states that `the principal task of the Baha'is at the present time-
> and especially of Baha'i scholars-is to present a true picture of the Faith to
> the general public . . .' . 8 It is, I think, in an attempt to carry out this task
> that Professors Afnan and Hatcher have set out, not only to `correct' my
> interpretation of certain aspects of Babi history, but to discredit my work as
> a whole and to represent it as a distortion of the `truth' . This seems to fit
> into a wider pattern : some two years ago, the national body of the Baha'is
> of the U .K . made an attempt to prevent publication of my contribution on
> Baha'ism to the Penguin Handbook of Living Religions . They had not actu-
> ally read my article, but objected in principle to my having written it and
recommended that the editor substitute for it an article by a Baha'i author .

Baha'i fundamentalism     63

Such attitudes have, of course, very deep roots, and some understanding
> of these may place the foregoing in clearer perspective . Baha'ism, like Islam
> and, in particular, the Shidi sect out of which it emerged, is built around a
> doctrine of what Roy Wallis has called `epistemological authoritarianism' . 9
> True, unimpaired knowledge is made available to men by God through
> infallible prophets or imams, whose word in all matters is final and
> absolute . In Baha'i terminology, this is expressed in the doctrine of `the
> Most Great Infallibility' possessed by the prophet or `Manifestation of
> God' . 10 This receives clear expression in the following passage by Baha'
> Allah : `Were He [the Manifestation] to pronounce water to be wine or
> heaven to be earth or light to be fire, He speaketh the truth and no doubt

> would there be about it; and unto no one is given the right to question His
> authority or to say why or wherefore' .' This claim to be in possession of
> infallible knowledge is coupled with a very strong anti-liberalism, as is clear
> from the following passage 12 :

> We find some men desiring liberty, and priding themselves therein . Such men
> are in the depths of ignorance . Liberty must, in the end, lead to sedition, whose
> flames none can quench . . . . Regard men as a flock of sheep that need a
> shepherd for their protection . . . . We approve of liberty in certain circum-
> stances, and refuse to sanction it in others . We, verily, are the All-Knowing .

Say : True liberty consisteth in men's submission unto My commandments . . .

Although the `Most Great Infallibility' was not deemed to have been
> transferred by Baha' Allah to his successors, 'Abd al-Baha' (1844-1921)
> and Shoghi Effendi Rabbani (1897-1957), each of the latter was regarded
> as infallible within his own sphere as interpreter of the sacred text and head
> of the faith . In popular estimation, this infallibility extended very far
> indeed . As Peter Smith, himself a Baha'i sociologist, has expressed it, `the
> essential claims of its [the Baha'i faith] central figures were definitely
> authoritarian' . 13 The Covenant system (again derived from a basic doctrine
> of Shicism), whereby all believers have to submit without reservation to the
> commands and interpretations of the appointed head of the faith, means
> that, even in the West, where a more liberal attitude prevails in many
> areas, the basic mood of the religion continues to be authoritarian . The
> following statements of `Abd al-Baha' convey this mood in very stark
> terms : `Firmness in the Covenant means obedience, so that no one may say
> this is my opinion . Nay, rather, he must obey what which proceeds from
> the pen and tongue of the Covenant' ; 14 `Not one soul has the right to say
> one word in his own account, or to explain anything or to elucidate the text
> of the Book whether in public or in private' .' 5 Smith has pointed out,
> indeed, that `the implicit tension between Baha'i liberalism and Baha'i
authoritarianism . . . remains a fundamental part of modern Baha'i life' . 16

This background is, I feel, absolutely essential to any intelligent reading
> of the article by Afnan and Hatcher and to any attempt at elucidating the
> motives underlying its composition . To the authors, truth is both manifest
> and simple, and any deviation from the conventional version of it must be
> seen as lamentable and in need of correction or suppression . That they feel
> it necessary to do this, not only over doctrinal matters, but also in respect
> to historical events reflects the central position of history in the Baha'i
> movement . From the beginning, Baha'i leaders, including Baha' Allah,
> `Abd al-Baha' and Shoghi Effendi, the movement's three `central figures',
> have either written or given their sanction to histories of the religion and its
> antecedents . In the modern period, two works-both of them extensively

> used and quoted by Afnan and Hatcher in their article-have come to have
> the status of more or less infallible sources for Baha'i history : Shoghi
> Effendi's God Passes By (1944) and his edited translation of part of a history
> by Mulla Muhammad Nabil Zarandi, known as 'Nabil's Narrative' or by
> the title The Dawn-Breakers (1932) . The significance of these works in
> modern Baha'i consciousness cannot be over-emphasized . They provide an
> absolute standard, as it were, by which all other versions of the same events
> are to be judged and remain for the mass of believers the unquestioned
> sources of authentic historical knowledge . Where Afnan and Hatcher have
> tried to `correct' my version of Babi history, it has usually been on the basis
of one or other of these works .

Beginning with E . G . Browne, a number of scholars, not all of them
> inherently hostile to Baha'ism, have advanced or supported the thesis that
> Baha'i historical works reveal a strong tendency to bowdlerize and re-write
> the events of Babi history in a manner conformable to later Baha'i attitudes
> and expectations ." More recent original research using contemporary
> documentation has in large measure confirmed this by producing versions
> of Babism often seriously at variance with that available in the standard
> Baha'i accounts .' $ Whether or not it is comfortable or convenient for those
> committed to an ideologically formulated historicist narrative, Babi/Baha'i
> history is, by its very nature, controversial, and the mere assertion of
> doctrinal convictions will not, in the long run, cause it to be any less so . It
> is particularly important in the context of the present debate to make clear
> what Afnan and Hatcher have allowed to remain hidden, that my work on
> Babism and Baha'ism is not that of a maverick scholar pursuing his own
> pet theories to absurd conclusions but is, rather, the latest phase in a long
> tradition of scholarship on the subject that has its roots in the findings of
> Browne in the last century . I cannot escape the feeling that I am being
> criticized for doing what most academic historians of religion set out to do,
> namely to confront and subject to critical analysis the most controversial
aspects of the field in which they are engaged . Historical research that

Baha i fundamentalism   65

> ignores controversy is likely to be stale and boring, and ultimately of very
restricted usefulness .

Having already spent much time examining the intellectual and ideo-
> logical background to their article, let me now look briefly at some of the
> points raised by Afnan and Hatcher concerning my work . Let me begin by
> saying that it is regrettable that the authors, possibly because of the timing
> of their rejoinder, did not refer to my subsequent article `From Babism to
> Baha'ism: problems of militancy, quietism and conflation in the construc-
> tion of a religion' [Religion (1983) 13 : 219-255], which serves as a sequel to
> the article under discussion, and which provides a detailed discussion of the
> ways in which Baha'ism sought to come to terms with its Bibi origins

> (which in the Afnan/Hatcher article have become `Baha'i origins') . Since I
> cannot reiterate here the bulk of the arguments set out in my article, I must
> instead urge readers to turn to it as, in itself, an amplified explanation of
> the religious considerations that have made a rebuttal such as that of Afnan
> and Hatcher necessary in the first place . Many of the points raised by them
are, in fact, dealt with at length there and need not be gone over again .

Let me first deal with one or two general and rather gratuitous issues
> raised in the introduction to their article . At the very outset, the authors
> refer to an early article of mine entitled `Oriental scholarship and the
> Baha'i Faith' [World Order 8 :4 (1974), pp . 9-21], and on the next page
> state that `the cogency of the perspective on Baha'i scholarship contained in
> MacEoin's 1974 article certainly raised expectations that his future work
> would be of comparable quality . Unhappily, such expectations have not
> been fulfilled by his recent publications' . Well, that is obviously an opinion
> to which they are entitled, but I would argue that it speaks volumes about
> the standards by which they wish to weigh academic writing . When that
> article appeared, I was aged about 25 and just completing my second
> undergraduate degree, in Persian and Arabic . I had carried out no original
> research into Bibi or Baha'i history or doctrine, my knowledge of even
> secondary materials on the subject was as yet extremely limited, and my
> familiarity with the methodology of religio-historical studies was, to say the
least, rudimentary . I would today regard that article as an embarrassment,

not because it is a piece of juvenilia (of which we must all be guilty at some
stage), but because it is in no sense of the word a serious, researched work

> of academic scholarship . Why then should Afnan and Hatcher think so
> highly of it and so poorly of my more recent work? Could it possibly be
> because I was then a young and enthusiastic Baha'i, that I advanced in
> that article a whiter-than-white expression of the orthodox Baha'i position,
> and that I subsequently left the movement and developed a critique of it
based on wholly external criteria?

It strikes me as unusually interesting that the authors should go on to

> drag in a reference to my article on 'Abd al-Baha' in the Encyclopaedia
> Iranica . Since that article touches in no way at all on the present subject, I
> am at a loss to see what possible relevance it can have to the discussion,
> unless-as I suspect is the case-it has been mentioned (and dismissed
> rather imperiously as having been `thoroughly refuted') merely in order to
> raise further doubts as to my competence . By saying, for example, that I
> show `a rather surprising ignorance of important segments of the basic
> literature of the Bahai Faith', the authors obviously seek to undermine my
> credibility in the eyes of the reader, even though the present discussion
> deals, not with Baha'i, but with Babi literature . It is, in any case, a rather
> uncertain argument . The writer of the article in Andalib referred to by the

> authors may have proved to his own satisfaction and that of a Baha'i
> readership that the basic dogma involved has remained immune to my
> criticism, but I am not sure that others will be so easily convinced . No
> doubt it is possible to interpret certain selected passages from the works of
> Baha' Allah in such a way as to make them the `sources' for many of `Abd
> al-Baha's later teachings, but to do so is a theological, not an empirical
> academic enterprise . The main point seems to be to convey a sense of my
> ignorance of basic material . That in itself does little more than reflect the
> amateur character of the authors' approach : if someone has failed to see
> what is evident to the eye of faith, then the only explanation must be
> ignorance . Since I am, in reality, very far from ignorant of Baha' Allah's
> original writings, both published and manuscript," I would argue that my
> interpretation of the situation is based on a neutral reading of the texts and
> that these themselves reveal a picture somewhat at variance from the
> established dogma . Since the argument to ignorance is realistically
> untenable (or at best very risky), I would recommend that those who wish
> to criticize my work on this score concentrate instead on different ex-
> planations for my conclusions : that I have, for instance, failed to under-
> stand the `real' meaning of certain texts, or that I have deliberately avoided
certain references .

Before leaving the introduction, let me look briefly at two other points
> raised by it . Referring to the period 1920-1970, the authors speak of the
> appearance of `highly significant additions to the literature of the Baha'i
> Faith' and make special mention of Zarandi's narrative of `the early days of
> the Babi Faith [sic]', 20 which they deem to be important because it is based
> on numerous eye-witness accounts . Zarandi's narrative is a crucial text for
> Afnan and Hatcher, who refer to it as `the basic source' and cite it at least
eight times, sometimes at crucial points in their argument .

What they do not point out is that Zarandi's history occupies a central
> place in the development of Baha'i historiography precisely because `parts
of the manuscript were reviewed and approved, some by Baha'u'llah, and

Baha'i fundamentalism   67

> others by `Abdu'l-Baha', 21 while the English edition was both edited and
> translated by Shoghi Effendi-an unparelleled combination of infallible
> approval . In consequence, The Dawn-Breakers is accorded a status within
> the Baha'i community that renders it all but infallible itself and makes it an
> extremely difficult book to contradict within Baha'i circles . Shoghi Effendi
> described it as an `unchallengeable textbook' 22 and referred to `its varied
> rich and authentic material' ' 23 while his widow, Ruhiyyih Rabbani, speaks
> of the book's `historical interest and validity' . 24 Yet another Baha'i writer
> describes Zarandi's narrative as the `authentic history of the early days of
> the Faith' . 25 But clearest of all, I think, is the following statement by
> George Townshend, a much-respected Irish Baha'i writer whom Afnan and

> Hatcher quote in their article : `Amid the great and ever-growing library of
> works on the Bab, the Chronicle of Nabil's holds a most conspicuous place

To anyone who has read my article `From Babism to Baha'ism', the

> (and one `Baha'i movement'), together with references to `Baha'i litera-

revealing .

The inevitable context of such a perspective is, once again, dogmatic
> rather than empirical, in keeping with the following statement made on

revelation as one complete whole embracing the Faith of the Bab should

> that of Baha'u'llah .' 32 Here again, the authors have uncovered the under-

> revelation', the values and doctrines of which must be read back into the

The first complete section of the paper by Afnan and Hatcher ('A new
> key to Baha'i [sic] history?') is taken up with a discussion of my use of the
> jihad concept as a means towards understanding Babi attitudes and
> responses . In it, they uncover what they describe as `a basic inconsistency
> which is fundamental to MacEoin's presentation of his thesis', arguing that,
> since I reject the notions of political motivation and defensive action in
> favour of an explanation centred around jihad, I might be expected `to
> present the Babis as having engaged in an offensive military action justified
> by appropriate religious doctrines and motives', something which I do not
> do . They then ask `how indeed can the notion of holy war be the key to
> understanding the Babi-Muslim confrontations if in no instance it was in-
volved in precipitating the conflicts?'

May I draw to the authors' attention a statement in the second para-
> graph of my article, in which I make it perfectly clear that its purpose was
> `to clarify the background to the Babi-state clashes in the form of a discus-
> sion of the theory of holy war as presented in early Babi writings and to

> carried out according to the ideal prescriptions for jihad given in Babi
> writing prior to that date, but that many of the attitudes expressed by those
> involved in the struggles owed much to the ideal theory and that some form

ideal or to use it as a context (even a negative context) within which to set

historical events .

Let me reiterate what seems to have happened in the first six years or so
> of Babi history . The Babis, inspired by the Bab's writings, wanted to fight a
> holy war against the unbelievers, initially to prepare the way for the coming
> of the imam, later to establish the Babi theocracy envisaged in later works

> purpose and, contrary to normal practice for clerics (who formed a large
> percentage of the sect's membership), carried such weapons on their
> persons, often in situations in which this would have been regarded as
> provocative . In the end, however, a variety of factors, most of them outside
> their control, prevented them from launching a full-scale holy war along the

> lines of the earlier Wahhabi jihad in Arabia or the later Mahdist uprising in
Sudan .

The lack of a central organization, fewness of numbers, the imprisonment
> of the Bab from an early date, the provincialized character of the second-
> rank Babi leadership (as in Zanjan and Nayriz), and the absence of
> politically-influential converts after the death of Manuchihr Khan, the

Yazd .

The first of the Babi-State struggles (that at Shaykh Tabarsi) followed

To clarify one or two small points : I am unsure what the writers mean
> when they say I am `highly selective' in the material I quote from the Bab .
Perhaps they would rather I had not referred at all to those passages which

To be honest, I cannot help but feel that many of Afnan and Hatcher's
comments are themselves based either on considerable ignorance of the

> repeatedly, time and again, by thy pen of the Bib in the Qayyum al-asma',
> and there is hardly a sura in this blessed book which does not contain this
> decree' . 33 The point is, of course, perfectly obvious to anyone who has
actually read the book .

Here, as elsewhere, Afnan and Hatcher are trying to convey the im-

> necks, the burning of books and papers, the destruction of shrines, and the
universal slaughter of all save those who believed and were faithful' . 35

The second part of the article by Afnan and Hatcher deals with `the
Nature of the Bab's Claims' and seeks to criticize my breakdown of the

In several passages of his Kitdb-i panj sha'n, the Bab himself states that

The account given of the inception of Babism, while correct in its broad

The next, brief section entitled 'Jihdd and the writings of the Bab'

> contains some of the most tendentious arguments in the paper . Referring to
> the fact that the Bab commanded adherence to Quranic law during the first
> four years of his career, they quote a passage from my article indicating
> that the laws of jihad contained in the Qayyum al-asmd' are basically
> Quranic in origin, after which they go on to draw the following remarkable
> conclusion : `Thus, the passages of the Qayyumu'l-Asmd' referring to jihad
> do not constitute a Babi doctrine of jihdd but simply a restatement in
almost identical terms of the Qur'anic doctrine' .

I scarcely know what to say about this . The authors clearly seem to want
> to have several cakes and eat them . They have already implied that there is
> no doctrine of jihad in the Qayyum al-asma' at all, now they suggest that the
passages referring to jihdd exist but do not constitute `a Babi doctrine of

> jihad . If I state that the Bab made limited claims at the outset of his career
> and that his movement in that period was `an expression of extreme Islamic
> pietism', they rap my knuckles for failing to see that the Bab really was an
> independent `Manifestation of God' right from the beginning . But if, on the
> other hand, it seems inconvenient to admit that the earliest writings of this
> independent Manifestation present his personal doctrine in any form, they
> prefer to fall back on the argument that the teachings contained in them are
> really Islamic and not Babi at all . The point is, of course, that, once we
> accept that Babism in some shape or form began in 1844 (as Afnan and
> Hatcher have themselves stated), we are obliged to treat all material after
> that date as representative of Babi teaching, whether it is simply reiteration

of Islamic norms or modifications of them or outright innovation .

As for the later statement that `by making jihad conditional on his
> approval (as the Bab did), he effectively abrogated the waging of jihad, but
> without explicitly denying the Qur'anic doctrine of holy war'-I find myself
> almost speechless . This is fatuous to an extreme degree, particularly to

> absence of the twelfth imam, whose approval is necessary for it to be waged
> (see `Concept' p . 98) . Does this mean that jihad was regarded as
> `abrogated' by Shi i Muslims? Since offensive jihad cannot, in any case, be
> declared without a reasonable chance of success (and element of Islamic
> law of which Afnan and Hatcher appear to be ignorant-see their article,
> p . 33), the fact that it was not launched during the early Babi period is of
> no real significance . The whole thing becomes quite absurd, in fact, if we
> take at its face value their own later statement (p . 39) to the effect that
> `Baha'u'llah abrogated the law of jihad (which is historically perfectly
> correct-see my article `From Babism') . Might one ask why, if the Bab
> had already done so, Baha' Allah should have found it necessary to
> abrogate jihad (and in doing so make the point that he was the first prophet
to take that step)?

After this, the authors state that, since jihad is only legitimate against
> non-Muslims, the references in the Qayyum al-asmd' `could not have been
> taken or understood by the Bab's followers as legitimizing a holy war
> against their fellow Muslims' . The authors really are getting themselves
> into knots here, for, after having gone to so much trouble to demonstrate

> now speak of non-Babis as `fellow Muslims' . Actually, this argument has

Shi`i doctrine applied the term [dissenters] to all those who opposed the

Bahd ifundamentalism    77

> twelve imams-in other words, to all non-Twelver Muslims . The duty to

> further examined with respect to the Babi position in later sections of my

> and conclude that he `by no means restricted the terms kafir and mushrik to
> atheists or polytheists, but applied them to Muslims, whether Sunni or

regarded as subject to the decree of holy war' .

Finally, to argue that `since Baha'u'llah abrogated the law of jihad, we

I do not propose to look in any detail at the next section, which deals
with the uprisings at Shaykh Tabarsi, Nayriz, and Zanjan. It will suffice to

> point out that the sources used by the authors are all later Baha'i ones,
> namely Zarandi, Shoghi Effendi and Balyuzi . Merely asserting the plati-
> tudes of contemporary Baha'i doctrine is no way to proceed in a complex
> historical argument . If the authors wish to disprove what they call my
> `charges' against the Babis,4 7 will they please deal in detail with the specific
> instances I cite, providing, if they can, textual evidence from the same
> period which will prove that my interpretations (and my sources) are false?
> Sweeping generalizations based on late tendentious materials are no sub-
> stitute for original research . That the Babis were militant, that they had
> political aspirations (and did not distinguish these from their religious aims
> any more than Muslims or modern Baha'is do), and that they believed that
> the Qajar state had delegitimized itself by its treatment of the BA are all

> verifiable assertions based on clear textual evidence, presented in my article
> and elsewhere, and it would be futile to carry the discussion further until
> my critics prove at least willing to examine and treat seriously the material
> in question . What might also help would be a very large dose of empathy
> for the Babis themselves, whose ideals and aspirations have been lost sight
> of beneath a haze of modern Baha'i pious rhetoric and historical recon-
struction .

Before I finish, let me reply briefly to one or two points made by the
> authors in their notes . In number 48, they refer to my `gratuitous assertion
> that the future Manifestation was expected "at a distant date", contrary to
> the clear indications in the Bab's writings that the advent of this Mani-

> festation was imminent' . It has to be made clear that it is Baha'i inter-
> pretation of the Bab's writings that makes the date of the appearance of
> `him whom God shall manifest' `imminent', and not necessarily the texts
> themselves . Anyone with a knowledge of late Babism knows that this has
> been a much debated question, carried on basically between the Baha'is on
> the one hand and everyone else on the other . I discuss the issue at some
> length in a forthcoming article entitled `Charismatic authority in middle
> Babism' . Here, the main point I wish to get across is that my statement is
> not `gratuitous', but based on a widely-accepted reading of well-known
texts mixed with a little common sense .

I feel I cannot let go unremarked the comment in note 53 to the effect
> that 'MacEoin quotes from book V, chapter 5 of the Bayan which states,
> among other things, that the kings and leaders of the earth should not wait
> for people to enter the Faith of the Bab spontaneously, but should actively
> teach the Faith to others and lead them to belief in it' . This, they say, `is
> not just a "very different" form of jihad; it is not jihad at all', and they
> argue that I here betray how difficult the defence of my central thesis has
become .

Unfortuantely, I did not write what they seem to imply I did, namely
> that Babi kings were to `teach the Faith' (which is, in any case, a purely
> Baha'i phrase) . I quoted the Bayan to the effect that `the possessors of
> power [i .e . kings] must not wait for something to descend from heaven in
> order to bring all that are on earth into the faith of God, but it should be as
> all entered the faith in Islam . . . .' Perhaps it would have helped had I also
> quoted an earlier passage from the same section of the Bayan (5 :5, p . 157),
> which reads : `If, for example, at the beginning of Islam a country was
> conquered by force and violence, (its people) would enter Islam and attain
> to the fruit of faith' . In case the authors have not read it in full, the chapter
> from which these two quotations are taken deals with `the decree con-
> cerning the seizure of the property of those who do not believe in the
Bayan' : Should the point still be unclear, perhaps they would care to read

Bahd i fundamentalism   79

> the opening words of the next chapter of the book (5 :5, p . 159) : `If God, the
> Knowing, should grant the believers the favour of conquering a land which
> has not accepted the faith (islam), anything (in it) which is unique shall
> belong to the Point of the Bayan [i .e . the Bab]' . I remain to be persuaded
> that any of this means the polite `teaching of the Faith' suggested by Afnan
and Hatcher .

Finally, I must respond to note 61, where I am quoted as stating that the
> Babis showed `great brutality not only to the hostile soldiers but to civilians
> in the region as well' . The authors go on to say that `this undocumented
> and unsupported accusation by MacEoin is particularly gratuitous and
> unscholarly . There are in fact a number of such summary, unsupported

> judgements throughout the paper' . May I reply that their criticism is at this
> point both unfair and inaccurate . Babi brutality, particularly at Shaykh
> Tabarsi, is well documented, as the following selected instances taken from
Babi sources will demonstrate .

The Nuqtat al-kaf admits that, when en route to Barfurush, the Babis in
> the company of Mulla Husayn Bushru'i killed a dervish and his small child
> for having misdirected them . 48 In the course of an early attack on the
> besieging army at Shaykh Tabarsi, a group of Babis killed 130 soldiers and
> villagers, destroyed the village near which the military had erected its
> defences, and seized two years' worth of provisions from the inhabitants . 49
> In a later attack on the army camp at Vaskas, two princes took refuge in an
> upper room, whereupon the Babi attackers set fire to the house, burning
> them to death, after which a group of Mazandarani Babis looted the
> village ." On a later occasion, the Babi defenders of the fort were instructed
> by Barfurushi to sever the heads of their enemies from their bodies and to
erect the grisly relics on poles around the walls ." Describing one of the

> Babi attacks on the village of Vaskas, Lutf `Ali Mirza Shirazi (himself one
> of the defenders of the fort), speaks of the extreme hard-heartedness of his
> co-religionists, who killed anyone they came across, including a man and a
> woman in a village before Vaskas, by mistake . 52 Zarandi speaks of a similar
> mistake ." During the Zanjan upheaval, a Bibi renegade named Farrukh
> Khan was killed (along with 22 other prisoners) by being skinned alive and
then roasted . 54

There is no need to labour the point . Rather than accuse me of gratu-
> itousness and unscholarly methods, Afnan and Hatcher would do very well
> to read the available sources and ask themselves whether this is not really a
> case of the pot calling the kettle black . Having carried out no original
> research of their own, they seek to undermine my work for reasons that
> seem to be entirely partisan and polemical . They are, of course, welcome to
> make such criticisms, but they must realize that the proper place for them
> is in the pages of the sectarian journals published and vetted by their own

> organization, not in academic publications designed to foster open and
> balanced discussion of religious history according to the standards of
scholarly debate as normally understood .

More than once in the past century, scholars have had occasion to speak
> of the intellectual dishonesty of the Baha'is in dealing with matters of
> historical fact . Unhappily, it has fallen to my lot to reiterate the sentiments
> of my predecessors and to deplore, as they deplored, the high-handed and
> tendentious manner in which texts are manipulated, facts swept aside or
> transformed, and common sense outraged by the exponents of a religion
> that prides itself-justly in many other respects-on its respect for human
> reason and its freedom from prejudice . May I, therefore, plead that this

> present clash of opinions, acrimonious as it has by its nature been, may at
> least serve to alert those among the Baha'i community who have the sense
> and the intelligence to recognize the problems generated by the hitherto
> dominant fundamentalist element in their ranks to the dangers of leaving
> such debates in their hands . I would ask such individuals, whether or not
> they be academics themselves, to encourage future Baha'i scholars to treat
> seriously and with due respect for academic standards any further work
> carried out on aspects of their history by myself or others . The alternative
> will be to dissuade anyone with sense from engaging in Babi or Baha'i
> studies, to the permanent detriment of a rich and important field of
religious and historical research .

Most of all, perhaps, those of a fundamentalist persuasion among the
> Baha'i rank.;, would do well to ask themselves whether they are not unwit-
> tingly doing more harm than good to the cause they seek to represent .
> There are in existence, in Britain and the United States, a number of
> Baha'i scholars, sociologists and historians among them, whose work is of a
> very high standard and on whose efforts any possibility of a meaningful
> dialogue with non-Baha'i academics will largely rest . It cannot be anything
> but an embarrassment for such individuals to have their less qualified co-
> religionists complicating an already difficult area of study by seeking to
> keep arguments at an apologetic level . Baha'i scholars have problems, not
> the least of which is the onerous obligation to submit their work for review,
> but they are making sincere and often very successful attempts to transform
> the image of Baha'i scholarship to one consonant with rigorous standards
> and academically tested methodology . I hope that those who are not pre-
> pared to follow them in adopting such a course will at least have the grace
> to recognize that the introduction of apologetics into scholarly debate is at
> best a distraction and at worst a means of wrecking the foundations on
which future studies involving both Baha'is and non-Baha'is may be based .
