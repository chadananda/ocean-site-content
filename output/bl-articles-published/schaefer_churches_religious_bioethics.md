Bahá’í

The Bahá’í Faith is the youngest of the revealed religions. It is described by
scholars as a “post-Islamic world religion, or as a “new world religion”. This
religion, which was founded in the 19th century and arose out of the Islamic
cultural background, is a religion in the tradition of the Abrahamic prophetic
religions. Its herald, the Báb (1819-1850) announced the central figure,
Bahá’u’lláh (1817-1892). In him the Bahá’ís see the eschatological turning
point in history: The Adamic cycle in which the great religions arose is ended,
the day of “Resurrection” is come, a new cycle has started. In Bahá’u’lláh the
Bahá’ís see the promises of the world religions concerning the coming of a
world renewer at the end of time fulfilled.

The central theme of the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is the idea of unity, which is
met with at three levels: in the unity of God, in the mystical unity of the
religions and in the unity of humankind. The theological pivot of the Bahá’í
teachings is the new paradig m in the history of salvation, “progressive
revelation”: God reveals himself to men in accordance with their power of
understanding. The great religions are thus not mere participations in truth
but divine foundations. Their holy books are testimonies of truth, ultimately
they all come from the same source.

The Bahá’í Faith is the most widespread religion geographically after
Christianity. The approximately 6-7 million believers live – apart from the
country of its origin, Iran – mostly in the Third World. In Austria the Bahá’ís
have been a state-incorporated religious community in accordance with
BekGG since 11 July 1998.

The wealth of original texts available in the Bahá’í Faith has been translated
into western languages to only a small degree and has been little researched.
It is therefore due especially to the efforts of Dr. Udo Schaefer that the
positions of the Bahá’ís on bioethical and biomedical questions can be
presented; Dr. Schaefer has become known as the author of several

publications on Bahá’í ethics, and he is at present writing a comprehensive
presentation on this subject.9

Fundamental questions

Sources for making decisions

The source for making decisions on ethics is the entire (by no means
completed) canon of writings, i.e. the authentic texts from the pen of the Báb
and Bahá’u’lláh. Complementary to this are the writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and
Shoghi Effendi, the “Guardian of the Cause of God”, who both had the
function of authoritative interpretation: it was incumbent on them to interpret
the revealed teachings authoritatively. With the death of Shoghi Effendi
authoritative interpretation came to an end.

Authorities for making decisions

The responsibility for making a decision on ethical issues rests first of all with
the individual believer, who orients his ethical action in accordance with the
revealed writings and in doing so is responsible only to his own conscience
and to God. The legal institutions of the community, to which the believers
owe obedience, are not entitled to make any jauthoritative interpretation of
ethics. Supplementary legislation to the revealed law is entrusted to the
supreme directing council, the “Universal House of Justice” – an institution
consisting at present of 9 members with its seat in Haifa, which is elected by
the world community. This institution is responsible for legislation in all
matters on which the revelation is silent. The charisma of infallibility
conferred on this institution for the area of legislation raises the law made by it
to the level of the revealed law. The community is thus in the possession of a
religious law consisting of the ius divinum positivum (sacred writings) and the
ius divinum complementum (law set by the Universal House of Justice). The
legal norms set by this institution may have ethical implications, i.e. they are
binding upon the conscience of the individual. Concretely that means, for
instance, that the establishment of legal norms on the complex of bioethical
questions would also have relevance for the i ndividual’s decision of
conscience.

Relationship to the revealed religion

Since bioethical and biomedical questions affect man in his essential nature,
and since the latter is a central part of the revelation, there is an immediate
relationship to the revealed religion.

Anthropological foundation

Image of man

Bahá’u’lláh’s image of man shows many analogies to the image of man of the
Abrahamic world religions. According to the teaching of Bahá’u’lláh, man is
God’s mystery, “the noblest and most perfect of all created things”,10 “chosen
to be God’s image*”, his “likeness”, his “representative” on earth. Man is the
purpose and culmination of creation and has been created to “know and
worship God”. He should know himself and should achieve victory over his
carnal self and become perfect. Of all creatures, man alone has an eternal
soul, which comes into existence at the moment of conception and survives
beyond his earthly existence: “We are God's, and to Him shall we return."

The idea of reincarnation is not accepted. The continuance of life beyond
death takes place in other worlds of God, not on earth. The hereafter is not a
kind of soul bank for this world. The transcendental importance of human
action is shown beyond the threshold of death, when man stands before God’s
judgment-seat. Life in this world is a preparation for our future life.

Health and Sickness

The body of man, his “physical frame”, is “the throne of the inner temple”.
Therefore it should be treated and preserved with great respect. When even a
dead body is to be treated with the utmost “honour and respect”, this applies
also to the foetus.

The believer is morally obligated to preserve his health and avoid anything
that may harm and ruin it. Thus, for instance, the smoking of tobacco is not
forbidden, but it is branded as “repugnant”, “an evil habit”, and “deprecated in
the sight of God as abhorrent, filthy in the extreme; and, albeit by degrees,
highly injurious to health”. In addition to purity of heart, which is demanded
in all religions, great value is also placed on physical cleanliness. Lat.afah
(Refinement, culturedness, cleanliness) is altogether a key term in the ethics of
Bahá’u’lláh. Great importance is attached to a healthy way of living and
healthy nutrition.

Illness is not a punishment – even saints became sick – but it may very well be
a test visited by God on man for the sake of his spiritual well-being, his
spiritual progress and his perfection. The healing of a sick person can happen

in a spiritual manner; Bahá’u’lláh has revealed a number of healing prayers for
this purpose. Healing thus has a spiritual dimension, as expressed by the
etymological relationship between “Heilung” [healing] and “Heil” [salvation].
Bahá’u’lláh stressed the importance of prayer for healing but he did not
advocate any particular method of healing.

Shoghi Effendi writes on this point: “There is no such thing as Bahá’í healers
or a Bahá’í type of healing. In His Most Holy Book (the Aqdas) Bahá’u’lláh
says to consult the best physicians, in other words, doctors who have studied a
scientific system of medicine; he never gave us to believe that He himself
would heal us through ‘healers’, but rather through prayer and the assistance
of medicine and approved treatments.”

Bahá’u’lláh commands succinctly: “Resort ye, in times of sickness, to
competent physicians.” By so doing, he rejected the tendencies arising
repeatedly in the history of religion of having a low opinion of scientific
medicine and seeking healing for sick people exclusively in spiritual practices.
The competent physician (not the quack) is highly regarded. He may even
allow the use of alcoholic beverages or certain drugs that are forbidden to the
believers, if this is medically indicated.

People’s affliction by illness is also dependent on progress in mankind’s
civilisation. At an unpredictable future time, in which the illness-producing
factors, extreme poverty and misery will have been overcome, it is promised
that science and medicine will reach such a high standard that a healthy state
in people will be the predominant condition.

Liberty and responsibility

Man’s liberty, together with his reason and his dignity, are among his
fundamental anthropological equipment. Despite his genetic and social
determinants, he has some latitude for free decision-making and action. The
biological human sciences’ deterministic image of man, which reduces him to
his biological nature, has been rejected. With liberty, man is also given
responsibility. He must account for his actions before the supreme judge. It is
therefore not immaterial how man lives, because in accordance with his
earthly life reward and punishment will be meted out to him in the hereafter.

The complexes of bioethical questions

The beginning of human life

Human life, and with it the eternal soul, begins at conception. A legal
definition of this concept is not found in the writings. It is thus not yet
clarified whether the decisive moment for the beginning of life and the soul’s

coming into existence is the fusion of the egg and the sperm or the “nidation”
[implantation of the fertilised egg in the mucous membrane of the womb].

Problems surrounding in-vitro fertilisation

There is no ban on in-vitro fertilisation, on condition that the sperm is from the
husband and not from a third party or a sperm-bank; because according to the
teachings of Bahá’u’lláh marriage is the sole place where the procreation of
descendants legitimately takes place.

Cloning (therapeutically/reproductively)

There are no binding statements on cloning. Regarded from the point of view
of the Bahá’í image of man and the theology of creation on which the writings
are based, reproductive cloning appears to be a forbidden interference in God’s
order of creation.

The artificial production of a human being for therapeutic purposes, that is
with the intention of cannibalising it for spare parts, is incompatible with
Bahá’u’lláh’s normative image of man and human dignity. Even therapeutic
cloning with embryonic stem cells encounters serious reservations, while
therapeutic cloning with adult stem cells appears to be unproblematic.

Pre-natal/ pre-implementation diagnostics

Neither has the question of pre-implementation diagnostics been clarified so
far. Such diagnostics encounter serious reservations, because it opens the way
for social-Darwinistic selection.

Stem cell research (embryonic, adult)

While adult embryonic stem cell research seems unproblematic, embryonic
stem cell research is problematic because of the unclarified question of when
human life begins.

The problems of the bioethical complex of questions are subjects that will at
some time be settled for the Bahá’ís through supplementary legislation by the
Universal House of Justice, but an establishment of legal norms is not
expected for some time to come. Until such a time the believers are referred
to their own conscience. They are obligated not to make dogmatic statements
and not to give their own understanding of the subject as Bahá’í teaching.

The complexes of medical-ethical questions

Protection of life at the beginning (pregnancy conflicts)

The primary purpose of marriage is the procreation of descendants who
succeed one another through the generations to serve, revere and worship God.
Nothing is mentioned in the holy writings about birth control. The decision
not to have any children is, however, incompatible with the purpose of
marriage. Since the human soul comes into existence at procreation, a
termination of pregnancy just for the sake of avoiding an unwanted pregnancy
is forbidden in every case.

As to the question of what kinds of cases would make an abortion legally and
ethically permissible, nothing can be found in the writings about it. The
Universal House of Justice has so far not made any legal rulings and will not
do so for the time being. Until this question is settled legally, every believer
has to decide in accordance with his conscience. The so-called “medical
indication” does not seem to pose a problem: when an abortion is the only
means of preserving the health or the life of the mother, the life of the mother
takes precedence over the “nasciturus” [embryo].

Values in the doctor-patient relationship

The central ethical values for the relationship between doctor and patient are
honesty on the part of the doctor and trust on the part of the patient in the
doctor’s skill and person. In his “Tablet to a Physician”, Bahá’u’lláh praises
the art of healing as the “most meritorious of all sciences”, as a means given
by God for the well-being of man. The text contains some prescriptions for
medical treatment, for example to initially treat the patient through diet and
resort to medications only when dietary treatment proved unsuccessful.
Bahá’u’lláh emphasises that contentment under all circumstances is conducive
to health, that grief and sorrow harm health, that jealousy consumes the body
and anger burns the liver. According to these texts the doctor, before treating
the patient, should first turn to God and seek his assistance. A physic ian who
is filled with the love of God exerts such an influence that his mere visit will
be conducive to healing the patient.

Protecting life at the end (debate on euthanasia)

The holy writings are silent on the question of euthanasia. It has to be
assumed that God, who has given life, must also dispose its end. Man is
forbidden to commit suicide. For the physician this means that euthanasia or
assisted suicide is not permitted ethically. The so-called “passive euthanasia”
(the avoidance of life-prolonging or life-preserving measures, particularly
attempted revival, in accordance with the declared will of the patient) seems
unobjectionable ethically. Beyond this it is again the case that, as long as the
Universal House of Justice has not legislated on this question, every individual
must decide in accordance with his conscience.

Positions of the Faith on State biological and health policies

The Bahá’í religious community would like to suggest that State health
policies should orient themselves by the following goals:

Man should not be considered merely as a biological entity, as a purely
animal, material being but as a material-spiritual being with inherent dignity.

Accordingly, a medical system should be demanded in which the well-being of
the patient has absolute priority over questions of economy, over an unbridled
search for knowledge and feasibility. Apparatus-medicine at any price is
incompatible with these demands.

Characterisation of positions from an ethical point of view

Apart from the great dedication with which Bahá’ís take part in the discourse
on bioethics and medical ethics, their positions are important for several
reasons:

First of all, the Bahá’í Faith is a very young religion that absorbs traditional
elements from other religions and combines them with views from the modern
world; this is shown, for example, in its open, but nevertheless critical,
understanding in relation to (modern) medicine.

Secondly, the Bahá’í Faith, compared to dominant Christianity, is a foreign
religion in the West. Despite this the Bahá’ís, because of their openness to
other religious traditions, seem to be a particularly good partner for dialogue,
making the strange, eastern world of belief clearer to western understanding.

The ethical positions of the Bahá’ís are characterised by the polarity of the
“personal moral conscience of the individual” on the one hand and “binding
ethical norms” (represented by the revelation and the authoritative decisions
by the Universal House of Justice) on the other; a similarity with, for example,
the Catholic situation, cannot therefore be denied.

In making decisions, the value of human dignity is central for the Bahá’ís; thus
they move not just within a western Kantian philosophy but also within the
modern legal and constitutional State.

As for all other religious communities, it is also important to the Bahá’ís that
man should not be reduced to a “biological machine” but that he should be
comprehended in his bodily-spiritual wholeness. This is shown also in the
suggestions and wishes of the religious community in regard to State health
policy.

The dedication to and intensive preoccupation of the Bahá’ís with ethical
questions and problems should in no way remain unused for a societal
discourse; rather it is admirable from the point of view of state church law
how such a (numerically) small religious community makes its contribution to
civil society in the solution of current problems.
