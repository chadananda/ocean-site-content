and responsibilities

hoda MahMoudi and Gloria TeCkie

Abstract
This paper provides a preliminary overview of some issues relevant to the role of
the Bahá’í physician in the practice of medicine and the delivery of health care,
taking into account the spiritual dimension of being human as an inseparable
aspect of the relationship between medical intervention and health. The authors
examine aspects of good medical care including an appreciation of the interac-
tions between—and treatment of—mind, soul, and body; patients’ role and
responsibility toward maintaining their own health and for choosing a competent
physician; the comprehensive nature of the physician–patient relationship; func-
tions and responsibilities of the Bahá’í physician; and the role of physicians with-
in the health care system and the Bahá’í approach to development and health care
delivery.

inTroduCTion

Physicians1 have a profound influence on lives. in their efforts to restore
health and improve the quality of life for their patients, they often face
complex challenges and decisions involving life and death. in arriving at
the most suitable decisions, they must evaluate factors beyond the phys-
ical to include the psychological, social, and cultural dimensions of their
patients’ lives. as medical sociologist renée fox points out, “The range
of matters in which bioethics is involved is not confined to ethics.
Bioethics is also concerned with moral questions, including those that lie
at the heart of society and culture, and of religion” (27).

at a fundamental level, medicine concerns itself not only with life and
social systems, but also with the future and destiny of humanity. as in any
other human endeavor, one must ask to what ends we engage in the prac-
tice of medicine and in what ways we can increase the quality and effec-
tiveness of what physicians do in service to others. The aim of this paper
is to provide a preliminary overview of some of the salient issues relevant
to the role of the Bahá’í physician in the practice of medicine and the deliv-
ery of health care. The complexity and breadth of this subject awaits elab-
oration in future research that can provide a more detailed examination of

Bahá’í Physicians                              57

the specific topics. in examining the role of medicine in health, the paper
takes into account the spiritual dimension of being human as an insepara-
ble aspect of the relationship between medical intervention and health.
‘abdu’l-Bahá describes this spiritual dimension as including “the spiritual
virtues and divine qualities . . . faith, knowledge, certitude, justice, piety,
righteousness, trustworthiness, love of God, benevolence, purity, detach-
ment, humility, meekness, patience and constancy. . . . show[ing] mercy to
the poor, defend[ing] the oppressed, giv[ing] to the wretched and
uplift[ing] the fallen” (Some Answered Questions, 46).

in providing a Bahá’í perspective on matters relevant to the practice of
medicine, the paper examines facets of good medical care including an
appreciation of the interactions between—and treatment of—mind, soul,
and body; the patient’s role and responsibility toward maintaining their
own health and for choosing a competent physician; the definition of a
competent physician; the comprehensive nature of the physician–patient
relationship; the functions and responsibilities of the Bahá’í physician; and
the role of physicians within the health care system and the Bahá’í
approach to development and health care delivery.

Mind, Soul and Body

health is a complete system involving interactions between the mind, soul,
and body. There is a rich resource of scientific studies examining the inter-
action between the brain, the immune system, and behavior. Psycho-
neuroimmunology,2 which studies the connection between the mind and
the immune system, incorporates methods of harnessing the body’s inher-
ent healing abilities, and continues to expand knowledge and understand-
ing about how the mind influences the body. although it is beyond the
scope of this paper to examine the scientific studies regarding the relation-
ship between mind, body, and disease, a brief discussion is relevant.

Maier, Watkins, and fleshner, in reviewing the scientific evidence con-
cerning the relationship between the nervous system, behavior, and the
immune system, explain that over twenty years ago the common view

58            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

> was that the immune system was a closed system. it was thought to be
> driven by challenges from foreign substances (antigens) and regulated
> by soluble products produced and released by immune cells (lym-
> phokines or cytokines, more generally). These products serve both to
> communicate between immune cells both locally and at distant sites
> and to control the progress of the immune response. although anti-
> gens do initiate immune responses and cytokines do regulate immune
> processes, a wide array of recent research demonstrates that there are
> bidirectional communication pathways between the immune system
> and central nervous system (CnS), with each providing important
> regulatory control over the other. (1004)

in a comprehensive review article, astin et al. set out to provide “a gen-
eral overview of the state of the science regarding the relative efficacy of
an array of psychosocial–mind–body interventions” (“Mind-Body
Medicine” 133). The authors point out that the evidence from research
covering the span of approximately thirty years suggests that psycholog-
ical factors stemming from emotional states have been shown to directly
influence physiologic function and health outcomes. Their article, which
excludes mental illness and psychological difficulties, focuses on the rela-
tive effects of mind–body therapies (MBTs) on the treatment of health-
related problems. The study used the national institutes of health’s defi-
nition of MBTs as “interventions that use a variety of techniques designed
to facilitate the mind’s capacity to affect bodily function and symptoms.”
The interventions examined in the review included relaxation, meditation,
imagery, hypnosis, and biofeedback. We note here the results of only those
studies utilizing randomized control trials. The studies reporting a strong
positive correlation between the effect of MBTs on bodily function and
symptoms included interventions on conditions as diverse as cancer, car-
diovascular pathology (post-myocardial infarction recovery), rheumato-
logical conditions, headaches, and incontinence. of significance were the
improved outcomes after surgery when MBTs were applied.

in a paper examining the spiritual, social, and neurobiological influ-
ences on resilience in children exposed to hardship, Mahmoudi and

Bahá’í Physicians                             59

ahmadiyeh concluded that early exposure to hardship has positive bene-
fits that stem from exposure to events requiring adaptation to change.
The authors postulated that this adaptation occurs at the level of the brain
as well as at the level of the soul and spirit, and is mediated by neuroen-
docrine and molecular events as well as by forces acting on the soul. a
number of reviews on the relationship between brain adaptation, neuroen-
docrine, and molecular events, and their influence on the spirit are avail-
able in the literature.3

To understand the full scope of the human being in relation to health,
we must take into consideration the phenomenon of the human spirit, its
transformative capacity emanating from spiritual attributes, and its
unparalleled quality of transcendence. from the Bahá’í perspective, the
reality of human beings is the spirit, which is also referred to as the
“rational soul” (‘abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions 208). Bahá’u’lláh
describes the essence of the human soul as “a mystery among his [God’s]
mysteries” (Gleanings 160). he gives the following description of the
qualities of the rational faculty:

Consider the rational faculty [same as rational soul] with which
> God hath endowed the essence of man. examine thine own self, and
> behold how thy motion and stillness, thy will and purpose, thy sight
> and hearing, thy sense of smell and power of speech, and whatever
> else is related to, or transcendeth, thy physical senses or spiritual per-
> ceptions, all proceed from, and owe their existence to, this same fac-
> ulty. So closely are they related unto it, that if in less than the twin-
> kling of an eye its relationship to the human body be severed, each
> and every one of these senses will cease immediately to exercise its
> function, and will be deprived of the power to manifest the evidences
> of its activity. (Gleanings 164)

as a further elucidation to the above extract, Bahá’u’lláh expounds on the
complex relationship between the rational faculty and the physical make-
up of humans:

60            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

it is indubitably clear and evident that each of these afore-mentioned
> instruments has depended, and will ever continue to depend, for its
> proper functioning on this rational faculty, which should be regard-
> ed as a sign of the revelation of him Who is the sovereign lord of
all. . . .

it would be wholly untrue to maintain that this faculty is the same
> as the power of vision, inasmuch as the power of vision is derived from
> it and acteth in dependence upon it. it would, likewise, be idle to con-
> tend that this faculty can be identified with the sense of hearing, as
> the sense of hearing receiveth from the rational faculty the requisite
> energy for performing its functions. (Gleanings 164–65)

‘abdu’l-Bahá explains, “The spirit of man is a circumambient power that
encompasseth the realities of all things” (Selections 178). in connection
with the human spirit and the rational soul he writes: “This spirit, which
in the terminology of the philosophers is the rational soul, embraces all
beings, and as far as human ability permits discovers the realities of
things and becomes cognizant of their peculiarities and effects, and of the
qualities and properties of beings” (Some Answered Questions 208). he
then amplifies this theme of the spirit explaining that “[a]lthough the
spirit is hidden from view, still its commandments shine out like rays of
light upon the world of the human body (Selections 202). The connection
between the human spirit and the physical body is not perceptible
through the sense of touch, nor is it corporeal, yet the human spirit in its
connection to the physical body can have far-reaching influence on one’s
response to illness and health.

The scientific literature contains vast information regarding the ten-
dencies which humans have in common with animals, and there is no rea-
son to deny that such exist. however to ignore distinguishing traits
which are unique to humans is not only a concealment of their reality but
a negation of the very nature or essence of what it means to be human.
The interrelationship between the soul and mind, and between these and
the physical body, cannot be ignored when examining factors that influ-
ence one’s overall health. The potential of the human spirit to exercise

Bahá’í Physicians                             61

its unique functions in the healing process should be the focus of scien-
tific inquiry even though defining exact variables and controlling them
properly for purposes of experimentation are highly complex and diffi-
cult matters at this time. undoubtedly as scientific research becomes
more refined in its methodology, the relationship between the human
spirit and the condition of health or illness will become more evident.
Greater understanding of the forces involved in the relationship between
soul, mind, and body will have profound implications for the behaviors
which physicians bring to their interactions with patients and to their
practice of medicine.

Bahá’u’lláh states: “know thou that the soul of man is exalted above,
and is independent of all infirmities of body or mind” (Gleanings 153–54).
regarding the body’s response to illness, Bahá’u’lláh further explains:

> That a sick person showeth signs of weakness is due to the hindrances
> that interpose themselves between his soul and his body, for the soul
> itself remaineth unaffected by any bodily ailments. . . . Though an
> external object may interfere with its radiance, the light itself contin-
> ueth to shine with undiminished power. in like manner, every malady
> afflicting the body of man is an impediment that preventeth the soul
> from manifesting its inherent might and power. When it leaveth the
> body, however, it will evince such ascendancy, and reveal such influ-
> ence as no force on earth can equal. (Gleanings 154)

in the following passage ‘abdu’l-Bahá elucidates the Bahá’í approach to
treatment as one which must uphold the harmony between science and reli-
gion, in this instance referred to as “material and spiritual means” of healing:

There are two ways of healing sickness, material means and spiri-
> tual means. The first is by the treatment of physicians; the second
> consisteth in prayers offered by the spiritual ones to God and in turn-
ing to him. Both means should be used and practiced.

illnesses which occur by reason of physical causes should be treat-
ed by doctors with medical remedies; those which are due to spiritu-
62             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

> al causes disappear through spiritual means. Thus an illness caused
> by affliction, fear, nervous impressions, will be healed more effective-
> ly by spiritual rather than by physical treatment. hence, both kinds of
> treatment should be followed; they are not contradictory. (Selections
> 159-60)

‘abdu’l-Bahá indicates that “the spirit of man is not in the body because
it is freed and sanctified from entrance and exit, which are bodily condi-
tions” (Some Answered Questions 229). Therefore, illness and bodily injury
cannot bring harm to the spirit. learning to draw upon the capacities
with which the human spirit is endowed, patients can gain experience in
how to positively come to terms with their diagnosis and make the nec-
essary adjustments in an attempt to restore their health and outlook on
life events that are presented to them. The functions of this unique
human quality, the spirit, and its interrelationship with illness, disease, or
injury are further described by ‘abdu’l-Bahá as follows:

> it [the human spirit] neither becomes ill from the diseases of the body
> nor cured by its health; it does not become sick, nor weak, nor miser-
> able, nor poor, nor light, nor small—that is to say, it will not be
> injured because of the infirmities of the body, and no effect will be vis-
> ible even if the body becomes weak, or if the hands and feet and
> tongue be cut off, or if it loses the power of hearing or sight. There-
> fore, it is evident and certain that the spirit is different from the body,
> and that its duration is independent of that of the body; on the con-
> trary, the spirit with the utmost greatness rules in the world of the
> body; and its power and influence, like the bounty of the sun in the
> mirror, are apparent and visible. But when the mirror becomes dusty
> or breaks, it will cease to reflect the rays of the sun. (Some Answered
> Questions 229)

The reciprocal interaction of the spirit and the body is clarified further in
relation to the functions of mental faculties or mind. in a Tablet written to
the prominent psychiatrist and entomologist, august forel, ‘abdu’l-Bahá

Bahá’í Physicians                              63

discusses “mental faculties” as being “the inherent properties of the soul,
even as the radiation of light is the essential property of the sun” (qtd. in
vader 71). he states that “[i]t is through the power of the soul that the
mind comprendeth, imagineth and exerteth its influence, whilst the soul
is a power that is free” (71). ‘abdu’l-Bahá explains that the mind is capa-
ble of comprehending the “abstract by the aid of the concrete (71),” but he
explains that the soul has “limitless manifestations of its own” (71). he
describes the function of the mind as the “all-unifying agency that so
uniteth all the component parts” in all that constitutes the body of man.
The mind is described as having a clearly defined range of activity, where-
as the soul is limitless. ‘abdu’l-Bahá further explains the relationship
between faculties of the mind and the human soul as follows: “These fac-
ulties are but the inherent properties of the soul, such as the power of
imagination, of thought, of understanding; powers that are the essential
requisites of the reality of man, even as the solar ray is the inherent prop-
erty of the sun” (78–79). he further elaborates that “[t]he temple of man
is like unto a mirror, his soul is as the sun, and his mental faculties even as
the rays that emanate from that source of light. The ray may cease to fall
upon the mirror, but it can in no wise be dissociated from the sun” (79).

a comprehensive understanding, by the medical profession, of the
complex yet mysterious relationship between the human spirit and the
body will no doubt shed light on many new dimensions of the science of
health and well-being. This is an area in which further research can pro-
vide essential knowledge for medical education. however, it is not suffi-
cient to assert that research on the soul is not practicable since its exis-
tence cannot be proven; many intangible phenomena are currently stud-
ied through the rigors of the scientific method. Science has been unable
to fully understand or explain the force or origins of electrical charge; it
has not yet proven the existence of matter or the origins of the universe,
yet our inability at this time to prove the existence of such phenomena
does not prevent us from pursuing their study.

With scientific advances being made in the fields of cognitive neuro-
science and psychoneuroimmunology, our understanding of the role of
the mind and the spirit in relation to health has already produced findings

64            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

that can no longer be ignored. over the past approximately fifteen years
there has been growing interest in including spirituality in medical edu-
cation, in particular in north america. More medical schools are offer-
ing courses in religion and spirituality, and clinical studies are exploring
how spirituality may contribute to the coping strategies of patients, par-
ticularly those facing severe, terminal, and end of life issues. at the
George Washington institute for Spirituality and healing, for example,
educational, clinical, and research programs on the role of spirituality
and health in medicine are ongoing for physicians and other health care
professionals.4

Scientific research continues to explain with greater precision the rela-
tionship that the mind and body manifest in relation to overall well-being
and the restoration of health, but far more attention and energy needs to
be expended on research, education, and training in this area. Scientific
medicine will become more scientific, as suggested by rené dubos, for
having “learned how to manage the forces of the body and the mind” (23).
as knowledge expands about the higher, more sophisticated functions of
human beings and, more specifically about the human spirit, the mind and
body and their binding relationship, new scientific interventions will
emerge. a greater understanding of the influence of the “mental faculties”
as the “inherent properties of the soul,” will change current views and
generate new insights about the organic relationship that comprises all
the various components of the soul, body, and mind framework.

The role of The PaTienT

although a consideration of the patient’s role and attitude may seem to
be unrelated to the physician’s responsibilities, as it is not under the
physician’s control, the part played by the patient in the maintenance of
good health, the patient’s relationship to the physician, and the role of a
spiritual attitude toward suffering merit mention here because the healing
project is a partnership, and the approach taken by the physician cannot
be maximally effective if it is not aligned with that of the patient.
What does it mean to have good health? The World health organization

defines health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being
and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity” (100). a state of health
is the experience of an overall sense of well-being. in addition to absence
of disease or injury, to be in a state of health also means to be free of dis-
tress and to have the capacity to carry out one’s daily activities. Good
health provides the means by which individuals can carry out their func-
tions in society. rené dubos suggests that “To be healthy does not mean to
be free of disease; it means that you can function, do what you want to do,
and become what you want to become” (qtd. in Moberg and Cohn). The
condition of health implies the ability to engage in many types of activities
as a part of daily living. The “Biopsychological approach,” first put forth
by George l. engel, is intended to offer medical students and health pro-
fessionals an understanding of the interaction between biology and psy-
chological/behavioral and social forces in maintaining health and influenc-
ing the onset and course of illness.5 engel stressed the fact that physicians
have tremendous influence in assisting patients in the healing process. he
further pointed out that the manner in which physicians treat their stu-
dents serves as the greatest, most positive example of how students will
treat their patients.6 however, patients also must accept responsibility in
cooperation with physicians to restore health and achieve healing.

When individuals evade personal responsibility for their health and
well-being, they deny one of the most vital aspects of their reality and
purpose in life. accepting responsibility for oneself, and, more impor-
tantly, acting in accord with that responsibility, is one of the primary
principles which every Bahá’í should accept. a letter written on behalf of
Shoghi effendi states that “[e]ach of us is responsible for one life only,
and that is our own” (in Compilation 2:3). at a fundamental level, to take
responsibility for our own lives includes the most precious endowment
conferred upon us by God, and that is the gift of well-being.

Personal accountability for one’s health becomes even more signifi-
cant in relation to the purpose of life for individuals who have accepted
the claim of Bahá’u’lláh—to bring about a spiritual transformation, a
renewal of the social order, and the construction of a new global civi-
lization built upon the principle of oneness and justice for all. for a

66             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

Bahá’í there is a direct association between recognizing God, acting
upon his teachings through service to humankind, and taking full
responsibility for one’s health. Without good health, all other arenas of
service are subject to impairment. The act of accepting responsibility
for one’s health is thus a direct form of obedience to the Will of God. it
is the means by which one can be of service to others. it allows each
individual to fulfill his or her purpose in this life, and in preparation for
the life hereafter.7

While it is not possible to live life without experiencing illness from
time to time, life-threatening, chronic, or incurable illness can demoralize
the patient, causing anxiety, fear, hopelessness, and depression. illness
takes away our capacity to function normally and challenges our ability to
perform daily routines. nevertheless, we are assured in the Bahá’í writ-
ings, as discussed earlier, that the condition of the soul is not affected dur-
ing illness. Shoghi effendi explains: “as Bahá’u’lláh says: ‘The spirit is per-
manent and steadfast in its station.’ The veil or hindrance that interposes
between soul and body during physical disease is sickness itself. Sickness
reveals a lack of balance in human organism, an absence of equilibrium in
the forces essential for the normal functioning of the human body” (Lights
of Guidance 113).

The following extract from a letter written on behalf of Shoghi effendi
offers a remarkably insightful dimension to human suffering and its pur-
pose in our lives. he explains:

as to your question concerning the meaning of physical suffering
> and its relation to mental and spiritual healing. Physical pain is a nec-
> essary accompaniment of all human existence, and as such is unavoid-
> able. as long as there will be life on earth, there will be also suffering,
> in various forms and degrees. But suffering, although an inescapable
> reality, can nevertheless be utilised as a means for the attainment of
> happiness. . . . Suffering is both a reminder and a guide. it stimulates
> us to better adapt ourselves to our environmental conditions, and
> thus leads the way to self-improvement. in every suffering one can
find a meaning and a wisdom.

But it is not always easy to find the secret of that wisdom. it is
> sometimes only when all our suffering has passed that we become
> aware of its usefulness. (Lights of Guidance 281)

Beyond the need to recognize illness as a test and suffering “as a
reminder and a guide” to “self-improvement,” the responsibility of patients
for their health involves several other facets including the duty to take
ownership of their lifestyle choices, to develop a proactive approach to the
maintenance of their health, to seek competent physicians in times of ill-
ness, and to request a second opinion when necessary. not only do patients
need to acquire the ability to recognize well-trained physicians but also to
identify those who falsely claim to be healers. The inability or unwilling-
ness of patients to seek the counsel of a well-trained physician in a timely
manner can be the cause of unnecessary setbacks and, in some cases, the
source of irreversible, permanent damage to their health.8

CoMPeTenT PhySiCianS

in his Book of laws, the kitáb-i-aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh states: “resort ye, in
times of sickness, to competent physicians; We have not set aside the use
of material means, rather have We confirmed it through this Pen, which
God hath made to be the dawning-place of his shining and glorious
Cause” (par. 113). of significance is the word “competent” since it implies
the capacity to distinguish a physician who is competent from one who
lacks this capacity. Qualities that imply competence in a physician may
include knowledge, experience, and proficiency in the practice and sci-
ence of medicine. Shoghi effendi explains: “in his Most holy Book (the
aqdas) Bahá’u’lláh says to consult the best physicians, in other words,
doctors who have studied a scientific system of medicine. . . .” (Lights of
Guidance 278). Competency implies expertise on the part of the physician
to provide treatments that have withstood the test of the scientific
method to the best of our knowledge at this time, recognizing that
science is not a static endeavor and is subject to change with added
knowledge constantly being gained.

68            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

Medical schools and licensing bodies expend significant time and
resources in assessing the competence of would-be practitioners. in a
study examining professional competence, epstein and hundert suggest
that the current standards of assessment used for physicians and trainees
provide useful and reliable results in the areas of core knowledge and basic
skills. nonetheless, the authors point out that other dimensions of compe-
tence such as interpersonal skills, lifelong learning, professionalism, and
integration of core knowledge into clinical practice are “underempha-
sized.” epstein and hundert offer the following comprehensive definition
for professional competency: “the habitual and judicious use of communi-
cation, knowledge, technical skills, clinical reasoning, emotions, values,
and reflection in daily practice for the benefit of the individual and com-
munity being served” (226). They further offer the following description
of professional competence in physicians and trainees:

> Competence builds on a foundation of basic clinical skills, scientific
> knowledge, and moral development. it includes a cognitive func-
> tion—acquiring and using knowledge to solve real-life problems;
> an integrative function—using biomedical and psycho-social data
> in clinical reasoning; a relational function—communicating effec-
> tively with patients and colleagues; and an affective/moral func-
> tion—the willingness, patience, and emotional awareness to use
> these skills judiciously and humanely. Competence depends on habits
> of mind, including attentiveness, critical curiosity, self-awareness, and
> presence. (226–27)

Both from a strictly professional perspective as well as from a standpoint
based upon the Bahá’í writings, competency is a far more complex matter
than simply acquiring “factual knowledge” or “the ability to solve prob-
lems with clear-cut solutions.” Schön proposes additional qualities that are
equally important, stating that competence “is defined by the ability to
manage ambiguous problems, tolerate uncertainty, and make decisions with
limited information” (227).

Professional competence also calls for a balance between professional-
ism and compassionate care, especially the alleviation of patient suffering

and showing concern for the patient. Chervenak and McCullough suggest
that physician-leaders should create a “moral culture of professionalism in
health-care organizations” (875) to include four virtues—self-effacement,
self-sacrifice, compassion, and integrity.9

Perhaps a less obvious dimension of the positive patient–physician rela-
tionship is the ability to develop a level of trust that allows patients to
accept what the physician prescribes and follow through with what is
required in order to regain and preserve their health. it is in the act of
acquiring trust in a skilled physician that the potential for developing a
positive attitude to the process of one’s healing emerges. The development
and nurturance of this sensitive and essential bond is supported in the
Bahá’í writings, which state that the physician has two powers—one for
physical healing and the other for spiritual health.

indeed, we search for and respect the competent physician who is well
trained in scientific knowledge, has developed excellent skills, and is able
to think critically and wisely under all conditions. however, equally
important and in keeping with the principle of the harmony between sci-
ence and religion, patients should look for physicians whose characters
manifest spiritual attributes with respect to the healing process. ‘abdu’l-
Bahá explains that there are two powers which physicians possess in
bringing about healing. he explains:

o thou distinguished physician! … Praise be to God that thou hast
> two powers: one to undertake physical healing and the other spiritual
> healing. Matters related to man’s spirit have a great effect on his bod-
> ily condition. for instance, thou shouldst impart gladness to thy
> patient, give him comfort and joy, and bring him to ecstasy and exul-
> tation. how often hath it occurred that this hath caused early recovery.

Therefore, treat thou the sick with both powers. (Selections 158–59)10

although the spiritual component of healing is often viewed as a sub-
jective concept not easy to study reliably, a growing number of studies
have attempted to better understand this aspect of healing from precisely
a scientific standpoint. Charon examined the role of what she terms “nar-
rative competence,” which enables physicians “to practice medicine with

70            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

empathy, reflection, professionalism, and trustworthiness” (“narrative
Medicine” 1897). She writes that “a scientifically competent medicine
alone cannot help a patient grapple with the loss of health or find mean-
ing in suffering,” maintaining that, “physicians need the ability to listen to
the narratives of the patient, grasp and honor their meanings, and be
moved to act on the patient’s behalf ” (1897).11

it is useful to examine research that has focused on the concept of empa-
thy in patient care. hojat’s recent book examines the antecedents, devel-
opment, and significance of empathy in the context of patient care. Studies
on physician empathy have concluded that empathy determines better
patient care and clinical outcomes and is a key element to professionalism
that should be incorporated into medical school curriculum.12

‘abdu’l-Bahá asserts that “matters related to man’s spirit have a great
effect on his bodily condition” (Selections 159), and that the physician
must draw upon the human spirit when undertaking physical healing. in
the studies already reviewed, the ongoing search to effectively prepare
physicians to become empathic, trustworthy, and grounded in universal
values correlates well with those qualities in the physician which, as
described by ‘abdu’l-Bahá, lead to the spiritual healing of the patient. in
addition, ‘abdu’l-Bahá describes in specific language the qualities and
conditions of spiritual healing. he encourages the physician to “impart
gladness to thy patient, give him comfort and joy, and bring him to ecsta-
sy and exultation” (Selections 158–59). Therefore, as the benefits of the
science of medicine are imparted to the patient, so the patient is con-
soled, attains a higher state of happiness, a sense of well-being, a cheer-
ful disposition, strength and hope, alleviating anxiety and pain, and lift-
ing the spirit.

Conditions and qualities of spiritual healing within the context of the
harmony between science and religion also relate to the earlier discus-
sion on the relationship between the mind and the body including
research on the role of prayer in health and healing.13 Physicians can pre-
scribe proven mind–body therapies for their patients, acknowledging the
importance of the interaction between the spiritual, social, and neurobi-
ological influences on wellness. Competent physicians take advantage of

the full panoply of scientifically proven methods, including those related
to the mind/body interaction, and combine these with their understand-
ing of the spiritual principles, as delineated above, to ensure the best pos-
sible care of the patients entrusted to them.

The PhySiCian-PaTienT relaTionShiP

The relationship between patient and physician is multifaceted and is
dependent upon such factors as socialization, cultural beliefs and atti-
tudes, education, and other experiences specific to the individual. over the
years, the patient–physician relationship has undergone change. at one
time, and perhaps still today to a far lesser degree, the expectation was
that the physician should take the role of “patient’s guardian,” articulat-
ing what was best for the patient.14 in that model, the physician exerted
full authority over the decision-making process, presenting the patient
with selected information that “will encourage the patient to consent to
the intervention the physician considers best” or in the extreme case, “the
physician authoritatively informs the patient when the intervention will
be initiated” (emanuel and emanuel 2224). This approach, reflecting a
purely paternalistic practice of medicine, finds few applications today, and
then mostly in emergency medicine where consent is not always readily
obtainable.

Generally speaking, contemporary physicians are no longer trained to
dictate the management of patient care. a team approach whereby the
patient participates in the decision-making process in collaboration with
the physician and allied medical professionals has generally replaced the
physician-centered model. in this model, patients make informed choices
and take responsibility for their own health. The team or collaborative
approach to decision making is not simplistic, nor can it dictate the exact
pattern or rules of communication between the patient and the physician.
a recent study summarizes the complexity of the delicate but important
dynamics that occur between the physician and patient in relation to treat-
ment recommendations. Clarke, et al. have concluded that

72             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

> physicians do not need an elaborate communication protocol, a pre-
> ferred model of interaction, or a decision flow chart to manage patient
> communication effectively. To aim for conformity to a “best” or pre-
> ferred model of physician-patient decision-making may actually
> undermine patient autonomy. We believe that physicians will be guid-
> ed in the right direction, and will actively take into account the differ-
> ences between individual patients, if they simply ask the patient how
> he or she wants the interaction conducted. (18)

Central to the physician–patient relationship is the challenging appli-
cation of ethical principles to the highly involved and elaborate practice of
medicine. ethical considerations are basic to defining physician compe-
tence and directly relate to the spiritual component of medical practice.
Physicians receive training in how to judge the quality and ethical accept-
ability of their work. This is achieved in large part by a highly sophisticat-
ed system of peer review. The application of principles of biomedical ethics
at the level of the physician–patient relationship is a means by which the
occurrence of negligence, inappropriate procedures, and harmful effects
are minimized. Since in this delicate relationship the physician has power
over the patient, internalization of ethical principles is essential to ensure,
as far as humanly possible, that medicine is practiced in an ethical manner.

The most widely accepted principles of biomedical ethics are those set
forth by Beauchamp and Childress. The authors developed four general
ethical principles that, in their view, should guide the physician–patient
relationship:

> Respect for autonomy, which implies informed consent and voluntary
> decision making on the part of the patient.

> Non-maleficence, which places the responsibility on the professional
> to protect the patient from harm and to weigh carefully interven-
> tions which may have harmful effects but are prescribed as the most
effective in the preservation and restoration of health.

> Beneficence, which is the duty to do good by pursuing the most
> appropriate treatment, to remove harm and provide the most suit-
> able treatment for the patient.

> Justice, or the aristotelian conception of “giving to each that which
> is his due,” which implies fairness in the distribution of medical
> treatment and services.

These guidelines present many complicated and sometimes unresolved
challenges for physicians as they carry out their work. however, such
principles serve as a guide whose aim is to promote thoughtfulness and
vigilance under all circumstances.15

When the physician–patient relationship is imbued with the Bahá’í spir-
itual principles of trustworthiness and equal rights for all, and the system
of consultation is applied to it, then a highly effective model emerges.
Trustworthiness, which includes dependability, truthfulness, constancy,
and responsibility, is referred to in the Bahá’í texts as the cornerstone, the
foundation, of all virtues. “Trustworthiness,” Bahá’u’lláh writes, “is the
greatest portal leading unto the tranquillity and security of the people. in
truth the stability of every affair hath depended and doth depend upon it”
(Tablets 37). among the essential factors of the relationship between the
physician and the patient is the establishment of a sense of tranquillity and
security.

a further dimension of the relationship which is not often recognized
is the fact that it transcends the obvious aspects of physical diagnosis and
healing. ‘abdu’l-Bahá introduces an entirely new component in this rela-
tionship: “according to the explicit decree of Bahá’u’lláh one must not
turn aside from the advice of a competent doctor. it is imperative to con-
sult one even if the patient himself be a well-known and eminent physi-
cian. in short, the point is that you should maintain your health by con-
sulting a highly-skilled physician” (Selections 164). ‘abdu’l-Bahá’s state-
ment—that the responsibility to seek a competent physician applies to
even the most competent physician who falls ill and may well have full

74            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

medical knowledge of his or her illness—implies that there is an element
of the physician–patient relationship which extends beyond medical
expertise and which contributes to the healing process.

eXPandinG funCTionS of The Bahá’í PhySiCian

Bahá’í physicians have the capacity to influence and positively bring
change to the practice of medicine through the application of Bahá’í prin-
ciples. as more Bahá’í physicians carry out their work, the spiritual stan-
dards they uphold will, over time, influence the culture of medical prac-
tice. in applying Bahá’í principles, they will uncover new aspects of heal-
ing, impart a sense of dignity to all human life, uphold human rights for
all patients regardless of their background, and practice medicine with
integrity. as applied spiritual values become observable through the
actions of Bahá’í physicians, they will become a powerful force in the
development of new curricula. Such curricula will consider research find-
ings relevant to the overall structure of the human organism. They will
find the more latent relationships between the physical dimension of the
human body and the functions of the mind in coping with disease and in
healing and in relation to feelings, perceptions, and the reasoning power
unique to human beings. as a result of focus on different elements of
what constitutes a human being and by offering training in these areas,
Bahá’í physicians can ultimately serve as examples for colleagues and
students alike.

Bahá’í physicians are also in a position to develop an entirely new dimen-
sion of the science of healing. an appreciation of the balance between spir-
itual and physical health and the need to better understand the complexi-
ties surrounding the human spirit are contributions they can bring to med-
icine. They should be at the forefront of advancing scientific medicine by
conducting research aimed at defining spiritual concepts relevant to their
profession. as in any other endeavor, in applying spiritual values to their
work they will also assess the results of their practice and refine their
methods accordingly. at the heart of this model is an aspiration that is the
goal of every Bahá’í physician, that of striving for excellence spiritually,

materially, and intellectually, the advancement and betterment of all that
pertains to the profession, including being the best physician and a full
advocate of patients, offering the most accurate diagnoses and upholding
the highest standards of professionalism in the practice of medicine. as
they survey the present needs of the ailing social order, Bahá’í physicians
are presented with the opportunity to engage their colleagues in the
search for developing the best and most practical means of resolving the
complex issues that their profession faces.

With regard to the specific qualities of a Bahá’í physician, the ability to
not only grasp what is right and wrong, but also, more importantly, to
uphold what is right despite the many pressures that exist in the current
moral environment, will undoubtedly demonstrate a level of integrity in
the eyes of both colleagues and patients. Beyond the principles of medical
ethics as drawn up by the medical establishment, however, for Bahá’í
physicians and others who share these ideals and vision, an additional set
of indispensable moral principles applies to patient care and all aspects of
the practice of medicine. among the less straightforward issues in which
the physician’s conscience must guide him or her are the artificial creation
of life, stem cell research, cloning, abortion, birth control, euthanasia and
life support, death and dying, mental competency, and confidentiality and
disclosure. The decision-making process should be guided by a close
examination of the relevant ethical and spiritual principles, and always
guided by the overarching principle of the harmony between science and
religion.

The current debate about most of the issues listed above is an obvious
indicator of what can go wrong when spiritual principles are removed from
the scientific enterprise. Without true harmony between religion and sci-
ence, emerging scientific findings can have colossal negative implications
for how we approach life itself. Who is to decide how to dispense with life
that is frozen in a tube stored in a laboratory? Will it be the physician, the
scientist, governments, religious organizations, or popular opinion that
decides what constitutes a living human organism? Who should take
responsibility for decisions surrounding stem cell research or cloning?
do we have the right to decide when life should be terminated? What

76             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

is the place of science and what is the place of religion in determining
such complex issues? in One Common Faith, these roles are described as
follows:

> at the deepest level, as Bahá’u’lláh emphasizes, there is but one reli-
> gion. religion is religion, as science is science. The one discerns and
> articulates the values unfolding progressively through divine revela-
> tion; the other is the instrumentality through which the human mind
> explores and is able to exert its influence ever more precisely over the
> phenomenal world. The one defines goals that serve the evolutionary
> process; the other assists in their attainment. Together, they constitute
> the dual knowledge system impelling the advance of civilization.

(Bahá’í World Centre 33)

in an article exploring ethics in the technological culture of medicine,
keulartz et al. state that “[n]either traditional philosophy nor current
applied ethics seem able to cope adequately with the highly dynamic char-
acter of our modern technological culture. This is because they have insuf-
ficient insight into the moral significance of technological artefacts and
systems” (3). The study suggests that there exists “a ‘normative deficit’
and display of agnostic or even antagonistic attitude toward ethics” (3).
however, without ethical standards and a comprehension of the spiritual
dimension of existence, matters critical to the giving and taking of life and
all that lies between are likely to be viewed as simply mechanical proce-
dures. The field of bioethics with its multifaceted issues must ultimately
take into account the spiritual dimension of the human being. for these
reasons it becomes apparent why the Bahá’í perspective places the pri-
mary expectation upon physicians to acquire a sound knowledge and
understanding of spiritual concepts, place their reliance on God, and to
draw on this knowledge to aid and assist them in providing medical care.
The act of reliance, whether by means of prayer or reverence, on a higher
force transcending the human being, which guides the universe and all
that is therein, provides the stability that is so critical to issues surround-
ing bioethics. ‘abdu’l-Bahá expounds on this point as follows:

> When giving medical treatment turn to the Blessed Beauty
> [Bahá’u’lláh], then follow the dictates of thy heart. remedy the sick
> by means of heavenly joy and spiritual exultation, cure the sorely
> afflicted by imparting to them blissful glad tidings and heal the
> wounded through his resplendent bestowals. When at the bedside of
> a patient, cheer and gladden his heart and enrapture his spirit
> through celestial power. indeed, such a heavenly breath quickeneth
> every moldering bone and reviveth the spirit of every sick and ailing
> one. (Selections 159)

There are no easy resolutions to the moral issues that permeate the
practice of medicine, such as those surrounding the inception or termina-
tion of life, or the advisability of pursuing medical procedures which may
entail major physical and/or psychological complications for the patient
or the effectiveness of which is questionable or unproven. Bahá’í physi-
cians have a set of guiding principles in relation to the myriad moral and
ethical issues they encounter, which invite them as physicians to explore
in depth the spiritual nature of human beings. This ethical approach,
rather than offering clear-cut answers to difficult dilemmas, develops a
deeper awareness regarding life and the uncertainties that surround it. at
the heart of this approach is the belief that there is a force greater than
human beings and that knowledge about all that constitutes life on this
planet is not fully understood by the finiteness of the human mind.

in a letter of 5 June 1988 written on behalf of the universal house of
Justice, the international governing body of the Bahá’í community, the
Bahá’í principle relevant to moral issues is elucidated. What is unique
about the Bahá’í perspective on this subject is the emphasis on a non-
dogmatic approach to the application of spiritual principles to moral
issues. as the universal house of Justice explains:

> in studying these principles, it should be noted that in most areas of
> human behaviour there are acts which are clearly contrary to the law
> of God and others which are clearly approved or permissible; between
> these there is often a grey area where it is not immediately apparent
78            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

> what should be done. it has been a human tendency to wish to elimi-
> nate these grey areas so that every aspect of life is clearly prescribed.
> a result of this tendency has been the tremendous accretion of inter-
> pretation and subsidiary legislation which has smothered the spirit of
> certain of the older religions. in the Bahá’í faith moderation, which
> is so strongly upheld by Bahá’u’lláh, is applied here also. Provision is
> made for supplementary legislation by the universal house of
> Justice—legislation which it can itself abrogate and amend as condi-
> tions change.16

The open-endedness of this approach relies upon the balance and har-
mony between science and religion. it calls for individuals to make diffi-
cult ethical decisions for themselves. as science advances and discovers
more of the currently unknown aspects of human life, the wisdom of the
principles and laws of Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation will become more evident
on the part of the individual and hence the society at large. This process,
reciprocal in its essence, calls for patience, a tolerance of ambiguity, and
faith that with the passage of time a greater understanding of certain
moral issues will be gained.

in his Writings, Bahá’u’lláh has written that humanity, having pro-
gressed through the stages of infancy, childhood, and adolescence, has not
yet reached its age of adulthood. The maturity that humanity is now
approaching requires a set of characteristics, among which the most cru-
cial is the ability to think and act responsibly, calmly, independently, wise-
ly, and without the veil of prejudice; to examine the spiritual principles,
reflect thoughtfully upon the choices before them, and act accordingly.
The universal house of Justice expounds on this point:

> There is also a clear pattern already established in the Sacred
> Scriptures, in the interpretations made by ‘abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi
> effendi, and in the decisions so far made by the universal house of
> Justice, whereby an area of the application of the laws is intentional-
> ly left to the conscience of each individual believer. This is the age in
which mankind must attain maturity, and one aspect of this is the

> assumption by individuals of the responsibility for deciding, with the
> assistance of consultation, their own course of action in areas which
> are left open by the law of God.17

as a further elucidation of the responsibility of the individual in deter-
mining the right course of ethical action the universal house of Justice
explains:

> it should also be noted that it is neither possible nor desirable for the
> universal house of Justice to set forth a set of rules covering every
> situation. rather is it the task of the individual believer to determine,
> according to his own prayerful understanding of the Writings, pre-
> cisely what his course of conduct should be in relation to situations
> which he encounters in his daily life. if he is to fulfil his true mission
> in life as a follower of the Blessed Perfection, he will pattern his life
> according to the Teachings. The believer cannot attain this objective
> merely by living according to a set of rigid regulations. When his life
> is oriented towards service to Bahá’u’lláh, and when every conscious
> act is performed within this frame of reference, he will not fail to
achieve the true purpose of his life.

Therefore, every believer must continually study the Sacred
> Writings and the instructions of the beloved Guardian, striving
> always to attain a new and better understanding of their import to
> him and to his society. he should pray fervently for divine guidance,
> wisdom and strength to do what is pleasing to God, and to serve him
> at all times and to the best of his ability.18

These guiding principles provide Bahá’í physicians with a solid framework
within which to practice medicine. Thoughtfulness and reflection on the
multifarious and complex ethical principles surrounding medical practice
and research enlighten the unique station of human beings, providing fur-
ther understanding of how physicians should carry out their practice in
serving others. as the universal house of Justice states: “in such aspects
of morality, the guidance that Bahá’í institutions offer to mankind does not

80             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

comprise a series of specific answers to these moral issues, but rather the
illumination of an entirely new way of life through the renewal of spiritu-
al values.”

The healTh Care SySTeM and
The Bahá’í aPProaCh To develoPMenT

although scientific medicine has become a powerful institution and med-
ical knowledge has experienced phenomenal acceleration, revolutionary
advances in health care and their benefits have not yet reached vast seg-
ments of the peoples of the world. inequitable distribution of health care
resources has, in fact, become more pronounced as a result of factors such
as the widening economic gap, war and conflict, and deteriorating envi-
ronmental conditions.19 There exist today gross discrepancies in quality of
life and longevity between those who enjoy access to health care and those
who are deprived of it. unacceptable proportions of the world’s popula-
tion suffer under shocking conditions as a result of uncared-for maladies.
for example, factors such as lack of clean water, efficient sewage disposal,
or control of disease-carrying organisms as well as high population den-
sities, soil erosion, lack of arable land for agricultural production, and mal-
nutrition contribute to the prevalence of preventable diseases, but many
diseases could easily be controlled or eradicated through practical educa-
tional programs focused on appropriate and often easily applicable preven-
tive strategies.

While an examination of the health care system as it exists on an inter-
national scale—which includes many professionals such as nurses, health
policy makers, scientists and allied health care professionals—is beyond
the scope of this paper, we wish to focus on the profound influence Bahá’í
physicians can make toward patient health care beyond their individual
practice of medicine.

in 1997, an editorial appeared in the British Medical Journal which
pointed out that “[t]he fate of patients and the public’s health depends
now on interactions so complex that no single profession can credibly
declare that its own code of ethics is enough” (Berwick et al., “an ethical

Code,” 1633). Subsequently a group of fifteen individuals known as the
Tavistock Group, comprising physicians, nurses, health care executives,
ethicists, academics, a jurist, an economist, and a philosopher, drafted “a
Statement of ethical Principles for everyone Working in health Care”
and developed a list of seven principles for “all those involved in health
care, including patients and owners of health systems”:

Rights—People have a right to health and health care

> Balance—Care of individual patients is central, but the health of
> populations is also our concern

> Comprehensiveness—in addition to treating illness, we have an obliga-
> tion to ease suffering, minimise disability, prevent disease, and pro-
> mote health

> Cooperation—health care succeeds only if we cooperate with those
> we serve, each other, and those in other sectors

> Improvement—improving health care is a serious and continuing
> responsibility

Safety—do no harm

> Openness—Being open, honest, and trustworthy is vital in health
> care (Berwick et al., “refining and implementing” 616)

The Tavistock Principles provide a useful framework from within which
Bahá’í physicians, as one of the groups who provide health care, can have
a beneficial influence with respect to the spiritual/ethical considerations
that impact the quality of health care.

There are many areas beyond the practice of hospital and office-based
medicine in which Bahá’í physicians can become involved and make a sig-
nificant contribution. in the past, many physicians had not adequately

82            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

acknowledged the important role that they could play in the provision of
effective, equitable health care delivery. health care delivery has been
viewed as the responsibility of legislators, administrators, and activists,
with some involvement of allied health care workers, such as nurse prac-
titioners, being deputized to implement programs whose aim is to reach
the destitute and to serve the health care needs of deprived populations.
What such endeavors lack are the qualified skills of competent physicians,
both in the consultative arena and in the delivery of expertise and
resources specific to their unique training. Their specialized skills are
indeed indispensable to improving the health care of these populations.

another area in which physicians can play an increasing role is that of
preventive medicine. Studies have shown that programs which focus on
prevention as a significant part of health care promotion can mitigate the
overall impact of disease within populations. educational programs, in par-
ticular, raise the level of understanding regarding health and disease with-
in communities and have far-reaching benefits.20 When physicians interface
with populations deprived of adequate health care, they realize the enor-
mous impact their actions can have and see the rewards of service and the
benefits of using their skills and expertise for the improvement of health
and living conditions of large numbers of people. Bahá’í physicians, in par-
ticular, should naturally want to concern themselves with the betterment
of the lives of people in need and of those without right of access.

The Bahá’í global community provides a rich set of examples of ongo-
ing development projects which include highly successful health-related
endeavors. in the Bahá’í community’s unique approach to social and eco-
nomic development, as “a global enterprise whose purpose is to bring
prosperity to all peoples, an enterprise that must pursue its aim in the
context of an emerging world civilization” (Bahá’í international Com-
munity 3), embodying a “dynamic coherence between the spiritual and
practical requirements of life on earth” (Lights of Guidance 545), the
potential contributions of Bahá’í physicians are limitless in scale and
influence.

from the earliest days of its founding, the worldwide Bahá’í communi-
ty has been developing its approach to development projects in countries

on all continents. it has recognized the contributions made by exceeding-
ly large numbers of individual Bahá’ís who in their professional lives are
working to serve the needs of humankind.21 Bahá’í health care projects
have included widespread immunization programs, hiv/aidS aware-
ness and prevention programs, and comprehensive health promotion and
educational projects at every level of society. an example of a highly suc-
cessful project is the Bahá’í involvement in the widely recognized collab-
oration with united nations agencies in combating river blindness
(onchocerciasis), which has impacted the lives of individuals in hundreds
of localities.22

opportunities abound for Bahá’í physicians to develop or contribute to
sustained health care-related programs wherever they reside. in serving
their communities at the systems level of health care, Bahá’í physicians
can model the principles which they are committed to and give of their
time to explore effective, long-term solutions to the many health-related
problems that currently plague so many people throughout the world.

ConCluSion

although we observe that our world has become interconnected, interde-
pendent, and has entered a period of accelerated change, we see a global
community incapable of managing the misery which is thrust upon bil-
lions of individuals on a daily basis. recent examples do not convince us
that our worldwide community can truly manage its current health chal-
lenges. Certainly there are enough examples that we can draw upon in
relation to the spread of diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria,
hiv/aidS, and various forms of influenza, as indicators of the acute need
to find workable solutions that reach all strata of the world’s population.

Shoghi effendi’s insightful writings offer a vision of the transformation
that will occur in the future civilization, aspects of which are directly relat-
ed to the physician’s practice of medicine and to the overall global system
of health care. although speaking of a distant future, his words offer
insights into the nature of the foundation that Bahá’í physicians must con-
struct at the present in order to advance humanity toward that direction.

84             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

after speaking of the abolition of “economic barriers and restrictions,”
“inordinate distinction between classes,” “destitution on the one hand, and
gross accumulation of ownership on the other,” he states that

> the enormous energy dissipated and wasted on war, whether econom-
> ic or political, will be consecrated to such ends as will extend the
> range of human inventions and technical development, to the increase
> of the productivity of mankind, to the extermination of disease, to the
> extension of scientific research, to the raising of the standard of phys-
> ical health, to the sharpening and refinement of the human brain, to
> the exploitation of the unused and unsuspected resources of the plan-
> et, to the prolongation of human life, and to the furtherance of any
> other agency that can stimulate the intellectual, the moral, and spiri-
> tual life of the entire human race. (204)

as Bahá’í physicians apply the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation to
the further advancement of their profession, they will undoubtedly
unearth new knowledge about the workings of the human body and its
interaction with the human spirit in fighting disease. as scientific inquiry,
backed up by spiritual knowledge and values, searches deeper to find
answers to medical issues, it will bring about inventions and discoveries
which will contribute to the advancement of all aspects of human life.
Bahá’í physicians are fortunate to have a clear mandate in relation to the
contributions they can make in service to humanity in the process of civ-
ilization building. The opportunities before them to render service aimed
at ameliorating the human condition are limitless. “happy the soul,”
‘abdu’l-Bahá writes, “that shall forget his own good, and like the chosen
ones of God, vie with his fellows in service to the good of all. . . .” (Secret
of Divine Civilization 116).

ney where it “will continue to progress until it attaineth the presence of God, in a state
and condition which neither the revolution of ages and centuries, nor the changes
and chances of this world, can alter.” Bahá’u’lláh states that the essence of the
human soul is one of the signs of God. The soul of man, is as “the sun by which his
body is illumined, and from which it draweth its sustenance. . . .” (Gleanings 155–160).

8. a less discussed aspect of illness is the potential for positive influence that
others can have upon the person who is sick. loved ones and friends are impelled
to visit the sick as a gesture of goodwill and from a desire to show genuine con-
cern. But what is important is the attitude that is imparted by those who visit the
sick. ‘abdu’l-Bahá states: “happiness is a great healer to those who are ill. . . .
show the utmost kindness and compassion to the sick and suffering. This has
greater effect than the remedy itself. you must always have this thought of love
and affection when you visit the ailing and afflicted” (Promulgation 204). Those
who visit the sick in a genuine state of happiness and joy bring with them a pow-
erful beneficial influence, becoming a force that assists to uplift the spirits and
bring about the healing of the sick person.

skills to the improvement of the health care delivery system in iran was dr. Susan
Moody, a Bahá’í physician who in 1909 moved from the united States to Tehran,
iran, at the request of the iranian Bahá’ís, who were in need of a female physician.
She succesfully established a medical practice in her home which served the health
care needs of both Bahá’í and Muslim women. eventually she was able to found
the unity hospital and the Tarbíyat Girls’ School (see ruhe-Schoen).
