Chronicles of a Birth Part III
Early References to the Bábí and Bahá’í Religions in

Spain (1873-1895)*

by Amín E. Egea
translated by Francisco J. Díaz

Francisco de Paula Canalejas

Francisco de Paula Canalejas (b. 1834, Córdoba, Spain — d.

1883, Madrid, Spain) was a distinguished nineteenth century
Spanish scholar. Chair of the history of philosophy at the
Universidad Central de Madrid, prolific author, and follower
of Krausist philosophy [after German philosopher Karl
Christian Friedrich Krause], today he is mostly known for
having been the uncle and mentor of assassinated Spanish
president José Canalejas.

On May 3, 1874, he published in Revista Europea 1 the first
installment of an article titled La Historia de las Religiones

[The History of Religions], which he dedicated to the poet
Ramón Campoamor (b. 1817, Navia, Spain — d. 1901, Madrid,
Spain). Like Juan Valera in his La Religión de la Humanidad
[Humanity’s Religion]2, Canalejas sought in his work to justify
religion’s enduring legacy and man’s need for spirituality. The
article would later become a chapter in his book titled El
problema religioso: Doctrinas religiosas del racionalismo
contemporáneo [The Question of Religion: Contemporary
Rationalism’s Religious Doctrines] (Madrid, 1875).

La Historia de las Religiones opens with an interesting
critique of certain academic trends at the heart of the study of
the history of religion. After a brief introduction to the Vedic
and Avestan religions, Canalejas introduces Babism as follows:

> Even today heresies in the Oriental countries, whether
> in India, China, or Persia, surface as frequently as the
> philosophical theories circulating in German
> universities, the only difference being that the former
> move the hearts of entire populations and uproot
> them, as in the days of Muhammad, and give rise to
> revolutions that rival those of 16th century Europe.
> Babism is a sterling example of this vitality of religious
> thought in the Orient. Its history, though rooted in the
> present century, displays characteristics reminiscent
> of past ages.3
Canalejas cites Gobineau as his source of information about
the Báb’s religion. His article goes on to narrate some of
Babism’s most relevant historical episodes: the Báb’s
declaration, His pilgrimage to Mecca, the features of His
influential personality, the rapid spread of His doctrines,
opposition from the Muslim clergy, the vicissitudes faced by
Mullá Husayn and Táhirih, the Bábí resistance at the Fort of
Shaykh Tabarsí, and, finally, the Báb’s martyrdom. As for Bábí
doctrine itself, Canalejas, in closing his exposition,
summarizes it thus:

> Babism’s sacred literature is extremely copious. It
> defends Muhammadan monotheism without rejecting
> Christian hypostases [i.e., Trinitarian doctrines]. God
> is the Creator, according to Babism, but God’s
Chronicles of a Birth                                           3

> creation does not proceed directly from God, but
> rather is one of His effects limited by time and space.
> Creation is equivalent to a temporal separation of that
> which has been created with respect to pure essence;
> but everything shall return to God at the end of times,
> and, not until the day of final judgment will God’s
> essence become fully known. Humanity’s occupation is
> to seek God; all of man’s obligations revolve around
> obedience to Him. In short, Babism is an Alexandrian
> doctrine, a Gnostic teaching, which breaks off from
> Muhammadanism and seeks points of commonality
> and agreement with Christianity. The Bab is not God’s
> prophet; rather he is only the prophet for the century
> [emphasis Canalejas’s], inasmuch as divine revelation
> complements itself through a series of human
> manifestations that arise throughout time, until the
> full revelation is consummated on the day of final
> judgment.
> Let the aforesaid suffice, my dear friend, to prove my
> thesis and conclude, like Max-Muller, that it is just as
> important to document the authentic and pristine
> religious doctrines of ancient peoples as it is to follow
> their history with a view toward what they eventually
> become or what direction they take through centuries
> and generations.

The second and final installment of the article was published on
May 10, though the references it contained about Babism were
less relevant.

Adolfo Rivadeneyra

Two centuries of estrangement between Spain and Persia
came to a close in 1842, with the signing in London of a treaty
meant to foster friendly relations and trade between the two
nations. Very little came about as a result of the treaty, which
was ratified some thirty years later, and it would not be until
1874 that Spain dispatched a diplomatic mission to Persia.

4                                        Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

Said delegation consisted of a vice-consul whose primary
objective was to explore potential trade routes in Persia. The
mission was placed in the charge of Adolfo Rivadeneyra.

Rivadeneyra (b. 1841, Valparaíso, Chile — d. 1882, Madrid,
Spain)4 began his diplomatic career in 1863 as a joven de
lenguas (attaché) assigned to the consulate in Beirut. By then he
was already fluent in five living languages, in addition to
Latin.

In Beirut he devoted himself to the study of Arabic at the
monastery in Ain-Warka. A mere fifty days following his
arrival, the Spanish Consul, Antonio Bernal O’Reilly, wrote to
his superiors in astonishment over how quickly Rivadeneyra
had learned Arabic. Within a year he was able to write a
treatise on grammar that he titled Estudio sobre el mecanismo
de la lengua árabe [A Study of the Mechanism of the Arabic
Language]. Displaying the same tenacity with which he had
learned Arabic, he subsequently learned Turkish, Sinhalese,
Hebrew, Armenian, Sanskrit, and, eventually, Persian.

After his tour of duty in Beirut, he continued his diplomatic
career occupying several positions such as Vice-Consul or
Provisional Consul in Palestine, Turkey, Syria, Ceylon [Sri
Lanka], and Morocco, while at the same time publishing
articles in the Spanish press and a book about his travels titled
Viaje de Ceilán a Damasco [Journey from Ceylon to
Damascus]. 5

On September 17, 1873, Emilio Castelar, President of the
Republic [of Spain], authorized Rivadeneyra’s appointment as
Vice-Consul of Persia, and, on April 11 of the following year,
he assumed his post in Tehran.

Barely a year and a half had passed before Rivadeneyra asked
to return. His departure signaled the end of Spain’s Vice-
Consulate in Persia. Once back in Madrid, Rivadeneyra began
writing, on the basis of his travel notes, his Viaje al Interior de
Persia [Journey Into Persia]6, a work encompassing three
volumes and which, in several instances, makes references to
Babism.

Chronicles of a Birth                                             5

In the fifth chapter of volume one, Rivadeneyra includes a
lengthy summary of the history of Persia and ancient Iran. The
last twelve pages contain an exposition on Babism:

> Before bringing to a close this cursory report on a
> Nation plagued by so many tragic, though not
> unrelated, events, I wish to focus on one incident that
> took place not long ago; that is, in the latter days of the
> indolent Muhammad Shah’s reign.
> It was an extraordinary incident, not only in and of
> itself, but also because of what it could have led to; an
> incident that will demonstrate yet again how fragile is
> the foundation on which seemingly everlasting
> monuments are erected, where we declare them to be the
> handiwork of gods, when, in reality, they are but the
> by-products of chance.
> Around 1844, in Shiraz, the cradle of insight, lived a
> nineteen-year-old youth by the name of Mirza Alí
> Muhammad, the descendant of an Imam, like many of
> his fellow countrymen, and deeply devoted to the study
> of religions in general, his own especially. He was
> handsome, affable, eloquent in speech, and, in addition
> to possessing such enviable traits, had great reserve, the
> product not of ignorance or timidity, but rather of
> reflection.7

Rivadeneyra then continues with a thorough account — based
entirely on Gobineau’s work — of Bábí history and precepts,
occasionally interspersing throughout the narrative his own
observations:

> To get an idea of the fear that the Bábis, now scattered
> throughout all of Iran, inspire even today, suffice it to
> say that I, a European, would never dare utter the name
> of that sect in any bazaar for fear of inciting a riot.
> It is truly regrettable that the apostles of the new
> Messiah were not more prudent; had they been, their
> victory would have been assured. Whenever the
> Government seeks to intensify its battle against the
> converts, it finds them in the majority. And it is not
> that the believers were being led by the goodness that
6                                        Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

> the religious impulse generates. Those poor souls lack
> such motivation; earning their daily bread is struggle
> enough. But the idea of enhancing their national
> identity by enthroning an Imam descended from Alí —
> and related by blood to Yazdigird, the last Sassanid
> ruler, no less — stroked their egos, so bruised today by
> the presence of a Turanian sitting upon Cyrus’s
> throne.
> This circumstance will continue to feed and nourish
> Babism, and will someday allow it to acquire renewed
> vigor. It is doubtful, however, that it will triumph in
> the end, because such enterprises can not be frustrated;
> they either triumph or die out. 8

Rivadeneyra admits that he tried in vain to obtain any of the
Báb’s writings:

> It has been impossible, despite my best efforts, to
> obtain a sample of the writings of the Bab — the name
> adopted by the alleged herald of the ‘Great Redeemer’ —
> nor of any accounts from the period during which he
> lived and which are still being written today. Mr.
> Gobineau found himself in special circumstances that
> allowed him to acquire the Biyan [sic] or Exposition on
> What Is Important to Know. What he has published is
> but a small fragment of the Bab’s writings. The most
> complete collection of same are to be found in St.

Petersburg.9
And he concludes his article with the following reflection:

> I do not know how to describe the revolution
> consummated by Babism. What I do know is that in
> the time of Darius, during the Sassanid dynasty, [and]
> throughout the entire Muhammadan period, those men
> that proclaimed a religious idea went on to become
> their Nation’s favored sons. Lacking an exemplar, they
> embrace the first man that presents himself to them,
> and they embrace him with faith and heroism; proof of
> this being that they are still in the earliest stage of
> moral development, which is faith carried to the altar
> of sacrifice. Perhaps due to this the Persians will arrive
Chronicles of a Birth                                         7

> before we do at the ideal of human society, which, I
> suppose, is equalitas sub more; in other words, what
> was in the beginning.10
The remaining volumes contain assorted detailed references
to Babism of relative importance. The third volume contains
the following anecdote:

> On the eve of my departure, a youth approached me
> and asked if I would help out the lovers of truth;
> neither the Mirza nor I could guess who those lovers
> were, and since the lad would not give me a straight
> answer, I gave him some loose change and sent him on
> his way. As soon as he departed, the cook came over to
> inform me that said individual was a Bábí, and that,
> therefore, I should avoid him in the future, lest the
> Governor become suspicious of me.11
This encounter is reminiscent of another very similar one
recounted by E. G. Browne while in Isfahan.12 Both stories,
however, to Rivadeneyra’s dismay, had very different
outcomes.

Once back in Madrid, Rivadeneyra gave a talk about Persia
before the Real Sociedad Geográfica [Royal Geographic
Society], of which he was a member, correspondent, and
secretary. Unfortunately, said society’s archives are not
accessible at present and it is not known for the moment
whether he ever mentioned Babism either in his talk13 or in his
correspondence.

Following his premature death, several tributes were paid to
the young diplomat. On March 28, 1882, Eduardo Saavedra,
president of the Sociedad Geográfica, gave a talk in memory of
his friend and colleague. In the middle of his eulogy, while
discussing Rivadeneyra’s trip to Persia, Saavedra interjected
the following:

> … so as not to bore you with accounts dealing with
> other sects, I will just mention the one inaugurated in
> 1852 by an obscure yet highly energetic and ardently
> imaginative figure, who donned the sobriquet of Bab
> or Door of Renewal, and who claimed to bring a new
> Koran. No one disturbed him so long as his preaching
8                                       Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

> restricted itself to theological matters, but when it
> began threatening the empire’s political and social
> fabric, the Government became alarmed, ordered
> savage persecutions, and was unable to quash either
> him or the disturbances caused by his followers. In the
> end, it had to turn to the assistance of a Christian
> regiment hardly impressed by the false apostle’s
> eloquence.14
One of Madrid’s leading newspapers, La Correspondencia
de España, reprinted Viaje al Interior de Persia [Journey Into
Persia] as a supplement, so that the references Rivadeneyra
made to Babism reached the public at large by way of various
printings between 1882 and 1883.15

His book became somewhat influential and helped to spread
beyond the usual circles news of the new religion. This is
demonstrated, for example, by the fact that in 1896, following
the Sháh of Persia’s assassination, numerous press articles
about Babism quoted Rivadeneyra. Even as late as 1908, one
author referred to Viaje al Interior de Persia as the first work
to have mentioned Babism in Spain. 16

The Sháh Visits Europe

Násiri’d-Dín Sháh was the first Persian monarch to visit
Europe. He did so on three separate occasions: 1873, 1878, and
1889\. The historic nature of his visits and, particularly, his and
his entourage’s exotic demeanor, captivated the European
press, especially in the United Kingdom, Austria, and France,
where the Sháh prolonged his stay in order to visit the
expositions and fairs being held there.17

The Carlist wars, to his regret, prevented the Sháh from
visiting Spain. The Spanish press, nevertheless, gave extensive
coverage to his European tour. Naturally, in discussing the
monarch’s biography or the situation in Persia, some
newspapers touched on the subject of Babism, recalling for the
most part the events of 1852.

Diario de Barcelona, for example, published on July 16, 1873,
a letter written in Paris on July 12 containing information

Chronicles of a Birth                                            9

about the Sháh. It concluded as follows: “He has a very affable
personality; he has not had to punish any of his subjects
following the Bábí insurrection.”18
Several days later this newspaper published the following:

> In 1852, Nasser-ed Din nearly fell victim to an
> assassination plot hatched by the Bábís, a Sufi sect of
> Persian free thinkers and revolutionaries, who charge
> that the Muhammadan clergy have distorted the tenets
> of Islam and, in their greedy lust, have deceived the
> Persian nation by interpreting the Koran literally and
> not according to its spirit.
> One day, as the king made his way on horseback toward
> Chimran, at the foot of Mount Albourz, four
> individuals of the Bábí sect awaited his approach by the
> roadside and handed him a petition. The king,
> unsuspecting, and led by his innate kindness, stopped
> his horse and extended his hand to take the document,
> whereupon the assassins rushed him, firing three shots
> at point-blank range. Fortunately, the Shah turned
> quickly and was only mildly injured. The assassins were
> arrested and beheaded at the scene of the crime, and
> their confessions resulted in horrible punishments
> being meted out to the Bábí chiefs that had plotted the
> conspiracy.
> Secret societies have made the Shah’s personal safety a
> cause for concern: in addition to Sufi and Bábí
> conspiracies, he has had to do battle with Freemasonry,
> which his Minister of State, Malcom [sic] Khan,
> introduced into Persia. 19
One Madrid newspaper, La Época, published the following
account of a military parade held in the Sháh’s honor:

> The review [of the troops] in Longchamps has
> impressed both the Asian prince and the French public,
> who are witness to how the nation, thanks to law and
> order, has lifted itself up in the last two years from the
> greatest of catastrophes and is still today a great
> nation. Mac-Mahon [sic] has acted with prudence,
> bringing fresh life to imperial feasts and spectacles. He

> has taken a great step toward reestablishing the
> monarchy. Moreover, Nasser-Eddin would recall that
> other grand spectacle in 1852 in Tehran, when, early in
> his reign, the Bábí conspiracy sought to kill him and the
> loyalty of his army saved him.20
La Justicia published the following on July 29, 1889:

> Now that the public’s eyes are fixed with interest on the
> Oriental sovereign, we take pleasure in reporting to our
> readers some details related to this very important
> figure.
> Nass-ed-Dine, Shah of Persia, is a cold, determined,
> and resolute man.
> Some years ago, the Bábí fanatics had whipped up
> Persia into a frenzy with their sermonizing. The Shah
> squelched the unrest with typical Oriental zeal, but that
> very harshness proved counterproductive and the
> Bábís’ fanaticism only intensified.
> Nass-ed-Dine was returning one day from the hunt — a
> pastime he avidly enjoys — when Bábís took him by
> surprise when he separated from his retinue. They held
> his steed and with a pistol opened fire on the horseman.
> The Shah, uninjured, and in           sheer cold blood,
> approached one of his attackers,     felling him with one
> savage thrust from his sword. To     the other attacker he
> gave a terrific blow with the hilt   of his Kandjar, also
> killing him on the spot.
> The next minute he was proceeding on his interrupted
> journey without betraying the slightest emotion.21

Emilia Pardo Bazán

The Exposition Universelle held in Paris in 1889, which
Násiri’d-Dín Sháh attended, attracted much of the European
public’s attention.

One Spaniard that visited the fair was the famous writer and
intellectual Emilia Pardo Bazán (b. 1851, La Coruña, Spain — d.
1921, Madrid, Spain).

The author of nearly twenty novels and six hundred articles
and short stories, she was the editor in chief of Revista de
Galicia, Biblioteca de la Mujer, and Nuevo Teatro Crítico. Her
long literary career earned her the title Countess de Pardo
Bazán, an honor bestowed personally by King Alfonso XIII in
1908\. From 1910 she served as Director of Public Education;
from 1916, as professor of literature at the Universidad Central
de Madrid. Though nominated on more than one occasion to
serve as a member of the Real Academia de la Lengua Española,
her membership was disallowed on account of her being a
woman. Today she is remembered as one of the preeminent
Spanish writers of the nineteenth century and as one of the
pioneers in the struggle for women’s emancipation. From
France she collaborated on series of articles for the journal La
España Moderna and the Argentine newspaper La Nación.
These letters, together with others composed in Germany, were
compiled in 1890 in a single volume under the title Por Francia
y Alemania [Dispatches from France and Germany].22

In Paris, she had the opportunity to meet with Násiri’d-Dín
Sháh personally, and she was moved by the experience to write a
letter, dated August 9, addressed, presumably, to the Buenos
Aires-based La Nación. The letter bore the rather blunt title Un
Diocleciano [A Diocletian (an allusion to Roman emperor
Gaius Aurelius Valerius Diocletanius, noted for his
persecution of Christians)].
The Countess’s letter opens as follows:

> The Shah of Persia is the talk of the town in Paris… The
> Shah, that is, Nasreddin, has that great city intoxicated
> by his spell, and all that people think about is going to
> see him, catching a glimpse of even his most trivial
> activities, counting the diamonds on his crown, and
> offering to wine and dine him with feasts, dinners,
> performances, and diversions of every sort.
> There are those who say that Paris’s enthusiasm for
> Nasreddin is due to that inevitable and hush-hush

> monarchical fascination so persistent in the Latin
> republics. The Shah is a king for sure, a king with all the
> usual trappings: the magnificence, power, solemnity,
> and irresponsibility of a true monarch. Nasreddin can
> chop off heads; populate his harem with virgins
> uprooted from their parents’ homes, or wives snatched
> from their husbands’ arms; embroider his horse’s
> saddlery with precious stones and have his slave trailing
> behind carrying a jug of ice-cold water so that the king
> should not have to trouble himself by asking for a drink
> in some café. Nasreddin’s subjects refer to him as
> “King of kings” and “The Shadow of God,” and this is
> what Paris sees. Paris: demolisher of Bastilles,
> revolutionary, herald of freedom and equality. And
> instead of exclaiming, as logic would dictate, “What
> stupid fools these Persians are!,” Paris follows in their
> footsteps and prostrates herself before Nasreddin, who
> is nary a prodigy of culture, neither wisdom, neither
> magnanimity, neither talent. Everyone that sees him
> suffers the same impression: that of a vulgar, stout,
> not very tall man, possessed of little majesty and
> deprived of that constant and laudable affectation of
> personal worth nowadays characteristic of monarchs
> (Nasreddin would not even enter the Eiffel Tower’s
> elevators). The sovereign of Persia possesses nothing,
> then, to justify the febrile curiosity and ardent
> sympathy that Paris has shown him.
Maintaining this sarcastic tone, she continues her letter
with a few paragraphs containing some anecdotes and
biographical items about the Sháh. The central thrust of her
letter then follows:

> For although Nasreddin, with all of these familiar
> details, will appear herein to be a simple and naïve
> sovereign willing to educate himself, like the emperor of
> Brazil, let us not fool ourselves: the story of his reign
> contains a dark and bloody page calling to mind the
> annals of a decadent Rome during the persecutions. In
> 1843, five years before the young Nasreddin assumed
> the throne, a religious sect called Babism, founded by a
> Persian from Eschiraz named Mirza-Ali Mahomet,

> allegedly a descendant of Muhammad’s, came into
> being and swept through Persia. The new religion,
> theologically speaking, was a sort of reform movement
> in the pantheistic sense; socially speaking, it was gentle,
> charity-oriented, progressive, and humane, especially
> in comparison with the religion it sought to
> substitute. Its tenets included — and still include, since
> Persia is full of Bábís — the inviolability of one’s home
> and correspondence, cordiality in one’s relations,
> respect for women and full recognition of their rights,
> the elimination of corporal punishment in education,
> nonviolence, compassion, hospitality, monogamy,
> trade, honest work as a life principle, and a multitude
> of ideas that, truth be told, seem very good, wise, and
> practical, and that are at heart essentially Christian.
> Babism’s doctrines of loving kindness, enlightenment,
> and fairness spread in such a manner that the Shah was
> soon trembling in his throne as he foresaw an
> approaching social revolution that would probably be
> the ruin of his all-embracing and despotic power and
> of the age-old and barbaric establishment of his States.
> At once he launched a bitter and terrible campaign of
> persecution against the Bábís. They were rounded up
> like beasts, surrounded in areas where they had
> established strongholds, and put to the sword; women
> and children under the age of fourteen were
> eviscerated. Believers displayed heroism, steadfastness,
> and the faith of martyrs. Their chief, Mirza-Ali, was
> paraded nude through the streets, bound by a rope,
> while mobs hurled mud, stones, and spit at him; later
> they hung him on a high wall and, from below, finished
> him off in a hail of bullets, along with a young and
> faithful disciple that they hung next to him as he
> professed his faith out loud. Such brutality upset and
> riled the Bábís, in spite of their meekness, and three
> from among their ranks resolved to kill Nasreddin. The
> murder plot against the king was foiled, and all three
> conspirators were subjected to incredible and savage
> torture. One woman, a priestess of the new sect, was
> burned alive.

> A lugubrious procession made its way through the
> streets of Tehran: scores of Bábí children and women,
> surrounded by their executioners, paraded by, the
> entire flesh on their bodies ripped to shreds and lighted
> candles thrust into each of their wounds. The
> executioner’s would goad them on with their whips,
> and the victims, instead of moaning, would sing in
> unison their hymn: “We come from God, and unto God
> do we return.” Every so often, a child would collapse,
> dead at last, free and happy. The mothers would
> continue their march, treading over their children’s
> lifeless bodies. One father’s two sons had their throats
> slit atop his breast. Later their heads were hung on
> stakes. Such was the bloodbath that brought Persian
> Babism to its knees. But clandestinely, and through the
> fire and zeal that persecution engenders, the sect has
> continued to gain converts; it has gone underground;
> it possesses potential both mysterious and powerful;
> and would that the egotistic policies of the European
> states not prefer Muhammadan backwardness over
> more civilizing, beneficent, and milder doctrines, the
> Shah would find himself dethroned when he least
> expected it and the bulk of the Persian empire would be
> Bábí.
> In wining and dining the Diocletian of Iran, Paris
> operates according to her pragmatic interests; she
> could care less about humanity’s interests. Why is it
> that religious tolerance, which is de rigueur the world
> over, which is invoked against Catholicism in order to
> protect impure rites and discarded and vain beliefs,
> can not become a fact of life in Persia, where an idea
> whose social ramifications portend greater benefits
> than Muhammadanism is being forced to go
> underground like some outlaw, and, as such, to face
> persecution and extermination? No doubt the French
> will hint at our own Inquisition (which for over 150
> years was as imaginary as the boogeyman used to
> frighten children) and continue to portray us as
> Torquemadas who burn at the stake every living
> creature. The hecatombs of Persia will not prevent the
> Parisian press from depicting Nasreddin as a kind,

> paternal roi d’Yvetot figure. Material advancements —
> telegraphs, roads, schools, new and improved firearms
> — are all fine and good; but does not moral

> scalded and broken children, or the youth’s final gasp
> as his throat is slit open atop his own father’s breast?
After these gripping ruminations, Emilia Pardo Bazán
focuses anew on personal aspects of the Sháh’s life — his
relationship with women, his opulence, his physical appearance,
etc. — and then brings to a close her letter as follows:

> As for the Shah, cursed be the curiosity he inspires in
> me. Were it not for the atrocities committed against
> the Bábís, I would indulge him. But in the end,
> Nasreddin is a tyrant; and every tyrant, when he exerts
> his tyranny against that divine ether which we call an
> idea, and persecutes souls by torturing bodies, is
> odious and loathsome. Someone in the crowd yells,
> “Long live the Shah!,” and I recall those gloom-filled
> victims, those hapless souls, outlawed for wanting to
> give to Asia a better, gentler, more humane nation…
> And I am forced to appeal to reason so as not to
> betray any displeasure, which would no doubt astonish
> these people, so captivated that a Spanish commoner
> would turn out to see ‘the darling of Persia.’
Por Francia y Alemnia enjoyed several reprintings, and, in
1891, a Mexican newspaper, El Siglo Diez y Nueve, published it
as a supplement. 23 It has been impossible to determine to date
in which issue of La Nación this letter was published.

It would not be the last time, however, that Emilia Pardo
Bazán mentioned Babism. It happened again — as we shall see
on another occasion — in 1899, this time as part of one of her
fictional stories.

Other Authors

During the years that this article focuses on, other authors
also mentioned Babism in their writings.

Francisco García Ayuso (b. 1815, Segovia, Spain — d. 1897,
Madrid, Spain), for example, was a noted Orientalist and
Spanish philologist who specialized in Semitic and Indo-
European languages. He completed his higher education in
Munich under the wings of such eminent Orientalists of the
time as Müller, Haug, Ethé, Haneberg, etc.

As a scholar, he at various times held chairs in the history of
philosophy, metaphysics, Greek, Sanskrit, world history, and
German.

As a writer, he was famous for, among other works, El
estudio de la filología en su relación con el sanskrit [The Study
of Philology in Relation to Sanskrit] (Madrid) and Ensayo
crítico de gramática comparada de los idiomas indo-europeos
[A Critical Essay on the Comparative Grammar of Indo-
European Languages] (Madrid), along with numerous
translations.

In 1876, he published Irán o del Indo al Tigris [Iran or From
the Indus to the Tigris]24, in which, in his narrative of the
history of Persia, García closed the book with a nearly five-page
summary of Bábí history and doctrine. All of his source
material is taken from Count Gobineau’s Les Religions et les
Philosophies dans l’Asie Centrale.

It is worth mentioning that García Ayuso founded and
directed a language academy in Madrid in which Persian and
other languages were taught. It is more than likely that
Rivadeneyra, who we discussed earlier, and who was a personal
friend of García’s, learned the rudiments of Persian in his
academy.

Also in 1876, in a work titled La Cuestión de Oriente [On the
Question of the Orient]25, Emilio Castelar (b. 1832, Cádiz,
Spain — d. 1899, San Pedro del Pinatar, Spain), briefly
mentions Babism in the chapter titled Una Religión Decadente
[A Religion in Decline], in which he is critical of Islam and its

apologists and defenders in Europe. He writes in a jocular
tone:

> Our continent produces commentators of dogmas
> only; but the Asian continent, in its ingenuity and
> essence, produces the dogmas themselves. This
> exuberance of the Asiatic intellect continues unabated.
> Whereas here we sacrifice our lives in pursuit of
> establishing States or to fight for our wages, over there
> they fight and sacrifice themselves in pursuit of
> religious beliefs and metaphysical abstractions.
> Penitents still pray in self-imposed exile, prophets
> preach in the wilderness, sons of God descend from the
> heavens, and idealism’s martyrs irrigate and fertilize
> the earth with their blood. The founder of Babism in
> Persia finds neither judges nor executioners among the
> Muslims, and he would not have died a martyr’s death
> had not Nestorian fanatics killed him. There, from
> amid the founders of religions, quickly spreads the
> poetic genius that transports them away from their
> mundane sorrows to deify them in the heavens.26
The reference in itself contains little of value, but it acquires
relevance when we stop to consider that it was written by one
of Spain’s most notable nineteenth century politicians.

Emilio Castelar held the chair in history at the Universidad
Central de Madrid, and he was the founder and director of the
republican newspaper La Democracia. In 1869, he was elected
to Spain’s Parliamant as a deputy and, with the establishment
of the republic, was appointed Minister of State, a position he
held until being elected President of the Government. He was
the last president of the first Spanish republic. Following the
establishment of the monarchy and an exile lasting several
years, he returned to political life as a Parliamentary deputy.

In addition, Castelar authored numerous historical essays,
novels, and newspaper articles, and was a member of the Real
Academia de la Lengua Española.

The paragraph quoted above was republished inside an
article that Castelar had published in December 1895 as part of

a section he collaborated on regularly for the journal La España
Moderna. 27

Another author worth mentioning in this brief summary is
Joan Montserrat i Archs (b. 1895, Barcelona(?), Spain), a
Catalonian poet and engineer who, in 1882, mentioned the Báb
in a pull-out section entitled El Mundo Ilustrado,28 describing
him as “the new Muslim Luther.” His brief summary of Babism,
once again, is based on Gobineau’s account.

We know little about this man beyond that, despite the
political obstacles that the nineteenth century presented him,
he was a determined author in prose and poetry in the
Catalonian tongue.

Reference Works

In another installment we mentioned two encyclopedias that
early on made mention of Babism in Spain: La Enciclopedia
Moderna (1854) and Diccionario Universal (1876).

During the decades this article focuses on, the number of
reference works containing any mention of the new religion
multiplied considerably. Volume 3 (published in 1888) of El
Diccionario Enciclopédico Hispano-Americano, for example,
contained entries for “Báb,” “Babism,” and “Bábí,” the first
two of which had rather lengthy articles. Volume 15 (published
in 1894) mentions Babism again, this time as part of a
description of Persian history.

It is difficult to find a dictionary or encyclopedia published
in that time frame that did not contain entries for “Babism” or
“Bábí,” although no work acquired the prestige and popularity
accorded the Diccionario Enciclopédico.

***

In 1896, Násiri’d-Dín Sháh was assassinated. The king’s
murder received extensive coverage in the Spanish press, as it
did in other parts of the world. The unjust accusations leveled
against the Bábís (Bahá’ís) for that crime allowed equally
extensive press coverage of the new religion comparable only to

— albeit to a much lesser degree — that which attended the
events of 1852.

This topic will be explored in a future installment.
