Language and Universalization
A “Linguistic Ecology” Reading of Bahá’í Writ

Gregory Paul P. Meyjes

Abstract
In this article, interpretation of Bahá’í writings regarding language, cultural diversity, and worldwide
communication leads to the seemingly paradoxical position that the promotion of linguistic minority rights
in must coincide with promotion of an International Auxiliary Language (IAL). Opposing trends toward
increased globalization and growing nationalism are noted and their concurrence explained. The notion of
“cultural justice” is expounded and the unregulated global spread of English today critically assessed in its
light. By contrast, from the perspective of Bahá’í writ, IAL emerges as a language intended to facilitate
worldwide communication without unduly impinging on humankind’s native linguistic traditions. Thus,
Bahá’í writings appear to support a worldwide linguistic ecology better planned, more equitable, less prone
to precipitous change, and more cognizant of the singular role of language in humanity‘s individual and
collective identity.

Résumé
Dans le présent article, l’interprétation des Écrits bahá’ís concernant la langue, la diversité culturelle et la
communication sur le plan mondial, mêne au point de vue apparemment paradoxal selon lequel la
promotion des droits linguistiques minoritaires doit coïncider: avec la promotion d’une langue auxiliaire
internationale. La concurence entre la mondialisation croissante en la montée du nationalisme est ensuite
soulignée et expliquée. Puis, la notion de justice culturelle est développée, afin de fournir un contexte où
analyser di façon critique l’expansion globale effrénée de l’anglais à l’heure actuelle. Par contraste, la
langue internationale auxiliaire émerge des Écrits bahá’ís comme une langue qui vise à faciliter la
communication mondiale sans toutefois empiéter sur les traditions linguistiques natives de l’humainité.
Ainsi, les Écrits bahá’ís semblent appuyer une écologie linguistique mondiale mieux planifíee, plus
équitable, moins sujette à les changements abruptes ct qui reconnaîl davantage le rôle particulier que la
langue joue par rapport à l’identité individuelle et collective l’humanité.

Resumen
En este artículo, la interpretación de los escritos bahá’ís en lo que se refiere a idioma, diversidad cultural, y
comunicación mundial nos encamina hacia la posición paradójica de que la promoción de derechos
minoritarios linguísticos necesariamente coincide con la promoción de un Idioma Auxiliar Internacional
(IAI). Se toma en cuenta y se explican las corrientes opuestas del ensanche de la globalización y el aumenlo
del nacionalismo. Se amplía el concepto de “justicia cultural” y se escruta a su luz el esparcimiento global
descontrolado del inglés. En contraste, la IAI emerge del mandato bahá’í como un idioma que busca
facilitar la comunicación mundial sin impactar en las tradiciones linguísticas autóctonas de la humanidad.
Por esto, los escritos bahá’ís parecen apoyar una ecología linguística mundial mejor diseñado, mas
equitativo, menos dispuesto a cambios repentinos, y más conocedor del rol único del idioma en la identidad
colectiva e individual de la humanidad.

—Bahá’u’lláh, Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh Revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
T    he paramount challenge of multiculturalism today lies in ensuring harmonious relations between

dominant and nondominant groups, whereby “dominance” can occur at levels ranging from local to
global. Indeed, our increasingly interdependent and transcultural planet has created more opportunity than
ever before for confrontation and conflict over language, ethnicity, and religion—the foremost
determinants of any culture’s values, whether within or among sovereign states. For instance, not to
appreciate the significance of societal multilingualism to the identity and political reality of most of
humankind, is to underestimate the paramount role of language to many of humanity’s most cherished
assets, i.e., its values, thoughts, and feelings of group adherence. It is no surprise that the degree to which
the cultural priorities of our still numerous1 linguistic minorities are treated seriously represents a
significant key to many societies’ success at achieving longer-term stability, greater unity, higher overall
standards of living, and fuller participation in the international community. As argued below, to negotiate
issues of linguistic dominance effectively is essential for all of humankind to achieve sustained peace and
stability.

Reflecting humanity’s evolution toward ever greater oneness—a notion pivotal to Bahá’í
doctrine—language has contributed much to the consolidation of ever larger political aggregates, from
tribes, city-states, and principalities to states in the contemporary sense. In today’s postcolonial world,
traditional nation-states are outnumbered by states comprising multiple ethnocultural “nations.” State-level
control over matters of language and culture is frequently inhibited by the dynamics of substate nationalism,
or that of a suprastate world order, or both. In fact, at the current stage in world history, two concurrent.
intensifying, and opposing processes—globalization2 and localization—have been repeatedly noted (e.g.,
Fishman, “Summary and Interpretation” 639).

Unfortunately, linguistic globalization is frequently viewed with suspicion by anthropologists and
sociolinguists. It is often perceived as an evil that runs counter to the cultural interests of local, indigenous,
or minority3 language groups. The position represented in this article, however, is that such conflict need
not and in fact should not exist. All depends on how tensions between the twin processes of globalization
and increased local assertiveness are negotiated. What follows, then, is a Bahá’í-inspired view of global
linguistic ecology, a reading of Bahá’í writings that supports the seemingly paradoxical position that the
safeguarding of linguistic minority rights can, and indeed must, go hand in hand with the promotion and
choice of an International Auxiliary Language (IAL) for worldwide communication. The notion of
“cultural justice” is central here, whereby “justice” is seen in a manner contrasting. yet not conflicting, with
that in “Whither the International Auxiliary Language?’ by Phyllis Chew.

Culture and Justice
One of the few twentieth-century linguists known to embrace the IAL issue was the American Edward
Sapir (e.g., “The Function of an International Auxiliary Language”). Presaging the views of later social
theorists such as Bourdieu (The Logic of Practice), Sapir saw “culture” as the set of values, customs,
institutions, and commodities that most significantly characterize a community’s identity, i.e., the “spirit”
or “genius” that distinguishes it from others. Among the combined ideational and material factors thus
defining culture, Sapir considered the nonmaterial ones most important, i.e., those that spring from values
(“Culture, Genuine and Spurious”). Bahá’í writings, too, teach that the spiritual and social lives of human
beings are inextricably linked. Shoghi Effendi explains, “We cannot segregate the human heart from the
environment outside us. . . . Man is organic with the world. His inner life moulds the environment and is
itself also deeply affected by it. The one acts upon the other . . .” (from a letter written on behalf of Shoghi
Effendi to an individual believer, qtd. in Conservation of the Earth’s Resources 15). Indeed, we can affirm
the appropriateness of Sapir’s interpretation of culture as the way in which our inner values interact with
those values of the society that affect us most, and with the behaviors, customs, and institutions that society
deems most significant. Thus culture, as the nexus of humans’ socially acquired value set, is connected to
our underlying spiritual essence, which, according to Bahá’í writings, is quintessentially the same for all
humans, a notion often associated with the work of French anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss (e.g.,
Structural Anthropology).

But what of the cultural significance of language, the relation between language and values?

Elucidating the paramount significance of language to culture and validating Sapir’s notion of culture,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá reportedly called language the most profound characteristic of a people, the garment of the
spirit of the people (Fallscheer, “Aus dem Schatz”). This lends credence to another of Sapir’s views,
inspired by his mentor Franz Boas, that of language as the primary pillar of culture, the greatest socializing

force (Duranti, Linguistic Anthropology 52ff.), for “a common speech serves as a peculiarly potent symbol
of the social solidarity” of its speakers as a group (Sapir, “Language” 15).

By appreciating the paramount role of language for the identity of humanity’s countless speech
communities, we better grasp the significance of such concepts as “language rights,” or “linguistic human
rights,” as formulated in the 1996 Universal Declaration (Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights).
Indeed, the Declaration’s premise that such cultural rights are both collective and individual, inseparable
and interdependent (Universal Declaration 4), is buttressed by the above Bahá’í quotations on the
intertwinedness of our inner and social lives. Sapir, too, emphasized that language was not just essential to
the group, but to the individual as well, regarding language as the most significant element for the growth
of individual identity (“Language” 17). The connection between language and individual identity is another
assertion Bahá’í writings confirm, such as in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ s statement on language as the encryptor of the
human heart: “The heart is like a box, and language is the key. Only by using the key can we open the box
and observe the gems it contains” (Promulgation 60).

On the basis of Bahá’í writings on the essential role of language and culture to the human
condition, it is argued here that Bahá’í principles support an interpretation of language rights as basic and
inalienable human rights. Language rights, rather than being mere ethical or political options, emerge from
this reading of Bahá’í writings as a matter of fundamental justice, of “cultural justice.” Justice, in turn, is
the principal prerequisite for societal harmony and stability. Indeed, Bahá’u’lláh clarifies that the “purpose
of justice is the appearance of unity among men” (Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh 67). “The organization of the
world and the tranquillity of mankind depend upon it” (qtd. in Shoghi Effendi, Advent of Divine Justice 28).
As discussed below, this concurs with Bahá’í teachings on the purpose of IAL.

Cultural Minorities
There can be no doubt as to the universalist orientation of the Bahá’í dispensation. The oneness of
humankind is the single most overriding notion in Bahá’í social teachings, in Shoghi Effendi’s words, “the
pivot round which all the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh revolve . . .” (World Order of Bahá’u’lláh 42).
Bahá’u’lláh proclaims: “The distinguishing feature that marketh the preeminent character of this Supreme
Revelation consisteth in that We have . . . laid down the essential prerequisites of concord, of understanding,
of complete and enduring unity” (Gleanings 97). That this universalist Bahá’í ideology includes matters of
global communication is evidenced by Bahá’í teachings on IAL. The Universal House of Justice explains
that “Bahá’u’lláh enjoins the adoption of a universal language and script. His Writings envisage two stages
in this process. The first stage is to consist of the selection of an existing language or an invented one which
would then be . . . an auxiliary to the mother tongues . . . The second stage, in the distant future, would be
the eventual adoption of one single language and common script for all on earth” (Kitáb-i-Aqdas n.193).

Yet Bahá’í doctrine combines this unequivocally universalist disposition with great emphasis on
the value of cultural diversity. Shoghi Effendi states that “the world-wide Law of Bahá’u’lláh. . . . does not
ignore, nor does it attempt to suppress, the diversity of ethnical origins, of climate, of history, of language
and tradition, of thought and habit, that differentiate the peoples and nations of the world . . . . It repudiates
excessive centralization on one hand, and disclaims all attempts at uniformity on the other. Its watchword is
unity in diversity . . .” (World Order 41–42). Thus, vis-à-vis minorities, Bahá’í teachings explicitly
encourage an attitude of consideration, appreciation, and protection against undue oppression. The
Universal House of Justice stresses that to “discriminate against any tribe because they are in a minority is
a violation of the spirit that animates the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. As followers . . . it is our obligation to
protect the just interests of any minority element within the Bahá’í Community. In fact in the
administration of our Bahá’í affairs, representatives of minority groups are not only enabled to enjoy equal
rights and privileges, but they are even favored and accorded priority” (qtd. in Lights of Guidance 529–30).

In this context, it is helpful to consider the perspective of linguistic minority groups. In both
developed and developing countries, such groups tend to experience very considerable pressures on their
languages, often with concomitant political and/or socioeconomic pressure to assimilate or to become
marginalized. They generally experience conflict, at times violent, between their need for primary identity
and group adherence on one hand, and the risks and rewards of participation in larger, transcultural
institutions, markets, and identities on the other. The less dominant the group, the more its members are
thought to experience pressure to become multilingual, and indeed multicultural, to “re-ethnify and
relinguify in the direction of the more powerful reward-systems that surround them” (Fishman, “On the
Limits of Ethnolinguistic Democracy” 59–60). While there is no reason to assume that nondominant group
members pursue social, material, and spiritual well-being less than others, there are often limits to their

willingness to assimilate linguistically, even at the price of relative ostracism. Indeed, the pressures of
globalization frequently appear to heighten the need for cultural resistance on the part of less powerful
language groups, while simultaneously providing them with added means with which to assert local
languages and cultures. A view arising from research on cultural resistance among linguistic minority
groups (e.g., Meyjes, “On the Status of Creole in Guadeloupe”) is that oppression, discrimination, coerced
assimilation, and the like intensify rather than decrease such resistance. Conversely, the extent to which a
group perceives itself as having achieved cultural emancipation correlates with its openness to bilingualism,
biculturalism, and even its de facto assimilation. This is not surprising. When we think of Bahá’u’lláh’s
principle of the independent search for truth, we realize that values best evolve from within. To place
pressures on a group that contrast with its values, is to invite resistance. The less acceptable the pressure,
the deeper the resistance. For such is the function of values, that they act as yardsticks for the acceptability
of behaviors and conditions. This applies to the great majority of language communities in the world today,
which tend to speak nonofficial, substate languages. Indeed, sociolinguists would agree with Phillipson et
al. that only speakers of official languages “enjoy all linguistic human rights” (Linguistic Human Rights 2).

Against this backdrop, the question of minority language rights gains in poignancy. Bahá’í
scriptures point to achievement of a harmonious linguistic ecology, world cultural relations in which
dominant and nondominant language needs—be they local, national, regional, or universal—are effectively
and justly balanced. But how should the perceived paradox between concern for the cultural integrity of
minorities and the call for an IAL be resolved? Are not the alien, global, and universal patently at odds with
the indigenous, the local, and the culturally specific? How are we to achieve a Bahá’í-inspired vision of
cultural justice in matters of language?

Organic Development
Shoghi Effendi explains that humanity is currently witnessing the final stage in its evolution from the
family, the tribe, the city-state, and sovereign nations to this, the dawn of the oneness of humankind
through the “gradual diffusion of the spirit of world solidarity which is spontaneously arising out of the
welter of a disorganized society” (World Order 44). It is noteworthy that he mentions disorganization, for,
in matters of linguistic ecology, the unregulated and yet unprecedentedly dominant role of English today is
particularly relevant. Like no other language before, English reflects globalization and the dynamics thereof
(see, for example, Kachru, The Other Tongue; Pennycook, Cultural Politics of English; or Phillipson,
Linguistic Imperialism). Going beyond the status of other international languages or intercultural lingua
francas, English has become, especially since World War II, the preferred global language of trade,
diplomacy, science and technology, finance, popular culture, air-traffic control, the United Nations,
telecommunications, scholarly journals, and so on. it has clone so, without having the greatest number of
native speakers, by virtue of its paramount geographic distribution among the world’s middle classes.

From a Bahá’í viewpoint, one may be inclined to welcome this course of events and to interpret
them as reflecting universalist Bahá’í teachings, notably regarding IAL. Besides, in Robertson’s terms, the
“macrostructurarion of world order” witnessed today is a patently complex process not credibly reducible
to mere Western imperialism, cultural or otherwise (“Mapping the Global Condition” 22). However, it is to
be questioned whether the spread of English today reflects Bahá’í standards of cultural justice, language
rights, and the gradual emergence of a truly universal culture. The prevailing globalization of both English
and Occidental culture in the world today may well he more symptomatic of the “disorganization” than of
the “unity” referred to in the above quotation. Indeed, the onward march of English is often considered
unstoppable, and the emergence of local varieties of so-called Englishes is touted as evidence that English
is spread in a culturally nonimperialistic manner. Is, however, such unchecked linguistic globalization truly
in the interest of world unity? Or is the resistance it generates on the part of certain nondominant groups
symptomatic of grave, though perhaps largely unintended, cultural injustice? The aforementioned
Declaration, and the documents preceding it, were a response to humanity’s experience with forcefully
imposing dominant languages on speakers of nondominant languages (Universal Declaration 6–10).
Especially in (post)colonial settings, superlanguage English has often been granted official language status
next to or above indigenous language(s). Yet considerable tensions often persist between competing
demands: local versus countrywide identity, local versus foreign values, narrower versus broader
community, indigenous language versus English—a struggle often favoring English, touted by the
influential classes as the language of science, unity, and (post)modernization (e.g., Dua, “The Spread of
English in India”).

For IAL to come into use at the cost of cultural displacement and cultural imposition directly
conflicts with Bahá’í views on diversity and the cultural rights of minorities. Those promoting English as
an international language today should consider Sapir’s admonition that “the deliberate attempt to impose a
culture directly and speedily, no matter how backed by good will, is an affront to the human spirit”
(“Culture” 328). In matters of communication, the result of the current precipitous and “disorganized”
worldwide trend is unlikely to be justice or unity in diversity. Rather, it is likely to lead to the very situation
witnessed today, namely, unreflected “globalization” on the one hand and widespread struggles for the
maintenance of cultural specificity on the other. Indeed, the very expeditiousness of the current globalizing
process is ominous, as stable and tme world unity is likely to require a just, gradual, and harmonious
process of what could be termed “universalization” as opposed to the explosion in various forms of one
linguistic tradition throughout the world. Universalization thus perceived would be a process of world
unification in which all cultures can participate and contribute in an environment of supportiveness and
nonoppression. Only such a process would be in keeping with the twin Bahá’í axioms of valuing diversity
and achieving ever greater unity. For uniformity tends not to equal unity; globalization may well preclude
true universalization; and cultural power easily excludes cultural justice.

Language rights as justified here are not based on the often-evoked “biodiversity” argument,
however appealing, that “the perpetuation and cultivation of both linguistic and cultural diversity is
essential for the growth of knowledge and development of human faculties just as biodiversity is essential
for the survival of the planet and for economic growth” (Dua, Introduction). Nor does such concern for
language rights spring from nostalgia for maintaining the linguistic patrimonies of minorities. The goal is
not forever to freeze past or current levels of cultural specificity as an end in itself. The goal, rather, is to
enable a heterogeneous humanity to succeed in gradually and harmoniously establishing a new universal
identity and cultural modus vivendi. Shoghi Effendi describes “. . . one organic commonwealth, one vast,
unified, and harmoniously functioning system” (World Order 193), “. . . in which all nations, races, creeds
and classes are closely and permanently united, and in which the autonomy of its state members and the
personal freedom and initiative of the individuals that compose them are definitely and completely
safeguarded” (World Order 203).

From a Bahá’í vantage point, the eventual emergence of world unity is divinely ordained, and,
therefore, it is considered inevitable that cultural change ultimately take place in the direction of
universalization. The quality of both the process and the outcome, however, is for the intervening
generations to realize. It is, in the words of Fishman, “the responsibility of the largest and most secure
languages to respond constructively and magnanimously to this universal problem in human cultural-
ecology” (“On the Limits” 60–61). The idea is not that language and culture be denied change, or that
language shift or language loss be disallowed—if this were practicable. The idea is that whatever cultural
change takes place not be imposed, for this would ultimately defeat the purpose of sustainable unity.
Certain familiar terms may come to mind in this context, such as the need for cultural “self-determination,”
or ethnolinguistic “democracy”4 (Fishman, “On the Limits”), or other concepts laden with historical
meaning. Yet in view of the perceived uniqueness of humanity’s unified future, a new terminology may be
required. After all, a Bahá’í vision of the future world, Shoghi Effendi asserts, “. . . calls for a wider loyalty,
for a larger aspiration than any that has animated the human race . . . . implies an organic change in the
structure of present-day society, a change such as the world has not yet experienced” (World Order 41–42,
43). Taking our cue from this quotation, we could call the kind of cultural change required “organic.” A
just linguistic ecology, then, is not “global” in the assimilationist5 sense. At the current stage of world
relations, termed that of humankind’ s burgeoning “maturity” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, qtd. in Shoghi Effendi, World
Order 165), the world’s nondominant communities need to be protected and cherished as a prerequisite to
the organic development of a world-embracing culture. This view is in harmony with Fishman (“On the
Limits”), who advocates negotiating the inevitable tensions between “narrower,” more local ethnolinguistic
identities and “broader,” more global ones. What is needed is to organize world communication such that it
is assured through IAL and that native languages and cultures are protected. But a Bahá’í-inspired view is
also open to eventual reassessments of today’s ecolinguistic priorities. It calls for flexibility, for with the
emergence of a universal culture, nourished and informed by protected local cultures, will eventually come
the age of universalism, as predicted in Bahá’í scripture. Ultimately, the choice of a single, nonauxiliary,
worldwide Universal Language (UL)6 is presaged, though those developments are far in the future. For the
foreseeable future, the just and gradual realization of cultural universalization requires an environment of
true diversity. As to the choice of either language, Bahá’í scriptures do not appear to indicate whether
linguistic similarity between IAL and UL need or need not exist.

It is in this context that our precise understanding of IAL becomes crucial. Bahá’í sacred texts
support the view of IAL not as the all-consuming language of disorganized and rampant globalization, but
rather the opposite, as a language to facilitate worldwide communication precisely without unduly
impinging on humanity’s native linguistic traditions. Thus understood, IAL is both a channel for global
communication and a buffer to oppression from an aggressive global language such as English in this day
and age. Thus, Bahá’u’lláh states, humanity would be “acquiring only two languages, one their own native
tongue, the other the language in which all the peoples of the world would converse” (Epistle to Son of the
Wolf 138). Some scriptural evidence for the deliberately restricted role of IAL can be found in the
stipulation that this language “be taught in all the schools of the world as an auxiliary to the mother
tongues” (Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb-i-Aqdas, note 193). Exactly how much deference to local mother tongues this
implies may not at first be evident, but linguists agree that native tongues are intuitively “acquired” (see
Slobin, “Universal and Particular”), while subsequent language “learning” increasingly requires different
cognitive skills, resulting in different linguistic competence levels. It follows that to teach IAL as a subject
in schools—when the native tongue is well established—protects its status as secondary to that of
humanity’s mother tongues.7 Indeed, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá reportedly elucidated this aspect of the Bahá’í
teachings describing a native tongue as like the native air which we need for living, which surrounds us
from cradle to grave, which is and remains our most personal property, while comparing the common
world language to a bridge to the rest of the world (Fallscheer, “Aus dem Schatz”).

What then emerges is that Bahá’í scripture does not portray IAL as a lingua franca in the
traditional sense, a language merely used for practical reasons between speakers of different mother
tongues. It is both greater in stature and more formally limited in cultural power. It is greater, notably, in
that the Universal House of Justice stipulates it is to be selected by the collective “governments of the
world through their parliaments . . .” (Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb-i-Aqdas, note 193). On the one hand, this gives
IAL a standing significantly more regulated, stable, and world embracing than any traditional lingua franca,
such as Latin, French, Swahili, in various times and places in world history. On the other hand, the very
establishment of IAL as a secondary language not superimposed on primary languages precludes it from
unofficially invading communities by the mere power of its speakers, making it more formally limited in
cultural invasiveness than traditional lingua francas. By contrast, English as an international language today
has been faulted for not peacefully coexisting with less dominant languages (Dua, Hegemony of English),
thus marginalizing and even supplanting less dominant languages. The very status of English as an
unregulated global superlanguage makes it a suspect contender for IAL, as its dynamic bodes ill for
linguistic minority rights. Indeed, it is in the face of the current unchecked dynamic of English, that the
choice of any IAL has become a matter of increasing urgency. In the process of selecting a particular IAL,
political and other societal criteria threaten to outweigh linguistic criteria, so as to render the latter criteria
moot. Yet rather than accept the possible irrelevance of linguistic grounds for choosing a particular IAL as
a foregone conclusion, a position more in keeping with Bahá’í guidance may well be to support research
into the optimal choice of IAL, as argued in a forthcoming paper on IAL selection criteria by this author.

Summary
The Bahá’í-inspired position represented here, then, is that IAL and language rights are more than just “not
incompatible.” They depend on each other, and it is seen as a particular challenge of cultural politics today
that the two be made to coexist sensibly. In the interest of protecting language rights, the selection of any
IAL is pressing. Lingua francas create and have created a world of unprecedented language death, great
intercultural stresses and confrontations, ubiquitous borderlands and partial identities. By contrast, the
above Bahá’í-inspired perspective offers a just remedy against the cultural confusion and destruction that
unbridled linguistic globalization, albeit to varying degrees, evidently imposes on nondominant speech
communities. Bahá’í principles as interpreted here are intended to generate a linguistic ecology more world
embracing, more stable, more surveyable, and far less violent vis-à-vis nondominant languages, whether at
substate or interstate levels. The goal is neither to prejudice developments against the eventual emergence
of UL, nor to hamper the process of the lasting unification of humankind, On the contrary, the position
taken here is that Bahá’í writings regarding language, culture, diversity, social change, and global
communication are intended to foster relations among speech communities that are less prone to
precipitous change, more inclusive, better planned, more equitable, and more cognizant of the singular role
of language in humanity’s individual and collective identity. It is thought that such an approach would best
promote the Bahá’í objective of peace through justice, in the interest of a richer and deeper unity of
humankind. Rather than advocate current trends in unilateral linguistic globalization, the above

interpretation of Bahá’í writ supports a more stable, two-tiered view of global linguistic ecology, such that
for the foreseeable future international communication be conducted by a yet-to-be-selected IAL,
occupying a position nonthreatening to native languages and enabling primary speech communities to
contribute gradually, peacefully, and organically to the evolution of a richly diverse and dynamic world
civilization. Only then, it is believed, will cultural justice be served such that IAL, as stipulated in
Bahá’u’lláh’s Kitáb-i-Aqdas will truly become “the cause of unity . . . and the greatest instrument for
promoting harmony and civilization. . .” (88).

Notes

1. The reported number of languages spoken today varies considerably—from approximately 3,000

(Coulmas, Sprache und Staat 14–15) to 5,000 (Edwards, Multilingualism 1), to 6,000–7,000 (Phillipson et
al., Linguistic Human Rights 2), or exactly 6,703 (Grimes, Ethnologue). Paradoxically, despite the record
language mortality currently attested, languages are growing in number, as traditional definitions of
language/dialect continue to be challenged.

2. “Globalization” today, it has been suggested, is only partly a function of central state-level activity.

For a brief discussion of this frequently invoked, yet loosely defined concept, see Robertson (“Mapping the
Global Condition”).

3. The term “minority” is stretched here to include nondominance not only of small speech-
communities but also of any language group, even larger suprastate ones, as long as its speech community
is subjected to undue external sociolinguistic pressures.

4. A difficulty with evaluating cultural imposition is that nondominant groups, or elements thereof,
may themselves desire it, to gain access to the dominant culture. Such groups may believe they can
simultaneously retain their primary culture and gain access to the dominant one (see Meyjes, “On the
Status” 92–93). Unfortunately, the naiveté of this position can become evident to the groups themselves
only after assimilation is no longer preventable or easily reversible.

5. See Reagan (“Fostering Language Rights as Human Rights”) for a recapitulation of relevant
language-planning theories.

6. Emphasis on UL appears inappropriate at the current stage of world cultural development because
as explained above (a) the selection of UL is sociopolitically irrelevant for the foreseeable future, (b) the
protection of local language rights through selection of 1AL requires urgent attention, and (c) the protection
of language rights precedes the organic development toward UL.

7. As pointed out by Pei, IAL learnability concerns primarily adults (One Language for the World 70,
187–88). If IAL transmission to children were the goal, methods more effective than teaching it in schools
are imaginable, confirming the notion that Bahá’í teachings favor protection of native languages. On IAL
simplicity/learnability, see, tor example, Meyjes, “The Choice ot an Auxiliary Language.”
