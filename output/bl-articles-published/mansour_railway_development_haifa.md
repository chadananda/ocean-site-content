The Ottoman government viewed Haifa as the Hijaz railway’s optimal access point
to the sea due to the city’s strategic location granting it advantages over other coastal
cities. It was deemed preferable to Akko, whose status and role were in decline.

The decision to make Haifa the railway’s outlet to the Mediterranean Sea required
extending a secondary line from Dar’a in Syria to Haifa in Palestine for a total length
of 161 kilometres. The extension of this line was not only meant to enable the delivery
of the materials and equipment necessary to construct the Hijaz railway, but also to
facilitate the transport of Muslim pilgrims via the Haifa Port to the Hijaz. In addition,
the secondary line from Dar’a to Haifa formed a superior route for the transport of the
crops and products of the Houran province in Syria to Europe via the Haifa Port. This
province was rich in all varieties of grains. In addition, Palestinian exports to Europe,
particularly citrus, were on the rise around this time.1

Transport through Haifa Port thus increased–the amount of goods imported and
exported via the port multiplied. With the extension of the Hijaz railway to Haifa, the
city was connected to Damascus and the regions of Houran and eastern Jordan, among
others, turning it into a bona fide port city. The crops of these regions, particularly
grains, were exported via Haifa while European and American goods and products
needed by the regions were imported.

Prior to this development, exports and imports had been transported via the Beirut port
and an extremely difficult mountain road connecting it to Syria. The Damascus-Dar’a-
Haifa, line, in contrast, mainly passed through level areas. Another advantage provided
by the Haifa port was that it allowed the Ottoman government to fulfil its wish to
rid itself of the French monopoly over the Beirut-Damascus line, which controlled
commercial shipping and transport.2

A further contribution to the rising status of Haifa was the Turkish government’s
decision to build the administrative headquarters of the Hijaz railway in Haifa.
Maintenance workshops for the trains were built close to the general administration
buildings, most of which remain standing to this day.

The Hijaz railway project played a prominent role in the development of Haifa from
several perspectives. The following is an outline of the most significant developments.

Population Increase

The introduction of the railway contributed to driving internal migration (within
Palestine and the neighbouring regions) to Haifa in search of work, which increased
the city’s population. Many historians and researchers who have studied the late
Ottoman period believe that numerous factors played a role in the development
and flourishing of Haifa; the railway’s share among those factors was definitely
significant.3

It is worth pointing out that the population increase in Haifa came not only at the
hands of the labourers who arrived to work for the railway, but also those who came
to work in other agencies in the city that had a direct or indirect relationship to the
railway. The German deputy consul in Haifa, Keller, indicated in 1903 that the city
was witnessing a large population increase as a result of the railway extension project.
Various statistics have shown the population of Haifa in 1800 at approximately 1,000,
in 1860 to have reached about 3,000, and by 1880 risen to approximately 6,000.4 By
1905, the year the railway between Dar’a and Haifa was opened, Haifa’s population
had reached approximately 15,000. By 1914, its population had risen to 23,000.

During the period from 1903 to 1908, the railway project was considered the largest
source of employment in Haifa.5 Construction of the railway provided employment
opportunities for hundreds of employees, labourers, and engineers who settled in
the city and contributed to its population increase.6 The records of the Islamic court
in Haifa make reference to a Tawfiq bin Shaaban from the Siwas state employed by
the Hijazi railway in Haifa; a Mahmoud Azmi, a clerk for the Hijazi railway from
Istanbul, and a Hamza bin Ma’shuq Al Jerksi from al-Qanitra, employed also by
the railway.7 These are samples of immigrants from Turkey and Syria who travelled
to Haifa to live and work. They generally worked as employees in the various
administrative offices such as the railway department, the military department and the
local police department. As for those who emigrated from Syrian cities, most were
employed as instructors in Haifa’s government schools.8

Jerusalem Quarterly 28 [ 7 ]
As for Haifa’s population increase during the late Ottoman period, it rose by 1.76

percent among Muslims, a rate higher than the annual average increase for Muslim
residents of Palestine, which was 0.5 percent. This increase was the result of
immigration to Haifa and not a natural rise in the birth rate alone. As for Christian
residents, their population rose between 1905 and 1909 by 3.3 percent, 1.5 percent
of which was natural growth and the rest of which was the result of immigration to
Haifa.9 Between 1903 and 1912, i.e. beginning with the arrival of the railway to Haifa,
the city’s population grew by 6.6 percent.10 In the first British census of 1922, Haifa’s
population was calculated at approximately 24,600. On the eve of WWI, in 1914, its
population was approximately 20,000.

It is clear that the rapid increase in the city’s population in comparison to the other
three coastal Palestinian cities (Jaffa, Akko, and Gaza) was an indication of a bright
future awaiting Haifa, most significantly on economic terms in which it made
indisputable gain.11

The Development of Haifa Port

The port in Haifa grew unsuitable for the transportation and commercial activities the
railway imposed on it, and thus the Haifa municipality and other concerned authorities
decided to construct a new one. The Ottoman Sultan charged the German architect
Meissner Pasha12 with planning the port and overseeing its works with the goal of
transforming it into a port superior to that of Beirut, which was used by the French
train company with exclusivity rights over the Damascus-Mizyrib line that competed
with the Dar’a-Haifa line.

After considering the task, Meissner Pasha came to the conclusion that the general
administration of the Hijaz railway would not be able to extend the line to Haifa and
construct a port at the same time. All it could do, he determined, was to expand the
extant port to aid the safe docking of ships. Thus a special dockyard was built near the
end of the railway, costing approximately a million Turkish liras.13 Haifa’s old port,
which had been built by the Austrian company Luweid, was still available for the use
of steam ships in addition to the new dockyard built by the railway administration to
the east to house ships and the offloading of freight. Travellers could disembark at
this dockyard even during storms and strong winds because it was much more secure
and safe than the old one.14 A final Turkish attempt was made to construct a large port
in Haifa in 1914, once again through the railway administration, but the breakout of
WWI and the Turkish government’s preoccupation with war efforts, ascription and
fighting put an end to this aspiration.

Extension of the Dar’a-Haifa line required massive quantities of construction materials
and equipment. Each kilometre of the railway on this line exceeded the general cost
of each kilometre of the Damascus-Medina line, due to the difficulty of some of the
regions it traversed on the way to Haifa. Some believe that the costs of extending the
line to Haifa exceeded that of other lines by more than 40 percent. And thus Haifa
Port was a source of employment for the massive numbers of labourers who worked at
unloading the shipments designated for the railway extension.

The materials that were unloaded at Haifa Port for the railway’s construction included
steel rails produced in Belgium weighing up to 16,000 tons annually, and stone coal
that in 1906 weighed approximately 30,000 tons. Trains and carriages produced in
various European countries were also unloaded at the port to be used on the railway.

All of these materials and goods related to the railway arrived via the Haifa Port, yet
they were not restricted to use on the Dar’a-Haifa line. In actuality, materials and other
necessities required to complete the line from Dar’a to Medina were also brought in
through Haifa Port.

The port’s facilities, including docking, unloading, storage, and shipment, provided
numerous employment opportunities to Haifa’s population and its new immigrants
arriving from all over Palestine and neighbouring regions. Other employment
indirectly connected to the port including providing foodstuffs and meals to the
ships, as well as paper, ropes and other necessities. During that period in particular,
Haifa was known as the “mother of work” due to its being the city most successful
in supplying work for its residents.15 The railway played a central role in redirecting
commerce from Akko to Haifa, which led to an increase in Haifa’s tariff revenues (and
a decline in Akko’s).16

At the beginning of the British mandate period in Palestine, the British strategic
decision to construct a modern port in Haifa stemmed from purely colonialist
considerations without addressing any local interests in Palestine. What the British
government and its military leaders took into consideration was the presence of the
railway at the port and the city’s location, particularly its coast and dockyards.

The British government’s decision to construct a port in Haifa was one of the primary
motives for a large population influx as immigrants sought to make a living in Haifa’s
shops, factories and other various outlets.17

Economic Development

The economic sector developed significantly following the extension of the railway
between Dar’a and Haifa. In addition to the Turkish government’s decision to make
Haifa the general headquarters of its Hijaz railway, the railway itself and the port
provided many employment opportunities. At the same time, merchants were able to
benefit from these two important economic institutions due to the commercial activity
they brought to the city and the successful building of a trade network with grain
merchants in southern Syria’s Houran province to export their crops via Haifa Port.
Until the extension of the Dar’a-Haifa line, Akko had been the primary beneficiary

Railway.

of Houran’s crops, a large proportion of which had been exported via Akko Port and
another percentage through Beirut Port, which was reached via the Beirut-Damascus-
Mizyarib railway line.

This transformation, so beneficial to Haifa, took place in 1905 when the Dar’a-Haifa
railway was opened. The transport of crops from Houran to Haifa was simplified by
the railway services that delivered products to the port where they were packed and
exported to determined destinations, particularly Europe. The Turkish authorities
doubled the length of the Haifa port to enable it to absorb the large commercial ships
arriving there. Yet the Turks did not complete their work–that was done by the English
after they occupied Haifa and the rest of Palestine at the end of WWI.18

Various economic subsidiaries related to the port and railway, known as
“complimentary services”, also flourished. These included, for example, construction
and small commercial shops within the city such as groceries, cloth and furniture
outlets, restaurants, small hotels, and the like.

Haifa welcomed thousands of Muslim pilgrims who arrived at the port and then
travelled on the railway to Dar’a and then on to the holy sites in the Hijaz to perform
their pilgrimage rites. They would stay in Haifa for only a few days, but the city’s
commercial and service interests benefited greatly from their presence. In actuality,
transit activity in Haifa played a significant role in activating the city’s commercial
flow, whether by those heading to the Hijaz or those returning from it.

The change in Haifa’s economic performance left its mark on both the productive and
consumptive behaviour of rural areas in inner Palestine. This can be traced back to the
Hijaz railway, which played a prominent role in commercial transport between Europe
and the Palestinian coast and then inner Palestine.19

The presence of the railway and port encouraged a number of investors to establish
small factories (or workshops, to be more precise) for the local production of sweets,
clothing, and wooden products. A series of agreements and official contracts were
signed to supply the railway with many of the materials it needed. Nasrallah bin Salim
al-Khoury was contracted to supply coal needed to run its steam trains.20 In 1915, the
Habayb family, which owned woods near Kafr Qar’ village, won the largest bid for
wood to supply the Hijaz railway.21

During the first two decades of the twentieth century, Haifa was able to attract
merchants from the Galilee and the areas of Nablus and Houran. One of the
motivating factors for their move was the Dar’a-Haifa railway. It is indisputable that
the development of the Turkish port and the extension of the railway to Haifa led to
a transformation of traditional economic activity (dominated by the feudal system) to a
modern economic model based on mutual export and import. The dominant traditional
economic structure in Palestine was thus gradually, and sometimes rapidly, replaced
with a more developed and progressive economic model.22

The report of al-Tamimi and Bajhat stated the following:

> In Haifa, there are 37 industrial buildings, including 10
> grinderies, 16 steam engines to draw water from wells, an
> ice plant, 7 wood factories, 4 olive oil factories and a cotton
> factory. The Germans established a grape juice plant and the
> Jews established a soap factory, but these two establishments
> have closed down recently.23

Prior to extension of the railway to the city, Haifa Port had been a small facility for
fishermen and a few small commercial ships. Its development was noticeable but
slow in comparison to the other changes that took place in the city. When the railway
extension was completed, the development of the port fell into line with the economic
and social demands forced by the new status quo. Without the railway’s demand for
economic and service facilities, the port would not have otherwise provided these
services.

When Turkish rule ended in Palestine and the rest of the Arab countries, the Arab
Syrian government led by Emir Faisal bin Sherif Hussein immediately saw to the
declaration of the importance of Haifa Port in supporting the Syrian economy and
ensuring the flow of transport between all Syrian territory, and, in following, the
development of Haifa itself. Al-‘Asima newspaper (the official newspaper of the Arab
Syrian government) wrote the following in its issue number 47, year 1, Damascus:
Monday 8 Dhu al-Qaeda 1337 H, 4 August 1919.

It is clear that this vision was based on facts the previous Turkish government had also
noted, proven by its extension of the Hijazi railway to Haifa as an important sea outlet
and the importance given to improving the state of the port. Yet WWI imposed new
realities that decreed the future of the Arab government of Syria led by King Faisal bin
Sherif Hussein. This government did not last for long; it and Faisal’s monarchic rule of
Syria were deposed of by the French in the battle of Mislon in 1920.

The railway between Damascus and Dar’a and Dar’a and Haifa had been under the
administration of this government, while the British and French armies deployed
throughout the Fertile Crescent regions in accordance with the interests agreed upon
by their two states. These interests included the division of the Ottoman Empire’s
territory as provided for in the Sykes-Picot agreement and then the resolutions of the
San Rimo convention, which affirmed French mandate of Syria and Lebanon and
British mandate of Palestine, eastern Jordan and Iraq.

Construction Development

Haifa was the site of vigorous construction activity starting in the late nineteenth
century. Many influences were the cause of this, most prominently the arrival of
the German Templars who settled there and in other locations in Palestine, as well
as the arrival of some European travellers to live and work in Haifa. The extension

and operation of the Dar’a-Haifa line played a primary role in invigorating the city’s
construction activity as an outcome of the immigration of labourers employed in the
railway’s various establishments. Investors from Lebanon, Syria and Palestine built
factories and shops in the city, and it thus expanded to the north from the eastern
station (the Hijaz railway station). This area was dotted with towering mansions,
gardens, and commercial stores.26

The number of European consuls in the city increased, such as the deputy German
consul and the Belgian, English and French consuls. The development of the city led
to an increase in their numbers, and in turn an increase in the number of Europeans in
the city. They constructed buildings for themselves and opened exchange banks and
other services for themselves and local residents. Haifa also began to attract Jewish
immigrants who, at first, settled in the Jewish quarter in the eastern section of the city
near the Hijaz railway station. They later began to build and strengthen their economy.

Construction expansion initially took place over a rectangular area stretching from the
eastern section of the city–i.e. from the train station west, or until Zeitoun street (now
Allenby street) and the Zoura’ area (Carmel station). Most residents of the western
section of the city were Christians, since they had previously come from the church
quarter in the western part of old walled Haifa (the city built by Dhahir al-‘Umr from
1761-1763 and walled from the Mediterranean in the north to al-Borj street in the
south and from Jaffa street in the west to the Hamam al-Pasha area in the east). Most
residents of the eastern section of the city were Muslims, as they had previously lived
in the eastern quarter of the old walled city.

During the British mandate period, construction expansion moved towards the
foothills across from the new port (i.e. the present port) that the English built in the
early 1930s. New buildings cropped up south of the Carmel foothills and up to the
mountain’s peak, in a southwest direction.27 European Christian missionary groups
showed increasing interest in investing in Haifa through the construction of education,
health and social institutions such as hospitals and schools.28

The municipality’s income increased through the construction activity in the city and
the fees and taxes imposed for building licenses and permits. This income began to
rise after the Hijaz railway began to operate in Haifa and the number of immigrants to
the city increased.29

The economic prosperity Haifa achieved due to the extension of the railway and
development of the port enticed the immigration of merchants and owners of capital
from Lebanon, Syria, and even Egypt and Europe. These wealthy immigrants left
their mark through architectural style: “Grandiose homes with numerous rooms and
consisting of two or three floors were built with polished stone and surrounded by
gardens on the eastern and western slopes of Mt. Carmel.”30

The development in construction also included internal road networks in Haifa.

The public works department undertook forging these roads in accordance with the
city planning law (during the British Mandate period). It focused on constructing a
remarkable road network within commercial centres at the heart of the city and around
it, particularly following construction of the port. This facilitated traffic in its area
and around the main train station (the new station on al-Muluk street west of the new
commercial area in Haifa).31

Development of Tourism

A noticeable improvement in the tourism sector took place as Haifa enjoyed the
introduction of two important economic establishments in the late Ottoman period–
the railway and the port. The movement of tourists to the Holy Land increased,
particularly coming from Europe, and Muslim pilgrims visited Haifa after their
arrival by train on their way to the holy sites of the Hijaz. The British travel agency
Thomas Cook and Sons, opened offices in Haifa and other large Palestinian cities and
advertised a program that included train travel from Haifa to Samekh and a trip around
Lake Tiberias, taking in the Christian holy sites in Tiberias and Kafr Nahom, and then
continuing on to Damascus.32 The trips and tours of this agency enjoyed great demand
among European tourists who found them to meet both their travel and entertainment
needs.

It is indisputable that European tourists who travelled to Palestine via Haifa Port
benefited from the various services provided by the city. The city thus flourished
commercially, including the hotel and other services provided to meet the needs
of tourists. Naturally this required a steady increase in the construction of hotels,
residences, restaurants, nightclubs, markets, theatres, cinemas, amusements, parks
and other facilities for tourism and recreation. Some Haifa families rented rooms to
tourists and visitors, bringing in extra income to support family economies.

Improvement of the Administrative Agency

The administrative agencies of Haifa absorbed increasing numbers of employees in the
period following the commencement of the Hijaz railway extension and until WWI.
The railway project and later the port development project necessitated a continual
increase in the size of government staff in order to deal with the official transactions
related to those two projects and their offshoot agencies, commercial stores, and
health, postal, sewage and industrial services.

> The increasing number of employees following the
> establishment of the Beirut state resulted in new institutions
> in the Haifa district such as the transportation committee
> and the cultural affairs committee …etc. The number of
> employees in the municipality also increased as a result of

new posts such as that of doctor, inspector and engineer…etc.

> As for the other leap in the number of those employed in
> the administrations, it took place in 1905, when the trains
> began to run in Haifa. The number of employees in the
> city’s administration totalled 75, thus a 25 percent increase
> (not including the railway workers). This employment rise
> was a result of the population’s increasing use of the local
> administration’s services and an effort to improve those
> services.33

Yet Haifa was not able to meet the employment needs of the administrative agency
with its own residents due to the population’s lack of experience and the urgency with
which employees were required to run administrative affairs. The government thus
brought in administrative employees to fill this need. The acting German consul Keller
noted early on in a report of his (from 1903) that employment in the railway was
attracting new elements to the city, not only from Palestine but also from surrounding
countries.34

Further Development during the British Mandate Period

On the eve of WWI and during the war, Haifa took on a prominent position in British
strategic military planning. The general chief of staff of the British armed forces
viewed the British army’s control of Haifa as guaranteeing the connection of Palestine
to Egypt via extension of the railway from al-Qantara (in Egypt) to Haifa, and of
Palestine to eastern Jordan and the Arabian Peninsula and Iraq via the Hijaz railway.

These British ambitions were materialized in the 1916 Sykes-Pico agreement between
the British and French governments. This agreement clearly reflected the British
insistence on making Haifa among the areas under British colonial rule in the Middle
Eastern region for the protection of the Suez Canal and the oil wells in the Gulf area
and India, the largest British colony.

The significance of Haifa’s location in British strategic planning stemmed from
the opportunity it afforded Britain to control Haifa, Akko, Marj ibn Amer, and the
Carmel mountain chain. This patch of land formed a barrier protecting against French
ambitions in Palestine, which would threaten British interests in the immediate area
and neighbouring regions.

In actuality, Haifa did not have great importance in the military operations of the final
year of WWI due to its old port being unsuitable for the docking of ships. The British
leadership thus halted sending forces to the city and the troops of General Allenby turned
to Damascus via the Wadi ‘Ara road and Tiberias. Haifa fell on 23 September 1918
following a simple military operation and one week later was followed by Damascus.35

Directly following the end of WWI, Haifa resumed its place of priority in the British
strategic vision, and all of the top-ranking British leaders in the Middle East were
based in Haifa. The Egyptian platoon was transferred to it in October 1918, which
allowed the English to control the entire regions of Syria, Palestine, and eastern
Jordan. Haifa’s importance increased unexpectedly following the extension of
the railway south. The English extended a railway from Egypt of 145.5 cm, the
international standard, and trains arrived to Lod from al-Qantara in Egypt and then
continued to Qalqilia, Qanun, al-Khdeira, and Atlit. On 23 December 1918, this line
reached Haifa.

Connecting Haifa to the coastal railway resulted in directly connecting it to Egypt,
as well as Damascus via the Hijaz railway, Jerusalem via the line between Jaffa
and Jerusalem, and Aleppo and Istanbul via the Hijaz railway. Thus Haifa became
a railway crossroads of utmost importance in the Middle East, and the mandate
government made it its administrative headquarters for the railway.36

Haifa underwent many developments in terms of demography, society and the
economy. Researcher Mai Seikaly believes that Haifa is a prime model for studying
the kinds of transformations that took place among its Arab populace.

> It had all the characteristics specific to other major cities
> while no other had all the advantages of Haifa. Like
> Jerusalem, Haifa became a centre for administrative activity
> and employees, particularly for the railway and port. It
> also became an industrial centre, like Tel Aviv. Moreover, it
> became a commercial centre, just like all the other Palestinian
> cities.37

During the British mandate period, the railway sector was considered one of the major
employers, with approximately 7,500 workers and employees.

The mandate government placed three major projects on its ladder of priorities for
the development of Haifa–development of the railway system, port, and oil refinery
plants. These projects played a central role in the economic flourishing of the city
and everything related to it, including construction, British Mandate administration,
municipality services, increasing land area allowed for construction, forging roads,
and building institutions, restaurants, cafés and the like.

Haifa became a powerful draw for hundreds of Arab, European, and Jewish investors.
The Jewish Agency and Jewish immigration institutions concentrated their efforts on
encouraging Jewish immigration to Haifa with the goal of benefiting from the city’s
economic, industrial, commercial and transportation infrastructure. The Palestine
railway provided a direct connection with Egypt and the Hijaz railway provided
a connection to Syria and eastern Jordan. The railway was considered the backbone
of Palestinian transportation on which the British mandate government depended,

particularly in the 1930s and 40s and especially during WWII. The railway offered
extremely important services to the British war efforts in the Middle East.

Construction of the new Haifa Port that opened in 1932 and the construction of oil
refinery plants near Haifa were the most prominent markers of the city’s development,
including its increase in population and services and a greater need of the railway in
order to transport travellers, workers, and goods. The Dar’a-Haifa railway played a
considerable role in these developments and the transformation of Haifa’s economic,
demographic, and social circumstances.38

Haifa’s strategic status further rose after an oil pipeline was extended in 1934 from
Kirkuk in Iraq to Haifa Bay where the refineries were located. The Hijaz railway
transported pipes and other equipment necessary for construction of the oil pipeline.

The presence of railways leading in all directions, a modern port, and oil refinery
plants all in one city led the British military administration to send its battleships to
Haifa Port to be fuelled as well as to meet all their other needs. Yet the British planners
did not extend the railway from Haifa to Iraq because there was no need to following
the speedy expansion of good and easy road networks between Palestine and eastern
Jordan all the way to Iraq. The rising number of cars and trucks decreased the need for
trains in this area.39

Haifa’s economic facilities, in particular the railway and port, increased the amount
of commercial transaction taking place in both directions–export and import. “Haifa
surpassed Jaffa as a primary port, particularly after it established for itself the
secondary role of being a regional centre for transit commerce” (i.e. transportation of
commerce from outside Palestine to inner Syria and Iraq).40

Haifa eventually stopped concentrating on Houran grains for its regional imports due
to a decline in their quality and variety, and began in the 1930s to focus on the supply
of citrus following a general strike in Palestine during 1936 and 1937. Citrus was sent
to Haifa Port rather than Jaffa Port, whose workers joined the strike concomitantly,
thus creating an obstacle to the export of citrus.

The English realized the shortcomings of the Hijaz railway, particularly its narrow
breadth (105 cm) and inability to transport large quantities of goods. They did not,
therefore, develop it by purchasing new trains and carriages for example. The role
of this railway was limited to transporting material and equipment for the electricity
generation plant in al-Baqura (Naharim) on the Jordan River after Benhas Rotenberg
won exclusivity rights to produce electric energy. This railway also transported pipes
for the oil pipeline extension from Iraq to Haifa. As for travellers, they were few
on this line, and over time travellers on their way to Damascus decreased despite
the railway administration continuing to run trains from Haifa to Dar’a and then
Damascus.

To organize the railway workers, a union for railway, telephone and telegraph workers
was established. The General Union for Hebrew Workers (Histradut) attempted to
penetrate this workers union41 and thus many of them dropped out and joined the
Palestinian Arab Workers Association, which was led in the 1940s by Sami Taha. This
association provided free services for its members and gained considerable status in
the arena of political activity, to the degree that it began to form a challenge to the
Supreme Islamic Council in Jerusalem, which was under the influence of its president,
Mufti Haj Amin Husseini. Sami Taha was assassinated in September 1947 as a result
of this challenge and contestation.42

In 1946, the Palestine railway workers union declared a strike after the general
administration ignored its demands for improved wages and work conditions and
increased legal rights. The strike included trains and maintenance workshops and
halted the movement of trains for four consecutive days. The railway general director
had no other choice than to contact the Palestinian Arab Workers Association for
negotiations. A delegation headed by the association’s secretary general Sami Taha
and including members of the railway workers union administration board met him,
and after a long and difficult discussion the general administration agreed to all of
the syndicate’s demands, including raising wages and providing health insurance and
worker’s compensation.43 The wage increase agreed upon was to equal the permanent
wage increase of Jewish workers, a victory the Histradut had worked hard for. The
wages of Jewish workers had surpassed that of Arabs by a third to a full double.44

Histadrut and other Zionist institutions attempted to wrest away work from the hands
of Arabs and pass it over to Jews, including in the railway sector. Zionist pressure
succeeded in forcing the mandate administration to gradually reduce the number of
Egyptian workers on the railway and partly replace them with Jewish workers.45 This
resulted in a shortage of work opportunities for Arabs in Haifa who began to face
waves of unemployment due to the Jewish control of capital in pivotal economic
projects in the city starting in the late 1930s, and increasingly so in the 1940s. The
mayor of Haifa, Shabti Levy, contributed to the entrenchment of Jewish domination
of the economy and administration of Haifa’s affairs. Levy became mayor in 1940
following the death of Hassan Shukry, who had been the mayor during WWII. He
assumed office without the holding of elections because of the state of emergency
imposed on the city, and because Jews had succeeded in imposing their control over
most of the administrative departments and offices in the municipality and government
institutions.

There is no doubt that the continually deepening differences between wages and
benefits for Arab as opposed to Jewish workers in Haifa contributed to an increased
Arab-national political awareness of the need for the organization of workers and
confrontation with the Histradut movement. The Histradut strove to appear as though
it was playing a neutral role in easing the animosity between Arabs and Jews, as it
indeed appeared at first glance. But it later became clear that Histradut was working
to silence the anger of Arab workers by concluding a truce, the appearance of

friendliness and rallying together, while actually realizing accomplishments for its
Jewish members.

Naturally, these economic differences had social and political ramifications, and
created increased distance between Arabs and Jews. Further adding to this were the
segregated living quarters and lifestyles of the two societies, for the Arabs and the
Jews lived in their own separate areas. Each national group was intent on providing all
of the services it needed, in addition to private institutions offering most education and
health services. The two groups never met except for economic concerns, commerce,
and some cases related to municipality services and other official services provided by
government departments and offices.

Conclusion

The Hijaz railway and Palestine railway (during the British mandate period) played a
pioneering role in providing the elements required for the development of Haifa from
a small town to a large city, enjoying all the advantages of an increased population and
in turn, increased services.

The rapid transformation Haifa underwent affected its economy and that of the
villages surrounding it. These area villages provided a labour force for the various
sectors related to the railway and port, and also provided the city with various
foodstuffs. Haifa thus developed into a central city of northern Palestine, whose
prominent status and future development enabled it to attract significant political,
social, and cultural activity, all of which deserve future research.
