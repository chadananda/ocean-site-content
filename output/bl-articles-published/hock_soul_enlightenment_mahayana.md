Abstract

This article examines the development of Mahayana Buddhism, its spread
to China and how the Chinese people adopted and adapted it. The
Buddhist teachings on "nonself" and the "Enlightenment" are correlated
with the Baha'i teachings on the soul. In particular, the journey of the soul
described in Baha'u'Uah's Seven Valleys, which culminates in a state of
"True Poverty and Absolute Nothingness" is likened to the Mahayana
Sunyata (Tmptiness) of Nirvana. Parallels are drawn between the Baha'i
"Valley of Unity" and Buddhist monism, both of which seek to go beyond
all notions of duality.

The central role played by the founders of the Baha'i Faith and Mahayana
Buddhism on unlocking the spiritual potential of their respective followers
is also compared. In both cases their teachings are best understood in
terms of a way by which their followers can explore the expanses of their
own hearts. Also, both in Mahayana Buddhism and the Baha'i Faith, there
is an injunction to attain a balance between Wisdom and Compassion,
between individual self-enlightenment and universal salvation.
36              THE SINGAPORE BAHÁÍ STUDIES REVIEW

1. Introduction

Buddhism was founded by Sidharta Gotama1, an Indian prince who lived
in the 6th and 5 trl centuries, BC. His father was the king of a small state in
the foothills of the Himalayas- He was brought up amidst the luxuries and
pleasures befitting a prince. Unlike other princes, Sidharta was
disenchanted, and left the sheltered life of his home to become a religious
mendicant. After years of religious striving He attained enlightenment at
the age of thirty-five and was henceforth known as The Buddha, or The
Enlightened One. He spent the next forty-five years of His life preaching
His message to His fellow men. At the age of eighty He died.

The religion in India during the Buddha's time was Brahminical
Hinduism. Its priests the Brahmins claimed to be able to mediate between
the people and the gods of Hinduism using special rites and rituals laid
down in the Vedas, and which together with the Upanishads constitute the
sacred lore of Hinduism- The Hindu quest was for one's rational soul
(atman) to be united with the Eternal (Paramatma) and by so doing pass
beyond the ephemeral and enter the permanent, the bliss of Nirvana.
Recognising that living the moral life and not the rituals can free oneself
from worldly entanglements, the Buddha rejected the Vedic concept of
salvation and instead taught His famous Eightfold Noble Path (see below)
as the panacea to overcome suffering and unhappiness.

The Buddha's doctrine of salvation2 was given in his first sermon, when
he enunciated The Four Noble Truths2 and The Eightfold Noble Path..4

    The Eightfold Noble Path, which is right views, right intentions, right
speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right
concentration. See Kogen Mizuno, Essentials of Buddhism, pp. 158 - 161.
            Mahayana Buddhism and the Bahá 7 Faith                          37

The Eightfold Noble Path has three categories comprising the whole range
of moral discipline:

        moral conduct (right speech, right action, and right livelihood);
        mental discipline (right effort, right mindfulness, and right
        concentration);
        intuitive insight or wisdom (right views, right intentions).

For the first category, moral conduct, He said that any act that is harmful
to oneself or to another is evil. The gist of moral discipline is as follows:

          'Not to commit any evil, to do good, and to purify one's mind.
         When you wish to perform an action, consider whether it is going
         to be harmful to others, harmful to yourself, harmful to yourself
         and others; if it is, do not perform it, for it is an evil action whose
        fruit will be suffering. "$

The second category, mental discipline, requires control of the mind. The
root of all evil is delusional ignorance and not craving for sensual
pleasures and material possessions. Cravings are generated by the senses
and external objects. External objects affect our senses. The Buddha
forbids the torturing of the senses. He said we can control the mind and
discipline it so we will not mistake the unpleasant for the pleasant, the
impure for the pure, and impermanent things as permanent. He said
whoever has mental discipline will see things as they really are.

The third category, intuitive insight or wisdom relates to there being a
surface and a depth to things. It is necessary to see beyond external
appearances to get at the true reality. Intuitive wisdom requires taking the
right view of things and to hold to the truths that all existence is suffering,
that all existence is impermanent. The Buddha said that the tears shed, by
man over the loss of his beloved ones during the course of existence are
more than the waters of the ocean. Once a woman came to the Buddha and
asked him to restore to life her child who had just died. The Buddha
consented, on condition that she first obtain a mustard seed from a family
which had not endured the suffering of death. The woman went out feeling

    DighaNikaya, PTS edition, 1.4 ff.
    38         THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

hopeful, but as she went from family to family, she found that they all had
experienced such suffering at one time or another. The universality of
suffering now dawned on her, whereupon she returned to the Blessed One
and asked to be taken into the order of nuns.

Right Views also include an understanding of The Chain of Causation.6
This formula recognises that events are not caused by the arbitrary will of
some outside power, but that each event arises out of some previous cause.

The Buddhist who practises The Eightfold Noble Path will achieve
salvation by escaping the cycle of rebirth and the realisation of Nirvana.
As the main characteristic of the round of existence is suffering, then
Nirvana would be the cessation of suffering. By practising the prescribed
moral discipline, the individual puts an end to craving. Many Buddhists
believe that when craving is extinguished, no more Karma is generated
and there is no further rebirth. When rebirth is terminated, the individual
realises Nirvana.

The Buddha's Message, which He termed Dharma, advocated a middle
course between austerities and gratification of the senses and was known
as The Middle Path. The Buddha incorporated in His teachings the Hindu
doctrine of Karma. 'Karma'" means deed or act. Every act produces a
result or fruit; a good deed produces a good fruit; an evil deed, an evil
fruit. "Karma" means a deed performed and the results that arise from it.

             Mahayana Buddhism and the Bahá 7 Faith                           39

To this conception of Karma the Buddha further taught that Karma
involved not just the deed and reward but also the intention behind the
deed. For Karma to be generated there must be intention, and he
considered this intention to be more important than the deed.

In Theravada Buddhism, when a person dies, the Karma that one has
accumulated in life will determine the nature of one's future life. There are
5 states of existence, namely deity, man, animal, hungry ghost, and
denizens of hell. The first two states are considered good states, but the
last three are evil and painful.7

As long as one is in Samsara, one will continually be subject to suffering.
The Buddha preached that birth is suffering, old age is suffering, death is
suffering, separation from loved ones is suffering, not getting what one
wishes is suffering. If we wish to rid ourselves of suffering, we must go
outside the cycle of craving associated with physical existence. The aim of
Buddhism is to break the cycle of suffering and attain salvation. Many
Buddhists believe in reincarnation, where the soul transmigrates into
different existences in this physical world, but this is not the only possible
interpretation of the Buddha's words on this subject. Others have set out
to demonstrate that reincarnation does not imply physical rebirth, and that
it has been interpreted in an overly literal and anthropomorphic way.8

Many Buddhists believe that the Buddha rejected the Hindu belief in the
existence of a permanent self, but this view is questionable. For instance,
the author of The God of Buddha, states that: "The Sanskrit word "atman"
which translates the "self of man has been used and understood in the
Buddhist texts in a manner compatible with the Buddha's own concepts of
"self. While the Buddha rejected the commonly accepted concept of
"self which was understood by His contemporaries as some kind of a
soul monad, an inexplicable ego-being individually residing in the human
physique as a separate entity divorced from the mind and thoughts, He did

not deny man's mentality, his spiritual constitution, his thoughts, his mind
or manas, in brief, his soul. However, we must understand that there is no
dualism involved here since, to the Buddha, man's soul does not consist of
two things, an atman (self) and a manas (mind or thoughts), but of only
one reality. Our thoughts are our self, our soul or atman, and hence it
would be completely erroneous to assert that the Buddha denied the soul
or self. This premise is also corroborated by Buddhist scholars of different
schools and countries, including the Theravadin Buddhists, who claim for
themselves greater precision and faithfulness concerning the Buddha's
doctrine. We should also recognise here that the Buddha, above all, was
cognizant of the impossibility of attributing definitions and form to such
inherently "indefinables" as self, soul, mind etc. and, hence, once again
took the middle course, between the two extremes. This middle way
placed no demands on the Buddha to prove or disprove either of the
contending concepts, both being by their very nature outside the realm of
empirical verification. The way He chose provided Him with the
flexibility of beihg able to contain both views, and also enabled Him to
endow His own concept of the "self " with just that correct measure of
reality necessary to incorporate it into His message as the "motive" for
self-improvement and righteous living."9

These are the main tenets of Theravada Buddhism, which is essentially a
discipline for personal salvation by the individual for himself. Salvation,
however, is possible only for those who join the monastic order, the
Sangha. The monk is intent on the accumulation of meritorious Karma for
his own salvation and these merits cannot be transferred to others. After
entry into the Sangha, he strives to become an Arahat or perfect saint.
This Arahat is traditionally indifferent to social and family concerns.
Historically, Theravada doctrine was viewed by some to be spiritually
restrictive, because it dealt mainly with the individual's salvation. It was
criticised as conservative, following the letter rather than the spirit of the
Buddha's teachings.

2. Mahayana Buddhism

From the 1 s t Century AD (approximately 700 years after the death of the
Buddha) onwards a new and different Buddhist doctrine arose in India.
This doctrine is called Mahayana (or the Greater Vehicle to salvation). In
Theravada, suffering is something to be escaped from, but the Mahayana
teaches that in suffering there is meaning and that is the very principle of
religion and is the way to salvation. The Mahayana offers salvation not
only to those in the Sangha^O but also to all sentient beings. It teaches that
all sentient beings possess the Buddha-nature in them and hence all have
the potential to achieve enlightenment. Instead of adherence to the strict
discipline advocated in Theravada, Mahayana teaches that enlightenment
can be achieved by faith, love and devotion to the Buddha. These are
manifested by compassion, charity and altruism.11

Dharma12 is a central concept in both Theravada and Mahayana
Buddhism. Dharma means "Religion" or "rta" (righteousness). Dharma is
interpreted as signifying the teachings of also the Buddha. Both meanings
are implied in the word "Dharma". For example, a passage in the
Theravada scriptures describes Dharma as being "eternal, verifiable, and
onward leading - to be known individually by the wise."13 Another
passage states that "whether or not Tathagatas14 arise, this world remains
the same, with constancy of Dharma, normativeness of Dharma."15
According to Theravada teachings, the realisation of Nirvana and Dharma
- both as "righteousness" and as "teachings" - occur together. In contrast,
Mahayana stresses Dharma and de-emphasises Nirvana. Mahayana
regards the Buddha not as a human being, but as the omnipresent
Universal Truth (Dharma), which is manifest in all things. This is

    It is also used by the Hindus with the same meaning. To the Hindus, Dharma also
means the same as regards Krishna.

illustrated in the story of the monk, Vakkali who was on his death-bed.
He said he desired to glimpse the Buddha before he passed away. The
Buddha consented but regretted His disciple's behaviour saying, "Enough,
Vakkali. What is the use of seeing this vile body? Whoever, Vakkali, sees
Dharma, he sees me. Whoever sees me, he sees Dharma"16 This implies
that it is more important to practise the Buddha's teachings {Dharma) and
thereby see the Universal Truth than it is to see the Buddha in person.

Nirvana and Samsara
In Mahayana, Nirvana and Samsara are considered two different aspects
of the same Reality, the same Dharma. If one looks at the universe and
sees the truth, that is Nirvana. If one fails to see the truth, then it is
Samsara. The final passing of the historical Buddha is similar. If one is
capable only of seeing the physical body of the Buddha, one may believe
the Buddha has abandoned Samsara. From the Lotus Sutra it is stated
that:17
      ((
        The life of the Tathagata so long ago enlightened is unlimited;
          he is everlasting.
          Without becoming extinct, the Tathagata makes a show of
          Nirvana,
          on behalf of those needing guidance. "18

The Triple Bodies of the Buddha

Mahayana doctrine has a number of distinct concepts from Theravada.
These relate to The Three Bodies of the Buddha, the Bodhisattva, and the
concepts of Prajna (Wisdom) and Karuna (Compassion).

The Buddha in Mahayana is considered not an ordinary human teacher
who lived on earth, carried out his spiritual mission and then passed into
Nirvana. The Buddha is regarded as an eternal being who embodies the

     The Lotus of the Wonderful Law (Saddharmapundarika Sutra). This is a translated

universal Truth, who is neither born nor dies, but lives from eternity to
eternity. The eternal Buddha has made appearances on earth countless
times in the past and will continue to do so in the future. He is believed to
be the manifestation of a great spiritual being. The Triple Bodies of the
Buddha19 interprets the Buddha as follows:

         The Dharmakaya (The Body of Essence)
         The Sambhogakaya (The Body of Bliss)
         The Nirmanakaya (The Body of Transformation)

The Dharmakaya - The Body of Essence
The Dharmakaya is the "Truth-body of the Buddha. It is not limited in
time and space. The Dharmakaya Buddha is omnipresent, eternal and the
ultimate Buddha. The Body of Essence is the only real body of the
Buddha; this body connects and unites all the Buddhas of the past with
those of the future. Although there are many Buddhas, there is only one
Body of Essence.

The Sambhogakaya - The Body of Bliss
When the Body of Essence is called upon to fulfil the spiritual needs of the
bodhisattvas, it then appears in the second form, the Body of Bliss, which
is akin to the Holy Spirit. It is the privilege of the bodhisattvas to perceive
this body which is the emanation of the Body of Essence. The Body of
Bliss dwells forever in the heavens like a supreme god. From the Body of
Bliss emanates the Body of Transformation.

The Nirmanakaya - The Body of Transformation
The Body of Transformation is the physical body of the historical Buddha
who lived on earth. It is limited in time and space. It helps to explain the
appearance of a Buddha among mankind. The eternal Body of Essence
creates a fictitious phantom of himself and causes this to appear among
ignorant and wicked mankind in order to convert it. The historical
Buddha was such a phantom. He took on the characteristics of man. He
lived and followed the ways of the world. He lived, preached, and then

44            THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

entered into Nirvana. The eternal Buddha has done this not once but
countless times, but these creations are believed to be illusions and
appearances.

The Mahayana Bodhisattva

The bodhisattva is a human being destined for enlightenment. He is the
epitome of Mahayana virtues. Though qualified to enter Nirvana as a
result of merits accumulated in the past, the bodhisattva delays his final
entry and chooses to remain in the world until he has brought every
sentient being to enlightenment. He does this by transferring some of his
inexhaustible stock of merits to less fortunate creatures so that they too
may share in the rewards of those merits. He will sacrifice himself, if this
is of assistance to others. Universal compassion, through perfect self-
sacrifice, is the main characteristic of the bodhisattva.20

The bodhisattva is the personification of a trait of the Buddha's
personality. As there are many such traits, so there are different
bodhisattvas. Manjusri represents wisdom, while Avalokitesvara
represents the compassion of the Buddha. The master is often described as
being excellent in all ways, and this is symbolised by the bodhisattva
Samantabhadra. Of these, Avalokitesvara occupies pre-eminent position.
He is able to abrogate The Law of Karma and he visits the numerous hells
to lighten the miseries of unfortunate creatures. He is especially on the
lookout for people facing the dangers of water, fire, demons, sword and
enemies. He is depicted pictorially as a person with a thousand eyes and
arms to enable him better to see and help the suffering.

The Two Mahayana Philosophies - Madhyamika and Vijnanavada

The two chief Mahayana philosophies (both founded in India) are
Madhyamika and Vijnanavada. Madhyamika was founded by Nagarjuna
in 2 n d century AD, and Vijnanavada by Asanga and Vasubandhu in 4th
century AD.

The Buddhist Tradition, p. 91.
            Mahayana Buddhism and the Bahá 7 Faith                      45

The Madhyamika Philosophy (The Doctrine of Middle Position)
Nagarjuna described the Supreme Reality as Sunyata (Emptiness). His
School is called Madhyamika because it teaches a Middle Doctrine where
existence and non-existence have only relative truth. True wisdom is the
knowledge of the real meaning of Emptiness. Upon the true meaning of
Emptiness depends the understanding of Madhyamika. Emptiness is
empty only in the sense that it is free from the limitations of relative
knowledge. Enlightenment alone will reveal what it really is. To seek and
find nothing is to find the true Buddha.

         "Those who describe in detail the Buddha — who is unchanging
        and beyond all description — are defeated by description, and do
        not perceive the Tathagata.
        The self-existence of the Tathagata is the self existence of the
        world.
        The Tathagata is without self-existence, and the world is without
        self-existence.,r2]

The Madhyamika doctrine of metaphysical emptiness is explained by the
example of the chair. We say and think that a chair has a back, a seat and
legs. Actually there is no such thing as a chair apart from an assemblage
of these components. There is no "chair" that could possess a back, seat or
legs. Take away the back, and the "chair" becomes a stool. Take away the
legs, and the "stool" becomes a slab of wood. The assembled components
are the condition for the "existence" of the chair.

The Vijnanavada Philosophy (The Doctrine of Consciousness)
The two philosophers of Vijnanavada are Asanga and Vasubandhu. The
Vijnanavada agrees in many areas with the Madhyamika. According to
this philosophy, all phenomena originate in the Mind (the Absolute
Reality, which is like an impersonal God) and nothing exists but the Mind.
It proceeds with the analytical division of the 5 Skandhas and the
Dharmas. It insists that not only are objects transitory, but that the
substances also are impermanent. According to this system of thought,
spirit and matter are one, and all external objects are the outcome of the
one Mind.
21
     Madhyamaka Karika 24.15-6
 46              THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

The seeds of all phenomena and objects are comprehended in the
alayavijnana.22 When not in action it lies latent. It is like a fine perfume,
whose scent penetrates into the innermost part and then extends to the
outer deeds, both good and bad. It is like the projections of the Mind.

In the Vijnanavada philosophy the world is produced from the Mind, and
the condition needed for the manifestation of seeds is The Law of Cause
and Effect. The Alayaf^ is the substance and causation the means. They
combine to create the world and show forth all phenomenal objects. The
origin of The Law of Causation cannot be known, nor can the beginning of
the storing of seeds, and their manifestation. Theravada's basis is The Law
of Cause and Effect, and so did not define a personal Creator. But in
Mahayana there is an Absolute Reality (the Mind), which is, birthless,
deathless and permanently existing. It is the substance of all phenomenal
objects and the basis of the relative Alaya. The Middle Path doctrine
asserts the oneness of this world with this Absolute Reality, and urges us
to exert ourselves in this world, even though it is full of sorrow. Bliss is
not just to achieve deliverance from this world, but in working for
salvation one realises our Oneness with it. Vasubandhu wrote:

            "As long as one places something before oneself taking it as an
           object and saying:
            "This is only a mental image," so long does one dwell in that
           (mental image) alone.
           But when cognition no longer apprehends an object, then it stands
          firmly
           in consciousness only, because where there is nothing to grasp,
           there is no nTore grasping.
           It is without thought, without bias, and is the supra-mundane
           cognition....
           This is the element without defilements, inconceivable,
           wholesome and stable, the blissful body of liberation,

3. Mahayana Buddhism in China

During its first two centuries of development, Buddhism was confined to
India. When Emperor Asoka (274 to 236 BC) converted to Buddhism, he
used it to unify India and the faith spread rapidly throughout the region.
Asoka sent missionaries to many countries, including Central Asia,
Greece, Iran, China and Japan. By the first century BC, Buddhism had
spread to China via the Silk Road. During that time, the Han empire (206
BC to 220 AD) was ruling China.

By 410 AD, Buddhism had spread to most of China. Buddhism brought to
the Chinese many deities in the form of ever-compassionate and merciful
bodhisattvas, who are always ready to help those who sought their
assistance. It appealed to them with its hierarchy of heavens. Rebirth was
considered a reward for meritorious living on earth. At the same time it
depicted hells where the tortures became progressively more tormenting
and terrifying. These serve as a deterrent to perpetrators of evil deeds. The
doctrine of Karma appealed to those sunk in hardship and misery during
the era and it offered them a rational explanation of the adverse social
conditions. Their sufferings were looked upon as the retribution for past
misdeeds. If they did meritorious work they would be reborn into happier
lives in the future. Meanwhile, the arrogant tyrannical officials who were
living in luxury now, would in their next rebirth be tormented by misery.
Such a "rational" explanation of divine justice won many converts for
Buddhism during the early period.

The Mahayana teaching that all human beings have the Buddha-nature in
them and so are capable of attaining Buddhahood and salvation, is an
inspiring spiritual ideal. This concept had never been put forth to the
Chinese people before. The path leading to this salvation was also made
easy: just the repetition of the formula Namo Amitabha25 or the creation

of an image of Buddha, even in the mud or sand, was sufficient to merit
deliverance. The religion was adapted to make it more acceptable to the
people. An example was the use of the Confucian virtue of filial piety.
When a person joined the Sangha, he severed all relations with his family
and society and he no longer needed to honour his parents and ancestors.
Yet statues of the Buddha were often erected in China to perpetuate the
memory of dead parents.

To the Chinese, Mahayana was spiritually and intellectually more
stimulating than Confucianism and Taoism. The life of the Buddha was
taught and it rejuvenated China. Mahayana did not take off in India, but it
had a wholesome effect on the cultural life of the Chinese people. It
stimulated their mind and made it work out many things original to it. A
school of Mahayana Buddhism from India known as Dhyani Buddhism
became Chan (Zen in Japan) Buddhism. Other well known Mahayana
schools were the Than T'ai and the Pure Land. The Chan philosophy
appealed to the practical and intellectual sides of the Chinese, whereas The
Pure Land met its spiritual cravings.

The desire to be born in a land of purity and happiness is the desire for
immortality. Whatever form it may take with different individuals, they all
have a longing for an after-life. Before Mahayana came to China, the
people did not have a very definite idea about their future; their religious
horizon was very much limited to the earthly life. The Chinese people
have been pursuers from the beginning of their history of The Three
Desires: Bliss, Prosperity, and Longevity. Bliss means perpetuation of the
family life, while Prosperity and Longevity are matters concerning the
individual. Buddhism did not oppose this outright, but taught the moral
law of causation to attain this end. There is no doubt that this is am
important contribution that Buddhism made among the Chinese people.

Mahayana Schools in China

From the Han to the Tang Dynasties (200 BC - 900 AD) eight Mahayana
schools emerged. They developed out of the intense intellectual ferment
caused by Buddhism. The eight schools were:
             Mahay ana Buddhism and the Sahá 7 Faith                             49

1.   The San Lun School
2.   The Wei Shi (Vijnanavada) School
3.   The Zhen Yan (or Tantric) School
4.   The San Jie Jiao (or Three Ages) School
5.   The T'ianT'ai School
6.   The Hua Yen School
7.   The Pure Land School
8.   The Chan School (from Dhyani or "Mental" Buddhism)

1. The San Lun School - This School was also known as The Three
Treatises School. It was founded by the Han translator Lokashema (170
AD). The three works translated by Kumarajiva (344 - 413 AD) were
Nagarjuna's Madhyamika and two other works by unknown authors.
Kumarajiva never went to China but spent his life in Nalauda translating
Buddhist texts into Chinese. He met the Chinese monk-to-be Fa Hsien in
400 AD. Mahayana Buddhism came to China in AD 410. It was brought
by Gunavarman (a Kashmiri prince monk) who reached China from
Ceylon. Before that he taught Buddhism in Southeast Asia (now
Indonesia). The San Lun School attained its greatest influence during the
4th 5th a n d gth centuries AD. During this time there was a close
relationship between Buddhism and Taoism on the basis of the similarities
between the concept of Sunyata (emptiness) and wu-wei (non-being).

2. The Wei Shi School - This School (or Vijnanavada School) was
established in 563 AD with the translation of Asanga's Mahayana
Samgraha.26 It was boosted by the pilgrim Hsuan Tsang's (596 - 664 AD)
return from India. He studied directly under Vasubandhu and Asanga, the
founders of Vijnanavada Buddhism. It did not remain a separate school as
it became absorbed into the School of Hsuan Tsang (called The Dharma
Character School). It declined in the 9 ^ Century AD and disappeared a
few hundred years after that.

3. The Zhen Yan School - This School (or The Tantric School) is
opposed to The San Lun and Wei Shi Schools. This school impressed
greatly the foreign rulers of northern China. Buddhist monks reportedly
impressed the new and unsophisticated northern rulers with magic feats.

50            THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

Similar feats were used when Buddhism was established with the peoples
of Tibet and Mongolia. This school was most developed in the Tang
Dynasty (618 - 906 AD) with the Three Indian Masters, Subhakarasimha,
Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajira. They were recognised by the Tang
Emperors and it flourished during the 8 ^ century AD. Eventually this
school had a greater impact in Japan than in China.

4. The San Jiao School - The San Jiao School (or The Three Ages) was
the only school that developed in China but did not take root in Japan.
Founded in the 6*h century AD by Xin Xin, it was the first Buddhist
school to incur the disfavour of the Tang dynasty and as a result suffered
suppression. The Three Ages refer to the Hindu and Buddhist notion that
after a great teacher establishes Dharma on earth, there will be a
succession of three ages in which the Dharma deteriorates progressively.
This school stated that they were in the Third Age and that the Dharma
had degenerated, where people were blinded by greed, hatred and
delusion. They said that the appropriate beneficiary should be the Sangha.
As a result, the monasteries accumulated great wealth. The school drew
the wrath of the Emperor when it said in the Third Age no government
could administer justice and prosperity and that they were not worthy of
allegiance and respect. The Emperor declared this sect heretical and in 713
AD the wealth of the San Jiao School was confiscated by the empire.
Subsequently, the sect did not survive the Tang dynasty's suppression of
Buddhism.

5. The T'ian T'ai School - The T'ian T'ai School was established by the
monk Zhi Yi (538 to 597 AD). He systematised the Buddhist doctrines
and classified, integrated and harmonised the vast collection of scriptures.
It is the first truly Chinese school of Buddhism. Zhi Yi wrote very little,
but his lectures were recorded by his faithful disciple Chang An (561 to
632 AD). These lectures were concerned primarily with the basic tenet of
the school, The Lotus Sutra, which teaches that the historical Sakyamuni
was but an earthly manifestation of the eternal Buddha. The most
important of these lectures comprise the three great works of the school:
              Mahayana Buddhism and the Bahá 7 Faith                                  51

         a. The Profound Meaning of The Lotus Sutra. This was a
         systematic survey of the Buddha's teachings, with The Lotus
         Sutra as the nucleus.

         b. The Textual Commentary on The Lotus Sutra.

         c. The Great Concentration and Insight.21

The early believers were puzzled by the large volume of literature, with its
many diverse doctrines and ideas. They questioned how one individual
could preach so many sermons during one lifetime, or how could one
explain the numerous contradictions and doctrinal differences taught in the
scriptures. Zhi Yi divided the teachings into chronological periods and
with a systematic arrangement. He divided the periods of teachings and
his system is filled with encyclopaedic details and scholarship.

6. The Hua Yen School The Hua Yen School (or The Avatamsaka
School) comes from The Avatamsaka Sutra (The Flower Garland Sutra).28
It was translated by Buddhabhadra in 420 AD. This school was initiated
by Fa Shun (557 to 640 AD) and finally systematised by Fa Tsang (643 to
712 AD). Hua Yen uses a classification of sutras and doctrines similar to
the 5 periods and 8 teachings of the T'ian T'ai school. However, it regards
The Avatamsaka Sutra rather than The Lotus Sutra as supreme. There is no
Indian counterpart of the T'ian T'ai or Hua Yen Schools. Both schools are
Vijnanavada in orientation. They assert that mundane phenomena are
impure aspects of the one, all-encompassing, absolute mind, of which The
Dharmakaya Buddha is the pure aspect. All phenomena thus originate
from and resolve into the Buddha as the ultimate metaphysical principle,
just as all thoughts originate from and resolve into the mind. To illustrate
the basic concept of both schools: just as the fish in my mind and the tree
in my mind are not really different - both are merely manifestations of my

27
     Ibid, p. 155 to 160.
28
     The Avatamsaka Sutra broadened the concept of the Six Perfections by relating
them to the ten stages of bodhisattva practice. A list of ten perfections was given, the
original six and a further four: skilful means, vows, force of purpose, and transcendental
knowledge. The Avatamsaka Sutra expounded the ten stages of bodhisattva practice and
is accepted by Mahayana Buddhism as a whole. The ten stages are:
52             THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

mind in thought - so a "real" fish and a "real" tree are but manifestations
of the absolute mind, and are therefore fundamentally not different.

The significance of The Avatamsaka Sutra lies in the experience of
abhishyanditakayacitta. Abhishyandita means "dissolution", kaya means
"the body", and citta the "mind". It is a state in which one is no more
conscious of the distinction between mind and body. This state of
complete dissolution, where there is no more distinction between subject
and object (that is noesis and noema), is known as the realisation of
absolute Sunyata ("Emptiness"), that is, Reality or Mind. Sitting at this
centre, one looks around and perceives that this is a world of Hsiang-chi
and Hsiang-ju (meaning "inter-relationship" and "inter-penetration"
respectively). This is described in The Avatamsaka Sutra and explained by
Fa Tsang and his School.

An analogy to illustrate the state of inter-relation and inter-penetration is
that of Indra's Net.29 This net is made of precious gems and it hangs over
Indra's palace. In each of these gems are found reflected all the other
gems in the net. When the net is picked up, we see in it not only the entire
net but everyone of the gems within it. In a similar manner, every object in
this world is related to every other object and penetrated by it not only
spatially but temporally. For this reason, every minute we live contains
eternity. Eternal Now is our life. We do not have to seek eternity
anywhere else but in ourselves. It is the same with space. The point I

occupy is the centre of the universe, and it is in me and with me that it
subsists. As a fact of pure experience, however, there is no space without
time, and no time without space. Both are also inter-penetrating.

The Hua Yen philosophy appealed to the Chinese Emperors. By asserting
the unity of all phenomena in the Buddha, it implied the unity of all
subjects in the emperor. Moreover, by identifying all phenomena with one
another, it implied the identity of all subjects of the empire with all others.
It therefore provided an ideological basis for harmony in the empire and
allegiance to the emperor.

7. The Pure Land School - The Pure Land School is based on The three
Pure Land Sutras, the first of which appeared in Chinese from the 2n(^
century AD. Like the Three Ages School it held that the spiritual quality
of the world had been in decline since its zenith at the time of Buddha. It
thus considers the current period as the utterly degenerate third age. It
encouraged its followers to cultivate through prayers a sincere intent to be
reborn after death in the heavenly paradise of the Buddha Amitabha, the
Buddha of Infinite Radiance. The Pure Land school was not critical of the
government and thus did not incur the disfavour of China's emperors.

8. The Chan School - The Chan School (or Meditational School) is better
known as The Zen School. It came into prominence in the Tang dynasty
(618 - 906 AD). The School emphasises meditation as the only means to a
spiritual awakening beyond words or thought, dispensing with the
doctrines and other practices of Buddhism. It has the most ancient roots in
China and the most colourful history.30 It was brought to China by the
Indian monk Bodhidharma in 500 AD. He appeared first in southern
China. He was summoned to Emperor Liang Wu Ti who asked him how
much merit he had gained with the building of numerous Buddhist
temples. Bodhidharma said that he had gained none at all and promptly
departed.

Chan developed in China along with the Buddhist mysticism of Sunyata.
It was partly influenced by the Taoist concept of wu-wei, and partly in


30
     The Buddhist Tradition, p. 207 to 240.
 54              THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

accommodation with the Confucian emphasis on practical life. In Chan we
find the efflorescence of this mind.

In this School the most important tenet is the belief that Buddha-nature is
inherent in one's own mind and that the best means to salvation is to look
into one's mind to see Buddha-nature there. This is what later Buddhists
called "directly pointing to the human mind and becoming a Buddha by
seeing one's own nature."31 The result is the doctrine of salvation by
oneself. What is more interesting, salvation is to be achieved here and
now. And most interestingly it is to be achieved "in this very body."

Chinese Humanisation of Buddhism

From the beginning, Buddhism in China was understood in human terms.
The Pure Land and the Chan Schools have provided Chinese Buddhism
with a general pattern of practice. In both schools, Buddhism has been
humanised. The Chinese translation of the Buddha's title, Sakyamuni, was
"Neng-jen, " which means "the ability to be good." To pray to be reborn in
paradise means to escape from the human world. But man occupies a
central position in this movement. The school is not indigenous to China,
for the doctrine was taught in India and the basic texts are Indian. But in
spirit and character it is truly Chinese, and it now exists only in China and
Japan. While in India, rebirth in the Pure Land meant a complete break
with our earthly life, which was considered a life of suffering. However,
in China it means an extension of earthly living. There is no deprecation of
mundane life. Human relations are continued in the Pure Land. This is
why one is encouraged to transfer his merits to his ancestors. As in
Confucianism, this act is considered one of the most meritorious.
                                       i

The Buddha is worshipped as a deity by the Chinese. The most popular
Buddhist deity is Avalokitesvara or Kuan Yin. Kuan Yin is almost
humanised. In India (3rd to 12th century AD) and in Japan, he retains his
transcendental and heavenly features. In China he became a human
figure. From the Tang Dynasty (618 - 907 AD), Kuan Yin changed into a
woman, or The Goddess of Mercy, "mother" to millions of devotees. In
pictorial interpretations, the Indian rosaries are still present, but they are
31
      The Buddhist Tradition, p.208.
           Mahayana Buddhism and theBahá 7 Faith                       55

carried by a crane, a symbol of longevity. Kuan Yin holds a flower vase
from which all kinds of blessings are poured over humanity. These
blessings are not Nirvana, a world transcending our own, but human
blessings such as health, wealth, long life, and most important of all,
children. Instead of sitting in the heavens looking upon us with
compassion, she is likely to sit by a bamboo grove, carrying a baby or
holding a fish basket. She is spiritually close to mankind and is almost
human.

Man is central, not only in Chinese government and the arts, but also in
religion, which is other-worldly and transcendental. Most Chinese
Buddhists aspire to go to paradise, the "Pure Land." But, significantly,
what is more attractive to the Chinese is the Mahayana transformation, of
Buddhism from the doctrine of salvation in Nirvana after death to the
doctrine of salvation on earth and that he can achieve it "in this very
body." In the Mahayana, Nirvana is described in terms of permanence,
joy, the self, and purity.


4. The Baha'i Faith and Mahayana Buddhism

Although they come very different backgrounds and with their histories
separated by a lapse of 2,500 years, there are many similarities between
Mahayana Buddhism and the Baha'i Faith. The comparison and
contrasting differences will lead us to a better understanding of both
religions.

The Three Stations of the Manifestation of God

As in Mahayana, where there is the concept of The Triple Bodies of the
Buddha, Baha'i writings also refer to the three stations of the
Manifestation of God. From the chapter on (<The Three Stations of the
Divine Manifestations" in Some Answered Questions, 'Abdu'1-Bahá
explains:

        "Know that the Holy Manifestations, though They have the
        degrees of endless perfections, yet, speaking generally, have only
 56              THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

           three stations. The first station is the physical; the second station
           is the human, which is that of the rational soul; the third is that of
           the divine appearance and the heavenly splendour.

           The physical station is phenomenal; it is composed of elements,
           and necessarily everything that is composed is subject to
           decomposition. It is not possible that a composition should not be
           disintegrated.

          The second is the station of the rational soul, which is the human
          reality. This also is phenomenal, and the Holy Manifestations
          share it with all mankind.

          Know that, although the human soul has existed on the earth for
          prolonged times and ages, yet it is phenomenal. As it is a divine
          sign, when once it has come into existence, it is eternal. The spirit
          of man has a beginning, but is has no end; it continues eternally...

          The third station is that of the divine appearance and heavenly
          splendour: it is the Word of God, the Eternal Bounty, the Holy
          Spirit. It has neither beginning nor end, for these things are related
          to the world of contingencies and not to the divine world. For God
          the end is the same thing as the beginning. So the reckoning of
          days, weeks, months and years, of yesterday and today, is
          connected to the terrestrial globe; but in the sun there is no such
          thing - there is neither yesterday, today nor tomorrow, neither
          months nor years: all are equal. In the same way the Word of God
          is purified from all these conditions and is exempt from the
          boundaries, the laws and the limits of the world of contingency.
          Therefore, the reality of prophethood, which is the; Word of God
          and the perfect state of manifestation, did not have any beginning
          and will not have any end; its rising is different from all others
          and is like that of the sun..."32

Baha'u'llah also wrote in Gleanings as follows:


32
      ' Abdu'l Bahá, Some Answered Questions, p 151.
               Mahayana Buddhism and the Bahá 7 Faith                      57
          <(
           These Manifestations of God have each a twofold station. One
         is the station of pure abstraction and essential unity. In this
         respect, if thou callest them all by one name, and dost ascribe to
         them the same attributes, thou hast not erred from the truth. Even
         as He hath revealed: Wo distinction do We make between any of
         His Messengers.'...

         The other station is the station of distinction, and pertaineth to the
         world of creation, and to the limitations thereof. In this respect,
         each Manifestation of God hath a distinct individuality, a
         definitely prescribed mission, a predestined revelation, and
         specially designated limitations. Each one of them is known by a
         different name, is characterised by a special attribute, fulfils a
         definite mission, and is entrusted with a particular Revelation...

         It is because of this difference in their station and mission that the
         words and utterances flowing from these Well Springs of Divine
         knowledge appear to divulge and differ. Otherwise, in the eyes of
         them that are initiated into the mysteries of Divine wisdom, all
         their utterances are, in reality but the expressions of one Truth...

         Even as He saith: "I am the servant of God. I am but a man^l like
         you. "... Were any of the all-embracing Manifestations of God to
         declare: (T am God, " He, verily, speaketh the truth, and no doubt
         attacheth thereto.34

The "three stations" mentioned by Abdu'l Baha do not directly correlate
with the Triple Bodies of Mahayana Buddhism, but are very similar. The
Body of Essence roughly corresponds to the "Word of God", the third
station. The Body of Transformation is obviously similar to the "physical"
station. The Body of Bliss however, more accurately corresponds to the
Holy Spirit, rather than the "rational soul". The Holy Spirit in the Baha'i
writings is described to be an emanation of the Word of God (The Body of



33
     Here BaháVlláh was also referring to the Prophet Mohammad.

 58             THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

Essence). It is likened to the rays of the Sun, where the Sun represents
God or His Manifestations.

Salvation of the Individual

In the Baha'i Faith, the individual's salvation is a personal journey from
him to God that covers both this physical world and the next (that is the
spiritual world). He has to develop his spiritual faculties to the fullest in
this earthly life. In the next life, he will then be able to attain a higher
spiritual station and his soul can move closer to God.

The Baha'i Faith has no clergy. All believers are required to work towards
salvation and this privilege is not restricted to the clergy, as in the case of
The Sangha of Theravada Buddhism. Similar to the Baha'i Faith,
Mahayana offers salvation to all sentient beings besides those in The
Sangha. It teaches that all sentient beings possess the Buddha-nature in
them and the potential to achieve enlightenment is inherent in everyone. In
this respect, both Mahayana Buddhism and the Baha'i Faith are more
accessible and acceptable to the peoples of the world and less elitist in
orientation.

The Differing Views on Suffering

In Theravada, suffering is something to be escaped from. However, in
Mahayana suffering is considered to be necessary in the journey to
deliverance for the believer. If we recall, the bodhisattva's primary
concern is to bring others to enlightenment even if his or her practice
remains unperfected. This concern is inherent in the first universal vow35
of the bodhisattva, "However innumerable sentient beings are, I vow to
bring about their release." He is not preoccupied with concern over
suffering but volunteers to share the suffering of the masses.


35
    The other three of the four universal vows of the bodhisattva (pranidhana) are:
        (2) However limitless my defilements are, I vow to extinguish them;
        (3) However immeasurable the Buddha's teachings are, I vow to learn them;
        (4) However infinite enlightenment is, I vow to attain Buddhahood.
See Kogen Mizuno, Essentials of Buddhism, p.213.
              Mahayana Buddhism and the Bahá 7 Faith                        59

Baha'u'llah teaches that suffering is not just the consequence of being cut
off from God's love. Suffering tempers the individual and makes him
realise his vulnerability and spiritual need. It renders him accessible to
God's love. From Baha'u'llah:

          "The true lover yearneth for tribulation even as doth the rebel
         for forgiveness and the sinful for mercy. "36

The Need to Serve Humanity

For the Baha'i, to serve humanity means to be active in attaining
individual spiritual progress and to be of service to society. He has to
participate fully in the life of society and to help build a new World Order,
based on the blueprint drawn up by the Central Figures of the Faith.
Baha'u'llah stipulates that:

          "all men have been created to carry forth an ever-advancing
         civilisation. "37

The Baha'i's mission in life has some similarities to the bodhisattva. A
good Buddhist is a bodhisattva in the making. The latter is the foundation
of the morality of Mahayana. He postpones his entry to Nirvana to remain
in this earthly abode to help all sentient beings in Samsara attain salvation.
Baha'u'llah states, "The heaven of divine wisdom is illumined with the
two illuminaries of consultation and compassion."38 Similarly, for the
bodhisattva it is Compassion and Wisdom.

In Mahayana, the believer is exhorted to follow the example of the
bodhisattva who is motivated by a desire to serve all sentient beings and
lead them to salvation. The Baha'i writings exhort the individual to
develop his innate spiritual potential:

            "How lofty is the station which man, if he but choose to fulfil his
           high destiny, can attain! To what depths of degradation he can
           sink, depths which the meanest of creatures have never
           reached."19

The Concepts of the Soul

In Theravada Buddhism there is the notion of a composite or compounded
soul - this does not survive death and is similar to the animal self of
human nature in other spiritual traditions. On the other hand, there is a
non-composite or uncompounded entity, usually referred to as a stainless
or perfect Mind (see quotations below). The Mind and its purification is
similar to the soul of other spiritual traditions. Buddhism does not reject
the existence of the soul, it prefers to speak of the mind and its
purification.

            "Instructing all the world I will show to it Nirvana; those Four
           Noble Truths must be heard first and comprehended by the
           soul "40

           "This body composed of the five Skandhas, and produced from the
          five elements, is all empty and without soul, and arises from the
           action of The Chain of Causation. "41

            "Listen all of you for your happiness, with your minds free from
           stain, — I will declare to you step by step this Chain of
           Causation. "42

            "and in the end he shall even become a Buddha, -- he, possessing
           a thoroughly pure intelligence, shall obtain these eight sublime
           rewards of merit. "43

          "He, having his soul pure, will attain these eight forms of
         absolute spotlessness; yea, wherever this method of the Law will
         prevail universally. "44

Although the Buddha's emphasis is on the mode of conduct of sentient
beings, He has referred to the existence of the universal Mind or the
"Element":

          "The Element (Cause) is without beginning in time. It is the
          common foundation of all dharmas. Because it exists there also
          exist all places of rebirth and the full attainment of Nirvana. "45

BaháVlláh writes that in the next world, the soul "... will assume the form
that best befitteth its immortality".46 And • Abdu'1-Bahá explains that:

          "... in the other world the human reality doth not assume a
         physical form, rather doth it take on a heavenly form, made up of
         elements of that heavenly realm, "47 ancj n remains "in the degree
         of purity to which it has evolved during life in the physical
         body. "48

'Abdu'1-Bahá, referring to the condition of the soul after death, said that at
the physical death when the body is decomposed:

          "... only consciousness ... is left... After death the condition is one
          which cannot be clearly explained in words. It is one of
          comprehension, understanding, which involves all other things —
         feeling, etc.

 62               THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

           You will retain your individuality and will not be swallowed up in
           one vast spirit. Concerning the condition of the human soul after
           its ascension from the material world: the essence of the human
           soul is clarified from material substances and purified from the
           embodiment of physical things. It is exclusively luminous; it has
           no body; it is a dazzling pencil of light; it is a celestial orb of
           brightness. "49

The Baha'i Faith explains that for man as an individual, his earthly life is
only a preparation for the life beyond. The soul will take the consequences
or reap the fruits of its life in this world. This view is close to Buddhism.
Baha'u'llah writes:

            "Every pure, every refined and sanctified soul will be- endowed
           with tremendous power, and shall rejoice with exceeding
           gladness"; "... all men shall, after their physical death, estimate
           the worth of their deeds, and realise all that their hands have
           wrought", "... the souls of the infidels ... shall ...be made aware
           of the good things that have escaped them "50

It is evident that the souls occupy different stages in the world beyond
according to "what they acquire of virtues or vices in this world".51
' Abdu'1-Bahá writes:

            "Know that immortality belongs to such souls as have been
           imbued with the spirit of life.
           Beside them all the others are lifeless -- they are dead,52 as
           Christ explained the Gospel. "53

The Journey of the Soul

When the body disappears, the mind, which is linked to the body,54
disappears. When the mind disappears, animal and human nature will
disappear too. There is no longer any tension between the physical and
spiritual nature typical of man's earthly life. This is called the dual nature
of the soul. The unremitting necessity of choosing between material and
spiritual attraction, typical of this earthly life, disappears. The soul's
journey will be a progressive and continuous "approaching unto God,"55
through the bounties of the Manifestation of God. Whoever has learnt
during his earthly life how to profit from His bounties, will profit from
them all the more in the next world.

The condition of the soul after the death of the body is not stationary as it
proceeds in its never-ending journey back to God. In the next world, the
soul's progress is influenced by the bounties of the Manifestations of God
and by the intercession of other souls. These are those souls who are still
in this world and those souls who have ascended into the Abha Kingdom.
' Abdu'1-Bahá says:

          "... it is certain that those who are near the Divine Court are
         allowed to intercede, and this intercession is approved by God.
         But intercession in the other world is not like the intercession in
         this world.
         It is another thing, another reality, which cannot be expressed in
         words. "56

This condition of the soul is not a static one. It is explained by 'Abdu'l-
Bahá:



54
     In the Baha'i texts the mind is described as the manifestation of the mental faculties
of the soul through the agency of the brain. Since mind is not the only cognitive means
at man's disposal, it follows that though man's intelligence (or reason, or intellect) is
conditioned by his mind, yet it is not identical with it.

            "... nothing which exists remains in a state of repose, ...as the
           spirit continues to develop after death, it necessarily progresses
           or declines; and in the other world to cease to progress is the
           same as to decline; but it never leaves its own condition, in which
           it continues to develop. "51

In Baha'u'llah's Seven Valleys, the individual's search for Truth is written
in mystical language. These valleys represent different stages in the
progress of the soul and are described in the following way:

           "the seven stages which the soul of the seeker must needs traverse
           ere it can attain the object of its existence. "58

The soul's journey involves going through seven stages before it reaches
the object of its existence, which is unification with its Creator. In the first
valley, called the Valley of Search, Baha'u'llah uses passionate terms. The
soul longs to be reunited with its beloved. The searcher is anguished as he
does not know which path to take. The subsequent valleys show him the
way. Baha'u'llah says the search is one of burning intensity. It is the fire a
true lover feels when he is separated from his beloved.

Whoever has entered into the Seventh Valley, called The Valley of True
Poverty and Absolute Nothingness, has reached a climax in his spiritual
life: he has transcended his own personal self, so that he becomes
"nothing", "empty", and perfectly mirrors the light of God. The spiritual
condition of The Seven Valleys is similar to the Sunyata (Emptiness) of
Mahayana and the Nirvana (Nothingness) of Theravada.

           "Yea, all he hath, from heart to skin, will be set aflame, so that
           nothing will remain save the Friend. "59

         "O My Servant, Thou art even as a finely tempered sword
         concealed in the darkness of its sheath and its value hidden from
         the artificer's knowledge. Wherefore come forth from the sheath
         of self and desire that thy worth may be made resplendent and
         manifest unto all the world. "^

We have to free ourselves from our intellectual baggage and stand simple
and naked before God, like a humble little child. We have to "empty" the
self completely of what we imagine ourselves to be until we find the
Manifestation of God residing within our heart.

          "O Son of Spirit!.... Turn thy sight unto thyself that thou may est
        find Me standing within thee, mighty, powerful and self-
         subsisting. "61

'Abdu'1-Bahá says:
         n
           ... the human spirit is a Divine Trust, and it must traverse all
         conditions, for its passage and movements through the conditions
         of existence will be the means of its acquiring perfections ...when
         the human spirit passes through the conditions of existence, it will
         become the possessor of each degree and station. "62

Human life is thus a "journey of the soul back to God," and "the pathway
of life is the road which leads to divine knowledge and attainment"61.
"Every atom in existence and the essence of all created things" declares
BaháVlláh, "is for our training."6*

66            THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

5. Conclusion

This paper has given a brief introduction of Mahayana Buddhism and
compared some of its doctrines to the Baha'i Faith. There is common
ground between them in terms of their ultimate goal for individual
spiritual development, and the Mahayana concept of Sunyata (Emptiness)
is similar to Baha'u'llah's 'Valley of True Poverty and Absolute
Nothingness". There is also convergence in the way Mahayana Buddhists
and Baha'is attempt to describe the nature of their respective founders.
The Mahayana doctrine of the "Triple Bodies of the Buddha" has points of
similarity with the Baha'i "Three stations of the Manifestations".
Common also to both Faiths is the injunction to strike a balance between
individual self-enlightenment and universal salvation.

Within the constraints of time and space this paper has only made a
provisional attempt at finding and highlighting the common ground
between Mahayana Buddhism and the Baha'i Faith. The author hopes that
it will inspire more detailed studies in the future.
