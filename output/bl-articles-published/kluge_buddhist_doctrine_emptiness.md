The Baha’i Writings and the Buddhist Doctrine of Emptiness:

An Initial Survey

I: Preface

This paper is an expansion of the section on emptiness in a previous paper, “Buddhism
and the Bahá’í Writings: An Ontological Rapprochement” (Lights of Irfan, Vol. 8, 2007). The
purpose of the 2007 paper was to show that the Bahá’í Writings and key Buddhist teachings
were either in agreement or on a convergent path in regards to key ontological issues. The
current paper carries that project further by focusing specifically on the Buddhist doctrine of
emptiness and exploring the extent of the agreements and convergences with the Bahá’í
Writings.

For Bahá’ís, there are at least four major reasons to study the Buddhist doctrine of
emptiness. In the first place, emptiness is the signature teaching of Buddhism, the culmination
of its teachings about impermanence, dependent origination and ‘no-self’ however these may be
interpreted by the various schools. Thus, an understanding of Buddhism requires acquaintance
with the doctrine of emptiness. Since the Bahá’í Faith recognizes Buddhism as a revelation
from God, such understanding is also important because Buddhism is part of the history of
God’s unfolding revelation to humankind and, as such, offers knowledge about our relationship
to the transcendent. Second, if we wish to live peacefully with our neighbors, we must know
what they believe in order to understand and appreciate them as human beings. There are over
379 million Buddhists in Asia, and countless more living in cultures influenced by its teachings.

\[1\] Third, knowledge of Buddhism and its key doctrines is necessary for understanding
intellectual and spiritual developments in the modern world. Buddhism is making significant
and well-publicized in-roads into the intellectual and religious life of North America and
Europe. The Dalai Lama, the charismatic leader of Tibetan Gelugpa Buddhism, is now a
universally recognized figure who speaks to packed sports stadiums about Buddhist philosophy
and living, as well as about the independence of Tibet. His books are best-sellers. Obviously
what he says meets some spiritual needs in large numbers of people. Fourth, a better

understanding of Buddhism in general and its signature doctrine of emptiness allows Bahá’ís to
engage in intelligent and in-depth inter-faith dialogue with Buddhists and those with Buddhist
sympathies. Such dialogue can also help deepen our understanding of the Bahá’í Writings from
new perspectives.

This paper will provide further evidence that despite differences of expression, the
Bahá’í
Writings and Buddhist sutras show agreements and strong convergences on the subject of
emptiness and its associated doctrines. The author interprets this as additional support for
Bahá'u'lláh’s teaching of the essential unity of all religions.

II: Introduction to Emptiness

The Buddhist doctrine of emptiness is the logical culmination of the Buddha’s teachings
on suffering, impermanence, dependent origination and ‘no-self.’ The reasoning process begins
with the Buddha’s First Noble Truth, viz. “life is suffering,” i.e. that being alive is inherently
unsatisfactory insofar as frustration, disappointment or unsatisfactoriness are inevitable and
apparently inescapable. The root cause of this suffering is the impermanent or transitory nature
of all things and mental states and, consequently, our inability to ‘hang on’ to them or to find
rest and peace. The Buddha says,

> Impermanent are all component things,
> They arise and cease, that is their nature,
> They come into being and pass away 2

When all things are in perpetual flux, rest, peace, satisfaction and happiness are impossible
because none of these conditions can be more than momentary. We are constantly being tossed
about by the storms of change. This, of course, means that all things and mental states have only
a momentary existence. However, we need not be ‘tempest-tossed’ if we analyze our situation
and discover the fact of dependent origination according to which all things come into existence
in dependence on other things. Things always change because everything is influenced by
everything else, indeed, depends on everything else for its temporary existence. Nothing is
ontologically independent or stands by itself. According to the Buddha,

> When there is this, that is.
> With the arising of this, that arises.
> When this is not, neither is that.

With the cessation of this, that ceases.3

In other words, everything arises or falls in dependence on previous conditions or causes, and
nothing arises without such conditions or causes. Things do not exist in and of themselves but
only in relation to other things; consequently, their existence is relative and provisional, not

absolute. In Buddhist terms, they have no essence, i.e. they have no substantial and no
unchanging or ‘eternal’ nature. Furthermore, they lack an independent self-nature or self which
is to say they are ‘empty.’ This does not mean that things do not exist but that they do not exist
as we tend to think they do: “emptiness defines how things exist – relationally and
impermanently – and is not, therefore, the assertion that things somehow do not exist at all.”4
Things have a provisional or conventional existence that we may agree on for the sake of
convenience but, if we analyze them, they have no ultimately real nature. There is no enduring
substance ‘behind’ or ‘within’ them; nothing is immune from change.

This leads to what is perhaps the most debated feature of Buddhist thought: the concept
of ‘no-self.’ If we analyze a human being – the way Nagasena analyzed King Milinda’s chariot
– we would find no part that is the ‘self’ just as King Milinda found no part that is the
‘chariot.’5 Simple and straightforward as this sounds, there is no agreement among the major
Buddhist schools about what the ‘no-self’ teaching actually means. For example, the
Tathagatagharba tradition (which includes Zen and the Pure Land) asserts that the ‘no-self’
teaching refers to the ego and personality which has been deluded, misled and defiled by the
world and that beneath this ego lies a pure Buddha-nature. ‘No-self’ simply means that
disappearance of the defilements and the appearance of the Buddha-nature. In the Theravada,
the Nikayas view the ‘no-self’ teaching not as a metaphysical doctrine about what does or does
not exist but rather as a soteriological doctrines meant to gain release from enslavement to the
ego or sense of self. Its orientation is purely practical as illustrated in the Buddha’s story about a
man shot with an arrow. His only interest is in having the arrow removed, not in the nature of
the arrow, the personality of the enemy archer or the reason he was shot.6

> The Anatta teaching is not a doctrine of no-self, but a not-self strategy for shedding
> suffering by letting go of its cause, leading to the highest, undying happiness. At that
> point, questions of self, no-self, and not-self fall aside. Once there's the experience of
> such total freedom, where would there be any concern about what's experiencing it, or
> whether or not it's a self?7

On the other hand, the Madhyamika School in the Mahayana tradition rigorously insists that
from the ultimate perspective of dependent origination no self exists at all insofar as a
permanent and autonomous ‘self’ or ego or personality have only has a conventional or
provisional existence. Even here, the exact meaning of the Madhyamika claim is subject to
debate. Moreover, as we shall see below, still other versions of the ‘no-self’ teaching exist,
notably the Yogacara version.

Before we explore these ideas in greater detail, let us briefly review what the Bahá’í
Writings have to say about these issues. Regarding the Buddha’s First Noble Truth that ‘life is
suffering’ or unsatisfactory we recall `Abdu'l-Bahá’s statement about the San Francisco
earthquake: “Such events ought to awaken people and they should attach themselves less to the
mortal world; for the earthly world hath such painful experiences and offers such cups from the
bitter wine.”8 In a similar vein, he says, “This mortal world is fickle and unstable like unto a
shifting shadow, and the human life is like unto a mirage and a reflection on the water.”9
Elsewhere, he states, “man . . . in this world of being toileth and suffereth for a time, with divers
ills and pains, and ultimately disintegrates, leaving no trace and no fruit after him.”10 The
agreement with the First Noble Truth is obvious and requires no further elaboration.

The Bahá’í Writings also agree with the doctrine of impermanence. `Abdu'l-Bahá says,

> nothing which exists remains in a state of repose--that is to say, all things are in motion.
> Everything is either growing or declining; all things are either coming from
> nonexistence into being, or going from existence into nonexistence . . . This state of
> motion is said to be essential--that is, natural; it cannot be separated from beings
> because it is their essential requirement, as it is the essential requirement of fire to burn.

> Thus it is established that this movement is necessary to existence, which is either
> growing or declining. 11

It is important to notice the categorical nature of `Abdu'l-Bahá’s statements: “nothing” is in
repose, “all things are in motion” and movement is “necessary to existence.” This universal
language implies that not just material things or beings are subject to constant change, but also
thoughts, feelings, personal identities and the whole gamut of events in our psycho-spiritual
existence. As Bahá'u'lláh says we

> should regard all else beside God as transient, and count all things save Him, Who is the
> Object of all adoration, as utter nothingness.12

Here, too, the categorical language is essential: everything except God is impermanent and all
other beings are contingent. As `Abdu'l-Bahá says, “Transformation from condition to condition
is the attribute of contingent realities.”13 Thus, it is clear that both the Bahá’í Writings and
Buddhism agree that impermanence is the fundamental nature of all phenomenal existence.
From this it logically follows that we are self-condemned to suffering and dissatisfaction if we
allow ourselves to become too attached to the things of this world and try to hold on to them.

What else but frustration and suffering can follow from trying to do the impossible.? Speaking
in terms of the story of Adam and Eve in Genesis, `Abdu'l-Bahá states,

> For attachment to the world has become the cause of the bondage of spirits, and this
> bondage is identical with sin, which has been transmitted from Adam to His posterity. It
> is because of this attachment that men have been deprived of essential spirituality and
> exalted position.14

These attachments cause us, and others, a great deal of suffering insofar as they force us to live
in “bondage,” i.e. as a slave to the things of this world. Moreover, these attachments degrade us
from our “exalted position” and deprive us of our “essential spirituality” (cf. Buddha-nature).
The only escape from this oppression is detachment which the Writings and the Buddhist
Scriptures praise as the necessary condition for freedom: “Cast away that which ye possess,
and, on the wings of detachment, soar beyond all created things.”15 Elsewhere, Bahá'u'lláh says
that His

> sole purpose in revealing to thee these words is to sanctify thee from the transitory
> things of the earth, and aid thee to enter the realm of everlasting glory, that thou mayest,
> by the leave of God, be of them that abide and rule therein....16

For Buddhists, this “realm of everlasting glory” is nirvana which can only be attained when the
struggle against impermanence ends.

The doctrine of impermanence is the basis of the concept of dependent origination or
dependent arising. The importance of this teaching is made clear by the Buddha’s statement that
“Whoso understands dependent origination, understands the Law [Dhamma or Dharma], and
who understands the Law understands dependent origination.”17 The “Law” in this case is that
everything arises as a result of causes or conditions beyond itself and that everything declines as
a result of causes and conditions itself. As noted above, the usual Buddhist formula for
causality is

> When there is this, that is.
> With the arising of this, that arises.
> When this is not, neither is that.

With the cessation of this, that ceases.18

It should be noted that the views on what constitutes causality differ among various traditions
such as the Theravada and the Madhyamika, but there is no argument about dependent

origination itself. Nothing is fully independent or uncaused and/or unconditioned by anything
else; we exist as long as the appropriate causes and/or conditions are present. Therefore, things
do not exist in and of themselves which in effect is to say that their being is relative and not
absolute. In other words, all things are inter-dependent. The following statement by `Abdu'l-
Bahá conveys the same idea:

> For all beings are connected together like a chain; and reciprocal help, assistance and
> interaction belonging to the properties of things are the causes of the existence,
> development and growth of created beings. It is confirmed through evidences and proofs
> that every being universally acts upon other beings, either absolutely or through
> association. Finally, the perfection of each individual being--is due to the composition
> of the elements, to their measure, to their balance, to the mode of their combination, and
> to mutual influence. When all these are gathered together, then man exists.19

Clearly, our existence is not independent; indeed, “man exists” only when the right conditions
are “gathered together” which is another way of saying that we are contingent, dependent
beings. Only God is absolute, i.e. not dependent on conditions and, therefore, transcends the
processes of the phenomenal world. `Abdu'l-Bahá’s statement emphasizes that all created
beings are radically contingent, i.e. their existence and their attributes depend not only
ultimately on God but also immediately on their interactions with the other elements of
creation. Here, too, there is basic agreement between the Writings and the Buddha’s teachings.

Provisional existence – Buddhists often refer to it as ‘conventional’ existence – does not
mean that things are unreal but that they do not have absolute, eternal reality in-and-of-
themselves. For that reason, they are called ‘empty’ and the fact of their absolute contingency
i.e. inter-dependence is described as ‘emptiness.’ However, there is something else to
remember: the provisional or conventional reality has self-sufficient existence or is ‘real’ from
its own standpoint but lacks self-sufficient existence and is ‘unreal’ from the standpoint of
dependent origination itself. In other words, the existence or reality things possess is relative
and one of our tasks to is see through this to the “ultimate truth”20 of their emptiness. We shall
say more about this subject below.

III: Emptiness in the Madhyamika School

With this background in mind, it is time to examine the concept of emptiness in several
Buddhist schools and in the Bahá’í Writings. We shall start with the Madhyamika tradition
because the Madhyamika school represents the most radical interpretation of ‘emptiness.’ It
says not only that things are empty but also that emptiness itself is empty.21 From this position
numerous radical consequences follow.

\[21\] C.W. Huntington with Gesghe Wangchen, The Emptiness of Emptiness.

The Madhyamika school of Mahayana Buddhism began in the 2nd Century C.E. with the
work of Nagarjuna, an Indian philosopher. His principle work is the Mulamadhyamakakarika
(Fundamental Verses of the Middle Way; usually abbreviated as MMK) is a philosophical
explication of the Perfection of Wisdom sutras22 which appeared in the 1st century BCE and
include the famous Heart Sutra with its eloquent emphasis on the emptiness of all things,
thoughts and conditions.23 In the MMK, Nagarjuna presents his philosophical/logical
explications of the Buddha’s doctrine of emptiness in a series of four-line verses based on a
four-value logic called tetralemmas. By means of these tetralemmas, Nagarjuna and the
Madhyamikas who followed him attempted to show how any positive philosophical statement
about reality leads to contradictions and even absurd conclusions.24 Our goal is to free ourselves
from any kind of conceptual thinking and, therefore, from all purely intellectual viewpoints.25

Here is an example in which Nagarjuna discusses the relationship between past, present
and future.

> If the present and the future
> Depend on the past,
> Then the present and future
> Would have existed in the past.

> If the present and future
> Did not exist there,
> How could the present and future
> Depend upon it?26

The goal of these verses is to make us doubt our concepts of time by showing how they lead to
contradictions. In this example, he demonstrates how the common belief that the present and the
future are based on the past leads to a problem: if that is so, the present and future must
somehow have existed in the past. But that is counter-intuitive – obviously if they already
existed in the past, they would not be the present and the future. However, if they did not exist
in the past, how could they eventually depend on it? Where did they come from? How are they
related to the past? The purpose of the exercise is to make us realize that our concepts or
conventions do not really apply to time at all. The puzzles exist only because we are ‘trapped’
within certain concepts or conventions for which all philosophical statements about its nature
are untenable. As Nagarjuna writes in the dedicatory verses at the start of the MMK,

> Whatever is dependently arisen is
> Unceasing, unborn,
> Unannihilated, not permanent,

> Not coming, not going,
> Without distinction, without identity,
> And free from conceptual construction.27

According to Nagarjuna, all descriptions or statements about reality are imputations or
constructions. They are our own conceptions or constructions and do not provide any
information about reality. This is because whatever we say about any aspect of reality consists
of nothing but our imputations and attributions, and, therefore, our statements are purely
conventional: “the criteria for identity we posit will end up being purely conventional.”28 For
example, we call an arrangement in which a flat surface is mounted on four vertical sticks a
‘table’ – but that is simply a matter of our agreement. What a table is – or a flower or river or
clothes – are all mere matters of convention, i.e. constructions. Of course, as conventions, they
are quite real; their mode of existing is as a convention and the Madhyamika do not deny this.
What they deny is the idea that there is an unchanging essence, a ‘tableness’ that is not subject
to dependent origination and that lasts through the destruction of the table itself. Similarly, they
– and all Buddhists – deny that there is a human essence or self apart from the combination of
components that compose us. Ultimately, all things are conventions or human constructions,
and, therefore, empty, i.e. have no ultimate reality.

Is there anything in the Bahá’í Writings that converges with or even accommodates the
Madhyamika outlook? There are, indeed, various passages in the Bahá’í Writings conveying a
convergent viewpoint. For example, `Abdu'l-Bahá writes,

> The second proposition is that existence and nonexistence are both relative. If it be said
> that such a thing came into existence from nonexistence, this does not refer to absolute
> nonexistence, but means that its former condition in relation to its actual condition was
> nothingness . . . Man, like the mineral, is existing; but the existence of the mineral in
> relation to that of man is nothingness, for when the body of man is annihilated it
> becomes dust and mineral. . . . Though the dust -- that is to say, the mineral -- has
> existence in its own condition, in relation to man it is nothingness. Both exist, but the
> existence of dust and mineral, in relation to man, is nonexistence and nothingness . . .

> Therefore, though the world of contingency exists, in relation to the existence of God it
> is nonexistent and nothingness. . . . In the same way, the existence of creation in relation
> to the existence of God is nonexistence. 29

The theme of these statements is the relativity of existence – and it converges with the
Madhyamika position. This becomes clear once we realize that the Madhyamika term
‘emptiness’ and the Bahá’í terms ‘nothingness’ and ‘contingent’ convey similar, if not identical
meanings. Let us recall that ‘emptiness’ refers to an object’s dependence on the process of
dependent origination; it has no existence on its own and certainly no permanent existence. In

\[29\] `Abdu'l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, p. 280.

Bahá’í language, it is absolutely ‘contingent.’ From the ultimate viewpoint of dependent
origination, it does not exist inherently, intrinsically from “its own side,”30 although from its
own, conventional viewpoint it does. In the same way, `Abdu'l-Bahá tells us that a thing “has
existence in its own condition,” that the “world of contingency exists,” but in relationship to
God’s existence, their existence is “nonexistent and nothingness.” In short, they are ‘empty’ to
use the Buddhist term. ‘Emptiness,’ provisionality and conventionality are their mode of
existence whether in relation to God or dependent origination. The Writings describe this
situation as “nothingness.” However, it is a relative “nothingness” not the absolute
“nothingness” which the Writings – and the Madhyamika – categorically reject.31 It should also
be noted that in addition to relative nothingness or emptiness vis-à-vis God, the Writings
support the idea of ‘emptiness’ from the perspective of the processes of phenomenal reality, i.e.
the interactions and influences among the cosmic elements. Everything that exists depends on
those universal cosmic process.

Other passages in the Writings point us out the ‘emptiness’ of the phenomenal world.

For example, `Abdu'l-Bahá says,

> Know thou that the Kingdom is the real world, and this nether place is only its shadow
> stretching out. A shadow hath no life of its own; its existence is only a fantasy, and
> nothing more; it is but images reflected in water, and seeming as pictures to the eye.32

Words like “fantasy,” “shadow” and “pictures” clearly express the idea of a world that is less
than absolutely real. However, these words are more than striking metaphors. Fantasies and
pictures are things we make or construct in some way, i.e. images in the human mind. These are
often rooted in our lower animal nature. How many of these conventions or constructs are based
on greed, selfishness, hatred, lust, power-hunger etc? Thus, if we take these images as
ultimately real, then we are deceived, either because of a lack of thought, and/or our
enslavement to imitations. Bahá'u'lláh says,

> Verily I say, the world is like the vapor in a desert, which the thirsty dreameth to be
> water and striveth after it with all his might, until when he cometh unto it, he findeth it
> to be mere illusion33

In examining this image, we note that the phrase the “thirsty man dreameth,” i.e. he imputes
attributes to the vapors and thereby creates for himself a ‘world.’ What makes the dream
illusory is that our concepts, beliefs and attitudes, i.e. our conventions create a world-picture
that we confuse with reality. In truth, however, this world or, more accurately, this ‘world-
picture’ is empty not only because of dependent origination but because it is no more than a
human-made construct or set of conventions. In a similar vein, `Abdu'l-Bahá says, “If we suffer

it is the outcome of material things, and all the trials and troubles come from this world of
illusion.”34
It is we who make this world-picture on the basis of our own imputations, and consequently
suffer from it. Of course, the goal is to attain freedom: “Release yourselves, O nightingales of
God, from the thorns and brambles of wretchedness and misery, and wing your flight to the
rose-garden of unfading splendor.”35

The foregoing discussion has shown how the Writings and Madhyamika teachings are
on a convergent path on the issue of dependent origination and some of its consequences.
However, this only opens up a new issue: whether or not anything transcends or is exempt from
dependent origination. These issues are not clear in Buddhism. As Jay Garfield says,

> Exactly how this dependency [dependent origination] is spelled out and exactly what its
> status is, is a matter of considerable debate within Buddhist philosophy . . . Nagarjuna
> was very much concerned to stake out a radical and revealing position. 36

For example, nirvana itself has been suggested as one such exception to dependent origination.
The Buddha describes nirvana in the following words:

> There is, monks, an unborn, a not-become, a not-made, a not-compounded. If, monks,
> there were not this unborn, not-become, not-made, not-compounded, there would not
> here be an escape from the born, the become, the made, the compounded. But because
> there is an unborn, a not-become, the compounded.37

Clearly, in this passage, nirvana – whether it be a condition or an ontological entity – is not
subject to dependent origination and in that sense is an absolute. The Tathagatagarbha schools
accept that the tathagatagarbha itself transcends dependent origination and is eternal i.e.
unchanging and also possesses positive and essential attributes purity, bliss (satisfactoriness)
and even self.38 The Yogacara philosophers, for example, pointed out that Nagarjuna had
forgotten to take into account the consciousness to which his arguments appeared; no matter
what turn his arguments took, no matter what one believed about dependent origination,
consciousness of them remained. Thus, the Yogacara accept dependent origination but develop
into a different direction in which mind transcends dependent origination. Consciousness
endures; it is.

These different views are significant because from the perspective of the Writings, the
minimal ontological requirement for God is absolute or “pure independence”39 which obviously

transcends dependent origination. Thus, from the perspective of the Writings, any Buddhist
philosophy which accepts the idea that something transcends dependent origination, and,
therefore, transcends conventionality and emptiness has met the minimal ontological
requirement for some version of theism. As we shall see in more detail later, the Writings
converge more clearly in this respect with the Tathagatagarbha and Yogacara traditions about
emptiness than they do with Nagarjuna’s MMK and its Madhyamika successors. If we accept
Nagarjuna’s claims on this issue at face value, there is a clear divergence with the Writings on
this issue.

The radical nature of Nagarjuna’s theory of emptiness is evident insofar as he holds that
even emptiness itself is empty.40 Indeed, Huntington suggests that “the Madhyamika be read as
a radical attempt at abandoning the obsession with a metaphysical absolute.”41 Although this
view is highly influential, this is not a universal view for as already noted above, various
Buddhist traditions disagree with this understanding of emptiness. However, if even emptiness
is empty, i.e. is subject to dependent origination and is a mere convention, then it also follows
that dependent origination itself is empty, subject to dependent origination and a convention.
Obviously, there is no room for metaphysical absolutes in this version of the Madhyamika;
moreover, no philosophical statements can lead to knowledge of the truth of emptiness. As
Huntington points out, “The truth of emptiness must be realized in direct awareness of the
paradox and mystery of mundane experience.”42 It cannot be put into philosophic statements
without causing serious difficulties.

This view accords somewhat with the Bahá’í teachings about the unknowability of God
but not with the Bahá’í teachings about our knowledge of reality. According to `Abdu'l-Bahá,
proof that an absolute, God, exists can be known43 but the nature of God is “is beyond our
comprehension; for the essential names and attributes of God are identical with His Essence,
and His Essence is above all comprehension.”44 Whatever we say – in distinction to what the
Manifestations say – about God is strictly conventional, a product of our time, place and
culture, i.e. our knowledge of Him is conventional, and subject to dependent origination. Verbal
descriptions and philosophic statements cannot do more than provide conventional and/or
intellectual understanding of God’s nature. Indeed, this view is an integral part of progressive
revelation in which the conventional knowledge of God from one dispensation is renewed and
expanded in another.

However, in contrast to Nagarjuna and Madhyamika successors, the Bahá’í Writings do
not teach that all statements about reality are doomed to self-contradiction or absurdity.
Genuine knowledge about reality is certainly possible and, thereby, progress in knowledge and
understanding. Otherwise, why would we need progressive revelation if humankind did not
make progress, leaving behind untenable views and ultimately requiring a new revelation?

Progress, of course, is one of the reasons the Writings put so much emphasis on science since
without science genuine progress is impossible. Scientific progress is not only convention.

IV Emptiness, Essence and Self

One of the key features of the Madhyamika understanding of dependent origination is
the concept of no essence. Because everything is constantly coming into and passing out of
existence, there is no such thing as an essence, i.e. a stable and substantial aspect that remains
the same throughout all the changes and which can be identified as such by us. Garfield says
that for Nagarjuna everything is

> empty of inherent existence or self-nature, or, in more Western terms essence. . . that
> [the tables’s] existence as the object that it is – as a table – depends not on it, nor on
> purely nonrelational characteristics but depends on us as well. 45

If a table – as table – has no inherent, i.e. independent existence apart from the components that
compose it, then neither does anything have a self, including human beings. ‘Self’ is simply
what happens when the right components interact in the right way. When the required inter-
action ends, so does the ‘self.’ As Donald Lopez Jr. says, “The Madhyamika claim is that
nothing is ultimately findable under analysis. Everything is empty, even emptiness.”46 There is
no mysterious ‘self’ to be found within us. Neither things no people have essences; “Buddhism
leaves no room for an essentialist conception.”47

Only some Bahá’í teachings converge with Madhyamika Buddhism on these issues. As
we have already seen, Bahá’í views about the phenomenal world converge with Madhyamika
beliefs about dependent origination. Both accept that the phenomenal world is in perpetual flux,
that “all else beside God as transient,”48 that things come into existence and exist by virtue of
universal influence, and that the appearance of any being requires the correct combination of
inter-actions”

> Finally, the perfection of each individual being--is due to the composition of the
> elements, to their measure, to their balance, to the mode of their combination, and to
> mutual influence. When all these are gathered together, then man exists.49

Consequently, the Bahá’í Writings can accept that all things in the phenomenal are “empty”
insofar as their dependence on other things as well as God is concerned. Moreover, the
emptiness forms the foundation for an ethical outlook based on detachment from the
phenomenal world which because of its endless changing nature, inevitably disappoints.

\[49\] `Abdu'l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, p. 178; emphasis added.

The question arises as to how far the concept of emptiness goes in the Bahá’í teachings.

Does it, for example, apply to the concept of ‘self’? The answer to this question is that in one
aspect it does, and in another it does not. This is because there are two concepts of self or ego at
work in the Bahá’í Writings. As `Abdu'l-Bahá says,

> In man there are two natures; his spiritual or higher nature and his material or lower
> nature. In one he approaches God, in the other he lives for the world alone. Signs of both
> these natures are to be found in men. In his material aspect he expresses untruth, cruelty
> and injustice; all these are the outcome of his lower nature50

The ‘lower ego’ or ‘self’ is based on our animal nature, i.e. it is purely physical; it is a product
of evolution with all the necessary instincts, drives and psychological tendencies. Moreover, to
some extent it is a product of our time, place and historical circumstances because it is also
through these we may be attached to the phenomenal world. `Abdu'l-Bahá writes, “This lower
nature in man is symbolized as Satan -- the evil ego within us, not an evil personality outside.”51
However, in addition, we have a “spiritual or higher nature”52 of which `Abdu'l-Bahá says, “A
man may converse with the ego within him saying: "May I do this? Would it be advisable for
me to do this work?" Such as this is conversation with the higher self.’ ”53 From this distinction
it follows that that “[o]ur greatest efforts must be directed towards detachment from the things
of the world; we must strive to become more spiritual, more luminous.”54 In other words, we
must overcome the lower ego and eliminate its domination in our lives.

The Bahá’í emphasis on overcoming our lower animal nature and our attachments to the
phenomenal world converges with the Buddhist teachings about the unreality of the ‘ego’ or
‘self.’ On the basis of the Bahá’í descriptions of our lower nature, self, or ego, we may conclude
that it is ultimately not real, a product of the inter-active processes of the phenomenal world at
both the material and socio-historical level, i.e. a product of what Buddhists call dependent
origination. As Bahá’ís, we are to detach ourselves from this lower nature and the world, to let
it go, to recognize it for the ephemerality it is. Bahá'u'lláh says, His

> sole purpose in revealing to thee these words is to sanctify thee from the transitory
> things of the earth, and aid thee to enter the realm of everlasting glory, that thou mayest,
> by the leave of God, be of them that abide and rule therein....55

This leads to the conclusion that there is no obstacle to accepting the Buddhist doctrine of ‘no-
self’ insofar as the lower self and its attachments to the phenomenal are concerned; these are not
ultimately real and must be overcome, left behind or outgrown.

V Emptiness and the Tathagatagarbha Tradition

The difficult debate begins when we ask what, if anything, remains once we achieve
complete detachment from our lower nature or lower self. The Madhyamika, of course, deny
that anything remains: there simply is no self at all. It is an empty convention without more than
temporary existence in the process of dependent origination. Such is not the view of the wide-
spread Tathagatagarbha tradition which accepts the concept of an eternal and changeless
‘Buddha-Nature’ in all beings. Because the Buddha-Nature is eternal and changeless, it is not
subject to dependent origination and, therefore, is not empty in the Madhyamika sense of the
term. According to the Tathagatagarbha tradition, the Madhyamika have only taken account of
part of the Buddha’s revelations about the ‘self.’ More precisely, the Madhyamika schools
represent only the second turning of the Buddha’s wheel of revelation for which reason their
understanding is incomplete, whereas the Tathagatagarbha tradition is the third and final turning
of the wheel of revelation. In this final turning, ‘emptiness’ and related concepts receive their
final form.

The Tathagatagarbha or Buddha-Nature lies hidden in all sentient beings. According to
The Tathatagatagarbha Sutra

> The Buddha sees that all kinds of beings
> Universally possess the tathagatagarbha.
> It is covered by countless klesas, [defilements]
> Just like a tangle of smelly, wilted petals.
> So I, on behalf of all beings,
> Everywhere expound the true Dharma,
> In order to help them remove their klesas
> And quickly reach the Buddha way.
> I see with my Buddha eye
> That in the bodies of all beings
> There lies concealed the buddhagarbha,56

According to the Tathagatagarbha Sutra, “the tathagatagarbhas of all beings are eternal and
unchanging”57 which, as noted before, means they are unconditioned and exempt from
dependent origination and, therefore, are not empty in the Madhyamika sense. In The Srimala
Devi Sutra, one of the central Tathagatagarbha sutras, we read:

> But, Lord, the Tathagatagarbha is not born, does not die, does not pass away to become
> reborn. The Tathagatagarbha excludes the realm with the characteristic of the

\[57\] The Tathagatagarbha Sutra, trans. by William H Grosnick.

> constructed. The Tathagatagarbha is permanent, steadfast, eternal. Therefore the
> Tathagatagarbha is the support, the holder, the base of constructed58

Of special significance here is the distinction between the eternal realm of the Tathagatagarbha
and “the realm with the characteristic of the constructed” which refers to what the Madhyamika
call the conventional world which we ‘construct’ by identifying things and giving them discrete
names. This is the realm of phenomenal change. Such passages emphasize that unlike the
Madhyamika, Tathagatagarbha Buddhism recognizes the real, independent existence, of
something eternal, i.e. something that is an exception to the process of dependent origination,
and, consequently, something not empty.

> Lord, the Tathagatagarbha has ultimate existence without beginning or end, has an
> unborn and undying nature, and experiences suffering; hence it is worthy of the
> Tathagatagarbha to have aversion towards suffering as well as longing, eagerness, and
> aspiration towards Nirvana.59

The last statement already suggests that it is the Tathagatagarbha within us that seeks to escape
the suffering of the phenomenal world of dependent origination and aspires towards the
Nirvana.
This is the noble desire that dwells deep within all of us. In the The Srimala Devi Sutra, the
Buddha says,

> ‘Good sons, do not consider yourselves inferior or base. You all personally possess the
> Buddha nature.’ If you exert yourselves and destroy your past evils, then you will
> receive the title of bodhisattvas or world-honored ones, and convert and save
> countless sentient beings. 60

In passing, let us note that this statement has its counterpart in the Bahá’í Writings in which
Bahá'u'lláh says, “O SON OF SPIRIT! Noble have I created thee, yet thou hast abased thyself.
Rise then unto that for which thou wast created.”61 Being a bodhisattva or “world-honored one”
is a noble and honored status and so, the Buddha’s and Bahá'u'lláh’s statements express the
same spirit and meaning. Moreover, if we possess the Tathagatagarbha, then obviously,
contrary to Madhyamika doctrine, there is something enduring within us not subject to
dependent origination. This is the true self.

> 'Self' means 'tathagatagarbha.' Every being has the Buddha Nature. This is self. Such a
> self is, since the very beginning, under cover of innumerable illusions [defilements] . . . I

> now let persons see the Buddha Nature that they possess, which is overspread by
> illusion [defilements] . . . 62

As evident here, the Tathagatagarbha tradition differs significantly from the Madhyamika,
regarding the existence of an absolute, eternal exception to dependent origination and regarding
the existence of a ‘self.’ Self is not necessarily empty as taught by the Madhyamika since this
transcendent self is exempt from dependent origination. The self that is, indeed, empty, is the
‘ego’ or personality that is shaped by the processes of dependent origination but this must not
be confused with – as the Madhyamika have done – with the Buddha-Nature within us.
According to the Buddha, we do not seem to have a self because the Buddha-Nature or
Tathagatagarbha is always covered with defilements so that we do not know what our real self
is, and, therefore, do not possess it.63 In other words, according to the Tathagatagarbha tradition,
the Madhyamika possessed an earlier understanding of the Buddha’s teachings. The
Madhyamika teachings are not wrong but incomplete. Their doctrine that self is empty, is not
the full teaching of the Buddha and must be re-thought in light of the revelations of the various
Tathagatagarbha sutras.

There is a remarkable agreement between the Tathagatagarbha tradition and the Bahá’í
Writings on the subject of a transcendent aspect within all individual beings. Bahá'u'lláh writes,
“No thing have I perceived, except that I perceived God within it, God before it, or God after
it.”64 Both agree that all things are characterized by something that is not subject to dependent
origination and, therefore, is not empty in the Madhyamika sense, i.e. is not conventional, and
by contrast, has positive inherent qualities and existence. Our human task is to uncover and
actualize that aspect within ourselves in order to overcome the conventional and worldly ego.
As we shall see, in the Bahá’í system and the Tathagatagarbha tradition, emptiness means
cleansing ourselves of defilements.

In general terms, we may say that the Buddha-Nature within us corresponds, in Bahá’í
terms, to our spiritual nature.

> This spiritual nature, which came into existence through the bounty of the Divine
> Reality, is the union of all perfections and appears through the breath of the Holy Spirit.
> It is the divine perfections; it is light, spirituality, guidance, exaltation, high aspiration,
> justice, love, grace, kindness to all, philanthropy, the essence of life. It is the reflection
> of the splendor of the Sun of Reality.65

\[65\] `Abdu'l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, p. 118; emphasis added.

Our spiritual nature is a reflective presence of the divine in us, and, as expected, includes
positive attributes that are “divine perfections,’ i.e. they are not mere conventions as required by
Madhyamika thinking. These are real virtues latent within us and they are the ‘real’ self
inasmuch as it is more God-like and because it represents enduring values and attributes for
which we are to strive. Our task is to follow the spiritual discipline laid down by Bahá'u'lláh and
`Abdu'l-Bahá in order to overcome and transform the qualities of our lower nature and its ego
and, thereby, to submerge or lose them in our higher spiritual nature. That way our lower
qualities will no longer conceal and defile the spiritual nature within us. That way our spiritual
nature will become visible in our lives. As we shall see in more detail below, this corresponds
to the Tathagatagarbha concept of emptiness which requires making our higher nature – or
Buddha-Nature – “empty of what is changing, afflicted and worldly”66 to reveal the beauties of
the Buddha-Nature.

The concept of the presence of the omnipresent Buddha-Nature is also evident in the
teaching that the “names of God” are necessarily inherent in all things:

> Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is a direct evidence of the
> revelation within it of the attributes and names of God, inasmuch as within every atom
> are enshrined the signs that bear eloquent testimony to the revelation of that Most Great
> Light. Methinks, but for the potency of that revelation, no being could ever exist. How
> resplendent the luminaries of knowledge that shine in an atom, and how vast the oceans
> of wisdom that surge within a drop! . . . For in him [man] are potentially revealed all the
> attributes and names of God to a degree that no other created being hath excelled or
> surpassed.67

The names or attributes of God are eternal and, therefore, uncreated and not in any way
susceptible to dependent origination because God Himself is ‘eternal’ and absolutely
independent from anything except Himself. Just as the Buddha-Nature within all sentient beings
is eternal and not empty, so the names of God in all things are not empty.

There is yet another way in which the Tathagatagarbha doctrine converges with the
Bahá’í Writings. The Writings state,

> Souls are like unto mirrors, and the bounty of God is like unto the sun. When the mirrors
> pass beyond (the condition of) all coloring and attain purity and polish, and are
> confronted with the sun, they will reflect in full perfection its light and glory. In this
> condition one should not consider the mirror, but the power of the light of the sun,
> which hath penetrated the mirror, making it a reflector of the heavenly glory.68

Here, too, we observe how the presence of the divine or Absolute appears in the soul, which in
its purest state, is free of “coloring” or extraneous elements or defilements and simply reflects

\[66\] Tony Page, An Appreciation of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, Section 4.

\[67\] Bahá'u'lláh, Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh, XC, p. 177.

\[68\] `Abdu'l-Bahá, Tablets of `Abdu'l-Bahá, Vol. 1, p. 19

the perfection of the sun. The purity of the soul is, in fact, its original state: “Know thou that
every soul is fashioned after the nature of God, each being pure and holy at his birth.”69
However, when the soul is cleansed of defilements, the individuality of the mirror, or ego, is
lost in the brightness of the sun’s appearance just as the ordinary self is lost in the awareness of
the tathagatagarbha. For this reason, `Abdu'l-Bahá tells us,

The most important thing is to polish the mirrors of hearts in order that they may
become

> illumined and receptive of the divine light. One heart may possess the capacity of the
> polished mirror; another be covered and obscured by the dust and dross of this world. [
> [defilements] Although the same Sun is shining upon both, in the mirror which is
> polished, pure and sanctified you may behold the Sun in all its fullness, glory and power
> revealing its majesty and effulgence, but in the mirror which is rusted and obscured
> there is no capacity for reflection70

The deficient, defiled mirror, of course, is the one still facing or attached to the world instead of
to the light of the sun, or, to view it from a Buddhist perspective, the ego is still visible and thus
the divine, the Tathagatagarbha is obscured – not itself actually marred – by various
defilements. In this view, emptiness is not so much something we understand intellectually as
something we achieve by cleansing the “dross’ from the mirror of the soul.

It is evident that the definition of ‘emptiness’ used in the Tathagatagarbha tradition is
dramatically different from that used by the Madhyamikas who maintain nothing whatsoever
has inherent existence: emptiness, the Buddha,71 the teachings and the distinction between
samsara, and nirvana are empty as are all intellectual and conceptualized understandings of
them. According to Paul Williams, there is an

> opposition between the Madhyamaka view of emptiness as an absence of inherent
> existence in the object under investigation and the tathagatagarbha perspective on
> emptiness . . . which sees emptiness as the radiant, pure mind empty of its conceptual
> accretions.72

The “pure mind,” the Tathagatagarbha itself is found to be empty of all intellectual imputations,
i.e. empty of all convention. It is “empty of all defilements, including the defilements of
conceptuality.”73 As Tony Page writes,

> So-called "Emptiness", which is an absolutely key concept of Mahayana Buddhism,
> reveals itself here to be only empty of what is changing, afflicted and worldly - not of

By removing these various defilements, we find our Buddha-Nature, our Tathagatagarbha,
which is “never constructed,” i.e. is not a conventional imputation and which is connected to the
Buddha. Emptiness is precisely this condition of lacking the defilements and imputations that
cover the true Buddha-Nature within. Just as noteworthy is the fact that the Buddha-Nature has
eternal, i.e. changeless positive attributes such as bliss and joy which are not mere conventions
we have imputed to it. (In this sense, of course, the Tathagatagarbha tradition converges with
Platonism and its eternal Ideas.)

The Bahá’í Writings present the same idea. When the mirror of the soul (or heart) is
cleansed of all defilements, the radiance of the Sun becomes visible in its splendor and all our
awareness of the lower ego is lost, at least for a time as we reflect “the full glory of the Sun of
Truth.”75 This reflection is not, of course, an ontological unity between the mirror and the Sun,
but rather an analogical unity in which the sun in the mirror is the analogue of the divine Sun,
i.e. both different and similar. To be cleansed of defilements, we must seek to become detached
“from all else save God”76 and to practice self-sacrifice and the “evanescence”77 and to “to
reflect
the love of the Highest on all men.”78 In doing so, we find what remains in our souls and hearts
is our attachment to or love for God which is precisely what makes us spiritually noble beings.
It is also that aspect of us which is more real than the ego or self. We might call this ‘the
practice of emptiness.’

It is evident that in the Tathagatagarbha tradition and the Bahá’í Writings agree that
‘emptiness’ is the lack of defilements. The Buddha-Nature is empty not in itself – for it has
inherent existence and positive qualities – but because it is clean of all emotional, intellectual
and behavioral imperfections. Thus, emptiness does not mean a lack of inherent existence as it
does in the Madhyamika schools but rather it means a lack of defilement. “In this sense the
Buddha essence is indeed empty – it is empty of adventitious defilements which simply do not
exist at all from the point of view of its own innate purity.”79 In Tibet, the Jo nang pa school
knows this as the “other-empty” view in contrast to Ge lug pas who espouse the “self-empty”
view of the Madhyamikas.80 (The Dalai Lama is a Ge lug pa.)

In the Bahá’í context, the Manifestation in “the condition of divine appearance and
heavenly splendor”81 may also be described as ‘empty’ in the Tathagatagarbha sense:

> The third station is that of the divine appearance and heavenly splendor: it is the Word
> of God, the Eternal Bounty, the Holy Spirit. It has neither beginning nor end, for these
> things are related to the world of contingencies and not to the divine world. For God the
> end is the same thing as the beginning82

If the Manifestation in the third station is free of time because time is related to the contingent
world, then, by implication, He is also free of the other defilements associated with the
contingent world. Consequently, in the Tathagatagarbha sense, the Manifestation may be
described as ‘empty.’ The same is true of God Who is also empty in the Tathagatagarbha sense
of the term.

However, we should not conflate the Bahá’í doctrine of the unknowability of God with
any form of Buddhist emptiness teaching. The Bahá’í doctrine of the unknowability of God is a
teaching about human capacity, or incapacity, in light of the ontological difference between
God and humankind. In contrast, Buddhist emptiness teaching concerns either the Buddha-
Nature’s lack of defilement or the mere conventionality of any such supposed entity. From a
Bahá’í viewpoint, saying that God lacks defilements is superfluous, and saying that the
existence of God is a mere convention is contrary to the Writings since God does not depend on
us.

Wee now arrive at the thorny issue of the ‘self’ in the Tathagatagarbha tradition and the
Bahá’í Writings. In the Madhyamika tradition, the concept of ‘self’ is empty, i.e. a convention
imputed by us on the process of dependent origination. However, in the Tathagatagarbha
tradition, matters are not so straight-forward. On one hand, the Tathagatagarbha tradition makes
it clear that the Buddha-Nature within us should not be understood as a personality, ego or self.

\[83\] Yet, despite repeated emphasis on this point, it has often been said the Tathagatagarbha
schools have – perhaps inadvertently – re-introduced the concept of self into Buddhism.
Donald Lopez Jr. states that “another controversy [about the Tathagatagarbha doctrine] derives
from the fact that the tathagatagarbha is often described in such a way that it sounds like a
self.”84 It is not difficult to see why as shown by the following quotation from the Buddha:

O Kasyapa!

> Know well of the three refuges. The nature
> Of the three refuges is that of self. If one knows
> Clearly that the nature of self has the Buddha Nature,
> Such a one well enters the undisclosed house. 85

\[85\] The Buddha, Mahayana Parinirvana Sutra, trans. by Kosho Yamamoto, Ch. 12.

Inevitably, such statements raise questions. How can “the nature of the self” have the Buddha-
Nature without that “nature of the self” also having something essential or ‘eternal’ about it,
something exempt from dependent origination, and, therefore, not empty? This suggestion
seems reinforced by statements like “The nature of self is none but the undisclosed storehouse
of the Tathagata.”86 Since the Tathagata (The Buddha) is exempt from dependent origination,
the same appears to be true of the self.

Moreover, from a strictly philosophical point of view, one might also reason as follows.

If the Buddha-Nature is present in all sentient beings, then it is present individually in all
beings. In other words, every being is a particularized appearance of the Buddha-Nature and
insofar as it is particular, it is difficult to avoid suggestions of individuality or self. Bare
particularity is the minimal logical requirement for the existence of a self and each sentient
being seems to meet that minimal requirement. The Buddha-Nature that appears in all things
may be the same, but this ‘sameness’ makes individual appearances in all particular things.
While this particularity is not a ‘self’ in the sense of a fully-developed ego or personality, it is,
at least, something possessing the minimum logical foundation for individuality. This seems to
be recognized by David Kalupahana who says the Tathagatagarbha view (among others) brings
us “dangerously close to the theory of self . . . advocated by the heretics.”87 Rupert Gethin
writes that the issue is difficult to resolve because “its [the self’s] metaphysical and ontological
status is, however, open to interpretation in terms of the different Mahayana philosophical
schools.88

While we are unable to resolve these tensions and ambiguities among Buddhist
traditions, we are able to conclude the Tathagatagarbha tradition and the Bahá’í Writings seem
to converge in regards to the subject of self. There is something transcendent in us – be it called
the Buddha-Nature or spiritual nature or names of God – that must be revealed by us. The
definition of the self as the Tathagatagarbha also means that a different view of emptiness is at
work – emptiness as the removal of defilements of the Buddha-Nature. In the Jo nang pa this is
called being ‘other-empty.’ The Bahá’í Writings do not share this language but they do share a
similar view of emptiness.

VI Emptiness in the Yogacara Tradition

The Yogacara tradition is generally regarded as being a form of philosophic idealism in

Self and all apparently external objects are empty insofar as they have no inherent or
independent existence and no enduring essence. Moreover, all objects – whether they appear to
exist outside us or whether they are thoughts, feelings and perceptions, are, in Vasubandhu’s
phrase “ideation only.”90 Even in regards to apparently external objects, all we can know are
our own experiences and nothing more. If we kick a rock, as Dr. Johnson famously did to refute
the idealist Bishop Berkeley, we still only have our sensory impression – an ‘idea’ – of the rock
we just kicked. We experience ‘hardness’ or ‘resistance’ but those are still our experiences. This
applies to the self as well. If we examine our inward life, all we find is a stream of changing
perceptions and impressions, but we do not find a ‘self’ in that stream. The seemingly external
world arises because “[d]ue to our beginningless ignorance we construct these perceptions into
enduring subjects and objects.”91 In other words, as in the Madhyamika philosophy, all objects
of perception and thought exist ‘conventionally’ and have no inherent existence or essence. In
that sense they are ‘empty.’ However, the Yogacara position goes beyond the Madhyamika
view which only tells us what things are ultimately not and says nothing about what they are
and which does not explain how things come to appear in the way they do.92 From this
perspective, Madhyamika views are negative whereas the Yogacara tradition is positive insofar
as it provides a positive explanation for the nature of existence and human perception.

While the Yogacarins agree that things that appear to us as the world or self are
conventional and empty, it also asserts that consciousness itself is the real substratum that
underlies all appearances. It alone has inherent existence and essence. Hence the Yogacara
tradition is sometimes called the “mind-only” school, since consciousness or mind – though not
the individual mind – is recognized as being ultimately real. “Highest knowledge yields the
realization that reality is pure and undiscriminated consciousness.” 93 The apparently separate
existence of all other things – including the ‘self’ – is explained as the result of the “store-
consciousness.” The store-house consciousness

> consciousness’ it is the result of the being’s past karma . . . as such the store
> consciousness is also the condition for the perpetuation of these defilements in present
> and future active consciousness.94

The ultimate reality or universal consciousness contains the “seeds” or potential future
consequences or dispositions of all past actions and defilements by all entities. These seeds are
a metaphor for karma. As the seeds ‘mature,’ or the potentials actualize through dependent
origination, certain consequences arise and these lead to the appearance of self and world,
subject and object, perceiver and perceived, experiencer and experienced. In the words of the
Dalai Lama, the Yogacarins “argue that the perception of the external world arises as the result

of the imprints [seeds] that exist within the consciousness.”95 However, the ultimate truth is that
none of these dualities are true – they are empty – and that all things are one in the universal
consciousness. Even to say they are ‘one’ may already go too far inasmuch as this universal
consciousness exists beyond all human categorizations.

For Yogacarins, emptiness refers to lack of any distinction between subject and object,
between perceiver and perceived, and between the ‘experiencer’ and the experience. They are
all one and same – ‘parts’ of the universal consciousness on which we impose arbitrary
constructions as a result of karmic seeds. None of these ‘objects’ have inherent existence or
essence. This is exactly the emptiness revealed by enlightenment. Emptiness, therefore, may be
characterized as the recognition that no ontological differences are real and that ontologically
speaking, we are all one.

The relationship between the Bahá’í Writings and the Yogacara concept of emptiness
has
two aspects, one ontological and the other spiritual or moral. From a strictly ontological point of
view, it is possible to argue that the Bahá’í Writings and Yogacara doctrine converge insofar as
they both see all created things as ontologically equal. Unlike the universal consciousness
which has the ontological marks of traditional concepts of divinity, i.e. absolute independence,
eternity and exemption from change, every self, every subject and object is absolutely
dependent – and thus, as the Writings indicate – relatively unreal or ‘conventional.’ Things also
lack inherent existence and are inextricably subject to change. In a word, they are empty. In this
sense a chair, a human being and a mountain are ontologically identical. From the ultimate
ontological perspective of the universal consciousness, the differences we perceive are
conventional ‘add-ons’ to our common ontological nature, and, therefore, not ultimate.
Recognizing our ontological emptiness vis-à-vis the universal consciousness or God is the
necessary first step to attaining freedom from the conventional delusions that imprison us.

The Bahá’í Writings agree with much of this analysis. For example, recognizing that
much of what we purport to know is conventional in nature, i.e. human constructions based on
time, place, circumstance and level of cultural development is a key element in the Bahá’í
teachings. In Yogacara terminology, these individually or culturally determined constructs are
empty, i.e. they are the delusions caused by individual and cultural factors or ‘seeds’ that we
impose on them. (From the ultimate perspective of universal consciousness, we cannot even say
we ‘impose’ these attributes, since the subject/object division is not real.) Our task is to
overcome our enslavement to these imitative delusions to attain true freedom, hence the Bahá’í
emphasis on the independent investigation of truth.

> of nature, and in penetrating the subtleties of pure truth! Woe to those who are contented

> with ignorance, whose hearts are gladdened by thoughtless imitation, who have fallen
> into the lowest depths of ignorance and foolishness, and who have wasted their lives!96

Because the Bahá’í Writings mainly applies the task of recognizing and overcoming
conventions in knowledge to religion and social issues, we should not be blinded to the fact that
it applies equally to all other kinds of knowledge – including self-knowledge. Many of our
difficulties originate in our responses not to things as they are but to our conventional or
imitational understanding of them. The only way to overcome this problem is to free ourselves
from entanglement in our conventions and to recognize the emptiness of things. Here, too, the
Bahá’í Writings and Yogacara philosophy converge.

Of course, there remains the question of whether or not the subject/object dichotomy can
also be overcome at least from an ontological perspective. As we recall, in the Yogacara view
all differences between subject/object and indeed, between all things are known to be empty
vis-à-vis the “pure and undiscriminated consciousness.” 97 From the ultimate perspective, the
differences between them are empty. Is there any convergence with Bahá’í teachings on this
matter? Perhaps. One could argue that all created things are simply appearances of the creative
power of God’s Will. As `Abdu'l-Bahá says, “Throughout the universe the divine power is
effulgent in endless images and pictures.”98 Given this point of view, it seems to follow that all
things and all distinctions between things are not ultimate insofar as they are dependent on the
“divine power.” To this extent, at least, the Bahá’í Writings converge with the Yogacara view.
However, while the Bahá’í Writings suggest that at least some distinctions and attributes are
imposed on things, and, thereby, empty, they do not believe that all distinctions are necessary
empty. For example, the rational soul distinguishes humans from animals in a definitive, non-
empty way.99 Only at the most fundamental ontological level is this distinction vitiated.

The Bahá’í Writings diverge from Yogacara teaching regarding the ontological
difference between created things and God – or the universal consciousness.100 This distinction
is not empty, not conventional and not bridgeable. In the Yogacara teaching, when the self
recognizes the emptiness of all distinctions between itself and the universal consciousness, it
becomes indistinguishable from the universal consciousness, i.e. it overcomes the dualism of
subject and object, and discovers emptiness. This discovery is “nonconceptual knowledge”101
empty of both the experiencing subject and its object which are no longer distinguished.
Thereby, a human “becomes one with the Ultimate Reality.”102 This view may be interpreted
ontologically or epistemologically. 103

If we adopt an ontological interpretation of this Yogacara teaching, there is an outright
conflict with the Bahá’í Writings. The Writings are most emphatic that we, as contingent
beings, are not God and can never hope to be, ontologically ‘one with Him’ i.e. can never “join
partners with God.”104 Mystics may feel as if they have achieved such unity, but in reality they
have not and claims to the contrary are mistaken interpretations of their experience. There is an
unbridgeable difference between absolute independence and absolute dependence that the latter
can never cross. The difference between God and humankind is not empty. In a similar vein, the
Writings are clear that except for our basic ontological attributes such as dependence and
mutability, some differences between kinds of beings are not empty or conventional, and,
therefore, real.

If we adopt an epistemological interpretation of the Yogacara position, there are fewer
complexities vis-à-vis the Bahá’í Writings. For example, we may under certain circumstances
feel ourselves so much in harmony with the divine will, that all sense of being a self with a
separate will is extinguished. The distinction between our will and God’s will has been vitiated
and is, therefore, empty. This condition is traditionally described by Christians as ‘kenosis.’
However, this ‘self-emptying’ is a psycho-spiritual condition and is not an ontological state. We
are who we are and God is Who He is.105

The Bahá’í and Yogacara teachings also converge when we apply them to morals.

Morally speaking, one of our tasks is precisely to recognize the emptiness of any imputed
differences between ourselves and others. Indeed, we must realize that these differences insofar
as they separate us and generate animosity, are empty, i.e. are, to use Yogacara terminology,
the products of the seeds of our own ‘karma’ or personal history and, therefore, not real in
comparison with our common spiritual nature.

> For now have the rays of reality from the Sun of the world of existence, united in
> adoration all the worshippers of this light; and these rays have, through infinite grace,
> gathered all peoples together within this wide-spreading shelter; therefore must all souls
> become as one soul, and all hearts as one heart. Let all be set free from the multiple
> identities that were born of passion and desire, and in the oneness of their love for God
> find a new way of life.106

The identities “born of passion and desire” are precisely those identities which, in the Yogacara
metaphor, ‘sprout’ from the karmic seeds. In the Yogacara view, these seeds originate in past
lives, whereas in the Bahá’í view they may be the consequences of earlier good and bad actions.
In either case, we are to recognize that the differences between ourselves and others, are empty,
i.e. non-essential vis-à-vis our common spiritual nature and goals. What is most real about us is
our spiritual nature. As `Abdu'l-Bahá says, “[m]an is, in reality, a spiritual being, and only when
he lives in the spirit is he truly happy.”107 This implies that our moral goal is to achieve

emptiness or non-duality between our empirical, ‘every-day’ self and our spiritual self, i.e. to
overcome any difference between the two. Only thus can we become “as one soul.”108

Moreover, the Bahá’í Writings seek to apply this principle not only to individuals but
also socially, to races, nationalities and social classes: “The divine Manifestations since the day
of Adam have striven to unite humanity so that all may be accounted as one soul.”109 It is not
enough that individuals realize their emptiness vis-à-vis the universal consciousness or God –
rather, we must recognize that, from spiritually speaking, racial and even cultural differences
are empty conventions. This is not to say these differences are not valuable, but we must never
forget that they are not ultimate, i.e. empty and allow them to stand in the way of progress to a
more peaceful and productive world. In this way the Bahá’í Faith tries to put the concept of
emptiness into practice.

VII Emptiness in the Theravada Tradition

In the Theravada tradition which predominates in Southeast Asian nations such as Sri
Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos, the concept of emptiness plays a very
different role than it does in the various Mahayana schools. Edward Conze, one of the greatest
Buddhologists, informs us that the Theravada thinkers “knew the term empty, but used it very
sparingly. In the Pali Canon it occurs only in a few places.”110 Not only are there fewer
references to emptiness in the Theravada tradition than in the Mahayana, but the Theravada has
emphasis is on practices that lead to the experience of ‘liberation’ or ‘nibbana’ (‘nirvana’ in
Sanskrit), also known as ‘awakening.’ Liberation refers to the condition in which ignorance and
the resulting desire, suffering and kamma (‘karma’ in Sanskrit) are left behind or transcended.
This brings with it serenity and bliss. Liberation must be personally experienced to be
understood. Unlike the Mahayana tradition which is rich in metaphysical reflections on
emptiness as a lack of inherent existence, the Theravada tradition is more pragmatic than
speculative in its approach to emptiness. It is concerned with how the practice of emptiness can
help us overcome the unsatisfactoriness or suffering of life and to attain nibbana, i.e. awakening
or liberation.

> necessarily involve integrity — it's an attempt to describe the ultimate truth of the nature

> mastery.112

Two suttas (the Pali term for ‘sutras’ or Buddha word) stand out in this regard, The
Greater Discourse on Emptiness and The Lesser Discourse on Emptiness. According to
Thanissaro Bhikkhu, the Pali Canon has three perspectives on emptiness. The first concerns
acquiring and maintaining the mental state of emptiness, i.e. learning how to empty the mind of
all distractions and keep it empty. Step by step the Buddha explains how to empty the mind of
the perception of social distractions, of natural distractions and eventually the distractions of
space, nothingness and consciousness and all the humanly-constructed concepts of “perception
and non-perception.”113 This brings the seeker to “his entry into emptiness, accords with
actuality, is undistorted in meaning, pure — superior [and] unsurpassed.”114 Here we observe
emptiness as goal of meditation; ‘emptiness’ is freedom from disturbing intrusions. This first
perspective on emptiness is the focal point of this discourse.

The second perspective on emptiness concerns the question, ‘What does it mean to say
the world is empty?’ The answer is that the world is empty insofar as nothing has any ‘self’

> “Insofar as it [the world] is empty of a self or of anything pertaining to a self: Thus it is
> said, Ananda, that the world is empty. And what is empty of a self or of anything
> pertaining to a self? The eye is empty of a self or of anything pertaining to a self.
> Forms... Eye-consciousness... Eye-contact is empty of a self or of anything pertaining to
> a self.”115

The intellect, ideas, consciousness are also empty of self and, therefore, any attributes we
impute to objects of consciousness, i.e. the world, are empty of self as well. We create this
illusion of self in our desire to be happy, and, consequently seek to control the world around us,
engaging in “my-making” and “I-making”116 which inevitably incites struggles with others
trying to do the same. When we perceive without implicitly or unconsciously tainting our
perceptions with notions of self, i.e. engage in self-centered perception, they cease to cause us
dissatisfaction and suffering. As `Abdu'l-Bahá, we are to become “weary of self”117

“Emptiness in its third meaning, as a type of awareness-release”118 which is an
application of the second meaning of emptiness in concrete situations. For example, in an empty
house, we may consider how every room in the house is empty of self, which, according to the
Theravada tradition is different from the first kind of emptiness as we eliminate distractions.
The finer details of this kind of emptiness need not detain us here, except to say that this kind of
emptiness may “lead to Awakening”119 which is the end of ignorance, desiring, suffering and
karma, and the attainment of supreme, unconditioned tranquility.

The Theravada teachings and the Bahá’í Writings are convergent about several issues in
regards to emptiness. The first of these concerns the practical application of emptiness as
freedom from intrusive distractions. According to the Writings, “No thing have I perceived,
except that I perceived God within it, God before it, or God after it.”120 As a guide to practicing
emptiness vis-à-vis distractions, this statement can be the basis of training ourselves not to see
anything but the signs of God in all things much as the aspiring Theravadin excludes a variety
of intrusive perceptions and ideas. In other words, Bahá’ís will practice setting aside or
emptying their vision of the ‘defilements,’ i.e. the short-coming of things and/or people, and
strive to see only the presence of the divine names in them.

The chief of these distractions is the notion of ‘self’ – which, as in the Buddhist
scriptures, must be transcended for any spiritual progress to occur. This message is conveyed in
`Abdu'l-Bahá’s story of Christ and the dead dog. Whereas the disciples were repelled by the
gross sights and smells, Christ, so to speak, emptied His perception of these negative
distractions and saw only the positive.121 We might also say that the disciples were imprisoned
by their self-centered perception of the decaying dog – they focussed exclusively on how the
dog affected them personally, i.e. how it affected the self. Christ’s response, on the other hand,
demonstrated that he had emptied His perception of self and was awakened to the presence of
the divine. He was liberated from self and self-centered perception. 122 This emphasis on over-
coming self-centered perception and living is, of course, the main point of the second meaning
o emptiness in the Theravada teachings. The Writings agree that what Thanissaro Bhikkhu calls
“I-making” and “my-making”123 are the source of conflicts as we perceive the world in terms of
‘I’ and ‘mine,’ i.e. self-centered perception. Consequently, this perceptual habit must be
overcome.

Finally, Bahá'u'lláh commands us to become “one soul,”124 a command which requires
us to empty our minds of all the intrusive distractions of negative differences. As we can see, a
similar emptying process is at work as distractions from our goal are repelled. On this score, the

Bahá’í Writings and the Theravada teachings converge. However, the Writings practice
emptying more in an ethical context than the Theravada teachings which also concern
themselves with eliminating ‘metaphysical’ distractions such as time, space and the humanly-
constructed concepts of “perception and non-perception.”125 The difference between the Bahá’í
and Theravada teaching is largely a matter of emphasis.

Both the Theravada tradition and the Bahá’í Writings share the idea that understanding
and practicing emptiness is necessary to awakening. Theravadins practice emptiness in order to
achieve liberation, nibbana or awakening to humankind’s true condition beyond ignorance,
desire, suffering and kamma (karma). On the other hand, Bahá’ís practice emptiness to awaken
to and experience the divine presence in all. From a Bahá’í perspective, this divine presence is
also the true human condition and the defilements we add to our lives are the self-driven
falsifications we need to overcome.

VIII Conclusion

Our survey of the Bahá’í Writings and the Buddhist concept of emptiness leads to three
major conclusions. First: there are a surprising number of agreements and convergences on this
subject especially regarding the ontological basis for the concept of emptiness. This does not
seem to change whether we discuss the Madhyamika, the Tathagatagarbha or the Yogacara
traditions. The key elements of dependent origination, ubiquitous change as the basis of
emptiness, as well as the role of conventions and the necessity for seeing through them remain
constant. In the Theravada tradition we observe similarities regarding the practice of emptiness.
Second: the Buddhist tradition with which the Bahá’í Writings have the clearest convergences
is the Tathagatagarbha tradition. The concept of the presence of the divine or Buddha-Nature in
all things and the definition of emptiness as the removal of defilements are clearly in harmony
with the Writings. Third: the study of the Buddhist concepts of emptiness and the Bahá’í
Writings requires more study to work out the details of these convergences which have only
been adumbrated here.
