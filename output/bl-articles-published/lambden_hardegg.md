> **Abstract:**  
>   
> Lawh-i-Hertik, as the Tablet addressed to Georg David Hardegg is usually called, contains in an open and straightforward manner the proclamation of Bahá'u'lláh as the Promised One and the return of the Father to earth. The recipient, one of the two leaders of the Wurttemberg Templers of Germany who arrived in Palestine, expecting the coming of the Lord, in the same year as Bahá'u'lláh, is addressed in a very friendly manner and is given advice by which the validity of Bahá'u'lláh's claims may be recognized. He also is warned not to make the same errors of the Pharisees, who neglected the validity of Christ's own claims.  
>   
> This paper will discuss the contents of the Tablet addressed to Hardegg and provide information both about the Templers and the recipient of the Tablet.
