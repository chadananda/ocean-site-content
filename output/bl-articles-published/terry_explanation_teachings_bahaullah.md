> **Abstract:**  
>   
> For the past three generations, many of the Western adherents of the Bahá’í Faith have first encountered the teachings of this religion in introductory pamphlets that listed twelve Bahá’í principles. This study examines the actual sources of the Bahá’í principles included on those lists — the Tablets and talks of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, which had been translated into English and published in "Star of the West,” _The Promulgation of Universal Peace, Paris Talks, 'Abdu'l-Bahá on Divine Philosophy_ and _'Abdu'l-Bahá in London._ In fourteen sources, 'Abdu'l-Bahá enumerated Bahá’í principles as He explained them, and in no case were there twelve principles in any list; the numbers vary from three to thirteen. In twelve other sources, 'Abdu'l-Bahá did not enumerate principles, but discussed the teachings in a particular order, and the order of these presentations has been compared with the numbered lists. All together, thirty-eight Bahá’í teachings were discussed in these Tablets and talks. Each one of these teachings will be described along with its ranking in relation to the other teachings, in number/order of presentation, and in frequency of reference. This is by no means a comprehensive or conclusive study of the subject, but it is shared here to suggest a revision of the now-traditional reduction of the Bahá’í teachings to lists of twelve, and also as an assistance to those who would wish to be fully informed of the principles that 'Abdu'l-Bahá regarded as best suited to attract the minds and hearts of the people of the West and, through them, humanity at large.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Explanation of the Teachings of Bahá’u’lláh:
Tablets and Talks Translated into English (1911–1920)

Peter Terry

bdu’l-Bahá (1844–1921), Sir ‘Abbás Effendi, eldest son of Bahá’u’lláh, gave a great number of pri-

‘A       vate and public talks during His sojourn in Europe and North America, in the years 1911–1913.

Subsequent to this journey, He authored many letters, usually denom in ated “Tablets” by Bahá’ís,
inasmuch as the spiritual nature of their subject matter and the divine inspiration believed to reside in
their contents set these letters apart from all others. Virtually all of these talks and letters were expo-
sitions of one or more of the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. Some of them contained surveys of several of
these teachings, and of these, a number included lists of such teachings, sometimes numbered and at
other times sequenced without numeration. In several of His talks ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated that Bahá’u’lláh’s
teachings were innumerable:

> This is a short summary of the Teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá in London, p. 30)
> The Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh are many. The precepts and teachings they contain are universal,
> covering every subject. He has revealed scientific explanations ranging throughout all the
> realms of human inquiry and investigation—astronomy, biology, medical science, etc. In the
> Kitáb-i-ˆqán He has given expositions of the meanings of the Gospel and other heavenly
> Books. He wrote lengthy Tablets upon civ il iz ation, sociology and government. Every subject
> is considered. (5/29/1912, talk in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Kinney, NYC; The Promulgation of
> Universal Peace, p. 155)
> These [eleven numbered] are a few of the principles proclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh. He has pro-
> vided the remedy for the ailments which now afflict the human world, solved the difficult
> problems of individual, social, national and universal welfare and laid the foundation of div in e
> reality upon which material and spiritual civ il iz ation are to be founded throughout the cen-
> turies before us. (9/5/1912, talk at St. James Methodist Church, Montreal; PUP, p. 318)
> The teac h in gs of Bahá’u’lláh are boundless, innumerable; time will not allow us to mention
> them in detail. (10/25/1912, talk at Hotel Sacramento, California; PUP, pp. 375–376)
> The teachings of Bahá’u’lláh embody many principles; I am giving you only a synopsis.
> (11/6/1912, talk at Universalist Church, Washington, D.C.; PUP, p. 394)
> The teac h in gs of Bahá’u’lláh are boundless and illimitable. You have asked me what new prin-
> ciples have been revealed by Him. I have mentioned a few only. There are many others, but
> time does not permit their mention tonight. (12/2/1912, talk in the home of Mr. and Mrs.
> Kinney, N YC; PUP, p. 457)
> These are some of the teac h in gs in the religion of Bahá’u’lláh—all of which would take a great
> deal of time to expound. (Star of the West, III:17, p. 9)
> Just as the rays of the phenomenal sun are infinite, likewise the rays of the Sun of Reality are
> infinite. The above summary only contains a few of its rays. (Star of the West, XI:1, p. 11)
This study will not seek to give an accounting of all of the teac h in gs of Bahá’u’lláh; nor will it even
seek to identify all of the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh to be found in the talks and letters of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
Such projects would require volumes to explore in befitting detail. The aim of this study is to exam in e
the enumerated lists and sequences of Bahá’í teachings found in the talks and letters of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

which were translated into English and published during His lifetime. The texts of these sources are iden-
tified in the first appendix to this paper, in chronological order of their composition (whenever it was
possible to ascertain the date of their provenance). It will then compare these numbered lists and
sequences with the teachings which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá indicated were new and distinctive to the Revelation
and Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh.

The original words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in these talks and letters, were Persian and Arabic, not English.

They have been translated into English by a number of individuals, including Aminu’ ll ah Farid, Ahmad
Sohrab, Azizu’llah Bahadur, Zia Bagdadi, Shoghi Effendi, and perhaps others who are not identified by
n am e. Only those for which the Persian original texts have been found, and which were approved for pub-
lication by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself, can be considered as authoritative statements of Bahá’í doctrine. This
study will not examine each of these accounts in order to determine its status in the Bahá’í canon, or to
compare the contents of non-canonical with canonical accounts.

Rather, we will seek to become better acquainted with the substance of what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá seems to
have regarded as among the most important teachings of Bahá’u’lláh, not in the Persian language sources,
but, rather, as they were encountered by North Americans and other readers of English during ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s lifetime.

All together thirty-seven sources were consulted. Thirteen were for enumerated teac h in gs and the
remaining twenty-four represented sequenced teac h in gs. The sources of these principles are cited here, in
brackets [...]. Please consult Appendix One for a full description of these sources. The listing of princi-
ples (including both the numbered and the sequenced teac h in gs) ranged from one [2, 29] to seventeen [9],
but also including two [20], three [16, 18, 32], four [11,19,33], five [21, 28], six [30], seven [22, 25], eight
[8, 14], nine [4, 5, 17, 26, 31], ten [10, 24,3 4], eleven [13, 15, 23, 27, 37], twelve [1, 6], thirteen [6, 35],
fourteen [7], and fifteen [3,12]. In much Bahá’í introductory literature in English we find a fairly stan-
dard list of ten or twelve Bahá’í principles. We might note that only two of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s talks or letters
features a list of twelve teachings, and that in neither case are they numbered. In the thirty-seven sources
studied we find forty-five separate Bahá’í teac h in gs. Only one of these teachings is found in virtually
every one of those sources (32 out of 37), and twenty-three of these teac h in gs are only found in one of
the sources. Here are these principles, beginning with those mentioned the most frequently and ranging
to those which are mentioned in only one source (the number of sources each principle is cited in is
found to the right of that principle, in parentheses):

> 1. Oneness of humanity (32)
> 2. Religion must be in agreement with science and reason (27)
> 3. Religion must be conducive to love and unity (26)
> 4. Equality of men and women (23)
> 5. Abandonment of prejudices (23)
> 6 Independent investigation of reality/search for truth (21)
> 7. Universal Peace (20)
> 8. Universal education and curriculum (17)
> 9. Humanity must depend upon the Holy Spirit (13)
> 10. Economic readjustment (13)
> 11. Foundation and reality of all religions are one (13)
> 12. Equal rights for all (11)
> 13. Universal language (10)
> 14. International Tribunal (5)
> 15. Universal justice (4)
> 16. Spiritual brotherhood (4)
> 17. Tra in ing in useful craft, art, science or profession (3)
> 18. Material civ il iz ation must be combined with divine civ il iz ation (3)
> 19. Heavenly morals and spiritual civ il iz ation (3)
> 20. Work to the best of one’s ability is worship (2)
> 21. Religion must be free from dogma and imitation (2)

> 22. Reconciliation of religious systems (2)
> 23. Oneness of God (2)
> 24. Religion must not mix with politics (2)
> 25. Religion is a mighty bulwark (2)
> 26. Universal employment: all must work, work for all (1)
> 27. Religion must be a factor for human progress (1)
> 28. Oneness of reality (1)
> 29. Reconciliation of science and religion through science and art (1)
> 30. Love for an im als (1)
> 31. Love for all men (1)
> 32. Education of women (1)
> 33. Agreement of the peoples of the world (1)
> 34. Inter-racial peace (1)
> 35. Voluntary sharing of property with humanity (1)
> 36. Demonstration of Divinity and inspiration (1)
> 37. Power of the influence of Bahá’u’lláh (1)
> 38. True freedom for man is from the world of nature (1)
> 39. Establishment of the House of Justice (1)
> 40. Social classes reformed but ranks preserved (1)
> 41. Establishment of the Center of the Covenant
> 42. Dawn of the Sun of Reality from Persia (1)
> 43. Religion is the divine remedy (1)
> 44. International unity (1)
45. Find a common point of agreement; those who insist they are right are wrong (1)

The location of these teac h in gs in the thirty-seven sources are cited in Appendix Two. Chart One fea-
tures a subd iv ision of these principles into four groups of nine each. In Appendix Three are the rank-
ings of these principles, those which are numbered and those which are sequenced. There are consider-
able differences between the numbered and sequenced rankings, which might lead us to the conclusion
that the actual order of the presentation of these teachings does not indicate its relative importance in
the constellation of Bahá’í values. For example, if we consider those teac h in gs of Bahá’u’lláh which are
cited first in each of these thirty-seven sources, we find that the numbered lists feature “The
Independent Investigation of Reality/Search for Truth” as the first teaching of Bahá’u’lláh in twelve out
of seventeen such sources, and “The Oneness of Humanity” in this first rank in five out of the same
seventeen sources. On the other hand, if we consult sequences of teachings in the remaining twenty
sources, we find one reference to “The Independent Investigation of Reality” (12), and twelve [references]
to “The Oneness of Humanity” as well as other first rankings, including “Oneness of God” (20, 21),
“Universal Peace” (7), “Abandonment of Prejudices” (2), “Universal Education” (4), “The Unity of the
Religion of God” (30), and “Agreement among the peoples of the world” (32). Hence, while the reader of
the numbered lists of Bahá’í teachings might come to the conclusion that “The Independent Investigation
of Reality” is the first and foremost of the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh, this inclusion of sequenced teach-
ings seems to indicate that “The Oneness of Humanity” is at least as important and that it was cited
even more often, in the limited context we are surve y in g, as the first Bahá’í principle.

The overarching importance of this teaching of “The Oneness of Humanity” is indicated by the fact
that it is ranked most often as the second teaching of Bahá’u’lláh in the numbered lists, in fully ten out
of fourteen numbered lists, and also in five out of twenty of the sequences. This compares to three sec-
ond-place rankings of “The Independent Investigation of Reality” in the numbered lists, and likewise
three out of the twenty sequences. Only one other principle is listed in second place in the numbered
lists, “Universal Peace” (37), while eleven other principles are found in the sequences in this ranking:
“The Unity of the Religion of God” (12, 25, 26), “Religion must be the cause of love and unity” (14, 30,
33), “Universal Peace” (2,6), “Universal brotherhood” (5), “International Unity” (32), “Dependence upon
the Holy Spirit” (35), and “Religion must be in agreement with science and reason” (24). It is evident from
studying these sequences that two other principles tied with “The Independent Investigation of Reality”

for second place well behind “The Oneness of Humanity” as the second Bahá’í principle. In one of His
talks (29), ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is reported to have said: “the fundamental principle of Bahá’u’lláh is the oneness
of the world of humanity_.”

We may also view the presentation of “The Independent Investigation of Reality” and “The Oneness
of Humanity” at the forefront of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s talks and letters describing the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh
as intended to facilitate the understanding of the listener and reader. “The Independent Investigation of
Reality” seems to many as an appropriate beginn in g_we begin by each of us thinking for ourselves,
assuming responsibility for our own learning, and coming to our own conclusions. Likewise, “The
Oneness of Humanity” is a fundamental principle, to which all the other Bahá’í teac h in gs can be relat-
ed. For example, if humanity is one, then it is eminently reasonable that religion should be conducive to
love and unity, that women and men should be equal, that we should abandon our prejudices, that uni-
versal peace should be established, and so forth. Hence, the ordering of presentation may perform the
function of creating an associative map in the mind of the listener or reader, enabling him to connect
and therefore to understand and relate to this diversity of principles. Each mind and heart is unique, and
it is te ll ing that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has not cited the same list of Bahá’í teachings in any two talks or letters_the
order of presentation varies, and I am suggesting that it varies because ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was adapting His
remarks to the particular collection of minds and hearts which He was addressing on those various occa-
sions. Context is important, and here is a lesson for those who would teach in the footsteps of the
Master. On the other hand, the consistency of the teachings presented by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is likewise
notable. He does not talk a lot about Bahá’í laws or Bahá’í institutions, nor does He insist, in these talks,
upon the prophecies fulfilled by the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. Indeed, He rarely mentions the Persons of the
Báb and Bahá’u’lláh in these thirty-seven sources, or, for that matter, in most of His other talks and let-
ters written for Western audiences and readers. His emphasis seems to be on giving clear and concise
descriptions of certain fundamental teachings of Bahá’u’lláh.

We have earlier noted the front-rank status of “The Oneness of Humanity” as a Bahá’í principle, but
let us now consider what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has said about various other principles found in these sources. In
His Tablet to Mrs. Crump Cone (2), ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes that “the most important teaching of Bahá’u’lláh,
is to leave behind racial, political, religious, and patriotic prejudices_it is impossible to strike at the root
of these racial, political, religious and patriotic prejudices unless the inhabitants of the world come
under the shadow of Bahá’u’lláh.” Here ‘Abdu’l-Bahá relates this principle to another teaching of
Bahá’u’lláh, and while He has affirmed that the abandonment of prejudice is “the most important teach-
ing of Bahá’u’lláh” nevertheless He asserts that “it is impossible to strike at the root of these racial,
political, religious and patriotic prejudices unless the inhabitants of the world come under the shadow
of Bahá’u’lláh”—which we take to mean: until they follow the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh as a whole. Another
statement which places “The Oneness of Humanity” in context is found in a talk (20), as follows: “The
great and fundamental teac h in gs of Bahá’u’lláh are the oneness of God and the unity of mankind.” In
that talk ‘Abdu’l-Bahá appeals to the Bahá’ís to translate these ideas into realities: “Now must we, like-
wise, bind ourselves together in the utmost unity, be kind and loving to each other, sacrificing all our
possessions, our honor, yea, even our lives for each other. Then will it be proved that we have acted
according to the teac h in gs of God, that we have been realbelievers in the oneness of God and unity of
mankind.” It is hence in the context of actualizing these teac h in gs that they are “great and fundamental
teachings of Bahá’u’lláh...”

While ‘Abdu’l-Bahá calls “the oneness of the world of humanity” in another talk (36) “a fundamental
teaching of Bahá’u’lláh” we should note that He follows this assertion in that same talk with this state-
ment (PUP:455): “As to the most great characteristic of the revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, a specific teaching
not given by any of the Prophets of the past: It is the ord in ation and appointment of the Center of the
Covenant.” In anothertalk (10/31/1912, Hotel Plaza, Chicago, Illinois; PUP, pp. 381–383), ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
says, in confirmation of the importance of this principle (p. 381): “Today the most important principle
of faith is firmness in the Covenant, because firmness in the Covenant wards off differences. Therefore,
you must be as firm as mountains.” There are many ways to understand these statements. For example,
while ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stresses the fundamental nature of “The Oneness of Humanity” in many of His talks,

\[146\] Lights of ‘Irfán

He has spoken of the Center of the Covenant in talks addressed specifically to the Bahá’ís. Also, wh il e
He affirmed “The Oneness of Humanity” a “fundamental teaching of Bahá’u’lláh,” the language He uses
in reference to the Covenant is “most great characteristic” and “most important principle of faith”—both
of which phrases clearly affirm rank and value. Furthermore, in the context of the establ is hment of the
Center of the Covenant, we may understand that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s exaltation of the principle of “The
Oneness of Humanity” is far from an affirmation of Western hum an ist or democratic ideals, either as
they were understood during His lifetime or during our own epoch. On the contrary, it indicates that
Bahá’u’lláh’s vision of “The Oneness of Humanity” requires recognition of and obedience to a divinely-
inspired and prophetically-authorized Center, in effect, to a heavenly King. Also, we might note anoth-
er of the teac h in gs of Bahá’u’lláh that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá cited often (thirteen times) in these sources, and in
many other talks and letters which were translated into English during this period, a teaching which is
described eloquently in the following excerpts from His talks (13,15,17, 23 , 25,27):

> It is only by the breath of the Holy Spirit that spiritual development can come about. No mat-
> ter how the material world may progress, no matter how splendidly it may adorn itself, it can
> never be anything but a lifeless body unless the soul is within, for it is the soul that an im ates
> the body; the body alone has no real significance. Deprived of the blessings of the Holy Spirit
> the material body would be inert. (Paris Talks, p. 133)
> We understand that the Holy Spirit is the energizing factor in the life of man. Whosoever
> receives this power is able to inf luence all with whom he comes into contact...
> An humble man without learning, but filled with the Holy Spirit, is more powerful than the
> most nobly-born profound scholar without that inspiration. He who is educated by the Holy
> Spirit can, in his time, lead others to receive the same Spirit.
> I pray for you that you may be informed by the life of the Divine Spirit, so that you may be
> the means of educating others. (PT, p. 165)
> Bahá’u’lláh teaches that the world of humanity is in need of the breath of the Holy Spirit, for
> in spiritual quickening and enlightenment true oneness is attained with God and man. (PUP,
> pp. 108–109)
> The world of humanity cannot advance through mere physical powers and intellectual attain-
> ments; nay, rather, the Holy Spirit is essential. (PUP, p. 182)
> The spirit of man is not illum in ed and quickened through material sources. It is not resusci-
> tated by investigating phenomena of the world of matter. The spirit of man is in need of the
> protection of the Holy Spirit. Just as he advances by progressive stages from the mere physical
> world of being into the intellectual realm, so must he develop upward in moral attributes and
> spiritual graces. In the process of this attainment he is ever in need of the bestowals of the
> Holy Spirit. (PUP, p. 288)
> True distinction among mankind is through divine bestowals and receiving the intuitions of
> the Holy Spirit. If man does not become the recipient of the heavenly bestowals and spiritual
> bounties, he remains in the plane and kingdom of the an im al. (PUP, pp. 316–317)
The citation of these passages was not effected in order to advance a claim as to the relative impor-
tance of one Bahá’í teaching over another. Rather, these statements have been included in order to
demonstrate, by example, the impact which a single Bahá’í principle can have upon our understand in g
of all other Bahá’í principles. For example, the Bahá’í principle which calls for “The Independent
Investigation of Reality” might imply, for some readers, that Bahá’u’lláh encourages each one of His fol-
lowers to find his own way to the truth, relying only upon his own personal judgment. However, in the
context of the establishment of the Center of the Covenant, and the teaching that man must “become
the recipient of the heavenly bestowals and spiritual bounties” vouchsafed by the Holy Spirit, it is clear
and evident that Bahá’u’lláh is calling His follower to discovery of that spiritual reality which is beyond
his human understand in g, for the apprehension of which he requires a divinely-inspired guide, the Center
of the Covenant, and continuous dependence upon “the intuitions of the Holy Spirit” rather than

reliance upon his five senses, his rational faculty and his human learning. Hence, it is in the overall inter-
play and interpenetration of these various principles that the one truth may be recognized which tran-
scends particularity and the distortions of human perception.
A Comparison of these Enumerated and Sequenced Teachings with the Principles which ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá Specifically Identified as New and Distinctive to the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh

In some of His talks, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá indicated that there were various teac h in gs of Bahá’u’lláh that have
never before appeared from the Prophets of God:

> Thus when hatred and animosity, fighting, slaughtering, and great coldness of heart were gov-
> erning this world, and darkness had overcome the nations, Bahá’u’lláh, like a bright star, rose
> from the hor iz on of Persia, and shone with the great Light of Guidance, giving heavenly radi-
> ance and establishing New Teac h in g. (Talk at Theosophical Society, 30 September 1911; pub-
> lished in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in London:27)
> At such a time as this Bahá’u’lláh appeared among them like a lum in ary in the heavens. He
> flooded the East with light. He proclaimed new principles and teachings. He laid a basis for
> new institutions which are the very spirit of modernism, the light of the world, the develop-
> ment of the body politic and eternal honor. (Talk at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Parsons,
> Washington, D.C., 7 November 1912; translated by Dr. Aminu’ ll ah Farid, transcribed by
> Joseph H. Hannen; published in PUP:402)
> Some who could find no other pretext have said, “These teachings are not new; they are old
> and fam il i ar; we have heard them before.” Therefore, I will speak to you upon the distinctive
> characteristics of the manifestation of Bahá’u’lláh and prove that from every standpoint His
> Cause is distinguished from all others. (Talk at the home of Miss Juliet Thompson, New York
> City, 15 November 1912; translated by Dr. Aminu’ ll ah Farid, transcribed by Mr. Hooper
> Harris; published in PUP:431)
> I will speak to you concerning the special teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. All the divine principles
> announced by the tongue of the Prophets of the past are to be found in the words of
> Bahá’u’lláh; but in addition to these He has revealed certain new teachings which are not to be
> found in any of the sacred Books of former times. I shall mention some of them; the others,
> which are many in number, may be found in the Books, Tablets and Epistles written by
> Bahá’u’lláh—such as the Hidden Words, the Glad Tid in gs, the Words of Paradise, Tajallíyát,
> Tarázát and others. Likewise, in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas there are new teachings which cannot be
> found in any of the past Books or Epistles of the Prophets. (Talk at the home of Mr. and Mrs.
> Kinney, New York City, 2 December 1912; translated by Dr. Aminu’llah Farid, transcribed by
> Miss Esther Foster; published in PUP:453–454)
> I am going to quote you some of Bahá’u’lláh’s instructions for this day and you will show me
> in which sacred book they are to be found.... These precepts were proclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh
> many years ago. He was the first to create them in the hearts as moral laws.” (Talk in Par is ,
> n.d.; publ is h ed in ABDP:82, 85)
In some of His talks ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asserted that the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh are in keeping with the
“spirit of the Age.” As He paired this statement, in two separate talks, with affirmations that those
teachings which constitute the “spirit of the Age” were new teachings, we may conclude that these teach-
ings are also distinctive to the Bahá’í Revelation:

> ...all have conceded that the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh are superlative in character, acknowledg-
> ing that they constitute the very essence or spirit of this new age and that there is no better
> pathway to the attainment of its ideals. (Talk at the home of Miss Juliet Thompson, New York
> City, 15 November 1912; translated by Dr. Aminu’ ll ah Farid, transcribed by Mr. Hooper
> Harris; published in PUP:431)
> His teac h in gs, which embody the divine spirit of the age and are applicable to this period of
> maturity in the life of the human world, are... (Talk at Geneological Hall, New York City, 17

\[148\] Lights of ‘Irfán

> November 1912; translated by Dr. Aminu’llah Farid, transcribed by Mrs. Edna McKinney; pub-
> lished in PUP:440)
> Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings are the health of the world. They represent the spirit of this age, the
> light of this age, the well-being of this age, the soul of this cycle. The world will be at rest
> when they are put into practice, for they are reality. (Talk in Paris, n.d.; published in
> ABDP:85–86)
One more, it is imperative that we distinguish between those teachings identified as new and consti-
tuting the “spirit of this Age” on the one hand, and those teac h in gs which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá regarded as essen-
tial and central to the Bahá’í Revelation. In other words, in His terminology, new does not necessar il y
imply “most important.” While further study of these principles may indeed indicate that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
regarded the new teac h in gs as being among the most important principles of the Bahá’í Faith, the pre-
sent author is not prepared to make such an assertion at this time. Hence, we seem to have five separate
sources of “new” teachings of Bahá’u’lláh, and all of them are represented among the sources for this
study—they are, consecutively, sources (12), (14), (34), (35) and (36). Of these five talks, two (14,34) are
numbered, and the other three are sequenced. In three out of five lists, the first principle is the inde-
pendent investigation of reality/search for truth; in the other two, the first principle is the oneness of
the world of humanity, and the independent investigation of truth is in the sixth (35) and the second
place (36). The order of presentation of these “new” principles follows the same patterns as the other lists
studied. Taken as a group, these five sources represent nineteen teac h in gs, listed below and on Chart Two
(with the number of sources represented in parentheses):

Independent investigation of reality/search for truth (5)

> 1. oneness of the world of humanity (5)
> 2. religion must be the cause of love and unity (5)
> 3. religion must be in agreement with science and reason (5)
> 4. elim in ation of prejudices (4)
> 5. reality of the divine religions is one (4)
> 6. equality of men and women (4)
> 7. compulsory universal education (4)
> 8. universal auxiliary language will be adopted (3)
> 9. Universal Peace will come (3)
> 10. International Tribunal (2)
> 11. everyone must learn a useful profession, art or trade (2)
> 12. work done in the spirit of service is the highest form of worship (2)
> 13. protection and guidance of the Holy Spirit (1)
> 14. the different social classes are preserved (1)
> 15. work for all (1)
> 16. destroy antagonism by finding a point of agreement_
> 17. if two dispute about religion both are wrong (1)
> 18. House of Justice (1)
19. Center of the Covenant (1)

Hence, we find that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá identified at least 19 “new” and “d is tinctive” teachings in five of His
talks and that He affirmed some twenty-six other teachings in other talks and in Tablets written to
Western believers during His ministry as Center of the Covenant. Of these, how many are featured in
Bahá’í pamphlets and lea fl e ts? Many pamphlets and lea fl e ts do not list any of these teac h in gs, while oth-
ers focus on one or two, such as the oneness of humanity, the equality of men and women, or the elim-
ination of prejudices. Those which feature lists of Bahá’í principles typically cite ten teachings, usually
in this general order:

> 1. oneness of mankind
> 2. independent investigation of reality
> 3. one foundation of all religions

> 4. essential harmony of science and religion
> 5. equality of men and women
> 6. elim in ation of prejudices
> 7. universal compulsory education
> 8. spiritual solution to the economic problem
> 9. universal auxiliary language
10. universal peace upheld by a world government

Some pamphlets also feature Bahá’u’lláh’s affirmation that there is but one God, and a recent lea fl e t
also features “protection of cultural diversity” as a Bahá’í principle. While well-read Bahá’ís understand
that by “spiritual solution to the economic problem” we are referring to a number of Bahá’í teachings—
including (12) everyone must learn a useful profession, art or trade; (13) work done in the spirit of ser-
vice is the highest form of worship; (15) the different social classes are preserved; and (16) work for all—
this is not understood by the reader of these pamphlets. Indeed, this “spiritual solution to the econom-
ic problem” could mean nothing more than “be nice to people”—whereas the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh per-
ta in ing to work are much more detailed and challenging to the status quo. It is evident that these pam-
phlets and lea fl e ts are not feat ur ing almost half of the teac h in gs which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá specifically identi-
fied as “new” and “distinctive” to the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh in certain of His talks. Nor do they men-
tion, taking into account the reference to the oneness of God in one pamphlet, some thirty-five other
Bahá’í principles that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá enumerated or sequenced in His talks and Tablets.

The extant introductory literature on the Bahá’í Faith in the English language includes the classic writ-
ten by Dr. John E. Esslemont, Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era, first published in 1923, and revised in 1937,
1950 and 1970 and two recent works, The Bahá’í Religion, by Peter Smith (George Ronald, 1988) and The
Bahá’í Faith, by Joseph Sheppherd (Element, 1992). These three books will be given abbreviated titles for
the duration of this paper, respectively—BNE, BR and BF. The most recent edition of BNE features two
chapters, Chapter 9, entitled “True Civ il iz ation” and Chapter 10, entitled “The Way to Peace” which,
between them, feature most of the “new” teac h in gs of Bahá’u’lláh cited by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; the “new” teach-
ings not discussed in these chapters are introduced in other chapters of this book. BNE is so compre-
hensive that it features all or virtually all of the 45 principles found in the talks and tablets of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. BR devotes Chapter 2 to “Religious Doctrines” and Chapter 3 to “Social Doctrines.” In Chapter
2 we find none either of the “new” teac h in gs or of the numbered and sequenced teac h in gs of Bahá’u’lláh.
In Chapter 3 we find the follow in g:

international order: which seems to correspond to the “new” teachings—“universal peace”: (10) and
“international tribunal”: (11)

> oneness of humanity: (2)
> economic justice: including Bahá’í teac h in gs on this subject which have some overlap with ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s articulation of “economic readjustment”: (10) among the listed principles

political order: featuring none of the “new” teac h in gs noted by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá but including the fol-
lowing “listed” teachings—universal justice: (15), and equal rights: (12)

> sexual equality: (7)
> universal education: (8), however, education is described as a “right” rather than as a “responsibility”
incumbent upon every human being; reference is made to another of the “new” teac h in gs of Bahá’u’lláh—
everyone must learn a useful profession, art or trade: (12); and to one of the listed principles as well—
education of women: (32)

> spiritual and material civ il iz ation: (18) among the listed principles
> All in all, BR features six of the nineteen “new” teachings of Bahá’u’lláh in Chapter 2, as well as intro-
ducing the Universal House of Justice and the Center of the Covenant in Chapter 6, “Bahá’í
Adm in is t ration,” for a total of eight. We also found some of the teac h in gs listed in sources studied—
equal rights (12), universal justice (15), education of women (32). This introduction is much less compre-
hensive in its depiction of “new” and “listed” Bahá’í teac h in gs than BNE.

BF features various Bahá’í teachings in its “Part III: The Basic Teachings,” including the follow in g
(mostly found in Chapter 13):

> oneness of God (Chapter 10 and Chapter 13): (23) [in listed teac h in gs]
> oneness of humanity: (2)
> e l im in ation of prejudices: (5)
> universal justice: (15) [in listed teachings]
> e l im in ation of poverty: included in (10) [in listed teachings]
> universal education: (8), however, without use of the authoritative term “compulsory” which carries
more weight than “duty”

religion and science should be recognized as different ways of describing the same phenomena: with
some resemblance to (4), but without the requirement that religion be in agreement with science and rea-
son (which is what “distinguishes” this teaching from other attempts to reconcile religion with science
and reason

> world peace: (10)
> international tribunal: (11)
> international auxiliary language: (9)
> In Chapter 15 we find a two-page reference to “Bahá’í Adm in is t ration” which mentions the Universal
House of Justice in the midst of a single sentence, but not the Center of the Cove n an t. In fact, the
Center of the Covenant is never mentioned at all, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá makes a short appearance in two sen-
tences, Chapter 9.

BR and BF do not include all of the “new” teachings of Bahá’u’lláh that were singled out for mention
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in five of His talks. Nor do they treat a number of the Bahá’í teac h in gs enumerated and
sequenced in the 37 sources studied for this paper. For a comprehensive introduction to these “new” and
“listed” teachings, it is evident that we would have to turn to BNE rather than to either of these more
recent introductions to the Bahá’í Faith. While the presentation and ordering of these teac h in gs in BNE
may not suit every reader, and may not be as conducive to memory recall as the enumeration and sequenc-
ing of principles by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, nevertheless, BNE is distinctive in being the longest-lived and simul-
taneously the most comprehensive of all introductions to the Bahá’í Faith. Not one of these three intro-
ductory books repeats ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s assertion that these teachings are “new” and “d is tinctive” to the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. Not one of these books states that Bahá’u’lláh revealed innumerable teachings
which touch upon every aspect of ind iv idual and communal life, notwithstanding ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s reiter-
ated affirmation of this truth in some of the sources cited above. Nor do they indicate where the read-
er may next turn in order to become better informed about these teachings, and the many other princi-
ples of Bahá’u’lláh which are not included in these talks and Tablets, notwithstanding ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ref-
erence to specific tablets revealed by Bahá’u’lláh as sources for those teachings.

The pr im ary purpose of this paper was to introduce its readers to the wide range of principles that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá included in His talks and letters addressed to the Western believers in the Bahá’í Faith. It
has been demonstrated that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá cited at least forty-five different Bahá’í teachings in the thirty-
seven sources exam in ed. Inasmuch as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá did not standardize His listing of Bahá’í principles,
but seems to have adapted His presentation to a variety of audiences, it is nevertheless evident that He
introduced the teachings He chose to describe in a relatively consistent order and ranking. Bahá’ís who
aspire to follow His example in presenting the Bahá’í teac h in gs to the general public might benefit from
a close study of the range and order of those principles which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sought to convey to His
Western audience. Also, inasmuch as He expected that His Western followers would spearhead the prop-
agation of the Bahá’í Faith throughout the planet, as evidenced by His authorship of the Tablets of the
Divine Plan, it likewise seems evident that He intended that these principles be emphasized by Bahá’í
teachers outside of the Occident, indeed, in addressing all of humanity. This is also confirmed by His
authoring of a Tablet addressed to Miss Mochizuki of Japan, source (9), which was translated by Mirza

Azizu’llah Bahadur on 12/9/1920 and published in Star of the West (SW XII:2, p. 41), which features a
list of Bahá’í principles very sim il ar to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s lists of “new” teac h in gs, from talks delivered in
London, Paris and New York City. However, there is no indication, at least from these sources, that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá wished that the presentation of Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings be standard iz ed according to a fixed
formula, or that any of these teachings, which He so painstakingly explained in His talks and letters,
were to be brushed aside in the interests of “economy” or “simplicity” of presentation.

Hence, it is also the aim of this paper to suggest that the Bahá’í principles found in the talks and let-
ters of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá are not necessarily ranked, in the numbered and sequenced lists, in the order of their
importance to the Cause of God. Rather, these lists seem to represent a kind of associative map that
enables the reader or listener to follow from general principles to related teachings, and ultimately to
arrive at a wholistic understanding of certain fundamentals revealed by Bahá’u’lláh. Hence, they often
begin with “The Independent Investigation of Reality” or with “The Oneness of Mankind,” as both of
these principles lead by association to the other teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. Perhaps, if Bahá’í teachers were
to study the method followed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, they would learn to more effectively transmit the Bahá’í
teachings to those millions who are as yet unacquainted with the most recent Manifestation of God.
There may be all sorts of creative ways in which Bahá’í speakers and authors can apply this web tech-
nique to the spiritual edification of humanity. This approach may also facilitate the application of Bahá’í
principles to social and economic development projects in communities of all sizes and sorts.

Furthermore, it seems that the substance and order of presentation of Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings found in
these thirty-seven sources correspond very closely to “new” teac h in gs of Bahá’u’lláh which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
has “distinguished” from earlier Scriptures and Dispensations. On the one hand, not all of the Bahá’í
teachings are entirely “new” and more research is needed to identify those which are also found in pre-
viously-revealed Scriptures. The purpose of such a study would be to point out those essential teachings
which the Bahá’í Faith has in common with all other divinely-revealed religions. But that is another paper
altogether! There has been a natural tendency for Bahá’ís to regard the teachings set forth in these num-
bered and sequenced lists—whether in the talks and Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá or in the pamphlets and
introductory books at our disposal—as the most important, the essential, the fundamental Bahá’í teach-
ings. It has been pointed out that this is not necessarily an accurate reading of the intentions of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, or, through Him, the purpose of Bahá’u’lláh. This has been demonstrated in reference to ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s talks on the establ is hment of the Center of the Covenant, and His insistence upon our human
necessity for and dependence upon inspiration from the Holy Spirit. Perhaps this limited paper will
inspire other students of the Bahá’í Revelation to undertake more thorough and comprehensive exami-
nations of the breadth and depth of Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings, which will ever be “boundless and illim-
itable” (PUP:457).
