Role of Principles in the Bahá’í Faith

Principles and Fashion

Farjam Majd

Abstract

Are moral laws and values relative or absolute? Is living
according to long-established moral values old-fashioned? How
did past religions fall into ritualistic imitations? Should we be
more conservative or progressive? And more generally, how do
we identify and apply principles to questions of great import?

To explore these questions systematically, a hierarchical or
tree-like model of the world is presented including two tree
structures each having nodes and links defining multiple levels
of organization: a system tree (specific to general) and a type
tree (general to specific). Any entity at all, an object, a
principle, a process, and the like may be represented as a node at
some level in these two tree structures. This hierarchical model
holds within itself and clearly manifests many important and
inherent relationships between the entities it represents by
virtue of the position of those entities on the trees. Examples
of these inherent relationships are simultaneity and relativity.

The principles revealed by Bahá’u’lláh are shown to be
general principles at the root of the type tree and while in their
application variations exist, in their essence they are
unchangeable truths. Thus, being principled has nothing to do
with being old-fashioned or new-fashioned; or conservative or
progressive because principles are timeless.

Introduction

Abdu’l-Bahá, the Son of the Author and Founder of the
Bahá’í Faith, Bahá’u’lláh, has stated: “[n]ow concerning nature,
it is but the essential properties and the necessary relations
inherent in the realities of things. And though these infinite
realities are diverse in their character yet they are in the utmost
harmony and closely connected together” [TAF 20]. This is a very
insightful and important statement. It signifies that diverse and
different entities are connected together and have relations in
their realities which are inherent. Here, a class of inherent
relationships, concerning the inherent hierarchical structures of
entities and information, is explored.

Of Fashion and Models

No discourse on fashion is complete without talking about
models and supermodels. Context is our friend, however, and
by identifying the proper context we need not stray too far
from our objectives in this paper. One of the distinguishing
qualities of the human mind is its ability to understand abstract
relationships and think in terms of models of reality. Simply
put, a model of an entity is a set of components with the
interrelationships between them, all together representing the
entity. Models of entities are not unique or complete. Various
aspects of an entity may be modeled, possibly each aspect with a
different model, for better focus and other practical purposes.

An entity can literally be anything: an object, a process, a
relationship, an organization, or any other conceivable thing.
Principles are no exception. They can be modeled. However, a
model for one or a number of particular principles is not being
proposed here. Rather, a meta model, a model of models, a
supermodel is presented. This supermodel includes general and
important aspects of every other model, as will be made clearer
in the following passages.

Principles in the Bahá’í Faith                                 263

The Runway in the Forest

Every supermodel needs a runway to demonstrate her talents.

The runway for our supermodel is a forest full of trees. After
all, what else would a forest be full of? But these are no
ordinary trees. They hold the keys to clearly defining and
understanding some of the most significant, puzzling, and
sometimes contentious issues human kind has faced and
continues to face.

Let’s first start with the trees and we’ll eventually get to the
forest. Actually, we’ll have to first start with the roots,
branches, and leaves to create the tree. One aspect of a tree is
that it represents a hierarchy, and a hierarchy is a very
fundamental structure. We’ll soon find out just how
fundamental it is. However, the reader is cautioned that this
walk in the forest at first may seem dry and feel like a walk in
the desert, far from the subject at hand. But, this walk is
necessary to build a foundation and will soon lead us back to
the main path.

Any entity at all, an object, a principle, a process, and the
like may be represented as a hierarchy. This is because any such
entity inevitably has some components which constitute the
entity. In turn, the entity itself is inevitably a component of a
bigger entity. Perhaps viewing this entity as a system offers a
more concrete and tangible perspective, because it is clear that a
system has components and it is equally clear that the system is a
component in a bigger system. This inclusion of components in
bigger and bigger systems, or conversely, systems containing
smaller and smaller components define a hierarchy. This concept
is best illustrated with some examples to indicate at once its
ubiquity and broadness across diverse areas, and its power and
simplicity to represent important aspects of any system.

As a first example, consider the system of language. A book
is a system of written language which includes chapters. Each
chapter in turn includes pages, pages include paragraphs,
paragraphs include sentences, sentences include words, words
include letters, and so on. The book system itself is also a
component of a library, which is a bigger system. The
relationship between each part of the written language and its

264                                     Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

constituent components can be clearly represented as a
hierarchy.

As a second example, consider a physical system, such as a
house. A house is a system which includes rooms, rooms include
walls and doors, walls include bricks (and doors have their own
components), and so on. The house system itself is also a
component in a bigger system which is a neighborhood. The
relationship between each part of the house and its constituent
components can also be clearly represented as a hierarchy.

The Anatomy of a System Tree

The hierarchical relationship described above may now be
cast in the mold of a tree, as depicted in Figure 1, to help us get
back to our roots in this paper. A system tree, further described
below with respect to Figure 2, represents no less than a whole
system. Tree structures, when used for modeling, are generally
depicted in an upside down orientation with the root at top and
leaves at bottom. A system, as a whole, being modeled or
represented by a system tree corresponds to the root. First level
components of the system, those which together form the
system, correspond to internal nodes (shown by small circles in
these figures) or branches of the tree. The second level
components, or subcomponents, those which together form the
first level components, correspond to the next level of nodes or
branches.

This correspondence between the system components and
subcomponents with the nodes of the tree continues until the
leaves of the tree are reached. The leaves of the tree represent
the last set of subcomponents to be modeled. This point is
arbitrary and depends on the purpose of the modeling. That is,
the tree may have arbitrary depth and may be extended upwards
from the root or downwards from the leaves to include an
arbitrary number of levels. Hence, a given tree may also be
viewed as a sub-tree in a bigger tree, making the root node of
the sub-tree, an intermediate node in the bigger tree, which in
turn will have a higher level root of its own.

Principles in the Bahá’í Faith                               265

Figure 1: General (upside down) tree structure

As also indicated before, the specifics of the system tree are
somewhat arbitrary, and thus flexible, in that the system being
modeled may be decomposed into components along boundaries
and based on parameters dictated by the purpose of modeling
and the nature of the application at hand. That is, the model is
not deterministic or unique. In other words, the same system
may be modeled with many different system trees depending on
the purpose of the modeling, amount of details desired, and the
type of information needed, to name just a few factors
considered in modeling.

The Physiology of a System Tree

If the structure of a tree is its anatomy, then the properties
are its physiology. This hierarchical model has certain intrinsic
properties, which are briefly described here. A few of these
properties are described in more detail as they are more relevant
to the modeling and analysis of principles. The system tree is
firstly characterized as being a Specific To General (STG) tree
when proceeding from the root to the leaves. This is so because
the system as a whole, corresponding to the root, is the most
specific entity being modeled. As the tree is traversed towards
the leaves, each successive subcomponent becomes simpler and
thus more general. To illustrate, going back to the example of
the house, a house as a whole is a specific and particular
building. The next level of components of the house, for

266                                   Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

example, the rooms, are necessarily simpler and necessarily more
general in nature. That is, the same room can be a component of
many houses while the houses as a whole are specific and
different from each other. Similarly, a room is made of walls
which are still simpler and more general than rooms, and a wall
is made of bricks, which are the most general and least specific
or distinguished components in the building and thus may be
used in any part of any building.

Figure 2: System tree — STG: Specific (root) To

General (leaves)

A few words about the semantics of trees will help in
describing their properties more clearly. The system tree is an
upside down tree including successive layers of nodes going
from a single root node to the leaf nodes. If the root node is
viewed as a first generation, then the next level of nodes may be
viewed as its children or the second generation. The third level
of nodes are the children of the second generation or level, and
so on down to the leaves. Thus, each node has both a single
parent and one or more children. A node is a child with respect
to its higher level nodes (closer to the root node) and a parent
with respect to its lower level nodes (closest to the leaves).

But the attributes and characteristics of the hierarchical tree
model does not end with generational analogy of parent and

Principles in the Bahá’í Faith                               267

children. There are many other important and interesting
characteristics which are inherent in this fundamental structure.
Some of the most important of these characteristics, briefly
reviewed below, include containment/inclusion, scope,
recursion, simultaneity, relativity, symmetry, emergent
properties, system behavior, abstraction, dependency flow, and
reductionism.

Containment or Inclusion

The containment or inclusion property of the system tree
provides that a node includes, or is constituted by all its child
nodes. So, a room node in a model of a house includes or
contains all child nodes such as walls and doors. Conversely,
when walls and doors are combined, they constitute a room.

Scope

The scope property provides that the scope of detail at every
level of the tree is different from other levels. As the tree is
traversed towards the root node, the scope becomes broader.
This property is sometimes indicated with the semantics of high-
level (less detailed; near the root) or low-level (more detailed;
near leaves) in system tree, analogous to zooming out or in with
a camera, when looking at a house, respectively.

Recursion

The recursion property provides that any arbitrary node in a
system tree can itself be considered the root of the sub-tree
under that node. That is, the tree structure is recursive and any
sub-tree looks like the whole tree in structure.

Simultaneity

The simultaneity property is highly significant and has many
important implications in various fields. This property provides
that a system may operate differently at different levels of the
system tree, at the same time without conflict or contradiction.
For example, in the house model, a round wall may be made

268                                    Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

with square bricks. A round wall can exist at one level
simultaneously with square bricks at a lower level, without
contradiction. As another example, consider the system tree of
the process of walking. Walking is a process at one level and
includes foot steps as its components at a lower level. A person
may walk several times from a door to a window and back,
which is a deterministic path, while the size and direction of
each step taken is random. So, a deterministic process may exist
simultaneously with a random process in the same overall
process, at different levels and without contradiction.

Relativity

The relativity property provides that at high levels, which
have less detail and thus fewer choices, the properties are more
absolute. While at low levels, which have more detail and thus
offer more choices, the node attributes are more variable and
more relative. Something can be relative only if a choice of
more than one option is available, while it is absolute when
there is only one choice. Each child node is relative compared
with its parent, while the parent node is absolute with respect to
its children because there is only a single parent node for
potentially multiple child nodes. As an example, consider
entering a house. Entering a particular house, modeled as a root
node in a system tree, is an absolute action in the sense that the
house is either entered or not. But within the house, multiple
different rooms may be entered, which is a relative action in the
sense that there are multiple choices of rooms, which are child
nodes.

Symmetry

The symmetry property is closely related to the relativity
property and provides that symmetry or invariance in the
system tree increases going towards the root.

Emergent Properties

The emergent properties attribute is an important concept,
which provides that new properties or behaviors of the system

Principles in the Bahá’í Faith                                 269

appear going towards the root of the system tree, which
properties do not exist at lower levels. For example, in the three
dimensional space, the concept of an angle comes into existence
only after two dimensions are considered. Angles do not exist in
one dimension. Another example is electronic memory, which
appears at the level of several interconnected gates or flip-flops
and does not exist at lower level of individual transistor
switches.

Analytical Properties

Some useful analytical properties of system tree includes
requirement and causation analysis. Briefly, the process of
analyzing the requirements for achieving an end result may be
modeled as a system tree by modeling the requirements in each
level as child nodes and the result as their parent. Similarly,
causation may be modeled as a system tree by modeling the
causes at each level as child nodes and the effect as their parent.
Many other analytical tools may be developed based on these
basic models.

Level-Relativity

The level-relativity of system behavior is related to
simultaneity and provides that system behavior cannot be
merely specified as a whole and must be specified relative to a
particular level.

Abstraction

The abstraction property is essential to intelligence and
provides that moving towards the more general and common
elements from specific elements may provide essential
information needed in analysis without unnecessary details that
clutter up the subject.

Dependency Flow

The dependency flow property provides that logical
dependency is always from general to specific. This means the

general must exist before the specific can exist because the
general is always embedded in the specific, but not vice versa.

Reductionism

Reductionism, which is the idea that the more complex can
be described in terms of the more basic, is limited in part by
emergent properties, because emergent properties cannot be
entirely described in terms of simpler ones.

A Few Comments about Applicability of Tree-
Based Models

While the system tree is not the main focus of this paper, it
shares many properties in common with the type tree described
below. Additionally, the system tree is equally applicable to
principles and their components, same as it pertains to any
entity, as elaborated above.

The system tree, together with the type tree, form a
comprehensive model for important aspects of any entity in the
physical world. This statement is not an overreach or a boast.
The physical world is characterized by entities composed of
components. Abdu’l-Bahá states:

> This limitless universe is like the human body, all the
> members of which are connected and linked with one
> another with the greatest strength. How much the
> organs, the members and the parts of the body of man
> are intermingled and connected for mutual aid and help,
> and how much they influence one another! [SAQ 245]

He clearly confirms that the universe itself is composed of parts
and members. He further states: “[t]he physical station is
phenomenal; it is composed of elements, and necessarily
everything that is composed is subject to decomposition” [SAQ
151]. Again, He confirms that the “physical station,” that is,
anything that exists in the physical world, “is composed of
elements.” Hence, the system tree may be used to represent
important properties and relationships between components in

any entity. Thus, the applicability of the system tree to any
entity is certain.

Similarly, the type tree, as further described below, is also
generally applicable to any entity composed of various
characteristics, since such characteristics may be added or
removed from various entities represented by the tree nodes at
different levels, corresponding to moving up and down the tree.

Some may recognize the similarity between the general-to-
specific (type tree) and specific-to-general (system tree) with the
deductive and inductive reasoning methods, respectively.
However, although similar in some respects, these concepts are
not the same. The deductive and inductive reasoning methods
are logical techniques for arriving at a valid conclusion from
valid premises. These techniques are not models for system
components or attributes, as are system and type trees,
respectively. They also do not have the same properties, some of
which were enumerated above for the tree-based models.

But our forest has more than one type of tree, it has two
types: the system tree described above, and a type tree (also
known as an “inheritance” tree in computer science circles)
described below. The type tree is opposite the system tree in the
sense that it is General To Specific (GTS): the root is the most
general and the leaves are the most specific. Figure 3 shows a
type tree for a house. In a type tree, the root represents a
general type of characteristic or attribute, which is “inherited”
by each lower level moving towards the leaves. For example, a
building is a more specific type of structure and inherits the
attributes of the structure; a residential building is a more
specific type of building and inherits the attributes of the
structure and the building; and a house is a more specific type
of residential building and inherits the attributes of the
structure, the building, and the residential building. So, in this
example model, the house is the most specific type while the
structure is the most general. The inclusion property for type
trees provides that each lower node inherits and includes all the
attributes of the higher level nodes in its path. Each lower node
in a lower level also adds new attributes not existing in the
upper levels or nodes.

Just as every entity is a node in a system tree, every entity is
also a node in a type tree. This is because every entity is a type
of something. That is, every entity has properties and attributes
which it inherits from a more general entity and also there are more
specific entities, which can inherit its properties and attributes.

The properties of the type tree are similar to ones briefly
described for the system tree above, but with some differences
due to the different natures of these trees. These properties are
only further elaborated as needed.

(leaves)

The Type Tree and Analysis of Principles

Now is the time to get back from our stroll in the forest to
the business of principles and fashion. In this business we
mainly need two assets: the properties of relativity and
simultaneity. As briefly mentioned above, in this business, the
objective is not the analysis of any particular principle. Rather,
the objective is a methodology of analysis based on the
properties of this hierarchical supermodel. However, as a
bonus, the answers to some of the ancient questions become
obvious or trivial once this analysis is understood. Another
bonus is that, while grand prospects are anticipated from the

use of this methodology, the supermodel is actually simple to
understand and apply in its essential aspects.

As an illustrative example, the biological principle that every
living organism must consume food to survive can be
instructive in understanding the application of the type tree.
Let’s call this the “food principle.” This principle in its most
general form, stated above, may be represented by the root
node. At the next lower (more detailed) level, the nodes may
represent principles which provide that plants, carnivores, and
herbivores, as more specific types of living organisms, each
require the appropriate food to survive. For example, at this
level, the food principle requires carnivores to eat meat to
survive. In the type tree, according to the property of inclusion,
these nodes inherit the attributes of living organisms and foods
from the root principle. Still, at the next lower level, a horse is a
more specific type of a herbivore and consumes grass, a more
specific type of food. At this level, the horse inherits the
attributes of herbivores in turn in addition to the attributes of
living organisms.

Applying the properties of simultaneity and relativity to the
type tree representing the food principle provides valuable
insights. The property of simultaneity provides that the
different versions of the food principle, one at the root level
applying to all living organisms and one at the lower level
applying to horses, are simultaneously true without
contradiction or conflict.

However, all principles are not created equal. The relativity
property provides that the nodes, and the principles they
represent, that are closer to the root are more general and hold
true for the lower levels, while the reverse is not true.
Conversely, the nodes farther away from the root are more
relative and varied. As nodes get farther away from the root,
the number of nodes increase at each level, signifying more
inherited attributes, and creating more variations and options.
For example, in the above model of the food principle, At the
root, there is only one form of this principle, which states that
“living organisms need food to survive.” The same statement at
a more specific level proliferates into more varied forms such as
“horses need grass to survive,” “wolves need meat to survive,”

“birds need seeds to survive,” and the like. The lower level
principles only hold true at their own nodes (and lower ones, if
any), but not for their siblings at the same level. So, there is no
valid principle stating that “horses need seeds to survive.”

Applying these insights to social principles can be even more
illuminating. Four seemingly self contradictory examples will be
used for this purpose: unity in diversity, courtesy in different
cultures, religious imitations, and the conservative-progressive
dichotomy.

Unity in Diversity

Unity in diversity is the Bahá’í principle that states that the
Bahá’í Faith “does not ignore, nor does it attempt to suppress,
the diversity of ethnical origins, of climate, of history, of
language and tradition, of thought and habit, that differentiate
the peoples and nations of the world. It calls for a wider loyalty,
for a larger aspiration than any that has animated the human
race” [WOB 41]. But, how can such diversity, particularly of
“thought and habit,” work with a “wider loyalty?” This concept
precisely corresponds with the type tree and some of its
properties, simultaneity and relativity, in particular. The
property of relativity requires that “wider loyalty” increases as
the type tree is traversed towards its single root node because of
fewer nodes, while diversity of “thought and habit” increases as
it is traversed towards the leaves because of more nodes and
accumulated attributes. But, simultaneity property precludes
contradiction despite differences between the nodes. Thus, the
concept of unity in diversity, far from being a contradictory
concept, is perfectly consistent and logical.

To take a specific example of unity in diversity, consider the
diversity of teaching, or teachers for that matter. As a root
principle, the purpose of teaching is the transfer of knowledge
to the student with the help of the teacher. Thus, the type tree
representing the principle of teaching starts. Moving down
towards the leaves, the next level of nodes may represent more
specific types of teaching. For example, one node at this level
may represent teaching in a classroom, while another node may
represent teaching by doing, and a third node may represent

teaching via independent study. Each method may be suitable
and selected for a different type of subject, student, or teacher.
And each method is still for the transfer of knowledge to the
student, in compliance with the root principle.

The unity is at the root or towards the upper levels closer to
the root, and the diversity is at the lower levels. In the above
example, the unity aspect is that each type of teaching is united
with others in that they are all a type of teaching and fulfill the
purpose of teaching when appropriately selected. The diversity
aspect is that there are diverse teaching methods at lower levels,
each suitable for a different situation.

Therefore, the selection of a particular method (or node)
depends not only on the attributes inherited from upper nodes,
but also on attributes which differentiate the nodes at the level
under consideration. And even though the nodes within a level
are different and possibly in conflict, there are no conflicts
across levels between parent and child nodes. This is
simultaneity in action.

Cultural Courtesy

Courtesy appears in different, and sometimes contradictory
forms in different cultures. For example, in some oriental
countries burping after eating a meal is considered a sign of
enjoyment of the meal and courtesy or complement to the host,
while in many other cultures it is considered rude to do so.
Bahá’u’lláh says: “O people of God! I admonish you to observe
courtesy, for above all else it is the prince of virtues. Well is it
with him who is illumined with the light of courtesy and is
attired with the vesture of uprightness” [TB 88]. If we define
courtesy as behavior patterns or statements that show respect to
the receiving party, then the principle of courtesy so defined is
modeled as the root of a type tree. According to the relativity
property, behaviors at the lower levels on the type tree become
more specific and each correspond to the various cultures and
attributes associated with respect in those cultures. Further,
according to the simultaneity property, the behaviors
represented by the lower level nodes can be simultaneously

courteous without contradicting the higher levels or root
courtesy principles.

However, sometimes people misinterpret a behavior as
discourteous. There are two sources of errors in type tree that
may cause such misinterpretation: a type one error results if it is
mistakenly assumed that a lower level node is at a higher or root
level, and a type two error results if it is assumed that a higher
level or root node is at a lower level. In this example, a type one
error occurs if courtesy in a particular culture is mistakenly
assumed to be a root principle. Then, behavior from any other
culture that contradicts this behavior is deemed discourteous
because it does not fall under this mistaken root. So, if burping
is considered rude as a matter of fundamental principle, then
regardless of culture one may consider it rude behavior.
Conversely, a type two error occurs if the root principle is
mistakenly assumed to belong to a lower level. So, one may assume
that showing respect is optional when showing courtesy; simply
one of many alternatives. But, courtesy cannot be dissociated
from respect. Respect is an inherent part of any courteous
behavior regardless of other accompanying cultural rituals.

Religious Imitations

“This divinely-purposed delay in the revelation of the basic
laws of God for this age, and the subsequent gradual
implementation of their provisions, illustrate the principle of
progressive revelation which applies, as Bahá’u’lláh Himself
explained, even within the ministry of each Prophet” [SCKA 5].
In the context of type trees, the concept of progressive
revelations, as revealed by Bahá’u’lláh, is an expansion of the
type tree from the root upwards, that is, towards more general
principles. This concept may be made clearer by revisiting the
recursion property and the topology of the tree structure. More
specifically, a root node in a tree, such as the type tree of Figure
3, may be placed at an intermediate node of a bigger tree, Thus,
the old tree becomes a sub-tree. making the old root node an
intermediate node. For example, if the type tree modeling a
particular religion or revelation is attached at the intermediate
root of a bigger tree, then the progressive revelation becomes
the new root node in the bigger tree, with respect to the

particular revelation, which is now a sub-tree. Hence, the
particular revelation is a more specific incarnation of the concept
of progressive revelation, which is applicable to all revelations.

In religions past, various principles targeted specific needs of
the society at the time. For example, in Judaism and Islam there
are restrictions on types of food the faithful can consume. In
contrast, in the Bahá’í Faith, there are substantially no food
restrictions (except for alcoholic drinks) and decisions are left to
the believers mostly based on health criterion, which is a higher
level principle than a principle banning pork products, for example.

Thus, religions fall into dogmatic rituals and imitations by
making a type one error: thinking the principles revealed in their
religions for specific needs of the time belonged to a higher
level in the type tree than the level to which they truly belonged.
So, when they have to switch to other practices which are more
suitable for later times, they fail and continue to adhere to
outdated rituals of older times.

To Be Conservative or Progressive? That’s the Question

A divisive subject, particularly in modern politics, but also in
popular culture and society, the conservative-progressive
dichotomy has convinced many that only one or the other can
be right, never both. This is where we return to the issue of
fashion: is it old-fashioned to be principled, particularly when
the principles were known in some form since older times? To
answer this question, the relativity property must be revisited.
The relativity property provides that the closer to the root a
principle is, the more absolute it is, and thus, the less dependent
it is on various attributes, which attributes in turn define the
situations to which the principle applies. As such, true root
principles are timeless and do not change according to changing
situations over time, or at least are broadly applicable to many
situations. That is, they are not relative with respect to various
situations, but absolute. In other words, principles are by
definition conservative, namely, they are conserved over time
and across different situations.

Moral relativity is sometimes associated with progressive
positions. To explore this aspect, it is helpful to reiterate that

not all principles are created equal. That is, there are principles
at the root of a tree which are absolute in the context of that
tree, and then there are situational principles at lower levels in
the same tree that are relative. Relativity, recall, exists because
at lower levels alternatives exist one of which may be chosen
according to a given situation. As an example, consider again
the moral law of courtesy towards others as the root principle.
This is an absolute principle and does not change relative to
different cultures. However, culture-based manners are principles
corresponding to intermediate or leaf nodes and are relative.

This conclusion precludes the notion of moral relativity when
observing true root principles. Moral relativity is the
embodiment of the type two error in the type tree in which a
root principle is mistakenly assumed to be a lower level
principle and thus relative to situation. When this error occurs,
a root principle that is applicable to all situations is not
observed or is only applied to some. Of course, moral relativity
is a valid and essential concept to understand and apply for
principles corresponding to intermediate or leaf nodes in the
type tree.

Conversely, the application of principles, that is the more
specific principles under the root principle, that are applicable
in particular situations, are relative with respect to the situation
or problem to which they are applied. In this sense, the
application of principles is by definition progressive.

But, according to the simultaneity property, conservative and
progressive incarnations of principles can be simultaneously
true and valid, because they operate on different levels. Hence,
the conservative-progressive dichotomy is a false dichotomy.
One should be, and actually has no other choice than being
conservative when observing root principles, and conversely, he
should be, and has no other choice than being progressive when
observing application of principles in new situations.

Putting It All Together

Employing system and type trees and their properties as
models in the analysis of various problems, systems, concepts,

entities, and principles provides a general methodology for such
analysis, rather than specifically modeling any particular
problem domain. This general applicability creates a powerful
framework for clearly defining problems and issues and devising
approaches and solutions.

One of the most important and widely applicable results of
understanding this methodology is that root principles are not
relative and are thus timeless. There are no “old-fashioned” or
“progressive” principles. Principles are eternal, even though our
understanding of such principles are refined as we grow.
Applications of root principles, however, are relative to
situations and must be adapted accordingly. This relationship
between root principles and their applications is nowhere more
evident in modern life than in the relationship between science
and technology. Scientific principles are timeless while their
applications, namely technology, change with time, needs, and
situations. Newton’s laws of motion propelled fish in
prehistoric oceans, moved horse and buggy 200 years ago, and
sets in motion jet planes and space craft today. The principles
remain unchanged, but new applications are devised as
understanding of the principles is refined.

At this point in human history, Bahá’u’lláh has revealed many
social, moral, and philosophical principles and guidelines that
may be considered as root principles due to their very general
and high level natures. Abdu’l-Bahá, the appointed interpreter
of His Writings, takes these general principles and defines lower
level, more detailed principles for practical application in
various situations. In effect, Abdu’l-Bahá traverses the type tree
towards the leaves, providing more specific application of the
root principles. In observing these principles, the two types of
errors, substituting low level principles for higher level ones and
substituting the higher level principles for lower level ones, are
avoided by observing their relative levels of detail, context, and
application. Making either of these errors may result in
misunderstanding and misguided application of the principles.

For example, if a root principle enunciated by Bahá’u’lláh,
such as leading a chaste life, is mistaken as a lower level
principle applicable only in specific situations, such as within a
culture or during a particular period, then when outside those

specific situations, one will mistakenly assume that this
principle is not applicable any more.

Conversely, if a lower level principle or practice, such as
adopting a particular type of food, attire, or marriage
ceremonies at a particular locality, is taken as a root principle,
then one will mistakenly assume that at all places and all times
such practices must be observed, leading to empty and
inapplicable imitations and rituals.

Conclusion

All analysis, explicitly or implicitly, depend on models, which
represent various concepts and entities by defining elements of
such entities and the inter-relationships between these elements.
The hierarchical model, effectively represented by tree-like
structures, have properties that encompass every entity by
representing intrinsic structural relationships and properties of
the entities, regardless of their specific natures or the fields in
which the entities exist. The system tree has a Specific To
General (STG) structure, while the type tree has a General To
Specific (GTS) structure. The type and system trees provide a
general methodology for the analysis of principles and entities,
rather than providing a specific model for a particular system or
problem. The properties of the type tree are especially
important for principles and clarify the structure of many
difficult and ill-defined problems.

An analysis of the properties of the type tree reveal that root
principles are not relative and are thus timeless. The relativity
and simultaneity properties of the type tree show that there are
no “old-fashioned” or “progressive” principles. Principles are
eternal, but their applications are relative to situations. These
properties also reveal that principles can have different effects
at different levels in the type tree without contradiction. These
properties further show that type one and type two errors,
namely, substituting low level principles for higher level ones
and substituting the higher level principles for lower level ones,
respectively, can cause misguided applications of principles at
all levels.
