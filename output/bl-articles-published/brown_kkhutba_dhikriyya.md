Vahid Brown

While much of the sustained research in the writings of the Báb
in modern scholarship has focused on his earliest writings1, the
works written between 1844 and 1846 continue to present some of
the most serious challenges to analysis and understanding. Aside
from the general problems facing a reader of the Báb’s famously
obscure works, the Báb’s earliest writings are rendered particularly
difficult by an ever-shifting authorial voice. One must constantly
ask in reading these early texts, who is the author, who is addressing
us from the page? The obvious answer of course is, the Báb, Siyyid
‘Ali Mu˙ammad. That this answer doesn’t resolve our problem can
be best indicated by an example. The following two passages are
both drawn from the Báb’s writings from this earliest period:

> Verily, We have bestowed revelation upon you [the Báb]
> just as We bestowed revelation upon Mu˙ammad and the
> Messengers before him, with clear signs, that perchance
> you might be a Proof unto God for the people after the
> [four] gates ... O people of the earth! Stray not from the
> bounds of the word of the Remembrance, and speak not
> concerning Him save by the truth, for the Remembrance
> has not revealed his verses but by the truth.2
> I have not claimed a single word of revelation. They say,
> “He has laid claim to spiritual authority and its trappings.”
> May God kill them for that in which they lie! I have neither
> made claims to nor spoken a word with regard to anything
> other than servitude ... The Remnant of God, the Lord of
> the Age, has, after the four gates, no designated gate and
> no specific deputy ... Verily, revelation from Thy presence,
> the like of which was sent down upon Mu˙ammad, was
> closed and ended with him.3

These excerpts are both from the pen of the Báb, though
ironically neither is in the authorial voice of “the Báb.” The first is
from the Qayyúm al-Asma`, written in 1844, and the authorial voice
is that of God. The second is from the Du’a-yi alif, written in 1845,
and is in the voice of a pious Shi’i siyyid of Shiraz. The problem that
these two texts exemplify is an acute one — the problem of taqiyya.

48 Autobibliography in the Writings of the Báb

In its most well-known sense, taqiyya means the dissimulation of
belief for reasons of self-preservation, but it has in Shi’ism a much
broader range of meaning. From the many injunctions to practice
taqiyya found in the recorded sayings of the Imams, it becomes clear
that taqiyya was not simply a negative obligation not to put oneself
in harm’s way, but was also a positive duty to conceal secrets.
Regarding the nature of these secrets, one scholar of Shi’ism put it
this way:

> In the corpus of the Imams, certain subjects appear to
> constitute the main objects of taqiyya: information relating
> to the ‘Qur’an of the imams,’ the [pious hatred] toward
> the Companions of the Prophet and in particular toward
> the first three caliphs, or the identity of the Qa’im ... 4
Two of the three primary objects of taqiyya given in this list have
to do with Shi’i messianism — the Qur’an of the Imams and the
identity of the Qa’im. Taqiyya then was a Shi’i religious obligation,
was concerned with the concealment of secrets, and, more
importantly, such secrets were often of an eschatological nature.

It is important to understand taqiyya in this wider sense and not
just as dissimulation or self-preserving denial. When understood as a
technique of arcanization, as concealment of secrets, we are able to
discern taqiyya in the early writings of the Báb as operating at a
variety of levels and layers. It is not simply that these earliest
writings present two stark extremes of declaration and denial of
messianism, as in the passages from the Qayyúm al-Asma` and the
Du’a-yi alif cited above. Rather, there exists in these earliest works a
range of revelation and concealment, a spectrum that extends from
the open directness of the Qayyúm al-Asma`, to the opaque
covering of the Du’a-yi alif, and includes in between a variety of
shades of coding, allusiveness, and encryption of the messianic
secret. And, what is perhaps most important for our present-day
attempts to understand these texts, this spectrum of taqiyya isn’t
solely involved in claims or denials of a messianic station, but rather
extends to the Báb’s communication of personal belief and
statements of doctrine. For example, the Báb in some texts expresses
views of the Imams that He contradicts in other works, or states
belief in certain orthodox usuli-Shi’i tenets that He elsewhere
completely rejects. It is thus imperative that we make some attempt
to crack the Báb’s taqiyya code, to read between the lines of His
esoteric writing, if we are to have any hope of success in
understanding what the Báb thought — what, in other words, Bábí
doctrine really was.

The three autobibliographical works that I will discuss here — the
Khutba al-Jidda, the Kitáb al-Fihrist, and the Khutba dhikriyya — are

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 49

indices of this spectrum, and they provide a window into the
chronology of the Báb’s practice of taqiyya during this period. I
refer to the three texts in question as “autobibliographies” for the
simple reason that they all share the characteristic of including lists
by the Báb of works He had previously written. Autobibliography is
a well-established genre in Islamic letters, and has traditionally been
employed for a variety of reasons. In the Báb’s milieu of 19th-
century Shi’ism, autobibliographies were generally written by
established scholars and are perhaps best understood as having the
combined function of a curriculum vitae and a course syllabus; they
indicated the areas of learning that a given scholar had covered or
specialized in and, to use the language of the modern academy,
provided students with a list of courses that they could seek a degree
in.

While one might be tempted to understand the Báb’s
autobibliographical works against this scholastic background, there
are a number of factors that would point to the inadequacy of such
a view. For one thing, Shi’i scholars were not generally in the habit
of describing their own works as divine revelations. As with the
Báb’s Qur’an commentaries, the Báb’s autobibliographies are
radically different from previous works in the genre in that they are
bound up with His claims to be the Shi’i messiah. When there is
light to be shed on these works from the Shi’i textual tradition, it is
to be found not in the curriculum vitae of hadith scholars, but
rather in the apocalyptic imaginary, the culturally-shared body of
images and ideas associated with the coming of the Promised One.
As we go through the three texts, I will highlight the Báb’s
utilization of this “imaginary of the end” in signaling — sometimes
directly, sometimes obliquely — His messianic authorial voice.

The earliest of the three works is the Khutba al-Jidda, written
during the Báb’s return-journey from the pilgrimage during the late-
winter or early-spring of 1845. The Báb was in Jidda for only a few
days, from February 24th to March 4th, at which point He sailed from
Jidda for Bushihr. We know these precise dates because they are
given by the Báb Himself in the Khutba al-Jidda. Further, since the
last date He gives there is March 4th (24th of Safar), this provides a
terminus post quem for the Khutba itself. It seems most likely that it
was written aboard ship soon after sailing from Jidda, though Abu’l-
Qasim Afnan has noted that in one extant manuscript of the
Khutba revealed in Jidda, the scribe headed it “Khutba fi Bushihr
from His Holiness the Báb.”5 It is indeed possible that the Khutba
al-Jidda was written in Bushihr — i.e. in mid-May or late-June of
1845 — though the terminus ante quem for composition is June 21st,
1845, the date of composition for the Kitáb al-Fihrist, since the
Khutba al-Jidda is listed in the Kitáb al-Fihrist. I am sceptical of a

50 Autobibliography in the Writings of the Báb

later, Bushihr dating of the Khutba al-Jidda because of the absence
of any mention of the length of the journey by ship, the length of
stay at port in Bushihr, or of disembarking at Bushihr, whereas the
Báb goes into minute detail throughout the Khutba al-Jidda into all
of the earlier stages of His pilgrimage journey. If He had already
arrived at Bushihr when composing it, why give so much
chronological detail about His trip and yet leave off the details
regarding these final legs of the journey? Fortunately, Dr. Stephen
Lambden is currently working on this text, so I will leave the
resolution of these thorny matters to his able hands.6

The Khutba al-Jidda is a short work, just thirteen pages long in
the manuscript collection INBA 91.7 It begins with a page and a half
of cosmogonic narrative — a style of exordium common to many of
the works of the Báb during this period — describing the creation of
the cosmos and its metaphysical structure in terms of a set of
quaternities standard to Shaykhism and ubiquitous in the Báb’s
Writings throughout His ministry. The Báb then launches into a
brief polemic against Ishraqi philosophical theology, mentioning by
name one of the works of Mulla Sadra Shirazi, and stating that the
Ishraqis have gone astray in their particular views on the quaternality
of being and the status of the names and attributes of God. The Báb
then extends His critique to include those ‘ulama who have taken a
favorable view of Ishraqi thought. There follows a brief transition
to the next major section of the text — a detailed recounting of his
pilgrimage journey — and here the Báb shifts to a more directly
messianic register. Thus, for example, He writes:

> This is the light that hath borne the letter ha` through the
> land of the innermost heart, and hath gone forth from the
> bounds of the letter waw through the pen of God’s
> Remembrance, to whom hath been revealed verses in the
> language of God, the Speaker, as divine proofs, that all
> people might realize the limitedness of their drink and
> recognize the true meaning ordained in this pearl-white
> water.8
The Báb then describes His pilgrimage journey, and the messianic
overtones continue strongly throughout this section of the Khutba.
The action throughout this section is ascribed to God rather than the
Báb. Thus, this portion of the Khutba begins, “Praise be to God ...
who hath dispatched the Word of His servant from the land of his
birth ...”, and the text continues in this vein for another four and a
half pages, naming the points on His journey to and from Mecca
and providing the dates of each stage of this journey in extremely
indirect language. Towards the end of this itinerary, the Báb writes:

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 51

> So praised be God, the One, the Self-Subsisting, the Single,
> the Worshipped, Who hath spoken in praise of His
> Remembrance and the days of his journey, and hath made
> mention of the path of his ascent in visitation of the
> manifestations of His power, Mu˙ammad and his family,
> that all might learn the meaning of destiny and the secret
> thereof through the knowledge of the days of his ascent,
> and from the knowledge of the days of his journey might
> proceed to the inner meaning of the Throne and the
> Footstool, and make that holiest of journeys into the
> concourse of Names and Attributes, until all people might
> enter the blessed House of God by the exalted verses sent
> down in this pearl-white tablet and prostrate themselves at
> the place of prostration as they did the first time ... So
> praised be He Who hath ordained in the path of these
> journeys what He had ordained for all of the Gates
> aforetime.9
This passage clearly states, among other things, that the Khutba
al-Jidda is a work of divine revelation (tanzil), that contemplation of
the Báb’s doings can provide the reader with various forms of
cosmological gnosis, and that the Báb Himself is in some way
equivalent to the Gates of the Hidden Imam.

The remainder of the Khutba is devoted to a listing of the works
of the Báb that were stolen from Him during his journey from
Mecca to Medina. More than a dozen individual works appear to be
listed, but there is some ambiguity here, since some of what he
writes may not be in regards to individual works but rather meant to
characterize His writings in general. A number of specific works are
named, however, and most of these were listed again in the Báb’s
Kitáb al-Fihrist, written less than four months later. The first item
listed — if indeed it is an item per se — is rather representative of the
list as a whole. The Báb writes:

> Among that which was stolen are verses regarding the inner
> mysteries of the writing that hath been inscribed by the
> hand of the Remembrance in red ink upon eleven pearl-
> white leaves, gilded with liquid gold, and lined about in
> red, concerning the knowledge of two parts of the hidden
> secret manifest through the greatest secret, the true
> meaning of the inner mysteries of the Qur’an [batin al-
> qur’an]. These verses are such as no one aforetime has
> touched upon, nor shall any hereafter encompass them in
> knowledge.
One of the most interesting features of this list is that the Báb
describes almost every item on the list as being concerned with the

52 Autobibliography in the Writings of the Báb

batin al-qur’an, the esoteric meaning of the Qur’an, or even of the
batin at-ta`wil, the inner meaning of the esoteric interpretation of
the Qur’an. His language of “secrets” and “concealed secrets” makes
constant allusion to a saying ascribed to the Sixth Imam, Ja’far al-
Sadiq, which says, in a form quoted by the Báb in His first
commentary on the letter ha‘: “Our cause is a secret, a secret
concealed by a secret, a secret veiled within a secret, a secret that
cannot be known save by means of a secret.”10

If we return to our original problem, the problem of taqiyya, we
might ask how much does this Khutba reveal and how much does it
conceal? This text is a far cry from the “verily, verily, I am God” of
the Báb’s latest works, but on the other hand there is nothing here in
the way of outright dissimulation. The Báb here openly describes His
works as revelation and compares Himself to the Gates of the Imam,
but the real messianic punch of this Khutba is communicated only
between the lines, in an esoteric manner, and is necessarily selective
in the readership to whom it will reveal its secret. That ideal
readership is the Shaykhi community, in whose language the Báb
expresses Himself throughout this text, and in terms of whose
apocalyptic imaginary the Báb encodes his messianic declaration.

As I said before, the Báb opens this work with a cosmogonic
narrative that is markedly Shaykhi in its terminology and symbolism,
discussing cosmic reality in terms of a symbolic system of
quaternities that was first codified, as it were, in the writings of
Shaykh Ahmad. It then proceeds to a polemic against Ishraqi
philosophy, mentioning by name the Kitáb al-Masha’ir by Mulla
Sadra, a book against which Shaykh Ahmad penned a gigantic,
refutation-style “commentary.” At the end of that polemic, after
remarking that most of the ‘ulama have sided with the Ishraqis, the
Báb mentions that this state of affairs had continued up until His
own time, when suddenly there had dawned the twin lights of the
luminescent sun and moon — a reference, I believe, to Shaykh
Ahmad and Siyyid Kazim. The Báb then writes:

> People of late carried out a campaign of lies against those
> two luminaries in contradiction to what is encompassed in
> the knowledge of the Creator, just as the people of old had
> calumniated against the Friends of God [the Imams],
> without certain knowledge and having no clear book. Thus
> it went until the letter Kaf returned (raja’a) to the place [of
> the appearance] of the Cause, in the region of God’s
> command, and the cycles of time came full circle to the
> Day of God, in a new and wondrous mode, and the lights
> that had been an inaccessible mystery dawned forth with
> knowledge of the divine cloud of unknowing, and the
Siniatic Tree was made to speak forth upon the ocean of

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 53

> praise, and the word of glorification was made manifest
> upon the crimson earth.11
One would have to have been an avid reader of Siyyid Kazim to
be able to decode this messianic declaration, for in writing here of
the return of the letter Kaf, the Báb is alluding to a prophecy made
in Kazim’s Sharh al-Qasida that the name of the Qa’im will be
numerically equal to double the value of the letter kaf when
pronounced. The abjad value of the pronounced kaf, or kaf, alif, fa,
is 101, so the doubled value is 202. The abjad value of ‘Ali
Mu˙ammad is — 202. The Báb also refers to Himself elsewhere as
this letter Kaf, and Tahirih would later point out that this specific
prophecy of Siyyid Kazim was fulfilled by the Báb.12

The list of the stolen works at the end of the Khutba al-Jidda
provides a similar instance of this encoding of the Báb’s messianic
declaration in language that would likely only be decipherable to
Shaykhi initiates. In terms very similar to earlier Isma’ilism, the
Shaykhis had developed an elaborate theory of the cycles of spiritual
history that centered on a notion of a dialectic between the zahir and
the batin, the manifest and the hidden. According to this cyclical
theory, Mu˙ammad and the Qur’an initiated a cycle of the zahir, the
outward, and so during Mu˙ammad’s prophetic cycle the zahir of
the Qur’an was in force. According to all of the Shaykhi writers,
including the anti-Bábí Karim Khan Kirmani, the cycle of the batin
began in the year 1200, and would witness the coming of the Qa’im,
who would initiate a spiritual cycle under the sign of the batin al-
qur’an.13 As I noted above, the Báb refers to nearly all of the works
in the list given at the end of the Khutba al-Jidda as being verses of
the batin al-qur’an. Also, He begins the recounting of His
pilgrimage itinerary by dating it as “the year after the year 1200,”
without further specifying the date. Taken together with the earlier
reference to the cycles of time having come full circle, and in the
hands of an attentive Shaykhi reader, these references to the
revelation of the batin al-qur’an in the thirteenth century would
signal the Báb’s claims to be the messiah. The Báb, then, has hidden
the secret in plain sight, visible only to those who know what they’re
looking at.

I move now to the Kitáb al-Fihrist, a work clearly dated to the
15th of Jumadi ath-thani, 1261, or June 21st, 1845. This work is
extremely valuable in that it provides lengthy lists of works that the
Báb had produced up to that time, including dozens of books,
commentaries, letters, khutbas, and prayers. Like the Khutba al-
Jidda, it also encodes the Báb’s messianic claims, though the Báb in
this text approaches the balancing act of revelation and concealment
with altogether different methods. It is not markedly Shaykhi in its
language or symbolism, but appears to assume a wider audience. It

54 Autobibliography in the Writings of the Báb

evokes the Qur’an at the beginning by opening with a series of
disconnected Arabic letters. The Báb had earlier affixed
disconnected letters to the surahs of the Qayyúm al-Asma` and the
Kitáb ar-Ruh, the two most explicitly messianic texts written by the
Báb during the earliest period of his ministry.

In contrast to the Khutba al-Jidda, where the Báb describes His
works as verses sent down by God, at the beginning of the Kitáb al-
Fihrist the Báb states that it was sent down from the Baqiyyat Allah,
the Remnant of God, a title given to the Hidden Imam. The Báb
states that He is Himself a servant of the Remnant of God, and He
then proceeds to testify to His belief in Mu˙ammad, the twelve
Imams, Fatima, and the four Gates of the twelfth Imam. He then
proceeds for several pages to describe His writings as verses sent
down to Him from the Remnant of God, refers to Himself
consistently as a servant of God and the Remnant of God, though all
the while indicating that His own works technically constitute
revelation, writing, for example, that “the reading of these verses in
these, the days of God, is more excellent than all the deeds recorded
in the Book of God.” He states that His revealed works will endure
until the day of Resurrection, which to a Shaykhi audience meant
until the arising of the Qa’im. In any case, the whole of this
introduction serves to simultaneously reveal and conceal the Báb’s
claims. He clearly is claiming to be capable of producing inspired
verses, but by saying that these verses are sent down from the
Hidden Imam He is distancing himself from any identification with
that Messianic figure, even implying that He is waiting, just like all
other orthodox Shi’a, the Messiah’s future appearance.

At this point in the text, the Báb takes a most fascinating
approach to concealing His revealed secret. He cites a handful of
lengthy traditions, all of which, in one way or another, indicate the
possibility for post-Qur’anic revelation. I provide below a
translation of this lengthy section of the Kitáb al-Fihrist:

> Verily, all that has been revealed by the hand of the
> Remembrance will remain in force until the Day of
> Resurrection, and the decree of God will suffer no
> alteration — unto Him do all return! Say: I, verily, have laid
> claim to no Cause other than that whose reality has been
> revealed in the tradition [al-hadith]. Would that you might
> read these traditions, that haply you would be of those who
> have attained certitude in the verses of God!
> God said (exalted be He), in a sacred tradition: My servant
> ceases not from drawing nigh unto me through
> supererogatory acts of worship until I love him, and when I
love Him I become the ear with which he hears, the vision

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 55

by which he sees, the tongue wherewith he speaks, and the
hand by which he strikes. If he beseeches Me, I will answer
his prayer, and if he asks of Me, I will grant him his
request. Even if he holds his peace, I will then take the
initiative [and answer his unspoken prayer].
He [an Imam] (upon him be peace) said: One who loves us
and only grows in his love for us, who devotes himself to
our knowledge and asks about certain matters from us and
not others –the heart of such a one we inspire with the
answers to those matters about which he asked.
In al-Kafi14 [it is related that] a Christian monk asked
about certain things from Musa ibn Ja’far (upon him and
his father be peace), saying: “Teach me about the eight
letters that were revealed, four of which were made known
on earth and four of which remained in heaven. To whom
were these latter four revealed, and who will interpret their
meaning?” Musa replied, “The one about whom you ask is
none other than he who will arise from among us
[qa’imunaa]. God will reveal these unto him and he will
interpret their meaning. God will reveal to him what has
not been revealed to any of the truthful ones, the
messengers, nor the rightly-guided.” Then the monk said,
“Teach me about two of the four letters that were made
known in this world. What are they?” Musa replied, “I will
tell you about all four of them. The first of them is ‘there
is no god but God, His unity eternally without peer.’ The
second of them is ‘Mu˙ammad is the Righteous Messenger
of God (the blessings of God and His peace be upon him
and his family).’ The third is ‘We are the People of the
Household.’ The fourth is ‘Our partisans (shi’a) are from
Us, and We are from the Messenger of God (the blessings
of God be upon him and his family), and the Messenger of
God (blessings) is from God (but by way of intermediate
causes).’”
In al-Kafi [it is related] from Abi ‘Abd Allah (upon whom
be peace), who said: Verily, God, exalted and glorified is
He, created a name with letters that are unutterable, with a
pronunciation that cannot be voiced, with an individuality
that is not corporeal, of a likeness that cannot be described,
and with color that has no hue. It transcends measurement
and delimitation, and is veiled from the senses of all
possessors of sense. It is hidden without being concealed.
He made it to be a word perfected by the joining of four
parts, yet not one letter thereof comes before any of the
others. He manifested from it three names, since creation

> depended on these latter names. He veiled one of them,
> and that is the hidden, treasured name. The outer form of
> these names that have been manifested is “God,” “Blessed”
> and “Exalted.” And He, praised be He, gave to the service
> of each of these names four pillars, making twelve pillars
> in all. Then for each pillar He created thirty names, names
> which are related to them.
> The Merciful, the Compassionate, the King, the Holy One,
> the Creator, the Fashioner, the Former, the Living, the
> Self-Subsisting, Whom neither weariness nor sleep
> overtake, the Knower, the All-Informed, the Hearing, the
> Perceiving, the Wise, the Almighty, the All-Compelling,
> the Most Great, the Exalted, the Mighty, the All-Powerful,
> the Omnipotent ... [lists 35 names in all, with one repeat]
> These names and the names that (make up) the Most
> Beautiful Names comprise three hundred and sixty names
> and are related to these three names. These three names are
> pillars and He concealed the single, hidden, treasured name
> by these three names, even as He, exalted is He, says: “Say:
> Call upon God or call upon the Merciful. By whatsoever
> name you call Him, His are the Most Beautiful Names.”
> (Q17:110)
> Those who claim, however, to have met the Proof of God,
> such as they are none but liars! Say: this, My Path, is the like
> of what has been set forth in the above traditions, and my
> inner heart lied not about what it saw... (cf. Q53:12).15
The Báb prefaces this brief compilation of traditions, as you can
see, by saying that He has claimed no Cause other than in accordance
with these traditions. The first two traditions describe modes of
extra-Qur’anic revelation or inspiration, the third alludes to secrets
that the Qa’im will reveal, and the last describes the hidden name of
God, the revelation of which is frequently associated in Shi’i
apocalyptic literature with the messiah. Nowhere in this text, then,
does the Báb state that He is the Qa’im, but He leaves wide open
for the reader the option of drawing that conclusion. Once again,
He’s hidden the messianic secret in plain sight.

The last text to be considered, written in January of 1846, is the
Báb’s Khutba dhikriyya, a text about which there has been
considerable confusion among Western scholars with regard to its
title, though there isn’t space here to go into those perplexities.16
The Báb begins the work with a very brief cosmogonic exordium,
and then proceeds to a lengthy creedal statement. He first affirms
the unity and absolute unknowability of God, and then goes through
a series of doxological statements, testifying to His belief in

Mu˙ammad, the Imams, Fatima, and so forth. The Báb refers to the
coming of the Qa’im in the future tense, certainly giving no
indication here of His identification with that figure. He states that
He believes in the standard dogmas of the Shi’i faith in a perfectly
orthodox manner — “just as the people have believed concerning it,”
as He says. We know from other works of the Báb that He did not,
in fact, believe in these dogmas “just as the people did,” and much
of the first wahid of the Persian Bayán is devoted to spelling out the
Báb’s radical interpretations of things like resurrection and so forth.

In contrast with the Khutba al-Jidda and the Kitáb al-Fihrist,
there is really nothing in the way of a direct indication of the Báb’s
claims in this text. The only hint to these claims is given in the list of
works at the end, and here again the Báb draws from the symbolism
of the apocalyptic imaginary to communicate this allusion. The Báb
writes:

> I testify that everything set forth in this book is the truth,
> by the grace of God, the Exalted, though many of mankind
> are of the ungrateful. Indeed, there is delineated in this
> book all that went forth from my hands from the year
> 1260 unto the middle of the [first?] month of the year
> 1262. These consist of four perfect books and ten
> masterful epistles, each one of which is a sufficient proof
> for leading all who dwell in the heavens and on earth unto
> a station of servitude. Thus I now mention their names by
> the names of the members of the Family of God, who are
> their revealers, that these texts may be canonical within the
> realm of exposition and honored with divine titles in the
> domain of conclusive proof.17
Following this, the Báb lists fourteen works — the number of the
Shi’i Holy Family — and renames each work after a member of this
family. That the purpose of this list is primarily symbolic is indicated
towards the end. The eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth works do not
correspond to any actual works of the Báb, and serve here to fill out
the list and underscore the repetition of the sacred number.

In comparison with the other two texts that I have discussed, the
Khutba dhikriyya is the most obvious in its practice of taqiyya. It
conceals much more than it reveals, but it does reveal something.
For one thing, like the Kitáb al-Fihrist, it serves as an index to other
works of the Báb, works in which He is quite explicit about his
claims. But more importantly there is the symbolic nature of the list
itself, and the renaming of His works here as the ‘Alid Book, the
suhuf of the Imams and so forth. One of the central elements of
Shi’i apocalypticism is the belief that the Hidden Imam is in
possession of secret books and suhuf. According to these traditions,

Mu˙ammad was given suhuf containing the true revelations that
had been sent down to all of the previous prophets, and He passed
these on to the succession of the Imams. Among them was the
Sahifat Adam, the suhuf Ibrahim wa Musa, etc. There is also the
Kitáb ‘Ali, said to contain a detailed list of all possible rulings of
Islamic law, which when revealed would obviate the need for all
disputation and legal interpretation in determining the rules of the
Shar’iah. Descriptions of these messianic kutub and suhuf are
scattered across dozens of traditions, and in many of them number
symbolism has a prominent role. That the Báb considered His own
writings in relation to these hidden books is made plain by more or
less direct references to them in the Qayyúm al-Asma`.18 Beliefs
regarding these books were even drawn upon by Bahá’u’lláh in
communicating His own claims, inasmuch as the Hidden Words
were originally given out as the mushaf fatima, one of the hidden
books in the possession of the Hidden Imam.

In looking at these three works of the Báb, we have seen that the
practice of taqiyya in this early period meant more than simply
directly denying messianic claims, and was more often a technique of
esoteric communication. Given the right readership, with initiation
or familiarity with the right body of apocalyptic lore, the Báb was
able in these works to simultaneously reveal and conceal His
messianic claims, to set forth, in the words of Ja’far al-Sadiq, “a
secret concealed by a secret, a secret veiled within a secret, a secret
that cannot be known save by means of a secret.”

attributed to Him.
I testify unto God in this book according to what God hath
testified of Himself, by Himself, without any need of the
testimony of the foremost in knowledge among His
servants, that verily there is no God save Him, Who hath
existed from everlasting without the mention of any thing,
and is now the Existing One as He hath ever been, with
nothing with him. Immeasurably exalted is His Essence
above the depiction of the realm of construction and its
inhabitants. Supremely magnified is His Self above the
description of the realm of origination32 and whatever is
like unto it, glorified be He!
The realm of origination is cut off from His existential
reality, as is the realm of fashioning33 from His inner
identity. Whoever says, “He is He” hath truly lost Him, for
none may find Him other than He Himself, and He hath
no attribute other than His Essence, no name other than
His glory.34 And whoever declares His unity hath indeed
denied Him, for nothing recognizes Him and no servant
comprehends Him. The world of names is cut off from the
world of the divine cloud by [the interposition of] His
realm of omnipotence, and the world of attributes is
inaccessibly removed from the imaginal world by [the
interposition of] His sovereign Kingdom.35 He hath from
time immemorial been the Lord, with none as objects of
His Lordship, the Knower without objects of knowledge,
the Almighty without objects of His might, the Creator
without any creatures, and He is now as He hath ever
been.36 There is for Him no name, no description, no
depiction, and no designation. All things are entirely cut
off from His Essence, as are all entirely severed from His
existential reality. He cannot be mentioned in terms of
separation, nor can He be spoken of in terms of union.
Whoever says “He is the True One” depends in this matter
[of so designating Him] upon the creation. And whoever
says “He is the Just,” nevertheless fails to give His justice
any description, glorified and exalted be He. The act of
origination37 hath been brought into being by means of the
act of construction itself, without a touch of the fire of
God’s Essence. The Will was fashioned by the act of
origination, without any division of God’s own Self. Verily,
the originated is barred from recognizing the act of
origination, while the fashioned realm is severed from His

love by its mere fashioned station. Glorified and exalted be
He, for whom no praise can be mentioned — not by
negation, nor assertion, nor praise, nor signs, nor glory, nor
indications, nor by mention of [the letter] há`, nor by
flight from wáw, nor arising between the two affairs, nor
by the letter lá’ 38. Glorified and exalted be He above what
is attributed to Him.
I testify unto Mu˙ammad (blessings ... ) according to what
God Himself hath testified concerning him, wherein none
have knowledge save Him. He hath fashioned him for the
magnification of His Essence, hath chosen him for the
holiness of his honor, and hath made him, among his
people, unique in beauty, that he be established upon the
station of “no vision taketh in Him, but He taketh in all
vision. He is the Subtile, the All-Perceiving.” I testify that
Mu˙ammad ibn ‘Abd Alláh is His messenger, who hath
transmitted that which he bore of God’s cause and held
fast with his own hands to carrying out the Divine Decree,
glorified and exalted be He. God hath warned you all lest
anyone speak concerning him other than what God hath
Himself determined for him. Glorified and exalted be He
above what is associated with Him.
I testify that the vicegerents of Mu˙ammad — the blessings
of God be upon him and his family — are twelve souls
[inscribed] in the Book of God on that day when no letter
save them had been created, just as God hath testified of
them in the grandeur of His omnipotent realm, the holiness
of the world of His divinity, the magnificence of the
expanse His majesty, and the loftiness of the kingdom His
everlasting bounty, of which none has knowledge save
Him. I bear witness that they have transmitted what they
bore from the bequest of the messenger of God — the
blessings of God be upon him and his family — and that
they are truly the triumphant, with whom it shall be well. I
testify that he who will arise from among them 39 — the
salutations of God be upon him — is alive, that by him God
hath raised up all things, that to him God will extend all
things, and that by him He will unite all things. I testify
that his return is the truth, as is the return of all [of the
vicegerents]. Verily, God will give new life to the earth by
his manifestation, and he will utterly confound the works
of those who join partners with God.
I testify that Fá†ima, the daughter of the messenger of
God — the blessings of God be upon him and his family —
is a blessed leaf from the snow-white tree of “No god is

there but God,” glorified and exalted be He above what is
associated with Him.
I testify unto the truth of all things unto which God hath
testified in His hidden knowledge, and in the same manner
do I testify unto the falsity of falsehood. Verily, I am a
servant of God, a believer in Him, His verses, and His
book, the Discrimination40 — the like of which there hath
never been — and in the love of all that which is most
beloved of Him and the rejection of all that which is most
despised by Him. Sufficient as a witness is God, the
Exalted. I testify unto [the reality of] death, and of the
questioning [in the grave], and of the resurrection, and of
the reckoning, and of the raising of the bodies of the dead,
and unto whatever God hath established, beyond these, in
His knowledge, just as the people have believed concerning
it.
I testify that everything set forth in this book is the truth,
by the grace of God, the Exalted, though many of mankind
are of the ungrateful. Indeed, there is delineated in this
book all that went forth from my hands from the year
1260 unto the middle of the [first?] month of the year
1262\. These consist of four perfect books and ten
masterful epistles, each one of which is a sufficient proof
for leading all who dwell in the heavens and on earth unto
a station of servitude. Thus I now mention their names by
the names of the members of the Family of God, who are
their revealers, that these texts may be canonical within the
realm of exposition and honored with divine titles in the
domain of conclusive proof.
First is the A˙madian Book, in elucidation of the first
thirtieth of the Qur’án and in commentary on the Surah of
Praise.41
Second is the ‘Alawian Book, divided into seven hundred
perfect surahs, each of which is of seven verses.42
Third is the Óasanian Book, divided into fifty books of
irresistible verses.
Fourth is the Óusaynian Book, in elucidation of the Surah
of Joseph — upon whom be peace — arranged in one
hundred and eleven surahs of forty-two verses, each one of
which is a sufficient proof unto whomsoever is on the
earth and whatsoever is beneath the throne, should it not
suffer any alteration. Sufficient is God as a witness.43

Fifth is the Fá†imid Epistle, comprising fourteen chapters
on the acts [of worship related to] the twelve months in
the Book of God.44
Sixth is the ‘Alawian Epistle, comprising fourteen prayers
in answer to ninety-two questions, composed during the
month of fasting, after my return from the pilgrimage.
Seventh is the Báqirian Epistle, comprising fourteen
chapters in commentary on the letters of the “bismallah.”45
Eighth is the Ja’farian Epistle, comprising fourteen
chapters in elucidation of [Ja’far’s] prayer — upon him be
peace — for the days of the Occultation.46
Ninth is the Músawian Epistle, comprising fourteen
chapters in answer to two souls from among the servants
of God, provided [in answer to them] in the land of the
Two Holy Sanctuaries.47
Tenth is the Ri∂áwian Epistle, comprising fourteen
chapters concerning the recitation of fourteen sermons —
which are the very height of eloquence — from the tree of
the laudation, “No god is there save Him, the All-Glorious,
the Beneficent.”48
Eleventh is the Jawádian Epistle, comprising fourteen
chapters in answer to fourteen questions concerning the
realm of Divinity [lahut].
Twelfth is the Hádian Epistle, comprising fourteen
chapters in answer to fourteen questions concerning the
Dominion of Power [jabarut].
Thirteenth is the ‘Askarian Epistle, comprising fourteen
chapters in answer to fourteen questions concerning the
Kingdom [malakut].
Fourteenth is the Hujjatian Epistle, comprised of fourteen
holy prayers which were revealed at the beginning of this
Cause and are related to the Imam of Justice.49
All fourteen of these holy texts are present in this book,
along with — at the end of the text — that illustrious epistle
regarding the fourteen books of the Imáms.50 All of these
are inscribed in this book. Regarding that which went forth
from my hand and was stolen while [I was] on the path of
pilgrimage, a detailed account thereof hath been made in
the Ri∂áwian Epistle. It is incumbent upon whomsoever
may find any of those [stolen texts] to carefully preserve
them. Happy is he who preserves all that hath been sent

> down from my presence in exquisite tablets with the finest
> of handwriting. And [I testify] by Him who hath honored
> me with His verses that a single letter thereof is more
> glorious in My sight than the kingdoms of this world and
> the next — may God forgive me for such a comparison.
> And glorified be God, Lord of the Worlds, above what
> they attribute to Him. And peace be upon His messengers,
> and praise be to God, the Lord of all the Worlds.

\[7\] INBA stands for Iranian National Bahá’í Archives, a series of just
over a hundred book-length collections of manuscripts that were
photoreproduced and distributed in an extremely limited fashion
during the latter half of the twentieth century, partly to avoid the
irrevocable loss of this material at the hands of Iranian authorities
committed to the complete destruction of the Bahá’í community.
Some authors (e.g. D. MacEoin, S. Lambden), refer to these volumes
with the acronym INBMC, and reserve INBA as an acronym
preceding individually-numbered mss. once housed in the Iranian
Bahá’í National Spiritual Assembly’s archives, a discrete collection
which no longer exists due to the destruction of Bahá’í institutions
and the murder of the entire membership of the National Spiritual
Assembly following the Iranian Revolution in 1979. See
http://bahai-library.com/?file=rabbani_inba_index .

\[8\] INBA 91, p. 65. The symbolism in this passage is bound up with the
Báb’s quaternities: ha`, innermost heart, verses, and the color white are
the highest terms in their respective quaternities, and all are related to
divinity.

\[9\] INBA 91, pp. 68f.

\[10\] amrunaa huwa al-sirr wa mustasirr bi’l-sirr wa sirr muqanna’ bi’l-sirr
wa sirr la yufiidahu ila ‘l-sirr, cited by the Báb in INBA 67, p. 23. This
tradition is often quoted by Shaykh Ahmad and frequently alluded to by
the Bab. There are several variants of this tradition; see, for example,
those given in Amir-Moezzi, Divine Guide, p. 231n. 687.

upon the Princeton MS. (Bábí Collection of William McElwee Miller,
vol. 4, ff. 1a-6a.

\[16\] For a summary of the issue up to the period of MacEoin’s
bibliographic labors, see Appendix Four in his Sources, p. 207.
MacEoin’s conclusions there are incorrect; the text in fact is the
khutba dhikriyya, and has no relationship whatsoever with the Risala-yi
dhahabiyya, other than the fact that Nicolas mistakenly referred to this
text by that name.

\[17\] Translated from a typewritten copy of a single ms., with handwritten

\[18\] MacEoin writes (From Shaykhism, p. 159):

> Al-jami’a, Al-jabr, the complete Qur’an, and the previous
> scriptures — and of the Qur’an itself.

\[19\] See Browne, Descriptive Catalogue , p. 68, where he calls this the
Sahifa-i-Ridawiyya. For a full discussion of the various confusions
regarding this tablet and its title, see MacEoin, Sources for Early Bábí
Doctrine and History, p. 207. I do not agree with MacEoin that this
work should be titled “Risala-yi dhahabiyya,” but this issue cannot be
dealt with here. See also A.Q. Afnan, Ahd-i ‘Ala, pp. 437f. and 473f. n. 2.

\[20\] Here and throughout this text, “epistle” translates sahífih.

\[21\] “Sermon” renders khutbih.

\[22\] Here and throughout this text, the Báb refers to the Sahífih al-
Ridáwiyyih as dhálik al-kitáb , or literally “that book.” Since this text is
itself one of the sections of that Sahífih, this phrase will be rendered
here as “this book.”

\[23\] sirr al-inshá`

\[24\] Cf. Qur’án 11:7: “And it is He Who hath created the heavens and the
earth in six days, and His throne was upon the waters.”
See also GWB 46:

In the Báb’s Ziyára jámi’a kabíra, He says of the Imáms:

> I swear by my father and mother, and by whatsoever is in the

> but by your name[s]; that the Throne was set upon the waters by

alchemy. For example, Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsa’i uses the term in this
sense in Jawahir al-Kalam, vol. 2, p. 258.

\[29\] Compare this passage with the Tafsír súrat al-hamd, INBA69, p. 123.

Also relevant to this passage is the Báb’s letter in answer to questions
about alteration of the divine will (badá’) and the Preserved Tablet
(lawh al-mahfúz) in INBA67, pp. 172-76.

\[30\] I.e., the Qur’an.

\[31\] wahí

\[32\] ibdá’

\[33\] ikhtirá`

\[34\] bahá`

\[35\] There appears to be a hierarchy implied in this sentence: the ‘álam al-
’amá is above jabarút, while the ‘álam al-amthál is above malakút. I
have inserted the clarifying phrases in brackets in line with this reading
of the passage.

\[36\] Here the previous sentence is repeated, with al-ka’in replacing rabb :
“He is the Existent with none as objects of His Lordship, the Knower
without objects of knowledge, the Almighty without objects of His
might, the Creator without any creatures.” I am surmising that this
repetition is due to a scribal error.

\[37\] Alternatively, the world of origination; only the word al-ibda’ is used,
but this is often used by the Báb as a designation for a level of a
distinctive four-fold cosmological hierarchy. Likewise, the term is used
by the Báb to designate four levels of creative activity that are proper
to the generation of four different levels of cosmic reality.

\[38\] The allusions here are many and baroque, but on one level these
references to letters can be understood to imply that God is exalted

above being truly qualified by affirmation (huwa, written in Arabic
with the letters ha` and waw) nor by negation (la`, “no”).

\[39\] The Qá’im, the awaited Twelfth Imám.

\[40\] al-Furqán , a synonym for the Qur’án.

\[41\] This is Báb’s Tafsir Surat al-Baqara.

\[42\] This refers to Kitáb al-Ruh.

\[43\] This refers to the Qayyúm al-Asma`.

\[44\] This refers to the Sahifa a’mal al-sana.

\[45\] This refers to the Báb’s Tafsir al-basmala.

\[46\] This refers to the Sharh Du’a al-Ghayba.

\[47\] The Sahifa bayn al-Haramayn is most likely intended here.

\[48\] On the basis of the statement later in this khutba to the effect that
the Ridawian Epistle (Sahifa Ridawiyya) contains details about the
works which were stolen from the Báb during his pilgrimage, MacEoin
was of the opinion that this is none other than the Kitáb al-Fihrist. If
that were the sole criterion, however, it is equally likely that this refers
to the Khutba al-Jidda. Neither of these works is divided into fourteen
sections.

\[49\] The Sahifa Makhzuna is probably intended here.

\[50\] The text here has awlíya il-‘ubád, which could be translated “the
Guardians of the worshipers.”
