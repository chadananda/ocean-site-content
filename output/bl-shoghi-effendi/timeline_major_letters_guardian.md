 | 

Includes reference to the ladies of the household. Mentions Tablet of the Master: "Ere the close of this Century and this Age, it shall be made clear and manifest how wondrous was that Springtide and how heavenly was that Gift!"

 |
| 

3/5/22

 | 

BA 17-25

 | 

The Mission of the Cause

 | 

Emphasis on unity, avoidance of contention. Urges avoidance of emphasis on "negative Teachings" of Bahá'u'lláh, and to "obliterate as much as possible all traces of censure, of conflicting discussions, of cooling remarks, of petty unnecessary observations that impeded the onward march of the Cause, that damp the zeal of the firm believer and detract from the sublimity of the Bahá'í Cause in the eyes of the inquirer". Basic principles of consultation (from Tablets of the Master) - Includes: prayer for Spiritual Assemblies; quotation from the Aqdas about Houses of Justice; Tablets from the Master on "prime requisites" and "the first condition is absolute love and harmony...".

| 

3/12/23

 | 

BA 34-43

 |  | 

The condition of the world; erection of administrative framework: Local and National Assemblies, the Fund; the importance of teaching. Referred to as "fresh and momentous decisions", undertaken in accordance with the provisions of the Aqdas. Reference to Spiritual Assemblies as precursors to Houses of Justice, and the foundation of the Master's Will. Outlines duties of Spiritual Assemblies. Emphasizes that this is an age of transition, and that the implications of the Will have not yet been fully grasped. "The need for the centralization of authority in the NSA, and the concentration of power in the various local Assemblies, is made manifest when we reflect that the Cause of Bahá'u'lláh is still in its age of tender growth and in a stage of transition; when we remember that the full implications and the exact significance of the Master's world-wide instructions, as laid down in His Will, are as yet not fully grasped, and the whole Movement has not sufficiently crystallized in the eyes of the world." Warns against the forces of separation and sectarian tendencies, "lest extreme orthodoxy on one hand, and irresponsible freedom on the other, cause it to deviate from that Straight Path which alone can lead it to success."

 |
| 

4/9/23

 | 

BA 45-48

 | 

to NSA concerning various issues

 | 

Contains further emphasis on the transitional status of the Cause: "...This and other similar matters will have to be explained and elucidated by the Universal House of Justice, to which, according to the Master's explicit instructions, all important and fundamental questions must be referred. At present the exact implication and full significance of the provisions of the Master's Will are as yet imperfectly understood, and time will serve to reveal the wisdom and the far-reaching effects of His words."

 |
|

 | 

BA 50-52

More on the gradual unfoldment of the Divine purpose: "We must trust to time, and the guidance of God's Universal House of Justice, to obtain a clearer understanding of its \[the Will's\] provisions and implications."

"Let us also remember that at the very root of the Cause lies the principle of the undoubted right of the individual to self-expression, his freedom to declare his conscience and set forth his views.... Let us also bear in mind that the keynote of the Cause of God is not dictatorial authority but humble fellowship, not arbitrary power, but the spirit of frank and loving consultation...."

 |
| 

9/24/24

 | 

BA 65-7

 |  | 

Returning from retirement. Reference to "the gravity of the spiritual state of the Cause in the world." Quotation on inner life: "Not by the force of numbers... One thing and only one thing will unfailingly and alone secure the undoubted triumph of this sacred Cause, namely, the extent to which our own inner life and private character mirror forth in their manifold aspects the splendor of those eternal principles proclaimed by Bahá'u'lláh." Support for local and national institutions "the fountainhead from which all future blessings will flow, the broad foundation upon which the security of the Divine Edifice must ultimately rest."

 |
| 

11/24/24

 | 

BA 67-70

 |  | 

Emphasizes translating faith into action; the paramount duty of teaching. "...Nothing but the abundance of our actions, nothing but the purity of our lives and the integrity of our characters, can in the last resort establish our claim that the Bahá'í spirit is in this day the sole agency that can translate a long-cherished ideal into an enduring achievement." "Let us scatter to the uttermost corners of the earth.... Let us too bear in mind the example which our beloved Master has clearly set before us. Wise and tactful in His approach, wakeful and attentive in His early intercourse, broad and liberal in all His public utterances, cautious and gradual in the unfolding of the essential verities of the Cause, passionate in His appeal yet sober in argument, confident in tone, unswerving in conviction, dignified in His manners..."

On one hand, it should aim at a steady and gradual expansion of the Movement along lines that are at once broad, sound and universal; and on the other it should insure the internal consolidation of the work already achieved. It should both provide the impulse whereby the dynamic forces latent in the Faith can unfold, crystallize, and shape the lives and conduct of men, and serve as a medium for the interchange of thought and the coordination of activities among the divers elements that constitute the Bahá'í community."

 | 

MA 13-14

The Pen of Bahá'u'lláh, the voice of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, have time and again, insistently and in terms unmistakable, warned an unheeding humanity of impending disaster."

 |
| 

7/28/39

 | 

MA 26-29

 | 

The Most Fateful Hour

 | 

major call to America to fulfil the goals of the Seven Year Plan. Includes more on coming convulsions: "Humanity, heedless and impenitent, is admittedly hovering on the edge of an awful abyss, ready to precipitate itself into that titanic struggle, that crucible whose chastening fires alone can and will weld its antagonistic elements of race, class, religion and nation into one coherent system, one world commonwealth. 'The hour is approaching' is Bahá'u'lláh's own testimony, 'when the most great convulsion will have appeared... I swear by God! The promised day is come, the day when tormenting trials will have surged above your heads, and beneath your feet, saying: "Taste ye, what your hands have wrought."'"

 | 

"Many will be the setbacks, the shocks and the disturbances, which the commotions of a convulsive age must produce; yet no force, however violent and world-wide in its range and catastrophic in its immediate consequences, can either halt these processes or deflect their appointed course. How great, then, the privilege, and how staggering the responsibility, of those who are destined to guard over them and to bring them eventually to full fruition. Nothing short of utter, of continuous consecration to His Will and Purpose can enable them to fulfil their high destiny."

 |
| 

6/13/40

 | 

MA 42

 |

MA 45-48

 | 

The Anger of God and His Correction

 | 

another call to America to fulfil its destiny; includes extended commentary on world conflagration. "The internecine struggle, now engulfing the generality of mankind, is increasingly assuming, in its range and ferocity, the proportions of the titanic upheaval foreshadowed as far back as seventy years ago by Bahá'u'lláh. It can be viewed in no other light except as a direct interposition by Him Who is the Ordainer of the Universe, the Judge of all men and the Deliverer of the nations. It is the rod of both the anger of God and of His correction. The fierceness of its devastating power chastens the children of men for their refusal to acclaim the century-old Message of their promised, their Heaven-sent Redeemer. The fury of its flames, on the other hand, purges away the dross, and welds the limbs of humanity into one single organism, indivisible, purified, God-conscious and divinely directed."

 |
| 

8/12/41

 | 

MA 49-52

 | 

Unconquerable Power

 | 

regarding internal convulsions from Covenant-Breakers; predicts internal and external opposition to come. "The resistless march of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh, viewed in this light, and propelled by the stimulating influences which the unwisdom of its enemies and the force latent within itself, both engender, resolves itself into a series of rhythmic pulsations, precipitated, on the one hand, through the explosive outbursts of its foes, and the vibrations of Divine Power, on the other, which speed it, with ever-increasing momentum, along that predestined course traced for it by the Hand of the Almighty." "The Heroic Age of the Faith, born in anguish, nursed in adversity, and terminating in trials as woeful as those that greeted its birth, has been succeeded by that Formative Period which is to witness the gradual crystallization of those creative energies which the Faith has released, and the consequent emergence of that World Order for which those forces were made to operate."

 |
| 

12/13/41

 | 

MA 52-53

 | 

The Crucible of World Affliction

 | 

"The most great convulsion envisaged by the Prophets from Isaiah to Bahá'u'lláh, cataclysmic in violence, planetary in range, is assailing, at long last, the predominating nations of the Asiatic and American continents. The leading Power of the Western Hemisphere ... has been suddenly though not unexpectedly plunged into the crucible of world conflagration."

"The second century is destined to witness a tremendous deployment and a notable consolidation of the forces working towards the world-wide development of that Order, as well as the first stirrings of that World Order, of which the present Administrative System is at once the precursor, the nucleus and pattern—an Order which, as it slowly crystallizes and radiates its benign influence over the entire planet, will proclaim at once the coming of age of the whole human race, as well as the maturity of the Faith itself, the progenitor of that Order."

imparts vision of the Ten-Year Crusade as ninth part of "the majestic process, set in motion at the dawn of the Adamic cycle", destined to culminate with "the stage at which the light of God's triumphant Faith shining in all its power and glory will have suffused and enveloped the entire planet", with "the establishment of the World Bahá'í Commonwealth, functioning in the plenitude of its powers, and which will signalize the long-awaited advent of the Christ-promised Kingdom of God on earth - the Kingdom of Bahá'u'lláh - mirroring however faintly upon this humble handful of dust the glories of the Abha Kingdom", and with the establishment of a world civilization "which posterity will, with one voice, acclaim as the fairest fruit of the Golden Age of the Dispensation of Bahá'u'lláh".

Call to action: "Once again I appeal to members of all communities to arise and enlist, ere the present opportunity is irretrievably lost, in the army of Bahá'u'lláh's crusaders. The hour is ripe to disencumber themselves of worldly vanities, to mount the steed of steadfastness, unfurl the banner of renunciation, don the armor of utter consecration to God's Cause, gird themselves with the girdle of a chaste and holy life, unsheathe the sword of Bahá'u'lláh's utterance, buckle on the shield of His love, carry as sole provision implicit trust in His promise, flee their homelands, and scatter far and wide to capture the unsurrendered territories of the entire planet."

steady flow of reinforcements "will presage and hasten the entry by troops of peoples of divers nations and races into the Bahá'í world - a day which, viewed in its proper perspective, will be the prelude to that long-awaited hour when a mass conversion on the part of these same nations and races, and as a direct result of a chain of events, momentous and possibly catastrophic in nature ... will suddenly revolutionize the fortunes of the Faith, derange the equilibrium of the world, and reinforce a thousandfold the numerical strength..."

materialism the "chief factor in precipitating the dire ordeals and world-shaking crises that must necessarily involve the burning of cities and the spread of terror and consternation in the hearts of men", "will lay waste the cities of the nations participating in this tragic world-engulfing contest", "a catastrophe of undreamed-of dimensions"; racism will cause "the streets of American cities to run with blood, aggravating thereby the havoc which the fearful weapons of destruction, raining from the air, and amassed by a ruthless, a vigilant, a powerful and inveterate enemy, will wreak upon those same cities." "The woes and tribulations which threaten it are partly avoidable, but mostly inevitable and God-sent". Encourages American believers to scatter, leaving 15 adult Bahá'ís in each city. Challenge to the individual Bahá'í, "who constitutes the warp and woof on which the quality and pattern of the whole fabric must depend."

Administrative Seats of Divinely-Appointed Institutions

 | 

seminal letter on the evolution of the World Centre and its connection to the Lesser Peace. "The raising of this Edifice will in turn herald the construction, in the course of successive epochs of the Formative Age of the Faith, of several other structures, which will serve as the administrative seats of such divinely appointed institutions as the Guardianship, the Hands of the Cause, and the Universal House of Justice. These Edifices will, in the shape of a far-flung arc, and following a harmonizing style of architecture, surround the resting-places of the Greatest Holy Leaf, ... of her Brother, ... and of their Mother.... This vast and irresistible process, unexampled in the spiritual history of mankind, and which will synchronize with two no less significant developments—the establishment of the Lesser Peace and the evolution of Bahá'í national and local institutions—the one outside and the other within the Bahá'í world—will attain its final consummation, in the Golden Age of the Faith, through the raising of the standard of the Most Great Peace, and the emergence, in the plenitude of its power and glory, of the focal Center of the agencies constituting the World Order of Bahá'u'lláh."

Evidences of the Resistless March of the World Crusade

 | 

Ridvan message marking end of fourth year of Crusade. Mention of "portentious prophecies", "foreshadowing a universal commotion, of a scope and intensity unparalleled in the annals of mankind." "The violent derangement of the world's equilibrium, ... these stand out as the signs and portents that must either herald or accompany the retributive calamity which, as decreed by Him Who is the Judge and Redeemer of mankind, must, sooner or later, afflict a society which ... has turned a deaf ear to the Voice of God's Messenger in this day..." Society is "how hovering on the brink of self-destruction".
