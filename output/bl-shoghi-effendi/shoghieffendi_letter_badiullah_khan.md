The letter put forward by that spiritual and dear friend dated 9 Bahman 1319 has come to the attention of the Guardian of the Cause of God, may our spirits be his sacrifice. The four questions concerning which you asked the favor of a reply from the most holy court were accepted and honored with a response.  
  
   With regard to the crimson scroll mentioned in the unapproachable Tablets,\[2\] he said, "Write that ’Abdu’l-Bahá’ said that the original intent of the 'Crimson Scroll' is the Tablet of the Covenant, that is, the Book of the Covenant."\[3\]  
  
   As for the Sacred Night, the recitation of blessed prayers and Tablets revealed for that night every year, and the inclusion of that night in the Bahá’í calendar, he said: "Write that it is permitted, but including it on the Bahá’í calendar is not required at the present time."  
  
   As concerns the blessed Tablet of the Bell, and the story of how it was revealed, he said: "Write that this Tablet was revealed in Istanbul at the request of Áqá Muhammad 'Alí Isfahání as conveyed by ’Abdu’l-Bahá’. This Tablet was written out by the Blessed Beauty\[4\] in His Own hand on the night of 5 Jumada al-Ulá, the night the Báb received His mission. Reciting this Tablet on that very blessed night is beloved and acceptable."  
  
   With regard to the last question, about a situation in which the means of consultation is absent and one has trouble making up one's mind about an important matter, you asked, "How should one consult the Most Holy Book for the purpose of soothsaying?"  
  
   He said, "In such a situation it is necessary and requisite that one turn with complete attention, in the spirit of seeking help, to the source of grace and inspiration, and to no one else. If it is possible to delay a bit in making one's decision until such time as consultation can be undertaken, this is better and more appropriate."  
  
Written at his blessed behest.
