## Bahiyyih Khanum: Eulogy for the Greatest Holy Leaf, in the Guardian's handwriting

### by [Shoghi Effendi](https://bahai-library.com/author/Shoghi+Effendi)

1932


**1\. Intro**

The US National Spiritual Assembly made facsimile copies of the Guardian's handwritten [tribute to the Greatest Holy Leaf](http://bahai-library.com/shoghieffendi_bahai_administration#letter52). He refers to this in a letter he wrote which was published in the US _Bahá'í News,_ No. 72, April 1933, page 3:

> "I wish to express to your distinguished Assembly my gratitude for the action they have taken in reproducing in facsimile my humble Tribute to the Greatest Holy Leaf. The hundred copies you sent me have been received and are splendid reproductions of the original. The finest and most enduring tribute which can be paid to her memory lies within the grasp and constitutes the supreme opportunity of the American believers. Her earthly life, as it drew to a close, was much brightened by the brilliant accomplishments of her devoted lovers in the American continent. May her pure, angelic soul in the realms above derive added satisfaction from the uninterrupted progress and the eventual completion of an enterprise on which she centered the one remaining joy of her life.

> \[signed\] SHOGHI  
> Haifa, Palestine  
> October 27, 1932.

I \[B. Poirier\] have seen one of these facsimiles which the surviving daughter of an early US believer has, and my recollection is that it was reproduced on blue paper. It may have been sent to all of the friends in the USA by the National Spiritual Assembly at that time (1932). Though this copy shows the Guardian's handwriting, the color is not as beautiful as that of the facsimiles.  
  
The first page of the letter is the frontispiece of _Bahá'í World_ Vol XIII. I \[J. Winters\] received these images as 8 PDF documents, each one containing a scan of 2 pages of the enclosed letter. The original images were not cut in the middle, indicating that pages 1 and 4 were each on one side of a large landscape-oriented piece of paper folded in half, and pages 2 and 3 were on the other side, etc. I extracted these images and then cut them in half, adjusted the levels for greater clarity, and posted them here sequentially. I did not remove any pixels or reduce the size of the images I received. These images are low-resolution because they were created in 2004, when monitors and bandwidth were more limited. To recreate the originals, simply collate the images below, as follows:

| 1: pages 1 and 4  
2: pages 2 and 3  
3: pages 5 and 8  
4: pages 6 and 7  
5: pages 9 and 12  
6: pages 10 and 11  
7: pages 13 and 16  
8: pages 14 and 15 |
