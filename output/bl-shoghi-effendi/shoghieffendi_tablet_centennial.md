Translator’s Preface

At the same time as that incomparable book, God Passes By, was

> inestimable gift to the world, he also wrote a most beautiful and eloquent
> Epistle in Arabic and Persian, known as the Lawḥ-i-Qarn [Tablet of the
> Centennial (1944 or BE 101)] It was read and memorized by many
> wonderful souls in the East. The Hand of the Cause, Mr Khádem, talked
about it at length in the book, The Vision of Shoghi Effendi, published in

North America.

At the request of a personal friend, this servant will attempt an

> goal of a befitting rendering of Bahá’u’lláh’s matchless utterance). I am
> also certain that pens abler than mine will produce better translations in the
> future after I leave this world.

the National Centre of Iran and the prediction of the fate of those that
have risen against the Cause of God.

As time does not permit us to analyze all these precious documents, I
will allow myself the detailed description of only one message—that of the
Bahá’í year 101.

In 1944, on the occasion of the celebration of the Centenary of the
Declaration of the beloved Báb, Bahá’í literature was crowned with two
masterpieces from the Guardian, two brilliant stars that shall shine eternally
in the firmament of the historical and literary works of the Cause. The first,
which took the title of God Passes By, is addressed to the friends in
America; and the second, addressed to the friends in the East, is titled “The
Tablet of Naw-Rúz 101”. Both deal with the touching history of the Cause
in the course of the century, a history of persecution and oppression, a
history of suffering and victory, a history of joy and love, a history of the
growth of the Cause of God, of its rise and of its descent into a wave-tossed
sea of happenings, of its evolution from an embryonic state to its
triumphant march towards its culminating point determining the destiny of
man.

In these two works, literary aptitude of the Guardian and his historical
knowledge are fully manifested. His perspective on the destiny of the
Cause, his clear vision and analytical power, enlighten us on the
development of the divine Revelation and its long path to its apogee: the
establishment of the Kingdom of God on earth.

The subjects treated in the two works are analogous, but there is an
evident difference in its manner and method of presentation. The book,
God Passes By, which you have certainly read, is a book of 463 pages
apportioned to four historical periods, comprising the ministry of the Báb in
five chapters, the ministry of Bahá’u’lláh in eight chapters, the ministry of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ likewise in eight chapters, and finally the dawn of the
Formative Age of the Faith in four chapters, a section which ends in a
retrospective overview of the past and a prospective vision of the future of
the Cause. In contrast, the message of Naw-Rúz of the year 101 is one long
tablet of 199 pages (104 manuscript pages written by the Guardian himself
and 95 machine-typed pages) which begins with a 3 page Arabic prelude,
of rare and exceptional beauty and eloquence, reflecting in their poetic
eloquence the Guardian as both mystic historian and as theologian.

In this preface, the expression of salutation and praise to the names
and attributes of God is followed by a eulogy to Bahá’u’lláh, listing His

titles and characterizations, as well as the titles and characterizations that
> apply to Him in the prophecies of the Messengers of the past. Then, he
> offers his praises to the Báb and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’, and finally his wishes and
his pledges to all that arise to serve and assist the Cause of God.

That which gives particular distinction to this moving preamble, is the
number of characterizations, titles and attributes of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh

> and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ extracted from the sacred books. He characterizes
> Bahá’u’lláh with thirty-six attributes, he presents the Báb with twenty-nine
> characterizations and lauds ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ by means of sixteen titles and
> attributes. The terms he uses for these characterizations are generally short,
the majority composed of two or three well chosen words.

For example, among the terms he uses to characterize Bahá’u’lláh, one
> finds: “the Truth of truths”, “the Essence of essences”, “the Hidden Name”,
> “the Heavenly Father”, “the Sovereign of sovereigns”, “the Sun of the
> horizons”, “Him Whom God will make Manifest”, “the Founder of the
> Most Great Peace”, etc. Among the characterizations of the Báb, one finds:
> “the great divine Gate”, “the Proof of God among the peoples”, “the divine
and imperishable Face”, “the king of the Messengers”, etc.

The Arabic paragraphs are very rhythmic and emit a musical vibration.

> One is not content simply to read or listen to them, one desires to chant
> them. It is a symphony that fills heart and soul, and when one begins to
read them, one relishes, one savours every word.

After this marvellous preamble, he addresses himself to the
> assemblage of believers and, over six pages, extols this era of God. He
> makes mention of eleven points to fully describe the importance of the first
century of this Revelation. Here are some passages:

How great the blessedness that pertains to this wondrous, this most
> marvellous century, this luminous, scintillating, and transcendent Age such
> that the eye of creation whether of the past or the future has not witnessed
its likeness!

> How great the blessedness that pertains to this wondrous, this most
> marvellous century in which God through His omnipotent Will and
> all-pervasive Purpose has planted in the midmost point of existence
> [quṭb-al-afáq] the divine lote-tree [sadrah], the immortal Tree, and it
> has grown greatly, became verdant, efflorescent, sent high its branches

\[5\] Most of the titles given to the Central Figures of the Faith have been footnoted in this
> edition (MW’s note).

and become fruitful and spread out its all encompassing shade over all
> the world.
> How great the blessedness that pertains to this wondrous, this most
> marvellous century in the very first night of which the veil of
> concealment was uplifted and the fragrance of God was wafted and the
> earth of all existence has been quickened and the canopy of the past
> Dispensations was rolled up and in which the upright ALIF appeared
> and the Resurrection did come to pass and the Most Great Gate [Báb]
> was opened in the face of all nations and from the land of Persia the
> Light of God, the Most Exalted Ali, did shine, and the veil was lifted
> from that ‘Alid Youth of al-Bathá and the Primal Point around which
> the spirits of all God’s Messengers revolve appeared and was made
manifest.

He continues the description of the station and importance of the first
age of the Revelation of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, covering another eight
subjects, each paragraph beginning by the repetition of:

> How great the blessedness that pertains to this wondrous, this most
> marvellous century
> He then addresses himself to the night itself of the Declaration of the
Báb in the following phrases:

> O sacred and holy Night! Upon thee be the most perfect and most
> glorious greetings! Upon thee be the purest and most radiant
> salutations!
> O solace of the Eye of Creation! O joyous Commencement of the
> Days of God! O Dawn of the most glorious and honoured Age! And
> inception of the sacred and majestic Century! Because of thy
> revelation, O Night, the most great portals were opened unto the face
> of creation, the most concealed Mystery did reveal Itself, the Most
> Pre-existent Light did shine forth. Through Thee the Straight Path was
> outstretched, and the breezes of life-giving Spirit were wafted forth
> unto all the nations. Because of remembering Thee, Abraham, the
> Friend of God would rejoice in His inmost heart, and Moses the
> Interlocutor would be glad in His inmost being, and Jesus Christ the
> Spirit of God would be enthralled with His entire being, and
> Muḥammad the loved One would bestir Himself. Because of Thy
> Advent the Concourse on High were joyous, and hallelujah’s of joy
> were raised from the cherubim, the saints, and the angels nigh unto
God. Through Thee all earth and all the heavens were illumined, and

in Thee all nights were resurrected, and from Thee all days sought
> light. The Night of Power circumambulated Thee. Because of thy
> advent, O Night, the Countenance of Existence wreathed into a smile!

He then embarks on the description of the history and historical events
and development of the Cause. His powerful and inspired pen proceeds
skilfully along the arena of events, touching on the salient points of history.
The perspective he depicts touches on the essential traits of the growth of
this Revelation, his brush paints the magnificent tableau of all that has
unfolded in the course of the century. He describes the passage of history
from the declaration of the Báb, the formation of the Letters of the Living,
their missions, the pilgrimage of the Báb to Mecca, his return, the
persecutions which ensued and ended in His confinement in Máh-Kú and
Chiríq and finally His martyrdom, Bahá’u’lláh’s entry to the scene, the
scattering of the disciples to teach His Cause, the persecutions of
Bahá’u’lláh, His efforts to reunite and guide the disciples of the Báb, His
imprisonment, His private declaration, the shooting forth of the waves of
animosity against Bahá’u’lláh, His exile in Baghdád, the Sulaymáníyyih
days, His return to Baghdád and His public declaration, the inauguration of
the Bahá’í Era, His exile to Istanbul, Adrianople and His incarceration in
the Most Great Prison, the intrigues of Azal and his collaborators, the
revelation of the Mother Book, the Aqdas, the writings of Bahá’u’lláh, the
Centre of the Covenant and His task of expansion of the Faith across the
world, His suffering, His voyages to the West and finally the tragic fate of
the enemies of the Faith.

This literary masterpiece of the Guardian was revealed for presentation
to the friends in the East at Naw-Rúz of the year 101 (1944), but the
Guardian wished for it to be unveiled on Riḍván of the same year, in the
course of a solemn pilgrimage ceremony which was to unfold at the House
of the Báb in Shiráz, on the occasion of the centenary of His proclamation,
with the participation of all the delegates that were to gather for ‘Írán’s
National Convention. The National Spiritual Assembly of ‘Írán took charge
of the preparations, and in spite of the restrictions and difficulties imposed
by the Second World War, it succeeded in conveying the manuscript of the
message from ‘Iráq to Shiráz precisely in time for Riḍván.

On the eve of the anniversary of the declaration of the Báb, while all
the delegates were gathered in the blessed House of the Báb, inundated by
the light of the lustres and candles, the resonance of a beautiful voice
chanting the moving preamble to the message—in the very room where one
hundred years earlier had witnessed the unveiling of the Báb’s mission to

Mullá Ḥusayn—made ecstatic tears to flow over the faces of 91 delegates
who received the benedictions of a historic night filled with confirmation.

At the end of this message, the beloved Guardian had requested from
all who were present at the House of the Báb to perform a pilgrimage on
his behalf and implore the confirmation of the Blessed Beauty on his tasks
in the service of His Cause, and he finishes the message with a prayer
revealed by his blessed pen addressed to the Báb. I would like, to close this
evening’s talk, to share with you the translation of this prayer:

> O God, the Most High! We implore Thee by Thy Name and by Thy
> blood spread over the earth to grant our prayers and to enable us to
> nest under the shelter of Thy protecting wings and to shower upon us
> the rain of Thy generosity and Thy bounty. Assist and aid us to follow
> Thy path for love of Thee and draw us nigh unto the chord of Thy
> faithfulness and confirm us in Thy love and in the promulgation of Thy
> Message.
> Preserve us from the darts of them that have denied Thee. Aid us to
> follow the pathway of Thy Will and to proclaim the Faith of Thy Best-
> Beloved, the Most Glorious, He in Whose path thou hast sacrificed
> Thyself, and for the sake of Whose love Thou hast wished for
> martyrdom.
> Deliver us, O our Best Beloved, the Exalted, the Most High.
> Encourage us and make firm our steps. Forgive us our sins and
> expiate our trespasses, unloose our tongues, so that we may lift our
> voices and from our lips may flow Thy praise. Crown our deeds and
> our labours with the diadem of Thy grace. Make the end of our lives
> like unto that which Thou didst bestow on the faithful among Thy
> servants. We supplicate unto Thee to count us among them who have
> turned their faces unto Thee and have arisen in Thy service.
> Intoxicate us with the glory of Thy presence, and render us immortal
> in the gardens of Thy holiness. Grant us the grace and bountiful
> favours of Thy heavenly Kingdom, O Thou Saviour of the world.

\[4\] Huwíyyat (KF’s note)

\[5\] Bahá’u’lláh writes: “The conceptions of the devoutest of mystics, the attainments of the

> render are all the product of man's finite mind and are conditioned by its limitations. Ten
> thousand Prophets, each a Moses, are thunderstruck upon the Sinai of their search at His

> impenetrable mystery of His unknowable Essence. Every attempt to attain to an
