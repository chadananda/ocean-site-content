**Successive Stages in the Transfer of the Remains of the Báb from Persia to the Holy Land and the Erection of His Mausoleum on Mount Carmel**

  
Execution of the Báb in Tabríz and the exposure of His mangled body on the edge of the moat outside the city, July 9, 1850.  
  
Wrapping of His remains in a cloak, their secret removal to the silk factory owned by one of the believers of Mílán and their deposition in a small wooden casket, July 11, 1850.  
  
Transportation in accordance with Bahá'u'lláh's instructions, of the casket to Tihrán and its concealment in the shrine of Imám-Zádih Hasán.  
  
Removal of the remains to the home of Hájí Sulaymán Khán and their subsequent transfer to the shrine of Imám-Zádih Ma'súm.  
  
Instructions issued by Bahá'u'lláh, while in Adrianople, to Mullá 'Alí Ákbar-i-Sháhmírzádí and Jamál-i-Burújirdí, to transfer the casket to a safer hiding place, and its temporary concealment within a wall of the Masjid-i-Másha'u'lláh outside the gates of the capital, 1867-1868.  
  
Detection of the hiding place of the casket and its smuggling into Tihrán and its deposition in the house of Mírzá Hasan-i-Vazír, a believer and son-in-law of Hájí Mírzá Siyyid 'Alíy-i-Tafríshí, the Majdu'l-Ashraf.  
  
Discovery of the hiding place by a number of believers and the consequent removal of the casket by Hájí Sháh Muhammad-i-Manshádí, surnamed Amínu'l-Bayán, in accordance with Bahá'u'lláh's instructions, to the shrine of Imám-Zádih Zayd, and its burial beneath the floor of the inner sanctuary, whence it was again removed to a series of private homes in Tihrán.  
  
Bahá'u'lláh's visit to Mount Carmel, the revelation of the Tablet of Carmel, and the appointment by Him, in the presence of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, of the site to serve as the permanent burial-place for the remains of the Báb.  
  
Despatch of Mírzá Asadu'lláh by 'Abdu'l-Bahá with specific instructions to transport the body of the Báb to the Holy Land, and the transfer of the remains to Isfáhán, and thence, via Kirmánsháh, Baghdád and Damascus, to the Holy Land, arriving at their destination on January 31, 1899, fifty lunar years after the Báb's execution in Tabríz.  
  
Purchase by 'Abdu'l-Bahá of the site designated by Bahá'u'lláh, and the construction of a marble sarcophagus by the Burmese believers in accordance with 'Abdu'l-Bahá's suggestion, designed to receive the body of the Báb.  
  
Laying of the foundation-stone of the Shrine of the Báb by 'Abdu'l-Bahá with the participation of Ibráhim Khayru'lláh, while on his pilgrimage to 'Akká, following the establishment of the Faith in the United States of America, 1899.  
  
Construction by 'Abdu'l-Bahá of six chambers constituting the initial stage in the erection of the mausoleum of the Báb.  
  
Downfall of Sultán 'Abdu'l-Hamíd II, whose Commission of Inquiry had visited the Shrine and was contemplating its destruction; the release of  

* * *

+P16  
  
'Abdu'l-Bahá from His incarceration and the placing by Him of the wooden casket in the marble sarcophagus on the day coinciding with the inauguration of the first American Bahá'í Convention, March 21, 1909.  
  
Purchase of extensive properties on the slope of Mt. Carmel in the immediate vicinity of the Shrine of the Báb and their permanent dedication to His memory.  
  
Construction of three additional chambers marking the completion of the preliminary structure contemplated by 'Abdu'l-Bahá.  
  
Opening of terraces stretching from the Shrine to the foot of Mount Carmel; the exemption by the British High Commissioner of the entire area dedicated to the Mausoleum of the Báb from taxation; the establishment of the Palestine Branches of the American and Indian National Spiritual Assemblies; and the subsequent transfer of a part of the dedicated properties to the name of these newly formed branches.  
  
Entombment of the remains of the Purest Branch and of the Mother, sister and wife of 'Abdu'l-Bahá in the vicinity of the Shrine, as a prelude to the establishment of the World Administrative Center of the Faith in that same neighborhood.  
  
Unveiling of the model designed by W. S. Maxwell for the superstructure of the Shrine on the occasion of the centenary celebrations of the Declaration of the Báb in Haifa on May 23, 1944.  
  
Placing of successive contracts for the masonry and ornamentation of the Arcade and Parapet of the Shrine, amounting to approximately eight hundred tons, and their transportation from Italy to Haifa.  
  
Completion of the Arcade and Parapet of the Shrine on the occasion of the centenary of the Báb's martyrdom, July 9, 1950.  
  

**Fate of Those Who Persecuted the Báb, Who Opposed the Construction of His Shrine and Threatened its Destruction**

  
MUHAMMAD SHÁH, who disregarded the appeal of the Báb to meet Him in person and plead His Cause, sustained a sudden reverse of fortune, and succumbed, at the age of forty, to a complication of maladies.  
  
NÁSIRI'D-DÍN SHÁH, during whose reign the Báb was executed, and under whose ageis the greatest massacre of the Bábis took place, was, in the plenitude of his power, dramatically assassinated on the eve of his jubilee. The Qájár dynasty to which he belonged was subsequently brought to an ignominious end.  
  
HÁJÍ MÍRZÁ ÁQÁSÍ, the Grand Vazír of Muhammad Sháh and chief instigator of the outrages perpetrated against the Báb, was disgraced by his sovereign, lost his fortune, was expelled to Karbilá, and became a victim of disease and poverty.  
  
MÍRZÁ TAQÍ KHÁN, the Amír Nizám, the Grand Vazír of Násiri'd-Dín Sháh, who was directly responsible for the execution of the Báb, was disgraced and put to death by the royal order in the bath of the Palace of Fín, near Káshán.  
  

* * *

+P17  
  
  
  
MÍRZÁ HASAN KHÁN, who carried out the execution of the Báb, was subjected, two years after, to a dreadful punishment which ended in his death.  
  
MÍRZÁ 'ALÍ-ASGHAR, the Shaykhu'l-lslám of Tabríz, who inflicted the bastinado on the Báb with his own hand, was stricken, in that same year, with paralysis, and died a miserable death.  
  
THE REGIMENT, which constituted the firing squad that executed the Báb, lost, in that same year, two hundred and fifty of its officers and men in an earthquake near Ardibíl, while the remaining five hundred were shot, two years later, in Tabríz, for mutiny. The head of the regiment, Áqá Ján Big, lost his life, six years after the martyrdom of the Báb, during the bombardment of Muhammarih by the British.  
  
THE SHI'AH SACERDOTAL ORDER, which violently opposed the Báb, aroused the populace and instigated the government against Him, was discredited, fell from power, and ceased to exercise its paramount influence on both the people and the government.  
  
SULTÁN 'ABDU'L-HAMÍD II, who lent his support to the enemies of the Faith in their efforts to obstruct the construction of the Shrine of the Báb, was deposed and made a prisoner of state. The Caliphate was subsequently abolished and the Sultánate ceased to exist.  
  
THE FOUR MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION OF INQUIRY, who were appointed by 'Abdu'l-Hamíd to investigate the activities of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, and who misrepresented the Shrine of the Báb as a fortress and vast ammunition depot on Mt. Carmel, suffered an ignominious fate, one being shot, another robbed of all his possessions, the third exiled, and the fourth sinking into abject poverty.  
  
JAMÁL PÁSHÁ, the Turkish Commander-in-Chief, who threatened the destruction of the Holy Tomb, was defeated in battle, fled, and was slain while a refugee in the Caucasus.  
  
MÍRZÁ MUHAMMAD-'ALÍ, the Arch-Breaker of the Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh, who was the chief instigator of the enemies of 'Abdu'l-Bahá and exerted his utmost to obstruct the construction of the Shrine of the Báb, was stricken with paralysis, and lived to see every hope he had cherished dashed to the ground.  
  
THE INVADING FORCES OF GENERAL ROMMEL, whose threat to Alexandria constituted the gravest danger to the Holy Land, and whose victory would have precipitated the direst crisis in the fortunes of the Faith at its World Center, and imperiled its institutions, was routed from the continent of Africa, and the peril of a régime inimical to the Faith removed forever.  
  
THE ARAB COMMUNITY living in the neighborhood of the Shrine of the Báb, which violated the sacredness of its precincts, in the course of the disturbances in the Holy Land, and supported the schemes of the ex-Mufti of Jerusalem, who had threatened to extirpate the Faith, fled in ignominy and joined the great army of refugees that was seeking shelter in the adjoining territories.

**The Badí' or Bahá'í Calendar**

  
This calendar was laid down by the Báb in His book the "Kitáb-i-Asmá" and further elucidated by Bahá'u'lláh in these words: "The Year Sixty, A.H. (1844 A.D.), the year of the Declaration of the Báb, must be regarded as the beginning of the Badí' Calendar." Therefore all Bahá'í reckoning commences with that Declaration which took place on the evening preceding the fifth day of Jamádiyu'l-Avval, of the year 1260 A.H. (May 23, 1844). The Solar calendar is followed and the Bahá'í New Year, called "Naw-Rúz," falls on the vernal equinox which takes place on March 21.

> Ayyám-i-Há (Intercalary Days) February 26 to March 1 inclusive—four in ordinary and five in leap years.

  
The Báb has regarded the solar year of 365 days, 5 hours, and 50 odd minutes, as consisting of 19 months of 19 days each, every new day being reckoned as starting from sunset, not midnight. Every fourth year the number of intercalary days is raised from four to five. Naw-Rúz, or New Year, falls on the 21st of March only if the vernal Equinox precedes the setting of the sun on that day. Should the vernal Equinox take place after sunset, Naw-Rúz will be celebrated on the following day.  
  
The Báb has divided the years following the date of His Revelation into cycles of nineteen years each. Each cycle of nineteen years He has named a Vahíd, and nineteen Vahíds constitute a period called by Him a Kull-i-Shay'. The numerical value of the word "Vahíd" is 19 and that of "Kull-i-Shay' " is 361. "Vahíd" signifies unity and is symbolic of the unity of God.
