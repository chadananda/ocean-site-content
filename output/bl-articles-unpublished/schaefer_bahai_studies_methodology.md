        Some Footnotes to Baha-’i- Studies and its Methodology1

Frankly speaking, I hesitated when I was asked to speak on the highly com-
plex issue of methodology in Baha-’i- studies. Numerous letters of the Uni-
versal House of Justice and quite a number of articles on Baha-’i- scholarship
have been published on this subject (among them a very interesting contri-
bution of Peter Khan in the recent issue of The Journal of Baha-’i- Studies 2),
seminars and conferences have been held, and I feel badly prepared to lead
you to new shores.

The suggested topic of my presentation:

> “Baha-’i- scholarship should go beyond the present materialistic ap-
> proaches dominant in the academic world”

refers to formulations used in letters of the Universal House of Justice, i. e.,
in a letter of 20 July 1997 where it is stated that

> “Problems will arise rather, if an attempt is made to impose, on the
> Baha-’i- community’s own study of the Revelation, materialistic
> methodologies and attitudes antithetical to its very nature.”

The purpose of my paper cannot be the delineation of a comprehensive
theory of Baha-’-i methodology. The views that I am presenting have the
character of footnotes to this subject.

Let me start with three introductory remarks:

1. The topicality of this seminar and others held recently has been
evoked by the ongoing internet discussions and by some publications of J. R.
Cole. Unfortunately the level of my information about this discussion is

fragmentary (and I think this is not only my own problem). I read some of
Cole’s publications, I read some of the discussions on the Internet, some arti-
cles on Baha-’i- scholarship and quite a number of the letters of the Universal
House of Justice on this subject, which are mostly answers to enquiries. I
found them very helpful for following the debate, but I think, it would un-
doubtedly have been easier for those who want to understand the crucial
points, if at least extracts from these inquiries had been included so that
one could have read the letters of the House in their context.

2. The conflict obviously resulted from unpleasant experiences with the
institution of pre-publication review, which indeed caused problems in
many countries. I don’t want to go into details, although I could say much on
this subject from my own painful experiences, but I think, provided the re-
viewing process is in competent hands and is not misused as an instrument
for the suppression of a genre of literature which the reviewer finds unpleas-
ant, Baha-’-i academics can live with it. The fact, that Desinformation als
Methode (Making the Crooked Straight), in which quite a number of crucial
points have been discussed, among them the concepts of infallibility and of
covenant-breaking, has been published, is sufficient evidence that the pub-
lication of academic works need not be hampered by pre-publication re-
view.

3. The present discussion is taking place in Baha-’i- communities in which
strong tendencies of anti-intellectualism can still be discerned. That they
exist, was the unanimous opinion of the speakers at the recent Oxford con-
ference. Such tendencies are also admitted by Peter Khan in the article I re-
ferred to. When I once spoke at the national Baha-’i- Centre in Oslo before a
Baha-’i- audience–it was in the early 90s–and mentioned that I was elaborat-
ing a rebuttal of a monograph written by a covenant-breaker, some of the

attendants reacted in a highly emotional way and protested heatedly when I
mentioned that I was analysing the numerous malicious accusations con-
tained in that book. Later on they even sent a letter to the Universal House
of Justice complaining about that heinous endeavour.

Quite a number of Baha-’i-s regard rational thought with deep scepticism,
they consider it irrelevant and unspiritual. They take it as an expression of a
lack of faith and see in critical discourse only “idle disputation” 3. This is, of
course, mostly not expressed so explicitly. Often subliminal feelings become
evident from attitudes and actions as, for instance, in the constant emphasis
on spirituality, in public appeals to teach not by reason, but rather “from
heart to heart”, in the emphatic call to “Be inflamed!” (as happened in a
manifesto published by the National Teaching Committee in the German Baha-
’i- News). It is not discursive, rational and systematic teaching that is called
for, but rather an emotional proclamation. The “feeling” is looked for. “What
are you feeling?”, asked the leader of an institute after texts of Baha-’u’lla-h
had been read. Such attitudes, which are common in esoteric, therapeutic or
New-Age- and other circles, should not prevail in Baha-’-i communities: and
they are hardly an invitation to do scholarly work.

4. Two extreme attitudes in the world community can be observed
which had already been anticipated by Shoghi Effendi when he warned of
“the forces of separation and of sectarian tendencies” 4: “Extreme orthodoxy
on one hand, and irresponsible freedom on the other” 5, which both “deviate
from the Straight Path” 6. Representatives of the first attitude are, as the
Universal House of Justice put it,

3   See Kita-b-i-Aqdas 77.

6   Ibid.

“Baha-’i-s who, imbued by what they conceive to be loyalty to Baha-’-
> u’lla-h, cling to blind acceptance of what they understand to be a
> statement of the Sacred Text. This shortcoming demonstrates an
> equally serious failure to grasp the profundity of the Baha-’i- princi-
> ples and of the harmony of faith and reason. The danger of such an
> attitude is that it exalts personal understanding of some parts of the
> revelation over the whole, leads to illogical and internally inconsis-
> tent applications of the Sacred Text, and provides fuel to those who
> would mistakenly characterize loyalty to the Covenant as ‘funda-
> mentalism’.” 7

Those hard-liners, tending to “intemperate criticism, inappropriate
comment and unjust accusations” 8, create a climate in which scholarly work
cannot prosper. The Universal House of Justice assured that it “will not
permit a climate of intolerance to prosper in the Baha-’i- community, no mat-
ter from what cause it arises”. 9

Peter Khan, too, in his article criticises the “narrow-mindedness re-
flected in the erroneous view that we need only the revelation of Baha-’u’lla-h”,
that “philosophy is a waste of time”. He calls this “crypto-fundamentalist
thinking” 10, and points to the fact that because of this reason “in both Aus-
tralia and in the United States, a number of very capable and sincere people
... severed their connection with the Faith”. According to Khan this line of
thinking can be discerned occasionally even in the Holy Land. 11

5. It is no wonder that quite a number of Baha-’-is, mostly academics, are
in opposition to such an attitude that prepares the soil for superstition.
However, a dialectical counterblow always bears the risk of being unbal-
anced and going beyond the proper limits which are defined by the Cove-

nant. J. R. Cole in his cynical commentary on the letter of the Universal
House of Justice dated 7 April 1999, referred to the academic methodology
to which he is committed if he works on the field of comparative religious
studies and of history, and which, as he holds, must also be applied in Baha-’i-
studies:

> “In the academic world, no one accepts an argument from authority.
> No proposition is true because such an historian asserts it. It is true
> because it can be proven to be true by text and reasoning. When it
> cannot in this way be upheld, the proposition is revised or rejected.
> The process is like that in science. Thus, academic writing is an on-
> going dialogue-fluid, unstable, not fixed. When an academic such as
> myself writes about the Baha-’i- Faith from an academic point of
> view, he or she is in a sense merely putting forward personal in-
> sights based on available texts and upon reasoned analysis of them.
> This academic writing, being a form of individual, non-authoritative
> interpretation subject to public debate and revision, should not be
> seen as forming a thread to, or an alternative to, the authoritative
> interpretation of ‘Abdu’l-Baha- and Shoghi Effendi. Given that the
> Universal House of Justice has no right to interpret the Baha-’i- writ-
> ings with authority, however, that body may over time find that
> academic writing actually is helpful to it, over the rigour of its
> methods.”

Cole refers to “academic freedom” and his “freedom of conscience”, which is
“the freedom to expose, to seek the truth no matter where it leads”.

Prima facie this sounds quite convincing. But there are questions. The
crucial point is: Are Baha-’i-s who are writing on their faith scholars of reli-
gious studies (Religionswissenschaftler), have they to follow the scientific
methodology of this discipline? This is not so clear. I think, it depends:

In the field of Baha-’i- history the historical research of the facts, of the
events must undoubtedly be open to scientific scrutiny. Here the academic

methodology to which Cole refers has to be applied. No historical fact can
be taken as granted only because an authority said so. 12 There is no re-
vealed “Baha-’i- history”. Nabi-l’s Dawn Breakers, a historical report of a con-
temporary of the holy figures, is undoubtedly much more reliable than most
historical traditions in other religions, but if new facts arise that are in con-
tradiction to his report or even to the Guardian’s historical data in God
Passes By, one has to take notice of them. They have to be taken into ac-
count and critically assessed.

Quite another point is the interpretation of such facts in the context of
the revelation. The theological significance of historical events goes beyond
the judgement of the historian. The Roman historian Tacitus in his book
Annales 13 called the Christian faith a “pernicious superstition”. Was this
judgement true simply because Tacitus was a historian, committed to objec-
tivity, as he himself emphasized when he wrote that he reports history “sine
ira et studio” 14?

6. I would like to draw your attention on the initial part of the first chap-
ter of Making the Crooked Straight where you can find some elucidations on
the methodology of religious studies, and where I pointed out that religion
is a subject that is only partly accessible to scientific analysis, that the mys-
tery of a religion is beyond the reach of science. Let me quote a passage:

> “There are no scientific criteria for a religion’s claim to truth; it can
> be neither proven nor disproven scientifically. Scholars working in
> the field of religious studies can investigate and describe only the
> historical, phenomenological, and sociological aspects of their sub-
> ject. The academic discipline of religious studies is by nature de-

12   Interior events such as Baha-’u’lla-h’s mystical intimation with his prophetical office are not

included.

14   Ibid. 1:5 (“Without anger and zeal”).

scriptive, narrative and comparative. Where normative statements
> are nevertheless made and critical judgements are arrived at, these
> are necessarily based on certain preconditions, on subjective stan-
> dard values which cannot be questioned or even on dogmatic posi-
> tions, and the study ceases to be scientific in the strict sense of the
> word.” 15

The great Jewish philosopher Martin Buber put it this way: “The mystery of
the other is always within himself and cannot be perceived from outside.” 16

The decisive point is that religious studies regard the religious phenom-
ena from outside. Working in the field of science, the scholar has to work
under the premise of a methodical agnosticism, as empirical research and
scientific reasoning have to be committed to absolute objectivity and to re-
frain from personal beliefs, commitments and value judgements.

7. I think it is not the prevailing methodology in religious studies that
leads to unacceptable results, it is rather the inclination of the scholars to
disregard the immanent limits of their discipline and to pronounce value
judgements that are not based on their methodical research, but rather on
their personal presuppositions, convictions and feelings. They often ignore
the fact that religious truth is beyond the reach of science and that claims to
truth cannot be the object of critical research, of scholarly questioning. “In a
scientific approach the question of the objective foundations of religion—i.
e., the questions of God and revelation—must be respected, but left out of
the critical research, as must also the doctrinal and ethical content of each
respective religion. The central concepts of metaphysics such as ‘God, free-

dom and immortality’ 17 are, as Kant has demonstrated, beyond our rational
understanding or empirical experience.” 18

Unfortunately religious studies have transgressed this border-line quite
often. We can take Near Eastern studies as an example. Western orientalists
have meticulously investigated Islam and brought about an incredible
wealth of phenomena, of facts, features and insights, so that we know Islam
quite well. But, in the final analysis, they have failed to convey a true under-
standing of this religion, because they tend to reduce the revelation to its
historicity: everything is interpreted as a result of contingent elements and
events, of historical constellations, whereas the claim to truth is ignored.
This reductionism attributes everything a Muslim believes as being re-
vealed from God to the historical conditions of its origin. The prophet is
portrayed solely as a figure of history and politics. I would like to elucidate
this by two examples:

a. The scholars take it for granted that Islam is an eclectic composition
of religious ideas taken from pagan, Jewish and Christian sources, which the
prophet considered suitable for the awakening of a truly religious spirit
among his fellow men. Academic research is to a great extent focused on the
issue of where Muh,.ammad has taken the divers elements of his teachings,
laws, ordinances and rituals from. As to the law of fasting for instance, some
have stressed the similarity with Jewish fasting, others have drawn atten-
tion to Babylonian or Mandaean parallels. This research is clearly done un-
der the premise that the author of the Qur’a-n was Muh.ammad himself, and

not God. Thus, the scholars have become the victims of their presupposi-
tions (Vorverständnis), 19 which are not the result of scientific research.

b. The change of the qibla: Western researchers take it as an established
fact that the abrogation of Jerusalem as the point of adoration was due to
the prophet’s disenchantment with the Jewish tribes and his insight that he
had failed to convert them to the new revelation. Indeed, the law of the
qibla was revealed in the period of Medina, when the Jewish tribes had in-
stigated a conspiracy against the prophet and were accused of having com-
mitted treason in the war between the Meccans and the Muslims. The con-
clusion seems to be reasonable, convincing even, but it ignores completely
the reason given in the Qur’a-n:

> “And we did not appoint the direction thou wast facing, except that
> we might know who followed the Messenger from him who turned
> on his heels.” 20

-
Baha-’i-s know from the Kita-b-i-Iqa-n that this ordinance, which the young
community experienced as a scandal, was a divine test, an expression of
that principle of “separation and distinction” of which Baha-’u’lla-h has de-
clared that it “operated in each of the previous dispensations” 21.

8. This demonstrates clearly the reductionistic character of alleged sci-
entific judgements. The violation of the immanent limitations of religious
studies inevitably results in a limited, excessively narrow understanding of
the religious phenomena, in a distorted view of the historic religions, and I

19   The philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer has written about this role of the subjective attitude to

the object of research in his famous work Truth and Method .

think this is meant when the Universal House of Justice criticises “material-
istic methodology and interpretation” 22 and its use in Baha-’i- studies.

Truth is concrete, therefore two examples taken from Baha-’-i studies:

a. A scathing review 23 has been written of a book entitled The Style of
the Kita-b-i-Aqdas. The author of that review is puzzled by the structure of
the Most Holy Book “and its apparent lack of literary unity” (obviously he
means that this book has no systematical order 24). He criticises the mono-
graph on the style of the Aqdas for not dealing with this issue. 25 The re-
viewer’s criticism may be legitimate, but some of his arguments are very
strange. So, in attempting to explain the “lack of literary unity”, he surmises
that the book’s obvious unsystematic structure “might be a deliberate imita-
tion of the Qur’a-n, in which the suras have been compiled in an arbitrary
order”, or that Baha-’u’lla-h might have revealed sections of the book to his
secretaries “and accorded them the status of being part of the Most Holy
Book, but did not himself determine the position in which every section
should appear”. Such speculations do not take the book’s claim to be revela-
tion, to be the Word of God, seriously. A God who “imitates” his own previ-
ous revelation is not imaginable. Such conjectures are only possible on the
premise that the Kita-b-i-Aqdas is a human composition and not divine reve-
lation.

It is undeniable that the Kita-b-i-Aqdas has no systematical order, and it
is absolutely legitimate to ask about the reasons, 26 but Baha-’i- scholars should
bear in mind Baha-’u’lla-h’s warning:

22   For instance in its letter of 20 July 1997.
23   In Baha-’i- Studies Review, vol. 6 (1996), pp. 93ff.
24   I dealt with this problem in Making the Crooked Straight , p. 338ff.
25   I refer to Making the Crooked Straight chapter 3, footnote 140.
26   I have dealt with this problem in Making the Crooked Straight , p. 338ff.

“Weigh not the Book of God with such standards and sciences as are
> current amongst you, for the Book is itself the unerring Balance es-
> tablished amongst men ... The measure of its weight should be
> tested according to its own standard.” 27

b. In an Encyclopaedia on the Baha-’i- Faith the author gives an account
about the execution of the Ba-b in Tabriz in 1850. Referring to the fact that
the Ba-b was found unhurt after the firing squad of 750 soldiers under the
commandment of Sam Khan had fired their bullets, he conjectures that Sam
Khan had given his soldiers the order not to hit the Ba-b. If this were right,
the whole report Shoghi Effendi has given on the circumstances and events
surrounding the execution would have to be taken as untrue. The author,
asked why he has given such an explanation of what Shoghi Effendi has
called “the miracle associated with the Ba-b’s execution”, 28 responded:
“Well, I have difficulties with miracles.”

It was, indeed, highly improbable that not a single one of the 750 bullets
hit their target, but this miraculous event does not amount to a repeal of the
laws of nature–among 1 billion cases this may happen. The author’s expla-
nation is a conjecture for which he could not give any reason. His version,
which is not a result of scientific scrutiny but based on his personal feelings
and convictions, is mere speculation, and itself very improbable: Had Sam
Khan done as the author surmises, this would have been an act of disobedi-
ence and insubordination with the risk of being betrayed by a member of
his troop and executed himself.

9. A few words on the role of Juan Ricardo Cole. He is a knowledgeable
man, trained in Near Eastern studies and history. In the 80s, he published

28   God Passes By, p. 57.

some fine pieces, among them an excellent contribution on The Concept of
Manifestation in the Baha-’i- Writings. His familiarity with Arabic and Persian
gives him access to the original holy texts, which is not only a great advan-
tage, but, indeed, a precondition for any academic research on this field.
Anyone who wants to make a scholarly analysis of Baha-’i- ethics or Baha-’i-
law for instance, should at least be acquainted with the basic theological
and legal concepts. 29

However, the knowledge of these languages, scholarly training and pro-
ficiency, important as they are, are by no means a safeguard against errone-
ous interpretations and misleading conclusions. In his recent articles Cole
has left far behind the line of a methodological positivism when he pre-
sumes to pass judgement on teachings, laws and institutions of the Baha-’-i
Faith, or when he makes uncritical use of sociological value judgements and
labels that were created in a quite different context.

He unscrupulously labels Baha-’i-s as “traditionalists” or “conservatives”
on the one hand, and “liberals” on the other, thus dividing the Baha-’i- com-
munity into antagonistic groups. What does he mean when he speaks of
“conservative Baha-’i- norms”? I can’t understand this. Is it appropriate to
call the Baha-’i- administration an “episcopal ecclesiastical order” and Ruhiy-
yih Khanum a “lay bishop”? 30 In one of his internet chats he discusses
whether the Baha-’-i community is more “church-like” or more “cult-like”.
Special sectors he detects as being “cult-like” as for instance the “norm of

> range of meaning different of those of similar terms in English” (p. 11).

shunning covenant-breakers”. 31 As I have pointed out elsewhere 32 it is not
only terminologically inaccurate to apply the term “church” to organized
non-Christian religious communities, although this is becoming more and
more usual in religious sociology, but also on material grounds wrong, be-
cause “one of the two constituent structural elements of all ecclesiastical in-
stitutions (the administration of the sacraments) is absent” 33

According to Cole’s arbitrary categorization “conservative” Baha-’i-s are
those who “support the NSA’s right to act as it pleases” 34, who advocate
pre-publication review, who believe in the infallibility of the Universal
House of Justice, who believe “that women should not be allowed to serve in
the Universal House of Justice”, that “civil government will eventually be
supplanted by the Baha-’i- institutions”, who follow “the shunning of hetero-
dox Baha-’i-s“. Conservative Baha-’i-s are “fiercely anti-intellectual and often
consider independent thinking as a sign of ‘covenant-breaking’, they are
scriptural literalists” 35.

Liberal Baha-’i-s, however, as Cole calls himself, believe “the authority of
the Universal House of Justice to be limited to legislation and admit the pos-
sibility that women will eventually serve in that body”. They are “uncom-
fortable with the practice of shunning”, they “generally reject a literalist ap-
proach to scriptures”. “Liberal Baha-’i-s“ 36 are obviously those who accept

31   If that be true, Baha-’u’lla-h would have been the founder of a “cult”, rather than of a religion.

only such parts of the divine message which “accord with their inclinations
and interests”, and who reject those verses “which are contrary to their self-
ish desires”. 37 Such people are already mentioned in the Qur’a-n:

“Believe ye then part of the Book, and deny part?” 38

I cannot discover a clear methodical structure in such unscholarly gen-
eralisations and in such an arbitrary use of purely sociological jargon. By
calling the Baha-’i- community and its order an “episcopal ecclesiastical or-
der” and a Hand of the Cause a “lay bishop” Cole clearly reveals his igno-
rance of church law from which these terms are taken.

There are hard-liners in our community who in their anti-
intellectualistic, over-vigilant and over-protective attitude generally tend to
a literalist approach to scripture, who want to escape the legitimate discus-
sion of critical issues through the intimidating warning: “This has covenan-
tal implications!”. Cole puts these people altogether into the same “conser-
vative” pot with those believers who stand firm in the Covenant, who rec-
ognize the norms given by Baha-’u’lla-h, who cling to the infallible interpreta-
tions of ‘Abdu’l-Baha- and Shoghi Effendi and who know that “shunning” is
not a later invention of those in power, as the uninformed reader of Cole’s
articles might suppose, but an integral part of the legal prescriptions of the
revelation, with other words: who are true Baha-’i-s.

When Cole does not accept the unequivocal interpretations of ‘Abdu’l-
Baha- and Shoghi Effendi, according to which women are excluded from the
membership in the Universal House of Justice, or when he denies that
‘Abdu’l-Baha- was endowed with infallibility, it becomes evident that he, who

-

38   2:79.

calls himself a “liberal Baha-’i-“, stands clearly outside the Faith. I do hope that
someone competent will write a comprehensive analysis of his methodol-
ogy. This is the only promising method to cope with this situation, which
cannot be overcome by mere administrative measures.

10. By the way, it should be seen that denotations such as “conserva-
tive”, “traditionalist” or “liberal” have been coined in the context of long his-
torical and cultural developments. It makes no sense if these terms are ap-
plied to a young religion and to a religious community which just has taken
on its legal structures. How little informative value such labels have, may be
seen from the following considerations:

Basic doctrines, principles and norms of the Baha-’-i Faith such as

> the concept of the unity of religions, the abolition of priesthood and
> monasticism, the prohibition of confession of sins, the condemnation of
> religious hatred and fanaticism, the abrogation of barriers between the
> religions and the peoples, the commandment to “consort with all relig-
> ions with amity and concord” 39, the abrogation of the concept of the
> holy war, the abrogation of the concept of “uncleanness” of semen and
> of peoples, the equality of the sexes, the unity of mankind, the idea of
> global governance and of universal world peace

may appear in the traditional categories as “progressive”, “liberal”, whereas

from membership of the Universal House of Justice and many other
laws of the Aqdas

appear to the sceptical at best as “traditional”, “conservative”, often as “fun-
damentalist” or even mediaeval. Our attitude to our scripture which we
consider word for word as the revealed Word of God is “fundamentalistic”
in the original sense of this term. What, then, is the Baha-’i- Faith, “conserva-
tive” or “liberal”?

I could not believe it, when I learned from a letter of the Universal
House of Justice to the American Baha-’i- community that Baha-’i- gay groups,
considering themselves as “liberals”, had established themselves in the
United States with the purpose of fostering a “gay Baha-’i- identity” and a
“gay Baha-’i- life” (!), although Baha-’u’lla-h has forbidden explicitly acts of
homosexuality and damned them as “satanic deeds”. Shoghi Effendi has
stated in unmistakable terms:

> “Allegiance to the Cause cannot be partial and half-hearted. Either
> we should accept the Cause without any qualification whatever or
> cease calling us Baha-’i-s.” 40

What is demanded from a true believer is “unreserved acceptance of and
submission to, whatsoever had been revealed by their Pen”. 41 A Roman
Catholic or a Muslim would not see that differently.

11. Let us come back to the question raised earlier, which is still unan-
swered, as to whether Baha-’-is who analyse and systematise their scripture,
who write scholarly articles on theological, ethical, or legal issues, who de-
fend the revelation against criticism and attack from within and outside, are

40   Quoted from Baha-’i- Procedure, p. 18.

scholars of religious studies. I have the impression that quite a number of
our scholars think so. This might be the reason why Baha-’i- apologetics has
more or less been neglected in Western Baha-’-i literature and been regarded
as being incompatible with academic method. Indeed, one cannot defend a
religion without being committed to it, without identifying oneself with it.
This seems to be in contradiction to the required absolute objectivity to
which the scholar has to be committed. Those who think so seem to be con-
demned to schizophrenia: As soon as they do scholarly work, they slip off
the garment of faith and take on that of scholarship.

I think this is a fundamental error about the role of a Baha-’i- ‘a-lim’. 42

Undoubtedly he has to be methodical and rational in his work, but another
prerequisite is loyalty to the scripture which is the indispensable frame of
reference for all his activities. Without this strict adherence to the scripture
and its authentic interpretation by the bearers of the teaching authority,
‘Abdu’l-Baha- and Shoghi Effendi, Baha-’i- doctrine would be at the mercy of
human arbitrariness, 43 at the mercy of people who, insisting on their “free-
dom of conscience”, interpret scripture according to their own inclinations
and desires. This is not allowed in any religion. I would like to refer to my pa-
per on “Baha-’-i Apologetics” and quote from it the passage relevant to my
topic:

> “. . . Religious studies incline toward historicism and reductionism:
> they tend to explain revelation from and reduce it to its historical
> and socio-cultural influences. I don’t think that it is the task of Baha-

the theologian. A theologian regards his religion from inside. He is

12. To conclude my presentation, I would like to express my firm con-
viction that the present confusion and agitation and the heated debate,
caused by dissident groups, will gradually pass when the role of Baha-’i-
studies is more clearly understood as scientia fidei. The unpleasant debate
should be taken as a thought-provoking opportunity for developing clear
views of an adequate Baha-’-i methodology.

The central purpose of Baha-’i- studies should be the analysis of the holy
texts; the analytical and systematic development of, and the philosophical
reflection on, the doctrines and principles enshrined in the revelation of
Baha-’u’lla-h; the clarification of the fundamentals of the Faith, the correla-
tion of Baha-’i- teachings with aspects of philosophy and science and of social
and political issues, and, last but not least, the development of Baha-’i- apolo-
getics, which has to demonstrate the credibility and plausibility of the re-
vealed truth, to defend the Faith against the assaults of those “who sow
seeds of doubt in the hearts of the believers”, 46 and to respond to defama-

tory accusations, levelled against the Faith. In other words: the fundamental
purpose of Baha-’i- studies is the development of a comprehensive Baha-’i-
theology. 47

What is required from the scholars besides knowledge, competence and
proficiency, are the virtues of patience, self-discipline, moderation, candour
and courtesy. By the same token, the community and its institutions need to
create an atmosphere of mutual respect, tolerance and forbearance, in or-
der to overcome that spirit of distrust, suspicion and rigid intolerance that
have impeded Baha-’-i studies for so long and which, in the final analysis, are
responsible for the present situation.
