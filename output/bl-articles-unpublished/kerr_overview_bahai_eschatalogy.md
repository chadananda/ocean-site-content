## An Overview of Bahá'í Eschatology, in a Tapestry of Four Strands

### by [Bernardo Bortolin Kerr](https://bahai-library.com/author/Bernardo+Bortolin+Kerr)

2016


> **Abstract:** This paper represents an attempt to highlight and draw together four main threads in the Bahá'í conception of Apocalypse, or Revelation. It begins with a survey of some of the more notable examples of scholarship brought to my attention on the theme and goes on to introduce a selection of significant references to Apocalypse in the Bahá'í writings. The majority of the essay is then spent identifying and delineating the four strands I consider integral to an understanding of Bahá'í eschatology: God's eternal Revelation by means of His reflection, to varying degrees, in all created things; the Apocalypse inherent in the appearance to humanity of Manifestations of God (divine Messengers such as Christ, Muhammad and Bahá'u'lláh); the progressive nature of these appearances in the manner in which each new Revelation marks a Day of Judgement and a Day of Resurrection for those preceding it; the historical manifestation of Apocalypse. I conclude by tying these strands together in an exploration of the process by which God's eternal presence becomes manifested in the world.

                        An Overview of Bahá’í Eschatology,

In a Tapestry of Four Strands

Bernardo Bortolin Kerr

Various notable scholarly works have been written on eschatological and
apocalyptic themes in the Bahá’í Faith. Khazeh Fananapazir, for instance, offers a
survey of references that aid in the understanding of Hájí Mihdí Armand’s claim “that
the day of Bahá’u’lláh is Yawm Alláh (the Day of God) and is the Day that was to
come.”1 He draws on Biblical and Islamic sources to trace a line that culminates in the
Bahá’í Revelation. Meanwhile, Ross Woodman adopts a distinctly mystical approach
in his essays, exploring the apocalyptic nature of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation, as the
enactment of a spiritual marriage between the masculine and feminine aspects of
Revelation and creation,2 and as the birth of a new creation, emerging from the passing
away of an old world.3 Writers such as J.E. Esslemont,4 George Townshend5 and John
Ferraby6 touch upon the theme in their well-known introductions to the Bahá’í Faith,
and it is found in numerous others besides these. Todd Lawson7 and Christopher Buck8
both address the subject of Revelation and Apocalypse in scriptural and hermeneutical
terms in their erudite academic texts. Walied Jassat9 and Zaid Lundberg10 provide
broad overviews of Bahá’í eschatology, the former a personal narrative drawing on
diverse religious sources, and the latter focused principally on the concept of
progressive revelation.

However, the majority of scholarly articles explicitly and primarily written on the
subject of Bahá’í apocalypticism and eschatology assume a historical perspective.
Stephen Lambden’s article “Catastrophe, Armageddon and Millennium”11 provides an
excellent illustration of this tendency. Characteristically well researched, the piece
opens with a brief survey of Biblical, Islamic and Bahá’í references to apocalyptic
catastrophe, while the remainder is chiefly concerned with twentieth century
fulfilments of apocalyptic prophecies and the question of how Bahá’ís might be
situated in relation to the millennialist traditions of the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries. William Collins is similarly engaged with discourses on the status and nature

of Bahá’í millennialism, responding to Lambden in a later article12 and providing an
excellent analysis of Bahá’í apocalyptic prophecies that herald both cataclysm and
universal peace, and the reception by the Bahá’í community of such prophecies.13
Moojan Momen has also written extensively on the subject and his essay “Apocalyptic
Thinking and Process Thinking: A Bahá’í Contribution to Religious Thought” is
particularly illuminating, detailing the ways in which the Bahá’í Revelation has
effected profound transformations in the religious conception of apocalypse and its
relationship to social betterment.14 These pieces emerged out of a need to survey,
understand and respond to certain trends that arose in the Bahá’í world in the twentieth
century, in which an inclination towards speculation and interpretation was somewhat
prevalent in the western community’s conception of apocalypse. Perhaps these trends
were remnants of earlier traditions of eschatology, particularly forms of Biblical
exegesis that preoccupied with the predicting of dates for major events of divine
revelation. In any case, these articles are exemplary in their historical treatment of
Apocalypse.

Cognisant of such valuable and scholarly contributions to the subject of Bahá’í
eschatology, the aim of this article is to offer, humbly, a broader overview of the
Bahá’í conception of Apocalypse, highlighting four main threads in this highly
significant theme. While the aforementioned works, particularly those noted above as
being historically oriented, have focused primarily on certain facets of Bahá’í
eschatology, in this essay I hope to present my topic as a rich tapestry, comprising
multiple interwoven strands, which, although vastly diverse in their languages, are
inextricable from one another. While the historical interpretation of eschatology is
indispensable, as repeatedly evidenced in the writings of Shoghi Effendi, it can only be
illuminated more brightly when viewed in the light of theological and mystical
components, and vice versa. Indeed, to focus only on the historical expression of
Apocalypse is to leave out an understanding of the fundamental Reality that is revealed
in history, while by concentrating only on the theological and mystical we perhaps fail
to perceive how such spiritual principles can be manifested in humanity.

Introduction: Apocalypse in the Bahá’í Writings

The word “apocalypse” is rarely found in the scriptural and authoritative texts of
the Bahá’í Faith, but the notion it refers to runs throughout these writings, playing
different roles and relating to diverse religious traditions. It plays an important part in
the Bahá’í concept of “progressive revelation”, which asserts that every major religion
brings a new stage in humanity’s progress, together constituting a single continual
process of divine revelation. Every religion is seen to come from God, while
differences between religions are understood to be the result of variations in the
conditions of the time and place of revelation, as well as the capacity and receptivity of
the society to which they were revealed. The essence of every religion is one and the
same, but its expression must be revealed fittingly for each new dispensation,

Thought,” in Lights of ‘Irfán Volume 13, ed. Iraj Ayman, 243-270 (Evanston, Ill.: ‘Irfán Colloquia,
2012)

“renewed, reformed, revoiced to mankind.” 15 The treatment of the apocalyptic
prophecies of other religious traditions plays a crucial role in clarifying the progressive
succession of one Revelation to the next. As Stephen Lambden notes, Bahá’í Scripture
interprets the theme “sometimes literally, sometimes spiritually, and occasionally in
both these ways”. He observes that “both the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh undertook a
courageous demythologization of apocalyptic scenarios anticipated in Biblical and
Islamic scripture and tradition.” 16 Throughout the Bahá’í writings allusions to
Apocalypse, or Revelation, perform the dual function of both instilling in the believers
the urgent need to recognise and follow Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings, while also celebrating
the eternal presence of God and the fulfilment of all past prophecies in the Bahá’í
Revelation.

There are references in the Bahá’í writings to an “unforeseen calamity”,17 a
“Catastrophe”18 and a “Day of Judgement”,19 variously referencing the Old and New
Testaments, the Qur’án and hadiths, as well as the extensive traditions on this theme in
Shí’ah Islam, particularly its Twelver branch. Bahá’u’lláh describes an event “which
shall cause the limbs of mankind to quake”,20 while Shoghi Effendi writes of an
“apocalyptic upheaval”.21 In another passage, Bahá’u’lláh warns the reader:

> There is no place of refuge for you, no asylum to which ye can flee, no one to
> defend or to protect you in this Day from the fury of the wrath of God and from
> His vehement power, unless and until ye seek the shadow of His Revelation.22

It might be fruitful, then, to consider Bahá’u’lláh’s declaration in The Hidden
Words: “My calamity is My providence, outwardly it is fire and vengeance, but
inwardly it is light and mercy. Hasten thereunto that thou mayest become an eternal
light and an immortal spirit.”23 Indeed, throughout all the references in the Bahá’í
writings to such an earth-shattering event there are also inseparable allusions to a
“Divine Springtime”,24 a “wondrous Day”25 and a “Day of Resurrection”.26 Emphasis is
placed on the eternal and imperishable nature of the joy found at the heart of God’s
Revelation, when one turns to it. Bahá’u’lláh proclaims:

> In this Day a great festival is taking place in the Realm above; for whatsoever was
> promised in the sacred Scriptures hath been fulfilled. This is the Day of great
> rejoicing. It behooveth everyone to hasten towards the court of His nearness with

exceeding joy, gladness, exultation and delight and to deliver himself from the fire
of remoteness.27

These twin forces that characterise the transformative nature of Revelation, with
its profound upheaval and cataclysm, but also its ultimate and “inward” joy, peace and
salvation, are expressed and clarified throughout the diverse aspects of Bahá’í
eschatology. It is important to note that Apocalypse, in this complete sense, is not
envisaged solely as an event that will simply befall a passive humanity, but instead
every description is a call for some form of active response, both as individuals and as
the human race, to realise the universally salvific character of Revelation. While its
effects on creation are seen to be inevitable and inexorable it is also understood that
human beings have agency to accept or deny its teachings and influence, and live in
accordance with it or in defiance against it. Moreover, the human being is cast as the
being in creation most profoundly stirred by the Revelation and as such is recognised
as the primary instrument for the advancement and betterment of the world. In other
words, Revelation manifests itself in the transformation of all created things, in a world
suffused with agency. In the last sections of this paper we will examine more closely
the way such choices are viewed.

Moojan Momen points out that the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh came to a populace, both
in Persia and globally, who largely subscribed to the understanding that religious
change and its effects upon social reality would come about through miraculous divine
intervention, in which “Humans would for the most part, especially in relation to the
events of the Day of Resurrection, be passive participants.”28 He examines the way in
which the Bábí and Bahá’í Dispensations initiated a change in religious thinking,
casting humanity at the heart of a process of transformation shaped at all levels by the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. Four distinctly definable but entirely inextricable strands
can be identified within this theme, and together they weave a rich and nuanced
conception of Apocalypse.

The Ever-Present Apocalypse, or “Universal Revelation”

Given the widely held conception of the Apocalypse, or the last days, as simply
the end point of the universe’s linear timeline, it is necessary to recognise that in the
Bahá’í teachings such a notion is viewed as incomplete. While Apocalypse is also
treated in these teachings as an event in time, which we will go on to examine in the
next three strands, it is first necessary to understand what such an Apocalypse would
reveal (acknowledging its original meaning of ‘unveiling’) and what the event would
ultimately constitute. Can these references simply relate to the physical end of the
physical universe, or is there a relationship between temporality and eternality that
renders their significance broader and deeper? Of particular significance in this
connection is Bahá’u’lláh’s assertion that “The process of His creation hath had no
beginning, and can have no end.”29 Indeed, there are references throughout the Bahá’í
writings to “the beginning that hath no beginning” and “the end that hath no end”.30
This suggests that, while we may speak of a beginning and an end, these concepts
cannot be divorced from that of God’s eternal presence.

\[29\] Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings, 61

\[30\] Found throughout the Bahá’í writings, notably in Bahá’u’lláh, Summons, 39

In the Kitáb-i-Íqán, Bahá’u’lláh explores in depth the notion of Revelation as
“attainment unto the Presence of God”, 31 distinguishing and analysing three
conceptions of this notion. The first of these is the notion of the “Universal
Revelation”, which is the eternal presence of God, as reflected in all things. He asserts,
reminding us of the need for the active purification of our spiritual senses,

> were man to gaze with the eye of divine and spiritual discernment, he will readily
> recognize that nothing whatsoever can exist without the revelation of God, the
> ideal King. Consider how all created things eloquently testify to the revelation of
> that inner Light within them.32

In this sense the Apocalypse, as the uncovering of God’s presence, is eternally present
at the heart of all things. In his analysis of the notion of the “Day of God”, Khazeh
Fananapazir cites Cruden’s Complete Concordance to the Old and New Testaments,
which suggests that such a “Day” might be considered to exist “from all eternity, in
which there is no succession, no yesterday, no tomorrow but it is all one continued day
or moment without change or flux; or it may refer to the manifestation of Christ’s
eternal sonship in time.”33

Implicit in this sense of Revelation, therefore, is also one of concealment from
those who look to created things without seeking the infinite presence of God reflected
in them. This might be compared to the fragmented and darkened view of reality
described by St Paul in 1 Corinthians, which nevertheless always holds the possibility
of clarity: “For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in
part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.” (ESV, 1 Corinthians
13:12) Therefore, references in the Bahá’í writings to the effacement of all created
things – such as Bahá’u’lláh’s proclamation of the Day of God, “Lo, the entire creation
hath passed away!” – can perhaps be understood to mean the passing away of the dross
that covers the reflection of God in the mirror of creation. As the passage goes on to
describe, “Nothing remaineth except My Face, the Ever-Abiding, the Resplendent, the
All-Glorious.”34

However, the removal of this dross (a process much discussed in the Bahá’í
writings) is dependent upon the purification of one’s own relationship with God. As
such, while Bahá’u’lláh Himself recognises and announces the eternal presence of God
in all things as the Day of God, such a reality passes the rest of humanity by, to varying
degrees. As the Báb writes in the Persian Bayán,

> The Day of Resurrection is a day on which the sun riseth and setteth like unto any
> other day. How oft hath the Day of Resurrection dawned, and the people of the
> land where it occurred did not learn of the event.35

And in another passage from the same book:

> The revelation of the Divine Reality hath everlastingly been identical with its
> concealment and its concealment identical with its revelation. That which is
> intended by ‘Revelation of God’ is the Tree of divine Truth that betokeneth none

but Him, and it is this divine Tree that hath raised and will raise up Messengers,
and hath revealed and will ever reveal Scriptures.36

Revealed in all things, God is, then, “the most manifest of the manifest and the most
hidden of the hidden”37 – the fundamental Reality we cannot perceive, recognise or
align ourselves with if we fail to acknowledge the signs of God and instead look to the
finitude of worldly things.

The Messengers as Apocalypse, or the “Secondary Revelation of God”

This ties us inextricably to the second strand, which Bahá’u’lláh names the
“Secondary Revelation of God”,38 and which corresponds to the revelation of God
through the figures referred to in the Bahá’í writings as “Manifestations of God”; a
designation that includes all the divine Originators of the major world religions.
Paraphrasing ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi writes, “at the time of the Manifestation
the veils are very thin, so to speak.”39 Each Manifestation of God possesses the same
nature that reveals the presence of God, precisely because their relationship with Him
is so mysteriously intertwined. Considering, as we saw in the previous strand, that all
created things reflect God, we may view the Manifestations as the complete reflection
of God’s light in creation. Bahá’u’lláh writes:

> Upon the inmost reality of each and every created thing He hath shed the light of
> one of His names, and made it a recipient of the glory of one of His attributes.
> Upon the reality of man, however, He hath focused the radiance of all of His
> names and attributes, and made it a mirror of His own Self.40

The Manifestations of God are, therefore, the perfectly clean mirrors “that truly and
faithfully reflect the light of God.”41 As such, the “Universal Revelation” of the first
strand is in some sense incomplete without this second strand.

Between the clarifications of these two notions of Revelation in the Kitáb-i-Íqán,
Bahá’u’lláh writes of a concept referred to as the “Specific Revelation of God”,
meaning access, as a human being, to “the innermost Essence” of God.42 He describes
this as impossible to anyone but God, with the explanation that the Manifestations of
God are the points in creation that are cleansed of all the dross of the world and are
thus enabled to reflect all of God’s names and attributes, which are engraved on the
human heart, but are not themselves human beings who have somehow accessed or
become God’s Essence. Shoghi Effendi clarifies the nature of the Manifestations of
God, emphasising that “the complete incarnation of the names and attributes of God in
so exalted a Person should, under no circumstances, be misconceived or
misinterpreted”, distinguishing between God’s revelation through these figures in
creation and the “eternal Essence of Essences”, which is God in “His infinite, His

unknowable, His incorruptible and all-embracing Reality”.43 Later in the same text he
quotes a striking passage from Bahá’u’lláh:

> When I contemplate, O my God, the relationship that bindeth me to Thee, […] I
> am moved to proclaim to all created things ‘verily I am God!’; and when I
> consider my own self, lo, I find it coarser than clay!44

Therefore, given the inaccessibility of God’s Essence for humanity, it is through
the Manifestations of God that we “attain unto the Divine Presence”. Bahá’u’lláh
states: “The knowledge of Him, Who is the Origin of all things, and attainment unto
Him, are impossible save through knowledge of, and attainment unto, these luminous
Beings who proceed from the Sun of Truth.”45 The Bahá’í teachings speak of an
“Eternal Covenant” between God and humanity in which God promises to send
Manifestations throughout all eternity. This second strand of Bahá’í eschatology refers
to the appearance of these Figures. In the Persian Bayán the Báb states that the “Day
of Resurrection” is the phase lasting “from the time of the appearance of Him Who is
the Tree of divine Reality, at whatever period and under whatever name, until the
moment of His disappearance”. 46 Michael Sours has suggested that, in light of
statements made in the Kitáb-i-Íqán, this period should be viewed as that lasting from
the time of a Manifestation’s proclamation of His message, to the time of the next
Manifestation’s proclamation.47

The Apocalypse of a New Dispensation

While in the first two strands mention of calamity has been mostly attenuated
and implicit, with the grace of attaining God’s presence and the mercy of God’s
promise to eternally send guidance through Manifestations accentuated, it is in the last
two that the eternal becomes more explicitly interwoven with the temporal and we see
the effects in history of such events. These effects are both integrative, when humanity
moves with the forces released by the coming of a Manifestation, whether consciously
or otherwise, and disintegrative, when humanity denies itself God’s guidance and grace
– but it should be borne in mind that all these events are inwardly “light and mercy”.

The third strand relates to the key concept of “progressive revelation”. Rather
than merely a cyclical repetition of God’s message to humanity, this process is the
impetus that drives humanity’s progress as an “ever-advancing civilization”.48 In this
sense, the coming of each new Manifestation of God marks the Day of Judgement and
the Day of Resurrection for the preceding dispensation. In a letter to the Sherif of
Mecca, who failed to respond to the Báb’s summons to accept the new Revelation, the
Báb admonishes him that although he has worshipped God his whole life he has now
failed to recognise the Manifestation of God: “Thus hath Thy Lord put thee to proof in
the Day of Resurrection.”49 In the Persian Bayán the Báb puts forward this conception
of Apocalypse clearly and concisely, stating that each Manifestation of God calls the
believers of the past dispensation to recognise the essence of God’s eternal Revelation

in its renewed expression. He refers to Jesus Christ, for example, “Who rewarded by
His Word everyone who believed in Moses, and punished by His Word everyone who
did not believe; inasmuch as God’s Testimony for that Day was that which He had
solemnly affirmed in the Gospel.”50

Mírzá Abú’l-Faḍl expounds on this theme in one brief passage,51 asserting that
the terms “Return” and “Resurrection” refer to the time in which God’s message to
humanity is renewed through the coming of a new Manifestation. He emphasises the
common spiritual essence of God’s Messengers, narrating the time prophesied in each
Dispensation “when all that had transpired would be played out once more, retracing
each footstep.” He goes on to describe how “The prepared souls would be awaiting the
appearance of Manifestations of God and watching for the reappearance of a primal
reality.” This suggests the need for a certain spiritual perceptivity that is able to see the
“primal reality” of the past Messengers of God in the new Manifestation, despite
changes of time, place and appearance, and, perhaps most importantly, despite an
overwhelming lack of acceptance from the vast majority of society. He further
expresses how in this way “exalted souls would be raised from the tombs of their
bodies” at the time of the coming of the Manifestation. This account, then, denotes the
dual requirements of preparation and recognition if one is to attain to that Day of
Resurrection foretold in all Holy Scriptures and never withheld from humanity. As
Bahá’u’lláh emphatically states, “Whoso hath been re-born in this Day, shall never die;
whoso remaineth dead, shall never live.”52 Thus, in this strand there is not only the
glory of “attaining unto the Divine Presence” through the Manifestations of God in
general, but also the challenge of recognising and accepting the new chapter of God’s
continual Revelation and not becoming attached to the “outward forms” of religion –
its laws, ceremonies and dogmas.

While both the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh are recognised as Manifestations of God, the
roles each play are understood to be different from one another. The Báb is recognised
as the Herald of the Bahá’í Revelation and as the Qá’im (He Who arises) or Mihdí
(One Who is guided) of Islam. However, it should be emphasised that “the greatness of
the Báb consists primarily, not in His being the divinely-appointed Forerunner of so
transcendent a Revelation,” but rather in His station of “independent Prophethood”, as
the “inaugurator of a separate religious Dispensation”.53 This Dispensation lasted only
nine years before “the burden of the promised Cause of God was cast amidst the gloom
and agony of the Síyáh-Chál of Ṭihrán”,54 where Bahá’u’lláh was imprisoned and
received His Revelation. Bahá’u’lláh, meanwhile, is recognised as “the Promised One
of all ages”, a station clarified by Shoghi Effendi as fulfilling the eschatological
prophecies of all past religions. He writes:

> To Israel He was neither more nor less than the incarnation of the ‘Everlasting
> Father,’ the ‘Lord of Hosts’ come down ‘with ten thousands of saints’; to
> Christendom Christ returned ‘in the glory of the Father,’ to Shí’ah Islám the return
> of the Imám Ḥusayn; to Sunní Islám the descent of the ‘Spirit of God’ (Jesus
> Christ); to the Zoroastrians the promised Sháh-Bahrám; to the Hindus the
> reincarnation of Krishna; to the Buddhists the fifth Buddha.55

He goes on to expand on each of these claims with references from the writings of each
tradition.56

along with his father, was notorious for his merciless persecution of Bahá’ís – a long
paragraph is spent in an imagined dialogue with individuals who question the advent of
the Apocalypse. Questions are raised such as, “Hath the Catastrophe come to pass?”;
“Is the Resurrection come?”; “When were the heavens cleft asunder?” and Bahá’u’lláh
answers in the affirmative to every one, announcing that those who did not recognise
such an event remained heedless because while it passed they “lay in the graves of
waywardness and error” and in the “cradle of idle fancies”. 57 In Some Answered
Questions ‘Abdu’l-Bahá interprets the three woes of the Book of Revelation to be
Muhammad, the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, “for in that day woe is upon the heedless and the
sinners, and the ignorant.”58

A corollary to the notion of progressive revelation from one Manifestation of
God to the next is the concept of “universal cycles”. In the Bahá’í writings the Báb is
described as signalising “the termination of the ‘Prophetic Cycle’ and the inception of
the ‘Cycle of Fulfilment,’”59 thus marking a similar point in time to that mentioned
above. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states, “We are in the cycle which began with Adam and whose
universal Manifestation is Bahá’u’lláh.”60

The Historical Apocalypse

Finally we come to the fourth strand, which relates to recorded historical events
such as wars and revolutions, as well as technological, scientific and social changes
and advances. Throughout the Bahá’í writings these are understood as effects and signs
of the presence of the Manifestations of God and the profoundly transformative forces
of their revelations. To take two examples from the writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

> All things are now made new. Arts and industries have been reborn, there are new
> discoveries in science, and there are new inventions; even the details of human
> affairs, such as dress and personal effects – even weapons – all these have likewise
> been renewed. The laws and procedures of every government have been revised.61

And in another passage: “When the holy, divine Manifestations or Prophets appear in
the world, a cycle of radiance, an age of mercy dawns. Everything is renewed.”62 As
such, this strand is tightly bound with the divine nature of the previous three, despite
relating to events that might be located as much on a secular timeline as a religious
one.

Bearing in mind the two aspects of Bahá’í eschatology discussed throughout this
article – the catastrophic and the salvific – it might be useful to consider a theme
greatly explored by Shoghi Effendi. At various points in his writings, in which the
“mixed literary, historical, and theological threads of the text are woven into one

apocalyptic language”,63 he examines the processes of integration and disintegration,
describing them as

> aspects of a greater Plan, one and indivisible, whose Source is God, whose author
> is Bahá’u’lláh, the theater of whose operations is the entire planet, and whose
> ultimate objectives are the unity of the human race and the peace of all mankind.64

In this conception of history, the “vibrating influence”65 of the twin revelations of
the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh has stirred all created things to respond to the divine call for
universal oneness. On the one hand, the integrative force of universal love, peace and
equality contributes to the steady establishment of a new civilisation founded on the
Bahá’í laws, ordinances and teachings of humanity’s essential oneness. It “unfolds a
System which may well serve as a pattern for that world polity towards which a
strangely-disordered world is continually advancing”. On the other hand, the
disintegrative force characterised by prejudice, war and injustice has heightened its
corrosive effects on a crumbling and outmoded world order, hastening its collapse; this
force, “as its disintegrating influence deepens, tends to tear down, with increasing
violence, the antiquated barriers that seek to block humanity’s progress towards its
destined goal.” While one process “stands associated with the nascent Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh”, working steadfastly to cultivate a new system in full cognisance of the
present state of humanity and the message delivered to it by God for this age, the other
“should be identified with a civilization that has refused to answer to the expectation of
a new age, and is consequently falling into chaos and decline” – it both results from
and dismantles a system that has failed to acknowledge its own demise or recognise its
salvation. 66

Far from viewing these twin forces as existing in a simplistic binary opposition,
one battling to overcome the other, both are seen as inexorably leading to the same
ultimate establishment of world unity and peace – the first progressing consciously
towards this goal, the other leading towards it through its own continual undoing.
There is a profound hope to be found in such a concept: the catastrophes we see
erupting the world over are simply the “ominous signs simultaneously proclaiming the
agonies of a disintegrating civilization and the birth pangs of that World Order – that
Ark of human salvation – that must needs arise upon its ruins.”67 This has profound
implications for the activities of the Bahá’í community and its engagement with
broader society. The Universal House of Justice has continually emphasised that “To
enter into the quixotic tournament of demolishing one by one the evils in the world is,
to a Bahá’í, a vain waste of time and effort.” Rather, “Their whole energy is directed
towards the building of the good, a good which has such a positive strength that in the
face of it the multitude of evils – which are in essence negative – will fade away and be
no more.”68

Bahá’ís recognise direct references in the writings of both ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and
Shoghi Effendi to the First and Second World Wars, in which these events are

identified with the cataclysmic prophecies of the past.69 In October 1912 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
spoke at Stanford University: “We are on the eve of the battle of Armageddon, referred
to in the sixteenth chapter of Revelation. The time is two years hence, when only a
spark will set aflame the whole of Europe.”70 From 1927 to 1939 Shoghi Effendi made
several allusions that Bahá’ís understand to have been referring to the Second World
War, writing of “another deadly encounter”71 and stating, “The rumblings that must
precede the eruption of those forces that must cause ‘the limbs of humanity to quake’
can already be heard. ‘The time of the end,’ ‘the latter years,’ as foretold in the
Scriptures, are at long last upon us.”72 In later texts he goes on to make it clear that he
does not consider these two cataclysmic events to have marked the completion of the
apocalyptic processes of “calamity” and “disintegration”. For instance, in a letter to an
individual dated 8 January 1949 he writes that

> it seems apparent that the great failure to respond to Bahá’u’lláh’s instructions,
> appeals and warnings issued in the 19th century, has now sent the world along a
> path, or released forces, which must culminate in a still more violent upheaval and
> agony. The thing is out of hand, so to speak, and it is too late to avert catastrophic
> trials.73

However, inseparable from these conceptions of the Apocalypse is the prophecy
of universal peace and unity, which will emerge through the effects associated with the
events mentioned above. Bahá’u’lláh described two major phases in the establishment
of this coming age of harmony, referring to the first as the “Lesser Peace” and the
second as the “Most Great Peace” (we might note here Moojan Momen’s argument
that in the Bahá’í writings they are treated as “intertwined and evolving together”74
rather than necessarily sequential to one another). The Lesser Peace is defined as a
secular and political peace, brought about largely by the coming together of world
leaders in order to “convene an all-inclusive assembly, which either they themselves or
their ministers will attend, and to enforce whatever measures are required to establish
unity and concord amongst men.”75 The Most Great Peace, on the other hand, entails
“the spiritualization of the world and the fusion of all its races, creeds, classes and
nations”76 in a World Commonwealth that accepts Bahá’u’lláh’s station, laws and
teachings, and takes as its watchwords the principles of “unity in diversity” and the
“Oneness of Mankind – the pivot round which all the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh
revolve”.77

William Collins identifies several periods about which apocalyptic predictions
have been made within the Bahá’í community in the twentieth century, particularly in
the West. He emphasises, however, that neither the Bahá’í writings nor the Bahá’í

\[69\] It is also noteworthy that on page 53 (paragraph 90) of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas Bahá’u’lláh writes
portentously, “O banks of the Rhine! We have seen you covered with gore, inasmuch as the swords of
retribution were drawn against you; and you shall have another turn. And We hear the lamentations of
Berlin, though she be today in conspicuous glory.”

Administration support the assertions made in such instances.78 A Syrian Bahá’í named
Ibrahim Kheiralla, who came from a Christian background and moved to the United
States in 1892, made the first of these predictions. Citing the prophesy in the Book of
Daniel concerning 1,335 days, Kheiralla claimed that the year 1917, which is the year
1335 in the Islamic calendar, would mark the establishment of universal peace,
following a period of war and calamity. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá made clear that such an event
would not be ushered in at that particular point, but did make reference to Daniel’s
prophecy, with indications in authenticated manuscripts to its fulfilment in both 1957
and 1963. However, as Shoghi Effendi clarifies, there is no suggestion in ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s words that either of these years would coincide with the dawn of universal
peace: “in the Bahá’í teachings themselves there is nothing to indicate that any definite
degree of world peace will be established by 1957, nor by 1963”.79 Rather, in these
years the most significant events witnessed in the Bahá’í calendar were the passing of
Shoghi Effendi and the establishment of the Universal House of Justice respectively. A
more overarching expectation within the Bahá’í community spanned the whole of the
twentieth century, with a particular focus on the year 2000. This belief was influenced
considerably by a letter written by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in which seven principles integral to
the foundation of world unity are enunciated, with each one referred to as a “candle”.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes the fifth candle as “the unity of nations – a unity which in this
century will be securely established, causing all the peoples of the world to regard
themselves as citizens of one common fatherland.”80 Highlighting this and other similar
statements made by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, a significant number of Bahá’ís in the West adhered
to the view that the Lesser Peace would be entirely in place by the end of the twentieth
century.

Aside from Shoghi Effendi’s own attempts to discourage such inclinations
toward the setting of specific dates, the Universal House of Justice also released
several statements on these matters, emphasising that Bahá’ís should see the
establishment of the Lesser Peace and in turn the Most Great Peace as a process rather
than a set of events miraculously birthed by cataclysms and catastrophes. In a letter
dated 29 July 1974 the Universal House of Justice cites Shoghi Effendi:

> All we know is that the Lesser and the Most Great Peace will come – their exact
> dates we do not know. The same is true as regards the possibility of a future war;
> we cannot state dogmatically it will or will not take place – all we know is that
> mankind must suffer and be punished sufficiently to make it turn to God.

They go on to advise, “It is apparent that the disintegration of the old order is
accelerating, but the friends should not permit this inevitable process to deter them
from giving their undivided attention to the tasks lying immediately before them.”81 A
19 April 2001 letter to an individual believer addressed issues raised concerning “the
timing for the occurrence of the Lesser Peace, in light of your impression that the
Bahá'í Writings anticipate its coming before the conclusion of the twentieth century”.82

In the letter “an orientation to process” is encouraged, while drawing attention to the
understanding that the

Included in the letter is a memorandum from the Research Department at the Bahá’í
World Centre, titled Attainment of the Unity of Nations and the Lesser Peace, which
collates numerous passages and statements from the Bahá’í writings that point to both
significant events and the need for a conception of the establishment of universal peace
as an unfolding process to which Bahá’ís must contribute following the principles and
guidance of the Bahá’í teachings.

In dispelling the gloom of speculation and fear regarding the calamities foreseen
in the Bahá’í writings, a 1 July 1984 message from the International Teaching Centre
to the Continental Board of Counsellors in the Americas is equally illuminating. In the
document, titled Pilgrims’ Notes and the “Calamity”, the International Teaching
Centre collates excerpts from numerous letters of Shoghi Effendi and the Universal
House of Justice, clarifying firstly the non-authoritative status of pilgrims’ notes and
secondly the lack of grounding for speculations on, and the detrimental nature of
preoccupations with, any impending cataclysmic upheavals. Finally, the letter draws
from authoritative sources elucidating the way in which Bahá’ís should respond to any
such events. With an attitude free of fear and uncertainty, the Bahá’í community is
urged to seek an understanding of the integrative and disintegrative forces depicted by
Shoghi Effendi and work steadfastly to contribute to the effects of the former by
imbuing our communities and the world at large with the spirit of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Revelation. The letter can perhaps be summarised by two excerpts quoted in the
document and drawn from two separate letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi. He
urges the Bahá’ís, when observing the conditions of the world, “Let us be reminded of
our duty by the misery we see around us, and arise for the prosecution of our noble
duty.”83 He provides the assurance, “What they are doing will release forces which will
combat the terrible disintegration of society which we witness today in every field,
political, economic or otherwise.”84

Conclusion: The Process of Revelation

In order to gain a fuller understanding of the Bahá’í conception of Apocalypse,
or Revelation – to use a less loaded synonym – its relationship with time and history
and, most crucially, the role of humanity as its recipients, it is necessary to take into
consideration its various nuanced facets, which I have attempted to classify and outline
in this paper. As Shoghi Effendi elegantly notes, “One might liken Bahá’u’lláh’s
teachings to a sphere; there are points poles apart, and in between the thoughts and

\[84\] Written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, To an Individual Believer, 5 July 1947, as quoted in International
Teaching Centre, “Calamity”

doctrines that unite them.”85 In the first strand presented in this paper we saw the
notion of Revelation as the eternal, unchanging heart of creation, while in the last
strand we saw Revelation embodied in the swelling and stirring contours of history,
evidenced in the upheavals and tectonic shifts through which humanity passes century
upon century in its previously unimagined discoveries, advances and catastrophes.
Between these poles we found the episodic arrival of the Manifestations of God,
viewed on the one hand as the fulfilment of God’s part of His Eternal Covenant with
humanity – the unceasing return to the world, at periodic points in history, of one and
the same primal reality; and on the other hand as the divine Inaugurators of distinct and
unprecedented epochs in the ever-progressing life of humanity.

Perhaps at the core of these notions, uniting their apparently disparate
coordinates, is an acknowledgement of the human being’s mysterious relationship with
his Creator. Made in the image and likeness of God, imbued with the potential of
reflecting all His divine names and attributes, the nature of the human spirit “inclines it
towards transcendence, a reaching towards an invisible realm, towards the ultimate
reality, that unknowable Essence of essences called God.”86 Situated as we are between
the material and the spiritual, our innate purpose has ever been and will continue to be,
on the one hand, to know God and to worship Him, and on the other to “carry forward
an ever-advancing civilisation”. Each aspect depends upon the other, as we strive to
manifest the eternal attributes of God – attributes such as love, justice and unity – in
the transient world of creation. Bahá’u’lláh exhorts us, “Regard man as a mine rich in
gems of inestimable value. Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and
enable mankind to benefit therefrom.”87

The Bahá’í writings teach us that such an education originates in the Revelation
brought to humanity by the Manifestations of God, the “universal Educators”. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá tells us, “the universal Educator must be at once a material, a human, and a
spiritual educator, and, soaring above the world of nature, must be possessed of
another power, so that He may assume the station of a divine teacher.”88 He must be
capable of delivering teachings, perfectly suited to the needs of the age, that shed new
light into the realms of physical health and wellbeing, human civilisation and
advancement, and, fundamentally, the development of spiritual qualities that mirror
forth the attributes of God. These Educators are the Manifestations of God. Bahá’u’lláh
asserts,

> [God] hath ordained that in every age and dispensation a pure and stainless Soul be
> made manifest in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. Unto this subtle, this
> mysterious and ethereal Being He hath assigned a twofold nature; the physical,
> pertaining to the world of matter, and the spiritual, which is born of the substance
> of God Himself. He hath, moreover, conferred upon Him a double station. The
> first station, which is related to His innermost reality, representeth Him as One
> Whose voice is the voice of God Himself. […] The second station is the human
> station[.]89

The earthly lives of these Manifestations initiate immeasurably profound
transformations in the life of humanity and provide in each dispensation a repository of
divine wisdom and guidance in the form of the written Word of God. Bahá’u’lláh
proclaims, “It is incumbent upon every man of insight and understanding to strive to
translate that which hath been written into reality and action.”90

‘Abdu’l-Bahá furthermore declares, “The Kingdom of peace, salvation,
uprightness and reconciliation is founded in the Invisible World, and it will by degrees
become manifest and apparent through the power of the Word of God!”91 In this
sentence alone we can identify the first strand, in the eternal nature of the “Invisible
World”, and the fourth strand, in the temporal and progressive process implied in the
“degrees” by which humanity will attain to “peace, salvation, uprightness and
reconciliation”. Meanwhile the second and third strands, representing the shared
eternal nature of every Manifestation of God, as well as their progressive appearances,
are evoked in the mention of “the power of the Word of God”, without which the
invisible potentialities God has imbued in creation could not be brought forth into the
physical world. Bahá’u’lláh affirms that God has ordained, as a token of His mercy and
bounty, that this infinitely transformative power be released and brought to bear
through a participatory and active process, rather than simply by means of a divine
cataclysm meted out upon a passive humanity:

> If it be Our pleasure We shall render the Cause victorious through the power of a
> single word from Our presence. […] Should it be God’s intention, there would
> appear out of the forests of celestial might the lion of indomitable strength whose
> roaring is like unto the peals of thunder reverberating in the mountains. However,
> since Our loving providence surpasseth all things, We have ordained that complete
> victory should be achieved through speech and utterance, that Our servants
> throughout the earth may thereby become the recipients of divine good.92

It is well beyond the scope of this paper to detail the diverse and myriad ways in
which the international Bahá’í community has responded to Bahá’u’lláh’s call to unity
and harmony since its light first dawned, but it must suffice to cite the Universal House
of Justice in observing with hope that “amidst the disintegration, a new kind of
collective life is taking shape which gives practical expression to all that is heavenly in
human beings.” 93 This is not merely the collective life of an insular religious
community, but a widening pattern of collective life emerging in neighbourhoods,
villages, cities and nations from an “exploration of reality that gives rise to a shared
understanding of the exigencies of this period in human history and the means for
addressing them.”94 While initiated by the Bahá’í community, this pattern evolves
grounded in the understanding that within every human soul, regardless of background
or professed faith, is an innate need for spiritual growth and education, without which
the disintegrative forces of our lower nature become dominant and manifest their
destructive influence in society. Guided by the messages of the Universal House of
Justice, Bahá’ís the world over are extending invitations to souls of all walks of life to
contribute to a process of spiritual and material betterment that includes programs of

moral and spiritual education for children, youth and adults, devotional meetings in
which believers of any faith may gather in worship, as well as social action and
engagement in public discourses. The Universal House of Justice made clear in 2010,

As Collins points out,

Such a conception of Apocalypse is reflected throughout the Bahá’í writings; it is not
to be understood only in intangible spiritual terms, nor is it to be understood only in
crudely material terms. It encompasses both monumental events and gradual processes,
both calamity and ultimate salvation. Perhaps most importantly, throughout all strands
of the Bahá’í teachings on eschatology a call is proclaimed – sometimes implicit,
sometimes explicit – to recognise and move in alignment with the integrative forces
that characterise the maturation of humanity, evidenced in the increasing awareness of
its oneness. There is always an active component to the numerous and diverse
references. They are never merely the announcement of an event, but rather all
constitute a call to action in service to humanity.
