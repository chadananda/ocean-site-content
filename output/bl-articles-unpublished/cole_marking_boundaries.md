Marking Boundaries, Marking Time: The Iranian Past
and the Construction of the Self by Qajar Thinkers

THEINTELL TAL MODELOF EUROPEAN                NATIONALISM     HADA POWERFUL
impact in the second half the nineteenthcentury upon Qajarintellectuals and of-
ficials, many of whom lived abroad,were fluent in some Europeanlanguage, or
were influencedby translationsof Europeanworks. These thinkers,beginning in
the 1850s, were the first to attempt to "imagine"an Iraniannation.' That they
made this attemptis a result not only of the influence upon them of the modular
nationalistexperience, but also of their own encounterwith the same forces of
modernitythat were hammeringEurope itself-new media of communication,
new forms of transportation,and processes of economic differentiationderiving
from the rise of core industrialeconomies and vastly increasedworld trade-all of
which affordedstates and other institutions the resources for disciplinary tech-
nologies that reshapedthe Self.2But faced with Europeanmilitary and economic

within the nation and without.4 The unitary conception of Self also tends to
blame any weakness or inferioritywithin the Self on an Other. Hitler in his
speeches often adoptedthe rhetoricalstrategy of imagining that other nations
viewed Germanyas weak and supine, evoking a shame state.5

The second approachincorporatesa territorialpatriotisminto a more univer-
salist view of humanity and recognizes multiple selves and multiple others. It
allows mimesis or imitation of the good in any Other, avoiding the wholesale
demonizationof some identities. It also admits the internalplurality of any na-
tional identity, which after all subsumes two gendersand, in most cases, many
ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. Unitary nationalism suppresses and
tends to deny the salience of these internal differences.Pluralist approachesto
identity requirethe opposites of shame and anger:self-respectand love. Social
psychologists have posited the existence of a shame-angerloop, analogousto the
way an embarrassed,blushing person becomes more embarrassedby the realiza-
tion that he or she is blushing in front of others, and perhapsgrows angry at the
ever-increasinghumiliation.There are, however, attitudesand habits of thought
and affect that can counteractthis phenomenon. "The more secure the social
bonds between family members, the more accommodatingtheir attitudestoward
the outgroup . . . the fewer and shorterthe shame-angerloops."6 The conflict
between a narrownativismand a more humanist, pluralist conception of Iranian
identityhas continuedinto the present.

Constructinga modernSelf, groundedin nation, and simultaneously identi-
fying Others ironically implicates the Self in imitation of the Other, whether
acknowledgedor unacknowledged.This paradoxseems especially clear in extra-
Europeanintellectualswho adoptedEuropeanmodels of nationalism. But Euro-
pean identities, as well, dependedon such imitation.That mimesis is key to the
construction of modern identity has been stressed by anthropologist Michael
Taussig. Drawing on the work of Walter Benjamin, Taussig observes:
"Benjamin'sfascination with mimesis flows from the confluenceof three con-
siderations:alterity,primitivism,and the resurgenceof mimesis with modernity.
WithouthesitationBenjaminaffirms that the mimetic faculty is the rudimentof
a formercompulsion of persons to 'become and behave like something else.'
The ability to mime, and mime well, in other words, is the capacity to Other."7

Persian-speakingintellectuals,like Benjaminseventy years later, also expe-
riencedthis tripleconfluence:of alterity,or the increasedopportunityto contrast
one's identity with a Europeanor regionalOther;of primitivism in the sense of
an evaluationof the role of tribespeoplesuch as Arabs and Turkmenin Iranian

history, and of mimesis or the urge to imitate either Europe or anti-modernist
Arabor TurkicIslam.

The nineteenth-centuryfigures who began constructing a conception of a
modernnation,"Iran,"were pioneeringin rugged intellectualterritory.The Qajar
empire in the second half of the nineteenth century simply was not a nation-
state. Probably no more than half of Qajar subjects spoke Persian (with vast
regionalvariationsin dialect-for example, Gilaki-so that even fewer peasants
spoke a mutually comprehensiblePersian). Although a majority were formally
Shi'ite Muslims, many peasants practiceda magical folk religion far removed
from the bookish world of the seminarian,and very large numbersof Qajarsub-
jects had other religious identities, such as Christian, Jewish, Sunni, Zoroas-
trian, Isma'ili, Ahl-i Haqq, Babi and Baha'i. A third of the population was
Turkicin languageand heritage, and many other ethnicities, such as Lur, Arab,

Kurdishand Baluchi,were encompassedby the Qajarstate (even today, millions
of women in particularamong these linguistic minorities know little or no Per-

> sian). Literacywas almost certainly extremely low, something on the order of
> two or three percent, and a substantial portion of the population was pastoral
> nomads with no strong sense of territorialpatriotism(nomads were perhapsfifty
> percentof Iraniansin 1800, twenty-five percentin 1900). Iraniannational iden-
> tity was not an existent that needed to be symbolized, but an idea yet to be real-
> ized. This is not intendedto deny that forms of ethnic identity existed on the
> premodernIranianplateau, that Persian-speakersrecitedFirdawsi (and other po-
> ets) in village gatherings, or that these individualsconceived of Iran as a geo-
> graphicalnotion or that some had a sentimental attachmentto it. None of these
> phenomena,however, adds up to a nation in the modernsense, which is a crea-
> tion of the state and of such peculiarmodem processes as Benedict Anderson's

> plining of the, population, as Ranajit Guha's peasantriescoming to conscious-
> ness in the cauldronof agrariancapitalism, as Gellner's mobile industrialsoci-
ety, and more.8No one of these might be crucial to the creationof any particular
nationalism,but all were largely absent in 1850 from the Qajarempire.

what he saw as the Iranianheritage.In a letterto the editorof the national news-
paperof Iranin 1866, Akhundzadahtook issue with the iconographyof national
self-representationchosen by the newspaper:

> First:the pictureof a mosquewhichyou have reproduced   in yourpaperas a
> symbolof the Iraniannationseems,in my opinion, inappropriate,since if
> by the word"nation"you meanits acceptedmeaning;in otherwords,if you

> for you to find such a symbol to represent,on the one hand, the ancient
> kings of Iranandwill recall, on the other, the Safavidrulers-such as the
pictureof the twelve-crestedcrownof the Qizilbashof redbroadcloth.'0

Akhundzadahbegs the questionby assumingthat the newspaper'seditorbe-
lieves that there is such a thing as the Iraniannation, distinct from other nations.
The contingency and creatednessof the nation is deniedby Akhundzadah'sdic-
tion. He simply wishes, he says, to depict in an authenticmannerwhat already
exists. He then rejects the ordinarymosque as too universal a symbol to mark
the boundariesbetween Iranand Other, to demarcatethe authenticSelf of Iran.
He insists on a distinctive nationaliconography. This he finds in two historical
periodsof the Iranianplateau,the Achaemenidand the Safavid.As early as 1866,
then, he signaled the two majorand ultimatelycompeting intellectual preoccupa-
tions of the latercultureof Iraniannationalidentity-ancient Zoroastrianismand
Shi'ite Islam. In this passage, however, he did not see these two motifs as in
competitionwith each other, and he accomplishedthe adoptionof both of them
by depicting both as layers of authenticIranianhistory.

But note that in orderto achieve his purpose, of identifying an exceptional
historyfor the newly createdIraniannationalism,he must ignore a greatdeal. He
must ignore the centuriesduring which the Iranianplateau was ruledby the Is-
lamic 'Abbasidempire, by the Mongols, and by the Timurids, all of them non-
Persian world-empiresbased outside of Iranbut which incorporatedthe plateau
into their realms. He must also ignore the huge numbersof non-Persianperson-
nel staffing the Achaemenid empire, such as the even more autochthonous
Elamites or the Mesopotamianscribes, and must ignore the Turkicorigins of the
Anatolianand CaucasianTurkmenwho put the Safavids on the throne, origins
thatrenderthese tribes no more Iranianthan were the Ottomans.He must ignore
the fact that the grammarof New Persian is greatly simplified from the near-
Sanskrit of Old Persian and even from Pahlavi or Middle Persian. Moreover,
over fifty percentof the vocabularyof modem Persian is Arabic in origin, so
that it greatly differs, lexicographically, semantically and grammatically,from
the languages spoken in Achaemenidtimes. All this is ignoredin the quest for
what is "peculiar"to Iran,what is genuine nationalhistory. Only those imperial

momentscreatedby dynasties who located theircapital in the Iranianplateau and
who developed a culturenot widely sharedby those outside the plateau are suit-
able for adoptionas icons for Self. Such an exclusionarygambit was common in
the constructionof extra-Europeannationalisms, as Chatterjeehas noted for In-
dia, where IndianMuslims were defined by Hindu nationalists as "outsiders"be-
cause of their origins beyond the subcontinent,just as Akhundzadahdefines the
Arab Muslims of Khuzistan as "outsiders"in Iran." Ironically, Akhundzadah
offers this advice on the imaginingof an Iraniannation as something of an out-
sider, as a Caucasian, who admits that his "brotherhood"with the "nation of
Iran"derives mainly from a sharedShi'ite heritage. He must suppress the obvi-
ous conclusion that Shi'ite Islam and the Safavid tradition are hardly the sole
propertyof QajarIran.He must, of course, also ignore the general lack of inter-
est among most subjects of the Qajarcrown in the pre-Islamicperiod, and their
far more likely identificationwith the mosque that he dismissed than with the
ruins of Persepolis.

The privileging of ancient Iranis even more apparentin Akhundzadah'sLet-
> ters of Kamal al-Dawlahand Jalal al-Dawlah, apparentlywritten in 1864. The
> fictional personaKamalal-Dawlahbegins this work by lamenting that, after his
> world travels, he had ever gone to Iran. "Where,"he asks, "is that glory and
> prosperityyou enjoyed in the age of Gayomartand Jamshid and Gushtasp and
> Anushirvanand Khusraw?"'2    Here he mixes togethermythical figures such as the
> first man, Gayomart,and Jamshid, the Iranianequivalent of the ancient Vedic
> god of death, Yama, with kings of the historicaldynasties. He is careful to admit
> thateven such glory and prosperityas these past rulersachieved was trivial com-
> paredto thatof contemporaryEurope(the ancientauthenticSelf is impoverished

> aligned with it on the scale of virtues). He insists that Iran's people were once
> free (azad) withinthe countryand respectedwithout, but that this past greatness

Islamic past, and which clearly influencedAkhundzadah'slist of rulers. But it is

and law, which knowledge he employed to advise the monarch. The king set
aside one day a week to hearthe petitions of ordinarysubjects, and had made an
extensive corpus of just legislation. The empire stretchedfrom CentralAsia to
Syria, and from the Bosphorusto the Punjab.Now all this splendoris gone, he
laments."3Although Akhundzadahintimates that he is dependingupon Herodo-
tus, an ancient Greek primarysource, in fact his theme of justice derives from
the andarzliteratureof advice for kings, a Sasanian traditioncarniedon in Mus-
lim Iran, in which the Sasanian Anushirvanwas romantically and inaccurately
depictedas the epitome of justice.'4 Akhundzadahappearsto have simply pro-
jected back this image upon the Achaemenids,thoughhe may have derivedsome
knowledge of this earlierdynasty from a Russian translation of Herodotus. In
short, his appeal to modem, scientific history cloaks a dependenceupon an ide-
alization workedout in medieval Muslim literature.

This golden age is broughtto an end by the invasion of Arab Muslims, who
destroy Iranand reduceits people to ignorance,cuttingthem off from world civi-
lization and liberty, leaving them in the clutches of a despotic monarchyand a
fanaticalcorps of ulama. All virtues are extinguished. He quotes, as well, Fir-
dawsi on the destructionof the Sasanids by the Arabs. He maintains that the
Shahnamahcriticizes the Prophet Muhammadfor making religion a means of
looting the people, though in fact Firdawsi appearsto have been a committed
Muslim who only criticizedthe Arabs, not Islam. Akhundzadahdraws on Ibn
Khaldunto buttress his antipathytowardthe Prophet, quoting chapterheadings
from the Muqaddimahsuch as "The Arabs never acquirea state without a relig-
ious coloration,"and "Wheneverthe Arabsconquer lands, they hasten their dete-
rioration."15  Making Ibn Khaldunwitness against his own in this way, however,
depends upon a clever trick, since the North African sociologist meant by

> "Arabs""Bedouins,"and would have consideredneitherthe Prophet Muhammad
> nor himself "Arabs"in that sense. Akhundzadahlatches on to such medieval
> terms as "Arab"and "Iran,"reifying them as ethnic identities continuous with
contemporarypeoples.

In Akhundzadah'stelling, a long string of dreary,tyrannicaldynasties fol-
> lowed the Arab conquest. The Arabs not only visited these unfortunateresults
> upon Iran,but were themselves caught in the same trap. Arab Islam, then, iso-
> lates Iranfrom world civilization. It is for four hundredyears deprivedof the

Akhundzadahholds that within Islamic history Shi'ites are particularlyun-
fortunate,since they internalizetheir early defeatat the hands of the Umayyads
and the 'Abbasids,transformingtheir disappointmentinto a bigoted adherenceto
the Imams that finds expression in the Muharramceremonies.'8Indeed,he says,
if Iranianshad any sense, they would mournthe downfall of the Sasanids and the
tragedythatthus befell their own fatherland(vatan), ratherthan expending their
tearsand disgracingthemselves for the sake of the calamitiesof a people (qawm)
with whom they shareneithera fatherlandnor a language, neither race (fins) nor
philosophy (mashrab),who are in every way strangers(bigdnah) to them.'9 In
this latter passage, Akhundzadahinvokes all the markersof separate identity
treasuredby nineteenth-centuryRomantic nationalists, of territory, language,
race and religion. By insisting that Qajarsubjects are authenticallyZoroastrian,
he managesto demarcatethem from theirArab neighbors along all those scales,

> though given the Shi'ite majority in Iraq, the religious differenceis largely a

hands of the Muslims at Ctesiphon.20

Mazdeanshahs,reducingIranfrom augustworld-empireto the backwardprovince
of a savage and zealous tribaltheocracy.All that is bad in Iran, he implies, is to
be laid at the doorstepof ArabIslam.In the Lettersof Kamalal-Dawlah and Jalal
al-Dawlah, in contrastto the passage quotedat the beginning of this paper, he
omits any mention of the distinctiveness and authenticity of Safavid culture,
depicting Shi'ite Islam as an especially woundedand lugubrious form of the re-
ligion. Akhundzadah'sspecial anxiety about the Arab Muslim Other appearsto
derive in partfrom the mannerin which it has become Self, substitutingwhat he
sees as an alien ethnicity with false claims to universalityfor the genuineness of
local, rooted singularity.He says Sa'd b. Waqqasimposed Islam "on us."22The
reactionaryOther is thus absorbedinto Self, debilitatingit and renderingit er-
satz. Yet anotherimage of the Other is the Turkmentribesmen who raidinno-
cent women and childrenin Khurasan,rapingand pillaging, and so, it is implied,
soil irrevocablyIraniannational honor. The country has in his view been so
debilitatedby its Arab Muslim heritagethat it has been weakenedto the point
where it cannot defendits own women against mere nomads. Attention alrady
has been drawnto this inscriptionof Iraniannationalistidentityon the bodies of
Qajarwomen.23

Self, too, is here seen as able to take on an authenticor inauthenticform,
and these forms correlatewith the sort of Other he considersat any one time.
The reactionarySelf is the pious QajarMuslim, who has acquiescedin an inau-
thentic and imposed identity and been thereby renderedirremediablybackward.
The progressive Self is "liberal,"free-thinking, open to modem science, phi-
losophy, literatureand technology, eager to recoverknowledge about the Achae-
menids. And, of course, this progressive Self correlateswith the good Other of
the European.Whereasthe adoptionof Islam and Arab high culture by inhabi-
tants of the plateau is seen as a self-betrayal,contemporaryQajar openness to
Westernideas is seen as a recoveryof authenticity.The metaphorfor this process
is the mannerin which a Europeansource such as Herodotusis touted as having
the ability to restoreZoroastrianmemories to the amnesiac Muslim Qajarem-
pire, which had misplacedthem. Of course, Firdawsi as a Muslim chroniclerof
Zoroastrianheroes defies this model and perhapsfor this reason he is readwhen
quotedas a secret Zoroastrianwith a hatredof even the Prophet Muhammad
(although in point of fact Firdawsigives every evidence of being a pious Mus-
lim). Akhundzadahwill not admit of the possibility of an individual such as
Firdawsi, who appearsto have felt comfortablewith both his Persian and his
Muslim heritagesand was knowledgeableaboutboth. Rather, he insists on put-
ting Islam underthe sign of erasureand inauthenticity.For Akhundzadah,pro-
gressive Self is authentic,and it is thereforelegitimate to borrowfrom the pro-
gressive Other,whereasreactionarySelf is inauthentic,the result of the suppres-
sion of authenticityby a conqueringreactionaryOther.

Why should mimesis be good with regardto Europe but bad with regardto
Arab Islam?Taussig writes, "Theimportantpoint about what I call the magic of
mimesis is the same-namely that 'in some way or other' the making and exis-

portrayed."24 The Europeansare powerful,and thereforeimitating them acts in a
talismanicmannerto transfersome of their power to Iranians,whereasthe con-
temporaryArabic-speakinglands were from Akhundzadah'spoint of view weak
and backward,so thatcontinuedmimesis of them doomed Iraniansto enervation.

In his Risalah-yi Majdiyyah Majd al-Mulk makes a differentuse of Fir-
dawsi's legends about the Iranianpast. He quotes an article by an Iraniancritic
that he says appearedin the BaghdadnewspaperMashriqi, which likened Iran's
state to that of ancient Iranunderthe fabulous tyrant Dahak or Zahhak, a non-
Iranianrulerwho was said to have snakes growing from his shouldersthatneeded
to eat the brains of young Iranianmen every day. Zahhak is a typical Indo-

> in fact, go so far as to deprive the shah of some of his power and leave Iranians
with no security of life or property.25

when its learning spreadto the East and the West, and when it was capable of
humblingGreece and Rome. Iran's political system, he says, became extremely
influential,and it was renownedas a centerof sciences and the arts. He cites the
Hebrew Bible (Chronicles36:22-23; Ezra 1:2; Esther 1:1, 8:9; Isaiah 45:1, 14;
49:12) to the effect that at the time of Cyrus the Great, the three hundredand
sixty divisions of the Iranianempireextendedfrom Chinaand Indiain the east to
Yemen in the west. He furtherreferencesGreekaccountsfor the glorious reign of
Cyrus. The authorthen delves into the even more ancient past, citing the legend
reportedby Abu al-FidathatFaridundividedthe whole known world among his
three sons. He makes the reason for these referencesto ancient imperial might
and civilizationalprowess on the Iranianplateau abundantlyclear when he says
that "it should not be imagined that the people of Persia are inherentlydeficient
in intelligence, or that . .. they are inferiorto others."Specifically, it is modem
Europeto which the authorimplicitly comparesIran, and he finds his homeland
wanting, not in native intelligence or nationalresources,but in resolve, training,
and effort. The authorobserves that Europe's own progress toward civilization
began as late as the fifteenth century,in the wake of a prolongedDark Ages dur-
ing which Europeanswere little more than barbarians.The contrast of modem
Europewith the Europeof the Dark Ages is a mirrorimage of the contrastbe-
tween Achaemenidand QajarIran,andall four historical periods are instancedas
a means of relativizing Europe's currentsuperiority, of detaching it from any
timeless "essence"and renderingit the result of changing and mutable social
psychologies."

Although 'Abd al-Baha,like Akhundzadah,appeals to the Zoroastrianand
Indo-Iranianpasts in order to inspire nineteenth-centuryQajar subjects with
pride, and urges the adoptionof Europeanmodernity,his underlyingassumptions
are anti-essentialist,whereasAkhundzadahlaboredundera naive Romanticessen-
tialism. 'Abd al-Bahacelebratesthe adventof Islam as an impetus to civilization
that benefitedthe inhabitantsof the Iranianplateaujust as it did many others.
Nor does he accept an easy dichotomy between ZoroastrianIranand Arab Islam.
Even Arab Islam, he points out, borrowedmilitary and other technology from
non-Arabcivilizations such as the Sasanian. Precisely because Iraniansdo not
have a single authentic self or culture, but ratherhave forned part of and bene-
fited from a numberof civilizations, they are authorizedto borrowelements of
Europeanmodernitysuch as superiortechnology, purelyon pragmaticgrounds.28

'Abd al-Baha's treatmentof religion differs completely from that of Akhund-
zadah, in being both positive and universalist.This historical universalism leads
him to make one of his points by telling the story of a tyrannicalpre-Islamic
Arab king who was refonnedby being convertedto Christianity!29Yet he also
invokes Sasanian themes by praising Anushirvanfor his justice.30Zoroastrian-
ism, Christianity,and Islam are all representedas common heritages of not only
Iraniansbut the world, and the achievementsof ArabIslam are seen as contribut-
ing to Iran's civilizational advance.Arab Islam itself leamed from Zoroastrian

Iran. And even Europeancivilization has a strong Islamic component, gained
throughmedieval exchanges in Toledo and Seville, in Sicily and CrusaderJerusa-
lem.3"

In his 1888 A Traveller'sNarrative,'Abd al-Baha,arguing for freedom of
conscience and state toleration towardall religions, again invokes ancient Iran.
There,he says that a majorreason for the success of the Achaemenid empire was
its policy of religious impartiality."In the time when the mighty government of
Persia did not interferewith [men's] consciences, diverse sects enteredin and
abode beneaththe bannerof the great king ... the extent of the empire incrased
from day to day."32He contraststhis policy of tolerationby the ancient rulers of
the Iranianplateau with the late-Safavidpractice of persecuting non-Shi'ites.
"Forthe cause of the Afghan independencyand the revolt of the Turcomantribes
was in truth this thing, else were they at no time or period separate from Per-
sia."33 Shi'ite pressure on the Sunni Afghans and Turkmen, then, provoked tribal
revolts that broughtdown the Safavids and deprivedIranof its easternKhurasa-
nian provinces, including what is now northernAfghanistanand Turkmenistan.
He underlinesthatany policy of persecutingall those not consideredorthodox by
Shi'ite clergymen would result in the imprisonmentor slaughterof very large
numbersof Iranians,such as the Babis and Baha'is, Shaykhis, Sufis and Ahl-i
Haqq.Given Iran'sreligious diversity,then, he argues along Lockean and Jeffer-
sonian lines thatthe state should declare itself neutralwith regardto religious be-
lief.34

'Abd al-Bahaassiduouslydeconstructsany notion of a strictly boundedSelf
and Other, in contrastto Akhundzadah.In his view, Europeancivilization itself
hardlyconsists in some timeless essence, but ratherarose only in the early mod-
ern period, after centuries of medieval torpor, and in vigorous interaction with
Islamic learning. The EuropeanOther is thus revealedas both boundedin time
and multipleas well, with its Andalusianand Crusader/NearEasterngenealogies.
As for Islam, he sees it neither as alien nor as a monolithic identity. Even the
Prophet Muhammad,after all, borrowedthe idea of digging a defensive ditch
against Meccan cavalry from Sasanian Iran, and Muslim philosophers owed
much to the Greeks. Although he accepts the value of Landespatriotismus,or
regional patriotism,he sees not an Iranianself but rathermultiple selves inhabit-
ing the space of Persophonecivilization on the Iranianplateau, which properly

includes the Zoroastrian,Christian, Islamic and Babi-Baha'iheritages, and yet
which contains many other religious and sectarian movements as well (and

salism that exalts reason alongside revelation. While Akhundzadahhad seized
upon the Safavid period as a moment of authenticdifferentiationof the Iranian
Self from its Sunni neighbors(despite his distaste for Islam and Shi'ism gener-
ally), 'Abd al-Bahaactuallylamentsthe late Safavid period as a betrayalof Per-
sian traditions of universalism and justice toward all peoples. While he does
blame the Shi'ite clergy for this costly bigotry, he does not see it as the inevita-
ble outcome of Islam. Rather, he stresses that Islam itself may not be seen as
essentially closed-minded,insofar as it produceda glorious civilization in the
medieval period. It is precisely the authentic and praiseworthymultiplicity of
Iranianselves that allows him to argue so forcefully for the incorporationinto
QajarIranof certainaspects of Europeanmodernity.

Iranianhistory is put to work in the formationof a new identity in another
book, Khalsah or Kh'abn6mah (Seizure or Dreambook),writtenin the 1890s by
MuhammadHasanKhanI'timadal-Saltanah(1840-96), who was, in contrastto
the figuresdiscussed so far, an arch-conservativeand one of Iran's foremost cen-
sors in the late nineteenthcentury.Unlike Akhundzadah,'Abd al-Bahaand Majd
al-Mulk,I'timadal-Saltanahused Iranianhistory for conservativepurposes, dis-
paragingthe so-called reformersas ineffectual braggarts,condemning what he
called free-thinkers,and upholding the royal absolutism of the Qajarempire as
the best possible form of governmentfor Iran. He even views the top-downbu-
reaucraticreformsof the Tanzimatin the Ottoman empire as traitorous,insofar
as they detractedfrom the absolutepower of the monarch.

I'timad al-Saltanahcame of a highly conservative,royalist family. His fa-
ther, 'Ali Khan Hajib al-Dawlah of Maraghah,served in the government of
MuhammadMirza in that town. When MuhammadMirza became Muhammad
Shah in 1834, he appointedHajibal-Dawlahsupervisorand majordomoat court,
and the latter also looked after the expendituresof one of the shah's wives,
KhadijahKhanum.Around 1845, KhadijahKhanumaccusedhim of embezzling
her funds, and the shah dismissed and mulcted him. He was first imprisonedin
the Divan in chains, then allowed to go to the shrine cities of Iraq. After
MuhammadShah's deathin 1848, Nasir al-Din Shah's mother, Mahd-i 'Ulya,
had him appointedto the governorshipof Gilan. Then Amir Kabir,on becoming
prime minister, made Hajib al-Dawlahchamberlainof the court. Mahd-i 'Ulya
and Aqa Khan Nuri were at that time maneuveringbehind the scenes against
Amir Kabir,who was attemptingto centralizepolitical power and administration
in his own hands, and they desiredto rid themselves of the reformer.They went
to Hajibal-Dawlah,who agreedto kill Amir Kabir.Thereafterthe former'scareer
was tied to that of Aqa KhanNuri, the new prime minister.When Nuri fell from
power in 1858, Hajib al-Dawlahlost his court position as well. Mahd-i 'Ulya
arrangeda post for him in Khuzistan. Around 1860, he came back to Tehranas
Nasir al-Din Shah's minister of justice, and in 1865 became minister of pious
endowments.In 1867 he died.

MuhammadHasanKhan, who rose to become I'timad al-Saltanah,was the
second son of 'Ali Khan Hajib al-Dawlah. Ironically, he benefited from Amir
Kabir'sreforms,since he studiedat the Dar al-Funun or polytechnic college the
latterhad set up in Tehranto teach Westernlanguages and sciences. In 1863 he
went to Europeas a memberof the Paris embassy, and there is said to have pur-
sued furtherstudies.He returnedto Iranin 1867 to become courttranslatorand to
edit the official gazette. He became minister of the press in 1883. He accompa-

nied Nasir al-Din Shah on his trips to Europe, and in 1886 he was given the
court title I'timad al-Saltanah.He hated Mirza Husayn Khan Sipahsalar, a re-
formerwho served as prime minister 1871-73, and who sought to institute cabi-
net governmentin Iran,as well as to attractforeign investment on a large scale.
He also got on poorly with Amin al-Sultan(d. 1907), who served as prime min-
ister from 1885 and into the reign of Muzaffaral-Din Shah, but who was ten
years youngerthanI'timadal-Saltanah.3s

I'timad al-Saltanahis something of a puzzle. He had had a wide-ranging
French educationand knew Enlightenmentthinkers such as Rousseau well. In-
deed, he says of Prime MinisterMirza Abu al-Qasim Qa'im-MaqamFarahani(d.

1835) thathe did for Persian literature"what Chateaubriand,Fenelon and Rous-
seau did for French,what Shakespearedid for English, what Schiller and Goethe
did for German,and what Tolstoy did for Russian."36His terms of reference,in
short, are those of a Westernizedintellectual. His copious diaryentries make it
clear that he entertainedthe gravest doubts about Iran's political and economic
health in the late nineteenthcentury. Too often, however, a Western education

ferently from how they are portrayedin the former work.39He, therefore,had
aroundhim persons of liberal views, but was himself much furtherto the right.

I'timad al-Saltanahcombined a Western education and orientation with a
firm belief in enlighteneddespotism. We should rememberthat the France he
knew best was not the Republic but the Empire. Perhapshe was frustratedby
Nasir al-Din Shah's incapacity to play Napoleon III. As Shaul Bakhash has
shown, I'timad al-Saltanahconfidedhis despairto his diary. In the early 1880s
he complainedthatthe govemmenthad been reorganized360 times in 36 years,
and that "since he has orderedand tidied up the work of the government, His
Majesty is thinkingof studying German.He has been studying French for forty
years. He still employs the past tense instead of the present and the imperative
insteadof the negative."' In 1890 he complainedabout the shah's fondness for
giving high ranks to his young childrenor grandchildren,so that court officials
were twelve and colonels and generalswere eight: "Ourgovernmenthas not only
grown young; it has become a child and a mere infant."The poor managementof
state finances, and the neglect of administrationby ministersand princes in favor
of drinkingbouts and dalliances,brought the Qajarcourt in the early 1890s to
the pass where he could no longer even get a meal at the palace, and the shah, de-
spite his huge expenditures,had "no stables, no workshops, no page boys, no
mule house, no kitchens, no pantry,nothing."'41

Bakhashpointed to, and translated,a key piece of fin de siecle ennui: "On
the one hand, I look at my own situation and I am completely happy. . . We
servants,possessing every privilege and extravagantincomes, are carefreeand at
ease, and it is a time to graze and laze about.... On the other hand, when I look
into the state of the kingdom, the manner of conducting government and the
condition of the subjects, my eyes and heart weep and my naturecries out. But
what is it to us? More particularly,what is it to me? Now we are happy. After
us, the deluge."42

In the Dreambook,I'timad al-Saltanah'stone is less one of despairthan of
irony and bitterness about the missed opportunities of the nineteenth century.
One suspects that he felt that if only he, ratherthan the effete and bibulous
Amin al-Sultan,had become prime minister,he might have been able to accom-
plish something. Relegated to the backwaterof the publications department,
convincedof the need for a Frederickthe Great, he instead watchedthe court re-
gress into infantilism. His almost Straussianmask, worn because the intellec-
tualneededto strike an ultra-conservativepose for the benefit of the unenlight-

ened masses, despite his knowledge of the inadequaciesof the reigning political
order,only slipped once. His translationof a French tale about a master who

The Dreambook begins with a framing story that alludes with powerful
symbols to issues of identity, authenticity, and history. I'timad al-Saltanah&-
picts himself accompanyingNasir al-Din Shah to the shrine cities of Iraqin
1893\. On his returnthe entouragestopped at the village of Savah near Hamadan,
where he went off by himself and saw an old, ruinedmosque built by the Safavid
rulerShah Tahmasp. There he finds, while suffering from the 40-degreeheat, a
delightfully refreshingspring.In the midst of the ruins, he meditateson all the
public works performedby the Safavids. Sleep overcomes him, and he lies down
right there to take a nap. He knows the town has gone out to see the shah's
camp, and thinks he will be left alone to rest. This frame is carefully constructed
to suggest a journey into liminality. The pilgrimage to the shrines of the Imams
itself interruptsordinarypolitical life and suggests to the mind of a pious Shi'ite
the possibility of miracles and visions. The solitary excursion to the remains of
the old mosque is, again, a flight from ordinarysociability. Yet within this

> screen the authoroffers a ratherobvious clue to his intent. The state of the edi-
> fice is an implicit condemnationof the Iraniangovernment, which contrasts
> poorly with its Safavid predecessor.The image implies that whereas Shah
Tahmaspbuilt up Iran,the Qajars had not accomplishednearly as much, and in

> the late nineteenthcentury the Qajarshad allowed even what the Safavids had

> that, in a state between waking and sleeping, he hears a murmuringof voices.
The psychological state he describesis at the margins of consciousness, in the

same way that the ruined mosque is at the margins of physical reality. The
crackeddome of the mosque splits, and a multitude of angels descends,who im-

because his motherwas a pure Persian.He depicts Shah Isma'il as darkerin his
coloring because he had a Turkic,Aq-Quyunluprincessfor a mother.Only rulers
who had a strongterritorialbase on the Iranianplateau are named, and such pan-
Islamic dynastiesas the 'Abbasids are ignored, anotherclue to nationalist senti-
ment.45Here is anotherindicationthat both the left and the right among those
with a Westerneducationhad begun conceiving a "national"history in similar
terms.

Now the eleven men who served as prime minister of Iranduringthe nine-
teenth century arriveand seat themselves on the iron chairs, as, in the back-
ground,a sound like the buzzing of bees reverberates.The officials include Amir
Kabir,Mushir al-Dawlah, Amin al-Sultan, and other, less renownedfigures. He
compareswhat happensnext to the way film, while being developed,first turns
black, then white, or the way lights graduallycome up in a playhouse, so that
one can make out the set. Like the earlierinvocationof geographicaland psycho-
logical marginality,this "specialeffect" marksthe narrativeas somehow unreal,
just as a developing photographor a just-beginning play are outside ordinary
categories of reality. Both are representationsof something else, but are espe-
cially vulnerable to being unmasked as representationsduring the preparatory
processes to which the authorrefers.

As a result of the lights coming up, the persons making the buzzing sound
suddenlymaterialize,consisting of a large crowd of some 2,000 prominentper-
sons who lived under Nasir al-Din Shah's rule, which began in 1848. Some of
these persons are dead, others still alive, but their spirits have come to the
mosque. They include Sayyid Jamal al-Din "al-Afghani,"Malkum Khan, and

'Ali MuhammadShirazi, the "Bab,"among other "foolish persons who do
mandedliberty (Qzdi)." Two more moderate characters,Shaykh Muhammad
Janaband Mulla Ibrahim 'Aynaki, carryon a backgroundconversation on the
natureof religion and political power. Janabarguesthat the Hobbesianwar of all
against all makes a strongmonarchnecessaryto social order.He adds, "Manydo
not know these things, or disagree. Some say that the monarchshould not be in-
dependent.They ignore the fact that subjects are ignorantand full of imperfec-
tions, and that autocracyand absolutism (istibddidva istiqldl) are the things best
calculatedto correcttheirerrors."' In this scene the authorhas condemnedSay-
yid Jamal al-Din, Malkum Khan, and the Bab, while arguing for monarchical
absolutism.

Aqa MuhammadKhanQajarnow calls the assembly to order,giving it the
mandateof inquiringas to how the power of the monarchywas weakened.Mulla
Ibrahimexpresses his surprisethatthe dead among the audiencelook like them-
selves, and are wearingtheirquotidianclothing and their habitual mien. He con-
cludes thatthis everydayappearanceof the dead is for the purpose of convincing
the living attendeesat the session that they are not witnessing a dream,fantasy,
or implausibleparlortrick, but thatratherthey are seeing something real.47Like
an image reflectedsuccessively in several mirrors, I'timad al-Saltanah'sironic
play with representationand realityhere serves to confuse the differencebetween

them, despite the overt argument in favor of literal "reality" (haqiqat).Aqa
MuhammadKhanQajarnow is asked by a thunderingvoice issuing from behind
the mihrdbto state his business. The founderof the Qajardynasty praises Nadir
Shah (r. 1736-47), who, for all the troublehe caused Aqa MuhammadKhan and
the Qajars,had restoredprosperityand orderto Iran, govemed well, and repulsed
the Russiansand the Ottomans.Aqa MuhammadKhandescribeshis sufferingsat
the hands of the Zands, and says his goal was to returnIranto its naturalborders:
the Caucasusmountainsand the Oxus, or ratherPunjab.He wants to know how
his successors had spent his legacy, and blames the mismanagementof incapable
prime ministersfor taking the ship of state on the wrong course.48

he intendedto send the shah's mother to Qumm and then to depose the young
Nasir al-Din Shah in favor of a more pliant brother.Nadirpasses judgment on
Amir Kabirby saying that he misjudged the historical moment, that whereas
TahmaspII, the last Safavid, was an idiot, Nasir al-Din was intelligent and wise
and moreover possessed a clever mother in Mahd-i 'Ulya, which the Safavid
lacked.Nadiradmits Amir Kabir to heaven, because he was an able leaderdedi-
catedto Iran'sadvancement,but depriveshim of a crown of glory.52I'timad al-
Saltanahthus upholds his own family's version of Amir Kabir as a traitor c&
serving death, though he does not mention Hajib al-Dawlah'sexecution of him.
He is caricaturedas a man with Nadir's ambitions but lacking his ruthlessness
andresources.

ArdashirBabagan, the founderof the Sasanian dynasty, interrogatesAqa
Khan Nuri, and finds him self-interested,incompetent and given to extreme
nepotism. He is blamed for the disastrousAnglo-Persianwar of 1857, and for
losing the opportunity for Iranianexpansion into Afghanistan, and is neither
rewardedwith a crown nor admittedto paradise,being sent to purgatory(barzakh)
instead.His immediatesuccessor,MuhammadKhan,was defeatedin Fars by the
Britishdespite the numericalsuperiorityof his troops, which led to his deposi-
tion. He is given a crown of glory and admittedto heaven, presumablyfor trying
hard.53

Yet anotherironiccorrespondenceis set up when Anushirvan,a figure pro-
verbial for his wisdom andjustice, is made to interview Mirza Husayn Khan
Mushir al-Dawlah. The author says that Orientalists had proven that Anushir-
van's reputationfor justice was not deserved,and avers that neither was Mirza
HusaynKhan's reputationfor competence. He is depictedas spending his career
in the Iranianforeign service in Bombay, the Caucasus and Istanbul in mulcting
expatriatemerchants,hoarding,and speculating, making himself wealthy at the
expense of the persons he was supposedto be serving. He is made to admit him-
self a disciple of OttomanTanzimatreformersAli Pasha and Fuat Pasha, them-
selves, he says, traitorousministers. Before he becarneprime minister in 1871,
he is made to say, Iranwas like a virgin who had never felt the handof the for-
eigner. He admits that all his reforms had the opposite effect of the one desired,
thathe surroundedhimself with charlatanslike Malkum Khan, and that his plan
to deliver Iran'sresourcesinto the hands of Baron von Reuter was a disaster. In
the end, "Nasiral-Din Shah restoredthe inviolable sovereignty of the monar-
chy."54Even after his demotion in 1873 to foreign minister, he gave too many
concessions to the British and the Russians. Mirza Husayn Khan is consigned to
the flames of hell. There follows I'timad al-Saltanah'sextensive indictment of
Amin al-Sultan,who is depicted as a compulsive liar and perpetualschemerwho
plays the shah off againstthe foreign ambassadors."

I'timadal-Saltanahformulateda modem Iranianidentity centeredupon royal

Achaemenids,along with the ancient Persian language, as predecessorsof the
Qajars(who then share in their reflectedglory). That the ploy of appealing to
ancientPersia as a source of modern Iranianidentity was as available to the Ira-
nian Right as to the progressiveswas demonstratedboth before and after I'timad
al-Saltanah,by Fath 'Ali Shah and by MuhammadRiza Pahlavi. I'timad al-
Saltanah's absolutism causes him to readrecent Iranianhistory in the opposite
mannerfrom the progressiveswe discussed above. He bestows unqualifiedpraise
on mediocre prime ministerssuch as IbrahimKhanShirazi, but vigorous minis-
ters thatthreatenedto reducethe powers of the shah, like Amir Kabir and Mirza
Husayn Khan, are excoriatedas both overly ambitious and incompetent. Very
probably, he cast his attackon the traditionof ministerial reformism in nine-
teenth century Iranin the form of a dreamor vision precisely because it con-
tainedsuch personal assaults on major figures. The descendantsand admirersof
several of these ministerscontinuedto hold importantgovernmentposts or to be
powerful in Iraniansociety. Moreover, Nasir al-Din Shah had himself been re-
sponsible for appointingMirza Husayn Khan and Amin al-Sultan, and presuma-
bly concurred,as a child-ruler,with the installation of Amir Kabir. An open,
frontal,polemical attackon these individuals held the potential of casting doubt
on the sagacity of the shah.

The inventors of modem Iraniannationalism differedsignificantly with re-
gardto whetherthey had a unitary or pluralist conception of the national self.

Akhundzadahattemptedto createa unitary Persian, IranianSelf, rooted not in
religion but in language, Zoroastrianculturalheritage, and the imperial history
of dynastiessuch as the Achaemenidsand the Safavids.Given the Qajarempire's
obvious military weakness and underdevelopedtechnologies, and the defeats it
sufferedin the Russo-Iranianwars of the early nineteenthcentury, Akhundzadah
clearly felt both pride and shame in his identification with "Iranians."He was
driven to explain their relative backwardnessby scapegoating Arabs and Mus-
lims, thus ironically limning a nationalhistory for Iranthat excluded most Qajar
subjects. Majd al-Mulk, 'Abd al-Bahaand several other thinkers, on the other
hand, do not single out an ethnic Other for blame, ratherattributingthese prob-
lems to Qajarabsolutism,the lack of a rule of law, and unwillingness to engage
in a healthy mimesis of salutarypractices,whatevertheir origin. They also seem
willing to honor a numberof sources of Iranianidentity, including both the Zo-
roastrianand the Muslim. I'timad al-Saltanahturns Akhundzadahand the others
on theirheads in many ways. He accepts the constructionof an "Iranian"identity
that is made to stretch back to the Achaemenids, but locates its source of
strength over the centuries in royal absolutism, a traditionthat he believes the
Shi'ite Safavids honored.His vision of Zoroastrianangels singing in Pahlavi in
a rundownSafavidmosque thatthey restore neatly brings together two powerful
symbols of the Iraniannationality he was attempting to construct. Its heroes
through history are indigenous, powerful monarchs-Cyrus, Nadir Shah, Aqa
MuhammadKhan Qajar,and those ministers who stressedautonomy and inde-
pendencefor Iran.Unlike the case in Akhundzadah,I'timad al-Saltanahdoes not
see Shi'ite Islam and Islam generally as foreign, debilitating impositions on
Iran. Whereas Akhundzadahmakes scapegoats of the Arab, Muslim Other,
I'timad al-Saltanahfaults the Europeansand their imitators (with dire implica-
tions, never clearly spelled out, for Westernizinginternalminorities such as the
Christiansand Baha'is).

Each of these thinkershad biographicaland social reasons for locating alter-
ity or the Otherwhere they did. Akhundzadah,as a colonel in the Russian army,
clearly felt acute shame over what he saw as the fanaticism and backwardnessof
the Muslims of the Caucasusand of Iran,which resultedin a great deal of anger.
He almost certainly also sufferedfrom a degreeof suppressedguilt concerning
his own service with a Christian, Europeanpower engagedin virtual genocide
against local Muslims. He displacedthat anger and shame onto the Arabs and
Islam, desperatelyattemptingto discover an Iranianidentity not dependenton
them. Majdal-Mulkand 'Abd al-Bahawere both membersof the Iranianclass of
high notables (nawkar),who saw a role for themselves as reformersbut found
themselves blocked by the shah's autocracy. Both were religiously heterodox,
with the formerbeing a Freemasonand the lattera Baha'i leader.The shame they
felt before the power of the EuropeanOtherwas displaced onto Qajarabsolutism
and the hideboundulama, ratherthan onto a particularethnicity. 'Abd al-Baha
praises some aspects of Europeancivilization while condemningothers, and has
a positive view of Iran's Muslim heritagedespite his contempt for clerical xeno-
phobia. In a bid to relativize the shame quotient historically, he points out that
Europelong laboredunderits own Dark Ages. For both Majd al-Mulk and 'Abd
al-Baha,Self and Other are plural, and it is the dictatorialdisciplining practices
of the absolutist state and the Shi'ite clergy that stand in the way of progress.
I'timad al-Saltanah,as a cabinet minister with a vested interest in the power of
the state, invests Europeanliberalism with alterity, without explicitly tying it to
questions of ethnicity.

Primitivism plays a differentrole for these thinkers than it did for a Euro-
pean such as WalterBenjamin. Akhundzadahlocated it in the barbarityof the
Arabconquerorsof medieval Iranand in the depredationsof Turkmentribespeo-
pie in Khurasan.For Majd al-Mulk, the primitive, unitary absolutism of the
mythical nomad, Zahhak,is contrastedwith the mutable and fickle despotism of
Nasir al-Din Shah. 'Abd al-Baha sees the world religions, Christianityand Islam,
as educatorsand transformersof Middle Easterntribespeople, enabling them to
found greatcivilizations.

The reemergenceof mimesis with modernity preoccupies, in one form or
> another,all four of the thinkers we have examined. For Akhundzadah,mimesis

> nian self, insofaras its techniquesof knowledge allow an excavation and restora-
> tion to memory of the ancient Iranianpast, and insofar as its technology and
> forms of social organizationcan, like a fetish, bestow renewedpractical power

> roastrian,Christian,Islamic, minority-ethnicand Europeanelements avoids "the
singularity of the idea of a national history" that ironically and inevitably
"divides"compatriotsfrom one another.56
