Bahá’í Hermeneutics:
An Academic and Primary Source Inquiry

Peter Terry

2009 (revised 2015)

INTRODUCTION
My favorite sort of intellectual endeavor is an exploration of a topic without a strict plan,
and with my preconceived notions bracketed in such a way as not to interfere with
whatever I may discover on the journey. I am literally finding my way as I go…and I
want my reader to have a similar experience, starting off without knowing where s/he will
end up. In the course of engaging in this journey, I arrived at a particular destination,
and I will share that with the reader. But I have added a few comments here and there,
and at the end to encourage the reader to arrive at his or her own conclusions, and to
share them with others. Bahá’í hermeneutics will not develop as a field, either in
theology or in philosophy, unless it generates dialogue between thinkers. Here you will
find the thoughts of Bahá’u’lláh1, ‘Abdu’l- Bahá2, Shoghi Effendi3, the Universal House of
Justice4 – of them acknowledged by Bahá’ís as “authoritative”, that is, as “normative” for
Bahá’ís. While no one will deny the importance of becoming familiar with and engaging
the ideas of those who have passed on, and those who are in communal leadership
positions, it is just as important, if this subject is to be of current interest, that it involve
living thinkers and include persons who are not leaders. You will also find the thoughts of
several scholars who, at one time or another, have been members of the Bahá’í
community. I have been very restrained in offering my own thoughts on this topic,
assuming the role of an educator rather than an advocate. My study of this topic has
taken many sleepless nights, during periods when I was not fully employed, and often also
when I was alone and not particularly happy. This work provided a unique solace,
inasmuch as I experienced unique moments as my brain registered levels of
understanding which were usually just below the surface or out of range…until they came
into focus. Scholarship is always a human endeavor, and, as such, it has much more than
the intellectual dimensions which appear in an article or book. It stirs the soul, animates
the body, and tickles the fancy, as well as taxing the mind and exercising the intellect.
May it provide you with even a fraction of the wealth that I have derived from it.
HERMENEUTICS DEFINED
A number of Bahá'í scholars have written essays on the subject of Bahá’í hermeneutics,
including, listed chronologically in order of publication, Robert Parry5, Steven Scholl,

Dann May, Michael Sours, Khazeh Fananapazir and Seena Fazel, Jack McLean, Juan
Ricardo Cole, Christopher Buck, and Sen McGlinn. Their essays were published over
the course of a period of fifteen years, from 1982 to 1997. The recent treatments of the
subject have not been featured here and will have to await another author’s interest. We
will hear first from these writers, as each one seeks to define hermeneutics in the context
of studying the Bahá’í Writings.
Steven Scholl6 opened the discussion contrasting the "orthodox" scientific historical
method, based on a methodologically agnostic search for objective truth championed by
Denis MacEoin with the "orthodox" approach taken by "fundamentalist Bahá’ís clinging to the
'authoritative' interpretations of Shoghi Effendi as the final word as to what true Shaykhism or Bábism
was and what Bahá’ísm is and will be". He contrasts the "scientific method" of MacEoin, who
holds that there is an "objective or absolute truth" which is the unattainable goal of
scholarship, which must therefore formulate "approximations rather than final statements
about the truth"7 and that the scholar "must proceed by methods that are rational, critical, open to
criticism, universal and as free from subjective bias as it is possible to render them". Scholl contrasts
this hermeneutic with the phenomenological method developed by Edmund Husserl,
Mircea Eliade, W. Brede Kristensen, Martin Heidegger, and Hans-Georg Gadamer, and
described by Robert Parry8.                 Scholl comes out very much in favor of the
phenomenological approach, while ending his article with "I do not wish to make the gulf
between historians and phenomenologists sound unbridgeable. I share the hope of Raffaele Pettazzoni that
the two disciplines will complement each other and broaden their respective horizons."
Dann May9 began his consideration of hermeneutics with a definition of terminology
derived from Richard Palmer10 and Steven Levy11. He says that hermeneutics "is
broadly defined as the science and methodology of interpretation. It is primarily
concerned with the overall interpretive process and the various theories and principles of
interpretation, especially the principles of proper textual exegesis. While Palmer "discusses
the importance of hermeneutics to the fields of theology, philosophy and literary interpretation", Levy
"examines the role of interpretive principles in psychoanalytic psychotherapy." May indicates that his
paper "attempts to identify and discuss certain interpretive principles found within the Bahá’í writings."
Like Scholl, he favors a phenomenological approach. Unlike Scholl, he does not contrast
this approach with the "historical" approach or with the "authoritative" approach. Nor does
he repeatedly refer to phenomenologist thinkers in the course of his article. Instead he
focuses on deriving hermeneutical principles directly from the Bahá’í source texts. While
he cites "authoritative interpretation" he does not dwell on the topic, paying much more
attention to those principles that will be useful to individuals who seek to decipher
meaning for themselves.
Michael Sours12 affirms in the opening sentence to his article, without offering either
references or examples, that "In Bahá’u’lláh's Writings there is no single method of interpretation,
such as allegorical, symbolical, typological, or literal, that is used exclusively for the understanding of any
major category of Scripture, be it prophecy, historical narratives, or general explanatory texts." He
continues, "Bahá'u'lláh freely uses a variety of different forms of interpretation to explain specific
passages found in different categories of sacred texts. However, in some instances He rejects interpretations
that rely on these same methods. For example, He may reject the literal interpretation of some prophecies
while accepting the literal interpretation of other prophecies. Moreover, in many instances He indicates that

more than one method of interpretation is applicable for understanding a single passage." Having made
this statement about Bahá’u’lláh's hermeneutics, he then asks, "How then can an interpreter
determine when one or more methods of interpretation are applicable or inapplicable to a specific verse in
the Scriptures?" He answers this question by saying that "a sound theology is essential to correct
interpretation." Sours does not refer to any of the methods cited above, and his purpose is
to show how Bahá’í theology should guide interpretations of the Bahá’í Writings.
Seena Fazel and Khazeh Fananapazir13 define hermeneutics as "the science of
interpretation" and indicate that it "is an area of Bahá'í studies yet to be systematically explored".
They describe their intention "to illustrate some distinctive hermeneutic principles in the Bahá’í
Writings" and begin by noting that "the multiplicity of interpretive methods is a theme that recent
authors have suggested is the basis of Bahá’í hermeneutics", citing the aforementioned articles by
Dann May and Michael Sours. Their paper includes a section on "authoritative
interpretation" entitled "The Authorized Interpreters" but for the most part focuses on
hermeneutical principles derived from the Bahá’í source texts that are appropriate for use
by individual readers.
Well into his "Prolegomena", Jack McLean14 speaks of two kinds of Bahá’í theology.
"Bahá'í source theology refers to the authoritative, objective, and normative truths of the Bahá'í
sacred writings or those elucidated by its duly appointed interpreters. Authoritative means that the teaching
is binding on believers; objective means that the truths of source theology are commonly perceived and
recognized as true by the community of believers; normative means that the teaching is recognized by
believers as the standard of truth." In speaking of Bahá’í theology in the broader sense he
writes "the broader definition refers to the commentary of scholars, called here derivative theology:
Bahá'í derivative theology (commentary) is the subjective, relative, and nonbinding elucidation of
Bahá'í teachings by competent scholars. Subjective here means that the commentary is particular to the
viewpoint of the writer and becomes objective only where a common consensus exists as to its validity."
McLean is not principally occupied with defining or delineating the parameters of Bahá’í
hermeneutics in his paper, as the subject he has chosen is the much broader field of
Bahá’í theology. However, his affirmation of "authoritative interpretation" mirrors the
references to that principle in May and Fazel/Fananapazir.
Juan Cole15 begins his paper with "The Bahá'í writings contain a complex and nuanced set of
prescriptions for the interpretation of scripture." He then launches into a short history of Western
hermeneutics, from the Roman Catholic "strong emphasis on the relevance of Church tradition to
understanding scripture" to the "the rise of modern interpretive methods" with Wilhelm Dilthey
leading ultimately "to positivism, the privileging of empirical evidence, logic, and experimental
verifiability over metaphysics", and the reaction to positivism by Hans-Georg Gadamer,
Jürgen Habermas, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Here, once again, we have the
phenomenologists. Cole refers to the "authoritative interpretation" (tabyin) of "non-legal texts",
indicating "only two individuals have held or ever will hold this function in the Bahá'í community,
Bahá'u'lláh's eldest Son, 'Abdu'l-Bahá and 'Abdu'l-Bahá's grandson, Shoghi Effendi" and that there
are "discrepancies" between the authoritative interpretations of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and those of
Shoghi Effendi. He concludes reference to "authoritative interpretation" by suggesting "the need
for the development of a hermeneutical approach even to authoritative interpretive comments." He also
sets forth the parameters that govern the elucidation of the Universal House of Justice

and Bahá’í institutions at the local and national levels. He speaks of there being three
different approaches to hermeneutics by Bahá’ís, "figurative interpretation, formal exegesis, and
academic writing on the Bahá'í Faith", and ends the paper by relating these three approaches
to Gadamer, Dilthey, and Wittgenstein. Rather than deriving hermeneutical principles
primarily from Bahá’í source texts, Cole derives them principally from classical Islamic
literature and then interprets them in light of modern Western hermeneutics.
Christopher Buck16 does not treat Bahá’í hermeneutics in Chapter III of Symbol and
Secret--he discusses Bahá’u’lláh as a "hermeneut", and focuses on his "hermeneutical
terminology…in light of its Islamic heritage", while qualifying this statement by assuring the
reader that "we shall be careful to avoid the pitfalls of reductionism…inasmuch as Bahá’u’lláh's Kitáb-
i-Íqán went far beyond Islam's doctrinal boundaries and, over a period of time, effected the exegetical
creation of the Bahá'í Faith." Buck makes no statements about the hermeneutics of Bahá’ís,
only about the hermeneutics of Bahá’u’lláh, and therefore the concept of "authoritative
interpretation" does not arise. Buck makes no reference to the scientific, authoritative and
phenomenological approaches discussed by Scholl, but he analyses the Kitáb-i-Íqán
according to the Islamic hermeneutics noted by Cole, with the exception that Islamic
hermeneutics were applied to legal texts whereas Kitáb-i-Íqán is not such a text.
Sen McGlinn17 does not give an overall commentary on the Fazel/Fananapazir article
published five years earlier. He seizes upon an attribution of a particular interpretive
prerogative to Shoghi Effendi as Guardian which he identifies as erroneous, and
subsequently sets forth "the broad outlines of the interpretive principles to be applied: first of all in the
doctrine of the separation of the two spheres of the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice, as
defined in The Dispensation of Bahá'u'lláh, second by considering whether the subject matter is a
question of administration or of doctrine, and third by listening for the distinctive tone of Shoghi Effendi's
writing where he is consciously acting as the Expounder of the words of God." This commentary is
therefore concerned entirely with defining the parameters of "authoritative interpretation" and
with suggesting the guidelines that scholars might apply in order to distinguish the
"authoritative interpretations" of the Guardian from his administrative decisions which may be
overridden by the Universal House of Justice.
THE SOURCE OF HERMENEUTICS: PART ONE:

THE MANIFESTATION OF GOD
We will now look at what Bahá’u’lláh, the Founder and principal author of the Bahá’í
Faith says about hermeneutics, and in doing so we must pay close attention to his
rhetoric. Bahá’u’lláh uses language in ways with which the contemporary reader is not
likely to be familiar. This may give the reader the impression that Bahá’u’lláh’s language
is incomprehensible, or beyond his understanding, but neither notion is either inevitable
or ultimately justified by the evidence. He wrote in a style and utilizing a vocabulary that
was understood by readers in his own time and in his own environs. It is to be
remembered that, in most cases, his readers were men schooled in the religious, the
mystical and to some degree the philosophical literature associated with Islam, and in
particular with the Persian Imámí Shí’í18 tradition. Bahá’u’lláh writes to two learned men
of his own time, the first in Haft Vadí and the second in Kitáb-i-Íqán (KI), clearly
indicating his intention was to be understood:

> If any of the utterances of this Servant may not be comprehended, or may
> lead to perturbation, the same must be inquired of again, that no doubt
> may linger, and the meaning be clear as the Face of the Beloved One…19
> Twelve hundred and eighty years have passed since the dawn of the Muhammadan
> Dispensation, and with every break of day, these blind and ignoble people have recited
> their Qur'án, and yet have failed to grasp one letter of that Book! Again and again they
> read those verses which clearly testify to the reality of these holy themes, and bear witness
> to the truth of the Manifestations of eternal Glory, and still apprehend not their purpose.
> They have even failed to realize, all this time, that, in every age, the reading of the
> scriptures and holy books is for no other purpose except to enable the
> reader to apprehend their meaning and unravel their innermost mysteries.
> Otherwise reading, without understanding, is of no abiding profit unto
> man.20

In some Tablets21, Bahá’u’lláh calls the Manifestation of God the Essence, the Source, the
Object, the Fountainhead, the Mother, the Soul, the Secret, the Essence, the Day-star
and the Mine and Wellhead of all knowledge and learning:

> We have decreed, O people, that the highest and last end of all learning be the
> recognition of Him Who is the Object of all knowledge; and yet, behold how ye have
> allowed your learning to shut you out, as by a veil, from Him Who is the Dayspring of
> this Light, through Whom every hidden thing hath been revealed.22
> Great is the blessedness of that divine that hath not allowed knowledge to become a veil
> between him and the One Who is the Object of all knowledge, and who, when the Self-
> Subsisting appeared, hath turned with a beaming face towards Him. He, in truth, is
> numbered with the learned.23
> Consider the multitude of souls who seemed to be intensely eager and athirst, yet when
> the Ocean of living waters did surge forth in the world of being, they remained deprived
> thereof, inasmuch as they failed to relinquish idle fancy and to become consciously aware
> of Him Who is the Object of all knowledge. This failure is in recompense for the deeds
> their hands had formerly wrought.24
> In the Tablet he received, the Báb conferred upon him one of His own titles, that of
> Hujjat, and urged him to proclaim from the pulpit, without the least reservation, the
> fundamental teachings of His Faith. No sooner was he informed of the wishes of his
> Master than he declared his resolve to devote himself to the immediate enforcement of
> whatever injunction that Tablet contained. He immediately dismissed his disciples, bade
> them close their books, and declared his intention of discontinuing his courses of study.
> "Of what profit," he said, "are study and research to those who have already found the
> Truth, and why strive after learning when He Who is the Object of all knowledge is
> made manifest?"25
> The Essence of knowledge exclaimeth and saith: Lo! He Who is the Object of all
> knowledge is come and through His advent the sacred Books of God, the Gracious, the
> Loving, have been embellished. Every revelation of grace, every evidence of goodly gifts
> emanateth from Him and unto Him doth it return.26

> It hath been witnessed in this day how many of the divines, owing to their rejection of the
> Truth, have fallen into, and abide within, the uttermost depths of ignorance, and whose
> names have been effaced from the scroll of the glorious and learned. And how many of
> the ignorant who, by reason of their acceptance of the Faith, have soared aloft and
> attained the high summit of knowledge, and whose names have been inscribed by the Pen
> of Power upon the Tablet of divine Knowledge. Thus, 'What He pleaseth will God
> abrogate or confirm; for with Him is the Source of Revelation." [Qur’án 13:41]
> Therefore, it hath been said: "To seek evidence, when the Proof hath been established is
> but an unseemly act, and to be busied with the pursuit of knowledge when the Object of
> all learning hath been attained is truly blameworthy." Say O people of the earth! Behold
> this flamelike Youth that speedeth across the limitless profound of the Spirit, heralding
> unto you the tidings: "Lo: the Lamp of God is shining," and summoning you to heed His
> Cause which, though hidden beneath the veils of ancient splendour, shineth in the land of
> 'Iraq above the day-spring of eternal holiness.27
> They clamour for guidance, although the standards of Him Who guideth all things are
> already hoisted. They cleave to the obscure intricacies of knowledge, when He, Who is
> the Object of all knowledge, shineth as the sun. They see the sun with their own eyes,
> and yet question that brilliant Orb as to the proof of its light. They behold the vernal
> showers descending upon them, and yet seek an evidence of that bounty. The proof of
> the sun is the light thereof, which shineth and envelopeth all things. The evidence of the
> shower is the bounty thereof, which reneweth and investeth the world with the mantle of
> life. Yea, the blind can perceive naught from the sun except its heat, and the arid soil
> hath no share of the showers of mercy. "Marvel not if in the Qur’án the unbeliever
> perceiveth naught but the trace of letters, for in the sun, the blind findeth naught but
> heat."28
> Arise in the name of Him Who is the Object of all knowledge, and, with absolute
> detachment from the learning of men, lift up your voices and proclaim His Cause. I swear
> by the Day Star of Divine Revelation! The very moment ye arise, ye will witness how a
> flood of Divine knowledge will gush out of your hearts, and will behold the wonders of
> His heavenly wisdom manifested in all their glory before you. Were ye to taste the
> sweetness of the sayings of the All-Merciful, ye would unhesitatingly forsake your selves,
> and would lay down your lives for the Well-Beloved.29
> Of these truths some can be disclosed only to the extent of the capacity of the repositories
> of the light of Our knowledge, and the recipients of Our hidden grace. We beseech God
> to strengthen thee with His power, and enable thee to recognize Him Who is the Source
> of all knowledge, that thou mayest detach thyself from all human learning, for "what
> would it profit any man to strive after learning when he hath already found and
> recognized Him Who is the Object of all knowledge?"30
> We have forbidden men to walk after the imaginations of their hearts, that they may be
> enabled to recognize Him Who is the sovereign Source and Object of all knowledge, and
> may acknowledge whatsoever He may be pleased to reveal. Witness how they have
> entangled themselves with their idle fancies and vain imaginations. By My life! They are
> themselves the victims of what their own hearts have devised, and yet they perceive it not.

Vain and profitless is the talk of their lips, and yet they understand not.31

Bahá’u’lláh also refers to the Manifestation as the Fountainhead and Fountain of
knowledge:

> Even as He saith: "None knoweth the meaning thereof except God and them that are
> well-grounded in knowledge." [Qur’án 3:7] And yet, they have sought the interpreta-
> tion of the Book from those that are wrapt in veils, and have refused to seek enlighten-
> ment from the fountainhead of knowledge.32
> Cleave to the Root of knowledge, and to Him Who is the Fountain thereof, that thou
> mayest find thyself independent of all who claim to be well versed in human learn-
> ing, and whose claim no clear proof, nor the testimony of any enlightening book,
> can support.33
Bahá’u’lláh calls the Manifestation the Source of true knowledge:

> Whosoever among the divines of every age receiveth, in the Day of Reckoning, the
> testimony of faith from the Source of true knowledge, he verily becometh the recipient of
> learning, of divine favour, and of the light of true understanding. Otherwise, he is
> branded as guilty of folly, denial, blasphemy, and oppression.34
> It is evident and manifest unto every discerning observer that even as the light of the star
> fadeth before the effulgent splendour of the sun, so doth the luminary of earthly
> knowledge, of wisdom, and understanding vanish into nothingness when brought face to
> face with the resplendent glories of the Sun of Truth, the Day-star of divine
> enlightenment.35

Consider now, had the people of the Gospel recognized the meaning of the symbolic
terms

> "sun" and "moon," had they sought, unlike the forward and perverse, enlightenment from
> Him Who is the Revealer of divine knowledge, they would have surely comprehended the
> purpose of these terms, and would not have become afflicted and oppressed by the
darkness

> of their selfish desires. Yea, but since they have failed to acquire true knowledge from its
> very Source, they have perished in the perilous vale of waywardness and misbelief. They
> still have not awakened to perceive that all the signs foretold have been made manifest,
> that the promised Sun hath risen above the horizon of divine Revelation, and that the
> "sun" and "moon" of the teachings, the laws, and learning of a former Dispensation have
darkened and set.36

> Of these truths some can be disclosed only to the extent of the capacity of the repositories
> of the light of Our knowledge, and the recipients of Our hidden grace. We beseech God
> to strengthen thee with His power, and enable thee to recognize Him Who is the Source
> of all knowledge, that thou mayest detach thyself from all human learning, for "what
> would it profit any man to strive after learning when he hath already found and
> recognized Him Who is the Object of all knowledge?"37
> We have forbidden men to walk after the imaginations of their hearts, that they may be
> enabled to recognize Him Who is the sovereign Source and Object of all knowledge,
> and may acknowledge whatsoever He may be pleased to reveal. Witness how they have
> entangled themselves with their idle fancies and vain imaginations. By My life! They are
> themselves the victims of what their own hearts have devised, and yet they perceive it not.

Vain and profitless is the talk of their lips, and yet they understand not.38

> In like manner, endeavour to grasp the significance of "return," "revelation," and
> "resurrection," as witnessed in the days of the Manifestations of the divine Essence, that
> thou mayest behold with thine own eyes the "return" of the holy souls into sanctified and
> illumined bodies, and mayest wash away the dust of ignorance, and cleanse the darkened
> self with the waters of mercy flowing from the Source of divine Knowledge; that
> perchance thou mayest, through the power of God and the light of divine guidance,
> distinguish the Morn of everlasting splendour from the darksome night of error.39

Inasmuch as they have not apprehended the meaning of Knowledge, and have called by
that

> name those images fashioned by their own fancy and which have sprung from the
> embodiments of ignorance, they therefore have inflicted upon the Source of Knowledge
> that which thou hast heard and witnessed.40
> The signs of God shine as manifest and resplendent as the sun amidst the works of His
> creatures. Whatsoever proceedeth from Him is apart, and will always remain
> distinguished, from the inventions of men. From the Source of His knowledge countless
> Luminaries of learning and wisdom have risen, and out of the Paradise of His Pen the
> breath of the All-Merciful hath continually been wafted to the hearts and souls of men.
> Happy are they that have recognized this truth.41
> We have forbidden men to walk after the imaginations of their hearts, that they may be
> enabled to recognize Him Who is the sovereign Source and Object of all knowledge,
> and may acknowledge whatsoever He may be pleased to reveal. Witness how they have
> entangled themselves with their idle fancies and vain imaginations. By My life! They are
> themselves the victims of what their own hearts have devised, and yet they perceive it not.

Vain and profitless is the talk of their lips, and yet they understand not.42
The Manifestation is the Day-star of knowledge:

> Cast away, O concourse of divines, the things ye have composed with the pens of your
> idle fancies and vain imaginings. By God! The Day-Star of Knowledge hath shone
> forth above the horizon of certitude.43
The Manifestation is the Root of knowledge:

> Cleave to the Root of knowledge, and to Him Who is the Fountain thereof, that thou
> mayest find thyself independent of all who claim to be well versed in human learning, and
> whose claim no clear proof, nor the testimony of any enlightening book, can support.44
The Manifestation is the Mine and Wellhead of knowledge:

> For it behooveth no man to interpret the holy words according to his own imperfect
> understanding, nor, having found them to be contrary to his inclination and desires, to
> reject and repudiate their truth. For such, today, is the manner of the divines and doctors
> of the age, who occupy the seats of knowledge and learning, and who have named
> ignorance knowledge, and called oppression justice. Were these to ask the Light of Truth
> concerning those images which their idle fancy hath carved, and were they to find His
> answer inconsistent with their own conceptions and their own understanding of the Book,
> they would assuredly denounce Him Who is the Mine and Wellhead of all Knowledge
> as the very negation of understanding. Such things have happened in every age.45

The Manifestation is well-grounded in knowledge, the Mother, the Soul, the Secret, and
the Essence of knowledge:

> Even as thou dost witness how the people of the Qur’án, like unto the people of old, have
> allowed the words "Seal of the Prophets" to veil their eyes. And yet, they themselves
> testify to this verse: "None knoweth the interpretation thereof but God and they that are
> well-grounded in knowledge." [Qur’án 3:7] And when He Who is well-grounded in all
> knowledge, Who is the Mother, the Soul, the Secret, and the Essence thereof,
> revealeth that which is the least contrary to their desire, they bitterly oppose Him and
> shamelessly deny Him.46
Finally, Bahá’u’lláh affirms that the Manifestations are the Essences of knowledge:

> As the wayward of every age have failed to fathom the deeper import of these weighty
> and pregnant utterances, and imagine the answer of the Prophets of God to be irrelevant
> to the questions they asked them, they therefore have attributed ignorance and folly to
> those Essences of knowledge and understanding.47

In other Tablets and Books, the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh call the Manifestation of God the
“Point”48, including these passages:

> Secrets are many, but strangers are myriad. Volumes will not suffice to hold the mystery
> of the Beloved One, nor can it be exhausted in these pages, although it be no more than a
> word, no more than a sign. "Knowledge is a single point [nuqtih], but the ignorant have
> multiplied it."49
> Whatever high proofs and wondrous allusions are recounted herein, concern but a single
> Letter [bi-huruf váhid], a single Point [nuqtih váhidih]. "Such hath been the way of
> God…and no change canst thou find in the way of God." [Qur'án 33:62; 48:23]50
> Nay, whatsoever proceedeth from these Mines of divine Wisdom and these Treasuries of
> eternal knowledge is truth, and naught else but the truth. The saying: "Knowledge is one
> point, which the foolish have multiplied" is a proof of Our argument, and the tradition:
> "Knowledge is a light which God sheddeth into the heart of whomsoever He willeth" a
confirmation of Our statement.51
THE SOURCE OF HERMENEUTICS: PART TWO:

THE WORD OF GOD
It is the teachings, the revealed Word of the Manifestation that is the balance in which all
things may be weighed in order to discern truth from falsehood. No other standard can
be trusted absolutely. This truth is affirmed in other texts, including these:

> This is the Day when the loved ones of God should keep their eyes directed towards His
> Manifestation, and fasten them upon whatsoever that Manifestation may be pleased to
> reveal. Certain traditions of bygone ages rest on no foundations whatever, while the
> notions entertained by past generations, and which they have recorded in their books,
> have, for the most part, been influenced by the desires of a corrupt inclination. Thou dost

> witness how most of the commentaries and interpretations of the words of God, now
> current amongst men, are devoid of truth. Their falsity hath, in some cases, been exposed
> when the intervening veils were rent asunder. They themselves have acknowledged their
> failure in apprehending the meaning of any of the words of God.
> Our purpose is to show that should the loved ones of God sanctify their hearts and their
> ears from the vain sayings that were uttered aforetime, and turn with their inmost souls to
> Him Who is the Day Spring of His Revelation, and to whatsoever things He hath
> manifested, such behavior would be regarded as highly meritorious in the sight of God.52
> Thus it is recorded: "Every knowledge hath seventy meanings, of which one only is
> known amongst the people. And when the Qá'im shall arise, He shall reveal unto men all
> that which remaineth." He also saith: "We speak one word, and by it we intend one and
seventy meanings; each one of these meanings we can explain."53

We perceive none, however, amongst the people of the earth who, sincerely yearning for
> the Truth, seeketh the guidance of the divine Manifestations concerning the abstruse
> matters of his Faith. All are dwellers in the land of oblivion, and all are followers of the
> people of wickedness and rebellion. God will verily do unto them that which they
> themselves are doing, and will forget them even as they have ignored His Presence in His
> day. Such is His decree unto those that have denied Him, and such will it be unto them
> that have rejected His signs.54

In "Kitáb-i-Aqdas" (1872) Bahá’u’lláh stated that all must turn to him, the Sun of Reality,
during his lifetime, and to his Book when he ascended to the spiritual worlds:

> Should differences arise amongst you over any matter, refer it to God while the Sun still
> shineth above the horizon of this Heaven and, when it hath set, refer ye to whatsoever
> hath been sent down by Him. This, verily, is sufficient unto the peoples of the world.55
In the "Súratu'l-Bayán" Bahá’u’lláh wrote:

We see Bahá'u'lláh calling upon the believers who possess "the testimony of the Prophets
and Messengers of God" to "weigh" his words in the "just Balance" they possess in that
"testimony" and then, if they acknowledge its truth, to adhere to it closely. He does not
require anyone to recognize the truth of his words. All are free to accept or reject them.
In various Tablets Bahá'u'lláh affirms this freedom of choice:

> This is My counsel unto thee and unto the beloved of God. Whosoever wisheth, let him
> turn thereunto; whosoever wisheth, let him turn away.57

> Thus doth the Nightingale utter His call unto you from this prison. He hath but to

> which we desire.60
> We exhort, wholly for the sake of God, His servants. Let him who wisheth turn unto
> Him, and him who wisheth turn aside.61

In the "Kitáb-i-Íqán" Bahá'u'lláh referred to the Scriptures associated with the Prophets
and Messengers of the past as the unfailing standard of truth62:

> We have also heard a number of the foolish of the earth assert that the genuine text of the

Muhammad, inasmuch as its decrees are indisputable, and its promise unfailing. All have
been rejoined to follow the precepts of that Book until 'the year sixty'--the year of the
advent of God's wondrous Manifestation. That Book is the Book which unfailingly
leadeth the seeker        unto the Ridvan of the divine Presence, and causeth him that
hath forsaken his country and is treading the seeker's path to enter the Tabernacle of
everlasting reunion. Its guidance can never err, its testimony no other testimony can
excel. All other traditions, all other books and records, are bereft of such distinction,
inasmuch as both the traditions and they that have spoken them are confirmed and
proven solely by the text of that Book. Moreover, the traditions themselves grievously
differ, and their obscurities are manifold… 66
Although many traditions had been revealed by that Source of Prophethood and Mine of
divine Guidance, yet He mentioned only that Book, thereby appointing it as the mightiest
instrument and surest Testimony for the seekers; a guide for the people until the Day of
Resurrection.67
With unswerving vision, with pure heart, and sanctified spirit, consider attentively what
God hath established as the testimony of guidance for His people in His Book, which is
recognized as authentic by both the high and lowly. To this testimony we both, as well as
all the peoples of the world, must cling, that through its light we may know and
distinguish between truth and falsehood, guidance and error. Inasmuch as Muhammad
hath confined His testimonies to His Book and to His Family, and whereas the latter hath
passed away, there remaineth His Book only as His one testimony amongst the people.68
Consider, how He hath appointed and decreed this self-same Book, the Qur’án, as a
guidance unto all that are in heaven and on earth. He, the divine Being, and unknowable
Essence, hath, Himself, testified that this Book is, beyond all doubt and uncertainty, the
guide of all mankind until the Day of Resurrection. And now, We ask, is it fair for this
people to view with doubt and misgiving this most weighty Testimony, the divine origin
of which God hath proclaimed, and pronounced it to be the embodiment of truth? Is it
fair for them to turn away from the thing which He hath appointed as the supreme
Instrument of guidance for attainment unto the loftiest summits of knowledge, and to seek
aught else but that Book? How can they allow men's absurd and foolish sayings to sow
the seeds of distrust in their minds? How can they any longer idly contend that a certain
person hath spoken this or that way, or that a certain thing did not come to pass? Had
there been anything conceivable besides the Book of God which could prove a more
potent instrument and a surer guide to mankind, would He have failed to reveal it in that
verse?69
We should acknowledge the holy and wondrous Scriptures, for failing to do this we have
failed to acknowledge the truth of this blessed verse. For it is evident that whoso hath
failed to acknowledge the truth of the Qur’án hath in reality failed to acknowledge the
truth of the preceding Scriptures.70
Behold, how lofty is the station, and how consummate the virtue, of these verses which
He hath declared to be His surest testimony, His infallible proof, the evidence of His all-
subduing power, and a revelation of the potency of His will. He, the divine King, hath
proclaimed the undisputed supremacy of the verses of His Book over all things that testify
of His truth. For compared with all other proofs and tokens, the divinely-revealed verses
shine as the sun, whilst all others are as stars. To the peoples of the world they are the
abiding testimony, the incontrovertible proof, the shining light of the ideal King. Their

> kindleth the flame of love in the breasts of the faithful, and induceth the chill of

> Likewise He saith: "Such are the verses of God: with truth do We recite them to Thee.
> But in what revelation will they believe, if they reject God and His verses?" [Quran 45:5]
> If thou wilt grasp the implication of this verse, thou wilt recognize the truth that no

> Such was the perversity and pride of that people. Each one of these verses is unto all the

> 2:94]75

Even as religion and its revelation of truth is progressive in nature76, it follows that the
Book of each Manifestation abrogates and supersedes the Books of his predecessors77.
The Báb indicated that his successor, whom he designated as "Him Whom God will
make manifest", would be the touchstone, the only standard upon his advent78.
Bahá’u’lláh likewise affirmed this authority of "Him Whom God will make manifest" and
his writings in "Kitáb-i-Iqan" (1861) and in "Epistle to the Son of the Wolf" (1891):

> …in the dispensation of Him Whom God will make manifest His own Book—the Book
> unto which all the Books of former Dispensations must needs be referred, the Book which
> standeth amongst them transcendent and supreme.79
> And likewise, He saith: "Suffer not yourselves to be shut out as by a veil from God after
> He hath revealed Himself. For all that hath been exalted in the Bayán is but as a ring
> upon the hand of Him Whom God shall make manifest--glorified be His mention! He
> turneth it as He pleaseth, for whatsoever He pleaseth, and through whatsoever He
> pleaseth. He, verily, is the Help in Peril, the Most High." And likewise, He saith: "Were
> He to make of every one on earth a Prophet, all would, in very truth, be accounted as
> Prophets in the sight of God." And likewise, He saith: "In the day of the revelation of
> Him Whom God shall make manifest all that dwell on earth will be equal in His
> estimation. Whosoever He ordaineth as a Prophet, he, verily, hath been a Prophet from
> the beginning that hath no beginning, and will thus remain until the end that hath no
> end, inasmuch as this is an act of God.80

After his declaration to a small group of his followers in 1863, Bahá’u’lláh gradually
disclosed to the entire body of the followers of the Báb that he was the promised "Him
Whom God will make manifest".

THE SOURCE OF HERMENEUTICS: PART THREE:

THE BOOK OF GOD
Bahá’u’lláh establishes the testimony of the revealed Word as the enduring source of
God's guidance in this world. While the Manifestation of God is physically present in this
world only during the duration of his earthly sojourn, the Book lives on after him.
Bahá’u’lláh attested this with regard to his own Revelation, in Kitáb-i-Aqdas, and in an
untitled Tablet:

> Be not dismayed, O peoples of the world, when the day-star of My beauty is set, and the
> heaven of My tabernacle is concealed from your eyes. Arise to further My Cause, and to
> exalt My Word amongst men. We are with you at all times, and shall strengthen you
> through the power of truth.81

He indicates that once he will have passed on, it is his wish that his followers “exalt My
Word”, meaning the Book, so that it will live on after his demise.

> Should differences arise amongst you over any matter, refer it to God while the Sun still
> shineth above the horizon of this Heaven and, when it hath set, refer ye to whatsoever
> hath been sent down by Him.82

As long as he is alive, all differences are to be referred to him personally, but once he will
have passed on, his followers must turn “to whatsoever hath been sent down by Him”.
This phrase, used in the Qur’án and the writings of the Báb, denominates the revealed
Book, which is composed of verses which are described as having descended from God.
If the seeker weighs the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh, who claimed to be “Him Whom God
shall manifest”, in the "just Balance" of the "testimony of the Prophets and Messengers of

God" and finds his "testimony" to be authentic and divinely-inspired, then his Writings
become that "just Balance":

That city is none other than the Word of God revealed in every age and dispensation. In
the

> days of Moses it was the Pentateuch; in the days of Jesus the Gospel; in the days of
> Muhammad the Messenger of God the Qur'án; in this day the Bayan; and in the
> dispensation of Him Whom God will make manifest His own Book-the Book unto which
> all the Books of former Dispensations must needs be referred, the Book which standeth
> amongst them all transcendent and supreme.83
> Say: O leaders of religion! Weigh not the Book of God with such standards and sciences
> as are current amongst you, for the Book itself is the unerring Balance established
> amongst men. In this most perfect Balance whatsoever the peoples and kindreds of the
> earth possess must be weighed, while the measure of its weight should be tested according
> to its own standard, did ye but know it.84
> Give ear unto the verses of God which He Who is the sacred Lote-Tree
> reciteth unto you. They are assuredly the infallible balance, established by
> God, the Lord of this world and the next.85
> Say: This is the infallible Balance which the Hand of God is holding, in which all who are
> in the heavens and all who are on the earth are weighed, and their fate determined, if ye
> be of them that believe and recognize this truth. Say: This is the Most Great Testimony,
> by which the validity of every proof throughout the ages hath been established, would
> that ye might be assured thereof. Say: Through it the poor have been enriched, the
> learned enlightened, and the seekers enabled to ascend unto the presence of God.
> Beware lest ye make it a cause of dissension amongst you. Be ye as firmly settled as the
> immovable mountain in the Cause of your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving.86
> This is a Book which hath become the Lamp of the Eternal unto the world, and His
> straight, undeviating Path amidst the peoples of the earth. Say: This is the Dayspring of
> Divine knowledge, if ye be of them that understand, and the Dawning-place of God's
> commandments, if ye be of those who comprehend.87

In other Tablets, Bahá'u'lláh affirmed the primacy of his Writings as a standard by which
things may be reckoned:

> …acts of worship must be observed according to that which God hath revealed in His
> Book.88
> It is incumbent upon the Trustees of the House of Justice to take counsel together
> regarding those things which have not outwardly been revealed in the Book, and
> to enforce that which is agreeable to them.89
> Unto every father hath been enjoined the instruction of his son and daughter in the art of
> reading and writing and in all that hath been laid down in the Holy Tablet.90
> …acts of worship must be observed according to that which God hath revealed in His
> Book."91

> It is incumbent upon everyone to firmly adhere and observe that which hath streamed
> forth from Our Most Exalted Pen. God, the True One, beareth Me witness, and every
> atom in existence is moved to testify that such means as lead to the elevation, the
> advancement, the education, the protection and the regeneration of the peoples of the
> earth have been clearly set forth by Us and are revealed in the Holy Books and Tablets
> by the Pen of Glory.92

Bahá'u'lláh does not credit oral tradition as a reliable source of divine guidance. In
addition to the excerpts from his Writings which touch upon this theme, there is also at
least one Tablet written by 'Abdu'l-Bahá and several letters written on behalf of Shoghi
Effendi to this effect:

> That Book is the Book which unfailingly leadeth the seeker unto the Ridvan of the divine
> Presence, and causeth him that hath forsaken his country and is treading the seeker's path
> to enter the Tabernacle of everlasting reunion. Its guidance can never err, its testimony
> no other testimony can excel. All other traditions, all other books and records, are bereft
> of such distinction, inasmuch as both the traditions and they that have spoken them are

> Although many traditions had been revealed by that Source of Prophethood and Mine of

> Resurrection.94
> Thou hast written concerning the pilgrims and pilgrims' notes. Any narrative that is not
> authenticated by a Text should not be trusted. Narratives, even if        true,   cause
> confusion. For the people of Bahá', the Text, and only the Text, is authentic.95
> Shoghi Effendi has laid down the principle that the Bahá'ís should not attribute much
> importance to talks, reported to have been given by the Master, if these have not in one
> form or other obtained His sanction. Bahá’u’lláh has made it clear enough that only
> those things that have been revealed in the form of Tablets have a binding power over the

> basic teaching of Bahá’u’lláh was to preserve the Faith from being corrupted like Islam

> According to the Teachings of Bahá’u’lláh no authority can be attached to a mere

Mirza Abu'l-Fadl Gulpaygani (1844-1914), the highly respected Bahá’í scholar who weas
personally acquainted with both Bahá’u’lláh and 'Abdu'l-Bahá, has noted that this
principle, of the authenticity of the written Word and the untrustworthiness of the spoken
word, is one of the distinctive teachings of Bahá’u’lláh:

> First, a command which is particularly a feature of the Bahá’í religion and is not found in
> the other religions is "abstaining from crediting verbal traditions." It is well known to
> men of learning that it was verbal tradition which divided the Jews into two great sects.
> Such traditions are the basis of the book of Talmud, and caused the division of that one
> nation. One of the two schisms called the Rabbinim looks upon the teachings of the
> Talmud as the law which needs to be followed and considers it the greatest means for the
> preservation and permanence of the Jewish people.           But the other sect, Gharraim
> [Karaites] looks upon the Talmud as sheer heresy and conducive to perdition. Thus
> these two sects cannot possibly be harmonized or cease mutual opposition.
> Similarly in the Christian religion the main cause of schism and division are these verbal
> traditions which were termed "authoritative." Each one of the Christian Churches, such
> as the Catholic, the Orthodox, the Jacobite, the Nestorian, and others consider it
> obligatory to follow these traditions inherited from and handed down by the fathers of
> their Churches, as the very text of the Holy Book. Thus when in any of the great
> Councils the question of the unification of the Christian people would be at issue, they
> would avail themselves of these inherited traditions which were opposed to union and
> harmony. Likewise in the religion of Islam, claiming these verbal traditions which were
> related of the Founder of that Religion, subsequent to His death, was the cause of the
> division and separation into the various principal sects, such as the Sunni, the Shi'i and
> the Kharajite, or into the secondary schools of Hanofite, Malakite, Shafiite, Haubilite
> [Hanbali], etc. Each of these hold to a set of traditions considered as authentic by their
> own sect. But Bahá’u’lláh closed to the people of the world this door which is the greatest
> means for sedition: for He has clearly announced that "in the religion of God all
> recorded matters are referable to the Book and all unrecorded matters are dependent
> upon the decision of the House of Justice." Thus all narrations, relations and verbal
> traditions have been discredited among the Bahá’í people and the door of dissension,
> which is the greatest among the doors of hell, has been closed and locked.99

Hence, for Bahá’u’lláh and his followers, the Book is authoritative. To what extent does
it constitute a divine standard by which all things can be weighed? In a Tablet written by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, three letters written on behalf of the Guardian, and a letter written by the
Universal House of Justice, the station of the "testimony" of the Prophets and Messengers,
and, in particular, the authority of Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, is explained. The first
reference is to the authenticity of the historical records found in the Bible and those cited
by Bahá’u’lláh in "Lawh-i-Hikmat" (Tablet of Wisdom):

> The most important thing is to establish the validity of God's universal Manifestation
> [mazhar-i-kullí-yi iláhí] ; once His claim proveth true, then whatsoever He may choose to
> say is right and correct. 100

> As to your third question Shoghi Effendi would like you to understand that when one
> believes in One to be divinely inspired and when one is convinced that he has a great
> mission to the world in His teachings, he must very naturally be ready to accept all that
> that world-teacher, that divinely-inspired Man says. It is with this view that he feels that a
> real Bahá'í would be one who is convinced that Bahá'u'lláh was a world-teacher and a
> Messenger of God bearing to mankind a great Message and would therefore be ready to
> accept all that Bahá'u'lláh has said and the same is true of the Master, Whom we believe
> to have been the great propounder of the Bahá'í teachings and the One through Whom
> the Covenant of God was firmly established in the world.101
> Regarding the question of days referring in some cases to years, and in some cases to

> interpretation of religious history as well as the Master's words do?102
> Between the truth which comes from God through His Prophets, and the glimmerings,
> often misunderstood and misinterpreted, of truth which come from the philosophers and
thinkers, there is an immense difference. We must never, under any circumstances,

confuse the two…We must use the Writings of the Prophets as our
> measurement… 103
> The principle of faith is to accept anything the Manifestation of God says, once you have

> While it may often be the part of wisdom to approach individuals or an audience from a

> Manifestation of God is the standard for all knowledge, and scientific statements and
> theories, no matter how close they may come to the eternal principles proclaimed by
> God's Messenger, are in their very nature ephemeral and limited.105

Bahá’u’lláh affirms the tremendous power invested in him, as a Divine Educator, and
indicates that only the knowledge and wisdom revealed by him can be of lasting benefit to
humanity in this promised Day of God:

> The generality of mankind is still immature. Had it acquired sufficient capacity We
> would have bestowed upon it so great a measure of Our knowledge that all who dwell on
> earth and in heaven would have found themselves, by virtue of the grace streaming from
> Our pen, completely independent of all knowledge save the knowledge of God, and
> would have been securely established upon the throne of abiding tranquillity.106
> In another sense, by these terms is intended the divines of the former Dispensation, who
> live in the days of the subsequent Revelations, and who hold the reins      of religion in
> their grasp. If these divines be illumined by the light of the latter Revelation they will be

> dependent upon the sanction of Him Who is the Day-star of Truth.107
> O ye leaders of religion! Who is the man amongst you that can rival Me in vision or

> the things ye have composed with the pens of your idle fancies and vain imaginings. By
> God! The Day-Star of Knowledge hath shone forth above the horizon of certitude.111

Bahá’u’lláh writes in Kitáb-i-Íqán that this principle applies to all of the Manifestations of
God:

> That city is none other than the Word of God revealed in every age and dispensation. In
> the days of Moses it was the Pentateuch; in the days of Jesus the Gospel; in the days of
> Muhammad the Messenger of God the Qur’án; in this day the Bayan; and in the

> which all the Books of former Dispensations must needs be referred, the Book which
> standeth amongst them all transcendent and supreme. In these cities spiritual sustenance
> is bountifully provided, and incorruptible delights have been ordained. The food they
> bestow is the bread of heaven, and the Spirit they impart is God’s imperishable blessing.
> Upon detached souls they bestow the gift of Unity, enrich the destitute, and offer the cup
> of knowledge unto them who wander in the wilderness of ignorance. All the guidance, the

blessings, the learning, the understanding, the faith, and certitude, conferred upon all that
is in heaven and on earth, are hidden and treasured within these Cities.
For instance, the Qur’án was an impregnable stronghold unto the people of Muhammad.
In His days, whosoever entered therein, was shielded from the devilish assaults, the
menacing darts, the soul-devouring doubts, and blasphemous whisperings of the enemy.
Upon him was also bestowed a portion of the everlasting and goodly fruits—the fruits of
wisdom, from the divine Tree. To him was given to drink the incorruptible waters of the
river of knowledge, and to taste the wine of the mysteries of divine Unity. All the things
that people required in connection with the Revelation of Muhammad and His laws were
to be found revealed and manifest in that Ridvan of resplendent glory. That Book
constitutes an abiding testimony to its people after Muhammad, inasmuch as its decrees
are indisputable, and its promise unfailing. All have been enjoined to follow the precepts
of that Book until “the year sixty”[1260]—the year of the advent of God’s wondrous
Manifestation. That Book is the Book which unfailingly leadeth the seeker unto the
Ridvan of the divine Presence, and causeth him that hath forsaken his country and is
treading the seeker’s path to enter the Tabernacle of everlasting reunion. Its guidance can
never err, its testimony no other testimony can excel. All other traditions, all other books
and records, are bereft of such distinction, inasmuch as both the traditions and they that
have spoken them are confirmed and proven solely by the text of that Book. Moreover,
the traditions themselves grievously differ, and their obscurities are manifold.
Muhammad, Himself, as the end of His mission drew nigh, spoke these words: “Verily, I
leave amongst you My twin weighty testimonies: The Book of God and My Family.”
Although many traditions had been revealed by that Source of Prophethood and Mine of
divine Guidance, yet He mentioned only that Book, thereby appointing it as the mightiest
instrument and surest testimony for the seekers; a guide for the people until the Day of
Resurrection. With unswerving vision, with pure heart, and sanctified spirit, consider
attentively what God hath established as the testimony of guidance for His people in His
Book, which is recognized as authentic by both the high and lowly. To this testimony we
both, as well as all the peoples of the world, must cling, that through its light we may
know and distinguish between truth and falsehood, guidance and error. Inasmuch as
Muhammad hath confined His testimonies to His Book and to His Family, and whereas
the latter hath passed away, there remaineth His Book only as His one testimony amongst
the people.112
In another passage He likewise saith: “And if ye be in doubt as to that which We have
sent down to Our Servant, then produce a Surah like it, and summon your witnesses,
beside God, if ye are men of truth.”113 Behold, how lofty is the station, and how
consummate the virtue, of these verses which He hath declared to be His surest
testimony, His infallible proof, the evidence of His all-subduing power, and a revelation of
the potency of His will. He, the divine King, hath proclaimed the undisputed supremacy
of the verses of His Book over all things that testify to His truth. For compared with all
other proofs and tokens, the divinely-revealed verses shine as the sun, whilst all others are
as stars. To the peoples of the world they are the abiding testimony, the incontrovertible
proof, the shining light of the ideal King. Their excellence is unrivalled, their virtue
nothing can surpass. They are the treasury of the divine pearls and the depository of the
divine mysteries. They constitute the indissoluble Bond, the firm Cord, the Urvatu’l-
Vuthqa, the inextinguishable Light. Through them floweth the river of divine knowledge,
and gloweth the fire of His ancient and consummate wisdom. This is the fire which, in
one and the same moment, kindleth the flame of love in the breasts of the faithful, and
induceth the chill of heedlessness in the heart of the enemy.114

We see from these passages from his Writings that Bahá’u’lláh does not invest much
importance in mere utterances, that is, in the human record of traditions, such as
compose the entirety of the Gospels, and the hadith of Muhammad and the twelve
Imams. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi extended this restriction of the sources of
Revelation, by insisting that only those Writings of Bahá’u’lláh which are authenticated--
which have been discovered in his autograph or with his seal or some other mark of his
approbation--will be accepted as legitimate.

> Any narrative that is not authenticated by a Text should not be trusted. Narratives, even
> if true, cause confusion. For the people of Bahá, the Text, and only the Text, is
> authentic.115
> Shoghi Effendi has laid down the principle that the Bahá’ís should not attribute much
> importance to talks reported to have been given by the Master, if these have not in one
> form or other obtained His sanction. Bahá’u’lláh has made it clear enough that only
> those things that have been revealed in the form of Tablets have a binding power over the
> friends. Hearsays may be matters of interest but can in no way claim authority. This
> basic teaching of Bahá’u’lláh was to preserve the Faith from being corrupted like Islam
> which attributes binding authority to all the reported sayings of Muhammad. This being
> a basic principle of the Faith, we should not confuse Tablets that were actually revealed
> and mere talks attributed to the founders of the Cause. The first have absolute binding
> authority while the latter can in no way claim our obedience. The highest thing this can
> achieve is to influence the activities of the one who has heard the saying in person. Those
> talks of the Master that were later reviewed by Him, corrected or in some other form
> considered authentic by Himself, such as the “Some Answered Questions”, these could be
> considered as Tablets and therefore be given the necessary binding power. All the other
> talks such as are included in Ahmad's diary or the diary of pilgrims, do not fall under this
> category and could be considered only as interesting material to be taken for what they
> are worth. For this reason Shoghi Effendi has not been encouraging the publication of
> reported sayings that were not authenticated by the Master Himself. And when he said
> that they may be published if quotation marks are taken away, Shoghi Effendi tried to
> prevent the friends from considering as actual words of the Master things that were not
> authenticated                                     by                                 Him.116
> According to the Teachings of Bahá’u’lláh no authority can be attached to a mere
> hearsay, no matter through whom it may come. The Tablets that bear the seal or
> signature of Bahá’u’lláh and the Master are the only parts of the literature that have any
> authority and that constitute the basis of our belief. All other forms of literature may bear
> points of interest but they cannot be considered as authentic. This is the view that Shoghi
> Effendi took towards the talks of Abdu'l-Bahá that Ahmad Sohrab had incorporated in
> his book, and it is the attitude that he would take towards any other reported saying,
> naturally unless the Master has appended His signature to that talk and thereby given it
> the authority of a Tablet such as is the case with `Some Answered Questions' that was
> actually                      corrected                       by                      Him.117

The Book of God as defined in the Bahá’í Faith is not confined to one volume. It
comprises hundreds of volumes, including the extant and authenticated Writings of the
Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. As will be demonstrated, according to Bahá’í teaching, the Word of
God is extended, through the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh, ton include the authoritative and
authenticated interpretations of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi.

PRINCIPLES GOVERNING REVELATION OF THE WORD OF GOD
Bahá’u’lláh points out certain principles governing the revelation of the Word of God,
apart from the question of authentication--he affirms that the Word of God is revealed
according to the capacity of humanity to comprehend and apply it and not according to
the capacity of the Manifestation of God to reveal it; he points out the limitations of
human language; and he defends the spiritual independence and transcendental
character of the Manifestation.
First, the Word of God is revealed according to the capacity of humanity to comprehend
and apply it and not according to the capacity of the Manifestation to reveal it:

> Notwithstanding all that We have mentioned, how innumerable are the pearls which
> have remained unpierced in the shell of Our heart! How many huris of inner meaning
> that are as yet concealed within the chambers of divine wisdom!118
> Behold, how many are the mysteries that lie as yet unravelled within the tabernacle of the
> knowledge of God, and how numerous the gems of His wisdom that are still concealed in
> His inviolable treasuries! Shouldst thou ponder this in thine heart, thou wouldst realize
> that His handiwork knoweth neither beginning nor end. The domain of His decree is too
> vast for the tongue of mortals to describe, or for the bird of the human mind to traverse;
> and the dispensations of His providence are too mysterious for the mind of man to
> comprehend. His creation no end hath overtaken, and it hath ever existed from the
> "Beginning that hath no beginning"; and the Manifestations of His Beauty no beginning
> hath beheld, and they will continue to the "End that knoweth no end." Ponder this
> utterance in thine heart, and reflect how it is applicable unto all these holy Souls.119
> Immeasurably exalted is the celestial Melody above the strivings of human ear to hear or
> mind to grasp its mystery! How can the helpless ant step into the court of the All-
> Glorious? And yet, feeble souls, through lack of understanding, reject these abstruse
> utterances, and question the truth of such traditions. Nay, none can comprehend them
> save those that are possessed of an understanding heart.120
> By God! This Bird of Heaven, now dwelling upon the dust, can, besides these melodies,
> utter a myriad songs, and is able, apart from these utterances, to unfold innumerable
> mysteries. Every single note of its unpronounced utterances is immeasurably exalted
> above all that hath already been revealed, and immensely glorified beyond that which
> hath streamed from this Pen. Let the future disclose the hour when the Brides of inner
> meaning, will, as decreed by the Will of God, hasten forth, unveiled, out of their mystic
> mansions, and manifest themselves in the ancient realm of being.
> Nothing whatsoever is possible without His permission; no power can endure save
> through His power, and there is none other God but He. His is the world of creation,
> and His the Cause of God. All proclaim His Revelation, and all unfold the mysteries of
> His Spirit.121
> In like manner, every time the Prophets of God have illumined the world with the
> resplendent radiance of the Day Star of Divine knowledge, they have invariably
> summoned its peoples to embrace the light of God through such means as best befitted
> the exigencies of the age in which they appeared.122

> The difference between the ordinances under which they abide should be attributed to
> the varying requirements and exigencies of the age in which they were revealed.123
> Oh, would that the world could believe Me! Were all the things that lie enshrined within
> the heart of Bahá, and which the Lord, His God, the Lord of all names, hath taught Him,
> to be unveiled to mankind, every man on earth would be dumbfounded…
> Of these truths some can be disclosed only to the capacity of the repositories of the light
> of Our knowledge, and the recipients of Our hidden grace.124
He points out the limitations of human language:

> How great the multitude of truths which the garment of words can never contain! How
> vast the number of such verities as no expression can adequately describe, whose
> significance can never be unfolded, and to which not even the remotest allusions can be
> made! How manifold are the truths which must remain unuttered until the appointed
> time is come! Even as it hath been said: “Not everything that a man knoweth can be
> disclosed, nor can everything that he can disclose be regarded as timely, nor can every
> timely utterance be considered as suited to the capacity of those who hear it.”125
He defends the spiritual independence and transcendental character of the Manifestation:

> Thus doth the Nightingale utter His call unto you from this prison. He hath but to
> deliver this clear message. Whosoever desireth, let him turn aside from this counsel and
> whosoever desireth let him choose the path to his Lord.126
> This is My counsel unto thee and unto the beloved of God. Whosoever wisheth, let him
> turn thereunto; and whosoever wisheth, let him turn away. God, verily, is independent of
> him and of that which he may see and witness.127
> We have shown thee these two ways; walk thou the way thou choosest. This verily is the
> truth, and after truth there remaineth naught but error.128
> This Wronged One calleth aloud for the sake of God. Whosoever wisheth, let him turn
> thereunto; whosever wisheth, let him turn away. Verily God can well afford to dispense
> with all things, whether of the past or of the future.129
> Truly this Wronged One desireth not to demonstrate His own Cause with proofs
> produced by others. He is the One Who embraceth all things, while all else besides Him
> is circumscribed. Say, O people, peruse that which is current amongst you and We will
> peruse what pertaineth unto Us. I swear by God! neither the praise of the peoples of the
> world, nor the things that the kindreds of the earth possess are worthy of mention before
> the remembrance of His Name. Unto this beareth witness He Who under all conditions
> proclaimeth, 'Verily He is God, the sovereign Ruler of the Day of Reckoning and the
> Lord of the Mighty Throne.'130
> Leave them unto themselves, saying: Unto you be that which ye desire and unto us that
> which we desire. Wretched indeed is the plight of the ungodly.131

> We exhort, wholly for the sake of God, His servants. Let Him who wisheth turn unto
> Him, and him who wisheth turn aside. Our Lord, the Merciful, is verily the All-Sufficing,
> the All-Praised.132

HERMENEUTICAL PRINCIPLES: TWO KINDS OF VERSES
Bahá’u’lláh indicates that the Book of God, the text comprising the revelations uttered or
penned by the Manifestation of God is composed of two kinds of verses. In making this
statement, He cites a passage from the Qur’án, so we will begin with this text:

> He has sent down [nazala] to thee the Book [al-Kitáb]: in it there are verses [ayatun] that
> are decisive in meaning [muh.kamatun] –they are the basis of the Book [hunna ummu'l-
> Kitáb] --and there are others that are allegorical [ukharu mutashabihatun]. But those in
> whose hearts is perversity follow the part there of that is allegorical, seeking discord, and
> searching for its hidden meanings, but no one knows its hidden meanings except God and
> those who are firmly grounded in knowledge. Say: 'We believe in the Book; the whole of
> it is from our Lord;' and none will grasp the message except for men of understanding.133

Bahá’u’lláh refers to this passage in Kitáb-i-Íqán as he explains the two different kinds of
language found in the Book of God. For many attestations to the authority of this volume
as a source for Bahá’í doctrine, please read the following comments authored by
Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi:

> Peruse thou the Kitáb-i-Íqán (Book of Certitude) and that which the All-Merciful hath
> sent down unto the King of Paris (Napoleon III) and to such as are like him, that thou
> mayest be made aware of the things that have happened in the past, and be persuaded
> that We have not sought to spread disorder in the land after it had been well-ordered.134
> Briefly, there hath been revealed in the Kitáb-i-Íqán (Book of Certitude) concerning the
> Presence and Revelation of God that which will suffice the fair-minded.135
> Not long ago it was stated that thou hadst ascribed the authorship of the Kitáb-i-Íqán and
> of other Tablets unto others. I swear by God! This is a grievous injustice. Others are
> incapable of apprehending their meaning, how much more of revealing them!136
> Bahá’u’lláh has explained these verses in the Kitáb-i-Íqán. There is no need of repetition;
> refer to it, and you will understand these sayings.137
> It is clear and evident that these signs have symbolic signification, and that they are not
> literal. They are fully explained in the Kitáb-i-Íqán. Refer to it.138
> This subject is fully and clearly explained in the Kitáb-i-Íqán.139
> The “return” which is mentioned in the Divine Scriptures is this: it is fully explained by
> the Supreme Pen in the Kitáb-i-Íqán. Refer to it, so that you may be informed of the
> truth of the divine mysteries.140

> Foremost among the priceless treasures cast forth from the billowing ocean of
> Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation ranks the Kitáb-i-Íqán (Book of Certitude)…this Book, setting
> forth in outline the Grand Redemptive Scheme of God, occupies a position unequalled
> by any work in the entire range of Bahá’í literature, except the Kitáb-i-Aqdas,
> Bahá’u’lláh’s Most Holy Book…
> Next to this unique repository of inestimable treasures must rank that marvelous
> collection of gem-like utterances, the “Hidden Words” with which Bahá’u’lláh was
> inspired, as He paced, wrapped in His meditations, the banks of the Tigris…To these two
> outstanding contributions to the world’s religious literature, occupying respectively,
> positions of unsurpassed preeminence among the doctrinal and ethical writings of the
> Author of the Bahá’í Dispensation…141

Bahá’u’lláh, towards the conclusion of Kitáb-i-Íqán, that Book "of unsurpassed
preeminence among the doctrinal...writings of the Author of the Bahá’í Dispensation",
writes:

> It is evident unto thee that the Birds of Heaven and Doves of Eternity speak a twofold
> language. One language, the outward language [z.áhir], is devoid of allusions [bi ramz],
> is unconcealed and unveiled; that it may be a guiding lamp and a beaconing light
> whereby wayfarers may attain the heights of holiness, and seekers may advance into the
> realm of eternal reunion. Such are the unveiled traditions [ruyát makshufih] and the
> evident verses [ayát vad.h.ih] already mentioned. The other language is veiled [h.ijáb]
> and concealed [satir], so that whatever lieth hidden in the heart of the malevolent may be
> made manifest and their innermost being be disclosed. Thus hath Sadiq, son of
> Muhammad, spoken: “God verily will test them and sift them.” This is the divine
> standard [mízán iláhí], this is the Touchstone of God, wherewith He proveth His
> servants. None apprehendeth the meaning of these utterances except them whose hearts
> are assured, whose souls have found favour with God, and whose minds are detached
> from all else but Him. In such utterances, the literal meaning, as generally understood by
> the people, is not what hath been intended. Thus it is recorded: “Every knowledge hath
> seventy meanings, of which one only is known amongst the people. And when the Qá’im
> shall arise, He shall reveal unto men all that which remaineth.” He also saith: “We speak
> one word, and by it we intend one and seventy meanings; each one of these meanings we
> can explain.”142

THE OUTWARD LANGUAGE [muh.kamatun]
We will go through this commentary line by line, to make certain that we understand its
import. The Scriptures have two kinds of language. One of these, "the outward language
[z.áhir], is devoid of allusions [bi ramz], is unconcealed and unveiled; that it may be a
guiding lamp and a beaconing light whereby wayfarers may attain the heights of holiness,
and seekers may advance into the realm of eternal reunion. Such are the unveiled
traditions [ruyát makshufih] and the evident verses [ayát vad.h.ih] already mentioned."
The "outward language" must then be comprehensible to everyone, requiring no special
skills or intelligence or knowledge. Bahá’u’lláh refers to this "outward language" earlier in
Kitáb-i-Íqán:

> Heed not the idle contention of those who maintain that the Book and verses thereof can
> never be a testimony unto the common people, inasmuch as they neither grasp their
> meaning nor appreciate their value. And yet, the unfailing testimony of God to both the

> East and the West is none other than the Qur’án. Were it beyond the comprehension of
> men, how could it have been declared as a universal testimony unto all people? If their
> contention be true, none would therefore be required, nor would it be necessary for them
> to know God, inasmuch as the knowledge of the divine Being transcendeth the knowledge
> of His Book, and the common people would not possess the capacity to comprehend it.
> Such contention is utterly fallacious and inadmissible. It is actuated solely by arrogance
> and pride. Its motive is to lead the people astray from the Ridvan of divine good-pleasure
> and to tighten the reins of their authority over the people. And yet, in the sight of God,
> these common people are infinitely superior and exalted above their religious leaders who
> have turned away from the one true God. The understanding of His words and the
> comprehension of the utterances of the Birds of Heaven are in no wise dependent upon
> human learning. They depend solely upon purity of heart, chastity of soul, and freedom
> of spirit. This is evidenced by those who, today, though without a single letter of the
> accepted standards of learning, are occupying the loftiest seats of knowledge; and the
> garden of their hearts is adorned, through the showers of divine grace, with the roses of
> wisdom and the tulips of understanding. Well is it with the sincere in heart for their share
> of the light of a mighty Day!143

In Kitáb-i-Aqdas, his Book of laws, Bahá’u’lláh writes of this language of Scripture that is
meant to be understood literally, in its outward sense:

> Whoso layeth claim to a Revelation direct from God, ere the expiration of a full thousand
> years, such a man is assuredly a lying impostor. We pray God that He may graciously
> assist him to retract and repudiate such claim. Should he repent, God will, no doubt,
> forgive him. If, however, he persisteth in his error, God will, assuredly, send down one
> who will deal mercilessly with him. Terrible, indeed, is God in punishing! Whosoever
> interpreteth this verse otherwise than its obvious meaning is deprived of the Spirit of God
> and of His mercy which encompasseth all created things. Fear God, and follow not your
> idle fancies. (K37)
In Kitáb-i-Aqdas, and in Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, Bahá’u’lláh warns against those
who would alter the evident meaning of the divine language:

> Whoso interpreteth what hath been sent down from the heaven of Revelation, and
> altereth its evident meaning, he, verily, is of them that have perverted the Sublime Word
> of God, and is of the most ones in the Lucid Book.144

In a long passage in the Kitáb-i-Íqán145, Bahá’u’lláh explains the meaning of perverting
the Word of God as the alteration of its meaning based on self interest. Immediately
following the passage last cited, Bahá’u’lláh writes in Kitáb-i-Aqdas:

> It hath been enjoined upon you to pare your nails, to bathe yourselves each week in water
> that covereth your bodies, and to clean yourselves with whatsoever ye have formerly
> employed. Take heed lest through negligence ye fail to observe that which hath been
> prescribed unto you by Him Who is the Incomparable, the Gracious. Immerse yourselves
> in clean water; it is not permissible to bathe yourselves in water that hath already been
> used. See that ye approach not the public pools of Persian baths; whoso maketh his way
> toward such baths will smell their fetid odour ere he entereth therein. Shun them, O
> people, and be not of those who ignominiously accept such vileness. In truth, they are as
> sinks of foulness and contamination, if ye be of them that apprehend. Avoid ye likewise
> the malodorous pools in the courtyards of Persian homes, and be ye of the pure and

> sanctified. Truly, We desire to behold you as manifestations of paradise on earth, that
> there may be diffused from you such fragrance as shall rejoice the hearts of the favoured
> of God. If the bather, instead of entering the water, wash himself by pouring it upon his
> body, it shall be better for him and shall absolve him of the need for bodily immersion.
> The Lord, verily, hath willed, as a bounty from His presence, to make life easier for you
> that ye may be of those who are truly thankful.146

In Lawh-i-Ta'vil Bahá’u’lláh insists that his commandments not be interpreted
figuratively, and in so doing, we find him referring to exactly the same theme as the verse
cited above:

> The purpose of figurative interpretation (ta'víl) is not that one be deprived of the outward
> sense of the verse, nor that its intent be veiled. For instance, let us say that from the
> heaven of the divine will the command is revealed, "Wash your faces." Do not interpret it
> figuratively, saying that the intent is that one should wash the countenance of one’s inner
> self, cleansing it with the water of mystical insight, and so forth. For in this manner a
> person might, by reason of such a figurative interpretation, continue to have a
> malodorous face soiled with dirt, yet be convinced in his own mind that he had carried
> out the very essence of God's decree. For in this station it is clear and obvious that the
> intent is that the face be washed with physical water.147

In Tafsir Suratu'l-Shams Bahá’u’lláh advises against explaining away and missing out on
the meaning of the literal verses:

> …whoso concentrateth on the metaphorical sense to the exclusion of the prosaic meaning
> is heedless. 148

Most of the verses which are meant to be understood literally pertain to the ethical
counsels and commandments. This is indicated by many verses, including the following:

> Thou seest, O God of Mercy, Thou Whose power pervadeth all created things, these
> servants of Thine, Thy thralls, who, according to the good-pleasure of Thy Will, observe
> in the daytime the fast prescribed by Thee, who arise, at the earliest dawn of day, to make
> mention of Thy Name, and to celebrate Thy praise, in the hope of obtaining their share
> of the goodly things that are treasured up within the treasuries of Thy grace and
> bounty.149
> In the Prayer of Fasting150 We have revealed: “Should Thy Will decree that out of Thy
> mouth these words proceed and be addressed unto them, ‘Observe, for My Beauty’s sake,
> the fast151, O people, and set no limit to its duration,’ I swear by the majesty of Thy glory,
> that every one of them will faithfully observe it, will abstain from whatsoever will violate
> Thy law, and will continue to do so until they yield up their souls unto Thee.” In this
> consisteth the complete surrender of one’s will to the Will of God. Meditate on this, that
> thou mayest drink in the waters of everlasting life which flow through the words of the
> Lord of all mankind, and mayest testify that the one true God hath ever been
> immeasurably exalted above His creatures. He, verily, is the Incomparable, the Ever-
> Abiding, the Omniscient, the All-Wise. The station of absolute self-surrender
> transcendeth, and will ever remain exalted above, every other station. It behoveth thee to
> consecrate thyself to the Will of God. Whatsoever hath been revealed in His Tablets is

> but a reflection of His Will. So complete must be thy consecration, that every trace of
> worldly desire will be washed from thine heart. This is the meaning of true unity.152

If Bahá’u’lláh regarded it as permissible to interpret his ordinances allegorically,
symbolically, rather than literally, he would not have said that every one of his followers
would follow his command to set no limit to the fast until he died. Nor would he have
indicated that this literal interpretation and this strict observance of his laws constitutes
"complete surrender of one's will to the Will of God", nor that this "station of absolute
self-surrender transcendeth, and will ever remain exalted above, every other station" if his
laws could be interpreted in such a manner as not to require enactment and realization in
the physical world. He writes, in the same vein, in the opening of Kitáb-i-Aqdas:

> It behoveth every one who reacheth this most sublime station, this summit of
> transcendent glory, to observe every ordinance of Him Who is the Desire of the world.
> Neither is acceptable without the other. Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the
> Source of Divine inspiration. They whom God hath endued with insight will readily
> recognize that the precepts laid down by God constitute the highest means for the
> maintenance of order in the world and the security of its peoples. He that turneth away
> from them is accounted among the abject and foolish. We, verily, have commanded you
> to refuse the dictates of your evil passions and corrupt desires, and not to transgress the
> bounds which the Pen of the Most High hath fixed, for these are the breath of life unto all
> created things. The seas of Divine wisdom and Divine utterance have risen under the
> breath of the breeze of the All-Merciful. Hasten to drink your fill, O men of
> understanding! They that have violated the Covenant of God by breaking His
> commandments, and have turned back on their heels, these have erred grievously in the
> sight of God, the All-Possessing, the Most High.153

It is impossible to misread Bahá’u’lláh's intentions here. And his intentions would be
completely foiled were it permissible to interpret the language of His laws and ethical
counsels in an allegorical fashion. In a Tablet revealed subsequent to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas,
he writes:

> While in prison We have revealed a Book which We have entitled `The Most Holy Book'.
> We have enacted laws therein and adorned it with the commandments of thy Lord, Who
> exerciseth authority over all that are in the heavens and on the earth. Say: Take hold of
> it, O people, and observe that which hath been sent down in it of the wondrous precepts
> of your Lord, the Forgiving, the Bountiful. It will truly prosper you both in this world and
> in the next and will purge you of whatsoever ill beseemeth you. He is indeed the
> Ordainer, the Expounder, the Giver, the Generous, the Gracious, the All-Praised.154

In one of his earliest treatises, a letter to Shaykh Muhyi'd-Dín-i-Kháníqí, known as the
Haft Vadi, Bahá’u’lláh insists that the spiritual path must include the faithful observance of
laws, and as we have seen, the faithful observance of laws is impossible unless we interpret
the verses pertaining to those laws in a literal, straightforward fashion:

> In all these journeys the traveler must stray not the breadth of a hair from the “Law,”
> [shari'a] for this is indeed the secret of the “Path” [t.ariqa] and the fruit of the Tree of
> “Truth” [h.aqiqa]; and in all these stages he must cling to the robe of obedience to the

> :commandments, and hold fast to the cord of shunning all forbidden things, that he may
> be nourished from the cup of the Law and informed of the mysteries of Truth.155

There are two exceptions to the general accessibility of the divine commandments which
are not related to the interpretation of the language in which they are composed, but
rather to questions of timeliness and appropriateness in light of factors of an entirely
different nature. Bahá’u’lláh indicated that his laws would be gradually established
among his followers, by his own practice during his ministry and through his Writings.
Speaking of the gradual and progressive revelation of the teachings of the new
Manifestation, Bahá’u’lláh writes:

> Indeed, the laws of God are like unto the ocean and the children of men as fish, did they
> but know it. However, in observing them one must exercise tact and wisdom... Since most

The Kitáb-i-Aqdas itself beareth eloquent testimony to the loving providence of God.156

‘Abdu’l-Bahá took the same approach to the establishment of Bahá’í laws, insisting upon
strict observance of most of the laws that pertain to personal behavior by the Iranian
Bahá’is who were familiar with the full text of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, but more gradually
instituting those laws in other parts of the world, among Bahá’is who did not have access
to that text. Shoghi Effendi continued in the same vein, but inasmuch as his ministry is
regarded as another step forward in the maturation of the Bahá’í community, his remarks
are more definite, his expectations are higher:

> The laws revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in the Aqdas are, whenever practicable and not in
> direct conflict with the Civil Law of the land, absolutely binding on every believer or
> Bahá’í institution whether in the East or in the West. Certain laws should be regarded by
> all believers as universally and vitally applicable at the present time. Others have been
> formulated in anticipation of a state of society destined to emerge from the chaotic
> conditions that prevail today...What has not been formulated in the Aqdas, in addition to
> matters of detail and of secondary importance arising out of the application of the laws
> already formulated by Bahá’u’lláh, will have to be enacted by the Universal House of
> Justice. This body can supplement but never invalidate or modify in the least degree what
> has already been formulated by Bahá’u’lláh. Nor has the Guardian any right whatsoever
> to lessen the binding effect much less to abrogate the provisions of so fundamental and
> sacred a Book.157

The Universal House of Justice has reiterated this principle by citing the words of
Bahá’u’lláh and Shoghi Effendi in its Introduction to "The Synopsis and Codification of
the Kitáb-i-Aqdas" in 1974 and its Preface to "The Kitáb-i-Aqdas" in 1992. In 1974 the
Universal House of Justice addressed a letter to the National Spiritual Assembly of the
Bahá’ís of Iceland, listing the laws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas that were not at that time binding
upon Bahá’ís in the West. Its letter to the Bahá’ís of the world in Ridvan 1992 made the
law of Huququ'llah binding upon all believers. In 9 May 1993 the Universal House of

Justice sent a copy of the 1974 letter addressed to the National Spiritual Assembly of the
Bahá’ís of Iceland to every National Spiritual Assembly, also noting that in Ridvan 1992
the law of Huququ'llah had become binding universally. On 28 December 1999, the
Universal House of Justice made universally binding all laws pertaining to fasting and
prayer. On 8 February 2001, the Universal House of Justice directed its Secretariat to
update all National Spiritual Assemblies on the status of these communications, and this
letter is reproduced in full in the endnotes.158
RESPONSE TO OUTWARD LANGUAGE
We have introduced the first kind of divine language, the outward language, meant to be
understood literally, meant to be comprehended by everyone, meant to be put into
practice. This is the most important dimension of religion, which is why it is accessible to
everyone. Not everyone can understand everything, but everyone can understand the
counsels and commandments, and in so doing, they attain to the "highest station", which
is "the surrender of one's will to the Will of God." While Bahá’u’lláh values insight and
intelligence, eloquence and skill, creativity and inventiveness, above all he values enacting
the divine counsels and commandments.

> Let deeds, not words, be your adorning.159
> Strive that your deeds may be cleansed from the dust of self and hypocrisy and find favor
> at the court of glory; for ere long the assayers of mankind shall, in the holy presence of the
> Adored One, accept naught but absolute virtue and deeds of stainless purity.160
> Guidance hath ever been given by words, and now it is given by deeds. Every one must
> show forth deeds that are pure and holy, for words are the property of all alike, whereas
> such deeds as these belong only to Our loved ones. Strive then with heart and soul to

> Say: Beware, O people of Bahá, lest ye walk in the ways of them whose words differ from

> regarded as the hosts of God, likewise is His blessed and holy Word. These hosts are the
> lodestone of the hearts of men and the effective means for unlocking doors. Of all the
> weapons in the world this is the keenest.168

THE VEILED AND CONCEALED LANGUAGE [mutashabihatun]
According to Bahá’u’lláh, the second kind of divine language employed by the
Manifestations of God is "veiled and concealed":

> The other language is veiled [h.ijáb] and concealed [satir],169 so that whatever lieth
> hidden in the heart of the malevolent may be made manifest and their innermost being
> be disclosed. Thus hath Sadiq, son of Muhammad, spoken: “God verily will test them
> and sift them.” This is the divine standard [mízán iláhí], this is the Touchstone of God,
> wherewith He proveth His servants. None apprehendeth the meaning of these utterances
> except them whose hearts are assured, whose souls have found favour with God, and
> whose minds are detached from all else but Him. In such utterances, the literal meaning,
> as generally understood by the people, is not what hath been intended. Thus it is
> recorded: “Every knowledge hath seventy meanings, of which one only is known
> amongst the people. And when the Qá’im shall arise, He shall reveal unto men all that
> which remaineth.” He also saith: “We speak one word, and by it we intend one and
> seventy meanings; each one of these meanings we can explain.”170

Bahá’u’lláh specifically identifies many passages of the divine verses that employ this
symbolic language and for which a literal interpretation is either inadequate or
inaccurate:

> This is the purpose underlying the symbolic words of the Manifestations of
> God…Hence, it is clear and manifest that by the words "the sun shall be darkened, and
> the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven" is intended the
> waywardness of the divines, and the annulment of laws firmly established by divine
> Revelation, all of which, in symbolic language, have been fore-shadowed by the
> Manifestations of God. None except the righteous shall partake of this cup, none but the
> godly shall share therein. "The righteous shall drink of a cup tempered at the camphor
> fountain." [Qur’án 76:5]171

> Consider now, had the people of the Gospel recognized the meaning of the symbolic
> terms “sun” and “moon,” had they sought, unlike the froward and perverse,
> enlightenment from Him Who is the Revealer of divine knowledge, they would have
> surely comprehended the purpose of these terms, and would not have become afflicted
> and oppressed by the darkness of their selfish desires. Yea, but since they have failed to
> acquire true knowledge from its very Source, they have perished in the perilous vale of
> waywardness and misbelief.172
> And as the commentators of the Qur’án have failed to grasp the symbolic meaning of
> these “Suns,” they therefore were at pains to interpret the above-quoted verse.173
> The symbolic term “smoke” denotes grave dissensions, the abrogation and demolition
> of recognized standards, and the utter destruction of their narrow-minded exponents.174
> Notwithstanding the warning which, in marvelously symbolic language and subtle
> allusions, hath been uttered in days past, and which was intended to awaken the
> peoples of the world and to prevent them from being deprived of their share of the
> billowing ocean of God's grace, yet such things as have already been witnessed have come
> to pass!175
> Little perception is required to enable them to gather from the symbolic language of
> these two verses all that We have purposed to propound, and thus to attain, through the
> grace of the All-Merciful, the resplendent morn of certitude.176
> Reflect, how this symbolic language, more eloquent than any speech, however direct,
> testifieth to the non-existence of a true believer.177
‘Abdu’l-Bahá confirms this principle in a number of statements:

> This is the outward meaning of these verses of the Revelation of St. John; but they have
> another explanation and a symbolic sense, which is as follows: the Law of God is
> divided into two parts.178
> The iron rod is a symbol of power and might—it is not a sword—and means that with
> divine power and might He will shepherd all the nations of the earth. This son is the
> Báb.179
> It is clear and evident that these signs have symbolic signification, and that they are not
> literal. They are fully explained in the Kitáb-i-Íqán. Refer to it.180
> Therefore, this story of Adam and Eve who ate from the tree, and their expulsion from
> Paradise, must be thought of simply as a symbol. It contains divine mysteries and
> universal meanings, and it is capable of marvelous explanations. Only those who are
> initiated into mysteries, and those who are near the Court of the All-Powerful, are aware
> of these secrets. Hence these verses of the Bible have numerous meanings.181
> For according to the terminology of the Holy Books, this reference is to the Law, the
> woman being its symbol here. And the two luminaries, the sun and the moon, are the
> two thrones, the Turkish and the Persian, these two being under the rule of the Law of
> God. The sun is the symbol of the Persian Empire, and the moon, that is, the crescent, of
> the Turkish.182

Chapter 16 of "Some Answered Questions" is devoted to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s remarks about
the symbolic verses of Scripture183. In his talks in North America and Europe, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá made many references to the symbolic nature of the sacred text, and some of these
are also cited in an endnote184.
Now to return to Bahá’u’lláh, in his discussion of the second kind of divine language, he
indicates that it serves as a test whereby "whatever lieth hidden in the heart of the
malevolent may be made manifest and their innermost being be disclosed". This aligns
perfectly with the Qur’ánic verse: "But those in whose hearts is perversity pursue such
thereof as are susceptible of different interpretations, seeking discord and seeking wrong
interpretation of it."185 Bahá’u’lláh reiterates this point throughout Kitáb-i-Íqán:

> Know verily that the purpose underlying all these symbolic terms and abstruse allusions,
> which emanate from the Revealers of God’s holy Cause, hath been to test and prove the
> peoples of the world; that thereby the earth of the pure and illuminated hearts may be
> known from the perishable and barren soil. From time immemorial such hath been the
> way of God amidst His creatures, and to this testify the records of the sacred books.186
> Yea, such things as throw consternation into the hearts of all men come to pass only that
> each soul may be tested by the touchstone of God, that the true may be known and
> distinguished from the false….
> But inasmuch as the divine Purpose hath decreed that the true should be known from the
> false, and the sun from the shadow, He hath, therefore, in every season sent down upon
> mankind the showers of tests from His realm of glory.187
> The All-Glorious hath decreed these very things, that are contrary to the desires of
> wicked men, to be the touchstone and standard whereby He proveth His servants, that
> the just may be known from the wicked, and the faithful distinguished from the infidel.188
> And yet they bear witness to this well-known tradition: “Verily Our Word is abstruse,
> bewilderingly abstruse.” In another instance, it is said: “Our Cause is sorely trying, highly
> perplexing; none can bear it except a favorite of heaven, or an inspired Prophet, or he
> whose faith God hath tested.” These leaders of religion admit that none of these three
> specified conditions is applicable to them. The first two conditions are manifestly beyond
> their reach; as to the third, it is evident that at no time have they been proof against those
> tests that have been sent by God, and that when the divine Touchstone appeared, they
> have shown themselves to be naught but dross.189
> Furthermore, the sign of truth and falsehood is designated and appointed in the Book. By
> this divinely-appointed touchstone, the claims and pretensions of all men must needs be
> assayed, so that the truthful may be known and distinguished from the imposter.190

This is the divine standard, the Touchstone. We find Bahá’u’lláh speaking of this divine
standard in other verses, and warning against measuring this standard by any scale
besides itself:

> Say: I am come to you, O people, from the Throne of glory, and bear you an
> announcement from God, the Most Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. In mine
> hand I carry the testimony of God, your Lord and the Lord of your sires of old. Weigh it
> with the just Ba-

> lance that ye possess, the Balance of the testimony of the Prophets and Messengers of
> God. If ye find it to be established in truth, if ye believe it to be of God, beware, then, lest
> ye cavil at it, and render your works vain, and be numbered with the infidels. It is indeed
> the sign of
> God that hath been sent down through the power of truth, through which the validity of
> His Cause hath been demonstrated unto His creatures, and the ensigns of purity lifted up
> betwixt earth and heaven.191
> Say: O leaders of religion! Weigh not the Book of God with such standards and sciences
> as are current amongst you, for the Book itself is the unerring Balance established
> amongst men. In this most perfect Balance whatsoever the peoples and kindreds possess
> must be weighed, while the measure of its weight should be tested according to its own
> standard, did ye but know it.192

The divine standard, the Touchstone then is the Word of God, and particularly the
"abstruse" Word, and through it the spiritually ignorant and blind may be distinguished
from the spiritually knowledgeable and perceptive. How does Bahá’u’lláh describe those
who comprehend the "abstruse" Word?

> None apprehendeth the meaning of these utterances except them whose hearts are
> assured, whose souls have found favour with God, and whose minds are detached from all
> else but Him.193

This echoes the Qur’ánic verse: "And none knows its right interpretation except God
and those whose are firmly grounded in knowledge."194 There are several meanings of
this verse according to Bahá’u’lláh. The superlative connotation of this expression--
firmly grounded in knowledge--is the Manifestation of God:

> With fixed and steady gaze, born of the unerring eye of God, scan for a while the horizon
> of divine knowledge, and contemplate those words of perfection which the Eternal hath
> revealed, that haply the mysteries of divine wisdom, hidden ere now beneath the veil of
> glory and treasured within the tabernacle of His grace, may be made manifest unto you…
> It is obvious and manifest that the true meaning of the utterances of the
> Birds of Eternity is revealed to none except those that manifest the Eternal
> Being, and the melodies of the Nightingale of Holiness can reach no ear save
> that of the denizens of the everlasting realm…Even as He saith: 'None knoweth the
> meaning thereof except God and them that are well grounded in knowledge.' And yet, they have
> sought the interpretation of the Book from those that are wrapt in veils, and have refused
> to seek enlightenment from the fountainhead of knowledge.195
> In God We put our trust, and to Him We cry for help, that haply there may flow
> from this pen that which shall quicken the souls of men, that they may all arise
> from their beds of heedlessness and hearken unto the rustling of the leaves of
> Paradise, from the tree which the hand of divine power hath, by the
> permission of God, planted in the Ridvan of the All-Glorious.196
> Make haste, O my brother, that while there is yet time our lips may taste of the immortal
> draught, for the breeze of life, now blowing from the city of the Well-Beloved, cannot last,
> and the streaming river of holy utterance must needs be stilled, and the portals of the
> Ridvan cannot for ever remain open. The day will surely come when the Nightingale of

Paradise will have winged its flight away from its earthly abode unto its heavenly nest.
Then will its melody be heard no more, and the beauty of the rose cease to shine. Seize
the time, therefore, ere the glory of the divine springtime hath spent itself, and the Bird of
Eternity ceased to warble its melody, that thy inner hearing may not be deprived of
hearkening unto its call. This is My counsel unto thee and unto the beloved of God.197
Had they sought with a humble mind from the Manifestations of God in every
Dispensation the true meaning of these words revealed in the sacred books-
-words the misapprehension of which hath caused men to be deprived of the recognition
of the Sadratu'l-Muntaha, the ultimate Purpose--they surely would have been guided to
the light of the Sun of Truth, and would have discovered the mysteries of divine
knowledge and wisdom.198
Thus We instruct thee in the interpretation of the traditions, and reveal unto thee
the mysteries of divine wisdom, that haply thou mayest comprehend the meaning thereof,
and be of them that have quaffed the cup of divine knowledge and understanding.199
If these divines be illumined by the light of the latter Revelation they will be
acceptable unto God, and will shine with a light everlasting. Otherwise, they will be
declared as darkened, even though to outward seeming they be leaders of men, inasmuch
as belief and unbelief, guidance and error, felicity and misery, light and darkness, are all
dependent upon the sanction of Him Who is the Day-star of Truth. Whosever
among the divines of every age receiveth, in the Day of Reckoning, the testimony of faith
from the Source of true knowledge, he verily becometh the recipient of learning, of divine
favour, and of the light of true understanding. Otherwise, he is branded as guilty of folly,
denial, blasphemy, and oppression.
It is evident and manifest unto every discerning observer that even as the light of the star
fadeth before the effulgent splendour of the sun, so doth the luminary of earthly
knowledge, of wisdom, and understanding vanish into nothingness when
brought face to face with the resplendent glories of the Sun of Truth, the
Day-star of divine enlightenment.200
Consider now, had the people of the Gospel recognized the meaning of the symbolic
terms 'sun' and 'moon,' had they sought, unlike the forward and perverse,
enlightenment from Him Who is the Revealer of divine knowledge, they
would surely have comprehended the purpose of these terms, and would not
have become afflicted and oppressed by the darkness of their selfish desires. Yea, but
since they have failed to acquire true knowledge from its very Source, they
have perished in the perilous vale of waywardness and misbelief. They still have not
awakened to perceive that all the signs foretold have been made manifest, that the
promised Sun hath risen above the horizon of divine Revelation, and that the 'sun' and
'moon' of the teachings, the laws, and learning of a former Dispensation have darkened
and set.201
Little perception is required to enable them to gather from the symbolic language of these
two verses all that We have purposed to propound, and thus to attain, through the grace
of
the All-Merciful, the resplendent morn of certitude. Such are the strains of celestial
melody which the immortal Bird of Heaven, warbling upon the Sadrih of
Bahá, poureth out upon thee, that, by the permission of God, thou mayest tread the
path of divine knowledge and wisdom.202

And yet they bear witness to this well-known tradition: "Verily Our Word is abstruse,
bewilderingly abstruse." In another instance, it is said: "Our Cause is sorely trying,
highly perplexing; none can bear it except a favorite of heaven, or an inspired
Prophet, or he whose faith God hath tested." These leaders of religion admit that none
of these three specified conditions is applicable to them. The first two conditions are
manifestly beyond their reach; as to the third, it is evident that at no time have they been
proof against those tests that have been sent by God, and that when the divine
Touchstone appeared, they have shown themselves to be naught but
dross.203
Yea, inasmuch as the peoples of the world have failed to seek from the luminous and
crystal Springs of divine knowledge the inner meaning of God's holy words, they
therefore have languished, stricken and sore athirst, in the vale of idle fancy and
waywardness.204
Inasmuch as these undiscerning and wretched souls have failed to apprehend the true
meaning of "Resurrection" and of the "attainment unto the divine Presence," they
therefore have remained utterly deprived of the grace thereof. Although the sole and
fundamental purpose of all learning, and the toil and labour thereof, is attainment unto,
and the recognition of, this station, yet they are all immersed in the pursuit of their
material studies. They deny themselves every moment of leisure, and utterly
ignore Him, Who is the Essence of all learning, and the one Object of their quest.
Methinks, their lips have never touched the cup of divine Knowledge, nor do they seem
to have attained even a dewdrop of the showers of heavenly grace.205
Were We to expound its inner meanings and unfold its hidden mysteries, eternity would
never suffice to exhaust their import, nor would the universe be capable of hearing them!
God verily testifieth to the truth of Our saying!206
Those words uttered by the Luminaries of Truth must needs be pondered, and should
their significance be not grasped, enlightenment should be sought from the Trustees of
the depositories of Knowledge, that these may expound their meaning, and unravel their
mystery. For it behooveth no man to interpret the holy words according to his own
imperfect understanding, nor, having found them to be contrary to his inclination and
desires, to reject and repudiate the truth. For such, today, is the manner of the divines
and doctors of the age, who occupy the seats of knowledge and learning, and who have
named ignorance knowledge, and called oppression justice. Were these to ask the
Light of Truth concerning those images which their idle fancy hath carved,
and were they to find His answer inconsistent with their own conceptions
and their own understanding of the Book, they would assuredly denounce
Him Who is the Mine and Wellhead of all Knowledge as the very negation of
understanding. Such things have happened in every age.207
Even as thou dost witness how the people of the Qur’án, like unto the people of old, have
allowed the words “Seal of the Prophets” to veil their eyes. And yet, they themselves
testify to this verse: “None knoweth the interpretation thereof but God and they that are well-grounded
in knowledge.” And when He Who is well-grounded in all knowledge, He Who is
the Mother, the Soul, the Secret, and the Essence thereof, revealeth that
which is the least contrary to their desire, they bitterly oppose Him and
shamelessly deny Him. These thou hast already heard and witnessed. Such deeds

> and words have been solely instigated by leaders of religion, they that worship no God
> but their own desire, who bear allegiance to naught but gold, who are wrapt in the
> densest veils of learning, and who, enmeshed by its obscurities, are lost in the wilds of
> error. Even as the Lord of being hath explicitly declared: “What thinkest thou? He who
> hath made a God of his passions, and whom God causeth to err through a knowledge,
> and whose ears and whose heart He hath sealed up, and over whose sight He hath cast a
> veil—who, after his rejection by God, shall guide such a one? Will ye not then be
> warned?”[Qur’án 45:22]208
> For whatsoever hath come to pass, hath been prophesied by them who are the Mines of
> divine knowledge, and Recipients of God's eternal law.209
> We entreat the learned men of the Bayan not to follow in such ways, not to inflict, at the
> time of Mustaghath, upon Him Who is the divine Essence, the heavenly Light, the
> Absolute Eternity, the Beginning and the End of the Manifestations of the Invisible, that
> which hath been inflicted in this day. We beg them not to depend upon their intellect,
> their comprehension and learning, nor to contend with the Revealer of celestial and
> infinite knowledge.210
> We perceive none, however, amongst the people of the earth who, sincerely yearning for
> the Truth, seeketh the guidance of the divine Manifestations concerning the abstruse
> matters of his Faith. All are dwellers in the land of oblivion, and all are followers of the
> people of wickedness and rebellion. God will verily do unto them that which they
> themselves are doing, and will forget them even as they have ignored His Presence in His
> day. Such is His
> decree unto those that have denied Him, and such will it be unto them that have rejected
> His signs.211

In other Tablets, Bahá’u’lláh systematically establishes the same principle, that it is the
Manifestation of God who is the fountainhead and source of all divine knowledge, and
that we are to turn to him at all times and under all circumstances:

> Should differences arise amongst you over any matter, refer It to God while the Sun
> still shineth above the horizon of this Heaven and, when it hath set, refer ye to
> whatsoever hath been sent down by Him. This, verily, is sufficient unto the peoples of the
> world.212
> Whatsoever ye understand not in the Bayan, ask it of God, Your Lord and the Lord of
> your forefathers. Should He so desire, He will expound for you that which is
> revealed therein, and disclose to you the pearls of Divine knowledge and wisdom that
> lie concealed within the ocean of its words. He, verily, is supreme over all names; no God
> is there but Him, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.213

The second meaning of "those firmly grounded in knowledge" is that it refers to the
"chosen ones" of the Manifestation of God, those whom he chooses to interpret his
teachings subsequent to the completion of his ministry. He affirms that in the
Dispensation of Muhammad these were the twelve Imams:

> From the sayings of those Masters of holy utterance, Who have expounded the
> meaning of true knowledge, the odour of these dark teachings, which have obscured
> the world, can in no wise be detected.214
> As they understood not the significance of these noble sayings, nor sought enlightenment
> from the recognized expounders of the Faith, that these might confer a sprinkling of
> the Kawthar of divine knowledge upon them, therefore such fires of mischief were
> kindled amongst men.215

Bahá’u’lláh also refers to these "chosen ones" in more general terms, encompassing all of
the divine Dispensations:

> Those words uttered by the Luminaries of Truth must needs be pondered, and should
> their significance be not grasped, enlightenment should be sought from the
> Trustees of the depositories of Knowledge, that these may expound their
> meaning, and unravel their mystery. For it behooveth no man to interpret the holy words
> according to his own imperfect understanding, nor, having found them to be contrary to
> his inclination and desires, to reject and repudiate the truth. For such, today, is the
> manner of the divines and doctors of the age, who occupy the seats of knowledge and
> learning, and who have named ignorance knowledge, and called oppression justice.
> Were these to ask the Light of Truth concerning those images which their idle fancy hath
> carved, and were they to find His answer inconsistent with their own conceptions and
> their own understanding of the Book, they would assuredly denounce Him Who is the
> Mine and Wellhead of all Knowledge as the very negation of understanding. Such things
> have happened in every age.216
> These things We mention only that the people may not be dismayed because of certain
> traditions and utterances, which have not yet been literally fulfilled, that they may rather
> attribute their perplexity to their own lack of understanding, and not to the non-
> fulfillment of the promises in the traditions, inasmuch as the meaning intended by the
> Imams of the Faith is not known by this people, as evidenced by the traditions themselves.
> The people, therefore, must not allow such utterances to deprive them of the divine
> bounties, but should rather seek enlightenment from them who are the
> recognized Expounders thereof, so that the hidden mysteries may be unravelled,
> and be made manifest unto them.217
> Know assuredly that just as thou firmly believest that the Word of God, exalted be His
> glory, endureth forever, thou must, likewise, believe with undoubting faith that its
> meaning can never be exhausted. They who are its appointed interpreters, they whose
> hearts are the repositories of its secrets, are, however, the only ones who can comprehend
> its manifold wisdom.218

The standard beliefs amongst the Bahá’ís is that the "chosen ones" in their Faith are
‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi, and that this is indicated by Bahá’u’lláh in Kitáb-i-
Aqdas and Kitáb-i-'Ahdi and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Will and Testament:

> When the ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the Book of My revelation is ended, turn
> your faces toward Him Whom God hath purposed, Who hath branched219 from this
> Ancient Root.220

> O people of the world! When the Mystic Dove will have winged its flight from its
> Sanctuary of Praise and sought its far-off goal, its hidden habitation, refer ye whatsoever
> ye understand not in the Book to Him Who hath branched221 from this mighty Stock.222
> The Will of the divine Testator is this: It is incumbent upon the Aghsan, the Afnan and
> My Kindred to turn, one and all, their faces towards the Most Mighty Branch.223
> Consider that which We have revealed in Our Most Holy Book: ‘When the ocean of My
> presence hath ebbed and the Book of My Revelation is ended, turn your faces toward

‘Abdu’l-Bahá affirmed his authority as Expounder225 and Interpreter226 of the Bahá’í
teachings and Writings in a number of Tablets and talks, and indicated that the
appointment of a Centre of the Covenant by Bahá’u’lláh was one of the distinctive
teachings of the Bahá’í Dispensation:

> As to the most great characteristic of the revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, a specific teaching not
> given by any of the Prophets of the past: It is the ordination and appointment of the
> Center of the Covenant. By this appointment and provision He has safeguarded and
> protected the religion of God against differences and schisms, making it impossible for
> anyone to create a new sect or faction of belief.227

Shoghi Effendi calls ‘Abdu’l-Bahá the Expounder228 and Interpreter229 of the Faith in a
number of his letters and in his history of the Bahá’í Faith. In his Will and Testament,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá appointed Shoghi Effendi as the Interpreter of the Faith after his demise:

> O my loving friends! After the passing away of this wronged one, it is incumbent upon the
> Aghsan (Branches), the Afnan (Twigs) of the Sacred Lote-Tree, the Hands (pillars) of the
> Cause of God and the loved ones of the Abha Beauty to turn unto Shoghi Effendi—the
> youthful branch branched from the two hallowed and sacred Lote-Trees and the fruit
> grown from the union of the two offshoots of the Tree of Holiness,—as he is the sign of
> God, the chosen branch, the Guardian of the Cause of God, he unto whom all the
> Aghsan, the Afnan, the Hands of the Cause of God and His loved ones must turn. He is
> the Interpreter of the Word of God…230

Shoghi Effendi also reiterated ‘Abdu’l-Bahá's authority as Interpreter, as well as his own
in a number of letters written on his behalf231. Here are excerpts from a couple of those
letters:

> The Beloved Guardian has noted your letter of February 15th, addressed to the National
> Teaching Committee, other committees and Local Assemblies giving advice concerning
> Teaching methods in Canada. The Beloved Guardian noted that in paragraph three you
> mention that no teachers have the authority to interpret more accurately than others: that
> every teacher is bound to interpret to some degree but the more he appreciates the Faith,
> the less will he be inclined to be dogmatic, etc. The Guardian feels that this paragraph
> will cause great confusion amongst the friends. The Will and Testament of Bahá’u’lláh
> and the Will and Testament of the Master clearly and explicitly indicate that the
> Interpreter of the Word was the Centre of the Covenant and now is the Guardian.

> There are no other Interpreters whatsoever and no individual may interpret. This is
> strictly forbidden. No doubt the intent of this paragraph was to indicate that the Bahá’í
> teachers in making explanation of Divine Truths must give their understanding of the
> Divine Truths: explanations that have been clarified for them in study classes, summer
> schools, etc. Divine Truth is relative and that is why we are enjoined to constantly refer
> the seeker to the Word itself--and why any explanations we make to ease the journey of
> the soul of any individual must be based on the Word and the Word alone. If there is a
> wide divergence in the understandings of the Friends of the Teachings then the National
> Assembly should arrange for study classes on such points--and particularly the Summer
> Schools. The Guardian feels the letter of February 15th should be withdrawn.232
> He feels that there must have been some misapprehension on your part of his statements
> concerning future Guardians: they cannot 'abrogate' the interpretations of former
> Guardians, as this would imply not only lack of guidance but mistakes in making them;
> however they can elaborate and elucidate former interpretations, and can certainly
> abrogate some former ruling laid down as a temporary necessity by a former Guardian.233

Now that we have completed our exegesis of the second kind of language used by the
Manifestations of God, we come to a principle related to the hermeneutics of the
symbolic verses -- Bahá’u’lláh indicates that the symbolic verses do not have a literal
meaning that is well known to the people:

> In such utterances, the literal meaning, as generally understood by the people, is not what
> hath been intended.234

Bahá’u’lláh warns that many people have misunderstood the divine verses because they
invented literal interpretations for verses that were meant to be understood symbolically.
However, his purpose was not to encourage all symbolic interpretations, but rather to
point out that some verses have symbolic interpretations, and that these symbolic
meanings can be discerned, if we follow the guidance of the Manifestations. As we have
seen, it is the Manifestation and His "chosen ones" who reveal the true meanings of these
symbolic verses, and only under the guidance of these infallibly-guided ones is it remotely
possible for certain believers to discover the authentic meaning of symbolic verses without
deriving them directly from the holy utterances and holy writ. We will discuss this
spiritual gift under individual interpretation, in connection with the third meaning of
"those who are sound in knowledge". Some of the verses which Bahá’u’lláh indicates as
being mistakenly interpreted in a literal fashion when their true meaning was symbolic
are mentioned here:

> For when the latter saw the aforementioned passages in their Scriptures and heard the
> literal interpretations of their divines, they refused to recognize God in those who are
> the Manifestations of His unity, the Exponents of His singleness, and the Embodiments of
> His sanctity, and failed to believe in them and submit to their authority.235
> To interpret this city according to the literal meaning of the tradition would indeed
> prove impossible, nor can such a city ever be found. Wert thou to search the uttermost
> corners of

the earth, nay probe its length and breadth for as long as God’s eternity hath lasted and
His sovereignty will endure, thou wouldst never find a city such as they have described,
for the entirety of the earth could neither contain nor encompass it.236
Meditate then upon the utterance of one of the Prophets as He intimated to the souls of
men, through veiled allusions and hidden symbols, the glad-tidings of the One Who was
to come after Him, that thou mayest know of a certainty that their words are inscrutable
to all save those who are endued with an understanding heart. He saith: “His eyes were as
a flame of fire”, and “brass-like were His feet”, and “out of His mouth goeth a two-edged
sword”.50 How could these words be literally interpreted?237
Inasmuch as the Christian divines have failed to apprehend the meaning of these words,
and did not recognize their object and purpose, and have clung to the literal
interpretation of the words of Jesus, they therefore became deprived of the streaming
grace of the Muhammadan Revelation and its showering bounties.238
Judge fairly: Were the prophecies recorded in the Gospel to be literally fulfilled; were
Jesus, Son of Mary, accompanied by angels, to descend from the visible heaven upon the
clouds; who would dare to disbelieve, who would dare to reject the truth, and wax
disdainful?239
As they have literally interpreted the Word of God, and the sayings and traditions of
the Letters of Unity, and expounded them according to their own deficient
understanding, they have therefore deprived themselves and all their people of the
bountiful showers of the grace and mercies of God.240
Were they to be questioned concerning those signs that must needs herald the revelation
and rise of the sun of the Muhammadan Dispensation, to which We have already
referred, none of which have been literally fulfilled, and were it to be said to them:
“Wherefore have ye rejected the claims advanced by Christians and the peoples of other
faiths and regard them as infidels,” knowing not what answer to give, they will reply:
“These Books have been corrupted and are not, and never have been, of God.”241
Were the verse “And verily Our host shall conquer” to be literally interpreted, it is
evident that it would in no wise be applicable to the chosen Ones of God and His hosts,
inasmuch as Husayn, whose heroism was manifest as the sun, crushed and subjugated,
quaffed at last the cup of martyrdom in Karbila, the land of Taff. Similarly, the sacred
verse “Fain would they put out God’s light with their mouths: But God hath willed to
perfect His light, albeit the infidels abhor it.” Were it to be literally interpreted it
would never correspond with the truth. For in every age the light of God hath, to outward
seeming, been quenched by the peoples of the earth, and the Lamps of God extinguished
by them. How then could the ascendancy of the sovereignty of these Lamps be
explained?242
Could they seek to justify themselves by saying: “We have clung to a certain tradition,
and not having beheld the literal fulfilment thereof, we have therefore raised such
cavils against the Embodiments of divine Revelation, and kept remote from the law of
God?”243
These things We mention only that the people may not be dismayed because of certain
traditions and utterances, which have not yet been literally fulfilled, that they may

> rather attribute their perplexity to their own lack of understanding, and not to the non-
> fulfillment of the promises in the traditions, inasmuch as the meaning intended by the
> Imams of the Faith is not known by this people, as evidenced by the traditions
> themselves.244

We come finally to another principle regarding the interpretation of the symbolic verses
of Scripture -- its polyvalence, its multiplicity of meanings, and to the knowledge of that
multiplicity of meanings:

> Thus it is recorded: “Every knowledge hath seventy meanings, of which one only is
> known amongst the people. And when the Qá’im shall arise, He shall reveal unto men all
> that which remaineth.” He also saith: “We speak one word, and by it we intend one and
> seventy meanings; each one of these meanings we can explain.”245

These two ahadith express a principle that is also found in this hadith from the Imam
Ja'far al-Sadiq, interpreting a verse from the Qur’án:

> God here informs thee that the Word of God has no end, no termination, and It shall
> never cease at all.246
Bahá’u’lláh reiterates this principle in virtually identical wording:

> Know assuredly that just as thou firmly believest that the Word of God, exalted be His
> glory, endureth forever, thou must, likewise, believe with undoubting faith that its
> meaning can never be exhausted.247

Hence, the meaning of "seventy" and "seventy-one" is not that the symbolic significances
of the Word of God are limited to these numbers, but that, on the contrary, these
numbers represent the unlimited meanings the Word of God contains. The first of these
hadith indicated that only one of the infinite meanings of the symbolic language "is
known amongst the people", while the Qa'im will reveal them all when he appears. The
Qa'im was the Báb, and, following Bahá’u’lláh's principle of the unity of the
Manifestations, he represents every Manifestation. The Manifestation is able to explain
all the symbolic significances of the divine worlds. The second hadith indicates that the
divine word has infinite meanings, and that each one of these meanings can be
explained…by the revealer of that word. Likewise, the third hadith mentioned, which is
reiterated by Bahá’u’lláh, is followed by the following qualification: "They who are its
appointed interpreters, they whose hearts are the repositories of its secrets, are, however,
the only ones who can comprehend its manifold wisdom."248
HERMENEUTICAL PRINCIPLES: THE CHOSEN MUBAYYIN
Bahá’u’lláh insists that this prophecy related to his prophetic successor be interpreted
literally, according to its obvious meaning. If we have any doubt whatsoever of this
interpretation of his explanation, we find it confirmed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá249 and Shoghi
Effendi250 in the most literal of terms. Two other passages of Kitáb-i-Aqdas that
Bahá’u’lláh meant to be interpreted literally is the following:

> When the ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the Book of My Revelation is ended,
> turn your faces toward Him Whom God hath purposed, Who hath branched from this
> Ancient Root.251
> O people of the world! When the Mystic Dove will have winged its flight from its
> Sanctuary of Praise and sought its far-off goal, its hidden habitation, refer ye whatsoever
> ye understand not in the Book to Him Who hath branched from this mighty Stock.252

In his own Kitáb-i-'Ahd, Bahá’u’lláh indicates that this verse is to be understood
according to its literal meaning, an interpretation confirmed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá253 and
Shoghi Effendi254:

> The Will of the divine Testator is this: It is incumbent upon the Aghsan, the Afnan and
> My Kindred to turn, one and all, their faces towards the Most Mighty Branch. Consider
> that which We have revealed in Our Most Holy Book: ‘When the ocean of My presence
> hath ebbed and the Book of My Revelation is ended, turn your faces toward Him Whom
> God hath purposed, Who hath branched from this Ancient Root.’ The object of this
> sacred verse is none other except the Most Mighty Branch [Abdu’l-Bahá]. Thus have We
> graciously revealed unto you Our potent Will, and I am verily the Gracious, the All-
> Powerful. Verily God hath ordained the station of the Greater Branch [Muhammad Ali]
> to be beneath that of the Most Great Branch [Abdu’l-Bahá]. He is in truth the Ordainer,
> the All-Wise. We have chosen ‘the Greater’ after ‘the Most Great’, as decreed by Him
> Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.255

There are instances in which the literal meaning of the words written by Bahá’u’lláh has
been superseded by the interpretation of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. In Kitáb-i-Aqdas (K63),
Bahá’u’lláh warns a man "that ye take not unto yourselves more wives than two." The
import of this verse seems to have been that a man may take up to two wives at the same
time, but it would be preferable that he take only one wife. According to Bahá’í historian
Susan Maneck256, "In an untranslated letter257, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gave a believer permission
to take a second wife. He also indicated that the law concerning taking no more than two
wives cannot be abrogated." Having permitted bigamy, Bahá’u’lláh wrote, "Whoso
contenteth himself with a single partner from among the maidservants of God, both he
and she shall live in tranquility…Such is the ordinance which, in truth and justice, hath
been recorded by the Pen of Revelation." Maneck also points out, "He also noted that
this law was conditional upon justice which was a condition virtually impossible to fulfill,
but that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would not prevent believers from marrying a second wife if they
were certain they would act with justice."258 So far we have a strictly literal interpretation
of the law of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. However, subsequent to writing this, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote
in several letters259 that Bahá’u’lláh enjoined monogamy in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, including
the following very firm statement:

> Know thou that polygamy is not permitted under the law of God, for contentment with
> one wife hath been clearly stipulated.  Taking a second wife is made dependent upon
> equity and justice being upheld between the two wives, under all conditions. However,
> observance of justice and equity towards two wives is utterly impossible. The fact that
> bigamy has been made dependent upon an impossible condition is clear proof of its
> absolute prohibition. Therefore it is not permissible for a man to have more than one
> wife.260

While the first interpretation of this verse by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá might appear to be the more
literal of the two, inasmuch as Bahá’u’lláh indicated his preference that his followers
practice monogamy, in saying "whoso contenteth himself with a single partner…both he
and she shall live in tranquility", and as he indicated that this "ordinance…hath been
recorded by the Pen of Revelation…in truth and justice", the second interpretation,
which establishes monogamy and in the name of justice is in actuality the more narrow
interpretation of the text. The first interpretation would allow both for bigamy and
monogamy, while the second would allow only for monogamy, which was clearly
Bahá’u’lláh's preference. Shoghi Effendi adopted the latter interpretation, prescribing
monogamy, in all references to the law of marriage.261
A second example of the gradual implementation of a law, involving a first interpretation
and then a subsequent one pertains to the membership of women on the House of Justice.
The Board of Counsel elected by the Bahá’ís of Chicago, was initially composed (March
1900) of ten men, and subsequently expanded (June 1900) to nineteen members, some of
whom were women. In May 1900, at the insistence of Mirza Asadu'llah Isfahani262, a
House of Justice was elected, with nine members, all of whom were men. Mrs. Corinne
True was not satisfied with this state of affairs, and she wrote to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asking for
his guidance. In Jun 1902, she received his response, which included the following:

> Know thou, O handmaid, that in the sight of Bahá, women are accounted the same as
> men263, and God hath created all          humankind in His own image, and after His own
> likeness264. That is, men and women alike are the revealers of His names and attributes,
> and from the spiritual viewpoint there is no difference between them. Whosoever
> draweth nearer to God, that one is the most favoured, whether man or woman. How
> many a handmaid, ardent and devoted, hath, within the sheltering shade of Bahá, proved
> superior to the men, and surpassed the famous of the earth. The House of Justice,
> however, according to the explicit text of the Law of God, is confined to men265; this is for
> a wisdom of the Lord God's, which will ere long be made manifest as clearly as the sun at
> high noon266.
> As to you, O ye other handmaids who are enamored of the heavenly fragrances, arrange
> ye holy gatherings, and found ye Spiritual Assemblies, for these are the basis for spreading
> the sweet savours of God, exalting His Word, uplifting the lamp of His grace,
> promulgating His religion and promoting His Teachings, and what bounty is there
> greater than this?267

The wording of this Tablet was apparently confirmed by a second Tablet, addressed to a
Bahá’í woman, and dated 28 August 1913. This Tablet was translated and appended to
a collection of addresses given by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in 1911 and 1913, currently entitled
"Paris Talks":268

> O Thou my beloved daughter!
> Thine eloquent and fluent letter was perused in a garden, under the cool shade of a tree,
> while the gentle breeze was wafting. The means of physical enjoyment was spread before
> the eyes and thy letter became the cause of spiritual enjoyment. Truly, I say, it was not a
> letter but a rose-garden adorned with hyacinths and flowers.
> It contained the sweet fragrance of paradise and the zephyr of Divine Love blew from its
> roseate words.

> As I have not ample time at my disposal, I will give herein a brief, conclusive and
> comprehensive answer. It is as follows:
> In this Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, the women go neck and neck with the men. In no
> movement will they be left behind. Their rights with men are equal in degree. They will
> enter all the administrative branches of politics. They will attain in all such a degree as
> will be considered the very highest station of the world of humanity and will take part in
> all affairs. Rest ye assured. Do ye not look upon the present conditions; in the not far
> distant future the world of women will become all-refulgent and all-glorious, For His
> Holiness Bahá’u’lláh Hath Willed It so! At the time of elections the right to vote is the
> inalienable right of women, and the entrance of women into all human departments is an
> irrefutable and incontrovertible
> question. No soul can retard or prevent it.
> But there are certain matters, the participation in which is not worthy of women. For
> example, at the time when the community is taking up vigorous defensive measures
> against the attack of foes, the women are exempt from military engagements. It may so
> happen that at a given time warlike and savage tribes may furiously attack the body
> politic with the intention of carrying on a wholesale slaughter of its members; under such
> a circumstance defence is necessary, but it is the duty of men to organize and execute
> such defensive measures and not the women—because their hearts are tender and they
> cannot endure the sight of the horror of carnage, even if it is for the sake of defence. From
> such and similar undertakings the women are exempt.
> As regards the constitution of the House of Justice, Bahá’u’lláh addresses the men. He
> says: ‘O ye men of the House of Justice!’
> But when its members are to be elected, the right which belongs to women, so far as their
> voting and their voice is concerned, is indisputable. When the women attain to the
> ultimate degree of progress, then, according to the exigency of the time and place and
> their great capacity, they shall obtain extraordinary privileges. Be ye confident on these
> accounts. His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh has greatly strengthened the cause of women, and the
> rights and privileges of women is one of the greatest principles of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Rest ye
> assured! Ere long the days shall come when the men addressing the women, shall say:
> ‘Blessed are ye! Blessed are ye! Verily ye are worthy of every gift. Verily ye deserve to
> adorn your heads with the crown of everlasting glory, because in sciences and arts, in
> virtues and perfections ye shall become equal to man, and as regards tenderness of heart
> and the abundance of mercy and sympathy ye are superior’.

There was resistance from some American Bahá’í women to the establishment of an
exclusively male Bahá’í administrative body, and this resulted in further correspondence.
Mrs. True wrote a letter to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, asking for his guidance in resolving the
difference of opinion among the Bahá’ís in this matter:269

> There has existed a difference of opinion in our Assembly [that is, the Chicago Bahá'í
> community] as to how it should be governed. Every believer desires to carry out the
> Commands of the Blessed Perfection [Bahá'u'lláh] but we want to know from our Lord
> himself [that is, 'Abdu'l-Bahá] what these Commands are, as they are written in Arabic
> and we do not know Arabic. Will Our Lord write me direct from Acca and not have it go
> through any Interpretor [sic] in America and thus grant me the Authority to say the
> Master says thus & so, for he has written it to me . . . Many in our Assembly feel that the
> Governing Board in Chicago should be a mixed Board of both men & women. Woman
> in America stands so conspicuously for all that is highest & best in every department and
> for that reason it is contended the affairs should be in the hands of both sexes…

Mrs. True received a letter from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá dated 29 July 1909, initially translated by
Dr. Farid270, and here retranslated by a committee appointed by the Universal House of
Justice:

> According to the ordinances of the Faith of God, women are the equals of men in all
> rights save only that of membership on the Universal House of Justice [bayt al-'adl
> 'umumi], for, as hath been stated in the text of the Book, both the head and the members
> of the House of Justice are men. However, in all other bodies, such as the Temple
> Construction Committee, the Teaching Committee, the Spiritual Assembly, and in
> charitable and scientific associations, women share equally in all rights with men.271
In a subsequent letter to Louise Waite, dated 20 April 1910, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote:

> The Spiritual Assemblies which are organized for the sake of teaching the Truth, whether
> assemblies for men, assemblies for women or mixed assemblies, are all accepted and are
> conducive to the spreading of the Fragrances of God. This is essential.272

‘Abdu’l-Bahá went on to state that the time had not yet arrived for establishment of the
House of Justice, and he exhorted the men and women to conduct their affairs in
harmony with one another. In another Tablet addressed to the Bahá’ís of Cincinnati,
Ohio, he wrote:

> It is impossible to organize the House of Justice in these days; it will be formed after the
> establishment of the Cause of God. Now the Spiritual Assemblies are organized in most
> of the cities, you must also organize a Spiritual Assembly in Cincinnati. It is permissible
> to elect the members of the Spiritual Assembly from among the men and women; nay,
> rather, it is better so that perfect union may result.273

However, he did not approve of dissolving any of the already functioning all-male
administrative bodies. Rather than doing this, on 4 March 1911 he encouraged the
American Bahá’is to establish a separate all-female administrative institution:

> Now Spiritual Assemblies must be organized and that is for teaching the Cause of God.
> In that city you have a spiritual Assembly of men and you can establish a spiritual
> Assembly for women. Both Assemblies must be engaged in diffusing the fragrances of
> God and be occupied with the service of the Kingdom. The above is the best solution for
> this problem...274

The American Bahá’ís continued to have three kinds of administrative bodies--some all-
male, some all-female, and some of mixed gender. There were polarized sentiments
among them as to whether women should serve on the governing bodies of the Bahá’ís.
At this time, women had not yet been accorded the Constitutional right to vote--it had to
wait until 1921. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá's interpretation of the law of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas pertaining
to the membership of the House of Justice had originally been literal, then became
ambiguous (inasmuch as the administrative institutions were given new names and the
Bahá’ís were told that it was premature to form the House of Justice). In the case of the
Bahá’ís though, universal suffrage was to be established much earlier. In 1912, during his
visit to North America, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá made it understood that Houses of Justice would

ultimately be established in every municipality where Bahá’ís resided in sufficient
numbers to merit governance; that it was premature for Houses of Justice to be formed,
and that, in their place, Spiritual Assemblies should be founded, in order to administer
the affairs of the Faith; that the membership of these Spiritual Assemblies was open to
women and men alike; that only the Universal House of Justice (as indicated in His letter
of 1909 to Mrs. True) was to have an exclusively male membership. As reported in "Star
of the West",

> On Sunday evening, the 11th [of August 1912], the Chicago Assembly [meaning here, the
> whole Bahá’í community] selected a "Spiritual Meeting" of nine, composed of men and
> women, whose service--according to the wish of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá--is, first, to promulgate the
> teachings of the Revelation, and, second, to attend to other matters necessary to the
> welfare of the assembly.275

To recapitulate, the first interpretation of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, which was according to the
literal wording of Kitáb-i-Aqdas, excluded women from membership on the House of
Justice. The second interpretation, issued only seven years after the first, explicitly
indicated that the Universal House of Justice was to have an all-male membership.
However, in several letters as well as oral instructions given to the North American
Bahá’is while in visiting their continent in 1912, he clearly indicated that women were to
be eligible for membership on all Bahá’í administrative bodies with the sole exception of
the Universal House of Justice. This bears comparison with the second interpretation of
the Kitáb-i-Aqdas verse on bigamous marriage, which was reiterated by Shoghi Effendi.
Indeed, Shoghi Effendi correlated these two occasions in which a second interpretation of
a verse of Bahá’u’lláh by ‘Abdu’l- Bahá superseded the first interpretation in three letters
written on his behalf:

> As regards your question concerning the membership of the Universal House of Justice;
> there is a Tablet from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in which he definitely states that the membership of
> the Universal House of Justice is confined to men, and that the wisdom of it will be fully
> revealed and appreciated in the future. In the local, as well as the National Houses of
> Justice, however, women have the full right of membership. It is, therefore, only to the
> International House of Justice that they cannot be elected... 276
> As regards your question concerning the membership of the Universal House of Justice,
> there is a Tablet from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in which He definitely states that the membership of
> the Universal House is confined to men and that the wisdom of it will be fully revealed in
> the future. In the local, as well as the National Houses of Justice, however, women have
> the full right of membership. It is therefore, only to the International House that they
> cannot be elected. The Bahá’ís should accept this statement of the Master in a spirit of
> deep faith, confident that there is a divine guidance and wisdom behind it, which will be
> gradually unfolded to the eyes of the world. Regarding your question, the Master said the
> wisdom of having no women on the International House of Justice, would become
> manifest in the future. We have no other indication than this. At present there are
> women on the International Council, and this will continue as long as it exists, but when
> the International House of Justice is elected, there will only be men on it, as this is the law
> of the Aqdas.277

> The membership of the Universal House of Justice is confined to men. Fixing the
> number of the members, the procedures for election and the term of membership will be
> known later, as these are not explicitly revealed in the Holy Text.278
> As regards the membership of the International House of Justice, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states in a
> Tablet that it is confined to men, and that the wisdom of it will be revealed as manifest as
> the sun in the future. In any case the believers should know that, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself
> has explicitly stated that sexes are equal except in some cases, the exclusion of women
> from the International House of Justice, should not be surprising. From the fact that
> there is no equality of functions between the sexes one should not, however, infer that
> either sex is inherently superior or inferior to the other, or that they are unequal in their
> rights.279

While Shoghi Effendi cited a Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as the Scriptural basis for stating
that only men were eligible to serve on the Universal House of Justice, we can see that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote more than one opinion on the subject, and, barring the discovery of
more precise language or a reconciliation of the general and specific interpretations, it
seems that Shoghi Effendi chose which written source to privilege, and it was he who
confirmed that the binding interpretation of this provision of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas would
mandate the masculine gender of all members of Universal House of Women, at least
until the advent of the next Manifestation of God.
It is significant that Bahá’u’lláh does not promise his followers that they will be able to
discover infinite meanings in each of the symbolic verses revealed from his Pen. He prays
that they will be enabled to do so, and he invites all of humanity to discover these
meanings, but does not assure anyone that he or she will attain to these truths.
Attainment to these meanings is conditional upon fulfilling certain criteria, and, beyond
that, it is dependent upon the Will of God and His grace and mercy. His promise is that
he, and by extension, his "chosen ones" can explain the symbolism of the divine verses.
This, then, is the core principle of Bahá’í hermeneutics--to turn to the Manifestation of
God and his "chosen ones" for the interpretation of the symbolic verses.
As Bahá’u’lláh has indicated in the references cited above, the infallible and divinely-
guided Interpreter and Expounder of the Word of God is the Manifestation of God, he
who reveals the Word of God. After him, the "chosen ones" he appoints for the
explaining of his utterances and writings after "…the Mystic Dove will have winged its
flight from its Sanctuary of Praise and sought its far-off goal, its hidden habitation"280 will
assume this role. No individual believer and no institution can provide authoritative
interpretation. Bahá’í hermeneutics distinguishes between the authoritative and the
individual, the infallible and the fallible, that guided by the Holy Spirit and that which is
the fruit of human faculties, that which is protected by the Covenant and that which is
unprotected thereby. In all of these distinctions, the former pertains to authoritative
interpretation, whilst the latter pertains to individual or institutional interpretation.
The position of the Universal House of Justice is neither that of an authoritative
Interpreter of the Bahá’í source texts and their contents the Bahá’í teachings; nor that of
an individual believer or group of believers. Bahá’u’lláh writes of this Institution, setting
forth its powers and prerogatives:

> The men of God’s House of Justice have been charged with the affairs of the
> people…Inasmuch as for each day there is a new problem and for every problem an
> expedient solution, such affairs should be referred to the Ministers of the House of Justice
> that they may act according to the needs and requirements of the time. They that, for the
> sake of God, arise to serve His Cause, are the recipients of divine inspiration from the
> unseen Kingdom. It is incumbent upon all to be obedient unto them.281
> It is incumbent upon the Trustees of the House of Justice to take counsel together
> regarding those things which have not outwardly been revealed in the Book, and to
> enforce that which is agreeable to them. God will verily inspire them with whatsoever He
> willeth, and He, verily, is the Provider, the Omniscient.282
> It is incumbent upon the men of God’s House of Justice to fix their gaze by day and by
> night upon that which hath shone forth from the Pen of Glory for the training of peoples,
> the upbuilding of nations, the protection of man and the safeguarding of his honour.283
> Religion bestoweth upon man the most precious of all gifts, offereth the cup of prosperity,
> imparteth eternal life, and showereth imperishable benefits upon mankind. It behoveth
> the chiefs and rulers of the world, and in particular the Trustees of God’s House of
> Justice, to endeavour to the utmost of their power to safeguard its position, promote its
> interests and exalt its station in the eyes of the world. In like manner it is incumbent upon
> them to enquire into the conditions of their subjects and to acquaint themselves with the
> affairs and activities of the divers communities in their dominions. We call upon the
> manifestations of the power of God—the sovereigns and rulers on earth—to bestir
> themselves and do all in their power that haply they may banish discord from this world
> and illumine it with the light of concord.284

The members of the House of Justice are charged to "fix their gaze by day and by night
upon that which hath shone forth from the Pen of Glory for the training of peoples", "to
endeavour to the utmost of their power to safeguard its [religion's] position, promote its
interests and exalt its station in the eyes of the world the upbuilding of nations, the
protection of man and the safe-guarding of his honour" and "do all in their power that
haply they may banish discord from this world and illumine it with the light of concord".
This gives the House of Justice very broad powers. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá interprets these verses
literally, applying them specifically to the Universal House of Justice. In his Will and
Testament he writes:

> Unto the Most Holy Book every one must turn, and all that is not expressly recorded
> therein must be referred to the Universal House of Justice. That which this body, whether
> unanimously or by a majority doth carry, that is verily the truth and the purpose of God
> Himself. Whoso doth deviate therefrom is verily of them that love discord, hath shown
> forth malice, and turned away from the Lord of the Covenant. By this House is meant
> that Universal House of Justice which is to be elected from all countries, that is from those
> parts in the East and West where the loved ones are to be found, after the manner of the
> customary elections in Western countries such as those of England.
> It is incumbent upon these members (of the Universal House of Justice) to gather in a
> certain place and deliberate upon all problems which have caused difference,
> questions +that are obscure and matters that are not expressly recorded in
> the Book. Whatsoever they decide has the same effect as the Text itself. Inasmuch as the

> House of Justice hath power to enact laws that are not expressly recorded in the Book and
> bear upon daily transactions, so also it hath power to repeal the same.285

‘Abdu’l-Bahá indicates that the Universal House of Justice is to "deliberate upon all
problems which have caused difference, questions that are obscure and matters that are
not expressly recorded in the Book." Shoghi Effendi interpreted Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá's descriptions of the powers and prerogatives of the Universal House of Justice in a
literal fashion as well. Two of his re-articulations of these very broad powers are cited
below:

> Touching the point raised in the Secretary’s letter regarding the nature and scope of the
> Universal Court of Arbitration, this and other similar matters will have to be explained
> and elucidated by the Universal House of Justice, to which, according to the Master’s
> explicit instructions, all important and fundamental questions must be referred. At
> present the exact implication and full significance of the provisions of the Master’s Will
> are as yet imperfectly understood, and time will serve to reveal the wisdom and the far-
> reaching effects of His words.286
> From these statements it is made indubitably clear and evident that the Guardian of the
> Faith has been made the Interpreter of the Word and that the Universal House of Justice
> has been invested with the function of legislating on matters not expressly revealed in the
> teachings. The interpretation of the Guardian, functioning within his own sphere, is as
> authoritative and binding as the enactments of the International House of Justice, whose
> exclusive right and prerogative is to pronounce upon and deliver the final judgment on
> such laws and ordinances as Bahá’u’lláh has not expressly revealed. Neither can, nor will
> ever, infringe upon the sacred and prescribed domain of the other. Neither will seek to
> curtail the specific and undoubted authority with which both have been divinely
> invested.287
> Such is the immutability of His revealed Word. Such is the elasticity which characterizes
> the functions of His appointed ministers. The first preserves the identity of His Faith, and
> guards the integrity of His law. The second enables it, even as a living organism, to
> expand and adapt itself to the needs and requirements of an ever-changing society.288

In 1957, the Guardian died without appointing a successor, and it appeared that the
design of the New World Order set forth in the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
which called for a succession of Guardians, with Guardian serving as Head of the
Universal House of Justice, was not to be fulfilled. Once the Universal House of Justice
was elected, in April 1963, this Institution exercised its constitutional authority, derived
from the documents cited above, responding to Bahá’u’lláh's affirmation that "each day
there is a new problem and for every problem an expedient solution" and that "such
affairs should be referred to the Ministers of the House of Justice that they may act
according to the needs and requirements of the time"; to consult "regarding those things
which have not outwardly been revealed in the Book, and to enforce that which is
agreeable to them"; "to endeavour to the utmost of their power to safeguard" the Faith,
"its position, promote its interests and exalt its station in the eyes of the world"; and to
‘Abdu’l-Bahá's command that "all that is not expressly recorded therein must be referred
to the Universal House of Justice" and his assurance that whatever "this body, whether
unanimously or by a majority doth carry, that is verily the truth and the purpose of God

Himself", as well as his guidance that they will "deliberate upon all problems which have
caused difference, questions that are obscure and matters that are not expressly recorded
in the Book" and his promise that "whatsoever they decide has the same effect as the Text
itself"; and Shoghi Effendi's elucidation that the "exclusive right and prerogative" of the
Universal House of Justice "is to pronounce upon and deliver the final judgment on such
laws and ordinances as Bahá’u’lláh has not expressly revealed"--based on this mandate,
the Universal House of Justice described its own role in elucidating the Bahá’í teachings:

> There is a profound difference between the interpretations of the Guardian and the
> elucidations of the House of Justice in exercise of its function to “deliberate upon all
> problems which have caused difference, questions that are obscure, and matters that are
> not expressly recorded in the Book.” The Guardian reveals what the Scripture means; his
> interpretation is a statement of truth which cannot be varied. Upon the Universal House
> of Justice, in the words of the Guardian, “has been conferred the exclusive right of
> legislating on matters not expressly revealed in the Bahá’í Writings.” Its pronouncements,
> which are susceptible of amendment or abrogation by the House of Justice itself, serve to
> supplement and apply the Law of God. Although not invested with the function of
> interpretation, the House of Justice is in a position to do everything necessary to establish
> the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh on this earth. Unity of doctrine is maintained by the
> existence of the authentic texts of Scripture and the voluminous interpretations of
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi, together with the absolute prohibition against anyone
> propounding “authoritative” or “inspired” interpretations or usurping the function of
> Guardian. Unity of administration is assured by the authority of the Universal House of
> Justice.289
> The elucidations of the Universal House of Justice stem from its legislative function, while
> the interpretations of the Guardian represent the true intent inherent in the Sacred Texts.
> The major distinction between the two functions is that legislation with its resultant
> outcome of elucidation is susceptible of amendment by the House of Justice itself, whereas
> the Guardian's interpretation is a statement of truth which cannot be varied.290
> To ensure the preservation of the Sacred Texts and to safeguard their inviolability; to
> analyze, classify, and coordinate the Writings…To advance the interests of the Faith of
> God; to proclaim, propagate and teach its Message…to deliberate and decide upon all
> problems which have caused difference; to elucidate questions that are obscure…291

As is apparent from reading all of the above, it is entirely within the powers and
prerogatives of the Universal House of Justice to take whatever actions it deems necessary
to protect not only the Bahá’í source texts, but also to safeguard the purity and integrity
of the Bahá’í teachings by deciding "upon all problems which have cause difference" and
by elucidating "questions that are obscure". The elucidations of the Universal House of
Justice and, to a lesser extent, of the Institutions that operate under its aegis--the
International Teaching Centre and Bahá’í International Community, are "susceptible of
amendment by the House of Justice itself". While they are authoritative and normative,
they do not represent statements "of truth which cannot be varied". No individual
Bahá’í, and no other Bahá’í institution--no local, regional or national council, and no
member of the institution of the learned (Counselor, Auxiliary Board Member, or
assistant ABM)--is endowed with the authority and permission to elucidate the meaning
of the Bahá’í writings and teachings for the entire community and in a formal manner

representing the Bahá’í Faith as a whole. The publications of the Bahá’í International
Community and the International Bahá’í Council and Universal House of Justice are
regarded by Bahá’ís as secondary texts of their Faith and are generally based in a
systematic fashion upon the Bahá’í source texts. All individual interpretations are
considered in the next section.
Any attempt to divorce Bahá’í hermeneutics from the source texts is doomed from the
start. In the Bahá’í Revelation, the source texts include the authenticated Writings of the
Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, the authenticated Writings and utterances of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and the
authenticated writings by and on behalf of Shoghi Effendi. The interpretations of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and Shoghi Effendi cannot be separated from and disposed of their links with the
authenticated sources associated with the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh…and vice versa. We find
Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice
emphasizing this principle:

> Know assuredly that just as thou firmly believest that the Word of God, exalted be His
> glory, endureth for ever, thou must, likewise, believe with undoubting faith that its
> meaning can never be exhausted. They who are its appointed interpreters, they
> whose hearts are the repositories of its secrets, are, however, the only ones
> who can comprehend its manifold wisdom. Whoso, while reading the
> Sacred Scriptures, is tempted to choose therefrom whatever may suit him
> with which to challenge the authority of the Representative of God among
> men, is, indeed, as one dead, though to outward seeming we may walk and
> converse with his neighbors, and share with them their food and their
> drink.292
> Ye have guarded and defended the Cause of God; ye have not been a cause of
> dividing up His Word; ye have not brought His Faith low, but have striven to glorify
> His Holy Name; ye have not allowed the Blessed Cause to be exposed to the derision of
> the people. Ye have not permitted the Designated Station to be humbled, nor been
> willing to see the Centre of Authority discredited or exposed to mockery and persecution.
> Ye have striven to keep the Word whole and one.293
> Whatever the Master has said is based on the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. He was the perfect
> Interpreter, had lived with Him all His life; therefore what He says has the same standing,
> even if a text of Bahá’u’lláh is not available...We must take the teachings as a great,
> balanced whole, not seek out and oppose to each other two strong
> statements that have different meanings; somewhere in between, there are

> plain cause and effect!294
> These various statements must be taken in conjunction with all the Bahá'í

> We must not take many of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá's statements as dogmatic finalities,

For instance, when

The scope of authoritative interpretation, combined with that of authoritative elucidation
comprises a body of such rich detail and depth that the task of the individual reader is
both tremendously complicated and challenging on the one hand, and greatly facilitated
on the other. It is complicated and challenging because it calls for the synthesis and
correlation of hundreds, sometimes thousands of source texts, in a variety of languages
(Arabic, Persian and English); it is greatly facilitated because the individual is not left to
his own devices, which would be conducive to error, dissension, division and ultimately
the fragmentation of the Bahá’í community and loss of the purity and integrity of the
Bahá’í teachings.
We now turn to discussions of authoritative interpretation by Bahá’í scholars. Most of the
writers introduced at the beginning of this study have referred to this theme:
Dann May303 stated that "authoritative interpretations made by the central figures of the Bahá’í
Faith--the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi--comprise an important and integral part

of the Bahá’í canon. Their interpretations can be groups into two broad types: those which explain,
clarify, or provide an overall summary or distillation of the Bahá’í writings; and those which explain and
interpret past religious traditions and sacred writings. Bahá’í doctrine holds that both types of
interpretation are infallible and divinely inspired."
Michael Sours304 addresses the question of authoritative interpretation from the
perspective of how a text may be perceived by its author and those who are inspired by
his teachings on the one hand, and non-believers on the other hand: “From a historical and
literary point of view, it appears that Scripture, Biblical, Qur'ánic, and Bahá'í, contains a variety of
stories, myths and ideas derived from a number of sources that are of doubtful historical truth and
authenticity in the objective sense. From a theological point of view, however, it seems reasonable to argue
that the modern emphasis on the literary and historical analysis and interpretation of sacred Scripture has
not always given appropriate consideration to the true nature of Scripture and its real means of composition.
The stories Bahá'u'lláh refers to, such as Noah and the flood, while not real in the objective historical
sense, refer to what is real in the spiritual sense, and this spiritual reality is the most appropriate measure
of its truth. Bahá'u'lláh appears to anticipate the critics of our secular age with this warning: "Weigh not
the Book of God with the standards and sciences as are current amongst you . . . the measure of its weight
should be tested according to its own standard" (Synopsis 22). The divine inspiration of a story or any
written or oral tradition pertains to the spiritual meaning and purpose that is "breathed" into what, in
many instances, were originally fragments of collected information. Because the substance of such stories is
spiritual their "truth" and spiritual "authenticity" can only be evaluated and correctly ascertained by
spiritual criteria. This provides a type of definition of what real truth is in a religious context. And, in this
context it is separate and independent of objective historicity.”
Khazeh Fananapazir and Seena Fazel305 cite statements made by the Universal
House of Justice which point out that only ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi "can state
what the Book means"306. They affirm that "the interpretative writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the
Guardian do not have a temporary or transient nature"307. They also cite comments about the
authoritative interpretations of Shoghi Effendi by Ruhiyyih Khanum308 and Glenford E.
Mitchell309, with the former relating that Shoghi Effendi "considered he had said all he had to
say, in many ways, in the Dispensation"310, and the latter remarking that "Shoghi Effendi seems
completely to avoid gratuitous random interpretations of the Sacred Texts; the questions and needs of the
community outline the course and output of his exegesis."311
Jack McLean312 writes: "Based on these considerations, one can offer two heuristic definitions of
Bahá’í theology. The first points to revelation as the source of theology; the second points to theology as
commentary on revelation. The narrow refers to the Bahá’í revelation itself, what I call here source
theology or revelation theology, which is the substance of Bahá’í sacred scripture. Bahá’í source theology
refers to the authoritative, objective, and normative truths of the Bahá’í sacred writings or those elucidated
by its duly appointed interpreters. Authoritative means that the teaching is binding on believers; objective
means that the truths of source theology are commonly perceived and recognized as true by the community of
believers; normative means that the teaching is recognized by believers as the standard of truth."
Juan Cole313 writes: "Another, very different sort of interpretation [apart from "figurative
interpretation, formal exegesis and academic writing"] with regard to non-legal texts is authoritative
interpretation (tabyín). Bahá’u’lláh instituted this function in The Most Holy Book…", and he points
to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi as the "only two individuals" who "have held or will ever

hold this function in the Bahá’í community". However, Cole does not believe that the
authoritative interpretations stand on their own merits. In his opinion, "when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
and Shoghi Effendi both commented on an issue, they did not always give the same interpretation. Such
discrepancies point to the need for further scholarly study, and suggest the need for the development of a
hermeneutical approach even to authoritative interpretative comments. All in all, the corpus of official
interpretation helps Bahá’ís understand important aspects of the writings of Bahá’u’lláh, but leaves wide
scope for continuing investigation of the holy writ by individuals."
All of the papers examined on the question of Bahá’í hermeneutics either focus
exclusively upon individual non-authoritative interpretation, or refer to this core of Bahá’í
hermeneutics in passing or in part. The focus of these papers has been on articulating the
approaches that Bahá’í scholars are taking to hermeneutics, as well as distilling principles
from the Bahá’í source texts which might appropriately guide those individual
hermeneuts. We will address this question subsequently, but first we have sought to set
forth the foundations of authoritative interpretation, inasmuch as it is generally
recognized that all normative and authoritative Bahá’í hermeneutics is derived entirely
from the source texts of the Faith.
HERMENEUTICAL PRINCIPLES: INDIVIDUAL INTERPRETATION
The third meaning of "those firmly grounded in knowledge" in the verse "And none
knows its right interpretation except God and those who are firmly grounded in
knowledge" refers to true believers in the Manifestations and their "chosen ones".
Bahá’u’lláh depicts some of the distinguishing characteristics of those "whose hearts are
assured, whose souls have found favour with God, and whose minds are detached from all
else but Him":

> Wert thou to cleanse the mirror of thy heart from the dust of malice, thou
> wouldst apprehend the meaning of the symbolic terms revealed by the all-embracing
> Word of God made manifest in every Dispensation, and wouldst discover the mysteries of
> divine knowledge. Not, however, until thou consumest with the flame of utter
> detachment those veils of idle learning, that are current amongst men, canst
> thou behold the resplendent morn of true knowledge.314
> O my brother! A divine Mine only can yield the gems of divine knowledge, and the
> fragrance of the mystic Flower can be inhaled only in the ideal Garden, and the lilies of
> ancient wisdom can blossom nowhere except in the city of a stainless heart. "In a rich
> soil, its plants spring forth abundantly by permission of its Lord, and in that soil which is
> bad, they spring forth but scantily." [Qur’án 7:57] Inasmuch as it hath been clearly
> shown that only those who are initiated into the divine mysteries can
> comprehend the melodies uttered by the Bird of Heaven, it is therefore
> incumbent upon everyone to seek enlightenment from the illumined in heart and from
> the Treasuries of divine mysteries regarding the intricacies of God's Faith and the
> abstruse allusions in the utterances of the Daysprings of Holiness. Thus will these
> mysteries be unravelled, not by the aid of acquired learning, but solely
> through the assistance of God and the outpourings of His grace. "Ask ye,
> therefore, of them that have the custody of the Scriptures, if ye know it not." [Qur’án
> 16:43]315

> The understanding of His words and the comprehension of the utterances of
> the Birds of Heaven are in no wise dependent upon human learning. They depend
> solely upon purity of heart, chastity of soul, and freedom of spirit.316
> He knoweth the inner secrets of the hearts and the meaning hidden in a mocker’s wink.
> How many an embodiment of heedlessness who came unto Us with purity of
> heart have We established upon the seat of Our acceptance; and how many an
> exponent of wisdom have We in all justice consigned to the fire.317

How then does the believer who is "pure of heart" and "chaste of soul" arrive at the
understanding of the "abstruse" Word of God? He must turn to the Manifestation of
God and the chosen ones and the holy Book to find the truth:

> The people, therefore, must not allow such utterances to deprive them of the divine
> bounties, but should rather seek enlightenment from them who are the recognized
> Expounders thereof, so that the hidden mysteries may be unraveled, and be made
> manifest unto them. We perceive none, however, amongst the people of the earth who,
> sincerely yearning for the Truth, seeketh the guidance of the divine Manifestations
> concerning the abstruse matters of his Faith.318

> Know assuredly that just as thou firmly believest that the Word of God, exalted be His
> glory, endureth forever, thou must, likewise, believe with undoubting faith that its
> meaning can never be exhausted. They who are its appointed interpreters, they whose
> hearts are the repositories of its secrets, are, however, the only ones who can comprehend
> its manifold wisdom.319
> Should differences arise amongst you over any matter, refer it to God while the Sun still
> shineth above the horizon of this Heaven and, when it hath set, refer ye to whatsoever
> hath been sent down by Him. This, verily, is sufficient unto the peoples of the world.320
> O people of the world! When the Mystic Dove will have winged its flight from its
> Sanctuary of Praise and sought its far-off goal, its hidden habitation, refer ye whatsoever
he understand not in the Book to Him Who hath branched from this mighty Stock.321

> Let not the things they have perpetrated grieve thee. Truly they are even as dead, and
> not living. Leave them unto the dead, then turn thy face towards Him Who is the Life-
> Giver of the world.322

> Great is the blessedness of him who hath in this Day cast away the things current amongst
> men and hath clung unto that which is ordained by God, the Lord of Names and the
> Fashioner of all created things, He Who is come from the heaven of eternity through the
> power of the Most Great Name, invested with so invincible an authority that all the
powers of the earth are unable to withstand Him.323

> Abandon the things current amongst you and adopt that which the faithful Counselor
> biddeth you.324

> Cast away the things current amongst men and take fast hold on that whereunto ye are
bidden by virtue of the Will of the Ordainer, the Ancient of Days.325

> Your sciences shall not profit you in this day, nor your arts, nor your treasures, nor your
> glory. Cast them all behind your backs, and set your faces towards the Most Sublime

> Word through which the Scriptures and the Books and this lucid Tablet have been
> distinctly set forth.326

In every Dispensation, the believers have questioned whether they were expected to
understand the Word of God, inasmuch as it often seemed to them to be impenetrable or
uncertain in meaning. Bahá’u’lláh wrote, repeatedly and emphatically, that the Word of
God is meant to be understood:

> They have failed to realize, all this time, that, in every age, the reading of the scriptures
> and holy books is for no other purpose except to enable the reader to apprehend their
> meaning and unravel their innermost mysteries.                Otherwise reading, without
> understanding, is of no abiding profit unto man.327
> Heed not the idle contention of those who maintain that the Book and verses thereof can
> never be a testimony unto the common people, inasmuch as they neither grasp their
> meaning nor appreciate their value. And yet, the unfailing testimony of God to both the
> East and the West is none other than the Qur’án. Were it beyond the comprehension of
> men, how could it have been declared as a universal testimony unto all people? If their
> contention be true, none would therefore be required, nor would it be necessary for them
> to know God, inasmuch as the knowledge of the divine Being transcendeth the knowledge
> of His Book, and the common people would not possess the capacity to comprehend it.
> Such contention is utterly fallacious and inadmissable. It is actuated solely by arrogance
> and pride. Its motive is to lead the people astray from the Ridvan of divine good-pleasure
> and to tighten the reins of their authority over the people. And yet, in the sight of God,
> these common people are infinitely superior and exalted above their religious leaders who
> have turned away from the one true God.328
> In fact, all the Scriptures and the mysteries thereof are condensed into this brief account.
> So much so, that were a person to ponder it a while in his heart, he would discover from
> all that hath been said the mysteries of the Words of God, and would apprehend the
> meaning of whatever hath been manifested by that ideal King. As the people differ in
> their understanding and station, We will accordingly make mention of a few traditions,
> that these may impart constancy to the wavering soul, and tranquillity to the troubled
> mind. Thereby, will the testimony of God unto the people , both high and low, be
> complete and perfect.329
> If any of the utterances of this Servant may not be comprehended, or may lead to
> perturbation, the same must be inquired of again, that no doubt may linger, and the
> meaning be clear as the Face of the Beloved One [mahbúb] shining from the "Glorious
> Station."330
> Immerse yourselves in the ocean of My words, that ye may unravel its secrets, and
> discover all the pearls of wisdom that lie hid in its depths.331

What is the nature of this knowledge that the true believer receives from the
Manifestation of God, from his chosen ones, and from his Book? It is unlike human
knowledge, for it is not acquired but received as a gift. While anyone may memorize and
recite verses, understanding verses entails the receipt of the gift of understanding. And
this gift is not endowed to all human beings, to all souls, only to those whom God blesses
with His grace:

> This station conferreth the true standard of knowledge, and freeth man from tests. In this
> realm, to search after knowledge is irrelevant, for He hath said concerning the guidance
> of travelers on this plane, “Fear God, and God will instruct thee.” [Qur’án 2:282] And
> again: “Knowledge is a light which God casteth into the heart of whomsoever He
> willeth.”332
> Were the earth of their hearts to remain unchanged, how could such souls who have not
> been taught one letter, have seen no teacher, and entered no school, utter such words and
> display such knowledge as none can apprehend? Methinks they have been moulded from
> the clay of infinite knowledge, and kneaded from the water of divine wisdom. Therefore,
> hath it been said: “Knowledge is a light which God casteth into the heart of whomsoever
> He willeth.” It is this kind of knowledge which is and hath ever been praiseworthy, and
> not the limited knowledge that hath sprung forth from veiled and obscured minds. This
> limited knowledge they even stealthily borrow one from the other, and vainly pride
> themselves therein!333
> The spiritually learned are lamps of guidance among the nations, and stars of good
> fortune shining from the horizons of humankind. They are fountains of life for such as lie
> in the death of ignorance and unawareness, and clear springs of perfections for those who
> thirst and wander in the wasteland of their defects and errors. They are the dawning

The discovery of spiritual truth is not dependent upon research and study, for Bahá’u’lláh
explicitly denies that human learning is necessary to attain to the understanding of the
divine verses. However, it is not incompatible with research and study, for Bahá’u’lláh
points to the high station of those learned ones who recognize the new Manifestation and
who are filled with the divine knowledge of his Revelation. In Kitáb-i-Iqan we find a list
of prominent disciples of the Báb who were learned scholars and erudite professors. This
spiritual discovery is essentially receptive in its spiritual configuration. Just as the
Manifestation of God receives Revelation, so also the true believer receives spiritual
insight. We will now review the guidance given by Bahá’u’lláh to the true believer, that
he might attain to this divine knowledge:

> Both these sayings have but one meaning, were you to ponder upon the
> Manifestations of the Unity of God with divine insight.336

If they be in the likeness of the Sun of Truth, they will surely be accounted
as the most exalted of all luminaries; otherwise, they are to be recognized as the
focal centres of hellish fire.337
Were the eye of the heart to open, it would surely perceive that the words
revealed from the heaven of the will of God are at one with, and the same as, the deeds
that have emanated from the Kingdom of divine power.338
If the eye of justice be opened, it will readily recognize, in the light of that which
hath been mentioned, that He, Who is the Cause and ultimate Purpose of all these things,
is made manifest in this day.339
Know verily that Knowledge is of two kinds: Divine and Satanic. The one welleth out
from the fountain of divine inspiration; the other is but a reflection of vain and
obscure thoughts. The source of the former is God Himself; the motive-force of
the latter the whisperings of selfish desire.340
Our hope is that, God willing, the breeze of mercy may blow, and the divine Springtime
clothe the tree of being with the robe of new life; so that we may discover the
mysteries of divine Wisdom, and, through His providence, be made
independent of the knowledge of all things. We have, as yet, descried none
but a handful of souls, destitute of all renown, who have attained unto this
station. Let the future disclose what the Judgment of God will ordain, and the
Tabernacle of His decree reveal. In such wise We recount unto thee the wonders of the
Cause of God, and pour out into thine ears the strains of heavenly melody,
that haply thou mayest attain unto the station of true knowledge, and
partake of the fruit thereof.341
And how many of the ignorant who, by reason of their acceptance of the
Faith, have soared aloft and attained the high summit of knowledge, and
whose names have been inscribed by the Pen of Power upon the Tablet of divine
knowledge.342
Notwithstanding the obviousness of this theme, in the eyes of those that
have quaffed the wine of knowledge and certitude, yet how many are those who,
through failure to understand its meaning, have allowed the term "Seal of the Prophets"
to obscure their understanding, and deprive them of the grace of all His manifold
bounties!343
We have consumed this densest of all veils, with the fire of the love of the Beloved--the
veil referred to in the saying: "The most grievous of all veils is the veil of knowledge."
Upon its ashes, We have reared the tabernacle of divine knowledge. We have, praise be
to God, burned the "veils of glory" with the fire of the beauty of the Best-Beloved. We
have driven from the human heart all else but Him Who is the Desire of the
world, and glory therein. We cleave to no knowledge but His Knowledge,
and set our hearts on naught save the effulgent glories of His light.344
Upon detached souls they bestow the gift of Unity, enrich the destitute, and offer the
cup of knowledge unto them who wander in the wilderness of ignorance. All
the guidance, the blessings, the learning, the understanding, the faith, the

> certitude, conferred upon all that is in heaven and on earth, are hidden and
> treasured within these Cities.345

‘Abdu’l-Bahá confirms this guidance, and speaks of the true believer receiving a ray of the
light projected from the Sun of Reality, the Manifestation of God. The true believer is
receiving that light, and it is bestowed upon him by the grace of God, rather than being a
fruit of his exertions:

> For in the realm of conscience naught but the ray of God’s light can command, and on
> the throne of the heart none but the pervading power of the King of Kings should rule.
> Thus
> it is that one can arrest and suspend [the action of] every faculty except thought and
> reflection; for a man cannot even by his own volition withhold himself from reflection or
> thought, nor keep back his musings and imaginings.346
> But acquired infallibility is not a natural necessity; on the contrary, it is a ray of the
> bounty of infallibility which shines from the Sun of Reality upon hearts, and grants a
> share and portion of itself to souls.347
> But the human spirit, unless assisted by the spirit of faith, does not become acquainted
> with the divine secrets and the heavenly realities. It is like a mirror which, although clear,
> polished and brilliant, is still in need of light. Until a ray of the sun reflects upon it, it
> cannot discover the heavenly secrets.348
> This divine intellectual power is the special attribute of the Holy Manifestations and the
> Dawning-places of prophethood; a ray of this light falls upon the mirrors of the hearts of
> the
> righteous, and a portion and a share of this power comes to them through the Holy
> Manifestations.349
> The splendors of the perfections, bounties and attributes of God shine forth and radiate
> from the reality of the Perfect Man—that is to say, the Unique One, the supreme
> Manifestation of God. Other beings receive only one ray, but the supreme Manifestation
> is the mirror for this Sun, which appears and becomes manifest in it, with all its
> perfections, attributes, signs and wonders.350

The believer is promised that God may grant him the gift of spiritual understanding. But
how is the believer to discern the difference between spiritual understanding and vain
imaginings? ‘Abdu’l-Bahá reiterates the centrality of the revealed Book of God as the
standard whereby we may discriminate between truth and falsehood:

> As to the difference between inspiration and imagination: Inspiration is in conformity
> with the Divine Texts, but imaginations do not conform therewith. A real, spiritual
> connection between the True One and the servant is a lumious bounty which causeth an
> ecstatic (or divine) flame, passion and attraction. When this connection is secured (or
> realized) such an ecstasy and happiness become manifest in the heart that man doth fly
> away (with joy) and uttereth melody and song. Just as the soul bringeth the body in
> motion, so that spiritual bounty and real connection likewise moveth (or cheereth) the
> human soul.351

> I have been asked a question: “How can we know when our actions meet with the
> approval of God?” Sometimes passion incites us to action; the laws of nature attract us,
> we obey our senses; the other incentive is the comprehension of the direction of God. We
> must find out if our actions are divinely inspired and if they do not conform, then it is our
> sensations which speak. Let us ever weigh our deeds in the scales of the divine teaching.352

Inasmuch as the Book of God is the standard by which the believer's thinking and
behavior is to be regulated, it is imperative that he neither alter nor pervert the text of
that Book. This is in effect a principle guiding all interpretation, for if the text is changed
from its authentic character, whether mechanically through alteration of the actual words
and their sequencing or through the falsifying of the meaning intended by the author:

Take heed lest ye alter or pervert the text of the Word of God.353

Bahá’u’lláh gives examples of right and wrong interpretation of his Writings…in effect, he
teaches the reader how to interpret the Scriptures, including his own Words. Firstly, he
states that whoever uses Scripture to reject the Manifestation of God is
erroneous in his interpretation of the text:

> Whoso, while reading the Sacred Scriptures, is tempted to        choose        therefrom
> whatever may suit him with which to challenge the authority of the Representative of
> God among      men, is, indeed, as one dead, though to outward seeming           he may
> walk and converse with his neighbors, and share with them their food and their drink.354
> Take heed lest ye be prevented by aught that hath been recorded in the Book from
> hearkening unto this, the Living Book, Who proclaimeth the truth…355
> We, verily, see amongst you him who taketh hold of the Book of God and citeth from it
> proofs and arguments wherewith to repudiate his Lord, even as the followers of every
> other Faith sought reasons in their Holy Books for refuting Him Who is the Help in Peril,
> the Self-Subsisting.356

A second kind of wrong interpretation is when one would depend upon any
previous Scripture, in other words, anything but the verses revealed by Bahá’u’lláh, the
most recent and most complete Revealer of the Will of God:

> …in the dispensation of Him Whom God shall make manifest His own Book--the Book
> unto which all the Books of former Dispensations must needs be referred, the
> Book which standeth amongst them all transcendent and supreme.357
> Let none, in this Day, hold fast to aught save that which hath been manifested in this
> Revelation. Such is the decree of God, aforetime and hereafter--a decree wherewith the
> Scriptures of the Messengers of old have been adorned…To read but one of the verses
> of My Revelation is better than to peruse the Scriptures of both the former and latter
> generations.358
> Say: God, the True One, is My witness that neither the Scriptures of the world, nor all
> the books and writings in existence, shall, in this Day, avail you aught without this, the
> Living Book…359

Yet a third kind of wrong interpretation is one which alters the evident or outward
meaning of the Word of God. This does not mean that every one of the divine words is
meant to be understood literally, but that the altering of the literal meaning of the Word
which is mean to be understood literally is erroneous:

> Whoso interpreteth what hath been sent down from the heaven of Revelation, and
> altereth its evident meaning, he, verily, is of them that have perverted the Sublime Word
> of God, and is of the lost ones in the Lucid Book.360
> The purpose of interpretation is this: that none become deprived of that which is evident,
> and be veiled from that which is intended. If, for example, from the heaven of the Will of
> God it were revealed: “wash ye your faces”, do not interpret this to mean, by washing,
> [that] the intent is the cleansing of the inner face that should be washed and purified by
> the water of divine knowledge, and the like! Many a time, with [because of] such
> interpretations, a person’s face may remain utterly filthy and pungent, whilst, in his own
> idle fancy, he hath performed the essence of God’s command! Yet, in this instance, it is
> clear and evident that the washing of the face with material water is intended.361

Bahá’u’lláh refers to another kind of "perversion" of the Word of God, in this case the
literal interpretation of figurative verses. In one case he cites the statement in the
Qur’án, "They pervert the text of the Word of God."362 He explains:

> Verily by “perverting” the text is not meant that which these foolish and abject souls have
> fancied, even as some maintain that Jewish and Christian divines have effaced from the
> Book such verses as extol and magnify the countenance of Muhammad, and instead
> thereof have inserted the contrary. How utterly vain and false are these words! Can a
> man who believeth in a book, and deemeth it to be inspired by God, mutilate it?
> Moreover, the Pentateuch had been spread over the surface of the earth, and was not
> confined to Mecca and Medina, so that they could privily corrupt and pervert its text.
> Nay, rather, by corruption of the text is meant that in which all Muslim divines are
> engaged today, that is the interpretation of God’s holy Book in accordance with their idle
> imaginings and vain desires. And as the Jews, in the time of Muhammad, interpreted
> those verses of the Pentateuch, that
> referred to His Manifestation, after their own fancy, and refused to be satisfied with His
> holy utterance, the charge of “perverting” the text was therefore pronounced against
> them. Likewise, it is clear, how in this day, the people of the Qur’án have perverted the
> text of God’s holy Book, concerning the signs of the expected Manifestation, and
> interpreted it according to their inclination and desires. In yet another instance, He saith:
> “A part of them heard the Word of God, and then, after they had understood it, distorted
> it, and knew that they did so.”363 This verse, too, doth indicate that the meaning of the
> Word of God hath been perverted, not that the actual words have been effaced. To the
> truth of this testify they that are sound of mind. Again in another instance, He saith:
> “Woe unto those who, with their own hands, transcribe the Book corruptly, and then say:
> ‘This is from God,’ that they may sell it for some mean price.”364 This verse was revealed
> with reference to the divines and leaders of the Jewish Faith. These divines, in order to
> please the rich, acquire worldly emoluments, and give vent to their envy and misbelief,
> wrote a number of treatises, refuting the claims of Muhammad, supporting their
> arguments with such evidences as it would be improper to mention, and claimed that
> these arguments were derived from the text of the Pentateuch. The same may be
> witnessed today. Consider how abundant are the denunciations written by the foolish

> divines of this age against this most wondrous Cause! How vain their imaginings that
> these calumnies are in conformity with the verses of God’s sacred Book, and in
> consonance with the utterances of men of discernment!365

A broad category of erroneous interpretation, which includes all of the above and others
besides, is that which is guided not by divine inspiration but by selfish desires
and vain imaginings. While the believer is enjoined to be detached from his selfish
desires and to rid his heart of vain imaginings, he may not have been successful in
effecting a perfect self-purification, and hence he is vulnerable to the error which arises
from ego:

> But having weighed the testimony of God by the standard of their own knowledge,
> gleaned from the teachings of the leaders of their faith, and found it at variance with their
> limited understanding, they arose to perpetrate such unseemly acts.366
> The denials and protestations of these leaders of religion have, in the main, been due to
> their lack of knowledge and understanding. Those words uttered by the Revealers of the
> beauty of the one true God, setting forth the signs that should herald the advent of the
> Manifestation to come, they never understood nor fathomed.367
> And yet, they have sought the interpretation of the Book from those that are wrapt in
> veils, and have refused to seek enlightenment from the fountainhead of knowledge.368
> From time immemorial even unto this day, all the kindreds and peoples of the earth have
> clung to such fanciful and unseemly thoughts, and thus have deprived themselves of the
> clear waters streaming from the springs of purity and holiness.369
> …when the reins of mankind will have fallen into the grasp of the foolish and ignorant,
> when the portals of divine unity and understanding--the essential and highest purpose in
> creation--will have been closed, when certain knowledge will have given way to idle
> fancy, and corruption will have usurped the station of righteousness. Such a condition as
> this is witnessed in this day when the reins of every community have fallen into the grasp
> of foolish leaders, who lead after their own whims and desire. On their tongue the
> mention of God hath become an empty name; in their midst His holy Word a dead letter.
> Such is the sway of their desires, that the lamp of conscience and reason hath been
> quenched in their hearts…370
> Their hearts seem not to be inclined to knowledge and the door thereof, neither think
> they of its manifestations, inasmuch as in idle fancy they have found the door that leadeth
> unto earthly riches, whereas in the manifestation of the Revealer of knowledge they find
> naught but the call to self-sacrifice. They therefore naturally hold fast unto the former,
> and flee from the latter.371
> That these divine Luminaries seem to be confined at times to specific designations and
> attributes, as you have observed and are now observing, is due solely to the imperfect and
> limited comprehension of certain minds. Otherwise, they have been at all times, and will
> through eternity continue to be, exalted above every praising name, and sanctified from
> every descriptive attribute. The quintessence of every name can hope for no access unto
> their court of holiness, and the highest and purest of all attributes can never approach
> their kingdom of glory. Immeasurably high are the Prophets of God exalted above the
> comprehension of men, who can never know them except by their own Selves. Far be it

from His glory that His chosen Ones should be magnified by any other than their own
persons. Glorified are they above the praise of men; exalted are they above human
understanding!372
Thereupon We realized that that poor man had not been favoured with a single drop of
the ocean of true understanding, and had strayed far from the burning Bush of divine
wisdom.373
And as the commentators of the Qur’án have failed to grasp the symbolic meaning of
these "Suns," they therefore were at pains to interpret the above-quoted verse. Some of
them maintained that owing to the fact that the sun each day rises from a different point,
the terms "easts" and "wests" have been mentioned in the plural. Others have written
that by this verse the four seasons of the year are intended, inasmuch as the dawning and
setting points of the sun vary with the change of the seasons. Such is the depth of their
understanding! None the less, they persist in imputing error and folly to those Gems of
knowledge, those irreproachable and purest Symbols of wisdom.374
The tree of such teachings can yield no result except iniquity and rebellion, and beareth
no fruit but hatred and envy. Its fruit is deadly poison; its shadow a consuming fire.375
As most of the divines have failed to apprehend the meaning of these verses, and have not
grasped the significance of the Day of Resurrection, they therefore have foolishly
interpreted these verses according to their idle and faulty conception.376
Such ills befell them only because they have clung to the ways of the divines of the age in
which they lived, and blindly imitated them in accepting or denying these Essences of
Detachment, these holy and divine Beings. These leaders, owing to their immersion in
selfish desires, and their pursuit of transitory and sordid things, have regarded these
divine Luminaries as being opposed to the standards of their knowledge and
understanding, and the opponents of their ways and judgments. As they have literally
interpreted the Word of God, and the sayings and traditions of the Letters of Unity, and
expounded them according to their own deficient understanding, they have therefore
deprived themselves and all their people of the bountiful showers of the grace and mercies
of God.377
Nay, rather, by corruption of the text is meant that in which all Muslim divines are
engaged today, that is the interpretation of God's holy Book in accordance with their idle
imaginings and vain desires. And as the Jews, in the time of Muhammad, interpreted
those verses of the Pentateuch, that referred to His Manifestation, after their own fancy,
and refused to be satisfied with His holy utterance, the charge of 'perverting' the text was
therefore pronounced against them. Likewise, it is clear, how in this day, the people of
the Qur’án have perverted the text of God's holy Book, concerning the signs of the
expected Manifestation, and interpreted it according to their own inclination and
desire.378
In yet another instance, He saith: 'A part of them heard the Word of God, and then, after
they had understood it, distorted it, and knew that they did so.' [Qur’án 2:75] This verse,
Too, doth indicate that the meaning of the Word of God hath been perverted, not that
the actual words have been effaced. To the truth of this testify they that are sound of
mind. In yet another instance, He saith: "A part of them heard the Word of God, and
then, after they had understood it, distorted it, and knew that they did so." [Qur’án 2:75]
This verse, too, doth indicate that the meaning of the Word of God hath been perverted,

not the actual words have been effaced. To the truth of this testify they that are sound of
mind. Again in another instance, He saith: "Woe unto those who, with their own hands,
transcribe the Book corruptly, and then say: 'This is from God,' that they may sell it for
some mean price." [Qur’án 2:79] This verse was revealed with reference to the divines
and leaders of the Jewish Faith. These divines, in order to please the rich, acquire
worldly emoluments, and give vent to their envy and misbelief, wrote a number of
treatises, refuting the claims of Muhammad, supporting their arguments with such
evidences as it would be improper to mention, and claimed that these arguments are
derived from the text of the Pentateuch. The same may be witnessed today. Consider
how abundant are the denunciations written by the foolish divines of this age against this
most wondrous Cause! How vain their imaginings that these calumnies are in conformity
with the verses of God's sacred Book, and in consonance with the utterances of men of
discernment!379
Yea, inasmuch as the peoples of the world have failed to seek from the luminous and
crystal Springs of divine knowledge the inner meaning of God's holy words, they
therefore have languished, stricken and sore athirst, in the vale of idle fancy and
waywardness. They have strayed far from the fresh and thirst-subduing waters, and
gathered round the salt that burneth bitterly. Concerning them, the Dove of Eternity
hath spoken: "And if they see the path of righteousness, they will not take it for their path;
but if they see the path of error, for their path will they take it. This, because they treated
Our signs as lies, and were heedless of them." [Qur’án 7:145]380
How well hath He spoken concerning them: "Hearts have they, with which they
understand not, and eyes have they with which they see not!" [Qur’án 7:178]381
As the commentators of the Qur’án and they that follow the letter thereof
misapprehended the inner meaning of the words of God and failed to grasp their essential
purpose, they sought to demonstrate that, according to the rules of grammar, whenever
the term "idha" (meaning "if" or "when") precedeth the past tense, it invariably hath
reference to the future. Later, they were sore perplexed in attempting to explain those
verses of the Book wherein that term did not actually occur….How vain their sophistry!
How grievous their blindness! They refuse to recognize the trumpet-blast which so
explicitly in this text was sounded through the revelation of Muhammad.382

Even as it hath been previously recorded: "Hearts have they with which they understand
not." [Qur’án 7:178]383
…all the people, whether high or low, have clung to the ways of those abject
manifestations of the Prince of Darkness. They continually appeal to them for aid in
unraveling the intricacies of their Faith, and, owing to lack of knowledge, they make such
replies as can in no wise damage their fame and fortune. It is evident that these souls, vile
and miserable as the beetle itself, have no portion of the musk-laden breeze of eternity,
and have never entered the Ridvan of heavenly delight. How, therefore, can they impart
unto others the imperishable fragrance of holiness? Such is their way, and such will it
remain forever.384
Furthermore, it is already evident and known unto thee that those things to which the
Jews and the Christians have clung, and the cavilings which they heaped upon the Beauty
of Muhammad, the same have in this day been upheld by the people of the Qur’án, and

been witnessed in their denunciations of the "Point of the Bayan" --may the souls of all
that dwell within the kingdom of divine Revelation be a sacrifice unto Him! Behold their
folly: they utter the self-same words, uttered by the Jews of old, and know it not! How
well and true are His words concerning them: "Leave them to entertain themselves with
their cavilings!" [Qur’án 6:91] "As Thou livest, O Muhammad! They are seized by the
frenzy of their vain fancies." [Qur’án 15:72]385
Consider, how can he that faileth in the day of God's Revelation to attain unto the grace
of the "Divine Presence" and to recognize His Manifestation, be justly called learned,
though he may have spent aeons in the pursuit of knowledge, and acquired all the limited
and material learning of men? It is surely evident that he can in no wise be regarded as
possessed of true knowledge. Whereas, the most unlettered of all men, if he be honoured
with this supreme distinction, he verily is accounted as one of those divinely-learned men
whose knowledge is of God; for such a man hath attained the acme of knowledge, and
hath reached the furthermost summit of learning.386
As the wayward of every age have failed to fathom the deeper import of these weighty
and pregnant utterances, and imagine the answer of the Prophets of God to be irrelevant
to the questions they asked them, they therefore have attributed ignorance and folly to
those Essences of knowledge and understanding.387
Among these "veils of glory" are the divines and doctors living in the days of the
Manifestations of God, who, because of their want of discernment and their love and
eagerness for leadership, have failed to submit to the Cause of God, nay, have even
refused to incline their ears unto the divine Melody. "They have thrust their fingers into
their ears." [Qur’án 2:19] And the people who, utterly ignoring God and taking them for
their masters, have placed themselves unreservedly under the authority of these pompous
and hypocritical leaders, for they have no sight, no hearing, no heart, of their own to
distinguish truth from falsehood. Notwithstanding the divinely-inspired admonitions of
all the Prophets, the Saints, and Chosen ones of God, enjoining the people to see with
their own eyes and hear with their own ears, they have disdainfully rejected their counsels
and have blindly followed, and will continue to follow, the leaders of their Faith. Should
a poor and obscure person, destitute of the attire of the men of learning, address them
saying: "Follow ye, O people! the Messengers of God," [Qur’án 36:20] they would,
greatly surprised at such a statement, reply: "What! meanest thou that all these divines, all
these exponents of learning, with all their authority, their pomp and pageantry, have
erred, and failed to distinguish truth from falsehood? Dost thou, and people like thyself,
pretend to have comprehended that which they have not understood?" If numbers and
excellence of apparel be regarded as the criterions of learning and truth, the peoples of a
bygone age, whom those of today have never surpassed in numbers, magnificence and
power, should certainly be accounted a superior and worthier people. It is clear and
evident that whenever the Manifestations of Holiness were revealed, the divines of their
day have hindered the people from attaining unto the way of truth. To this testify the
records of all the scriptures and heavenly books. Not one Prophet of God was made
manifest Who did not fall a victim to the relentless hate, to the denunciation, denial, and
execration of the clerics of His day! Woe unto them for the iniquities their hands have
formerly wrought! Woe unto them for that which they are now doing! What veils of
glory more grievous than these embodiments of error! By the righteousness of God! to
pierce such veils is the mightiest of all acts, and to rend them asunder the most
meritorious of all deeds! May God assist us and assist you, O concourse of the Spirit! that
perchance ye may in the time of His Manifestation [Him Whom God shall make

manifest] be graciously aided to perform such deeds, and may in His days attain unto the
Presence of God.388
Immeasurably exalted is the celestial Melody above the strivings of human ear to hear or
mind to grasp its mystery! How can the helpless ant step into the court of the All-
Glorious? And yet, feeble souls, through lack of understanding, reject these abstruse
utterances, and question the truth of such traditions. Nay, none can comprehend them
save those that are possessed of an understanding heart.389

These people with one hand cling to those verses of the Qur’án and those traditions of
the people of certitude which they have found to accord with their inclinations and
interests, and with the other reject those which are contrary to their selfish desires.
'Believe ye then part of the Book, and deny part?' [Qur’án 2:85] How could ye judge
that which ye understand not? Even as the Lord of being hath in His unerring Book,
after speaking of the 'Seal' in His exalted utterance: 'Muhammad is the Apostle of God
and the Seal of the Prophets,' [Qur’án 33:40] hath revealed unto all people the promise of
'attainment unto the divine Presence.' [Qur’án 33:47: min allah faDlan kabíran]390
So great is the folly and perversity of the people, that they have turned their face toward
their own thoughts and desires, and have turned their back upon the knowledge and will
of God--hallowed and glorified be His name!"391
For it behooveth no man to interpret the holy words according to his own imperfect
understanding, nor, having found them to be contrary to his inclination and desires, to
reject and repudiate their truth. For such, today, is the manner of the divines and doctors
of the age, who occupy the seats of knowledge and learning, and who have named
ignorance knowledge, and called oppression justice. Were these to ask the Light of Truth
concerning those images which their idle fancy hath carved, and were they to find His
answer inconsistent with their own conceptions and their own understanding of the Book,
they would assuredly denounce Him Who is the Mine and Wellhead of all Knowledge as
the very negation of understanding. Such things have happened in every age.392
And now behold the divines of the age who, because of their being honoured by His
name, and finding that their fathers have acknowledged His Revelation, have blindly
submitted to His truth. Observe, were this people today to receive such answers in reply
to such questionings, they would unhesitatingly reject and denounce them--nay, they
would again utter the self-same cavils, even as they have uttered them in this day. All
this, notwithstanding the fact that these Essences of being are immensely exalted above
such fanciful images, and are immeasurably glorified beyond all these vain sayings and
above the comprehension of every understanding heart. Their so-called learning, when
compared with that Knowledge, is utter falsehood, and all their understanding naught
but blatant error. Nay, whatsoever proceedeth from these Mines of divine Wisdom and
these Treasuries of eternal knowledge is truth, and naught else but the truth. The saying:
'Knowledge is one point, which the foolish have multiplied' is a proof of Our argument,
and the tradition: 'Knowledge is a light which God sheddeth into the heart of
whomsoever He willeth' a confirmation of Our statement. Inasmuch as they have not
apprehended the meaning of Knowledge, and have called by that name those images
fashioned by their own fancy and which have sprung from the embodiments of
ignorance, they therefore have inflicted upon the Source of Knowledge that which thou
hast heard and witnessed.393

For instance, a certain man, reputed for his learning and attainments, and accounting
himself as one of the pre-eminent leaders of his people, hath in his book denounced and
vilified all the exponents of true learning. This is made abundantly clear by his explicit
statements as well as by his allusions throughout his book.394
From this title [Irshadu'l-'Avam, Guidance unto the Ignorant] We perceived the odour of
conceit and vainglory, inasmuch as he hath imagined himself a learned man and
regarded the rest of the people ignorant. His worth was in fact made known by the very
title he had chosen for his book. It became evident that its author was following the path
of self and desire, and was lost in the wilderness of ignorance and folly.395
We noticed that he had enumerated some twenty or more sciences, the knowledge of
which he considered to be essential for the comprehension of the mystery of the "Mi'raj".
We gathered from his statements that unless a man be deeply versed in them all, he can
never attain to a proper understanding of this transcendent and exalted theme. Among
the specified sciences were the science of metaphysical abstractions, of alchemy, and
natural magic. Such vain and discarded learnings, this man hath regarded as the pre-
requisites of the understanding of the sacred and abiding mysteries of divine Knowledge.
Gracious God! Such is the measure of his understanding. And yet, behold what cavils
and calumnies he hath heaped upon those Embodiments of God's infinite knowledge!
How well and true is the saying: "Flingest thou thy calumnies unto the face of Them
Whom the one true God hath made the Trustees of the treasures of His seventh sphere?"
Not one understanding heart or mind, not one among the wise and learned, hath taken
notice of these preposterous statements. And yet, how clear and evident it is to every
discerning heart that this so-called learning is and hath ever been, rejected by Him Who
is the one true God. How can the knowledge of these sciences, which are so contemptible
in the eyes of the truly learned, be regarded as essential to the apprehension of the
mysteries of the "Mi'raj," whilst the Lord of the "Mi'raj" Himself was never burdened
with a single letter of these limited and obscure learnings, and never defiled His radiant
heart with any of these fanciful illusions? How truly hath he said: "All human attainment
moveth upon a lame ass, whilst Truth, riding upon the wind, darteth across space."396
In this day, they that are submerged beneath the ocean of divine Knowledge, and dwell
within the ark of divine wisdom, forbid the people such idle pursuits. Their shining
breasts are, praise be to God, sanctified from every trace of such learning, and are exalted
above such grievous veils. We have consumed this densest of all veils, with the fire of the
love of the Beloved--the veil referred to in the saying: "The most grievous of all veils is the
veil of knowledge." Upon its ashes, We have reared the tabernacle of divine
knowledge.397
We were surprized exceedingly when We observed that his one purpose was to make the
people realize that all these learnings were possessed by him. And yet, I swear by God
that not one breath, blowing from the meads of divine knowledge, hath ever been wafted
upon his soul, nor hath he ever unravelled a single mystery of ancient wisdom. Nay, were
the meaning of Knowledge ever to be expounded unto him, dismay would fill his heart,
and his whole being would shake to its foundation. Notwithstanding his base and
senseless statements, behold to what heights of extravagance his claims have reached!398
Even as the people of Israel, in the time of Moses, bartered away the bread of heaven for
the sordid things of the earth, these people, likewise, sought to exchange the divinely-
revealed verses for their foul, their vile, and idle desires. In like manner, thou beholdest
in this day that although spiritual sustenance hath descended from the heaven of divine

mercy, and been showered from the clouds of His loving kindness, and although the seas
of life, at the behest of the Lord of all being, are surging within the Ridvan of the heart,
yet these people, ravenous as the dogs, have gathered around carrion, and contented
themselves with the stagnant waters of a briny lake. Gracious God! how strange the way
of this people! They clamour for guidance, although the standards of Him Who guideth
all things are already hoisted. They cleave to the obscure intricacies of knowledge, when
He, Who is the Object of all knowledge, shineth as the sun. They see the sun with their
own eyes, and yet question that brilliant Orb as to the proof of its light. They behold the
vernal showers descending upon them, and yet seek an evidence of that bounty. The
proof of the sun is the light thereof, which shineth and envelopeth all things. The
evidence of the shower is the bounty thereof, which reneweth and investeth the world
with the mantle of life. Yea, the blind can perceive naught from the sun except its heat,
and the arid soil hath no share of the showers of mercy. "Marvel not if in the Qur’án the
unbeliever perceiveth naught but the trace of letters, for in the sun, the blind findeth
naught but heat."399
Therefore, understand from this verse and know of a certainty that the people in every
age, clinging to a verse of the Book, have uttered such vain and absurd sayings,
contending that no Prophet should again be made manifest to the world. Even as the
Christian divines who, holding fast to the verse of the Gospel to which We have already
referred [Matthew 24:35],
have sought to explain that the law of the Gospel shall at no time be annulled, and that
no independent Prophet shall again be made manifest, unless He confirmeth the law of
the Gospel. Most of the people have become afflicted with the same spiritual disease.400
Even as thou dost witness how the people of the Qur’án, like unto the people of old, have
allowed the words "Seal of the Prophets" to veil their eyes. And yet, they themselves
testify to this verse: "None knoweth the interpretation thereof but God and they that are
well-grounded in knowledge." [Qur’án 3:7] And when He Who is well-grounded in all
knowledge, Who is the Mother, the Soul, the Secret, and the Essence thereof, revealeth
that which is the least contrary to their desire, they bitterly oppose Him and shamelessly
deny Him. These thou hast already heard and witnessed. Such deeds and words have
been sorely instigated by leaders of religion, they that worship no God but their own
desire, who bear allegiance to naught but gold, who are wrapt in the densest veils of
learning, and who, enmeshed by its obscurities, are lost in the wilds of error. Even as the
Lord of being hath explicitly declared: "What thinkest thou? He who hath made a God
of his passions, and whom God causeth to err through a knowledge, and whose ears and
whose heart He hath sealed up, and over whose sight He hath cast a veil--who, after his
rejection by God, shall guide such a one? Will ye not then be warned?" [Qur’án
45:22]401
Although the outward meaning of "Whom God causeth to err through a knowledge" is
what hath been revealed, yet to Us it signifieth those divines of the age who have turned
away from the Beauty of God, and who, clinging unto their own learning, as fashioned by
their own fancies and desires, have denounced God's divine Message and Revelation.
"Say: it is a weighty Message, from which ye turn aside!" [Qur’án 38:67] Likewise, He
saith: "And when Our clear verses are recited to them, they say, 'This is merely a man
who would fain pervert you from your father's worship.' And they say, 'This is none other
than a forged falsehood.'" [Qur’án 34:43]402

Be fair: Is the testimony of those acceptable and worthy of attention whose deeds agree
with their words, whose outward behaviour conforms with their inner life? The mind is
bewildered at their deeds, and the soul marvelleth at their fortitude and bodily
endurance. Or is the testimony of these faithless souls who breathe naught but the breath
of selfish desire, and who lie imprisoned in the cage of their idle fancies, acceptable? Like
the bats of darkness, they lift not their heads from their couch except to pursue the
transient things of the world, and find no rest by night except as they labour to advance
the aims of their sordid life. Immersed in their selfish schemes, they are oblivious of the
divine Decree. In the day-time they strive with all their soul after worldly benefits, and in
the night-season their sole occupation is to gratify their carnal desires. By what law or
standard could men be justified in cleaving to the denials of such petty-minded souls, and
in ignoring the faith of them that have renounced, for the sake of the good-pleasure of
God, their life, and substance, their fame and renown, their reputation and honour?403
A Revelation, of which the Prophets of God, His saints and chosen ones, have either not
been informed, or which, in pursuance of God's inscrutable Decree, they have not
disclosed,--such a Revelation these mean and depraved people have sought to measure
with their own deficient minds, their own deficient learning and understanding. Should it
fail to conform to their standards, they straightway reject it. "Thinkest thou that the
greater part of them hear or understand? They are even like unto the brutes! Yea, they
stray even further from the path!" [Qur’án 25:44]404
We beg them not to depend upon their intellect, their comprehension and learning, nor
to contend with the Revelator of celestial and infinite knowledge.405
Secrets are many, but strangers are myriad. Volumes will not suffice to hold the mystery
of the Beloved One, nor can it be exhausted in these pages, although it be no more than a
sign. 'Knowledge is a single point [al-'ilm nuqtih], but the ignorant have multiplied it.'406
This station conferreth the true standard of knowledge, and freeth man from tests. In
this realm, to search after knowledge is irrelevant, for He hath said concerning the
guidance of travelers on this plane, 'Fear God, and God will instruct thee.' [Qur’án 2:282]
And again: 'Knowledge is a light which God casteth into the heart of whomsoever He
willeth.'407
Whoso, while reading the Sacred Scriptures, is tempted to choose therefrom whatever
may suit him with which to challenge the authority of the Representative of God among
men, is, indeed, as one dead, though to outward seeming he may walk and converse with
his neighbors, and share with them their food and their drink.408
We beseech God to strengthen thee with His power, and enable thee to recognize Him
Who is the Source of all knowledge, that thou mayest detach thyself from all human
learning, for, 'what would it profit any man to strive after learning when he hath already
found and recognized Him Who is the Object of all knowledge?' Cleave to the Root of
Knowledge, and to Him Who is the Fountain thereof, that thou mayest find thyself
independent of all who claim to be well versed in human learning, and whose claim no
clear proof, nor the testimony of any enlightening book, can support.409
Whoso interpreteth this verse otherwise than its obvious meaning is deprived of the Spirit
of God and of His mercy which encompasseth all created things. Fear God, and follow
not your idle fancies. Nay, rather, follow the bidding of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-
Wise. Erelong shall clamorous voices be raised in most lands. Shun them, O My people,

and follow not the iniquitous and evil-hearted. This is that of which We gave you
forewarning when We were dwelling in 'Iraq, then later while in the Land of Mystery,
and now from this Resplendent Spot.410
Whoso interpreteth what hath been sent down from the heaven of Revelation, and
altereth its evident meaning, he, verily, is of them that have perverted the Sublime Word
of God, and is of the lost ones in the Lucid Book.411
O concourse of divines! When My verses were sent down, and My clear tokens were
revealed, We found you behind the veils…Beware lest ye shut out the people by yet
another veil. Pluck asunder the chains of vain imaginings, in the name of the Lord of all
men, and be not of the deceitful. Should ye turn unto God and embrace His Cause,
spread not disorder within it, and measure not the Book of God with your selfish desires.
This, verily, is the counsel of God aforetime and hereafter, and to this God's witnesses
and chosen ones, yea, each and every one of Us, do solemnly attest.412
We, verily, see amongst you him who taketh hold of the Book of God and citeth from it
proofs and arguments wherewith to repudiate his Lord, even as the followers of every
other Faith sought reasons in their Holy Books for refuting Him Who is the Help in Peril,
the Self-Subsisting. Say: God, the True One, is My witness that neither the Scriptures of
the world, nor all the books and writings in existence, shall, in this Day, avail you aught
without this, the Living Book, Who proclaimeth in the midmost heart of creation: "Verily,
there is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."413
Take heed that ye dispute not idly concerning the Almighty and His Cause, for lo! He
hath appeared amongst you invested with a Revelation so great as to encompass all
things, whether of the past or of the future.414
It behoveth thee to look with divine insight upon the things We have revealed and sent
unto thee and not towards the people and that which is current amongst them. They are
in this day like unto a blind man who, while moving in the sunshine, demandeth: Where
is the sun? Is is shining? He would deny and dispute the truth, and would not be of them
that perceive. Never shall he be able to discern the sun or to understand that which hath
intervened between him and it. He would object within himself, voice protests, and
would be among the rebellious. Such is the state of this people. Leave them unto
themselves, saying: Unto you be that which ye desire and unto us that which we desire.
Wretched indeed is the plight of the ungodly.415
O concourse of divines! This is the day whereon nothing amongst all things, nor any
name amongst all names, can profit you save through this Name which God hath made
the Manifestation of His Cause and the Dayspring of His Most Excellent Titles unto all
who are in the kingdom of creation. Blessed is that man that hath recognized the
fragrance of the All-Merciful and been numbered with the steadfast. Your sciences shall
not profit you in this day, nor your arts, nor your treasures, nor your glory. Cast them all
behind your backs, and set your faces towards the Most Sublime Word through which the
Scriptures and the Books and this lucid Tablet have been distinctly set forth. Cast away,
O concourse of divines, the things ye have composed with the pens of your idle fancies
and vain imaginings. By God! The Day-Star of Knowledge hath shone forth above the
horizon of certitude.416

> How strange! These people with one hand cling to those            verses of the Qur’án
> and those traditions of the people of certitude which they have found to accord with their
> own inclinations and interests, and with the other reject those which are contrary to their
> selfish desires. 'Believe ye then part of the Book, and deny part?'417 How could ye judge
> that which ye understand not? Even as the Lord of being hath in His unerring Book,
> after speaking of the "Seal" in His exalted utterance: "Muhammad is the Apostle of God
> and the Seal of the Prophets,"418 hath revealed unto all people the promise of "attainment
> unto the divine Presence."419 To this attainment to the presence of the immortal King
> testify the verses of the Book, some of which We have already mentioned.420
> Should ye turn unto God and embrace His Cause, spread           not disorder within it,
> and measure not the Book of God with your selfish desires. This, verily, is the Counsel of
> God aforetime and hereafter, and to this God's witnesses and chosen ones, yea, each and
> every one of Us, do solemnly attest.421
> People for the most part delight in superstitions. They regard a single drop of the sea of
> delusion as preferable to an ocean of certitude. By holding fast unto names they deprive
> themselves of the inner reality and by clinging to vain imaginings they are kept back from
> the dayspring of heavenly signs. God grant [that] you may be graciously aided under all
> conditions to shatter the idols of superstition and to tear away the veils of the
> imaginations of men. Authority lieth in the grasp of God, the Fountainhead of revelation
> and inspiration and the Lord of the Day of Resurrection.422

Whether a seeker after truth or a believer immersing himself in the Word of God, either
one must first and foremost purify his heart in preparation for receipt of divinely inspired
understanding of the words and teachings revealed by the Manifestation of God:

> Unto every discerning observer it is evident and manifest that had these people in the
> days of each of the Manifestations of the Sun of Truth sanctified their eyes, their ears, and
> their hearts from whatever they had seen, heard, and felt, they surely would not have
> been deprived of beholding the beauty of God, nor strayed far from the habitations of
> glory.423
> This is the food that conferreth everlasting life upon the pure in heart and the illumined
> in spirit.424
> O my brother! Take thou the step of the spirit, so that, swift as the twinkling of an eye,
> thou mayest flash through the wilds of remoteness and bereavement, attain the Ridvan of
> everlasting reunion, and in one breath commune with the heavenly Spirits. For with
> human feet thou canst never hope to traverse these immeasurable distances, nor attain
> thy goal. Peace be upon him whom The light of truth guideth unto all truth, and who, in
> the name of God, standeth in the path of His Cause, upon the shore of true
> understanding.425
> Would that the hearts of men could be cleansed from these man-made limitations and
> obscure thoughts imposed upon them! haply they may be illumined by the light of the
> Sun of true knowledge, and comprehend the mysteries of divine wisdom.426
> The heart must needs therefore be cleansed from the idle sayings of men, and sanctified
> from every earthly affection, so that it may discover the hidden meaning of divine
> inspiration, and become the treasury of the mysteries of divine knowledge.427

It is incumbent upon thee, by the permission of God, to cleanse the eye of thine heart
from the things of the world, that thou mayest realize the infinitude of divine knowledge,
and mayest behold Truth so clearly that thou wilt need no proof to demonstrate His
reality, nor any evidence to bear witness unto His testimony.428
Shouldst thou ponder these words in thine heart, thou wilt of a certainty find the doors of
divine wisdom and infinite knowledge flung open before thy face.429
Wert thou to attain to but a dewdrop of the crystal waters of divine knowledge, thou
wouldst readily realize that true life is not the life of the flesh but the life of the spirit. For
the life of the flesh is common to both men and animals, whereas the life of the spirit is
possessed only by the pure in heart who have quaffed from the ocean of faith and
partaken of the fruit of certitude. This life knoweth no death, and this existence is
crowned by immortality.430
Only those will attain to the knowledge of the Word of God that have turned unto Him,
and repudiated the manifestations of Satan.431
Strive, therefore, O my brother, to grasp the meaning of "Resurrection," and cleanse
thine ears from the idle sayings of these rejected people. Shouldst thou step into the
realm of complete detachment, thou wilt readily testify that no day is mightier than this
Day, and that no resurrection more awful than this Resurrection can ever be
conceived.432
It hath been witnessed in this day how many of the divines, owing to their rejection of the
Truth, have fallen into, and abide within, the uttermost depths of ignorance, and whose
names have been effaced from the scroll of the glorious and learned.433
O my friend, were the bird of thy mind to explore the heavens of the Revelation of the
Qur’án, were it to contemplate the realm of divine knowledge unfolded therein, thou
wouldst assuredly find unnumbered doors of knowledge set open before thee.434
Ponder this in thine heart, that the sweet gales of divine knowledge, blowing from the
meads of mercy, may waft upon thee the fragrance of the Beloved's utterance, and cause
thy soul to attain the Ridvan of understanding.435
…cleanse the darkened self with the waters of mercy flowing from the Source of divine
knowledge; that perchance thou mayest, through the power of God and the light of divine
guidance, distinguish the Morn of everlasting splendour from the darksome night of
error.436
And yet, feeble souls, through lack of understanding, reject these abstruse utterances, and
question the truth of such traditions. Nay, none can comprehend them save those that
are possessed of an understanding heart. Say, He is that End for Whom no end is all the
universe can be imagined, and for Whom no beginning in the world of creation can be
conceived. Behold, O concourse of the earth, the splendours of the End, revealed in the
Manifestations of the Beginning!437
Whoso desireth to fathom the mystery of this "Mi'raj," and craveth a drop from this
ocean, if the mirror of his heart be already obscured by the dust of these learnings, he
must needs cleanse and purify it ere the light of this mystery can be reflected therein.438

> We have driven from the human heart all else but Him Who is the Desire of the world,
> and glory therein.439
> O my brother! A divine Mine only can yield the gems of divine knowledge, and the
> fragrance of the mystic Flower can be inhaled only in the ideal Garden, and the lilies of
> ancient wisdom can blossom nowhere except in the city of a stainless heart. "In a rich
> soil, its plants spring forth abundantly by permission of its Lord, and in that soil which is
> bad, they spring forth but scantily."440
> But, O my brother, when the true seeker determines to take the step of search in the path
> leading to the knowledge of the Ancient of Days, he must, before all else, cleanse and
> purify his heart, which is the seat of the revelation of the inner mysteries of God, from the
> obscuring dust of all acquired knowledge, and the allusions of the embodiments of satanic
> fancy. He must purge his breast, which is the sanctuary of the abiding love of the
> Beloved, of every defilement, and sanctify his soul from all that pertaineth to water and
> clay, from all shadowy and ephemeral attachments. He must so cleanse his heart that no
> remnant of either love or hate may linger therein, lest that love blindly incline him to
> error, or that hate repel him away from the truth. Even as thou dost witness in this day
> how most of the people, because of such love and hate, are bereft of the immortal Face,
> have strayed far from the Embodiments of the divine mysteries, and, shepherdless, are
> roaming through the wilderness of oblivion and error.441
> Only when the lamp of search, of earnest striving, of longing desire, of passionate
> devotion, of fervid love, of rapture, and ecstasy, is kindled within the seeker's heart, and
> the breeze of His loving-kindness is wafted upon his soul, will the darkness of error be
> dispelled, the mists of doubts and misgivings be dissipated, and the lights of knowledge
> and certitude envelop his being.442
> With unswerving vision, with pure heart, and sanctified spirit, consider attentively what
> God hath established as the testimony of guidance for His people in His Book, which is
> recognized as authentic by both the high and lowly.443
> The understanding of His words and the comprehension of the utterances of the Birds of
> Heaven are in no wise dependent upon human learning. They depend solely upon purity
> of heart, chastity of soul, and freedom of spirit. This is evidenced by those who, today,
> though without a single letter of the accepted standards of learning, are occupying the
> loftiest seats of knowledge; and the garden of their hearts is adorned, through the showers
> of divine grace, with the roses of wisdom and the tulips of understanding. Well is it with
> the sincere in heart for their share of the light of a mighty Day!444
> In fact, all the Scriptures and the mysteries thereof are condensed into this brief account.
> So much so, that were a person to ponder it a while in his heart, he would discover from
> all that hath been said the mysteries of the Words of God, and would apprehend the
> meaning of whatever hath been manifested by that ideal King.445
> None apprehendeth the meaning of these utterances except them whose hearts are
> assured, whose souls have found favour with God, and whose minds are detached from all
> else but Him.446

‘Abdu’l-Bahá likewise indicated that it is only with a pure heart that the believer can
understand the symbolic meanings of the figurative Word of God:

> It is easy to read the Holy Scriptures, but it is only with a clean heart and a pure mind
> that one may understand their true meaning. Let us ask God's help to enable us to
> understand the Holy Books. Let us pray for eyes to see and ears to hear, and for hearts
> that long for peace.447
> I have been informed that the purpose of your class meeting is to study the significances
> and mysteries of the Holy Scriptures and understand the meaning of the divine
> Testaments. It is a cause of great happiness to me that you are turning unto the
> Kingdom of God, that you desire to approach the presence of God and to become
> informed of the realities and precepts of God. It is my hope that you may put forward
> your most earnest endeavor to accomplish this end, that you may investigate and study
> the Holy Scriptures word by word so that you may attain knowledge of the mysteries
> hidden therein. Be not satisfied with words, but seek to understand the spiritual meanings
> hidden in the heart of the words…The divine Words are not to be taken according to
> their outer sense. They are symbolical and contain realities of spiritual meaning…All the
> texts and teachings of the holy Testaments have intrinsic spiritual meanings. They are
> not to be taken literally. I, therefore, pray in your behalf that you may be given the
> power of understanding these inner real meanings of the Holy Scriptures and may
> become informed of the mysteries deposited in the words of the Bible so that you may
> attain eternal life and your hearts may be attracted to the Kingdom of God. May your
> souls be illumined by the light of the Words of God, and may you become repositories of
> the mysteries of God, for no comfort is greater and no happiness is sweeter than spiritual
> comprehension of the divine teachings.448

The believer is exhorted to purify his heart, so that he may receive prophetically inspired
understanding, but he is not promised that he will be able to understand the same as
anyone else or as much as the wisest and most perceptive of believers. In fact, Bahá’u’lláh
indicates that the capacity of each individual is…unique and personal, and that he should
be concerned with maximizing his own potential not with comparing his gifts with the
endowments of others:

> Thereupon, We imparted unto him, according to the measure of his capacity and
> understanding, certain truths of Science and ancient Wisdom.449
> We have variously and repeatedly set forth the meaning of every theme, that perchance
> every soul, whether high or low, may obtain, according to his measure and capacity, his
> share and portion thereof. Should he be unable to comprehend a certain argument, he
> may, thus, by referring unto another, attain his purpose. "That all sorts of men may
> know where to quench their thirst."450
> In fact, all the Scriptures and the mysteries thereof are condensed into this brief account.
> So much so, that were a person to ponder it a while in his heart, he would discover from
> all that hath been said the mysteries of the Words of God, and would apprehend the
> meaning of whatever hath been manifested by that ideal King. As the people differ in
> their understanding and station, We will accordingly make mention of a few traditions,
> that these may impart constancy to the wavering soul, and tranquillity to the troubled
> mind. Thereby, will the testimony of God unto the people , both high and low, be
> complete and perfect.451

As the individual believer is not assured of infallible protection from error, no individual is
given the authority to interpret the Word of God for himself and by himself. He is
counseled to turn to the Manifestation of God, to His chosen ones, and to the principles
He revealed which altogether constitute the most reliable way for him to ascertain the
Will of God. Consequently, the individual believer has no authority. Nevertheless, he
must be encouraged to read the Word, to study the Word, and to seek understanding of
the Word. For example, Bahá’u’lláh writes:

> Cast away, in My name that transcendeth all other names, the things ye possess, and
> immerse yourselves in this Ocean in whose depths lay hidden the pearls of wisdom and of
> utterance, an ocean that surgeth in My name, the All-Merciful.452
> Immerse yourselves in the ocean of My words, that ye may unravel its secrets, and
> discover all the pearls of wisdom that lie hid in its depths.453
> They that immerse themselves in the ocean of His utterances should at all times have the
> utmost regard for the divinely-revealed ordinances and prohibitions.454

He advises his readers to "reflect" (33 times in Kitáb-i-Iqan; 29 times in Gleanings; 8
times in Kitáb-i-Aqdas), to "ponder" (24 times in Kitáb-i-Iqan; 24 times in Gleanings; 5
times in Kitáb-i-Aqdas), and to "consider" (35 times in Kitáb-i-Iqan; 54 times in
Gleanings; 13 times in Kitáb-i-Aqdas), all of which indicate cognitive activity. Quoting a
hadith, he shows himself to be solidly in favor of deep thought, writing, "The wine of
renunciation must needs be quaffed, the lofty heights of detachment must needs be
attained, and the meditation referred to in the words “One hour’s reflection is preferable
to seventy years of pious worship” must needs be observed, so that the secret of the
wretched behaviour of the people might be discovered, those people who, despite the love
and yearning for truth which they profess, curse the followers of Truth when once He
hath been made manifest."455
Considering the clear and sacred principles set forth by Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
what is the current practice of Bahá’ís? Bahá’ís are using various interpretive tools,
models and approaches, including the following:
1\. Some isolate a particular teaching or a particular text, and analyze that particular; it is
very common for such studies not to examine the context of that teaching or text, in the
entire corpus of the Author, and in light of the entire Bahá’í canon;
2\. Some compare Bahá’í teachings or texts to Western ideas and language; often it is
assumed that science is the determiner of truth, and hence these particulars are weighed
in the balance of science as it is understood by an individual;
3\. Some compare Bahá’í teachings or texts to Islamic ideas and language; it is generally
the case that Bahá’í particulars are assumed to be Islamic in origin, and the specifics of
that origination are reconstructed;
4\. Some compare Bahá’í teachings or texts to non-Western, non-Islamic ideas and
languages; in this case there is usually a fair amount of speculative comparison, inasmuch
as there was very little contact between Bahá’í particulars and such non-Western and
non-Islamic cultures during the lifetimes of the Founder and his son

These approaches are widely regarded as normative in the Bahá’í community, and many
Bahá’ís associate them with liberal, modern, secular, scientific, global, non-partisan social
mores, and find them to be in harmony with their understanding of the social teachings of
the Bahá’í Faith, as expounded in North America and Europe by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in 1911-
1913\. Many have associated those who adhere closely to the authoritative interpretations
of the teachings and writings by Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi with
conservatism, traditionalism…some even with fundamentalism. They cite what they
take to be Shoghi Effendi's broad affirmations of the individual's right to possess personal
interpretations and the "undoubted right of the individual to self-expression":

> I feel that regarding such interpretations (of verses from the Scriptures) no one has the
> right to impose his view or opinion and require his listeners to believe in his particular
> interpretation of the sacred and prophetic writings. I have no objection to your
> interpretations and inferences so long as they are represented as your own personal
> observations and reflections.       It would be unnecessary and confusing to state
> authoritatively and officially a dogmatic Bahá’í interpretation to be universally accepted
> and taught by believers. Such matters I feel should be left to the personal judgment and
> insight of individual teachers.456

It is clear from this statement that Shoghi Effendi did not regard the espousal of
authoritative interpretations coupled with insistence that they be adopted by all Bahá’ís to
be either necessary or efficacious…he writes that "it would be unnecessary and confusing
to state authoritatively and officially a dogmatic Bahá’í interpretation to be universally
accepted and taught by believers". Shoghi Effendi did not clarify the meaning of every
teaching and word revealed by Bahá’u’lláh. Indeed, he often declined to give his
interpretations of matters that were not already explained by Bahá’u’lláh or ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. For example, when asked about certain details of a passage in Epistle to the Son of
the Wolf--

> In the treasuries of the knowledge of God there lieth concealed a knowledge which, when
> applied, will largely, though not wholly, eliminate fear. This knowledge, however, should
> be taught from childhood, as it will greatly aid in its elimination. Whatever decreaseth
> fear increaseth courage. Should the Will of God assist Us, there would flow out from the
> Pen of the Divine Expounder a lengthy exposition of that which hath been mentioned,
> and there would be revealed, in the field of arts and sciences, what would renew the world
> and the nations. A word hath, likewise, been written down and recorded by the Pen of the
> Most High in the Crimson Book which is capable of fully disclosing that force which is
> hid in men, nay of redoubling its potency. We implore God—exalted and glorified be
> He—to graciously assist His servants to do that which is pleasing and acceptable unto
> Him.457
--the Guardian makes the following comments:

> Unfortunately it would seem that the knowledge ‘which could largely eliminate fear’ has
> not been disclosed or identified by Bahá’u’lláh, so we do not know what it is. However,
> what Bahá’u’lláh did not elaborate but what He meant by the ‘world’ recorded in the
> Crimson Book was the power of the Covenant. The ‘Crimson Book’ refers to the Book of

> His Covenant, and the reference above means the power for unity which the Covenant
> possesses and radiates.458

In the above-cited passage, it appears that the Guardian did not wish an individual Bahá’í
to press for the adoption of an authoritative interpretation of Scriptural verses that were
not specifically explained by Bahá’u’lláh or ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Another statement that has
been understood by many as according broad liberties of self-understanding and self-
expression to believers is the following:

> Let us also remember that at the very root of the Cause lies the principle of the
> undoubted right of the individual to self-expression, his freedom to declare his conscience
> and set forth his views.459

The context of this passage is easily traced. On 23 February 1924, Shoghi Effendi wrote
a letter to the American Bahá’ís, which is included in its entirety in Bahá’í
Administration. A portion of this letter, showing the position of the statement in
question, and the allied articulations of principle that undoubtedly relate to that
statement, is here cited in full:

> The various Assemblies, local and national, constitute today the bedrock upon the
> strength of which the Universal House is in future to be firmly established and raised. Not
> until these function vigorously and harmoniously can the hope for the termination of this
> period of transition be realized. It devolves upon us whose dearest wish is to see the Cause
> enter upon that promised era of universal recognition and world achievements, to do all
> in our power to consolidate the foundations of these Assemblies, promoting at the same
> time a fuller understanding of their purpose and more harmonious cooperation for their
> maintenance and success. Let us also remember that at the very root of the
> Cause lies the principle of the undoubted right of the individual to self-
> expression, his freedom to declare his conscience and set forth his views. If
> certain instructions460 of the Master are today particularly emphasized and scrupulously
> adhered to, let us be sure that they are but provisional measures designed to guard and
> protect the Cause in its present state of infancy and growth until the day when this tender
> and precious plant shall have sufficiently grown to be able to withstand the unwisdom of
> its friends and the attacks of its enemies.
> Let us also bear in mind that the keynote of the Cause of God is not dictatorial authority
> but humble fellowship, not arbitrary power, but the spirit of frank and loving
> consultation. Nothing short of the spirit of a true Bahá’í can hope to reconcile the
> principles of mercy and justice, of freedom and submission, of the sanctity of the right of
> the individual and of self-surrender, of vigilance, discretion and prudence on the one
> hand, and fellowship, candor, and courage on the other.
> The duties of those whom the friends have freely and conscientiously elected as their
> representatives are no less vital and binding than the obligations of those who have
> chosen them. Their function is not to dictate, but to consult, and consult not only among
> themselves, but as much as possible with the friends whom they represent. They must
> regard themselves in no other light but that of chosen instruments for a more efficient and
> dignified presentation of the Cause of God. They should never be led to suppose that they
> are the central ornaments of the body of the Cause, intrinsically superior to others in
> capacity or merit, and sole promoters of its teachings and principles. They should
> approach their task with extreme humility, and endeavor, by their open-mindedness,
> their high sense of justice and duty, their candor, their modesty, their entire devotion to

> the welfare and interests of the friends, the Cause, and humanity, to win, not only the
> confidence and the genuine support and respect of those whom they serve, but also their
> esteem and real affection. They must, at all times, avoid the spirit of exclusiveness, the
> atmosphere of secrecy, free themselves from a domineering attitude, and banish all forms
> of prejudice and passion from their deliberations. They should, within the limits of wise
> discretion, take the friends into their confidence, acquaint them with their plans, share
> with them their problems and anxieties, and seek their advice and counsel. And, when
> they are called upon to arrive at a certain decision, they should, after dispassionate,
> anxious and cordial consultation, turn to God in prayer, and with earnestness and
> conviction and courage record their vote and abide by the voice of the majority, which
> we are told by our Master to be the voice of truth, never to be challenged, and always to
> be whole-heartedly enforced. To this voice the friends must heartily respond, and regard
> it as the only means that can insure the protection and advancement of the Cause.461

The overall context of this remark indicates that it points to the right of the individual
believer to express his views in the context of the administration of his community, such
as during the consultation of the nineteen day feast, in correspondence and meetings with
the spiritual assembly, and in annual convention which elects the spiritual assembly at the
local and national level. It does not refer to the uninhibited right of the individual to self-
expression at all times and under all circumstances. Notwithstanding the Guardian's
encouragement of individual self-expression, he was adamant that Bahá’ís adhere closely
to the Bahá’í teachings in their purity:

> There are two main principles which the Guardian wishes the friends to always bear in
> mind and to conscientiously and faithfully follow. First is the principle of unqualified and
> whole-hearted loyalty to the revealed Word. The believers should be careful not to
> deviate, even a hair-breadth, from the Teachings. Their supreme consideration should be
> to safeguard the purity of the principles, tenets and laws of the Faith. It is only by this
> means that they can hope to maintain the organic unity of the Cause. There can and
> should be no liberals or conservatives, no moderates or extremes in the Cause. For they
> are all subject to the one and the same law which is the Law of God. This law transcends
> all differences, all personal or local tendencies, moods and aspirations. Next is the
> principle of complete, and immediate obedience to the Assemblies, both local and
> national. It is the responsibility of these Bahá’í administrative bodies to enable the
> community to acquire, and increasingly deepen in the knowledge and understanding of
> the Cause. Doctrinal unity and administrative unity, these are the two chief pillars that
> sustain the edifice of the Cause, and protect it from the storms of opposition which so
> severely rage against it.462
> I urge them to study profoundly the revealed utterances of Bahá’u’lláh and the discourses
> of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and not to rely unduly on the representation and interpretation of the
> Teachings given by the Bahá’í speakers and teachers.463
> To deepen in the Cause means to read the writings of Bahá’u’lláh and the Master so
> thoroughly as to be able to give it to others in its pure form. There are many who have
> some superficial idea of what the Cause stands for. They, therefore, present it together
> with all sorts of ideas that are their own. As the Cause is still in its early days we must be
> most careful lest we fall under this error and injure the Movement we so much adore.

There is no limit to the study of the Cause. The more we read the Writings the more

> truths we can find in them and the more we will see that our previous notions were
> erroneous.464

While Shoghi Effendi issued many letters with his authoritative and divinely guided
interpretations of the teachings and writings of the Faith, he also encouraged the Bahá’ís
to read, study, think for themselves, and teach the Faith in their own way, rather than
trying to imitate anyone else. The Universal House of Justice reiterated this fundamental
human right and responsibility in a series of publications:

> A clear distinction is made in our Faith between authoritative interpretation and the
> interpretation or understanding that each individual arrives at for himself from his study
> of its teachings. While the former is confined to the Guardian, the latter, according to the
> guidance given to us by the Guardian himself, should by no means be suppressed. In fact
> such individual interpretation is considered the fruit of man’s rational power and
> conducive to a better understanding of the teachings, provided that no disputes or
> arguments arise among the friends and the individual himself understands and makes it
> clear that his views are merely his own. Individual interpretations continually change as
> one grows in comprehension of the teachings…So, although individual insights can be
> enlightening and helpful, they can also be misleading. The friends must therefore learn to
> listen to the views of others without being overawed or allowing their faith to be shaken,
> and to express their own views without pressing them on their fellow Bahá’ís.465
> The existence of authoritative interpretations does not preclude the individual from
> engaging in the study of the Teachings and thereby arriving at a personal interpretation
> or understanding. A clear distinction is, however, drawn in the Bahá’í Writings between
> authoritative interpretation and the understanding that each individual arrives at from a
> study of its Teachings. Individual interpretations based on a person’s understanding of
> the Teachings constitute the fruit of man’s rational power and may well contribute to a
> greater comprehension of the Faith. Such views, nevertheless, lack authority. In
> presenting their personal ideas, individuals are cautioned not to discard the authority of
> the revealed words, not to deny or contend with the authoritative interpretation, and not
> to engage in controversy; rather they should offer their thoughts as a contribution to
> knowledge, making it clear that their views are merely their own.466
> Individual interpretations based on a person’s understanding of the teachings constitute
> the fruit of man’s rational power and may well contribute to a more complete
> understanding of the Faith. Such views, however, lack authority. The believers are,
> therefore, free to accept or disregard them. Further, the manner in which an individual
> presents his interpretation is important. For example, he must at no time deny or contend
> with the authoritative interpretation, but rather offer his idea as a contribution to
> knowledge, making it clear that his views are merely his own.467

These matters are elucidated by the Universal House of Justice, particularly in its 29
December 1988 letter to the American Bahá’ís on "Individual Rights and Freedoms"468:

> ¶1. We have noticed with concern evidences of a confusion of attitudes among some of
> the friends when they encounter difficulties in applying Bahá'í principles to questions of
> the day. On the one hand, they acknowledge their belief in Bahá'u'lláh and His teachings;
> on the other, they invoke Western liberal democratic practices when actions of Bahá'í
> institutions or of some of their fellow Bahá'ís do not accord with their expectations. At the

heart of this confusion are misconceptions of such fundamental issues as individual rights
and freedom of expression in the Bahá'í community. The source of the potential
difficulties of the situation appears to us to be an inadequacy of Bahá'í perspective on the
part of both individual believers and their institutions…
¶11. It is this perspective that helps us to understand the question of freedom and its place
in Bahá'í thought and action. The idea and the fact of freedom pervade all human
concerns in an infinitude of notions and modes. Freedom is indeed essential to all
expressions of human life.
¶12. Freedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom of action are among the
freedoms which have received the ardent attention of social thinkers across the centuries.
The resulting outflow of such profound thought has exerted a tremendous liberating
influence in the shaping of modern society. Generations of the oppressed have fought and
died in the name of freedom. Certainly the want of freedom from oppression has been a
dominant factor in the turmoil of the times: witness the plethora of movements which
have resulted in the rapid emergence of new nations in the latter part of the twentieth
century. A true reading of the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh leaves no doubt as to the high
importance of these freedoms to constructive social processes. Consider, for instance,
Bahá'u'lláh's proclamation to the kings and rulers. Can it not be deduced from this alone
that attainment of freedom is a significant purpose of His Revelation? His denunciations
of tyranny and His urgent appeals on behalf of the oppressed provide unmistakable proof.
But does not the freedom foreshadowed by His Revelation imply nobler, ampler
manifestations of human achievement? Does it not indicate an organic relationship
between the internal and external realities of man such as has not yet been attained?
¶13. In his summary of significant Bahá'í teachings, Shoghi Effendi wrote that Bahá'u'lláh
"inculcates the principle of 'moderation in all things'; declares that whatsoever, be it
'liberty, civilization and the like', 'passeth beyond the limits of moderation' must 'exercise
a pernicious influence upon men'; observes that western civilization has gravely perturbed
and alarmed the peoples of the world; and predicts that the day is approaching when the
'flame' of a civilization 'carried to excess' 'will devour the cities'."
¶14. Expounding the theme of liberty, Bahá'u'lláh asserted that "the embodiment of
liberty and its symbol is the animal"; that "liberty causeth man to overstep the bounds of
propriety, and to infringe on the dignity of his station"; that "true liberty consisteth in
man's submission unto My commandments". "We approve of liberty in certain
circumstances," He declared, "and refuse to sanction it in others." But He gave the
assurance that, "Were men to observe that which We have sent down unto them from the
Heaven of Revelation, they would, of a certainty, attain unto perfect liberty." And again
He said: "Mankind in its entirety must firmly adhere to whatsoever hath been revealed
and vouchsafed unto it. Then and only then will it attain unto true liberty."
¶15. Bahá'u'lláh's assertions clearly call for an examination of current assumptions.
Should liberty be as free as is supposed in contemporary Western thought? Where does
freedom limit our possibilities for progress, and where do limits free us to thrive? What
are the limits to the expansion of freedom? For so fluid and elastic are its qualities of
application and expression that the concept of freedom in any given situation is likely to
assume a different latitude from one mind to another; these qualities are, alas, susceptible
to the employment alike of good and evil. Is it any wonder, then, that Bahá'u'lláh exhorts
us to submission to the will of God?
¶16. Since any constructive view of freedom implies limits, further questions are
inevitable: what are the latitudes of freedom in the Bahá'í community? How are these to
be determined? Because human beings have been created to "carry forward an ever-
advancing civilization", the exercise of freedom, it may be deduced, is intended to enable
all to fulfill this purpose in their individual lives and in their collective functioning as a

society. Hence whatever in principle is required to realize this purpose gauges the
latitudes                  or                limits               of               freedom.
¶17. Contemplating Bahá'u'lláh's warning that "whatsoever passeth beyond the limits of
moderation will cease to exert a beneficial influence", we come to appreciate that the
Administrative Order He has conceived embodies the operating principles which are
necessary to the maintenance of that moderation which will ensure the "true liberty" of
humankind. All things considered, does the Administrative Order not appear to be the
structure of freedom for our Age? 'Abdu'l-Bahá offers us comfort in this thought, for He
has said that "the moderate freedom which guarantees the welfare of the world of
mankind and maintains and preserves the universal relationships, is found in its fullest
power and extension in the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh"…
¶24. As to freedom of expression, a fundamental principle of the Cause, the
Administrative Order provides unique methods and channels for its exercise and
maintenance; these have been amply described in the writings of the Faith, but they are
not yet clearly understood by the friends. For Bahá'u'lláh has extended the scope and
deepened the meaning of self-expression. In His elevation of art and of work performed in
the service of humanity to acts of worship can be discerned enormous prospects for a new
birth of expression in the civilization anticipated by His World Order. The significance of
this principle, now so greatly amplified by the Lord of the Age, cannot be doubted; but it
is in its ramifications in speech that keen understanding is urgently needed. From a Bahá'í
point of view, the exercise of freedom of speech must necessarily be disciplined by a
profound appreciation of both the positive and negative dimensions of freedom, on the
one hand, and of speech, on the other.
¶25. Bahá'u'lláh warns us that "the tongue is a smouldering fire, and excess of speech a
deadly poison." "Material fire consumeth the body," He says in elaborating the point,
"whereas the fire of the tongue devoureth both heart and soul. The force of the former
lasteth but for a time, whilst the effects of the latter endureth a century." In tracing the
framework of free speech, He again advises "moderation". "Human utterance is an
essence which aspireth to exert its influence and needeth moderation", He states, adding:
"As to its influence, this is conditional upon refinement which in turn is dependent upon
hearts which are detached and pure. As to its moderation, this hath to be combined with
tact and wisdom as prescribed in the Holy Scriptures and Tablets."
¶26. Also relevant to what is said, and how, is when it is said. For speech, as for so many
other things, there is a season. Bahá'u'lláh reinforces this understanding by drawing
attention to the maxim that, "Not everything that a man knoweth can be disclosed, nor
can everything that he can disclose be regarded as timely, nor can every timely utterance
be considered as suited to the capacity of those who hear it."
¶27. Speech is a powerful phenomenon. Its freedom is both to be extolled and feared. It
calls for an acute exercise of judgement, since both the limitation of speech and the excess
of it can lead to dire consequences. Thus there exist in the system of Bahá'u'lláh checks
and balances necessary to the beneficial uses of this freedom in the onward development
of society. A careful examination of the principles of Bahá'í consultation and the formal
and informal arrangements for employing them offer new insights into the dynamics of
freedom of expression…
¶37. We return to the phenomenal characteristics of speech. Content, volume, style, tact,
wisdom, timeliness are among the critical factors in determining the effects of speech for
good or evil. Consequently, the friends need ever to be conscious of the significance of
this activity which so distinguishes human beings from other forms of life, and they must
exercise it judiciously. Their efforts at such discipline will give birth to an etiquette of
expression worthy of the approaching maturity of the human race. Just as this discipline

> applies to the spoken word, it applies equally to the written word; and it profoundly
> affects the operation of the press.
> ¶38. The significance and role of the press in a new world system are conspicuous in the
> emphasis which the Order of Bahá'u'lláh places on accessibility to information at all levels
> of society. Shoghi Effendi tells us that Bahá'u'lláh makes "specific reference to 'the swiftly
> appearing newspapers', describes them as 'the mirror of the world' and as 'an amazing
> and potent phenomenon', and prescribes to all who are responsible for their production
> the duty to be sanctified from malice, passion and prejudice, to be just and fair-minded,
> to be painstaking in their inquiries, and ascertain all the facts in every situation".
> ¶39. In His social treatise, "The Secret of Divine Civilization", 'Abdu'l-Bahá offers insight
> as to the indispensability of the press in future society. He says it is "urgent that beneficial
> articles and books be written, clearly and definitely establishing what the present-day
> requirements of the people are, and what will conduce to the happiness and advancement
> of society". Further, He writes of the "publication of high thoughts" as the "dynamic
> power in the arteries of life", "the very soul of the world". Moreover, He states that,
> "Public opinion must be directed toward whatever is worthy of this day, and this is
> impossible except through the use of adequate arguments and the adducing of clear,
> comprehensive and conclusive proofs."
> ¶40. As to manner and style, Bahá'u'lláh has exhorted "authors among the friends" to
> "write in such a way as would be acceptable to fair-minded souls, and not lead to cavilling
> by the people". And He issues a reminder: "We have said in the past that one word hath
> the influence of spring and causeth hearts to become fresh and verdant, while another is
> like unto blight which causeth the blossoms and flowers to wither."
> ¶41. In the light of all this, the code of conduct of the press must embrace the principles
> and objectives of consultation as revealed by Bahá'u'lláh. Only in this way will the press
> be able to make its full contribution to the preservation of the rights of the people and
> become a powerful instrument in the consultative processes of society, and hence for the
> unity of the human race.

This statement, from which selections have been cited, is deserving of a careful and
systematic examination in its own stead. Suffice it to say that the guidance of the
Universal House of Justice on this matter of the rights of the individual Bahá’í in the
context of the Bahá’í community and in relation to wider society has many features that
make it distinctive and dissimilar to that prevailing in Western secular society. But the
fact of the matter is that all of the Bahá’í scholars cited in this study make their lives in
Western secular society, and hence their awareness of their rights and responsibilities is
conditioned largely by that society. Their participation in the Bahá’í community is only a
part of their lives, and, for most Bahá’ís it is a sideshow and not the main attraction. That
place is taken by family and work, social entertainments and obligations. And in the
heart and mind of most Western Bahá’ís, the main attraction consists of those
characteristics of personal identity that have been acquired over a lifetime, whilst Bahá’í
identity is composed, in most cases, of ideas assimilated in early adulthood and elaborated
over the course of subsequent decades. It is the fruits of that experience that have
resulted in the views set forth here.
The right of the individual, to arrive at his own interpretations of the Word of God, and
his own understanding of the teachings, together with the right of the individual to
express his views, are fundamental underpinnings of the process of individual
interpretation. Without a statement guaranteeing these two rights, to quote Dann May,

"it might be argued that the very existence of infallible interpretation within the Bahá’í Faith precludes or,
at the very least, severely limits the sphere of individual interpretation."469 Shoghi Effendi has
indicated that the individual must demonstrate "unqualified and whole-hearted loyalty to the
revealed Word…be careful not to deviate, even a hair-breadth, from the Teachings...safeguard the purity of
the principles, tenets and laws of the Faith"470; while the Universal House of Justice has affirmed
that the individual must not "discard the authority of the revealed words" and "must at no time deny
or contend with the authoritative interpretation". The Guardian indicated that no individual
believer "has the right to impose his view or opinion and require his listeners to believe in his particular
interpretation of the sacred and prophetic writings" and he felt that such interpretation "should be
left to the personal judgment and insight of individual teachers."471 Likewise, the Universal House of
Justice indicated that "individual interpretations based on a person’s understanding of the
Teachings…lack authority" and it advises that "in presenting their personal ideas, individuals are
cautioned not…to engage in controversy; rather they should offer their thoughts as a contribution to
knowledge, making it clear that their views are merely their own."472 To summarize the guidance
from the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice, individual interpretation and
individual self-expression are not only permitted, but encouraged. That permission and
that encouragement is not absolute, it is relative, and it is conditional upon the
responsible exercise of these freedoms by the individual. If the individual violates the
contract between himself and the Manifestation of God by misrepresenting or distorting
the Bahá’í teachings, disobeying the Bahá’í institutions, flagrantly disregarding the moral
and ethical strictures of the Faith, then he will be advised of the consequences of his
actions. His freedoms will not be inhibited, but if he persists in violating that contract and
misrepresenting himself as a Bahá’í and the Bahá’í Faith as a community and a body of
teachings, his association with the Bahá’í community will be limited, and ultimately it
may be severed. This is both for his protection, for his violation of this contract is
extremely detrimental to his spiritual health, and for the protection of the Bahá’í
community, institutions, and the Cause of God. For nothing can injure the Cause of God
except the hypocritical behavior of those who claim to be its followers but whose actions
do not agree with their words. Bahá’u’lláh affirmed this truth in Kalimat-i-Firdawsiyyih,
and reiterated it in Epistle to the Son of the Wolf:

> My imprisonment doeth Me no harm, neither the tribulations I suffer, nor the things that
> have befallen Me at the hands of My oppressors. That which harmeth Me is the conduct
> of those who, though they bear My name, yet commit that which maketh My heart and
> My pen to lament.473

There is a widespread assumption in institutions of higher learning, located throughout
the planet and based on the Western academic model, that religious texts can best we
studied according to "scientific" criteria called "higher criticism", employing the so-called
"historical-critical method". Higher criticism was originated in Germany by a group of
Biblical scholars including "Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834), David Friedrich
Strauss (1808–1874), and Ludwig Feuerbach (1804–1872), who began in the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries to analyze the historical records of the Middle
East from Christian and Old Testament times, in search of independent confirmation of
events related in the Bible. These ideas were taken to England by Samuel Taylor
Coleridge and, in particular, by George Eliot's translations of Strauss's Life of Jesus (1846)
and Feuerbach's Essence of Christianity (1854). La Vie de Jésus (1863), by a Frenchman,
Ernest Renan (1823–1892), continued the same tradition. But three years earlier before

the appearance of La Vie de Jésus, liberal Anglican theologians had begun the process of
incorporating this historical criticism into Christian doctrine in Essays and Reviews (1860).
In Catholicism, L'Evangile et l'Eglise (1902), by Alfred Loisy, against the Essence of Christianity
of Adolf von Harnack and less inspired than Renan, gave birth to the modernist crisis
(1902–1961). Some scholars, such as Rudolf Bultmann, have used higher criticism of the
Bible to demythologize it."474
Higher criticism was already well established in many academic institutions and liberal
Protestant seminaries by the early 20th century, when the Bahá’í Faith arrived from the
Middle East. Since then higher criticism has become entrenched and virtually
unassailable. The dissenters from the approach taken by higher criticism are generally
considered to include fundamentalist Christians, Orthodox Jews and anti-Western
Muslims. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá did not refer to higher criticism in his Writings, but in at least two
of his conversations with Westerners, the topic came up. Here is the record of the first of
these conversations:

> Question: How shall we determine the truth or error of certain biblical interpretation, as,
> for instance, the higher criticism and other present-day Christian teachings?
> 'Abdu'l-Bahá: Your question is an abstruse and important one. Complete answer to it
> would require a long time. I will reply to it briefly. The only true Explainer of the Book of
> God is the Holy Spirit, for no two minds are alike, no two can comprehend alike, no two
> can speak alike. That is to say, from the mere human standpoint of interpretation there
> could be neither truth nor agreement.475

Here we find ‘Abdu’l-Bahá reiterating a principle which has been discussed in detail in
the first part of this essay. He clearly regarded higher criticism as a "mere human standpoint
of interpretation". It is ironic that now that so many liberal Protestants, Catholics and Jews,
and academic students of the Bible have embraced higher criticism, it has in large part
taken the place of the "Explainer of the Book of God", and consequently those who adhere to
this interpretive principle, of the binding judgment of "the true Explainer" are now
perceived to be causing disagreements because they do not accept the consensus
achieved through higher criticism. He continues, in the same talk:

> Question: Do you approve of the new thought in which the control of mind over matter is
> the central principle?
> 'Abdu'l-Bahá: Philosophy develops the mind. Christ and the Word of God are revealed
> through the Spirit. Plato says, "The mental conclusions are so and so." Christ says, "Be
> led of the Spirit."476

‘Abdu’l-Bahá reiterates the authority of the Holy Spirit as arbiter of truth, and praises
philosophy as effective for developing the "mind" but identifies the higher truth which
results when we are "led of the Spirit." And he concludes with these words:

> Question: Should children be allowed to read the higher criticism?
> 'Abdu'l-Bahá: They should first be taught the reality of religion as a foundation. For
> instance, in the Catholic Church the child is taught that through some act of the priest
> the bread and wine of the sacrament become the flesh and blood of Jesus Christ. The
> mind cannot accept this. The child must be taught that this transformation is symbolical
> of the truth that Christ is the food from heaven, the eating of which produces eternal life.

The Jews had memorized the Bible but failed to grasp its meanings. If they had

> understood the spiritual significances of the scriptures, they would have been the first
> believers in Christ. You are among the first believers in this country. You are the
> children of the Kingdom. Bahá'u'lláh has taught you the reality of religion. There are
> many of the Bahá'í friends in Persia whom we do not know, but we know you here in
> America. Turn your faces to the Sun of Reality. That Sun has always risen in the East.
> Find the answer to your questions in your heart. Be as little children. Until the soil is
> prepared, it cannot receive the benefit of planting.477

The implication of this response is that the answers are to be found in the teachings of
Bahá’u’lláh, and the expositions of those teachings by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and others who have
"understood the spiritual significances of the scriptures", who have found answers to their
questions in their hearts, by turning towards the source of knowledge--here, in their
midst. This position is reiterated with particular clarity in the second conversation:

> A. B. "Whom dost thou think Christ was?''
> H. S. [Hans Springer] "I believe he was a great philosopher."
> A. B. "Oh no! He was much greater than a philosopher. He was the Word of God, the
> Spirit of God."
> H. S. "Whew! There are many scholars in Europe who do not believe that there was ever
> such a person as Christ. On the other hand there is an increasing host of people whose
> faith in Christianity is shaken because the ministers of the Gospel do not live in accord
> with the behests of their Master. They have become worldlings wrapped up in traditions

In this conversation as well, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá points out that the views of philosophers, like
the philosophers themselves, do not last, whereas the teachings of the Manifestations are
the truth and through these teachings souls become "the means of the illumination of the world
of humanity". While not specifically addressing the higher criticism, he indicates through
his comments that he does not regard this as a sufficient approach for becoming informed
of the spiritual truths latent in the Word of God.
We return now to the commentaries by Bahá’í scholars on hermeneutics…
Dann May looks at individual interpretation, and seeks to discern "principles of
interpretation" that might guide Bahá’í hermeneutics. He points out "four common pitfalls"--
"the first is a tendency to overconceptualize or overanalyze a text or religious tradition"; "the second
pitfall…on the one hand, a tendency to ignore the obvious meaning of the words, or on the other hand, to
make unwarranted and extremely allegorical interpretations"; "the third pitfall is either to neglect or

overemphasize the social and historical context of a particular tradition"; "the final pitfall is the tendency
to interpret passages, especially obscure ones, out of context of in isolation from the larger body of canonical
writings." (p. 43) He does not cite Bahá’í sources for these four pitfalls, and it is not at all
obvious that such sources exist. May proceeds directly to a consideration of the principles
of interpretation he derives from the Bahá’í Writings (pp. 42-51): (1)"religious texts contain
multiple meanings"; (2)"the symbolic and mythological character of religious language"; (3)"the role of
science and reason in the interpretive process"; (4)"the progressive and relative nature of religious truth"; (5)
"the twofold nature of religion"; (6)"the problem of personal biases and presuppositions"; (7)"the
independent investigation of reality"; (8)"interpretive moderation". May then demonstrates a Bahá’í
exegesis, finding "three steps…in the Bahá’í interpretation" of a passage from the Book of
Isaiah. "The first step involves the use of reason and scientific knowledge to question the literal
meaning…The second step involves a symbolic interpretation…The third and final step entails a 'Bahá’í-
centric' interpretation" (pp. 51-52). May concludes with affirming that the eight principles
"certainly constitute some of the most important ones"; that "individual interpretation is repeatedly
encouraged within the Bahá’í writings"; that "we must interpret not only religious texts and sacred
writings but also beliefs, doctrines, rituals, and ceremonies"; "the eight principles of
interpretation…function interdependently and in concert with each other…we should develop and
integrated and balanced approach…avoiding the extreme or excessive use of one principle over the others";
"we should consider all interpretations warranted by the text"; "religious language primarily communicates
a vision or interpretation of life…often clothed in symbolic language and embedded in mythological
narratives that must be reinterpreted in every age." (p. 53)
Michael Sours does not discuss a variety of interpretive principles, nor enumerate
pitfalls. He introduces one interpretive principle--"sound theology is essential to correct
interpretation"--and "suggests that there may be numerous ways to interpret a Scriptural passage or verse,
all of which can legitimately be considered correct, but the strength of any given interpretation would depend
on whether or not it consciously or unconsciously yielded meanings that reflect the true reality of God's
nature." He proceeds them to argue that all of Bahá’u’lláh's interpretations of Scripture
are symbolic and multivalent. "The laws of Bahá’u’lláh are the only category that fall within a
single interpretive approach; that being literal. However, even here one person's literal interpretation may
differ from another person." Sours seems to agree with May's first principle of interpretation,
namely, "religious texts contain multiple meanings" and his second principle, "the symbolic and
mythological character of religious language". His exegesis however, is markedly different in
approach to that employed by May.
Seena Fazel and Khazeh Fananapazir specifically address the literal and symbolic
interpretations of Scripture employed by Bahá’u’lláh. They point out that "even when the
evident meaning is sought, the implication is not necessarily the literal." No examples are cited, and
in the absence of such, it seems that the authors did not have enough confidence in the
idea to demonstrate its reasonableness, let alone its Scriptural justification. They define
ta'wil as "an esoteric interpretation allowing for many flights of individual fancy" and indicate that
Bahá’u’lláh did not approve of this method, but that he was in support of tafsir, which
they define as "a formal, legitimate interpretation of Scripture". The only parallel to this point in
the previously considered papers is in May's indication that individual interpretations
should follow the principle of moderation. Insofar as ta'wil is known for its immoderacy,
there is a parallel. F&F speak of authoritative versus individual interpretation, affirm that
there are no real contradictions within the Bahá’í canon, and that the Bahá’í canon must

be studied and interpreted in light of reading "in the context of the whole of the Revelation".
They conclude in calling for "balance between literal and metaphorical approaches"; refer to the
"vital role of the authorized interpretations"; "suggest that the stylistic use of exaggerated emphasis may
contribute to a fuller understanding of Bahá’í Scripture…"
Jack McLean speaks of "derivative theology" and defines it as "the subjective, relative, and
nonbinding elucidation of Bahá’í teachings by competent scholars. Subjective hear means that the
commentary is particular to the viewpoint of the writer and becomes objective only where a common
consensus exists as to its validity." He writes that "all Bahá’í theology, whether source or derivative can
be subdivided into three categories: the doctrinal, the ethical, and mystical (God Passes By 140). The
bulk of theological writing to date, however, falls almost entirely into the doctrinal category. Very little
commentary exists on the ethical dimension (moral theology)…Moreoever, little has been written by Bahá’í
scholars on mysticism. Theology is also concerned with the processes of history and with God's revelation
and final purpose (eschatology) within history." Unlike May, Sours, Fazel and Fananapazir,
McLean defines the practitioners of individual interpretation as "competent scholars", and
also unlike them, he indicates that the viewpoint of the individual become "objective only
where a common consensus exists as to its validity." He is guardedly approving of the "relativity
pole of the discussion among practitioners of interreligious dialogue", stating that "religious relativity acts
then as a bulwark against the one-way interpretation of dogmatism; implies that religious truth although
fundamentally one, is progressive, dynamic, infinite, and ever-changing; and allows us to accept various
interpretations of metaphysical and theological questions, which would on the surface appear to be
incompatible. It is thus an ally of a more inclusive view of reality, one that allows for diversity of
approaches. The relativity of religious truth also has strong implications for establishing some measure of
unity between science and religion or philosophy, one of the most meaningful and potentially fruitful
questions in our time." This appreciation for and seeming adoption of religious relativism by
McLean is found also in Dann May's "The Bahá'í Principle of Religious Unity and the
Challenge of Radical Pluralism"479, and in Moojan Momen's "Relativism: A Basis For
Bahá'í Metaphysics"480, and in various other publications. It should be pointed out that
while May does not espouse either the election of the "competent scholar" nor a full-blown
relativism in his article on Bahá’í hermeneutics, in his Master's Thesis he seems to favor
both. Sours, Fazel and Fananapazir have not published papers that would enable us to
specify their views on these two topics.
Juan Cole's "Commentary" on "Interpretation in the Bahá’í Faith" is focused largely on
the varieties of individual interpretation, which he describes as "figurative interpretation,
formal exegesis, and academic writing". Cole writes that "individual interpretation is not
supposed to contradict the clear text of the Bahá’í scriptures. Still, not all texts are clear.
And the authorization of diverse individual interpretations seems to be a recognition that
religious truth is difficult to standardize. This leeway for individual interpretation seems
to me to accord better with postmodern conceptions of knowledge as fragmented,
discontinuous and local than with Enlightenment conceptions of a single rationalist
master narrative…All in all, the corpus of official interpretation helps Bahá’ís understand
important aspects of the writings of Bahá’u’lláh, but leaves wise scope for continuing
investigation of the holy writ by individuals." As for the previous writers, Cole sees a
wide range of interpretive possibilities of the Bahá’í hermeneut, and he is very much in
favor of what McLean called "religious relativism". While he does not indicate that
figurative interpretation (ta'wil) requires specialized training and knowledge, Cole writes

that "another approach to understanding scripture is formal scripture commentary or exegesis (tafsir),
which strives to be less subjective and which is best accomplished with a knowledge of the original
languages in which scripture was written, their grammar, technical terms, and cultural
background…Exegesis requires technical linguistic and philological skills, and its Bahá’í practitioners fall
into the category of learned in Bahá', who were so praised by Bahá’u’lláh."
The "learned in Bahá'" are praised by Bahá’u’lláh in Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Lawh-i-Hikmat and
Kitáb-i-'Ahdi:

> Happy are ye, O ye the learned ones in Bahá. By the Lord! Ye are the billows of the Most
> Mighty Ocean, the stars of the firmament of Glory, the standards of triumph waving
> betwixt earth and heaven. Ye are the manifestations of steadfastness amidst men and the
> daysprings of Divine Utterance to all that dwell on earth. Well is it with him that turneth
> unto you, and woe betide the froward. This day, it behoveth whoso hath quaffed the
> Mystic Wine of everlasting life from the Hands of the loving-kindness of the Lord his
> God, the Merciful, to pulsate even as the throbbing artery in the body of mankind, that
> through him may be quickened the world and every crumbling bone.481
> Abase not the station of the learned in Bahá and belittle not the rank of such rulers as
administer justice amidst you.482

> Blessed are the rulers and the learned among the people of Bahá. They are My trustees
> among My servants and the manifestations of My commandments amidst My people.
> Upon them rest My glory, My blessings and My grace which have pervaded the world of
> being. In this connection the utterances revealed in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas are such that from
> the horizon of their words the light of divine grace shineth luminous and resplendent.483

The "learned in Bahá'" have an exalted station, and hence Cole's statement that the
Bahá’í practitioners of exegesis "fall into the category of learned in Bahá'" is an affirmation of
great import. In a letter in Persian dated 4 November 1931 and cited in a letter written
by the Universal House of Justice, Shoghi Effendi defines the "learned in Bahá'" in
referring to the passage cited from Kitáb-i-'Ahdi:

> In this holy cycle the "learned" are, on the one hand, the Hands of the Cause of God,
> and, on the other, the teachers and diffusers of His teachings who do not rank as Hands,
> but who have attained an eminent position in the teaching work. As to the "rulers" they
> refer to the members of the Local, National and International Houses of Justice. The
> duties of each of these souls will be determined in the future. 484

There is no indication, on the other hand, in the authoritative literature of the Faith, that
the "learned in Bahá'" are academic or amateur scholars. In fact, the Hands of the
Cause, and the Counselors and Auxiliary Board Members who have been appointed in
their stead by the Universal House of Justice, are not selected because of their "technical
linguistic and philological skills" or for other specialized learning. On the contrary, in a letter
written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice it is stated:

> Collateral with His summons to the pursuit of knowledge, Bahá'u'lláh has abolished
> entirely that feature of all past religions by which a special caste of persons such as the

> Christian priesthood or the Islamic `ulama came to exercise authority over the religious
> understanding and practice of their fellow believers. In a letter written in Persian on his
> behalf to the Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Istanbul, the Guardian is at some pains
> to underline the importance of this marked departure from past religious history: "But
> praise be to God that the Pen of Glory has done away with the unyielding and dictatorial
> views of the learned and the wise, dismissed the assertions of individuals as an
> authoritative criterion, even though they were recognized as the most accomplished and
> learned among men, and ordained that all matters be referred to authorized centres and
> specified assemblies." 485
‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated this principle in Lawh-i-Bayt-ul-‘Adl-‘Azam va Úsúl-i-Qadá’í:

> Today this process of deduction is the right of the body of the House of Justice, and the
> deductions and conclusions of individual learned men have no authority, unless they are
> endorsed by the House of Justice. The difference is precisely this, that from the
> conclusions and endorsements of the body of the House of Justice whose members are
> elected by and known to the worldwide Bahá’í community, no differences will arise;
> whereas the conclusions of individual divines and scholars would definitely lead to
> differences, and result in schism, division, and dispersion. The oneness of the Word would
> be destroyed, the unity of the Faith would disappear, and the edifice of the Faith of God
> would be shaken.486

Cole describes Bahá’í exegetes as having "technical and philological skills" and then indicates
that "although I have included some recent works by Bahá’í academics in Western universities under the
rubric of formal scripture commentary, the academic approach is in fact a new and distinct set of
methodologies…Contemporary academic scholarship takes advantage of all the advances in historical
linguistics, in sociology and anthropology, and in modern historiographical technique, which pays special
attention to weighting sources, to forms of textual analysis, to the hermeneutic circle, to contextualization,
and to change over time."         It is very clear to the reader that Cole regards academic
approaches to the study of the Bahá’í Writings as the most modern, the best suited to the
present and future, and the most deserving of readers. Cole's view is neither in harmony
with the authoritative position of the Guardian nor with the elucidation and legislative
expansion of the institution of the learned by the Universal House of Justice. In one of its
letters on the subject of scholarship, the Universal House of Justice authorized the
following statement:

> Finally, it is no doubt helpful to keep in mind that Bahá’ís who are trained in various
> academic disciplines do not constitute a discrete body within the community. While the
> Bahá’í institutions benefit on an ongoing basis from the advice of believers in many fields
> of specialization, there is obviously no group of academics who can claim to speak on
> behalf of Bahá’í scholars generally. Scholarly qualifications enable individuals to make
> greatly valued contributions to the work of the Cause, but do not set those possessing
> them apart from the general body of the believers.487

McLean stated that the commentary of an individual Bahá’í writer "becomes objective only
where a common consensus exists as to its validity."488 If by this McLean means that the
interpretation of an individual scholar only becomes "objective" when it is generally
accepted, then he seems to be in agreement with Cole, who writes "Bahá’í scriptural
commentary by individuals can gain popularity only by convincing its audience, not by being imposed from

above." In both cases, the authors assume that the popularity of the views of an individual
are a determining factor for them becoming objectified. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá indicated that a
diversification of views among learned individuals "would definitely lead to differences, and result
in schism, division, and dispersion…the oneness of the Word would be destroyed, the unity of the Faith
would disappear, and the edifice of the Faith of God would be shaken."489 It would not be
appropriate, therefore, for an individual scholar to seek to convince his fellow believers of
his point of view, nor would the consensus regarding a particular view among scholars or
among believers constitute a formal endorsement of that view. The scholar is advised, as
was demonstrated earlier, to share his views with others, but without seeking to convince
them, for "the deductions and conclusions of individual learned men have no authority"490 and he may
likewise submit his "deductions and conclusions" to the Universal House of Justice, for if they
"have no authority, unless they are endorsed by the House of Justice", then, if they are endorsed by
the House of Justice, they have authority. The seat of authority is not located in the
scholar, but rather in the House of Justice.
Cole comments on another matter that is not addressed by the other writers on Bahá’í
hermeneutics. He states that "when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi both commented on an issue,
they did not always give the same interpretation." He then elaborates in a footnote his opinion
that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gave one interpretation of a Biblical and Qur’ánic story, which he
alleges was contradicted by the Shoghi Effendi's secretary. This supposed conflict can be
very easily harmonized, by the fact that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá allowed for both the Judeo-
Christian and the Islamic version of the story, whereas the Guardian indicated that the
Islamic version was normative for Bahá’ís. These represent foci on an arc of
interpretation, which ultimately demonstrate two points--the one that the more recent
divine Revelation gives a more accurate depiction of events in sacred history, and that the
meaning behind this story in both versions is one and the same (which represents the
progressive revelation of the meaning of the Biblical and Qur’ánic narratives).
Fazel and Fananapazir discuss apparent contradictions in the Bahá’í canon, and cite
Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice on the topic. In the following
passages, the Guardian addresses the reconciliation of these apparent contradictions:

> We must take the teachings as a great, balanced whole, not seek out and oppose to each
> other two strong statements that have different meanings; somewhere in between, there
> are links uniting the two. That is what makes our Faith so flexible and well balanced. for
> instance there are calamities for testing and for punishment—there are also accidents,
> plain cause and effect!491
> These various statements must be taken in conjunction with all the Bahá'í teachings; we
> cannot get a correct picture by concentrating on just one phrase.492
> He feels that many of the perplexities that arise in your mind could be dissipated if you
> always conceived of the teachings as one great whole with many facets. Truth may, in
> covering different subjects, appear to be contradictory, and yet it is all one if you carry the
> thought through to the end. For instance the statement on life after death and the
> condition of believers and non-believers, you might say that a wonderful believer is alike a
> diamond blazing in the sun, an unawakened soul like one in a dark room. But we must
> couple this concept with the other part of the teachings, that God's Mercy exceeds His

> Justice, and that soul can progress in the world beyond; the unillumined soul can become
> brilliant.493
> Likewise he is constantly urging them to really study the Bahá'í teachings more deeply.
> One might liken Bahá'u'lláh's teachings to a sphere; there are points poles apart, and in
> between the thoughts and doctrines that unite them...494
> We must never take one sentence in the Teachings and isolate it from the rest: it does not
> mean we must not love, but we must reach a spiritual plane where God comes first and
> great human passions are unable to turn us away from Him. All the time we see people
> who either through the force of hate or the passionate attachment they have to another
> person, sacrifice principle or bar themselves from the Path of God.
> We know absence of light is darkness, but no one would assert darkness was not a fact. It
> exists even though it is only the absence of something else. So evil exists too, and we
> cannot close our eyes to it, even though it is a negative existence. We must seek to
> supplant it by good, and if we see an evil person is not influenceable by us, then we should
> shun his company for it is unhealthy.495
The Universal House of Justice has affirmed the same principle:

> In attempting to understand the Writings, therefore, one must first realise that there is
> and can be no real contradiction in them, and in light of this we can confidently seek the
> unity of meaning which they contain.496
> When these issues are approached with an understanding of the unity underlying all the
> Teachings, clarification results. Should the seeker, however, be influenced by a spirit of
> mistrust and conflict, then unending problems appear.497
> In considering the second passage we must once more hold fast to the principle that the
> teachings do not contradict themselves.498

In view of this principle, which Bahá’í scholarship has not yet developed in any direction,
it would appear that Cole's opposition of a statement of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to a statement
made on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, and his comment that "such discrepancies…suggest the need
for the development of a hermeneutical approach even to authoritative interpretive comments"499.
It is in response to Cole’s vociferous expression of his views, in communication with other
scholars with similar training, that the Department of the Secretariat of the Universal
House of Justice wrote, on 7 April 1999:

> As a number of the friends are aware, a campaign of internal opposition to the Teachings
> is currently being carried on through the use of the Internet, a communications system
> that now reaches virtually every part of the world. Differing from attacks familiar in the
> past, it seeks to recast the entire Faith into a socio-political ideology alien to Bahá'u'lláh's
> intent. In the place of the institutional authority established by His Covenant, it
> promotes a kind of interpretive authority which those behind it attribute to
> the views of persons technically trained in Middle East studies.
> Early in 1996, the deliberate nature of the plan was revealed in an accidental posting to
> an Internet list which Bahá'í subscribers had believed was dedicated to scholarly

exploration of the Cause. Some of the people responsible resigned from the Faith when
Counsellors pointed out to them the direction their activities were taking. A small number
of others continue to promote the campaign within the Bahá'í community.
In the past, in situations of a somewhat similar nature, the patience and compassion
shown by 'Abdu'l-Bahá and the Guardian helped various believers who had been misled
by ill-intentioned persons to eventually free themselves from such entanglements. In this
same spirit of forbearance the Universal House of Justice has intervened in the current
situation only to the extent that has been unavoidable, trusting to the good sense and the
goodwill of the believers involved to awaken to the spiritual dangers to which they are
exposing themselves. Nevertheless, certain Counsellors and National Spiritual Assemblies
are monitoring the problem closely, and the friends can be confident that whatever
further steps are needed to protect the integrity of the Cause will be taken.
As passages in the enclosed reprint make clear, this campaign of internal opposition-while
purporting to accept the legitimacy of the Guardianship and the Universal House of
Justice as twin successors of Bahá'u'lláh and the Centre of His Covenant-attempts to cast
doubt on the nature and scope of the authority conferred on them in the Writings. When
other Bahá'ís have pointed out that such arguments contradict explicit statements of the
Master, persons behind the scheme have responded by calling into question the
soundness of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's own judgement and perspective. Gradually, these arguments
have exposed the view of those involved that Bahá'u'lláh Himself was not the voice
of God to our age but merely a particularly enlightened moral philosopher,
one whose primary concern was to reform existing society.
By itself, such opposition would likely stand little chance of influencing reasonably
informed Bahá'ís. As one of the letters in the enclosed reprint (20 July 1997) points out,
the scheme relies for effect, therefore, on exploiting the confusion created in modern
thought by the reigning doctrines of materialism. Although the reality of God's
continuous relationship with His creation and His intervention in human life and history
are the very essence of the teachings of the Founders of the revealed religions, dogmatic
materialism today insists that even the nature of religion itself can be adequately
understood only through the use of an academic methodology designed to ignore the
truths that make religion what it is. In general, the strategy being pursued has been to
avoid direct attacks on the Faith's Central Figures. The effort, rather, has been to sow the
seeds of doubt among believers about the Faith's teachings and institutions by appealing
to unexamined prejudices that Bahá'ís may have unconsciously absorbed from non-Bahá'í
society. In defiance of the clear interpretation of 'Abdu'l-Bahá and the Guardian, for
example, Bahá'u'lláh's limiting of membership on the Universal House of Justice to men is
misrepresented as merely a [1]"temporary measure" subject to eventual revision if
sufficient pressure is brought to bear. Similarly, Shoghi Effendi's explanation of
Bahá'u'lláh's vision of the future Bahá'í World Commonwealth that will unite spiritual
and civil authority is dismissed in favour of the assertion that the modern political concept
of [2]"separation of church and state" is somehow one that Bahá'u'lláh intended as a
basic principle of the World Order He has founded. Particularly subtle is an attempt to
suggest that the [3]Mashriqu'l-Adhkar should evolve into a seat of quasi-doctrinal
authority, parallel to and essentially independent of the Local House of Justice, which
would permit various interests to insinuate themselves into the direction of the life
processes of the Cause.

CONCLUSIONS
As was stated at the onset of this paper, all of the scholars who have written about Bahá'í
hermeneutics, including those cited above, were at one time or another, enrolled
members of the Bahá'í community. Several of these scholars, including Dann May, Sen
McGlinn, Steven Scholl and Juan Ricardo Cole were no longer enrolled as Bahá'ís as of
2009, and all but one of these (Sen McGlinn) are no longer active in the field of Bábí and
Bahá'í Studies to which they contributed in the past. Others, including Khazeh
Fananapazir, Seena Fazel, Jack McLean, Robert Parry and Michael Sours are still
enrolled in the community but are also no longer currently active in the field of Bábí and
Bahá'í Studies. In fact, only one of those listed here is still very active in the field, Dr.
Christopher Buck. This is a very significant development, inasmuch as there were so few
writing about Bahá'í hermeneutics two decades ago, and the trail has gone cold.

Perhaps the next generation of Bahá'í scholars will adhere more closely to the
authoritative interpretations depicted above. The academy has become much more
tolerant and even encouraging of those scholars who choose to write from a faith-based
perspective, to eschew or to adapt the higher criticism that predominated in the academic
study of religion the 20th century so as to make it more compatible with traditional
religious convictions. At the same time, the academy is also championing multi-
culturalism and interdisciplinary studies, and both of these trends bode well for reducing
and even eliminating the cognitive dissonance that characterized the work of many
academics in Bábí and Bahá'í Studies during the time period featured in this study. This
speaks to the challenges of Bahá'ís who engage in theological and philosophical inquiries
and particularly those related to historical studies. On the other hand, in the coming
decades there may well be a proliferation of academic scholars who will, independent of
any Bahá'í affiliation, enter into a profound study of the Bahá'í teachings, texts and
history. If this occurs, these scholars will employ methodologies not anticipated by the
Author and subsequent leaders of the Bahá'í Faith. They will not be compelled, out of
loyalty to their community of faith, to adapt such methodologies to the understanding of
their co-religionists and to avoid conflicts with the directives of their religious leaders.
What new understandings will emerge is not yet known. What is known is that if these
methodologies take students of this young religion beyond the unsustainable and
alienating dichotomies depicted here, they will no doubt be welcomed by believers and
non-believers alike. In the end, culture wars yield more fire than light…and regardless of
where we find ourselves, all of us are seeking light.

1 Bahá’u’lláh, the formal designation for Mírzá Husayn-‘Alí Núrí (1817-1892), founder of the
Bahá’í Faith.
2 'Abdu'l-Bahá, the formal designation for ‘Abbas Effendi, appointed by Bahá'u'lláh in Kitáb-i-
‘Ahd to serve as leader of the Bahá’í community after his death.
3 Shoghi Effendi, formally designated as “the Guardian”, was appointed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in his
Will and Testament to serve as the leader of the Bahá’í community after his passing, and, in his
stead, to appoint the subsequent “Guardian”. A series of male descendants of Bahá’u’lláh was
envisioned to serve as supreme leaders of the Bahá’ís for the foreseeable future.

\[4\] Universal House of Justice (baytu’l-‘adl umumi) is the “supreme court” of the Bahá’ís, whose
nine male members were elected for the first time in April 1963, five and a half years after the
decease of Shoghi Effendi. While a council of Hands of the Cause governed the Bahá’í
community between the two events, they were not authorized to legislate or elucidate but only to
administer. Hence, it is the communications of the Universal House of Justice which have
continued the function of authoritative interpretation in the context of the Bahá’í community.
This is only valid in that context. Those who are not members of that community are not likely
to regard such elucidations as normative for understanding the intentions of Bahá’u’lláh, or of
'Abdu'l-Bahá or Shoghi Effendi.

18 Imámí Shí’í refers to the Ithná ‘Asharí Shí’í tradition of Islam, which recognizes twelve [ithná
‘asharí in Arabic] Imáms descended from Muhammad through his daughter Fatima, as having
the spiritual authority conferred upon them by Muhammad to interpret the Qur’án, the hadith,
and to provide divine guidance to Muslims after the passing of the Messenger of God. This
tradition of Islam is predominant in Iran, and parts of ‘Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Afghanistan.

62 'Abdu'l-Bahá reiterated this principle in one of his talks: “God sent His Prophets into the world
to teach and enlighten man, to explain to him the mystery of the Power of the Holy Spirit, to
enable him to reflect the Light, and so in his turn, to be the source of guidance to others. The
Heavenly Books, the Bible, the Qur'án, and the other Holy Writings have been given by God as
guides into the paths of Divine virtue, love, justice and peace. Therefore I say unto you that ye
should strive to follow the counsels of these Blessed Books, and so order your lives that ye may,
following the examples set before you, become yourselves the saints of the Most High!” (Paris
Talks, pp. 61-62)

76 Source texts for this Bahá’í doctrine: “Contemplate with thine inward eye the chain of
successive Revelations that hath linked the Manifestation of Adam with that of the Báb. I
testify before God that each one of these Manifestations hath been sent down through the
operation of the Divine Will and Purpose, that each hath been the bearer of a specific Message,
that each hath been entrusted with a divinely-revealed Book and been commissioned to unravel
the mysteries of a mighty Tablet. The measure of the Revelation with which every one of them
hath been identified had been definitely fore-ordained. This, verily, is a token of Our favor unto
them, if ye be of those that comprehend this truth....And when this process of progressive
Revelation culminated in the stage at which His peerless, His most sacred, and exalted
Countenance was to be unveiled to men's eyes, He chose to hide His own Self behind a thousand
veils, lest profane and mortal eyes discover His glory.” (Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings, XXXI (74-75)
“Its teachings revolve around the fundamental principle that religious truth is not absolute but
relative, that Divine Revelation is progressive, not final.” (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order
of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 58) “The Faith of Bahá'u'lláh should indeed be regarded, if we wish to be
faithful to the tremendous implications of its message, as the culmination of a cycle, the final stage
in a series of successive, of preliminary and progressive revelations.” (Shoghi Effendi,
The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 102) “…the fundamental principle which constitutes the
bedrock of Bahá'í belief, the principle that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine
Revelation is orderly, continuous and progressive and not spasmodic or final.” (Shoghi
Effendi, The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 115) “Just as the organic evolution of mankind has
been slow and gradual, and involved successively the unification of the family, the tribe, the city-
state, and the nation, so has the light vouchsafed by the Revelation of God, at various stages in
the evolution of religion, and reflected in the successive Dispensations of the past, been
slow and progressive. Indeed the measure of Divine Revelation, in every age, has been
adapted to, and commensurate with, the degree of social progress achieved in that age by a
constantly evolving humanity.” (Shoghi Effendi, The Promised Day is Come, p. 118) “The first
part of this process was the slow and steady growth of this tree of divine revelation, successively
putting forth its branches, shoots and offshoots, and revealing its leaves, buds and blossoms, as a
direct consequence of the light and warmth imparted to it by a series of progressive
dispensations associated with Moses, Zoroaster, Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad and other
Prophets, and of the vernal showers of blood shed by countless martyrs in their path.” (Shoghi
Effendi, Messages to the Bahá’í World - 1950-1957, p. 153)

77Sources  for this Bahá’í doctrine: “And now regarding His words, that the Son of man shall
"come in the clouds of heaven." By the term "clouds" is meant those things that are contrary to
the ways and desires of men. Even as He hath revealed in the verse already quoted: "As oft as an
Apostle cometh unto you with that which your souls desire not, ye swell with pride, accusing some
of being impostors and slaying others."[Qur'án 2:87] These "clouds" signify, in one sense, the
annulment of laws, the abrogation of former Dispensations, the repeal of rituals and customs
current amongst men, the exalting of the illiterate faithful above the learned opposers of the
Faith.” (Bahá’u’lláh, The Kitáb-i-Íqán, pp. 71-72) “In the days of Moses it was the Pentateuch; in
the days of Jesus the Gospel; in the days of Muhammad the Messenger of God the Qur'án; in this
day the Bayan; and in the dispensation of Him Whom God will make manifest His own Book --
the Book unto which all the Books of former Dispensations must needs be referred, the Book
which standeth amongst them all transcendent and supreme.” (Bahá’u’lláh, The Kitáb-i-Íqán, pp.
199-200)

145 Bahá’u’lláh, The Kitáb-i-Íqán, pp. 86-89:
This is one of the instances that have been referred to. Verily by “perverting” the text is not
meant that which these foolish and abject souls have fancied, even as some maintain that Jewish
and Christian divines have effaced from the Book such verses as extol and magnify the
countenance of Muhammad, and instead thereof have inserted the contrary. How utterly vain
and false are these words! Can a man who believeth in a book, and deemeth it to be inspired by
God, mutilate it? Moreover, the Pentateuch had been spread over the surface of the earth, and
was not confined to Mecca and Medina, so that they could privily corrupt and pervert its text.
Nay, rather, by corruption of the text is meant that in which all Muslim divines are engaged
today, that is the interpretation of God’s holy Book in accordance with their idle imaginings and
vain desires. And as the Jews, in the time of Muhammad, interpreted those verses of the
Pentateuch, that referred to His Manifestation, after their own fancy, and refused to be satisfied
with His holy utterance, the charge of “perverting” the text was therefore pronounced against
them. Likewise, it is clear, how in this day, the people of the Qur’án have perverted the text of
God’s holy Book, concerning the signs of the expected Manifestation, and interpreted it according
to their inclination and desires.

In yet another instance, He saith: “A part of them heard the Word of God, and then,
after they had understood it, distorted it, and knew that they did so.”[Qur’án 2:75] This verse,
too, doth indicate that the meaning of the Word of God hath been perverted, not that the actual
words have been effaced. To the truth of this testify they that are sound of mind.

Again in another instance, He saith: “Woe unto those who, with their own hands,
transcribe the Book corruptly, and then say: ‘This is from God,’ that they may sell it for some
mean price.”[Qur’án 2:79] This verse was revealed with reference to the divines and leaders of
the Jewish Faith. These divines, in order to please the rich, acquire worldly emoluments, and give
vent to their envy and misbelief, wrote a number of treatises, refuting the claims of Muhammad,
supporting their arguments with such evidences as it would be improper to mention, and claimed
that these arguments were derived from the text of the Pentateuch.

The same may be witnessed today. Consider how abundant are the denunciations written
by the foolish divines of this age against this most wondrous Cause! How vain their imaginings
that these calumnies are in conformity with the verses of God’s sacred Book, and in consonance
with the utterances of men of discernment!

Our purpose in relating these things is to warn you that were they to maintain that those
verses wherein the signs referred to in the Gospel are mentioned have been perverted, were they
to reject them, and cling instead to other verses and traditions, you should know that their words
were utter falsehood and sheer calumny. Yea “corruption” of the text, in the sense We have
referred to, hath been actually effected in particular instances. A few of these We have mentioned,
that it may become manifest to every discerning observer that unto a few untutored holy Men
hath been given the mastery of human learning, so that the malevolent opposer may cease to
contend that a certain verse doth indicate “corruption” of the text, and insinuate that We,
through lack of knowledge, have made mention of such things. Moreover, most of the verses that
indicate “corruption” of the text have been revealed with reference to the Jewish people, were ye
to explore the isles of Qur’ánic Revelation.

\[150\] Bahá’í prayer books and in the Prayers and Meditations of Bahá’u’lláh.
151The Bahá’í Fast is a month of 19 days, the month of ‘Ala [Elevation in Arabic], the last month

To all National Spiritual Assemblies
Dear Bahá’í Friends,
Applicability of the Laws and Ordinances of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
On 9 May 1993, each National Spiritual Assembly was sent a copy of a letter written to the
National Spiritual Assembly of Iceland on 9 June 1974, which listed those laws not at that time
binding upon the Western world. The covering letter noted that the law of Huququ’lláh had been
made universally binding at Ridvan 1992. On 28 December 1999, the Universal House of Justice
wrote to the Bahá’ís throughout the world informing them of the universal application of the
remaining aspects of the laws of prayer and fasting.
Therefore, to bring the information up to date, we have been asked to send you the enclosed list

Laws of the Kitáb-I-Aqdas not yet Universally Applied
28 December 1999 Following the universal application of the laws on prayer, fasting and the
recitation of the Greatest Name, the Universal House of Justice has provided the following list of
laws noted in the Synopsis and Codification of the Kitáb-I-Aqdas which are not at present
universally binding upon the friends. The numbers of the sections are given for ease of reference.
IV.C.1.i
The laws governing betrothal.
IV.C.1.J
The law concerning the payment of a dowry by the groom to the bride on marriage.
IV.C.1.1&m
The laws concerning the travelling of a husband away from his wife.
IV.C.1.n&o
The laws relating to the virginity of the wife.
IV.C.2.b
That part of the divorce law relating to fines payable to the house of Justice.
IV.C.3

The law of inheritance. This is normally covered by civil laws of intestacy at the present time.
IV.D.1.a
The law of pilgrimage.
IV.D.1.d
The law of the Mashriqu’l-adhkar is gradually being put into effect.
IV.D.1.f

supplementary legislation necessary for the full implementation of the badi calendar.
IV.D.1.j
The age of maturity applies only to Bahá’í religious duties as yet. On other matters it is subject to
the civil law of each country. The age of administrative maturity in the Bahá’í community has, for
the time being, been fixed at 21.
IV.D.1.k
For the burial of the dead the only requirements now binding in the West are to bury the body
(not to cremate it), not to carry it more than a distance of one hour’s journey from the place of
death, and to say the Prayer for the Dead if the deceased is a believer over the age of 15.

183‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, Chapter 16, pp. 81-86:
A subject that is essential for the comprehension of the questions that we have mentioned, and of
others of which we are about to speak, so that the essence of the problems may be understood, is
this: that human knowledge is of two kinds. One is the knowledge of things perceptible to the
senses—that is to say, things which the eye, or ear, or smell, or taste, or touch can perceive, which
are called objective or sensible. So the sun, because it can be seen, is said to be objective; and in
the same way sounds are sensible because the ear hears them; perfumes are sensible because they
can be inhaled and the sense of smell perceives them; foods are sensible because the palate
perceives their sweetness, sourness or saltness; heat and cold are sensible because the feelings
perceive them. These are said to be sensible realities.
The other kind of human knowledge is intellectual—that is to say, it is a reality of the intellect; it
has no outward form and no place and is not perceptible to the senses. For example, the power of
intellect is not sensible; none of the inner qualities of man is a sensible thing; on the contrary, they
are intellectual realities. So love is a mental reality and not sensible; for this reality the ear does
not hear, the eye does not see, the smell does not perceive, the taste does not discern, the touch
does not feel. Even ethereal matter, the forces of which are said in physics to be heat, light,
electricity and magnetism, is an intellectual reality, and is not sensible. In the same way, nature,
also, in its essence is an intellectual reality and is not sensible; the human spirit is an intellectual,
not sensible reality. In explaining these intellectual realities, one is obliged to express them by
sensible figures because in exterior existence there is nothing that is not material. Therefore, to
explain the reality of the spirit—its condition, its station—one is obliged to give explanations
under the forms of sensible things because in the external world all that exists is sensible. For
example, grief and happiness are intellectual things; when you wish to express those spiritual
qualities you say: “My heart is oppressed; my heart is dilated,” though the heart of man is neither
oppressed nor dilated. This is an intellectual or spiritual state, to explain which you are obliged to
have recourse to sensible figures. Another example: you say, “such an individual made great
progress,” though he is remaining in the same place; or again, “such a one’s position was
exalted,” although, like everyone else, he walks upon the earth. This exaltation and this progress
are spiritual states and intellectual realities, but to explain them you are obliged to have recourse
to sensible figures because in the exterior world there is nothing that is not sensible.
So the symbol of knowledge is light, and of ignorance, darkness; but reflect, is knowledge sensible
light, or ignorance sensible darkness? No, they are merely symbols. These are only intellectual
states, but when you desire to express them outwardly, you call knowledge light, and ignorance
darkness. You say: “My heart was gloomy, and it became enlightened.” Now, that light of

knowledge, and that darkness of ignorance, are intellectual realities, not sensible ones; but when
we seek for explanations in the external world, we are obliged to give them a sensible form.
Then it is evident that the dove which descended upon Christ was not a material dove, but it was
a spiritual state, which, that it might be comprehensible, was expressed by a sensible figure. Thus
in the Old Testament it is said that God appeared as a pillar of fire: this does not signify the
material form; it is an intellectual reality which is expressed by a sensible image.
Christ says, “The Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father.” Was Christ within God, or
God within Christ? No, in the name of God! On the contrary, this is an intellectual state which is
expressed in a sensible figure.
We come to the explanation of the words of Bahá’u’lláh when He says: “O king! I was but a man
like others, asleep upon My couch, when lo, the breezes of the All-Glorious were wafted over Me,
and taught Me the knowledge of all that hath been. This thing is not from Me, but from One
Who is Almighty and All-Knowing.” This is the state of manifestation: it is not sensible; it is an
intellectual reality, exempt and freed from time, from past, present and future; it is an
explanation, a simile, a metaphor and is not to be accepted literally; it is not a state that can be
comprehended by man. Sleeping and waking is passing from one state to another. Sleeping is the
condition of repose, and wakefulness is the condition of movement. Sleeping is the state of silence;
wakefulness is the state of speech. Sleeping is the state of mystery; wakefulness is the state of
manifestation.
For example, it is a Persian and Arabic expression to say that the earth was asleep, and the spring
came, and it awoke; or the earth was dead, and the spring came, and it revived. These expressions
are metaphors, allegories, mystic explanations in the world of signification.
Briefly, the Holy Manifestations have ever been, and ever will be, Luminous Realities; no change
or variation takes place in Their essence. Before declaring Their manifestation, They are silent
and quiet like a sleeper, and after Their manifestation, They speak and are illuminated, like one
who is awake.
184As to the record in the Bible concerning Adam’s entering paradise, His eating from the tree
and His expulsion through the temptation of Satan: These are all symbols beneath which there
are wonderful and divine meanings not to be calculated in years, dates and measurement of time.
Likewise, the statement that God created the heaven and the earth in six days is symbolic. We will
not explain this further today. The texts of the Holy Books are all symbolical, needing
authoritative interpretation. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, pp. 219-220)
We are told in the Holy Scripture that the New Jerusalem shall appear on earth. Now it is evident
that this celestial city is not built of material stones and mortar, but that it is a city not made with
hands, eternal in the Heavens. This is a prophetic symbol, meaning the coming again of the
Divine Teaching to enlighten the hearts of men. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Paris Talks, p. 84)
Behold again, the Christians are expecting the stars to fall and Christ to appear in the clouds, yet
these are but symbols. They are awaiting a Christ from a heaven that does not exist.
Let us awake! Let us acquire a new intelligence in order to interpret the symbols and become
acquainted with the mysteries. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Divine Philosophy, pp. 36-37)
The prophecies deal with dates and symbols which proclaim the end of each dispensation.
(‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Divine Philosophy, p. 43)
This sacred day when the sun illumines equally the whole earth is called the equinox and the
equinox is the symbol of the divine messenger. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Divine Philosophy, p. 74)

The rising of the sun at the equinox is the symbol of life and the human reality is revivified; our
thoughts are transformed and our intelligence is quickened. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Divine Philosophy, p.
74)
“Alas, alas! the world has not discovered the reality of religion hidden beneath the symbolic
forms!”
(‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Divine Philosophy, p. 188)
185 Qur’án III:7 in other translations:
He it is Who has sent down to thee the Book: in it are verses basic or fundamental (of established
meaning); they are the foundation of the Book: others are allegorical. But those in whose hearts is
perversity follow the part there of that is allegorical, seeking discord, and searching for its hidden
meanings, but no one knows its hidden meanings except Allah and those who are firmly grounded
in knowledge say: “We believe in the Book; the whole of it is from our Lord;“ and none will grasp
the Message except men of understanding. (Yusuf Ali)
He it is Who hath revealed unto thee (Muhammad) the Scripture wherein are clear revelations -
they are the substance of the Book - and others (which are) allegorical. But those in whose hearts
is doubt pursue, forsooth, that which is allegorical seeking (to cause) dissension by seeking to
explain it. None knoweth its explanation save Allah. And those who are of sound instruction say:
We believe therein; the whole is from our Lord; but only men of understanding really heed.
(Pickthall)
He it is who hath sent down to thee “the Book.” Some of its signs are of themselves perspicuous; -
these are the basis of the Book - and others are figurative. But they whose hearts are given to err,
follow its figures, craving discord, craving an interpretation; yet none knoweth its interpretation
but God. And the stable in knowledge say, “We believe in it: it is all from our Lord.” But none
will bear this in mind, save men endued with understanding. (Rodwell)
He it is who has revealed to thee the Book, of which there are some verses that are decisive, they
are the mother of the Book; and others ambiguous; but as for those in whose hearts is perversity,
they follow what is ambiguous, and do crave for sedition, craving for (their own) interpretation of
it; but none know the interpretation of it except God. But those who are well grounded in
knowledge say, ‘We believe in it; it is all from our Lord; but none will remember save those who
possess minds. (Palmer)

225Inasmuch as great differences and divergences of denominational belief had arisen throughout
the past, every man with a new idea attributing it to God, Bahá’u’lláh desired that there should
not be any ground or reason for disagreement among the Bahá’ís. Therefore, with His own pen
He wrote the Book of His Covenant, addressing His relations and all people of the world, saying,
“Verily, I have appointed One Who is the Center of My Covenant. All must obey Him; all must
turn to Him; He is the Expounder of My Book, and He is informed of My purpose. All must
turn to Him. Whatsoever He says is correct, for, verily, He knoweth the texts of My Book. Other
than He, no one doth know My Book.” The purpose of this statement is that there should never
be discord and divergence among the Bahá’ís but that they should always be unified and agreed.
In His prayers Bahá’u’lláh also said, “O God! Whosoever violates My Covenant, O God,
humiliate him. Verily, whosoever violates My Covenant, O God, erase and efface him.” In all His
Tablets, among which is the Tablet of the Branch, He has mentioned and explained the attributes
and qualities of the Personage to Whom He referred in the Book of His Covenant. He has fully
expounded the function and potency of that Personage, so that no one shall say, “I understand
this from the writings of Bahá’u’lláh,” for He has appointed the Center, or Expounder, of the
Book. He said, “Verily, He is the appointed one; other than He, there is none,” intending that no
sects or prejudices should be formed, and preventing every man here and there with a new
thought from creating dissension and variance. It is as though a king should appoint a governor-
general. Whosoever obeys him, obeys the king. Whosoever violates and disobeys him, violates the
king. Therefore, whosoever obeys the Center of the Covenant appointed by Bahá’u’lláh has
obeyed Bahá’u’lláh, and whosoever disobeys Him has disobeyed Bahá’u’lláh. It has nothing to do
with Him (Abdu’l-Bahá) at all—precisely as the governor-general appointed by the king—
whosoever obeys the governor-general obeys the king; whosoever disobeys the governor-general
disobeys the king.
Therefore, you must read the Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh. You must read the Tablet of the Branch and
regard that which He has so clearly stated. Beware! Beware! lest anyone should speak from the
authority of his own thoughts or create a new thing out of himself. Beware! Beware! According to
the explicit Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh you should care nothing at all for such a person. Bahá’u’lláh
shuns such souls. I have expounded these things for you, for the conservation and protection of
the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh, in order that you may be informed, lest any souls shall deceive you
and lest any souls shall cause suspicion among you. You must love all people, and yet if any souls
put you in doubt, you must know that Bahá’u’lláh is severed from them. Whosoever works for
unity and fellowship is a servant of Bahá’u’lláh, and Bahá’u’lláh is his assistant and helper. I ask
God that He may cause you to be the very means of agreement and unity, that He may make you
radiant, merciful, heavenly children of the divine Kingdom; that you may advance day by day;
that you may become as bright as these lamps, bestowing light upon all humanity. Salutations and
farewell! (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, pp. 322-324)

Inasmuch as there was no appointed explainer of the Book of Christ, everyone made the claim
to authority, saying, “This is the true pathway and others are not.” To ward off such dissensions
as these and prevent any person from creating a division or sect the Blessed Perfection,
Bahá’u’lláh, appointed a central authoritative Personage, declaring Him to be the expounder of
the Book. This implies that the people in general do not understand the meanings of the Book,
but this appointed One does understand. Therefore, Bahá’u’lláh said, “He is the explainer of
My Book and the Center of My Testament.” In the last verses of the Book instructions are
revealed, declaring that, “After Me,” you must turn toward a special Personage and “whatsoever
He says is correct.” In the Book of the Covenant Bahá’u’lláh declares that by these two verses this
Personage is meant. In all His Books and Tablets He has praised those who are firm in the
Covenant and rebuked those who are not. He said, “Verily, shun those who are shaken in the
Covenant. Verily, God is the Confirmer of the firm ones.” In His prayers He has said, “O God!
Render those who are firm in the Covenant blessed, and degrade those who are not. O God! Be
the Protector of him who protecteth Him, and confirm him who confirms the Center of the
Covenant.” Many utterances are directed against the violators of the Covenant, the purpose
being that no dissension should arise in the blessed Cause; that no one should say, “My opinion is
this”; and that all may know Who is the authoritative expounder and whatsoever He says is
correct. Bahá’u’lláh has not left any possible room for dissension. Naturally, there are some who
are antagonistic, some who are followers of self-desire, others who hold to their own ideas and still
others who wish to create dissension in the Cause. For example, Judas Iscariot was one of the
disciples, yet he betrayed Christ. Such a thing has happened in the past, but in this day the
Blessed Perfection has declared, “This person is the expounder of My Book and all must turn to
Him.” The purpose is to ward off dissension and differences among His followers.
Notwithstanding this safeguard and provision against disagreement, there are certain souls here in
America and a few in ‘Akká who have violated this explicit command. For twenty years these
violators have accomplished nothing. Have they accomplished anything in Chicago? The friends
here must be like the friends in San Francisco. Whenever they sense the least violation from
anyone, they should say, “Begone! You shall not associate with us.” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, The
Promulgation of Universal Peace, pp. 382-383)
There are none who waver in the East, none who oppose the Covenant of God. There is not a
single soul among the Bahá’ís in Persia who is opposed to the Covenant. They are all steadfast. If
any soul wishes to speak in this Cause, they will ask, “Is this a word of your own, or is it by the
authority of the Center of the Covenant? If you have the authority of the Center of the Covenant,
produce it. Where is the letter from Him? Where is His signature?” If he produces the letter, they
will accept it. If he fails to do so, they say, “We cannot accept your words because they emanate
from you only and return to you. We have no command from the Blessed Perfection, Bahá’u’lláh,
to obey you. He has revealed a Book in which He has covenanted with us to obey an appointed
Center of the Covenant. He has not covenanted with us to obey you. Therefore, the statement
you make is rejected. You must furnish proof of your authority and sanction. We are commanded
to turn to one Center. We do not obey various centers. The Blessed Perfection has made a
Covenant with us, and we are holding to this Covenant and Testament. We do not listen to
anything else, for people may arise who speak words of their own, and we are commanded not to
pay attention to them.”
It was not so in former dispensations. Christ, for instance, did not appoint a center of authority
and explanation. He did not say to His followers, “Obey the one whom I have chosen.” Upon
one occasion He asked His disciples, “Whom say ye that I am?” Simon Peter answered and said,
“Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.” Christ, wishing to make firm the faith of Peter,
said, “Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church,” meaning that the faith of Peter
was the true faith. It was a sanction of Peter’s faith. He did not say that all should turn to Peter.

He did not say, “He is the branch extended from my ancient root.” He did not say, “O God!
Bless all who serve Peter. O God! Degrade those who are not obedient to him. Shun him who is a
violator of the Covenant. O God! Thou knowest that I love all who are steadfast in the
Covenant.” This has been revealed, however, in all the Books, Writings and Epistles of
Bahá’u’lláh regarding the appointed Center of the Covenant in this dispensation. Therefore, the
Bahá’í dispensation is distinguished from all others in this fact, the purpose of Bahá’u’lláh being
that no one could arise to cause differences and disunion. After the departure of Christ various
sects and denominations arose, each one claiming to be the true channel of Christianity, but none
of them possessed a written authority from Christ; none could produce proof from Him; yet all
claimed His sanction and approval. Bahá’u’lláh has written a Covenant and Testament with His
own pen, declaring that the One Whom He has appointed the Center of the Covenant shall be
turned to and obeyed by all. Therefore, thank God that Bahá’u’lláh has made the pathway
straight. He has clearly explained all things and opened every door for advancing souls. There is
no reason for hesitation by anyone. The purpose of the Covenant was simply to ward off disunion
and differences so that no one might say, “My opinion is the true and valid one.”
Any opinion expressed by the Center of the Covenant is correct, and there is no reason for
disobedience by anyone. Be watchful, for perchance there may be violators (naqidin) of the
Covenant among you. Do not listen to them. Read the Book of the Covenant. All have been
commanded to obey the Covenant, and the first admonition is addressed to the sons of
Bahá’u’lláh, the Branches: “You must turn to the appointed Center; He is the expounder of the
Book.”
Should any soul so clearly violate and disobey this command, can he even say he is a Bahá’í? If
anyone disobeys the explicit command of Christ, can he truthfully say he is a Christian?
(‘Abdu’l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, pp. 386-387)
226O handmaid of God! It is recorded in the Torah: And I will give you the valley of Achor for a
door of hope. This valley of Achor is the city of ‘Akká, and whoso hath interpreted this
otherwise is of those who know not. (Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, #139, p. 162)
To ensure unity and agreement He has entered into a Covenant with all the people of the world,
including the interpreter and explainer of His teachings, so that no one may interpret or
explain the religion of God according to his own view or opinion and thus create a sect founded
upon his individual understanding of the divine Words. The Book of the Covenant or Testament
of Bahá’u’lláh is the means of preventing such a possibility, for whosoever shall speak from the
authority of himself alone shall be degraded. Be ye informed and cognizant of this. Beware lest
anyone shall secretly question or deny this to you. There are some people of self-will and desire
who do not communicate their intentions to you in clear language. They envelop their meanings
in secret statements and insinuations. For instance, they praise a certain individual, saying he is
wise and learned, that he was glorified in the presence of Bahá’u’lláh, conveying this to you in an
insidious way or by innuendoes. Be ye aware of this! Be awakened and enlightened! For Christ
has said that no one hides the lamp under a bushel. The purport of my admonition is that certain
people will endeavor to influence you in the direction of their own personal views and opinions.
Therefore, be upon your guard in order that none may assail the oneness and integrity of
Bahá’u’lláh’s Cause. Praise be to God! Bahá’u’lláh left nothing unsaid. He explained everything.
He left no room for anything further to be said. Yet there are some who for the sake of personal
interest and prestige will attempt to sow the seeds of sedition and disloyalty among you. To
protect and safeguard the religion of God from this and all other attack, the Center of the
Covenant has been named and appointed by Bahá’u’lláh. Therefore, if anyone should set forth a
statement in praise or recognition of another than this appointed Center, you must ask him to
produce a written proof of the authority he follows. Let him show you a trace from the pen of the

Center of the Covenant Himself, substantiating his praise and support of any other than the
rightful one. Inform him that you are not permitted to accept the words of everyone. Say to him,
“It is possible to love and praise a person today, to accept and follow another tomorrow and still
another next day. Therefore, we cannot afford to listen to this or that individual. Where are your
proofs and writings? Where is your authority from the pen of the Center of the Covenant?”
(‘Abdu’l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 455)
I have attended more meetings in New York than in all the other cities combined. Day and night,
individually and collectively you have listened to the teachings and exhortations of Bahá’u’lláh. I
have proclaimed unto you the glad tidings of the Kingdom of God and explained the wishes of

the humility of servitude. The teachings of Bahá’u’lláh have been clearly interpreted. The time

away in 1107 A.H. It represents his interpretative of the Qur’ánic verse (XVIII:109): "Qul law

walaw ji/na bimithlihi madadan" which Yusuf Ali translates with: "Say: If the ocean were ink

the words of my Lord, even if we added another ocean like it, for its aid."

249‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, #33, pp. 67-68:

O servant of God! We have noted what thou didst write to Jinab-i-Ibn-Abhar, and thy
question regarding the verse: ‘Whoso layeth claim to a Revelation direct from God, ere the
expiration of a full thousand years, such a man is assuredly a lying impostor.’

The meaning of this is that any individual who, before the expiry of a full thousand
years—years known and clearly established by common usage and requiring no interpretation—
should lay claim to a Revelation direct from God, even though he should reveal certain signs, that
man is assuredly false and an impostor.

This is not a reference to the Universal Manifestation, for it is clearly set forth in the Holy
Writings that centuries, nay thousands of years, must pass on to completion, before a
Manifestation like unto this Manifestation shall appear again.

It is possible, however, that after the completion of a full thousand years, certain Holy
Beings will be empowered to deliver a Revelation: this, however, will not be through a Universal
Manifestation. Wherefore every day of the cycle of the Blessed Beauty is in reality equal to one
year, and every year of it is equal to a thousand years.

Consider, for example, the sun: its transit from one zodiacal sign to the next occurreth
within a short period of time, yet only after a long period doth it attain the plenitude of its
resplendency, its heat and glory, in the sign of Leo. It must first complete one full revolution
through the other constellations before it will enter the sign of Leo again, to blaze out in its full
splendour. In its other stations, it revealeth not the fullness of its heat and light.

The substance is, that prior to the completion of a thousand years, no individual may
presume to breathe a word. All must consider themselves to be of the order of subjects, submissive
and obedient to the commandments of God and the laws of the House of Justice. Should any
deviate by so much as a needle’s point from the decrees of the Universal House of Justice, or falter
in his compliance therewith, then is he of the outcast and rejected.

As to the cycle of the Blessed Beauty—the times of the Greatest Name—this is not limited
to a thousand or two thousand years....

When it is said that the period of a thousand years beginneth with the Manifestation of
the Blessed Beauty and every day thereof is a thousand years, the intent is a reference to the cycle
of the Blessed Beauty, which in this context will extend over many ages into the unborn reaches of
time.
250 Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 132:

“Whoso layeth claim to a Revelation direct from God,” is the express warning uttered in the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas, “ere the expiration of a full thousand years, such a man is assuredly a lying
imposter. We pray God that He may graciously assist him to retract and repudiate such claim.
Should he repent, God will no doubt forgive him. If, however, he persists in his error, God will
assuredly send down one who will deal mercilessly with him. Terrible indeed is God in
punishing!” “Whosoever,” He adds as a further emphasis, “interpreteth this verse otherwise than
its obvious meaning is deprived of the Spirit of God and of His mercy which encompasseth all
created things.” “Should a man appear,” is yet another conclusive statement, “ere the lapse of a
full thousand years—each year consisting of twelve months according to the Qur’án, and of
nineteen months of nineteen days each, according to the Bayan—and if such a man reveal to
your eyes all the signs of God, unhesitatingly reject him!”

253‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, #186, pp. 213-214:

The point at issue is clear, direct and of utmost brevity. Either Bahá’u’lláh was wise,
omniscient and aware of what would ensue, or was ignorant and in error. He entered, by His
supreme pen, into such a firm Covenant and Testament with all the Bahá’ís, first with the
Aghsan, the Afnan and His kindred, and commanded them to obey and turn toward Him. By His
supreme pen He hath explicitly declared that the object of the following verse of the Kitáb-i-
Aqdas is the Most Great Branch:

‘When the ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the Book of My Revelation is ended,
turn your faces toward Him Whom God hath purposed, Who hath branched from this Ancient
Root.’ Its meaning briefly is this: that after My ascension it is incumbent upon the Aghsan, the
Afnan and the kindred, and all the friends of God, to turn their faces to Him Who hath branched
from the Ancient Root.

He also plainly saith in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas: ‘O ye people of the world! When the Mystic
Dove will have winged its flight from its Sanctuary of Praise and sought its far-off goal, its hidden
habitation, refer ye whatsoever ye understand not in the Book to Him Who hath branched from
this mighty Stock.’ Addressing all the people of the world He saith: When the Mystic Dove flieth
away from the orchard of praise to the Most Supreme and Invisible Station—that is, when the
Blessed Beauty turneth away from the contingent world towards the invisible realm—refer
whatever ye do not understand in the Book to Him Who hath branched from the Ancient Root.
That is, whatever He saith is the very truth.

And in the Book of the Covenant He explicitly saith that the object of this verse ‘Who
hath branched from this Ancient Root’ is the Most Mighty Branch. And He commandeth all the
Aghsan, the Afnan, the kindred and the Bahá’ís to turn toward Him. Now, either one must say
that the Blessed Beauty hath made a mistake, or He must be obeyed. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá hath no
command for the people to obey save the diffusion of the fragrances of God, the exaltation of His
Word, the promulgation of the oneness of the world of humanity, the establishment of universal
peace, and other of the commands of God. These are divine commands and have nothing to do

with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Whoever wisheth may accept them, and anyone who rejecteth them may do
as he pleaseth.
254 Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 134:

“When the ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the Book of My Revelation is ended,”
proclaims the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, “turn your faces towards Him Whom God hath purposed, Who
hath branched from this Ancient Root.” And again, “When the Mystic Dove will have winged its
flight from its Sanctuary of Praise and sought its far-off goal, its hidden habitation, refer ye
whatsoever ye understand not in the Book to Him Who hath branched from this mighty Stock.”

In the Kitáb-i-’Ahd, moreover, Bahá’u’lláh solemnly and explicitly declares: “It is
incumbent upon the Aghsan, the Afnan and My kindred to turn, one and all, their faces towards
the Most Mighty Branch. Consider that which We have revealed in Our Most Holy Book: ‘When
the ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the Book of My Revelation is ended, turn your faces
toward Him Whom God hath purposed, Who hath branched from this Ancient Root.’ The object
of this sacred verse is none other except the Most Mighty Branch (Abdu’l-Bahá). Thus have We
graciously revealed unto you our potent Will, and I am verily the Gracious, the All-Powerful.”

Carrigan, Jackson Armstong-Ingram, and Juan R. I. Cole, authors, "The Service of Women on
the Institutions of the Bahá’í Faith," paper written in 1988, published on h-bahai as Documents
on the Shaykhi, Babi and Bahá’í Movements, Vol. 3, No. 2 (May, 1999). Much of the
information on this topic is derived from this paper. The establishment of the House of Justice, in
Iran and in the United States, is described here:
"Although the Kitáb-i-Aqdas was revealed in 'Akka in 1873, it was withheld for some time by
Bahá’u’lláh before it was distributed to the Bahá’ís of Iran.[Synopsis, pp. 5-6] It appears that it
was not until around 1878 that the Bahá’ís of Tehran received copies of the book and began to
implement some of its laws in their personal lives. Upon reading the Kitáb-i Aqdas, Mirza
Asadu'llah Isfahani, a prominent Bahá’í teacher living in Tehran, was particularly struck by the

command of Bahá’u’lláh that a House of Justice should be established by the Bahá’ís in every city.
Mirza Asadu'llah is an important figure in Bahá’í history: he eventually married the sister of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá's wife; he was (as we shall see) one of the earliest Bahá’í teachers sent to America by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá to instruct the new Western believers and he later accompanied ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on
his travels in Europe. In any case, in 1878 he was the first to undertake the organization of a local
House of Justice in Iran. He took the initiative to invite eight other prominent believers to form a
body, responding to the laws of the Kitáb-i Aqdas, which they referred to as bayt al-'adl (House of
Justice) or bayt al-a'zam
(the Most Great House). The organization of this first House of Justice was kept a secret, even
from the believers. However, it met sporadically in the home of Mirza Asadu'llah for a couple of
years. After consulting with this body, the prominent Bahá’í men who had been invited to attend
its meetings would seek to take action as individual Bahá’í teachers that would implement its
decisions.
Around 1881, the Tehran House of Justice was reorganized and more members were added. The
House adopted a written constitution and pursued its activities with more organization and vigour
than before. The constitution mandated, however, that the meetings remain strictly confidential,
hidden from the body of the believers. This constitution also assumes that the members of the
House would all be men (aqayan). Naturally, considering the social conditions in Iran at the time,
no other arrangement was possible.
“Some of the minutes of this early House of Justice survive today. It was a gathering of the older
and more prominent Bahá’í men of Tehran. Meetings were attended by invitation only, and at
times included fourteen members or more. Eventually, this meeting came to be called the
Consultative Gathering (majlis-i shur), while the house where the body met was referred to as the
House of Justice (bayt al-'adl). These meetings sought to assist and protect the Bahá’ís through
consultation on various problems. The House in Tehran sent Bahá’í teachers to other cities in
Iran to organize Houses of Justice there. Again, the decisions of the House were always carried
out by individuals, and the consultations remained secret. The organization of this body
eventually met with some controversy. One important Bahá’í teacher, Jamal-i Burujurdi, who
later - in the time of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá - would become a notorious Covenant-breaker, objected
strongly to the organization of a House of Justice in Tehran. Because of these objections, the
Bahá’ís involved on the House appealed to Bahá’u’lláh for guidance. Bahá’u’lláh replied with a
Tablet in which He approved of the House of Justice and strongly upheld the principle of
consultation in the Bahá’í Faith.” [All information in this section concerning the first House of
Justice of Tehran is based on Ruhu'llah Mihrabkhani, Mahafil-i shur dar 'ahd-i Jamal-i Aqdas-i
Abha, (Assemblies of consultation at the time of Bahá’u’lláh) in Payam-i Bahá’í, nos. 28 and 29,
pp 9-11 and pp 8-9 respectively.]
263In this paper, the following four passages are cited, which describe women as "rijal" in this
Dispensation:
Today the Bahá’í women (lit., the leaves of the Holy Tree) must guide the handmaidens of the
earth to the Lofty Horizon with the utmost purity and sanctity. Today the handmaidens of God
are regarded as gentlemen (rijal). Blessed are they! Blessed are they! (Bahá’u’lláh, cited in Ahmad
Yazdani, Mabadiy-i Ruhani, Tehran: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 104 Badi', p 109.
Today whoever among the handmaidens attains the knowledge of the Desire of the World [i.e.,
Bahá’u’lláh] is considered a gentleman (rajul) in the Divine Book. (Ibid.)
...many a man (rajul) hath waited expectant for God's Revelation, and yet when the Light shone
forth from the horizon of the world, all but a few turned their faces away from it. Whosoever from
amongst the handmaidens hath recognized the Lord of all Names is recorded in the Book as one

of those men (rijal) by the Pen of the Most High. (Bahá’u’lláh, cited in Women: Extracts from the
Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi, and the Universal House of Justice, comp.
by The Research Department of the Universal House of Justice, Thornhill, Ont.: Bahá’í Canada
Publications, 1986, #7, p 3)
Verily, according to Bahá’u’lláh, women are judged as gentlemen (rijal). (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, cited in

do not understand in the Book to Him Who hath branched from the Ancient Root. That is,
whatever He saith is the very truth.

And in the Book of the Covenant He explicitly saith that the object of this verse ‘Who
hath branched from this Ancient Root’ is the Most Mighty Branch. And He commandeth all the
Aghsan, the Afnan, the kindred and the Bahá’ís to turn toward Him. Now, either one must say
that the Blessed Beauty hath made a mistake, or He must be obeyed. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá hath no
command for the people to obey save the diffusion of the fragrances of God, the exaltation of His
Word, the promulgation of the oneness of the world of humanity, the establishment of universal
peace, and other of the commands of God. These are divine commands and have nothing to do
with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Whoever wisheth may accept them, and anyone who rejecteth them may do
as he pleaseth.

Now some of the mischief-makers, with many stratagems, are seeking leadership, and in
order to reach this position they instil doubts among the friends that they may cause differences,
and that these differences may result in their drawing a party to themselves. But the friends of
God must be awake and must know that the scattering of these doubts hath as its motive personal
desires and the achievement of leadership.

Do not disrupt Bahá’í unity, and know that this unity cannot be maintained save through
faith in the Covenant of God.

In this passage, Bahá’u’lláh points out that all Muslims believe that Muhammad is the last of the
prophets, citing the fortieth verse of the Qur’án's thirty-third chapter, while ignoring or
misinterpreting the forty-seventy verse of that same chapter, which promises "attainment unto the
divine Presence". He proceeds to explain, in Kitáb-i-Íqán (pp. 169-170) and in Epistle to the Son

of the Wolf (pp. 115-118, 153, 172) the meaning of this promise, and the impossibility of the
cessation of Revelation or of the institution of Prophethood.
