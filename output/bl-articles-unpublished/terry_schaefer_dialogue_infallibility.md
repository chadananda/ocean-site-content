                               Dialogue on Infallibility
by Peter Terry

A response to “Infallible Institutions?“

by Udo Schaefer

first published in Bahá'í Studies Review vol. 9 (2000)

and later published in Reason and Revelation: Studies in the Babi and Bahá'í Religions (2002)

FOREWORD

Dr. Udo Schaefer first set forth his understanding of the limited infallibility of the
Universal House of Justice in Desinformation als Methode (published in German in 1995),
translated into English as Making the Crooked Straight (and published in 2000 by George
Ronald Press). I was asked to write a review of the English translation for the Journal of
Bahá’í Studies and this was published in volume 10, issues 3 and 4, later the same year. A
fuller articulation of this theme by Dr. Schaefer was published in the Bahá’í Studies Review,
volume 9, in 2000, and this was reprinted with a few modifications in Reason and
Revelation: Studies in the Babi and Bahá’í Religions, volume 13, in 2002 by Kalimat Press. This
paper has been written in response to the revised (second) published version of Dr.
Schaefer’s thesis. All citations in his voice can be found in exactly the same words in this
version (including all the footnotes). In the long version of this paper I respond to his
thesis in its entirety, while the concluding portion of the dialogue was selected for
presentation to the Association for Bahá’í Studies conference in 2006. As Dr. Schaefer and I
are long-standing friends, I have treated this to the best of my ability as a personal
conversation, with his presentation of his views, and me responding to them. [Peter Terry,
2006]

The entirety of Schaefer’s “Infallible Institutions?”, which is available online at
http://bahai-library.com/schaefer_infallible_institutions , has been included. It is the text
highlighted in grey.

Dialogue on Infallibility                 (article by Udo Schaefer, comments by Peter Terry)

PART ONE:

Infallibility Defined and Depicted
Reason ('aql) has been called "the first and foremost" among the "favours, which the
Almighty hath conferred upon men,"[2] however, it is not an infallible source of
knowledge,[3] and is "liable to err."[4] All human thought must be prefaced with St. Jerome's
dictum errare human est.[5] "Mortal man is prone to err", says Bahá'u'lláh.[6] The question
then arises whether there is anything that could unreservedly be called truth, whether
there is any infallible source of truth.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Bahá’u’lláh discuss human knowledge in great detail, and ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá in particular delineates the processes whereby human beings can attain to certain
knowledge, indeed, to infallible knowledge. While reason is a fallible instrument of
knowledge, the combination of reason with empirical, intuitive and revealed knowledge
can lead to certain truth. Infallible knowledge is within the scope of the individual human
being. To begin any discussion of infallibility with a denial of this potential is to render all
subsequent discussion useless, for if the human being is unable attain to perfect truth, then
there is really no point in searching for it.
Revealed religion is inseparably associated with a claim to truth. If it is the Word of God
that is proclaimed, it cannot be but truth, and, indeed, all the prophets claimed to be the
"straight Path of Truth."[7] The Qur'án is "a guidance to the God-fearing,"[8] by which "the
right way [is] made distinct from error"[9]: "Nay, we hurl the truth at falsehood, and it shall
smite it, and lo! it shall vanish."[10] To the Bahá'ís Bahá'u'lláh is "the living Book who
proclaimeth the Truth", his message "a Truth [which is] not overtaken by error."[11] His
book "that judged between truth and falsehood,"[12] is the divine standard of all morality,
the "essence of justice,"[13] the "infallible balance."[14]
The Manifestation of God is infallible, and this has been stated unequivocally in the
Bahá’í Writings. Likewise, the revealed Book has been called the infallible proof and the
infallible balance, as you have noted. Bahá’u’lláh has also invested His chosen one,

Dialogue on Infallibility                 (article by Udo Schaefer, comments by Peter Terry)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá with infallibility, insofar that whatsoever this chosen one says is an
extension of His own infallibility. This is stipulated in the Kitab-i-Aqdas and the Kitab-i-
‘Ahd. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá transferred this infallibility to His chosen one, and conferred the same
extension of His own infallibility upon Shoghi Effendi, and upon the line of Guardians
which were provided for, if certain conditions were met, in His Will and Testament. And
finally, Bahá’u’lláh has declared the House of Justice to be infallible, that is, protected from
error, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi have likewise reiterated that the House of
Justice is protected from error, while ‘Abdu’l-Bahá indicated that it is the Universal House
of Justice rather than every local and intermediary (secondary) House of Justice which is
accorded this protection, and Shoghi Effendi wrote that the infallibility of the Universal
House of Justice is attached to its legislative function, inasmuch as this Institution is
depicted as primarily legislative in the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and in the
letters of Shoghi Effendi. In the Bahá’í Faith, no separation can be made between the
infallibility of the Manifestation and the infallibility of the revealed Book; nor between
these and the infallibility of the chosen one; nor between these and the infallibility of the
chosen one’s chosen one; nor between these and the infallibility of the Universal House of
Justice.
Under the premise of faith that he is the "mediator between God and men"[15] and has
come with the truth, the messenger must be considered an infallible source of knowledge.
This is a logical conclusion. Referring to the Gospel of St. John,[16] Christian theology
claimed for Jesus Christ not only infallibility but even omniscience.[17] In Islamic dogmatics
the doctrine of 'isma was developed according to which immunity from error and sin is
ascribed to the prophets.[18] Whereas the term "infallibility" does not occur in the sacred
writings of the past, neither in the Bible nor in the Qur'án, Bahá'u'lláh has dealt with this
subject explicitly and, as I will explain below, confirmed infallibility as an inherent
attribute of the Manifestation of God.
Christians are not in agreement regarding the infallibility of Jesus Christ, nor the
inerrancy of the Gospels, the Book of Revelation, the Epistles and the Book of Acts. While
traditional Catholics and evangelical Protestants believe in the infallibility of Jesus Christ
and in the inerrancy of the New Testament, and most also believe in the inerrancy of the
Old Testament as well, for over two hundred years there have been doubts raised about
these doctrinal positions, and at this point in time probably the majority of those who
consider themselves to be believing Christians are not confident that either Jesus or the
texts associated with Him are inerrant. While the Roman Catholic Church has repudiated
the claims made in a recently published novel and the movie based on that novel, this has
not led to the burning of books or to picketing in front of cinemas. In Islamic tradition the

Dialogue on Infallibility                (article by Udo Schaefer, comments by Peter Terry)

word of the prophet Muhammad, whether revealed in the Qur’an, or recorded in the
hadith, is almost universally believed to be inerrant. The very suggestion that there were
“satanic verses” mixed in with divine verses in the Qur’an, which occurred in a novel
written by an author of Muslim heritage was offensive enough to many Muslims to
provoke widespread calls for his assassination. This happened only a decade ago. The
depiction of the prophet Muhammad as a terrorist with a bomb for a turban by a
cartoonist sparked rage, rioting, and calls for jihad and boycotting the West. While Sunnis
do not extend their reverence for the prophet Muhammad, the Qur’an and the hadith to
the prophet’s descendants, Shi’is revere not only Muhammad but also His descendants
through His daughter Fatimih and her husband ‘Ali Ibn Abi Talib—for Imami Shi’is the
twelve Imams, and for Isma’ili Shi’is the seven Imams. While the specific term [‘ismat],
which has been translated with “infallibility” is not found either in the Bible or in the
Qur’an, the concept associated with this term, that of the inerrancy of the word of the
prophet of God is certainly found abundantly in both the Bible and the Qur’an, and in the
hadith of the prophet as well as the hadith of the Imams. While Bahá’u’lláh certainly
elaborated on and clarified this concept in some of His Writings, including the Ishraqat,
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá further expounded upon these clarifications in Some Answered
Questions and certain Tablets, nevertheless, the concept is an ancient one and has served
as the foundation stone for religious authority for millennia.
However, the claim to infallibility has been also raised for two institutions of the
community: the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice. According to the holy
texts both are explicitly "freed from all error"[19]: "Whatsoever they decide is of God[20] ...
God will verily inspire them with whatsoever He willeth."[21] Whereas infallibility is an
essential attribute of the Manifestation who occupies an ontologically higher station in the
hierarchy of creation than human beings and is endowed with innate knowledge, those
individuals who serve in these two institutions are human beings. The charisma[22] of
infallibility has been conferred on the institution (not on the persons in office). To secular
thought the concept of conferred infallibility has become untenable and unacceptable. In the
age of "fallibilism,"[23] "infallibility is an obsolete claim."[24] Moreover, the concept is
historically burdened, it conjures up all sorts of negative connotations, provokes fierce
rejection and is regarded as an expression of human presumptuousness and hubris, a sign
of antiquated thinking.
There is no explicit textual justification for associating what Bahá’u’lláh calls the Most
Great Infallibility (Ishraqat, Kitab-i-Aqdas) and what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá calls essential
infallibility (Some Answered Questions) with a superior ontological station. Indeed, the
Manifestation of God, Who is uniquely endowed with this superlative degree of

Dialogue on Infallibility                 (article by Udo Schaefer, comments by Peter Terry)

infallibility, is a human being during His earthly sojourn, and has a human rational soul
which survives this terrestrial life, and were this infallibility to be associated only with the
superhuman, then He could not be invested with it. Bahá’u’lláh conferred what ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá called [‘ismat-i-s.ifatiyyih], what has been translated as “conferred infallibility” upon
His chosen one, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá extended that “conferred infallibility” to the first and
potential subsequent Guardians of the Faith. Bahá’u’lláh does not command His followers
to adhere to some of what His chosen one says and to feel free to regard other things that
chosen one says as optional and of purely human origin. This is to introduce a breach in
the authority of the chosen one that, once opened, cannot be closed. It is like the opening
of Pandora’s box. The Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá does not say that in some
things the Guardian is infallible and in others he is fallible. It was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Who
defined the parameters of His own infallibility, and He alone was invested by Bahá’u’lláh
with both the authority and the infallible judgment to be able to define such parameters.
Likewise, it was Shoghi Effendi who defined the parameters of his own infallibility, and of
the infallibility of future Guardians.

While Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi delineated the parameters of the
infallibility of the Universal House of Justice, there were many specifics which were to be
worked out, and those have been settled by the only individual or institution which has
either the authority or the protection from error to make such determinations, namely, the
Universal House of Justice itself. The Constitution and letters of the Universal House of
Justice set forth a number of these parameters in detail. Among the parameters of the
infallibility of the Universal House of Justice set forth by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Will and
Testament and the Guardian in various letters is that the institution’s decisions are
protected from error, without the members of that institution being extended that same
protection. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes, “Should any of the members commit a sin, injurious to
the common weal, the guardian of the Cause of God hath at his own discretion the right to
expel him, whereupon the people must elect another one in his stead.” There is no such
separation between the institution of the Guardianship and the person of the Guardian,
and there is no provision set forth anywhere in the Bahá’í Writings for the removal of a
Guardian. From this very silence we may infer that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the Guardian, while
not endowed with the prophetic nature, nor with the Most Great Infallibility, were
nevertheless protected from error in all things pertaining to their service to the Cause
except in such things as they clearly identified as exempted from this protection. For
example, the Guardian indicated that his infallibility did not encompass knowledge of
science, of history, of economics or of other matters not pertaining to the Cause. He also
affirmed that his translations were not perfect and that perfect translations were not
possible. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá did not claim to have infallible knowledge of all historical events,
but rather, in the case of one historical account, He related what was reported to Him
rather than stating unequivocally that such and such actually happened.

This raises a pertinent question, of whether it is for the subject to define himself or for
the observers of the subject to define him. Bahá’u’lláh affirmed in a number of His Tablets
that it is impossible to understand the Manifestation of God if we evaluate Him in the light
of human knowledge; He was even more specific, in saying that we could only recognize
Him if we were to see Him through His eyes; and also He stated that He should be judged
according to His own proofs rather than through the proofs of others. Time and time again
He offered to demonstrate the truth of His claims in any way an observer should request.
He rejected the characterizations of His motives, His knowledge, His station, His behavior
by others, be they believers (such as those who believed that He was God incarnate) or
unbelievers (such as those who regarded Him as an enemy of the State), and insisted that
all observers familiarize themselves with Him personally, and with His Writings. In the
Kitab-i-Aqdas, He wrote that during His lifetime any question should be asked of Him,
and that after He would no longer be accessible in the flesh, all should turn to His Writings
and seek to understand His teachings through those Writings; and in another verse He
said that after His passing, all should turn to His chosen one. He does not encourage each
one to come to his own opinions, but rather that everyone who sought to know Him
should follow His instructions on how to know Him, and those instructions were very
specific and called for all to immerse themselves in His Writings and to follow His chosen
one. In Bahá’u’lláh’s case it is clear that it is the subject who defines himself, not his
observer.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá seems to have adopted the very same attitude. His followers and well-
wishers liked to think of Him as the return of Jesus, as a prophet of God, as invested with
the same divine nature as His Father, but He insisted, in Tablet after Tablet and talk after
talk that He was not the return of Jesus, that He was not a prophet of God, that He did not
have the same nature as His Father, that He was the servant of Bahá’u’lláh. In Some
Answered Questions He carefully distinguishes between the prophetic station of the
Manifestation, such as that of Jesus, and the subordinate station of the human being, such
as that of TERRY. Much has been written about the mysterious nature and station of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and it would not be seemly to portray Him as a normal human being in
view of what the Guardian wrote about Him. Nevertheless, as the Guardian also pointed
out, it is erroneous to consider ‘Abdu’l-Bahá a Manifestation of God, and this is precisely
what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote and said to any who would listen and many who would not. He
also stated that He was appointed by Bahá’u’lláh as the infallible interpreter of the Faith,
that all Bahá’ís should turn to Him to answer questions and resolve disputes, that nobody
had the right to contradict Him and that anyone who contradicted Him was not an
obedient follower of Bahá’u’lláh. We must recall that during His ministry, there were
many self-described believers who argued with each other rather than turning to Him to
resolve their disputes; and that prominent believers such as Jamal-i-Burujirdi and G.I.
Kheirallah contradicted Him. Did He respond to these behaviors with laisse faire
liberalism, with do your own thing relativism? No, He reiterated as often as was necessary

that it was for Him to define His own station and nature, and to define the meaning of the
Bahá’í teachings and laws, not for every Tom Dick and Harry to weigh in and insist that he
was right and another was wrong. Those who contradicted Him were ultimately expelled
from the community, and a greater shame for a true believer is inconceivable. I think it is
apparent by now that, in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s case, it is the subject who defined himself, not the
observer.

The same principle applies to Shoghi Effendi and to the Universal House of Justice.

Herein lie the limitations of empiricism, reason, tradition and intuition—each in its own
domain is assumed to be the standard by which all things can be weighed, and
consequently the individual scientist, philosopher, theologian and mystic sincerely
believes himself capable of determining the truth about anything and everything. Because
of the differences in human perception from person to person, this inevitably generates a
universal disjointedness and disharmony and beyond this, there is often inconsistency in
the perception of even the individual person, leading to a proliferation of constantly
fluctuating perceptions…and no truth. When we accept that the subject is defining his
own reality, then it is much easier for us to perceive that reality accurately, for then we can
apply our human standards, our empirical, rational, traditional and intuitive measures to
decoding the narrative given by the subject about himself. Then we are focused on coming
to know how he sees himself, and since he objectively knows more about himself than any
or all of us know about him, this is the only way for our process to become collaborative,
for us to be able to share the journey of discovery, and for it to yield authentic fruit. For
any other process will lead to fragmentation of effort on the one hand and to strange fruit
on the other hand.

In western thought infallibility is closely associated with the Catholic church and its
disputed dogma of papal infallibility, which was promulgated by the first Vatican council
in 1870 under the Pontificate of Pius IX.[25] The dogma[26] defines the Roman bishop to be
infallible if he takes a final decision in matters of doctrine or morals and speaks ex
cathedra,[27] i.e. in performance of his teaching office (magisterium). The dogma of papal
infallibility was accepted by the Council after many disputes, with the result that a major
splinter-group, made up mainly of German bishops, left the Catholic church and founded
their own church, the so-called "Old Catholics". The term is still controversial in Catholic
theology. Hans Küng has written a sizeable book[28] on this subject in which he radically
contests this dogma. The discussion among Catholic theologians on this issue continues
and the Curia has been unable to silence the voices of dissidents. Today the concept of
infallibility is discredited, inasmuch as a significant number of Christian theologians do
not even ascribe infallibility to Christ, since he is presumed to have erred with regard to
the question of parousia. Hans Küng has coined a formula for a wide-spread conviction
among Catholics: "Nemo infallibis nisi Deus ipse" ["No one is infallible save God"].

The mood of the Church seems to have shifted in favor of infallibility and in general
towards the traditional line of Church doctrine and practice. Pope John Paul II was in
many regards a conservative, a traditionalist, and we can be sure that it was this Pope,
along with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, his appointed Prefect of the Sacred Congregation
for the Doctrine of the Faith, and now Pope Benedict XVI, who censored Hans Kung in
1979, resulting in his being banned from teaching Catholic dogma at Tubingen University
for the duration of his career. I don’t think Kung is nearly as popular or as highly regarded
among Roman Catholics as Dr. Schaefer alleges. While it may indeed be impossible to
silence the voices of dissidents, this does not indicate that either the leadership or the rank
and file of the Faith agree with those dissidents. The same could be said of dissidents,
particularly ex-Bahá’ís who have been the most outspoken critics of infallibility in the
Bahá’í Faith—they do not represent the consensus of the intellectuals, nor of the
leadership, nor of the mass of the believers. They are dissidents, pure and simple, and
there are always dissidents in every religious community. While Dr. Schaefer is certainly
better informed than I about the Roman Catholic theologians of his native Europe, I would
point out that the fastest growing and arguably the largest active denominations in the
United States, a society with much more religious life to it than any contemporary
European society, are conservative and traditionalist in orientation, and all of these
denominations affirm the inerrancy of the revealed Word of God, that is, of the Bible, from
Genesis to the Book of Revelation. While academic and liberal theologians and professors
of religion have been challenging the doctrine of inerrancy for over 200 years, it continues
to resonate powerfully with Christian believers and their pastoral leadership.

In the sceptical climate of western societies, infallibility is a concept that is virtually
impossible to impart; that of conferred infallibility is even more difficult to explain. Indeed,
this concept cannot be validated through rational argumentation. Nevertheless, it ought to
be possible to demonstrate that the idea of conferred infallibility is not necessarily
irrational under the premise of religious faith. In order to do so, however, it would be
necessary to clarify this notion in a critical discourse. We will only be able to avoid the
accusation of superstition if we manage to show that the infallibility of the institutions is
not a magical element in the Bahá'í system but rather something that is reasonable and
acceptable for those who believe in the revelation of Bahá'u'lláh.

While it is indubitably true that Western secular culture and its exponents firmly reject
any notion of infallibility whatsoever, thoroughly convinced in the humanity of every
humanly accessible source of knowledge and authority and in the equal rights of every

human being to possess, articulate and act in accordance with whatever convictions he or
she may choose as long as these convictions and their possession, articulation or
actualization do not in any way encroach upon the equal rights of their fellows, it is also
true that this culture rejects other fundamental principles of religious economy on similar
or identical grounds, and will continue to do so no matter what efforts are made to
persuade them otherwise. There is no way to convince a secularist, an agnostic or an
atheist in the validity of infallibility, be it inherent infallibility or conferred infallibility.
However, the opposition of the secularist to infallibility is not the inevitable result of
applying reason or empirical method. Rather it is the result of the imposition of a set of
prejudices, of a set of circumscribing values that simply will not permit the consideration
of this concept, relegating it rather to the dustbin of history, to the medieval and the
retrograde, to ancient and unenlightened processes of human thought, conviction and
behavior. As Pope John Paul II has demonstrated eloquently in his “Fides et Ratio”, the
teachings of divine revelation and beyond them the articles of religious faith are perfectly
in harmony with reason, and can be “validated through rational argumentation”. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá had great confidence in the rational proofs for the existence of God, as well as in the
rational proofs of prophethood, and rational proofs of the immortality of the soul. Indeed,
this is one of the ways in which religion is compatible with and indeed validated by
science and reason, because, from a Bahá’í point of view, the intellect is capable of
discerning reality. It is only that the unassisted intellect may fail to discern reality, but the
same is true for the unassisted senses, the unassisted knowledge of tradition and the
unassisted intuition. Any part of the human psyche may fail to discern reality, but it is also
true that any part of the human psyche may arrive at reality. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has shown that
it is reasonable to affirm the existence of God. We may likewise demonstrate that it is
reasonable to affirm the existence of innate and conferred infallibility, but Dr. Schaefer is
correct that this has yet to be done, at least by a Bahá’í writer and in a Western context.
Until it is essayed, we cannot say that it positively can or cannot be accomplished. It is
only clear that it can be accomplished in potential. Inasmuch though that the Universal
House of Justice is an institution for humankind and not merely for Bahá’ís, it should be
possible to rationally demonstrate the conferred infallibility of the Universal House of
Justice not merely to the satisfaction of the Bahá’í but also to the non-believer. That no
Bahá’í has yet done so as far as we know is no proof that it cannot be done. I will make an
attempt to do so in the course of this paper.

In this critical discourse the discussion of the immanent limits of conferred infallibility
would be of crucial significance. The idea that the Universal House of Justice is invested
with unlimited infallibility leads to untenable and unacceptable consequences.
Unfortunately, experience has shown that in the Bahá'í community a critical discussion on
this subject is not an easy thing – too strong are the convictions of many that Bahá'u'lláh's

assurance, "Whatever they decide is of God,"[29] is valid for absolutely every kind of
decision, the Bahá'í community thus being in possession of a kind of oracle that can be
consulted and from whom the community gets infallible guidance in all matters.

The beliefs of individual Bahá’ís do not constitute evidence of the meanings intended by
the Authors of the Bahá’í sacred writings or the perceptions and judgments of Bahá’í
institutions. As David Piff has powerfully demonstrated in his book entitled “Bahá’í Lore”,
individual Bahá’ís cherish many beliefs which are without textual support. Why precisely
is it that “the idea that the Universal House of Justice is invested with unlimited
infallibility leads to untenable and unacceptable consequences”? I would submit that this
idea is, in itself, one of the many beliefs that is without textual support. What is under
discussion here, in Dr. Schaefer’s paper and in my response to that paper are the
parameters of the infallibility of the Universal House of Justice, not a popular belief in the
absence of any parameters. It might be noted that in some respects the Manifestation of
God, His chosen ones, and the Universal House of Justice as well function as a kind of
oracle, inasmuch as the ancient Greeks turned to the oracle, or rather to the sibylla
(prophetess) who was believed to inhabit the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, whenever they
had insoluble problems which needed to be resolved and which they believed to require
the intervention of the divinities. Roman Catholics have consulted the saints in prayer and
in visions at various locations in the sacred geography of Christendom. Millions of
Muslims have turned to the shrines of their Sufi saints and to their living marabouts, pirs
and khwajah for guidance in undertakings they did not dare to settle for themselves. That
Bahá’ís have turned to Bahá’u’lláh, to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, to Shoghi Effendi, and that they
continue to turn to these three persons in prayer is neither surprising nor abnormal, and
that they should turn also to the Universal House of Justice with the hope of this
institution resolving their doubts, answering their questions and guiding their paths is
also unacceptional. However, the Universal House of Justice does not give “infallible
guidance in all matters”, nor does it claim to do so. Its claims to infallibility, and the claims
advanced by its authors and expounders are specific and limited. Nevertheless, the
community of believers may well conceive of the Universal House of Justice as a kind of
oracle, inasmuch as its decisions are believed to be divinely inspired and protected from
error. In ancient Greek culture, only the pronouncements of the oracle were endowed with
that character. And in Roman Catholic tradition that character has been reserved to the
Church, even as in popular Islam it has been reserved to the Sufi masters and saints. In
Bahá’í culture the channel of divine guidance is not closed or abolished, it is shifted to two
complementary institutions—the chosen ones of Bahá’u’lláh (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Shoghi
Effendi) in the role of “mubayyin” (interpreter, expounder) and the Universal House of
Justice in the role of legislator, elucidator, and court of final appeal.

PART TWO:

Dialogue About Infallibility of the Universal House of Justice

As Shoghi Effendi himself has clarified the extent of his infallibility as Guardian and
formulated its immanent limitations, the focus of this article is on the Universal House of
Justice: does its infallibility operate unlimitedly with the result that absolutely every
decision is covered by it? Or, if this question is to be answered in the negative, what
exactly is the scope of its infallibility?

Indeed, Shoghi Effendi has described the parameters of his infallibility as Guardian of
the Cause, and he has also described the parameters of the infallibility of the Universal
House of Justice. In other words, any consideration of the parameters of the infallibility of
the Universal House of Justice must depend upon the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh and the
interpretations based on those Writings and protected from error under the influence of
divine guidance by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi. Inasmuch as these sources indicate
that the Universal House of Justice is protected from error, we may also have confidence
that it has or will elucidate the parameters of its own infallibility, and hence its writings on
this subject must be carefully examined.

At the outset we have to elucidate the concept of the "essential infallibility" of the
messengers of God, but it is beyond the scope of this article to deal with this issue
comprehensively. I will neither discuss the issue of omniscience,[30] nor will I go into
details (e.g., the question as to whether references in the holy texts to facts or historical
events[31] are infallible statements), nor will I discuss the nature of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's
infallibility.[32]

The infallibility of the Universal House of Justice is founded upon the bedrock of the
“essential infallibility” of the Manifestations of God, and also upon the “conferred
infallibility” of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi. An demonstration of the rational merits
of these three cases of infallibility is indispensable to the construction of a reasonable
argument in favor of the infallibility of the Universal House of Justice. Each of these three
cases is discussed in a separate monograph and will not be repeated here.

The issue of institutional infallibility has already been the subject of a discussion in the
context of the refutation of the confused and blatantly erroneous accusations by a
covenant-breaker.[33] An English edition of this rebuttal[34] has meanwhile been published
by George Ronald under the title Making the Crooked Straight: A Contribution to Bahá'í
Apologetics (Oxford: George Ronald, 2000) to which I refer.[35] The present article contains
some further arguments.

Dr. Schaefer, and his co-authors, Dr. Towfigh and Mr. Gollmer have written a brilliant
rebuttal to the spurious claims of Mr. Francesco Ficicchia. Written in German and entitled
“Desinformation als Methode” (1995), this volume may be regarded as the most
comprehensive and systematic apologetic work in defense of the Bahá’í Faith in any
Western language, rivaling the Kitab al-Fara’id of Mirza Abu’l-Fadl Gulpaygani,
published in Arabic in Cairo over a century ago (1898). In this paper Dr. Schaefer has
expanded upon his views on the infallibility of the Universal House of Justice which were
first set forth in a chapter of this volume. In my review of “Making the Crooked Straight”,
published in the “Journal of Bahá’í Studies” (volume X, numbers 3-4, 2001), my only
reservation in praising this work was with Dr. Schaefer’s thesis regarding the infallibility
of the Universal House of Justice.

"Infallibility" ('isma)[36] is a complex term which has, according to Bahá'u'lláh,
"numerous meanings and diverse stations."[37] In one sense (in that of immaculacy) it can
be applied "to every soul whom God hath guarded against sin, transgression, rebellion,
impiety, disbelief and the like."[38] This "gift of grace" is "a ray of the bounty of infallibility"
and "is granted to every holy soul."[39] Bahá'í scripture distinguishes between essential
infallibility and infallibility that has been conferred through divine bestowal.[40]

Dr. Schaefer’s discussion of “essential infallibility”1 is impeccable, and although I have
written an even more detailed monograph on the subject, I consider his exposition to be
comprehensive and theologically flawless. It is cited in full at the end of this paper and
without comment, apart from a few observations here.

His indication that “immaculateness” is the meaning Bahá’u’lláh intended when He
refers to that infallibility which is to be associated with “every soul whom God hath
guarded against sin, transgression, rebellion, impiety, disbelief and the like” is, in the view
of this author, too limited to encompass all of those degrees and varieties of “protection
from error”. There are some individuals who may be “guarded against sin”, in that they
do not think or feel or act in a sinful manner. Others may commit sins but not

transgressions. Yet others may commit sins and transgressions but are not rebellious. Yet
others may be pious, or have deep faith, or be spiritually gifted in other ways. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá has written, in the Tablet of the Inmost Heart, that the infallible standard of
knowledge is that of the inmost heart, and inasmuch as His discussion is of human
epistemology, I think it is reasonable to surmise that human beings have access to an
infallible gauge of truth within their own selves, that is, their innermost selves. Since
Bahá’u’lláh often wrote of the knowledge of the innermost heart using the same
terminology (fu’ad) and sometimes different terminology (qalb or dil), it is also reasonable
to infer that every human being is potentially able to access some level of infallibility. The
two kinds of infallibility discussed in “Some Answered Questions” seem to be on the one
hand the Most Great Infallibility, which Bahá’u’lláh associates exclusively with the
Manifestation of God, called “essential infallibility” by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; and on the other
hand the “conferred infallibility” (or infallibility of attributes) such as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
associates, that same source, with the Universal House of Justice. While it may be argued
that all infallibility apart from the “essential infallibility” of the Manifestation is
“conferred” by the Manifestation upon another, nevertheless in this specific context we are
examining the conferring of infallibility through a deliberate and definite identification of
a particular individual or institution and the promise of divine protection and inspiration
in such wise that all of humanity is enjoined to submit to and have complete confidence in
that individual or institution. Hence, Bahá’u’lláh did not specifically confer infallibility on
any individuals apart from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, nor on any institutions apart from the House of
Justice. While others certain derive whatever degrees and varieties of infallibility they may
possess from the Manifestation of God, nevertheless, they have not been the recipients of
“conferred infallibility” in the sense of the chosen ones and the Universal House of Justice.
This is a very important distinction to make, inasmuch as otherwise it might be claimed
that individual believers (or even non-believers) possessed an equivalent or superior
degree or variety of “conferred infallibility” to that conferred upon the chosen ones or the
Universal House of Justice. A doctrine of this kind would undermine the unity of the
community, the integrity of Bahá’í doctrine, and the locus of spiritual as well as temporal
authority in the twin Institutions of the Administrative Order.

Essential infallibility (al-'isma adh-dhátíya)

Essential infallibility is an inherent attribute and confined to the prophets; it is an
exclusive characteristic of the ontological station of the messengers of God, just as the sun's
rays are inherent in the sun. This concept can only be understood in the context of Bahá'í
prophetology[41] which shall be shortly delineated.

In the past, there have been different answers to the question as to the nature of the
founding figures of the various religions. The starting point of the theophanology of the

Abrahamic religions was the dualism existing between God and man. Again and again,
the question has been raised as to whether the mediator of the divine will is a human
being called upon by God to carry out a special mission, or whether, instead, God has
incarnated himself, taking on the human form in the person of the "Manifestation" or
messenger of God. According to Jewish, Zoroastrian and Islamic doctrine, Moses,
Zoroaster and Muhammad are human beings who have been called upon to act as the
mouthpiece of God.[42] Christian theology, on the other hand, defined the nature of Christ
at the Council of Nicaea in the year 325 CE, giving an ontological interpretation to the
dignitary title of the Messiah "Son of God", expressed by the formula "vere homo, vere Deus"
["true man, and true God"]. According to the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, Christ is the
incarnate Son of God, being simultaneously man and God in "hypostatic union."[43]

Bahá'u'lláh's revelation conveys a more differentiated view of the divine messengers.

The scripture imparts a conceptual scheme of Bahá'í ontology, a trichotomy according to
which there are three worlds: the eternally inaccessible world of God ('álamu'l-haqq) which
is "exalted beyond the grasp of the minds of men",[44] the world of creation ('álamu'l-khalq)
and an intermediate world, the world of the revelation of the divine command ('álamu'l-
amr). The prophets and messengers of God are part of this intermediate world.

This view has been expressed terminologically: In place of the Qur'ánic terms nabí
(prophet) and rasÏl (messenger), we find in Bahá'í scripture the frequently occurring term
mazharu'lláh or az-zuhÏr (Manifestation of God)[45] by which it is indicated that these figures
are exalted above normal human existence and have an ontological station above that of
man, that they are beings sui generis. A twofold nature has been assigned to them: a human
station and a spiritual station which is "born of the substance of God himself" (iláhí).[46]

The fundamental ontological difference between human beings and the prophets is pre-
existence[47] and their innate knowledge of the world of creation (násÏt) and of the
metaphysical world (malakÏt, jabarÏt): "They are the Treasuries of divine knowledge[48] ... the
Mines of divine Wisdom."[49] Their knowledge is not acquired, not gained by reflection or
experience. Rather it is "divine knowledge,"[50] the "knowledge of being" ('ilmu'l-wujÏd)[51]
which is "like the cognizance and consciousness that man has of himself."[52] The
Manifestations of God "are aware of the reality of things,"[53] of the needs and exigencies of
the human world, they are "sanctified Mirrors"[54] reflecting the light of God,[55] "the focal
points where the signs, tokens and perfections of that sacred pre-existent Reality appear in
their splendour."[56] Their "knowledge of being"[57] has been expressed by Bahá'u'lláh in a
metaphor according to which the Manifestation is like a "Divine and Infallible
physician"[58] who "has His finger on the pulse of mankind" who "perceiveth the disease
and prescribeth, in His unerring wisdom, the remedy."[59]

Thus, the divine messengers are "Manifestations" of God and not his incarnations.[60] In
relation to God, the Manifestation appears as utter nothingness, but in relation to the
world of creation ('álamu'l-khalq, násÏt) he is endowed with all the attributes of God.[61]
Only through knowledge of the Manifestations is knowledge of God attainable.[62] Each of
them has been the "representative and mouthpiece of God:"[63]

> Whoso recognizeth them hath recognized God. Whoso hearkeneth to their call,
> hath hearkened to the Voice of God, and whoso testifieth to the truth of their
> Revelation, hath testified to the truth of God Himself. Whoso turneth away from
> them, hath turned away from God, and whoso disbelieveth in them, hath
> disbelieved in God. Every one of them is the Way of God that connecteth this
> world with the realms above, and the Standard of His Truth unto every one in the
> kingdoms of earth and heaven.[64]

The charisma of infallibility is a logical precondition, an "essential requirement"[65] for
this representation of God, by which he safeguards and protects his word, his laws and
ordinances, from all error. God's sovereignty which has been expressed in the verses:

> The Will of God is not limited by the standards of the people, and God doth not
> tread in their ways... Verily He is to be praised in His acts and to be obeyed in His
> behests. He hath no associate in His judgement nor any helper in His
> sovereignty.[66]

God's sovereignty is also an attribute of the Manifestation:

> He doeth what He willeth, He chooseth, and none may question His choice.[67]
> Were He to pronounce water to be wine or heaven to be earth or light to be fire,
> He speaketh the truth and no doubt would there be about it; and unto no one is
> given the right to question His authority or to say why or wherefore. Whosoever
> raiseth objections will be numbered with the froward in the Book of God, the Lord
> of the worlds. 'Verily He shall not be asked of His doings but all others shall be
> asked of their doings.' He is come from the invisible heaven, bearing the banner
> 'He doeth whatsoever He willeth' and is accompanied by hosts of power and
> authority.[68]

Thus, God's sovereignty is represented through his Manifestations. Therefore they are
"not under the shadow of the former laws."[69]

Bahá'u'lláh has confirmed the doctrine of 'ima (infallibility) which has been deduced
from the Qur'án and developed in Islam according to which the prophets are ma'sÏm, i.e.,
sinless, immaculate, morally infallible, and rendered by God immune to error, and

infallible in their judgement and decree. He termed this essential infallibility, "the Most
Great Infallibility," (al-'ismatu'l-kubrá) which is confined to the Manifestation, to the

> One Whose station is immeasurably exalted beyond ordinances or prohibitions
> and is sanctified from errors and omissions. Indeed He is a Light which is not
> followed by darkness and a Truth not overtaken by error[70] ... He Who is the
> Dawning-place of God's Cause hath no partner in the Most Great Infallibility. He
> it is Who, in the kingdom of creation ... is the Manifestation of "He doeth
> whatsoever He willeth."[71]

By virtue of their essential infallibility everything that emanates from the
Manifestations "is identical with the truth and conformable to reality... Whatever they say
is the Word of God, and whatever they perform is upright action."[72]

Bahá'u'lláh has made this principle the touchstone of man's faith and has formulated its
consequences in challenging language:

> Blessed is the man that hath acknowledged his belief in God and in His signs, and
> recognized that "He shall not be asked of His doings".[73] Such a recognition hath
> been made by God the ornament of every belief and its very foundation. Upon it
> must depend the acceptance of every goodly deed... Were He to decree as lawful
> the thing which from time immemorial had been forbidden, and forbid that which
> had, at all times, been regarded as lawful, to none is given the right to question
> His authority. Whoso will hesitate, though it be for less than a moment, should be
> regarded as a transgressor. Whoso hath not recognized this sublime and
> fundamental verity, and hath failed to attain this most exalted station, the winds
> of doubt will agitate him, and the sayings of the infidels will distract his soul. He
> that hath acknowledged this principle will be endowed with the most perfect
> constancy.[74]

This passage is undoubtedly a provocation which should be seen in the light of "the
showers of tests from His realm of glory,"[75] the divine purpose of which is that "the true
should be known from the false, and sun from shadow."[76] Bahá'u'lláh elsewhere speaks of
the "fears and agitation which the revelation of this law provokes in men's hearts."[77]
Similar tests happened in previous dispensations.[78]

Conferred infallibility (al-'isma al-sifátíya)[79]

There is a categorical difference to essential infallibility: conferred infallibility covers only
one of the two categories of 'isma, the inability to fall into error, and the infallibility of
judgement. Infallibility conferred to an institution does not imply freedom from sin,
sinlessness, or immaculacy.[80]

It is peculiar that Dr. Schaefer associates the “infallibility” which “can be applied ‘to
every soul whom God hath guarded against sin, transgression, rebellion, impiety, disbelief
and the like’” with “immaculacy”, while stating that the “infallibility conferred to an
institution does not imply freedom from sin, sinlessness, or immaculacy.” So “every soul”
may be immaculate, but no institution may be immaculate? What is the textual basis for
this interpretation? In a footnote, Dr. Schaefer quotes a short phrase from a statement of
the Guardian, in which he distinguishes himself and any future Guardians from ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. The passage in its totality is cited here:

> “No Guardian of the Faith, I feel it my solemn duty to place on record, can ever
> claim to be the perfect exemplar of the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh or the stainless
> mirror that reflects His light. Though overshadowed by the unfailing, the unerring
> protection of Bahá'u'lláh and of the Báb, and however much he may share with
> 'Abdu'l-Bahá the right and obligation to interpret the Bahá'í teachings, he remains
> essentially human and cannot, if he wishes to remain faithful to his trust, arrogate
> to himself, under any pretense whatsoever, the rights, the privileges and
> prerogatives which Bahá'u'lláh has chosen to confer upon His Son. In the light of
> this truth to pray to the Guardian of the Faith, to address him as lord and master,
> to designate him as his holiness, to seek his benediction, to celebrate his birthday,
> or to commemorate any event associated with his life would be tantamount to a
> departure from those established truths that are enshrined within our beloved
> Faith. The fact that the Guardian has been specifically endowed with such power
> as he may need to reveal the purport and disclose the implications of the
> utterances of Bahá'u'lláh and of 'Abdu'l-Bahá does not necessarily confer upon
> him a station co-equal with those Whose words he is called upon to interpret. He
> can exercise that right and discharge this obligation and yet remain infinitely
> inferior to both of them in rank and different in nature.” (Shoghi Effendi, The
> World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 150)

This passage clearly distinguishes between the station, rank and infallibility of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá in comparison with Shoghi Effendi (and any future Guardians), however it does not
indicate that immaculacy is reserved to persons and not bestowed upon institutions.
Shoghi Effendi was a person, not just the first (and historically only) representative of an
institution. If it be alleged that he was not protected from error as a person but rather as an
institution, the same could be claimed for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who incarnated the institution of
the Centre of the Covenant, and for Bahá’u’lláh, Who embodied the institution of the
Manifestation of God. While the scope and nature of the infallibility of the Centre of the
Covenant is distinct from that both of the Manifestation of God and of the Guardian and
Universal House of Justice, there is no distinction between the person and the institution
of these various possessors of protection from error. On the other hand, if we claim that

because Shoghi Effendi was not as perfect in his immaculacy as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, that this
implies that he was as prone to err as any other believer or any other human being, we
undermine his moral authority, we question his purity of character, and for what benefit?
A less literal understanding of the terminology here would permit us to recognize that
“The good deeds of the righteous are the sins of the Near Ones.” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Some
Answered Questions, p. 126) The immaculacy of the Manifestation of God is not to be
compared with the immaculacy of God Himself. The immaculacy of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is not to
be compared with the immaculacy of a Manifestation of God. The immaculacy of the
Guardian is not to be compared with the immaculacy of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. We preserve intact
the dignity of every station, without violating the important distinctions between one
station and another.

In the Bahá'í Faith infallibility has been exclusively conferred on the Guardian in his
function as the authoritative interpreter of the holy writ and on the Universal House of
Justice.[81]

Referring to the Guardian and to the Universal House of Justice, 'Abdu'l-Bahá's
Testament proclaims:

> The guardian of the Cause of God as well as the Universal House of Justice... are
> both under the care and protection of the Abhá Beauty, under the shelter and
> unerring guidance of His Holiness, the Exalted One[82] ... Whatsoever they decide
> is of God.[83]

Once again, Dr. Schaefer gives an interpretation of Bahá’í doctrine without citing any
proof text, or explanation. The most pertinent passages of the following source texts are
cited in red letters, to facilitate their differentiation from the other contents. According to
two letters written on behalf of the Guardian, and approved by him as representing his
intentions, we find the following assertions regarding the infallibility of the Guardian:

> "The infallibility of the Guardian is confined to matters which are related strictly to
> the Cause and interpretations of the Teachings; he is not an infallible authority on
> other subjects, such as economics, science, etc." (from a letter written in 1944, cited:
> http://bahai-library.com/uhj_infallibility_history_guardian)

> "The Guardian's infallibility covers interpretation of the revealed word, and its
> application. Likewise any instructions he may issue having to do with the
> protection of the Faith, or its well-being must be closely obeyed, as he is infallible
> in the protection of the Faith. He is assured the guidance of both Bahá’u’lláh and
> the Bab, as the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá clearly reveals." (from a letter

> written    in     1956,       cited:      http://bahai-library.com/uhj_infallibility_
> history_guardian)

From these two letters it is evident that “the infallibility of the Guardian is confined to
matters which are related strictly to the Cause and interpretations of the Teachings”, “to
interpretation of the revealed word, and its application.” Surely “application” of the
“revealed word” implies a wider meaning than mere interpretation of meaning. Likewise,
“he is infallible in the protection of the Faith” and this extends the range of his protection
from error beyond “interpretation” as well.

The Universal House of Justice has written:

> “While the specific responsibility of the Guardian is the interpretation of the
> Word, he is also invested with all the powers and prerogatives necessary to
> discharge his function as Guardian of the Cause, its Head and supreme protector.
> He is, furthermore, made the irremovable head and member for life of the
> supreme legislative body of the Faith. It is as the head of the Universal House of
> Justice, and as a member of that body, that the Guardian takes part in the process
> of legislation. If the following passage, which gave rise to your query, is
> considered as referring to this last relationship, you will see that there is no
> contradiction between it and the other texts: "Though the Guardian of the Faith
> has been made the permanent head of so august a body he can never, even
> temporarily, assume the right of exclusive legislation. He cannot override the
> decision of the majority of his fellow-members, but is bound to insist upon a
> reconsideration by them of any enactment he conscientiously believes to conflict
> with the meaning and to depart from the spirit of Bahá'u'lláh's revealed
> utterances."

> “Although the Guardian, in relation to his fellow-members within the Universal
> House of Justice, cannot override the decision of the majority, it is inconceivable
> that the other members would ignore any objection he raised in the course of
> consultation or pass legislation contrary to what he expressed as being in harmony
> with the spirit of the Cause. It is, after all, the final act of judgment delivered by
> the Universal House of Justice that is vouchsafed infallibility, not any views
> expressed in the course of the process of enactment…

> “The Master in His Will and Testament explicitly institutes the Guardianship,
> which Shoghi Effendi states was clearly anticipated in the verses of the Kitab-i-
> Aqdas, reaffirms and elucidates the authority of the Universal House of Justice,
> and refers the believers once again to the Book: "Unto the Most Holy Book
> everyone must turn and all that is not expressly recorded therein must be referred
> to the Universal House of Justice," and at the very end of the Will He says: "All

> must seek guidance and turn unto the Center of the Cause and the House of
> Justice. And he that turneth unto whatsoever else is indeed in grevious error."

> “As the sphere of jurisdiction of the Universal House of Justice in matters of
> legislation extends to whatever is not explicitly revealed in the Sacred Text, it is
> clear that the Book itself is the highest authority and delimits the sphere of action
> of the House of Justice. Likewise, the Interpreter of the Book must also have the
> authority to define the sphere of the legislative action of the elected
> representatives of the Cause. The writings of the Guardian and the advice given
> by him over the thirty-six years of his Guardianship show the way in which he
> exercised this function in relation to the Universal House of Justice as well as to
> National and Local Spiritual Assemblies.

> “The fact that the Guardian has the authority to define the sphere of the legislative
> action of the Universal House of Justice does not carry with it the corollary that
> without such guidance the Universal House of Justice might stray beyond the
> limits of its proper authority; such a deduction would conflict with all the other
> texts referring to its infallibility, and specifically with the Guardian's own clear
> assertion that the Universal House of Justice never can or will infringe on the
> sacred and prescribed domain of the Guardianship…” (from a letter written in
> 1969, cited: http://bahai-library.com/uhj_guardianship_uhj_infallibility)

The purpose in citing these passages has been to demonstrate, through the citation of
relevant texts, the parameters of the infallibility of the Guardian, which are broader in fact
than Dr. Schaefer has affirmed. On the other hand, the Guardian has not claimed
unlimited infallibility for himself or for the Guardianship. In fact, a cynical observer, who
might expect that the Guardian would take advantage of every possible justification to
expand and consolidate the range of his influence, would be surprised to discover the
degree to which the Guardian limited the range of his infallibility in view of the following
blanket statements made by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Part One (paragraph 18) of His Will and
Testament (http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_will_testament):

> “The sacred and youthful branch, the Guardian of the Cause of God, as well as the
> Universal House of Justice to be universally elected and established, are both
> under the care and protection of the Abhá Beauty, under the shelter and unerring
> guidance of the Exalted One (may my life be offered up for them both).
> Whatsoever they decide is of God. Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth them,
> hath not obeyed God; whoso rebelleth against him and against them hath rebelled
> against God; whoso opposeth him hath opposed God; whoso contendeth with
> them hath contended with God; whoso disputeth with him hath disputed with
> God; whoso denieth him hath denied God; whoso disbelieveth in him hath
> disbelieved in God; whoso deviateth, separateth himself and turneth aside from

> him hath in truth deviated, separated himself and turned aside from God. May the
> wrath, the fierce indignation, the vengeance of God rest upon him! The mighty
> stronghold shall remain impregnable and safe through obedience to him who is
> the Guardian of the Cause of God. It is incumbent upon the members of the House
> of Justice, upon all the Aghsán, the Afnán, the Hands of the Cause of God to show
> their obedience, submissiveness and subordination unto the Guardian of the
> Cause of God, to turn unto him and be lowly before him. He that opposeth him
> hath opposed the True One, will make a breach in the Cause of God, will subvert
> His Word and will become a manifestation of the Center of Sedition. Beware,
> beware, lest the days after the ascension (of Bahá'u'lláh) be repeated when the
> Center of Sedition waxed haughty and rebellious and with Divine Unity for his

> vainglorious one that purposeth dissension and discord will not openly declare
> his evil purposes, nay rather, even as impure gold, will he seize upon divers
> measures and various pretexts that he may separate the gathering of the people of
> Bahá. My object is to show that the Hands of the Cause of God must be ever
> watchful and so soon as they find anyone beginning to oppose and protest against
> the Guardian of the Cause of God, cast him out from the congregation of the
> people of Bahá and in no wise accept any excuse from him. How often hath
> grievous error been disguised in the garb of truth, that it might sow the seeds of
> doubt in the hearts of men!”

While it is true that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá precedes this paragraph with the following statement—

> “After the passing away of this wronged one, it is incumbent upon the Aghsán
> (Branches), the Afnán (Twigs) of the Sacred Lote-Tree, the Hands (pillars) of the
> Cause of God and the loved ones of the Abhá Beauty to turn unto Shoghi
> Effendi—the youthful branch branched from the two hallowed and sacred Lote-
> Trees and the fruit grown from the union of the two offshoots of the Tree of
> Holiness,— as he is the sign of God, the chosen branch, the Guardian of the Cause
> of God, he unto whom all the Aghsán, the Afnán, the Hands of the Cause of God
> and His loved ones must turn. He is the Interpreter of the Word of God…”

— He does not limit the infallibility or the authority of the Guardian to his interpretive
function. Nor does Dr. Schaefer, as is evident below. Such a limitation would constitute an
unwarranted reduction in the scope and range of the Guardian’s infallibility and hence a
distortion of its parameters in comparison with the “conferred infallibility” of the Centre
of the Covenant and the Universal House of Justice. A revisionist reductionism of the
Guardian’s infallibility would no doubt encourage Bahá’ís to question and contend over
every action of the Guardian which was not specifically in pursuance of his role as
“Interpreter of the Word of God”. This could include criticisms of his aesthetics, his
literary style, his knowledge of Bahá’í law and Bahá’í doctrine, his marriage, his

relationship with his family, his failure to appoint a successor, his construction of the
Bahá’í administrative order, his adoption of plans and crusades to promote the Faith, his
expulsion of individuals from amongst the ranks of the believers and their designation as
Covenant-breakers, these and many more characteristics that are not specifically related to
the interpretation of the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh.

With reference to the Universal House of Justice it is stated that this institution has been
made "the source of all good and freed from all error"[84] by God, and that whatever it
decides is "the Truth and the Purpose of God himself."[85] Bahá'u'lláh has given the
assurance that, "God will verily inspire them with whatsoever He willeth."[86] Hence, the
charisma of infallibility rests not upon the community as a whole (as in the Catholic
Church)[87] and not upon the individual members of the House, but upon the office,[88]
which constitutes the objective, inherent limit of infallibility.[89] It is therefore important at
this juncture to consider the critical question of the immanent limits of conferred
infallibility, in order to clarify the principles involved.

This is a statement with which I find little fault. I would note that, as Dr. Schaefer is
well aware, while “the charisma of infallibility rests…upon the community as a whole…in
the Catholic Church”, since 1870, papal infallibility has been the practical instrument for
the “charisma of infallibility”, in that it is the Pope who is regarded as “infallible if he
takes a final decision in matters of doctrine or morals and speaks ex cathedra, i.e. in
performance of his teaching office (magisterium)”, to cite Dr. Schaefer’s statement from
earlier in this paper. Institutionally, the buck stops with the Pope in the Roman Catholic
Church, even as institutionally in the Bahá’í Faith, the buck stops with the Universal
House of Justice.

The question is whether absolutely everything written and spoken by the Guardian
claims to be free of error, and, similarly, whether everything decided by the Universal
House of Justice, even down to day-to-day administrative decisions or decisions on trivial
matters, are governed by 'Abdu'l-Bahá's dictum, "Whatever they decide is of God?[90] ...
Whatever they decide has the same effect as the Text itself."[91] In other words, is the
infallibility conferred upon these institutions without restriction or does it have inherent
limits?

The extent of conferred infallibility

It is easier to define the extent of the conferred infallibility in the case of the
Guardianship than for the Universal House of Justice, because Shoghi Effendi himself
defined the limits of the infallibility conferred upon the Guardianship. His infallibility was
restricted to the sphere of his interpretative power (auctoritas interpretationis)[92] and to his
office, i.e. to his authoritative interpretation of the scripture[93] and his role as protector of
the Faith. Beyond these functions the Guardian was expressly not infallible,[94] and indeed
he made no decisions concerning anything "that is not in the teachings."[95] As far as the
recorded facts are concerned, his historical works do not fall within the sphere of his
interpretative authority and are therefore not covered by the charisma; however in those
parts of his historical writings that constitute "narrative theology," where it is "his
interpretation of the theological significance of historical events"[96] that is at the forefront,
this charisma is, indeed, brought to bear.

What Dr. Schaefer does not include in this overview is the divine protection of the
“application” of the Bahá’í teachings, and this is a broad mandate which may be conceived
as protecting him from error in many endeavors which are not specifically associated
either with interpretation of the revealed Word or protection of the Faith. Were he to be
criticized for having chosen classical Greek architecture as the norm for the Bahá’í World
Centre, inasmuch as he was protected from error in his application of the Bahá’í teachings,
couldn’t it be reasoned that in his judgment this classical style which had stood the test of
time for over two millennia and which symbolized the permanence and authority for all
those who have come under the influence of Western civilization was best suited for the
Seat of the Universal House of Justice and the International Bahá’í Archives building so
closely associated with it? And that this judgment was divinely guided and protected from
error? Couldn’t it be reasoned that his decision, after the Supreme Court of Egypt issued a
ruling that the Bahá’í Faith was an independent religion and not a sect of Islam, to require
all Bahá’ís to resign their memberships in other religious communities, was also divinely
guided and protected from error? There were many decisions taken by the Guardian
which, in retrospect, we may discover not to have involved either interpretation of the
revealed Word or protection of the Faith. Are all of these decisions now up for grabs?
Subject to criticism? The Universal House of Justice, in the letter cited above, writes:
“While the specific responsibility of the Guardian is the interpretation of the Word, he is
also invested with all the powers and prerogatives necessary to discharge his function as
Guardian of the Cause, its Head and supreme protector.” There is no reason to
disassociate the Guardian’s assurance of divine protection and infallibility from “all the
powers and prerogatives” which he found “necessary to discharge his function as
Guardian of the Cause, its Head and supreme protector.

There is no explicit statement either in the scripture or in the writings of Shoghi Effendi
concerning the specific spheres in which the functions of the House of Justice are granted
infallibility.[97] No statement on the subject has yet been made by the Universal House of
Justice itself. Indeed, it is hardly likely that any official statement will be issued since, as
will be seen later, although this is a question with far-reaching psychological implications
on the consciousness of the believers and the institutions, it has no relevance for the legal
authority of that supreme body, which derives simply from the fact that it has been
ordained by Bahá'u'lláh. The strict obedience the believers have to pay to this institution,
as expressed in 'Abdu'l-Bahá's Testament, "Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth them,
hath not obeyed God,"[98] is not based on their special charisma.

I think that, analogous to Shoghi Effendi's self-restricting interpretation, the infallibility
conferred on the Universal House of Justice does not extend to all its acts, but covers only
those functions which are explicitly mentioned in 'Abdu'l-Bahá's testament. These are all
acts of supplementary legislation on matters that are not expressly recorded in the Book,[99]
including the decisions on problems which have caused difference, questions that are
obscure and on issues that are of universal relevance.

In many instances infallibility is associated with authority in references to the
Manifestation of God, the Centre of the Covenant, and the Guardian. Why would the
Universal House of Justice be endowed with “conferred infallibility”, which is explicitly
the case according to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in “Some Answered Questions”, and with divine
inspiration is making its decisions, which is positively affirmed by Bahá’u’lláh in various
Tablets, without that “conferred infallibility” being defined and limited? What possible
purpose could it serve for humanity to be endowed with an institution which is assured of
infallible divine protection, but without any indication of which actions were divinely
protected? The evidence to the contrary will be marshaled and set forth in the course of
this paper.

The Universal House of Justice has written letters addressing this question, and
passages from these letters will now be cited. The first is an elucidation of the meaning of
the following passage from “The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh”:

> “Referring to both the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice we read these
> emphatic words: "The sacred and youthful Branch, the Guardian of the Cause of
> God, as well as the Universal House of Justice to be universally elected and
> established, are both under the care and protection of the Abha Beauty, under the
> shelter and unerring guidance of the Exalted One (the Bab) (may my life be offered
> up for them both). Whatsoever they decide is of God."

> “From these statements it is made indubitably clear and evident that the Guardian
> of the Faith has been made the Interpreter of the Word and that the Universal
> House of Justice has been invested with the function of legislating on matters not

> enactments of the International House of Justice, whose exclusive right and
> prerogative is to pronounce upon and deliver the final judgment on such laws and
> ordinances as Bahá'u'lláh has not expressly revealed. Neither can, nor will ever,
> infringe upon the sacred and prescribed domain of the other. Neither will seek to
> curtail the specific and undoubted authority with which both have been divinely

> “Though the Guardian of the Faith has been made the permanent head of so

> legislation. He cannot override the decision of the majority of his fellow-members,
> but is bound to insist upon a reconsideration by them of any enactment he
> conscientiously believes to conflict with the meaning and to depart from the spirit
> of Bahá'u'lláh's revealed utterances. He interprets what has been specifically
> revealed, and cannot legislate except in his capacity as member of the Universal
> House of Justice. He is debarred from laying down independently the constitution

> World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, pp. 149-150)

The Universal House of Justice writes:

March 1965, on the appointment of a second Guardian)

The infallibility of the Universal House of Justice, operating within its ordained sphere,
has not been made dependent upon the presence in its membership of the Guardian of the
Cause. Although in the realm of interpretation the Guardian's pronouncements are always
binding, in the area of the Guardian's participation in legislation it is always the decision
of the House itself which must prevail. This is supported by the words of the Guardian:

> ”’The interpretation of the Guardian, functioning within his own sphere, is as
> authoritative and binding as the enactments of the International House of Justice,
> whose exclusive right and prerogative is to pronounce upon and deliver the final
> judgment on such laws and ordinances as Bahá'u'lláh has not expressly revealed.
> Neither can, nor will ever, infringe upon the sacred and prescribed domain of the
> other. Neither will seek to curtail the specific and undoubted authority with which
> both have been divinely invested.’” (in a letter written by the Universal House of
> Justice, dated 27 May 1966, included in "Messages, 1963 to 1986", p. 84)

> ”The Guardian and the Universal House of Justice have certain duties and
> functions in common; each also operates within a separate and distinct sphere. As
> Shoghi Effendi explained, "...it is made indubitably clear and evident that the
> Guardian of the Faith has been made the Interpreter of the Word and that the
> Universal House of Justice has been invested with the function of legislating on
> matters not expressly revealed in the teachings. The interpretation of the

> the enactments of the International House of Justice, whose exclusive right and
> prerogative is to pronounce upon and deliver the final judgment on such laws and
> ordinances as Bahá'u'lláh has not expressly revealed." He goes on to affirm,
> "Neither can, nor will ever, infringe upon the sacred and prescribed domain of the
> other. Neither will seek to curtail the specific and undoubted authority with which
> both have been divinely invested." It is impossible to conceive that two centers of
> authority, which the Master has stated "are both under the care and protection of
> the Abha Beauty, under the shelter and unerring guidance of His Holiness the
> Exalted One," could conflict with one another, because both are vehicles of the
> same Divine Guidance.

> “The Universal House of Justice, beyond its function as the enactor of legislation,

In other letters included in “Messages, 1963-1986), we find the following (pp. 157, 158,
161):

> "The Universal House of Justice, beyond its function as the enactor of legislation,

> Order and in the formulation of Local and National Bahá'í Constitutions."

These letters of the Universal House of Justice are written in very clear language, and it
is unnecessary to reiterate their contents. It is evident from those contents that the
parameters of the infallibility of the Universal House of Justice are established, in the
Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, in the written interpretations of the Centre of His Covenant and in
the written interpretations written by and on behalf of the Guardian of His Cause. They
are, furthermore, elaborated and elucidated in the Constitution of the Universal House of
Justice.

In conclusion, it seems to me that, contrary to your assertion to the contrary, the
Universal House of Justice has emphatically claimed divine protection over all those
endeavors which are within its sphere of operations, and that it has cited texts in support
of this claim. The functions of the House that are protected from error are far more various
than the "acts of supplementary legislation on matters that are not expressly recorded in
the Book" which you have cited. Indeed, in a relatively recent letter written on behalf of
the Universal House of Justice, already cited, is the following unambiguous affirmation:

> "We have found nothing in the writings of Shoghi Effendi which suggests that the
> House of Justice would on any occasion reach a "wrong decision"."

Several factors might support this interpretation of the infallibility conferred on the
House of Justice. The starting point of our discourse is the fact that the Universal House of
Justice possesses the fullness of jurisdictional power,

comprising executive (administrative), judicial and legislative functions, whereas the
Guardian has been invested with the power of interpretation. There is a strict separation of
the two powers between the two pillars of the order. [100

The various letters of the Universal House of Justice which differentiate between its
own functions and those of the Guardian indicate that the Guardian had executive
(administrative) and judicial functions. The Guardian specifically indicates in his letters
that many of the executive and judicial orders he initiated would be turned over to the
Universal House of Justice when it was established. During the period though when he
was the sole executive and judicial authority in the Faith, can it be argued that his
executive and judicial decisions were less than infallible, less than divinely protected from
error? Weren't these decisions integral to the protection of the Faith, as well as the

application of the Bahá’í teachings, both vital functions of the Guardian? The Universal
House of Justice has explained in some of the letters cited above that the decisions of the
Guardian which are under divine protection are not restricted to those pertaining to
interpretation of the revealed Word, and that the decisions of the Universal House of
Justice which are under divine protection are not restricted to those pertaining to the
enactment of supplementary legislation. The Guardian does not prescript a “strict
separation of the two powers between the two pillars of the order”, that is, between the
Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice, similar to the separation of established
church and state in the USA. On the contrary, as cited above, the Guardian indicates that
"each operates within a clearly defined sphere of jurisdiction...Neither can, nor will ever,
infringe upon the sacred and prescribed domain of the other. Neither will seek to curtail
the specific and undoubted authority with which both have been divinely invested". But
the Guardian exercised executive and judicial functions, the House exercises executive and
judicial functions...isn't this a sphere is which their authority overlapped, making a smooth
transition from the one to the other possible? If the Guardian had not exercised executive
and judicial authority, could the Universal House of Justice have come into existence? And
if the House of Justice did not exercise executive and judicial authority, could the Bahá’í
community as we know it continue to exist? It seems to me that a "clearly defined sphere
of jurisdiction" refers to the function of interpretation invested in the Guardian, and the
function of legislation invested in the House; rather than a denial that there were functions
that both institutions carried out, during different time periods, which were and are
divinely protected from error. I don't think the Will and Testament allows us to conceive
of either the Guardian or the House making a mistake in administration or judicial ruling.

From the very beginning the House of Justice was envisioned as a legislature and
invested with the function of supplementary legislation. The norms of the book that
constitute the law of God are valid and unchangeable for at least one thousand years,          [101]

and have therefore been formulated on a more abstract level. The House of Justice has

[102]

been empowered to elaborate these laws and to provide for subsidiary laws according to
the requirements of a steadily changing society through the enactment of supplementary
legislation.

To begin with, many of laws revealed in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, in the supplementary Q&A,
and in other Tablets, including those revealed in Adrianople regarding the rites of
pilgrimage and commemorative prayer, which set forth laws that do not appear to be
“abstract”. Laws prescribing the paring of nails, the cutting of hair, the payment of debts,
and bathing in clean water are hardly “formulated on a more abstract level.” It is the
Bahá’í principles and moral and ethical guidelines which are often expressed in more

“abstract” terms, and these are found throughout the Writings, from the “Hidden Words”
to the “Epistle to the Son of the Wolf”, a span of over 40 years.

In the Suriy-i-Muluk, Bahá’u’lláh writes:

> “Say: It behoveth you, O Ministers of State, to keep the precepts of God, and to
> forsake your own laws and regulations, and to be of them who are guided aright.
> Better is this for you than all ye possess, did ye but know it. If ye transgress the
> commandment of God, not one jot or one tittle of all your works shall be
> acceptable in His sight.” (Bahá’u’lláh, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 196)

If the “precepts of God” were “formulated on a more abstract level”, how could they
have replaced the “laws and regulations” enacted by secular governments? In the “Lawh-
i-Dunya”, Bahá’u’lláh reiterates this principle in very emphatic language:

> “Were men to strictly observe that which the Pen of the Most High hath revealed
> in the Crimson Book, they could then well afford to dispense with the regulations
> which prevail in the world. Certain exhortations have repeatedly streamed forth
> from the Pen of the Most High that perchance the manifestations of power and the
> dawning-places of might may, sometime, be enabled to enforce them.”
> (Bahá’u’lláh, Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh written after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 90)

As for the assertion of Dr. Schaefer that the Universal House of Justice was envisioned
by Bahá’u’lláh as a legislature, consider what He has written in the following instances,
drawn from His Writings:

> “The men of God's House of Justice have been charged with the affairs of the
> people. (Bahá’u’lláh, Bisharat, in Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 26; Ishraqat, in TB, p.

128)

Did Bahá’u’lláh circumscribe that responsibility by indicating that the House of Justice
was to enact laws but not to enforce them?

> “All matters of State should be referred to the House of Justice, but acts of worship
> must be observed according to that which God hath revealed in His Book.”
> (Bahá’u’lláh, Bisharat, in Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 27; Ishraqat, in TB, p. 129)

Did Bahá’u’lláh limit the purview of the House of Justice by stating that it was to
concern itself only with legislation, and indeed, with legislation pertaining to the Bahá’í
community?

> “It is incumbent upon the Trustees of the House of Justice to take counsel together
> regarding those things which have not outwardly been revealed in the Book, and
> to enforce that which is agreeable to them.” (Bahá’u’lláh, Kalimat-i-Firdawsiyyih,
> in Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 68)

A legislature does not enforce what is agreeable to itself. That is the function of the
executive. And yet here the House of Justice is charged not merely with legislation but
with enforcement.

> “We exhort the men of the House of Justice and command them to ensure the
> protection and safeguarding of men, women and children. It is incumbent upon
> them to have the utmost regard for the interests of the people at all times and
> under all conditions. Blessed is the ruler who succoureth the captive, and the rich
> one who careth for the poor, and the just one who secureth from the wrong doer
> the rights of the downtrodden, and happy the trustee who observeth that which
> the Ordainer, the Ancient of Days hath prescribed unto him.” (Bahá’u’lláh,
> Kalimat-i-Firdawsiyyih, in Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, pp. 69-70)

While a legislative body can certainly enact laws that potentially accomplish all of the
objectives set forth by Bahá’u’lláh, it can not “ensure the protection and safeguarding of
men, women and children. Once more, this is the responsibility of the executive branch of
government.

> “According to the fundamental laws which We have formerly revealed in the
> Kitáb-i-Aqdas and other Tablets, all affairs are committed to the care of just kings
> and presidents and of the Trustees of the House of Justice.” (Bahá’u’lláh, Lawh-i-
> Dunya, in Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 92)

Here Bahá’u’lláh associates the House of Justice with other forms of government, with
“just kings” (monarchy) “and presidents” (democracy), and once more it should be noted
that kings and presidents are executive authorities, not principally legislative in their
functions.

> “In former Epistles We have enjoined upon the Trustees of the House of Justice
> either to choose one language from among those now existing or to adopt a new
> one, and in like manner to select a common script, both of which should be taught
> in all the schools of the world.” (Bahá’u’lláh, Ishraqat, in Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, p.

127)

While a legislature could enact a law stating that one language was to be used by all of
mankind, if it were denied executive authority, how would it ensure that that language
would be “taught in all the schools of the world”?

> “The religion of God and His divine law are the most potent instruments and the
> surest of all means for the dawning of the light of unity amongst men. The
> progress of the world, the development of nations, the tranquillity of peoples, and
> the peace of all who dwell on earth are among the principles and ordinances of
> God. Religion bestoweth upon man the most precious of all gifts, offereth the cup
> of prosperity, imparteth eternal life, and showereth imperishable benefits upon

> mankind. It behoveth the chiefs and rulers of the world, and in particular the
> Trustees of God's House of Justice, to endeavour to the utmost of their power to
> safeguard its position, promote its interests and exalt its station in the eyes of the
> world.” (Bahá’u’lláh, Ishraqat, in Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, pp. 129-130)

Once again, in this passage, Bahá’u’lláh associates the House of Justice with “chiefs and
rulers of the world”, executive authorities rather than legislators.

> “Therefore as a token of favour towards men We have prescribed that interest on
> money should be treated like other business transactions that are current amongst
> men. Thus, now that this lucid commandment hath descended from the heaven of
> the Will of God, it is lawful and proper to charge interest on money, that the
> people of the world may, in a spirit of amity and fellowship and with joy and
> gladness, devotedly engage themselves in magnifying the Name of Him Who is
> the Well-Beloved of all mankind. Verily He ordaineth according to His Own
> choosing. He hath now made interest on money lawful, even as He had made it
> unlawful in the past. Within His grasp He holdeth the kingdom of authority. He
> doeth and ordaineth. He is in truth the Ordainer, the All-Knowing…

> “Nevertheless the conduct of these affairs hath been entrusted to the men of the
> House of Justice that they may enforce them according to the exigencies of the
> time and the dictates of wisdom.” (Bahá’u’lláh, Ishraqat, in Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh,
> pp. 133,134)

This final example demonstrates in its use of language, that the House of Justice is not
just a legislative body, but that “the conduct of these affairs hath been entrusted to the
men of the House of Justice that they may enforce them according to the exigencies of the
time and the dictates of wisdom.” This conduct involves juridical judgement, and
enforcement—and there is no indication in this passage or in any of the previously cited
passages that the House of Justice is left unprotected and vulnerable to error in its
discharge of these juridical and executive functions.

On the contrary, in the “Bisharat” and the “Ishraqat”, Bahá’u’lláh writes:

> “They that, for the sake of God, arise to serve His Cause, are the recipients of
> divine inspiration from the unseen Kingdom. It is incumbent upon all to be
> obedient unto them. All matters of State should be referred to the House of Justice,
> but acts of worship must be observed according to that which God hath revealed
> in His Book.” (Bahá’u’lláh, Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, pp. 27, 129)

Dr. Schaefer has argued that Bahá’u’lláh envisioned the House of Justice receiving
divine protection only in the discharge of its legislative mandate, and has cited the
following passage from the “Kalimat-i-Firdawsiyyih” as evidence of this position:

> “It is incumbent upon the Trustees of the House of Justice to take counsel together
> regarding those things which have not outwardly been revealed in the Book, and
> to enforce that which is agreeable to them. God will verily inspire them with
> whatsoever He willeth, and He, verily, is the Provider, the Omniscient.”
> (Bahá’u’lláh, Kalimat-i-Firdawsiyyih, in Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 68)

He indicates that in his judgment “to enforce that which is agreeable to them” refers to
“those things which have not been outwardly revealed in the Book”, and hence that the
enforcement is an extension of the legislative authority conferred upon the House of
Justice. If the US Congress were to be charged with the enforcement of its enacted laws,
would this not encroach upon the authority and responsibility of the executive branch of
the US Federal government? While it could be argued that the House of Justice should not
be compared with the threefold separation of powers enshrined in the US Constitution,
nevertheless, enforcement of any laws is an executive and not a legislative function. In
particular, in view of the many passages cited above which set forth juridical and
executive functions for the House of Justice, and the statement that the members of this
Body “are the recipients of divine inspiration from the unseen Kingdom”, based only upon
these selections from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh it is reasonable to conclude that this
Institution is divinely inspired, not only in its discharge of legislative but also of juridical
and executive functions.

The future development of Bahá'í law will not come about, as was the case in Islam,
through authoritative interpretation by the "learned ones" (al-'ulamá'),[103] but rather
through supplementary legislation by an authorized legislative body that is, moreover,
empowered to abrogate its own laws and to adapt its own legislation to the exigencies of a
continuously changing world. Thus the Bahá'í law has been provided "with an essential
element of flexibility."[104] The Bahá'í sacred law is constituted by both the laws Bahá'u'lláh
has given his people in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas which is the kernel of the law of God, and the
supplementary laws enacted by the Universal House of Justice.

Your portrayal of the future development of Bahá’í law through supplementary legislation
rather than through authoritative interpretation by the learned reflects its nature as a core
principle of the Faith, for Bahá’u’lláh has effectively eliminated the power of the first
estate. One is reminded of "From two ranks amongst men power hath been seized: kings
and ecclesiastics." (Shoghi Effendi, The Promised Day is Come, pp. 20, 71) Whereas
Bahá’u’lláh spoke of future kings, who would embrace His Faith and labor to promulgate
and enforce its revealed statutes, He made no such prediction for the future of the clerical
order. Indeed as generous as was His praise of the “learned in Baha’”(K173, TB138-

139,221), the function of the learned is to serve the Universal House of Justice, to propagate
the Faith, and to attend to the education of mankind, not to exercise power in any fashion.
This is as much the fate of the mystic mentor as it is of the legalistic cleric and dogmatic
theologian—every one of them is out of a job. Nor does Bahá’u’lláh contemplate their
replacement with a new order of intermediaries between His Will and the masses. They
are called instead to investigate reality and truth independently of all others, for
themselves, and to acquire all the skills and knowledge, as well as the purity of heart and
of mind required to take that journey and arrive at their destination.

Another factor supporting this interpretation is the testimony provided in written
sources. Whenever the supreme body is mentioned in the holy text or referred to in the
writings of Shoghi Effendi it is in the context of matters "which have not outwardly been
revealed in the book,"[105] i.e. matters that are not covered by the holy text and need to be
regulated by legislation. This becomes evident from the "eighth leaf" of the Kalímát-i-
Firdawsíyyih where Bahá'u'lláh defines the functions and competences of the House of
Justice and promises to this body the assistance of the Holy Spirit: “It is incumbent upon
the Trustees of the House of Justice to take counsel together regarding those things which
have not outwardly been revealed in the Book, and to enforce that which is agreeable to
them. God will verily inspire them with whatsoever He willeth, and He, verily, is the
Provider, the Omniscient.”[106]

As we have already indicated, Bahá’u’lláh set forth numerous juridical and executive as
well as legislative functions to be carried out by the House of Justice. While, as Dr.
Schaefer has pointed out, the Guardian did not emphasize the juridical and executive
functions of the House of Justice, and chose instead to focus attention upon the legislative
calling of this Institution, he did not characterize the House of Justice as a purely
democratic institution. Indeed, the Guardian’s description of the future of Bahá’í
Administration should be cited in full and with appropriate commentary:

> “The Bahá'í Commonwealth of the future, of which this vast Administrative Order
> is the sole framework, is, both in theory and practice, not only unique in the entire
> history of political institutions, but can find no parallel in the annals of any of the
> world's recognized religious systems. No form of democratic government; no
> system of autocracy or of dictatorship, whether monarchical or republican; no
> intermediary scheme of a purely aristocratic order; nor even any of the recognized

> Christian ecclesiastical organizations, or the Imamate or the Caliphate in Islam —

> none of these can be identified or be said to conform with the Administrative
> Order which the master-hand of its perfect Architect has fashioned.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá charged Haji Mirza Afnan (the Afnan-i-Kabir) to establish the Universal
House of Justice in the event of His untimely death and without mentioning the
Guardianship:

> “Let us examine what the Master provided in His Will for the leadership of the
> Faith, in the event that He was martyred while Shoghi Effendi was still a child. In
> the second part of His Will the Master makes no mention of Shoghi Effendi or of

> when he could assume his responsibilities as Guardian. The language ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá uses in the second part of His Will refers only to the elected members of that
> Body. Therefore, in the following words the Master provided that the Universal
> House of Justice would act without the presence of the Guardian of the Cause of
> God, or the Guardian's representative, during the minority of Shoghi Effendi:

> "Unto the Most Holy Book every one must turn and all that is not expressly

throughout this paper.)

> “The Master here provided that it was incumbent upon "these members" to
> deliberate, and He identifies "these members" as those who were to be "elected

Also in Ishráqát, Bahá'u'lláh undoubtedly refers to the legislation when, after having
paid tribute to the "two pillars, reward and punishment" as the "sources of life to the
world" and after having mentioned that "for each day there is a new problem and for
every problem an expedient solution," he continues: "Such affairs should be referred to the
Universal House of Justice that the members thereof may act according the needs and
requirements of the time."[107] He also refers to legislation when he states shortly afterwards
that, "all matters of State should be referred to the House of Justice".[108] The same is true
when Bahá'u'lláh, dealing with the subject of interest, says that he "desisted from laying
down its limits"[109] and entrusts "the conduct of these affairs" to the "men of the House of
Justice."[110]

Whenever 'Abdu'l-Bahá mentions the Universal House of Justice it is clear that the
purpose of this body is future legislation.[111] He defines in his testament the purpose,
competences and functions of the House of Justice, "the source of all good and freed from
all error:"[112]

> Unto this body all things must be referred. It enacteth all ordinances and
> regulations that are not to be found in the explicit Holy Text. By this body all the
> difficult problems are to be resolved... This House of Justice enacteth the laws and
> the government [hukúmat] enforceth them.[113]

> Unto the Most Holy Book every one must turn and all that is not expressly
> recorded therein must be referred to the Universal House of Justice. That which
> this body, whether unanimously or by a majority doth carry, that is verily the
> truth and the purpose of God Himself.[114]

> ... It is incumbent upon these members (of the Universal House of Justice) to ...
> deliberate upon all problems which have caused difference, questions that are
> obscure and matters that are not expressly recorded in the Book.[115] Whatsoever
> they decide has the same effect as the Text itself... The House of Justice is both the
> Initiator and the Abrogator of its own laws.[116]

Bahá’u’lláh has written copiously on the subject of the House of Justice, in the Kitab-i-
Aqdas and in several Tablets revealed subsequent to this Book of Laws, including the
Bisharat, Kalimat-i-Firdawsiyyih, Lawh-i-Maqsud, and, most important of all, the Ishraqat.
These references have already been cited, and authority and responsibility has been
deduced from these statements which transcends a purely legislative function. However,
in our interpretation of the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh we are not left to our own devices,
inasmuch as He appointed ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as His interpreter and expounder, and so we
must look to the Centre of the Covenant for a correct understanding of Bahá’u’lláh’s
statements. Here assembled are a collection of statements which together convey the
substance of His views on the Universal House of Justice:

> For instance, the Universal House of Justice, if it be established under the
> necessary conditions — with members elected from all the people — that House of
> Justice will be under the protection and the unerring guidance of God. If that
> House of Justice shall decide unanimously, or by a majority, upon any question
> not mentioned in the Book, that decision and command will be guarded from
> mistake. Now the member of the House of Justice have not, individually, essential
> infallibility; but the body of the House of Justice is under the protection and
> unerring guidance of God: this is called conferred infallibility. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
> Some Answered Questions, pp. 172-173)

The wording is very exact, and if it corresponds to the wording of other like passages,
then it state unequivocally that whatever “the House of Justice shall decide unanimously,
or by a majority, upon any question not mentioned in the Book, that decision and
command will be guarded from mistake.” No restriction is contemplated in this wording

to the specific variety of “decision and command” that “will be guarded from mistake”
apart from it pertaining to “any question not mentioned in the Book”, meaning the
Writings of Bahá’u’lláh. This “decision and command” may be legislative, juridical or
executive.

> “All must consider themselves to be of the order of subjects, submissive and
> obedient to the commandments of God and the laws of the House of Justice.
> Should any deviate by so much as a needle's point from the decrees of the
> Universal House of Justice, or falter in his compliance therewith, then is he of the
> outcast and rejected.” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá, p. 68)

Here ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refers to the “laws of the House of Justice” and to “the decrees of the
Universal House of Justice”, and while the former reference is legislative, the latter
embraces the juridical and the executive as well.

The House of Justice is charged by Bahá’u’lláh as follows:

> “Unto every father hath been enjoined the instruction of his son and daughter in
> the art of reading and writing and in all that hath been laid down in the Holy
> Tablet. He that putteth away that which is commanded unto him, the Trustees are
> then to take from him that which is required for their instruction, if he be wealthy,

> in Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 128)

> “Should the father fail in his duty he must be compelled to discharge his
> responsibility, and should he be unable to comply, let the House of Justice take
> over the education of the children; in no case is a child to be left without an
> education.” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, pp. 127-

> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá here reiterates this commandment, and the specific language
> indicates that the House of Justice will “take from him [the father] that which is
> required for their instruction, if he be wealthy, and if not the matter devolveth
> upon the House of Justice” (Bahá’u’lláh) and “take over the education of the
> children” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá). The House of Justice is made ultimately responsible for
> the education of all children. This is not a purely legislative responsibility, as we

> precisely the division of the functions of government into three spheres which has

> Neither Bahá’u’lláh nor ‘Abdu’l-Bahá indicate here that it is the responsibility of

> “As to the difference between that material civilization now prevailing, and the

> (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, pp. 132, 132-133)

That the Universal House of Justice is envisioned by Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to be
responsible for the education of humanity (including the education of children) is attested
by this remarkable passage. The “divine civilization which will be one of the benefits to
derive from the House of Justice…so traineth every member of society that no one, with
the exception of a negligible few, will undertake to commit a crime.” The education of
humanity begins in the earliest years, as attested by many passages, including these:

> “Let the mothers consider that whatever concerneth the education of children is of
> the first importance. Let them put forth every effort in this regard, for when the
> bough is green and tender it will grow in whatever way ye train it. Therefore is it
> incumbent upon the mothers to rear their little ones even as a gardener tendeth his
> young plants. Let them strive by day and by night to establish within their
> children faith and certitude, the fear of God, the love of the Beloved of the worlds,
> and all good qualities and traits.” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p. 125)

> “O handmaids of the Merciful! Render ye thanks unto the Ancient Beauty that ye
> have been raised up and gathered together in this mightiest of centuries, this most
> illumined of ages. As befitting thanks for such a bounty, stand ye staunch and
> strong in the Covenant and, following the precepts of God and the holy Law,

> suckle your children from their infancy with the milk of a universal education,
> and rear them so that from their earliest days, within their inmost heart, their very
> nature, a way of life will be firmly established that will conform to the divine
> Teachings in all things. For mothers are the first educators, the first mentors; and
> truly it is the mothers who determine the happiness, the future greatness, the
> courteous ways and learning and judgement, the understanding and the faith of
> their little ones.” (Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, pp. 125-126)

> “There are certain pillars which have been established as the unshakeable
> supports of the Faith of God. The mightiest of these is learning and the use of the
> mind, the expansion of consciousness, and insight into the realities of the universe
> and the hidden mysteries of Almighty God. To promote knowledge is thus an
> inescapable duty imposed on every one of the friends of God. It is incumbent
> upon that Spiritual Assembly, that assemblage of God, to exert every effort to

> and the ways of God, and will, even as young plants, thrive and flourish in the
> soft-flowing waters that are the counsels and admonitions of the Blessed Beauty.”
> (Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p. 126)

When we consider the great importance ascribed to the education of children, and the
primacy of teaching the Cause for all Bahá’ís, it might well be claimed that the principal
responsibility of the Universal House of Justice is to take charge of the education of
humanity. While mentioned often in the authoritative Bahá’í literature as a legislature, this
may be to distinguish its function from that of the “chosen ones” of Bahá’u’lláh, the Centre
of the Covenant, the Guardian and his intended successors in the Guardianship—none of
whom were empowered to enact any legislation supplementary to the laws revealed by
Bahá’u’lláh. It certainly does not encompass the overall role of the House of Justice,
including this educational mandate, which is integral to its establishment of that divine
civilization which alone can translate the law of God into practice. If there are no receptive
souls to live by the law, the law is potential only. In one of His talks, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is
alleged to have made the following statement, which is cited here to illustrate the principle
under consideration:

> “The greatest philosophers without this Spirit are powerless, their souls lifeless,
> their hearts dead! Unless the Holy Spirit breathes into their souls, they can do no
> good work. No system of philosophy has ever been able to change the manners
> and customs of a people for the better. Learned philosophers, unenlightened by
> the Divine Spirit, have often been men of inferior morality; they have not
> proclaimed in their actions the reality of their beautiful phrases.” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
> Paris Talks, p. 165)

To bring this back to the education of children, He wrote:

> “The instruction of these children is even as the work of a loving gardener who
> tendeth his young plants in the flowering fields of the All-Glorious. There is no
> doubt that it will yield the desired results; especially is this true of instruction as to
> Bahá'í obligations and Bahá'í conduct, for the little children must needs be made
> aware in their very heart and soul that 'Bahá'í' is not just a name but a truth.

> Every child must be trained in the things of the spirit, so that he may embody all
> the virtues and become a source of glory to the Cause of God. Otherwise, the mere
> word 'Bahá'í', if it yield no fruit, will come to nothing.” (Selections from the
> Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p. 143)

> “Praise be to God, all such doors are closed in the Cause of Bahá'u'lláh for a
> special authoritative Centre hath been appointed — a Centre that solveth all
> difficulties and wardeth off all differences. The Universal House of Justice,
> likewise, wardeth off all differences and whatever it prescribeth must be accepted
> and he who transgresseth is rejected. But this Universal House of Justice which is
> the Legislature hath not yet been instituted.” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections from the
> Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p. 215)

In the above-cited passage ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refers to the Universal House of Justice as “the
Legislature” which “hath not yet been instituted”. Its designation as such does not reduce
its function to that one parameter.

> “And now, concerning the House of Justice which God hath ordained as the
> source of all good and freed from all error, it must be elected by universal
> suffrage, that is, by the believers. Its members must be manifestations of the fear of
> God and daysprings of knowledge and understanding, must be steadfast in God's
> faith and the well-wishers of all mankind. By this House is meant the Universal
> House of Justice, that is, in all countries a secondary House of Justice must be
> instituted, and these secondary Houses of Justice must elect the members of the
> Universal one. Unto this body all things must be referred. It enacteth all
> ordinances and regulations that are not to be found in the explicit Holy Text. By
> this body all the difficult problems are to be resolved and the Guardian of the
> Cause of God is its sacred head and the distinguished member for life of that
> body. Should he not attend in person its deliberations, he must appoint one to
> represent him. Should any of the members commit a sin, injurious to the common
> weal, the Guardian of the Cause of God hath at his own discretion the right to
> expel him, whereupon the people must elect another one in his stead. This House
> of Justice enacteth the laws and the government enforceth them. The legislative
> body must reinforce the executive, the executive must aid and assist the legislative
> body so that through the close union and harmony of these two forces, the
> foundation of fairness and justice may become firm and strong, that all the regions

> of the world may become even as Paradise itself.” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, The Will and
> Testament, pp. 14-15)

The passage above has engendered a great volume of speculation among its readers,
with some indicating that it limits the Universal House of Justice to a purely legislative
function, and claiming that the Bahá’í Administrative Order cannot function properly
without a governmental executive body to enforce its statutes. Others have noted the
absence of any reference to a juridical role for the Universal House of Justice in this
passage, and have concluded therefrom that Bahá’í courts would ultimately be established
which would be independent from the Universal House of Justice. Dr. Schaefer cites the
passage, "By this body all the difficult problems will be resolved" as indicative of the
legislative function of the Universal House of Justice. May I suggest a different
interpretation? It seems to me that the Centre of the Covenant has already delineated the
legislative function of the House by "It enacteth all ordinances and regulations that are not
to be found in the explicit Holy Text." I suggest that "all the difficult problems are to be
resolved" includes the functions of executive decision and judicial ruling as well as
elucidation. This impression is confirmed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá's statement that the Universal
House of Justice will "deliberate upon all problems which have caused difference,
questions that are obscure" (Will and Testament, p. 20). While the deliberations of the
House of Justice may result in supplementary legislation, it often results in elucidation of
existing legislation, in clarification of doctrinal and practice-related matters which are
already revealed in the Book, but which have been understood in various conflicting ways
by the believers. Furthermore, the Universal House of Justice is designated as a
governmental body in the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh and not merely a body for the
administration of religious affairs. (Bisharat in TB, p. 27; Ishraqat in TB, p. 129) Indeed, the
only separation made between the secular and the sacred in Bahá’u’lláh’s Divine Economy
is the separation made by rebellious humanity, and the insistence of non-believers upon
“doing their own thing” rather than on “doing the right thing”, which would be to choose
that which has been revealed in their best interests by the Manifestation of God.

The Universal House of Justice has directed its Secretariat to write a letter on its behalf,
in response to the discussions amongst readers of the Will and Testament as to the
meaning of these passages which refer to its functions and the parameters of its authority.
It is essential that we take into consideration the contents of this letter, inasmuch as “Unto
this body all things must be referred. It enacteth all ordinances and regulations that are not
to be found in the explicit Holy Text. By this body all the difficult problems are to be
resolved…” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, The Will and Testament, p. 14) and it is to “deliberate upon all
problems which have caused difference, questions that are obscure and matters that are
not expressly recorded in the Book. Whatsoever they decide has the same effect as the Text
itself.” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, The Will and Testament, p. 20). The following is an excerpt from this
letter, which was written to an individual believer and dated 27 April 1995:

> “The Administrative Order is certainly the nucleus and pattern of the World
> Order of Bahá'u'lláh, but it is in embryonic form, and must undergo major
> evolutionary developments in the course of time. Certain passages in the writings
> on this subject establish matters of principle, certain ones describe the ultimate
> goal of the Most Great Peace, and certain of the relate to stages of development on
> the way to the attainment of that goal. For example, in this familiar passage in His
> Will and Testament, 'Abdu'l-Bahá states:[5]

This House of Justice enacteth the laws and the government enforceth them. The
legislative body must reinforce the executive, the executive must aid and assist the
legislative body so that through the close union and harmony of these two forces, the
foundation of fairness and justice may become firm and strong, that all the regions of the
world may become even as Paradise itself.

In response to a question about the "government" in the above passage, Shoghi Effendi's
secretary wrote on his behalf, on 18 April 1941, the following clarification [6]:

> By "Government" ... is meant the executive body which will enforce the laws when
> the Bahá'í Faith has reached the point when it is recognized and accepted entirely
> by any particular nation.

> The same relationship between legislature and executive is expressed in the well-
> known passage in "The Unfoldment of World Civilization", showing how one
> principle is applied over successive periods [7]:

A world executive, backed by an international force, will carry out the decisions arrived
at, and apply the laws enacted by, this world legislature, and will safeguard the organic
unity of the whole commonwealth.

In relation to other international institutions, the Guardian has given the following
guidance [8]:

> Touching the point raised in the Secretary's letter regarding the nature and scope
> of the Universal Court of Arbitration, this and other similar matters will have to be
> explained and elucidated by the Universal House of Justice, to which, according to
> the Master's explicit Instructions, all important fundamental questions must be
> referred.

In his letter to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States and
Canada written on 27 February 1929, Shoghi Effendi stated [9]:

> Not only will the present-day Spiritual Assemblies be styled differently in future,
> but they will be enabled also to add to their present functions those powers,
> duties, and prerogatives necessitated by the recognition of the Faith of

> Bahá'u'lláh, not merely as one of the recognized religious systems of the world,
> but as the State Religion of an independent and Sovereign Power. And as the
> Bahá'í Faith permeates the masses of the peoples of East and West, and its truth is
> embraced by the majority of the peoples of a number of the Sovereign States of the
> world, will the Universal House of Justice attain the plenitude of its power, and
> exercise, as the supreme organ of the Bahá'í Commonwealth, all the rights, the
> duties, and responsibilities incumbent upon the world's future superstate.

It is apparent from a careful perusal of this letter, that the existence of an executive body
apart from the Universal House of Justice which would enforce the decisions of the House
is predicted in the “Will and Testament”, and also that such an executive body is not
required for the proper functioning of the Universal House of Justice. This executive body
appears to be, in any case, representative of a stage in the development of the Bahá’í
Commonwealth of the future, inasmuch as the Guardian indicates that “as the Bahá'í Faith
permeates the masses of the peoples of East and West, and its truth is embraced by the
majority of the peoples of a number of the Sovereign States of the world, will the Universal
House of Justice attain the plenitude of its power, and exercise, as the supreme organ of
the Bahá'í Commonwealth, all the rights, the duties, and responsibilities incumbent upon
the world's future super-state.” (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 6) A
super-state would appear not to be confined to the legislative function—that would
restrict its “rights”, its “duties” and its “responsibilities”. In the meantime, each stage of
the development of the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh has been endowed with the authority
and the assurance of divine protection that is required for the effective establishment of
the Kingdom of God on earth. The Centre of the Covenant and the Guardian functioned
without the existence of the Universal House of Justice. The Universal House of Justice is
functioning without the existence of a living and current Guardian present in its
consultations, assuming its presidency and complementing its functions. Likewise, the
House of Justice is exercising executive functions in the absence of an executive body apart
from itself. There is no indication in the authoritative literature, nor any admission on the
part of the Universal House of Justice that any of its decisions—whether we would regard
them as legislative, juridical or executive—is erroneous or that any of those decisions have

been reached without the divine protection of the Bab and Bahá’u’lláh and the inspiration
of the Holy Spirit. There are no “satanic verses”…there are no “satanic decisions” either.

Shoghi Effendi's references to the Universal House of Justice leave no doubt that the
ultimate purpose of this body is "to fill in those gaps which the author of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
has deliberately left in the body of His legislative and administrative ordinances;"[117] that
the Universal House of Justice "has been invested with the function of legislating on
matters not expressly revealed in the teachings," that it has the "exclusive right and
prerogative... to pronounce upon and deliver the final judgement on such laws and
ordinances as Bahá'u'lláh has not expressly revealed."[118]

The ultimate purpose of the Universal House of Justice, is to “attain the plenitude of its
power, and exercise, as the supreme organ of the Bahá'í Commonwealth, all the rights, the
duties, and responsibilities incumbent upon the world's future super-state.” (Shoghi
Effendi, The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 6) One of its major functions, both presently
and in the future, will be to supplement the laws revealed by Bahá’u’lláh with statutes
suited to the variable needs of humanity in the course of its evolution. The House of
Justice has other functions, some of which overlap between itself and the Guardian (and
before him the Centre of the Covenant). One of these overlaps which is neither specific to
the Guardian (interpretation) nor to the Universal House of Justice (legislation) is the
shared role of these two institutions as executors of the divine Plan—namely, "and to
enforce that which is agreeable to them." Bahá’u’lláh did not promise divine protection
and inspiration to the Universal House of Justice only for "taking counsel together
regarding those things which have not outwardly been revealed in the Book" but also "to
enforce that which is agreeable to them", for immediately following this second duty, He
writes "God will verily inspired them with whatsoever He willeth". The House is not just
protected in its legislative function, but also in its executive function. When the Guardian
decided it was time for the Western Bahá’ís to stop drinking alcoholic beverages, to stop
being members of churches and secret societies and political parties, he was exercising his
executive authority, and in doing so, according to the text of the Will and Testament, was
protected from error. When the Universal House of Justice decided it was time for the
Bahá’ís of the world to say the obligatory prayers preceded by ablutions and including all
of the bodily movements and postures, and when it ruled that it was time for the Bahá’ís
to chant the Allah'u'Abha 95 times a day, these were executive decisions, and they did

> "enforce that which is agreeable to them." This enactment is infallible, is it
> not? How can it be argued that the enforcement of Bahá’í law by either the
> Guardian or the Universal House of Justice is outside of that institution’s

> jurisdiction and not protected by the promise of divine inspiration as set forth in
> the Writings? Surely it is for the Guardian to determine which of his actions are
> divinely inspired, and for the Universal House of Justice to likewise define the
> parameters of its own responsibilities and divine protection. That it is left to the

> “is debarred from laying down independently the constitution that must govern
> the organized activities of his fellow-members…” (Shoghi Effendi, The World
> Order of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 149)

In a letter dated 27 May 1966, the Universal House of Justice addressed this matter:

> “However, quite apart from his function as a member and sacred head for life of
> the Universal House of Justice, the Guardian, functioning within his own sphere,
> had the right and duty "to define the sphere of the legislative action" of the
> Universal House of Justice. In other words, he had the authority to state whether a
> matter was or was not already covered by the Sacred Texts and therefore whether
> it was within the authority of the Universal House of Justice to legislate upon it.
> No other person, apart from the Guardian, has the right or authority to make such
> definitions. The question therefore arises: In the absence of the Guardian, is the
> Universal House of Justice in danger of straying outside its proper sphere and
> thus falling into error? Here we must remember three things: First, Shoghi Effendi,
> during the thirty-six years of his Guardianship, has already made innumerable
> such definitions, supplementing those made by 'Abdu'l-Bahá and by Bahá'u'lláh
> Himself. As already announced to the friends, a careful study of the Writings and
> interpretations on any subject on which the House of Justice proposes to legislate
> always precedes its act of legislation. Second, the Universal House of Justice, itself
> assured of Divine guidance, is well aware of the absence of the Guardian and will
> approach all matters of legislation only when certain of its sphere of jurisdiction, a
> sphere which the Guardian has confidently described as "clearly defined." Third,
> we must not forget the Guardian's written statement about these two institutions:
> "Neither can, nor will ever, infringe upon the sacred and prescribed domain of the
> other." (The Universal House of Justice, 1966 May 27, Guardianship and the UHJ)

As long as the Bahá’í Faith is still "in its infancy" and has not yet attained "the

[119]

plenitude of its power", there is little need for the House of Justice to exercise its

[120]

legislative powers. Indeed, there has so far been little in the way of legislation.

Since its establishment in 1963, the Universal House of Justice has issued thousands,
perhaps hundreds of thousands of decisions which, whether legislative, juridical or
executive, fall within the parameters of its stipulated authority and under the protection of
its promised infallibility. The rulings of the House which have pertained to personal
status, to membership in the community, to the application of Bahá’í law, to the integrity
of the Bahá’í teachings, to the application of the Bahá’í laws, all of these are related to its
responsibility to “deliberate upon all problems which have caused difference, questions
that are obscure and matters that are not expressly recorded in the Book.” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
The Will and Testament, p. 20)

The Universal House of Justice elucidates upon the meaning of elucidation in the
following letter:

> “In a letter dated 9 March 1965, the Universal House of Justice stresses the
> "profound difference" that exists between the "interpretations of the Guardian and
> the elucidations of the House of Justice in exercise of its function to 'deliberate
> upon all problems which have caused difference, questions that are obscure, and
> matters that are not expressly recorded in the Book."' (Wellspring of Guidance, p.
> 52) Among these is the outlining of such steps as are necessary to establish the
> World Order of Bahá'u'lláh on this earth. The elucidations of the Universal House
> of Justice stem from its legislative function, while the interpretations of the
> Guardian represent the true intent inherent in the Sacred Texts. The major
> distinction between the two functions is that legislation with its resultant outcome
> of elucidation is susceptible of amendment by the House of Justice itself, whereas
the Guardian's interpretation is a statement of truth which cannot be varied.”

(The Universal House of Justice, 1984 Oct 25, Universal House of Justice - Power
of Elucidation)

Inasmuch as “the elucidations of the Universal House of Justice stem from its legislative
function”, in this case the House has been very actively engaged in exercising its
legislative function over the course of its first forty three years of existence. Bahá’u’lláh
and His chosen ones did not indicate that the legislative role of the Universal House of
Justice would be manifested in a manner in any way resembling the enactments of
Western secular parliaments and congresses. Rather the texts depict a role unhampered
with any of the characteristics of an inflexible micromanagement, and limited in only one
way—the Universal House of Justice is forbidden to engage in the interpretation of the
Bahá’í Writings. The House is not forbidden to elucidate upon the application of that
meaning in the changing contexts encountered by human beings over the course of the
next thousand or more years before the appearance of a subsequent Manifestation of God.
Nor is the House forbidden to safeguard the purity and integrity of the Bahá’í teachings
from any who might wish to distort and appropriate them for their own selfish purposes.
Indeed, if the Universal House of Justice did not assume responsibility for these two

functions—which they have an in connection with their legislative function—it would be
impossible for the Bahá’í Faith to achieve its full potential and for the Bahá’í
Commonwealth to come into existence.

The only enactments made by the Universal House of Justice which I can discern as
constituting acts of legislation were:

•   its declaration on 6 October 1963 that the office of Guardian was to remain

permanently vacant,[121]

•   the establishment of the Continental Boards of Counsellors by its message to the

Bahá'í world of 24 June 1968,[122]

•   the enactment of the Constitution of the Universal House of Justice on 24 November

1972,[123]

•   the establishment of the International Teaching Centre by its message of 8 June

1973,[124]

•   the enactment of the law of the huququ'lláh by its Ridván message 1991,

•   the enactment of the ritual provisions of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas referring to the

> obligatory prayers, fasting and dhikr by its announcement to the Bahá'í world on 28

December 1999.

Certainly the learned and considered judgment of a senior professional in the field of
law, particularly one who has spent so many years studying Bahá’í laws and institutions
and writing and speaking about them to a large and well-educated audience must be
carefully considered. These enactments of the Universal House of Justice are indeed of
great significance, as attested by the letters which introduced their provisions to the Bahá’í
community at large. Conspicuous though in their absence are “the outlining of such steps
as are necessary to establish the World Order of Bahá'u'lláh on this earth.” (The Universal
House of Justice, 1984 Oct 25, Universal House of Justice - Power of Elucidation) The plans
which the Universal House of Justice has designed and supervised since 1963 certainly
qualify then as among the “steps as are necessary to establish the World Order of
Bahá’u’lláh on this earth.” The decision taken by the Universal House of Justice to change
Bahá’í culture by calling upon the community to establish children’s classes, study circles
and devotional gatherings, in preparation for the inevitable “entry by troops” is surely
such a legislative enactment.

The activities of the Universal House of Justice have, up to now, been purely
administrative in nature, with the exception of those judicial decisions made on the basis
of article VIII of its constitution. Since Shoghi Effendi foresees a time when "officially
constituted Bahá'í courts" will be in existence,[125] the question arises as to whether the
House of Justice will retain its judicial function as set out in its constitution. In the course
of time, the judicial and executive functions of this institution will certainly give way to its
main task of legislation, whose importance will steadily increase.

The thousands of decisions made by the Universal House of Justice can hardly be
dismissed as “administrative”, and this is particularly problematic inasmuch as there is no
definition of administrative duties in the Bahá’í authoritative literature. Indeed, this
literature refers to the interpretive, legislative, juridical and executive functions of Bahá’í
Administration. In the passage alluded to by Dr. Schaefer, the Guardian stated that “The
day may not be far distant when in certain countries of the East, in which religious
communities exercise jurisdiction in matters of personal status, Bahá'í Assemblies may be
called upon to assume the duties and responsibilities devolving upon officially constituted
Bahá'í courts. They will be empowered, in such matters as marriage, divorce, and
inheritance, to execute and apply, within their respective jurisdictions, and with the
sanction of civil authorities, such laws and ordinances as have been expressly provided in
their Most Holy Book.” (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 200) It is then
the Spiritual Assemblies which “may be called upon to assume the duties and
responsibilities devolving upon official constituted Bahá’í courts”, rather than the
establishment of Bahá’í courts *apart from* the existing Bahá’í Administrative Order.

That this was the Guardian’s intention is demonstrated also by these statements
regarding the Bahá’ís of Egypt:

> “Hitherto regarded as a sect of Islam, the Bahá'ís of Egypt, who for the most part
> are of Muslim origin, and unable therefore to refer for purposes of marriage and
> divorce to the recognized religious tribunals of any other denomination, find
> themselves in consequence in a delicate and anomalous position. They have
> naturally resolved to refer their case to the Egyptian Government, and have
> prepared for this purpose a petition to be addressed to the head of the Egyptian
> Cabinet. In this document they have set forth the motives compelling them to seek
> recognition from their rulers, have asserted their readiness and their qualifications
> to exercise the functions of an independent Bahá'í court, have assured them of
> their implicit obedience and loyalty to the State, and of their abstinence from
> interference in the politics of their country.” (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of
> Bahá’u’lláh, p. 10)

> “For their petition is chiefly concerned with a formal request for recognition by the
> highest civil authorities in Egypt of the Egyptian National Spiritual Assembly as a
> recognized and independent Bahá'í court, free and able to execute and apply in all
> matters of personal status such laws and ordinances as have been promulgated by
> Bahá'u'lláh in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.” (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of
> Bahá’u’lláh, pp. 11-12)

The formal establishment of a Bahá’í Court, with the implication thereby of validating
the existence of Bahá’í law and permitting the adjudication of that law by representatives
of the Bahá’í community is a stage in the step by step development of the Faith, from
obscurity to the Golden Age of the Bahá’í Commonwealth. The Guardian wrote in "Citadel
of Faith" (pp. 94-95), a description of the steps which must take place in the evolution of
the World Centre of the Faith, from the International Bahá’í Council, to "the emergence in
the course of time of a properly recognized and independently functioning Bahá'í court"
and, the "consummation" of this process, "in the institution of the Universal House of
Justice..." Similar statements in letters are found in "Messages to the Bahá’í World" (pp. 8,
13, 42, 148), and in a letter cited in the same collection (p. 152), he goes even further,
referring to "the transformation of the International Bahá'í Council into an international
Bahá'í court". In a letter included in "Dawn of a New Day" (p. 157), Shoghi Effendi does
refer to the establishment of Bahá’í courts, but without elucidating. In this case he may
also have envisaged a process of evolution, from Local Spiritual Assemblies to Bahá’í
courts to local Houses of Justice. In another letter, dated October 1953 ("Dawn of a New
Day", p. 170; also see p. 213 and "Messages to the Bahá’í World", pp. 42, 139 and "The
Advent of Divine Justice", p. 14), the Guardian refers to the "establishment of a national
Bahá’í Court in the capital cities of Persia, of Iraq, of Pakistan and of Afghanistan-the
leading Muslim centres in the Asiatic continent" as one of the goals of the Ten Year
Crusade. Were these national Bahá’í courts to evolve eventually into national Houses of
Justice? It is not clear from the context. But in view of the more precisely elaborated
references to the Egyptian case cited earlier, it is reasonable to conclude that the
acceptance of the validity of Bahá’í law for members of the Bahá’í community and of the
validity of Bahá’í institutions for adjudicating that law will result in the enhancement of
the already functioning juridical role of the Spiritual Assembly, both at the local and
national level. That the Spiritual Assembly is intended to be a juridical entity is hard to
contest, in view of it eventually assuming the more appropriate appellation of House of
Justice. Hence it is much more likely that the Universal House of Justice will serve as the
Supreme Court of that Commonwealth than that this function should devolve to any other
Institution, inasmuch as the decisions of the Universal House of Justice are protected from
error, and no other Institution can claim such protection.

It should be noted that the spheres of competence mentioned in the holy text along with
supplementary legislation, i.e. to resolve "all the difficult problems,"[126] to "deliberate upon
problems which have caused differences, questions that are obscure,"[127] are to be counted
as legislative functions.[128] The context[129] reveals clearly that this refers not to ad hoc
executive/administrative or judicial decisions, but to decisions that are of general,
universal relevance.

The fact that pneumatic direction, unerring guidance,[130] has been promised by
Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu'l-Bahá in the context of those scriptural passages that define the
legislative competence of this body, and is accompanied on every occasion by a reference
to the "Book" or the "Holy Text",[131] is strong support for the suggested restrictive
interpretation according to which infallibility covers only acts of legislation.[132] The "Book",
the "Holy Text", is of universal validity. From this it can be concluded that only those
decisions are "infallible" that are likewise of universal validity, whereas decisions
concerning individual cases are not covered by the charisma, because they have no legal
relevance for the world community.

A third reason to support a restrictive interpretation of conferred infallibility relates to
certain logical arguments. Like any other decision-making body the Universal House of
Justice is dependent on information,[133] but the quality of this information varies according
to the level on which the decision is made. At the executive and judicial levels, knowledge
of the historical facts of a specific case is required, while at the legislative level what is
needed is general knowledge of the matters to be regulated.

The Universal House of Justice has itself associated “the spheres of competence
mentioned in the holy text along with supplementary legislation” with elucidation and
elucidation with its legislative function. However, elucidation is not restricted to
“decisions that are of general, universal relevance”. And who is to determine which
decisions fall into this category and which are “ad hoc executive/administrative or judicial
decisions”? That role would presumably fall to the “learned in Baha’”, inasmuch as the
rank and file would be presumed incapable of discerning these distinctions; or, should
they be exercised by the masses, their views would require that a vote be taken to
determine the distinction between each of the various decisions taken by the Universal
House of Justice. Both of these measures are contravened by Bahá’í principle, inasmuch as
it is the Universal House of Justice and not the “learned in Baha’” who are empowered by
the Bahá’í Writings to make all decisions and distinctions, and because popular acclaim is
not recognized as an indicator of harmony with the Divine Will. The Universal House of
Justice has delineated its responsibilities in its Constitution, and it is wholly more in
keeping with the spirit and letter of the Bahá’í Writings to regard all of its elucidations as
divinely inspired than to try to pick and choose for ourselves.

As to Dr. Schaefer’s argument that “only those decisions are "infallible" that are likewise
of universal validity”, this would call into question every specific and non-universal
elucidation of the Universal House of Justice, over the course of the past forty three years,
and subject the Supreme Institution to a scrutiny on the part of its adherents that is hardly
compatible with the ideal of instant, exact and complete obedience which has motivated
countless believers over the course of the past century and a half. Particularities pertaining
to individuals when addressed by the Universal House of Justice would then be assured
no protection from error, and this is inconceivable in view of the assurances of the Central
Figures and Guardian of the Faith to its stalwart believers. If this is truly a Day not to be
followed by night, then the believers must be able to count on the Universal House of
Justice in all things and at all times. A pick and choose approach can not unify humanity
or govern the affairs of millions, let alone billions of souls.

The second reason for supporting a restrictive interpretation is Dr. Schaefer’s allegation
that those passages which refer to the divine protection to be accorded to the Universal
House of Justice are associated in all cases with “the legislative competence of this body”.
This has already been discussed in some detail previously in this paper. Furthermore, the
text of the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá overrides any doubts and distinctions we
might be tempted to make, along purely rational lines, and not considering the larger
question of the incomparable responsibility of the Universal House of Justice and its
incomparable need for divine guidance in all of its decisions:

> “Whatsoever they decide is of God. Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth
> them, hath not obeyed God; whoso rebelleth against him and against them hath
> rebelled against God; whoso opposeth him hath opposed God; whoso contendeth
> with them hath contended with God; whoso disputeth with him hath disputed
> with God; whoso denieth him hath denied God; whoso disbelieveth in him hath
> disbelieved in God; whoso deviateth, separateth himself and turneth aside from
> him hath in truth deviated, separated himself and turned aside from God.”
> (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, The Will and Testament, p. 11)

> “For he is, after 'Abdu'l-Bahá, the Guardian of the Cause of God, the Afnan, the
> Hands (pillars) of the Cause and the beloved of the Lord must obey him and turn
> unto him. He that obeyeth him not, hath not obeyed God; he that turneth away
> from him, hath turned away from God and he that denieth him, hath denied the

> of the Cause and the House of Justice. And he that turneth unto whatsoever else is
> indeed in grievous error.” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, The Will and Testament, pp. 25-26)

In a Tablet cited in one of the letters of the Universal House of Justice, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
articulates the divine guidance that protects the Universal House of Justice from error in
very emphatic language:

> “Let it not be imagined that the House of Justice will take any decision according
> to its own concepts and opinions. God forbid! The Supreme House of Justice will
> take decisions and establish laws through the inspiration and confirmation of the
> Holy Spirit, because it is in the safekeeping and under the shelter and protection of
> the Ancient Beauty, and obedience to its decisions is a bounden and essential duty
> and an absolute obligation, and there is no escape for anyone.” (The Universal
> House of Justice, Messages 1963 to 1986, p. 85)

As to the first category, the ascertainment of historical facts, the House of Justice is
dependent on others. The factual information necessary for executive and judicial
decisions is gathered by subordinate institutions or individuals. An infallible decision
would require that, in every case, the factual information provided were absolutely error-
free. How should that be possible? There can be no guarantee that all the facts relevant to
the decision are indeed compiled, and that these are correctly assessed as to their
respective importance before being conveyed to the Universal House of Justice. If this
cannot be guaranteed, then there can be no guarantee on the absolute correctness of
decisions made at these levels. The correctness of any decision in such an instance is
conditional: it depends on the correctness and absolute reliability of the information
provided concerning the matter in hand. Conditional infallibility, however, is a
contradiction in terms. A decision that is based on fragmentary or wrongly transmitted
relevant facts cannot be guaranteed to be correct. The Universal House of Justice's
statement that a decision can be "corrected" when "new facts emerge"[134] confirms this
interpretation.

Dr. Schaefer argues that “an infallible decision would require that, in every case, the
factual information provided were absolutely error-free.” He asks, “How should that be
possible?” He argues that “conditional infallibility…is a contradiction in terms.” It should
be noted that Bahá’u’lláh made many statements that referred to factual information that
has subsequently been regarded as erroneous. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá did likewise and in addition
He made many decisions that were based on factual information which may well have
been inaccurate or so sparse as to be potentially misleading. Shoghi Effendi likewise made
all sorts of statements and decisions which have been critiqued as relying on erroneous or
insufficient information. This raises the question of “just what is infallibility” and “why
claim infallibility for anyone, anytime, under any circumstances”? The foundation of the

doctrine of the Most Great Infallibility of the Manifestation of God is that God knows all
things, and that whatever He reveals through His Manifestation is true without any doubt
for it comes from the Source of Truth Itself. In the Ishraqat, Bahá’u’lláh states that
whatever the Manifestation of God reveals as true is true no matter how different it may
be from our conceptions of the truth. It follows then, if the Manifestation is infallible in His
revelation of the truth, that Whomever He chooses to explain His teachings and to
elaborate on His revelation must likewise be infallible, although in a different way.
Bahá’u’lláh writes about this difference of degree in the Ishraqat, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá talks
about it in Some Answered Questions. Furthermore, if the Manifestation of God
establishes an institution and promises that this institution will receive divine protection in
its deliberations and that it will be protected from error as a consequence, then it must be
so. Finally, the elaborations on the character of this institution and its divine protection
which have issued from the pen of the chosen one (and His chosen successor, in both the
case of the Bahá’í Faith and the religion of Islam), then those elaborations are also
protected from error. What then is the nature of this protection from error? Is it a
guarantee that the chosen one or the institution assured such protection will never cite
wrong information or will be perfect in all things? Or is it an assurance that the one
designated for such protection will not corrupt the message of the Manifestation, will not
lead His flock astray, will not err in its guidance of the faithful in the ways of the Faith? I
think the latter. If we are looking for a one to one correspondence between every fact and
every detail of what a Manifestation says and does on the one hand and reality as it
appears to us at any given point in time, based on our discoveries both pertaining to the
past and to the present, then we are going to be disappointed and disillusioned. There are
many points found in the Sacred Writings of every religion, including the Bahá’í Faith,
which will not be in harmony with the conceptions and the knowledge of men and women
in one culture and time or another. There are many which will appear to be contradictory
to common sense notions of reality, of good, of progress, of happiness, of beauty and truth,
and even more that will offend our sentimental attachment to tradition, custom and
personal preference. Much of what the Manifestation will teach will seem impractical to
pragmatists and subversive to conservatives. And any one with a taste for reform will be
sure to wish for reformations in whatever that Manifestation may choose to prescribe. But
the underlining message embodied in the doctrine of infallibility is that the buck has to
stop somewhere, there has to be a final authority, social order depends on the presence of
a “sure handle”, a stable and secure reference point, and the best of all standards for
appropriation to this purpose is that standard revealed by the Almighty through the
agency of His Manifestation, and through His Word, as preserved in His Book.

Consequently, if we encounter an affirmation in the Book which contradicts our
received knowledge, our common sense, even our deeply cherished ideals and values, if
the Book is to be the standard around which all of humanity will construct a new
civilization, then we must be prepared to sacrifice our individual prejudices and

preferences and adhere selflessly to this universal standard, which is in harmony with the
“essential infallibility” of the Manifestation. Likewise, if the Centre of the Covenant or the
Guardian gives an interpretation of Bahá’u’lláh that we do not care for, we are likewise
called upon to realize that in comparison with the “conferred infallibility” of the chosen
ones our ideas are “vain imaginings” and “idle fancies”. Finally, and to the point for this
paper, if the Universal House of Justice makes a decision with which we disagree, it is our
obligation to detach ourselves from our opinions and to adhere to that decision, not
because blind obedience is enjoined upon us, but rather because we are called to a higher
and more comprehensive vision in which we will comprehend, gradually and according to
our various gifts and capacities, that whatever the House has decided is in the best
interests both of humanity as a whole and each one of us individually. As Bahá’u’lláh
writes in the Seven Valleys, that he who attains to the holistic vision of truth “is content
with the decree of God, and seeth war as peace, and findeth in death the secrets of
everlasting life.” (Seven Valleys, p. 12)

The situation is different in the case of legislation (that is, the establishment of general
abstract norms) and of decisions on specific issues of universal relevance.[135] In these cases,
the decision is made at the abstract level of norms; it is independent of any concrete
historical case and the ascertainment of its relevant facts. What is required is general
information. Here, too, the Universal House of Justice needs to inquire into the conditions
of all aspects of the matter to be regulated and to know the legal dogmatic implications[136]
of legislation. However, legislation is not dependent on the clarification of historical data
and the provision of facts by other institutions or individuals that always remain fallible.
The House of Justice is thus independent from the necessarily fallible acts of other
institutions or individuals. This independence of the supreme body is a logical
precondition for a decision that is free of error.

Inasmuch as no such distinction made between issues which are particular and
individual on the one hand and those which are of universal relevance on the other in any
of the Bahá’í authoritative literature, there seems to be no basis for this approach in the
construction of Bahá’í jurisprudence. On the contrary, the Universal House of Justice is at
liberty to legislate upon any matter whatsoever that is not already revealed in the Book,
that is, specified in the revealed corpus of the Bahá’í Faith. There is also no restriction
placed on its supplementary legislation in those guidelines. The protection from error, the
divine inspiration promised for its legislative enactments is not limited to one domain or
another—it comprises all aspects of human society, of human life. In order to arrive at its
enactments, the Universal House of Justice is obligated to be informed of the contents of
the Bahá’í Writings, and to be guided by those Writings and their infallible interpretation

by the Centre of the Covenant and Guardian. There is no requirement that the House of
Justice be informed about everything relating to any case it may take up. The information
that is supplied to the House may be flawed or even completely erroneous; based on that
information though and the guidance of the Book, the House will make a determination,
inspired by the Holy Spirit, that will reflect and embody the law of God made manifest in
the world.

Its enactments are truly divine law rather than human law. And while the enactment of
the House may taste like poison, adherence to it will be the true remedy for whatever
ailment has afflicted its petitioner. This promise has been given to the believers even in the
case of the Spiritual Assembly, to which no protection from error has been accorded:

> "It is incumbent upon every one not to take any step without consulting the
> Spiritual Assembly, and they must assuredly obey with heart and soul its bidding
> and be submissive unto it, that things may be properly ordered and well arranged.
> Otherwise every person will act independently and after his own judgment, will
> follow his own desire, and do harm to the Cause."(`Abdu'l-Bahá, cited in a letter
> dated 5 March 1922 written by Shoghi Effendi to the Bahá'ís of the United States of
> America and Canada, published in "Bahá'í Administration: Selected Messages
> 1922-1932", p. 21)

When believers are told that “they must assuredly obey with heart and soul” the bidding
of the Spiritual Assembly, how much moreso must they embrace the decision of the
Universal House of Justice, which, unlike the Spiritual Assembly, is assured protection
from error and infallible inspiration from the Holy Spirit?

What is the purpose of an infallible legislature? The seal of immunity to error means
that the law passed by the Universal House of Justice constitutes sacred law, which is
qualitatively different from any ius humanum and is ascribed in the hierarchy of law to
the divine law (ius divinum).[137] Infallibility is expressed in different categories.[138] The
sphere of interpretation is governed by the categories "true-false." An infallible
interpretation is one that is absolutely "true;" it is a manifestation of divine truth. The law
enacted by an infallible legislature is not "true" but rather "just." Therefore an infallible
legislation means an enactment of legal norms that are in accordance with divine justice.
Both the divine law of the revelation and the laws that result from the supplementary
legislation of the Universal House of Justice constitute that divine justice, the advent of
which Bahá'u'lláh has prophesied: "The reign of justice will assuredly be established
amongst the children of men, and the effulgence of its light will envelop the whole
earth."[139]

Infallible decisions are "the Truth and the Purpose of God himself,"[140] they are
manifestations of the divine will. In principle, such decisions are as unchangeable for
human beings as the will of God. Just as the will of God cannot be "corrected", infallible
acts are not liable to "correction."

The Guardian's interpretations of the holy writ are infallible and – as they are "of God" –
unchangeable until the next divine revelation. The legislation of the House of Justice is
infallible and – as its laws are "the Truth and the Purpose of God Himself"[141] – they would
not be liable to abrogation had 'Abdu'l-Bahá not provided an explicit provision in his
Testament, according to which the Universal House of Justice has not only the power "to
enact laws that are not explicitly recorded in the Book," but also "the power to repeal the
same."[142] Only by virtue of this clausula salvatoria is the House of Justice empowered to
abrogate its own legislation and to adapt the law "to the exigencies of the time"[143] so that it
is "the Initiator and the Abrogator of its own laws."[144]

If one extends infallibility to decisions of the House of Justice in the sphere of its
administrative, executive and judicial powers, this body would not be empowered to
correct its own judgements when new facts have emerged, since the text does not contain
such an explicit provision for decisions outside the supplementary legislation. This result
would be unacceptable. I think this is one more argument for my view that executive and
judicial decisions are not covered by infallibility and are therefore liable to change.

Dr. Schaefer’s claim that the Universal House of Justice is not “empowered to correct its
own judgements when new facts have emerged, since the text does not contain such an
explicit provision for decisions outside the supplementary legislation” is contradicted by
statements of Bahá’u’lláh and His chosen interpreters. To begin with, if the emergence of
new facts renders judgements fallible, then the Manifestations of God fail to meet this
standard, inasmuch as “every time the Prophets of God have illumined the world with the
resplendent radiance of the Day Star of Divine knowledge, they have invariably
summoned its peoples to embrace the light of God through such means as best befitted the
exigencies of the age in which they appeared.” (Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings from the Writings
of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 80)

> “The difference between the ordinances under which they abide should be
> attributed to the varying requirements and exigencies of the age in which they
> were revealed.” (Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 217)

Hence, inasmuch as new facts have emerged over time, then the secondary ordinances
of the religion of God have changed to fit these new circumstances. Indeed, within His
prophetic ministry, the Manifestation of God has occasionally changed His revealed laws
to adapt to the developing exigencies He encountered. For example, Jesus initially

addressed His teachings to the Jewish people, and subsequently to the Samaritans and
then to all of humanity; Jesus set the Qiblih as Jerusalem originally, and then changed it to
Mecca; Bahá’u’lláh prescribed an obligatory prayer of 19 repeated verses, and
subsequently revealed three obligatory prayers from which His adherents were at liberty
to choose on a daily basis. The declaration of the claims of the Manifestation is, in most
cases, gradual in its disclosure, in response to the exigencies of the situation in which He
appears. Now, turning to the institution of the Universal House of Justice, Bahá’u’lláh
wrote:

> “Inasmuch as for each day there is a new problem and for every problem an
> expedient solution, such affairs should be referred to the Ministers of the House of
> Justice that they may act according to the needs and requirements of the time.”
> (Bahá’u’lláh, Bisharat, in TB, p. 27; Ishraqat, in TB, p. 129)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá reiterated:

> “Thus for example, the House of Justice enacteth today a certain law and enforceth
> it, and a hundred years hence, circumstances having profoundly changed and the
> conditions having altered, another House of Justice will then have power,
> according to the exigencies of the time, to alter that law.” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, The Will
> and Testament, p. 20)

Shoghi Effendi cited both statements:

> “Not only does 'Abdu'l-Bahá confirm in His Will Bahá'u'lláh's above-quoted
> statement["It is incumbent upon the members of the House of Justice," Bahá'u'lláh,
> on the other hand, declares in the Eighth Leaf of the Exalted Paradise, "to take
> counsel together regarding those things which have not outwardly been revealed
> in the Book, and to enforce that which is agreeable to them.” (Shoghi Effendi, The
> World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 149)], but invests this body with the additional
> right and power to abrogate, according to the exigencies of time, its own
> enactments, as well as those of a preceding House of Justice. "Inasmuch as the

> also it hath power to repeal the same... This it can do because these laws form no
> part of the divine explicit text." (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh,
> p. 149)

Hence, it is flexibility in response to the needs of humanity, not immutability that is the
principal attribute of this supplementary legislation of the Universal House of Justice.

In this context it should be noted that the abrogation of a law given by the Universal
House of Justice in order to supersede it by a new law that is appropriate to the changed
conditions, and the canceling of a decision in the sphere of executive or judicial power
because new facts have emerged, have different qualities. By the abrogation of one of its
laws the House of Justice does not "correct" its former legislation, it is rather adapting it to
the changed conditions on earth.[145] 'Abdu'l-Bahá has made it clear that only
"circumstances having profoundly changed and conditions having altered" legitimates the
House of Justice's abrogating and adapting of its own laws to the "exigencies of the
time."[146] A relatively long period has been envisioned, as 'Abdu'l-Bahá speaks of "another
House of Justice" (perhaps only after a complete change of its membership) and
exemplifies this with "a hundred years." There is no contradiction between these two acts
of legislation, each one was perfectly appropriate to the conditions of the time. The change
of a decision related to the administrative and judicial power of the House in the same
matter after new facts have emerged is of a different quality. However one looks at it, the
change due to new facts is a correction. There are two contradictory judgements of which
only one can be true. If one claims infallibility for all administrative or judicial decisions of
the House of Justice, a crucial question arises as to how one can cope in a reasonable way
with contradictory decisions of the same House of Justice on the same matter. How is one
to escape the logical dilemma? I think the claim to infallibility for both decisions is
untenable; it cannot be maintained without violating the principles of logical thinking.

The "infallibility" of an erroneous and therefore corrected decision cannot be upheld by
means of the sophistical argument that the (wrong) decision would have been free of error
if the facts on which it had been based had been correct. This would amount to a merely
hypothetical infallibility, whereby it is not the decision itself that is infallible, but rather the
process by which it was arrived at. This sort of argument would reduce the principle to an
absurdity. Thus the fact that such decisions are liable to correction appears to me to
constitute another rational argument that these decisions are not covered by the conferred
charisma of infallibility.

There are no cases of erroneous decisions which have been corrected by the Universal
House of Justice, so this is really a moot point. That in itself is proof of the extraordinary
and indeed incomparable character of this Institution—what other institution has not
made legions of erroneous decisions which had to be corrected? However let us consider
the possibility that a decision may have been made on the basis of erroneous or
deceptively limited information—would that decision be erroneous? The wisdom and will
of God work in mysterious ways. We do not know to what extent the decisions of the
Universal House of Justice are based on available information, collected through human
and therefore fallible sources, and to what extent they are the result of the inspiration of
the Holy Spirit. In serving as a member of three Spiritual Assemblies, nascent local Houses

of Justice, it was my experience that we sometimes made decisions which bore little
relation to the information available and which were instead based upon our
understanding of Bahá’í laws and principles, or upon our perceived inspiration upon
reaching consensus. If this is what is experienced in the level of the local House of Justice,
it may be that the Universal House of Justice is guided in a similar fashion…in fact,
inasmuch as the House of Justice is assured of divine inspiration and protection from
error, it is even more likely that the House should experience decision-making in a manner
that transcends mere information. Inasmuch as obedience to the House of Justice, at every
level of its establishment but particularly in the case of the Universal House of Justice, is
required of all believers, it seems likely that any decision in response to new or corrected
or upgraded information will not render any previous decision “wrong”—it is simply
abrogated. As pointed out already, the Manifestation of God is able to abrogate laws from
Dispensation to Dispensation, and within a single prophetic ministry, and we do not point
to these abrogated laws as evidence of the fallibility of the Manifestations. The abrogation
of laws by the Universal House of Justice is no more improbable or subject to fallibility.

In a passage from the Kitab-i-Iqan, Bahá’u’lláh points to the resistance of many
religionists to the abrogation of any law, especially from those who are particularly
zealous in their adherence to the law. In the Seven Proofs, the Bab warns religionists not to
be fanatical and overly observant, and to realize that recognizing the new Manifestation of
God and following His new laws is the true path to God and to His good-pleasure, rather
than the stubborn adherence to the old Manifestation and His laws. He cites in this
connection an Islamic tradition which states that “one hour’s reflection is preferable to
seventy years of pious worship.” (Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 238) Indeed, even as the abrogation of
laws by the new Manifestation of God is one of the means whereby the faith of men is
tested, it could likewise be attested that this abrogation of laws by the Universal House of
Justice is one of the means whereby the faith of the believers is tested. If the House follows
one decision with another in close succession and this has the appearance of constituting a
correction to the first, some of the believers will find their faith tested by this act of
abrogation and new legislation. However, this test of faith is not proof of the fallibility of
either the first or the second decision, nor of any decision taken by the House of Justice.
The test of faith is a means whereby the soul is purified, and brought closer to the divine
good-pleasure. Without tests we are utterly unable to acquire perfections and without
perfections we have no spiritual life.

A fourth support for this view derives from the implications of a claim to unlimited
infallibility. Such a claim would have far-reaching consequences. It would imply that
decisions in even the most trivial, daily routine affairs are included and covered by
infallibility. Should, for instance, the appointment of a person responsible for certain
functions at the Bahá'í world centre be seen as an "infallible" decision, an embodiment of

the will of God with the result that this appointment has "the same effect as the Text
itself"?[147] Should such a decision be one of "the ordinances and regulations that are not to
be found in the explicit holy text"?[148] What if the individual appointed to the position
were to fail to fulfil what was expected of them? Claiming this charisma for such things
would reduce it ad absurdum and trivialise the will of God and the august concept of
infallibility. This cannot be the intention of the text.

I think it is obvious that infallibility cannot be claimed for decisions in such relatively
trivial matters.[149] If one tries to exclude them and to restrict the sphere of the infallible to
more essential issues,[150] the question arises as to the criteria for delineating the boundaries
for those administrative or judicial decisions for which infallibility should be maintained. I
do not see any such criteria.

To claim infallibility for virtually everything that has been decided by the Universal House
of Justice, without exception, would be, in my opinion, extremely risky and utterly
unwise. Such an interpretation of the infallibility of the House of Justice is untenable and
indefensible and could easily become its Achilles heel. There are undoubtedly many
people zealously searching and taking great pains in order to find one single evident error
which would suffice to disprove empirically and for all time the infallibility of the House
of Justice. One single error would suffice for a "falsification" of the claim to infallibility.[151]
I am sure that an extensive interpretation of this concept would lead to never-ending
queries and unresolved discussions, and Bahá'ís would constantly feel obliged to refute
the ongoing accusations.

It is for the Universal House of Justice, guided by the Writings and interpretations of
the chosen ones, to determine the parameters of its own infallibility. This has been set forth
in a number of letters, and in its Constitution. The Universal House of Justice has never
claimed and will never claim an unlimited infallibility. Even the Manifestations of God do
not claim unlimited infallibility, for, in comparison with God, they are limited. The House
is not infallible in its interpretation of the divine Word, nor in a host of other actions which
are not covered by its revealed mandate. Let us consider this whole question of unlimited
infallibility from the top down, that is, beginning with the Manifestation of God.
Bahá’u’lláh indicates that the Manifestation of God is endowed by nature with the Most
Great Infallibility, and that everything He does is correct and everything He says or writes
is true and good and beautiful. Furthermore, He asserts that it is not for the human being
to judge the Manifestation of God, His Revelation, His Teachings, His Laws, and His
Book—the Manifestation is the standard by which all other things are to be weighed and
evaluated.

According to human standards the Manifestation and everything associated with Him
may appear to be imperfect. For over two centuries, serious scholars of Scripture have
pointed out what they regarded as imperfections in the Word—in grammar, in historical
accounts, in moral instructions, in doctrinal representations, in the use of symbolism—and
have claimed a human origin for all of these supposed imperfections and denied the need
for or likelihood of a divine source. MacEoin (and before him Nicolas) pointed out the
erroneous astronomical ideas in the Writings of the Bab. Cole identified certain erroneous
historical views in the Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh. From a purely secular humanist perspective,
the Bab and Bahá’u’lláh cited ideas which may have been current in their respective circles
of association, but which are erroneous in the light of contemporary scientific knowledge.
The Bahá’í apologist Mirza Abu’l-Fadl Gulpaygani responded to such seeming historical
and scientific inaccuracies found in Scripture by asserting that the prophet of God is
neither an historian nor a scientist (see “Duraru’l-Bahiyya”). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, on the other
hand, in a Tablet addressed to Ethel Rosenberg, stated that the Manifestation of God is the
ultimate in historical sources—once He has demonstrated the truth of His claims,
whatever He says or writes is the truth. In Some Answered Questions He points out an
instance where the Qur’an reveals a truth that was not discovered by scientists until
several hundred years after it was revealed, and contrary to all of the opinions of the
learned ones during those intervening centuries. On the other hand, while Bahá’u’lláh in
the Lawh-i-Hikmat seems to locate Pythagoras at the time of King David, which is stated
by Shoghi Effendi in his interpretive role as occurring in the late 9th and early 10th century
BCE, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His interpretive role dates Pythagoras in the 6th century BCE in the
“Lawh-i-Aflakiyyih”. So, where do we go from here? Two solutions have been proposed:
the first, that, as Mirza Abu’l-Fadl wrote, the prophet is not an historian, and when He
cites historical material it is in order to communicate with His audience in a particular
cultural context and does not constitute an endorsement of the particular historical
material in itself. In other words, the prophet cites historical material in order to convey a
metaphysical, indeed a metahistorical truth, and we should not allow ourselves to be
veiled from that truth by the particular circumstances related to its communication. This is
akin to the approach Bahá’u’lláh advocates for the interpretation of the symbolic language
of Scripture—its purpose is not to convey literal, that is, material truths but to convey
metaphysical truths through the usage of material symbols. Another proposed solution is
to subject all human knowledge systems to the divine Balance of Scripture, and to regard
as erroneous and requiring correction whatever is found in those knowledge systems
which does not agree with what the prophet has revealed. This seems to be in harmony
with the many verses in which Bahá’u’lláh counsels the weighing of all human
knowledge, all sciences and arts, in the scales of the Revelation of God, of the revealed
Book of God, and His emphatic rejection of any attempt to weigh the revealed Book in
those human scales.

A similar choice of apologetic strategy is possible when we consider the seeming
contradictions between certain historical and scientific statements of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and
Shoghi Effendi and the current state of human knowledge in those fields. While what is at
stake in those two cases is the doctrine of “conferred infallibility” rather than that of
“essential infallibility” (as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá characterizes what Bahá’u’lláh has called the Most
Great Infallibility in the Ishraqat and the Kitab-i-Aqdas). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s explanations of
ether and evolution, which seem to be contradicted by virtually all contemporary
physicists and biologists, and Shoghi Effendi’s reference to the Roman Catholic doctrine of
the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary in a context which seems more likely to
refer to the Roman Catholic doctrine of the Virgin Birth represent instances which have
perplexed Bahá’í readers, and which might well be addressed by either of these
approaches. In the first case, the apologist would assert that neither ‘Abdu’l-Bahá nor
Shoghi Effendi was either an historian or a scientist and that neither one should be taken
as an authority on history or science; that their employment of historical or scientific
examples was for the purpose of conveying spiritual truths, and it is to these that we must
direct our urgent attention. In the second case, the apologist could state that it will be
discovered, in due course, that the seeming errors of historical citation or scientific
formulation that are found in the writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi are in fact
indications of where history or science will eventually end up, that in these cases past
revealed truth is predictive of future discovered truth.

In the case of the infallibility of the Universal House of Justice, the parameters of this
infallibility are set forth in the Bahá’í authoritative literature, and in the Constitution and
letters of the Supreme Institution itself. When there appears to be a conflict between a
decision or ruling of the Universal House of Justice and historical or scientific truth as it is
known in our time, we have the same two options as apologists as in the case of such
seeming contradictions in the other cases of infallibility. Either we may assert that the
intention of the Universal House of Justice is to convey a spiritual meaning and that its
choice of words is not to be taken in too literal a fashion, that is, to have a material
meaning that appears to conflict with some other established truth, be it physical or
metaphysical; or we may affirm that the Universal House of Justice has stated exactly what
it meant to state, that it expects that the literal meaning of its statement be comprehended,
and in this case if there is a conflict with present received knowledge, that this knowledge
will undergo transformation and will ultimately agree with the statement of the House.
Either position will have to be carefully articulated in order to be convincing. However it
ultimately does not fall on the “learned in Baha’” to articulate such explanations of the
statements of the Universal House of Justice. This Body can and does speak for itself,
elucidating its statements which have not been clearly understood. And sometimes the
House responds to enquiries by saying that it will not rule on a certain question or
elucidate a particular doctrinal or legal point at this time, leaving it to the individual and

the community as a whole to find meaning in what the House leaves unresolved at the
moment.

Not everything is explained in the Bahá’í Revelation. The barring of women from
membership in the Universal House of Justice, to give one powerful example of a teaching
that is not clear to most Bahá’ís, will be, we are assured, demonstrated to us as indicative
of the wisdom of God in the fullness of time. Shoghi Effendi, during the 36 years of his
Guardianship, and the Universal House of Justice, in its so far 43 years of Administration
have not given any indication either of how to make sense of this mysterious teaching in
view of the Bahá’í principle of the equality of men and women, or of when and under
what circumstances its wisdom will become apparent. Likewise, the pronouncements and
rulings of the Universal House of Justice, and all of its decisions pertaining to the
operations of the Bahá’í institutions, properties, social and economic development
projects, as well as matters pertaining to personal status will, in some cases engender
cognitive dissonance, emotional distress and testing of faith, inasmuch as they be
contradictory to the expectations that members of the Community have of the Universal
House of Justice. However, in the fullness of time the wisdom of all of these actions of the
House will be demonstrated. This is an article of personal faith on my part, based on my
understanding of the extent texts representing the wishes of Bahá’u’lláh and His chosen
ones. I do not believe that Bahá’u’lláh wished His followers to be second-guessing, much
less openly criticizing the Houses of Justice which He ordained for their guidance and
governance. In my view there are no “untenable and unacceptable consequences” for
adopting this attitude to the decisions of the Universal House of Justice. On the contrary, it
seems to me that there are indeed “untenable and unacceptable consequences” for
adopting a minimalist view of the infallibility of the House, and for restricting that
assurance of divine protection set forth in the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and
Shoghi Effendi to a handful of legislative actions over the course of the past forty and
more years. The minimalist view leaves the door open for criticism of nearly every
decision taken by the House, and undermines the authority of the Institution and of the
process of appeal—hence both its executive and juridical legitimacy—and conversely
empowers by default the individual believer to engage in lecturing the Supreme
Institution on how it has failed and how it could do better. Such a spirit of Protestantism is
wholly alien to the vision of Bahá’u’lláh and to the process whereby humanity can finally
be united as one family under one government.

Moreover, such a concept of infallibility also has far-reaching psychological
implications affecting the consciousness of the believers.[152] An unreflected, even magical
vision of the unerring guidance which has been conferred on the House of Justice
currently prevails in the community.[153] Some imagine the community to be in possession
of some kind of Delphic Oracle, to which everyone can appeal whenever they are in a

quandary. This is an utterly unacceptable attitude that fosters the frequently shown
inclination to avoid making one's own decision and to escape one's own responsibility by
submitting difficult matters to the Universal House of Justice in order to get "infallible
guidance."

Many Bahá’ís may indeed consider the Universal House of Justice as a kind of Delphic
Oracle, and inasmuch as these two institutions have in common the mandate to disclose
the divine Will to those who seek guidance, it is not unreasonable or mistaken for them to
do so. The process whereby the Universal House of Justice reaches its decisions is indeed a
mystery, and may well appear to be magical, inasmuch as it far transcends the normal
decision-making process employed by groups of adults, whether in government, in
corporations or in non-profit NGOs. The Universal House of Justice gives guidance to
individuals as well as to institutions and groups, but, in my experience, it does not force a
particular decision upon any person, leaving the ultimate choice to the individual, with
the understanding that a choice that conflicts with the guidance of the House may result in
consequences which will be unpleasant and a test of one’s faith.

This attitude and way of thinking is irrational. Furthermore it reveals that one
presupposes that the Universal House of Justice does not operate in a rational way and
does not decide after having conducted a rational consultation, but rather acts as a mere
recipient, transformer and mouthpiece of the Holy Spirit; that its decisions are revelational
in character. In reality decisions do not come about through quasi-prophetic inspiration
("quasi per inspirationem", "Divino afflante spiritu"). Instead, they are reached in the
course of a rational discursive process in which, subsequent to clarification of the
normative guidelines set out in the scripture and the establishment of the relevant facts, a
formal process of consultation leads to a consensus of opinion and finally to a decision
reached by majority vote or by unanimity. This means that the Holy Spirit does not act as a
deus ex machina. Information on every decision must be prepared and every decision
must be the subject of consultation. Shoghi Effendi has expressed this in an
incontrovertible statement: "They may, indeed they must, acquaint themselves with the
conditions prevailing among the community, must weigh dispassionately in their minds
the merits of any case presented for their consideration," then "they are to follow, in a
prayerful attitude, the dictates and promptings of their conscience."[154] Thus, infallibility is
not, as the Universal House of Justice has expressly stated[155] synonymous with
omniscience, nor does it preclude rational consultation and judgement.

According to Bahá'u'lláh, mankind has "attained the stage of maturity,"[156] and I think
such expressions of irrationality and obscurantism as mentioned above are not a sign of

maturity but rather of self-incapacitation and of contempt for human reason ('aql), which –
together with wisdom and prudence (hikma[157]) – has been so highly praised by
Bahá'u'lláh[158] and by 'Abdu'l-Bahá.[159]

The limits of infallibility conferred on the House of Justice should be compatible with
reason. The charisma should be reflected upon with the intention of arriving at an
understanding that does not imply a sacrificium intellectus. To believe in the conferred
infallibility of an institution with certain immanent limits, to believe that legislative acts
are immune to error by virtue of divine guidance, to believe that the will of God is
manifested in them according to the promise of infallible guidance is an act of faith that is
not in contradiction with human reason.

Whatever is not principally rational is not by definition irrational. There are sub-
rational and supra-rational attitudes and ways of thinking. Rational thought is not
unreservedly praised in the Bahá’í authoritative literature, indeed, the limitations of pure
reason are discussed by Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and believers are enjoined to
combine reason with empiricism, intuition and submissiveness to the revealed Book of
God, as well as to consult with one another in the spirit of search for truth. The process
whereby the decisions of the Universal House of Justice are reached is known only to the
members of the House. What certain members have disclosed has not confirmed the
assumptions expressed by Dr. Schaefer, indeed it appears that this decision-making
process is supra-rational. As indicated earlier, my service on Spiritual Assemblies has led
me to appreciate the often supra-rational nature of Bahá’í institutional consultation.
Certainly rational consultation and judgement are included in the decision-making, but
reason is not the ultimate standard according to which all things must be weighed and
valued. On the contrary, divine Revelation is that universal standard, and it is in its
balance that reason must be weighed.

The parameters of infallibility in the case of the House of Justice are fully compatible
with reason, but this does not indicate that they are primarily rational in nature, nor that
they are acceptable to every rational person. As in the case with the other Bahá’í teachings
and ordinances, these parameters are in agreement with science and reason, but not for
every scientist and every philosopher or self-described rationalist. That would once more
constitute an example of the fallacy that human measures are adequate for discerning the
meaning and validity of the revelation of God. This is thoroughly rejected by Bahá’u’lláh
in the opening statement of the Kitab-i-Iqan, to whit:

> “Then will they be made worthy of the effulgent glories of the sun of divine
> knowledge and understanding, and become the recipients of a grace that is infinite
> and unseen, inasmuch as man can never hope to attain unto the knowledge of the
> All-Glorious, can never quaff from the stream of divine knowledge and wisdom,

> can never enter the abode of immortality, nor partake of the cup of divine
> nearness and favour, unless and until he ceases to regard the words and deeds of
> mortal men as a standard for the true understanding and recognition of God and
> His Prophets.” (Bahá’u’lláh, The Kitab-i-Iqan, pp. 3-4)

The view expressed here is of no consequence for the legal authority of the supreme
House of Justice. This authority is – as already pointed out – not based on its special
charisma, but rather results simply from the fact that this institution has been ordained by
Bahá'u'lláh. As it is the supreme body, it has the last word[160] in all spheres of its powers.
Everything the House of Justice decides has to be obeyed. This obedience to the two
supreme institutions, the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice, has been
emphasized by 'Abdu'l-Bahá in unequivocal language:

Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth them, hath not obeyed God; whoso rebelleth
against him and against them hath rebelled against God; whoso opposeth him hath
opposed God; whoso contendeth with them hath contended with God... May the wrath,
the fierce indignation, the vengeance of God rest upon him![161]

The infallibility conferred on the supreme House of Justice reaches far beyond its
authority to have the final say in all matters. By virtue of its unerring guidance the Bahá'í
community is permanently in possession of an institution that by its legislation ensures
"the continuity of that divinely-appointed authority which flows from the Source of our
Faith" and safeguards "the unity of its followers."[162]

One objection could be made: Does this restrictive interpretation not result in a
reduction of the divine guidance that is granted to this supreme body, if its decisions in
administrative and judicial matters are excluded from the sphere of conferred infallibility?
I do not think so.

Divine guidance has different aspects. The Arabic term hudá is used in the Qur'án to
mean the divine revelation, i.e. the Qur'án itself, of which is said, "That is a book, wherein
is no doubt, a guidance for the God-fearing."[163] This book is the divine guidance to the
"straight path"[164] for those who believe. Besides that, God grants guidance in all matters to
all those who turn to him.[165] Beyond this individual guidance there is the guidance which
has been promised in this dispensation to institutions of the community. I can observe two
categories of divine guidance in the scripture: a general divine guidance that is promised
to all elected bodies, which is a relative one, because it depends on certain preconditions,
"prime requisites for them that take counsel together"[166] and a specific divine guidance
conferred on the twin pillars which is an absolute one, because it is not made dependent
on preconditions. This absolute divine guidance is infallibility.

In contrast to the absolute divine guidance, the relative one does not exclude error.

Hence, decisions of the Universal House of Justice that have been made in the sphere
outside its legislation can be cancelled. However, one can presuppose that the members of
this supreme institution are highly motivated for meeting these sublime "prime requisites"
enumerated by 'Abdu'l-Bahá and that this institution partakes of that general divine
guidance, undoubtedly in an incomparably higher degree than all the subordinated
elected bodies.

Taking this proposition for granted, the practical consequences of restricted infallibility
for the believers would be insignificant: they can continue to regard the House of Justice as
divinely guided, as a source of divine guidance, and could nevertheless admit that in a
special case this (relative) guidance might not operate because the House of Justice was
wrongly or not fully informed. This would be an unassailable position against all criticism
and all attempts to deny the concept of (conferred) infallibility by empirical
argumentation. Instead of saying "We have an infallible body," one would then say "We
have a divinely guided body that is infallible in the sphere of legislation." The scheme
outlined in the figure below might be helpful for a better understanding of my views.

By contrast, all the other decision-making institutions, the local and national "Houses of
Justice," are also promised divine guidance, but only under certain, legally unverifiable
circumstances that have been defined by 'Abdu'l-Bahá.[167] They have not been granted
infallibility. One indication that the local and national bodies do not share in the charisma
is the fact that both their governing statutes and the constitution of the Universal House of
Justice[168] include rights of review and appeal to ensure that erroneous decisions can be
revised. Such rights would be superfluous and meaningless if the decisions of the local
and national assemblies were also an expression of the divine will.

Dr. Schaefer’s proposal, that the House of Justice be regarded and represented as “a
divinely guided body that is infallible in the sphere of legislation” is very tempting to
accept. However, as has been pointed out throughout this paper, there are severe
limitations to this perspective, and many of them are based on the inaccuracy of certain
representations regarding the Universal House of Justice, its mandate, its promise of
protection and its present and future functions. While I do not claim that the infallibility
accorded to the Universal House of Justice is unlimited, and recognize that its limits are set
forth in the authoritative literature of the Faith and in the letters and Constitution of the
House Itself, my study of the relevant texts has convinced me that the parameters of the
infallibility of the House are much more inclusive and comprehensive than those very
restricted parameters proposed by Dr. Schaefer.

The idea that authority and infallibility are not linked is an idea which is unacceptable
to the Islamic mind, steeped as it has been for thirteen centuries in the close association of

all legitimate authority with divine guidance, and, in the case of the Shi’is, and, for all
practical purposes, the Sufis, unhesitating confidence in the infallibility of their spiritual
leaders. There is no such thing as secular authority in Qur’anic Islam. All authority is
derived from God, and He is the King over all the worlds He has created. His Prophet and
His chosen ones are His viceregents, His emissaries and His agents in this world. And the
mullas, ‘ulama and mujtahidun and qadis are the agents of those holy souls, applying the
holy law (shari’ah) on their behalf.

In the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the authority and divine inspiration and
infallibility of the House of Justice are spoken of in adjoining passages:

> “Unto the Most Holy Book every one must turn, and all that is not expressly
> recorded therein must be referred to the Universal House of Justice. That which
> this body, whether unanimously or by a majority doth carry, that is verily the
> truth and the purpose of God Himself. Whoso doth deviate therefrom is verily of
> them that love discord, hath shown forth malice, and turned away from the Lord
> of the Covenant.” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, The Will and Testament, pp. 19-20)

Likewise, the authority of the Manifestation of God and of His chosen ones is based
upon Their infallibilities. A letter written on behalf of the Guardian states on this theme:

> ‘"Regarding your Bahá'í friend who does not fully understand the infallibility of
> the Manifestation of God: You should influence that person to study the matter
> more deeply, and to realize that the whole theory of Divine Revelation rests on the
> infallibility of the Prophets, be He Christ, Muhammad, Bahá'u'lláh, or one of the
> others. If they are not infallible, then They are not Divine, and thus lose that
> essential link with God which, we believe, is the bond that educates men and
> causes all human progress." (From a letter written on behalf of The Guardian to an
> individual believer, January 11, 1942, in Lights of Guidance, p. 476)

The authority of the Universal House of Justice is derived from the infallibility of
Bahá’u’lláh and His chosen ones. If its Author had not been infallible, this institution could
hardly be regarded as infallible in any fashion. A Manifestation without infallibility is a
Manifestation Whose law cannot be regarded as obligatory and incumbent upon all of
humanity. In Middle Eastern culture, the recognized authority is considered to be
infallible (or the repository of law is regarded as infallible, as in the case of the Talmud and
the Shulchan Aruch for Orthodox Jews and in the case of the Qur’an and hadith and the
four legal madhdab for Sunni Muslims).

My proposal of a restrictive interpretation of the concept of infallibility should not be
misconstrued as an attempt to adjust opportunistically a concept that has negative
connotations in our secular society and is regarded as a provocation by sceptical

contemporaries in order to make it acceptable to the consciousness of people that are
"feeble and far removed from the purpose of God".[169] General acceptability is quite
certainly no seal of truth. Some norms of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (such as capital punishment in
cases of murder and arson, the stigmatization of the thief, prohibition of adultery, pre- and
extramarital intercourse (ziná') and acts of homosexuality [liwáth]) are perceived as a slap
in the face by the general public (especially in Europe).

It is not my intention to deny or to reduce anything that has been conferred on the
House of Justice by the holy text, thus unintentionally undermining its spiritual authority.
My aim is rather to examine the sources in order to attain a better understanding of the
provisions of Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu'l-Bahá and a rationally satisfying answer to a crucial
question. My only purpose in touching on the different aspects of this issue was
apologetical: to make the Faith and the authority of the House invulnerable against the
attacks, the cynical criticism of those contemptuous of religion and the ridicule of critics by
offering an interpretation that is unassailable and can be accepted as reasonable by people
of good will.

We should have a clear vision of a term with such far-reaching implications, so that we
are able to explain it to others and defend it against the objections of our sceptical
contemporaries. An open exchange of views and opinions on this matter should take place
in the community. This contribution is considered a step towards such a discussion. The
problems we are facing cannot be solved by making the issue taboo and by leaving the
field to the discussions of those who question the whole concept of infallibility and are
purposely undermining the spiritual authority of the House of Justice. A critical discourse
is the means to clarify such issues. Such theological discourses should not be misconstrued
as "idle disputations,"[170] as "the investigation of useless conceits," or as "empty, fruitless
debates" and "useless hair-splittings and disputes."[171] 'Abdu'l-Bahá's statement according
to which "the shining spark of truth cometh forth only after

the clash of differing opinions"[172] is a common truth and not only valid in the context of
consultation within the assemblies. As the Universal House of Justice has emphasised,
Bahá'ís must learn to live with a variety of theological opinions.[173]

Dr. Schaefer’s characterization of his “contribution” to the discussion of the infallibility
of the Universal House of Justice, as “a step towards…an open exchange of views and
opinions of this matter” is apt and illuminating. In the spirit of intellectual dialogue, which
has long been a staple of theological, philosophical and academic endeavor in Western
Europe, Dr. Schaefer proposes to engage other Bahá’ís in the process of examining this
question. Unfortunately, such open-ended dialogue is not a common occurrence in North
America, nor in most of the world at the present time, and indeed the tendency towards

parochialization and extreme partisanship has become so entrenched that any discourse
with “the other side” has become nearly impossible to pursue beyond a series of
introductory position papers and then a quiet retreat to more comfortable conversations
with those who agree with us. It is only when fundamentalists on both ends of the
spectrum, when true believers on the left and the right, pluralists and exclusivists,
materialists and religionists make the decision to meet face to face and discourse upon the
topics which have set them in opposition to one another that there is some hope of
resolving these issues, to be betterment of all parties. The resignation embodied in Dr.
Schaefer’s parting words, that “Bahá’ís must learn to live with a variety of theological
opinions” is a sentiment that we have heard from many sides in our time, when there
appear to be so many unreconciled voices and when acceptance of diversity has often been
regarded as of superior value to the rigorous sifting through the chaff to discover the seeds
of truth. Not only confirmed relativists express such sentiments, often exclusivists do as
well, when they weary of the debacle of seeking to defend their convictions or the
discouragement that may set in when others are impervious to what they consider the
beauty and truth of their arguments. Nevertheless, the answer is not to embrace
ambiguity, of to champion wishy-washy indeterminacy or spineless opportunism. Dr.
Schaefer and I are in complete agreement about this point. As was the Guardian, whose
views were expressed in this letter penned on his behalf by his wife:

> “There can be no schism in the Bahá'í Faith because the Guardianship is
> established on an unassailable foundation, supported by a signed, sealed
> document — the Will. Schism can only flourish where there is ambiguity or no
> specific proof.” (Shoghi Effendi, Letters from the Guardian to Australia and New
> Zealand, p. 60)

> 16:18, John 1:42, 21:15, Luke 22:32) and on the apostolic succession of the Bishop of Rome to the
> station of Peter. The infallibility of the Pope in his "teaching office" (magisterium) is deduced from the
> promise of the Holy Spirit: "And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the age" (Matt. 28:20), and
> the promise of the "Spirit of truth" (John 14:16ff.), through which the purity and authenticity of the faith
> preached by the apostles and their successors is guaranteed forever (cf. Luke 10:16; for more detail on

> legitimated explicitly by the scripture, namely Bahá'u'lláh's Kitáb-i-Aqdas and 'Abdu'l-Bahá's Testament.

93\. The question arises whether the Guardian's infallibility extends also to his judgements on issues of

> Aquinas called it lex aeterna, lex indita non scripta [S. th. 1, 2 q. 91 a.2]). Bahá'í ethics is theonomous
> (from Greek, theos: God; nomos: law) and voluntaristic in the sense that all moral values have their origin

> pleaseth" [Tablets 8:19, pp. 109-110, cf. Kitáb-i-Aqdas, verse 7, pp. 21-22]. "He shall not be asked of His
> doings" [Kitáb-i-Aqdas verse 161, p. 77]). This concept of ethical voluntarism leaves no room for the idea
> of natural law. However, if all morality is based on God's sovereign will, as it is expressed in his revelation

94\. "The infallibility of the Guardian is confined to matters which are related strictly to the Cause and

139\. Tablets 11:6, p. 164, cf. Will and Testament 2:5, p. 18. As 'Abdu'l-Bahá elucidated in a tablet (cf. Kitáb-i-

> Aqdas, p. 5 [introduction]), the significance of the provisions made by Bahá'u'lláh and by himself for the
> future development of Bahá'í law becomes apparent if it is considered in the context of Islamic law. For
> this reason a comparison shall be made which will reveal some parallels, but more cardinal differences.

> Both religions claim to possess a divine law, but even the primary sources of that law are different. In
> Islam it is the Qur'án and the Sunna (the sayings, actions and customs of the Prophet Muhammad as
> reported in the ahádíth). In the Bahá'í Faith it is only the scripture: the canon of the tablets of Bahá'u'lláh
> and the writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá. Tradition is not recognized as an authoritative source in the Bahá'í Faith,
> neither for doctrine nor for law. (As to the sola scriptural-principle see Grundlagen 66-70; Making the
> Crooked Straight 682-683 and note 27). In both religions the revealed law had and has to be developed.

> In Islam this process took place through the interpretation of the sources by the 'ulamá' who claimed
> authority, although the Qur'án contains no legitimation for such an authority. The development of the law
> (fiqh) has been worked out in Sunni Islam by the four legal schools (madháhib), in Shí'a Islam by the UsÏlí
> school. In Sunni Islam the authority is ultimately based on the ijma'. From a hádíth reported by Ibn Mádja,
> "My people will never agree on an error" (SEI 157) it was deduced per argumentum e contrario that a
> consensus, ijmá', on a question of faith or law would always be based on truth. An ijmá' was held to exist
> when the recognized religious scholars of a period, the mujtahids, agreed on a question of faith. Anything
> that had once been decided by ijmá' was regarded as the truth and deemed binding for all time (on this
> subject cf. Bergsträsser, Islamisches Recht [Berlin-Leipzig: de Gruyter 193] 131ff., Goldziher, Introduction
> to Islamic Theology and Law (Princeton/New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1981) 50ff., SEI 157).
> The sharí'a, the Islamic code of duties is regarded as divine. A human legislation is unimaginable for
> Islamic thought. Therefore Islam never had a legislative body.

> In contrast to Islam, the Bahá'í community is in possession of an infallible legislature so that in the
> fullness of time the "people of Bahá" will be governed by a universally applied sacred law, beyond which
> there will be wide scope for the legislation of human law according to the different conditions and
> exigencies on earth. A major difference in comparison with Islamic law is the fact that the Universal
> House of Justice can repeal its own legislation and adapt it to changed social conditions, as will be further
> elucidated below.

> An analogy (F. Ficicchia, Der Bahá'ismus – Religion der Zukunft? Geschichte, Lehre und Organisation in
> kritischer Anfrage [Stuttgart: Quell-Verlag, 1981] 162, 283; Hermann Römer, Die bábí-Behá'í. Eine Studie
> zur Religionsgeschichte des Islams [Potsdam: Verlag der Deutschen Orient-Mission, 1911] 118) between
> the infallibility of the Universal House of Justice and the Islamic principle of consensus, ijma', is not
> convincing as the following cardinal differences demonstrate:

> a.          ijmá' is neither an institution nor a decision made and proclaimed at a particular point in
> history, but is, rather, a statement that at a particular point in the past there was a unanimous
> consensus of the mujtahids;

> b.           legal issues and questions of faith are authoritatively clarified by ijmá'. The Universal
> House of Justice is a body that makes decisions that are not concerned with matters of doctrine. It is
> a legislative organ that has never existed in Islam;

> c.          this legislation is preceded by consultation, whereas ijmá' was not based on consultation
> between all the recognized mujtahids because the institution of a council never developed in Islam.
> Ijmá' could only ever be ascertained with the passage of time (postero tempore);
> d.         an ijmá' requires a unanimous consensus, whereas the Universal House of Justice
> makes its decisions on the basis of a majority vote following consultation.

construction of the buildings at the world centre, the publication of the holy texts in English etc.

150\. The publication of an English edition of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas was undoubtedly a significant act of the

> Universal House of Justice. However, this body did not raise such a claim for the text of the book,
> although it had consulted upon and approved it, but rather states that the translation "represents an
> acceptable rendering of the original" (Kitáb-i-Aqdas, p. 11 [Introduction]).

151\. I refer to Sir Karl Popper, The Logic of Scientific Discovery (New York-London: New York-London:

> Harper & Row, 1968); Objective Knowledge. An Evolutionary Approach, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981),
> according to whom we approach truth not by verification of a hypothesis, but rather by its "falsification." A
> thesis "all swans are white" is valid as long as no black swan has ever been seen. As soon as one black
> swan is discovered, the thesis is falsified and no longer valid. Thus, one single error would suffice for the
> falsification of the claim to infallibility. It should be noted that one of the main arguments brought forth
> against the papal infallibility is that a great number of papal decisions made over the course of time have
> evidently been erroneous. The concept of conferred infallibility without any limits is, I feel, indefensible.

152\. Perhaps that of the members of this body as well.
153\. In seminars on the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, when the arguments against capital punishment were analysed, I

> sometimes came across the argument that an error of the judiciary and the irreparability of an execution
> would cause no problem in a Bahá'í society, since the House of Justice would have to approve such a
> verdict and confirm only those in which the convicted is guilty ž and this without knowing the files, without
> consultation on facts, just by virtue of meditation and prayers! Meditation and prayers would, by virtue of

> the Holy Spirit, directly result in an infallible decision. If that were true, the question arises, why is the
> House of Justice dependent in its decisions on facts at all, and why is consultation required if prayers and
> meditation suffice for its illumination by the Holy Spirit?

165\. Among the prayers revealed by the Báb and by Bahá'u'lláh there are many for this purpose.

166\. "The prime requisites for them that take counsel together are purity of motive, radiance of spirit,

> detachment from all else save God, attraction to His Divine Fragrances, humility and lowliness amongst
> His loved ones, patience and long-suffering in difficulties and servitude to His exalted Threshold. Should
> they be graciously aided to acquire these attributes, victory from the unseen Kingdom of Bahá shall be
> vouchsafed to them." (Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá 43, 45, p. 87, Bahá'í Administration
> [Wilmette: Bahá'í Publishing Trust, 6th ed. 1953] 21ff.) "The first condition is absolute love and harmony
> amongst the members of the assembly. They must be wholly free from estrangement and must manifest
> in themselves the Unity of God... Should harmony of thought and absolute unity be non-existent, that
> gathering shall be dispersed and that assembly be brought to naught... They must, when coming
> together, turn their faces to the Kingdom on high and ask aid from the Realm of Glory. They must then
> proceed with the utmost devotion, courtesy, dignity, care and moderation to express their views. They
> must in every matter search out the truth and not insist upon their own opinion, for stubbornness and
> persistence in one's views will lead ultimately to discord and wrangling and the truth will remain hidden...
> Should they endeavour to fulfil these conditions the Grace of the Holy Spirit shall be vouchsafed unto
> them, and that assembly shall become the centre of the Divine blessings..." (ibid. 87-89). Thus, 'Abdu'l-
> Bahá makes clear that the guidance of the Holy Spirit will be granted only to those assemblies whose
> consultation is conducted under the conditions he has set out in these passages.
