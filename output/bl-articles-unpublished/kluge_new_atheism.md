        The New Atheism—A Bahá’í Perspective

Ian Kluge

Introduction
Since the publication of Sam Harris’ The End of Faith in 2004, a num-
ber of books extolling the virtues of atheism have gained prominence
in North America, notably Christopher Hitchens’ god Is Not Great,
Richard Dawkins’ The God Delusion, and Daniel Dennett’s Breaking
the Spell. Other books have also appeared but none achieved the fame
and/or notoriety of these four. These texts adopted a pugnacious and
even contemptuous tone towards religion and theists of all kinds,
even the mildest of them, Dennett’s Breaking the Spell, suggesting
that atheists ought to rename themselves “brights”— which suggests
that theists are obviously less ‘bright.’ According to the ‘new atheists’
as they were called, the only truth-claims we can accept are those
meeting the standards of modern science. They completely rejected
the existence of the super-natural or super-sensible aspects of reality.
In addition, they attempt to dismantle various philosophical proofs
of God, develop theories about the pathological origin of religion,
detail crimes committed by religion and challenge the link between
religion and morality.

This paper is a response to the philosophical claims of the new atheists,
i.e. an analysis of the philosophical foundations of their beliefs both
from a logical point of view, and from the perspective of the Bahá’í
Writings. Logically and philosophically speaking, their works are
deeply flawed, and, as is to be expected, they are often in disagreement
with the Bahá’í Writings—though on a number of issues they are in
agreement with them. This paper shall focus only on the major issues

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

and shall not point out every error of fact, every identifiable logical
error (and there are plenty)1 or the various polemical and rhetorical
theatrics they perform to advance their case.

Not unexpectedly, the number of differences between the new athe-
ists and the Bahá’í Writings far exceeds the number of agreements or
convergences. Writers calling for the wholesale abolition of religion
and all concepts of the super-natural or super-sensible, are not likely
to have much in common with the scriptures of any religion, even one
that accepts evolution, rationalism, the essential harmony of religion
and science and believes in the independent investigation of truth.
We must remember that the goal of the new atheists is to put as much
distance as possible between their ideas and religion. They have a
programmatic disinterest in common ground with religion.

Given the scope of disagreement with the new atheists, not to mention
their generally pugnacious style of self-expression, is there room for
debate with the new atheists? The answer is a qualified yes, certainly
on the basis of a number of agreements. We can also agree to explore
each other’s viewpoints to improve mutual understanding, although,
given the contempt they express for theologians and/or theistic
philosophers, there is room for a guarded optimism at best. There
is, of course, no reasonable hope for philosophical agreement since
the absolute denial of super-sensible realities undermines any basis for
agreement with religion. In other words, there can be no agreement
on foundational essentials, although there may be coincidental agree-
ment on other, non-essential issues.

Part I: Some Major Problems with the New Atheism

1: What is the New Atheism?
The ‘new atheism’ is the name given to contemporary atheism as
spear-headed by the work of Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitch-
ens, Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett. It is a form of explicit atheism
which requires a conscious and intentional rejection of belief in God,
gods and the super-sensible or supernatural realities, as distinct
from implicit atheism which is absence of belief in God, gods or the
supernatural without any conscious, i.e. intentional rejection. Implicit
atheism may be the result of ignorance or indifference. We must also
distinguish between the explicit, strong, positive or dogmatic atheism
which requires the conscious denial of any super-sensible realities, and
a “negative theoretic atheism”2 which is based on the lack of sufficient
data to assert the existence of super-sensible realities, and on the
inherent limits of human intelligence in knowing the existence of such
realities. This second type of atheism is close to agnosticism. Finally,
we must distinguish between atheism which denies the existence of
personal a God or gods but accepts the existence of a super-sensible
ground-of-being and an atheism which rejects the existence of any
and all super-sensible entities, personal or not. Theravada Buddhism
is often cited as an example of the former, as is Jainism.

2\. A categorical rejection of any and all super-sensible beings

> (metaphysical) materialism in explaining all phenomena.

3\. A militant agenda and tone which opposes not just the

> that religion per se is pathological in nature.

4\. A strident, aggressive, and provocative way of expressing

> themselves and indulgence in all kinds of polemical and
> dismissive rhetoric.

5\.   Belief in the ability of science to answer all human questions by

> means of the scientific method with its criteria of measurabil-
> ity, repeatability, predictability, falsifiability; quantifiability.

6\. A belief that faith is inherently an enemy of reason and science

> defined as inherently irrational, and thus. in a perpetual con-
> flict with reason and science that must end with the ultimate
> victory of one or the other. Faith is defined as “belief without
> evidence.”3 They adhere to a conflict model of the relationship
> between religion/faith and reason/science.

7\.   Belief that religion is part of our past but not of our future,

> i.e. religion is part of our evolutionary heritage that we must
> learn to overcome.

8\. An insistence of reading scriptures literally (in order to

> condemn religion) and a consistent rejection of centuries
> of non-literal theological interpretations of the relevant
> scriptures.

9\. An insistence that humankind has an innate and reliable

> moral sense or intuition that does not require the guidance
> of religion; morality is not inherently connected to or based
> on religion and our morals have less to do with religion than
> we tend to think.

10\. Presentism: judging past ages by the standards of today, which

is, in effect, a failure to recognise the scientific principle of

> evolution (or the principle of progressive revelation) operating
> in religion as it does in all other aspects of life. (also the logical
> error of anachronism)

11\. A tendency to characterize religious faith as a form of mental

> illness, a criminal offense comparable to child-molesting or
> an anti-social act that ‘dumbs down’ society as a whole.

12\. Rejection of the freedom to be religious; because religion is

> so damaging to the well-being of society, it is not a legitimate
> choice for individual or collective behavior in society

2\. Are the New Atheists Really New?

If Hitchens, Dawkins, Harris and Dennett are the dominant figures
in the ‘new atheism,’ who are the representatives of the ‘old atheism’?
Since 1800, five major figures stand out, Feuerbach, Marx, Nietzsche,
Freud and Sartre. Feuerbach developed an anthropological view of
God in which God is nothing more than the projection of human
nature, i.e. of emotions, wishes, fears, dreams, hopes and ideals
projected outward in a larger-than-human form. In other words,
God is man writ large; God is made in man’s image. Ontologi-
cally, there is no such being as God. Feuerbach influenced Marx
according to whom God is an invention used by the ruling classes
to control those beneath them. Marx’s atheism is based on three
principles: (a) dialectical materialism according to which only
matter is real; (b) historical materialism according to which all
historical and cultural developments are based on economic fac-
tors; (c) radical humanism in which man, not God, is the supreme
being in the universe. Nietzsche’s most famous contribution to the
development of atheism is his statement that “God is dead”4 which
may be interpreted as a claim that our current conception of God
is dead, or that the idea of a metaphysical God is dead. His believes
that we can live more authentically human lives without a God Who
stands in our way and prevents us from choosing and asserting our
own identity and values, and Who weakens our commitment to and

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

appreciation of earthly existence in the name of an abstract spiritual
heaven. Rather he proclaims “Dead are all the Gods”5 so that the
way is cleared for the evolution of the Superman. Nietzsche rejected
the concept of metaphysical aspects of existence. Freud asserted
that God is an illusion surviving from humankind’s childhood and
that this illusion prevented us from attaining intellectual and moral
maturity. God was a father figure to Whom we turned for protec-
tion instead of doing what was necessary for ourselves. Thus, belief in
God infantilizes us. Sartre, the most influential post WW II athe-
ist, rejects the existence of God because the existence of God limits
human freedom by imposing a pre-determined essence on us and
thereby preventing us from creating ourselves by our choices. He also
argues that the idea of God is self-contradictory insofar as no being
can be both “in-itself ” like any object in the world and “for-itself ” like
all self-conscious beings since “for-itself ” is a negation of “in-itself.”

As a sidebar, we might also mention Anthony Flew, easily the best
known atheist philosopher in the English speaking world for almost
five decades. However, starting in 2003, Flew revised his position and
in his latest book, There Is a God (2007) he frankly admits to being
a theist. Almost as if he wished to scandalize his former atheist col-
leagues, Flew based his change of mind on a vigorous philosophical
defence of a variation of intelligent design.

A survey of the “old atheists’” work shows that very little of what
the new atheists say is substantially new. Almost all major themes—
materialism, the adequacy of science to solve all problems, religion
as part of our evolutionary past, the inherent conflict of reason
and faith or religion, the rejection of super-sensible aspects of the
universe and the militant denunciation of religion—have all been
anticipated by the “old atheists.” They also attempted to disprove
the earlier philosophical arguments for the existence of God and to
show that the concept of God was a social control mechanism.

What is new in the new atheists is their denunciation of religious
tolerance, which they see as pandering to dangerous religious super-
stition; their rejection of the freedom to be religious; their rejection
of belief in belief which is viewed as adopting a second-hand faith
instead of facing the truth of atheism; their attempts to link religion
to our evolutionary genetic endowment as well as the assertion that
religion is child abuse. Finally, when compared to the work of the “old
atheists” their work shows a willingness to engage in polemics and
rhetorical theatrics that is unprecedented in Feuerbach, Marx, Freud
and Sartre, though it has some, though not nearly as extreme, roots
in Nietzsche.

3\. Ontological Materialism and Its Problems
From the point of view of the Bahá’í Writings, the first problem
with the new atheists is their adherence to ontological and method-
ological materialism or physicalism. This philosophy is also referred
to as naturalism, which asserts that “[a] everything is natural, i.e.
that everything there is belongs to the world of nature and [b] so can
be studied by the methods appropriate to studying that world…”6
Part [a] of this definition covers ontological naturalism or mate-
rialism which is the view that “the world is entirely composed of
matter,”7 that reality is fundamentally physical (matter or energy)
and that non-physical entities have no part in composing reality.
Consequently, “the supernatural does not exist, i.e. only nature is
real, therefore supernature is not real.” 8 Part [b] of this definition
refers to methodological materialism, viz. that the proper method of
studying nature takes only natural, i.e. physical factors into account.
Any appeal to non-natural or non-physical factors is rejected in our
quest for understanding.

It is worth noting that adherence to methodological naturalism
does not necessarily require adherence to ontological naturalism.
We may accept methodological naturalism as the proper technique
for the study of physical nature without dismissing the existence

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

of non-physical or spiritual aspects of reality which have their own
appropriate methods of study. In other words, science confines itself
to statements about empirical studies and refrains from extrapo-
lating beyond its specific findings to such ontological issues as the
nature of reality as a whole. It limits itself to the study of phenomenal
reality from a strictly physical/natural perspective. Of course, those
who accept ontological naturalism are logically required to accept
methodological naturalism as well.

However, the new atheists are strong advocates of naturalism both in
its ontological and methodological forms. As Dawkins says, “I decry
the supernaturalism in all its forms.” 9 One reason for his stance is
that ontological: supernaturalism simply does not accurately reflect
reality and therefore, cannot be a proper object of scientific study
because nothing exists to be studied. A second reason is method-
ological: in a purely physical universe, only purely physical studies
are appropriate and attention to non-physical/spiritual entities will
only distract our attention and distort our conclusions. In a word,
supernatural considerations violate Occam’s Razor, a subject we shall
discuss in more detail below.

From a Bahá’í perspective, the new atheist’s naturalistic/material-
istic ontology is unacceptable. `Abdu’l-Bahá makes it clear that he
categorically rejects the view that sensible material reality is all that
exists. Somewhat mockingly he says,

> if it be a perfection and virtue to be without knowledge of God
> and His Kingdom, the animals have attained the highest degree
> of excellence and proficiency. Then the donkey is the greatest
> scientist and the cow an accomplished naturalist, for they have
> obtained what they know without schooling and years of labori-
> ous study in colleges, trusting implicitly to the evidence of the
> senses and relying solely upon intuitive virtues. (PUP 262)

Later, he compares the mental conditions of the materialists to that
of the cow which is a

> captive of nature and knows nothing beyond the range of the
> senses. The philosophers, however, glory in this, saying, “We
> are not captives of superstitions; we have implicit faith in the
> impressions of the senses and know nothing beyond the realm of
> nature which contains and covers everything. (PUP 311–312)10

In more technical language, the cow is a good positivist, holding the
belief that all valid knowledge must come from and is limited to the
senses. Positivists elaborate these requirements—knowledge must
be physically measurable, quantifiable, objective and predictable/
testable—but they maintain the fundamental position that there can
be no knowledge “beyond the range of the senses” or “beyond the
realm of nature.” Even a cursory reading of their books makes it clear
that the new atheists are strong positivists.

`Abdu’l-Bahá comments that if materialism/positivism is true, if it is

> the final result of our studies, “why should we go to the colleges? Let us go
> to the cow.” (PUP 361) The implication of his remarks is clear: just as
> the animal’s materialistic view of reality is inadequate to understand
> reality as a whole—obviously there are realities beyond the knowl-
> edge of the cow—materialism or positivism in philosophy and science
> are inadequate tools for understanding reality as a whole. Even in
> principle, physical nature does not explain itself, i.e. is not completely
> intelligible on its own terms. If we want to understand the existence
> of nature, then we will have to go beyond physical nature itself. That
> does not mean we necessarily have to invoke super-natural factors in
> explaining each chemical reactions or every application of the law of
> gravity but it does mean that super-natural factors must be included
> when we try to explain certain fundamental questions such as the
> origin of nature itself, of natural laws or of contingent beings. This, of
> course, is precisely what atheists—old or new—either ignore or deny.

The Bahá’í Writings illustrate the unintelligible character of strictly
materialist explanations of the existence of physical reality in numer-
ous ways that we shall explore throughout this paper. For example,
in Some Answered Questions, `Abdu’l-Bahá discusses the way things
affect each other, stating,

> The same can be said of other beings whether they affect other
> things or be affected. Such process of causation goes on, and
> to maintain that this process goes on indefinitely is manifestly
> absurd. Thus such a chain of causation must of necessity lead
> eventually to Him who is the Ever-Living, the All-Powerful,
> who is Self-Dependent and the Ultimate Cause. This Universal
> Reality cannot be sensed, it cannot be seen. It must be so of
> necessity. (TAF 18)

`Abdu’l-Bahá clearly endorses the argument of the Uncaused Cause.

> Denying the Uncaused Cause implies the existence of an infinite
> regress of causal acts since it means that a causal sequence has no
> beginning or end. According to `Abdu’l-Bahá the idea of an infinite
> regress of causal acts is “manifestly absurd.”

In examining this argument, it is essential to clarify what is being
rejected, viz., an infinite series of actual dependent causal acts or
things, i.e. an ‘infinite’ series in which each depends on and is con-
ditioned by its predecessor. In other words, no act is self-sufficient
in its own being, but depends on something else for its coming into
existence or for acting. If all the things or causal acts in the universe
are not self-sufficient, but rather externally conditioned and thereby
dependent on others, then how can their existence or action be intel-
ligible on strictly material terms? As W. Norris Clarke, SJ, says,

> Can there be an infinite regress in this chain of dependence, so
> that it could extend endlessly with all its members having the

> same existential status of [externally] conditioned existents,
> none of them self-sufficient for its own existence?11

The question, of course, is rhetorical because when all things or
causes are dependent on and conditioned by something external to
them, then there can be no point at which a specific thing or causal
act meets the proper conditions for existence or action by itself—and,
consequently, nothing can act or come into existence. This is not a
problem that can be solved with better instrumentation or sharper
calculation; rather, the problem exists in principle, i.e. is constitutive
of the nature of an infinite series of causal acts or things. Furthermore,
if such an infinite regress of causal acts existed, the universe would be
in stasis since no causal act has the required conditions for activation.
But the universe is obviously not in stasis and, therefore, any solely
material explanation fails to explain causal action, i.e. leaves the
dynamic universe as we know it unintelligible. We may have limited
local explanations for local actions, e.g. the motion of a billiard ball,
but the ultimate origin of motion per se remains unintelligible.

It is virtually self-evident that whatever ultimately initiates the
“chain of causation” cannot itself be dependent on, i.e. caused or

> conditioned by anything external to itself. It must be absolutely self-
> sufficient. In other words, the initiator, the first cause, the “Prime
> Mover” (PM 261) must itself be unconditioned and/or uncaused,
> and this logically requires that it be a completely different kind of
> entity than all other conditioned things and/or causes known to us
> in the phenomenal world. It must be transcendent to the material
> world not subject to causes and/or conditions. In short, it is what
> religious philosophers call God.

There are other examples which show why, in principle, the material
universe cannot explain itself and why logically there must be a non-
physical source or ground of being. How and why do fundamental
particles get their specific natures? As previously shown, we cannot

posit an infinite series of evolutionary causal acts by which funda-
mental particles got their attributes through evolving from other
forms of matter. How did those other forms of matter get their
natures including their ability to evolve into something else and their
receptivity to influence? Once again, we either posit a source or we
succumb to the problems of an actual infinite regress.

We may also ask about the origin of physical laws. Since the laws that
regulate things cannot be the same as the things they regulate (oth-
erwise they require regulation themselves), they must be different in
kind from the things they apply to. Therefore, in principle, such laws
cannot arise from matter itself—which in turn raises the question of
their source. Yet again we see that the natural world cannot explain
itself, i.e. cannot explain itself in exclusively material terms and that
some concept of a ground of being or “Ultimate Cause” is necessary.

There is yet another way in which the Bahá’í Writings show the ratio-
nality of theism and the inadequacy of atheism’s purely naturalistic
explanations of the existence of the universe. Nothing in the universe
exists by necessity; everything we know comes into and passes out
of existence. This is what `Abdu’l-Bahá refers to when he says, “the
phenomenality of contingency is essential,” (SAQ 203) i.e. that being
contingent and being a phenomenon like matter are inseparable.
Contingent beings are dependent beings. This means they are not
self-sufficient and depend on something else to explain their own
existence or action; certain pre-conditions must be fulfilled before
they can come into existence and that whatever fulfills these pre-
conditions cannot itself be contingent. As `Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> Because a characteristic of contingent beings is dependency, and
> this dependency is an essential necessity, therefore, there must be
> an independent being whose independence is essential. (SAQ 6)

In other words, whatever fulfills the pre-conditions for the existence
of contingent things or causal acts must itself be independent of all
other pre-conditions. This is the case because it is clear that some-
thing comes to exist only by virtue of something else that already
exists (something cannot come from absolute nothing12) and that
if we follow this sequence we eventually arrive at something that
exists by its own nature, i.e. does not depend on something else
for its existence, and which, therefore, is not a natural object. Here
again we encounter a non-physical “Ultimate Cause.” (TAF 17) If
we reject this “Ultimate Cause” we shall find ourselves trapped in
an impossible infinite regress.

It is, of course, possible to ask if the phenomenal universe is con-
tingent. There are two ways to answer this question. First, the
Bahá’í Writings and empirical experience tell us that everything
that exists is contingent, i.e. it is possible for them not to exist. It
is possible for me or my house not to be. Because the universe is
existentially constituted entirely by contingent beings, it follows that
the universe itself is contingent. If every part of a machine is destruc-
tible, the machine itself is destructible, i.e. it does not have to exist. If
a machine is constituted by its parts, the machine does not exist until
the parts are assembled correctly.13 Denying this fact would lead athe-
ists into the strange position of asserting the somehow non-physical
existence of a house whose components have been hauled to the dump,
and to the continued non-physical existence of a plant whose cells have
been destroyed. This is not only illogical but also violates their own
naturalistic principles of sticking to empirical observations.

Second, the phenomenal universe is contingent because it is just one
of many possible universes that could have existed in the past or could
exist in the future. After all, the universe could have been arranged
differently, natural laws could have been different, as well as proton
mass and the strength of the weak force. In other words, the universe
as we know it does not exist necessarily, i.e. it is radically contingent,

which is to say, its existence does not inevitably follow from what it is,
i.e. from its own being. A different universe could have existed and
ours not at all. However, such a radically contingent universe requires
a cause, since it obviously cannot create itself, nor can it create itself
from nothing. Furthermore, whatever brings the entire universe into
existence must be a non-contingent or necessary being i.e. in theologi-
cal language, God Who exists necessarily. (SAQ 203)

The Bahá’í Writings make it clear that science by itself cannot answer
certain fundamental questions about why phenomenal nature came
into existence, how or why natural laws arose and how or why particles
acquired their attributes. The first problem as we have seen is that of
an actual infinite regress. Furthermore, answering these fundamen-
tal questions scientifically requires us to apply the scientific method,
which is designed to study measurable, quantifiable, repeatable physi-
cal phenomena in time and space, whereas these questions refer to
the conditions that make measurability, physicality, quantifiability,
repeatability and time and space possible in the first place. These are
the pre-conditions necessary for phenomenal existence. Consequently
these questions lie beyond the scope of the scientific method which
is limited to phenomenal reality once these conditions have been
established. Science cannot answer them even in principle.

4\. The Principle of Sufficient Reason
Another way in which the Bahá’í Writings deal with the denial of God
is to point out that strictly materialist explanations for the existence
of the universe violate the principle of sufficient reason (PSR). The
PSR, a venerable philosophical principle especially associated with
Leibniz but with roots hearkening all the way back to Anaximander,
states everything exists or happens for a reason that is necessary and
sufficient to explain why it exists/happens and why it exists/happens
in the particular way it does.14 Any scientific explanation seeks to
provide a necessary and sufficient reason for whatever it studies, i.e. it
seeks to fulfill the PSR. If a purportedly scientific explanation does

not satisfy the PSR, it will be considered wrong or incomplete. If an
explanation can never—not even in principle—fulfill the PSR, then
it is scientifically inadequate or deficient in some major way.

Like science, the Bahá’í Writings posit the principle of sufficient
reason (PSR) in a variety of contexts. Bahá'u'lláh makes theological
use of the PSR when He writes, God

> through the direct operation of His unconstrained and sovereign
> Will, chose to confer upon man the unique distinction and
> capacity to know Him and to love Him—a capacity that must
> needs be regarded as the generating impulse and the primary
> purpose underlying the whole of creation. (GWB 64)

Elsewhere, this purpose is also described as God’s desire to reveal
Himself which He does through humankind, the phenomenal
embodiment of His purpose. Bahá’u’lláh’s reason for the existence
of the phenomenal world is obviously not a scientific explanation in
terms of material or efficient causality. This account is existential
insofar as it explains existence in terms of human purpose, value
and final causality but this does not prevent it from meeting the
PSR in a theological context. (We shall have more to say about final
causality below.)

`Abdu’l-Bahá also affirms the PSR when he states, “everything which

> happens is due to some wisdom and … nothing happens without a reason.”
> (PUP 46) In its context, this statement has an existential and theolog-
> ical application since it applies the PSR to events in the human world
> and implies that any purely physical explanation of the tragic event
> may be physically correct but is not complete. For a complete existen-
> tial and/or theological understanding of earthly events we must look
> beyond the phenomenal world. However, `Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement is
> also applicable to existence in general since he believes that creation
> functions according to natural laws and is not “fortuitous.”15

`Abdu’l-Bahá invokes the PSR in a scientific sense when he states that
“the existence of everything depends upon four causes,”(SAQ 280) i.e. the

> material cause (wood), the efficient cause (the carpenter), the formal
> cause (the form of the chair) and the final cause (the purpose of the
> chair). Without all of these aspects, the explanation is incomplete.
> We may know everything about the material aspects of the chair, but
> if we do not know what it is for—its purpose or goal or telos—we
> do not truly understand what it is. Nor can we adequately explain
> its form, i.e. why it exists in the way it does. Therefore, any strictly
> material account of the chair (or anything else) that cannot account
> for the final cause does not truly satisfy the PSR.

4\.1. An Important Digression: the PSR and Final Causes
At this point, a question important to atheism/religion debate
arises: why do we need to know the final cause in order to satisfy the
PSR? To understand why this is the case requires a brief digression in
order to rectify some common confusions about final causes. It is an
oft-repeated truism that science rejects final causes and confines itself
to material and efficient causes; belief in final causes is regarded as
a remnant of pre-scientific thinking to which religion is especially
susceptible.

However, this issue is not as clear as it might seem. To see why, let us
perform a thought experiment. Imagine a group of scientists finding
a book in an alien language. They can physically analyse the book
to the smallest detail of every material and efficient cause, and yet,
unless they know what the book is for i.e. a science text, a novel, a
news article, a philosophical text etc, they cannot claim to under-
stand what they have found. They do not know what it means and
what its purpose is. Their knowledge is correct but incomplete and,
therefore, their explanation cannot completely satisfy the PSR.

The usual objection to final causes is that nature is not a man-made
artifact like a chair or a book and, therefore, does not embody a goal or

purpose. Hence, the appeal to final causality is unscientific and must be
rejected. Scientific explanations have no room for teleology of any sort.
The problems with this retort begin with the misunderstanding that
the final cause is a conscious intention or a plan externally imposed
on some object or process. Aristotle, whose work is the foundation of
teleology, states, “It is absurd to suppose that purpose is not present
because we do not observe the [conscious] agent deliberating.”16 In
other words, purpose or goal can be present without a conscious
agent externally imposing his wishes on an object or process. Aris-
totle was clearly aware that in natural processes, we see no such
extrinsic agent guiding the changes.

According to Aristotle, in natural processes “the form [formal cause],
the mover [the efficient cause], ‘that for the sake of which’ [the final
cause] …often coincide,”17 i.e. are aspects of a single causal act. The for-
mal, final and efficient cause act together to produce certain effects on
a regular basis. The final and formal causes are simply what determines
the efficient cause to consistently achieve one particular effect rather
that a different one. For example, we expect sunlight on a windowsill to
produce a warm windowsill instead of rainbows or ice-cream. The sun-
light acts one way and not another precisely because it is pre-determined
to affect things in certain ways only; it is inwardly constrained, by its
nature to do only certain kinds of things, which is to say, constrained to
reach only a limited repertoire of goals. As W. Norris Clarke, S.J. says,

[i]f the efficient cause at the moment of its productive action is
> not interiorly determined or focussed towards procuring this
> effect rather than another, then there is no sufficient reason
> why it should produce this one[effect] rather than [another].
> Hence it will produce nothing [no effect] at all: indeterminate
> action is no action at all… [This is] precisely what is meant by
> final causality or focussed efficient causality…18

The effects of any process can only be of a certain kind, i.e. they oper-
ate to reach particular goals or purposes. Consequently, it becomes
clear that the laws of nature also act as final causes because they
guide processes to certain specific ends instead of others; sowing
iron filings will not let us harvest sunflowers but will allow us to
gather rust. Planets follow the laws of motion—and therefore circle
the sun rather than inscribing figure-eights. The laws of chemistry
require acetic acid and baking soda to react in a certain way. All
these processes are constrained to act towards certain ends which
are predictable.

According to Henry Veatch, final causality is a perfectly commonsen-
sical notion, applicable to nature as well as to the work of conscious
agents. Here is how Veatch explains final causes:

> In other words, since natural agents and efficient causes as
> far as we understand them, are found to have quite deter-
> minate and more or less predictable results, to that same
> extent we can also say that such forces are therefore ordered
> to their own appropriate consequences or achievement: it
> is these they regularly tend to produce, and it is these that
> may thus be said to be their proper ends… Aristotelian final
> causes are no more than this: the regular and characteristic
> consequences or results that are correlated with the characteris-
> tic actions of various agents and efficient causes that operate in
> the natural world.19

In other words, Aristotle’s concept of final causes is no less scientific
than a chemical formula that successfully predicts the results of
mixing acetic acid with baking soda or a satellite’s orbit. One might
also express this by saying that final causes are the potentials that
will actualize when certain preconditions are met either naturally or
through conscious human manipulation. They are not, as has been so

often claimed, mere anthropomorphisms and, if correctly understood,
do not undermine the doctrine of the unity of science and religion.

Among the new atheists, only Dawkins seems even peripherally aware
of the PSR, in his rejection of the view that “only theology is equipped
to answer the why questions. What on Earth is a why question?”20
He tries to brush them aside tout court: “Some questions simply do
not deserve an answer.”21 This, of course, is more an expression of
attitude and prejudice rather than a rational reply. However, in tak-
ing this path, he goes too far; insofar as his retrogressive argument
could just as easily be used to dismiss some of the most important
scientific questions of our time, e.g. Einstein’s question of whether
time was constant for all observers and why it was not. Dawkins also
fails to distinguish between questions that can be rationally justified
and those that cannot, i.e. questions based on scientific data or logi-
cal reasoning and those that are baseless speculation. For example,
it is not unscientific to ask how and why the initial cosmological
singularity came into existence since there is general consensus that
such a singularity must have existed but, until empirical and/or logi-
cal evidence arrives there is no point in wondering why fairies rode
sea-horses in the prehistoric oceans.

Based on his previous statements, Dawkins would seem to imply
that only questions that can be answered scientifically deserve to
be answered but this reply, as we shall see in detail below, is highly
problematical.

5: Methodological Naturalism
As we may recall, the second part of our previously given definition
of naturalism refers to methodological materialism i.e. the view that
everything there is “can be studied by the methods appropriate to
studying that world.”22 In other words, all phenomena must be studied
and explained scientifically, i.e. in strictly material or physical terms;
we cannot appeal to any non-physical causes in our explanations. All

studies must adhere to the methods of natural science, i.e. be measur-
able, quantifiable, repeatable, objectively observable, and falsifiable.
Ideally, we should be able to conduct or at least conceive of an actual
experiment to help determine what is true, or minimally, what is
false. Only that which can be scientifically established or at least is
not forbidden by the scientific method can be called truth.

The adherence to methodological materialism creates serious prob-
lems for the new atheists. The first is the claim that only knowledge
meeting the demands of the scientific method is genuine knowledge,
i.e. is not faith or “belief without evidence.” One problem is how to
verify such a claim scientifically. What experiment could prove that
only scientific knowledge claims are valid, or that all other knowledge
claims are false? The impossibility of doing so is self-evident. Obvi-
ously, the new atheists’ claim about genuine knowledge refutes itself
because it cannot meet its own criteria for testing knowledge claims.
Hence, their position is untenable.

A second problem follows. If only scientifically established facts are
genuine knowledge, how can the new atheists assert ontological
materialism, i.e. that there are no supernatural or super-sensible
aspects to reality?23 By its very nature a scientific experiment can
only tell us about physical things and nothing at all about the exis-
tence or non-existence of super-physical entities. How then, could
an experiment prove or disprove the existence of the supernatural or
super-sensible? Again, the new atheism’s basic ontological premise is
undermined by its own insistence of excluding anything but scientific
evidence. In effect, their categorical denial of super-sensible realities
is left without a foundation even on their own terms.

The new atheism’s foundational claims are, in the final analysis, self-
undermining and self-refuting., Paradoxically then, the assertion of
these claims as if they were genuine truth is ultimately no more than
an act of faith, or as Dawkins puts it, a delusion that grows out of

“belief without evidence.”24 This places the new atheists in a position of

> serious self-contradiction since they are opposed to believing anything
> on faith. Harris, whose book is called The End of Faith, says “faith
> is simply unjustified belief,”25 i.e. belief “unjustified” by the scientific
> method, while Dennett approvingly quotes Mark Twain’s jest, “‘Faith
> is believing what you know ain’t so.’”26 Hitchens , too, views faith as
> belief without evidence.27 Consequently, the new atheists are in a posi-
> tion of asserting a position based on "faith" (not provable by science),

“Our enemy is nothing other than faith itself,”28 “It is therefore the very

> nature of faith to serve as an impediment to further inquiry,”29 “faith and
> superstition distort our whole picture of the world.”30

What all this demonstrates is that the philosophical foundations of
the new atheism, specifically, the methodological and ontological root
premises, are severely flawed inasmuch as they cannot meet the basic
logical criterion of internal consistency or non-self-contradiction.
Even on their own terms, they cannot prove that the physical world
is the only real one, and, therefore, they cannot prove the foundation
principle of atheism that God does not exist. This leaves belief in God
available as a rational possibility.

6\. Is the Existence of God a Tenable “Scientific Hypothesis”?
Another problem with ontological materialism is Dawkin’s view
is exposed in the two statements that “the God question is not in
principle and forever outside the remit of science”31 and “the exis-
tence of God is a scientific hypothesis like any other.”32 These two
statements entangle him in a flagrant self-contradiction. How could
a natural, physical experiment prove or disprove the existence of a
non-physical entity? How could God, Who is not a natural object,
Who does not exist in the limitations of time and space be proven or
disproven by an experiment precisely limiting itself to entities that
exist in time and space? "God" would be subject to scientific study

> and experimentation only if that Being is a quantifiable, physical or
> material being, i.e. part of nature—but "God" is not. Thus, Dawkins

`Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> The Divine Reality is Unthinkable, Limitless, Eternal, Immortal

> and I would argue, ultimately by all religions, has none of the charac-
> teristics of the phenomenal reality which science is designed to study.
Therefore, Dawkins’ argument does not refute the existence of God

as accepted by religions but only refutes a ‘straw-man,’ a naturalistic
‘god’ as Dawkins has contrived him for polemical purposes. Like all

straw-man arguments, Dawkins’ contention simply misses the point.
The existence or non-existence of God is beyond the reach of scientific

> study, though, as we have already seen, it is not necessarily beyond
> the man’s reasoning capacity.

This problem also dogs Dennett’s work, though from a different per-
spective. He proposes to study religion scientifically—a project not
in itself incompatible with the Bahá’í Writings—but then he forgets
that scientifically studying the human phenomenon of religion in
evolutionary terms is not the same thing as establishing atheism on a
scientific basis. The latter requires evidence that God does not exist,
whereas the former merely studies how the religious impulse mani-
fests itself in various cultural forms—which does not say anything
at all about God’s existence or non-existence. His attempt to argue
from the historical manifestations of religion to God’s non-existence

is a patent non sequitur. Finally, Dennett reduces God to the kind of
phenomenon science can study and seems oblivious to the fact that
he has substituted his own naturalistic ‘god’ for a supernatural God
and, therefore, has set up a reductionist argument.

7\. Self-Contradictions: Meme Theory and HADDs

> The demand that all genuine knowledge must be scientific also
> causes trouble for the new atheists insofar as it leads them into self-
> contradictions. In order to explain the spread and powerful hold of
> religion, Dawkins and Dennett assert that religion is a meme, i.e. a
“unit[] of cultural imitation”33 which functions like a gene for ideas,

> beliefs, customs, feelings, skills and so on. These are transferred
> through teaching, imitation and law. As Dennett points out, these
> memes operate for their own benefit, and must be studied in light of
> the question “cui bono?” 34 i.e. who gains?

The most obvious problem with meme theory is that it is beside the
point to the issue of God’s existence or non-existence because it is a
theory about the transmission of ideas and images, and, as such, says
nothing about the truth of these ideas and/or images. Nothing in
meme theory can be used to tell us whether or not the ‘God-meme’
refers to an existing reality. Any conclusions one way or another are
simply a non sequitur fallacy. The method of transmission of an idea
does not allow us to assess if the idea is true.

But there are deeper difficulties, viz. that meme theory itself does
not meet the demands of the scientific method. Here are ten reasons
why memes are no more than metaphors and not products of reason-
ing guided by the scientific method: memes (1) do not exist in space,
(2) are not physical, (3) have no internal structure i.e. no physically
separate or component parts or clear boundaries, (4) are not involved
in any measurable energetic processes within themselves, amongst
themselves or with other beings, (5) do not show, action, agency, e.g.
competition, accommodation, (6) have no inherent interests or even

self-interests (all their interests are attributed to them externally), (7)
have no intention and cannot act intentionally, (8) have no inherent
reproductive capacity, (9) cannot be quantified, (10) “have no chro-
mosomes or loci or alleles or sexual recombination.”35 Given these
characteristics, how are memes amenable to scientific study? They
are not measurable, quantifiable, physical, predictable nor any of the
other attributes of genuine scientific objects. Furthermore, they can-
not be subject to evolution in any but a metaphoric sense.

> Consequently, Dawkins’ and Dennett’s meme theory is based on a

> or goals, it cannot have any inherent interests to achieve or lose. Any
‘interests’ it has must be imposed from the outside and Dennett’s “Cui

bono?” question is irrelevant to them.

Dennett attempts to prove that memes exist “because words exist”37
but this too is untenable. In the first place, identifying words with
memes does not escape the problems noted above. Furthermore, a
word may exist physically as sound or as physical marks on paper or
a screen, but the meaning of the word is not inherent in these marks
or sounds—and it is precisely the meaning which is the basis for their
significance as memes. Therefore, if Dennett is referring to the physi-
cal word form, his argument to show memes exist is beside the point
since it says nothing about the meaning of the word/meme. If the
meme is the meaning , then how is meaning measurable, quantifiable,
energetic, or, how is it in time and space? How does it have interests?
In short, it is a non-scientific object and for the new atheists to build
a theory on them is self-contradictory. Indeed, the meaning of a word
is a perfect example of a non-material or non-physical (dare I say

non-positivist?) reality, the existence of which these atheists are eager
to deny in any form. The new atheists cannot demand scientific rigour
from religions on one hand and then appeal to meme (or HADD)
theory on the other.

Like Dawkins’ meme theory, Dennett’s HADD theory is also beside
the point of God’s existence or non-existence. In “investigating the
biological basis of religion,”38 Dennett posits the existence of the
HADD, the brain’s supposed ‘hyper-action agent detection device’
which attributes agency or intention to events and entities around
us.39 This HADD is the alleged origin of our belief in supernatural
phenomenon including God or gods.40 Even if his hypothesis were
true (though Dennett admits it is no more than a convenient supposi-
tion or untested theory41), a theory to explain the origin or prevalence
of an idea can tell us nothing about the truth of an idea. The prevalence
of an idea and the truth of an idea are two different things and we can-
not prove anything about one from the other. Nor can the historical
origin of belief in God or gods be counted as evidence against them
without committing the genetic fallacy. The origins of an idea can
never prove or disprove the truth of an idea. An idea is true or untrue
strictly on its own merits or lack of them.

Furthermore, HADD’s, like memes, are no more than reified assump-
tions and cannot meet the most elementary tests of scientific validity.
Yet Dennett, who admits they are no more than suppositions, and
Dawkins treat them as established fact. This reveals an enormous
self-contradiction in their work: on one hand, they critique religion
for its speculations and lack of scientific explicability while at the
same time indulging in such speculations in their own theories. We
shall have more to say about fallacies involving HADD’s later.

8\. Self-Contradiction: Adopting Eastern Mysticism
Harris falls into a similar self-contradiction regarding his demand
for scientific rigour for all religious claims on one hand and his own

reliance on non-scientific claims on the other. He asserts that eastern
mysticism offers a rationally valid alternative to religion. In defence
of mysticism he writes,

> Mysticism is a rational enterprise. Religion is not. The mystic
> has recognised something about the nature of consciousness
> prior to thought, and this recognition is susceptible to ratio-
> nal discussion. The mystic has reasons for what he believes
> and these reasons are empirical. The roiling mystery of the
> world can be analyzed with concepts (this is science) or it can
> be experienced free of concepts (this is mysticism). 42

> Harris’ initial claim that mysticism is rational is a much debated

> of his self-contradictory statements about it. First, if mysticism is
“consciousness prior to thought,” then it cannot be “susceptible to

Dennett, in serious contradiction with the scientific premises he
supposedly adopts as the basis of his thinking.

9\. Disproving God’s Existence
Because the new atheists realise that atheism requires denial of God’s
existence, they attempt to refute or dismiss various traditional argu-
ments for God’s existence. We shall review and critique a number of
them as well as contrast them to the Bahá’í Writings.

Hitchens, for example, tries to disprove the First Mover argument
by pointing out that the alleged First Mover or First Cause of all
beings, God, must himself have a designer. 43 He asks, ‘Who made
God?’ or as Dennett puts it in launching a similar argument, “What
caused God?”44

There are at least three logical flaws in this line of reasoning. First,
it commits a category mistake, i.e. confuses one kind of object with
another. God, as portrayed by religions, is not a natural object subject
to physical laws and the conditions of existence such as time, place,
contingency or dependence. (SAQ 116, 148, 231) `Abdu’l-Bahá
points out that God “cannot be described in terms which apply to the
phenomenal sphere of the created world,” (PT 50) precisely because
God is not a natural object. Dawkins disagrees, holding that God is
well within the scope of scientific study.45 However, to treat Him as if
He were, necessarily fails to refute the concept of God that is at the
center of the debate. In short, it misses the point completely.

Second, this category mistake leads to a straw-man argument which
does not disprove God as understood by religious practitioners but
only ‘God’ as described by the new atheists. This substitution makes
their conclusion inapplicable to God as conceived by virtually all reli-
gions. The new atheists have, in effect, set up a straw man and, thereby,
changed the subject. Indeed, if God were a natural object amenable
to scientific study, there is no question that the new atheists would

be right in denying His existence but in the debate with religion they
often merely tilt at windmills of their own making.

Third, by asking “What caused God?” Dennett not only makes a cat-
egory mistake but also initiates an actual infinite regress, which, as
already shown, is logically absurd and rejected by `Abdu’l-Bahá. The
question assumes that God, like all other natural objects, requires
a cause and this in turn leads to an infinite regress of actual causal
acts. We have already shown why such an actual infinite regress is
impossible in an earlier section of this paper.

> Dawkins’ makes the same category mistake although he approaches
> the problem from a slightly different angle. He specifically rejects the
“Unmoved Mover” argument, the “Uncaused Cause” argument and

> unfounded. If God were a natural object like all others, Dawkins is

`Abdu’l-Bahá, of course, accepts the argument of the Uncaused Cause,

> which implicitly accepts God as exempt from infinite regress: “there
> must be an independent being whose independence is essential.” (SAQ 6)
> The same conclusion follows from the radical contingency of all things.
“Nothing is caused by itself.”47 In fact, the idea is self-contradictory, i.e.

> literally nonsensical. For a thing to cause itself, it would have to exist
> before it exists—and this is impossible. Therefore, all phenomenal
> things are dependent on an external cause i.e. are contingent and this

line of dependence ends with God. We can only avoid this conclusion
by positing the existence of an actual infinite sequence and all the
associated difficulties to which we have referred.

Dawkins compounds his category mistake of naturalizing God by
stating that the universe, or a Dutchman’s Pipe plant, is too complex
to have been created by a simple being. Thus, God would have to
be at least as complex as His creation—and the existence of such a
super-complex being is even more “improbable”48 than the chance
developments of evolution. Later he elaborates the idea that God
must necessarily be super-complex: “A God capable of continuously
monitoring and controlling the individual status of every particle
in the universe cannot be simple.”49 He also describes God as a “cal-
culating agent”50 of improbable complexity. Underlying Dawkins’
assertions is the assumption that God is a natural object, composed
of matter subject to time, space and causality, and Who reasons
discursively in linear logical sequence. But that is precisely what
religion says God is not. Once again, Dawkins sets up a straw man—
his naturalistic definition of God—and then tries to disprove it. He
does not really deal with God as presented by religion.51

In contradiction to the new atheists’ acceptance of cosmic evolution
as a matter of pure chance, `Abdu’l-Bahá accepts the idea of design.

> This composition and arrangement [of the cosmos], through
> the wisdom of God and His preexistent might, were produced
> from one natural organization, which was composed and com-
> bined with the greatest strength, conformable to wisdom, and
> according to a universal law. From this it is evident that it is
> the creation of God, and is not a fortuitous composition and
> arrangement . (SAQ 181)

We need not look far for the reason. The universe evolved in accor-
dance with natural laws. However, as we have already seen, the

existence of natural laws requires a creator, a transcendent entity not
itself subject to natural law but which establishes natural laws with all
their inherent potentials. When these laws affect matter, they create
the order of which we are aware today. (The same has been noted

> about the attributes and potentials of matter.) Even moments of
> extreme disorder—supernovae, volcanic eruptions—happen accord-
> ing to physical laws. Moreover, as the laws of probability tell us,
‘chance’ functions according to rules which, over time, impose a degree

> of order on seemingly unordered processes. The large scale design we

> to insist that cosmic design must occur by direct intervention at the
> macroscopic level when an explanation based on the laws of nature
> and the attributes of matter provides equally tenable explanations of
> the order we observe.

Thus, in the Bahá’í Writings, there need be no inherent conflict
between the concept of design—in the nature and potentials of
laws and matter—and evolution vis-à-vis the actualization of these
potentials in different forms over time. This weakens the new athe-
ist argument that religion and science are necessarily antagonistic.

Dawkins tries to defuse the traditional argument from degree
according to which the degrees of certain qualities such as good-
ness, perfection or truth require that there be a highest degree as
a reference point for the lesser degrees. He replies that there must
also be degrees of smelliness and therefore, a final “peerless stinker”52
must exist. Obviously he does not understand the argument which
requires us to distinguish between concrete descriptors (smelliness,
redness) and “transcendentals”, i.e. attributes of being itself such as
unity, (oneness), goodness (in itself), truth and perfection. These can
be applied to all beings—while smelliness or redness cannot. Once
again, we observe how Dawkins sets up a straw man argument and

thinks he has demolished the traditional argument when he has not
even addressed it in the first place.

In Some Answered Questions, `Abdu’l-Bahá advances the argument
from perfection as a proof for the existence of God.53 He says, “The
imperfections of the contingent world are in themselves a proof of the
perfections of God.” (SAQ 5) To say that something is imperfect or
approaches perfection more than something else implies the existence
of a perfect standard by which to measure degrees of perfection. Such
a perfect standard ultimately can only refer to God Who possess all
perfections to a supreme degree, including the perfection of existence.
God’s existence is perfect because it is necessary—there simply can
be no greater degree of existence than God’s; furthermore, God’s
existence is fully actual, i.e. God has no potentials left to actualize
(otherwise He would be subject to change). God is complete, indepen-
dent and absolute. On the other hand, the existence of creation is of
a lesser order because it is contingent, dependent and to some degree,
potential.

An existential retort to Dawkins’ position would be to challenge
him to choose non-existence for himself or someone he loves. It is a
certainty that he will immediately and most personally discover the
perfections of existence.

A survey of the new atheist’s work shows their handling of the issue of
philosophical proofs for God’s existence is very weak, and shows little
understanding of the subject. Aside from the problems mentioned
above it should be noted that no major philosophers, even those with
religious commitments, have ever seriously considered the “argument
from scripture,” the “argument from admired religious scientists,”
the argument from personal experience,” or the “argument from
beauty”56 as proofs for God’s existence. Pascal’s Wager is, of course,
not an argument about God’s existence as Dawkins seems to think,
but is an argument about belief.

10\. Morality Versus Religion
One of the major goals of the new atheists is to separate morality from
religion in order to undermine the argument that we need religion to
be moral. They argue that enormous harm has been done in the name
of religion and do not hesitate to provide exhaustive lists of horrors
perpetrated in the name of faith. However, problems arise with their
belief that such crimes are less likely to be committed in the name of
atheism and that atheism has a more humane record.

In fact, the record of Marxist-Leninism, Communism, in which athe-
ism is a foundational and integral part, shows that such is not the
case. In the single century of Communist rule, approximately 100

million people have been programmatically killed in purges, vast
slave labour camp systems, and man-made famines not to mention
the brutalities of the secret police.57 Even a cursory examination of
the history of Communist countries makes it clear that atheism (which
was often taught as a school subject) and atheists have no edge on moral
behavior. The notion that the abolition of religion and its replace-
ment by programmatic atheism would bring the end of murderous
fanaticism is not borne out by history. Only Harris seems fully
aware of this problem—and his response is to say that “communism
was little more than a political religion.”58 In other words, he tries
to re-define communism as a religion—despite the fact that athe-
ism is integral to the ontology, epistemology, ethics, philosophy of
man, and social and political philosophy of Marx, Engels, Lenin and
Mao. For obvious reasons Harris’ response is not credible. Hitchens
admits that “emancipation from religion does not always produce the
best mammal either”59 but this is a statement made in passing and is
not explored as to its implications for his indictment of religion.

> The new atheists believe that we do need not religion as a basis for
> our values and the two must be separated. In their view, we can rely
> on reason as the basis of our morals because we want to “commit our-
> selves to finding a rational foundation for our ethics.”60 Says Hitchens:
“We believe with certainty that an ethical life can be lived without

> religion.”61 For support, he turns to Kant’s categorical imperative (CI)
> which states “I am never to act otherwise than so that I could also will

> vein, Dennett writes, “Maybe people everywhere can be trusted and

What an amazing and revolutionary idea!”63 Superficially this sounds
good and reasonable, but if we ask ‘What principles shall guide these
informed choices?’ difficulties multiply. Whose principles? What
shall ground them? Why should I accept them? What happens if I
disagree with them? Moreover, an even deeper question arises for all
ethical systems grounded only on reason: ‘Why should I be reason-
able? What if it’s to my advantage to act unreasonably? What if I
don’t feel like being reasonable to others?’.

As `Abdu’l-Bahá points out, ethical systems based purely on human
reason can lead us to different, conflicting and even self-contradictory
answers. (SAQ 297) Indeed, ethical viewpoints may be little more
than rationalized personal preferences. Obviously, such a plethora of
competing viewpoints makes society unworkable since the existence
of society depends on an objective standard applicable to all. In other
words, ethical systems based only on reason lack authority and they
lack an objective foundation applicable to all.

11\. The Need for Absolute Ground in Ethics
The new atheists reject the necessity of an enforcing authority for
morals. Dennett, as we have seen, thinks we can rely on individuals
making their own choices, 64 and Harris thinks we can rely on our
moral intuitions (more below) as well as Kant’s other formulation of
the categorical imperative i.e. that we must treat others as ends-in-
themselves and never as merely a means to another end. 65 Hitchens ,
it is fair to say, speaks for these authors when he writes, “there is no
requirement for any enforcing or supernatural authority.”66

There are two problems with this position. First, while it may (or may
not) be an ideal to strive for, the practical problem remains that with-
out consequences, without reward and punishment any ethical system
becomes a dead letter, a mere set of suggestions that some will follow
and others will not. That is why the Bahá’í Writings state “That which
traineth the world is Justice, for it is upheld by two pillars, reward and

punishment. These two pillars are the sources of life to the world.” (TB
27) Bahá’u’lláh also says, “the canopy of world order is upraised upon
the two pillars of reward and punishment.” (TB 126) There must be
consequences to action in order to encourage and reward obedience.

The second problem is that mere human authority, be it of reason or
government lacks the authority to make people accept moral precepts;
they lack the intrinsic authority of God Who is the author of all
that exists. They lack the guarantee of correctness, the certainty, the
objective viewpoint and foundation that only God can provide in
guiding our actions. Yet this is exactly what people need as the new
atheists themselves admit. This is precisely why Kant thought God
was necessary as a regulative idea or principle in morals.

> fact that our ethical intuitions have their roots in biology
> reveals that our efforts to ground ethics in religious concep-
> tions of “moral duty” are misguided…. We simply do not need
> religious ideas to motivate us to live ethical lives.”69

Dennett’s willingness to trust everyone’s informed choices also
implies that we all possess an inner moral standard of reasonableness
to which we will adhere. Dawkins tries to ground the innate moral
sense in our genetic make-up.70

From the viewpoint of the Bahá’í Writings, this position is not so
much incorrect as incomplete, and, therefore, leads to an untenable
conclusion. In the first place, the Writings tell us that humans have the
capacity to be moral i.e. learn moral behaviors but that this capacity
must be actualized by the teachings of a Manifestation acting through
parental and social education. (PUP 400–401) `Abdu'l-Bahá tells us
that “man, if he is left without education, becomes bestial, and, moreover, if
left under the rule of nature, becomes lower than an animal, whereas if he
is educated he becomes an angel.” (SAQ 7) If our good or bad character
is actualized by education, we immediately face questions over what
are the particular principles and teachings we shall inculcate—and
here again, without divinely grounded guidance, we shall be subject
to conflicting opinions and programs. In short, we cannot rely only on
the innate capacity to be moral for morality in practice.

This difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that humankind has a divine
or spiritual aspect, (SAQ 118) that might be compared to the innate
moral sense posited by the new atheists. However, the Writings
also note that humankind has an animal nature in conflict with our
spiritual nature, and may overcome it by force or deception. The new
atheists have not taken this animal nature into account in the unfold-
ing of our moral lives and, therefore, have over-simplified the issue of
innate moral intuitions. As `Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> The promptings of the heart are sometimes satanic. How are we
> to differentiate them? How are we to tell whether a given state-
> ment is an inspiration and prompting of the heart through the
> merciful assistance or through the satanic agency? (PUP 254)

Because this question cannot be answered immanently, i.e. from the
standpoint of reason or intuition alone, we require an external guide
or objective standpoint by which to evaluate our ethical promptings
and decisions. This is precisely the role filled by God and the Mani-
festation. “He [man] has the animal side as well as the angelic side, and

the aim of an educator is to so train human souls that their angelic aspect
may overcome their animal side.” (SAQ 235) However, if we reject God
as the ground of our morality, then all moral systems inevitably fall
into relativism and conflict as various moral conceptions compete.
This is not conducive to the peaceful world both the new atheists, the
Bahá’ís, and all people of good will want to establish.

In other words, the Bahá’í Writings lead us to believe that there is
an innate moral capacity in man but that this moral sense needs to
be cultivated and developed by education from parents and teach-
ers but above all, by the Manifestations of God. The view that this
innate moral capacity may have biological roots is not a problem from
a Bahá’í perspective, indeed, is to be expected given that man is an
embodied creature. Thus, Bahá’ís may agree that science can study
the biological basis of ethics, without at the same time succumbing to
the reductionist view that all ethics can be reduced to biology.

12\. Faith Versus Reason

The new atheists also posit an inherent conflict between faith and
reason. Hitchens sums up their views when he writes, “All attempts
to reconcile faith with science and reason are consigned to failure and
ridicule.”71 Harris claims,

> Religious faith represents so uncompromising a misuse of
> the power of our minds that it forms a kind of perverse,
> cultural singularity—a vanishing point beyond which
> rational discourse proves impossible.72

For his part, Dawkins says, “religious faith is an especially potent
silencer of rational calculation, which usually seems to trump all
others.”73 Such sentiments inevitably lead us to questions about the
nature and scope of reason.

The new atheists’ work makes it clear that in their model of reasoning,
they identify reason with science and the scientific method, i.e. with
a naturalist view of reason in which reason must function within
the limits of nature as understood by science. Any knowledge-
claims that transcend the natural realm and therefore cannot meet
the standards of scientific knowledge are not genuine knowledge.
Consequently, reason is fundamentally incompatible with belief in
super-natural or super-sensible beings or realities and is also incom-
patible with faith which is “simply unjustified belief.”74 Indeed, faith
simply shows an unwillingness “to stoop to reason when it [faith] has
no good reason to believe.”75 In effect faith is inherently irrational,
and, therefore, inherently incompatible with reason. Whatever we
designate as knowledge must be rational, i.e. explicable in rational
terms, and must fall within the limits of nature as established by
science. There is no such thing as knowledge that transcends our
natural limits; reason only functions correctly when it limits itself
to the natural world. Any attempt to reason beyond physical nature
opens the way to theological superstition.

We have already discussed the logical short-comings of this viewpoint,
i.e. its inability to meet its own standards for genuine knowledge. Since
experiments are limited to the natural realm, no experiment can tell
us anything one way or another about the existence or non-existence
of super-natural or super-sensible aspects of reality. Consequently, the
naturalist viewpoint is itself a form of faith as the new atheists define
it, i.e. “belief without evidence.”76

In contrast to the new atheists who embrace an extreme rationalism
which asserts that only positivist or scientifically rational knowledge
is true knowledge, `Abdu’l-Bahá maintains a moderate rationalism.
According to moderate rationalism, reason can tell us some things
but not everything; it is necessary for the acquisition of knowledge
but it is not always sufficient. While reason may prepare the way or
lay the foundations for certain kinds of knowledge, there comes a

> point in the quest for knowledge, when we must rely on other ways
> of knowing. That is why `Abdu’l-Bahá points out that the mind
> which is “a power of the human spirit” must be augmented by a super-
> natural power if it is to acquire knowledge of super-sensible realities:
“the human spirit, unless assisted by the spirit of faith, does not become

> acquainted with the divine secrets and the heavenly realities.” (SAQ
> 208) Reason alone cannot supply us with certain spiritual truths the
> knowledge of which requires super-natural guidance or inspiration.
> Nor can it provide complete certainty which is why other ways of
> knowing are necessary. `Abdu’l-Bahá points out that

> the bounty of the Holy Spirit gives the true method of comprehen-
> sion which is infallible and indubitable. This is through the help
> of the Holy Spirit which comes to man, and this is the condition
> in which certainty can alone be attained. (SAQ 299)

Similarly, in discussing various proofs of God, `Abdu’l-Bahá states,

> if the inner perception be open, a hundred thousand clear proofs
> become visible. Thus, when man feels the indwelling spirit, he is
> in no need of arguments for its existence; but for those who are
> deprived of the bounty of the spirit, it is necessary to establish
> external arguments. (SAQ 6)

In other words, when the mind is clear and open, we can perceive
directly truths which we otherwise must laboriously prove by discur-
sive reasoning. We acquire knowledge by immediate insight because
we are enlightened by the “the luminous rays which emanate from the
Manifestations.” (SAQ 108)

It is clear that one of the functions of reason is to remove the intel-
lectual, attitudinal and emotional impediments that block our direct
vision of the truth. Reason, so to speak, clears the path for faith
because faith, too, is another way of knowing certain kinds of truth.

Faith need not be ‘blind’ or ‘ignorant.’ As `Abdu’l-Bahá says, “By the
faith is meant, first, conscious knowledge, and second, the practice of
good deeds,” (TAB3 549) which shows that “conscious knowledge” is
an integral part of faith.

Elsewhere he speaks of the kind of faith “which comes from Knowledge,
and is the faith of understanding” (ABL 64) This latter kind of faith
culminates in “the faith of practice.” (ibid) He also points out that faith
gives us “the capacity to partake of the lights of knowledge and wisdom.”
(TAB1 166) Furthermore, `Abdu’l-Bahá says, “If a question be found
contrary to reason, faith and belief in it are impossible and there is no
outcome but wavering and vacillation.” (PUP 181)

Very obviously, the Bahá’í Writings do not view faith as ‘ignorant
faith’ but see reason and faith working together, two wings of a bird,
(TAB1 178) to provide knowledge of both the sensible/physical and
super-sensible aspects of reality. Consequently, the clash between
faith and reason is not inherent or necessary as the new atheists claim
but is a product of unclear thinking.

13\. Intolerance Against Religion
One of the areas of major disagreement between the Bahá’í Writings
and the new atheism is the latter’s emphatic rejection not just of the
intolerance shown by religions but also for inter-religious tolerance
itself. Sam Harris writes,

> religious moderates are themselves the bearers of a terrible
> dogma: they imagine that the path to peace will be paved
> once each of us has learned to respect the unjustified beliefs
> of others. I hope to show that the very ideal of religious
> tolerance—born of the notion that every person can believe
> whatever he wants about God—is one of the principle forces
> driving us toward the abyss.77

> It is worth pointing out that religious tolerance is demonized—in
> favour of atheist intolerance, a self-contradiction given the new
> atheism’s attack on intolerance by religion. It is also a case of special
> pleading insofar as they apparently believe that atheist intolerance is
> somehow salutary. However, the new atheists go farther. Harris writes,
“It is time we recognized that belief is not a private matter … beliefs

> are scarcely more private than actions are.”78 If beliefs are as public
> as actions, then they are subject to law and punishment like actions.
> Here we observe a more repressive side of the new atheism, which also
> becomes apparent when Dawkins writes

> children have a right not to have their minds addled by non-
> sense, and we as a society have a duty to protect them from it.
> So we should not allow more parents to teach their children
> to believe … [any more] than we should allow parents to
> knock their children’s teeth out or lock them in a dungeon.79

As with Harris’s challenge to the concept of religion as a private
personal matter, Dawkins’ claim suggests the instrument of law may
have to be used to “protect them [children] from it [religion.” Hitchens’
suggestion that teaching religion is “child-abuse”80 implies a similar
line of action since child-abuse is not something any society should
tolerate. He would at the very least forbid religious instruction until
a child has attained “the age of reason.”81 Admittedly, Hitchens says
he would not ban religion even if he could, but in light of his extreme
rhetoric throughout his book, and especially in light of his claim that
religious instruction is child abuse, this statement rings hollow. The
intolerance of the new atheists—though it must be noted Dennett is
largely free of this—also manifests itself in their expressions of con-
tempt, gratuitous insults and other rhetorical theatrics during their
discussions. These might make their works more entertaining but
they do nothing to strengthen their arguments.

14\. Belief in Belief
Perhaps the best portion of Breaking the Spell deals with Dennett’s
concept of “belief in belief,”82 which he describes not as belief in
God but belief that belief in God is a good thing, “something to be
encouraged and fostered wherever possible.”83 He points out that “It
is entirely possible to be an atheist and believe in belief in God.”84
He also suggests that some individuals who find their faith in God
waning, try to restore their faith by enlisting others to believe in
God. According to Dennett, while many believe in God, “Many
more people believe in belief in God”85 which he regards as a kind of
unconscious or unadmitted atheism. People no longer believe in God
but in a concept.

This raises an interesting question: ‘Is belief in the belief in God a
kind of belief or unbelief?’ Can a person who believes that belief in
God is a good really be considered an atheist, or is belief in the good-
ness of the concept of God itself a kind of faith in God? Has such an
individual not taken the first intellectual step towards belief in God,
i.e. is such a person not already on the road to faith insofar as she/he
recognises a unique goodness lies in a certain kind of belief? If, moreover,
we combine this belief or faith with action, as required by 'Abdu'l-Bahá,
then belief in belief may, indeed, be a kind of faith.

The Bible also contains a relevant passage on this issue. The father of a
child whom Christ was asked to heal said, “Lord, I believe; help thou
mine unbelief.”86 Like Dennett’s believer in belief, he, too, suffered
from unbelief—yet because he recognised the goodness of belief,
Christ accepted his statement as a statement of belief and healed the
child. Unlike Dennett, therefore, we may interpret belief in belief as a
species of belief in God, at least in principle. Dennett’s understanding
of belief in belief as a form of atheism does not necessarily follow
from such belief itself.

15: Literalism
One of the new atheists’ major problems from a Bahá’í perspective
is their consistent literalism in reading Jewish, Christian and Mus-
lim scripture. They read scripture in its explicit and most obvious
sense and reject non-literal understandings. Dawkins rails against
theologians who “employ their favourite trick of interpreting selected
scriptures as ‘symbolic’ rather than literal. By what criteria do you
decide which passages are symbolic, which literal?” 87 Assuming there
is no rational answer, he simply continues his literalism, a practice
supported by Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens. In this sense,
the new atheists resemble their fundamentalist opponents who also
have a strong tendency to literalist readings of scripture.

There are two kinds of problems with new atheist literalism. The first
concerns their neglect of centuries, indeed, millennia of non-literalist
interpretation of scripture. This is not the appropriate place for a
survey of scriptural interpretation, so we shall be content with two
examples from Christianity. Already as early as the 5th century A.D.,
Augustine in his “The Literal Interpretation of Genesis” states that the
creation story does not refer to seven actual days and that the time
framework is not to be taken literally. The story conveys a spiritual
meaning not a scientific account that can be expected to replicate
modern cosmological findings. In more recent times, we have devel-
oped existential ways88 of reading scripture as well as Bultmann’s de-
mythologizing which understands scripture as dealing with the pos-
sibilities and conditions of human existence and decision-making. 89
In addition, we might consider the point that the spiritual teachings
are communicated through “symbolic forms… which are designed to
reach the more hidden levels in us of instinct, feeling, and intuition.”90
Dawkins seems unaware of these possibilities and gives no reasons why
this history should be ignored, i.e. why we should simply accept his
unsupported assertion that symbolic readings are all a “trick.”

Whether we read symbolically or literally depends entirely on how
we understand the intention or main idea of scriptural passage or
story. It need not always be to convey actual historical events. It
may, for example, function as a ‘myth,’ i.e. as an account in external
worldly terms of inner psychological and spiritual processes. William
Blake, for example, thought of the Exodus story as a journey from
enslavement to a false notion of self and a struggle to attain a true
one. It may be to convey the nature of (an) existential choice, such as
Abraham’s or to draw attention to our need to recognise overwhelm-
ing and mysterious powers in our existence as in Job. In light of the
history of scriptural interpretation, we can only conclude that the
new atheists adopt literalism because it suits their polemical purpose
of presenting religion in its most negative light.

From the viewpoint of the Bahá’í Writings, the second problem
with literalism is that it rejects non-literal or symbolic readings of
scripture. Perhaps `Abdu’l-Bahá sums up the Bahá’í position most
succinctly when he states “The texts of the Holy Books are all symbolical.”
(PUP 220) For example, in Some Answered Questions, `Abdu’l-Bahá
provides extensive symbolic interpretations of Biblical books and
stories; indeed, of the story of Adam and Eve, he says “if the literal
meaning of this story were attributed to a wise man, certainly all would
logically deny that this arrangement, this invention, could have ema-
nated from an intelligent being.” (SAQ 123) Clearly he recognizes its
irrationality at the literal level. Similarly, Bahá’u’lláh’s Kitáb-i-Íqán
(The Book of Certitude) is a non-literal, symbolic reading of portions
of the Qur’án and other Muslim theological statements. Bahá’u’lláh
makes it clear that those who do not apprehend the inner, symbolic
meaning of these terms, will inevitably suffer:

> Yea, inasmuch as the peoples of the world have failed to seek
> from the luminous and crystal Springs of divine knowledge
> the inner meaning of God’s holy words, they therefore have

> languished, stricken and sore athirst, in the vale of idle fancy
> and waywardness. (KI 105)

Insofar as the new atheism has confined itself to the outward, explicit
meaning of scriptures, it is, like fundamentalism, lost “in the vale of
idle fancy and waywardness.” He adds, that “the commentators of the
Qur’án and they that follow the letter thereof misapprehended the inner
meaning of the words of God and failed to grasp their essential purpose.”
(KI 115) This would certainly include the new atheists.

The new atheists cling to literal readings of scripture for the obvious
reason that many of their complaints about religion would evaporate
if scripture were understood symbolically. For example, problems
with the Biblical creation account or with the story of Adam and Eve
would be resolved in symbolic understandings. This weakens their
case against religion.

16\. Presentism
The final problem with the new atheism to be discussed is presentism,
i.e. the logical fallacy of evaluating past societies which existed in com-
pletely different physical, cultural, economic, social and psychological
circumstances by the standards of 21st century ideals as developed in
advanced, post-industrial nations. Presentism is a particular form of
the logical flaw known as anachronism which distorts our understand-
ing of past societies and actions by introducing incongruous standards
into our study of past societies. It is rooted in overlooking, ignoring or
misunderstanding the fact that earlier historical circumstances may
have required responses that would strike us as immoral.

Hitchens’ discussion of the Old and New Testaments represents
the presentism found throughout the work of the new atheists. His
discussion of the “pitiless teachings of the god of Moses”91 shows no
awareness of the time-frame he is considering, nor of the cultural
conditions and political circumstances with other tribes. The laws

may, indeed, strike us as harsh or odd—but to expect the ancient
Jews living in a ‘tough neighbourhood’ to have been governed by
laws suitable for 21st century post-industrial democracies shows
enormous historical insensitivity. Speaking of Christ’s beatitudes,
Hitchens writes, “several are absurd and show a primitive attitude to
agriculture (this extends to all mentions of plowing and sowing, and
all allusions to mustard and fig trees)”92 Why would he object to the
agricultural references in parables delivered in a time when the vast
majority of humans were involved in agriculture?

Ironically, the new atheists’ presentism is a failure to adopt an evo-
lutionary viewpoint on human development, a failure to recognise
that just as humankind’s body has evolved, so has its capacity to
understand moral and religious concepts. For that reason, expecting
the same level of moral and religious understanding from ancient
peoples living in wholly different circumstances is not a rational
response. Furthermore, presentism involves the new atheists in a
self-contradiction with their declared evolutionary principles. Con-
sequently, this self-contradiction undermines their claim to base
their arguments in strictly rational and scientific principles.

Part II: Areas of Convergence or Agreement
Despite the significant differences between the Bahá’í Writings and
the new atheism, there are at least seven points on which they agree
or at least converge.

17\. The Evolution of Religion

> Because of their advocacy of the scientific method, the new atheists
> agree that religion should be explored and discussed in evolutionary
> terms. Dennett, for example, says that the super-natural creatures
“that crowd the mythologies of every people are the imaginative off-

spring of a hyperactive habit of finding agency wherever anything

puzzles or frightens us.”93 The HADD, which started out as a coping
mechanism, a “Good Trick, rapidly became a practical necessity of
human life”94 and thereby came to control and blind us. Hitchens
traces the origins of religion to earliest man’s “babyish attempts to
meet our inescapable demand for knowledge.”95 Now that we have
science, we have outgrown it. Dawkins presents two theories about
the evolutionary origin of religion. In one, religion’s roots are the
evolution-based tendency for children to “believe without question
whatever your grown-ups tell you.”96 The other is that religion “is a
by-product of the misfiring of several of these modules”97, i.e. data
processing units in the brain as it evolved. Thus religion is essentially
pathological, “an accidental by-product—a misfiring of something
useful.”98 The time has come to correct this mistake.

From a Bahá’í perspective, there is no inherent difficulty with
an evolutionary approach to understanding religion. Indeed, it is
amazingly close to the teaching of progressive revelation according
to which “the exoteric forms of the divine teachings” (SAQ 75) are
adapted to physical, historical and cultural conditions that evolve
over time, while the inner or “esoteric meaning” (SAQ 120) or “eternal
verities” (PDC 108) remain constant to meet the universal needs of
our human nature. Each Manifestation

> restates the eternal verities they [previous religions] enshrine,
> coordinates their functions, distinguishes the essential and
> the authentic from the nonessential and spurious in their
> teachings, separates the God-given truths from the priest-
> prompted superstitions. (PDC 108)

By distinguishing the essential from the non-essential and the
man-made from the God-given, the Manifestation renews religion,
providing it with a new outward form appropriate to new circum-
stances with new teachings or restatements (ibid) of universal
truths suited to a new era. He cleanses religion of that which is

“man-made,”99 since the Bahá’í Writings agree with Hitchens' point

> that much of what passes for religion is man-made. Through this
> process of cleansing reform and augmentation, religion evolves and
> continues to evolve without any foreseeable end.

Consequently, Bahá’ís are not surprised to find that different—per-
haps to us shocking—laws were proclaimed in earlier times, that
different practices held sway along with substantially different beliefs.
Rather than condemn them from our current viewpoint we should try
to understand these laws, practices and beliefs as agents in creating a
unified society, often struggling for survival against implacable ene-
mies. What progressive evolution shows is that God, works through
history within the limitations of human beings endowed with free will,
who often find themselves caught in very difficult circumstances. In
these circumstances, it may have been necessary to punish adultery
or theft very harshly for the cohesion and well-being of the group. We
should also remember that perhaps one people was more receptive
to God’s message than others and, thereby, became a special vehicle
for human religious evolution. Surrounded by mortal enemies, these
more receptive peoples may have been forced to take what strikes us
now as gratuitously harsh action.

From a Bahá’í perspective, there is no difficulty in saying that reli-
gion started with a HADD for example or has roots in a child’s trust
in its parents. Hitchens informs us there would be no churches “if
humanity had not been afraid of the weather, the dark, the plague,
the eclipse and all manner of other things now easily explicable.”100
This may be true, but anyone who thinks this disproves the truth
of religion is simply committing the genetic fallacy, a logical error
according to which we de-value something on the basis of its origin
instead of its present state.101 HADD, childish trust or childish fear
are only the avenues by which religious phenomena may have first
appeared in the world—and these avenues of emergence, determined
as they are by their cultural circumstances, do not necessarily negate

the truth value inherent in the beliefs that appear. Given the vulner-
ability of their rather short lives, it makes no sense to expect that our
ancestors would have the same sophisticated religious understanding
that is available in our day. However, their lack of sophistication does
not prove they were not ‘onto something’ in their intuitions about
super-sensible realities. If we demythologize these beliefs, we may
indeed find valuable insights. 102

18\. Crimes on God’s Name
Another area of significant agreement between the Bahá’í Writings
and the new atheists concerns the crimes that have often been com-
mitted in the name of religion, not to mention injustice and corruption.
The Writings make no effort to conceal or sweeten the misdeeds that
have been perpetrated under the guise of religious teachings. Frank
recognition of these sad developments is integral to the doctrine of
progressive revelation since all religions and civilizations follow the
seasonal cycle which begins with a pure spring inspired by revelation
but ends with a winter in which

> only the name of the Religion of God remains, and the exoteric
> forms of the divine teachings. The foundations of the Religion of
> God are destroyed and annihilated, and nothing but forms and
> customs exist. Divisions appear… (SAQ 74)

`Abdu’l-Bahá also says,

> The beginnings of all great religions were pure; but priests,
> taking possession of the minds of the people, filled them with
> dogmas and superstitions, so that religion became gradually
> corrupt. (PUP 406)

These corruptions led to false doctrines that encouraged war and
destruction:

> I wish to explain to you the principal reason of the unrest
> among nations. The chief cause is the misrepresentation
> of religion by the religious leaders and teachers. They teach
> their followers to believe that their own form of religion is the
> only one pleasing to God…. Hence arise among the peoples,
> disapproval, contempt, disputes and hatred. If these religious
> prejudices could be swept away, the nations would soon enjoy
> peace and concord. (PT 45–46)103

In the words of Christopher Hitchens, “religion has been an enormous
multiplier of tribal suspicion and hatred, with members of each group
talking of the other in precisely the tones of the bigot.”104 Overcoming
these prejudices and divisions is the purpose of Bahá’u’lláh’s mission:

> The utterance of God is a lamp, whose light is these words: Ye
> are the fruits of one tree, and the leaves of one branch. Deal
> ye one with another with the utmost love and harmony, with
> friendliness and fellowship… So powerful is the light of unity
> that it can illuminate the whole earth. (GWB 288)

The Writings also denounce religion’s attempts to suppress the
development of science, the ignorance of the clergy, the undue wealth
of the churches compared to the poverty of Christ and the masses,
and its interference in politics among other things.105 Although the
Bahá’í Writings do not express themselves as flamboyantly as the
new atheists, they are equally clear in condemning the abuses per-
petrated by religion and are equally determined to eliminate such
practices. Moreover, like the new atheists, the Writings view the
elimination of religion as a better alternative to continued division
and conflict: “If religion becomes the source of antagonism and strife, the
absence of religion is to be preferred.” (PUP 117)

The Bahá’í Faith and the new atheists differ on this issue only inso-
far as the new atheists want to remedy this problem by abolishing

religion altogether as an irremediable destructive force, while the
Bahá’í Faith sees the solution in progressive revelation and above
all, in the revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. In the Bahá’í view, atheism and
strictly man-made moral systems will not achieve the desired goal of
a world that is at peace with itself and its environment.

However, we must not forget that the new atheists and the Bahá’í
Revelation are responses to the same problem, i.e. global disunity,
ignorance and the depredations of corrupt religion. This fact forms
a basis for positive dialogue with the new atheists despite the differ-
ence in solutions. Unfortunately, the dogmatic denial that religion
has anything worthwhile to contribute to such a debate tends to
inhibit such a dialogue.

19\. Respecting Science and Reason
Another significant area of agreement between the Bahá’í Writings
and the new atheists is importance of reason and science in human
existence. Since we have already explored the new atheism’s commit-
ments to reason and rationality in the previous section, we shall point
out a few Bahá’í statements on this subject to show that a basis for
dialogue exists. For example, `Abdu’l-Bahá says that “in this age the
peoples of the world need the arguments of reason.” (SAQ 7) Elsewhere
he proclaims, “Science is an effulgence of the Sun of Reality, the power
of investigating and discovering the verities of the universe, the means by
which man finds a pathway to God.” (PUP 49) He sees no inherent
and necessary conflict between reason, science and religion, a concept
emphasised in the following:

> The third principle or teaching of Bahá’u’lláh is the oneness of
> religion and science. Any religious belief which is not conformable
> with scientific proof and investigation is superstition, for true sci-
> ence is reason and reality, and religion is essentially reality and
> pure reason; therefore, the two must correspond. (PUP 107)

Also:

> Material science is the investigation of natural phenomena;
> divine science is the discovery and realization of spiritual
> verities. The world of humanity must acquire both…. Both
> are necessary—one the natural, the other supernatural; one
> material, the other divine. (PUP 138)

Finally, he points out the intimate connection between faith and
belief and rationality, making clear that irrational faith is not just
undesirable but essentially impossible:

> Unquestionably there must be agreement between true religion
> and science. If a question be found contrary to reason, faith and
> belief in it are impossible, and there is no outcome but wavering
> and vacillation. (PUP 181)

These statements demonstrate that according to the Bahá’í Writ-
ings, faith is not just “belief without evidence”106 or ‘blind faith.’
Indeed, in the foregoing quotation, `Abdu’l-Bahá makes it clear
that genuine faith in opposition to reason cannot exist since it leads
to “wavering and vacillation.” Faith must include knowledge and
understanding, because without them, even the strongest commit-
ment is bound to weaken.

`Abdu’l-Bahá’s pronouncements potentially form the basis for a

> far-reaching dialogue about the nature, strengths and limitations
> of reason, as well as the relationship between reason, science and
> religious faith. However, it must be admitted that such a dialogue
> will be fraught with challenges given the new atheist’s insistence
> on a positivist and materialist view of science and reason and the
> Bahá’í Writings’ allegiance to moderate rationalism and belief in
> the super-sensible.

20\. The Independent Investigation of Truth
The new atheists certainly agree that the quest for truth should be
independent, i.e. unhindered by religious institutions such as the
Inquisition or by religious beliefs. Otherwise, how can we know what
the truth is on any subject? As `Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> The first is the independent investigation of truth; for blind
> imitation of the past will stunt the mind. But once every soul
> inquireth into truth, society will be freed from the darkness of
> continually repeating the past. (SWAB 248)

Elsewhere he says,

> God has conferred upon and added to man a distinctive power,
> the faculty of intellectual investigation into the secrets of creation,
> the acquisition of higher knowledge, the greatest virtue of which
> is scientific enlightenment. (PUP 30)

Bearing in mind that ‘science’ here does not refer to naturalistic or
material scientism that `Abdu’l-Bahá rejects elsewhere,107 we see
that the quest for knowledge is one of humankind’s distinguishing
features. This independent investigation is necessary not just for a
few but for “every soul” so that all human beings can take responsi-
bility for what they believe. Consequently, there can be no inherent
objection to a Bahá’í investigating the new atheism and testing its
arguments by the standards of logic, philosophy, science, history and
theology. Nor is there any objection to Dennett’s suggestion that
we teach children “about all the world’s religions, in a matter of fact,
historically and biologically informed way.”108 The only stipulation
would be that such teaching must be complete, i.e. students must
also be equipped with understanding of the inherent limitations of
naturalistic science, so that their understanding may be conscious
and critical and so that one dogmatic "faith-based" preference is not

simply replaced by another. In that way, each individual will be able
to be able to give informed consent to whatever ideas she/he adopts.

21\. Ethical Realism
Although the new atheists and the Bahá’í Writings disagree about the
role of religion in ethics, they do agree on ethical realism, i.e. the view
that moral beliefs are not simply a matter of individual preference
but rather that “in ethics, as in physics, there are truths waiting to be
discovered—and thus we can be right or wrong in our beliefs about
them.”109 This view is already implicit in their belief in some kind of
universal ethical intuition which can be applied to all peoples at all
times. Leaving aside the issue of how this universal ethical intuition
might be manifested in different evolutionary circumstances, the
new atheists and the Bahá’í Writings can agree that certain ethical
virtues are objectively valid, among them compassion and goodwill,
(SAQ 301) justice and fairness, tolerance, generosity and a dedication
to truth.

An ethical realist position also means that the new atheists and the
Bahá’í Writings agree on the rejection of relativism in ethics, i.e. they
agree that ethical viewpoints are more than reflections of person pref-
erences. They reject the view that we cannot judge ethical viewpoints
because we lack an objective, Archimedean standpoint from which to
make judgements. For the new atheists, this standard consists in our
innate moral intuitions, and for Bahá’ís, this standard is established
by God and is sometimes available through the moral intuitions of
our spiritual nature.

The issue of ethical realism gives the new atheists and the Bahá’í
Writings common ground in their opposition to ethical relativism as
exemplified in postmodern philosophy.110 It also provides common
ground in regards to the essential unity of human nature, in regards
to ethical intuitions and their possible genetic basis, i.e. a universal
human nature which provides an objective basis for unity.

22\. Objective Correspondence Epistemology
The agreement between the new atheists and the Bahá’í Writings on
ethical realism has far-reaching implications, into epistemology for
example. If there are universal, objectively knowable (and innate) eth-
ical standards, then it follows that at least some knowledge is objec-
tive, that it is possible to evaluate at least some knowledge vis-à-vis
truth and falseness. This lays the basis for an objective epistemology,
i.e. the claim that all truth-claims are not necessarily mere individual
or cultural constructions without correspondence to reality.

The new atheists’ adherence to an objective epistemology is self-
evident from even the most cursory survey of their books; after all,
the whole enterprise of science is predicated on the principle that our
discoveries correspond to or tell us something about reality. There
may be interpretational differences whether this knowledge is about
reality in itself or to reality in inter-action with us, but in the final
analysis we gain some testable and objective knowledge about real-
ity itself. This agrees with `Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement that “the rational
soul gradually discover[s] … [and] comprehends the realities, the proper-
ties and the effects of contingent beings.” (SAQ 217–18) In other words,
the rational soul does not construct these realities, which is to say
that these “realities” exist independently of the human perceiver.
Elsewhere `Abdu’l-Bahá states,

> the rational soul as far as human ability permits discovers the
> realities of things and becomes cognizant of their peculiarities and
> effects, and of the qualities and properties of beings. (SAQ 208)

Again, the emphasis is on discovery and on acquiring knowledge,
becoming “cognizant” of the attributes of things. These properties are
not ‘subjective,’ i.e. ascribed to things by humankind either as indi-
viduals or as cultures. Here is another statement from `Abdu’l-Bahá:

> The mind and the thought of man sometimes discover truths, and
> from this thought and discovery signs and results are produced.
> This thought has a foundation. But many things come to the
> mind of man which are like the waves of the sea of imaginations;
> they have no fruit, and no result comes from them. (SAQ 253)

Here `Abdu’l-Bahá goes into more detail. Discoveries lead to “thought
[that] has a foundation,” i.e. a foundation in reality, i.e. corresponds to
reality. This, in effect, asserts an objective, correspondence theory of
truth in which correct thought has a “ foundation” or basis in reality,
which is to say, corresponds to reality. `Abdu’l-Bahá also differenti-
ates such thought from imaginations which he says lead to no real
results. He also states,

> Reflect that man’s power of thought consists of two kinds. One
> kind is true, when it agrees with a determined truth. Such
> conceptions find realization in the exterior world; such are
> accurate opinions, correct theories, scientific discoveries and
> inventions. (SAQ 251)111

> Here he speaks specifically of a knowledge that “agrees with a deter-
> mined truth,” i.e. knowledge that corresponds to reality. He also
> provides a test for this knowledge: it leads to “accurate opinions” and
“correct theories” which conform to reality as well as to discoveries and

> inventions. In other words, such knowledge has real results testable
> with the reality in question.

`Abdu’l-Bahá reinforces the correspondence theory of knowledge in

a variety of statements. As already noted, `Abdu’l-Bahá states that
“Philosophy consists in comprehending the reality of things as they exist,

> according to the capacity and the power of man.” (SAQ 221) To compre-
> hend the reality of things “as they exist” is nothing other than to have
> one’s knowledge correspond to reality. Naturally, this comprehension
> is limited by our station and capacities but this does not mean that

what we do in fact comprehend does not correspond to reality. For
example, the statement that the interior angles of a triangle add up
to 180 degrees is true—but only in plane geometry. This statement is
true but limited. The same holds for our true but limited knowledge
of reality.

23\. Realist Ontology
Along with a realist ethics and a realist epistemology, the new atheists
and the Bahá’í Writings share a realist ontology. In its simplest terms,
ontology is one’s theory of reality, its nature and modes of being.
Although ontology seems far removed from ordinary human con-
cerns, all human beings and cultures possess an ontology, although
it is usually unconscious. For example, the simple statement, ‘I shall
walk the dog’ assumes (a) that ‘I’ exists in some way, (b) that ‘I’ have
could make such a decision, (c) the dog exists in some way, (d) that ‘I’
and the dog are distinct and separate entities, exterior to each other,
(e) that motion is possible and real and that (f) the city street outside
also exists. While this may seem self-evident to some, to others, such
as those who believe the world is an illusion or maya, or who believe
that the self is an illusion, none of these points are necessarily obvious.

It is undeniable that the new atheists and the Bahá’í Writings dis-
agree about the ontology in regards to the existence or non-existence
of any super-sensible reality. Naturally, the new atheists reject the
super-natural. However, they do agree with the Writings that the
world is real in its own right i.e. exists independently of human
perception and possess some “principle, foundation, or reality” (SAQ
278) which gives it existence in itself. In SAQ, `Abdu’l-Bahá flatly
rejects the view that reality is a phantasm created by humankind:

> Certain sophists think that existence is an illusion, that each
> being is an absolute illusion which has no existence—in other
> words, that the existence of beings is like a mirage, or like the
> reflection of an image in water or in a mirror, which is only an

> appearance having in itself no principle, foundation or reality.

This theory is erroneous. (SAQ 278)

It is noteworthy that `Abdu’l-Bahá refers to those who maintain that
the world is an “absolute illusion” as “sophists,” a term traditionally
associated with flawed and deceptive reasoning. Use of this term
signals his rejection of ‘illusionism’ or ‘phenomenalism’ which is
confirmed by his statement that “[t]his theory is erroneous.”

Further support for ontological realism is found in `Abdu’l-Bahá’s
statement that “each being” in the exterior world is real, i.e. possesses
some “principle, foundation, or reality” which give it some degree of
existence “in itself.” (SAQ 278) In other words, “each being” has at
least some degree of innate existence, is individual, is distinct and
possesses some detachment or independence from other beings and
is, in that sense, unique. As `Abdu’l-Bahá’ says in a later section of
this passage, “in their own degree they [things in the exterior world]
exist.” (SAQ 278) Each thing “in the condition of being…has a real
and certain existence.” They are not mere “appearances” of something
else, i.e. epiphenomena, passive side-effects or by-products that pos-
sesses no “principle, foundation or reality” of their own. This idea is
re-enforced by the following statement:

> for though the existence of beings in relation to the existence
> of God is an illusion, nevertheless, in the condition of being it
> has a real and certain existence. It is futile to deny this. For
> example, the existence of the mineral in comparison with that
> of man is nonexistence…; but the mineral has existence in
> the mineral world…Then it is evident that although beings in
> relation to the existence of God have no existence, but are like
> the mirage or the reflections in the mirror, yet in their own
> degree they exist. (SAQ 278)

This statement makes it unequivocably clear that according to
`Abdu’l-Bahá while degrees of reality differ, every being is, in its own

> degree, undeniably real. It is worth noting that he flatly rejects any
> contradictory viewpoint: “It is futile to deny this,” he says, thereby
> foreclosing any argument to the contrary. He emphasises the reality
> of creation elsewhere by stating “Now this world of existence in relation
> to its maker is a real phenomenon.” (SAQ 280) In other words, it has
> its own, undeniable degree of reality.

The new atheists also accept the objective reality of the exterior
world, which they understand as being purely material or physical
and amenable to adequate study by the scientific method. Of course,
where the new atheists and the Bahá’í Writings differ is whether
the objectively known reality which exists independently of human
perception and possesses its own degree of reality, is limited to the
physical or includes the super-sensible. This is a serious difference
but it should not blind us to the fundamental agreement about
ontological realism. Ironically on this, and the previously noted
fundamental philosophical issues, the new atheists and the Bahá’í
Writings share more common ground with each other than they do
with postmodernist philosophy.

Conclusion
As is to be expected, there are far more differences than similarities
between the new atheists and the Bahá’í Writings—though the
extent of the similarities and their foundational nature is surpris-
ing. The question remains, however, ‘Are these similarities enough to
allow a meaningful dialogue between the two?’ Can the differences
between the new atheists and the Bahá’í Writings be bridged? In
other words, is there anything the two can build on together?

On the foundational issues there is no common ground: they cannot
agree on
1\.   the existence or non-existence of super-natural or super-

> sensible beings (God) or realities (Abhá Kingdom, Holy
> Spirit). [ontology]

2\.   the adequacy or inadequacy of the scientific method and

> reason as the sole determinants of what constitutes genuine
> knowledge. [epistemology]

3\.   the new atheist belief that religion is inherently pathological

and no longer as a part in humankind’s future evolution.

Change on any of these issues would undermine their core identities.

On the accidental or non-foundational level, there are several bases
for dialogue and building together.

1\.   the evolutionary outlook on religion: the Bahá’í doctrine of

> progressive revelation can help the new atheists sharpen their
> analysis to avoid the problem of presentism.
2\. the need to eliminate religious prejudice and a frank recognition

of the crimes committed in the name of religion.
3\.   respect for science and reason and a continued dialogue about

their nature.

4\.   the independent investigation of truth.
5\. ethical realism, ontological realism and correspondence epis-

> temology. In this the new atheism and the Bahá’í Writings are
> joined in opposition to various forms of contemporary philosophy
> which reject realism in these areas.
