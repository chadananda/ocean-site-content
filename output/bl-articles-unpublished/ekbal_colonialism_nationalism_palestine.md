## Colonialism, Nationalism and Jewish Immigration to Palestine: Abdu'l-Baha's Viewpoints Regarding the Middle East

### by [Kamran Ekbal](https://bahai-library.com/author/Kamran+Ekbal)

2014


> **About:** The purpose of this paper is to show that Abdu’l-Bahá was vehemently opposed to the cultural, political and socio-economic penetration of the Middle East by colonialism and imperialism, that He condemned their military expeditions and their invasions of the Eastern countries and designated this as “illegal”, and he recognized the people's right to resist Western inroads. He resented all forms of oppression and aggression on the part of the Colonial Powers and never kept silent about this, but pointed to such acts and put them to discussion nearly on daily basis in His talks or in the daily gatherings at His home. He was offended by the militant and violent methods with which Jewish immigrants were harassing and threatening the Palestinian Arabs in their own country and insisted that the humiliation of Jews would not end until they accept Christ, Muhammad and Bahá’u’lláh and regard all men as God’s own flock. In spite of the principle of abstaining from political activities and the obligation of obedience to political authorities, Abdu'l-Bahá saw exceptions to this rule in cases of tyranny, oppression and injustice.

Colonialism, Nationalism and Jewish Immigration to Palestine:

Abdu´l-Bahá’s Viewpoints Regarding the Middle East1

Kamran Ekbal

> The Bahá’í Religion emerged during a period marking the heyday of colonialism. The Great
> Powers were dividing the world among themselves and more than 80% of the globe was
> already under colonial rule. The impact of colonialism during this period was so significant
> that the nineteenth century has come to be known as The Age of Colonialism or The Age of
> Imperialism. This same period witnessed also the birth of Zionism which eventually led to the
> establishment of the state of Israel and the deportation of the Palestinian people from the land
> of their ancestors, and the emergence of the Middle East Crisis.

> But what do Bahá’í sources say about these two significant historical developments? Can it be
> that such fundamental political currents and developments in the nineteenth century have
> passed unnoticed, or that the sources have kept silent about them? Can it be that due to the
> Bahá’í principle of “non-interference in political matters” such matters may have passed
> without notice, or that they were avoided and no mention was ever made of them? And how
> can the dispersion and misery of the Palestinian people be in accordance with the “divine
> promises” concerning “the Restoration of the Jews in the End Times”, as some may possibly
> be inclined to think? Taking the continuous false accusations against the Bahá’í Faith of
> “subservience to imperialism” and “collaboration with Israel” into consideration, reference
> must be made to the clear and evident viewpoints included in Bahá’í sources regarding all of
> these matters.

> In spite of the overwhelming abundance of such references in Bahá’í sources, research work
> has generally neglected these questions. Based on Tablets, Letters and Talks of Abdu´l-Bahá,
> this paper highlights Abdu’l-Bahá’s view points regarding colonialism and the right to resist
> its incursions, nationhood and nationalism, as well as Jewish immigration to Palestine.
> Another main source is the travel-book of Dr. Zia Baghdadi in 1920 to the Holy Land, which
> also contains miscellaneous passages regarding the matters mentioned above. The purpose of
> this paper is to shed light on an important part of Bahá’í history which has been barely taken
> notice of and to pave the way for more substantial research in this field.

> The First World War led to major changes in the political landscape of the Middle East. The
> fall of the Ottoman Empire and its destruction by the allies, the October Revolution in Russia
> and the Soviet expedition to Gilan, the British occupation of Palestine and the increasing
> Jewish immigration into the Holy Land, an upsurge of Arab nationalism and the struggle for
> the establishment of an Arab Kingdom under Feisal are the main cornerstones of the new era
> in the history of the Middle East. The end of Ottoman rule in Palestine brought also a period
> of increasing persecutions and danger for Abdu’l-Bahá and the Bahá’ís in the Holy Land to an

***

1. The Penetration of the Middle East by the Great Powers in the Nineteenth Century

> Napoleon´s invasion of Egypt in 1798 was the first major incursion of a European power into
> a central country of the Islamic world since the Crusades. Bonaparte’s plan to intercept British
> communication routes to the East and to strike a decisive blow to the British possessions in
> India, as well as to turn Egypt into a French colony, became the starting point for the British
> political and economic penetration of Persia. Although a brief episode which ended in 1801
> after the destruction of the French fleet by Nelson, it inaugurated an era of intensive and
> prolonged rivalry between Britain and France, soon to be joined by Russia, which was only
> interrupted, but not really terminated, by the Entente cordiale in 1904. It marked as well a
> period of cultural penetration and westernization in the Middle East and the emergence of new
> and modern ideologies of nationalism and political Islam or Panislamism, unknown hitherto
> in the region. And last but not least, Napoleon’s expedition inaugurated the era of colonialism
> and imperialism in the Middle East and North Africa. Algeria was invaded in 1830 by French
> troops and was soon declared French territory and an integral part of France. Tunisia followed
> in 1881 and with Morocco in 1901 almost the entire Maghreb was under French colonial rule.
> France laid thus the foundations for its extensive domination south of the Mediterranean and
> built up its influence with the Maronite Christians in Lebanon. The Colonial Powers which
> ruled 35% of the world in 1814, brought 85% of the globe under their control by 1914.2

> To the British, on the other hand, the lands of the Eastern Mediterranean and Persia served
> mainly their strategic, commercial and imperial interests in securing the routes to India. The
> occupation of Aden in 1839 was thus an exception to this general rule, necessitated by its
> strategic importance in controlling the Red Sea route to the East.

> After the expulsion of Napoleon’s troops from Egypt by a combined British-Ottoman
> operation in 1801, Egypt underwent under Muhammad Ali Pasha (1805-48) a period of
> comprehensive reforms. The elimination of the Mamluk feudal lords, the confiscation of their
> lands and the establishment of a state-controlled monopoly of the chief products, mainly
> cotton, enabled the enlightened ruler to initiate an extensive program of socio-economic
> change. Industries flourished, military and medical academies were established, students were
> sent abroad to study in Paris, a modern army was built up with the help of French Saint-
> Simonians and the Egyptian navy soon surpassed the Ottoman navy which controlled the
> Eastern Mediterranean. His troops were now essentially involved in putting down the
> Wahhabis of Arabia and the Greek uprisings against the Ottomans and soon recaptured
> Athens. The progress of Egypt during this period put it on the same level with countries such
> as Ireland and Japan.3

> The idea of nationalism and Arab nationhood which started to manifest itself during the
> Nahda (renaissance of Arab language and literature in the second part of the century) had its
> beginnings in the reforms of Muhammad Ali. When Egyptian troops occupied Syria and
> Palestine in 1831, a prerequisite to the unification and independence of the region, and his
> army pushed forward to the gates of Constantinople, a joint military intervention of the
> Powers succored the Ottomans, preventing the downfall of their empire and bringing the
> process of rapid modernization in Egypt to an abrupt end. Egypt which was traditionally
> considered to be the granary of the Middle East and used to export grain to France prior to
> Napoleon’s expedition, turned into a nation dependent on the importation of wheat. After the
> opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 - one year after the deportation of Bahá’u’lláh from
> Adrianople to Akka – British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli secured for Britain in 1875
> total control when he acquired the Khedive´s holding of the Canal shares and with this coup
> threw France out of the game. The rising debts of the new rulers of Egypt led eventually to the
> establishment of dual control by Britain and France in 1879 and to rising anti-European
> feelings among the population, led by the Egyptian colonel Ahmad Urabi. The British
> bombardment of Alexandria and the defeat of Urabi´s troops in 1882 paved the way for the
> British occupation of the country in the same year. Pan-Arabism and Pan-Islam, the leading
> ideologies of that period, gave rise to the principle of self-determination and the struggle for
> independence from foreign rule. A new nationalist uprising in 1919 by Sa´d Zaghlul, a
> follower of Urabi and a student of the Pan-Islamist Sayyid Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, was
> crushed by the British and the fiery lawyer who had wished to carry the wishes of his people
> for independence together with a delegation of Egyptian notables (wafd) to the Peace
> Conference in Paris was exiled to Malta. But the subjugation and the colonial strangulation of
> the East never succeeded without resistance: From the uprisings of Abd al-Qadir al Jazá’irí
> (1833-47) and the Berbers of the Atlas Mountains in Morocco against the French and
> Spaniards, to the movement of the Mahdi of Sudan and up to the struggle of Urabi and
> Zaghlul in Egypt, anti-colonial sentiments never ceased.4 In those days, unlike today, Arab
> independence movements were viewed with great sympathy by the people in Europe and the
> USA. The declaration of jihad against French colonial rule by the Algerian leader Abd al-
> Qádir al-Jazá’irí, designated by the Americans as “George Washington of the Arabs”, made
> them establish a new city which carries his name ever since.5 This happened in the same
> country witnessing today an upsurge of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim feelings, where people at
> that time remembered with great appreciation that Morocco was the very first country to
> recognize the independence of the USA from British colonial rule.

2. Western Penetration of Iran

> In Iran it was British-Russian rivalry that transformed the Qajar monarchy de facto into a
> semi-colony. The policy of granting concessions to British and Russian subjects represented
> nothing less than an almost full-scale sell out of the country and its resources to Western
> subjects and to foreign enterprises. From the telegraph-convention in 1862 to the far-reaching
> Baron de Reuter concession in 1872 regarding railways and roads, irrigation works and the

> Russian government. The new de-Reuter concession in 1889 for the establishment of the
> Imperial Bank of Persia and the following grant of the tobacco monopoly in 1889 to a British
> subject gave rise to a broad popular movement lead by the ulema. Frightened by the extent of
> the agitation, Nasir al-Din Shah (1848-1896) was forced to cancel the concession in the
> following year. An onerous agreement had to be signed now with de Reuter’s Imperial Bank
> in 1892, secured only with the receipts of the customs of the Persian Gulf.

> The cultural contacts with the West during this period marked nevertheless a break with the
> past. Like the nahda in the Arab East, also in Iran an epoch of enlightenment ensued.
> Demands for the rule of justice, a code of laws and the overthrow of tyranny were on the rise.
> Beside the secret societies, the anjomans, secularist intellectuals and sections of the religious
> classes, Babis and Bahais and the ideas disseminated by them played a decisive role in the
> awakening of Iranians to the needs of the day, i.e. liberal reforms and the struggle for a
> constitution. Abdu’l-Bahá was Himself authoritative in His call for the awakening of Persia:

> “O people of Persia! How long will your torpor and lethargy last? You were once the
> lords of the whole earth; the world was at your beck and call. How is it that your
> glory has lapsed and you have fallen from favor now, and crept away into some
> corner of oblivion? You were the fountainhead of learning, the unfailing spring of
> light for all the earth, how is it that you are withered now, and quenched, and faint of
> heart? You who once lit the world, how is it that you lurk, inert, bemused, in
> darkness now? Open your mind’s eye, see your great and present need. Rise up and
> struggle, seek education, seek enlightenment. Is it meet that a foreign people should
> receive from your own forbears its culture and its knowledge, and that you, their
> blood, their rightful heirs, should go without?”6

> He encouraged the peoples of the East to approach the West and learn the modern sciences
> from them. To Him the main reason for the progress of the Europeans was their willingness to
> accept the truth, even if it was not in conformity with their beliefs. Freedom of speech is what
> Abdu’l-Bahá highlights here. In one of His talks in the US He declares:

> “[Here] conscientious opinion has free sway. Every religion and every religious
> aspiration may be freely voiced and expressed here. Just as in the world of politics
> there is need for free thought, likewise in the world of religion there should be the
> right of unrestricted individual belief. Consider what a vast difference exists between
> modern democracy and the old forms of despotism. Under an autocratic government
> the opinions of men are not free, and development is stifled, whereas in democracy,
> because thought and speech are not restricted, the greatest progress is witnessed. It
> is likewise true in the world of religion. When freedom of conscience, liberty of
> thought and right of speech prevail—that is to say, when every man according to his
> own idealization may give expression to his beliefs—development and growth are
> inevitable.”7

> He points to the fact that Europeans were even prepared to publish His speeches in their
> newspapers, even though they did not agree with His views:

> ”There is one thing which has been the cause of the progress of the Europeans, and
> that is their readiness to accept truth after investigation and declaration of the facts,
> even if this was in opposition to their own opinion. They never remonstrate, but
> accept the facts. When I visited the University of Oxford which is very famous and
> the first of its kind in the world, I gave a speech to the professors there. They [even]
> published my speech in the university journal and in the Christian Commonwealth.”
> (own translation)8

> Unfortunately this freedom of thought and speech sometimes does not even prevail in the
> Bahá’í community. With growing restriction of the views expressed by an author, which
> many consider to be censorship, development and growth will remain, according to Abdu’l-
> Bahá Himself, obstructed. Restricting freedom of speech may also lead, intentionally or
> unintentionally, to a manipulation of the history of the Faith. Concerning taqiyya,
> dissimulation, e.g. Bahá’í publications keep reporting incorrectly and most probably due to
> the ignorance of the authors, that “Bahá’ís do not dissimulate” and that it is the others who
> “practice lying and dissimulation”.9 They mention with great contempt that “the culture of
> religious imitation (taqlíd), false piety (ta´abbud) and dissimulation (taqiyya)” results in
> “metamorphosing and deformation of the personality” of the people.10 Authors who on the
> other hand want to show that taqiyya had been established by Bahá’u´lláh in His Tablets and
> maintained also by Abdu’l-Bahá in His Writings, and that it was first prohibited by Shoghi
> Efendi, are hindered to do so. An important period of Bahá’í history, when taqiyya, on the
> basis of Bahá’u’lláh’s and Abdu’l-Bahá’s own statements,11 was legally practiced and wide
> spread among Bahá’ís, is thus consigned to oblivion and gets forged.12 Putting taqiyya on the
> same level as lying and false piety or deformation of personality, which evolves from the
> ignorance of the authors, leads eventually to the assumption that Bahá’u’lláh, wishing to
> “deform and metamorphose the personality” of His adherents, had called upon them to abide
> by “lying and false piety”! Ignorance about basics and details of the Bahá’í principles can
> even lead to disastrous results, for example when Payám-i Bahá’í, the main Persian Bahá’í
> organ, writes in its editorial that “Islam could have reached Iran and other countries without
> need to all those invasions, troops and bloodshed…but unfortunately war and strife was given
> preference for its spreading abroad.”13 Such opinions nowadays might be considered
> “modern”; they may also be an imitation of anti-Islamic criticisms brought up against Islam
> from its very beginnings in the West, but they have nothing to do with basic Bahá’í beliefs.
> Ignorance of the immense glorification of the early wars of Islamic expansion in Bahá’í
> Scriptural Writings, to which reference will be made later, not only distorts and humiliates a
> significant part of the history of Islam, but also leads to false assumptions concerning a
> presumed hostility of Bahá’ís towards Islam and delivers unfounded arguments into the hands
> of the opponents of the Faith.

> Tablets, summoning them to disarmament and international agreement, Abdu’l-Bahá had
> striven throughout His entire life to proclaim the oneness of mankind and promulgate the
> message for Universal Peace.

> For Abdu’l-Bahá liberty is an essential precondition to Universal Peace. “Liberalism is
> essential in this day – justice and equity toward all nations and people.”16 As will be seen,
> denying the rights of the peoples of North Africa and Palestine was criticized and condemned
> openly by Him.

> In a talk held at a gathering of Black Americans in Washington D.C. He reiterated that “in this
> human world there is no greater blessing than liberty. You do not know. I, who for forty years
> have been a prisoner, do know. I do know the value and blessing of liberty. For you have been
> and are now living in freedom, and you have no fear of anybody. Is there a greater blessing
> than this? Freedom! Liberty! Security! These are the great bestowals of God. Therefore,
> praise ye God! I will now pray in your behalf“.17

> Like His Father Abdu’l-Bahá was also a keen observer of political developments in the world.

> probably to Gabriel (Jubran) Sacy, a Bahá’í Frenchman of Syrian origin who in 1901 had
> carried messages from Abdu’l-Bahá to the Russian philosopher Tolstoy, He calls upon him:

> “Speak thou then to that honorable gentleman [i.e. Tolstoy] and tell him: For several
> centuries the West has been now attacking the East like bandits (satá) with its
> armies and cavalries and has not stopped yet. And it is going to continue this assault
> with all troops at its disposal until Doomsday. You observe the large armies
> impetuously assaulting like lions from the woods of the Western world onto the
> battlefields of the East. Among these are an army of finance (tharwa), an army of
> industries (saná`a), an army of commerce (tijára), an army of politics (siyása), an
> army of knowledge (ma´árif) and an army of discoveries (iktisháfát), numerous
> soldiers loaded with war materiel, assaulting from the West with their sharp and
> deadly weapons and conquering the East in all its parts. Among these recent
> conquests you will find vast regions of China whereas the East has remained ever
> incapable of putting up resistance against these assaulting armies and innumerable
> vanquishing soldiers. Wise men know the consequences of such a great matter and
> need no proof hereto. So ponder thee, thou illustrious sire, upon the bad
> consequences of the matter. Can ye imagine safeguarding the East against the
> assaults from the West in future times through such instruments as prudence, wise
> administration and Politics, even if they were carried in utmost perfection? No,
> never, by my gracious God! On the contrary! Matters are in great danger. And
> therefore the people of the East must ponder on how they may find effective means to
> safeguard their grandeur, their honor, their independence and their good reputation
> from the disorderly hands from the West. Without doubt all devices are non-existent
> and all means lost except for divine power, heavenly force, God-given authority and
> divine valor. It is only this power which is capable of resisting all assaults and
> dispersing all troops, breaking the fronts of all contumacious adversaries and
> defeating all armies in the same manner as in the early centuries [of Islam].”

> Abdu’l-Bahá alludes then to Jesus Christ whose words had conquered the West and subdued
> its people to the Word of God coming to them from the East, although He was all alone and
> without any help or succor.18 (own translation)

> It is evident that Abdu’l-Bahá is not referring in this letter to colonial invasions merely in the
> military sense of the word, like e.g. the French occupation of North Africa or the British
> occupation of Egypt, but, even if He makes no use of the term, to imperialism in the full sense
> of its meaning, which includes political, cultural (army of knowledge and discoveries),
> commercial, industrial, and mainly financial penetration or capital transfer (army of finance).
> The description given here is a fine recapitulation of the strangulation of Persia in the
> nineteenth century by the Great Powers, and of the political and economic penetration of the
> Ottoman Empire and of Egypt prior to 1882. It is also a precise picture of the political
> situation of the world today. That Abdu’l-Bahá’s perception is that of a continuous financial
> warfare launched by imperialism against poor countries is also evident in other sections of His
> talks: “At this time the states are continuously engaged in increasing their war preparations.
> Although superficially looked upon there seems to be no war, but in reality it is a continuous

> war and death are multiplied and increased to an inconceivable degree, and the
> burden of military maintenance is taxing the various countries beyond the point of
> endurance. Armies and navies devour the substance and possessions of the people;

> For Abdu’l-Bahá, what was happening in the Balkans during His travels in America, with all

> “Consider what is happening in the Balkans. Human blood is being shed, properties

> enkindling fire is astir in the Balkans. God has created men to love each other; but
> instead, they kill each other with cruelty and bloodshed. God has created them that

> destroy in the carnage of battle. God has created them to be the cause of mutual
> felicity and peace; but instead, discord, lamentation and anguish rise from the hearts
> of the innocent and afflicted.”60 On another instance He laments: “How savage and
> fearful the ferocity of man against his fellowman! Consider what is taking place now
> in the Balkans, what blood is being shed. Even the wild beasts and ferocious animals
> do not commit such acts. The most ferocious wolf kills but one sheep a day, and even

> earth. They kill for national aggrandizement, notwithstanding this terrestrial globe is
> but a dark world of grossest matter. It is a world of sorrow and grief, a world of
> disappointment and unhappiness, a world of death.”61

> But besides His deep grief regarding the calamities of the war Abdu’l-Bahá laments the loss
> of sovereignty in the East. In a speech delivered on 7 November 1912 in Washington, D.C.,
> not included in the Persian compilation, He exclaims: “Consider events in the Balkans today
> where a great conflagration of war is furiously raging and so much blood is being shed.
> Virtually the whole world of humanity is mourning and lamenting because of the revival of
> these calamitous conditions. Governments are in the process of change and transformation.
> The sovereignty of oriental nations is tottering; outcomes are wrapped in the greatest
> uncertainty.”62 With His far reaching insight, Abdu’l-Bahá was predicting here the major

> The Italian invasion of Libya and the barbarian methods employed for the subjugation of its
> Arab people was a matter of great sorrow to Abdu’l-Bahá. In one of his Paris talks on 21

October 1911, not included in the Persian compilations, He said:

> “I hope you are all happy and well. I am not happy, but very sad. The news of the

7. The Great Powers and the Question of Arab Unity

> Since the reign of Muhammad Ali Pasha in the first half of the nineteenth century and the
> invasion of Syria (1831-1840) by his son Ibrahim Pasha, the idea of the unity of the Arabic
> speaking countries under Ottoman rule, especially amongst the peoples of Egypt, Syria,
> Palestine and Lebanon, had started taking shape. The concentrated military intervention by the
> Powers in 1840 brought the period of radical reforms in Egypt to an abrupt end. Nevertheless,
> the vision of Arab unity flourished in the second half of the century, mainly in Egypt which
> was out of the direct hold of the Ottomans, and initiated to a great deal by Syrian Christian
> Arabs who found best preconditions in the liberal atmosphere existing in Egypt in those days.
> The spread of newspapers, modern academies and education promoted the process of cultural
> Arab renaissance, Nahda, in the second part of the century. The Arab aspirations, mainly for
> cultural autonomy during this period, soon gained more of a political character. Secret
> societies, similar to the Anjumans in Iran calling for constitutionalism, emerged in growing
> numbers and now demanded decentralization, i.e. political autonomy in the general
> framework of the Ottoman Empire. The first calls for independence came from the Christian
> and Muslim members of the Arab National Conference, organized by the secret Committees
> and held in Paris in 1913 mainly by Syrian Arab students and intellectuals. The Ottomans,
> trying to stop the disintegration of their empire, resorted to more and more repressive
> measures and violence, which fomented still greater nationalist protests and anti-Ottoman
> feelings among the Arabs. Nationalist tensions rose high especially after the revolution of the
> Young Turks in 1909, in which Sultan Abd al-Hamid was deposed, and after their coup in
> January 1913 which finally established a one-party dictatorship under the triumvirate of

> Enver, Tal´at and Jamal Pashas. Jamal, nicknamed “the Butcher”, al-Jazzár, was not only an
> enemy of Abdu’l-Bahá, but also a fierce suppressor of the nationalists, whose leaders were
> hanged by the dozen in the main squares of Beirut and Damascus on 6 May 1916. The Arabs
> had a very liberal view of Arab nationalism, in which ethnicity and religious affiliation has no
> relevance. According to Ahmad Tabbara, one of the nationalist leaders later hanged by Jamal
> Pasha, “everyone who speaks Arabic, regardless of whether he is a Muslim or a non-Muslim”
> is regarded as an Arab.74

> The first years of the World War were catastrophic for the allies. The Australian and New
> Zealand forces which landed on the beaches of the Gallipoli peninsula on the Dardanelles on
> 25 April 1915 were taken by surprise, and instead of a quick march to Constantinople, were,
> in spite of their overwhelming numerical superiority, driven back by the Turks from higher
> grounds onto a narrow strip of the beach. Gallipoli was to become a drawn-out replay of the
> trench war in the West. The Turkish army, consisting of large Arab divisions, was still
> capable of putting up strong resistance.75 Another British force which had started to march
> from the Shatt al-Arab towards Baghdad in the same month lost half of its members and was
> besieged at Kut al-Amara on the Tigris. After 146 days and although fresh reinforcements had
> been sent to their rescue, the British suffered twenty-three thousand casualties, surrendered
> unconditionally and were carried into captivity. They perished along the way.76 Engaged in a
> war on three fronts, the Ottomans defeated Britain and France in the west, crushed the British
> armies in the east and held off the Russians in the north.

> movement under the auspices of Sharif Hussein of Mecca. In a series of letters exchanged in
> 1915-1916 between the British High Commissioner in Egypt, Henry McMahon, and Sharif

8. The Return of the Jews to Palestine

> first to suggest the settlement of European Jews in the Suez region to safeguard a canal project
> he envisaged.79 Lord Palmerstone, British Foreign Secretary from 1830-1841, seeking to halt
> French advances in the East planned the establishment of a British-backed Jewish client-state
> in Palestine to stop their advance and block Muhammad Ali´s progress.80 Plans of this kind set
> up by the Powers for safeguarding their own interests were quite numerous. When the
> Germans were constructing the Baghdad Railway in the last part of the century, plans were
> made to settle Jews in Asia Minor alongside the rails81 or bestow an Ottoman Pashaliq upon

> founded Jewish labor union, Histadrut, were attacking Jewish ladies who wished to do their
> shopping in Palestinian shops in much a similar manner, destroying the tomatoes and eggs

The aforementioned statement of Abdu’l-Bahá implies yet other points of great significance:

The widespread Arab fears for the future and their rising frustrations in regard to the Jewish
immigration are also documented by Dr. Zia Baghdadi. Under the subtitle “Whom does the
Holy Land belong to? The Future of the Jews” he writes:

> “The Master observed: `I paid the British Assistant-Governor a visit, because he was
> ill. There I found a group of [Palestinian] Christians. They were talking to him about
> the Jewish Question (al-mas´ala al-yahúdiyya), and that `they [the Jews] wanted to

> countries and it is their intention to take our country out of our hands. Is that all
> right? It is obvious that this will lead to bloodshed and to great dangers. The
> assistant-governor then said: `Be assured and ascertained that there is no danger
> whatsoever. Not at all! The Jews will not ever be able to take over the Holy Land
> because the Bahá’ís in America and Iran will prevent them from that! Do you not see
> the [great] numbers of pilgrims from America and Iran and from the whole world?
> Bahá’ís hold this Land sacred more than the Jews and more than all other nations
> because it is the Center of Bahá and of the great Báb, and the mausoleum of
> Bahá’u’lláh is in Akká and that of the Báb is on the Carmel. So how could they ever
> leave it to the Jews? For sure, they will come and buy all these lands. Therefore
there is no reason [for you] to fear the Zionists`.”

> Abdu’l-Bahá then exclaims that it was the folly of the Turkish and Persian governments that
> they sent Bahá’u’lláh from Persia to Baghdad and Adrianople and thence to Akká in order to
> destroy the foundations of His Cause, not knowing that they did Him thus a great favor:
> “They gave Him the Holy Land and put Him therein, but they know not what they do. Jews
> will accept this Cause for sure. They will have no other choice.” Then Abdu’l-Bahá narrates
> His well celebrated vision of the future of the Carmel illuminated in radiant lights with
> thousands of ships bringing kings and rulers of the world, carrying roses and flowers on top of
> their heads to the Shrines of Bahá’u’lláh and the Bab, awestruck, with full reverence and in
> total submission with tears flowing down their eyes. To all of this Abdu’l-Bahá envisages
> furthermore “hospitals for the sick, houses for aged persons as well as Houses of Worship

> given by the latter, no matter how ridiculous these were, maintaining even that Bahá’ís from
> America and Iran will prevent Jews from taking over the land!

> After His investiture in Haifa, Jewish leaders came to congratulate Abdu’l-Bahá. He said to
> them:

> “Be assured, I have told the Muslims and the Christians [here] that an Arab proverb
> says: `Think of how to get out, before you get into someplace.´ Which means that if a

> A few days later, on 30 April 1920, He reminded those in His presence that Bahá’u’lláh had

Jews would have not been able to find a better attorney of defense for their case. He defends

> (600-576 BCE) from their Babylonian Captivity. This temple which was restored by Herod

11. The Return of the Jews is Bound to Preconditions

> As we have seen, Abdu’l-Bahá was disturbed and distressed to see that Jews coming to the
> Holy Land were making war preparations for an eventual takeover of the land, and He was
> dismayed to see that justice, the precondition to peace, as He had repeatedly maintained, was
> being trampled upon and that the Arab population was in agony and fearful for its future.

> In principle Abdu’l-Bahá abides by the Divine Promise regarding the Return of the Jews at
> the End of Times and confirms this on all occasions and to whomever He talks to, regardless
> of whether they are Arab nationalists like Jamil Effendi al–Jarráḥ, or British politicians, or
> people of different background. But He also makes it very clear that the Return of the Jews
> does not mean that this will inevitably happen, but that this is bound to preconditions which
> must first be realized. In a Tablet to another Persian Bahá’í Jew, Mirza Habíbu’l-láh, dated
> also 10 Rabí` I 1338/3 December 1919 He observes:

> “O ye descendant of His Holiness Abraham. Thank God all prophecies of the Holy
> Scriptures in regard to [the Children of] Israel, to which also the letters of Abdu’l-
> Bahá refer, are all coming true. Some have already been fulfilled and others will be
> fulfilled [in the future]…But this depends on preconditions (mashrúṭ): that they [i.e.
> the Jews] must behave in accordance to the divine laws; that they must seek
> redemption from the darkness of ancient customs and emancipation from the
> maladies of their earlier habits; that they must hold onto what is the spirit of this era
> and the light of this century; that they change their behavior and make it moderate
> (ta`díl) and that they engage themselves to the utmost in what is to the benefit of all
> of mankind and its relations…and that they regard all men as God’s own flock, and
> God as the magnanimous shepherd. Today is the day when ones own way of thinking,
> whether in regard to individuals or to nations, will inevitably lead to the most great
> calamity (nakbat-i kubrá), and eventually to an all-round loss…It is up to Israel now
> to get rid of its sick ideas and start dealing with matters of universal benefit. Israel´s
> ideas must now be concentrated on matters which are to everybody’s benefit and for
> the happiness of all mankind. Success is today a companion to that party which, like
> the sun, sheds its lights of mercy onto all horizons, and which tears asunder
> (munsalikh) all personal and nationalist bonds (taqayyudát-i shakhṣí wa millí)
> resulting from satanic and evil inspirations (wasáwis-i shayṭániyyah).” (own
> translation)124

From the contents of this letter it becomes evident:

1. The Return of the Jews is not a free ticket from God, no matter what and no matter how,

> but dependent on preconditions such as a change of behavior in accordance to divine
> laws, emancipation from the maladies of old customs and sick ideas of the Jews, as well
> as their ability of regarding all men, including the Palestinians, as God’s own flock.
2. A clear warning by Abdu’l-Bahá that otherwise Jewish immigration will inevitably lead to

> the most great calamity. It is most interesting that Abdu’l-Bahá uses for this the term
> Nakbah, which ever since 1948 has come to designate the Catastrophe of the deportation

\[123\] Makatib III:361f (own translation)

\[124\] Makatib III:363f. (own translation)

> of the Palestinian people from its land and the loss of its country - a problem of global
> dimensions which is bringing the world to the brink of an atomic disaster. A problem in
> great need of a just solution, respecting the interests of both sides.
3. With strongest wording Abdu’l-Bahá exhorts the Zionists, i.e. Jews with nationalist

> affiliations, to tear asunder these bonds. Nationalism, of whatever kind, is of satanic
> origins. The trauma which is part of Jewish identity and due to the historical persecutions
> in the West, and more especially nowadays due to the Holocaust, as well as the trauma
> which has now also become part of the Palestinian identity due to the Nakbah in 1948 and
> due to the continuous denial of their legal right to return to their homeland and the
> continuous wars against them, all these traumas are satanic.

> But there are still other preconditions than the three mentioned in the letter above. One such
> precondition for the rehabilitation of the Jews as stated by Abdu’l-Bahá is their acceptance of
> the divine origin of the missions of Jesus Christ and Prophet Muhammad. Unless this is
> done, He told a Jewish rabbi in the U.S., their “humiliation will endure forever”. In a talk
> given at a synagogue in Washington D.C. on 8 November 1912 He proclaimed to the Jewish
> audience gathered there the significance of Christ’s and Muhammad’s missions and reminded
> them, that it was because of their rejection of Christ that they had faced calamities after
> calamities throughout history, and invited them to declare their acceptance of Christ,
> Muhammad and Bahá’u’lláh.125 In a talk on the following day at the home of Mr. and Mrs.
> Parsons, Abdu’l-Bahá relates that His address delivered the previous evening at the
> synagogue had evidently disturbed the rabbi and some members of his community, so much
> so that they had called upon Him that afternoon. What Abdu’l-Bahá had to say now was of
> such importance to Him, that He asked the friends gathered at the Parsons’ Home to
> memorize His words: “It was not possible to make the subject completely plain to the rabbi
> last night, as he was very much pressed for time, but today the opportunity was sufficient for a
> reconsideration of the statements in detail. I wish you to understand them thoroughly and
> memorize them in order that you may discourse with the Jews and thus, perchance, become
> instrumental in leading them aright.”126 He then relates His elaborations to the rabbi and his
> Jewish companions when He had accompanied them for a walk, how He reviewed to them the
> virtues of Christ, that it was He who had made the Torah part of the Bible and caused the
> name and prestige of Moses to be widespread and known through the continents of the world,
> but that the Jews had nevertheless pronounced Him an enemy of Moses. Abdu’l-Bahá then
> concludes with His words to the rabbi:

> “Consider the troubles and persecutions heaped upon you in Russia for your
> fanaticism of unbelief. And you must not think that this is ended. This humiliation
> will continue forever. The time may come when in Europe itself they will arise
> against the Jews. But your declaration that Christ was the Word of God will end all
> such trouble. My advice is that in order to become honorable, protected and secure
> among the nations of the world, in order that the Christians may love and safeguard
> the Israelitish people, you should be willing to announce your belief in Christ, the
> Word of God. This is a complete statement; there is nothing more. Is it not
> thoughtless, ignorant prejudice which restrains you from doing so? Declare that,
> verily, the Word of God was realized in Him, and all will be right.”127

> In a similar way He spoke again openly to a Jewish audience at the Temple of Emmanuel in
> San Francisco on 12 October 1912: “Why do you not say that Christ was the Word of God?

> Why do you not speak these few words that will do away with all this difficulty? Then there
> will be no more hatred and fanaticism, no more warfare and bloodshed in the Land of
> Promise. Then there will be peace among you forever.128 What Abdu’l-Bahá says is clear cut
> and beyond any doubt. Jews will either have to recognize Christ and Muhammad and their
> divine mission and gain thus the admiration and respect of all nations, or else be content with
> the fact that “this humiliation will last forever”.

> But beyond these unique theological elaborations and of still greater significance for Abdu’l-
> Bahá is justice, which He had declared a precondition to peace. Again and again He reiterates
> the uppermost principle of “justness and equity toward all nations and people,”129 and asks:
> “Is there a greater blessing than this? Freedom! Liberty! Security! These are the great
> bestowals of God.”130 A people which was never involved in the persecution of Jews suffers
> today the lack of all vital necessities of life: Bread, water and medicine in the great prison
> which Gaza has become, as well as freedom, liberty and security all over Palestine. To Abdu’l
> Bahá all of the preconditions referred to must be fulfilled, ere a rehabilitation of the Jews
> takes place and peace prevails.

> And what is the solution that Abdu’l-Bahá suggests to this all? In the Tablet to Mirza
> Habíbu’lláh discussed above He exhorts him: “Bring my deepest loving regards to all Jewish
> and Muslim friends in Hamadan, and tell them that Jew and Muslim are worthless terms. My
> hope is that you should forget all about them, so that the gracious word Bahá’í becomes
> everyone’s designation and so that all differences and contradictions may completely cease
> and all these metaphoric religious communities (tawá’if-i majáz) may melt like iron in the
> oven of the love of God and be reshaped into one...”(own translation)131

> According to Abdu’l-Bahá, one of the most fatal dilemmas among Jews is that of considering
> themselves to be “God’s Own Chosen People” and all others inferior to them. This is
> discussed by Abdu’l-Bahá in one of His Paris Talks on 28 October 1911:

> “I was once at Tiberias where the Jews have a Temple. I was staying in a house just
> opposite the Temple, and there I saw and heard a rabbi speaking to his congregation
> of Jews, and he spoke thus:
> ‘O Jews, you are in truth the people of God! All other races and religions are of the
> devil. God has created you the descendants of Abraham, and He has showered His
> blessings upon you. Unto you God sent Moses, Jacob and Joseph, and many other
> great prophets. These prophets, one and all, were of your race.
> ‘It was for you that God broke the power of the Pharaoh and caused the Red Sea to
> dry up; to you also He sent manna from above to be your food, and out of the stony
> rock He gave you water to quench your thirst. You are indeed the chosen people of
> God, you are above all the races of the earth! Therefore, all other races are
> abhorrent to God, and condemned by Him. In truth you will govern and subdue
> the world, and all men shall become your slaves.
> ‘Do not profane yourselves by consorting with people who are not of your own
> religion, make not friends of such men.’

> cultural, political and socio-economic penetration of the Middle East by colonialism and
