  A Thematic Analysis and Summary of The Persian Bayán

Peter Terry

1977 (revised 2015)

This study of the Persian Bayán was begun in September of 1977, when I was a graduate student at the
University of Chicago, having read the entirety of four volumes (tomes) in French the previous summer. I
shared the completed study with some interested friends, and promptly forgot about it for almost twenty
years. A visit to the Baha’i shrines in 1993 brought me into contact with a member of the Universal House
of Justice, who surprised me with a clearly heartfelt word of gratitude for this little monograph. I resolved
that, some day, I would share it more widely. It will now find a home in the wonderful online collection of
the Baha’I Library Online.

The contents of the Persian Bayán are as impossible to comprehensively describe as are the contents of the
great oceans. Of course we may remark that the latter are full of water and that fishes of various kinds live
in this water, but what really does this tell us about the contents of the oceans—very little indeed. The
Persian Bayán is an ocean of words and meanings at least as vast as any of the water concavities which grace
our fertile planet, and this for at least two reasons. Simplest among the reasons is the shear size of this
volume, composed of some 8000 verses in Persian manuscript, and 630 pages in single-spaced small print
French translation by A.L.M. Nicolas. In comparison with other volumes of this genre, for example the
Gospel of Matthew and the Qur’án of Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullah, the former of which is 32 pages in English
translation and the latter 4600 verses in Arabic and 480 pages in English translation, the Persian Bayán
stands without peer in length. Second among the reasons for the Bayán to be considered as vast as an
ocean is that it is a Scripture, and that all Scriptures have proven to be endlessly profound and eternally
refreshing.

In introducing the Persian Bayán it must be affirmed that this Book was not revealed in the manner in
which were revealed the Scriptures of Christians and Muslims. The Báb wrote most of His1 writings with
His own pen, in His own handwriting, and the rest He dictated to an ammanuensis who wrote them down
immediately. Also, whereas the Gospels are the only records of the utterances of Jesus Christ available to us,
and while the Qur’án is the only completely reliable record of the utterances of Muhammad, the Báb
revealed and wrote or dictated thousands of verses. In the Persian Bayán 2, the Báb indicates that by that
time He had written 100,000 lines. Distinguished British Orientalist Professor Edward Granville Browne,
in a note included in his translation of A Traveler’s Narrative by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, wrote: “Indeed, if we may
credit a statement made in the Tarikh-i-Jadid on the authority of Mirza ‘Abdu’l-Vahhad, the various
writings of the Báb current in Tabriz alone amounted in all to not less than a million verses.”3 The time
which this statement was referring to was the same as the period during which the Báb revealed the Persian
Bayán. As 8000 verses are around 800 pages in length, one million verses would be the equivalent of about
100,000 pages or nearly 10 times the length of the Old and New Testaments combined.

Another difference between the Báb and other Prophets (or Manifestations of God as he referred to them)
is that the Persian Bayán was not revealed until the closing years of His ministry, and when it was revealed it
was all at once, not in segments over a period some 3 years as in the case of Jesus or 24 years in the case of
Muhammad. Another Book of the Báb, entitled Qayyumu’l-Asma, is composed of 111 chapters, over 9300
verses in length and revealed immediately following the prophetic declaration by the Báb in the Persian
city of Shíráz, was regarded by his followers as his Qur’án until the dissemination of the Persian Bayán a few
years later, shortly before the martyrdom of its Author in the year 1850.

“Bayán” translates into English as “Exposition” and this Book was certainly an exposition of the teachings
of the Báb, and from his point of view and that of his followers, the exposition of the renewed and restated
eternal Religion of God. It is called the Persian Bayán because almost all of its verses are written in the
Persian language; this distinguishes it from the shorter and less monumental Arabic Bayán revealed by the
Báb during the same period as its companion volume and also translated into French by A.L.M.Nicolas4.
In this paper the contents of this Book are identified as belonging to several distinct categories of concepts.
Initially the teachings of the Báb will be summarized in these categories without citations being made from
the text of the Bayán as evidence of the accuracy of conclusions draw. To cite a few such references wold
risk misleading and confusing the reader while citing all of them is simply beyond the purview of any
article. Subsequent to this relatively brief description of the major themes of the Persian Bayán, the
contents of each of its nine Vahíds will be described. These nine Vahíds are similar in function to chapters
in a book, while each Vahíd is composed of nineteen abwáb (plural in Arabic of báb), except for the ninth
Vahíd, which is composed of only eleven abwáb. These abwáb are similar to subheadings within a
chapter. The word “Vahíd” means “Unity” –a key concept among the teachings of the Báb—and “báb”
means “door” or “gate”.

THEMATIC ANALYSIS

Beginning with its Preface, which is sixteen pages in length including copious notes written by the editor
and translator A.L.M. Nicolas and extending throughout its 630 pages, the French version of the Persian
Bayán5 concentrates on the folloing themes: (1) The nature of God; (2) The nature of the Manifestations
and Revelations and Dispensations of God; (3) The nature and behavior of human beings –- Christians,
Muslims and Bábís (followers of te Báb); (4) The requirements of true belief; (5) New laws for the Bábí
Dispensation; (6) References to the succeeding Manifestations of God; (7) The Word of God. There are
expositions of less important topics as well— (8) the significance of the science of numbers; (9) the
insignificance of the science of grammar; (10) on the spiritual meanings of certain colors; (11) the spiritual
equivalents and rankings of material substances; (12) several abwáb are given over to an explanation f
various words used in the Qur’án, among them, “Paradise”, “Hell”, “Death”, “The Tomb”,
“Resurrection”, “The Return”, “The Balance”, “The Last Judgment”, “The Count”, “Door”, “The
Point”, and “Reunion”. In the course of explaining these Qur’ánic symbolic terms, the Báb addresses (for
the most part) the seven major themes cited earlier.

A Thematic Analysis and Summary of the Persian Bayán                             3

(1) The nature of God

There is only one God, and everything besides Him is His creature. He is infinitel exalted above His
creatures; He does not beget nor is He begotten; He cannot be known by anyone but Himself and not one
of His creatures can become Him by any means; He cannot be described with accuracy by anyone, for
none can know Him and none can describe what they do not know; the only description of Him which is
accurate is that which He gives of Himself through His Manifestations; He creates, sustains and detroys all
existences and no existence can exist without Him; there have been creatures as long as the Creator has
existed and as His existence has been eternal, there have always been creatures and creation is ancient,
imperishable and everlasting; He does not create by His own Self but through the mediation of His
creation, the Primal Will which is the Manifestation of God, a Kingdom in its own right, distinct alike
from the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of His secondary creations. The Primal Will is described
later in (2). Suffice it to say that God does not act directly on His creatures, but rather does He act through
His Primal Will which is His first creation. He governs His secondary creations through the agency of this
one Wil which is entirely and unassailably submissive to His Will as it proceeds from His Unknowable
Essence.

(2) The nature of the Manifestations and Revelations and Dispensations of God

Even as there is one God, there is one Religion of God for the guidance of humanity, one Intermediary
between God and His secondary creations and one Truth revealed by this one Intermediary in this one
Religion. This Religion is that Covenant which was established even before Adam, of which Adam is ts
first recognizable Exponent, and which was renewed with Noah, Abraham, Moses (and other Hebrew
prophets), Jesus Christ, Muhammad and –according to the testimony of the Báb and of His followers—
Haji Siyyid ‘Alí Muhammad Shírázi, the Báb. It is an eternal Covenant, eternal in the past, eternal in the
future. The Intermediary between God and humanity is the Primal Will which created man and to which
man returns at death. This Primal Will is manifested in the Manifestations of God –while a particular
Manifestation is residing in a human temple, that is during the earthly lifespan of the Manfestation in
human form—during which He is the Most Perfect of Men, and at the same time, the Perfect Mirror of
the Attributes and Intentions of God, and thereafer until the apparition of the next Manifestation, no two
of Them are made manifest at the same time, for They reveal the Unity of God, and in Spirit and Purpose
these Manifestations are United in that They are the human forms of the Primal Will which admits of no
plurality. The acceptance of one Manifestation of God accompanied by the rejection of another is
therefore worth nothing, for it denies the essential nature of the Manifestations and of the Religion of God
which is Unity and Continuity. The one Truth revealed by this Intermediary between God and humanity
is the Truth—the true nature of God, of the Manifestation of God, of the human being and of the right
relations between these parties according to the ancient, everlasting and unchanging Covenant of God
with humanity. One of the attributes of the Religion of God which is reflected in the Manifestations and
in the revelation of Truth is progression. As humanity has evolved, the Religion of God has evolved also,
but not through the instigation of men but through the act of God through His Primal Will and in the
form of His periodic appearance in the Manifestations of God.

Consequently, Muhammad was endowed with greater spiritual power and a more comprehensive
revelation of the Truth than was Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ exhibited a superior degree to that of
Moses. As humanity continues and will always continue to progress, the share of the sublime vision which
it will be able to sustain and which will be vouchsafed to him will continue to grow. The Báb categorically
asserted His spiritual superiority over Muhammad and He revealed that the Manifestation to follow Him
would be infinitely greater than Himself, notwithstanding His incomparable brilliance in His own Day.

(3) The nature and behavior of human beings

Human beings are capable of acting like animals and also of soaring into the heights of spiritualty,
through their belief in and wholehearted devotion to the Manifestation of God and all of his teachings. In
the Dispensation of Christ –which began with the “declaration” of his mission while being baptized by
John the Baptist and ended with the “declaration” of Muhammad some 600 years later (according to the
Gregorian calendar)—only those who become believers in him and followers of his teachings were blessed
with the “Paradise” of God’s presence. The others were committed to the “Fire” of unbelief. In the
Dispensation of Muhammad –which began with His “declaration” and ended according to the Báb
precisely 1270 years later when he made his “declaration in 1844—all of those Christians who did not
become Muslims became unbelievers, and pagans who became Muslims entered into the “Paradise” of
God’s presence along with former Christians. We will explore this theme in greater depth later on. For the
time being let us be satisfied with the assertion that the Báb revealed the existence of two categories of
human beings—the one who are composed of the “saved”, called “believers”; and the other of the
“damned”, called “unbelievers”. It is the aim of the Manifestation to make it possible for every human
being to have a real choice and to have the freedom to make this choice; it is not His purpose to force
human beings to recognize and follow him, something which is nevertheles within his power to effect.
Within the ranks of the faithful there are myriads of degrees, the highest being that of the first disciples. In
the Báb’s Dispensation these first disciples were called the Letters of the Living, and the Báb asserts that in
the Dispensation of Muhammad these first disciples were the Imams. The lowest are the rank and file
believers who have not achieved distinction for their knowledge, their words or their devotion to the Faith
of God. If this scale were to include unbelievers they would be immeasurably inferior in station to the rank
and file believers. The Báb also reveals the significance of “life”, “death” and “purity” as they apply to
human beings. Believers have spiritual life, they are released from spiritual death and they have died to
everything save the Will of God; believers are pure, inwardly and outwardly, and everything that belongs
to a believer or which comes into contact with him is purified unless it is essentially impure (rather than
made impure through its contact with unbelievers) in which case it should be avoided altogether. Non-
believers are deprived of spiritual life, they are dead to the spiritual world and they are impure because
they have not been purified by their faith in God. It must be remembered that there is no real faith in God
which does not affirm the inseparability of such faith and belief in the Manifestations of God, and
adherence to the most recent of these Manifestations and to whatsoever he has revealed.

(4) The requirements of true belief

The formula which is universally regarded as the essential creed of Islam –“There is no God but the [one]
God and Muhammad is His Messenger”—is altered in every Dispensation to substitute the name of the

A Thematic Analysis and Summary of the Persian Bayán                          5

new Manifestation in place of that of the previous Manifestation. In the Dispensation of the Báb, the
essential requirement of every human being in order to be accounted a believer in God is the inner
acceptance and outer adherence to this affirmation –“There is no God but the [one] God and the Primal
Point (a designation of the Báb) is His Messenger.” If the Unity of God and the Uniqueness of God are
affirmed but the Prophethood of the Báb is denied this is unacceptable before God; these two are one,
they are facets of the same jewel, and both are requirements, for if diversity of belief were tolerated then
the Unity of God and of His Will for humanity and indeed the Unity of humankind would not be made
manifest. For the followers of the Báb in the Day on which Him Whom God shall make manifest (the Báb’s
designation for the Manifestation to succeed Him and superceed His Revelation) appears, belief in God
will no longer be determined according to their faith in the Báb and their sincerity in following His
teachings. In the Dispensation of Him Whom God shall make manifest the criteria of belief in God will be
unhesitating and steadfast affirmation of the Unity and Unicity of God and the Prophethood of Him Whom
God shall make manifest.

(5) New laws for the Bábí Dispensation

New laws superceeding the laws of the Qur’án are revealed in the Persian Bayán. The rites and
ceremonials, legal conditions and spiritual qualifications of marriage, divorce, burial, war (including holy
war), propery ownership; legal sanctions punitive of acts of assault,unfaithfulness robbery, arson, murder;
regulations related to the selection of places of pilgrimage and the erection of buildings for the
commemoration of the chosen ones of God, the Manifestation of God and for the utterance of the praises
of the Creator Himself; all of these and others as well which are treated in specific fashion in the Qur’án
are revolutionized in this Book. These will be described in some detail with the Báb’s reasonings attached
in the course of the author’s chapter-by-chapter review which follows this thematic survey. Briefly then,
marriage is between consenting parties who have the approval of both sets of parents and it is only
permitted upon the payment by the groom of a dowry of a certain amount to the bride; a Bábí may not
marry someone who is Christian or Muslim and if he or she does so he or she forfeits his exalted station as
a true believer and is accounted among the unbelievers. This is likewise the case with marrying an
adherent of any other faith, or of no faith at all. A spouse may only marry again –while remaining faithful
to his or her first spouse—if that spouse is generative while his or her partner is infertile or impotent.
Divorce is discouraged but tolerated if the two parties can not restore good relations with each other and if
they are separated for a full year without intercourse or cohabitation before the legal bond is dissolved in
the eyes of society and of God. There are considerable differences between these requirements and those
of the Qur’án. They furnish but one example, albeit a good one, of the originality of the laws promulgated
in the Bayán. These are established only for the Dispensation of the Báb.

(6) References to the succeeding Manifestations of God

He reveals that the Bayán with all of its teachings and laws is a gift to

Him Whom God shall make manifest with which He can do whatever He wishes, for in the Day of Him Whom
God shall make manifest He is the Sovereign Lord, the Manifestation of Unity and the Báb is the meekest of
His servants, the first to believe in Him and to follow His commands. Him Whom God shall make manifest is

referred to more frequently, mentioned more urgently and in greater detail in the Persian Bayán that any
other subject or theme. Indeed Him Whom God shall make manifest is the focus of the Báb’s revelations, as He
Himself states. The purpose of His Revelation is to prepare humanity for the advent of the Revelation of
Him Whom God shall make manifest. In some cases His successor is referred to in the course of a passage
elucidating the nature of the Manifestation or the progressiveness of divine Revelation or the essential
requirements of faith. At other times the Báb devotes entire paragraphs to Him Whom God shall make
manifest.

The entirety of the last “báb” of the ninth Vahíd, and parts of numerous other abwáb are given over to
announcing the advent of Him Whom God shall make manifest and warning the Báb’s followers not to miss
affirming their belief in Him when He manifests Himself. If His followers do not recognize Him Whom God
shall make manifest they will have failed to attain the fruit of His Revelation, the purpose of the Bayán, and
of all the laws and teachings therein. The emphasis which He places upon acceptance of Him Whom God
shall make manifest is unparalleled in any of the Scriptures of the past, whether in the Gospels (where the
“Return” of Jesus Christ is mentioned more than any other subject) or in the Qur’án (where the references
are sparse and subtle but discernable to the serious student, such as Shaykh Ahmad and Siyyid Kazim
were, especially when supplemented by the wealth of recorded utterances of Muhammad and the Imams,
which wer also available to these scholars). He does not make specific predictions, except with
unexplained numbers and terms (such as al-Mustaghath) regarding the exact time of the declaration of the
next Manifestation, nor the appearance of Him Whom God shall make manifest.

He made pregnant statements about His successor, but only one may be interpreted as a reference to His
Name, and this statement will be quoted in full from the text of Nicolas’ translation [with the original
Persian wording of the Name in parentheses], rendering this in English and citing also the translation by
Shoghi Effendi:

> “Heureux celui qui regarde sur l’ordonnance de la splendeur de Dieu [Bahá’u’lláh], et remercie
> son Dieu par ce que cette splendeur de Dieu [Bahá’u’lláh] se manifestera certainement, et il n’y a
> pas d’autre route que cela dans le Beyan tant que Dieu elevera les ordres qu’il veut et abaissera
> ceux qu’il veut. En verite ce Dieu est fort et puissant.”6

> “Happy is he who looks upon the order of the splendor of God, and thanks his God for this
> splendor of God will undoubtedly manifest itself, and there is no other route other than that of the
> Bayán for as long as God elevates the orders of His choice and abases the orders of His choice. In
> truth this God is Strong and Powerful.”7

> “Well is it with him who fixeth his gaze upon the Order of Bahá’u’lah, and rendereth thanks unto
> his Lord. For He will assuredly be made manifest. God hath indeed irrevocably ordained it in the
> Bayán.”8

Bahá’u’lláh is the Name given by the Báb to one of His outstanding followers, whose given name was
Mirza Husayn’Alí. The translation of this passage by Shoghi Effendi demonstrates the belief of the
followers of Bahá’u’lláh, which is unreservedly affirmed in His Writings, that this passage gives the Name

of Him Whom God shall make manifest as well as making mention of His “Order”. It is not the purpose of this
paper to demonstrate the truth of this assertion…for a further elucidation of this matter we would have to
refer to other writings of the Báb, for while the Persian Bayán makes frequent mention of “Him Whom
God shall make manifest”, it does not stipulate the time of His appearance, whereas passages in certain
other writings, notably the Epistle of the Báb to Mulla Baqir, point to two particular dates, both of which,
Baha’is believe, are fulfilled by Bahá’u’lláh and none other.

(7) The Word of God

Finally, the seventh theme concerns the Word of God, which the Báb affirms to be the greatest and most
dependable testimony to the reality of the Manifestation of God and His Revelation. In numerous
passages the Báb states that the Word of God can ot be duplicated by anyone who is not a Manifestation
of God, and that anyone endued with perspicacity can recognize the Word of God and its vast superiority
to the words of mortal men. Furthermore He asserts that the Word of God is revealed in more powerful
fashion in each new Dispensation –the Word revealed in the Bayán (not just the Persian Bayán but the vast
entirety of the “Exposition” of the Báb, which is not confined to 8000 verses but may well have
encompassed well over 1,000,000 verses according to certain reports, but was cut short in 1850 with his
martyrdom) is more powerful and elevated than the Word reveale in the Qur’án, which in turn is more
powerful and elevated than that revealed in the Gospels. Not only are the teachings and laws of the
successive Dispensations progressively more challenging and elevated, but the manner of the revelation of
the Word of God and the quantity of verses revealed are also progressively more astounding. The Báb
revealed in the Persian Bayán that so powerful is the spirit of Revelation in His Day that He could reveal
1000 verses in five hours9 and that if He could find an amanuensis capable of transcribing them He could
reveal 6000 verses in the course of two days and two nights.10

The other proof of the truth of the Manifestation of God which is cited by the Báb in the Persian Bayán is
His Person. He does not go into elaborate and extensive consideration of this theme however as the
Manifestation of God remains in view only as long as his human body continues to live while the Word of
God is a permanent testimony to the truth of his Revelation which can not be effectively and intelligently
challenged by any standard and whose authority is absolute util the appearance of the subsequent
Manifestation and the revelation by him of a new Book mightier and more exalted than the last. If the
Manifestation of God to reveal but one verse the perspicacious among men would be able to discern its
superiority to all man-made verses and thereby recognized the truth of that Manifestation. The Word of
God is man’s abiding link with God, the tangible evidence of their Covenant—it contains the law which
must guide his conduct, the prayers which will bring him closer to God, the commentaries on spiritual and
practical truths which illuminate his thinking. The Báb lays special stress on this theme particularly in the
first Vahíds of the Persian Bayán.

While the intial analysis and thematic summary of the Persian Bayán was based upon a study of its
translation into French by A.L.M. Nicolas, it was subsequently confirmed through perusal of a second
translation. Edward Granville Browne, M.A. M.B., the Sir Thomas Adams Professor of Arabic in the
University of Cambridge “made a complete abstract of the Persian Bayán” which was not published in his
lifetime. That “abstract” was completed on January 1, 1889 according to Browne.11 The “abstract” was

discovered among Browne’s papers by Dr. Moojan Momen, and published with editorial notes as “A
Summary of the Persian Bayán”12, Section 3 (pages: 316 - 406) of the book Selection from the Writings of E. G.
Browne on the Bábí and Baha'i Religions (Oxford: George Ronald, 1987).

The Preludium to this Book, written by the Báb and without any subdivisions is in some ways dissimilar to
the style and organization of the rest of the work, and for this reason, as well as for the edification of the
reader, it is cited here in its entirety:

PRELUDIUM TO THE PERSIAN BAYÁN

“In the Name of God, the Inaccessible, the Most Holy”

“Glory and praise be to the holy and sublime immensity of the Sovereign, alone worthy of this name;
Who, in the past and future eternity was and will be existing in the existence of His Essence, and Who, in
the infinity of time and in the sublimity of His eternity, was and remains inaccessible to the
comprehension of all things.

“He did not create the sign of His understanding in any thing except by the powerlessness of all things to
understand Him! He did not radiate upon any thing if it was not within the existence of that thing in itself,
for, from all eternity He has been above conjunction with any thing.

“He created all thing in such a way that all by the very reality of their nature, affirm in their servitude to
Him, on the Day of Judgment, that nothing has any similarity to Him, that nothing is equal to Him, that
nothing resembles Him, and that He has neither companion nor like, that, on the contrary, He was and is
unique in the empire of His divinity, that He was and is alone in the sovereignty of His mastery.

“Nothing has understood Him as He should be understood, and it is impossible for anything to know Him
as He is deserving of being known.

“In effect, everything to which applies the word “thing” was created by Him through the King of His Will
and He radiated in it and by itself in the sublimity of His abode.

“He created the sign of His knowledge in the existence of all things so that they would be convince that it
is He the First and the Last, He the Manifest and the Hidden, He the Creator and the Sustainer, He the
Powerful and the Wise, He Who hears and He Who sees, He, the Victorious and He the Self-Subsistent,
He Who makes live and Who makes die, He the Powerful and the Inaccessible, He the Most High and the
Sublime, He of Whom not one thing can demonstrate the eminence of Whose praise, the exaltation of
Whose glorification, the Sublimity of Whose Unity, the Inaccessibility of Whose Grandeur.

“He it is Who has had neither beginning nor end, unless He is Himself the Beginning and the End.

“Everything with Him that was fixed or will be, was or will be a thing by the existence of the Lord of the
world; it is by the Word of this Essence hat it is endowed with existence.

“It is by It [the Word] that God began the creation of all things, and it is towards It (the Word] that He
ordains the return of all things.

“It is It [the Word] for which were and are all of the excellent Names so that the existence itself of His
Essenc is pure of all Names and all Attributes. His pure Essence is above all light and all exaltation, and
the Essence of His nakedness is above all sublimity and all inaccessibility.

“It is It [the Word], his Essence, the First, and we cannot know it by this word; it is It [the Word], the
Last, and by this word It cannot be described; it is It the Apparent, and by this word It cannot be styled; it
is It the Hidden, and by this word It cannot be attained.

“It is It, the Primal Will, the first believer in Him Whom God shall make manifest, it is It, the first believer in
Him Whom God manifests.

“It is It, the one thing for the sake of the creation of which the creation of all things was created, for the
maintenance of which is given the maintenance of all things, by the death of which is outlived the death of
all things, by the life of which is manifested the life of all things, by the resurrection of which all things are
resurrected.

“The eye of existence has seen nothing like It, neither before nor after. It is the Name of Divinity; it is the
Face of the Absolute Power fixed in the shadow of Divinity; it is the Name that guides all men towards the
Kingdom of the All-Powerfulness of the Unity of God If I knew that all things tasted Its love, I would not
have dared to make mention of the mention of fire: for this fire, as it has not prostrated itself in front of the
Point of Truth, was, in truth, created with the same quality of fire which exists in It.

“If all things wanted to taste His love, all, because of His love, if they were to be Light, this Light creates
Light, this Light that resides in the Light that God guides wherever He wills. In truth, this God is the First
Cause and the Last Cause.

“It is It for which God, the Unique, the only One, created from the Manifestation of His Existence,
eighteen persons who were created before all things of Its own Being. He put the sign of their knowledge
in the existence of all things in order that all things by the very existence of their essence might testify that
it is He, the First Unity and the One Who lives eternally. And He did not ordain for any of the contingent
beings any other thing than the knowledge of His own existence and the knowledge of the Unity of His
Truth, for everything that is other than this is the creature created by His order. For His is the creation
and the order in the eternity of eternities, and He it is Who is Master of the worlds.

“And then: That it not remain hidden to him who looks at these utterances that God has made the
creation of the Qur’án return in the Day of Judgment by His own appearance in Him, and He created the
creation of all things anew as if all things had been created in this instant, as each thing was created in
view of the Day of the Manifestation of God. As it is this Manifestation of God in Whom all things end, in
which all things end.

“After He has manifested Hmself in the Manifestation of the signs of His Power, there is no doubt that all
things have, with the perfection possible to them, arrived at the presence of God. Once again, God, the

Most High created the Primal Will, and, by It, created all things. But, as the actual creationof all things is
a new creation, it follows that it was of His eternal creation, eternal in the past, as there has never been a
time when God was and when there were no slaves to adore Him. He was, from all eternity, in the
complete elevation of His glory, in such manner that everything other than God was, eternally also, in the
depth of its abject rank. The beginning of the creation of all things was at this instant, that is Friday,
because God has said so.

“God erected his new creation by His order and placed it under the shadow of His order until He made it
return to Him (in the person of Him Whom God must make manifest). As there is no doubt that God created
the creature and made it return to Him (by the Intermediary of Him Whom God shall make manifest) for He is
Powerful over all things.

“Then He gave the ordinance of the creation of all things in the number of all things following the orders
which He made to descend Himself, and He made them shine from the Sun of His Mercy so that all
things by the mention of all things in all things could arrive at their perfection for the appearance of
another Judgment, and so hat He gave the reward of all things to every thing.

“If it was of “negation” it received the just chastisement, and if it was of “affirmation” the reward of the
bounty of God.

“For His knowledge over all things before all things is the same as His knowledge over all things after all
things; His Power, before the creation of all things, is the same as His Power over all things after the
creation of all things.

“For all eternity God was Knowing over all things and Powerful over all things! For Him are the excellent
names of the eternity of the Point, for Him will they be in the eternity of the future.

“All that is in the heavens and on the earth and in between the heavens and the earth sing His praises.
There is no God worthy of adoration besides Him, the Conqueror, the Well-Beloved.

“And see with the eye of certitude that the Doors [abwáb] of the Religion of the Bayán are arranged
according to the number of all things [kullu shay = 19X19 = 361]

“And in the shadow of each one of these Doors the angels of the heavens, of the earth and of what is
between position themselves, and, with the permission of God, prostrate themselves, adoring, sanctifying,
glorifying, acting and working. And all (these angels) on the Day of the Manifestation of God, Who is the
Manifestation of the Point of the Bayán, at the end of this appearance, will return to Him (in the person of
Him Whom God shall make manifest).

“And if 361 persons blessed by the Bayán believe, in the Day of Judgment, in “Him Whom God shall
make manifest”, these ones will have received the fruit of the Bayán.

“And so happy is he who is resuscitated in the presence of God on the Day of Judgment, and finds himself
acceptable to God, by one of the Doors of all things. For it is He the Master of Him Who makes all those

that have believed in the Religion of the Bayán return to Him, each one because of the act he
accomplished in one of the Doors of all things.

“Hence, hasten yourselves most certainly, most certainly towards this Manifestation. And then, most
certainly, most certainly, hasten yourselves! Hasten yourselves! Hasten yourselves most certainly! Indeed!
Hasten yourselves! Hasten yourselves! Hasten yourselves! Indeed! Indeed! For God is the most prompt of
accountants!

“It can happen that the Doors of all things will not be ready before Him, and that consequently He will
ordain the return of the creation of the Bayán and of the heavens that were upraised in the Bayán. It can
happen that He heaps them in His hand, as He did in the Qur’án without one being able to count them.
For these multiplied Doors were multiple in the service of believers and at the very moment when God
ordained the return of the creatures of the Qur’án, there as before Him only one individual. It was thus
that God does what pleases Him and ordains what He wants. He cannot be questioned on what He does,
and all the creatures will be questioned on what they do.

“And the moment in which the return of all the creation of the Qur’án took place was the beginning of
the creation of all things in the Bayán. At this moment, the seat of the Point which is the appearance of
Divinity, was found on the earth which goes by the name of Bacet (which extends the new heavens after
having folded up those of the Qur’án). And the heavens which were elevated in the Qur’án were folded up
and returned to the Primal Point.

“And bear not witness to that which God and those who are close to Him bear witness to only.

“And meanwhile God did not make an order more important than the

order of the Judgment or the means to show it to descend in the Qur’án.

“God counts the number of all those who believe in the Qur’án. But, in the moment of the return of the
Qur’án, of all these individuals, only one person remained close to God while the Judgment took place;
and so He elevated in another world, and under the order of God, the creation of all things.

“Hence, O you, O you people of the Bayán, attend yourselves to remaining not in the ignorance of God,
your Lord, for night and day you desire to become saints.”13

CHAPTER BY CHAPTER ANALYSIS

In describing the Persian Bayán chapter by chapter, an attempt has been made to avoid interpretation,
other than that which is unavoidable for a translator and summarizer. The Persian Bayán is composed of
nine subdivisions each of which is called Vahíd as pronounced in Persian, and Wahid as pronounced and
written in Arabic. Vahíd means “unity” and is derived from “one”. The first eight of these Vahíds are
each composed of nineteen abwáb (báb is the singular form and abwáb the plural form). The ninth Vahíd
is composed of ten abwáb. The báb (meaning “door” or “gate”, is a subdivision of the Vahíd. The Báb

referred in many of his writings to number symbolism so it is appropriate for us to consider the numerical
value of these two terms in Arabic. The numerical value of Vahíd is nineteen, which is reduced to
1+9=10=1+0=1, and the numerical value of báb is 5. Each Vahíd is simultaneously a symbol of the
Unity of God and of the Unity of His Religion, while each báb is likewise the symbol of the Perfect Man
and of the Manifestation of God, in this case, the Point of the Bayán, that is, the Báb.

Vahíd I

The first Vahíd is the shortest of the nine “Unities”. In the French translation it begins on page 17 and
ends on page 30. Some of its abwáb are only one verse in length. In this Vahíd there is a usage of
numerical symbolism which is explained by its Author, some enigmatic references to his followers, and a
clear enunciation of many of his teachings: the Oneness of God as the essence of Religion; affirmation of
the Manifestation of God as inseparable from affirmation of the Unity of God; the return of the past
Manifestations in the most recent Manifestation; the return of the true believers of old in the true believers
of the present; the supercession of subsequent Manifestations over previously appearing Manifestations.
He also affirms the truth of the twelve Imams, referring to each one individually and praising each one for
his adherence to the Covenant of Muhammad.

Vahíd II

The second Vahíd begins on page 31 and ends on page 145 of Volume One of the translation…it is 114
pages in length, by far the longest of the Unities. Many of its abwáb are longer than the entirety of the first
Vahíd. Consequently, we will be obliged to summarize the contents of each báb, rather than seeking to
convey the contents of the Vahíd as a whole.
This báb commences with a short caption signalling its selected theme, as follows: “Explanation of the
notion of Pilgrimage and of the Proof”14. The speech of God revealed in the Qur’án and subsequently in
the Bayán creates what has not existed heretofore, and it is the standard whereby existence may be
distinguished from non-existence. Through the Word of God, human beings come to know God, and it is
only through Him that we can come to know Him. The Word of God is the best testimony of the truth
claim of prophetic revelation—the Bayán cites the eloquence of the Qur’án as the greatest proof of the
mission of Muhammad. The Bayán is the Word of God. There is no revelation between that of the
Qur’án and that of the Bayán—the Bayán makes this emphatically clear.15 All Scriptures are the Word of
God and all Manifestations originate from the Will of God. The verses of the Bayán are proof of the Báb.
His expositions on science and philosophy are also proofs of his prophetic station God is exalted above all;
the Manifestation is not His equal—he is not even close to Him, but rather, he is God’s gift to humankind,
designated for its guidance. The verses uttered or penned by the Báb and other Manifestations are not
their verses—they are the verses of God. They are therefore superior to any and all man-made, humanly-
conceived verses. The Bayán compares the knowledge of the most learned Bábís with the knowledge of
God, indicating that the former is like the light of the stars in comparison with the light of the noon-day

sun. The Muslim who does not believe that the Báb’s verses are the verses of God is condemned by God
to spiritual ignorance, that is, he is no longer accounted among the believers in God. The Prophet of God
is the highest, the most perfect man. The Bayán indicates that people should not be critical of the
grammar and syntax of the verses he has revealed, for these are the verses of God, and it is these verses
which create the rules of grammar and syntax for men to follow. The sign of the Prophetood of the Báb
which the Bayán acclaims as the most manifest is the Báb’s ability to reveal verses without reflection or
hesitation and with the utmost rapidity. The Bayán implies that only a Manifestation of God can do this.
A knowledge of sciences, including the sciences of grammar and syntax is attained by men so that they
might better understand the Word of God. The Manifestation of God has no need of these sciences for he
has innate knowledge. In this close of this báb, it is affirmed that the Ithna ‘Ashari Shi’ah are closer to the
truth of Islam than the Ahl al-Sunna. The closing verse is as follows: “For He is the Best of Aids, the Best
of Guardians, the Best of Accountants, and of Managers.”16
The second báb begins with this caption: “On this, that nobody may embrace the science of all that is
contained in the Bayán, except for Him Whom God shall make manifest.”17 In this báb it is affirmed that the
only ones who can write authoritative commentaries on the Bayán, and the only one who can correctly
interpret its contents are the Báb Himself, Him Whom God shall make manifest, and whomsoever the latter
may instruct with his knowledge. Once again the criteria for true belief in God are reiterated: they are
belief in the Manifestation of God and obedience to the laws of God revealed by the Manifestation. He
closes with: “Profit from this example, O perspicacious men, and hereafter understand the Command of
God!”18
This báb begins with the invocation: “In the explanation of this, that what is in the Bayán contains the
order of all things.”19 The opening summary of this báb is this: “From God, for all men, there are two
testimonies: one, the verses, the other, the Person upon whom the verses descend.”20 In this báb, it is
revealed that the ‘ulama’ have turned against the Báb because He is damaging their social rank and
threatening their firm grip of control over their congregants. The Bayán ordains no priesthood and
expects Him Whom God shall make manifest to take care of this aspect of religious organization. Few read the
verses of God notwithstanding the fact that they are the testimony of God to humanity: all that man can
see in them is God. So-called, false-hearted believers buy expensive Qur’áns but do not read the verses
contained therein, while it is those verses which are the real treasure.

Two alternatives are open to the individual soul: either affirmation of the truth of the Manifestation or
negation and rejection—no other options exist. For every hidden bok there is one which is manifest, and
the one who follows the orders of the silent Book is a speaking Book (that is, he becomes a walking, talking
Qur’án, or, in this case, Bayán), and the speaking Book is Him Whom God shall make manifest. The last page
of this báb is concerned exclusively with Him Whom God shall make manifest and preparing mankind and
especially the followers of the Báb to recognize and follow Him.
The fourth báb is concerned with the “Explanation of those letters which are ‘iliyyin21 and those which
are not”.22 The ‘iliyyin letters are representative of the good, of the attributes of God, while the non-
‘iliyyin letters are representative of evil, the attributes of Satan (which the Bayán aptly defines as “selfish
desire”). Every word is endowed with a spirit which belongs to God, comes from God, and it is because of
this spirit that the believer is made joyful by the verses of God and suffers from the words of the
unbelievers. There are two kinds of words according to the Bayán—the paradisical and the firey (or
hellish). From the formula, “There is no God but the One God”, the letters of negation represent “There
is no God” and the letters of affirmation (‘iliyyin) manifest “but the One God”. God has created negation
is a condition whose result is the fire, and He has created negation as a condition whose result is the Fire,
and He has created affirmation as a condition whose result is Paradise. This is both man’s nature and the
nature of the Book of God. Good and evil deeds and words return to those who were responsible for
manifesting them in the first place.

Whoever believes in the Báb during his Dispensation is in the Paradise of God until the advent of “Him
Whom God shall make manifest” when he must become a believer in Him or be ejected from Paradise
and consigned to the Fire. The meaning of Paradise is acceptance of the truth of God while Hell is
rejection of this truth. It is up to man to choose which he will live with, which is best for him. No fire is
fiercer than that of negation and no paradise is more beautiful than that of affirmation. The origin of
negation is not in God but in the soul of the negator. Only “Him Whom God shall make manifest can give the
negator refuge from his just punishment. Only those who become Bábís in the Dispensation of the Báb
will be pardoned their misdeeds; all others will suffer the punishment which God has ordained for their
education. The Bayán reveals that the true successor to Muhammad in the “Apostolic Succession” of
Islam was ‘Alí rather than Umar. One can take refuge in the legitimate successors to the Manifestation of
God as well as in Him; in the Islamic Dispensation these were the Imams, and the Doors (four abwáb).
Likewise, during this Dispensation of the Báb this sanctuary was to be found in the Bayán of the Báb. No
harm will come to the believer who reads the words of the negators if he seeks refuge in God and
nourished his heart with the soothing, invigorating verses of affirmation which have streamed from the
Pen of the Merciful.

The fifth báb is concerned with the good and evil names which have descended in the Bayán. Of these
“every good name that God made descend in the Bayán has as its goal, in its primary truth, Him Whom
God shall make manifest. Every evil name that God has caused to descend in the Bayán has as its goal, in its
primary truth, the speech of negation in the time of Him Whom God shall make manifest.23 To a lesser extent
every good name applies to all believers in Him Whom God shall make manifest. Not only do they apply to
Him Whom God shall make manifest—the good names in the Qur’án refer to the Primal Point (the Báb) and
the good names in the Book of Him Whom God shall make manifest will apply to the Manifestation who is to
follow him. What God reveals in His Book is the knowledge of God. The meaning of the Qur’ánic word
EARTH is explained in this báb. According to the Bayán this word applies to the Manifestation of God;
the most exalted places on earth are those which have been frequented by the Manifestations of God. The

Bayán cites Mah-Ku, where the Persian Bayán and several other works were revealed as one such place.
Where EARTH refers to the residence of the Arch-defector, the First Negator, that place is the most
despicable of all places. The Bayán cites Shi’i examples of both types of EARTH inasmuch as he is
particularly addressing his writings to the most recently elect of God, namely the Ithná ‘Asharíyya
Muslims.

The sixth báb is also short, and its theme is the BALANCE of God. It begins with, “In this one that the
Bayán is the balance of God even to the day of the appearance of Him Whom God shall make manifest.
Whoever obeys it is light, whoever turns away is fire.”24 He reveals that the verses of the Bayán, and of all
the Holy Books revealed prior to it were revealed for the sake of the adoration of God and not to be used
as instruments for opposition to any one, especially opposition to the Manifestation of God. He repeats his
assertion that the piety and good works of Christians in the Dispensation of Muhammad, and of Muslims
in the Dispensation of the Báb are for naught. Whosoever is under the balance of the Bayán is in the
highest Paradise and with the coming of the subsequent Manifestation, He is the new balance of the
previous Book and the followers thereof. Furthermore, if the soul transgresses against the revealed Will of
God he hurts only himself; the Revelation of God is a bounty revealed for the sake of man, for his
happiness and perfection and not for the happiness and perfection of God Who is Self-Subsisting and
Independent of All Things.

The seventh báb is an explanation of the meaning of the DAY OF JUDGMENT: it is the period of the
earthly existence of the Manifestation of God on earth in the human form. During this period there occurs
the Final Judgment of the followers of the preceeding Manifestation. The greatest testimony of faith in
Jesus for the Christian is in the acceptance of Muhammad in the Day of his Manifestation –or, during his
Dispensation, for, from the moment of His declaration to the moment of the declaration of the next
Manifestation He is the Lord of Judgment—and the greatest testimony of faith in Muhammad for the
Muslim is the acceptance of the Báb in the Day of His appearance. A tiny fraction of a second of the
period between the declaration and ascension of the Manifestation of God is better than all of the years
which pass between two Days of Judgment, that is, between the lifetimes of two Manifestations of God.
For example, a second during the life of Christ was more potent, more worthwhile, more precious than
the entirety of the six hundred years between His ascension and the declaration of Muhammad. The
previous Dispensation bears its fruit in the Day of Judgment of the latter Dispensation. The Báb therefore
calls upon His followers to be vigilant in their expectation of the appearance of Him Whom God shall make
manifest. He implores His followers not to attack Him Whom God shall make manifest even if they do not follow
Him, as the Muslims attacked Him and as the infidels attacked Muhammad. The Day of Judgment
cannot occur previous to the declaration of the Manifestation of God, for previous to His declaration
nobody knows He is the Manifestation and it is only after His station has been revealed and the proofs of
His station set forth that the faith of the believers in the previous Manifestation can be tested.

Báb eight reveals the manifold meanings of the word DEAD. He who is the perfect follower of the
Manifestation is dead to all but this Manifestation in that he does not live according to a contrary will of
his own. As it is the command of God that all die to everything except the Will of God –and few have
done so--, the very breath of the unbelievers is illicit for it is in obedience to their own will rather than to
the Will of God. Purgatory is the period between the two Manifestations of God; during the Day of
Judgment, Paradise is exalted and Hell is made to burn as the believers are separated from the non-
believers by virtue of their faith or lack thereof in the living Manifestation of God. Only God knows what
will happen to men after death; men have invented concepts of the afterlife which are of no benefit
whatsoever to them. One meaning of DEATH is that it is the rejection of the Manifestation of God, while
life is affirmation of the truth of the Manifestation of God, while life is affirmation of the truth of the
Manifestation of God. If a believer allows anything not worthy of the Báb into his heart he is not dead to
all else but Him at that moment. People do not realize that the highest rank which man can attain is
DEATH –death to all save God. The Manifestation of God is the Primal Will; he is the first one to obey
God when he speaks. The ARCH is the location of the Manifestation of God, not the thing which
Muslims suppose it to be: an actual arch from which God is suspended. He identifies ‘Alí, the Commander
of the Faithful and the first Imam as the first believer in Muhammad. The attributes of closeness and
exaltation are not applicable to God because His Essence is beyond all description. He mentions the proof
of Prophethood which is manifest in the Person of the Manifestation and he affirms that Him Whom God
shall make manifest, the Manifestation destined to succeed him, is the first creation of God, and the God
Himself is without equal or peer. Within His own rank, God has attributes which reflect Himself and
which none other can approach: He is the Best-Beloved and He has no lovers befitting this attribute that is
uniquely His. The attributes of God made manifest in His Manifestation are never comparable to Him.
The sovereignty of Muhammad is therefore infinitely inferior and veritably unmentionable before the
sovereigny of God. God reveals Himself in all things, that man may forget Him at no time and in nothing.
All things depend utterly upon the Will of God, and this Will depends utterly on God, the Unique One.
God is unconnected to anything else; all else is His creation; His Will is likewise created by Him; all things
radiate from the Primal Will which He created; nothing can know Him; He has neither companion nor
offspring.

The ninth báb has a central message: Every spirit is given a TOMB according to its rank and all spirits
end in the Day of Judgment of Him Whom God shall make manifest when all souls will be resurrected. The
Bayán goes on to reveal that the entire spiritual creation of God is under the dominion of God and that
each Manifestation recreates the creation of God through the power of God. True believers in one
Dispensation are elevated to the shadow of the following Manifestation while non-believers are not. The
Judgment is an interrogation in which the individual is judged according to his good and evil works.
Everything good has its origin in the Manifestation of God and to a lesser extent in his followers, while
everything that is evil is from the Anti-Christ and his followers whom the Bayán refers to as the Letters of
Negation (even as his disciples are the Letters of the Living and his followers are the Letters of
Affirmation). Whosoever affirms the truth of the Manifestation is a manifestation of the first affirmer, and

whosoever negates this truth is a manifestation of the first negator. The spirit of the believer associates
with the spirits of afirmation while the spirit of the non-believer associates with the spirits of negation. The
Fire which afflicts non-believers is too powerful for words to express and likewise is the reward of the
believers in Paradise. No spirit ever goes beyond its limits –eternally its existence remains distinct from
other existences. After this earthly life, man is either punished or rewarded, according to the faith he
manifested in his earthly life. It is possible for the resident of Paradise to fall into the Fire of unbelief if he
does not recognize and affirm the truth of the new Manifestation. During PURGATORY, which is the
period of the Dispensation of the Manifestation that begins at the time of his ascension and the ends with
the declaration of the new Manifestation, the Will of God permits the entry into the Paradise of belief
whomsoever He willeth and only the true believer an understand the workings of the Will of God.

Báb ten is concerned with “on the Day of Judgment the believers in Him Whom God shall make manifest will
ask men, ‘Upon what is your faith based?’ They will reply, ‘On the testimony of the Bayán.’”25 In this way
will they deny the truth of the new Manifestation of God, Him Whom God shall make manifest and thereby
deprive themselves of the bounties of belief and the benefits of Paradise. Everything associated with
negators is through the order of God pronounced to be Hell and everything associated with affirmers is
pronounced to be Paradise. Hence, we may conclude that if anyone should find that the Bayán or any of
the writings of the Báb proves to be a veil concealing the light of the new Manifestation from men, they
should be discarded as worthless, nay, as an influence which hampers men from attaining to the purpose
of their existence and the purpose of God in revealing His Word.

Báb eleven reaffirms the truth that all things are created by the Word of God, that whatever He mentions
by name has been created by virtue of His mention. The place and position of all things is decided by God
and revealed through His Primal Will. Through the Manifestation is effected the resurrection—all things
are resuscitated by the grace of God, and this expression has a spiritual not a material meaning: the bodies
do not leave their graves in order to become reanimated with earthly life, rather, the spirits are given new
life through belief in and adherence to the new Manifestation of God.

Báb twelve of the second Vahíd explains the SYRAT, the “bridge” referred to in the Qur’án. At the end
of each Age or Epoch appears the Manifestation of God and His order –this is the SYRAT. It is higher,
more glorious than all of creation, and without physical limits. For the believers, the “bridge” is more vast
than the limitless space; while for unbelievers it is finer than a hair and sharper than the cutting edge of a
saber. Crossing this spiritual bridge over Hell begins with belief in the verses or the Person of the
Manifestation, and it may last until the next Judgment Day when it is tested in the presence of the new
Manifestation of God. How many have believed and and many have hesitated and been unable to choose
between belief or unbelief. And how many have disbelieved and how many at the point of death who have
been thrown into the fire of unbelief, notwithstanding a lifetime of devotion to God and His
Manifestation.

Báb thirteen of the second Vahíd reveals the truth of the BALANCE and its correct meaning, which is the
Point of Truth –the Manifestation of God. The highest degree of the BALANCE is the Unity of God
which is manifested in these verses: “There is no God but the One God.” The Manifestation of God is
inseparable both from God and from His teachings in the eye of the true believer. In this Day, that is to
say at the time the Bayán was revealed, the Balance is the Bayán. Whosoever is accepted as a believer in
the Báb and his Book is one of the ranks of the Balance, and whosoever is found to be unacceptable –
whoever has deviated from him even a tiny bit—is humbled to the lowest rank until the Day of Judgment
of Him Whom God shall make manifest at which time he will be given another opportunity to ‘save his soul’.

Báb fourteen of the second Vahíd unveils the significance of the RECKONING. Only God can judge His
creatures rightfully, and He does so through His Manifestation. The RECKONING He makes is of souls
who have believed in Him, not of bodies. The instrument of the Count whereby souls are found to be
believers or non-believers is the Word of God. The Bayán designates Arabic as the most eloquent of
languages. The verses of God are revealed in a manner, style and with subject matter which make them
utterly unsimilateable by any human mind or pen. The Bayán asserts that if an ammanuensis were to be
found capable of transcribing the words of the Báb, He could reveal 2000 verses in one day, and even if
one could not be found He would reveal as many as could be transcribed and in such manner that no
intelligent man could deny their divine origin. The speech of God is the very being of the Primal Will
which is the Word of God. Nevertheless, this speech of God is a creation of God and not of His Essence.
The easiest form whereby the Báb may reveal the Will of God is through His verses. It is much easier than
the writing of prayers, answers to scientific questions and utterances in the Persian language. We may
deduce that the revelations which the Báb himself finds to be easiest come to him in the Arabic language
and in free-flowing verses. People fear the RECKONING made of their material benefits, that is, the
fortunes and misfortunes of this world, and they do not fear the RECKONING of God which is based
upon His Religion and their faith –even though it is this RECKONING alone that matters. In the seventh
year and the seventh month, or the seventh month following the declaration of Him Whom God shall make
manifest the RECKONING will take place. That is, if He wishes it to be so, for Him Whom God shall make
manifest will do as He pleases and He cannot be rightfully asked of His doings whereas all men shall be
sked of their doings, and judged accordingly.

Báb fifteen of the second Vahíd commences with “In the explanation of the Book, and in this, the Book is
true.”26 Although this is a relatively lengthy báb, a short summary thereof is possible. The word DOOR
refers to that which is manifested from the Point of Truth not the Essence of God which is unchanging.
Everything revealed by the Point of Truth is called a Book. The Bayán relates these words to various
earthly compounds, expressing their differences and at the same time their exaltation above all perishable
realities--His verses are incorruptible water, His sermons are milk which cannot go sour, His
commentaries on verses are red wine, His replies or commentaries or oraisons are as eternally pure honey

and His Persian utterances are the same as the utterance of verses. The Bayán states here what is affirmed
elsewhere several times in the course of the Persian Bayán, that the true believer is of greater rarity than
red sulphur. It explains that the Last Judgment is so called because it is the Last Judgment before the
coming of the next Manifestation of God; it is the only one with which we are familiar, the last that we
have experienced. The relativity of religious truth is clearly demonstrated in view of the limitations and
progressive evolution of mankind and the creativeness of God Who is always creating anew His creation.
God does not create contradictions; sectarian adherents of religion create contradictions by attaching
themselves dogmatically to one understanding or another of the revealed Will of God and not yielding to
the eternal process of change which is inevitable in a creative universe governed by a creative Creator.
The Bayán does not seem to clarify whether the world of faith and the order of human spiritual existence
alone is recreated.

Báb sixteen of the second Vahíd is nearly as long as the entirety of the first Vahíd. It is concerned with the
explanation of the meanings of FIRE and PARADISE which, the Báb claims, were understood by none
but the Manifestations of God until they were revealed in the Persian Bayán. In all Dispensations it is
through the permission of the first believer that the doors of truth are opened. The world of souls
corresponds to the world of appearances, so that when the Manifestation of Muhammad in the world of
appearances revealed the first creature, in the soul of all believers in Him was born the conviction that He
was the first creature. Paradise is the state of belief in the Manifestation of God; there is no Paradise
higher in the knowledge of God than the reality of Muhammad; after his ascension, the highest Paradise
was ‘Alí and after his ascension each Imam was in his turn a Paradise, for belief in Him alone was belief in
God and belief in anything else but Him was counted as unbelief. One Paradise does not invalidate or
lower the rank of the previous or succeeding Paradise—each retains its place according to the following
hierarchy: the first and greatest Paradise is that of God, the second and next in rank is the Paradise of the
Manifestation of God, in this case Muhammad; the third is the Paradise of the Imams (as noted earlier the
twelve Imams of Ithna ‘Ashari Shi’i Islam are cited by the Báb as the spiritual successors to the leadership
of Islam while the caliphs are summarily dismissed as usurpers and Covenant-breakers), the fourth are the
Doors (abwáb), and the fifth the rank and file Ithna ‘Ashari believers. The wisdom of this is that the
greatest happiness attainable to man is found in the glorification of God. In fact, there is no real and
lasting delight to be found except in the knowledge of the Unity of God.

It is not by worshipping though that men can attain unto His pleasure but through obedience to the latest
Manifestation of the Unity of God. The Bayán indicates that the Christians surely would have accepted
Muhammad had they known that He was the return of Christ in great glory and power, and likewise the
Muslims would have accepted Him had they understood that He is the return in greater glory still of the
Messenger of God Himself. He makes reference to the coming of Him Whom God shall make manifest
mentioning two numbers in this connection – the number of God (which Nicolas believes to be the
number of all things, that is, 361, and which might be 19, the number of divine Unity), and the number
2001\. The Bayán reveals that the Báb’s followers should not be hampered from recognizing Him Whom
God shall make manifest because of any references to His advent made in the Bayán. If the Bábí hears that a
man has revealed verses akin to the verses of the Bayán and the perspicacious wise men of the age have

recognized Him, then he must not hesitate to affirm His truth for this is Him Whom God shall make manifest.
It is not the right of the believer to interrogate the Manifestation of God; he must follow Him and without
hesitating once the signs of His Prophethood have been clearly established.

The Bayán repeats the teaching that all who do not believe in the succeeding Manifestation thereby prove
their lack of faith in the preceeding Manifestation; that only God knows what happens to the human being
after death. He who enters the Paradise of belief in the Manifestation of God in this world will go to the
Paradise of the next world and likewise will the inhabitant of the Fire of negation in this world go to the
Fire in the next world. It is better to guide oner person to the Truth of God than to possess all that is in
this world. Belief in the Manifestation of God is without substance when it is not affirmed through the
recognition and acceptance of the Manifestation in His human form. All things seek a relation to God and
relation to the believer is related to God – the believer is a door into the Paradise of affirmation.
Consequently, earthly places and objects are blessed through their contact with believers in God. Thus
does God exalt and abase every thing according to His Will and not the will of any other than Him.

Whereas báb sixteen is concerned mainly with the unfolding of the meanings of PARADISE, báb
seventeen of the second Vahíd focuses on the FIRE. Even as there are many gradations of PARADISE,
there are infinite gradations of the FIRE. The essence of the essences of the FIRE is the absence of the
knowledge of God. The essence of all things which love God and which God in turn loves return to the
Manifestation of God and the essence of all things which do not love the Manifestation of Go and the
Essence of God go to the FIRE. As the Bayán explained, the first believer’s belief is the cause of all others’
belief, and the first unbeliever’s denial is the cause of the denial of all others. The first negator is identified
by Nicolas, Shoghi Effendi and all other students of the Bábí Revelation with which the present author is
familiar as Haji Mirza Aqasi, the Grand Vizier of Iran during the reign of Muhammad Shah27. The first
believer in the Báb is identified in numerous passages of the Bayán as Mulla Husayn Bushru’i, to whom
the Báb first declared His mission in Shíráz. Whereas in the Dispensation of Muhammad the doors into
PARADISE were the Messenger of God, His Imams, His Doors and His believers, in the Dispensation of
the Báb there are ony 19 doors into PARADISE and these are the Báb and His eighteen Letters of the
Living. The difference between the believer and the non-believer is very great, and it is determined
according to one truth – the unbeliever may accept everything but the Manifestation of God, but because
he does not affirm the truth of the Manifestation of God he forfeits PARADISE. God wants to be obeyed
according to His terms and not according to ours!

The Point of the Bayán calls upon His followers to be the first from amongst all mankind to recognize Him
Whom God shall make manifest and not the first to deny Him, for the former is an inestimable benefit while
the latter is a most grievous chastisement. It is because of the individual soul’s ignorance that he is subject
to the FIRE – he keeps himself from God; God does not make up his mind for him. He clarifies the
gradations of the FIRE and of PARADISE, revealing that all are multiplications of the original 19 (the
original Unity) of the believers and of the negators. The creation of the Qur’án was with the Bayán in
mind and the creation of the Bayán is with Him Whom God shall make manifest in mind. Him Whom God shall
make manifest will change FIRE into Light and Light into FIRE when He is made manifest, because some

who are FIRE for having denied the truth of the Bayán and its Revealer will accept Him Whom God shall
make manifest and some who accepted the truth of the Bayán and the station of the Báb will deny Him
Whom God shall make manifest. If Him Whom God shall make manifest is believed in while He is yet invisible,
before His declaration, when He makes His declaration it is possible that the believers will not oppose
Him but rather will not hesitate to accept Him. One of the most astounding statements in the Persian
Bayán is this verse:

> “Although the decisions of God are diverse in every state, in the Bayán there is no mention which
> is not the mention (of Him Whom God shall make manifest). Thus it may be that at the moment of His
> Manifestation He will not be tormented by the perception of a single anxiety on the part of the
> believers, who believe in Him in the very time in which He was invisible, in which they all awaited
> Him.”28

Báb eighteen and báb nineteen are both short, and both describe the nature of the Manifestation of God
and the relations between Dispensations. In báb eighteen the HOUR is revealed as the Will of God
manifest in the Book of His Revelation. The Manifestation must use words of human fabrication in order
to commuicate to men the divine significance. The HOUR in the Bayán is the Day of the Báb and it is the
time when man is brought face to face with his Creator a He is manifested in the Revelation of the Báb
(and in other Revelations, in the Revelation of the Lord of that Age, each a Manifestation in His own
right). Human words cannot communicate the fullness of this theme or of any other theme: were all the
seas ink and all things pens, and were their hands enough to whield all of these pens, nevertheless the
fullness of this theme and of many other themes could never be divulged.

The closing báb (19) of this Vahíd reiterates certain teachings of the Báb already mentioned, and we will
mention them again only cursorilly. God and His Manifestation are the Best-Beloved of all souls save
those who are unaware that their greatest happiness is to be found in his love, this affirmation. The
testimony of one Manifestation is a gift to His successor and the latter is free to accept or discard this gift
as He sees fit. Very few would disbelieve in the return of the Manifestation they have accepted if they
could know this to be true. The Bayán and all of the other writings of the Báb are gifts whch He proffers
before Him Whom God shall make manifest. This báb ends with the following verses, as powerful as any in
these first two Vahíds and clearly revelatory of the tone of their Author29:

> “God does not need you, nor anything which depends upon you; and you, if you give to yourselves
> the title of being dependent upon God, then, because of this claimed relation you have displayed
> your arrogance. In truth, you only annihilate yourselves: you will see that and you will be
convinced.”

Vahíd III

The third Vahíd is 73 pages long and as many of its themes are depicted in the first and second Vahíds,
the description of the content of this Vahíd will not be as detailed as that to which the reader has become
accustomed.
In the first báb the Báb affirms that everything that is on the earth belongs to God and that therefore it
belongs to the Manifestation of God, and whatever He wants should be given to Him as a matter of right.
The second báb affirms the creative power of the Word of God and the superiority of this Word to any
human utterances. He condemns ‘Umar and Abú Bakr and exalts ‘Alí, the Commander of the Faithful.
He also reveals that if God does not make mention of something, such as the Fire, it does not exist.
The third báb reaffirms that the purpose of the Bayán is fulfilled in Him Whom God shall make manifest, and
that the purpose of each Holy Book is the subsequent Manifestation of God.
The fourth báb states that the verses and words of Him Whom God shall make manifest will be of a more
exalted character and more numerous than those of the Báb. It is indicated that this is always the case
with the progressive revelations of the Manifestations of God. The order of God is revealed in its pristine
simplicity--everything begins and ends with Him, and everything that exists is under the shadow of the
Manifestation of God.

The fifth báb maintains that the Manifestation of God is endowed with the power and prerogative to
make “holy” places “secular” and “secular” places “holy”. He manifests the Will of God and nothing else:
therefore, He is perfect and infallible, for He doeth whatsoever He (God) willeth.

The REUNION is explained in the sixth báb: the “reunion” of all sciences in the Manifestation of God
and His Book is the affirmation of God that there is only one God and that all else besides Him is His
creation. The Manifestation of God and the sea of names and attributes which reflect God alone and
always are His creations, not His Essence. Creation is through the Manifestation of God, which is the
Primal Will, which is the Word of God. The Báb refers to Himself as the “Master of the Seven Letters”30.
The numerical value of His title, the Báb, is five, and the numerical value of all things (of which He is the
Master) is 361,so He is not referring to either of these verities. It might be surmised that He refers here to

the seven proofs of His mission, revealed in the Dalá’il-i-sab’ih during His imprisonment in the fortress of
Mah-Ku, where He also revealed the Persian Bayán. However it is even more likely that He refers here to
the seven Arabic letters of His given name, ‘Alí Muhammad (y-l-y-m-h-m-d).

The seventh báb enunciates the truth that the presence of God is attained by man through the presence of
the Manifestation of God and never in the presence of His Essence, which is unattainable. The mention of
anything other than God is a mention of a reflection of God and not that which is Self-Subsisting, that
which has an independent existence. As the Manifestation of God is the Sun of Reality, and all other
created beings are mirrors which reflect the light of this Sun, and as this Sun represents all that the
creature may know of God, so the apprehension of the Manifestation of God by this creature is its
apprehension of God. This theme-–of the spiritual reality of Unity and of the nature of God as Essence,
His Sign as the Sun and His creatures as mirrors reflecting the attributes of that Sun—is made mention of
in many passages of the Bayán. Although outwardly it seems to be simple, we shall see that it is very subtle
indeed.

The eighth báb reviews the following subjects: everything that exists is in the Bayán—the word and the
spirit attached to this word, not the being itself and the spirit attached to the being; Him Whom God shall
make manifest is manifest in the mirrors of the Bayán; good can only be attained in this Day through
acceptance of Him. He also develops certain new themes: all good comes from the 19 names of God and
the 19 letters (the Báb and the 18 Letters of the Living), and all bad comes from the 19 names of negation
and the 19 letters of negation and whatever is born of these returns to them; God has fixed a limit to the
revelation of Himself and no more can be revealed of Him in the present or in the future; the rank of
every created thing is fixed and it cannot become greater or lesser than it is—man cannot become God
and God cannot become man. He concludes with a commentary on the letter “B”. The eighth báb affirms
that everything contained in the Bayán is revealed in one of the verses of the Bayán.

It is also affirmed in the ninth báb that everything that is contained in the Bayán is revealed in one of its
verses. The verse which contains all other verses, which contains the 19 names of God and, in their
shadow, the 19 letters of affirmations are as follows:

> “If we make this Bayán descend upon whomever is in the invisibilities of the heavens, of the earth,
> and of that which is between them, all would be in God, their (1)MERCIFUL Lord. Allah! There
> is no God but Him, THE (2)VICTORIOUS, THE (3)EVIDENT, THE (4)UNIQUE, THE
> (5)INACCESSIBLE, THE (6)SUBLIME, THE (7)EXALTED, THE (8)MOST HOLY. His are
> the excellent names. He Who is in the heavens, on the earth and between them exalts His (9)glory.
> And He is (10)EXALTED ABOVE WHAT MEN CAN SAY. Say: In truth, God! It is He, the
(11)KING, the (12)SULTAN, the (13)ALL-POWERFUL, the (14)KNOWING: His are the

> exalted names. (15)He Who is in the heavens, (16)on the earth and (17)between the two prostrates
> himself before Him. In truth, He is the (18)CHERISHED, the (19)WELL-BELOVED.”31

The tenth báb reveals the meanings of RETURN and RESURRECTION and of the NEW
CREATION. These three words have on and the same meaning and this is the return of attributes, of
qualities, such as in the return of the attributes of the Manifestation in the Manifestations of God, and the
return of the attributes of servitude in the true believers in the Manifestations of God. The letter “B” is
revealed to be the essence of the Bayán.

The multiplication of all names and attributes from the 19 names revealed in the eighth báb is cited.
Colors are ranked according to the different aspects of man (that is, of the believer, whose mirror reflects
the light of the Sun of Truth) with which they are associated. White is related to the heart, yellow to the
spirit, green to the soul, red to the body. If a color other than these is reflected in the mirror of the believer
then he is a non-believer, for these colors alone does God love. All of these names and letters and their
spirits exist only through the Point of Truth, which was Muhammad in the Qur’án, the Báb in the Bayán
and in the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest they exist by the Sun of Truth Himself, which radiates
His splendor in the verses of truth. All besides this radiation in His Day are shadows in the mirrors, having
no reality. This is the message of the eleventh báb, which is followed by the brief twelfth báb.

The twelfth báb reveals the meaning of the POINT—it is the Primal Will Who is referred to in the first
letter (“B”) of the formula of faith, be it Bismi’llah (also caled shahada) or another. Themes which have
already been touched upon are treated in a new light: true Bábís must accept Him Whom God shall make
manifest when He appears in order to be accounted among the believers; the essence of faith and of
knowledge is to become dead to everything bt God and His Manifestation; ‘Alí, the first mirror of
Muhammad returns in every Dispensation; the infallibility of Him Whom God shall make manifest; all power,
sovereignty, learning and wealth come from the Sun of Truth as they appear in the mirrors of men when
they are turned towards the Sun of Truth; Paradise and the Fire; God guides whomever He wishes along
the straight and narrow path; God loves those who fear Him and He does not like to mention those who
will only accept the Manifestation if He is accepted by the “doctors” of Christianity and Islam (and other
faiths), and this is because these “doctors” will not accept Him and are residents of the Fire.

The thirteenth báb is replete with original themes, all of them of great importance. It is not permissable
for followers of the Báb (and presumably non-believers as well) to interrogate Him Whom God shall make
manifest with regard to anything but His own Book—this is so that the response that Him Whom God shall
make manifest will give will bring happiness and joy to the interrogator. He loves only those hearts which
demonstrate godliness and the love of God. From the Manifestation of Adam to the declaration of the

Báb, 12,210 years have transpired; before Adam there were infinite worlds and men, and no other but
God can count their number. In every world the Manifestation of God was the Point of the Bayán, the
Letters were the Letters of the Living and the names were similar to the 19 names manifestated in the
Bayán. Him Whom God shall make manifest is the Primal Will in all worlds and His Book is the Book of the
Primal Wll in all worlds. The Báb celebrates Him Whom God shall make manifest as a Manifestation of God
and decrees that all are His slaves, including Himself. All of the attributes of the Manifestations Who
preceeded the Báb are in Him, but He does not call Himself by their names because there is progress in
the world and each Manifestation is greater than the next. When the Dispensation of one Manifestation
reaches its “age of reason”, the Dispensation of a new Manifestation commences. The testimony of the
Bayán was withheld from some so that they would not be afflicted with the Fire should they deny its truth.
Him Whom God shall make manifest will not be satisfied to leave a single believer in the Báb upon the earth in
impiety, even if all of the kings and wisemen among the unbelievers become His followers; it is His desire
that all believers return to Him so that they will be saved from the Fire and able to enter Paradise. He calls
upon the Bábís to teach the religion of God and propagate its order. In each Dispensation the
Manifestation of God unifies His people and His aim and greatest satisfaction is in bringing together all
the peoples of the earth.

The fourteen báb ordains the preservation of the Book of the Bayán in the greatest state of perfection and
beauty of which each individual is capable, for it is the most precious of all things. The greater the
attention paid to its preservation, the more the spirit which is attached to its verses will be manifested. He
calls for beautiful and uniform writing, fine paper, rich ornamentationand the greatest possible lightness of
the manuscript paper it is not good to write on the margins as this lowers the price of the Book in the eyes
of men. This báb ends with a verse of unusual character which is quoted as follows:

> “All of the splendor [Bahá’] of the Bayán is Him Whom God shall make manifest, all the mercy for
> whosoever has believed in Him, all the chastisement for him who does not believe in Him.”32

The fifteenth báb identifies the Manifestation of God as the BEAUTY of God, for all things become
nothing before the revelations of His “BEAUTY”. Again, the teaching is reiterated that true belief is in
acceptance of the most recent Manifestation of God and nothing else can take its place, even belief in
thousands of previous Manifestations. He also reminds His readers that believers may become unbelievers
and that non-believers may become believers in the Day of Judgment; that only God knows when Him
Whom God shall make manifest will become manifest; that the proofs of the Manifestations and of Him Whom
God shall make manifest in particular are His verses and His Person.

In the sixteenth báb, the Bayán reveals that God values eagerness in obedience to Him above all things.
Nobody is permitted to go beyond the limits set by the Bayán until the coming of Him Whom God shall make
manifest. He encourages His followers to learn the sciences of letters and numbers and to organize the

passages of the Bayán in whatever way each is pleased to do so, in other words, to treat it as a thousand
separate pages. The organization of the text may be changed to aid understanding, but not one word may
be altered. It is in this báb that the verse mentioned in the beginning of the Book is found:

> “Happy is he who looks upon the order of the splendor [Bahá’] of God, and thanks his God for
> this splendor [Bahá’] of God will undoubtedly manifest itself…”33

He asserts that one line from His commentaries upon the Qur’án is worth more than all of the
commentaries written by men from the revelation of the Qur’án until its abrogation in the Bayán—
indeed, to compare these two is like comparing the light of the Sun to that of the stars.

The seventeenth báb restates the Bayán’s insistence upon the preservation of the Báb’s Writings in the
most perfect state possible, but each according to his capacity, and not according to a fixed standard. In
this way will new believers be attracted to the Religion of the Bayán, and well taken care of Bayáns are
signs that the Bábís are ready to serve Him Whom God shall make manifest and hence to serve God. All of the
Writings of the Báb are called Bayán, and this applies to all five categories of His works—first to His
verses, second to His prayers, third to His commentaries, fourth to His consideration of scientific
questions, and fifth to His utterances in Persian (presumably then all the other categories were written in
Arabic). Bayán is a name of God and it can be given to a child. (As we shall later see, the Báb ordains the
bestowal of the names of God as names for children.) He then explains the numerical symbolism of Bayán
and Vahíd, the combined value of which is 95, which is the mirror of God and of Him Whom God shall make
manifest and which has the symbolic value of “for God”.

In the eighteenth báb the Báb ordains that commentaries on the Bayán and all other writings made by
men be written beautifully and in one script rather than in several scripts all mixed together; He desires
that all things be perfected. A good copy should be made by each believer, or if he is unable to make one,
by someone he selects to do so on his behalf.

The nineteenth báb explains the meaning of ARK OF GOD as the place where the Manifestation of God
is, whether this place is outwardly the highest place of grandeur or in the lowest place of the dust. Also
God loves those who spend as much as they can on the Books of the Báb and who thus manifest in
material terms their inestimable value; it is praiseworthy to set a high price for the purchase of the Bayán
and to spend one’s wealth in the purchase thereof.

Vahíd IV

The fourth Vahíd is 92 pages long and it completes the second volume of the Bayán it is French
translation by Nicolas. In this Vahíd the fundamental themes established in the first three Vahíds are
reiterated and new laws are ordained, new symbols are introduced and old symbols unveiled.
The first báb begins with the disclosure of the twofold nature of the Manifestation of God—one aspect of
which speaks on the part of God, while the other part is the most submissive slave of God who adores Him
night and day. All that descends in verses originates from the first rank, is pure and unassailable by men.
The significance of anything in the Writings of God does not become manifest until He wills it so, and
hence at times a verse will remain obscure from the beginning of the Manifestation until a later time. The
rarity of believers who are the first to recognize the Manifestation is noted, along with the insignificant
rank of the appearances of the attributes of God in comparison with the Manifestation of God Himself.
True faith is in seeing the the sign of God alone in the Manifestation of God, and the perfect
manifestation of the attributes of God in the Manifestations of God. All created things reflect God to some
degree. The Creator is in contact with His creation through the Manifestation of God alone. The
Absolute Manifestation of God is in Him Whom God shall make manifest. He reiterates His explanation for the
meaning of syrat, the BRIDGE. All of the above are themes which are found in this báb. The Syrat is the
BRIDGE of understanding between the worlds of Creation and Deity. It is the Sea of the Will of God, it is
the twofold nature of the Manifestation of God, and it is narrow indeed but nevertheless it is the only link
between the created and the Uncreated. Because of the narrowness of the BRIDGE, the names of God
were not explained in the previous Manifestations, nor were the appearances of Unity Who are the
Manifestations of God. Hence it is yet another reference to the reality of the Manifestation of God.
The second báb of the fourth Vahíd emphasizes that acceptance of the Manifestation is inseparable from
acceptance of God. He states that those who oppose Him Whom God shall make manifest will do so because
they sincerely believe that in doing so they are fulfilling the Will of God.
The third báb introduces several terms which are preserved by Nicolas in their original Arabic: BIDA’,
DHIKIR, TASBIH, TAHAMID, TAHALIL and TAKBIR. Nicolas explains that BIDA’ refers to the
new creation in every Dispensation. The Essence of God is unchanging whereas His creation is constantly
changing. FIRST is applied to the Essence of God, which came before all things, the Primal Will which is
the first DHIKR and the first creature, the first Fire. There are four columns to reality, and these are
TASBIH, TAHAMID, TAHALIL, and TAKBIR –all of these are names whereby God is praised and
each one corresponds with one of the four elements: TASBIH with air, TAHAMID with fire, TAHALIL
with water, and TAKBIR with earth. Everything ordained by the BIDA’ of God remains unaltered until
the Day of Judgment which follows the ascension of His Manifestation. Not to be cognizant of the BIDA’
of God is the greatest of all sins for it deprives the believer of the knowledge of the origin of the Word of

God. What is worth more than the construction of many venerable edifices for the worship of God is to be
worthy of mention by the Manifestation of God in His Day in His Writings.
The fourth báb again affirms that faith is made conditional upon the acceptance of the latest
Manifestation of God, and that all believers are slaves of God. The spirits of all things return to the human
form and the Paradise of all things is in the human Paradise. In Muhammad’s time, the people in His
place of residence were so blind to His station that for either seven or nine years nobody would believe in
Him.

The Báb proclaims the fifth báb to be the same as the fourth báb. In it He prescribes the laws governing
various acts—violence, marriage, rulership, punishments, holy war and the like. If God does not allow the
union of His slaves under certain conditions then they are sanctioned if they disobey His Will. He has
forbidden the union of believers and non-believers in marriage. He prohibits the murder of anyone by His
followers, revealed that only God has the right to give and take life, and punishing this act on the part of
the believer with his excommunication from the religion of the Bayán; even if the believer allows the
thought of murder to enter into his heart, he leaves the religion of God—this is the greatest sin of all.
Kings should prostrate themselves before the Manifestation of God, Who is the Manifestation of the King
of Kings, and they should only rule if He directs them to do so, in which case nobody has the right to
object. There is no greater sin than the sin of harming the Manifestation of God and His believers. The
Báb affirms that His purpose in revealing laws is to protect His followers, not to upset or unduely disturb
anyone. People must not be forced into becoming Bábís, and while the Báb encourages the Bábí ruler to
conquer lands and subdue peoples He disallows the forced conversion of the peoples therein to His Faith.
Most men are not perspicacious and consequently they are attached to the things of this world. If the
believers give them these things they will accept the Faith of God.

The sixth báb is of great interest to the present reader because the Báb explains in this báb many of the
teachings set forth in earlier abwáb in such a manner that they become easier for him to comprehend.
God is not to be judged according to His acts, but His creatures are to be judged according to theirs; no
one has access to God, nothing comes into contact with His Essence; He created His Will which created
everything else; only the Will of God can be seen in the Manifestation, in the Letters of the Living and in
all of the letters which have been generated from them; the true believer sees the Sun in himself, only the
Sun is seen in him, and he follows the Sun wherever It goes; the power of God is manifested in His most
recent Manifestation, His Faith and His “nation”; the path of God revealed in each Dispensation is
endless and eternal in the spiritual worlds, but has an end and changes in the material world; the
Manifestations of God are One and all manifest God; God is the Hidden and the Manifest; those who
know God are in the utmost happiness when the Manifestation is manifest and are miserable and
sorrowful when His appearance is withdrawn; all attributes are created in the shadow of the sovereignty of
the Will and all depnd upon It for their existence—these are some of the salient points made in this báb.

In detailing the subject of will, the Báb reveals that acceptance of the Manifestation of God entails
submission to His Will and sacrifice of personal will. When the believer rejects or acts independently of
Will of the Manifestation, the personal will rules within him and the personal will cannot bring him
happiness so during the period when he is ruled by the personal will he is in the Fire. Actions which are
engaged in for the sake of consciously and deliberately opposing the Will of God or with full knowledge
that the Will of God ordains otherwise have not the strength of a fly. In the Dispensation of Islam all
believers lived according to the Will of God and the only acts which were contrary to that Will were
nevertheless believed to be right and satisfactory by those who engaged in them. There is no power nor
force save in God. Even if a person is seeking the truth and leaves one Faith believing that it contains what
he perceives to be false, in whatever Faith he enlists or if he searches in creation instead of in religion, he
returns to God and is judged according to his actions. The Báb declares that Him Whom God shall make
manifest has a monopoly on God’s power and that it is through His aid that the Báb’s Manifestation is
taking place. He explains that the first Manifestation is made manifest in the last, that all must turn
towards the Manifestation Who is Manifest when He is made manifest for at that time He is the only
exponent of God’s Will and “He doeth whatsoever He willeth and ordaineth whatsoever He desireth”.

The true believer can see all Manifestations in each Manifestation, see the essence of order rather than the
ranks multiplied from it in each Manifestation which are the ranks of the believers. In developing the
theme of the attachment of the true believer to the Manifestation of God, the Báb ompares the love
between human beings to spiritual love and the love of hearts. Human love is unquestionably inferior to
spiritual love nd the latter is likewise inferior to the love of the heart. He discusses the various progressive
stages of love and the fewnes of those who attain to the love of God. He defines these as the ones who are
joyful because of their works in the path of God, independent of the conditions of this fleeting world and
who recognize that God has not ordained perpetual happiness for His creatures, for whom the pain and
sorrow of separation from the Manifestation of God s more delicious than any earthly happiness. He calls
upon His followers to look at the fruit of His Revelation and of all Revelations, that they may discern the
truth:

> “The fruit of the Bayán is this: that you recognize the Point of Truth at the moment of His
> Manifestation, for, in knowing Him, you will know all that is good; and that you will not remain in
> obscurity for (otherwise) all good is forbidden to you.”34

In the seventh báb the Báb re-reveals the process of divine creation through the Primal Will, and He states
that God begins all things in one Manifestation and ends them and begins them anew in the next
Manifestation and that this cycle of creation is eternal.

The eighth báb elucidates the theme of the creative power of the verses of God. By these verses God
creates, nourishes, gives life and bestows death upon all things. All things return to the human order which
is created of four signs: 1)the verse of creation which is his heart; 2)the verses of nourishment which is his
spirit; 3)the verse of death which is his being; 4)the verse of life which is his body. All things are manifested

by these signs and these signs are manifested by the 19 appearances of affirmation and the 19 appearances
of negation. Everything which creates or nourishes or gives life or death in persuance of the Will of God is
acting for God and therefore it is God Who is committing these acts Everything which is not done in the
name of God or in persuance of His Will cannot be ascribed to Him and is caused by the unbelievers. The
glass of water of a follower of the Báb is worth more than everything that the unbelievers can do in this
world, be it even in the highest degree of love. The Báb closes this báb with the affirmation that it is better
to comprehend one of the ranks of the new Manifestation than to know all of the ranks of the previous
Manifestation. He counsels His followers to wait attentively for the appearance of Him Whom God shall make
manifest.

The ninth báb is concerned with the behavior of the kings or nobles who become Bábís—those who
become believers will be richly recompensed. The Báb reveals that although it is possible to enumerate the
man monarchs registered in the Faith of Islam from the time of the appearance of Muhammad to the
declaration of Himself, not one soul among them followed word for word the Faith of Islam in his heart
and in his deeds. The king who becomes a Bábí will be assisted by the power of God and he will conquer
all of the nations and he will not have to take from the believers the value of a grain of mustard seed.

The tenth báb asserts that the standard and proof of all knowledge and learning is the Book of God, which
is the Bayán in His Dispensation. The purpose of the knowledge of sciences (including the sciences of
numbers, grammar, logic, jurisprudence, religious proofs, etymology, syntax, and archaic words) is to
understand the revealed verses of God and thus the Will of God for man. When a new Manifestation of
God appears the old sciences devised by men to understand the previous Manifestation are no longer
serviceable, unless He declares them to be of service, and everything that is manifested in the new
Revelation is clear to the true believer, independent of all past sciences. The Báb therefore prohibits the
writing of books on the sciences of religious proofs, logic, theology and philosophy, archais words,
etymology and syntax. He further prohibits instruction from books other than His Writings unless they
have been written in conformity with the scienceof the Bayán in all of its degrees, concerning the
knowledge of God and the first and final causes of existence. Consequently, it is forbidden to Bábís to
teach the old sciences which have been referred to by name in this báb, although instruction in other
sciences is permitted, including mathematics, astronomy, physiology, medicine and so forth, that is non-
theological and non-linguistic sciences. A writer is permitted to quote from the Writings of the Báb in the
course of writing his book but only if he believes in the Báb. God will not forgive the man who occupies
himself exclusively with these old sciences. For those who believe, the Book of God is sufficient—the
Bayán is clear enough as it stands and is in need of no explanations or commentaries. The Báb claims that
He is capable of writing the equivalent of the Qur’án in two days and two nights, and that if all mankind
were to unite they would not have the power to unravel a single verse thereof, much less produce one like
it. The verses of Gd cannot be compared with the verses of men.

Most of the teachings of the eleventh báb are familiar to the reader by now: the Bayán as the law of God
for all mankind in the Dispensation of the Báb, according to which all men will be judged; the
independence of Him Whom God shall make manifest from the law revealed by the Báb; the inseparability of
belief in God, the Primal Will and the Manifestation of God; the necessity of believing in the current
Manifestation of God (as well as in all previous Manifestations of God) in order to be accounted a true
believer in God; the true succession to Muhammad by the twelve Imams of Ithna ‘Ashari Shi’i Islam. He
makes another reference in this báb to the “splendor of God” (Bahá’u’lláh) in connection with Him Whom
God shall make manifest; He asserts that Jesus Christ foretold the appearance of Muhammad with these
words “After Me will come He Whose name shall be Ahmad”35; and He declares that whoever makes a
believer happy makes the Manifestation of God happy, and whoever makes the Manifestation of God
happy satisfies God. The concluding verses of the eleventh báb maintain that the objective of God in
revealing the Bayán is that each reader may harvest the fruit of His Revelation for himself.

In the twelfth báb He again asserts the progressiveness of Revelation, the innate knowledge and the
independence of human learning with which all of the Manifestations of God have been endowed, and the
eternality of the religion of God—for which there will never be a last Manifestation. God abrogates old
laws in each new Dispensation and substitutes greater and more elevated laws in their place. It is the
Word of God and His command which makes sacred whatever it touches. In every Dispensation the
Word of God decrees certain places as holy and abrogates the holy places of the previous Dispensation. In
this báb the Báb revokes the “holiness” of the Faith of Islam, forbidding pilgrimages to Mecca and
Medina and to all other Muslim shrines.

In the thirteenth báb He ordains the preservation of the holy places of Islam, perhaps as historical
monuments rather than as places of pilgrimage, and decrees that the money collectedin these places be
spent for their benefit and upkeep.

The fourteenth báb designates the shrines of the Faith of the Báb—the places of the birth and death of
each one of the Letters of the Living, of the Báb and of the eighteen disciples whom He chose. Asylum
must be granted to anyone who seeks it in the places associated with the Letters of the Living. It is
praiseworthy to make a pilgrimage to and pray in the shrines He has established, but it will not save the
believer from the chastisement of God if he does not accept Him Whom God shall make manifest in His Day.
Those who oppose Him Whom God shall make manifest will do so because they cleave to the forms of religion
without attending to the spirit thereof, which is the image of God made manifest in His Manifestation.
The Báb teaches the Golden Rule to His followers, intending that thereby Him Whom God shall make
manifest will not be attacked or harmed by Bábís even if they should not accept Him. The time of the
appearance of Him Whom God shall make manifest will be the Great Day of Judgment, when all human

beings who have ever existed will be judged according to the Will of God. It appears that this Day of
Judgment is distinguished from that which takes place in each new Dispensation during the lifetime of the
new Manifestation.

The fifteenth báb underlines the right of anyone to seek asylum in the holy places, and forbids anyone
from interfering with his exercise of that right. In fact, out of respect for God and the holiness of God
commemorated in these holy places, asylum will be accorded anyone who seeks it though he may be far
away from the actual shrines.

The Báb explains the purpose for having holy places in the sixteenth báb. There is no and never will be a
fixed abode for God. Nor is there a fixed abode for the Manifestation of God (other than the Primal Will
from which each Manifestation is made manifest), for each one appears in a different place and veneration
is accorded that place, which changes with each Manifestation. Men circle around the Manifestation of
God while He is in this world, and when He leaves this world they circle around the place designated by
Him for this purpose, it being symbolic of their circumambulation of Him. The purpose of pilgrimage is to
draw closer to God and to recognize Him in His successive Manifestations. It is of no benefit to men for
them to make pilgrimages to holy places and then fail to recognize the Manifestation of God when He
appears. The Báb dwells on the importance of acting properly towards one’s fellow believers while on
pilgrimage, citing the misconduct of some of His fellow pilgrims on His pilgrimage to Mecca in 1844,
asserting that the hearts of believers are closer to God than any place of dust (including by allusion Mecca
and Medina), condemning disputes, discourtesy, selfishness and calling all pilgrims to observe knowledge,
patience, resignation and modesty. He who makes the pilgrimage in the right manner will be forgiven his
sins. The Báb ordains that believers do not have to make pilgrimage if they are separated from the place
of pilgrimage by an ocean or some other major body of water; He also permits the believer to give
whatever means he would need to make his pilgrimage to another believer and thereby fulfill his
obligation by proxy. The Báb means to spare His followersthe torment of a sea voyage (where were real
enough during His lifetime and in the part of the world which He frequented). God gives double the
reward for every good deed wrought by a believer who works on the sea, because of the greater difficulty
with which he lives his life in comparison with the believer who lives on the land. In this báb the Báb calls
for the establishment of a universal rapid mail and news service to be established by His followers similar
to that which existed in European countries. By means of this service, all people would be able to know
what was happening all over the world a few days instead of months after it occurred. The purpose of this
service is that all may hear about the appearance of Him Whom God shall make manifest soon after His
declaration and that all may have the honor of being one of the first believers in Him.

The seventeenth báb affirms that the possessor of all things is God, and that God has a greater right to any
and all properties than does anyone other than Himself. Buildings built for the worship of God must
superceed the normal laws which regulate the ownership of property. It is not permitted to sell lands

immediately adjacent to the House of God (that is, to buildings reserved for the worship of God); if
beautiful dependencies to the House of God are to be erected then the lands which are adjacent to this
House may be seized by right of eminent domain for that purpose.

The last two abwáb of the fourth Vahíd treat the details of pilgrimage during the Dispensation of the Báb.
In the course of the eighteenth báb, pilgrimage is reaffirmed as the circumambulation of the House of
God symbolizing the Manifestation of God; that when the Manifestation of God Himself appears all must
circle around Him and not around buildings; that only those who can make the pilgrimage without
hardship are permitted and encouraged to do so; that the Writings of Him Whom God shall make manifest are
the best proof of the truth of His mission. Pilgrims should give four mithqáls36 of gold to the four columns
of the House of God to be collected and divided annually by and among the 19 servants who attend to
that House; slaves, children, servants, those who have been robbed while on pilgrimage or who are
poverty-stricken are exempted from this obligation. Pilgrimage is required only once during one’s life.
Women are not required to make pilgrimage. All three of these ordinances remove hardships from
pilgrimage for those who undertake it and eliminate the requirement to make pilgrimage for those who
would be hard-tried by its attendant difficulties. It is forbidden to buy a pilgrimage for a dead person. It is
each individual’s responsibility, if he is able, to make the pilgrimage during his lifetime—seeing the
Manifestation of God for himself when He is living, and visiting the place associated with Him when He
has passed on. The purpose of the pilgrimage is to prepare the pilgrim for the recognition of Him Whom
God shall make manifest—when He declares Himself, all must turn to Him for He is the House of God. The
Báb reveals that,

> “In every era there have been blessed beings as guardians of His House who look into the science
> of the intimate of the intimate.”37

In a footnote to this verse, Nicolas explains that there are three degrees of science or knowledge according
to Shi’i theologians, the highest being the science of the intimate of the intimate, which is understood only
by the Tree of Truth which is the Manifestation of God. We encounter this mysterious verse:

> “And on this fourth column (the Letters of the Living—the abwáb) has passed, in days and nights,
> the number of eight Vahíds.”38

According to Nicolas, this is the verse which Bahá’u’lláh applies to His own Manifestation, having
translated it in the following fashion:

“And in the ninth year thou shalt be in the presence of thy Lord.”39

The Báb reveals three truths for the first time in this báb which are vital to our understanding of His
teaching on progressive revelation and the attributes of the true believer. He warns His followers not to be
alienated from Him Whom God shall make manifest on account of that Manifestation’s teachings nor to be
kept back from recognizing Him because of a lack of popular drift in His direction, or, in other words, for
lack of companions in belief. He also affirms that whereas those who have been informed of the

Revelation of God are obligated to respond to that Revelation with justice, this requirement does not hold
for those who are ignorant of the Revelation. Finally, He proclaims that:

> “The manifestion (Him Whom God shall make manifest) will take place in such rank that you (the
> believers in the Báb) will be able to be convinced of its truth for the proof will be perfect for you
> and for the others; God is the best of those who ordain.”40

The nineteenth báb of the fourth Vahíd gives permission for women who live in Shíráz or in the vicinity
of this town which the Báb has made the foremost place of pilgrimage of His Dispensation to make the
pilgrimage by circumambulating a circle of 19 women seated on chairs during the night, chanting prayers
and then returning to their homes; women are required to give four mithqáls of gold once in a lifetime a
part of the pilgrimage although they may make the pilgrimage many times. Pilgrimage is not important
for women though. The Báb reveals the following:

> “That which for them is the very capital of their proximity to God, is the contentment of their
> husbands and the love of their children. For each one of them, all that she can testfy to her
> children of mercy, nd of solicitude beyond that which is her duty is greater than any obedience to
> the Intermediary by Whom she searches to come closer to God.”41

He further asserts that God has ordained that parents be loving to their children and children of their
parents and of each other, and this is because all were created, nourished, given life and death for the One
Person Who is the Manifestation of God, in the Báb’s Dispensation, Him Whom God shall make manifest, and
the Manifestation is the Sign of the Unity of God. Love creates Unity and Unity creates Love.

Vahíd V

The fifth Vahíd contains many new ordinances and teachings not found in earlier Vahíds.
The first báb reveals the nature of the mosque, which is the House of God around which the believers
circle when the Manifestation of God has repaired to the spiritual worlds.
The second báb stipulates that 18 mosques should be built, each in honor of one of the Letters of the
Living; in each of these mosques there should be as many lights as possible, even 2001 or more lamps so
that these mosques will like up like the stars of the firmament. He proclaims that mosques are built
according to the command of God which is revealed in His verses. He warns the Bábís not to be blind to
the meaning of pilgrimage, to the knowledge of where it leads and the reason for its existence. He
furthermore warns them that prayer and remembrance of the Letters of the Living are meaningless, nay,
harmful if the believer rejects the Manifestation of God (Him Whom God shall make manifest) when He

appears and if He and His Letters are forbidden to enter the mosques ordained by the previous
Manifestation (the Báb)…for in this case such “worship” reveals the “believer” to be a hypocrite and
spiritually blind. The Muslims, He asserts, are guilty of both of these transgressions, having not only
rejected the Báb and His Letters but also forbidden them entry to the mosques ordained by Muhammad
in the Qur’án. Pilgrimage to the House of God has always existed in the past and will exist always in the
future, in the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest.
The third báb is concerned with the calendar revealed by the Báb, which is composed of 361 days of 19
months each having 19 days. The first month of this year is called Bahá’ and the last is called A‘la. Hence
the month that directly preceeds the beginning of the new year bears one of the names of the Báb, Who
called Himself Nuqt-i-A’la, the Point of the Highest. The entire religion of the Bayán is based upon the
number of Unity (of the Unity of God) which is 19. The meanings of the months are revealed as follows:
the first three months are of the fire, and in them the creation of the fire of the love of God took place in
the hearts of contingent beings; the following four months are of eternal love, and in them the creation of
the spirits of all beings and the nourishment of God bestowed upon these beings were manifested; the next
six months are of the Unity of God, and in them God made the creatures die of spiritual negation; and the
last six months which are of the earth witness God giving life to those who love only Him and are firm in
His love. He asserts that all creatures are “multiplications of unity by unity”42, hence, 19 times 19. All
things are generated from the Unity of God. The Báb writes that the first month of the calendar is the
month of the Point (that is, the Manifestation of God, for Moses is called the Point of the Torah, Jesus the
Point of the Gospels, Muhammad the Point of the Qur’án even as the Báb calls Himself the Point of the
Bayán) and all the other 18 months revolve around this Point. The same is true of the names of the days of
the month:

> “God called it the month of Bahá’ because the luminosity of all the months is found in Him. This
> first month, He fixed it for Him Whom God shall make manifest, and each of the days of this month He
> fixed for one of the Letters of the Unity.”43

The first day of the new year, which is the first day of Bahá’ is called NawRuz, a Persian appelation
meaning “New Day”. Whoever is constant on this day and who recites the formula of the Unity of God
361 times will be protected by Gd for the entire year. This, the Báb writes, is not revealed in order to
glorify this day but rather to admonish the believers to glorify and humble themselves before God and
before His Manifestation.
The fourth báb ordains that children be named according to the names of God, so that in the day of the
appearance of Him Whom God shall make manifest all may have names pleasing to Gd. Men and women
should be named according to the names of God, and also those of Muhammad, of ‘Alí, of Fatima, of ‘Alí
Muhammad, of Muhammad ‘Alí, of Hasan and Husayn. Apart from the names of
God, the best names are the conjunctions of ‘Alí and Muhammad. “The fruit of this order,” writes the
Báb in reference to naming children by the names of God, “is that, each time that one pronounces these

names, one is reminded of the Master of these names.”44 Being named by a name of God does not make
the bad man good however. The rest of the fourth báb is devoted to two themes: the value of all things is
determined according to the spirit of man; and the essence of the religion of God. As to the first of these
themes, all things are related to the spirit of man—if a believer sits upon the earth the spirit of the earth is
happy; if an unbeliever sits upon the earth the spirit thereof is unhappy and only God knows how much.
The perfection of each existence is in belief in God, in each Manifestation of God, and in whatever that
Manifestation reveals. Nothing can arrive at its “Paradise” without having manifested the highest degree
of perfection of which it is capable. The second theme, the essence of religion is expressed in these terms:

> “True knowledge is the knowledge of God and this is naught but the knowledge of His
> Manifestation in each Manifestation: wealth is but poverty in relation to Him, it consists in having
> need of nothing besides Him. This knowledge is made manifest only through the Intermediary of
> the vision of the Manifestation of He Who is the Manifested.”45

The final theme of this báb is that the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest is the touchstone46
of true faith.

In the fifth báb the Báb treats the importance of the propagation of the Faith of God. He declares that it
was the Will of God that Islam be spread throughout the world and that the reality that is was not spread
everywhere is due not to the impotence of God or of His Messenger Muhammad, but to the weakness of
the Muslims. He expressed the sincere desire that all the peoples of the world become Bábís during His
Dispensation so that all would recognize Him Whom God shall make manifest when He appears. Every human
being and every thing should adhere to the Faith of God in the time of every Manifestation, for those who
do not will be condemned to the fire of unbelief eternally unless they repent and become believers.
Nobody has the right to breathe without giving his faith to the Manifestation of God. To the kings and
sovereigns who are believers (but not to individual believers who are their subjects) God has given the duty
to appropriate the property of non-believers and otherwise induce them to become believers so that they
will be saved from the fire of unbelief. In referring to the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest
the Báb writes:

> “Be attentive to yourselves, for all religion consists of coming to His aid (that of the Manifestation)
> and not in religious acts, which were revealed in the Bayán: and this at the moment of His
> Manifestation. For, before His Manifestation, whoever turns away from the Bayán’s laws, be it the
> width of a grain of barley, he is turned away from Him.”47

The sixth báb reveals the laws and principles governing the use and sale and distribution of property as
well as the spiritual meanings of these laws and principles. As we have heard before, during the lifetime of
the Manifestation of God, He is the rightful proprietor of all goods and all things must be turned over to
Him for His decision. After His passing, all transactions must take place according to the Book of God.
Hence, all transactions not done with His permission are illegal and illicit. The Báb reveals the proper

manner for Bábí sovereigns to divide the spoils of conquest among the various ranks of Bábís. These ranks
are determined according to the capacity and closeness of each believer to God.

The seventh báb permits believers to do commerce with unbelievers and decrees that while all things in
the possession of unbelievers are impure, when they come into the possession of believers they
immediately become pure. All good things, He asserts should be owned by the Bábís so that they can offer
these things to Him Whom God shall make manifest when He appears. The Báb repeats the teaching that the
attributes of God (such as His purity) can not be compared to the attributes of His creatures, and that,
moreover, God is exalted above all attributes.

The eighth báb makes it obligatory for all Bábís who can read to peruse at least 19 verses of the Bayán
every day, and permits them to read as many verses as please them, to plunge into the sea of His verses so
that they may find the pearls hidden therein. Illiterate Bábís are obliged to repeat the following verse 19
times a day in lieu of reading the verses: “It is God Who is my Lord, and I give nobody partnership with
God.”48 He affirms the superiority of the verses of Him Whom God shall make manifest to His verses and
indicates that the origin, inspiration and purpose of the Bayán is this same Manifestation of God:

> “I bear witness by the Eternal and Blessed Essence that if in the Day of the manifestation of Him
> Whom God shall make manifest someone hears one of His verses and repeats it, this is better for him
> than to repeat the Bayán a thousand times.”49

He reminds the Bábís that the seemingly best and most knowledgeable among the believers is accounted
among the negators of the religion of God if he does not accept the new Manifestation of God.

The ninth báb ordains that before using anything, all believers must make mention of one of the names of
God either in his heart (silently) or openly (out loud). If he is unable to do so, then he must recite the
formula “In the name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Holy”. The purpose of this commandment is
that the believer will realize that everything is an expression of the Will of God, that all things are mirrors
reflecting Him Whom God shall make manifest and that without Him they could not exist.

The tenth báb reveals the inseparability of the action of anything and its existence-the fire and its action of
burning, the lamp and its action of lighting, God and His actions of creating, destroying, nourishing and
so forth. The Báb requires all male Bábís to write in the interior and exterior of a five-pointed star
(pentagram or pentacle) and all female Bábís to write in five concentric circles. Presumably what they are
enjoined to write are the verses revealed by the Báb.

In the eleventh báb the Báb reminds His followers that every one of His orders is a gift offered to Him
Whom God shall make manifest; and that those who accept the Manifestation of God in His Day are a rare as
red sulphur. He reveals a prayer to be said over the newborn bábe and for the dead. The purpose of
reciting the former is that the bábe may recognize Him Whom God shall make manifest should he live to see
the Day of Judgment in which He will be made manifest. The Báb attributes the dissidences which have
divided the believers in each Manifestation to the unfaithfulness of certain of these believers in relation to
the Manifestation, this being a particular problem after the passing of the Manifestation. He asserts that
most people become believers onlhy when they perceive that this course of action is popular. He identifies
the Book of God as the CORD whereby men may make spiritual progress if they fear God.

The twelfth and thirteenth abwáb go into further detail concerning death, burial, and the writing of a final
will and testament. The twelfth báb reveals the intimate connection between the inner nature (also called
the intimate body) and the visible body: everything which pertains to the one pertains to the other.
Suffering in the visible body causes the intimate body to suffer. A ring with an inscription is to be placed
on the finger of the visible body of the deceased when this body is buried in a crystal casket in order to
protect it from danger. The body should be placed in the highest form of mineral which is stone, and, if
possible, the most perfect stone which is crystal.

The thirteenth báb requires every believer when close to death to write a will and testament according to
the rules ordained in the Bayán. In this testament he must declare his belief in God, in the Báb, in the
Letters of the Living and other aspects of his faith. This testament must be written in the most beautiful
handwriting possible and it must be preserved carefully by each generation into whose hands it is
entrusted until Him Whom God shall make manifest makes His appearance, when it should be given to Him so
that He may respond to this testament if He wishes to do so. The Báb cautions His followers to make their
declarations with perspicacity that they might derive the just benefits therefrom. Furthermore, He warns
against outward faith which is blind and ignorant of the living truth and He identifies PERSPICACITY as
an attribute of every true believer. The purpose of writing a will and testament is Him Whom God shall make
manifest.

The fourteenth báb is concerned with the redefinition of the meaning of purity in the new Dispensation of
God. Purity is derived not from anything in itself, but from the Tree of the Origin of the Order of God,
which has willed it to be pure. In other words, all things are intermediaries of purity, not sources thereof:

> “The images that purify are: 1)belief in the Bayán, which purifies the body of the believer; 2)the
> Book of God...; 3)the name of God..; 4)the rupture of the association of a thing with an unbeliever
and the commencement of the association of this thing with believer; 5)the Tree of Truth in the

> Day of its manifestation and all that depends upon Him; 6)the four elements; 7)the sun; 8)that
> which changes in nature: all that, on condition that the object to purify is not essentially impure.”50

The Báb further asserts that “Nothing in the Bayán is more beloved of God than neatness, purity and
cleanliness.”51 The purpose of purity is to bring happiness to all, to prevent any disgust for another to
develop, particularly if that one is a stranger. He affirms that He is changing the laws of purity as they are
followed by Muslims, and that obedience to these new laws is only worthwhile if one recognizes the station
of Him Whom God shall make manifest.

In the fifteenth báb sperm [semen] is revealed to be pure in the eye of God; God loves it when the believer
is perfectly clean and when this is easily accomplished and not difficult; that if a believer call another
believer impure, he himself becomes an unbeliever; that impurity is not communicated from one person to
another as the Muslims believe, and that this latter teaching is not contained in the Qur’án.

The sixteenth báb is given over more predominantly to teachings than to laws. The laws are as follows:
believers must give 19 percent of what they own to Him Whom God shall make manifest as well as all things
which they possess which are without omparison (which are unique) unless they are too poor to do so—for
He is the rightful possessor of all things during His lifetime. He reveals that whoever obeys the Bayán is a
believer, and each according to the degree of his obedience. Nobody has the right to tell anyone that he is
not a believer—if he does so then he must pay a fine to Him Whom God shall make manifest. He must likewise
pay a fine if he does not give whatever he possesses which is unique to Him Whom God shall make manifest.
“The greatest thing that God loves among the Bayánis and which manifests itself among them, is their
mutual love of one another.”52 Progressive revelation is masterfully depicted in the following passage:

> “At the moment of the manifestation of the Prophet of God53, the Testimony of God was perfect
> for the people of the Evangel, and that which was promised them was manifested with the
> Testimony of their religion. But, as they (the Christians) remained in obscurity, their works were
> rendered in vain, as they did not even allow the idea that He Who was promised by Jesus could
> have come without their immediately believing in Him to penetrate into their hearts—and
> nevertheless, it is evident that He returned. It is thus in [the case of] every Manifestation of God—
> the nation of the preceeding Manifestation, intending to be scrupulous and attentive to their
> religion, remain in ignorance of his very religion.”54

The seventeenth báb reveals ordinances regulating prayer. Each believer must recite one of the names of
God 95 times every day of the year. The first day of the month of 19 days he must recite “Allah’u’Abha”,
the second day he must recite “Allah’u’A’zam”, the third through the nineteenth days he must recite
“Allah’u’Aqdam”. Throughthe recitation of these names the believer may draw closer to God, for in them
can be seen nothing but God. Likewise, in the Letters of the Living one can see nothing but God, but

neither the names nor the Letters are God, but rather are they the mirrors of His Reality. Later in the báb
it is revealed that other names of God may be recited in place of these particular ones, but in any case
they must be recited 95 times in between sunrise and sunset.

Regulations guiding commercial relations are revealed in the eighteenth báb. There must be a contract
between the salesman and the buyer, and a sale is only legal when both parties agree to it, although this
agreement does not have to be written down. Those who engage in commerce are entitled to make a
profit, and likewise those who lend money are permitted to charge interest, but they must be aware of and
inspired by the benevolence and mercy of God in these matters.

The nineteenth báb reveals various laws related to money matters. A person who accumulates a certain
amount of money must pay a percentage of this amount to the sovereign of his land if that sovereign is just
and if he is a believer. Every year that he accumulates this amount of property he must give a fixed
amount to the king. This law is ordained in the Bayán and it must be followed by all believers but the
sovereign cannot enforce it. This money is given to the sovereign so that he can come to the aid of Him
Whom God shall make manifest when He manifests Himself. In persuance of this theme of enjoined by
voluntary giving, the Báb writes as follows:

> “In the Bayán, no adoration is more agreable to God than the profit which one person voluntarily
> visits upon another, even if this profit takes no other form than contentment which he causes to
> penetrate the other’s heart. No act is further distant from God than the damage visited upon
> someone by another, be this damage but the sentiment of sorrow.”55

The greatest Paradise is to be found in acts of obedience to the Bayán, the greatest Fire in going beyond
the limits of the Bayán, and by doing “violence to someone even if this violence is only of a weight of a
mustard seed.”56 In this báb, the value of the weights and measures used by the Iranians is changed, with
a new system made up of units of 19 and the multiple thereof. The Báb stipulates that those who owe
debts previous to this change of system are obligated to pay back those debts according to the old system.
The concluding statement of this báb is to the effect that God will separate the good from the evil in the
Day of Judgment.

Vahíd VI
The sixth Vahíd begins with a first báb that gives exposition to the proper organization, the real meaning,
the extent, the speed of revelation and the epochal nature of the Báb’s Writings. All of these Writings are
denoted Bayán, meaning “Exposition”. The Báb ordains that His Writings be assembled into 19 volumes,
with abwáb of between one and 2001 verses each, the first three volumes to be given over to verses [ayat],

the next four to sermons [khutba], followed by six volumes of commentaries [tafsir], and six of scientific
questions [‘ilm]. Each believer (who is literate) must have a book of 1000 verses from which to read every
day. The Báb reveals that the name of Bayán applies to the verses first, for they are the most sublime
testimonies of the Manifestation of God; second to the sermons, third to the commentaries, fourth to the
scientific questions, and fifth to those composed in Persian. Nevertheless, as all have descended from God,
all are verses. He warns His followers to be attentive, to realize that God is unknowable by any means and
that Him Whom God shall make manifest is the Sovereign Lord Whom they must recognize in order to be
saved from the Fire of unbelief. “In effect, all of the Bayán and the spirits attached to it are like a garden in
the palm of hand of Him Whom God shall make manifest.”57 Through a spiritual act, the Manifestation of God
gives life to believers, and annihilates unbelievers.

The Báb cautions Bábís not to use the verses of the Bayán to argue against the claims of Him Whom God
shall make manifest58 and He further maintains that science is only fruitful if the scientist is informed of the
knowledge of God.59 “Knowledge is the knowledge of God, of His Prophet, of the images of His order and
of His law. To nothing else is the word knowledge applied by intelligent people.”60 In this báb the Báb
reveals the number of words in a divinely-revealed verse, that is, a line of metrical writing. “Every 30
letters form one line, which, with the accents forms 40 words.”61 He calls upon the true believer to read all
of His Writings, from the first to the last, so that he might perceive their evolution from conformity to
Qur’ánic law to conformity to Bayánic law. All of His Writings are “the utterance of the Point of
Truth…But the divine purpose is more evident in the most recent verses.”62 He affirms that the path of
God is straight and narrow, and that Bayánis must not fix their attention upon the Bayán to such an
extentthat they fail to recognize the Manifestation of the Revealer of the Bayán in Him Whom God shall
make manifest.
The second báb of the sixth Vahíd explains the purifying qualities of water, their origin and the conditions
under which they become manifest. Water is pure because it is given purity by the Word of God. It can
purify other things if it has not changed in color, odor and taste, and this applies as much to small as to
large quantities of water. Purity is as easily derived from a cup as from a river of water, and the drop of
water demonstrates the purity of God as much as the entire sea Every house must be equiped with a basin
where water may be kept to purify and cleanse the inhabitants. What is most important though is not
physical purity, but “purification of the essential body by the water of Unity.”63 The “water of Unity” is
belief in the most recent Manifestation of God. Whereas the Europeans are scrupulously clean of body,
they are spiritually impure ecause they do not believe in the most recent Manifestation of God. He warns
Bábís not to pollute water by dipping things into it to make them pure and thereby rendering it disgusting
and impure. His stated purpose is that believers may not disgust one another and Him Whom God shall make
manifest. Consequently, the maintenance of the perfect purity of water is accounted the most precious thing
in the eyes of God.
The third báb ordains that a bath be built in every village so that in every place the believer goes he may
purify himself. The Báb asserts that the order of purity is more precise and exacting than in any previous
Dispensation. Perfection is not required in matters of cleanliness alone: everyone must do the most perfect
work of which he is capable. By aspiring to perfection in all things the believer may be a cause of torment
to no one. The Báb calls upon His followers to recognize and obey Him Whom God shall make manifest
immediately after they hear the announcement of His appearance. Alluding to the time of His
manifestation, the Báb writes:

> “In the day of the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, God knows at what age He
> will manifest Him. Be attentive that from the beginning of the manifestation to the number 19, in
> every year, you give your faith to the letter of life in such manner that one may not lay claim to the
> fruits of the previous manifestation if it is not by means of the subsequent manifestation.”64
The fourth báb directs that the five regions of the earth be reserved exclusively for the residence of Bábís,
these being: 1)Fars; 2)the two ‘Iraqs; 3)Adhirbayjan; 4)Khurasan; 5)Mazindaran. He indicates that “God
knows from which side of these places the Sun of Reality will arise.”65 It is better, He asserts, to breathe
once in one of these five lands than to adore God for 10,000 years in some other land. He again reveals
that there is no other true knowledge apart from the knowledge of God, and that attainment to this
knowledge is what separates the believer from the unbeliever.

In the fifth báb He ordains the specific greetings that female believers are to use with one another and
with male believers, and that male believers are to use with one another and with female believers. In
greeting each other, women believers must say “Allah’u’Abha” and respond with “Allah’u’Ajmal” and
men believers must say “Allah’u’Akbar” and respond with “Allah’u’A’zam”. The purpose of this is that
believers may have faith in Him Whom God shall make manifest when He appears by having affirmed in their
greetings to one another that it is He Who renews the garments of sublimity, elevation, luminosity and
perfect beauty made mention of in these greetings. He again explains the purpose of religion which is to
prepare the believer to accept the successive Manifestations of God, and states that all the Manifestations
of God have been persecuted by the believers in former Dispensations and that this has occurred in His
Day and will take place in the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest.

The sixth báb calls for the effacing of all books except those written in the Dispensation of the Báb. He
reveals that the Books of former Dispensations have been annulled by the Book of each succeeding
Dispensation, and that all who continue to believe in the old Books are unbelievers. This is even more true
of books which are man-made, which are reflections of the superceded Book of God. Hence, “in the Day

of the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest” to recite one verse from among His verses is
more elevated than to read the entire Bayán and that which emanates from the Bayán.”66

The seventh báb sets forth the conditions which must govern the institution of marriage among believers
in the Báb. The male spouse must give the female a dowry. This dowry is to be of mithqáls of gold if the
believer is a city dweller and mithqáls of silver if a country dweller. The dowry should be composed of no
less than 19 mithqáls and no greater than 95 mithqáls, and if between the two then preferably in
increments of 19. Both the male and femail partner must be agreable to the marriage and must each recite
a specific verse which has the meaning of “for God”. The two parties must sign an affidavid that bears
witness to their intention, and if possible they should receive the permission of both sets of parents—this is
however not required. Wedding gifts are permitted, from the bride to the groom, the groom to the bride,
and from family and friends to the married couple. If the dowry is not paid the marriage cannot take
place. Fundamental verities are recapitulated in this báb following its expostion of the marriage laws,
including the unchanging Essence of God; belief in God being inseparable from belief in and obedience to
the most recent Manifestation of God; the eternality of the formula of faith—“There is no God but the
[one] God and the Manifestation of God (the most recent one) is His Prophet”. The Báb also refers to the
leadership of the Letters of the Living appointed by every Manifestation of God to guide the believers after
His passing; to the unfaithfulness of believers who do not follow these appointed leaders, such as ‘Alí and
the other eleven Imams in the case of Islam, and the Bábu’l-Báb (Mulla Husayn) and the seventeen other
Letters of the Living in the case of the Bábí Faith; the impossibility of human beings communicating with
God other than through the intermediation of the most recent Manifestation of God. The purpose of God
in sending His Manifestations is that all believers may become united, manifesting thereby the unity of the
Manifestation Who Himself manifests the Unity of God. There is a hierarchy of comprehension according
to the Báb. The simple villager cannot comprehend the Revelation of God so he goes to the village priest
for enlightenment; the priest in turn goes to believers who are higher in rank than himself in order to
attain a more perfect understanding of the Revelation of God. Innumerable veils surround the hearts of
men and consequently the verses of God are of no profit to them for they can not perceive the verses.
When all the veils are removed men become believers instantly. He who believes because of the efforts of
a thousand intermediaries does not understand the verses of God and is therefore incapable of recognizing
His new Manifestation. It is therefore the responsibility of those believers who do understand the verses of
God to guide the blind ones to the recognition of the new Manifestation.

The great crime of the leaders of religion is that they do not really understand the verses of God—they
only appear to do so—and when they fail to recognize the new Manifestation they lead astray those who
follow their leadership. The Báb briefly returns to the subject of marriage to explain that it must be
conducted in the sight of God so that “if a fruit (a child) results, he is for God.”67 He returns to His
consideration of the religion of God stating that even as in Islam the actions are in conformity with the
Will of God if they are “in conformity with the Book of God, with the traces of the Pophet, the guiding
Imams and the conducting abwáb”, so in the Dispensation of the Bayán, actions are in conformity with
the Will of God if they have been ordained or permitted by the Báb while He is alive and by the Bayán
(His Writings as a whole) when He ascends to the spiritual worlds.

The eighth báb of the sixth Vahíd is devoted to a forceful and unequivocable exposition of the greatest
proof of the truth of any Manifestation of God—His revealed verses. He commands His followers to read
this báb once every 19 days and to think about it day and night so that they may remember that the
greatest proof of the Manifestation of God are His verses so that they will be prepared to acknowledge the
truth of Him Whom God shall make manifest. He writes that the Muslims have been veiled from His
Manifestation because they have not believed in the teaching of the Qur’án that only God can send down
verses like the verses of God and that these verses are the greatest proof of the truth of the Manifestation
of God. These Muslims respond to the Báb’s claim to have revealed verses by saying that anyone can
write such verses and that it is impossible for such verses to come from God. The Báb affirms that one
who claims to have revealed the verses of God after the ascension of the Báb is either an impostor or He is
Him Whom God shall make manifest—in both cases Bábís are forbidden to oppose this person, for God will
deal with the liar, and Him Whom God shall make manifest must be obeyed.

The ninth báb permits the use of silk, gold and silver by believers in their vestments and ornamentations,
regardless of the rank of the believer. The poor believer will receive a recompense for his poverty in the
terrestrial world double that of the wealthy believer. “Honor and grandeur do not reside in these things,
but rather in Him Whom God shall make manifest.”68 Closeness to God pleases Him, not the kind of garments
with which one is decked Nonetheless, the believer who has silk garments and silver and gold ornaments
and who does not pride himself on their possession but is submissive to his Lord, that one will be rewarded
and is blessed.

The tenth báb reveals that the most beloved of all ornaments in the Dispensation of the Bayán is a ring of
red corneline upon which is engraved these words: “Say: God is the Truth, and in truth, all else but God
is His creature, and all of us are the lovers of God.”69 For believers, truth is Paradise; for unbelievers, truth
is the Fire. The purpose of this ring and of another ring that is described in this báb is to prepare the
believer for acceptance of Him Whom God shall make manifest. In whatever created thing in which the
believer perceives a reflection of the Sun of Truth, he must bestow his love and in whatever created thing
in which he does not see such a reflection, in the event that it is the possession of an unbeliever, he must
withdraw his love and negate that thing as long as it remains in the possession of the unbeliever. The
simplicity of existence is revealed—all that exists is for the Manifestation of God and is for God, and
whatever is not for Him is not for God.

The eleventh báb begins with various regulations of the conduct between teachers and students. Parents
and teachers alike are not permitted to strike a child before he reaches the age of five--previous to this age
only verbal admonishments are allowed. After the age of five the child may be given only gentle slaps and
never on the bare skin—always with a covering in between the skin and the striking hand. Whoever

breaks this law will be denied access to his wife for 19 days, or, if he is unmarried, he must pay 19 mithqáls
of gold to the child he struck. Children may play the games which are current amongst them on feast
days. God has ordained that the time that the child sends sitting on a bench, chair or seat will not be
reckoned as part of his life. The Báb writes that the teacher does not know his student, and that he must
honor his student. He then proceeds to proclaim that “God alone knows at what age Him Whom God shall
make manifest will be manifest”. He indicates that He has revealed more than 500,000 verses on diverse
subjects; that the purpose for which men were created is to affirm, follow, obey and aid the Manifestation
of God.

The twelfth báb proscribes a year of waiting for married couples who decide to divorce, the purpose being
to facilitate the reunion of the couple previous to the effecting of a final decision of rupture between them.
In this year-long interval the husband is permtted to come to terms with his wife 19 times, and after the
divorce he may seek reunion with her for 19 days. As marriage is dedicated to the service of God, it is not
right for divorce to take place for it is not a sign of love, and hence divorce should only take place when
one is obliged to divorce. “How difficult the order is for him who is ignorant of its Source, and how easy it
is for him who returns to the Source.”70

The thirteenth báb reveals most of the central teachings of the Báb, with the greatest detail being given
over of the explanation of progressive revelation. He begins the báb by affirming the sublime exaltation of
the earth in the vicinity of the tombs of the 19 Letters of Unity (the Báb and the 18 Letters of the Living).
He indicates that the House of the Báb must have no more than 95 abwáb because this number
demonstrates that He is the mirror of God both in the past and in the future; that the Houses of the
Letters of the Living may have no more than 5 doors for this number symbolizes “the Point (which) is the
complete form of His empire”71; that there are very few true believers in the revelation of Muhammad, for
the mass of believers do not have personal conviction which is the fruit of independent investigation and
the exertions of a spiritual nature, but rather believe through imitation of the belief of others—relatives,
friends, and religious leaders. The Báb condemns those leaders of Islam who base their knowledge and
faith on hadith, who do not recognize that the source of Islam is the Qur’án, its source Muhammad, and
His source, God. He says that the difference between the true believer and he who acts in accordance with
his passions but claims to believe is great indeed—there are few of the former and many of the latter. He
cautions His followers not to imitate others in their belief but to act independently even if they find
themselves the only ones to do so. Perspicacity is essential to every true believer.

Only three of the companions of the Prophet Muhammad remained faithful to Him after His ascension,
and all who did not follow the descendants of ‘Alí were misguided. He identifies the difference between
animals and men as this—that only man can appreciate the truth of the knowledge of God; only man has
a heart whereby he may know and love God, recognize and love the Manifestation of God. Only those
who seek the truth with the spiritual eyes of the heart opened can attain to it. These ones are picked by the
angels inasmuch as in their hearts can be seen the love of the Well-Beloved; these ones are guided by Him

by becoming filled with His attributes, replacing their own attributes—His eyes, the eyes of truth; His ears,
the ears of truth. As revelation is progressive, one must believe in and follow the most current revelation
from God in order to be found acceptable in His eyes. The Báb uses the symbol of accumulating interest
on capital in the eighth báb, and also the symbol of harvesting fruit from trees in order to demonstrate the
manner in which souls who have believed in one Dispensation are weighed in the balance of the following
Manifestation in order to determine whether or not they have really believed. The knowledge of God is
revealed as the foundation of the religion of God, the origin of that knowledge for humanty being the
Manifestation of God and such knowledge unattainable except through when acquired from the
knowledge of the Manifestation Himself.

The fourteenth báb ordains that one day out of every year be designated as the Day of God, and that this
Day is the day when the sun passes from Pisces to Aries, which is the 21st day of March according to the
Gregorian calendar, the Vernal Equinox according to astronomical calculations and the first day of the
Persian New Year. On this day every good work is worth the equivalent of the good works of the entire
year. The number of dishes which must be served to guests in the homes of believers must be between 19
and 2001, and there should be only one dish at every meal so that there will be many reunions during this
Day of God. This is the month of Bahá’—the first day is the day of the Báb, the 18 others are of the
Letters of the Living. During this month fasting is not permitted. The first day of this month, which is the
first day of the year, is the day of Him Whom God shall make manifest.

The fifteenth báb reveals the difference between Paradise and the Fire; that those who are dutiful, who
follow the dictates of their faith but are blind to the truth do not recognize the Manifestation of God when
He appears; during the Dispensation of Muhammad, revelation ceased after the disappearance of the last
of the Ithna ‘Ashari abwáb. He requires that His followers stand out of respect and reverence whenever
the name of Him Whom God shall make manifest is mentioned, and that they prostrate themselves before Him
if He is made manifest during their lives, or be rejected by God. “Give the greatest attention to this point,”
is His admonition, “for, of a certainty, you will encounter Him for Whose name you have shown so much
respect.”72

The sixteenth báb contains remarks related to pilgrimage, travel and commerce; penalties for overly long
voyages, for theft, for tampering with the property of another, violence to other persons; admonitions
concerning the treatment of animals including beasts of burden. The two kinds of penalties exacted upon
believers in the Bayán are (1) monetary fines—the money derived therefrom is to be given to the poor
according to their needs—and (2) periods of separation from one’s lawful wife. Those who commit certain
crimes are forbidden access to their wives for an entire year. He who knows about the intention of one
person to do violence to another but does not intervene will be fined 19 mithqáls of gold (or silver if he is
incapable of paying in silver) and forbidden his wife for 19 days. The purpose of this is that believers will
not do violence to each other, or to non-believers, so that no suffering will come to Him Whom God shall

make manifest when He is made manifest, at least from the Bábís. God loves those best who do not do an
atom of violence to anyone.

Bábís must show respect and kindness to all animals, including beasts of burden (which should not be
overburdened). There follow various laws which pertain to making voyages pleasant and comfortable.
Travel is forbidden except for pilgrimage, commerce and to help one who is in need. One is permitted to
travel by land without one’s family for two years without returning, and to travel by sea for five years
before making a return. Voyages are permitted only when they are properly prepared for so that the
traveler may journey in comfort. In the Day of the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest it is
obligatory for all believers to see Him and to brave whatever hazards as are necessary in order to do so.

The seventeenth báb insists upon the formidable and absolute purity of Him Whom God shall make manifest.
It also reveals that the excrement of mice and of similar animals is not inherently impure—for the sake of
cleanliness, it is best to cleanse things from excrement.

The eighteenth báb prohibits anyone from looking at another’s books whether they are opened or closed
and whatever their subject matter may be without the prior permission of the proprietor.

The nineteenth báb makes obligatory response to invitations, correspondence, questions either in writing
or in spoken language. “In all cases, response is obligatory.”73 This law is revealed in view of the necessity
that each believer respond to the declaration of Him Whom God shall make manifest in verbal, written and
active affirmation of His truth. Of these three responses, the Báb reveals that the believer’s acts are the
most powerful testimony to his belief.

Vahíd VII

The seventh Vahíd begins in the fourth and last volume of the French translation of the Persian Bayán. It
is approximately sixty pages long, and contains several new laws for the regulation of the Bábís as well as
repetitions and expansions of the central teachings of the Báb.
The first báb emphasizes the importance of believers always striving to be beautiful and perfect. All
belongings must be renewed so that they will always be be beautiful for the angels turn away from that
which is ugly. All books must be replaced with new copies after 202 years—the old ones should be given
away or destroyed. There are 19 different styles of writing the Persian-Arabic script, and all of these are
good. The first style is called the Most Glorious [abha]. The Báb asserts that it is preferable to perfect one
of these styles (and this constitutes the highest degree of perfection to which a believer may attain) than to

write all 19 styles imperfectly. He affirms that His Writings constitute the standard of perfection to which
all must aspire. Printing, disseminating and writing of the verses of the Báb are all praiseworthy for they
serve to promote the Faith of God.
The second báb reiterates the teaching that the true believer must commit all his acts for the sake of God,
in obedience o the Báb and His Revelation in His Dispensation and in obedience to Him Whom God shall
make manifest and whatever He reveals in His Day. A specific verse is revealed in this báb whereby the
believer may make all of his acts God-conscious if he recites this verse either in his heart or vocally. If he
does not do so, his good works are all in vain for they are unacceptable before God.74
The third báb reveals that it is pleasing to God for a believer to lend money to other believers; that it is the
obligation of the borrower to pay back his debt as soon as he is able, and that his haste in doing so is a
proof of his faith in God.
The fourth báb ordains one 19 day month of self-purification in which one of the names of God is
concentrated upon by each one of the believers. The Báb asserts that the purpose of this law, and of all of
His laws, is to prepare His followers for the coming of Him Whom God shall make manifest. “And God alone
knows which are those who are blind and those who are perspicuous.”75

The fifth báb contains a summary of all of the teachings of the Bayán and refers to none of the laws.

The sixth báb forbids believers from carrying instruments of war unless they are being used in waging holy
war in the path of God or transported by arms manufacturers. The purpose of this law is to remove the
fear of one another from the hearts of men. Each person must associate with persons of his rank and
profession and refrain from association with those of a higher or lower rank than themselves. The fear of
God is enjoined in these emphatic verses: “Fear God, our Lord, He Who accepts us in His mercifulness.
Fear those things by which the souls of men are tormented. Fear, O slaves of God, fear, all of you.”76

The seventh báb asserts that the Manifestation of God is infinitely superior to and more perfect than all
created things—whether of the past, present or future—and that men cannot understand the rank of the
first believers in the Manifestation, much less the Manifestation Himself.

The eighth báb reveals new significances of the sacred number of unity, 19, and obligates each believer in
the Báb to write one of the names of God in one space delineated on the surface of a table each day of his
life, and if he misses a few days thereof his family is obligated to complete this work which must begin at
his birth and end with his death. Herein is regulated the price of pens.

The ninth báb confirms the blessedness of the monarch who champions the Faith of the Báb77--who must
build a house with 95 doors and one with 90 doors, so that Him Whom God shall make manifest may choose
between these two for His dwelling. It asserts the superiority of the verses of the subsequent Manifestation
over those of the preceeding One; the power of the Manifestation to abase the powerful and uplift the
debased in the spiritual worlds over which He is Sovereign; and the truth that if the best Bábí who reads
the verses of Him Whom God shall make manifest and attests to their superiority over those of men and even
over those of the Báb does not immediately affirm his faith in Him Whom God shall make manifest he is from
that moment on accounted among the unbelievers.

The tenth báb requires each believer to have a table having 2001 squares on its surface, with the name
Mustaghath upon it (this name having the numerical value of Mustaghath). The table should be inscribed
with 2001 names of God, one in each one of the squares. The Báb reveals the two meanings of
Mustaghath and the number 2001 which is relevant to His Revelation—this is the number of all of the
Manifestations of God and it is the date before which Him Whom God shall make manifest must be made
manifest. Only God though knows when He will appear, and, in fact, the Báb actually writes, “but it will
not be longer than the name Mustaghath if God is willing.”78

The eleventh báb begins by requiring believers to sit upon chairs and counches and not upon the ground,
and according to their rank. He goes on to say that the Self of the Manifestation manifests the Self of God,
and that the Utterance of the Manifestation manifests the Utterance of God; that ignorance of the
Manifestation of God and of His Words can be forgiven, but that he who knows that the verses of God are
His highest testimony and that no words can compare with those of the most recent Manifestation of God
is accounted among the infidels until and unless he unhesitatingly affirms the truth of the most recent
Manifestation; that he who does not sincerely obey God is not sincere79; that the people who follow the
dictates and imitate the lives of their religious leaders are not followers of the truth for they do not see it
for themselves, and they believe because others believe and not according to the admonition: “Believe in
Him by Himself.”80 He asserts that at all times that which matters is the approval of God and not that of
men—God proves and tests the hearts of men through His religion. He is the only one who can accept or
reject the faith of the Bábís. Only those who accept the new Manifestation by virtue of their own volition
and the clarity of their own judgment are true believers.

The twelfth báb contains an insistence upon the Oneness, Onliness, the Indivisibility of God, of His
Manifestation and therefore the requirement that all obey and follow Him exclusively in the Day of His
Manifestation.

The thirteenth báb reveals that the most valuable of all things in the eyes of God are the verses of the
Manifestation of God, and, in particular, the verses of Him Whom God shall make manifest. The Báb requires
all of His followers to each have a sheet of paper with 19 verses written thereon in the handwriting of the
Manifestation of God. This applies to Him, and, in the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, to Him,
and in each subsequent Day of Judgment to the Manifestation of God in that Day. He affirms the
superiority of the verses of Him Whom God shall make manifest to those of the Bayán:

> “If he writes only one of these verses, this is more valuable for him than to write the entire Bayán
> and all of the books written in the [Dispensation of the] Bayán, for the entire Bayán will be
> annulled and this verse will subsist until the following Manifestion.”81

The fourteenth báb forbids the confession of sins to all except the Manifestation of God when He is made
manifest—or anyone whom He may appoint for this purpose—and to anyone but God when the
Manifestation has ascended. Forgiveness sought through other channels is sought in vain for only God can
forgive the sins of men.

The fifteenth báb enjoins believers in the Bayán to prostrate themselves before the gate of Shíráz, the city
in which the Báb was made manifest. He asserts that the germ of the subsequent Manifestation is superior
to the perfection of the previous Manifestation. This verse was cited by Bahá’u’lláh in one of His Tablets:

> “He Who is the Heart and Center of the Bayán hath written: ‘The germ that holdeth within itself
> the potentialities of the Revelation that is to come is endowed with a potency superior to the
> combined forces of all those who follow Me.’”82

The Bayán asserts that one verse revealed by the Manifestation of God is sufficient proof of His divine
origin and prophethood; that “the value of an order depends only on the value of the value of him who
gave it!”83; that the Manifestation of God and God Himself are immeasurably exalted above any need of
their servants, and that “It is not that He wishes that all become believers in Him, but that the happiness
of all resides in their faith in Him.”84

The sixteenth báb commands the believers in the Bayán, including a monarch and his subjects, to make
every effort to rid the earth of all but believers in the Bayán, and, in the time of the appearance of Him
Whom God shall make manifest to rid the earth of all who do not believe in Him. Not a single unbeliever must
be tolerated among the believers, and believers who associate with unbelievers must be considered as
unbelievers—the “condition of friendship” must be recognized as indicative of “purity of religious faith” in
the Báb and in all He has revealed “and in nothing else”85. He particularly wished that the five countries
enumerated earlier in the text—Fars, the two ‘Iraqs, Adhirbayjan, Khurasan and Mazindaran (Vahíd 6-
báb 4)—be reserved exclusively for His followers. He decreed that commerce with Christians is permitted
if it is of benefit to the Bábís.

This báb ordains Friday as the day to be set aside every week for purity, cleanliness and rest. One good act
performed during this day is worth the equivalent of all good acts performed during the other days of the
week. A verse is revealed in this báb which all believers are obligated to recite on Friday whilst facing the
sun.

This báb is concerned with penalties for certain crimes, and the abolition of particular punishments.
Anyone who torment another will be fined a certain amount and although the fines are fixed, each
believer will be required to pay according to his capacity. Violations against women bear a double
penalty, in other words, a fine twice as big as that levied from one who violates a man. The purpose of
these penalties is to insure satisfaction to those who are violated, for it is most pleasing to God when the
believers are happy and most displeasing to God when they are unhappy.

Imprisonment and chaining of malfactors are absolutely forbidden, and the Bayán calls upon the believer
kings to rid the earth of the prisons in which He was shut away. It is forbidden for the believer to imprison
or chain either a believer or an unbeliever. If he does so, the first violation will necessitate punishment—
presumably a fine—unless the one who has been violated is satisfied with being released, in which case
punishment is withheld. The second violation results in expulsion from amongst the ranks of the believers.
The purpose of this prohibition of imprisonment and chaining is to protect Him Whom God shall make
manifest while He is hidden and not yet manifest to the eyes of men. The high are made low, the low are
exalted through their response to the new Manifestation of God. All acts are acceptable only if they are
undertaken in accordance with God’s Will as revealed by the new Manifestation of God—no human act is
independent of this spiritual law, no act is acceptable in itself.

This báb is devoted to the revelation of a prayer and to a discourse on the origins, meanings and purposes
of prayer, and on the love of Gd which is expressed in prayer. The Bayán reveals a prayer composed of 19
verses which is to be recited at noon and which is a sign of the believer’s submissiveness to Him Whom God

shall make manifest. “After the knowledge of God, no work is higher than prayer, and the prayers of each
one proceed according to his rank.”86 The highest prayers, those of the greatest spiritual potency are the
prayers of the Manifestation of God; the next rank of prayer is that of the Letters of the Living. The
source of all prayer must be remembered for that prayer to have any worth, for it to be acceptable to God;
likewise, this knowledge must be kept in mind while one is praying. “At the moment of prayer, one must
have God, the Unique One only in view.”87

All value is derived from the Unity of God, and “Those who possess limited forms are creatures multiplied
from the Primal Unity and are not the Primal Unity Itself.”88 We should remember in this connection that
the number of the Unity of God is 19, and that the number of all things is 361, which is 19 times 19. We
should also remember that 5 is the number of the Báb and that 5 multiplied by 19 is 95, the number of
“for God”.

The hierarchy of prayers is manifested in the hierarchy of existences. All of God’s creations are but
mirrors reflecting His Being and His Acts. All sciences, all acts have as their end the knowledge of God.
Consequently, as God is the only Reality which is Self-Subsisting and Independent, the believer must
focus on the Essence of God during prayer rather than upon His Attributes or His creations. This applies
in general to one’s attitude towards God:

> “If it is out of fear that you adore God, this is not worthy of Him, and of a certainty you will not
> receive the order of Unity upon yourself. In the same manner, if your eyes are attached to Paradise
> and if it is your avid thirst for this Paradise that motivates you to adore Hm—then you have
> associatedin yourself something with God, something that is His creature, be it even a creature
> which is agreable in His sight…That which is worthy of the Essence of God is for you to be loving
> without fear of the Fire, without hope of Paradise.”89

That prayer is most acceptable to God which is made in a spirit of contentment and happiness, not that
which is the longest and most difficult to deliver. Entry into the Paradise of God’s Presence does not come
as a result of prayer or even the love of God n the part of the believer but according to the mercy of God.
The prayer of 19 verses is the only prayer (daily prayer) permitted in the Dispensation of the Báb and it is
better to recite this one prayer at noon than to possess all of the material goods of this world. The Muslim
prayers, both those ordained in the Qur’án and those later required of believers by the Imams and the
mullas are abrogated and their recitation is forbidden for it is no longer acceptable before God.

Vahíd VIII

This Vahíd is approximately 75 pages long in the French translation, and its contents are for the most part
reiterations and expansions of teachings and regulations already revealed in other Vahíds.
This báb compares Him Whom God shall make manifest with the sun, and the first to believe in Him with the
moon, and the rest of His followers with the stars, all in terms of the brilliancy of the light which emanates

from them. The Báb asserts that He is the first believer in Him Whom God shall make manifest and that the
moon (the Báb) and the stars (the followers of Him Whom God shall make manifest) derive their light from Him
Whom God shall make manifest, Who is the Sun of Reality. Without His light they are dark. In each
Dispensation, those who turn towards the new dawning of the Sun of Reality receive new light, and those
who persist in turning towards the old Manifestation of God lose their brilliance. He reveals a verse which
is found in many of the abwáb of the Bayán, either exactly in these words or with slight changes:

> “In truth! Be certain that I am God, that there is no God but He; all that is not He is My creature.

O My creatures, adore Me! Fear Me!”90
This báb proclaims that all acts enjoined in the Book of God are reveaed for the purpose of men being
obedient to God which is for their own well-being. If they disobey the Manifestation of God because He
ordains differently from the previous Manifestation, they have misapprehended the purpose of the Law of
God. This Law is revealed for his well-being—he is not created for its well-being.91 Each believer must
leave to his descendants 19 sheets of paper of excellent quality and 19 rings engraved with one of the
verses of God. Those who are entitled to inherit from believers belong to one of the following 7 categories:
(1)father, (2)mother, (3)spouse, (4)children, (5)brother, (6)sister, (7)teacher. This corresponds in number to
the 7 names of God which are explained in this báb. SYRAT is given the meaning of recognition of the
Manifestation of God during His lifetime when He has few or no followers. “It is in this way that in the
beginning of each Manifestation perspicacious people are more rare than red sulphur.”92

Most people are not aware of the source of revelation and of its nature and consequently they are obedient
to each other and because of the grandeur it brings them and not obedient to God. “The Qur’án was, in
effect, revealed in the previous Manifestation in 23 years, while it is manifest that in this Manifestation, the
descent of a book like the Qur’án does not take more than a week.”93 The Bayán reaffirms its central
teaching, that the purpose of God in revealing the Bayán is to prepare His servants to recognize and
submt themselves to Him Whom God shall make manifest. This is trueof all Dispensations. The subsequent
Manifestation is revealed in a higher station than the previous One, and He is also the previous
Manifestation in a new degree of revelation. Believers must purify their souls in order to be able to
recognize and believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest.
This báb opens with this statement—one only has spiritual life ifone turns to God for His blessing. During
life human beings often come to the brink of spiritual death, and only by seeking God’s gift of life can they
be given new life. At the time when this verse was revealed, the Báb had declared Himself to be the new
Manifestation of God, and it was to Him that all must turn for forgiveness from their sins. No order is
more obligatory than this, and the blessing of souls consists in this, and not in the works which they
accomplish. The Bayán asserts that the human spirit does not exist in other creatures. Spiritual life may be
received from the Letters of the Living and Their Successors after the passing of the Báb and before the
apparition of the next Manifestation of God. This is the way it happened in the past and the way it will
happen in the future. The source of all truth is the Manifestation of God. All infidel nations believe that

they are following the Will of God. One can only truly recognize and know God by Himself, and never
through His intermediaries who are only His creatures, His slaves.
This báb stipulates that in order to love and know God one must follow the way He has prescribed and
not the way that human beings imagine or wish to be good. The speed of affirmation of Him Whom God
shall make manifest is the factor which will influence the believer’s spiritual station. Obedience to the orders
of God “was and is a mark of grandeur, but on the condition that one does not remain in ignorance of the
source in each Manifestation.”94 If one obeys one of God’s orders for the sake of His pleasure it is worth
nothing unless one obeys them all.

This báb is concerned with the ownership and symbolic significance of certain jewels. Each believer who
has the capacity to make himself the owner of certain jewels is obligated in this verse of the Bayán to do
so. The jewels are enumerated as follows: 3 diamonds (the number of “Ism”); 4 topazes (the number of
“Allah”); 6 emeralds (the number of “al-Amna”) 6 rubies (the number of “al-Aqdas”). These must be given
to Him Whom God shall make manifest when He appears. They number 19 jewels in all. During the ministry
of the Báb they should be given to Him, and then saved for Him Whom God shall make manifest. The
significances of the different elements and of the 4 colors are described in this báb and 4 prayers are
associated, one with each of the 4 colors, these prayers being decreed as highly blessed but not cited in the
Persian Bayán itself.

This báb contains laws governing personal appearance and hygiene. The Bayán obligates believers His
followers to bathe the entire body once every 4 days, to pluck out hairs (presumably pubic hairs nd chest
hairs and perhaps eyebrow hairs) every 8 or 14 days, to cut one’s nails and to use henna on the whole
body. The word “al-rahim” must be tatooed on the chests of men believers, and the word “Allahum” on
the chests of women believers. This writing must be the most beautiful and it is permitted to write more
words than these. It is good to look at oneself in the mirror, once by night and once by day, and when one
looks in the mirror, if one sees that one is beautiful one should thank God and if the ugly one should ask
for mercy from Him. The more often the laundry is washed the better, and the cleaner one is in all things
the better. Cleanliness is a relative matter and it is praiseworthy according to its rank of perfection. Those
who cannot bathe themselves, or wash their clothes as often as is enjoined in the Bayán should not despair
for in believing in cleanliness are they benefitted. The purpose of this bodily purity is to be acceptable
before God Who is the Most Pure.

This báb orders the printing of the Bayán but only in the most beautiful handwriting. Each believer
should own one copy of the Bayán if possible. The RETURN of the Manifestation of God is mentioned, a
theme the reader is very familiar with at this point.

Vahíd VIII, Báb 8

This báb permits believers to shave part or the whole of his head and the beard so that the hair will come
back with more strength. It also permits men to trim their mustaches. Prayer in one’s “abba” is enjoined
and in one’s “jubba” it is forbidden unless one cannot do otherwise.

This báb obligates every believer from the beginning of the Báb’s Dispensation to the commencement of
the Dispensation of Him Whom God shall make manifest to write everything he did before and after becoming
a Bábí in a book which must be preserved by his descendants for their edification. He proclaims the Day
of Judgment to be the greatest of all days, inasmuch as in this Day is made manifest the Manifestation of
God.

In this báb is revealed that each man believer and each woman believer is permitted to talk to any man or
woman in the entire human family—so that nobody may remain ignorant of the Revelation of the Báb in
the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest and all will be expecting His manifestation. It is pleasing to
God that the conversation of the believer with the unbeliever be limited to 28 words or less.

This báb is concerned with the purification of the dead which involves bathing of the deceased one’s body
in water and the recitation of certain verses revealed in this báb, which differ for men and for women.
After the body has been purified it should be perfumed with the water of rose or some other scent; then
dust from the graves of the first and last believer must be sprinkled upon the body of the deceased and a
ring must be put on his finger; finally, the flesh of the body should be inscribed with 19 names of God.
The same respect must be shown to the cadaver of the believer as is shown to the believer while alive. The
dead should be visited every 19 days, that is, once every Bábí month. At death the angels will take the
souls of believers to Paradise and the demons will take the souls of unbelievers to the Fire. “All persons, on
the contrary, who die in anything else but faith in the Bayán, even if he has done all the good deeds of
which he is capable, they will be of no service to him.”95 In this báb the ranking of the contents of the
Persian Bayán is set forth as follows:

> “All of the orders contained in the Bayán flow because of the secrets of the knowledge and of the
> Unity of God…the degrees of the Unity are named in five degrees: 1)There is no God but “hu”;
> 2)There is no God but “ana”; 3)There is no God but the One God; 4)There is no God but “anta”;
> 5)There is no God but “allazi”.96

This báb introduces pilgrimage to the Báb’s place of martyrdom, requiring every person after the age of
29 to spend 19 days in that place praying and focusing on one of the names of God. If the believer resides
outside of the fixed distance stipulated in this báb it is permitted for him to follow this order in his own

home. He reveals the so-called Golden Rule in the following words: “Do not be happy with anything
happening to another person which you would not want to happen to you.”97

This báb permits the believers in the Báb to recite 95 verses revealed by Him on the anniversary of His
birth and His death. Five verses and no more, no less should be recited in the honor of the Letters of the
Living on the occasion of the days of birth and death of each one of them. The purpose of reciting these
verses is that they might believe and follow the Manifestation of God in the Day of His coming.

This báb makes it obligatory for every believer to read 700 verses from the Bayán each day and night, or,
if he is unable to do this, to mention God 700 times therein. If one reads the verses of the Bayán one will
be drawn by the Word of God to God Himself. The Bayán ordains that His verses be read with a
sorrowful and full voice. The purpose of this commandment is that by following the Báb’s instructions
each believer may become one of the letters or names of God in the Day of Him Whom God shall make
manifest and recognize Him immediately. He repeats that Paradise is in the affirmation and the Fire in
negation; that, by virtue of the Will of God, in the Day of the Manifestation the high are abased, the low
exalted, and He cites the example of the city of Isfahan during His own manifestation, where, when He
resided there and astounded all of the divines and government officials by His innate power and
knowledge, the first one to believe in Him was an ignorant, unlettered manual worker. The Bayán
indicates that all believe in God and adore Him but few recognize His Manifestation when He is made
manifest—many are called but few are chosen…many believe, but few indeed on God’s terms.

Báb fifteen contains the injunction that every man must take a wife so that after his death there may
remain one—a child, the fruit of his union with his wife—who may glorify God on earth in His stead. If
the couple cannot have a child, the one who is infertile or impotent is permitted to marry another in order
to have a child if permission is granted by the other, that is, the one who is impotent or infertile. Bábís are
permitted to marry other Bábís only and the believer who is converted after marrying, if his or her spouse
will not convert also is obligated to divorce that spouse until and unless he or she becomes a believer. A
new formula is revealed for the worship of the Bábís—it is no longer “Bismillah al-rahim al-rahman” but
“Bismillah al-amna al-aqdas”, meaning “In the name of God, the Inaccessible, the Most Holy.”

This báb reveals a tax of 19% on all earthly goods in terms of their value in mithqáls of gold. This amount
must be remitted to the Báb and the 18 Letters of the Living--1% to the Báb and after His passing it must
be preserved to give to Him Whom God shall make manifest or spent for the Cause of God; 1% to each of the
Letters of the Living, and after their passing to their children, and if they are childless then to be spent on
weddings. It is good for believers to ask God to forgive and show mercy in His dealings with their parents,

and the Báb enjoins His followers to do so after uttering each prayer. “The fruit of this Báb is that if He
[Him Whom God shall make manifest] gives an order, you must obey it as you obey [Me] today.”98

This báb begins with another tax, in which 95 out of every 6005 mithqáls of gold owned by every believer
must be given to the Báb, and after His passing saved for Him Whom God shall make manifest . It is permitted
to divide this mithqáls among 19 believers, each receiving 5 mithqáls apiece. There are symbolic
meanings to all of these numbers and they are all related to the science of numbers to which the Báb
makes copious reference in His Writings. It is revealed that all good comes from being obedient to the
orders of God, and nothing else. Believers must be satisfied with whatever lot God has ordained for them,
whether they are rich or poor, a king or a subject, illustrious or ignorant, a slave or a master. In all cases
one must be satisfied that God’s Will is just, correct and benevolent. Intelligence and perspicacity are
qualities which one must possess in order to recognize and follow the new Manifestation of God when He
is made manifest. It is affirmed that the use of force was permitted in the religion of Islam in order to
induce people to become believers, for it is better to be forced into Paradise than to be left to burn of one’s
own free will in the Fire of unbelief. Jihad is approved in the Bábí Dispensation. Various doctrines are
affirmed: Muhammad was made manifest for 23 years; the only true Muslims are those call Ithná
‘Asharíyyah Shí’ah who live in the five lands which the Bayán ordains for the occupancy of Bábís; all the
precepts of Islam are based upon belief in the Prophethood of Muhammad, the Imamate of ‘Alí and the
other Imams, and the rank of the Abwáb. The Bayán is sympathetic to the difficulty faced by the believer
when called upon to accept a mere man, and in some cases a relative or other personal associate, as the
new Manifestation of God.

This báb reveals the laws pertaining to the fast, which takes place during the last month of the year
according to the Bábí calendar for a full 19 days. The purpose of the fast is for the believers to act
according to the good-pleasure of God and to be detached from all else but Him. If they fast for love of
Him and in obedience to His most recent Manifestation it is acceptable. If not, it has no value whatsoever.
In the fast one is abstaining from the Fire, from all that is repugnant to God. The text affirms that the laws
of the Bayán are specific and must be followed exactly as they are revealed until he appearance of Him
Whom God shall make manifest. During the fast believers must abstain from drink, food, sexual relations
(literally, a man may not approach a woman, a woman may not approach a man), discussions including
those that pertain to science, all violence (even the most light) and rendering sentences or decrees against
God or the Manifestation of God. The last three abstentions are the most important as they may affect
Him Whom God shall make manifest. The believer must begin fasting at the age of 11 and leave off fasting
after the age of 42 and to fast before r after these ages is not recognized as a good deed in th eyes of God
for it is not obedient to His specific instructions. It is not stipulated in this Báb, or elsewhere in the Persian
Bayán whether believers must observe these abstentions from sunrise to sunset like Muslims, or from
sunset to sunrise, or, twenty-fours a day.99

In this final báb of the eighth Vahíd, the spiritual merit of Friday is deemed to be double that of other
days, and Bábís are to make mention of Him Whom God shall make manifest and His Letters 202 times and to
say “Ya Allah” 4000 times on that day. Whenever Him Whom God shall make manifest and His Letters are
mentioned the believer must utter benedictions upon them. Muslims say, “Muhammad, peace be upon
Him!” It appears that the Bayán would have Bábís do likewise for Him Whom God shall make manifest and
His Letters. The Intermediation of the Manifestation between God and His creatures is affirmed, and in
the most clear language. “In effect, there is no route for the contingent being towars the Eternal Essence if
it is not that which descends from God through Him Who is manifest in the Manifestation, and all that
returns to God in returning to His Being.”100 One is only acceptable before God if one is acceptable
before the Manifestation of God. Whoever is truly acting for the love of God will recognize and obey Him
Whom God shall make manifest for He is the Manifestation of God and the only link that man has with God.
All else is personal religion and is utterly worthless. As acceptance by God is the purpose of all human
existence, so the acceptance by the Manifestation of God is the most important event in the human
being’s life. Everything is given meaning, reality and truth by the Manifestation of God. If anything is not
mentioned, not approved, not revealed by the Manifestation of God it is insignificant and unworthy of
men’s concern.

Vahíd IX

The final Vahíd of the Persian Bayán is composed of 10 rather than the 19 abwáb of all previous Vahíds is
about 30 pages in length in the French translation.
This báb concerns blessed places, sacred spaces—every precious place, every unique town, the home of
every king, all these belong to God and all must be returned to Him by being turned over to Him Whom
God shall make manifest. If a believer in the Báb prays in the home of an unbeliever and if he spends even
one mithqál of silver on alms he has blessed that dwelling. In all great solemn meetings a place should be
reserved for 19 persons, in honor of Him Whom God shall make manifest and His Letters, or, if that is not
possible, then at least for one person, Him Whom God shall make manifest. The Bayán designates the city of
Shíráz where He was born and where He declared His mission as the most sacred place for believers
during His Dispensation. In this city an edifice should be raised in which the believers may recite their
prayers and make mention of God, and the walls of that edifice must be made of mirrors.
This báb admonishes the Bábís to teach their children to write the Persian-Arabic script beautifully. The
verses of the new Manifestation are not those of the superannuated Manifestations should be written.
Every scribe endowed with an uniquely perfect handwiting is obliged to write 1000 verses of the Báb’s
Writings and have these preserved until the appearance of Him Whom God shall make manifest. If the scribe
fulfils his duty he will receive the Báb’s blessing in Paradise. There are 19 varieties of the Arabic-Persian

script permitted in the Bábí Dispensation, but the one called shikaste is the most perfect and all of the
Writing of the Báb may be penned in this script.
This báb contains the teaching that all human beings must be silent during the Day of Judgment, that is,
during the period of the appearance of the Manifestation, for not one of their words can compare with the
words of the Manifestation of God, these being the Words of God. The most brilliant among the believers
is like a star which is completely hidden from view by the mid-day sun in its radiant splendor. All kings
and emperors are commanded to build houses ornamented with mirrors, with inscriptions which will
remind them to become the followers of Him Whom God shall make manifest when He appears, for His
follower in His Day is the most exalted of all creatures while unbelievers in Him are the most vile of all
creatures. So great is the blessing due a monarch who comes to the aid of Him Whom God shall make manifest
that the Bayán reveals these words: “If a torment afflicts Him Whom God shall make manifest, chastisement
which was due all contingent beings seizes him (the monarch); if, on the contrary, he comes to His aid, the
blessing that was destined to flow upon all things will descend upon him.”101 The Bayán asserts that this is
true to a lesser degree of the leaders of religion, for they are the guides of the believers and wherever they
turn, the populace turns—if they recognize the truth they will be doubly rewarded (double the reward of
the common man, not of the monarch), and if they reject the truth they will receive a greater punishment,
for, in their blindness they will deprive others of vision.102 People are inhibited by the veils of their
passions from becoming convinced of the truth of the verses of the Manifestation of God. This will be the
case in the day of Him Whom God shall make manifest. God tests His slaves in every Day of Judgment, and the
Báb’s followers will not be free fom this test. Every person must attend to himself, that thereby he may be
saved from ignorance and from the Fire.
This báb opens with the affirmation that “All science is the knowledge of moral qualities and man must
live in conformity with this science.”103 The Bayán counsels the Bábís not to take anything to its
extreme104, and thereby avoid causing torment either to themselves or to others. If one accepts his poverty
in this world, in the world to come he will have no torment, but if he asks for help to alleviate his poverty
and is delivered therefrom, this benefit cannot compare with the humiliation which he has experienced in
asking for someone else’s aid. God desires that His servants not abase themselves before each other105 and
He desires that they seek aid from Him alone.106 The believer must make mention of God at all times in
his heart. In this way he will receive the reflection of the Sun of Truth in the mirror of his heart when the
Sun is newly risen. If one makes mention of God in one’s heart when He is made manifest but does not
turn towards Him, one has actually turned away from God, for the Manifestation is the Mention of God,
His Testimony before all mankind.

To make mention of God in a loud voice is 95 times more valuable than to do so in a soft voice during the
Day in which Him Whom God shall make manifest appears. It is better to accept Him Whom God shall make
manifest with a heart which does not always mention God than to reject Him with a heart which makes
mention of God at all times. Furthermore, to prostrate oneself before God is to prostrate oneself before

Him Whom God shall make manifest. The spirit of prayer, as has been previously noted in the Bayán is more
important than its length. “Perhaps if you make mention (of God) with joy and happiness it is worth more
than one thousand utterances made without joy and happiness.”107

This báb reveals the purpose of the Revelation of God in the most cogent and powerful language. The
purpose of divine revelation is to educate the creature, which is infinitely abased in comparison with God
and His Manifestation, to teach the creature to be detached from all save God and to return to His
Presence with joy and happiness. God is exalted above that is not Him; He is the Creator of the most
perfect and the most vile of His creatures. Human beings are His slaves and they have no authority to say
anything about God or His Manifestation. “If you look upon Him with any other vision than the vision of
the Unity of God, He will unleash upon you a judgment, proclaiming that you are nothing but an
‘animal’. And if, God keep you from it!, you present to Him your observations, you have done so of your
own volition and you will be held responsible for this act.”108 The Bayán ordains that every believer must
serve Him Whom God shall make manifest for 19 days, doing whatever He commands. If they do not follow
His Will during these days, their service to God is not accepted.

This báb exhorts the believers to venerate the family of the Báb. They are to aknowledge that the name
which is closest to God is that of the coming Manifestation, after the names of the Letters of the Unity
(which are those of the Báb and the 18 Letters of the Living). The most temperate climate is that of the
land in which the Sun of Reality is made manifest. The sanctity and exaltation of God’s Essence is
reiterated, along with the assertion that the Manifestation of God is a creation of God, the Son of God in
the sense that He manifests God’s attributes, for He takes no part in God’s Essence, albeit the most perfect
of God’s creations, and the creation by virtue of which all other created beings are made to exist. A verse
is revealed which the believers are counseled to recite 314 times, which is the numerical value of
“Powerful”. God will respond to this recitation by making them the instruments of His response, the
channels of His utterance. This verse is quoted in full, first in the translator’s rendering and second in the
translation of Shoghi Effendi:

> “Say: God sufficeth all things, for all things. And nothing sufficeth God your Lord, nothing amidst
> the things of the heavens, the earth or that which is between. He is the Wise, He Who Sufficeth,
> the Powerful.”109

> “Say: God sufficeth all things above all things, and nothing in the heavens or in the earth but God
> sufficeth. Verily, He is in Himself, the Knower, the Sustainer, the Omnipotent.”110

This báb repeats the teaching that whoever does not accept the Manifestation of God in His Day does not
accept God, whatever he may think to the contrary. “Tombac”111 and “asafoetida”112 are forbidden to
believers as they are impure and God desires all pure things for His servants. “Seek refuge in God alone,

for the unbeliever is like the asafoetida.”113 It is revealed here that the human being does not really have a
free choice—that is to accept the Manifestation of God or to reject Him if he so chooses—for although he
can not be forced into becoming a true believer in the Manifestation, God forbids negation and requires
affirmation, and whosoever disobeys His orders will be punished until he repents and follows Divine Law.

This báb contains teachings which pertain to spiritual life as well as to practical and physical actions. It
affirms that “Everything that is other than love comes from other than the truth, and everything that is
love comes from the truth.”114 It then proceeds to reveal that believers cannot be accounted as faithful to
God if they do not abstain from those things which are forbidden then by the Báb. In this Báb an absolute
prohibition is revealed against the use of opium, of fermented beverages and of medicines except when
these substances are employed in some industry where they are necessary. As in the case of association
with unbelievers, use of these substances is only allowable if it is required by one’s work. In associating
with unbelievers the believers must be affable for through this association the unbelievers may be
benefitted, and some even become converts to the true Religion of God, “for the possibility of believing
exists in every being, if this one does not allow himself to be led astray by his passions.”115

The ninth báb enjoins prayer and pilgrimage; communal prayer is forbidden except for the prayer for the
dead which all must say together in unison, but not in accordance with abrogated rituals in which all
follow a leader, repeating what he says after him. All prayer is fruitless if, in the Day of Him Whom God shall
make manifest the believer remains ignorant of Him, or asks that He present proofs which cannot be made
manifest, such as showing God to the believer, for He is Immeasurably Exalted above the vision and
comprehension of men, or showing him the angels for they are in the spiritual worlds and unable to
descend to the physical plane of reality or in human figures in which case they appear to be other human
beings. The Manifestation of God fulfills His Mission and it is of no importance to Him whether men
believe in Him or not—if they do it is for their good, not His. Pilgrimage is enjoined for those who can
carry it out.

This is the last báb, and perhaps the most personal and most beautiful as well as the most pointedly
specific of all the abwáb of the Persian Bayán. It reveals that the mention of God and belief in Him Whom
God shall make manifest will purify all souls, filling them with affirmation and saving them from negation.
Negation has affected all Revelations, and it is always made manifest among the believers of the past
Manifestations when they are introduced to the succeeding Manifestation. The negators of the Qur’án
were followers of the Gospel, those of the Bayán were followers of the Qur’án. This is the universal human
condition and will always exist, for the Day of Judgment is the testing ground for the believers in God, and
not merely of the unbelievers. Him Whom God shall make manifest is the Image of the words,
“Allah’u’A’zam”. The whole point of the Bayán and of the Religion of the Báb is that the believer therein
purify his heart so that it will be capable of recognizing Him Whom God shall make manifest and thereby obey
God.

The Persian Bayán ends with these words, calling the believers to action:

“Of a certainty! Of a certainty! Purify your souls in the manner you can.”116

quality and authority as the verses of the Qur’án. It likewise addresses the belief common among many Isma’ílí and
Ithná ‘Asharíyyah Shí’í Muslims that the writings of their Imams were of a similar (or superior) spiritual quality and

authority as the verses of the Qur’án. The Báb exalts the verses revealed by the Manifestation of God far far above
the writings of any and all human beings.

of high parts of the mountains.” Some commentators have taken it to mean “a name of the upper part of the skies
or upper part of Heaven”. Surat Mutaffifin in the Qur’án (83:18-28) uses this term to denote those who are close to
God, the true believers.

36Mithqál is a unit of measure, equivalent to 4.3 or 4.72 metric grams. Currencies in use in Iran have, for
centuries, been based on this unit of measure, including the dirham, the dínár, the túmán, the tanga, the tillá and
perhaps others. Gold dínárs “were first struck to the contemporary standard of 4.4 grams and with one or more
Arabic standing figures on the obverse and an Arabic legend on the reverse. Dated coins exist from 74 hijra and are

named as ' dínárs'. These experimental issues were replaced in 77 hijra, except in North Africa and Spain, by
completely epigraphical designs very similar to the designs adopted for the silver pieces but with a shorter reverse
legend and no annulets or inner circles. This type was used without appreciable change for the whole of Umayyad
period [40-132 hijra/661-750 CE], the coins being struck to a new and carefully controlled standard of 4.25 grams.
This weight was reputed to be based on the average of the current Byzantine solidi, was called a mithqál, a term
used earlier for 1/72 of a ratl.”

58Bahá’u’lláh addresses this theme in these words: “Whoso, while reading the Sacred Scriptures, is tempted to
choose therefrom whatever may suit him with which to challenge the authority of the Representative of God among
men, is, indeed, as one dead, though to outward seeming he may walk and converse with his neighbors, and share
with them their food and their drink.” (Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, pp. 175-176)

59 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá addresses this theme in some of His Tablets: “The sciences of today are bridges to reality; if then
they lead not to reality, naught remains but fruitless illusion. By the one true God! If learning be not a means of
access to Him, the Most Manifest, it is nothing but evident loss.” (Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p. 110) “O
thou son of the Kingdom! All things are beneficial if joined with the love of God; and without His love all things are
harmful, and act as a veil between man and the Lord of the Kingdom. When His love is there, every bitterness
turneth sweet, and every bounty rendereth a wholesome pleasure. For example, a melody, sweet to the ear, bringeth
the very spirit of life to a heart in love with God, yet staineth with lust a soul engrossed in sensual desires. And every
branch of learning, conjoined with the love of God, is approved and worthy of praise; but bereft of His love,
learning is barren -- indeed, it bringeth on madness. Every kind of knowledge, every science, is as a tree: if the fruit
of it be the love of God, then is it a blessed tree, but if not, that tree is but dried-up wood, and shall only feed the
fire.” (Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p. 181)

61 Ibid., p. 63. This citation is problematic. The Báb seems to require a literal interpretation of His words, and yet it
is evident that a line of 30 letters does not contain 40 words. Perhaps the correct rendering would be that a line of
30 letters contains 40 strokes including the accents? In any case, a line is designated as one verse, and that verse is
composed of 30 letters. If the average word length is deemed to be composed of four consonants, this would result
in there being between 7 and 8 words per verse. The actual significance of this description has not been carefully
studied as far as the author is aware.

74“Make not your deeds as snares wherewith to entrap the object of your aspiration, and deprive not yourselves of
this Ultimate Objective for which have ever yearned all such as have drawn nigh unto God. Say: The very life of all
deeds is My good pleasure, and all things depend upon Mine acceptance. Read ye the Tablets that ye may know
what hath been purposed in the Books of God, the All-Glorious, the Ever-Bounteous. He who attaineth to My love
hath title to a throne of gold, to sit thereon in honour over all the world; he who is deprived thereof, though he sit
upon the dust, that dust would seek refuge with God, the Lord of all Religions.” (Bahá’u’lláh, The Kitáb-i-Aqdas,

77 “We cherish the hope that one of the kings of the earth will, for the sake of God, arise for the triumph of this
wronged, this oppressed people. Such a king will be eternally extolled and glorified. God hath prescribed unto this
people the duty of aiding whosoever will aid them, of serving his best interests, and of demonstrating to him their
abiding loyalty. They who follow Me must strive, under all circumstances, to promote the welfare of whosoever will
arise for the triumph of My Cause, and must at all times prove their devotion and fidelity unto him. Happy is the
man that hearkeneth and observeth My counsel. Woe unto him that faileth to fulfil My wish.” (Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings
from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, CII, p. 207) “How great the blessedness that awaiteth the king who will arise to aid My
Cause in My Kingdom, who will detach himself from all else but Me! Such a king is numbered with the
companions of the Crimson Ark -- the Ark which God hath prepared for the people of Bahá. All must glorify his
name, must reverence his station, and aid him to unlock the cities with the keys of My Name, the omnipotent
Protector of all that inhabit the visible and invisible kingdoms. Such a king is the very eye of mankind, the luminous
ornament on the brow of creation, the fountain-head of blessings unto the whole world. Offer up, O people of
Bahá, your substance, nay your very lives, for his assistance.” (Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh,
CV, p. 212)

him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful? 2:25 And he said unto them, Have ye never
read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him? 2:26 How he went
into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat
but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? 2:27 And he said unto them, The sabbath was
made for man, and not man for the sabbath…” (Gospel of Mark 2:24-27)

99 “Whatsoever the Creator commandeth His creatures to observe, the same must they diligently, and with the
utmost joy and eagerness, arise and fulfil. They should in no wise allow their fancy to obscure their judgment,
neither should they regard their own imaginings as the voice of the Eternal. In the Prayer of Fasting We have
revealed: "Should Thy Will decree that out of Thy mouth these words proceed and be addressed unto them,
'Observe, for My Beauty's sake, the fast, O people, and set no limit to its duration,' I swear by the majesty of Thy
glory, that every one of them will faithfully observe it, will abstain from whatsoever will violate Thy law, and will
continue to do so until they yield up their souls unto Thee." In this consisteth the complete surrender of one's will to
the Will of God.” (Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, CLX, pp. 337-338)

102A.L.M.Nicolas translated the Persian Bayán from a manuscript procured in Iran – from the beginning to the
middle of the third Báb of the ninth Vahíd. From this point until the close of the text, that is, the remaining six and
one half abwáb, he translated from a manuscript made available to him by Mirza Yahya who had, by this time,
been found falsifying certain verses of the Báb. The authenticity of the manuscript used by Nicolas for the first part
of the book is questionable in any case, while that supplied by Mirza Yahya is seriously in question. Only

comparative analysis of the extant manuscripts of the Persian Bayán will enable scholars to determine whether or not
the remaining verses translated by Nicolas are true to the original.

104 Bahá’u’lláh takes up this theme is many of His Writings, some passage os which are cited here: “It is incumbent
upon them who are in authority to exercise moderation in all things. Whatsoever passeth beyond the limits of
moderation will cease to exert a beneficial influence.” (Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 216)
“The word of God which the Supreme Pen hath recorded on the ninth leaf of the Most Exalted Paradise is this: In
all matters moderation is desirable. If a thing is carried to excess, it will prove a source of evil.” (Bahá’u’lláh, Tablets
of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 68) “Overstep not the bounds of moderation, and deal justly with them that serve thee. Bestow
upon them according to their needs, and not to the extent that will enable them to lay up riches for themselves, to
deck their persons, to embellish their homes, to acquire the things that are of no benefit unto them, and to be
numbered with the extravagant. Deal with them with undeviating justice, so that none among them may either
suffer want, or be pampered with luxuries. This is but manifest justice.” (Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings from the Writings of
Bahá’u’lláh, p. 235; Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 212) “Fear ye God, and take heed not to outstrip the bounds of
moderation, and be numbered among the extravagant.” (Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 251;
Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 188) “It is incumbent upon them who are in authority to exercise moderation in all
things. Whatsoever passeth beyond the limits of moderation will cease to exert a beneficial influence. Consider for
instance such things as liberty, civilization and the like. However much men of understanding may favourably
regard them, they will, if carried to excess, exercise a pernicious influence upon men.” (Bahá’u’lláh, Tablets of
Bahá’u’lláh, p. 169) “Whoso cleaveth to justice, can, under no circumstances, transgress the limits of moderation. He
discerneth the truth in all things, through the guidance of Him Who is the All-Seeing. The civilization, so often
vaunted by the learned exponents of arts and sciences, will, if allowed to overleap the bounds of moderation, bring
great evil upon men. Thus warneth you He Who is the All-Knowing. If carried to excess, civilization will prove as
prolific a source of evil as it had been of goodness when kept within the restraints of moderation. Meditate on this,
O people, and be not of them that wander distraught in the wilderness of error. The day is approaching when its
flame will devour the cities, when the Tongue of Grandeur will proclaim: ‘The Kingdom is God's, the Almighty, the
All-Praised!’ All other things are subject to this same principle of moderation. Render thanks unto thy Lord Who
hath remembered thee in this wondrous Tablet. All-Praise be to God, the Lord of the glorious throne.”
(Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, pp. 342-343)

105“Confession of sins and transgressions before human beings is not permissible, as it hath never been nor will ever
be conducive to divine forgiveness. Moreover such confession before people results in one's humiliation and
abasement, and God -- exalted be His glory -- wisheth not the humiliation of His servants. Verily He is the
Compassionate, the Merciful.” (Bahá’u’lláh, Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 24)

106Passages from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh that speak to this theme include: “The sinner should, between himself
and God, implore mercy from the Ocean of mercy, beg forgiveness from the Heaven of generosity…” (Bahá’u’lláh,
Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 24) “Wholly unto Thee do I turn, fervently imploring Thee with all my heart, my mind and
my tongue, to shield me from all that runs counter to Thy will in this, the cycle of Thy divine unity, and to cleanse
me of all defilement that will hinder me from seeking, stainless and unsullied, the shade of the tree of Thy grace.”
(‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in Bahá’í Prayers, p. 28)

107Op. cit., p. 150. [Similar passages in Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings include: “Pride not yourselves on much reading of
the verses or on a multitude of pious acts by night and day; for were a man to read a single verse with joy and
radiance it would be better for him than to read with lassitude all the Holy Books of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-
Subsisting. Read ye the sacred verses in such measure that ye be not overcome by languor and despondency. Lay
not upon your souls that which will weary them and weigh them down, but rather what will lighten and uplift them,

so that they may soar on the wings of the Divine verses towards the Dawning-place of His manifest signs; this will
draw you nearer to God, did ye but comprehend.” (Bahá’u’lláh, The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, K149)]

111Makhorka is poor tobacco, cheap tobacco, low grade tobacco. This is typically the kind of tobacco smoked in
waterpipes and by working people and soldiers. “The tobacco generally used in Yemen is tombac, a kind of
makhorka. Rakower and Fatal compared its smoke with that of a popular brand of blended tobacco. The tombac
smoked in the Boori (the pipe bowl) yielded only 16.1 mg of "tar" per gram of tobacco, at a puff volume of 200 ml,
with puff pauses of 60 seconds. The tobacco blend under these conditions yielded 26.2 mg of "tar." Most
remarkable, however, is the filter efficiency of the water in the Shishi, the water-filled main part of the Narghile.
When the Narghile is used with water, as normally practiced, "tar" yield from 1.0 g of tombac is 8.4 mg, and from
1\.0 g of tobacco blend, 14.2 mg. ln other words, the percentage of "tar" absorbed by the water is 82% in the case of
tombac and 91 % for the blended tobacco.” (http://narghile.blogspot.com/2007/03/tribute-to-ernst-l-wynder-

112 “This spice is used as a digestive aid, in food as a condiment and in pickles. Its odor is so strong that it must be
stored in airtight containers; otherwise the aroma, which is nauseating in quantities, will contaminate other spices
stored nearby. However, its odour and flavor become much milder and more pleasant upon heating in oil or ghee,
acquiring a taste and aroma reminiscent of sautéed onion and garlic. In India, it is used especially by the merchant
caste of the Hindus and by adherents of Jaimism, who do not eat onions or garlic. It is used in most vegetarian and
lentil dishes to both add flavor and aroma and reduce flatulence. It is mainly grown in Iran, Afghanistan…Ferula
assafoetida is an herbaceous, monoecious, perennial plant of the family Umbelliferae. It grows to 2 m high with a
circular mass of leaves. Flowering stems are 2.5–3 m high and 10 cm thick, with a number of schizogenous ducts in
the cortex containing the resinous gum. Stem leaves have wide sheathing petioles. Compound large umbels arise
from large sheaths. Flowers are pale greenish yellow. Fruits are oval, flat, thin, reddish brown and have a milky
juice. Roots are thick, massive, and pulpy. It yields a resin similar to that of the stems. All parts of the plant have the
distinctive fetid smell.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asafoetida)
