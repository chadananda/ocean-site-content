(2001)

J.A. McLean

Introduction

Bahá=í scholars have recently begun to direct their attention to the complex but fruitful
relationships between theology and literary criticism, as distinct from exegesis.2 While the
properly literary critical focus of these studies can thus far be characterised as a Afirst look@
approach, this area of research has the potential for considerably enriching the literary-
theological dimensions of Bahá=í Studies for at least two reasons that have much to do with
Across-fertilization.@: (i) In terms of methodology, this perspective will require that scholars
Acorrelate,@ a method recommended by Shoghi Effendi in at least four of his letters that advocates
relating the Bahá=í teachings to A...all the progressive movements and thoughts being put forth
today....@3 (ii) This effort will in turn shed new light on text-rooted studies of the Bahá=í sacred
writings which must also include any considerations of Bahá=í theology.

While I will not attempt an exhaustive survey of this field here, since 1997 four
publications come to mind: John S. Hatcher=s book the Ocean of His Words. A Readers Guide to
the Art of Bahá=u=lláh (1997), Phyllis Perrakis= article ASpiritual Oppression in Frankenstein@
(The Journal of Bahá=í Studies, 1999), Franklin Lewis= article AScripture as Literature:Sifting
Through the Layers of the Text@ (The Bahá=í Studies Review, 1997) and Sen McGlinn=s
polemical in-depth review4 of Hatcher=s the Ocean of His Words in The Bahá=í Studies Review,
(1999/2000). I should not neglect to mention Christopher Buck=s Symbol and Secret.Qur=an

. I refer to deconstructionism rather than simply to deconstruction because this philosophical current has also become
a pervasive mind-set in postmodernity.

.Scholars should exercise care in not erasing the line between scriptural exegesis and literary criticism. While there
are, of course, points of convergence, exegesis, as currently practiced by such textual-translation scholars as Todd Lawson,
Christopher Buck and Stephen Lambden, relies upon data drawn mainly from the field of Islamic and Bábí-Bahá=í studies, while
literary criticism draws upon data from that field while relating any findings to the study of Bahá=í texts and/or theology. Franklin
Lewis= approach, while it remains largely focused on Bahá=u=lláh=s Persian language writings, strikes me as being more in line
with properly literary critical thinking.

.The complete quotation reads: AShoghi Effendi has for years urged the Bahá=ís (who asked his advice and in general
also) to study history, economics, sociology, etc., in order to be au courant with all the progressive movements and thoughts
being put forth today and so that they could correlate these to the Bahá=í teachings.@ From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi
Effendi, July 5, 1947 in The Importance of Deepening our Knowledge and Understanding of the Faith, p. 47. Other references to
correlation are found in letters of August 6, 1933, October 21, 1943 and July 5, 1949.

. While I do not care for either the tone of McGlinn=s ad hominem review, and his accusation of Aa political agenda@
involving the Aforces of conservative religion in the United States@ (p. 199), I agree, in the main, with McGlinn=s arguments.
What struck me, as McGlinn also points out (p. 203), was Dr. Hatcher=s scarce consideration of non-Bahá=í literary critics. There
is only one bibliographic mention in his book. While this omission may have methodological implications, it is puzzling for one
who is a professor of English literature writing about the Aliterary art@ of Bahá=u=lláh. Hatcher=s approach, in this book at least,
has taken no notice of Shoghi Effendi=s recommendation of the method of correlation to non-Bahá=í thought. As McGlinn also
points out (p. 203), Dr. Hatcher, for whatever reason, has omitted any mention of Christopher Buck=s Symbol and Secret (1995),
an omission that does not seem justified in such as study.

Commentary in Bahá=u=lláh=s Kitab-i-Íqán (1995) which has earned some justified praise from
Franklin Lewis.5 But I do so to make a distinction. It forces the terminology, as Sen McGlinn
does in his review of Hatcher, to call Buck=s study Agenre criticism@ (p. 203). However, it does
clearly qualify as academic Bahá=í exegesis, heavily quaranic in content and only incidentally
literary critical since Symbol and Secret does not reflect in content any serious utilisation of
Ablurred genres@6 which was not Buck=s focus in any case.

This paper examines the interface of the dynamic tension that exists between literary
criticism and theology as two distinct but nonetheless mutually interacting and beneficial forms
of discourse. My thesis is that theology and scriptural study stand to greatly benefit from an
adoption of the humanising, existential7/experiential Areal life@ dimensions of literature and
certain currents of critical theory8 that offer insights into the nature of the modes of expression
found in literature inter alia in the act of reading (reader-response theory), rhetoric (rhetorical
criticism), objective and historical criticism, the nature of signs (semiology) and the deeper
structures or patterns that lied embedded within all types of literature (structuralism)

However, a certain selectivity is required when sifting through the literature of this highly
diverse field which has become, according to Hazard Adams, professor of English and
comparative literature at the University of Washington,A...a plethora of competing jargons and
systems, to say nothing of antisystems.@9 One of these antisystems, is the ultra-solipsistic,
postmodern literary critical perspective of deconstructionism, some of whose advocates declare
themselves to be hostile to religion and theology and which envisages, without stint, the death of
God. While theology can be viewed, following Anders Nygren in Meaning and Method (1972),
his magnum opus, as a kind of Aconceptual poetry,@10 it must continue to stand for logocentrism
and the expounding of an objective, propositional belief system.

Theology and Literature (1988)11 how during the twentieth century, theology and particularly
biblical exegesis were informed by the application of literary critical techniques to sacred study.
In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, the literary implications of the Bible are as old as the Bible
itself. Stephen Pricket points out in his chapter ABiblical and Literary Criticism: A History of
Interaction@ in The Bible and Literature. A Reader (1999) that the selection and arrangement of
the books of the canon in the third century CE, in more or less its final form, was in itself A...a
critical and polemical act.@, and that the Bible is A...a monument to intertextuality.@, with, for
example, its constant referals to the life and actions of Jesus as a fulfilment of specific Hebrew
texts.12 In the twentieth century, literary techniques were employed to more closely analyse
biblical literature beginning about 1900. Source criticism13 and form14 and redaction15 criticism,
while they resulted in a scepticism that questioned the vox dei, ipsissima verba of the Bible,
employed basic literary critical techniques to create a more scientific approach to the
understanding of biblical texts.

More recently, the pre-deconstructionist methods of structuralism have greatly influenced
Biblical studies. While structuralism traces its history back to the nature of the sign in the work
of Swiss structural linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, it gained impetus in the 1960=s from the work
of Roland Barthes16 and his 1966 publication Critique et vérité in which Barthes proclaims the
importance of the >science of literature=17 which focused attention away from the interpretation of

particular works to larger philosophic considerations of the meaning of texts. R.C. Culley
summarised well, overstatement notwithstanding, the scientific bent in the structuralist approach
when he wrote that structuralists Aare seeking a method which is scientific in the sense that they
are striving for a rigorous statement and an exacting analytical model.@18 This method seeks to

1999), pp. 12-13.

.Basically source criticism consisted of identifying the relations and influences among the synoptic gospels.

.Form criticism examines the changes in form of the smaller literary units that make up the gospel stories in terms of
their purpose and Sitz im Leben or setting before these stories reached their written stage. Thus, one story might be framed, for
example, with an anti-Jewish polemic in mind. The effect of form criticism produced a certain scepticism since it aruged that
these stories were created for particular theological purposes and their contents shaped to that end rather than issuing directly
from the mouth of Jesus. Hermann Gunkel (1862-1932) a Hebrew Bible scholar who used a history of religions approach
(Religionsgeschichtlicheschule) and Rudolf Bultmann (1884-1976) for the Gospel were two key figures in the form criticism
movement. Dibelius who had studied with Gunkel and Schmidt were other figures in the field. Form criticism was a kind of
genre criticism since it was preoccupied with oral traditions and their historical contexts.

.Redaction criticism (Tendenzkritik) examines the manner in which the final editors of biblical texts molded the ealier
sources into their final form.

.Barthes later became disenchanted with the pseudo-scientific certainties of structuralism and helped to formulate
deconstructionist theories of language.

uncover deeper, underlying patterns and structures common to literature itself or to modes of
expression such as myth, metaphor, symbol or rhetoric which purport to give definitive
interpretations of literature. Saussure=s Course in General Linguistics in Geneva (1916) also
became the model for Russian formalism and semiotics (semiology) and influenced
deconstructionism. Other structuralists, including Barthes himself, have softened the harder
approach which was the legacy of de Saussure=s linguistics. Concurrent with the development of
today=s deconstructionism, present preoccupations have included studies based on the centrality
of story in theology (narrative theology)19 and the modes of expression mentioned above as found
in sacred texts.

Apart from the recommendation of general hermeneutical principles which have largely a
pre-Bahá=í history,20 and while they may be implicit to Bahá=í scripture itself, there is no mention
in the Bahá=í sacred writings (understandably), or the commentaries of Shoghi Effendi, of any
specific literary critical techniques and schools, at least as employed by western scholars.
However, >Abdu=l-Bahá specifically mentioned the acquisition of A...science, arts and belles
lettres...@ to a student who had queried him about the pursuit of his education as A... a matter
which is acceptable before God and a duty which is incumbent upon us to accomplish.@21
Comparing the ACause of God@ to a college, >Abdu=l-Bahá reportedly said in another
circumstance: AThe college is founded for the sake of the acquirements of science, arts and
literature.@,22 a closely worded parallel of his advice to the student cited above. By extension, it is
not a far step to conclude that this endorsement of the study of literature would also have to
include any of those more progressive critical techniques that scholars estimate would contribute
to a deeper understanding of sacred literature.

.John C. Hoffman in AMetaphorical or Narrative Theology@ challenges the assumption of theologian of metaphor,
Sallie McFague (Speaking and Parables, Metaphorical Theology) that: (1) metaphor is the definitive element in human
understanding (2) metaphor best guards against Aabsolutizing our theological concepts@ (pp. 173-74). Studies in
Religion/Sciences Religieuses , vol. 16, no. 2, Spring, 1987, pp. 173-85. While Hoffman argues that Awe look to narrative as our
key interpretive category@ (p. 174), in so doing he presents a balanced view of McFague=s arguments, with which he in part
agrees.

. I am thinking here of such things as the employment of Aplain sense@ and figurative interpretations of scripture or
that microcosmic and macrocosmic interpretation (the part interprets the whole and the whoe interprets the part) which is a
variation of the principles that scripture interprets itself.. References in Bahá=í scripture to Ainner@(esoteric) (bátin) and Aouter
(záhir) meaning@ basically have to do with literal and figurative interpretation. Shoghi Effendi=s endorsement of holistic
interpretation (letter of July 5, 1947), which is quite modern in approach, has its counterpart in other interpretive techniques.
Bahá=u=lláh=s prohibtion of the figurative interpretation of ritual or legal texts in the Aqdas may be a specifically Bahá=í
interpretive rule.

. ANow as to what thou askest concerning giving up the scientific attainment in Paris for the sake of confining thy
days to the delivery of this Truth, it is indeed acceptable and beloved, but if thou acquire both it would be better and more
perfect, because in this new century the attainment of science, arts and belles lettres, whether divine or worldly, material or
spiritual, is a matter which is acceptable before God and a duty which is incumbent upon us to accomplish. Therefore, never
deny the spiritual things to the material, rather both are incumbent upon thee@ (>Abdu=l-Bahá, Baha'i World Faith, pp. 376-377).

.>Abdu=l-Bahá, cited in The Importance of Deepening, p. 203.

While Bahá=u=lláh=s writings contain pervasive allusions to the religio-cultural
antecedents which he inherited (Persian, Sh=ih Islamic and partly Sufistic), while creatively
structured, these writings are composed, in the main, from ordinary, everyday speech. This is also
true of Shoghi Effendi=s English language writings which have been largely shorn of Islamic
allusions,23 except when they treat of the Afalling fortunes of sh=íh Islám@ or Athe collapse and fall
of the Muslim Caliphate.@24 While the impact of prophetic revelation language is extraordinary,
the building blocks of speech, which precedes writing in all cultures and which de Saussure
privileged over writing,25 are prosaic but transformed by the power of Spirit into enduring
monuments or verbal icons. Thus revelation language, while at the scholarly level, will be
susceptible to specialised study, at the first level of faith-engendering, it requires no technical
expertise for understanding and is entirely democratic and liberal in its offerings. (But literacy
must be assumed if we speak of the act of reading rather than the act of listening).

In this prosaic language, however, we encounter the paradox of simplicity. The Aordinary@
language of divine revelation can conceal the most abstruse of philosophical theological
problems. Indeed Bahá=u=lláh alludes to the complete verbal insufficiency of language to convey
truth. What type of Atruth@ the Persian Prophet alludes to here few of us can know: AHow great
the multitude of truths which the garment of words can never contain! How vast the number of
such verities as no expression can adequately describe, whose significance can never be
unfolded, and to which not even the remotest allusions can be made!@26 Sometimes, Bahá=u=lláh
declares, the logical codes of language are completely broken as for the lovers who find
themselves in the third of Bahá=u=lláh=s Four Valleys (Chahár Vádí): ATo them all words of sense
are meaningless, and senseless words are full of meaning.@27 The simplicity of words betrays,
then, any simplicity of meaning.

While much ink has flowed to explain the nature of specifically religious language,
compared to its more literal,28 scientific formulations, Joseph Keller comments on the ability of

.The foregoing should not be taken as a blanket statement. There are, of course, several references to Islam within the
letters and commentaries of the Guardian. But, unlike the writings of the Three Central Figures, Shoghi Effendi=s English-
language writings are not grounded in an Islamic religio-cultural context. However, Shoghi Effendi in his treatments of Islam
makes a
clear distinction between Islam, as it exists ideally, and Islam as it is practiced, particularly in the hostile reception that Islam
accorded to the Báb and Bahá=u=lláh.

.The Promised Day is Come, pp. 90-99 (check). Shoghi Effendi quotes Bahá=u=lláh on the fall of Islam: ABy your
deeds,@ He, in another Tablet, anticipating the fall of the Sultanate and the Caliphate, thus reproves the combined forces of Sunni
and Shi=ih Isam, Athe exalted station of the people hath been abased, the standard of Islam hath been reversed, and its mighty
throne hath fallen@ ( The Promised Day is Come, p. 61).

ordinary language, of which revelation language is a special creation, to engender what is at the
heart of all religious experience--a sense of communion (and community).While Keller=s context
is interpersonal communication, this sense of communion is achieved no less in the Speaker-
listener relationship, while reading or listening to sacred utterance, as the soul responds in kind to
be of one accord with the grammar of revelation:

The study of literature, moreover, fleshes out existential moments which have the effect
of grounding propositional or belief system theoria in concrete Ahistorical@30 events, even those
of a quotidian nature. >Abdu=l-Bahá=s reinterpretation of the resurrection story, not only makes an
anti-literalist argument, but also, while including it, transcends metaphor to recognize the
existential quality of human existence as a moment of test and transformation, an interpretation,
moreover, whose perspectival focus has been validated by Rudolf Bultmann who presumably
know nothing of >Abdu=l-Bahá=s explanation. Bultmann=s existential reinterpretation would have
it that the resurrection myth A...expresses the disciples= experience of reorientation as a result of
communion with Christ.@31 But such an interpretation obviously does not take place from within
the context of the culturally conditioned and relative terms of modern existentialism. As I have
written elsewhere, the Aexistential moment@ of Atest and transformation@ is a perennial condition
of the human soul, and not culturally conditioned, one in which AThe image of the hidden higher
self is seeking definition and desires to come clear.@32 It is a condition in which all believers find
themselves everywhere and always. Here is >Abdu=l-Bahá=s exist-ential interpretation of the
resurrection story:

.By a historical event I refer either to a Aworld-shaping@ (Shoghi Effendi) event of magnitude, either in the life of the
Divine Manifestation, his followers, or on the stage of world history or a less determinative quotidian event in the life of the
ordinary believer. A historical event is any meaningful happening. In my essay AThe Possibilities of Existential Theism for
Bahá=í Theology@ I have argued that the theistic existential perspective deserves a place in Bahá=í theology because: (i) it is
implicit to Bahá=í scripture. (ii) it relates Areal life@ situations to a process of spiritual transformation (iii) it is reflected in Bahá=í
and non-Bahá=í history in Athe acts and events in the lives of the prophets and spiritual teachers....@ (p. 201). Revisioning the

expresses the essence of Athe existential moment.@

Therefore, we say that the meaning of Christ=s resurrection is as follows: the disciples
> were troubled and agitated after the martyrdom of Christ. The Reality of Christ, which
> signifies His teachings, His bounties, His perfections and His spiritual power, was hidden
> and concealed for two or three days after His martyrdom, and was not resplendent and
> manifest. No, rather it was lost, for the believers were few in number and were troubled
> and agitated. The Cause of Christ was like a lifeless body; and when after three days the
> disciples became assured and steadfast, and began to serve the Cause of Christ, and
> resolved to spread the divine teachings, putting His counsels into practice, and arising to
> serve Him, the Reality of Christ became resplendent and His bounty appeared; His
> religion found life; His teachings and His admonitions became evident and visible. In
> other words, the Cause of Christ was like a lifeless body until the life and the bounty of
> the Holy Spirit surrounded it.33

While >Abdu=l-Bahá=s interpretation removes the resurrection from the category of literal
fact, it becomes nonetheless a historical event since it really happened. While it is not given to
every generation to live during the lifetime of the Prophet, Awhen God walked among men,@ the
sense of being lost and then found, of losing and rediscovering one=s identity, which Northrop
Frye34 says is A...the framework of all literature.@35 is a universal element for both theistic and
non-theistic persuasions and is common to all >times and climes.= >Abdu=l-Bahá=s commentary,
not only underscores the triumphal power of apostolic Christianity, but also makes an allusion to
this loss and recovery of self and identity among the disciples.

While literature has close associations with what philosopher Arthur O. Lovejoy called
Athe history of ideas@ in The Great Chain of Being (1936) and in Essays in the History of Ideas
(1948),36 it does not, unlike theology, repose on a series of propositions. Literature will admit
only language, imagination and human experience as the three basic elements in its catechism of
letters. Literature takes no a priori account of the faith state which is the distinguishing feature
of religion and is presumed in the study of theology. Religiosity will serve only as one of the
elements in the literary world. The literary critical view provides, consequently, a countervening
and balancing focus, one that sets literary scholarship, not over and against faith, but sensitizes
the fixed belief system to A...the range of human experience in the human condition@, the
A...massive intertextual allusion...@ of scripture and its Alyrical beauty.@37 ARevelation@ in literature

must occur along a human horizon, within those lateral connections of what human beings
reveal to themselves within the dimensions of a human apocalypse. Frye writes: ALiterature is a
human apocalypse, man=s revelation to man, and criticism is not a body of adjudications, but the
awareness of that revelation, the last judgement of mankind.@38 This last sentence hints at Frye=s
preference for literature over religion as a body of non-dogmatic, non-judgemental insights into
the human condition.

While Prickett=s phrase A...the range of human experience in the human condition.@ is only
a general indicator, it does for all its generality validate what is both natural and supernatural in
our own existence --for human experience includes a strong sense of the supernatural--; i.e. that
we live in a horizontal world which interacts with a continually imploding vertical
transcendental Reality. The literary critical approach can bring into focus the unaltered, Areal@
human dimensions of spirituality and makes us more deeply aware of the continuous interaction
of the divine and the human realms. Such an experiential approach tends to soften, harmonize
and relativise the propositional, narrowly dialectic and didactic, more or less fixed interpretations
that one finds both in scripture and theology with the what is happening now or in light of the
ever-recurring human experience. Thus, the literary critical path puts a human face on the
unconditional, absolute requirements of the dictates of faith expressed in scripture or theology
and helps to create understanding through the locus of human consciousness and experience
which are also gifts from God.

Polemical Reflections on Deconstructionism

At the outset, it bears noting that deconstructionism is not just a literary critical school. It
is also an ideology,39 used here in its coercive or negative sense, the reason why I name it
deconstructionism, rather than calling it by its more familiar name of deconstruction. The phrase
Adeconstructing an argument@ has passed into the language and has received, inter alia,
journalistic recognition. This main thrust of this ideology is perhaps the following: its absolute
relativisation of the truth. There are no absolute truths for deconstructionists; neither would there
be any universal truths since languages, they argue, are culturally bound and are necessarily
structurally relative in that they organise thought and provide a world view. One can understand
how these arguments would be inimical to the claims of revelation and the positing of the belief
systems of religion which are intended to transcend cultural barriers. For the deconstructionist,
language has a greater power than truth and, in a sense, is always struggling with truth. For a
Bahá=í, language functions in the service of truth and would be the vehicle to unlock it secrets.
>Abdu=l-Bahá says: A... the function of language is to portray the mysteries and secrets of human
hearts. The heart is like a box, and language is the key. Only by using the key can we open the
box and observe the gems it contains.@40 Thus, the function of language is to unveil these

.The Educated Imagination, p. 44.

.The word ideology can have both positive and negative connotations. T.R. Wright defines ideology in Theology and
Literature (1988) simply as Aa set of concepts and practices which form our understanding of ourselves and the world@ (p. 16).
But in its agenda-driven, hard-line politicised form, it represents a coercive idea. As history informs us , totalitarian regimes
always rely on ideologies. These forms of ideology are destructive of freedom of expression. While deconstructionists would be
the first to deny that they are opposed to freedom of expression, deconstructionism is a negative philosophy since it negates the
very idea that one can find truth. Its goal becomes the destruction of the common consensus.

mysteries; i.e. to make truth statements.

Consequently, despite the humanising influence of literature and the literary critical
Acolor filter,@41 theologians and religionists have good reasons to resist importing holus bolus
deconstructionist or pervasively relativist currents of critical theory which would have
deleterious consequences for the sacred study. But deconstructionism, vis-à-vis religion has gone
a step farther. It is self-professedly allied with the death of God and atheism. Deconstructionist
philosophers of language are fond of quoting Nietzsche=s mottoes such as >truths are illusions of
which we have forgotten that they are illusions@ and >there are no facts, only interpretations.=42
Much of this anti-theological writing comes from France. Aside from the philosopher of
language, Jacques Derrida, the current guru of deconstructionism, who is opposed to fixed
meanings of any kind, Julia Kristeva, feminist, philosopher of language and practicing
psychoanalyst, A...claims that >poetic language= is >the enemy of religion=, disrupting the
constraints of >transcendental rationality=, reactivating libidinal drives supressed by the reason.@43

However, Kristeva=s assertion is not obvious. Purely poetical and theological language
can work well in bifocal concert. I take here only one example, the Sufi expression Athe Sun of
Truth@(Per.=shams-i-haqiqat) which is used pervasively in Bahá=í scripture as a central metaphor.
This poetical expression refers to the station of prophethood and as such it has a proper
theological meaning. Yet, both as metaphor or symbol and theological truth, the expression
contains a latent proliferation of meanings. A cluster of images and relationships are illustrated in
the following heuristic44 examples:45 It is to be noted that these examples are both pictorial-
poetical and conceptual-theological. Although it occurs that the poetical uses of this language

For deconstructionists A...there is no ultimate meaning to the text or to the world.

Literature functions rather like striptease, to quote the fictional Morris Zapp, holding out the
>promise of an ultimate revelation which is infinitely postponed.= The text never allows itself to
be possessed; the role of the reader is merely to take pleasure in teasing.=@50 The fluidity of poetic
language, according to Roland Barthes, one of the founding theorists of deconstruction, defines it
as an Aanti-theological activity@ and leads ultimately to the death of God. Barthes writes: A...by
refusing to assign a >secret=, an ultimate meaning, to the text (and the world as text), liberates
what may be called an anti-theological activity, an activity that is truly revolutionary since to
refuse to fix meanings is, in the end, to refuse God and his hypostases --reason, science, law.@51

Such a refusal, were it to be fully applied, would not only mock, but destroy the
foundations of western civilisation-- such as they are. One has to wonder what kind of liberation
would intervene with the cancellation of the logocentric basis of religion and theology,
philosophy, science and law and how they would continue to function. Such a prospect does not

seem to concern the deconstructionists who have made a god of the Aplay@ of language. These
theorists have, at least, been partly logical with their anti-logical logic by carrying the
implications of their revolutionary theories through to their ultimate conclusions. Although they
have imputed to logocentrism, with what they view as its monolithic, authoritarian systems, a
veritable Pandora=s box of evils that have been visited upon the world--death, alienation,
intellectual tyranny, suppression of minorities and the underprivileged-- the very demons they
have sought to destroy have proven to be very elusive and resistant. Hydra-like, the god logos
has reappeared, imposing semantical Aorder@ on the very theories from which they sought to
banish him. Despite Derrida=s disclaimer that AI don=t destroy the subject: I situate it.@,52 just
where the subject fits into semantic space is anybody=s guess.

Scholar of romantic literature and objectivisit critic M.H.Abrams (1912-), an upholder of
the humanisitic tradition which operates according to the acceptance of the rationality inherent in
linguistic conventions, in a polemical essay which deplores what has become of AThe Age of
Criticism@ in the newer AAge of Reading,@ points to Derrida=s Ascience of nescience.@53 Abrams
writes: AI shall try to break through with a crashing generalization:As a philosopher of language,
Derrida is an absolutist without absolutes.@54 Derrida=s subtle deconstruction of the logocentric
notion of language must lead to the conclusion that any traditional understanding of meaning has
become meaningless.: A...since there is no such ground, there is no stop to the play of undecidable
meanings.@55 Abrams quotes Derrida: AThe absence of a transcendental signified extends the
realm and play of signification to infinity.@56 However, Derrida is perceptive enough not to
commit a reductio ad absurdum. Language, if we need to be told, still works. A...it gets its job
done.@57

Disclaimers notwithstanding, the understanding of deconstructionist theories depends
upon a common understanding of their contents. To argue that the element of logocentrism does
not apply to a deconstructionist reading of texts, is to argue against any common understanding
of deconstruction itself, the Aat least this much@ scenario. While deconstructionist interpreters
may have shifted the meaning of logocentrism away from the Acenter= of the authority of texts by
an admixture of semantic solipsism and Afree play,@ to lighten the onerous and joyless work of
the exegete, the fact remains that any advocacy of a deconstructionist current argues in favour of
the perception of a common core of intellectual factors. Stephen Bonnycastle in his epilogue

gives seven common elements of postmoderism which are based largely on deconstructionist

readings of texts.58 One can defer meaning only so long (différance).59

Derrida=s critique of logocentrism applies, of course, to any understanding of God and to
all the attendant theologies that attempt to explain God. The world religions, despite their
internal differences, are all systems that are also based on logocentrism as it exists within divine
revelation. Yet for all the anti-religious flavour of deconstructionism, biblical hemerneutics had
already centuries ago anticipated certain of the deconstructionist concerns. One of Derrida=s
teachers was the French Jewish phenomenologist philosopher and Talmudic commentator
Emmanuel Lévinas (1906-1995), whose ethical writings focused on the neighbourliness of the
presence of Athe other.@60 Susan A. Handelman and Daniel Boyarin argue that ADerrida=s brilliant
and tireless exercises in literary readings emerge...out of his background in Rabbinic thought
with its midrashic intertextuality and its sense of struggle with and for the text.@61 Another
Jewish scholar, Geoffrey H. Hartman, argues that a text such as the story of Jacob=s wrestling
with the angel at Peniel in Genesis 32:1-22 >keeps alive the irreducible asymmetries and
superfluidities which constitute the mystery....=62 of such a text. The rabbis, it would seem,
moreover, were good deconstructionists and their endless conversations with God through the
Hebrew Bible were (are) a perpetual safeguard against closures of meaning: AWith the rabbis we
are reminded that the Bible resists closure and conclusion, its endless writing demanding an
endless exercise of reading and re-reading, writing and re-writing within the whole enterprise of
literature in all ages.@63

In a passage which refers to the Atwofold language@ (Aoutward@ and Aveiled and
concealed@) employed by the Prophets, Bahá=u=lláh indicts the pervasive use of the literal
interpretation of scripture when he reveals:

> In such utterances, the literal meaning, as generally understood by the people, is not what
> hath been intended. Thus it is recorded: AEvery knowledge hath seventy meanings, of
> which one only is known amongst the people. And when the Qa=im shall arise, He shall
> reveal unto men all that which remaineth.@ He also saith: AWe speak one word, and by it
> we intend one and seventy meanings; each one of these meanings we can explain.64

.Derrida has created his own literary critical vocabulary. One of his key terms is the complex différance which is
coined out of différer (to defer) and différence (difference). Basically, it signifies a differing with which is based on both a
deferring (of meaning) and a difference. Derrida has been accused of sophistry on this one since he claims that différance is

This passage also implies a rejection of any finality in interpretation and hints at what
>Abdu=l-Bahá called A... an esoteric meaning@65 to scripture. For Bahá=u=lláh not only is telling us
that the Promised One is the Supreme Exegete and that when he arises his dispensation will
witness an explosion of knowledge, but also that there are other meanings to the sacred text that
we have not yet imagined. This last point is crucial. The coming of the Promised One,
notwithstanding his definitive interpretations, does not close the door to interpretation but rather
opens it. Since each letter in Athe Mother Book@ A...is indeed a mother letter...@66, a variorum of
interpretations will arise, both divine and secular. This last point relates directly to the author-
reader relationship. And it is worth noting in this context that Shoghi Effendi often refers to
Bahá=u=lláh as Athe Author of the Bahá= í Revelation@ and >Abdu=l-Bahá as the AAuthor of the
Plan@ (the Divine Plan) which would seem to be an endorsement of the Divine Revelator as being
included within the category of author, perhaps as the Author of authors.

In the number symbolism of the Bible, the number seventy, which reappears in the Hadith
cited above, is simply a comprehensive number that refers to a large, significant number. The
seventy meanings of scripture derive from the Apolysemous@ (polysemic) nature of the divine
word. A word employed by modern literary critics, polysemous was used by Dante (1265-1321)
during the Middle Ages in his Epistola X to Can Grande which established a four-fold method
for traditional Christian exegesis as the literal, allegorical (mystical), moral and anagogical67
senses. Dante=s notion of scripture as having A more senses than one@,68 as explicated by
Northrop Frye,69 has a direct bearing on reading either the Bahá=í sacred writings or those of
Shoghi Effendi or, of course, any scripture tout court. Frye cautions against interpreting Dante=s
Apolysemous@ as simply relative Adifferent meanings.@ Frye=s reading relates the exegetical act to
the root image of Dante=s word, the seed, which Frye interprets as A...different intensities or
wider contexts of a continuous sense, like a plant unfolding out of a seed.@70 This suggests that
there must be an internal consistency in any systematic interpretation, rather than just a series of
random, disconnected readings.

There are other considerations in the tensions created by the theological-literary critical
interface. Barthes writes of the Adeath of the author.@71 But where we do go after the author has

died? We have to go, of course, to the text, or, as the modern literary critic might have it, to the
theorist himself, who has become a kind of substitute author. Literary critical theory has become
increasingly detached from the understanding of literature as an aid to comprehension with the
result that a highly diverse and subjective mass of material, much of it vacuous, has become an
end in itself. Critical theory is now about understanding critical theory, not about understanding
literature. It is as if musical theory were to replace musical composition. But if we go back to the
text, Derrida tells us that the text has no fixed meaning. There is just the light-hearted play (jeu)
of endless meanings that takes place in the Aspace@ that has been created by the displacement of
the presence of the logos, the Atranscendent signified.@

In a Bahá=í perspective, to speak of the death of the author would be a tremendous
stretch, unless we imagine that in some sacrificial sense the Báb, Bahá=u=lláh and >Abdu=l-Bahá
have died to their own sacred writings and live through them, as a reflection of a total
consecration to the Will of God. But it would be more true to say that the Divine Revelators, far
from having died to their writings, live again and again in and through their divine utterances,
one of the Prophet=s greatest proofs,72 each time a seeker takes up the sacred word either for
instructional or devotional purposes.

If some postmoderns are really on a quest Ain search of authority,@73 as the title of Stephen
Bonnycastle=s book would indicate, then Bahá=u=lláh=s authoritative word, despite the anti-
hierarchical bent of postmodernism, bears consideration:

O friend of mine! The Word of God is the king of words and its pervasive influence is
incalculable. It hath ever dominated and will continue to dominate the realm of being. The Great
Being saith: The Word is the master key for the whole world, inasmuch as through its potency
the doors of the hearts of men, which in reality are the doors of heaven, are unlocked. No sooner
had but a glimmer of its effulgent splendour shone forth upon the mirror of love than the blessed
word >I am the Best-Beloved= was reflected therein.It is an ocean inexhaustible in riches,
comprehending all things. Every thing which can be perceived is but an emanation therefrom.
High, immeasurably high is this sublime station, in whose shadow moveth the essence of
loftiness and splendour, wrapt in praise and adoration.74

A Word not like other words. To return to Joseph Keller=s point, if we apply
deconstructionist views of language to sacred scripture, we find indeed, not just a deconstructive

.ASay: The first and foremost testimony establishing His truth is His own Self. Next to this testimony is His
Revelation. For whoso faileth to recognize either the one or the other He hath established the words He hath revealed as proof of
His reality and truth. This is, verily, an evidence of His tender mercy unto men.@ (Bahá=u=lláh, Gleanings, p. 105). It is
noteworthy that in this passage Bahá=u=lláh places His ASelf@ and His ARevelation@ as ranking ahead of Athe words He hath
revealed...@ This implies that the ARevelation@ is a broader dimension than the Awords@. Perhaps this Revelation is the revelation
of the entire cosmos. We have here a reversal of traditional theological understanding since the Word is usually viewed as
having engendered (and is engendering) the cosmos.

process taking place, but a veritable de-struction of any sense of communion or community,
which lies at the heart of religion; whether it be communion with God, with like-minded
individuals, or even with oneself. Ultra-solipsistic theories are just as people-alienating as the
monolithic systems that they condemn. If logocentric religious systems are monolithic and
totalitarian, deconstructionist anti-systems suffer from the defect of anarchy, which for
deconstructionists seems to be a cause for celebration since everyone can legitimately stake out
his territory. The deconstructionist anti-monument is literally built on air, is A...just an interplay
of phonemes, morphemes...,@75 which is reminiscent of the reference in >Abdu=l-Bahá=s prayer to
the mere Amurmur of syllables and sounds,@a murmur that needs to be transcended by Athe holy
ecstasy of prayer@...in which...Aall things may be merged into nothingness before the revelation of
Thy splendor.@76 The deconstructionist anti-monument has become a modern Tower of Babel at
whose foot those who seek after meaning and substance pass by one another and distractedly
exclaim: AI can=t understand you. What do you mean?@ This situation creates a climate of
oppression either by default and/or negativity. For as Bahá=u=lláh reminds us in the Kitáb-I-Iqán
as he comments on Christ=s parousia text beginning AImmediately after the oppression of those
days....@ in Matthew 24:29-31:

> What Aoppression@ is more grievous than that a soul seeking the truth, and wishing to
> attain unto the knowledge of God, should know not where to go for it and from whom to

Conclusion

By making its referent the human condition, literature and literary criticism can put an
existential human face on the analytical, propositional world of theology and the ideal, rigorous,
precepts of scripture. Despite the shifting fluidities of deconstruction, theology, while being
cognizant of the varieties of meaning inherent to scripture, must continue to be logocentric, to
seek and to find objective meanings in words, and to articulate faith-anchored belief systems and
ethical norms. Theological language, unlike deconstruction, which sees no absolute truths
anywhere and which attempts to desystematize and atomise human thought by a process of
