### 1\. Abstract

(From [bahai.haifa.ac.il/pdf/Haleh\_Arbab\_Dec\_11\_abstract.pdf](http://bahai.haifa.ac.il/pdf/Haleh_Arbab_Dec_11_abstract.pdf)): This lecture will examine the cosmopolitan tradition in the context of the discipline of International Relations theory (IR theory). It will also provide a Bahá’í approach to the cosmopolitan model, investigating thereby where the two models meet, where they part, and what contribution(s) the Bahá’í model can offer to this growing tradition in IR. The lecture will be subdivided in three main sections:

1.  It will explore the field of International Relations theory; depict the main debates in the discipline; and underline the context in which cosmopolitan ideas, or cosmopolitanism, has gained renewed interest in IR at large.
2.  The second part of the lecture will focus on the development of the Western cosmopolitan tradition as articulated by the Cynics in ancient Greece, by the philosophies in the Enlightenment, and by IR scholars at present times. This section will look into the main ethical underpinnings of the tradition: the ideas of human unity, universality, and concepts of political unity fostered for a putative international peace. There is, nevertheless, a present sense that ‘cosmopolitanism has gone wrong’ and, thus, I will underline how current cosmopolitan IR seeks to heal the deficiencies of bygone speculations.
3.  Having presented the main issues at stake in IR and the development of cosmopolitanism in the above-mentioned context, the final part of this lecture will focus on the Bahá’í approach to cosmopolitan ideas in International Relations. This section will elaborate upon the ways in which the Bahá’í approach, which is sacred, and from Eastern origins, can make interesting inroads into cosmopolitan IR and contribute to this growing tradition. It will be argued that Bahá’í perspectives can enrich and diversify cosmopolitan IR by underwriting its normative values and reconciling its main divisions.

     The Bahá’í Approach to Cosmopolitan Ideas in International

Relations

Introduction: The Development of International Relations theory

International Relations (IR) has been deemed to be in state of ‘disarray’ and
‘complexity’.1 As a theoretical framework that embeds more tangible social relations,
its state of perplexity and diversity can perhaps be explained by the confusion which
depicts international affairs. Indeed, what is IR theory? International Relations theory
challenges rigid divisions between disciplines, but also poses important questions
within its own disciplinary remit, which in its latter phase concerns the possibilities of
the transformation of world order and the inclusion of new theoretical forms. For a
long time, IR was described as the field that studied the relations between states, hence
‘inter-national’ relations. In the last three decades, it has broadened its spectrum, and
become more than the traditional study of relations between states for such relations
are too restrictive in the context of an increasingly global, hybrid, and constantly
adaptive age – with many sub- and trans-national processes. However, IR does remain
an ‘invisible discipline’: IR borrows, but it is seldom borrowed from.2 Currently,
various theories are advancing claims - or non-claims - about nation-states, human
rights, state-sovereignty, the overused and underspecified term of ‘globalisation’,
social movements, global ethics, gender, migration, and/or difference and identity.3

Current normative ‘trends’ have encouraged the inclusion of a plethora of viewpoints
such as women’s perspectives dubbed ‘feminist’, and also permit the incorporation of
what is considered to be traditionally within the remit of more ‘religious’ perspectives,
such as Bahá’í views on International Relations, and more specifically on
cosmopolitan IR. Cosmopolitanism’s main precept seeks to propound the idea of a
community of mankind standing below, above, and ‘around’ the nation-state.
Cosmopolitanism offers an interesting platform for theorising the ‘international’ and
developing the idea of a common humane habitat, and in this regard, the Bahá’í model
can make interesting inroads. The Bahá’í model is cosmopolitan insofar as its core
values revolve around the principle of the ‘oneness of humankind’ and its ‘corollary of
diversity’, which in the words of ‘Abdu’l’Bahá,4 represent the ‘cornerstone of all the
teachings of Bahá’u’lláh’ and in those of Shoghi Effendi5 ‘the pivot round which all
the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh revolve’.6 Binding Bahá’í cosmopolitan views with a
constantly growing Western secular cosmopolitan field may, as a case in point, offer a
way of reinforcing cosmopolitan IR. The Bahá’í Faith, the youngest world religion,
stems from Eastern origins, namely nineteenth century Persia, and can be depicted by
its diverse world-wide community. The present article looks at how the secular and
Western field of cosmopolitan IR can be rounded out by the Bahá’í approach. In this
article, it is shown that the secular and sacred models in cosmopolitan IR are not
necessarily opposed, and that the Bahá’í approach can assist cosmopolitan IR by
adding new elements whilst reinforcing its normative intents. This article firstly
broadly presents the field of IR theory; secondly, it scrutinises cosmopolitanism and
its main propositions, and finally it examines the Bahá’í approach to cosmopolitan IR.

It is suggested that the Bahá’í model offers a spiritual and more ‘sacred’ avenue to IR,
whilst standing close to its concerns, and complementing and expanding its remit.

Three main debates stand at the centre of IR theory from the time of its first inception
as a discipline in 1919. The first debate concerns the two founding ‘theories’ of the
discipline – liberal internationalism and thereafter realism (realists wrongly dubbed
liberal internationalists ‘idealists’, as realists thought that they drew hasty utopian
conclusions about the nature of world order and politics); the second debate, the
‘behavourial revolution’, pervaded the social sciences in the 1960s; and since the
1990s the third debate lies between positivist (that is scientific accounts of world
politics) and non-positivist approaches, that is, the view that social sciences cannot be
approached in the same way as physical sciences and that we cannot test ‘one theory’
or set of facts to explain ‘social order’ and ‘human beings’. IR feminists7 describe this
as ‘embedded knowledge’, or, a knowledge which cannot be completely value-neutral,
because the observer is co-related to her or his research by specific conditions and
influences such as culture, language, religion, class, gender and other factors.8 In this
regard, knowledge becomes entangled with, and informed by, our sensitivities and
particularities, and may be shaped by the experiences of those normally excluded from
‘conventional’ knowledge, thereby inviting novel, or more accurately marginalised,
voices. Knowledge, in critical IR, is not neutral: rather, it is ethically charged as it
seeks to de-legitimise usual ways of looking at the world by challenging its main
features.

Realism has long been the ‘main theory’ in IR and remains with its counterpart neo-
realism classical theories, but they have since then been dethroned. Realism is
essentially a pessimistic and non-progressivist world-view9 that places states and
sovereignty at the centre-stage of IR, and undermines the possibility of valuable
change in world politics. Its main proposition lies in the suggestion that world politics
is divided along domestic and international spheres, which cannot be reconciled due to
the, allegedly, condemned nature of the ‘international’. ‘Power’, ‘recurrence’, ‘fixity’,
and ‘anarchy’ are usually utilised to describe the wider international non-state domain.
Kenneth Waltz, the father of neo-realism, portrayed three images as an impediment to
the transformation of world order: 1) a fallen human nature (in classical realism) 2) the
constitution of states 3) the nature of the international order as anarchic and
functioning according to a self-help system.10 Other propositions also function on a
quasi- realist basis: this is the case of Samuel Huntington’s infamous thesis The Clash
of Civilizations in which there is fated antagonism between diverse ‘civilisations’;
according to critics, this vision ignores the differences within civilisations, and the
historical relationships that have taken place between them.11 Nation–states, here, are
substituted for belligerent civilisations.

Realism – which is actually not to be confounded with being realistic and associated
with names such as E.H. Carr and Hans Morgenthau – came as a response to liberal
internationalism, the first paradigm in IR co-related with leaders such as Woodrow
Wilson and the creation of the League of Nations. Liberal internationalism posits that
a peaceful society is possible if it abides by certain principles of international law and

morality that sustain a collective security – an image praised by the Bahá’í model
insofar as it seeks to create co-operation based on institutions of global governance.
Realism and liberal internationalism, as the two conventional IR ‘theories’, have been
thereafter complemented by many others, such as neo-realism, the English School
(inspired by the idea of an international society of states and containing a ‘mediating’
ground between realist and liberal international elements), and a number of critical
theories, including feminist theory, critical international theory, post-structuralism and
post-modernism. The third debate – the current stage at which IR finds itself – is
situated between positivist and non-positivist theories such as critical theories, which
as it was mentioned, seek to include perspectives that are not only positivist, but also
moral. Fred Halliday writes:

> … [N]o human agent … whether academic or not, can rest content with
> facts alone: all social activity involves moral questions, of right and
> wrong, and these can, by definition, not be decided by facts. In the
> international domain such ethical issues are pervasive: the question of
> legitimacy and loyalty – should one obey the nation, a broader community
> (even the world, the cosmopolis), or some smaller sub-national group, the
> issues of intervention – whether sovereignty is a supreme value or whether
> states or agents can intervene in the internal affairs of states; the question
> of human rights and their definition and universality.12

Critical IR contends that the more knowledge privileges certain viewpoints, the more
it occludes diverse perspectives, such as those of women, children, and minorities.
Gender, for example, is a way of interrogating conventional knowledge. Feminist
theorists’ main assumption is that IR has traditionally favoured gendered perspectives
that generate an imbalanced and ‘taken-for-granted’ masculine reality. Consequently,
the inclusion of diverse perspectives and life experiences are vital to the
transformation of world order as this process uncovers untraditional viewpoints and
ideas which may shape theories, and thus, realities. ‘It broadens the base’, according to
a critical scholar, ‘from which we derive knowledge, but also because the perspectives
of … marginalized people may reveal aspects of reality obscured by more orthodox
approaches of knowledge-building’.13 Entertaining the possibility of transformation
has been named ‘normative’, that is, the possibility of transforming world order in
ways that are unthinkable to present ‘realities’. Karin Fierke, for instance, speaks of
denaturalising the present and to ‘look again, in a fresh way, at that which we assume
about the world because it has become overly familiar.’14

The importance of including a more sensitive, broad, and inclusive approach in
International Relations has a specific aim: that of challenging classical assumptions
about the nature and directions of world order. For example, in realism, if knowledge
is informed by the inevitability of war and violence in the international domain and the
impossibility of enduring peace, it is likely that practices would adhere to such a way
of thinking. This is the ‘dogmatism of knowledge’ as Seyla Benhabib put it.15 The
Universal House of Justice, the international governing body of the Bahá’í Faith,

whilst referring to the stubborn belief in the inherent pugnacity of human nature which
creates lasting antagonism, has called this phenomenon a ‘paralysis of will’. The
paralysis of will, the Universal House of Justice writes ‘… has led to the reluctance to
entertain the possibility of subordinating national self-interest to the requirements of
world order’.16 Indeed, there is a very thin line between both theory and practice in IR.
Theories can influence international order, or often come as a response to specific
crises in the contemporary world,17 and as these crises change, new theoretical
perspectives emerge, not only to explain them, but to act as a prescription. The end of
the Cold War, as a case in point, has opened many doors for theorising IR and
transforming the supposed ‘realities’ of world order. Cosmopolitan political theory, or
cosmopolitanism, represents one of them.

Cosmopolitan Ideas in IR

Cosmopolitanism is an approach or a tradition. It resides within, and is carried by,
several approaches in IR theory; it has survived the great debates; and, suggests an
interesting alternative to the myopic lenses of realism and neo-realism. It has regained
a new vitality in the post-Cold War era, and has been worked and reworked:
cosmopolitanism is, therefore, constantly reconceptualised whilst its main intentions
are safeguarded: the transformation of world order; the realisation that strangeness and
foreignness do not have to guide our moral and political communities; the salience of
every human being – regardless of the many characteristics that may describe her.
Here, it is not despite these categories – race, gender, religion etc… – that we envision

the humanity of beings, but thanks to these categories. Indeed, it has sometimes been
deemed that creating a universal humanity despite these categories tends to merge
universality towards a centre which is defined along hierarchical and homogeneous
lines.18 This had led to a debate between universality and difference and envisaging
both as part of a layered cosmopolitanism: one in which unity is not opposed, but
created by, diversity.19 Cosmopolitanism, at this present stage, views differences, not
as being locked and fixed within defined parameters, but rather as an open and
fluctuating current.

Cosmopolitanism contends that human beings belong to the universal community of
mankind, which should be nurtured. Various strands of cosmopolitanism revolve
around this principal idea, and react against favouring the national state over the
natural community of mankind, or preferring ‘fellow citizens’ to ‘fellow human
beings’. Cosmopolitanism, thus, highlights the limitedness of political communities
(the polis – city-state – was also criticised by ancient Stoicism), which now correlates
to the inadequacy of ‘reasons of state’ or ‘reasons of political communities’, when
their fates are entwined.20 Trans-parochial responsibilities for others and for diversity
represent pivotal cosmopolitan beliefs. Princeton Philosopher Anthony Kwame
Appiah underscores that two strands are entangled within cosmopolitanism:

> [O]ne is the idea that we have obligations towards others, obligations that
> stretch beyond those to whom we are related by the ties of kith and kind,
> or even the more formal ties of citizenship. The other is that we take

seriously the value not just of human life but of particular human lives,
> which means taking an interest in the beliefs and practices that lend them
> significance.21

Cosmopolitanism was, it is said, born into the Cynic and Stoic world where
cosmopolis was firstly conceived as the whole universe in which all living beings were
citizens – not of course, in the literal meaning of the word, but more as an expression
of emotion. The word ‘cosmopolitan’ is derived from the Greek Kosmopolites, which
translates into ‘world citizen’. Diogenes, a Cynic, allegedly first coined the word
‘cosmopolitan’ in the 4rth century BC. For him, cosmopolitanism was not, as it is now
conceived, a way of finding ways to live peacefully on the globe, but more so a way of
rebelling against conformism – actually the Greek word for Cynic derives from the
word ‘Dog’.22 It was also, in the Cynic ideal, a wholesome rejection of the Polis or
city-state: the individual was free roaming and had neither ‘local’ attachments, nor
particularities. Nonetheless, cosmopolitanism is not concerned with replacing, but
supplementing more fixed identities. Indeed, as opposed to this Cynic version, the
Stoics did not wish to replace particular identities with a universal one, but rather
construct a cosmopolitanism which develops from the grassroots level.

Cosmopolitanism aims to complement and build on multiple identities, rather than
destroy human diversity and enriching particularities that it holds to be vital to sustain
a global community. Edmund Burke, for example, stated, ‘to love the little platoon we
belong to in society, is the first principle (the germ as it were) of public affections. It is

the fist link in the series by which we proceed towards a love to our country and to
mankind’.23 Cicero, a Stoic, also contradicts the idea expressed by Rousseau that to be
cosmopolitan is to assert love of mankind as an excuse to really love no-one.24
‘Society and human fellowship’, Cicero delineated, ‘will be best served if we confer
the most kindness on those with whom we are most closely associated’.25 In other
words, it is facile to proclaim love of mankind, states the dubious, but treat the closest
people to us with disdain. This paradox resolves itself. Indeed, cosmopolitanism starts
at home.26 It sees to it that wider human loyalties best serve local interests.27

Furthermore, some of us can now choose the little platoons we wish to live in, and
consequently multiply our identities and experiences. Hence, in addition to pyramidal
forms that stretch from the local to the global vertically, there is also the possibility
that loyalties intersect at various levels horizontally: the very idea of humanity does
not preclude association with multiple communities and more locally situated
identities.28 The significance of the ‘local level’ is more recently expressed by David
Held, who introduced the pioneering paradigm of ‘cosmopolitan democracy’ for
global governance: ‘It is important to clarify that cosmopolitanism is not at
loggerheads with all aspects of state tradition; nor does it deny cultural difference or
the enduring significance of national culture. It is not against cultural diversity. Few, if
any, contemporary cosmopolitans hold such view’.29 This has also crucial institutional
implications: just as identities are seen as multiple and overlapping in the vision of
world citizenship, so institutions of global governance and socio-economic import
must abide by grassroots principles that posit a layered vision of decision-making and

participation. The useful question to pose here is why is cosmopolitanism needed? It
is, indeed, a model to be experimented upon, as political life has demonstrated that
exclusivist parochial and nationalistic models have so far failed to provide a basis
upon which human suffering may decrease.

Many other strands and ideas are expressed within cosmopolitanism. For reasons of
space, it is not possible to delve into them in further detail. It can be said, however,
that Western cosmopolitanism started in the Cynic and Stoic worlds, was carried in the
Enlightenment by authors such as Immanuel Kant and Montesquieu, and other
philosophes.30 It has developed and is being used in late modernity, whether to be
criticised or promoted. It is possible to identify three main strands within
cosmopolitanism: an ethical cosmopolitanism in the style of the Stoics (in which the
oneness of humankind underpins the unity of the universe); a political
cosmopolitanism (in the Enlightenment, this was envisaged as ‘perpetual peace
projects’ now viewed as theoretical precursors to international organisations like the
League of Nations, the United Nations, or the International Court of Justice); and a
more legal cosmopolitanism, in the form of the new International Criminal Court
based on the Nuremberg legacy, and on a human, as opposed to state, unit).

The Bahá’í Model

The Bahá’í Faith provides the means by which IR can add an element which was long
overlooked in world politics: the role of religion for the pacification of international

relations. This joins the revolutionary methodological approach that underpins
subjectivity. Without including other voices which have been overlooked, how can
world order be possibly improved? This is the contention of IR feminists, who
advance that the voices of women have been silenced thereby rendering IR biased and
incomplete. The same applies to religion. How can IR be complete if it ignores
religion? In this regard, religion carries with it moral and ethical values that are
important for the reconfiguration of world politics. The secular world calls these
values ‘ethical’, the sacred ‘spiritual’. They are, nonetheless, converging. One of these
spiritual bases, as it was noted, lies in the concept of the oneness of humanity, as
found in the Bahá’í Writings. Roman Stoics such as Marcus Aurelius – perhaps better
known for his portrayal as Emperor in the Hollywood movie ‘Gladiator’ – pronounced
the bio-ethical principle of the oneness of humanity. It was, nevertheless, an emotional
outburst for ethical speculations. Shoghi Effendi renders this concept more
transformative and salient in its impacts. The oneness of mankind ‘concerns itself’,
Shoghi Effendi states, ‘… primarily with the nature of those essential relationships
that must bind all the states and nations as members of one human family’.31 This
principle, therefore, implicates devising global institutions for the protection of all
members of humanity. Indeed, for ‘Abdu’l’Bahá, the denial of the concept of the
oneness of mankind represents the destroyer of the body politic.32 This invokes that a
spiritual principle is linked to, and consonant with, the design and shape of world
order. The Bahá’í model centralises ethical principles whilst being pragmatic. It
contends that in the transition from a system based on national sovereignty to a more
cosmopolitan formulation of world politics and world order, global values need to

added, nurtured, and fostered. It also envisions the strengthening of international
organisations,33 which will gradually become global in order to respond to the all-
encompassing needs of all the peoples of the world.

The Bahá’í approach is not based upon a rigid formula of International Relations; it
would perhaps be more appropriate to state that it contains a model that is based on
spiritual values and the consensus of the main stakeholders – ‘Abdu’l’Bahá notes that
any system of governance must have at its basis ‘the sanction of the human race’.34
The Bahá’í model on governance also contains defined characteristics that may
channel and bring about the enduring transformation of world order.35 These features
are based upon values of justice and the ethics of oneness. In this regard, the Universal
House of Justice states that, ‘…the primary challenge in dealing with issues of peace is
to raise the context to the level of principle, as distinct from pure pragmatism’.36 Here
we may make the links between IR theories that seek to inform changes, and the
significance of the ‘level of principle’ as expressed in the Bahá’í model by the
Universal House of Justice. The universal governing body of the Bahá’í Faith goes on
to outline, ‘[F]or, in essence, peace stems from an inner state supported by a spiritual
or moral attitude, and it is chiefly in evoking this attitude that the possibility of
enduring solutions can be found’.37 In the Bahá’í model, spiritual aspects, which post-
positivist IR depicts as ‘ethical’ or ‘moral’, are central to world order – or rather world
(dis)order. The Bahá’í model also posits that guidelines on ‘how to live with each
other’ have to do with providing the discipline with more inclusive ethical theories.
Indeed, IR theories, especially in its critical turn, seek to transform political order, and

in this sense, has a practical purpose. The ‘level of principle’ as well as ‘theories’ are
of value to the Bahá’í model inasmuch as they can impact on the realities that we build
for ourselves and for the world. Shoghi Effendi underlined, ‘… if certain social
assumptions … have ceased to promote the welfare of the generality of mankind, if
they no longer minister to the needs of a continually evolving humanity, let them be
swept away and relegated to the limbo of obsolescent and forgotten doctrines.’ Shoghi
Effendi goes on to state that legal standards, economic and political theories are meant
to safeguard all of humanity, proposing thereby a motional and inclusive viewpoint.38

Universality of the Cosmopolitan Tradition

From a Bahá’í perspective, how can we explain the similarities, but also the
differences between the cosmopolitan tradition and the cosmopolitan ethos of the
Bahá’í Faith? For Bahá’ís, as Bahá’u’lláh has infused the world with renewed spiritual
values, and as He has come in the context of a global age, this implicates that
regardless of our denominations and view points, the character of the ‘signs of the
times’ – in the precise phraseology of Kant the ‘historical signs’39 – lies in the urge,
despite many obstacles and vivid conflicts that thwart the world, to cooperate and
unify. In this context, the similarities that could be made between present IR thinking
and its theories on ethical values and global co-operative strategies are not necessarily
at odds with the global and caring spirit which depicts the Bahá’í Faith.

The fact that the Bahá’í Faith has Eastern roots is a remarkable aspect for the
cosmopolitan tradition. One of the current criticisms that is being voiced against the
cosmopolitan tradition and its ideas lay in its exclusive Western lineage. This firstly
ignores the links between civilisations,40 and can act as an impediment to realising the
universality of this tradition. The unity of humankind is neither an exclusive Western
concept, nor necessarily a secular one. It has, in the real sense of the word, a universal
lineage which belongs to all humankind. The Bahá’í faith, by centralising this concept
in its world-view, provides the possibility of the re-appropriation of unity in a diverse
world as a truly global heritage, and not only as a particular one. Furthermore, ‘unity’
does not have to be conceived as a mechanical idea, where by the application of
certain rules and laws, world order is improved; it also partakes in a more ethical and
spiritual basis. In this sense, the ‘rational’ element that has served to depict
cosmopolitanism through the Enlightenment and Modernity in the Western tradition
has been complemented by more ‘divine’ components. ‘Divine’ does not imply the
imposition of world order that descends upon us miraculously, but rather invokes the
association with spiritual values and the vital role of human agency that permeate
global solidarity.

In addition to being rational beings, and subjective beings, we are also spiritual beings.
Rational power is substituted for, or rather complemented by, spiritual empowerment.
Reason serves to allow the human mind to make decisions by which it can reinvent the
world. The Bahá’í model provides ethical and spiritual elements to our beings that
humble raw rationality, and questions the atomistic view of human beings as clearly

independent, autonomous, and severed from each other (cosmopolitans identify this
feature of ‘atomisation’ as ‘egalitarian individualism’). This is not necessarily
contradictory to the post-positivist phase in IR which has criticised the view that
utilitarian reason can solve all problems on its own. The Bahá’í model calls for a
wider conception of human beings, who are related to each other, concerned about
others, and not solely with their own selves. As Bahá’u’lláh, the Prophet-Founder of
the Bahá’í Faith, has written, ‘Let your vision be world-embracing, rather than
confined to your own self’.41 The Bahá’í model challenges androcentric and utilitarian
bases of knowledge. It also undermines the current conception that the role of religion
relies on romantic and foggy conceptions of reality, and is irrelevant to the more
social, public, and global concerns of mankind.

World Citizenship and Loyalty

Debating identities can lead us to develop the notion of ‘world citizenship’. In
Bahá’u’lláh’s words, ‘[T]he earth is but one country and mankind its citizens’,
constitutes a cosmopolitan theme that has clear legal, political, social and spiritual
implications. We are all ‘world citizens’ on planet earth, and also share a common
spiritual home. If mankind constitutes the citizenship of the earth, then we are all
world citizens, we are kosmopolites, we have identities that transcend parochialisms
and insularities. Some may say, ‘well, nobody has asked me whether I would like to
be citizen of such an imaginary realm, it does not exist. I do not have a world
citizenship identity card. There is no world state I can be a citizen of’. Yet, this

conception of world citizenship has a long historical lineage and also has, as
cosmopolitans such as Derek Heater argues, always refused to fade. Insofar as it seeks
to uproot extreme nationalisms, the alternative of world citizenship is at work.

The times in which we live permit us to differentiate between a ‘McDonald’ identity,
and a genuine world citizenship, especially because the contests against
standardisation can underlie identity fundamentalism and romanticism. World
citizenship reveres diversity, and does not call for a standardisation of forms. In the
words of Shoghi Effendi, the world-wide Law of Bahá’u’lláh seeks ‘to broaden the
basis’ of institutions and loyalties, not to eradicate them. Shoghi Effendi pronounces
that the Bahá’í vision of world citizenship ‘can conflict with no legitimate allegiances,
nor can it undermine essential loyalties.’42 We have affiliations and loyalties which
build upon each other, and all of these make us human. These affiliations can be
constantly redefined and put to the test on many corners, especially in an age of
globalisation where our most basic assumptions can be directly challenged by others.
‘Broadening the basis’ of our political institutions and loyalties, as articulated by
Shoghi Effendi in the first half of the twentieth century, has of late been voiced in IR
as a ‘thin’, ‘sensitive’, or ‘rooted cosmopolitanism’.43

This, furthermore, acts as a means to checking a domineering and homogenising
universalism.44 Richard Devetak explains, ‘in recognising the diversity of social bonds
and moral ties, a thin cosmopolitanism ethos seeks to multiply the types and levels of
political community; recognise the community of humanity at the same time as it

recognises regional, national and sub-national associations’.45 This layered form of
world citizenship is not a threat to enriching human diversity. On the contrary, it may
offer a way of enjoying local affiliations. The attribute of world citizenship may also
assist in sharing identities and loyalties, thereby partaking in a discovery that eschews
particularism whilst surpassing it. The Bahá’í view stands against parochialism insofar
as it produces virulent nationalisms; it however values the locality that produces a
‘sane patriotism’.46 Shoghi Effendi writes, ‘[T]he call of Bahá'u'lláh is primarily
directed against all forms of provincialism, all insularities and prejudices’.47 Indeed,
by relying on a singular identity on which we may thrive, find strength and pride, we
can also learn to hate as exemplified by the horrors which occurred in Rwanda and in
the former Yugoslavia. By focusing on exclusionary ‘we-ness’ and exclusive
communities, it is likely that the ‘adversity of exclusion can be made to go hand in
hand with the gifts of inclusion’.48 Our local identities will be maximised if they
stretch, and constantly challenge themselves.

World citizenship has also generated models of dialogue among communities, which
have been termed ‘discourse ethics’, ‘democratic iterations’ or a ‘dialogic
cosmopolitanism’,49 a form of moral conversation in which all are invited.50 Even
though these forms recognise that it might not always be possible to reach agreement,
dialogue does not have to result in consensus, but should reflect diversity, and
heterogeneity of thought. In short, discourse ethics can be linked to world citizenship
and is not based on the fatalistic view that differences impede meaningful discourse.
This can be associated with democratic processes within international organisations,

underlining thereby that people should participate in the global processes and
discussion which affect them in their daily lives. Here, Bahá’í communities can make
a real contribution to these forms of dialogue and build upon the possibilities inherent
in language. Bahá’í examples also lead to the realisation that these forms of
communication are not utopian, and have real outcomes insofar as they provide an
inclusive and practical framework that lead to action. Bahá’í communities have
developed, through what is termed ‘consultation’, a mode of discourse that embodies
diversity whilst forsaking antagonistic and powerful communicative forms that ignore
multiplicity, exchange, and diverse opinions. This form of dialogue, here, can
significantly impact on cosmopolitan IR.

Discussion also importantly engages the question of world citizenship education in
order to recognise our shared membership of humankind and multiple identities.
Furthermore, by adopting a preventive approach that revolves around the education of
children, the Universal House of Justice writes, ‘[I]n keeping with the requirements of
the times, consideration should also be given to teaching the concept of world
citizenship…’51 The Bahá’í model preferably seeks to solve possible problems before
they may occur: it offers a preventive, spiritual, basis that engages unity.52 Professor
Patrick Thornberry, member of Committee on the Elimination of Racial
Discrimination (CERD) at the United Nations, argues in this context that world
citizenship education, which he terms ‘pro-tolerance education’, is one of the crucial
safeguards, but neglected means, for tackling racism and ethnic conflicts.53

The great challenge that we face, indeed, is the realisation that through our
differences, there is a common responsibility for the human fate, as advanced by
cosmopolitan scholars. In Bahá’ú’lláh’s words, ‘the earth is but one country and
mankind its citizens’, as the words ‘citizens’ and therefore ‘citizenship’ imply, evoke
responsibilities as well as human rights on the global plane.54 This is a revolutionary
idea especially when life chances and opportunities depend so much on contingent
places of birth.55 Currently, many critical scholars link the concept of world
citizenship to shouldering responsibility for the global commons, the environment, the
eradication of poverty, and the fate of ‘strangers’ outside as well as within nations.

Indeed, favouring ‘co-citizens’ has given way to caring for the fate of ‘co-humans’ –
and it is interesting indeed that the phrase the ‘earth is but one country’ can also
invoke a sense of ecological responsibility. The Bahá’í International Community56
(BIC) stipulates that world citizenship has both a practical and transformative
function, ‘[W]orld citizenship encompasses the principles of social and economic
justice, both within and between nations; non-adversarial decision making at all levels
of society; equality of the sexes; racial, ethnic, national and religious harmony; and the
willingness to sacrifice for the common good’.57 World citizenship implies, in short,
responsibilities for others. The Bahá’í notion of world citizenship is, in this regard,
linked to dissipating the dichotomies between citizen and stranger that have fed
modern notions of identity in IR: its assertion of world citizenship is a rejection of
erecting barriers between peoples of the earth, the ‘inhabitants of one city’ – as

expressed by Bahá’u’lláh –58 in order to eliminate divisive discriminations, illusionary
prejudices, and irreconcilable ‘otherness’.59

A Balanced Politics of Care and Reciprocity

The private sphere, traditionally associated with women, can offer the means by which
cosmopolitanism may be ameliorated. Benhabib and Cornell have argued that the
public sphere has been constructed in a way that devalues the moral skills developed
in the lives of women, in turn the disregard for these values contribute to placing
women within the private sphere. Responsiveness, nurturance, attentiveness, care and
dependence have traditionally been linked to women, and these, in turn, have been
considered inferior moral standards. ‘Abdul’l’Bahá has talked of ‘moral courage’ as a
strong feminine attribute60 and the Universal House of Justice mentions that women’s
participation creates a ‘moral and psychological climate in which international peace
can emerge.’61 The BIC has underlined the value of women’s participation: ‘[O]nly as
the contributions of women are valued will they be sought out and woven into the
fabric of society. The result will be a more peaceful, balanced, just and prosperous
civilization.62 This calls for readjusting the moral standards which have been belittled,
and which are traditionally associated with the female gender. Undervalued norms in
IR can render the international sphere more co-operative, that is, more responsive,
nurturing, attentive, and caring for the fate of all its constituents. World order values,
which greatly affect the shape and contours of global realities, do not have to be
antagonistic and competitive: ‘power over others’ can be redefined as ‘service to

others’ and ‘service to humankind’. New values can lead to the redefinition of ‘power’
and ‘rationality’. The ‘public/international’ traditionally defined in bellicose terms can
be reconceptualised. The Bahá’í model, by including, valuing, and emphasising
feminine values,63 challenges aggressiveness as a condemned IR framework.

Globalisation and the Need for Global Cooperation

The cosmopolis is not only an ideal. It represents, from the Bahá’í viewpoint, an
embryonic form which is struggling to appear.64 Indeed, we live in an age of paradox.
Many issues have become transnational while identities and systems of organisations
are still entrenched in nationalistic parameters; we have great developments in
technology and communications, but only a small portion of humanity can benefit
from its breakthroughs; thanks to material advances the earth has shrunk in many
ways, nevertheless, people feel increasingly lonely and conflicts multiply and
intensify. Physical and material distance may have shrunk, but global social distance
has actually widened characterised by sharp asymmetries between wealth and poverty.
David Held contends that even if cosmopolitan advocacy could seem like defying
gravity and walking on water,65 there are many cosmopolitan anchors to the world:
non-governmental organisations (NGOs), global social movements, the creation of
regional systems of governance, women and youth movements, the development of
international law, the cooperative search for solutions relating to specific issues such
as children’s rights, women’s rights, labour rights, and the environment. Needless to
say that the tendency towards unity is met by opposing tendencies which are contained

in many new forms of antagonisms.66 According to Bahá’í views, these opposing
tendencies are part of a dual process, a process of integration and disintegration,67in
which setbacks and conflicts will have to give way to gradual global arrangements.

The Bahá’í approach is correlated to the view that a global peace is an ethical and
spiritual goal that demands appropriate institutions for its maintenance, but is detached
from the cosmopolitan turn around the eighteenth century68 that sustained that
progress and the advantages of peace should be conceived exclusively in material
terms. The Bahá’í ethos upholds that technological and material advances provide the
possibility of engendering a more ethical and fulfilling peace. Material
interdependence does not equate to an ethical community of mankind, but can lead to
its realisation and fulfilment. Shoghi Effendi and ‘Abdu’l’Bahá observed that the
twentieth century offered the material conditions that allowed peace to become a
concrete possibility due to global financial and technological interdependence.69 In
this regard, the globalisation of the economy, e.g. a material cosmopolitanism, neither
equates to the collapse of exclusions and divisions nor to the expansion of values and
identities, in the sense of being responsive to the intrinsic social rights of others, that is
an ethical cosmopolitanism. The Bahá’í model offers a way of reconciling both forms.
It denotes that the challenge lies not in forsaking technological and material benefits,
but rather in infusing renewed values of justice and unity into an uneven process. The
balance between matter, on the one hand, and ethics, on the other hand, would ensure
that the benefits of globalisation are shared more fairly.

Whilst the economy has gone transnational, our political structures, embedded in
Westphalian, statist and national forms of governance, struggle. Questions regarding
the environment, HIV/AIDS, the trafficking in women and children, the universal
rights of minorities, mass terrorism, genocide, civil society breakdown, global poverty
crack through the walls of the state and/or have repercussions beyond the state. How,
may we wonder, can global values remedy all this? Here, it is crucial to mention that
global values can induce practical changes in world order, and engage the ethos of
institutions. In this regard, Joseph Stiglitz argues that changes in global governance
involve a change in mind-sets.70 Global values are not necessarily grand schemes for
speculation, but also crucial instruments of ‘moral motivation’, an expression that has
of late been expressed by critical IR.71 Through the stretching of identities, they can
infuse a global perspective to problems that are no longer exclusively nationally
framed, and that transcend Westphalia.

Neo-liberal underpinnings, whose antecedents can be found in utilitarianism, bear
upon the ethos of the global economy and its matching organisations.72 The pursuit of
profits and commercial interests is mostly undertaken at the expense of the
environment, labour and health standards, human rights, and can wreck the social
fabric of many societies whilst serving the interests of the few. In addition, democratic
input does not inform unfair trade rules, and barriers to trade result in more poverty for
which international aid cannot compensate.73 (In relation to the latter, Shoghi Effendi
remarked the need for all economic barriers to vanquish if a community imbued with
world citizenship was to be realised).74 The neo-liberal formula which guides

development policies in a number of countries does not acknowledge that
development requires a transformation of society.75 The formula has wrongly
conflated global economic growth with human welfare.76 Global economic institutions
lack transparency, are unequally represented (voting rights discriminate against
economically disadvantaged countries whilst policies mostly affect them, a voting
representation/model deplored by Shoghi Effendi),77 and incite counter-reactions in
both ‘North and South’ – divided as can be witnessed in this terminology along the
lines of ‘rich and poor’ or ‘haves and haves not’. The end-results for people subjected
to top-down policies are powerlessness, voicelessness, despair, and may materialise in
violence. The Universal House of Justice writes:

> All too many of these ideologies, alas, instead of embracing the concept of
> the oneness of mankind, and promoting the increase of concord among
> different peoples, have tended to deify the state, to subordinate the rest of
> mankind to one nation, race or class, to attempt to suppress all discussion
> and interchange of ideas, or to callously abandon starving millions to the
> operations of a market system that all too clearly is aggravating the plight
> of the majority of mankind, while enabling small sections to live in a
> condition of affluence scarcely dreamed of by our forebears.78

Indeed, material market forces cannot, on their own, solve human rights issues, social
inequality, social empowerment, unemployment, pollution.79 They cannot redistribute
resources, heal the sick, and educate children. They need to be embedded in ethical

and social values. According to Devetak and Higgott, globalisation has eroded the
social bond, as the political normative order which usually provides security and
protection on the national level, has not matched the global economic order.80 On this
view, governmental intervention to promote standards of health, sound environmental
policies, and safe labour practices can mitigate the destabilising effects of the global
economy. Yet, there is no government at the global level to do this.81

In the absence of strong political institutions to deal with these gaps in governance,
there is a need for transparent multi-layered multilateralism, democratic input in
governance,    and   grassroots    empowerment.      In   other   words,   an    ethical
cosmopolitanism, in the form of democratic citizenry input, values of transparency to
govern international organisations, values of participation and consent, and wider
human social values need to be fostered in order to offset dividing tendencies between
the haves and the haves not. This demands rethinking issues of justice, without which
real unity cannot be, and also the emergence of novel and improved forms of global
governance. If political arrangements do not catch up with economic globalisation,
global unity will be delayed.82 The BIC writes:

> The challenge goes beyond ensuring an equitable distribution of
> opportunity, important as that is. It calls for a fundamental rethinking of
> economic issues in a manner that will invite the full participation of a
> range of human experience and insight hitherto largely excluded from the
> discourse. The classical economic models of impersonal markets in which

human beings act as autonomous makers of self-regarding choices will not
serve the needs of a world motivated by ideals of unity and justice.83

In this passage, one can notice the salience of the conceptualisation of human beings.
For example, the way we view human beings and their potential can have lasting
effects on policies that affect them. The concepts of the oneness of humankind and
justice can reshape the view of human beings, not as ‘autonomous makers’, but as
‘empowered beings’ who are connected with one another through relationships and the
recognition of inherent dignity. This point might sometimes be undermined in current
debates about the North and South. As long as social, political, and economic
institutions will not view human beings as equal in inherent dignity, and as part of a
network of social relationships, as concrete beings with concrete lives and
experiences, the distance between global institutions and peoples will not be bridged.84

Here, the Bahá’í model can challenge the view of human beings as ‘autonomous
rational beings’ as expressed in the liberal cosmopolitan tradition; the Bahá’í model
instead views human beings as moral agents who are not severed from each other, but
connected through valued relationships. Shoghi Effendi, for example, places the
principle of the oneness of humankind around the idea of relationships that bind
diverse elements together, rendering it interactive and interconnected.85 J. Ann Tickner
suggests an alternative to the view that human beings are autonomous makers of profit
maximisation. She proposes an ethic that redefines rationality as personal, rather than
abstract, whereby human beings are also attached to the fate of others.86 This model of

interaction and moral empowerment for world order has been proposed as a humane
alternative, and can assist in underlining the social ills that are cancerous namely
because they disempower. Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen importantly depicts poverty
as the deprivation of capabilities.87 Indeed, finding durable solutions to global poverty
does not only concern food and death, but also personal transformation in dignified
lives.88 It also concerns institutional cosmopolitanism. David Held argues that:

> [T]he creation of new global governance structures with responsibility for
> addressing poverty, welfare and related issues is vital to offset the power
> and influence of market-oriented agencies such as the WTO and IMF. It
> will be important to reconcile, in this debate, civil and political rights and
> issues of geopolitical and global security with socio-economic rights and
> issues of social justice. One cannot accept the burden of putting
> accountability and justice right in one realm of life – physical security and
> political cooperation among defence establishments – without at the same
> time seeking to put it right elsewhere.89

Held goes on to suggest, ‘if the political and the security, the social and the economic
dimensions of accountability and justice are separated in the long term – as is the
tendency in the global order today – the prospects of a peaceful and civil society will
be bleak indeed’.90 More importantly, this underwrites that issues of security, such as
terrorism, cannot be decoupled from social deprivations, such as global poverty, and
poverty from ecological matters, such as environmental depletion.91 In this way,

propositions have been advanced for reforming our international institutions, based on
sovereign states and self-interest, to a more global system of governance based on
subsidiarity and decentralisation, safeguarding thereby that decisions occur at the most
appropriate level. A world parliament, dealing with global transnational issues of a
political and social import, has been proposed as a possible and fair alternative:

> The focus of a global assembly92 would be the examination of those
> pressing problems which are at the heart of the possibility of the
> implementation of cosmopolitan principles – for instance health and
> disease, food supply and distribution, the debt burden of the developing
> world, the instability of the hundreds of billions of dollars that circulate
> the globe daily, global warming and the reduction of the risks of nuclear,
> chemical and biological warfare.93

Shoghi Effendi referring to a world parliament noted that it should, ‘enact such laws as
shall be required to regulate the life, satisfy the needs, and adjust all the relationships
of all races and peoples’.94 It is interesting to note that the second and third generation
of human rights – socio-economic rights – define these rights as encompassing
needs.95 Other dimensions of life such as those mentioned by David Held such as the
questions of the environment, the instability of the global economy, issues of health
and disease, and food supply could also be envisaged within such a crucial remit.

Conclusion

What has been advanced is that the Bahá’í model differs from the cosmopolitan
tradition on the grounds that it contains a sacred dimension, and stems from Eastern
origins. This has important ramifications for the ideas of cosmopolitanism at large. It
can be said that the cosmopolitan ideas are universal, and not solely Western. This is
very strong point for cosmopolitanism, albeit one which is quite salient for the
Western tradition as a whole. The main criticisms that can be charged against
cosmopolitan ideas in current IR scholarship are that they may mask a desire for a
global hegemony based on European values, what is termed ‘euro-centric’. In this
regard, the Bahá’í model destabilises the idea of the universal as being exclusively
‘Western’ and ‘secular’. It also destabilises ideas that the ‘rational’ mind is a sufficient
tool for shaping world order. The Bahá’í model reconciles secular and sacred trends in
cosmopolitan IR, by redefining the very idea of the rational and complementing it with
feminine elements which have been occluded, and also more ‘mystical’ elements.

World order does not solely depend on male (not man, but male) rational minds, but
also on divine elements which value and engage human agency. Indeed, material
cosmopolitanism, which takes the form of a globalisation that has been mismanaged,
has to be complemented with more ethical aspects, such as the input of social values,
an ethics of solidarity through the participation of global civil society; the
accountability of global institutions; the involvement of the grassroots level. This
brings several reconciliations in the field: the marriage between the sacred and the

secular, the reconciliation of ‘reason’ with ‘emotion’ and ‘spirit’, and the reunion
between matter and ethics, in other words, between material innovations and
spirituality. The Bahá’í model also provides ‘a level of principle’ upon which IR
theories may thrive, and be reinforced via normative and spiritual/ethical components.

environment, making sure the poor have a say in decisions that affect them, promoting democracy and
fair trade are necessary if the potential benefits of globalization are to be achieved’. (Joseph Stiglitz,
Globalization and Its Discontents, (London: Allen Lane, 2002), 216).

\[77\] Shoghi Effendi has written in this regard, ‘Though it is premature to try and endeavour to foresee on
what basis various nations would be represented on any international council, or in any international
form of government, it is clear that from the Bahá'í standpoint it could only be carried out on a basis of
true justice; and justice does not imply one race having a preponderating vote over some other race's
representatives, and thus being in a position to dominate them’. (Shoghi Effendi quoted in Foad Katirai,

Instead of ‘thwarted’, the term ‘delayed’ was favoured, as the Bahá’í perspective upholds the
eventual pacification of IR. The manner in which it will be realised, and its timing, depends on human
agency.
