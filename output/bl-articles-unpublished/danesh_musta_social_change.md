Some Reflections on Bahá’í Approaches to Social Change

Introduction
Bahá’u’lláh, the founder of the Bahá’í Faith, envisioned a future society with the hallmarks of
social peace, equality, and justice. This society’s foundation would be the unity of the human
race. The Bahá’í writings use different terms to express dimensions and stages of future social
reality—including the “Kingdom of God on Earth,” a “Golden Age,” and a “New World Order.”
This vision, animated by a theology and ontology of oneness, will manifest the unity of God,
unity of religion, and unity of humanity in the contingent world through patterns of unity in
diversity. At all levels of human existence, Bahá’u’lláh, calls for deeper expression of patterns
of unity:

> The tabernacle of unity hath been raised; regard ye not one another as strangers. Ye are
> the fruits of one tree, and the leaves of one branch. We cherish the hope that the light
> of justice may shine upon the world and sanctify it from tyranny. If the rulers and kings
> of the earth, the symbols of the power of God, exalted be His glory, arise and resolve
> to dedicate themselves to whatever will promote the highest interests of the whole of
> humanity, the reign of justice will assuredly be established amongst the children of
> men, and the effulgence of its light will envelop the whole earth. . . .

> Were man to appreciate the greatness of his station and the loftiness of his destiny
> he would manifest naught save goodly character, pure deeds, and a seemly and
> praiseworthy conduct. If the learned and wise men of goodwill were to impart guidance
> unto the people, the whole earth would be regarded as one country. Verily this is
> the undoubted truth. This servant appealeth to every diligent and enterprising soul to
> exert his utmost endeavour and arise to rehabilitate the conditions in all regions and to
> quicken the dead with the living waters of wisdom and utterance, by virtue of the love
> he cherisheth for God, the One, the Peerless, the Almighty, the Beneficent.1

While Bahá’í aspirations to social change have been well represented in secondary literature,
there has been less systematic analysis of the Bahá’í method of social change. The primary
Bahá’í sources—comprising the writings of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Shoghi
Effendi, and the Universal House of Justice—are filled with guidance and teachings about
methods and means for effecting change. Indeed, the Universal House of Justice has recently
written of Bahá’ís and the Bahá’í community as “protagonists of social change” learning “to
apply with increasing effectiveness elements of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation, together with the
contents and methods of science, to their social reality.”2 However, the primary Bahá’í writings
and teachings related to the means and methods of social change have not been the subject
of much scholarly analysis and consideration.3 The main exception throughout Bahá’í history

Some Reflections on Bahá’í Approaches to Social Change

has been a negative statement—that Bahá’ís should not seek to advance social change through
power-seeking within contemporary political processes. This element of Bahá’í doctrine, often
labeled as non-participation in politics, has been the subject of some discussion and in general
terms encompasses a critique of existing models of politics, including, but certainly not limited
to, the partisanship that predominates in contemporary democratic models.4

A current challenge of the Bahá’í community is to move towards a positive and constructive
articulation of how Bahá’ís as individuals and as a community will set out to advance
social change towards unity as envisioned by Bahá’u’lláh. Not surprisingly, current answers
often focus on the growing Bahá’í community and its efforts to build a pattern of global
community life and a system of administration that holds as its starting premise a commitment to
unity in diversity, spiritualization of daily life, consultative decision-making, and non-partisan
democratic structures. Although there is value and merit in such an answer, it begs the question
of whether and how Bahá’ís may be interested in the welfare of humanity as a whole, short of a
conversionist paradigm of salvation. Within the Bahá’í community there is a very strong ethic
and discourse of teaching the Bahá’í Faith to others that leads some to state that the path towards
social change is primarily, or perhaps exclusively, through increasing the number of Bahá’ís.
From this position, the answer to the question, “What is the Bahá’í method of social change?”
would likely include, “teaching the Bahá’í Faith” and perhaps, “The world will change towards
unity when masses of people become Bahá’ís.” There is ample evidence within the Bahá’í
writings, however, that processes of growth of the Bahá’í community and processes of social
change, while interrelated, cannot be conflated and understood as one and the same. To cite but
one example, when calling Bahá’ís to “social action,” the Universal House of Justice recently
stated that “we feel compelled to raise a warning: It will be important for all to recognize that
the value of engaging in social action and public discourse is not to be judged by the ability
to bring enrollments.”5

In this short paper we offer some reflections on the Bahá’í method of social change, in particular,
how the Bahá’í writings foresee Bahá’ís pursuing social change. These reflections suggest that
Bahá’u’lláh expects of His followers dynamic and distinct forms of engagement in the life of
society at large that are primarily, though not exclusively, focused on what might be called
epistemic social action. At the same time, it is suggested that the work of building up particular
patterns and structures of Bahá’í community life is best conceptualized as part of a broader
model of social change in which Bahá’ís are engaged both externally in the life of society and

internally in their community-building projects. Finally, it is suggested that a discourse within
and about the Bahá’í community would benefit from a positive shift towards an emphasis on
what Bahá’ís can and should be doing to advance social change, rather than framing discourse
about Bahá’í efforts at social change through what Bahá’ís do not do, such as the limitations
on participation in partisan political processes.
Elements of a Bahá’í Approach to Social
Change
The following four principles, listed here in logical order and building upon each other, form
the foundation for understanding a Bahá’í method and approach to social change.

1\. Social change begins and ends with unity
Unity, or oneness, is the central concept of Bahá’í theology, ontology, and social theory; as
such, it is also positioned as the central teaching of Bahá’u’lláh. As Bahá’u’lláh describes His
own station and purpose, “Through Him the light of unity hath shone forth above the horizon
of the world, and the law of oneness hath been revealed amidst the nations, who, with radiant
faces, have turned towards the Supreme Horizon, and acknowledged that which the Tongue of
Utterance hath spoken in the kingdom of His knowledge.”6 In describing His own revelation,
He states:

> I testify that no sooner had the First Word proceeded. . . out of His mouth. . . than the
> whole creation was revolutionized, and all that are in the heavens and all that are on
> earth were stirred to the depths. Through that Word the realities of all created things
> were shaken, were divided, separated, scattered, combined and reunited, disclosing,
> in both the contingent world and the heavenly kingdom, entities of a new creation,
> and revealing, in the unseen realms, the signs and tokens of Thy unity and oneness.
> Through that Call Thou didst announce unto all Thy servants the advent of Thy most
> great Revelation and the appearance of Thy most perfect Cause.7

Three aspects of the Bahá’í concept of unity are helpful to understanding its social expressions.
First, unity is a state of knowledge or awareness, as well as a state of action. Bahá’u’lláh often
spoke of the need for our vision and perception of the world around us to be firmly rooted in
unity. He exhorted human beings to “let your vision be world embracing. . . ” and to see with the
“eye of oneness.”8 This vision of unity, which reflects the fundamental interconnectedness of
social reality, is found throughout the writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi that explain
social issues and challenges, and include prescriptions for the future. For example, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá writes:

> Continents remained widely divided, nay even among the peoples of one and the
> same continent association and interchange of thought were well nigh impossible.
> Consequently intercourse, understanding and unity amongst all the peoples and
> kindreds of the earth were unattainable. In this day, however, means of communication
> have multiplied, and the five continents of the earth have become increasingly

> interdependent. For none is self-sufficiency any longer possible, inasmuch as political
> ties unite all peoples and nations, and the bonds of trade and industry, of agriculture
> and education, are being strengthened every day. Hence the unity of all mankind can in
> this day be achieved. Verily this is none other but one of the wonders of this wondrous
> age, this glorious century.9

From this perspective, advancing towards unity is not something that human beings blindly
stumble towards. Unity must be a consciously chosen and pursued state, expressed as a
result of our conscious knowledge of the fundamental interconnectedness of humanity as one
human race. Indeed, human beings, absent this conscious knowledge, will often label various
conditions as unity, when indeed they are not. History is rife with egregious examples of hatred
and oppression masquerading as so-called unity. Perhaps most evident in history has been the
association of the term unity with a limited racial unity, which carries with it an assumption of
the inferior status, and in some cases subhuman status, of much of humanity standing outside
of that limited unification. Because its inclusiveness is limited rather than universal, this false
unity, achieved through uniformity, is antithetical to the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh.

Understanding unity also entails a particular orientation to the relationship between oneness and
difference (sometimes referred to as the relationship between unity and diversity). Oneness and
difference, in this vision, are seen as essential and integrated concepts that are not in tension as
values or constructs. The Bahá’í writings use frequent metaphors to describe this relationship.
Bahá’u’lláh states, “Please God, that we avoid the land of denial, and advance into the ocean
of acceptance, so that we may perceive, with an eye purged from all conflicting elements, the
worlds of unity and diversity, of variation and oneness. . . .”10 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá uses the metaphor
of a garden to explain this relationship between unity and diversity:

> If the flowers of a garden were all of one color, the effect would be monotonous to the
> eye; but if the colors are variegated, it is most pleasing and wonderful. The difference
> in adornment of color and capacity of reflection among the flowers gives the garden its
> beauty and charm. Therefore, although we are of different individualities, different in
> ideas and of various fragrances, let us strive like flowers of the same divine garden to
> live together in harmony. Even though each soul has its own individual perfume and
> color, all are reflecting the same light, all contributing fragrance to the same breeze
> which blows through the garden, all continuing to grow in complete harmony and
> accord. Become as waves of one sea, trees of one forest, growing in the utmost love,
> agreement and unity.11

More than merely an aspiration, this statement is an ontological assertion about the nature and
structure of reality. Patterns of distinct entities coming together to form complex unities are

understood, in Bahá’í thought, as the most accurate description of the process of creation. As
one scholar writes:

> According to the Bahá’í view, the nature of reality is ultimately a unity, in contrast to a
> view that would postulate a multiplicity of differing or incommensurate realities. In a
> talk delivered in New York City in December 1912, 'Abdu'l-Baha stated that "oneness is
> truth and truth is oneness which does not admit of reality." In a similar vein, during a
> talk in Paris in October 1911, 'Abdu'l-Baha stated that "Truth has many aspects, but it
> remains always and forever one."12

Second, unity is a comprehensive concept that carries within it implications not only
for individual perceptions, knowledge, and vision but also for political ethics, organization,
and our political action as individuals. This comprehensive concept can be seen in one of the
foundational themes of Bahá’u’lláh’s political ethics—stated in His first public declaration in
1863—that “in this Revelation the use of the sword is prohibited.”13

As analyzed by Saiedi, Bahá’u’lláh roots this concept in a re-interpretation of nusrat, or assisting
the cause of God to give it victory.14 Islamic interpretations of nusrat, which have often
supported violence and coercion, are challenged by Bahá’u’lláh Who calls His followers to
“[a]ssist ye the Lord of all creation with works of righteousness, and also through wisdom and
utterance.”15 Saiedi further demonstrates that Bahá’u’lláh’s rejection of the sword is not limited
to a narrow condemnation of violence; rather, it encompasses a range of social ethics:

> The prohibition of killing, violence, and religious coercion; the promotion of love,
> unity, and fellowship among peoples; the call for peace among the nations; the
> condemnation of militarism and of the proliferation of arms; the assertion of the
> necessity for education and productive employment; the condemnation of sedition;
> the assertion of the need for religion and social justice—all these are presented by
> Bahá’u’lláh as systematic expressions of the same underlying principle of the removal
> of the sword.16

Employing this principle, Bahá’u’lláh describes how He put an end to Bábí militancy as a means
of social change and shifted the Bahá’í community to effecting social change through non-
coercive means reflective of the dynamics of unity:

> Strife and conflict befit the beasts of the wild. It was through the grace of God and
> with the aid of seemly words and praiseworthy deeds that the unsheathed swords of the
> Bábí community were returned to their scabbards. Indeed through the power of good

This new form of politics required by the removal of the sword is one in which unity as an
end is privileged over other ends. The practical effects of this shift are far-reaching. To look
at one example, consider the role of religion in political discourse. One of the most discussed
and analyzed topics in political and legal theory is the proper role (if any) of religion in public
discourse. From a Bahá’í perspective, the removal of the sword, which aims to result in unity,
places clear limitations on how Bahá’ís can and should engage in political discourse and for
what purposes. Politics, in Bahá’u’lláh’s vision, is not a legitimate avenue to convince others
of the correctness of one’s religious beliefs or to try to convince others to convert. A public
discourse of conversion would violate the requirement of religious respect and tolerance, the
necessity to demonstrate and express love, and the underlying reality of the unity of religion.

Similarly, this limitation on a political discourse of conversion raises broader concerns about
the role of religion in politics. The Bahá’í writings are clear in their anti-majoritarian stance. In
situations where Bahá’ís might in the future find themselves as a majority population, Shoghi
Effendi has articulated a principle of preferential treatment for minorities:

> Unlike the nations and peoples of the earth, be they of the East or of the West,
> democratic or authoritarian, communist or capitalist, whether belonging to the Old
> World or the New, who either ignore, trample upon, or extirpate, the racial, religious, or
> political minorities within the sphere of their jurisdiction, every organized community
> enlisted under the banner of Bahá’u’lláh should feel it to be its first and inescapable
> obligation to nurture, encourage, and safeguard every minority belonging to any faith,
> race, class, or nation within it.18

While undoubtedly interested in seeing the inculcation of morality and virtues in public life, and
believing that religion is an indispensable foundation for civilization, Bahá’u’lláh nonetheless
rejects a public virtue that would allow the entrenchment of majority views at the expense of
minorities. Shoghi Effendi equates a violation of the rights of nonbelievers with an action that
would subvert the essence of the religion itself. He clarifies that a violation of the “legitimate
civil rights of individuals in a free society” would effectively reignite “in men’s breasts the fire
of bigotry and blind fanaticism, cut themselves off from the glorious bestowals of this promised
Day of God, and impede the full flow of divine assistance in this wondrous age.”19

Third, and following from the previous two points, unity is both a means and an end. Bahá’u’lláh
positions the goal of social relations, communities, and structures as expressing and reflecting
the fundamental unity of humanity. The individual and collective purposes and potentialities of
humanity can best be accomplished and achieved through recognition of this fundamental unity
and by learning to express it in action. Through this lens, human social history is understood as
humanity’s long effort to construct social patterns where an encompassing unity is increasingly
recognized and actualized. Shoghi Effendi describes this view of history:

> Unification of the whole of mankind is the hall-mark of the stage which human society
> is now approaching. Unity of family, of tribe, of city-state, and nation have been
> successively attempted and fully established. World unity is the goal towards which a
> harassed humanity is striving.20

This vision of history is understood to be a dynamic and on-going process. It is also a contingent
one, rooted in humanity’s conscious knowledge and effort.

The Bahá’í teachings make clear that the process of building social unity must take place in a
manner that reflects the principles of unity. Simply stated, the ends do not justify the means;
indeed, from a Bahá’í perspective the nature of unity that is sought as an end cannot be achieved
through means that violate unity. As Bahá’u’lláh states on page 77 in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, “We
have assigned to every end a means for its accomplishment. . . .” With respect to unity, one
could impose “unity” on diverse peoples through coercion and the threat of force. Indeed, from
ancient to contemporary times one can find examples of human beings using force to create a
coerced unity. From a Bahá’í perspective, such coercion is not a legitimate means for creating
unity, nor is that end a true state of unity in diversity. Rather, such a forced state is understood
as a state of oppression. Relatedly, one finds clear statements throughout the Bahá’í writings
to the effect that the genesis of conflict is due to a lack of established of unity in diversity. This
perspective has been summarized as follows:

> Only through the dawning consciousness that they constitute a single people will the
> inhabitants of the planet be enabled to turn away from the patterns of conflict that have
> dominated social organization in the past and begin to learn the ways of collaboration
> and conciliation. “The well-being of mankind,” Bahá’u’lláh writes, “its peace and
> security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established.”21

Unity through uniformity, in Bahá’í terms, is both unjust and unsustainable. It is not a state of
unity born out of conscious knowledge of human beings and of how difference and oneness

1991), 202.

1995), 3.

interact. Unity through uniformity does not give expression to actions that promote justice or
equality for all.

2\. Bahá’ís should privilege action at the level of social
meanings, as distinct from social forms and social norms, in
their efforts to effect social change in the broader society
The positioning of unity as both the means and end of social change frames the central
challenge, and analytical lens, for thinking about how Bahá’ís may legitimately pursue social
change. What are methods of social change that may be consistent with the means of unity in
diversity?

To develop an answer to this question, it is necessary to provide a framework for organizing and
thinking about different approaches to social change. One useful framework is to think about
efforts at social change as potentially focused on three distinct but interrelated levels: social
forms, social norms, and social meanings.

Social forms, in this framework, do not refer to any particular sociological theory of forms.
Rather, in this context, the term refers to public, outward, and shared phenomena that play
roles in structuring and ordering the life of society. Most obviously, these are institutions and
organizations, including public and government institutions. The term “social forms” also refers
to the central tools such entities use to perform their ordering functions, including, for example,
laws and policies. It might also be said that social forms are constructs through which formal
public power is organized and exercised within society, including through the institutions of
government.

Social forms are distinct from social norms, which generically can be described as the shared
principles of behavior within a group or society. In any given group or society, there will be
certain shared rules or principles of behavior that express the expectedness or unexpectedness
of behaviors and associated attitudes and values. These shared principles of behavior—which
may be implicit or explicit—constitute a type of group infrastructure, where certain modes of
acting and engaging in relation to others may be pursued or avoided.

Social meanings remove us from the realm of shared institutions and structures (social forms)
and shared rules and principles of behavior (social norms) and are focused on the shared mental
constructs within a particular society or group. In this understanding, social meanings might
be defined as the “semiotic content attached to various actions, or inactions, or statuses, within
a particular context.”22 Such meanings may be consciously constructured by social actors,

\[22\] Lawrence Lessig, “The Regulation of Social Meaning,” The University of Chicago Law Review 62.3 (1995): 951.

including governments, corporations, or groups of individuals, in order to reinforce sets of
behaviors, understandings, or outcomes. The most powerful meanings are those that appear
most natural and are taken for granted—uncontested—and such meanings will have the most
significant impact on shaping the contexts within which individuals act and relate. Legal scholar
Lawrence Lessig states three propositions with respect to social meanings and their strength:

> …first, that social meanings exist; second, that they are used by individuals, or groups,
> to advance individual or collective ends; and third, that their force in part hangs upon
> their resting upon a certain uncontested, or taken-for-granted, background of thought
> or expectation—alternatively, that though constructed, their force depends upon them
> not seeming constructed.23

Further, Lessig writes:

> If social meanings exist, they are also used. They not only constitute, or guide,
> or constrain; they are also tools—means to a chosen end, whether an individually
> or collectively chosen end. They are a resource—a semiotic resource—that society
> provides to all if it provides to any. They are a way “for hitting each other and coercing
> one another to conform to something [one has] in mind”; or for inspiring another or
> inducing another to do, or believe, or want, in a certain way.24

As Lessig describes, social meanings may be contested or uncontested, foregrounded or
backgrounded. Where a social meaning is uncontested and in the background—meaning it is
almost subconsciously taken for granted and assumed—it has the most power. These social
meanings shape our choices and behaviors with little conscious cognitive intermediation.
Conversely, when social meanings are contested and foregrounded, they have the least power
in dictating our choices and behaviors. In such a context, various competing meanings are
the subject of on-going public debate. The process of changing social meanings is ultimately
a process of social meanings being moved from being contested to uncontested and from
foreground to background.

Change at the level of social meanings can be distinguished from change at the level of social
norms, as well as from change at the level of social forms. As distinct from the cognitive
association ascribed to a particular action, social norms refer to the behavioral expectations
that indicate the established and accepted ways of acting. Where meanings are about mental
associations, norms are preoccupied with behavioral choices. Social forms, however, refer to the
actual institutions and structures that are given social expression and are the most transparent,
directly observable influencers of social action. Implicit with social forms is that, for the
purposes of adherence, they are capable of harnessing and utilizing social coercion and force.

In its efforts to advance broad social change in the contemporary world at large, the Bahá’í
community prioritizes action to effect change at the level of social meanings. Specifically, the
Bahá’í community privileges action at the level of meanings which will increase awareness,
understanding, consciousness, and shared associations that reinforce the realities of unity and
its associated concepts of equality and justice.

The privileging of action at the level of meanings is done for a number of reasons. First,
action at the level of meanings fits the Bahá’í emphasis on the paradigm of unity. The idea of
unity as a conscious, deliberate state and the necessity that it be advanced in a non-coercive
manner require that it emerge at the levels of our ways of perceiving and knowing, as well as
in our actions, relationships, and collective life. Social unity is the shared outward expression
of a consciousness of the diverse, interrelated, and mutually interdependent dimensions of our
existence in relation to others. Certain architectures of social meanings will reinforce such a
reality of unity—and concomitantly encourage behaviors that reflect it—while others will be
in tension with it. As these architectures increasingly reflect and reinforce unity-centered ones,
the potentiality for unity-centered social norms and forms will deepen and in some respects
accelerate. The Bahá’í International Community describes this process in its identification of
how social forms for a global age will only emerge once collective shifts in consciousness take
place:

> Laying the groundwork for global civilization calls for the creation of laws and
> institutions that are universal in both character and authority. The effort can begin
> only when the concept of the oneness of humanity has been wholeheartedly embraced
> by those in whose hands the responsibility for decision making rests, and when the
> related principles are propagated through both educational systems and the media of
> mass communication. Once this threshold is crossed, a process will have been set in
> motion through which the peoples of the world can be drawn into the task of formulating
> common goals and committing themselves to their attainment.25

The Bahá’í method of focusing at the level of social meanings is seen throughout Bahá’í
history. It finds its genesis in Bahá’u’lláh’s emphasis on focusing on individuals’ “hearts.”
We see examples of such an approach to social action throughout the life of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
a particularly powerful one being His approach to the question of racial equality and unity.
An illustrative example is from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s journey to the United States in 1912. At the
home of Morgan Shuster, He attended a dinner with leading social and political figures of the
Washington, DC area, which was the location of the temporary office of the Iranian government
in America. After witnessing the seating and the company, He rearranged the seating so that

1995), 3.

hand. This action was taken at a time when only one restaurant in all of Washington, DC would
permit white and black Americans to sit together. In undertaking this action, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was
challenging the conventional and predominant meanings of skin color that pervaded American
society—and in particular the association of dark skin with inferiority. At the same time, He
was reinforcing the meanings of unity that were the direct subject-matter of many of His talks
throughout His journey—and in particular that unity meant demonstrating a universal love for
humanity and honoring the qualities and capacities of all individuals rather than drawing false
and arbitrary distinctions based on, for example, race and gender. In the Century of Light,
a connection is drawn between this episode and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s method of changing social
meanings:

> Appreciating these limitations on the part of His hearers, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá did not hesitate
> to introduce into His relations with Western believers actions that summoned them to
> a level of consciousness far above mere social liberalism and tolerance. One example
> that must stand for a range of such interventions was His gentle but dramatic act in
> encouraging the marriage of Louis Gregory and Louise Mathew—the one black, the
> other white. The initiative set a standard for the American Bahá’í community as to
> the real meaning of racial integration, however timid and slow its members were in
> responding to the core implications of the challenge.26

Another example of this privileging of social meanings is seen in how the Universal House
of Justice and the worldwide Bahá’í Community sought to make contributions to the cause of
peace during the height of the Cold War. The Universal House of Justice wrote a document
called The Promise of World Peace, which was then distributed globally to leaders, thinkers,
and populations at large. At the heart of the document was an argument for the shared meanings
of peace to be associated with a positive state of unity (as distinct from, for example, an
absence of war) and relatedly to serve as a pathway for individuals and communities to play
a constructive role in the building of a peaceful global civilization. The message opens by
associating meanings of peace with meanings of unity:

> The Great Peace towards which people of good will throughout the centuries have
> inclined their hearts, of which seers and poets for countless generations have expressed
> their vision, and for which from age to age the sacred scriptures of mankind have
> constantly held the promise, is now at long last within the reach of the nations. For
> the first time in history it is possible for everyone to view the entire planet, with all its
> myriad diversified peoples, in one perspective. World peace is not only possible but
> inevitable. It is the next stage in the evolution of this planet—in the words of one great
> thinker [Teilhard de Chardin], “the planetization of mankind.”27

\[27\] Universal House of Justice, The Promise of World Peace (Haifa: Bahá’í World Centre, 1985), 1.

It goes on to locate the genesis of change as an expression of people’s minds—the way we
understand and perceive:

> The endowments which distinguish the human race from all other forms of life are
> summed up in what is known as the human spirit; the mind is its essential quality. These
> endowments have enabled humanity to build civilizations and to prosper materially.28

Building on this theme, the message argues that the failure to achieve peace is ultimately tied
to a “paralysis of will.” Among other things, overcoming this paralysis requires a fundamental
shift in the arena of the mind—a shift in consciousness. In particular,

> [w]orld order can be founded only on an unshakeable consciousness of the oneness
> of mankind, a spiritual truth which all the human sciences confirm. Anthropology,
> physiology, psychology, recognize only one human species, albeit infinitely varied
> in the secondary aspects of life. Recognition of this truth requires abandonment of
> prejudice—prejudice of every kind—race, class, colour, creed, nation, sex, degree of
> material civilization, everything which enables people to consider themselves superior
> to others.

> Acceptance of the oneness of mankind is the first fundamental prerequisite for
> reorganization and administration of the world as one country, the home of humankind.
> Universal acceptance of this spiritual principle is essential to any successful attempt to
> establish world peace. It should therefore be universally proclaimed, taught in schools,
> and constantly asserted in every nation as preparation for the organic change in the
> structure of society which it implies.29

This statement is a call to shared meanings of unity and oneness; and it puts forward the
argument that through such changes in shared meanings individuals and groups of individuals
will be propelled towards, and find openings for, new forms of social action.

Bahá’u’lláh’s elevation of change at the level of meanings as being fundamental is a direct
reflection of His positioning of unity as central to ontology and as the fundamental force in
existence. Focusing on change at the level of social meanings is fundamentally an epistemic
vision of social action. It is one in which shared mental associations and understandings come
into existence and then act as a social force to shape different patterns of social norms and the
evolution of new social forms. When primacy is placed on unity as the centrifugal element of
social change, it is only such an epistemic vision that could manifest the change while remaining
true to the vision and reality of unity. By contrast, promoting social change primarily through
changes in social forms fundamentally involves the use of coercion and ultimately is a source
of social conflict because inherent within it is the exercise of social power. Similarly, placing
primary focus on changes in behavioral norms, absent the requisite change in meanings, often

\[28\] Ibid.

\[29\] Ibid., 10.

results in the emergence of and ethic of division and difference. Focus comes to be placed on
those who do, or do not, follow the new behavioral norms. In religious terms, what often appears
is a litmus test for those who believe (or are pure or saved), and those who do not believe and are
not saved. Conversely, when focus is placed on social meanings, the commitment is that, as the
architecture of social meanings increasingly emerges as one conducive to the development of
patterns of unity, a context is thus created in which movement towards changing social norms
and social forms can take place in a manner that is increasingly less coercive and more organic
in nature.

By targeting change at the level of social meanings, the constructive principle of social action
also frames and gives limits and definition to the Bahá’í principle of non-participation in
politics.30 As mentioned earlier, this principle can be understood as speaking to the issue of
involvement by Bahá’ís and the Bahá’í community in existing political processes and structures,
and to the question of whether to focus energies on acquiring power within or on reforming
existing systems. Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings on the non-participation of politics indicate His view
that emphasis was not to be placed on these existing systems because the methods used to
secure power in existing systems and the institutions in place for the exercise of power do not
reflect the primacy of unity. Furthermore, attempting to impose a religious program, including
through contemporary political methods and institutions, is antithetical to unity.31 It is thus
not surprising to find in the Bahá’í writings statements that clearly distinguish the Bahá’í
Administrative Order from existing political institutions. As Shoghi Effendi states:

> It would be utterly misleading to attempt a comparison between this unique, this
> divinely-conceived Order and any of the diverse systems which the minds of
> men . . .have contrived. . . .Such an attempt would in itself betray a lack of complete
> appreciation of the excellence of the handiwork of its great Author. . . .

The divers and ever-shifting systems of human polity, whether past or present, whether
originating in the East or in the West, offer no adequate criterion wherewith to estimate the
potency of its hidden virtues or to appraise the solidity of its foundations.32

\[30\] For example, Shoghi Effendi writes:

We should—every one of us—remain aloof, in heart and in mind, in words and in deeds, from the political affairs and disputes of the Nations
and of Governments. We should keep ourselves away from such thoughts. We should have no political connection with any of the parties and
should join no faction of these different and warring sects.

Absolute impartiality in the matter of political parties should be shown by words and by deeds, and the love of the whole humanity, whether
a Government or a nation, which is the basic teaching of Bahá’u’lláh, should also be shown by words and by deeds. . . .

According to the exhortations of the Supreme Pen and the confirmatory explanations of the Covenant of God Bahá’ís are in no way allowed
to enter into political affairs under any pretense of excuse; since such an action brings about disastrous results and ends in hurting the Cause
of God and its intimate friends. (Shoghi Effendi, Directives of the Guardian [Wilmette: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1973], 56–57)

3\. Bahá’ís should also seek to effect social change by building
a global pattern of Bahá’í community life that ever increasingly
reflects unity at the level of social meanings, norms, and forms
While there is a logical privileging of action at the level of social meanings in Bahá’í efforts
to effect social change in society at large, the Bahá’í community is also directly active at the
level of social forms and social norms. It goes without saying that the patterns of community
organization and life within the Bahá’í community are based on a conscious effort to reflect the
teachings of Bahá’u’lláh in action. This effort to actualize the Word in a collective community
is also projected and understood as an experiment in expressing the fundamental principles
and teachings of human equality, justice, and unity, and is expressed through all levels of how
the Bahá’í community organizes and governs itself. For instance, the Bahá’í Administrative
Order, which has both elected and appointed institutions, is rooted in an ethic of equality and
is an effort to create patterns of engagement between the leaders and the population that are
not power-based in orientation.33 Shoghi Effendi has emphasized the relationship between the
administrative order and its basis in unity, justice, and equality:

> The vitality which the organic institutions of this great, this ever-expanding
> Order so strongly exhibit; . . . the high courage, the. . . resolution of its
> administrators. . . the. . . unquenchable enthusiasm. . . the heights of self-
> sacrifice. . . the breadth of vision, the confident hope, the creative joy, the inward
> peace, the uncompromising integrity, the exemplary discipline, the unyielding unity
> and solidarity. . . the degree to which its moving Spirit has shown itself capable of
> assimilating the diversified elements within its pale, of cleansing them of all forms of
> prejudice and of fusing them with its own structure—these are evidences of a power
> which a disillusioned and sadly shaken society can ill afford to ignore.

> Compare these splendid manifestations of the spirit animating this vibrant body of the
> Faith of Bahá’u’lláh with the cries and agony, the follies and vanities, the bitterness
> and prejudices, the wickedness and divisions of an ailing and chaotic world. Witness
> the fear that torments its leaders and paralyzes the action of its blind and bewildered
> statesmen. How fierce the hatreds, how false the ambitions, how petty the pursuits,
> how deep-rooted the suspicions of its peoples! How disquieting the lawlessness, the
> corruption, the unbelief that are eating into the vitals of a tottering civilization!34

In this effort to create a pattern of community organization and life on a global scale—which
includes in its membership the full panoply of human diversity, experience, and background
—a particular experiment is taking place at the level of social forms, norms, and meanings.
Specifically, the Bahá’í community can be understood as a testing ground in which the social
expressions of unity, cutting across a global audience, are being advanced, tested, and refined.

\[33\] For a good discussion of the new kind of politics imagined by the Bahá’í administrative order, see Ulrich Gollmer, Udo Schaefer, and Nicola
Towfigh, Making the Crooked Straight: A Contribution to Bahá’í Apologetics, trans. Geraldine Schuckelt (Oxford: George Ronald, 2000).

\[34\] Shoghi Effendi, Call to the Nations (Haifa: Bahá’í World Centre, 1977).

These collective efforts include the community’s developing, maturing, and changing certain
social meanings, striving to adopt certain social norms, and seeking to build institutional and
organizational forms that exemplify unity.

The fact that within the Bahá’í community experimentation is taking place at all of these levels
is explicit and clear from the Bahá’í writings. When Bahá’u’lláh first expressed the formation
of His community, the “people of Bahá” in the Najibiyyih Garden in the outskirts of Baghdad in
1863, He immediately began the project of contesting existing architectures of social meanings
while foregrounding the new social meanings of which people were to become conscious. This
contesting of social meanings is seen, as discussed earlier, in His calling for the “removal of the
sword,” the implications of which include a warning to “beware lest ye shed the blood of any
one. Unsheathe the sword of your tongue from the scabbard of utterance, for therewith ye can
conquer the citadels of men’s hearts. We have abolished the law to wage holy war against each
other. God’s mercy hath, verily, encompassed all created things, if ye do but understand.”35 But
beyond this admonition, it is woven into the very fabric of Bahá’í community life that social
meanings which reinforce and project towards unity are to be preferred over all others. This turn
toward social meanings that reflect unity is seen in how the project of the Bahá’í community
has been described by the Universal House of Justice:

> The experience of the Bahá’í community may be seen as an example of this enlarging
> unity. It is a community of some three to four million people drawn from many nations,
> cultures, classes and creeds, engaged in a wide range of activities serving the spiritual,
> social and economic needs of the peoples of many lands. It is a single social organism,
> representative of the diversity of the human family, conducting its affairs through a
> system of commonly accepted consultative principles, and cherishing equally all the
> great outpourings of divine guidance in human history. Its existence is yet another
> convincing proof of the practicality of its Founder’s vision of a united world, another
> evidence that humanity can live as one global society, equal to whatever challenges its
> coming of age may entail. If the Bahá’í experience can contribute in whatever measure
> to reinforcing hope in the unity of the human race, we are happy to offer it as a model
> for study.36

At the same time, the Bahá’í community makes efforts to advance new patterns of social
norms and social forms. From His earliest days Bahá’u’lláh reinforced the call to construct
new norms of conduct, as well as new conceptions of law. These efforts are seen in numerous
examples, including how the Bahá’í community of Iran challenged and broke established
patterns that limited the educational opportunities and public roles of women in governing
institutions. It is also seen in, as has been discussed elsewhere,37 how Bahá’u’lláh changed

\[35\] Bahá’u’lláh, Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, trans. Shoghi Effendi, rev. ed. (Wilmette: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1988), para. 43.

established understandings and attitudes of Divine law, and in particular expected certain levels
of individual understanding and social cohesion to have emerged prior to His laws becoming
applicable. Indeed, the entire pattern of Bahá’í elections and consultative decision-making can
be seen as an effort to simultaneously change meanings of democracy, inculcate a new set of
normative behaviors for public officials, and create new institutional structures of participatory
democracy.

4\. Although the Bahá’í community’s external and internal
programs of social change are distinct, they interact and
reinforce each other in dynamic and evolving ways, and
ultimately form part of one dynamic process
So far, we have outlined two distinct efforts to effect social change pursued by the Bahá’í
community—one focused externally on the world at large, and one focused internally within
the Bahá’í community. Externally, action at the level of social meanings is privileged, while
internally actions at the levels of social forms, norms, and meanings are all pursued. Across
both external and internal spheres of activity, the centrality of unity stands firm. Given that
unity is the central theological, ontological, and social construct of the Bahá’í Faith, all efforts
at progress and change are to be focused on building and deepening patterns of unity.

While these external and internal efforts at social change are distinct, they ultimately can be seen
as forming part of one multifaceted process of advancing humanity towards unity. Specifically,
the two processes should be understood as intersecting and interacting with one another in
dynamic and increasingly complex ways. The Bahá’í writings are full of descriptions of a future
where processes internal to the Bahá’í community will eventually exert degrees of influence on
society at large. As the Universal House of Justice states, quoting Shoghi Effendi:

> That this process [development of the global Bahá’í Community] will continue to gain
> in scope and influence and the Administrative Order demonstrate in time “its capacity to
> be regarded not only as the nucleus but the very pattern of the New World Order” is clear
> from his writings. “In a world the structure of whose political and social institutions is
> impaired, whose vision is befogged, whose conscience is bewildered, whose religious
> systems have become anaemic and lost their virtue,” he asserted so emphatically, “this
> healing Agency, this leavening Power, this cementing Force, intensely alive and all-
> pervasive,” is “taking shape,” is “crystallizing into institutions,” and is “mobilizing its
> forces.”38

One way of understanding these statements is that as social meanings continually become unity-
centered in the world at large, and as the Bahá’í community continually develops and matures

\[38\] Shoghi Effendi, quoted in The Five Year Plan 2011–2016: Messages from the Universal House of Justice (West Palm Beach,
Florida: Palabra Publications, 2011), supra note 2, 38.

in its expressions of unity at the levels of meanings, norms, and forms, the interaction of internal
and external processes will increase. For example, as unity-centered social meanings take root,
there will be greater receptivity and demand for ideas about how social norms and forms
may emerge to reflect the dynamics of unity. Thus, the experiment and learning of the Bahá’í
community at the level of social forms may be of more relevance. The Bahá’í community may
become a model for emerging patterns of unity. For example, the National Spiritual Assembly
of the Bahá’ís of the United States has described the experience of that community in dealing
with race relations in the following terms:

> From its inception in 1863 the Bahá’í community was dedicated to the principle of the
> unity of humankind. Bahá’ís rely upon faith in God, daily prayer, meditation, and study
> of sacred texts to effect the transformation of character necessary for personal growth
> and maturity; however, their aim is to create a world civilization that will in turn react
> upon the character of the individual. Thus the concept of personal salvation is linked to
> the salvation, security, and happiness of all the inhabitants of the earth and stems from
> the Bahá’í belief that “the world of humanity is a composite body” and that “when one
> part of the organism suffers all the rest of the body will feel its consequence.”

> Guided and inspired by such principles, the Bahá’í community has accumulated more
> than a century of experience in creating models of unity that transcend race, culture,
> nationality, class, and the differences of sex and religion, providing empirical evidence
> that humanity in all its diversity can live as a unified global society. Bahá’ís see unity
> as the law of life; consequently, all prejudices are perceived as diseases that threaten
> life. Rather than considering that the unity of humankind can be established only after
> other problems afflicting it have been solved, Bahá’ís believe that both spiritual and
> material development are dependent upon love and unity.39

This increased interaction between internal and external efforts at social change raises another
set of more complex questions. As the two efforts interact, does this create an increased
legitimate role for Bahá’í social forms in social affairs and governance at large? This matter
has been written about at some length elsewhere, in the context of Bahá’í teachings about
the relationship between religious and political institutions, as well as the meaning of world
order in the Bahá’í writings.40 The Universal House Justice, in commenting on this matter,
seems to contemplate the possibilities of increased interaction between Bahá’í and civil political
institutions, as well as an increased role for Bahá’í institutions, but the form of this interaction
is somewhat open and dynamic:

> The second fundamental principle which enables us to understand the pattern towards
> which Bahá’u’lláh wishes human society to evolve is the principle of organic
> growth which requires that detailed developments, and the understanding of detailed
> developments, become available only with the passage of time and with the help of the

Conclusion
The four elements of the Bahá’í approach to social change outlined above highlight a diffuse,
grassroots, creative, and epistemic process. This approach, at heart, relies on changing how
individuals and groups of individuals work to think in new ways and, stemming from those new
ways of thinking, work to inculcate new patterns of behavior and ultimately new patterns of
social organization. The centrality of unity to this approach demands that the Bahá’í community
pursue external social change at the level of social meanings. Within the Bahá’í community the
action for social change is more integrative, focused simultaneously on the levels of meanings,
norms, and forms.

Like any other method of social change, this particular rendering of the Bahá’í approach has
certain challenges. The model will work best in certain conditions and when certain parameters
are adhered to, and will be less successful in other contexts. Although it will be for future papers
to examine and assess the relative successes or failures of this model as it has been implemented
by the Bahá’í community to date, one can see generally where the challenges lie within such
a model.

First, it is vitally important, as was noted in the introduction, to ensure that internal means/ends
and external means/ends are not conflated and confused. Bahá’ís must strive to have a sincerity
of motive in their efforts at social change, and, as indicated by the Universal House of Justice,
the value of social action is not to be measured through statistics of conversion. Rather, the
ultimate motivating force must be that of service which stems from a conscious recognition of
the fundamental unity of all humanity:

> That one indeed is a man who, today, dedicateth himself to the service of the entire
> human race. The Great Being saith: Blessed and happy is he that ariseth to promote
> the best interests of the peoples and kindreds of the earth. In another passage He hath
> proclaimed: It is not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country, but rather
> for him who loveth the whole world. The earth is but one country and mankind its
> citizens.42

This sustained focus on unity demands personal vigilance from each and every Bahá’í and by
the entire community of Bahá’ís, to maintain a sincerity of purpose and motive when engaging
in efforts at social change. As the Universal House of Justice stated:

> . . . we feel compelled to raise a warning: It will be important for all to recognize that
> the value of engaging in social action and public discourse is not to be judged by the
> ability to bring enrollments. Though endeavors in these two areas of activity may well

Trust, 1976), 250.

> effect an increase in the size of the Bahá’í community, they are not undertaken for this
> purpose. Sincerity in this respect is imperative.43

Second, the epistemic and long-term approach to social change requires caution in measuring
success or failure through fixed or near-term criteria and standards. Envisioning social change
as a process of changing social meanings implies a commitment to an epistemic and long-
term vision of how social change occurs. Such change ultimately stems from alterations in
how people perceive phenomena and the architecture of those perceptions in relation to each
other. While some changes may happen quite quickly, this transformation ultimately is a
gradual process where fundamental shifts in the perceptions of masses of human beings and
human communities take place over the long term. One of the challenges of such an approach,
especially when it is undertaken by a diverse and disparate (and ever-changing) community of
people, is mobilizing and deepening an understanding of the long-term and epistemic nature of
this process—and more pointedly that the process of change is often experienced in the first
instance in something intangible (how people think) as opposed to something tangible (such
as new social forms).

Throughout Bahá’í history one sees Bahá’í leaders reinforcing this orientation towards the
lengthy process of change, whether speaking about the processes within or outside of the
Bahá’í community. Bahá’u’lláh, when speaking of both the internal and external aspects of
social change, constantly encouraged His followers to recognize the long-term epistemic nature
of the process He was engaged in. For example, in relation to the internal processes of the
Bahá’í community, Bahá’u’lláh was met frequently by requests from His followers for new
social forms—laws and institutions in particular. In response to these requests, Bahá’u’lláh
called upon His followers to see the process of change in different terms. For example, in the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas, in addition to focusing on “hearts and minds,” Bahá’u’lláh also specifically
positioned shifts in knowledge, understanding, and motivation, as being the lynchpins for
further development and application of new norms and forms within the Bahá’í community.44
Similarly, while He spoke of His Order and created its embryonic institutions, efforts were not
made to begin building these institutions in earnest until later in Bahá’í history. When Shoghi
Effendi fully inaugurated the development of institutions, he similarly emphasized how this
transition was part of a lengthy process that stretches from new perceptions and knowledge to
new forms.45

2011), supra note 2, 21.

\[44\] This is seen, for example, in the pattern of delay in the application of Bahá’u’lláh’s laws. For a discussion of this theme, see Roshan Danesh,
“The Politics of Delay—Social Meanings and the Historical Treatment of Bahá’í Law,” World Order 35.3 (2004): 33–45.

\[45\] For example, see Shoghi Effendi’s letter, “The Unfoldment of World Civilization,” The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh: Selected Letters, first
pocket-size edition (Wilmette: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1991), 161–206.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes this long-term process, in somewhat metaphorical terms, in the
following way:

> Development and progression imply gradual stages or degrees. For example, spiritual
> advancement may be likened to the light of the early dawn. Although this dawn light
> is dim and pale, a wise man who views the march of the sunrise at its very beginning
> can foretell the ascendancy of the sun in its full glory and effulgence. He knows for
> a certainty that it is the beginning of its manifestation and that later it will assume
> great power and potency. Again, for example, if he takes a seed and observes that it
> is sprouting, he will know assuredly that it will ultimately become a tree. Now is the
> beginning of the manifestation of the spiritual power, and inevitably the potency of its
> life forces will assume greater and greater proportions. Therefore, this twentieth century
> is the dawn, or beginning, of spiritual illumination, and it is evident that day by day
> it will advance. It will reach such a degree that spiritual effulgences will overcome
> the physical, so that divine susceptibilities will overpower material intelligence and the
> heavenly light dispel and banish earthly darkness. Divine healing shall purify all ills,
> and the cloud of mercy will pour down its rain. The Sun of Reality will shine, and all
> the earth shall put on its beautiful green carpet. Among the results of the manifestation
> of spiritual forces will be that the human world will adapt itself to a new social form,
> the justice of God will become manifest throughout human affairs, and human equality
> will be universally established.46

A third challenge to this vision of social change would be a failure to privilege unity at all times
and in all contexts. The constant litmus test for individual and collective efforts at change is the
measure and standard of unity, and includes our own thoughts and actions in relation to others,
such as, for example, whether in one’s own mind one draws distinctions between categories
of individuals within the Bahá’í community, in society, or in the world as a whole. It also is
the measure for community life as a whole. To the degree that community life is fractured,
divided, uninspired, or apathetic, one will ultimately find weaknesses and misunderstandings
in the nature and substance of unity that has been and must needs be created. Finally, in terms
