        Correlating Mystical Experience to the Knowledge of God

Introduction

This paper addresses the theme of this conference, mysticism and the Bahá’í
writings, in the dual perspective of philosophical theology, and the psychology of
religion, a perspective that is based on the Bahá'í sacred writings in correlation to
both Bahá'í and non-Bahá'í theology; that is, it engages in a correlation of the beliefs
of the Bahá'í Faith with its own belief system and with that of non-Bahá'í theologians
and scholars. As the title indicates, a correlation is made between mystical experience
and the knowledge of God. The thesis of this paper is not a novel one but it is one that
has great bearing on the epistemological understanding of religion; namely, that
theology, which I am defining simply as "the knowledge of God," and mystical
experience are not two distinct and unrelated forms of activity, but rather expressions
of one manifold. In other words, experience and knowledge — in this case mystical
experience and the knowledge of God — in circuitous fashion, inform and depend
upon one other. This process I am calling symbiosis. Such a process, I point out, is
not essentially speculative, as it might first appear, but is rather empirical and
commonplace since experience has always been a fundamental component of
learning whether scientific or humanistic.

I shall be validating this thesis through a general rather than "hard proof"

discussion of the following points: (1) Debunking certain objections to mysticism (2)
Underscoring the need to validate mystical experience in Bahá'í scholarship (3)
Outlining four basic characteristics of mysticism (4) Discussing symbiosis in relation
to the epistemology of The Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys and the Kitab-i-Iqán
through a correlation to the metaphysics of inner experience of St. Augustine (5)
Symbiosis shall also be discussed by way of correlation to the views of David Tracy,
one of Christendom's current foremost pluralist theologians and the genial Father
Thomas Merton, one of the twentieth centuries most prolific writers on things
spiritual and theological. (6) Considerations of Bahá'u'lláh's universe of the seven
valleys will be discussed as being within the realm of the attainable rather than
unattainable spiritual experiences.

A Few Methodological Observations

Before proceeding, I open a brief parenthesis on a question that in the 1970's
and 1980's sparked a lengthy discussion and debate within the study of religion. I
refer to the question of methodology, a question that relates directly to the work of all
Bahá'í scholars and particularly to those scholars engaged in textual criticism or
analysis. We all agree, of course, that any Bahá'í theology, a concept that was until
recently looked upon with extreme scepticism in some circles of the Bahá'í Faith, be
text-rooted. But I think it is vitally important that scriptural statements which are
brought to light through the work of textualists, those who engage in translation of
scripture with learned commentary, be correlated, to use a seminal concept of Shoghi
Effendi, to the concerns of science and non-Bahá'í higher thought. Correlation is a
method and indeed a philosophy in itself, over which I have lingered in one section of
my current study of the writings of Shoghi Effendi. Before proceeding, I make a few
brief comments about it here.

As you know, Shoghi Effendi advocated a method of correlation in order to
relate the Bahá'í Faith "to modern aspects of philosophy and science" and "to
correlate" the Bahá'í Faith to "all the progressive movements and thoughts being put
forth today"[1] and "to investigate and analyze the principles of the Faith and to
correlate them with the modern aspects of philosophy and science."[2] The following
statement, through his secretary, also links Bahá'í scholarship to the principle of
correlation:

> The Cause needs more Bahá'í scholars, people who not only are devoted to
> it and believe in it and are anxious to tell others about it, but also who have
> a deep grasp of the Teachings and their significance, and who can correlate
> its beliefs with the current thoughts and problems of the people of the
> world.[3]

Another letter containing similar phraseology says that scholars should be
capable of : "...correlating our teachings to the current thoughts of leaders of
society."[4] These phrases "...correlating our teachings to the current thoughts of
leaders of society." and "with the current thoughts and problems of the peoples of the
world" should serve to bring Bahá'í scholarship down out of the ivory tower and into
the "real world" by allowing scholars of all legitimate types and tendencies to engage
in what Wittgenstein called, in another context, praxis, a term that has been imported
into theology by such thinkers as the University of Chicago's David Tracy, to refer to
the practical application of theological principles.[5] In hermeneutics, praxis also
refers to the actual interpretation of texts rather than the theories upon which
hermeneutics is based.

As indicated by the current state of Bahá'í scholarship, subjective
hermeneutics, that is, scholarly applications of scripture to other areas of the
curriculum, is practically non-existent. There is little work being done that provides
some wider overarching meaning of scripture that correlates its significance to the
human condition and to related fields of scientific or scholarly inquiry. It seems likely
that this development will eventually emerge as the important foundational work of
translation and commentary goes forward, reaches a plateau phase and begins to
diversify. More subjective, wide-ranging and allusive approaches will no doubt build
on the valuable contribution currently being made by those textualists working in the
tafsír tradition.

Although this is not the place to go into this question in any detail, Shoghi
Effendi's recognition and recommendation of the principle of correlation finds a
parallel in the more complex principle of the same name employed by the great
systematic theologian Paul Tillich (1886-1965). Tillich's monumental three volume
work, the Systematic Theology (1951-1963),[6] is based upon a method of correlation,
one that is basically apologetic. Tillich who was both an essentialist and existentialist
theologian explained that the epistemological method of correlation is understood as
"interdependence of two independent factors" which exist "between existential
questions and theological answers."[7] Tillich's point on the convergence between the
temporal, existentialist `situation' and `the power of the eternal message' can be
applied grosso modo to `Abdu'l-Bahá's distinction made between the revelation of
eternal spiritual principles within the various social settings and conditions that occur
within the temporal flux of the history of civilizations.[8] I also note in passing that
Plato in The Republic put forward a correlative principle of education when he said:
"...Some will then be chosen for higher privilege. The studies which they pursued
without order in their early years will now be brought together, and the students will
see the relationship of these studies to one another and to truth." "Yes," he said. "That
is the only kind of knowledge which takes lasting root."[9]

I think one can apply Tillich's point, without fear of contradiction, to the
method of question and answer as a learning style or mode of knowledge employed in
such texts as the Questions and Answers[10] section of Bahá'u'lláh's The Kitáb-i-Aqdas
and `Abdu'l-Bahá's Some Answered Questions.[11] I mention in passing that I have in
my current work in progress, argued that the correlation of question and answer in
The Kitáb-i-Aqdas and `Abdu'l-Bahá's Some Answered Questions presents two
models of truth, open and closed.[12] But suffice it to say that the method of question
and answer has profounder implications than we sometimes realise, as does the
method of correlation itself..

Debunking Objections to Mysticism

After these opening remarks, I come to the main arguments of the paper. The
charge that genuine mystical experience is a manifestation of nothing but various
forms of mental pathology whether hysteria, epilepsy or insanity seems to me to be
without foundation. Individuals who are mentally ill may experience isolated
identifiers of mystical experience such as out-of-body experiences or mind/body
disassociation in which functional anaesthesia may or may not occur — trance-like
states — but these indicators, as William James says in The Varieties of Religious
Experience (1901-1902) are only "superficial medical talk."[13] They do not "inquire
into their fruits for life."[14] In Bahá'í scholarship, Moojan Momen's "The Psychology
of Mysticism and its Relationship to the Bahá'í Faith" in the Bahá'í Studies Bulletin
(1984) examines the topic from a clinical point of view. Depending on the reading
given, Dr. Momen's paper could be cited either to validate the mystical exprience or
to explain it away. The clincal data that he advances could be read to indicate that in
brain studies the chemical apparatus does indeed exist for the possibility of mystical
experience to take place. On the other hand, a more skeptical reading would find that
such experiences are largely explained in terms of biochemical reactions.[15]

We may certainly agree with Dr. Momen that pathology sometimes
masquerades as mysticism or that mystical states resemble in some of their features
drug-induced states of consciousness. But when one reads accounts of the mystics
themselves, their speech is sometimes punctuated with that joy or delight which
reflects what William James calls in the Gifford Lectures of 1901, published as his
classic work The Varieties of Religious Experience, a generally "optimistic"[16] frame
of mind, expressive of what James has called a "religion of healthy-mindedness."[17]

The fact remains that true mystics, whatever St. John of the Cross-like "dark
nights of the soul"[18] they might experience on the spiritual journey, even if these
dark nights may take on at times certain pathological aspects remain, in William
James' phrase, "healthy-minded" individuals. However, we should not be surprised by
this. Bahá'u'lláh clearly summons the "true seeker" to attain the presence of God and
any mystical states attained as a result of the seeker's ardent search to reach the
Celestial City of the Word of God, he describes in terms of a profuse mystical
rhapsody or ecstasy. However, on a cautionary note, Shoghi Effendi, in a letter to an
individual that I shall return to later, has also indicated certain cautions vis-à-vis
seeking out or pursuing what we might call self-generated mystical experiences.[19]

Despite the varieties that mark their idiosyncratic subjective experiences, the
unanimous voice with which mystics speak of the supernatural states of the soul
interacting intimately with the Divine or with spiritual forces in transcendent worlds,
creates in those who seek to share in these experiences a willingness to listen to their
voice. The mystics offer to those who have not had the experience "hypotheses"[20] as

William James has written, of a divine life which is more dramatic and real than
anything thus far imagined or experienced.

Aside from the associations with mental pathology, there have been two other
main objections to mysticism. The first is that mysticism is only a pseudo form of
knowledge, an intensely personal and erratic subjective experience inaccessible to the
explorations of the philosopher who makes use of discursive reason in analysing the
world. The other objection is that mysticism — and this objection has also been made
to the quality of the faith state itself — is a privileged experience of grace and lacks
universal public accessibility. The second objection will be addressed below. As for
the first, it has already been debunked by Max Weber in his famous book The
Sociology of Religion. I quote Weber:

> The unique character of mystical knowledge consists in the fact that,
> although it becomes more incommunicable the more strongly it is
> characterized by idiosyncratic content, it is nevertheless, recognized as
> knowledge. For mystical knowledge is not new knowledge of any facts or
> doctrines, but rather the perception of an overall meaning in the world. This
> usage of "knowledge" is intended wherever the terms occurs in the
> numerous formulations of mystics; it denotes a practical form of
> knowledge. Such gnosis is basically a "possession" of something from
> which there may be derived a new practical orientation to the world, and
> under certain circumstances even new and communicable items of
> knowledge. But even these items will constitute knowledge of values and
> non-values within the world.[21]

The second objection, that the world of mysticism is a closed and private world
fails in the light of two factors: (1) the universality of divine love (2) the efficacy of
prayer and meditation as two of the most profound forms of mystical feeling and
discovery. Although the extra-mundane forms of peak mystical experience would
appear to be reserved for a relative few, mysticism reveals nonetheless a more
universal and democratic face in another of its modes as the practice of divine love.
Since the practice of divine love is an elemental form of mysticism, then all who
practice the love of God share in this mysticism of love, degrees of love
notwithstanding. Mysticism as the practice of divine love puts the mystical quest on a
potentially universal footing, and opens a gate by which all who practice may enter.

The Need to Validate Mystical Experience in Bahá'í Scholarship

As I have written in Dimensions in Spirituality, "it is regrettable that very little
Bahá'í scholarship to date has explored the topic of mysticism in a positive light."[22] I
have in chapter three of that same book explored certain general aspects of mysticism

under the heads "The Alchemy of Spiritual Transformation," "The Mystical
Dimension," "Mysticism and the Deed," "The Lunar Phase Model of the
Awakening," "The New Birth Model of the Awakening," and "Comparing the Bahá'í
and Christian Experience of New Birth." There are, of course, direct connections
between spirituality and mysticism since prayer and meditation are common elements
to both phenomena. I have devoted chapter four "The Mystic Sense: Prayer and
Meditation" to this subject.

However, the examination of mysticism in a Bahá'í perspective by scholars is
not entirely a tabula rasa and I mention here just a few titles. In 1953 physicist Glenn
Shook wrote Mysticism, Science and Revelation in straightforward language which
gives an instructive account of mysticism in Bahá'í perspective. The book by Randie
Gottlieb and Steven Gottlieb, Once to Every Man and Nation. Stories About
Becoming a Bahá'í (1985), whose half title Once to Every Man and Nation is taken
from James Russell Lowell's (1819-1891) anti-slavery poem of the same name.
Although the main intent of this book is not to detail individual mystical experiences,
in the telling one realises that Bahá'ís have indeed undergone mystical experiences in
the process of being guided to the Bahá'í Faith.[23] Rona M. Freeman's vision of
Bahá'u'lláh, "The Figure in the Red Robe" is, for example, just one of these accounts.

In addition to Bahá'u'lláh's seminal mystical treatises The Seven Valleys (Haft
Vádí) and The Four Valleys (Cháhár Vádí), there are numerous mystical tablets of
Bahá'u'lláh from the Baghdad Period (1853-1863) such as the Lawh-i-Kull al-Ta'am
(The Tablet of All Food) and the pre-Baghdad Rashh-i-'Ama' ("The Sprinkling of the
Cloud of Unknowing") which have been translated by our learned friend Stephen
Lambden and which are available either through such publications as Bahá'í Studies
Bulletin or privately on the Internet. Other mystical tablets have been mentioned by
Shoghi Effendi on pp. 140-141 of God Passes By. I mention also Jalil Mahmoudi's
article "Irfán, Gnosis, or Mystical Knowledge" published in World Order (1973) as
being a thoughtful, instructive contribution to the topic. However, we should be
oblivious to the fact that the Guardian described The Seven Valleys as "...a treatise
that may well be regarded as His greatest mystical composition."[24] Statement of the
obvious though it may be, mysticism, at least in the experiences of Bahá'ís, cannot
become an object of scholarly endeavour and community interest unless such
experiences are recorded and researched. Otherwise, they remain unknown, private
events from which others cannot benefit through either reflection or study.

Four Characteristics of Mystical Experience

I define mysticism simply as the soul's vivid attainment of the presence of God.

Mystical experience, however one defines it, and while it is a very diverse
phenomenon, exhibits at least the following four common characteristics. (We might

also refer to such experiences as "spiritual reality experiences" or "epiphanic
moments" since the word mysticism, because its prefix is identical to its homonym
"mist," suggests something vague or vaporous).The following four characteristics are,
of course, not exhaustive.

(1) According to personal testimony, the mystical experience is the most direct,
concrete and vivid of human experiences surpassing everyday mundane
consciousness. They confer an unusual apocalyptic certitude. Such experiences are
reported as being so distinctive and extraordinary that it is impossible to mistake
them for other forms of consciousness. The mystic knows that he or she is in reality
(Al Haqq).

(2) The literature of mysticism with reason insists on the ineffable or indescribable
nature of the mystical awakening. Bahá'u'lláh himself constantly refers to the inability
of simple words to capture the experiences that originate in the invisible, divine
worlds. One of the more widely reported and common of mystical happenings is the
evangelical Christian "born again" experience which is not entirely alien to Bahá'í
spirituality. While the qualitative understanding of this experience is different in the
two religions, Bahá'u'lláh does indeed refer to his followers as being "born again" in
the Prayers and Meditations of Bahá'u'lláh in which the Supreme Manifestation of
God says: "I render Thee thanks, therefore, and extol Thee, in the name of all them
that are dear to Thee, for that Thou hast caused them to be born again, by reason of
the living waters which have flowed down out of the mouth of Thy will."[25]

We should not, however, insist too strongly on the ineffable nature of mystical
experience, for to do so would make mysticism impervious to the work of the scholar.
Mysticism, while its first court of appeal may lie within the subjectivities of
individual certitude, must also present its findings to the more detached and objective
school of reason and analysis. William James, moreover, in spite of the positive
claims he makes for the outlook of the mystic, has also recorded some reservations in
The Varieties of Religious Experience with regard to the mystic's claims. According
to James, although the mystic's supernatural experiences may confer psychic certitude
upon the soul making the mystic "invulnerable" in James' word in his/her
convictions,[26] these rare experiences confer upon the mystic no special authority that
would warrant our uncritical acceptance of such experiences or the adoption of the
personal lifestyle of the mystic.[27]

Shoghi Effendi's caution about mystical experiences mentioned above is
pertinent here. In a letter written on his behalf on October 25, 1942, the Guardian
stated:

> Truly mystical experiences based on reality are very rare, and we can
readily see how dangerous it is for people to go groping about in the

darkness of their imagination after the true thing. That is why, as you point
> out, we are warned against all psychical practices by the Master. If we are
> going to have some deeply spiritual experience, we can rest assured that
> God will vouchsafe it to us without our having to look for it.[28]

Notice also that in this response, Shoghi Effendi distinguished mystical from psychic
experiences.

(3) The mystical experience conveys an unmistakable sense of certitude. There is no
shadow of a doubt in your mind that this experience may be a waking dream or
reverie or some murky, ill-defined half-experience being generated by your
subconscious. The mystical experience is simply a direct experience of the divine, a
"close encounter" with a transcendent order of being or with a transcendent Being.

(4) The mystical experience is a "hands on" direct encounter with the deeper
dimensions of the soul itself, or with Bahá'u'lláh or with those various and sundry
spiritual states that are described in scripture and spiritual literature. The mystic
experiences first hand, directly and in a practical sense, as Max Weber has indicated
in the phrase quoted earlier "...a practical form of knowledge." What for other
remains just an effort of the imagination, or is a remote, inferred or first level spiritual
happening is for the mystic, the real thing. In this sense, the mystical experience
results in a deepening of faith, for the one so "touched by the Absolute" knows with
certainty about the spiritual things that have been visited upon him, not just
theoretically, but by direct experience. In this sense, mysticism can be viewed as a
small `r' revelation or disclosure of truth to the seeking soul..

Professor George Albert Coe of the Union Theological Seminary in New York,
author of an early work in the psychology of religion called The Psychology of
Religion (1916) states in his chapter on mysticism that the mystical experience
produces the "Now I know for myself" reaction which, he says, "is extremely
satisfying to the individual who has it, even regardless of its particular content."[29]
Thus, mysticism must be included in the broad definition of the search for truth. Coe
writes: "Mysticism fascinates men partly because it produces, more largely because it
promises, this exquisitely satisfying sense of individual selfhood."[30] The mystical
experience helps, then, to heal the divided self and produces wholeness in the
individual.

The Symbiosis of Knowledge and Experience

Bahá'u'lláh's two main mystical treatises The Seven Valleys (Haft Vádí) and
The Four Valleys (Cháhár Vádí) conjointly with His preeminent doctrinal work, the
Kitáb-i-Iqán, validate the thesis that knowledge and spiritual experience are not two

distinct and separate entities but rather form one manifold. And it seems to me that in
this sense, epistemology (the modes of knowledge) and ontology (the experience of
self and being) are inextricably linked in a Bahá'í understanding. We should not lose
sight of the fact that the Iqán, notwithstanding the fact that it is Bahá'u'lláh
preeminent doctrinal work, also contains strong mystical elements and should be read
conjointly with The Seven Valleys (Haft Vádí) and The Four Valleys (Cháhár Vádí),
and for that matter The Hidden Words (Kalimát-i-Maknúnih) which also has its own
distinctive mystical language.

To illustrate this root principle of the symbiosis of knowledge and experience
which I am underscoring here, we find that the mysticism of the Iqán depicts the
knowledge of God as a union of the soul with God which Bahá'u'lláh describes in an
a transpersonal evocative language of spiritual passion, and through an exhortation to
observe a spirituality of detachment, based on the practice of ideal spiritual virtues
and discipline of spirit which will bring about the hieros gamos or the divine
marriage of the soul with God. The sacred marriage of the soul with God in the form
of reaching the celestial city of the Word of God,[31] which is the great pilgrimage of
all pilgrimages, is the end point of the "true seeker's" search at which certitude is
everlastingly conferred. Bahá'u'lláh writes in the Iqán: "Va (and) mojahedeen fi Allah
(valiant in God) baad az enghetaae'(separation) az má savah (from all else but [Him])
chenán (in this way) beh án madineh owns girand (accustomed) keh ánee (moment)
az án (from it) monfak nashavand"(monfak shodan'to separate) (owns gereftan'to be
accustomed)” "They that valiantly labour in quest of God's will, when once they have
renounced all else but Him, will be so attached and wedded to that City that a
moment's separation from it would to them be unthinkable."[32] Incidentally, Shoghi
Effendi's translation techniques, as revealed in this verse, and as is true for the
Guardian's renderings generally, indicate a stylised, poetical translation which is
somewhat more elaborate and effusive than the simple and direct prose of the Persian.

Bahá'u'lláh's epistemology, when viewed strictly in the light of the encounter
between the seeker and the Manifestation of God, is based on a radical rejection of
worldly or acquired knowledge, the Sufi "veil of knowledge," so that the seeker may
experience unimpeded the true knowledge of God, that Bahá'u'lláh equates, not with
the ratiocinations and excogitations of the propositions of religion, but with the
immediate and intuitive living experience of God, surging within the heart of that
"true seeker" who chooses to love and to seek Him.

The perspective of symbiosis will greatly assist in overcoming the subject-
object dichotomy that has plagued western thinkers for centuries and to help restore
that unity of "heart and head" which will produce a more holistic understanding of
spiritual anthropology. The heart (Ar. ' qalb, fú'ád ('inner heart) ), as you know,
Bahá'u'lláh has called "the seat of the revelation of the inner mysteries of God."[33] but
it has, in Bahá'í theology, clear intellectual, percpetive or understanding functions.

Bahá'u'lláh has, of course, put forth this same principle of symbiosis elsewhere.

In the tablet of Tajallíyát (effulgences) He says: "True belief in God and recognition
of Him cannot be complete save by observance of whatsoever hath been decreed by
Him and set down in the Book by the Pen of Glory."[34] Actually, I suspect that the
older translation in the 1960 edition of The Divine Art of Living comes closer to the
meaning of the original. It reads: "Faith in God, and the knowledge of Him, cannot be
fully realized except through believing in all that hath proceeded from Him, and by
practicing all that He hath commanded in the Book from the Supreme Pen."[35] It is
this word practicing that I want to underscore, for we may simply observe without
practicing. In light of these considerations, one might present a modern equation of
reality (Al Haqq) as a synthesis of theory and practice as follows: Theory (cognitive
knowledge) + praxis (spirituality/mysticism) ' Reality.

This view of symbiosis should be a consolation rather than an alienation to
those of scientific bent. For, the scientist of religion knows that only through the
practical demonstration can the theoretical be proven. As perennial philosopher
Aldous Huxley reminds us in his introduction to the Bagavad Gita in homely
"barnyard" metaphors attributed to Buddha and Muhammad, the theologian whose
metaphysics is self-unrealised can be compared to a herdsman of other men's cows
(Buddha) and/or just an ass bearing a load of books (Muhammad).[36] Purely
theoretical approaches to the study of religion would appear to fall into the trap of
`Abdu'l-Bahá's pointed critique of religion as "the noise, the clamor, the hollowness
of religious doctrine."[37] Also, Bahá'u'lláh's short but nonetheless telling phrase
inextricably links the deed or praxis with knowledge: "An act, however infinitesimal,
is, when viewed in the mirror of the knowledge of God, mightier than a mountain."[38]

Correlating Bahá'í Mystical Theology to St. Augustine's Metaphysics of Inner
Experience

According to the process of symbiosis that I have been explaining, spiritual
experience always exists concurrently and co-dependently with forms of the
knowledge of God. This correlation of mystical experience to theological knowledge
is a basic point, not only as I hold, of Bahá'u'lláh's Book of Certitude, but also of St.
Augustine's epistemology. Now I should say that I like Augustine's epistemology
very much but I am less fond of his moral theology, such as his doctrine of original
sin, which has been greatly coloured by his own struggles with sexuality. However,
St. Augustine's theology was largely a "metaphysics of inner experience."[39] The
great mass of Augustine's writings which are topical rather than systematic are held
together by the remarkable experiences of his life and his strong personal convictions
which aim at all times for "the principle of the absolute and immediate certainty of
consciousness"[40] as expressed in his saying In interiore Homine habitat veritas,
"truth inhabits the inner man."[41] In this strong validation of inner experience, which

also defines the perspective of The Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys, Augustine is
a disciple of both Origen and Plotinus.

In his search for knowledge, Augustine was preoccupied by the question of
certitude and I draw your attention to the fact that the title of Bahá'u'lláh's preeminent
doctrinal work contains this very word, Iqán. Augustine desired, not only to know,
but he desired to know with certainty, that is beyond doubt, that what he knew was
true. And truth for Augustine was by definition eternal. So the question of certitude as
he raised it was: "How does the finite, changing human mind attain certain
knowledge of eternal truths which rule and govern the mind and so transcend it."[42]
This, I might suggest, was one of Bahá'u'lláh's main preoccupations in unfolding to us
the story of progressive revelation and the journey of the soul to reach the Divine
Word, the Celestial City or the Bride of God in the Iqán.

Such observations about the attainment of certitude in acquiring the knowledge
of God (theology) must derive also from the recognition that the quest for
understanding of both epistemology and ontology must necessarily include the
knowledge of self. And here I would define "self" as an infinitely diminished
reflection of the Nafs Illáhí within the human soul, a lesser divine reflection of the
"Self of God" which Juan Cole has plausibly defined as seeming "to refer to the
totality of God's active attributes, of which the prophets and messengers are
manifestations.[43] The knowledge of self is both instrument and medium of both
knowledge and experience, a medium for the correspondence of the outer forms of
knowledge (the objective forms) with the inner self (the subjective forms) to be both
processed and in a sense, possessed.

This exist-ential knowledge of self vehicles the knowledge of God primarily as
an individual experience, something immediately apprehended by the soul, which in a
kind of "peak experience,"[44] and as the result of ethical discipline, ardent search and
spiritual passion, breaks in on the soul in a way that Bahá'u'lláh has described in a
remarkable epiphanic moment as "the mystic Herald, bearing the joyful tidings of the
Spirit"[45] to the seeker, waking her entire being to a new, delightful, heretofore never
experienced spirituality.

The Benefits of Mystical Theology for Bahá'í Scholasticism

David Tracy of the University of Chicago's divinity school and one of
Christendom's preeminent theologians today, has outlined some of the benefits of
mysticism, contemplation and spirituality to the performative aspects of theology
which are instructive for all Bahá'í scholars. Tracy declares the present necessity of a
much-needed collaboration between scholasticism and spirituality which is the

greater part of mysticism. For mysticism is the part but spirituality is the whole.

Tracey says:

> “I think that theology will be better off the more theologians attempt to
> recover a relationship to traditions of spirituality and thus undo the
> separation of theology and spirituality that developed after medieval
> scholasticism, which made a distinction between the two without
> separating them.”[46]

I emphasize Tracy's point that the rift between theology and spirituality
occurred in the post scholastic age. In medieval scholasticism, whether Christian or
Islamic, they were one. I would suggest that the former practice of scholasticism
comes very close to the idea of true Bahá'í scholarship, with a possible reserve on its
love of disputation. I would also suggest that Bahá'í scholarship, which is modern day
scholasticism, is far from being what has been called "dusty pedantry and irrelevant
distinction making."[47]

In an instructive 1998 cross-cultural and comparative religious study called
Scholasticism, editor José Ignacio Cabezón points out 8 fruitful inter-religious
characteristics of scholasticism which are central, not just to the study of religion, but
to the history of the development of western thought itself.[48] Cabezón points out that
"Even the early Heidegger believed that the scholastic method in its true form
represented a fresh perspective on the problems of philosophy, one that, concerned
more the actual doing of metaphysics than with methodological speculation about
how to do it, could be of value in dispelling what he considered the oblivion of
being."[49] So it would seem, then, the work of this generation of Bahá'í scholars has
much greater import than perhaps they themselves realise, for the fruits of such
labours are contributing, in a larger perspective, to the development of a whole new
east-west philosophical/theological dialectic.

But to return to David Tracy, for him, the "crucial part" of a synthesis of the
spiritual and theological dimensions would be a recovery of both the mystical and
prophetic traditions.[50] Tracy's comment should excite the imagination of any Bahá'í
who has carefully read The Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys and the Kitáb-i-Iqán
for these are the locus classicus of Bahá'í works of the mystical and prophetic
traditions respectively. David Tracy's interlocutor Thomas Levergood in the same
article I refer to above, explains that the value of the recovery of mysticism for the
theologian calls for, among other things, the virtue of detachment, that spiritual
attribute to which Bahá'u'lláh has given absolute pre-eminence in the search for God.
In the prologue to The Book of Certitude, Bahá'u'lláh declares: "No man shall attain
the shores of the ocean of true understanding except he be detached from all that is in
heaven and on earth."[51] Levergood names detachment as one of the multiple
functions in the mystical search for truth:

The mystical tradition calls for disciplines of detachment, conversion, and
> self-examination so that the mystic-theologian has a kind of grasping of
> truth. In a sense, mysticism suggests a participatory model of knowledge
> and makes an important claim for considering transformation as a
> subjective condition of knowledge, something that modern thought has
> difficulty accounting for.[52]

As one might expect from these statements, prayer still has a place in David Tracy's
call for modern day theology to recover its spiritual traditions. He speaks of "a
prayerful reading of the Scriptures of the church...."[53] a statement which concords
perfectly with a Bahá'í understanding of the reading of its own scriptures.

Tracey's homologue, also a Roman Catholic, is the great spiritual genius, the
prolific Father Thomas Merton. As an aside, it is no coincidence that both men are of
the Catholic faith since Catholicism, with its ancient tradition, has long recognized
the intimate connections between theology and spirituality, between study and the
activities of prayer and meditation. Merton makes the same point this way:

> Contemplation, far from being opposed to theology, is in fact the normal
> perfection of theology. We must not separate intellectual study of divinely
> revealed truth and contemplative experience of that truth as if they could
> never have anything to do with one another. On the contrary they are
> simply two aspects of the same thing. Dogmatic and mystical theology, or
> theology and "spirituality" are not to be set apart in mutually exclusive
> categories, as if mysticism were for saintly women and theological study
> were for practical, but, alas, unsaintly men. This fallacious division perhaps
> explains much that is actually lacking both in theology and in spirituality.
> But the two belong together, just as body and soul belong together. Unless
> there are united, there is no fervor, no life and no spiritual value in
> theology, no substance, no meaning and no sure orientation in the
> contemplative life.[54]

In the understanding of Bahá'í spirituality, there can be nothing more important than
prayer. And prayer, by `Abdu'l-Bahá's definition, is inseparable from spirituality and
hence mysticism. Notice the linking of the concepts of prayer and spirituality in this
quotation from `Abdu'l-Bahá:

> In all the worlds of existence there is nothing more important than prayer.
> Prayer confers spirituality on the heart. Spirituality is the greatest of God's
> gifts and life everlasting. It means turning to God.[55]

The same point did not escape Shoghi Effendi's notice when he defined "the universal
crisis affecting mankind" as being "essentially spiritual in its causes."[56] And in that

seminal quotation you know so well, that bears repeating here, Shoghi Effendi says
through his secretary:

> For the core of religious faith is that mystic feeling which unites man with
> God. This state of spiritual communion can be brought about and
> maintained by means of meditation and prayer. And this is the reason why
> Bahá'u'lláh has so much stressed the importance of worship. It is not
> sufficient for a believer merely to accept and observe the teachings. He
> should, in addition, cultivate the sense of spirituality which he can acquire
> chiefly by means of prayer. The Bahá'í Faith, like all other Divine
> Religions, is thus fundamentally mystic in character. Its chief goal is the
> development of the individual and society, through the acquisition of
> spiritual virtues and powers. It is the soul of man which has first to be fed.

And this spiritual nourishment prayer can best provide.[57]

Bahá'u'lláh's Universe of the Valleys: Unattainable Spiritual Experience?

It is a commonplace observation that when Bahá'u'lláh wrote The Seven Valleys
(Haft Vádí) and The Four Valleys (Cháhár Vádí), He was describing unattainable
spiritual experiences. This view, however, bears reconsideration. Although the
macro-mystical world of the soul in its interactions with God depicted by Bahá'u'lláh
may be beyond the psychology of the norm — and in some instances we clearly enter
the realm of "blown minds" — it is not so in every case. We are apt to forget that
within the universe He describes there are numerous micro spiritual worlds and states
that the ordinary seeker, I might suggest, in his or her own inner world has already
experienced. For otherwise, these works would be quite incomprehensible to any
reader.

For, to argue rhetorically, who has not experienced both the joy and the pain
that Bahá'u'lláh describes in The Valley of Love and The Valley of Contentment:
"The steed of this Valley is pain; and if there be no pain this journey will never
end."[58] and "From sorrow he turneth to bliss, from anguish to joy."[59] These
alternating human emotions are universal. There are, moreover, other universal
elements in Bahá'u'lláh's sacred narrative of the journey of the soul to God. These
include the ardour of search, the tests and difficulties along the way, and the final
happy reunification with the Beloved at journey's end, portrayed in Bahá'u'lláh's
beautiful and moving adaptation in The Seven Valleys(Haft Vádí) of Rumi's story in
the Mathnaví of the "The Unworthy Lover," the broken-hearted archtypical lover,
Majnún, who is relentlessly pursued by the night watchman, until, after making good
his escape by scaling a high wall, finds his beloved Laylí in a secret garden.[60] This
singular tale also firmly roots story in Bahá'í scripture and invites allegorical

interpretations of scripture. This story also raises a question since it takes place, not in
the valley of love, as we might expect, but in the valley of knowledge.

If Bahá'u'lláh's mystical treatise did not have some elements of universality and
accessibility, moreover, it would remain meaningless. It would be consequently self-
defeating for the seeker to regard the universe of the valleys as completely
unattainable, ideal spiritual experiences that are foreign to common mortals. For in
the Arabic prologue to The Seven Valleys Bahá'u'lláh, not only affirms, but seems to
expect, that the ultimate Sufí goal of self-evanescence (faná) and seeing God in
everything can be won:

> ...to the end...that every man thereby win his way to the summit of
> realities,(dharwat'al-haqá'iq), until none shall contemplate anything
> whatsoever but that he shall see God therein.[61]

One may consequently conclude that Bahá'u'lláh, in writing The Seven Valleys
and The Four Valleys, was not communicating unattainable spiritual experiences in a
purely private, evocative symbolism, but was describing the experiences that the
spiritualised soul could attain, or at the very least, strive for in the search to become
one with the Creator.[62] For Shoghi Effendi states that The Seven Valleys "describes
the seven stages which the soul of the seeker must needs traverse ere it can attain the
object of its existence."[63] I emphasize the phrase "must needs", for it indicates a sine
qua non, an absolute condition for the meeting of the soul with God. Further, the fact
that Shoghi Effendi included this work in the first canon of Bahá'í writings to be
translated into English indicates that the mystical genre is to be regarded as a
categorical imperative of the language of revelation, along with the doctrinal and
ethical categories established by the Iqán and The Hidden Words (Kalimát-i-
Maknúnih) which also form three fundamental categories of the phenomenology of
religion.

Love, that divine universal, as has often been remarked, is an ineffable
mystery. But this sense of mystery is at the heart of religion and, according to
Einstein, at the root of science.[64] Universal love, the love of God, is the sine qua non
of finding God in Bahá'u'lláh's universe of the valleys. This love is open and available
to everyone who seeks the Beloved. To the extent that we ardently seek this love, we
are all mystics:

> O My Brother! Until thou enter the Egypt of love, thou shalt never come to
> the Joseph of the Beauty of the Friend; and until, like Jacob, thou forsake
> thine outward eyes, thou shalt never open the eye of thine inward being;
> and until thou burn with the fire of love, thou shalt never commune with
> the Lover of Longing.[65]
Conclusion

I have argued in this paper for a correlation between mystical experience and
the knowledge of God and have pointed out the great need, just one of many in the
field of Bahá'í scholarship, to record, to study and to validate mystical experience. As
a field of scholarly study, mysticism cannot be neglected, not only because it
corresponds to one of the classical genres of Bahá'í scripture and the expression of
one of the perennial forms of the divine life of the soul, but also because it is closely
connected to the practice of Bahá'í spirituality through its chief components of prayer
and meditation. Mystical experience and spirituality are intimately connected to the
work of the scholar. Indeed they form part of that expression of worship that is Bahá'í
scholarship itself. An authentic Bahá'í scholar cannot practice self-unrealised
metaphysics. As for any Bahá'í, to be authentic and truly knowledgeable, the self of
the Bahá'í scholar must be a reflection of the work under study. The scholar must
read, as Bahá'u'lláh says, "the book of his own self (kitáb-i-nafs), rather than some
treatise on rhetoric."[66] Mystical experience should not be viewed by any Bahá'í as
being an unattainable spiritual event but something that may result as a consequence
of the grace of God and of the practice of spiritual discipline.
