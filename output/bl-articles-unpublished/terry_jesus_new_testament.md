INTRODUCTION

Jesus of Nazareth has been studied and written about from virtually every perspective
imaginable…He1 has been depicted as a Jewish prophet, hassid, rabbi, heretic, and zealot; as a
magician, healer, mystic, philosopher; as a failed leader and as a successful savior; as a Muslim;
as a Hindu avatara; as a son of God; and as God Himself. Oh yes, and, to give the scifi
enthusiasts their due, as a visitor from another planet or another world. While some readers are
satisfied with one or several of these depictions and wish to read no further, they won’t be picking
up this book and reading these essays. And if they do so, they should be prepared to see Jesus
from a new perspective, that articulated in the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, Who is accounted by
Bahá’ís to be the Founder of the Bahá’í Faith, and in the Writings and recorded utterances of His
eldest son, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and the writings of His great-grandson Shoghi Effendi, whom Bahá’ís
recognize as authoritative interpreters of Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings.

The compiler of this study has spent many years in a comparative study of the teachings of Jesus
and Bahá’u’lláh, as found in canonical and non-canonical sources. Most literature comparing the
two is written by fervent adherents either of Christianity or the Bahá’í Faith, who seek to reaffirm
the beliefs of their co-religionists, and persuade those from the “other side” to convert to their
way of thinking. This study will make no such attempt.

The reader should not feel the least bit obliged to agree with anything written here or to regard it
as opposed to an interpretation s/he has already found to be illuminating and congenial. Surely
we can all affirm that the Word of God is abstruse and hence susceptible to multiple
interpretations…and that we human beings often change our minds, change our perceptions,

1All pronouns referring to God, and referring to Jesus and John the Baptist, and to Muhammad,
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá have been capitalized, out of respect for the feelings of readers who revere
these religious figures and might possibly be offended if this convention had not been adopted. On the
other hand, all you readers who are not offended by lower case letters, please respect the feelings of the
readers who are, by not insisting that I decapitalize pronouns for future editions of this study. All
pronouns that were capitalized in cited texts have been preserved, and the same is true of pronouns that
were not capitalized in cited texts.

and sometimes even acknowledge to ourselves and to others that our prior understanding has
been erroneous.

In one of His treatises, Bahá’u’lláh succinctly articulated a principle which I have found to be of
great value and freely share with the reader2: “O My Brother, journey upon these planes in the
spirit of search, not in blind imitation. A true wayfarer will not be kept back by the bludgeon of
words nor debarred by the warning of allusions.” Another affirmation of this principle is in more
modern and less poetic language3: “The more we read the writings the more truths we can find
in them and the more we will see that our previous notions were erroneous.” This principle
should keep us humble, open to discovery, open to change. And so I say, “bon voyage!”

SCRIPTURE IN THE LIGHT OF PROGRESSIVE REVELATION

A cardinal theological principle of Bahá’u’lláh is that of progressive revelation, here articulated by Shoghi Effendi:

This same prophecy, we must furthermore recognize, attests the independent character of the
Bábí Dispensation and corroborates indirectly the truth that in accordance with the
principle of progressive revelation every Manifestation of God must needs
vouchsafe to the peoples of His day a measure of divine guidance ampler than any
which a preceding and less receptive age could have received or appreciated. For
this reason, and not for any superior merit which the Bahá'í Faith may be said to inherently
possess, does this prophecy bear witness to the unrivaled power and glory with which the
Dispensation of Bahá'u'lláh has been invested -- a Dispensation the potentialities of which we are
but beginning to perceive and the full range of which we can never determine.

The Faith of Bahá'u'lláh should indeed be regarded, if we wish to be faithful to the
tremendous implications of its message, as the culmination of a cycle, the final stage in a series
of successive, of preliminary and progressive revelations. These, beginning with
Adam and ending with the Báb, have paved the way and anticipated with an ever-increasing
emphasis the advent of that Day of Days in which He Who is the Promise of All Ages should be
made manifest.       (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Bahá’u’llah, pp. 102-103)

It should also be borne in mind that, great as is the power manifested by this Revelation and
however vast the range of the Dispensation its Author has inaugurated, it emphatically repudiates
the claim to be regarded as the final revelation of God's will and purpose for mankind. To hold
such a conception of its character and functions would be tantamount to a betrayal of its cause
and a denial of its truth. It must necessarily conflict with the fundamental principle which
constitutes the bedrock of Bahá'í belief, the principle that religious truth is not absolute but
relative, that Divine Revelation is orderly, continuous and progressive and not
spasmodic or final. Indeed, the categorical rejection by the followers of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh of
the claim to finality which any religious system inaugurated by the Prophets of the past may
advance is as clear and emphatic as their own refusal to claim that same finality for the
Revelation with which they stand identified. "To believe that all revelation is ended, that the
portals of Divine mercy are closed, that from the daysprings of eternal holiness no sun shall rise
again, that the ocean of everlasting bounty is forever stilled, and that out of the tabernacle of
ancient glory the Messengers of God have ceased to be made manifest" must constitute in the
eyes of every follower of the Faith a grave, an inexcusable departure from one of its most

cherished and fundamental principles. (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Bahá’u’llah, pp. 115-
116)

...Muhammadanism is not only the last of the world religions, but a fuller Revelation than any
one preceding it. The Qur'án is not only more authoritative than any previous religious gospel,
but it contains also much more; ordinances, teachings and precepts, which taken together
constitute a fuller Revelation of God's purpose and law to mankind than Christianity, Judaism or
any other previous Dispensation. This view is in complete accord with the Bahá'í
philosophy of progressive revelation, and should be thoroughly accepted and
taught by every loyal ... Bahá'í. (Shoghi Effendi, The Unfolding Destiny of the British
Bahá’í Community, p. 432)

Just as the organic evolution of mankind has been slow and gradual, and involved successively
the unification of the family, the tribe, the city-state, and the nation, so has the light
vouchsafed by the Revelation of God, at various stages in the evolution of religion,
and reflected in the successive Dispensations of the past, been slow and
progressive. Indeed the measure of Divine Revelation, in every age, has been
adapted to, and commensurate with, the degree of social progress achieved in that
age by a constantly evolving humanity.

"It hath been decreed by Us," explains Bahá'u'lláh, "that the Word of God, and all the
potentialities thereof, shall be manifested unto men in strict conformity with such conditions as
have been foreordained by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.... Should the Word be
allowed to release suddenly all the energies latent within it, no man could sustain the weight of so
mighty a Revelation." "All created things," 'Abdu'l-Bahá, elucidating this truth, has affirmed,
"have their degree or stage of maturity. The period of maturity in the life of a tree is the time of
its fruit-bearing....The animal attains a stage of full growth and completeness, and in the human
kingdom man reaches his maturity when the light of his intelligence attains its greatest power and
development...Similarly there are periods and stages in the collective life of humanity. At one
time it was passing through its stage of childhood, at another its period of youth, but now it has
entered its long-predicted phase of maturity, the evidences of which are everywhere
apparent....That which was applicable to human needs during the early history of the race can
neither meet nor satisfy the demands of this day, this period of newness and consummation.
Humanity has emerged from its former state of limitation and preliminary training. Man must
now become imbued with new virtues and powers, new moral standards, new capacities. New
bounties, perfect bestowals, are awaiting and already descending upon him. The gifts and
blessings of the period of youth, although timely and sufficient during the adolescence of
mankind, are now incapable of meeting the requirements of its maturity." "In every

Dispensation," He moreover has written, "the light of Divine Guidance has been focused upon
one central theme...In this wondrous Revelation, this glorious century, the foundation of the
Faith of God, and the distinguishing feature of His Law, is the consciousness of the oneness of
mankind." (Shoghi Effendi, The Promised Day is Come, pp. 118-119)

To attempt an exhaustive survey of the prophetic references to Bahá'u'lláh's Revelation would
indeed be an impossible task. To this the pen of Bahá'u'lláh Himself bears witness: "All the
Divine Books and Scriptures have predicted and announced unto men the advent of the Most
Great Revelation. None can adequately recount the verses recorded in the Books of former ages
which forecast this supreme Bounty, this most mighty Bestowal."

In conclusion of this theme, I feel, it should be stated that the Revelation identified with
Bahá'u'lláh abrogates unconditionally all the Dispensations gone before it, upholds
uncompromisingly the eternal verities they enshrine, recognizes firmly and absolutely the Divine
origin of their Authors, preserves inviolate the sanctity of their authentic Scriptures, disclaims any
intention of lowering the status of their Founders or of abating the spiritual ideals they inculcate,
clarifies and correlates their functions, reaffirms their common, their unchangeable and
fundamental purpose, reconciles their seemingly divergent claims and doctrines, readily and
gratefully recognizes their respective contributions to the gradual unfoldment of
one Divine Revelation, unhesitatingly acknowledges itself to be but one link in the
chain of continually progressive Revelations, supplements their teachings with such laws
and ordinances as conform to the imperative needs, and are dictated by the growing receptivity,
of a fast evolving and constantly changing society, and proclaims its readiness and ability to fuse
and incorporate the contending sects and factions into which they have fallen into a universal
Fellowship, functioning within the framework, and in accordance with the precepts, of a divinely
conceived, a world-unifying, a world-redeeming Order. (Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p. 99)

It should be borne in mind that the central Edifice of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, round which in the
fulness of time shall cluster such institutions of social service as shall afford relief to the suffering,
sustenance to the poor, shelter to the wayfarer, solace to the bereaved, and education to the
ignorant, should be regarded apart from these Dependencies, as a House solely designed and
entirely dedicated to the worship of God in accordance with the few yet definitely prescribed
principles established by Bahá'u'lláh in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. It should not be inferred, however,
from this general statement that the interior of the central Edifice itself will be converted into a
conglomeration of religious services conducted along lines associated with the traditional
procedure obtaining in churches, mosques, synagogues, and other temples of worship. Its various
avenues of approach, all converging towards the central Hall beneath its dome, will not serve as
admittance to those sectarian adherents of rigid formulae and man-made creeds, each bent,

according to his way, to observe his rites, recite his prayers, perform his ablutions, and display the
particular symbols of his faith, within separately defined sections of Bahá'u'lláh's Universal House
of Worship. Far from the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar offering such a spectacle of incoherent and
confused sectarian observances and rites, a condition wholly incompatible with the provisions of
the Aqdas and irreconcilable with the spirit it inculcates, the central House of Bahá'í worship,
enshrined within the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, will gather within its chastened walls, in a serenely
spiritual atmosphere, only those who, discarding forever the trappings of elaborate and
ostentatious ceremony, are willing worshipers of the one true God, as manifested in this age in
the Person of Bahá'u'lláh. To them will the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar symbolize the
fundamental verity underlying the Bahá'í Faith, that religious truth is not absolute
but relative, that Divine Revelation is not final but progressive. Theirs will be the
conviction that an all-loving and ever-watchful Father Who, in the past, and at various stages in
the evolution of mankind, has sent forth His Prophets as the Bearers of His Message and the
Manifestations of His Light to mankind, cannot at this critical period of their civilization
withhold from His children the Guidance which they sorely need amid the darkness which has
beset them, and which neither the light of science nor that of human intellect and wisdom can
succeed in dissipating. And thus having recognized in Bahá'u'lláh the source whence this celestial
light proceeds, they will irresistibly feel attracted to seek the shelter of His House, and congregate
therein, unhampered by ceremonials and unfettered by creed, to render homage to the one true
God, the Essence and Orb of eternal Truth, and to exalt and magnify the name of His
Messengers and Prophets Who, from time immemorial even unto our day, have, under divers
circumstances and in varying measure, mirrored forth to a dark and wayward world the light of
heavenly Guidance. (Shoghi Effendi, Bahá’í Administration, pp. 184-185)

Let no one, however, mistake my purpose. The Revelation, of which Bahá'u'lláh is the source
and center, abrogates none of the religions that have preceded it, nor does it attempt, in the
slightest degree, to distort their features or to belittle their value. It disclaims any intention of
dwarfing any of the Prophets of the past, or of whittling down the eternal verity of their
teachings. It can, in no wise, conflict with the spirit that animates their claims, nor does it seek to
undermine the basis of any man's allegiance to their cause. Its declared, its primary purpose is to
enable every adherent of these Faiths to obtain a fuller understanding of the religion with which
he stands identified, and to acquire a clearer apprehension of its purpose. It is neither eclectic in
the presentation of its truths, nor arrogant in the affirmation of its claims. Its teachings
revolve around the fundamental principle that religious truth is not absolute but
relative, that Divine Revelation is progressive, not final. Unequivocally and without
the least reservation it proclaims all established religions to be divine in origin, identical in their
aims, complementary in their functions, continuous in their purpose, indispensable in their value
to mankind.

"All the Prophets of God," asserts Bahá'u'lláh in the Kitáb-i-Íqán, "abide in the same
tabernacle, soar in the same heaven, are seated upon the same throne, utter the same speech,
and proclaim the same Faith." From the "beginning that hath no beginning," these Exponents of
the Unity of God and Channels of His incessant utterance have shed the light of the invisible
Beauty upon mankind, and will continue, to the "end that hath no end," to vouchsafe fresh
revelations of His might and additional experiences of His inconceivable glory. To contend that
any particular religion is final, that "all Revelation is ended, that the portals of Divine mercy are
closed, that from the daysprings of eternal holiness no sun shall rise again, that the ocean of
everlasting bounty is forever stilled, and that out of the Tabernacle of ancient glory the
Messengers of God have ceased to be made manifest" would indeed be nothing less than sheer
blasphemy.

"They differ," explains Bahá'u'lláh in that same epistle, "only in the intensity of their
revelation and the comparative potency of their light." And this, not by reason of any inherent
incapacity of any one of them to reveal in a fuller measure the glory of the Message with which
He has been entrusted, but rather because of the immaturity and unpreparedness of the age He
lived in to apprehend and absorb the full potentialities latent in that Faith.

"Know of a certainty," explains Bahá'u'lláh, "that in every Dispensation the light of
Divine Revelation has been vouchsafed to men in direct proportion to their spiritual capacity.
Consider the sun. How feeble its rays the moment it appears above the horizon. How gradually
its warmth and potency increase as it approaches its zenith, enabling meanwhile all created
things to adapt themselves to the growing intensity of its light. How steadily it declines until it
reaches its setting point. Were it, all of a sudden, to manifest the energies latent within it, it
would, no doubt, cause injury to all created things.... In like manner, if the Sun of Truth were
suddenly to reveal, at the earliest stages of its manifestation, the full measure of the potencies
which the providence of the Almighty has bestowed upon it, the earth of human understanding
would waste away and be consumed; for men's hearts would neither sustain the intensity of its
revelation, nor be able to mirror forth the radiance of its light. Dismayed and overpowered, they
would cease to exist."

It is for this reason, and this reason only, that those who have recognized the Light of
God in this age, claim no finality for the Revelation with which they stand identified, nor
arrogate to the Faith they have embraced powers and attributes intrinsically superior to, or
essentially different from, those which have characterized any of the religious systems that
preceded it.

Does not Bahá'u'lláh Himself allude to the progressiveness of Divine
Revelation and to the limitations which an inscrutable Wisdom has chosen to
impose upon Him? What else can this passage of the Hidden Words imply, if not that He
Who revealed it disclaimed finality for the Revelation entrusted to Him by the Almighty? "O Son
of Justice! In the night-season the beauty of the immortal Being hath repaired from the emerald
height of fidelity unto the Sadratu'l-Muntaha, and wept with such a weeping that the concourse
on high and the dwellers of the realms above wailed at His lamenting. Whereupon there was
asked, Why the wailing and weeping? He made reply: As bidden I waited expectant upon the hill
of faithfulness, yet inhaled not from them that dwell on earth the fragrance of fidelity. Then
summoned to return I beheld, and lo! certain doves of holiness were sore tried within the claws of
the dogs of earth. Thereupon the Maid of Heaven hastened forth, unveiled, and resplendent,
from Her mystic mansion, and asked of their names, and all were told but one. And when urged,
the first Letter thereof was uttered, whereupon the dwellers of the celestial chambers rushed forth
out of their habitation of glory. And whilst the second letter was pronounced they fell down, one
and all, upon the dust. At that moment a Voice was heard from the inmost shrine: 'Thus far and
no farther.' Verily we bear witness to that which they have done and now are doing."

"The Revelation of which I am the bearer," Bahá'u'lláh explicitly declares, "is adapted to
humanity's spiritual receptiveness and capacity; otherwise, the Light that shines within me can
neither wax nor wane. Whatever I manifest is nothing more or less than the measure of the
Divine glory which God has bidden me reveal."

If the Light that is now streaming forth upon an increasingly responsive
humanity with a radiance that bids fair to eclipse the splendor of such triumphs as
the forces of religion have achieved in days past; if the signs and tokens which
proclaimed its advent have been, in many respects, unique in the annals of past
Revelations; if its votaries have evinced traits and qualities unexampled in the spiritual history
of mankind; these should be attributed not to a superior merit which the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh, as a
Revelation isolated and alien from any previous Dispensation, might possess, but rather should
be viewed and explained as the inevitable outcome of the forces that have made of
this present age an age infinitely more advanced, more receptive, and more
insistent to receive an ampler measure of Divine Guidance than has hitherto been
vouchsafed to mankind. (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Bahá’u’llah, pp. 57-60)

Shoghi Effendi takes this one step further, asserting that Bahá’u’llah represents the culmination of this process of
progressive revelation:

The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, whose supreme mission is none other but the achievement of this
organic and spiritual unity of the whole body of nations, should, if we be faithful to its
implications, be regarded as signalizing through its advent the coming of age of the entire human
race. It should be viewed not merely as yet another spiritual revival in the ever-changing fortunes
of mankind, not only as a further stage in a chain of progressive Revelations, nor even as
the culmination of one of a series of recurrent prophetic cycles, but rather as marking the last and
highest stage in the stupendous evolution of man's collective life on this planet. The emergence of
a world community, the consciousness of world citizenship, the founding of a world civilization
and culture -- all of which must synchronize with the initial stages in the unfoldment of the
Golden Age of the Bahá'í Era -- should, by their very nature, be regarded, as far as this planetary
life is concerned, as the furthermost limits in the organization of human society, though man, as
an individual, will, nay must indeed as a result of such a consummation, continue indefinitely to
progress and develop. (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Bahá’u’llah, p. 163)

Shoghi Effendi also depicts progressive revelation as extending into the Bahá’í cycle, beyond the Bahá’í
Dispensation:

The fundamental principle enunciated by Bahá'u'lláh ... is that religious truth is not absolute but
relative, that Divine Revelation is a continuous and progressive process, that all the
great religions of the world are divine in origin, that their basic principles are in complete
harmony, that their aims and purposes are one and the same, that their teachings are but facets
of one truth, that their functions are complementary, that they differ only in the nonessential
aspects of their doctrines, and that their missions represent successive stages in the
spiritual evolution of human society....

...His mission is to proclaim that the ages of the infancy and of the childhood of the
human race are past, that the convulsions associated with the present stage of its adolescence are
slowly and painfully preparing it to attain the stage of manhood, and are heralding the approach
of that Age of Ages when swords will be beaten into plowshares, when the Kingdom promised by
Jesus Christ will have been established, and the peace of the planet definitely and permanently
ensured. Nor does Bahá'u'lláh claim finality for His own Revelation, but rather
stipulates that a fuller measure of the truth He has been commissioned by the
Almighty to vouchsafe to humanity, at so critical a juncture in its fortunes, must
needs be disclosed at future stages in the constant and limitless evolution of
mankind. (Shoghi Effendi, Preface, The Promised Day is Come)

The fundamental principle enunciated by Bahá'u'lláh, the followers of His Faith firmly believe, is
that Religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is a continuous and

progressive process, that all the great religions of the world are divine in origin, that their
basic principles are in complete harmony, that their aims and purposes are one and the same,
that their teachings are but facets of one truth, that their functions are complementary, that they
differ only in the non-essential aspects of their doctrines and that their missions represent
successive stages in the spiritual evolution of human society.

The aim of Bahá'u'lláh, the Prophet of this new and great age which humanity has
entered upon -- He whose advent fulfils the prophecies of the Old and New Testaments as well as
those of the Qur'án regarding the coming of the Promised One in the end of time, on the Day of
Judgment -- is not to destroy but to fulfill the Revelations of the past, to reconcile rather than
accentuate the divergences of the conflicting creeds which disrupt present-day society.

His purpose, far from belittling the station of the Prophets gone before Him or of
whittling down their teachings, is to restate the basic truths which these teachings enshrine in a
manner that would conform to the needs, and be in consonance with the capacity, and be
applicable to the problems, the ills and perplexities, of the age in which we live. His mission is to
proclaim that the ages of the infancy and of the childhood of the human race are past, that the
convulsions associated with the present stage of its adolescence are slowly and painfully preparing
it to attain the stage of manhood, and are heralding the approach of that Age of Ages when
swords will be beaten into plowshares, when the Kingdom promised by Jesus Christ will have
been established, and the peace of the planet definitely and permanently ensured. Nor does
Bahá'u'lláh claim finality for His own Revelation, but rather stipulates that a
fuller measure of the truth He has been commissioned by the Almighty to
vouchsafe to humanity, at so critical a juncture in its fortunes, must needs be
disclosed at future stages in the constant and limitless evolution of mankind.
(Shoghi Effendi, Summary Statement - 1947, Special UN Committee on Palestine)

Lastly the Holy Seed of infinite preciousness, holding within itself incalculable potentialities
representing the culmination of the centuries-old process of the evolution of
humanity through the energies released by the series of progressive Revelations
starting with Adam and concluded by the Revelation of the Seal of the Prophets,
marked by the successive appearance of the branches, leaves, buds, blossoms and plucked, after
six brief years by the hand of destiny, ground in the mill of martyrdom and oppression but
yielding the oil whose first flickering light cast upon the somber, subterranean walls of the Siyah-
Chal of Tihran, whose fire gathered brilliance in Baghdad and shone in full resplendency in its
crystal globe in Adrianople, whose rays warmed and illuminated the fringes of the American,
European, Australian continents through the tender ministerings of the Center of the Covenant,
whose radiance is now overspreading the surface of the globe during the present Formative Age,

whose full splendor is destined in the course of future milleniums to suffuse the entire planet.
(Shoghi Effendi, Citadel of Faith, p. 82)

So vast, so momentous and challenging a crusade [Ten Year Crusade, 1953-1963] that will, God
willing, illuminate the annals of the second epoch of the Formative Age of the Faith of
Bahá'u'lláh, and immortalize the second decade of the second Bahá'í century, and the
termination of which will mark the closing of the first epoch in the evolution of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's
Divine Plan, will, in itself, pave the way for, and constitute the prelude to, the initiation of the
laborious and tremendously long process of establishing in the course of subsequent crusades in
all the newly opened sovereign states, dependencies and islands of the planet, as well as in all the
remaining territories of the globe, the framework of the Administrative Order of the Faith, with
all its attendant agencies, and of eventually erecting in these territories still more pillars to share
in sustaining the weight and in broadening the foundation of the Universal House of Justice.

Then, and only then, will the vast, the majestic process, set in motion at the
dawn of the Adamic cycle, attain its consummation -- a process which commenced
six thousand years ago, with the planting, in the soil of the divine will, of the tree
of divine revelation, and which has already passed through certain stages and
must needs pass through still others ere it attains its final consummation. The
first part of this process was the slow and steady growth of this tree of divine
revelation, successively putting forth its branches, shoots and offshoots, and
revealing its leaves, buds and blossoms, as a direct consequence of the light and
warmth imparted to it by a series of progressive dispensations associated with
Moses, Zoroaster, Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad and other Prophets, and of the
vernal showers of blood shed by countless martyrs in their path. The second part of
this process was the fruition of this tree, "that belongeth neither to the East nor to the West,"
when the Báb appeared as the perfect fruit and declared His mission in the Year Sixty in the city
of Shiraz. The third part was the grinding of this sacred seed, of infinite preciousness and
potency, in the mill of adversity, causing it to yield its oil, six years later, in the city of Tabriz.
The fourth part was the ignition of this oil by the hand of Providence in the depths and amidst
the darkness of the Siyah-Chal of Tihran a hundred years ago. The fifth, was the clothing of that
flickering light, which had scarcely penetrated the adjoining territory of Iraq, in the lamp of
revelation, after an eclipse lasting no less than ten years, in the city of Baghdad. The sixth, was
the spread of the radiance of that light, shining with added brilliancy in its crystal globe in
Adrianople, and later on in the fortress town of 'Akká, to thirteen countries in the Asiatic and
African continents. The seventh was its projection, from the Most Great Prison, in the course of
the ministry of the Center of the Covenant, across the seas and the shedding of its illumination
upon twenty sovereign states and dependencies in the American, the European, and Australian

continents. The eighth part of that process was the diffusion of that same light in the course of the
first, and the opening years of the second, epoch of the Formative Age of the Faith, over ninety-
four sovereign states, dependencies and islands of the planet, as a result of the prosecution of a
series of national plans, initiated by eleven national spiritual assemblies throughout the Bahá'í
world, utilizing the agencies of a newly emerged, divinely appointed Administrative Order, and
which has now culminated in the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of Bahá'u'lláh's Mission.
The ninth part of this process -- the stage we are now entering -- is the further diffusion of that
same light over one hundred and thirty-one additional territories and islands in both the Eastern
and Western Hemispheres, through the operation of a decade-long world spiritual crusade whose
termination will, God willing, coincide with the Most Great Jubilee commemorating the
centenary of the declaration of Bahá'u'lláh in Baghdad. And finally the tenth part of this mighty
process must be the penetration of that light, in the course of numerous crusades and of
successive epochs of both the Formative and Golden Ages of the Faith, into all the remaining
territories of the globe through the erection of the entire machinery of Bahá'u'lláh's
Administrative Order in all territories, both East and West, the stage at which the light of God's
triumphant Faith shining in all its power and glory will have suffused and enveloped the entire
planet. (Shoghi Effendi, Messages to the Bahá’í World - 1950-1957, pp. 153-155)

Bahá’u’llah and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá have set forth this principle of progressive revelation in clear and unequivocal
language. Some of the passages upon which Shoghi Effendi must have based his formulation of Bahá’í doctrine in
the foregoing excerpts are cited below:

Contemplate with thine inward eye the chain of successive Revelations that hath linked
the Manifestation of Adam with that of the Báb. I testify before God that each one of
these Manifestations hath been sent down through the operation of the Divine Will and Purpose,
that each hath been the bearer of a specific Message, that each hath been entrusted with a
divinely-revealed Book and been commissioned to unravel the mysteries of a mighty Tablet. The
measure of the Revelation with which every one of them hath been identified had been definitely
fore-ordained. This, verily, is a token of Our favor unto them, if ye be of those that comprehend
this truth...And when this process of progressive Revelation culminated in the stage
at which His peerless, His most sacred, and exalted Countenance was to be
unveiled to men's eyes, He chose to hide His own Self behind a thousand veils, lest
profane and mortal eyes discover His glory. This He did at a time when the signs and
tokens of a divinely-appointed Revelation were being showered upon Him -- signs and tokens
which none can reckon except the Lord, your God, the Lord of all worlds. And when the set time
of concealment was fulfilled, We sent forth, whilst still wrapt within a myriad veils, an
infinitesimal glimmer of the effulgent Glory enveloping the Face of the Youth, and lo, the entire
company of the dwellers of the Realms above were seized with violent commotion and the

favored of God fell down in adoration before Him. He hath, verily, manifested a glory such as
none in the whole creation hath witnessed, inasmuch as He hath arisen to proclaim in person His
Cause unto all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth. (Bahá'u'llah, Gleanings from the
Writings of Bahá’u’llah, XXXI, pp. 74-75)

And now regarding thy question, "How is it that no records are to be found concerning the
Prophets that have preceded Adam, the Father of Mankind, or of the kings that lived in the days
of those Prophets?" Know thou that the absence of any reference to them is no proof that they
did not actually exist. That no records concerning them are now available, should be attributed
to their extreme remoteness, as well as to the vast changes which the earth hath undergone since
their time…

Mention hath been made in certain books of a deluge which caused all that existed on
earth, historical records as well as other things, to be destroyed. Moreover, many cataclysms have
occurred which have effaced the traces of many events. Furthermore, among existing historical
records differences are to be found, and each of the various peoples of the world hath its own
account of the age of the earth and of its history. Some trace their history as far back as eight
thousand years, others as far as twelve thousand years. To any one that hath read the book of Juk
it is clear and evident how much the accounts given by the various books have differed. Please
God thou wilt turn thine eyes towards the Most Great Revelation, and entirely
disregard these conflicting tales and traditions. (Bahá'u'llah, Gleanings from the Writings of
Bahá’u’llah, LXXXVII, p. 172, pp. 174-175)

Heard it ye ever reported by your fathers of old, or by the generations that preceded them, even
unto the first Adam, that any one coming in the clouds of revelation, being invested with
manifest and transcendent sovereignty, having on his right hand the Kingdom of God and on his
left all the power and glory of His everlasting dominion, any one preceded by the hosts of God,
the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Most Powerful, and uttering continually verses whose
import the minds of the most learned and wisest of men are powerless to fathom, should yet be
the bearer of a message that is not of God? Be discerning, then, and speak ye the truth, the very
truth, if ye claim to be honest and high-minded. (Bahá'u'llah, Gleanings from the Writings of
Bahá’u’llah, CXXI, pp. 258-259)

In the days of Moses it was the Pentateuch; in the days of Jesus the Gospel; in the days of
Muhammad the Messenger of God the Qur'án; in this day the Bayan; and in the dispensation of
Him Whom God [Bahá’u’llah] will make manifest His own Book -- the Book unto which all the
Books of former Dispensations must needs be referred, the Book which standeth amongst them
all transcendent and supreme. (Bahá'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, pp. 199-200)

Bahá’u’llah refers to the Báb and His Revelation in comparison with previous Dispensations:

No understanding can grasp the nature of His Revelation, nor can any knowledge comprehend
the full measure of His Faith. All sayings are dependent upon His sanction, and all things stand in
need of His Cause. All else save Him are created by His command, and move and have their
being through His law. He is the Revealer of the divine mysteries, and the Expounder of the
hidden and ancient wisdom. Thus it is related in the "Biharu'l-Anvar," the "Avalim," and the
"Yanbu'" of Sadiq, son of Muhammad, that he spoke these words: "Knowledge is twenty and
seven letters. All that the Prophets have revealed are two letters thereof. No man thus far hath
known more than these two letters. But when the Qá'im shall arise, He will cause the remaining
twenty and five letters to be made manifest." Consider; He hath declared Knowledge to consist
of twenty and seven letters, and regarded all the Prophets, from Adam even unto the "Seal," as
Expounders of only two letters thereof and of having been sent down with these two letters. He
also saith that the Qá'im will reveal all the remaining twenty and five letters. Behold from this
utterance how great and lofty is His station! His rank excelleth that of all the Prophets, and His
Revelation transcendeth the comprehension and understanding of all their chosen ones. A
Revelation, of which the Prophets of God, His saints and chosen ones, have either not been
informed, or which, in pursuance of God's inscrutable Decree, they have not disclosed, -- such a
Revelation these mean and depraved people have sought to measure with their own deficient
minds, their own deficient learning and understanding. Should it fail to conform to their
standards, they straightway reject it. "Thinkest thou that the greater part of them hear or
understand? They are even like unto the brutes! yea, they stray even further from the
path!"[Qur'án 25:44] (Bahá'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, pp. 243-244)

Thus it is recorded: "Every knowledge hath seventy meanings, of which one only is known
amongst the people. And when the Qá'im shall arise, He shall reveal unto men all that which
remaineth." (Bahá'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 255)

Bahá’u’llah cites some passages from the Báb’s Writings that indicate that His successor reveals yet a greater share
of the truth than Himself:

In like manner, the Primal Point saith: "Behold ye Him with His own eyes. Were ye to behold
Him with the eyes of another, ye would never recognize and know Him." This referreth to
naught else except this Most Great Revelation. Well is it with them that judge fairly. And
likewise, He saith: "The year-old germ that holdeth within itself the potentialities of the
Revelation that is to come is endowed with a potency superior to the combined forces of the
whole of the Bayan." These glad-tidings of the Bayan and of the Books of former times have been
repeatedly mentioned under divers names in numerous books, that perchance men might judge

equitably that which hath arisen and shone forth above the horizon of the will of God, the Lord
of the Mighty Throne.

O Shaykh! Tell the people of the Bayan: "Ponder ye these blessed words. He saith: 'The
whole of the Bayan is only a leaf amongst the leaves of His Paradise.' Be fair, O people, and be
not of such as are accounted as lost in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds." The blessed
Lote-Tree standeth, in this day, before thy face, laden with heavenly, with new and wondrous
fruits. Gaze on it, detached from all else save it. Thus hath the Tongue of might and power
spoken at this Spot which God hath adorned with the footsteps of His Most Great Name and
Mighty Announcement.

And likewise, He saith: "Ere nine will have elapsed from the inception of this Cause, the
realities of the created things will not be made manifest. All that thou hast as yet seen is but the
stage from the moist germ until We clothed it with flesh. Be patient, until thou beholdest a new
creation. Say: 'Blessed, therefore, be God, the most excellent of Makers!'" And likewise, He hath
said regarding the power of this Revelation: "Lawful is it for Him Whom God will make manifest
to reject him who is greatest on earth, inasmuch as such a one is but a creature in His grasp, and
all things adore Him. After Hin (68) a Cause shall be given unto you which ye shall come to
know." And also He saith: "Know thou with absolute certainty, and through the firmly
established and most irrevocable decree, that He -- exalted be His glory, and magnified be His
might, and sanctified be His holiness, and glorified be His grandeur, and lauded be His ways,
maketh each thing to be known through its own self; who then can know Him through any one
except Himself?" And further, He saith -- exalted and glorified be He: "Beware, beware lest, in
the days of His Revelation, the Vahid of the Bayan (eighteen Letters of the Living) shut thee not
out as by a veil from Him, inasmuch as this Vahid is but a creature in His sight. And beware,
beware that the words sent down in the Bayan shut thee not out as by a veil from Him." And
again, He -- exalted be He -- saith: "Look not upon Him with any eye except His own. For
whosoever looketh upon Him with His eye, will recognize Him; otherwise he will be veiled from
Him. Shouldst thou seek God and His Presence, seek thou Him and gaze upon Him." And
likewise, He saith: "Better is it for thee to recite but one of the verses of Him Whom God shall
make manifest than to set down the whole of the Bayan, for on that Day that one verse can save
thee, whereas the entire Bayan cannot save thee."

Say: O people of the Bayan! Be fair, be fair; and again, be fair, be fair. Be ye not of them
who have made mention of the Manifestation of the Cause of God in the daytime and in the
night season, and who, when He, through His grace, appeared, and when the Horizon of
Revelation was illumined, pronounced against Him such a judgment as hath provoked the

lamentations of the inmates of the Kingdom and of the Realm of Glory, and of such as have
circled about the will of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Meditate upon these sublime words. He saith: "I, verily, am a believer in Him, and in His
Faith, and in His Book, and in His Testimonies, and in His Ways, and in all that proceedeth
from Him concerning them. I glory in My kinship with Him, and pride Myself on My belief in
Him." And likewise, He saith: "O congregation of the Bayan and all who are therein! Recognize
ye the limits imposed upon you, for such a One as the Point of the Bayan Himself hath believed
in Him Whom God shall make manifest, before all things were created. Therein, verily, do I
glory before all who are in the kingdom of heaven and earth." By God! All the atoms of the
universe groan and lament at the cruelty perpetrated by the froward among the people of the
Bayan. Whither are gone they who are endued with insight and hearing? We beseech God --
blessed and glorified be He -- to summon them and exhort them unto that which will profit
them, and withhold them from that which will harm them. He, in truth, is the Strong, the All-
Subduing, the Almighty.

And likewise, He saith: "Suffer not yourselves to be shut out as by a veil from God after
He hath revealed Himself. For all that hath been exalted in the Bayan is but as a ring upon My
hand, and I Myself am, verily, but a ring upon the hand of Him Whom God shall make manifest
-- glorified be His mention! He turneth it as He pleaseth, for whatsoever He pleaseth, and
through whatsoever He pleaseth. He, verily, is the Help in Peril, the Most High." And likewise,
He saith: "Were He to make of every one on earth a Prophet, all would, in very truth, be
accounted as Prophets in the sight of God." And likewise, He saith: "In the day of the revelation
of Him Whom God shall make manifest all that dwell on earth will be equal in His estimation.
Whomsoever He ordaineth as a Prophet, he, verily, hath been a Prophet from the beginning that
hath no beginning, and will thus remain until the end that hath no end, inasmuch as this is an act
of God. And whosoever is made a Vicegerent by Him, shall be a Vicegerent in all the worlds, for
this is an act of God. For the will of God can in no wise be revealed except through His will, nor
His wish be manifested save through His wish. He, verily, is the All-Conquering, the All-
Powerful, the All-Highest." (Bahá'u'llah, Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, pp. 151-155)

Bahá’u’llah also indicates that He has summarized the teachings that have been revealed by all the previous
Prophets:

This is that which hath descended from the realm of glory, uttered by the tongue of power and
might, and revealed unto the Prophets of old. We have taken the inner essence thereof and
clothed it in the garment of brevity, as a token of grace unto the righteous, that they may stand

faithful unto the Covenant of God, may fulfill in their lives His trust, and in the realm of spirit
obtain the gem of Divine virtue. (Bahá'u'llah, Prelude, The Arabic Hidden Words)

Finally, Bahá’u’llah affirms that all things, including all religious teachings are to be weighed in the divine balance
revealed in His Book:

Say: O leaders of religion! Weigh not the Book of God with such standards and sciences as are
current amongst you, for the Book itself is the unerring Balance established amongst men. In this
most perfect Balance whatsoever the peoples and kindreds of the earth possess must be weighed,
while the measure of its weight should be tested according to its own standard, did ye but know
it. (Bahá'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Aqdas, K99, p. 56)

Say: This is the infallible Balance which the Hand of God is holding, in which all who are in the
heavens and all who are on the earth are weighed, and their fate determined, if ye be of them
that believe and recognize this truth. Say: This is the Most Great Testimony, by which the
validity of every proof throughout the ages hath been established, would that ye might be assured
thereof. Say: Through it the poor have been enriched, the learned enlightened, and the seekers
enabled to ascend unto the presence of God. Beware lest ye make it a cause of dissension
amongst you. Be ye as firmly

settled as the immovable mountain in the Cause of your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving.
(Bahá'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Aqdas, K183, p. 85)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá has confirmed the truth of this principle, and here are a few of the references to it:

Creation is the expression of motion. Motion is life. A moving object is a living object, whereas
that which is motionless and inert is as dead. All created forms are progressive in their planes, or
kingdoms of existence, under the stimulus of the power or spirit of life. The universal energy is
dynamic. Nothing is stationary in the material world of outer phenomena or in the inner world of
intellect and consciousness.

Religion is the outer expression of the divine reality. Therefore, it must be living, vitalized,
moving and progressive. If it be without motion and nonprogressive, it is without the divine life;
it is dead. The divine institutes are continuously active and evolutionary; therefore,
the revelation of them must be progressive and continuous. (‘Abdu'l-Bahá, The
Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 140)

Among the bounties of God is revelation. Hence revelation is progressive and
continuous. It never ceases. It is necessary that the reality of Divinity with all its perfections and
attributes should become resplendent in the human world. The reality of Divinity is like an
endless ocean. Revelation may be likened to the rain. Can you imagine the cessation of rain?
Ever on the face of the earth somewhere rain is pouring down. Briefly, the world of existence is
progressive. It is subject to development and growth. Consider how great has been the progress
in this radiant century. Civilization has unfolded. Nations have developed. Industrialism and
jurisprudence have expanded. Sciences, inventions and discoveries have increased. All of these
show that the world of existence is continuously progressing and developing; and therefore,
assuredly, the virtues characterizing the maturity of man must, likewise, expand and grow.
(‘Abdu'l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 378)

In brief, the Scripture saith: 'And he that talked with me had a rod [reed] made out of gold, that
is, a measure, wherewith he measured the city and the gates thereof and the towers thereof.'
[Apocalypse 21:15] The meaning is that certain personages guided the people with a staff grown
out of the earth, and shepherded them with a rod, like unto the rod of Moses. Others trained and
shepherded the people with a rod of iron, as in the dispensation of Muhammad. And in this
present cycle, because it is the mightiest of Dispensations, that rod grown out of the vegetable
kingdom and that rod of iron will be transformed into a rod of purest gold, taken from out the
endless treasure houses in the Kingdom of the Lord. By this rod will the people be trained.

Note well the difference: at one time the Teachings of God were as a staff, and by this
means the Holy Scriptures were spread abroad, the Law of God was promulgated and His Faith
established. Then followed a time when the staff of the true Shepherd was as iron. And today, in
this new and splendid age, the rod is even as pure gold. How wide is the difference here! Know,
then, how much ground hath been gained by the Law of God and His Teachings in this
dispensation, how they have reached such heights that they far transcend the dispensations gone
before: truly this rod is purest gold, while those of other days were of iron and wood. (Selections
from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, pp. 166-167)

CANONIZATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT

THE ENVIRONMENT OF CANONIZATION

In one of his letters, Shoghi Effendi described the historical environment in which the New Testament came into
existence. He began by comparing the situation of Christendom in his own time (circa 1935) with the “opening
centuries of the Christian Era”:

So marked a decline in the strength and cohesion of the elements constituting Christian society
has led, in its turn, as we might well anticipate, to the emergence of an increasing number of
obscure cults, of strange and new worships, of ineffective philosophies, whose sophisticated
doctrines have intensified the confusion of a troubled age. In their tenets and pursuits they may
be said to reflect and bear witness to the revolt, the discontent, and the confused aspirations of
the disillusioned masses that have deserted the cause of the Christian churches and seceded from
their membership.

A parallel might almost be drawn between these confused and confusing systems of
thought that are the direct outcome of the helplessness and confusion afflicting the Christian
Faith and the great variety of popular cults, of fashionable and evasive philosophies which
flourished in the opening centuries of the Christian Era, and which attempted to absorb and
pervert the state religion of that Roman people. The pagan worshipers who constituted, at that
time, the bulk of the population of the Western Roman Empire, found themselves surrounded,
and in certain instances menaced, by the prevailing sect of the Neo-Platonists, by the followers of
nature religions, by Gnostic philosophers, by Philonism, Mithraism, the adherents of the
Alexandrian cult, and a multitude of kindred sects and beliefs, in much the same way as the
defenders of the Christian Faith, the preponderating religion of the western world, are realizing,
in the first century of the Bahá'í Era, how their influence is being undermined by a flood of
conflicting beliefs, practices and tendencies which their own bankruptcy had helped to create. It
was, however, this same Christian Religion, which has now fallen into such a state of impotence,
that eventually proved itself capable of sweeping away the institutions of paganism and of
swamping and suppressing the cults that had flourished in that age.4

We will now examine the religious groups named by Shoghi Effendi in this passage, as a guide to what Christianity
was not:

4Shoghi   Effendi, The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, pp. 184-185.

NEO-PLATONISM

Platonism and Neo-Platonism are described in a Wikipedia article5:

Platonism was originally expressed in the dialogues of Plato, in which the figure of Socrates is
used to expound certain doctrines, that may or may not be similar to the thought of the historical
Socrates, Plato's master. Plato delivered his lectures at the Academy, a precinct containing a
sacred grove outside the walls of Athens. The school continued there long after…

In the 3rd century, Plotinus recast Plato's system, establishing Neoplatonism, in which
Middle Platonism was fused with oriental mysticism. At the summit of existence stands the One
or the Good, as the source of all things. It generates from itself, as if from the reflection of its own
being, reason, the nous, - wherein is contained the infinite store of ideas. The world-soul, the
copy of the nous, is generated by and contained in it, as the nous is in the One, and, by informing
matter in itself nonexistent, constitutes bodies whose existence is contained in the world-soul.
Nature therefore is a whole, endowed with life and soul. Soul, being chained to matter, longs to
escape from the bondage of the body and return to its original source. In virtue and philosophical
thought it has the power to elevate itself above the reason into a state of ecstasy, where it can
behold, or ascend up to, that one good primary Being whom reason cannot know. To attain this
union with the Good, or God, is the true function of human beings.

Plotinus' disciple, Porphyry, followed by Iamblichus, developed the system in conscious
opposition to Christianity. The Platonic Academy was re-established during this period; its most
renowned head was Proclus (died 485), a celebrated commentator on Plato's writings. The
Academy persisted until Roman emperor Justinian closed it in 529…Many Western churchmen,
including Augustine of Hippo, have been influenced by Platonism…Platonism influenced
Christianity first through Clement of Alexandria and Origen.[2] Augustine was heavily influenced
by Platonism as well, mostly through Victorinus Afer.[2] Platonism was considered authoritative
in the Middle Ages, and many Platonic notions are now permanent elements of
Catholic/Protestant Christianity.[2] Like pagans had before them, Christians understood Platonic
forms as God's thoughts.[2] Platonism also influenced both Eastern and Western mysticism.[2]
Meanwhile, Platonism influenced various philosophers.[2] When Aristotle became more
renowned than Plato in the 13th century, Aquinas's philosophy was still fundamentally
Platonic.[2]

5http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism

Bahá’ís will be interested to know that Neo-Platonism was revived and amplified by Muslim philosophers, as
described in this article6:

Islamic Neoplatonism developed in a milieu already saturated with the thought of Plotinus and
Aristotle. The former studied in Alexandria, and the Alexandrine philosophical syllabus included
such figures as Porphyry of Tyre and Proclus. Associated with these scholars were two major
channels of Islamic Neoplatonism, the so-called Theology of Aristotle and the Liber de Causis
(Book of Causes). Other cities beloved of the philosophers at the time of the rise of Islam in the
first century ah (seventh century ad) included Gondeshapur and Harran.

Islamic Neoplatonism stressed one aspect of the Qur'anic God, the transcendent, and
ignored another, the creative. For the Neoplatonists, all things emanated from the deity. Islamic
philosophers were imbued to a greater or lesser degree with either Aristotelianism or
Neoplatonism or, as was often the case, with both. Al-Kindi, the father of Islamic philosophy, has
a Neoplatonic aspect, but the doctrine reaches its intellectual fruition in the complex
emanationist hierarchies developed by al-Farabi and Ibn Sina. Their views are later developed
(or metamorphosed) by later thinkers into an emanative hierarchy of lights, as with Shihab al-Din
al-Suhrawardi, or the doctrine of the Unity of Being espoused by Ibn al-'Arabi. While al-Ghazali
and Ibn Rushd both vigorously opposed Neoplatonic views, the latter attacked the former for his
general opposition to the philosophers.

Neoplatonism itself had a major impact on that sectarian grouping of Muslims known as
the Isma'ilis, and became the substratum for its theology. Historically, Neoplatonism in Islam
achieved its climax with the Fatimid Isma'ili conquest of Egypt towards the end of the fourth
century ah (tenth century ad). While Neoplatonism later declined in philosophical importance in
the face of rampant Aristotelianism and Hanbalism, it may be said to have bequeathed an
important religious, historical and cultural legacy to the Islamic world, which in the Isma'ili
movement endures to this day.

NATURE RELIGIONS

The nature religions referred to by Shoghi Effendi were no doubt the worshippers of Cybele and of Venus, the Great
Mother (Magna Mater) with ties to Aphrodite, Ishtar (Astarte), and Isis. The specific cult of Cybele is described7:

The most famous rite of Magna Mater introduced by the Romans was the taurobolium, the
initiation ceremony in which a candidate took their place in a pit beneath a wooden floor. A bull

\[6\] http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H003.htm
7http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybele

was sacrificed on the wooden floor so that the blood would run through gaps in the slats and
drench the initiate in a symbolic shower of blood. This act was thought to cleanse an initiate of
sin as well as signify a 'rebirth' and re-energisation. A cheaper version, known as a criobolium,
involved the sacrifice of a ram. The first recorded taurobolium took place at Puteoli in AD 134 in
honour of Venus Caelestia.[9]

In Roman mythology, Cybele was given the name Magna Mater deorum Idaea ("great
Idaean mother of the gods"), in recognition of her Phrygian origins (although this title was given
to Rhea also). Roman devotion to Cybele ran deeply. Not coincidentally, when a Christian
basilica was built over the site of a temple to Cybele to occupy the site, the sanctuary was
rededicated to the Mother of God, as the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. However, later,
Roman citizens were forbidden to become priests of Cybele, who were eunuchs like those of their
Asiatic Goddess.

GNOSTIC PHILOSOPHY

While the origins of Gnostic philosophy are traced to an earlier epoch than that which immediately followed the life
and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, the impact of Gnosticism was far reaching and spanned several centuries8:

A collective name for a large number of greatly-varying and pantheistic-idealistic sects, which
flourished from some time before the Christian Era down to the fifth century, and which, while
borrowing the phraseology and some of the tenets of the chief religions of the day, and especially
of Christianity, held matter to be a deterioration of spirit, and the whole universe a depravation
of the Deity, and taught the ultimate end of all being to be the overcoming of the grossness of
matter and the return to the Parent-Spirit, which return they held to be inaugurated and
facilitated by the appearance of some God-sent Saviour… When Gnosticism came in touch with
Christianity, which must have happened almost immediately on its appearance, Gnosticism
threw herself with strange rapidity into Christian forms of thought, borrowed its nomenclature,
acknowledged Jesus as Saviour of the world, simulated its sacraments, pretended to be an esoteric
revelation of Christ and His Apostles, flooded the world with apocryphal Gospels, and Acts, and
Apocalypses, to substantiate its claim. As Christianity grew within and without the Roman
Empire, Gnosticism spread as a fungus at its root, and claimed to be the only true form of
Christianity, unfit, indeed, for the vulgar crowd, but set apart for the gifted and the elect. So rank
was its poisonous growth that there seemed danger of its stifling Christianity altogether, and the
earliest Fathers devoted their energies to uprooting it. Though in reality the spirit of Gnosticism
is utterly alien to that of Christianity, it then seemed to the unwary merely a modification or
refinement thereof. When domiciled on Greek soil, Gnosticism, slightly changing its barbarous
and Seminitic terminology and giving its "emanatons" and "syzygies" Greek names, sounded
8http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06592a.htm

somewhat like neo-Platonism, thought it was strongly repudiated by Plotinus. In Egypt the
national worship left its mark more on Gnostic practice than on its theories…In dealing with the
origins of Gnosticism, one might be tempted to mention Manichaeism, as a number of Gnostic
ideas seem to be borrowed from Manichaeism, where they are obviously at home. This, however,
would hardly be correct. Manichaeism, as historically connected with Mani, its founder, could
not have arisen much earlier than A.D. 250, when Gnosticism was already in rapid decline.

PHILONISM

Shoghi Effendi refers here to those who adopted the views of Philo Judaeus of Alexandrai (20 BCE-50 CE)9:

Philo (20 BC - 50 AD), known also as Philo of Alexandria (gr. Φίλων ὁ Ἀλεξανδρεύς), Philo
Judaeus, Philo Judaeus of Alexandria, Yedidia and Philo the Jew, was a Hellenistic Jewish
philosopher born in Alexandria, Egypt.

Philo used allegory to fuse and harmonize Greek philosophy and Judaism. His method followed
the practices of both Jewish exegesis and Stoic philosophy. His work was not widely accepted.
"The sophists of literalness," as he calls them[1], "opened their eyes superciliously" when he
explained to them the marvels of his exegesis. Philo's works were enthusiastically received by the
early Christians, some of whom saw in him a cryptic Christian. His concept of the Logos as
God's creative principle apparently influenced early Christology. To him Logos was God's
"blueprint for the world", a governing plan.

David T. Runia has closely studied the influence of Philonism on Christian theology…and his argument is found
here10:

What impact, then, did Philo have on the beginnings of Christian thought? I propose to give no
less than four answers to this question. As we shall see, all four are relevant, but we may in the
end conclude that some are more relevant than others. It goes without saying that these answers
can now only be formulated and discussed in the most general terms.

(1) Firstly, at the end of his most well-known work, De opificio mundi, Philo names five
dogmata (doctrines), knowledge of which is a guarantee for a pious and felicitous life: that God
exists, that He is One, that he created the cosmos, that this cosmos is unique just like its Maker,
and that He always exercises providence on what he has made. The great Philonist E. R.
Goodenough once called this passage `the first creed of history',[7] and recently Alan Mendelson
has ventured to speak of a `concept of orthodoxy' that in Philo's view was essential for the

9http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo
10http://www.torreys.org/bible/philo&beg.html

preservation of Jewish identity.[8] Might it not be legitimate to see Philo as the origin of a
dogmatism that was to distinguish Christianity from subsequent (Rabbinic) Judaism and also
from pagan thought? In my view a distinction needs to be made. Philo is not a dogmatician in
the manner of an Athanasius or a Basil, or even of an Origen. He does not regard himself as
subjected to something like an ecclesiastical tradition, a regula fidei which he has to defend with
all the intellectual resources at his disposal. Philo's view of himself is rather different. He sees
himself as standing in the tradition of interpretation and exposition of the Mosaic philosophy, a
tradition in which he claims for himself no more than a modest role. But there can be no doubt
that he does have a strong tendency towards an intellectual re-interpretation of his religious
heritage. In a most intriguing passage Philo interprets the expulsion of certain classes of people
from the congregation of Israel in Deuteronomy 23 in terms of directions of thought (Spec.
1\.327-345). His model, clearly, is Plato, who in the Laws is prepared to take draconian measures
against errors of thought (book X, esp. 885b). The praxis of being Jewish is important for Philo
and most definitely not to be neglected, but it is less important than the theoria. Philo takes an
initial step along the path that would lead to the construction of the mighty edifice of Christian
dogma.

(2) For a second answer we take our cue from Photius, the learned ninth-century
Patriarch of Constantinople. Photius tells us in his Bibliotheca that he read various Philonic
treatises, very many of which contained interpretations that forced scripture into an allegorical
mode. Starting from this man, he continues, the entire allegorical method of reading scripture
began to pour into the church (§105). This observation is essentially correct, and even more so if
we take into account the wider background of Hellenistic Judaism. The writings of Philo furnish
the church fathers with numerous allegorical themes and schemes in the area of cosmological,
psychological and moral exposition. Augustine too, as we saw, recognizes Philo's use of the
allegorical method and is prepared to accept some of its results, until he finds a fatal flaw in the
way Philo puts the method to use. We might even wish to broaden our approach here and
include all the exegetical themes that Philo bequeathed to the church fathers, for it should not be
thought that Philo furnishes only allegorical material. Naturally there is a heavy concentration of
material focused on the books of Moses, because that is effectively where the Bible begins and
ends for Philo, but in many cases the significance of the method goes far beyond its specific
contents.

Photius is very negative in his evaluation of this Philonic influence, and since the
Reformation reservations towards the allegorical method have only increased. But we should be
careful not to overlook its attractive aspects. These are primarily two in number. The first is only

too well known: it allows the interpreter to connect up with and exploit significant philosophical
and what we now would call spiritual ideas. The second is more subtle: it also allows the
interpreter to preserve at least partly the narrative element of the biblical text, but then at the
more general level of the quest of the soul for God.

(3) A third insight draws us closer to the epicentre of our question. We observe that Philo
(together with others before and after him) has taken the crucial step of selecting the Platonic
paradigm of being and becoming, immutability and change, knowledge and ignorance as the
system of thought most suitable for the task of expounding and interpreting the truth revealed to
Moses. In my dissertation more than a decade ago I defended the thesis that Philo is no Platonist.
I argued that Philo is no Platonist in the full sense, because both the sense of loyalty and the
feeling of obligation to take up as much as possible of the system are missing. I still believe this
view is correct. But at the same time I added that Platonism remains for Philo a pillar of his
thought which, if removed, would cause the whole edifice to totter and perhaps even collapse.
This complex attitude also characterizes how Platonism would fare in early Christian thought.
There is no sense of loyalty, indeed often one detects outright hostility. Yet Plato is often admired
as the pagan thinker closest to the truth of biblical revelation. And time and time again there is
demonstrable dependence on Platonic and Platonist ideas in the way that scripture is understood.

(4) But not all has yet been said. In my view a fourth and final aspect has yet to be
discussed before we can get the Philonic contribution to early Christian thought in full
perspective. So far we have noted a trend to dogmatism, the transmission of exegetical, and
particularly allegorical, themes, the preference for Platonism as a philosophical paradigm. But
there is still a last piece of the jigsaw puzzle missing. This can be made clear if we return to the
striking case of Clement of Alexandria. Clement, as we saw, was the first Christian to refer to
Philo by name. According to tradition he was born in Athens. We cannot be sure of this, but
what it symbolizes is very proBáble, namely that he learnt his philosophy before he became a
Christian. As we saw earlier, it was in Alexandria that he made acquaintance with the works of
Philo. But what did he seek to learn from them? Not his Platonism, for that he already knew well
enough. Certainly he obtained a good deal of exegetical material, but he also picked up
something that was much more valuable. What he learnt was how a link could be made between
Platonist ideas and the contents of scripture. It is this, I submit, that forms the greatest specific
contribution that Philo made to the beginnings of Christian thought. He showed how insights
from the Greek philosophical tradition could be localized in the authoritative words of scripture.
In this process the philosophical paradigm of Platonism had a special, if not exclusive, place.

MITHRAISM

The worship of Mithras was particularly popular in the Roman Empire in the first centuries of the Christian
Era11:

The Mithraic Mysteries or Mysteries of Mithras (also Mithraism) was a mystery religion which
became popular among the military in the Roman Empire, from the 1st to 4th centuries CE. It is
best attested in the cities of Rome and Ostia and in the Roman provinces of Mauretania, Britain,
and in the provinces along the Rhine and Danube frontier…

Mithraism was an initiatory order, passed from initiate to initiate, like the Eleusinian
Mysteries. It was not based on a body of scripture, and hence very little written documentary
evidence survives. Soldiers and the lower nobility appeared to be the most plentiful followers of
Mithraism. Until recently, women were generally thought not to have been allowed to join, but it
has now been suggested that "women were involved with Mithraic groups in at least some
locations of the empire."[1] Recently revealed discrepancies such as these suggest that Mithraic
beliefs were (contra the older supposition) not internally consistent and monolithic,cf.           [2]   but
rather, varied from location to location.

No Mithraic scripture or first-hand account of its highly secret rituals survives, with the
possible exception of a liturgy recorded in a 4th century papyrus, thought to be an atypical
representation of the cult at best.[3] Current knowledge of the mysteries is almost entirely limited
to what can be deduced from the iconography in the mithraea that have survived…

By the third century, Mithraism was officially sanctioned by the Roman emperors.[18]
According to the fourth century Historia Augusta, Commodus participated in its mysteries: Sacra
Mithriaca homicidio vero polluit, cum illic aliquid ad speciem timoris vel dici vel fingi soleat "He
desecrated the rites of Mithras with actual murder, although it was customary in them merely to
say or pretend something that would produce an impression of terror".[19]

… There is very little information about the decline of the religion. The edict of
Theodosius I in 394 made paganism illegal. Official recognition of Mithras in the army stopped
at this time, but we have no information on what other effect the edict had. Mithraism may have
survived in certain remote cantons of the Alps and Vosges into the fifth century.[20]

ALEXANDRIAN CULT

There were many religious cults thriving in Alexandria closely following the advent of Christianity, including Neo-
Platonism, Alexandrian Judaism, the worship of Cybele and Mithraism. Shoghi Effendi seems to be alluding to
another community of belief, and this is what was discovered12:

Just south of the city of Alexandria, perched high upon a lofty plateau overlooking the blue
waters of Lake Mareotis, there had lived for centuries before the Christian era, a group of men
and women who passed their lives in study and meditation. They were a branch of the
Pythagorean Essenes, and were known as the Therapeutae. Philo Judaeus has written a lengthy
description of them in his essay, On the Contemplative Life. He says:

"These Essenes are called Therapeutae, either because they profess the art of healing
superior to that in use in cities (for that only heals bodies, whereas the latter heals our souls as
well), or else because they have been schooled by the sacred laws to serve that which is better
than the Good, purer than the One and more ancient than the Monad."

"…The similarity, or rather identity, between the Essenes and the Christian Gnostics is
an undisputed fact, and is admitted by many early Christian writers. Epiphanius, Bishop of
Salamis, writing in the second century, says:

"They who believe on Christ were called Iessaei (or Essenes) before they were called Christians.
These derived their constitution from the significance of the name Iesus (Jesus), which in Hebrew
signifies the same as Therapeutae, that is, saviour or physician."

In this same century, Eusebius of Caesarea, the "father of ecclesiastical history," came
across the treatise of Philo Judaeus, On the Contemplative Life, which gave an obviously
trustworthy account of a group of men and women who had divested themselves of all worldly
possessions and lived a life of austerity and contemplation. Eusebius promptly seized upon Philo's
story and declared it to be a description of the first Christian Church in Alexandria. He says:
"The ancient Therapeutae were Christians, and their ancient writings were Gospels and
Epistles."

GNOSTICISM REVISITED

Shoghi Effendi makes another reference to Gnosticism, this time in his interpretation of a text written by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá13:

\[12\] http://www.blavatsky.net/magazine/theosophy/ww/setting/thegnostics.html

‘Abdu'l-Bahá says that the main difference between the gnostics and the religionists is that the
gnostics maintain the existence of only two worlds, the world of God and the world of the
creature. The prophets, however, maintained the existence of three worlds the world of God, the
world of the Will or the Word, and the world of created things. The prophets, therefore,
maintained that a knowledge of God was impossible. As ‘Abdu'l-Bahá says man can never know
God or even imagine Him. If he does that object is not God but an imaginary idol.

The source document to which Shoghi Effendi appears to be referring, in which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá counters the
philosophy of the “Gnostics” (in this case “Sufis”) with the theology of the Prophets, is Some Answered
Questions14:

To recapitulate: the Sufis admit God and the creature, and say that God resolves Himself into
the infinite forms of the creatures, and manifests like the sea, which appears in the infinite forms
of the waves. These phenomenal and imperfect waves are the same thing as the Preexistent Sea,
which is the sum of all the divine perfections. The Prophets, on the contrary, believe that there is
the world of God, the world of the Kingdom, and the world of Creation: three things.

HISTORY OF CANONIZATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT

Now that we know what religious and philosophical movements were in existence and competing with the Christian
teachings for the hearts and minds of humanity in the centuries immediately following the appearance of Jesus of
Nazareth, we will consider the New Testament as it came into being. According to scholars, the selection of certain
writings for inclusion in the New Testament and the exclusion of other writings did not begin immediately following
the passing of Jesus15:

The Catholic New Testament, as defined by the Council of Trent, does not differ, as regards the books
contained, from that of all Christian bodies at present. Like the Old Testament, the New has its
deuterocanonical books and portions of books, their canonicity having formerly been a subject of
some controversy in the Church. These are for the entire books: the Epistle to the Hebrews, that of
James, the Second of St. Peter, the Second and Third of John, Jude, and Apocalypse; giving
seven in all as the number of the New Testament contested books. The formerly disputed passages
are three: the closing section of St. Mark's Gospel, xvi, 9-20 about the apparitions of Christ after
the Resurrection; the verses in Luke about the bloody sweat of Jesus (22:43-44); the Pericope
Adulteræ, or narrative of the woman taken in adultery (John 7:53-8:11). Since the Council of Trent it is
not permitted for a Catholic to question the inspiration of these passages.

of Guidance, #1724, p. 510
14‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, p. 295.
15http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03274a.htm

The idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from the
beginning, that is from Apostolic times, has no foundation in history. The Canon of the New
Testament, like that of the Old, is the result of a development, of a process at once stimulated by
disputes with doubters, both within and without the Church, and retarded by certain obscurities
and natural hesitations, and which did not reach its final term until the dogmatic definition of the
Tridentine Council.

…Irenæus, in his work "Against Heresies" (A.D. 182-88), testifies to the existence of a
Tetramorph, or Quadriform Gospel, given by the Word and unified by one Spirit; to repudiate
this Gospel or any part of it, as did the Alogi and Marcionites, was to sin against revelation and the
Spirit of God. The saintly Doctor of Lyons explicitly states the names of the four Elements of this
Gospel, and repeatedly cites all the Evangelists in a manner parallel to his citations from the Old
Testament. From the testimony of St. Irenæus alone there can be no reasonable doubt that the Canon
of the Gospel was inalterably fixed in the Catholic Church by the last quarter of the second century.
Proofs might be multiplied that our canonical Gospels were then universally recognized in the
Church, to the exclusion of any pretended Evangels. The magisterial statement of Irenæus may be
corroborated by the very ancient catalogue known as the Muratorian Canon, and St. Hippolytus,
representing Roman tradition; by Tertullian in Africa, by Clement in Alexandria; the works of the
Gnostic Valentinus, and the Syrian Tatian's Diatessaron, a blending together of the Evangelists'
writings, presuppose the authority enjoyed by the fourfold Gospel towards the middle of the
second century. To this period or a little earlier belongs the pseudo-Clementine epistle in which
we find, for the first time after 2 Peter 3:16, the word Scripture applied to a New Testament book.
But it is needless in the present article to array the full force of these and other witnesses, since
even rationalistic scholars like Harnack admit the canonicity of the quadriform Gospel between the
years 140-175.

Bahá’u’lláh attests to the existence of the four canonical Gospels having been composed after the passing of Jesus16:

The Four Gospels were written after Him [Christ]. John, Luke,                                          Mark      and
Matthew these four wrote after Christ what they remembered of His utterances.

The numerous citations from these four canonical Gospels in the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh are cited in “Jesus and
the New Testament”, the following essay.

Shoghi Effendi confirmed the authenticity of selected quotations from these canonical Gospels17:

16From  a previously un-translated Tablet by Bahá’u’lláh: www.bahai-
library.org/uhj/resurrection.bible.html
17From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, dated 23 January 1944 to an individual believer; in

Compilation dated 14 September 1987 on the Resurrection of Christ.

...we cannot be sure how much or how little of the four Gospels are accurate and include the
words of Christ and His undiluted teachings, all we can be sure of, as Bahá'ís, is that what has
been quoted by Bahá'u'lláh and the Master must be absolutely authentic. As many times passages
in the Gospel of St. John are quoted we may assume that it is his Gospel and much of it accurate.

But were these canonical Gospels the only Gospels? Or were there other authentic records related to the life and
teachings of Jesus? A Bahá’í scholar who has studied this question has recently written18:

In one of His Tablets addressed to a Jewish convert to the Bahá’í religion named Hakim
Hayyim, Bahá’u’lláh responded to his question about why, despite Qur'an 61:6, the name
Ahmad is not found in the Gospels (Injil). In his reply the Bahá’í Prophet confirms the veracity of
the Qur'anic verse referring to Jesus' promise of the advent of Ahmad (=Muhammad) but
explains that this prophecy is not recorded in the extant (canonical) New Testament. The New
Testament, He states, is only a partial, an incomplete expository record of the divine revelation
to Jesus (the Injil).

This statement is confirmed in general and in the realm of principle, by an utterance attributed to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá by
Julia Grundy, a pilgrim to the Holy Land19:

Jesus was a dyer by trade. He also lived in Egypt. 'Out of Egypt have I called My Son' (Matt.
2:15; Hos. 11:1) was spoken of Jesus. The fifth Gospel which is considered non-canonical gave
[an]other history of Jesus than is contained in the Gospels of the New Testament. There were
fifty gospels, but only four were accepted as genuine by the priesthood.

Whether traces or fragments of the revelation to Jesus not preserved in the canonical Gospels have survived in some
other form is not a question that is answered either by Bahá’u’lláh or ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Nevertheless, in Bahá’í source
texts at least two references are found to non-canonical gospel traditions, the one paraphrased above of which
Bahá’u’lláh is the author, and the following anecdote written by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá20:

It happened one day in the time of Christ--may the life of the world be a sacrifice unto Him--that
He passed by the dead body of a dog, a carcass reeking, hideous, the limbs rotting away. One of

those present said: `How foul its stench!' And another said: `How sickening! How loathsome!' To
be brief, each one of them had something to add to the list. But then Christ Himself spoke, and
He told them: `Look at that dog's teeth! How gleaming white!'

While references to non-canonical gospel traditions in the Bahá’í texts are few and far between, there is no lack of
readily available for our perusal and study. In fact, a vast non-canonical Christian literature often called the
pseudepigrapha is in existence, and many of its documents are freely accessible on the internet21.

JESUS AND THE NEW TESTAMENT

Say: The first and foremost testimony establishing His truth is His own Self. Next to this
testimony is His Revelation. For whoso faileth to recognize either the one or the other He hath
established the words He hath revealed as proof of His reality and truth. This is, verily, an
evidence of His tender mercy unto men. He hath endowed every soul with the capacity to
recognize the signs of God. How could He, otherwise, have fulfilled His testimony unto men, if
ye be of them that ponder His Cause in their hearts. He will never deal unjustly with any one,
neither will He task a soul beyond its power. He, verily, is the Compassionate, the All-Merciful.22

Bahá’u’lláh attests to the “first and foremost testimony establishing” the prophetic station of the Manifestation of
God, reiterated in:

He Who is everlastingly hidden from the eyes of men can never be known except through His
Manifestation, and His Manifestation can adduce no greater proof of the truth of His Mission
than the proof of His own Person.23

Hence, one of the values of the New Testament is that it tells the story of the Person Who is its primary protagonist,
Jesus of Nazareth. It also recounts the stories of those who came into intimate contact with Jesus, including that
implacable enemy who was transformed by a mystical meeting with Him into His most influential advocate, Saul
of Tarsus. But when the Manifestation leaves this world, He does not leave Himself as a testimony…He leaves the
memory of His actions, and the record of His utterances. Bahá’u’lláh refers to the testimony of Muhammad as
follows in Kitáb-i-ĺqán:

Muhammad, Himself, as the end of His mission drew nigh, spoke these words: "Verily, I leave
amongst you My twin weighty testimonies: The Book of God and My Family." Although many
traditions had been revealed by that Source of Prophethood and Mine of divine Guidance, yet
He mentioned only that Book, thereby appointing it as the mightiest instrument and surest
testimony for the seekers; a guide for the people until the Day of Resurrection.

With unswerving vision, with pure heart, and sanctified spirit, consider attentively what God
hath established as the testimony of guidance for His people in His Book, which is recognized as
authentic by both the high and lowly. To this testimony we both, as well as all the peoples of the
world, must cling, that through its light we may know and distinguish between truth and
22Bahá’u’lláh,   Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, pp. 105-106
23Bahá’u’lláh,   Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 49

falsehood, guidance and error. Inasmuch as Muhammad hath confined His testimonies to His
Book and to His Family, and whereas the latter hath passed away, there remaineth His Book
only as His one testimony amongst the people.24

Consider, hath anything else besides the verses been established in the whole Book, as a standard
for the recognition of the Manifestations of His Beauty, that the people might cling to, and reject
the Manifestations of God? On the contrary, in every instance, He hath threatened with fire
those that repudiate and scoff at the verses, as already shown.25

When Jesus passed away, all that remained was “His one testimony amongst the people”, the
Gospel, as testified by Bahá’u’lláh in His Writings:

Afterwards, the companions and disciples of Jesus asked Him concerning those signs that must
needs signalize the return of His manifestation. When, they asked, shall these things be? Several
times they questioned that peerless Beauty, and, every time He made reply, He set forth a special
sign that should herald the advent of the promised Dispensation. To this testify the records of the
four Gospels.26

These are the melodies, sung by Jesus, Son of Mary, in accents of majestic power in the
Ridvan of the Gospel, revealing those signs that must needs herald the advent of the
Manifestation after Him. In the first Gospel according to Matthew it is recorded… Similarly, in
the three other Gospels, according to Luke, Mark, and John, the same statements are recorded.
As We have referred at length to these in Our Tablets revealed in the Arabic tongue, We have
made no mention of them in these pages, and have confined Ourselves to but one reference.27

Beside this passage, there is yet another verse in the Gospel wherein He saith: "Heaven
and earth shall pass away: but My words shall not pass away."28 Thus it is that the adherents of
Jesus maintained that the law of the Gospel shall never be annulled, and that whensoever the
promised Beauty is made manifest and all the signs are revealed, He must needs re-affirm and
establish the law proclaimed in the Gospel, so that there may remain in the world no faith but
His faith. This is their fundamental belief. And their conviction is such that were a person to be
made manifest with all the promised signs and to promulgate that which is contrary to the letter

24Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb-i-ĺqán, pp. 201-202

26Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb-i-ĺqán, p. 21

of the law of the Gospel, they must assuredly renounce him, refuse to submit to his law, declare
him an infidel, and laugh him to scorn.29

Consider now, had the people of the Gospel recognized the meaning of the symbolic
terms "sun" and "moon," had they sought, unlike the froward and perverse, enlightenment from
Him Who is the Revealer of divine knowledge, they would have surely comprehended the
purpose of these terms, and would not have become afflicted and oppressed by the darkness of
their selfish desires. Yea, but since they have failed to acquire true knowledge from its very
Source, they have perished in the perilous vale of waywardness and misbelief. They still have not
awakened to perceive that all the signs foretold have been made manifest, that the promised Sun
hath risen above the horizon of divine Revelation, and that the "sun" and "moon" of the
teachings, the laws, and learning of a former Dispensation have darkened and set.30

Judge fairly: Were the prophecies recorded in the Gospel to be literally fulfilled; were
Jesus, Son of Mary, accompanied by angels, to descend from the visible heaven upon the clouds;
who would dare to disbelieve, who would dare to reject the truth, and wax disdainful?31

Our purpose in relating these things is to warn you that were they to maintain that those verses
wherein the signs referred to in the Gospel are mentioned have been perverted, were they to
reject them, and cling instead to other verses and traditions, you should know that their words
were utter falsehood and sheer calumny.32

We have also heard a number of the foolish of the earth assert that the genuine text of the
heavenly Gospel doth not exist amongst the Christians, that it hath ascended unto heaven. How
grievously they have erred! How oblivious of the fact that such a statement imputeth the gravest
injustice and tyranny to a gracious and loving Providence! How could God, when once the Day-
star of the beauty of Jesus had disappeared from the sight of His people, and ascended unto the
fourth heaven, cause His holy Book, His most great testimony amongst His creatures, to
disappear also? What would be left to that people to cling to from the setting of the day-star of
Jesus until the rise of the sun of the Muhammadan Dispensation? What law could be their stay
and guide? How could such people be made the victims of the avenging wrath of God, the
omnipotent Avenger? How could they be afflicted with the scourge of chastisement by the
heavenly King? Above all, how could the flow of the grace of the All-Bountiful be stayed? How

could the ocean of His tender mercies be stilled? We take refuge with God, from that which His
creatures have fancied about Him! Exalted is He above their comprehension!33

In another passage of the Gospel it is written34: "And it came to pass that on a certain day
the father of one of the disciples of Jesus had died. That disciple reporting the death of his father
unto Jesus, asked for leave to go and bury him. Whereupon, Jesus, that Essence of Detachment,
answered and said: "Let the dead bury their dead."35

It is also recorded in the Gospel according to St. Luke, that on a certain day Jesus passed
by a Jew who was sick of the palsy, and lay upon a couch. When the Jew saw Him, he recognized
Him, and cried out for His help. Jesus said unto him: "Arise from thy bed; thy sins are forgiven
thee." Certain of the Jews, standing by, protested saying: "Who can forgive sins, but God alone?"
And immediately He perceived their thoughts, Jesus answering said unto them: "Whether is it
easier to say to the sick of the palsy, arise, and take up thy bed, and walk; or to say, thy sins are
forgiven thee? that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins."36 This
is the real sovereignty, and such is the power of God's chosen Ones! All these things which We
have repeatedly mentioned, and the details which We have cited from divers sources, have no
other purpose but to enable thee to grasp the meaning of the allusions in the utterances of the
chosen Ones of God, lest certain of these utterances cause thy feet to falter and thy heart to be
dismayed.37

Moreover, those whom they had formerly known were Moses, the Revealer of the Pentateuch,
and Jesus, the Author of the Gospel. Notwithstanding, why did Muhammad say: "When He of
Whom they had knowledge came unto them" -- that is Jesus or Moses -- "they disbelieved in
Him?" Was not Muhammad to outward seeming called by a different name? Did He not come
forth out of a different city? Did He not speak a different language, and reveal a different Law?
How then can the truth of this verse be established, and its meaning be made clear?38

Wherefore, O my friend, it behooveth Us to exert the highest endeavour to attain unto
that City, and, by the grace of God and His loving-kindness, rend asunder the "veils of glory"; so
that, with inflexible steadfastness, we may sacrifice our drooping souls in the path of the New
Beloved. We should with tearful eyes, fervently and repeatedly, implore Him to grant us the
favour of that grace. That city is none other than the Word of God revealed in every age and

dispensation. In the days of Moses it was the Pentateuch; in the days of Jesus the Gospel; in the
days of Muhammad the Messenger of God the Qur'án; in this day the Bayan; and in the
dispensation of Him Whom God will make manifest His own Book -- the Book unto which all the
Books of former Dispensations must needs be referred, the Book which standeth amongst them
all transcendent and supreme. In these cities spiritual sustenance is bountifully provided, and
incorruptible delights have been ordained. The food they bestow is the bread of heaven, and the
Spirit they impart is God's imperishable blessing. Upon detached souls they bestow the gift of
Unity, enrich the destitute, and offer the cup of knowledge unto them who wander in the
wilderness of ignorance. All the guidance, the blessings, the learning, the understanding, the
faith, and certitude, conferred upon all that is in heaven and on earth, are hidden and treasured
within these Cities.39

Even as the Christian divines who, holding fast to the verse of the Gospel to which We
have already referred40, have sought to explain that the law of the Gospel shall at no time be
annulled, and that no independent Prophet shall again be made manifest, unless He confirmeth
the law of the Gospel. Most of the people have become afflicted with the same spiritual disease.41

As alluded to above, Bahá’u’lláh cited other verses from the Gospels in a treatise revealed in Arabic, and entitled
Jawahiru’l-Asrar42:

This is the text of that which was revealed aforetime in the first Gospel, according to Matthew,
regarding the signs that must needs herald the advent of the One Who shall come after Him. He
saith: "And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days..."43, until
the mystic Dove, singing in the midmost heart of eternity, and the celestial Bird, warbling upon
the Divine Lote-Tree, saith: "Immediately after the oppression of those days shall the sun be
darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the
powers of the heavens shall be shaken: and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in
heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man
coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he shall send his angels with a
great sound of a trumpet."44

In the second Gospel, according to Mark, the Dove of holiness speaketh in such terms: "For in
those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God
39Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb-i-ĺqán, pp. 199-200
40"Heaven    and earth shall pass away: but My words shall not pass away." (Gospel of
Matthew 24:35; Gospel of Mark 13:31; Gospel of Luke 21:33)
41Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb-i-ĺqán, p. 212
42Bahá’u’lláh, Gems of Divine Mysteries, pp. 8-10
created unto this time, neither shall be."45 And it singeth later with the same melodies as before,
without change or alteration. God, verily, is a witness unto the truth of My words.

And in the third Gospel, according to Luke, it is recorded: "There shall be signs in the
sun, and in the moon, and in the stars, and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the
sea and the waves roaring; and the powers of heaven shall be shaken. And then shall they see the
Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. And when these things begin to come
to pass, know that the kingdom of God hath drawn nigh."46

And in the fourth Gospel, according to John, it is recorded: "But when the Comforter is
come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth
from the Father, he shall testify of me: and ye also shall bear witness."47 And elsewhere He saith:
"But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall
teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto
you."48 And: "But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither
goest thou? But because I have said these things unto you..."49 And yet again: "Nevertheless I tell
you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not
come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you."50 And: "Howbeit when he, the Spirit of
truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he
shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come."51

And should they reply: "The Books that are in the hands of this people, which they call
the Gospel and attribute to Jesus, the Son of Mary, have not been revealed by God and proceed
not from the Manifestations of His Self", then this would imply a cessation in the abounding
grace of Him Who is the Source of all grace. If so, God's testimony to His servants would have
remained incomplete and His favour proven imperfect. His mercy would not have shone
resplendent, nor would His grace have overshadowed all. For if at the ascension of Jesus His
Book had likewise ascended unto heaven, then how could God reprove and chastise the people
on the Day of Resurrection, as hath been written by the Imams of the Faith and affirmed by its
illustrious divines?52
52Bahá’u’lláh, Gems of Divine Mysteries, pp. 12-13

It is recorded in all the Books of the Gospel that He Who is the Spirit spoke in words of
pure light unto His disciples, saying: "Know that heaven and earth may pass away, but my words
shall never pass away."53 As is clear and evident to thine eminence, these words outwardly mean
that the Books of the Gospel will remain in the hands of people till the end of the world, that
their laws shall not be abrogated, that their testimony shall not be abolished, and that all that
hath been enjoined, prescribed, or ordained therein shall endure forever.

O My brother! Sanctify thy heart, illumine thy soul, and sharpen thy sight, that thou
mayest perceive the sweet accents of the Birds of Heaven and the melodies of the Doves of
Holiness warbling in the Kingdom of eternity, and perchance apprehend the inner meaning of
these utterances and their hidden mysteries. For otherwise, wert thou to interpret these words
according to their outward meaning, thou couldst never prove the truth of the Cause of Him
Who came after Jesus, nor silence the opponents, nor prevail over the contending disbelievers.
For the Christian divines use this verse to prove that the Gospel shall never be abrogated and
that, even if all the signs recorded in their Books were fulfilled and the Promised One appeared,
He would have no recourse but to rule the people according to the ordinances of the Gospel.
They contend that if He were to manifest all the signs indicated in the Books, but decree aught
besides that which Jesus had decreed, they would neither acknowledge nor follow Him, so clear
and self-evident is this matter in their sight.54

In other Writings Bahá’u’lláh likewise refers to the Gospel as the revelation to Jesus:

The followers of the Gospel, likewise, hold as impossible that the Bearer of a new Revelation
should again shine forth from the dayspring of the Will of God after Jesus, Son of Mary -- peace
be upon Him! In support of this contention, they adduce the following verse from the Gospel:
"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but the words of the Son of Man shall never pass away."55
They maintain that neither the teachings nor the commandments of Jesus -- peace be upon Him!
-- may ever be altered.

At one point in the Gospel, He saith: "I go away, and come again."56 Again in the Gospel of
John, He hath foretold the advent of a Comforter who shall come after Him.57 In the Gospel of
Luke, moreover, a number of signs and portents have been mentioned. Certain divines of that
Faith, however, have interpreted these utterances after their own fancy, and have thus failed to
grasp their true significance.
54Bahá’u’lláh,Gems of Divine Mysteries, pp. 17-19
57Gospel of John 14:16, 14:26, 15:26, 16:7

O would that thou wouldst permit Me, O Shah, to send unto thee that which would
cheer the eyes, and tranquillize the souls, and persuade every fair-minded person that with Him
is the knowledge of the Book. Certain persons, incapable of answering the objections raised by
their opponents, claim that the Torah and the Gospel have been corrupted, whereas in reality
the references to such corruption pertain only to specific cases.5859

Again, heard ye not that which hath been recorded in the Gospel concerning those
"which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God"60 -
- that is, those who have been made manifest through the power of God? Wherefore it becometh
evident that one may well be manifested in the world of creation who is truly of God, the
Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. How is it then that when word reached you of Our
Cause, ye failed to inquire from Our own lips, that ye might distinguish truth from falsehood,
discover Our aim and purpose, and learn of the afflictions which We have suffered at the hands
of an evil and wayward generation?

O Minister of the King of Paris! Hast thou forgotten the pronouncement recorded in the
Gospel according to John concerning the Word and those who are its Manifestations? And hast
thou ignored the counsels of the Spirit [Jesus] concerning the Manifestations of the Word, and
been numbered with the heedless?61

The revelation of the Gospel to Jesus of Nazareth is also attested by the Qur’an, the Book revealed to Muhammad:

In the Suratu’l-‘Imran62:

It is He Who sent down to thee (step by step), in truth, the Book, confirming what went before it;
and He sent down Law (of Moses) and the Gospel (of Jesus) before this, as a guide to mankind,
and He sent down the Criterion (of judgment between right and wrong).63

Behold! the angels said "O Mary! Allah giveth thee glad tidings of a Word from Him: his name
will be Christ Jesus, the son of Mary, held in honor in this world and the Hereafter and of (the
company of) those nearest to Allah.

62The Qur'an (Yusuf Ali tr), Surah 3:3; 45-65
63The Qur'an (Yusuf Ali tr), Surah 3:3

"He shall speak to the people in childhood and in maturity, and he shall be (of the company) of
the righteous."

She said: "O my Lord! how shall I have a son when no man hath touched me?" He said: "Even
so: Allah createth what He willeth; when He hath decreed a plan, He but saith to it 'Be', and it is!

"And Allah will teach him the Book and Wisdom, the Law and the Gospel.

"And (appoint him) a Messenger to the Children of Israel, (with this message): I have come to
you, with a sign from your Lord, in that I make for you out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird,
and breathe into it, and it becomes a bird by Allah's leave; and I heal those born blind, and the
lepers, and I quicken the dead, by Allah's leave; and I declare to you what ye eat, and what ye
store in your houses. Surely therein is a Sign for you if ye did believe.

"(I have come to you), to attest the Law which was before me, and to make lawful to you part of
what was (before) forbidden to you; I have come to you with a Sign from your Lord. So fear
Allah, and obey me.

"It is Allah who is my Lord and your Lord; then worship Him. This is a way that is straight."

When Jesus found unbelief on their part he said: "Who will be my helpers to (the work of) Allah?"
Said the Disciples: "We are Allah's helpers, we believe in Allah, and do thou bear witness that we
are Muslims.

"Our Lord! we believe in what thou hast revealed, and we follow the Messenger; then write us
down among those who bear witness."

And (then unbelievers) plotted and planned, and Allah too planned, and the best of planners is
Allah.

Behold! Allah said: "O Jesus! I will take thee and raise thee to Myself and clear thee (of the
falsehoods) of those who blaspheme; I will make those who follow thee superior to those who
reject Faith, to the Day of Resurrection; then shall ye all return unto Me, and I will judge
between you of the matters wherein ye dispute.

"As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the
Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help.

"As to those who believe and work righteousness, Allah will pay them (in full) their reward; but
Allah loveth not those who do wrong.

"This is what We rehearse unto thee of the Signs and the Message of Wisdom."

This similitude of Jesus before Allah is as that of Adam: He created him from dust, then said to
him: "Be", and he was.

The truth (comes) from Allah alone; so be not of those who doubt.

If anyone disputes in this matter with thee, now after (full) knowledge hath come to thee, say:
"Come! let us gather together, our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves
and yourselves: then let us earnestly pray, and invoke the curse of Allah on those who lie!"

This is the true account: there is no god except Allah; and Allah -- He is indeed the Exalted in
Power, the Wise.

But if they turn back, Allah hath full knowledge of those who do mischief.

Say: "O People of the Book! come to common terms as between us and you: that we worship
none but Allah; that we associate no partners with Him; that we erect not, from among ourselves,
Lords and patrons other than Allah." If then they turn back, say: "Bear witness that we (at least)
are Muslims (bowing to Allah's will)."

Ye People of the Book! why dispute ye about Abraham, when the Law and the Gospel were not
revealed till after him? Have ye no understanding?

In the Suratu’l-Ma’idah64:

And in their footsteps We sent Jesus the son of Mary, confirming the Law that had come before
him: We sent him the Gospel: therein was guidance and light, and confirmation of the Law that
had come before him: a guidance and an admonition to those who fear Allah.

Let the People of the Gospel judge by what Allah hath revealed therein. If any do fail to judge by
(the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are (no better than) those who rebel.

\[64\] The Qur'an (Yusuf Ali tr), Surah 5:46-47; 66-68; 110-112.

If only they had stood fast by the Law, the Gospel, and all the revelation that was sent to them
from their Lord, they would have enjoyed happiness from every side. There is from among them
a party on the right course; but many of them follow a course that is evil. O Messenger! proclaim
the (Message) which hath been sent to thee from thy Lord. If thou didst not, thou wouldst not
have fulfilled and proclaimed His mission: and Allah will defend thee from men (who mean
mischief). For Allah guideth not those who reject Faith. Say: "O People of the Book! ye have no
ground to stand upon unless ye stand fast by the Law, the Gospel, and all the revelation that has
come to you from your Lord." It is the revelation that cometh to thee from thy Lord, that
increaseth in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy. But sorrow thou not over
(these) people without Faith.

Then will Allah say: "O Jesus the son of Mary! recount My favor to thee and to thy mother.
Behold! I strengthened thee with the holy spirit, so that thou didst speak to the people in
childhood and in maturity. Behold! I taught thee the Book and Wisdom, the Law and the
Gospel. And behold! thou makest out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, by My leave, and
thou breathest into it, and it becometh a bird by My leave, and thou healest those born blind,
and the lepers by My leave. And behold! thou bringest forth the dead by My leave. And behold! I
did restrain the Children of Israel from (violence to) thee when thou didst show them the Clear
Signs, and the unbelievers among them, said: 'This is nothing but evident magic'.

"And behold! I inspired the Disciples to have faith in Me and My Messenger: they said, 'We have
faith, and do thou bear witness that we bow to Allah as Muslims.'"

Behold! the disciples said: "O Jesus the son of Mary! can thy Lord send down to us a table set
(with viands) from heaven?" Said Jesus: "Fear Allah, if ye have faith."

In the Suratu’l-A’raf 65:

"Those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, whom they find mentioned in their
own (Scriptures); in the law and the Gospel; for he commands them what is just and forbids them
what is evil: he allows them as lawful what is good (and pure) and prohibits them from what is
bad (and impure); He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the yokes that are upon
them. So it is those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the light which is sent
down with him, it is they who will prosper."

In the Suratu’t-Tawbah66:

\[65\] The Qur'an (Yusuf Ali tr), Surah 7:157

\[66\] The Qur'an (Yusuf Ali tr), Surah 9:111

Allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their good; for theirs (in return) is the
garden (of Paradise): they fight in His cause, and slay and are slain: a promise binding on Him in
truth, through the Law, the Gospel, and the Qur'án: and who is more faithful to his Covenant
than Allah? Then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded: that is the achievement
supreme.

In the Suratu Sad67:

Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; and those who are with him are strong against
Unbelievers, (but) compassionate amongst each other. Thou wilt see them bow and prostrate
themselves (in prayer), seeking Grace from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. On their faces are
their marks, (being) the traces of their prostration. This is their similitude in the Torah; and their
similitude in the Gospel is: like a seed which sends forth its blade, then makes it strong; it then
becomes thick, and it stands on its own stem, (filling) the sowers with wonder and delight. As a
result, it fills the Unbelievers with rage at him. Allah has promised those among them who
believe and do righteous deeds Forgiveness, and a great Reward.

In the Suratu’l-Hadid68:

Then, in their wake, We followed them up with (others of) Our messengers: We sent after them
Jesus the son of Mary, and bestowed on him the Gospel; and We ordained in the hearts of those
who followed him Compassion and Mercy. But the monasticism which they invented for
themselves, We did not prescribe for them: (We commanded) only the seeking for the Good
pleasure of Allah; but that they did not foster as they should have done. Yet We bestowed, on
those among them who believed, their (due) reward, but many of them are rebellious
transgressors.

Finally, in the New Testament itself, apart from the titles of the four canonical Gospels, there are references to the
Gospel revealed to Jesus of Nazareth --

In the Gospel of Matthew:

And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the
kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.69

67The Qur'an (Yusuf Ali tr), Surah 38:29
68The Qur'an (Yusuf Ali tr), Surah 57:27
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the
gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.70

Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, And
said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another? Jesus answered and said
unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see: The blind receive
their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up,
and the poor have the gospel preached to them.71

And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations;
and then shall the end come.72

Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall
also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.73

In the Gospel of Mark:

The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; As it is written in the prophets,
Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.74

Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the
kingdom of God, And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye,
and believe the gospel.75

For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the
gospel's, the same shall save it.76

And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or
brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the
gospel's, But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters,
and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.77
74Gospel of Mark 1:1-2
75Gospel of Mark 1:14-15
77Gospel of Mark 10:29-30

And the gospel must first be published among all nations.78

Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world,
this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.79

And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.80

In the Gospel of Luke:

And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the
book, he found the place where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he
hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to
preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that
are bruised, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.81

Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and
heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are
raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.82

And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing
everywhere.83

And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and
preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders, And spake
unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee
this authority?84

To summarize then, in the Gospels, as cited in the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, and as denominated in the Qur’an and
the canonical gospels, are set forth the utterances of Jesus of Nazareth, His divinely-revealed teachings, His “glad
tidings”. All of these sources refer to His teachings as the Gospel. Only the traditional titles of the canonical gospels
denote them as such, with the sole exception of the Gospel according to St. Mark, which begins with these words:
“1:1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God…” Many attempts have
been made to compile the sayings of Jesus, separately from the accounts of His actions and the actions of those
around Him. Possibly the earliest was the compilation of the Gospel of Thomas (attributed to
Didymus/Thomas Judas and written, according to contemporary scholars, between 50 and 100 CE). The “logia”
(Greek for “sayings”) 85 of Jesus cited by early Christian writers including Papias (c. 60-135 CE86), reported by
Eusebius (c.263-339 CE87) have been supposed by many scholars writing in the past century to be the source of
the utterances of Jesus reported in the synoptic gospels. While the hypothesis suggesting the existence of “Q”
(“Quelle” in German denoting “source”), an urtext collection of logia predating the composition of the synoptic
gospels has been in increasing vogue since its first introduction in the 19th century, it has not been universally
embraced by scholars. No manuscript copy of such a “Q” has been discovered as of yet. Published collections of
logia include The Complete Sayings of Jesus (Arthur Hinds, 1927)88 and various online lists generated in the past
few years. Other compilers have sought to simplify the Gospels, including The Philosophy of Jesus of Nazareth,
extracted from the account of his life and doctrines, as given by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John; being an
abridgment of the New Testament for the use of the Indians, unembarrassed with matters of fact or faith beyond the
level of their comprehension (Thomas Jefferson, 1803)89 and Leo Tolstoy’s The Gospel in Brief (Leo Tolstoy,
1883)90 Another similar genre were the harmonies of the gospels compiled from the very earliest times, the first of
which was proBábly the Diatessaron (c. 150-160 CE91) of Tatian (c. 120-180 CE92), adopted by the
Syriac Church until the 5th century CE. Since the discovery of a nearly complete text of the Gospel of Thomas
at Nag Hammadi in 1945, and its publication in English translation in 197793, numerous collections of the
sayings of Jesus have appeared, in print and online, including versions with parallel sayings from the canonical
gospels, parallel sayings from canonical and non-canonical gospels (including the Gospel of Thomas), and
parallel sayings from the gospels and the utterances attributed to Lao-Tsu, Buddha and Muhammad.

JESUS THE PROMISED ONE – PROPHECIES FULFILLED

The earliest proof that we come into contact with for every new Prophet of God are the
prophecies of previous, preceding Prophets which are fulfilled in the manifestation of succeeding
Prophets. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated: "One of the proofs is through the fulfillment of former
prophecies...The prophecies deal with dates and symbols which proclaim the end of each
dispensation. In former books the conditions are explained concerning subsequent manifestors of
the divine plan."94 On another occasion He asserted categorically that every Prophet predicted
His successor and acknowledged the truth of His predecessor.95 Bahá'u'llah in Kitab-i-Iqan (KI)
makes several references to this theme which are quoted in full here:

> KI:13: ...all the Prophets of God, whenever made manifest unto the peoples of the world, have
> invariably foretold the coming of yet another Prophet after them, and have established such
> signs as would herald the advent of the future Dispensation. To this the records of all sacred
> books bear witness.

> KI:17: Those words uttered by the Revealers of the beauty of the one true God, setting forth
> the signs that should herald the advent of the Manifestation to come...

> KI:237: For whatsoever hath come to pass, hath been prophesied by them who are the Mines
> of divine knowledge, and Recipients of God's eternal law.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá acknowledges however that "those who do not follow closely these things will not
be convinced by proofs such as these. This then is not a final proof."96 Many people do not pay
much attention to prophecies in the Holy Books, let alone to the fine points of their
interpretation, and their fulfillment in actual historically-verifiable events and personalities. As
real and infallible even as this proof may be, it will not be convincing to many of those who are
not familiar with the prophecies. This is a pragmatic statement, and one which might inspire
religionists to reconsider the age-old practice of repeating arguments 'ad nauseum' when they
obviously are not convincing to many of their listeners simply because they believe them to be
true and they want others to believe as they believe.

\[94\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on Divine Philosophy (ABDP), p. 43.

\[95\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Star of the West, volume XVI:2, p.434.

96Abdu’l-Baha on Divine Philosophy, p. 43.

Furthermore, inasmuch as "religious traditions are the report and record of understanding and
interpretation of the Book" PUP:22)97 and as "this understanding, this interpretation" has been
reached through "the analysis of human reason"(PUP:22), and as we have already learned from
Him "that human reason is not to be relied upon as an infallible criterion"(PUP:21) then
"Inasmuch as the source of traditions and interpretations is human reason, and human reason is
faulty, how can we depend upon its findings for real knowledge?"(PUP:22)

What is intended as a proof of the Prophets of God is turned by many into a prime reason for
denial of and opposition to the Prophets of God. The essence of the Bahá’í teaching on this
matter is this: the only reliable, infallible interpretations of the prophecies are those of the
Prophets of God themselves and whomever they may appoint as their spokesmen after their
ascension from this world.

PROPHECIES OF THE ZOROASTRIANS

In the Scriptures of the Jewish, Samaritan and Zoroastrian religions, there are prophecies which,
according to the Gospels, were fulfilled in the advent of Jesus [Yeshu'a], the Messiah [ha-Mashiakh].
The Zoroastrian eschatology begins with Zarathushtra, continues with Oshetar after a millennium;
then Oshetarmah after a second millennium; and finally, Saoshyans, the "Savior" after a third
millennium and at the beginning of the fourth millennium. In this scheme, Oshetar seems to
correspond to Jesus, who appeared during the first millennium after Zarathushtra. (This information
is derived from the "Larousse World Mythology," 1965: pp. 197-198.) Did any Zoroastrians expect
the advent of Jesus during His lifetime? We know, from the account preserved in the Gospel of
Matthew (2:1-2,7-13), that three wise men (the Magi) made the pilgrimage to Bethlehem, confident
that the star they had been following would lead them to the promised One. Who were the Magi?
Either they were astrologers, as the text has been rendered in "The New English Bible" (Oxford
University/Cambridge University, 1970, p. 4) and in "The New World Translation of the Holy
Scriptures" (Watch Tower Bible, 1984, p. 1177); or they were Zoroastrians. Neither the New
Testament nor the Qur’an or the Bahá’í Writings contain any statement by Jesus or a subsequent
Manifestation of God to the effect that Jesus was the promised Oshetar of the Zoroastrians, or that
the Magi were Zoroastrians…we cannot be sure, but it seems likely.

PROPHECIES OF THE SAMARITANS

The Samaritan Scriptures are readily available to us--they consist of the five books (chumash or
pentateuch) of Moses, called in Hebrew the Torah, in the Samaritan language. That these
Scriptures contained prophecies of a Messiah to appear at the epoch of Jesus is attested by the

\[97\] PUP=The Promulgation of Universal Peace.

existence of a Samaritan claimant to the Messianic station, whose forcible suppression by Pontius
Pilatus, in 35 A.D. resulted in his recall to Rome and his retirement from public service. This
claimant, called Taheb, and his followers among the Samaritans are described in Flavius Josephus'
"The Antiquities of the Jews" (XVIII. iv. 1-2). While we do not know for sure which Scriptural
verses this Samaritan claimant cited in support of his Messianic role, nevertheless, there are not
many to be found in the Torah. Balaam’s prophecy, that "there shall come a Star [‫ כּוֹכָב‬kochav in
Hebrew; ἄστρον astron in Greek] out of Jacob" (Numbers 24:17) is not cited in the New Testament as
being fulfilled by Jesus. Out of Jacob came twelve sons, and of these, the progeny ascribed to
Menasseh and Ephraim and some of the descendants of Benjamin and Levi came to settle in
Samaria after the return of the Israelites (children of Jacob) from Egypt, and also after the
Bábylonian captivity under Nebuchadnezzar. Hence, this prophecy could have been fulfilled by a
Samaritan, and hence the appeal of this Samaritan claimant for the surrounding population, as well
as other claimants who appeared at other times. As a descendant of Judah, another son of Jacob and
hence also “out of Jacob”. There is a passage in the Gospel of John which seems to indicate that
Balaam’s prophecy was fulfilled by Jesus, and that at least one Samaritan recognized Him. In the 4th
chapter of the Gospel of John we read: 3 He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee. 4 And he
must needs go through Samaria. 5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar,
near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 6 Now Jacob's well [here is the
specific reference to Jacob] was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on
the well: and it was about the sixth hour. 7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water:
Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. 8 (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy
meat.) 9 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest
drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
10 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to

thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living
water. 11 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep:
from whence then hast thou that living water? 12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob [and here
the Samaritan woman points to their common descendant, Jacob], which gave us the well, and drank
thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? 13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever
drinketh of this water shall thirst again: 14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give
him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing
up into everlasting life.[this passage recalls parallels in the Gospel of John 5:46 and 8:56-58 in which the
sublimity of His prophetic station is depicted by Jesus with reference to previous holy men who were regarded, as the
Samaritan woman regarded Jacob, as without peer] 15 The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this
water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. 16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband,
and come hither. 17 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her,
Thou hast well said, I have no husband: 18 For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou
now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. 19 The woman saith unto him, Sir, I

perceive that thou art a prophet. [she says this because Jesus demonstrates His divinely endowed knowledge,
which she recognizes as only endowed to prophets] 20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain [speaking of
Mount Gerizim, which is one of two mountains which loom above Jacob’s well, close to the ancient city of
Shemchem]; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 21 Jesus saith
unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet
at Jerusalem, worship the Father. 22 Ye worship ye know not what [Jesus speaks not of Judaic versus
Samaritan worship, for otherwise this phrase would not immediately follow His prediction that “ye shall neither in
this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father…rather He is referring to all worship that does not
recognize the Father in the Son Who has appeared, in Him]: we know what we worship: for salvation is of
the Jews. [in Hebrew ha-yehudim, in which Jesus could be referring to Himself as a descendant of Yehudah, one
of the sons of Jacob, who settled in the land called Judaea] 23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the
true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to
worship him.[Jesus refers to the worship which goes beyond ethnic or national loyalties] 24 God is a Spirit:
and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. 25 The woman saith unto him,
I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. [the
woman knows of Messiah, because Messiah is promised in the Samaritan scriptures, as we shall see, even if few
recognized Balaam’s prophecy as referring to Messiah] 26 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am
he. [one of the most direct statements of Jesus that is recorded in which He declares Himself as Messiah] 27 And
at this point His disciples came, and they marveled that He talked with a woman; yet no one said,
“What do You seek?” or, “Why are You talking with her?” 28 The woman then left her waterpot,
went her way into the city, and said to the men, 29 “Come, see a Man who told me all things that
I ever did. Could this be the Christ?” 30 Then they went out of the city and came to Him. [This
story ends here, but presumably the Samaritan men came to Jesus after hearing about Him from the woman. She
was the first Samaritan apostle, and, like Mary Magdalene, a woman with a less than sterling past, possessed of
five husbands while Mary was possessed of seven demons.]

While Balaam’s prophecy is not cited in the New Testament, and was not recognized by most
Christian commentators historically as fulfilled by Jesus, the remarkable correlations between the
language of the prophecy and the encounter between Jesus and the Samaritan woman at the well
of Jacob are worthy of our considered examination.

The Messianic promise that is unmistakably found in the Samaritan Scriptures and would be known
to the Samaritan woman is God’s promise recorded in the Book of Deuteronomy (13:1-5; 18:15,18-
22), in which He says "I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee"
(Deut 18:18). As the Samaritans were descendants of the children of Israel, and hence of their
“brethren”, this promise was as familiar to Samaritans as it was to Jews. The Samaritan woman
whom Jesus met at the well of Jacob asked if He was the promised Messiah, and He replied that He

was. Hence, this can be regarded as a fulfillment of Samaritan prophetic tradition as well as of
Jewish scriptural tradition.

PROPHECIES CITED BY JOHN THE BAPTIST

John the Baptist, according to two of the Gospel authors (Matthew and Luke), described signs of the
one who was to follow him. Those signs may also indicate the fulfillment of prophecies found in the
Hebrew Scriptures. In the Gospel of Matthew (3:11-12), and the Gospel of Luke (3:16-17), John
states that "he that cometh after me" will "baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: Whose
fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but
he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire." Not only are these prophecies in their own right,
but they seem to refer to verses in the Hebrew Scriptures, which John indicated would be fulfilled by
his successor. First, the baptism with the Holy Spirit and with fire is referred to in the book of Isaiah
(4:4; 44:3), the book of Malachi (3:2-3), and the book of Zechariah (13:9-14:1). In Isaiah (4:4) we
read: "When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have
purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the
spirit of burning"; and (44:3): "For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the
dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring". In
Malachi (3:2-3) we read: "But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he
appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' sope: And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier
of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that
they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness." In Zechariah (13:9-14:1) we read: "13:9
And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and
will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is
my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God. 14:1 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh,
and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee." Second, "gather his wheat into the garner" is
found in the book of Micah (4:12): "for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor." Third,
"he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire" is also found in the book of Malachi (4:1): "For
behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly,
shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall
leave them neither root nor branch."

Closely associated with these prophecies are other verses that are worthy of note. Just prior to the
first cited prophetic verse in Isaiah (4:4) we read: "4:2 In that day shall the branch of the LORD be
beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are
escaped of Israel." Also preceding the second prophetic verse cited in Malachi (3:2-3) we read: "3:1
Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom
ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in:

behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts." In Zechariah (14:4) we read: "14:4 And his feet
shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the
mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there
shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it
toward the south." Not surprisingly, Christian commentators through the centuries have identified
Jesus as the “branch of the Lord” (also referred to in the book of Jeremiah 2:5-6), as “the Lord…the
messenger of the covenant” and John the Baptist as the “messenger” of the Lord, who “shall
prepare the way before me”, and have noted that the feet of Jesus did indeed stand “upon the
mount of Olives” and that an earthquake occurred upon His crucifixion.

PROPHECIES CITED BY JESUS

Did Jesus indicate that He fulfilled prophecies at all? In the Gospel of Matthew (13:17), Jesus is
reported to have said: "That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things
which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard
them." This verse is susceptible of at least two interpretations: it may indicate that prophets and
righteous men have been endowed with foresight, and have thus wished to see and hear Jesus; it
may affirm that prophets and righteous men would have wished to see and hear Jesus, but are
unable to do so because they died prior to His advent--both meanings are possible, and perhaps
both are intended. When He is arrested, Jesus indicates that He could save Himself "But how then
shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?" (26:54) The author of the Gospel of Matthew
states that "all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." (26:56) This
recalls His statement, included in the famous sermon on the mount (5:17): "Think not that I am
come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill." Jesus comes to
fulfill prophecy, not to destroy faith in the Prophets. Likewise, Jesus comes to spiritualize the law, not
to destroy the divine commandments. He continues, in the same sermon (5:19-20): "Whosoever
therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called
the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called
great in the kingdom of heaven. For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the
righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven." In
the Gospel of Mark (14:49), Jesus is reported to have said at His arrest: "I was daily with you in the
temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled." In the Gospel of Luke
(24:27), Jesus is reported to have spoken of the prophecies of His own advent after His own
resurrection: "And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the
scriptures the things concerning himself...And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake
unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of
Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me." In the Gospel of John (1:45) it is
written: "We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of

Nazareth, the son of Joseph." Inasmuch as none of the Gospel authors have preserved any of
references made by Jesus to specific prophecies "in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the
psalms" we can only guess. In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus tells a story about a conversation between a
rich man in hell and Abraham in heaven, in which the rich man asks Abraham to send a special
messenger to his five brethren; Jesus continues (16:29-31): "Abraham saith unto him, They have
Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went
unto them from the dead, they will repent. And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the
prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead." This refers as much to
prophecies as to laws, for it indicates that the counsel of God is sufficient, in any age, to guide souls
to holy conduct--if they will only listen, and obey. In the Gospel of John (5:39,45-47), Jesus refers in
general fashion to His fulfillment of prophecies in the Hebrew Scriptures: "Search the scriptures; for
in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me...Do not think that I will
accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. For had ye
believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not his writings,
how shall ye believe my words?" In IV.(xx) we will consider where in the Torah, the books of Moses,
reference is made to Jesus the Messiah.

As for the specific prophecies He is reported to have cited in support of His own claims, we will
consider them in the order of their appearance in the Gospels, beginning with the Gospel of
Matthew.

(1)First, in the Gospel of Matthew (16:21, 17:22-23, 20:18-19), Jesus said that He must fulfill certain
conditions, including his persecution by the Jewish elders, his martyrdom, and his resurrection after
three days. This same is found in the Gospel of Mark (8:31; 9:12; 9:31; 10:33-34; 15:1,16); Luke
(9:22,44; 17:25; 18:31-33; 23:1; 24:6,7); John (18:28). It is not clear in the text of any of these
Gospels whether or not these conditions were spelled out in the Hebrew Scriptures, whether they
were found in some other traditional source, or whether they were simply conditions which He
spoke of in connection with His ministry, prophecies of His own fate rather than fulfillments of the
prophecies of earlier Prophets. In the Gospel of Matthew (12:38), Jesus is asked to give a "sign" of
His station. He replies (12:39-40) making reference to His resurrection after three days, and
comparing it to the three days and nights which the prophet Jonas (Jonah 1:17) spent "in the bowels
of the fish". Later in the same Gospel (16:4), Jesus refers to the same "sign". After His death,
according to the Gospel of Matthew (27:63), a group of priests and Pharisees, recalling Jesus'
prophecy that He would rise after the third day of His entombment, asked that His tomb be sealed
and that a guard be posted (27:64), and Pilate did as they requested (27:65-66). In the Gospel of
Luke (11:29-32), Jesus states that "This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign
be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet." However, in in this case, "the sign of Jonas" seems to
have an entirely different significance. He says (11:30) that "as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites,

so shall also the Son of man be to this generation." It was not anything that Jonas did which was a
sign, as in the Gospel of Matthew, but rather Jonas himself is a sign of God to the Ninevites.
Consequently (11:32), "The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and
shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is
here."

(2)Second, in the Gospel of Matthew (11:3-6), two of the disciples of John encounter Jesus and ask
Him "Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?" (11:3) To this question Jesus
replied "Go and show John again those things which ye do hear and see: The blind receive their
sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the
poor have the gospel preached to them. And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me."
(11:4-6) Jesus knew that John would recognize His Messianic station from these signs. Would John
recognize this by his knowledge of prophecy, or by his divinely-endowed direct knowledge? There
were Scriptural prophecies which these actions would have fulfilled: a)"the blind shall receive their
sight" fulfills Isaiah (29:18; 35:5); b)"the lame walk" fulfills Isaiah (35:6); c)"the lepers are cleansed"
does not seem to have been specifically predicted by any prophet--however, Moses (Num 12:13-14)
and Elijah (2 Kings 5:8-14) ask the Lord to effect the miraculous cure of leprosy, and, in both cases,
cures are effected; d)"the deaf hear" fulfill Isaiah (29:18; 35:5); e)"the dead are raised up" was also
not predicted by any prophet, but Elijah (1 Kings 17:21-22) prayed to the Lord to revive a widow's
son and her son was brought back to life; and contact with Elisha's bones, after this prophet had
died, caused a man to be resurrected from the dead (2 Kings 13:21)--hence, this is one of the signs of
the Prophet of God; f)"the poor have the gospel preached to them" fulfills Isaiah (61:1). g)"Blessed is
he, whosoever shall not be offended in me" recalls Isaiah (8:14-15), for it alludes to the fact that "he
shall be for a sanctuary"--hence, "blessed is he"--"but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of
offence to both the houses of Israel" and hence "many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be
broken, and be snared, and be taken" which is fulfilled by the reception of Jesus by the Jewish people
of Palestine, and His comment in the Gospel of Matthew that "for many be called, but few chosen"
(20:16) and "many are called, but few are chosen" (22:14). This same anecdote is reported in the
Gospel of Luke (7:19-23), where it is indicated that John actually sent these two disciples to Jesus, as
his emissaries. The author of this Gospel also follows this story (7:26-27) with that reported here in
IV.(3).

(3)Third, while John may well have been acquainted, as were many other Jews of his time and of all
times, with the Scriptural verses which must be fulfilled by the promised Messiah, even more
significant is Jesus' statement regarding the station of John (11:9-10; also Luke 7:26-27): "But what
went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet. For this is he, of
whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before
thee." It is evident that Jesus is quoting Malachi (3:1): "Behold, I will send my messenger, and he

shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple,
even the messenger of the covenant; behold, he shall come, said the Lord of hosts." In identifying
John as "my messenger" and that "he shall prepare the way before me" Jesus is also clearly
indicating that He is "the Lord, whom ye seek" and that He is also "the messenger of the covenant".
In the Gospel of Mark (1:2) we find this same citation from the prophet Malachi (3:1), "As it is
written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way
before thee" followed by a citation from the prophet Isaiah (40:3). In the Gospel of Luke (1:17), an
angel announced to Zacharias the birth of his son John, indicating that he is "to make ready a
people prepared for the Lord"; this may be a reference to this same verse of the prophet Malachi. It
may refer also to the verse of the prophet Isaiah (40:3). These citations are further discussed in V.(6),
inasmuch as they are related by Gospel authors but not attributed to Jesus.

(4)Fourth, in the Gospel of Matthew (11:14), Jesus describes John in another manner, explaining
"And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come." In a later chapter of the same Gospel
(17:11-12), Jesus says "Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things. But I say unto you, That
Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whasoever they listed." In
the Gospel of Mark (9:11-13), we find the same story, but only in the Gospel of Matthew (17:13)
does the author report that "Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the
Baptist." In the Gospel of Luke (1:17), it is not Jesus but an angel speaking to Zacharias and
announcing the birth of his son John, who says "he shall go before him in the spirit and power of
Elias..." As in the citation regarding the "messenger" who must precede the "Lord," these references
point to a prophetic verse in the book of the prophet Malachi (4:5): "Behold, I will send you Elijah
the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord." In the Gospel of
Matthew, Jesus punctuates this claim with these words (11:15), "He hath ears to hear, let him hear"
which recalls Isaiah (29:18; 35:5). Hence, Jesus also alludes to His advent signaling "the great and
dreadful day of the Lord".

(5)Fifth, Jesus indicates that the spiritual blindness and deafness of most of His generation is in
fulfillment of Isaiah (6:9; recalling other verses cited above), indicating that "this people's heart is
waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed" (13:13-15).

(6)Sixth, Jesus calls the scribes and Pharisees "hypocrites" and says "well did Esaias prophesy of you,
saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but
their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men." (15:7-9) We find the same statement of Jesus in the Gospel of Mark (7:6-6-
7). In doing so, Jesus is citing Isaiah (29:13-14), which reads as follows: "Forasmuch as this people
draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far
from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men: Therefore, behold, I will

proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder: for the
wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid."

(7)Seventh, Jesus cites a prophecy when confronted by angry priests and scribes in the Temple, who
disapproved of His favoring children, the blind and the lame (21:14-15): "have ye never read, Out of
the mouth of Bábes and sucklings thou has perfected praise?" This may be a citation from Psalms
(8:2): "Out of the mouth of Bábes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine
enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger." However, it may represent another
text which has yet to be identified.

(8)Eighth, Jesus says to the priests and elders in the Temple, "Did ye never read in the scriptures,
The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's
doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?" (21:42) This same citation is attributed to Jesus in the
Gospel of Mark (12:10-11), and the Gospel of Luke (20:17). The citation is a direct and exact quote
from Psalms (118:22-23): "The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the
corner. This is the Lord's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes."

(9)Ninth, Jesus asks the Pharisees whose son the Messiah is, to which they answer that Messiah is the
son of David; to which He asks why, if Messiah is his son, David refers to Messiah as "Lord" (22:41),
citing from Psalms (110:1): "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make
thine enemies thy footstool." This same citation is noted in the Gospel of Mark (12:35-37). While
many among the Jewish populace, according to the testimony of the Gospels, have identified Jesus
as the son of David, He does not seem to have payed much attention to this designation. There were
many prophecies which He fulfilled which had nothing to do with the promised Messiah son of
David.

(10)Tenth, at the last supper, on the first day of Passover, Jesus said "The Son of man goeth as it is
written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for
that man if he had not been born." (26:24) An almost identical story is found in the Gospel of Mark
(14:21) and the Gospel of Luke (22:22). In the first part of this statement, Jesus makes reference to a
prophecy. This may be a reference to that prophecy which has been described in III.(1). The
entirety of the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah seems to be fulfilled by Jesus, and He may have been
making reference to this chapter here. However, there is another prophecy which is much more
specific, in the book of the prophet Daniel. Daniel writes (9:25-26): "Know therefore and
understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto
the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built
again, and the wall, even in troublous times. And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be
cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the

sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are
determined. And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the
week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of
abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be
poured upon the desolate." Many commentators indicate that these verses predict the time of the
advent, and the time of the martyrdom of the Messiah, as well as the ceasing of the sacrifice and the
oblation at the Temple, and the abomination and desolation of the Temple. According to this
prophecy, the Messiah was to be cut off (killed), then another people was to destroy the city and
sanctuary of Jerusalem, and the end of the war was to be desolation. Jesus was martyred c. 33 C.E.,
the Roman legions destroyed the city and sanctuary of Jerusalem c. 70 C.E., and at the end of its
war with the Jewish Zealots, thousands of Judaeans, Galileans and other Israelites had been killed,
villages destroyed, a nation uprooted. When Jews in the diaspora rebelled against the Roman
government c. 115-117 C.E., they were ruthlessly suppressed, in Cyprus and Egypt. Shim'on bar
Kochba led another revolt, in c. 132-135 C.E., and once more the Jewish forces were vanquished by
the Roman legions. This time, the Emperor Hadrian rebuilt Jerusalem as a pagan city, prohibited
Jews from coming near this new city, forbade circumcision, the observance of the Sabbath, the
meeting of the elders, and study and teaching of the Torah. A more literal fulfillment of the
prophetic verses of Daniel is hard to imagine.

(11)Eleventh, at the last supper Jesus cited another prophecy, "All ye shall be offended because of me
this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered
abroad." (26:31) This same verse is found in the Gospel of Mark (14:27). This is a clear reference to
Zechariah (13:7): "Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow,
saith the Lord of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine
hand upon the little ones. And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the Lord, two parts
therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein." This seems to apply to the
immediate followers of Jesus--that after His martyrdom, two thirds would fall away, and only one
third would remain firm in their faith. When Peter states that he will never backslide (26:33,35),
Jesus assures Peter that he will deny his Lord three times on that very night, before the cock crows at
daybreak (26:34); and this prophecy is fulfilled (26:69-75), demonstrating that no one knows what his
own end will be, no one but God and whomsoever He informs.

(12)Twelfth, when arrested, Jesus orders one of His disciples, who has taken up a sword to protect
Him, to cease and desist (26:51-53), indicating that He can call down divine protection, "But how
then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?" This seems to be a reference to the
prophecies in the books of Isaiah and Daniel, cited earlier.

(13)Thirteenth, in the Gospel of Luke (4:17-21), it is reported that Jesus entered a synagogue, read a
passage from the book of Isaiah, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me
to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance
to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, To preach
the acceptable year of the Lord" (4:18-19) and that He then stated to the assembled, "This day is this
scripture fulfilled in your ears." The passage cited is indeed from the book of Isaiah (61:1-2): "The
Spirit of the Lord is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the
meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the
opening of the prison to them that are bound; To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the
day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn". The expression "acceptable year of the
Lord" refers to the jubilee year, the fiftieth year, described in the book of Leviticus (25:10-15), which
proclaims "liberty throughout all the land" (Lev 25:10). In the book of Jeremiah reference is made to
"a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them" (34:8)
which is related to the "covenant" which the Lord made "with your fathers in the day that I brought
them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage" (34:13), which "covenant" this
generation renewed "before me in the house which is called by my name" (34:15) but which was
violated, when they "caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set
at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection..." Hence, this "covenant" of
the jubilee year was renewed by the prophet Jeremiah. The "day of the vengeance of our God" is
also found in two other chapters and verses of the book of Isaiah (34:8): "For it is the day of the
Lord's vengeance, and the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion"; and (63:4): "For the
day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come." This "day" is also called
"the great and dreadful day of the Lord" (Malachi 4:5); "the great and terrible day of the Lord" (Joel
2:31); "the day of the Lord" (Amos 5:18; Obadiah 15; Zechariah 14:1); "the great day of the Lord"
(Zephaniah 1:14); "the day of the Lord's wrath" (Zephaniah 1:18); "the day of the Lord's anger"
(Zephaniah 2:2).

(14)Fourteenth, in the Gospel of Luke (10:1), it is reported that Jesus appointed seventy apostles, and
that they returned to Him, saying (10:17), "Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy
name." Jesus replied to them with what seems to be a verse from the Hebrew Scriptures (10:18): "I
beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven." He then continued, saying (10:19), "Behold, I give unto
you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing
shall by any means hurt you." This seems to be a reference to Isaiah (14:12): "How art thou fallen
from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst
weaken the nations!" In the book of Isaiah, this is addressed to "the king of Bábylon" (14:4), and it
continues as follows (14:13-15): "For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will
exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the
sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. Yet thou

shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit." If Jesus refers to this verse, then it seems that
He points to worldly powers rather than supernatural spirits. If He does not refer to this verse, then
it is not found among the canonical Hebrew Scriptures. In the Gospel of John, "the prince of this
world" (12:31; 16:11) may be the same as "Satan" in the Gospel of Luke. In the Gospel of John,
"now shall the prince of this world be cast out" (12:31), and "the prince of this world is judged"
(16:11).

(15)Fifteenth, in the Gospel of Luke (12:49-50), Jesus states the purpose of His coming: "I am come
to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled? but I have a baptism to be
baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!" He seems to be referring to His
fulfillment of the prophecies of John, His predecessor, discussed in III.(1). But, as we have noted
earlier, the prophecies of John seem to have referred to signs of the Messianic advent in the Hebrew
Scriptures. Please refer to III.(1) for the specific references in those Scriptures. Jesus continues
(12:51-52) with: "Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather
division: For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two
against three. The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother
against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter
in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law." This most likely refers to the book of the
prophet Micah (7:6): "For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her
mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies are the men of his own
house." That Jesus taught His disciples that His message would inevitably cause division is reported
also in the Gospel of Matthew (10:21,35) and the Gospel of Luke (21:16). In the Gospel of John
(7:43; 9:16; 10:19), three instances are reported, in which it is said that Jesus caused division among
His associates. Many other divisive incidents could be found in the Gospels.

(16)Sixteenth, in the Gospel of Luke (18:31), Jesus said to the twelve disciples: "Behold, we go up to
Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be
accomplished." There are many prophecies in the Hebrew Scriptures to which He must have been
making reference here. Among them are, perhaps, those found in the twenty-second Psalm, and the
fifty-third chapter of the book of Isaiah.

(17)Seventeenth, as we have read earlier, in the Gospel of John (5:46) Jesus says: "For had ye
believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me." Where in the Torah is there a
verse which could have been fulfilled by Jesus? It appears that this verse is found in the Book of
Deuteronomy:

"The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like
unto me; unto him ye shall hearken…"I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren,

like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall
command him.

"And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak
in my name, I will require it of him. "But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in
my name, which I have not command him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other
gods, even that prophet shall die. "And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word
which the Lord hath not spoken? "When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing
follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet
hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him." (Deuteronomy 18:15,18-22)

PROPHECIES CITED BY THE AUTHORS OF THE GOSPELS

We will now turn, in the second place, to the prophecies cited by the authors of the Gospels to have
been fulfilled by Jesus. Sometimes the authors cite their sources, sometimes not; usually they quote
the versions of the verses which are available to them, but sometimes they make allusion to such
verses, and seem to assume that their readers are familiar with the appropriate citations.

(1)First, the author refers to the miraculous birth of Jesus (1:22-23), "that it might be fulfilled which
was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring
forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us." This
is a verse from the book of Isaiah (7:14): "Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall
call his name Immanuel." Just preceding this are verses which this being a sign of the Lord to the
house of David (7:13-14): "Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men,
but will ye weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign..." It seems likely, in
the textual context of this citation, that the author regards this verse as predicting the advent of
Jesus, "God with us," and also as predicting His miraculous birth from a virgin mother.

(2)Second, a verse is cited by this author (2:5-6) which is stated to have been "written by the
prophet" but the prophet is not named, and the citation has not been identified by editors and
translators; it pertains to the place of Jesus' birth: "And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not
the least among the princes, of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people
Israel." Inasmuch as this verse has not been discovered either in the Hebrew Masoretic text or in the
Greek Septuagint text, it seems likely that the author of this Gospel had access to a text which
preserved a prophetic statement lost to posterity.

(3)Third, the next citation (2:15) pertains to the sojourn of Jesus and His parents in Egypt, "that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called

my son." This is clearly a citation from Hosea (11:1): "When Israel was a child, then I loved him,
and called my son out of Egypt." In the context of the verses which follow this, it is clear that Hosea
was refering to the children of Israel as a whole, not to a specific son of God who called called out of
Egypt.

(4)Fourth, the author then writes (2:17-18) that Herod's order to kill the newborn boys in Bethlehem
fulfilled "that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, In Rama was there a voice heard,
lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be
comforted, because they are not." This verse in Jeremiah (31:15) indicates that the children of Israel
are mourning, while the Lord calls them to (31:16,17) "Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine
eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord...there is hope in thine end, saith the
Lord, that thy children shall come again to their own border." It seems then that Rachel is not
bemoaning the killing of her children, but their exile from the land of Israel; and that the Lord
promises her that her children will return from their exile.

(5)Fifth, this author claims (2:23) that Jesus dwelt in Nazareth, "that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene." The verses which the editors have cited
(Judges 13:5; 1 Sam 1:11) refer to Samson the Nazirite, and not to a Nazarene. Inasmuch as the
Hebrew for Nazarene is "Notsri"--which is proBábly from the root "netser" (sprout)--this may be a
reference to a verse from Isaiah (11:1): "And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse,
and a Branch [netser] shall grow out [yifreh] of his roots [misharashaiv]"; however, this verse makes
not reference to a resident of the town named Nazareth [Natsereth]. Perhaps this prophecy is also
missing in the Masoretic and Septuagint texts.

(6)Sixth, the author cites a prophecy fulfilled by John, and in so doing he points to its fulfillment also
by Jesus. Speaking of John (3:3, "For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The
voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight." This
is Isaiah (40:3): "The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
make straight in the desert a highway for our God." For even as John was to prepare "the way of the
Lord" so also Jesus was, according to His own indications, the "Lord" whose way was being
prepared by John. This same verse is cited in the Gospel of Mark (1:3), the Gospel of Luke (3:4-6),
and the Gospel of John (1:23). Also, there seems to be a reference to this verse in the promise of the
angel to Zacharias, that his son John will "make ready a people prepared for the Lord" (Gospel of
Luke 1:17).

(7)Seventh, in the Gospel of Matthew (4:6), and in the Gospel of Luke (4:9-11), the author reports
that Satan quoted Scripture, "If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall
give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time

thou dash thy foot against a stone." This is a citation from the Psalms (91:11-12): "For he shall give
his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest
thou dash thy foot against a stone."

(8)Eighth, the travels of Jesus in Israel are regarded (4:14-16) as prophesied in Isaiah (9:1,2). The
portion of Isaiah cited--"The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphthalim, by the way of the sea,
beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles; The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to
them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up"--seems to fit Jesus; but when
we include the verses immediately preceding and following this citation (Isaiah 9:1-4), it seems to
have an entirely different meaning: "Nevertheless, the dimness shall not be such as was in her
vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and
afterward did he more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the
nations. The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the
shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not
increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they
divide the spoil. For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of
his oppressor, as in the day of Midian."

(8)Eighth, Jesus "cast out devils with his word, and healed all that were sick: That it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our
sicknesses." (8:16-17) In Isaiah (53:4) this verse reads "Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried
our sorrows: yet we did not esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted." This makes no
mention of healing sicknesses or casting out demons. Indeed, this portrait seems to be generalized to
all the Prophets of God. Furthermore, rather than identifying Jesus with the "Branch" or "shoot"
[netzer] (Isaiah 11:1, cited earlier), this verse would associate Him with "root" [shoresh], inasmuch
as the second verse of the same chapter (53:2), refering to the same person, states "he shall grow up
before him as a tender plant, and as a root [vekashoresh] out of a dry ground" making it the less
likely that this prophecy relates specifically to Jesus.

(9)Ninth, according to the author of this Gospel, Jesus asked those who received His teachings and
His healing not to make this public (12:17-21), "that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias
the prophet, saying, Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well
pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not
strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets. A bruised reed shall he not break,
and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory. And in his name
shall the Gentiles trust." This citation is from book of Isaiah (Isaiah 42:1-4). Beginning with the third
verse (42:3-7), we cite the following passage, which will give an expanded context to the citation
found in the Gospel: "A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench:

he shall bring forth judgment unto truth. He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set
judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law. Thus saith God the Lord, he that created
the heavens, and stretched them out: he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it;
he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein: I the Lord have
called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a
covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners
from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house." It was evident to the author
of the Gospel of Matthew, that Jesus fulfilled all of these verses. In the Gospel of Luke (2:32), Simeon
sees Jesus in the Temple and recognizes Him as "A light to lighten the Gentiles..." The phrase "a
light to lighten the Gentiles" is found in three separate verses of the book of Isaiah (42:6; 49:6; 60:3).
There is an allusion to the same theme in a fourth verse of the book of Isaiah (9:2), cited above, in
III.(7).

(10)Tenth, Jesus spoke in parables to the masses (13:35), "that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept
secret from the foundation of the world." It is not clear which Prophet the author is citing. The verse
which bears the greatest similarity to this citation is from Psalms (78:2): "I will open my mouth in
parable: I will utter dark sayings of old" which continues (78:4) "Which we have heard and known,
and our fathers have told us. We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation
to come the praises of the Lord, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done." This
next verse entirely contradicts the second half of the verse cited by the author.

(11)Eleventh, Jesus sent two of His disciples to fetch an ass and a colt (21:4-5), and "all this was done,
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, Tell ye the daughter of Sion,
Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass."
This appears to be a quotation from Zechariah (9:9), which reads: "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of
Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having
salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass." The context of this verse
in the ninth chapter of Zechariah seems to be appropriate for such a citation to apply to a Messianic
contender.

(12)Twelfth, Judas returned the thirty pieces of silver to the priests, and they purchased a potter's
field therewith. "Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they
took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel
did value; And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me." There is apparently no
such verse in the book of Jeremiah, but, in the book of Zechariah (11:12-13), we read: "And I said

unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price
thirty pieces of silver. And the Lord said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was
prised at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of
the Lord."

(13)Thirteenth, when Jesus is crucified, the Roman soldiers (27:35) "parted his garments, casting lots:
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them,
and upon my vesture did they cast lots." The same is recorded in the Gospel of John (19:23-24). The
citation is from Psalms (22:18): "They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my
vesture." It is not clear why the author of the Gospel of Matthew should have chosen this verse until
we come to his account of the last words of Jesus, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
(27:46). This is a direct quote from the first verse of the same Psalm (22:1): "Eli, Eli, lama
'azavTanii." In the Gospel of Mark (15:24) and the Gospel of Luke (23:34), the casting of lots for the
garments of Jesus is reported, but without either of these authors indicating that this action fulfilled a
specific prophecy. The Gospel of Mark (15:34) reports these as the final words of Jesus. However,
the Gospel of Luke (23:46) indicates that His last words were "Father, into thy hands I commend my
spirit" while the Gospel of John indicates that His last words were "It is finished" (19:30).

(14)Fourteenth, in the Gospel of Mark (15:27-28), it is alleged that Jesus was crucified with "two
thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. And the scripture was fulfilled, which
saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors." In the Gospel of Luke (22:37) we find a similar
citation, but in a completely different context. In both cases it seems to refer to the book of Isaiah
(53:12): "and he was numbered with the transgressors" which continues "and he bare the sin of
many, and made intercession for the transgressors."

(15)Fifteenth, in a number of cases (Gospel of Matthew 9:27; 15:22; 20:30-31; 21:9,15; Gospel of
Mark 11:47-48; Gospel of Luke 1:32; 2:4; 18:38,39), Jesus is called "son of David" and these seem to
be references to "Mashiakh ben David"--promised in the Hebrew Scriptures and in the Aramaic
Talmud. His lineage, through His adopted father, Joseph, back to King David, is depicted in the
Gospel of Matthew (1:1-17) and the Gospel of Luke (3:23-38). In the Gospel of Luke (1:32, 69), it is
reported that an angel promised Mary that her son would be given "the throne of his father David";
and that Zacharias, upon the birth of his son John, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied of
Jesus, calling him "an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David". Both are references
to Mashiakh ben David. Mashiakh ben David is mentioned in 2 Samuel 7:11; Psalms 132:11; Isaiah
9:6-7, 16:5; Jeremiah 23:5. In another context, in the Gospel of Matthew (22:42), Jesus asks a group
of Pharisees whose son the Messiah is, and they reply that the Messiah is the son of David; He then
cites a passage from the Psalms (110:1), and asks them why David calls the Messiah "Lord" if He is
his son (22:43-45). This is further discussed above, in III.(9).

(16)Sixteenth, in the Gospel of Luke (1:32-33), the angel who announces to Mary the birth of her
son Jesus states that "the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: And he shall
reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end." This statement
would have no meaning were it not in fulfillment of specific prophecies to be found in the Hebrew
Scriptures. Such prophecies may be found in the books of Daniel (2:44; 7:14,27), Obadiah (21), and
Micah (4:7). While they are not cited here either by name or by text, it is assumed that the reader is
familiar with these prophecies, and others of a similar character.

PRECEPT BY PRECEPT:
THE TEACHINGS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT

THE PREACHING OF JOHN

The preaching of John is described in all of the canonical Gospels: the Gospel of Matthew (3:1-14), the Gospel of
Mark (1:4-8), the Gospel of Luke (3:1-18), and the Gospel of John (1:15-35). We will examine each of His
precepts individually and as interpreted in Bahá’í texts. Both Bahá’u’llah and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refer to the preaching of
John the Baptist:

Moreover, in the heavenly Scriptures it is written: "John the Baptist was preaching in the wilderness
of Judea, and saying, Repent ye: for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand." By John is meant Yahya.98

John, son of Zacharias, said what My Forerunner hath said: "Saying, repent ye, for the Kingdom of
heaven is at hand…99

The principle of baptism is purification by repentance. John admonished and exhorted the people,
and caused them to repent; then he baptized them. Therefore, it is apparent that this baptism is a
symbol of repentance from all sin: its meaning is expressed in these words: "O God! as my body has
become purified and cleansed from physical impurities, in the same way purify and sanctify my
spirit from the impurities of the world of nature, which are not worthy of the Threshold of Thy
Unity!" Repentance is the return from disobedience to obedience. Man, after remoteness and
deprivation from God, repents and undergoes purification: and this is a symbol signifying "O God!
make my heart good and pure, freed and sanctified from all save Thy love."100

Reflect, also, that baptism in the days of John the Baptist was used to awaken and admonish the
people to repent from all sin, and to watch for the appearance of the Kingdom of Christ. But at
present in Asia, the Catholics and the Orthodox Church plunge newly born children into water
mixed with olive oil, and many of them become ill from the shock; at the time of baptism they
struggle and become agitated. In other places, the clergy sprinkle the water of baptism on the
forehead. But neither from the first form nor from the second do the children derive any spiritual
benefit. Then what result is obtained from this form? Other peoples are amazed and wonder why

98Bahá’u’lláh,Kitab-i-Iqan, pp. 64-65
99Bahá’u’lláh,Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 158
100‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, p. 91

the infant is plunged into the water, since this is neither the cause of the spiritual awakening of the
child, nor of its faith or conversion, but it is only a custom which is followed. In the time of John the
Baptist it was not so; no, at first John used to exhort the people, and to guide them to repentance
from sin, and to fill them with the desire to await the manifestation of Christ. Whoever received the
ablution of baptism, and repented of sins in absolute humility and meekness, would also purify and
cleanse his body from outward impurities. With perfect yearning, night and day, he would
constantly wait for the manifestation of Christ, and the entrance to the Kingdom of the Spirit of
God.101

The first words attributed to John in the canonical Gospels are cited here, in the order of their placement in the New
Testament:

3:1 In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, 3:2
And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. 3:3 For this is he that
was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the
wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 3:4 And the
same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and
his meat was locusts and wild honey. 3:5 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all
Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan, 3:6 And were baptized of him in
Jordan, confessing their sins. 3:7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and
Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath
warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 3:8 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for
repentance: 3:9 And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our
father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto
Abraham. 3:10 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every
tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. 3:11 I
indeed baptize you with water unto repentance. but he that cometh after me is
mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the
Holy Ghost, and with fire: 3:12 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge
his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with
unquenchable fire. 3:13 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be
baptized of him. 3:14 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of
thee, and comest thou to me? 3:15 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be
so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him. 3:16
And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the
heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove,

101‘Abdu’l-Bahá,   Some Answered Questions, pp. 94-95

and lighting upon him: 3:17 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased. (Gospel of Matthew)

1:4 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the
remission of sins. 1:5 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of
Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.
1:6 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his
loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; 1:7 And preached, saying, There
cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to
stoop down and unloose. 1:8 I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall
baptize you with the Holy Ghost. 1:9 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus
came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. 1:10 And
straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit
like a dove descending upon him: 1:11 And there came a voice from heaven, saying,
Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. (Gospel of Mark)

3:3 And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of
repentance for the remission of sins; 3:4 As it is written in the book of the words of
Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the
way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 3:5 Every valley shall be filled, and every
mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and
the rough ways shall be made smooth; 3:6 And all flesh shall see the salvation of
God. 3:7 Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O
generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 3:8 Bring
forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves,
We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones
to raise up children unto Abraham. 3:9 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of
the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and
cast into the fire. 3:10 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then? 3:11
He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him
that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise. 3:12 Then came also
publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do? 3:13 And he
said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you. 3:14 And the
soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto
them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your
wages. 3:15 And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts
of John, whether he were the Christ, or not; 3:16 John answered, saying unto them
all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of

whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
and with fire: 3:17 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor,
and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire
unquenchable. 3:18 And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the
people. 3:19 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother
Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done, 3:20 Added yet this above
all, that he shut up John in prison. 3:21 Now when all the people were baptized, it
came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,
3:22 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a
voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well
pleased. (Gospel of Luke)

1:4 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the
remission of sins. 1:5 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of
Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.
1:6 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his
loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; 1:7 And preached, saying, There
cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to
stoop down and unloose. 1:8 I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall
baptize you with the Holy Ghost. 1:9 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus
came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. 1:10 He was in
the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. 1:11 He
came unto his own, and his own received him not. 1:12 But as many as received him,
to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his
name: 1:13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will
of man, but of God. 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we
beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and
truth. 1:15 John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I
spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me. 1:16
And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. 1:17 For the law was
given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. 1:18 No man hath seen
God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath
declared him. 1:19 And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and
Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? 1:20 And he confessed, and denied
not; but confessed, I am not the Christ. 1:21 And they asked him, What then? Art
thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. 1:22
Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that
sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? 1:23 He said, I am the voice of one crying in the

wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias. 1:24 And
they which were sent were of the Pharisees. 1:25 And they asked him, and said unto
him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that
prophet? 1:26 John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth
one among you, whom ye know not; 1:27 He it is, who coming after me is preferred
before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose. 1:28 These things were
done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing. 1:29 The next day John
seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away
the sin of the world. 1:30 This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is
preferred before me: for he was before me. 1:31 And I knew him not: but that he
should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. 1:32
And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove,
and it abode upon him. 1:33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with
water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and
remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. 1:34 And I
saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God. 1:35 Again the next day after John
stood, and two of his disciples; 1:36 And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith,
Behold the Lamb of God! 1:37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they
followed Jesus. (Gospel of John)

In the Gospel of Matthew (3:3), and the Gospel of John (1:23), John the Baptist refers to Himself as
“he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias” and “as said the prophet Esaias”. This
correlation is reiterated as well in the Gospel of Mark (3:4-6). It refers to the following passage from
the Book of Isaiah [Esaias in Greek]:

40:1 Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. 40:2 Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem,
and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath
received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins. 40:3 The voice of him that crieth in the
wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway
for our God. 40:4 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low:
and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: 40:5 And the glory of the
LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken
it.

In Kitab-i-Iqan, referring to the principle that every Manifestation of God is heralded by a human being, and citing the
herald of Jesus:

Moreover, in the heavenly Scriptures it is written: "John the Baptist was preaching in the wilderness
of Judea, and saying, Repent ye: for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand."[Matthew 3:1-2] By John is
meant Yahya. (Bahá'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, pp. 64-65)

In the Lawh-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’llah refers to the Báb alluding to these verses from the Book of Isaiah and to the
fulfillment thereof by John the Baptist, whom He compares to His forerunner:

Say, did ye not hearken to the Voice of the Crier, calling aloud in the wilderness of the
Bayan, bearing unto you the glad-tidings of the coming of your Lord, the All-Merciful? Lo! He is
come in the sheltering shadow of Testimony, invested with conclusive proof and evidence, and those
who truly believe in Him regard His presence as the embodiment of the Kingdom of God. Blessed is
the man who turneth towards Him, and woe betide such as deny or doubt Him. (Bahá'u'llah,
Tablets of Bahá'u'llah, p. 12)

In the Tablet entitled Ishraqat He likewise alludes to these two texts:

Verily, the Crier hath cried out, when the promised time came, and they that have
recognized the splendours of Sinai have swooned away in the wilderness of
hesitation, before the awful majesty of thy Lord, the Lord of creation. (Bahá'u'llah, Tablets of
Bahá'u'llah, p. 118)

Bahá’u’llah refers to “wilderness” in two different ways—one to denote a place that is not settled and tamed and
domesticated by humans, and the other to refer to a state of human consciousness that is oblivious of the divine teachings
and which is consequently “lost” and “heedless”. In The Kitab-i-Iqan He refers to the first of these meanings, whilst in
the other citations He refers to the other meaning.

John the Baptist compares Himself to the one He heralds: he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am
not worthy to bear: (Matthew 3:11); There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not
worthy to stoop down and unloose. (Mark 1:7); I one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not
worthy to unloose: (Luke 3:16); There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy
to stoop down and unloose. (John 1:7)

Bahá’u’llah refers to the fulfillment of this prophecy in Epistle to the Son of the Wolf:

John, son of Zacharias, said what My Forerunner hath said: "Saying, repent ye, for the Kingdom of
heaven is at hand. I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He that cometh after Me is
mightier than I, Whose shoes I am not worthy to bear." Wherefore, hath My Forerunner, as a sign
of submissiveness and humility, said: "The whole of the Bayan is only a leaf amongst the leaves of
His Paradise." And likewise, He saith: "I am the first to adore Him, and pride Myself on My kinship

with Him." And yet, O men, the people of the Bayan102 have acted in such a manner that Dhi'l-
Jawshan103, and Ibn-i-Anas104, and Asbahi105have sought and still seek refuge with God against such
deeds. This Wronged One hath, in the face of all religions, busied Himself day and night with the
things that are conducive unto the exaltation of the Cause of God, whereas those men have clung
unto that which is the cause of humiliation and injury.106

In the Gospel of John (3:25-36), John speaks more freely about the theological significance of His successor:

3:25 Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.
3:26 And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to
whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him. 3:27 John
answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven. 3:28
Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent
before him. 3:29 He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the
bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the
bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled. 3:30 He must increase, but I
must decrease. 3:31 He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is
earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all. 3:32 And
what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.
3:33 He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true. 3:34 For
he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by
measure unto him. 3:35 The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his
hand. 3:36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not
the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.

Bahá’u’llah expresses the same principle—“He must increase, but I must decrease”--citing the words of the Báb:

And likewise, He saith: "Suffer not yourselves to be shut out as by a veil from God after He hath
revealed Himself. For all that hath been exalted in the Bayan is but as a ring upon My hand, and I
Myself am, verily, but a ring upon the hand of Him Whom God shall make manifest -- glorified be
102Bahá’u’lláh  is referring here to the followers of Mirza Yahya, instigated by Siyyid Muhammad Isfahani,
who opposed Him when He made His claim to be “Him Whom God shall make manifest”, the Promised
One of the Bab.

pleaseth. He, verily, is the Help in Peril, the Most High."107

Whereas John baptizes with water—I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance (Matthew 3:11); I indeed have
baptized you with water: (Mark 1:8); I indeed baptize you with water (Luke 3:16); I indeed have baptized you with
water: (John 1:8)—the one He heralds will baptize with the spirit of God: I indeed baptize you with water unto
repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you
with the Holy Ghost (Matthew 3:11; Mark 1:7-8; Luke 3:16), and with fire: Whose fan is in his hand, and he will
thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
(Matthew 3:11-12; Luke 3:17)

These are prophetic verses, and one might wonder if they have a precursor in the Tanakh. Here are the closest
equivalents, all from the Book of Isaiah:

5:24 Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root
shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of
the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.

33:10 Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself. 33:11 Ye shall
conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, as fire, shall devour you. 33:12 And the
people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire. 33:13 Hear,
ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might. 33:14 The
sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with
the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?

47:13 Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the
monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee. 47:14
Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the
power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.

66:15 For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render
his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. 66:16 For by fire and by his sword will the
LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.

John the Baptist identifies Jesus as the one who will baptize with the Spirit (Holy Ghost) in the Gospel of John:

\[107\] Bahá’u’lláh, Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, pp. 154-155

1:33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto
me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the
same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. (Gospel of John)

Jesus points to this prophecy in one of His discourses found in the Gospel of Luke:

12:49 I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?
12:50 But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be
accomplished! 12:51 Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but
rather division: 12:52 For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against
two, and two against three. 12:53 The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the
father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law
against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. (Gospel of Luke)

In the Gospel of John (3:5), Jesus speaks about the baptism of fire and spirit:

3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the
Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 3:6 That which is born of the flesh is
flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. 3:7 Marvel not that I said unto
thee, Ye must be born again. 3:8 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest
the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is
every one that is born of the Spirit.

He speaks of the baptism of John and refers to His own baptism briefly in a discourse reported in all three synoptic
Gospels:

21:25 The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned
with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then
believe him? 21:26 But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.
21:27 And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you
by what authority I do these things. (Gospel of Matthew)

11:30 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me. 11:31 And they
reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not
believe him? 11:32 But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John,
that he was a prophet indeed. 11:33 And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And
Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things. (Gospel of
Mark)

20:4 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? 20:5 And they reasoned with
themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not? 20:6
But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a
prophet. 20:7 And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was. 20:8 And Jesus said unto
them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. (Gospel of Luke)

Jesus refers pointedly to His own baptism, and to the baptism He gives to those who follow Him in another
conversation reported by two of the synoptic Gospels:

20:20 Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and
desiring a certain thing of him. 20:21 And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him,
Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy
kingdom. 20:22 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink
of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am
baptized with? They say unto him, We are able. 20:23 And he saith unto them, Ye shall
drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with:
but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to
them for whom it is prepared of my Father. 20:24 And when the ten heard it, they were
moved with indignation against the two brethren. 20:25 But Jesus called them unto him, and said,
Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great
exercise authority upon them. 20:26 But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great
among you, let him be your minister; 20:27 And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be
your servant: 20:28 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to
give his life a ransom for many. (Gospel of Matthew)

10:35 And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that
thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire. 10:36 And he said unto them, What would ye
that I should do for you? 10:37 They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right
hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory. 10:38 But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not
what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the
baptism that I am baptized with? 10:39 And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto
them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am
baptized withal shall ye be baptized: 10:40 But to sit on my right hand and on my left
hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared. 10:41
And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John. 10:42 But Jesus
called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the
Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them. 10:43 But
so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: 10:44

And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all. 10:45 For even the Son of man
came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. (Gospel of
Mark)

Bahá’u’llah confirms the water baptism of John and the baptism by fire and the Holy Spirit of Jesus:

Give ear unto that which the Dove of Eternity warbleth upon the twigs of the Divine Lote-Tree: O
peoples of the earth! We sent forth him who was named John to baptize you with water,
that your bodies might be cleansed for the appearance of the Messiah. He, in turn,
purified you with the fire of love and the water of the spirit in anticipation of these
Days whereon the All-Merciful hath purposed to cleanse you with the water of life at
the hands of His loving providence. This is the Father foretold by Isaiah, and the Comforter
concerning Whom the Spirit had covenanted with you. Open your eyes, O concourse of bishops,
that ye may behold your Lord seated upon the Throne of might and glory.108

‘Abdu’l-Bahá explained the meaning of baptism by fire and the Holy Spirit (Holy Ghost), and spiritual rebirth in a
number of Tablets and talks, including:

Today, all the peoples of the world are indulging in self-interest and exert the utmost effort and
endeavour to promote their own material interests. They are worshipping themselves and not the
divine reality, nor the world of mankind. They seek diligently their own benefit and not the common
weal. This is because they are captives of the world of nature and unaware of the divine teachings, of
the bounty of the Kingdom and of the Sun of Truth. But ye, praise be to God, are at present
especially favoured with this bounty, have become of the chosen, have been informed of the
heavenly instructions, have gained admittance into the Kingdom of God, have become the
recipients of unbounded blessings and have been baptized with the Water of Life, with the
fire of the love of God and with the Holy Spirit.109

Therefore, the believers of God throughout all the republics of America, through the divine power,
must become the cause of the promotion of heavenly teachings and the establishment of the oneness
of humanity. Every one of the important souls must arise, blowing over all parts of America the
breath of life, conferring upon the people a new spirit, baptizing them with the fire of the love of
God, the water of life, and the breaths of the Holy Spirit so that the second birth may become
realized. For it is written in the Gospel: "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that
which is born of the Spirit is spirit."[John 3:6.]110

\[108\] Bahá’u’lláh, Suriy-i-Haykal, in The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 63

\[109\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, pp. 103-104

\[110\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Tablets of the Divine Plan, pp. 103-104

Christ was not in need of baptism; but as at that time it was an acceptable and praiseworthy action,
and a sign of the glad tidings of the Kingdom, therefore, He confirmed it. However, afterward He
said the true baptism is not with material water, but it must be with spirit and with water. In this
case water does not signify material water, for elsewhere it is explicitly said baptism is with spirit and
with fire, from which it is clear that the reference is not to material fire and material water, for
baptism with fire is impossible.

Therefore, the spirit is the bounty of God, the water is knowledge and life, and the fire is the
love of God. For material water does not purify the heart of man; no, it cleanses his body. But the
heavenly water and spirit, which are knowledge and life, make the human heart good and pure; the
heart which receives a portion of the bounty of the Spirit becomes sanctified, good and pure -- that
is to say, the reality of man becomes purified and sanctified from the impurities of the world of
nature. These natural impurities are evil qualities: anger, lust, worldliness, pride, lying, hypocrisy,
fraud, self-love, etc.

Man cannot free himself from the rage of the carnal passions except by the help of the Holy
Spirit. That is why He says baptism with the spirit, with water and with fire is necessary,
and that it is essential -- that is to say, the spirit of divine bounty, the water of knowledge and life,
and the fire of the love of God. Man must be baptized with this spirit, this water and this
fire so as to become filled with the eternal bounty. Otherwise, what is the use of baptizing
with material water? No, this baptism with water was a symbol of repentance, and of seeking
forgiveness of sins.

But in the cycle of Bahá'u'lláh there is no longer need of this symbol; for its reality, which is
to be baptized with the spirit and love of God, is understood and established.111

The immortality of the spirit is mentioned in the Holy Books; it is the fundamental basis of the
divine religions. Now punishments and rewards are said to be of two kinds: first, the rewards and
punishments of this life; second, those of the other world. But the paradise and hell of existence are
found in all the worlds of God, whether in this world or in the spiritual heavenly worlds. Gaining
these rewards is the gaining of eternal life. That is why Christ said, "Act in such a way that you may
find eternal life, and that you may be born of water and the spirit, so that you may enter
into the Kingdom."[John 3:5]

The rewards of this life are the virtues and perfections which adorn the reality of man. For example,
he was dark and becomes luminous; he was ignorant and becomes wise; he was neglectful and
becomes vigilant; he was asleep and becomes awakened; he was dead and becomes living; he was

\[111\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, pp. 91-92

blind and becomes a seer; he was deaf and becomes a hearer; he was earthly and becomes heavenly;
he was material and becomes spiritual. Through these rewards he gains spiritual birth and becomes
a new creature. He becomes the manifestation of the verse in the Gospel where it is said of the
disciples that they "were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of
man, but of God" [John 1:13] -- that is to say, they were delivered from the animal characteristics
and qualities which are the characteristics of human nature, and they became qualified with the
divine characteristics, which are the bounty of God. This is the meaning of the second birth. For
such people there is no greater torture than being veiled from God, and no more severe punishment
than sensual vices, dark qualities, lowness of nature, engrossment in carnal desires. When they are
delivered through the light of faith from the darkness of these vices, and become illuminated with
the radiance of the sun of reality, and ennobled with all the virtues, they esteem this the greatest
reward, and they know it to be the true paradise. In the same way they consider that the spiritual
punishment -- that is to say, the torture and punishment of existence -- is to be subjected to the
world of nature; to be veiled from God; to be brutal and ignorant; to fall into carnal lusts; to be
absorbed in animal frailties; to be characterized with dark qualities, such as falsehood, tyranny,
cruelty, attachment to the affairs of the world, and being immersed in satanic ideas. For them, these
are the greatest punishments and tortures.112

The second birth of which Jesus has spoken refers to the appearance of this heavenly nature in man.
It is expressed in the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and he who is baptized by the Holy
Spirit is a veritable manifestation of divine mercy to mankind. Then he becomes just and
kind to all humanity; he entertains prejudice and ill will toward none; he shuns no nation or
people.113

There is, however, another Spirit, which may be termed the Divine, to which Jesus Christ refers
when He declares that man must be born of its quickening and baptized with its living fire. Souls
deprived of that Spirit are accounted as dead, though they are possessed of the human spirit. Jesus
Christ has pronounced them dead inasmuch as they have no portion of the Divine Spirit. He says,
"Let the dead bury their dead." [Matthew 8:22; Luke 9:60] In another instance He declares,
"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is
spirit." [John 3:6] By this He means that souls, though alive in the human kingdom, are
nevertheless dead if devoid of this particular spirit of divine quickening. They have not partaken of
the divine life of the higher Kingdom, for the soul which partakes of the power of the Divine Spirit
is, verily, living.

\[112\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Ibid., pp. 223-224

\[113\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 41

This quickening spirit emanates spontaneously from the Sun of Truth, from the reality of
Divinity, and is not a revelation or a manifestation. It is like the rays of the sun. The rays are
emanations from the sun. This does not mean that the sun has become divisible, that a part of the
sun has come out into space.114

You were asleep; you are awakened. Your ears are attentive; your hearts are informed. You have
acquired the love of God. You have attained to the knowledge of God. This is the most great
bestowal of God. This is the breath of the Holy Spirit, and this consists of faith and assurance. This
eternal life is the second birth; this is the baptism of the Holy Spirit.115

Every soul who believed in Jesus Christ became revivified and resuscitated through this spirit,
attained to the zenith of eternal glory, realized the everlasting life, experienced the second birth
and rose to the acme of good fortune.116

Therefore, I exhort you to be devoted to your spiritual development. Just as you have striven along
material lines and have attained to high degrees of worldly advancement, may you likewise become
strengthened and proficient in the knowledge of God. May divine susceptibilities be increased and
awakened; may your devotion to the heavenly Kingdom become intense. May you be the recipients
of the impulses of the Holy Spirit, be assisted in the world of morality and attain ideal power so that
the sublimity of the world of mankind may become apparent in you. Thus may you attain the
highest happiness, the eternal life, the everlasting glory, the second birth, and become
manifestations of the bestowals of God.117

By what means can man acquire these things? How shall he obtain these merciful gifts and powers?
First, through the knowledge of God. Second, through the love of God. Third, through faith.
Fourth, through philanthropic deeds. Fifth, through self-sacrifice. Sixth, through severance from this
world. Seventh, through sanctity and holiness. Unless he acquires these forces and attains to these
requirements, he will surely be deprived of the life that is eternal. But if he possesses the knowledge
of God, becomes ignited through the fire of the love of God, witnesses the great and mighty signs of
the Kingdom, becomes the cause of love among mankind and lives in the utmost state of sanctity
and holiness, he shall surely attain to second birth, be baptized by the Holy Spirit and
enjoy everlasting existence.118

The station of man is great, very great. God has created man after His own image and likeness. He
has endowed him with a mighty power which is capable of discovering the mysteries of phenomena.
Through its use man is able to arrive at ideal conclusions instead of being restricted to the mere
plane of sense impressions. As he possesses sense endowment in common with the animals, it is
evident that he is distinguished above them by his conscious power of penetrating abstract realities.
He acquires divine wisdom; he searches out the mysteries of creation; he witnesses the radiance of
omnipotence; he attains the second birth -- that is to say, he is born out of the material world just
as he is born of the mother; he attains to everlasting life; he draws nearer to God; his heart is replete
with the love of God. This is the foundation of the world of humanity; this is the image and likeness
of God; this is the reality of man; otherwise, he is an animal. Verily, God has created the animal in
the image and likeness of man, for though man outwardly is human, yet in nature he possesses
animal tendencies.119

In this century of the latter times Bahá'u'lláh has appeared and so resuscitated spirits that they have
manifested powers more than human. Thousands of His followers have given their lives; and while
under the sword, shedding their blood, they have proclaimed, "Ya Bahá'u'l-Abha!" Such
resuscitation is impossible except through a heavenly potency, a supernatural power, the divine
power of the Holy Spirit. Through a natural and mere human power this is impossible. Therefore,
the question arises: How is this resuscitation to be accomplished?

There are certain means for its accomplishment by which mankind is regenerated and
quickened with a new birth. This is the second birth mentioned in the heavenly Books.
Its accomplishment is through the baptism of the Holy Spirit.120

Children, for instance, no matter how good and pure, no matter how healthy their bodies, are,
nevertheless, considered imperfect because the power of intellect is not fully manifest in them. When
the intellectual power fully displays its influences and they attain to the age of maturity, they are
considered as perfect. Likewise, man, no matter how much he may advance in worldly affairs and
make progress in material civilization, is imperfect unless he is quickened by the bounties of the Holy
Spirit; for it is evident that until he receives that divine impetus he is ignorant and deprived. For this
reason Jesus Christ said, "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God." [John 3:5] By this Christ meant that unless man is released
from the material world, freed from the captivity of materialism and receiving a portion of the
bounties of the spiritual world, he shall be deprived of the bestowals and favors of the Kingdom of
God, and the utmost we can say of him is that he is a perfect animal. No one can rightly call him a
man. In another place He said, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is

\[119\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Ibid., pp. 262-263

\[120\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Ibid., p. 277

born of the Spirit is spirit." [John 3:6] The meaning of this is that if man is a captive of nature,
he is like unto an animal because he is only a body physically born -- that is, he belongs to the world
of matter and remains subject to the law and control of nature. But if he is baptized with the
Holy Spirit, if he is freed from the bondage of nature, released from animalistic tendencies and
advanced in the human realm, he is fitted to enter into the divine Kingdom. The world of the
Kingdom is the realm of divine bestowals and the bounties of God. It is attainment of the highest
virtues of humanity; it is nearness to God; it is capacity to receive the bounties of the ancient Lord.
When man advances to this station, he attains the second birth. Before his first or physical birth man
was in the world of the matrix. He had no knowledge of this world; his eyes could not see; his ears
could not hear. When he was born from the world of the matrix, he beheld another world. The sun
was shining with its splendors, the moon radiant in the heavens, the stars twinkling in the expansive
firmament, the seas surging, trees verdant and green, all kinds of creatures enjoying life here, infinite
bounties prepared for him. In the world of the matrix none of these things existed. In that world he
had no knowledge of this vast range of existence; nay, rather, he would have denied the reality of
this world. But after his birth he began to open his eyes and behold the wonders of this illimitable
universe. Similarly, as long as man is in the matrix of the human world, as long as he is the captive
of nature, he is out of touch and without knowledge of the universe of the Kingdom. If he attains
rebirth while in the world of nature, he will become informed of the divine world. He will observe
that another and a higher world exists. Wonderful bounties descend; eternal life awaits; everlasting
glory surrounds him. All the signs of reality and greatness are there. He will see the lights of God. All
these experiences will be his when he is born out of the world of nature into the divine world.
Therefore, for the perfect man there are two kinds of birth: the first, physical birth, is from the
matrix of the mother; the second, or spiritual birth, is from the world of nature. In both he is without
knowledge of the new world of existence he is entering. Therefore, rebirth means his release from
the captivity of nature, freedom from attachment to this mortal and material life. This is the
second, or spiritual, birth of which Jesus Christ spoke in the Gospels.121

It is clearly evident that while man possesses powers in common with the animal, he is distinguished
from the animal by intellectual attainment, spiritual perception, the acquisition of virtues, capacity
to receive the bestowals of Divinity, lordly bounty and emanations of heavenly mercy. This is the
adornment of man, his honor and sublimity. Humanity must strive toward this supreme station.
Christ has interpreted this station as the second birth. Man is first born from a world of darkness, the
matrix of the mother, into this physical world of light. In the dark world from whence he came he
had no knowledge of the virtues of this existence. He has been liberated from a condition of
darkness and brought into a new and spacious realm where there is sunlight, the stars are shining,
the moon sheds its radiance, there are beautiful views, gardens of roses, fruits and all the blessings of
the present world. How did he attain these blessings? Through the agency of birth from the mother.

\[121\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Ibid., pp. 303-305

Just as man has been physically born into this world, he may be reborn from the realm and matrix
of nature, for the realm of nature is a condition of animalism, darkness and defect. In this second
birth he attains the world of the Kingdom. There he witnesses and realizes that the world of nature
is a world of gloom, whereas the Kingdom is a world of radiance; the world of nature is a world of
defects, the Kingdom is a realm of perfection; the world of nature is a world without enlightenment,
the Kingdom of spiritual humanity is a heaven of illumination. Great discoveries and revelations are
now possible for him; he has attained the reality of perception; his circle of understanding is
illimitably widened; he views the realities of creation, comprehends the divine bounties and unseals
the mystery of phenomena. This is the station which Christ has interpreted as the second
birth. He says that just as ye were physically born from the mother into this world, ye must be born
again from the mother world of nature into the life of the divine Kingdom. May you all attain this
second, spiritual birth. "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of
the Spirit is spirit."[John 3:6] 122

In the Gospel according to St John, Christ has said: 'Except a man be born of water and the
Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.'[John 3:5] The priests have
interpreted this into meaning that baptism is necessary for salvation. In another Gospel it is said:
'He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire'.[Matthew 3:11]

Thus the water of baptism and the fire are one! It cannot mean that the 'water' spoken of is physical
water, for it is the direct opposite of 'fire', and one destroys the other. When in the Gospels, Christ
speaks of 'water', He means that which causes life, for without water no worldly creature can live --
mineral, vegetable, animal and man, one and all, depend upon water for their very being. Yes, the
latest scientific discoveries prove to us that even mineral has some form of life, and that it also needs
water for its existence.

Water is the cause of life, and when Christ speaks of water, He is symbolizing that which is the cause
of Everlasting Life.

This life-giving water of which He speaks is like unto fire, for it is none other than the Love of
God, and this love means life to our souls.

By the fire of the Love of God the veil is burnt which separates us from the Heavenly Realities,
and with clear vision we are enabled to struggle onward and upward, ever progressing in the
paths of virtue and holiness, and becoming the means of light to the world.

\[122\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Ibid., pp. 332-333

There is nothing greater or more blessed than the Love of God! It gives healing to the sick, balm
to the wounded, joy and consolation to the whole world, and through it alone can man attain
Life Everlasting. The essence of all religions is the Love of God, and it is the foundation of all the
sacred teachings.

It was the Love of God that led Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that strengthened Joseph in Egypt
and gave to Moses courage and patience.

Through the Love of God, Christ was sent into the world with His inspiring example of a perfect
life of self-sacrifice and devotion, bringing to men the message of Eternal Life. It was the Love of
God that gave Muhammad power to bring the Arabs from a state of animal degradation to a
loftier state of existence.

God's Love it was that sustained the Báb and brought him to his supreme sacrifice, and made his
bosom the willing target for a thousand bullets.

Finally, it was the Love of God that gave to the East Bahá'u'lláh, and is now sending the light of
His teaching far into the West, and from Pole to Pole.

Thus I exhort each of you, realizing its power and beauty, to sacrifice all your thoughts, words
and actions to bring the knowledge of the Love of God into every heart.123

"The bird is a captive in the air and the fish a captive in the sea. Man alone stands apart and says to
the elements, I will make you my servants! I can govern you! He takes electricity, and through his
ingenuity imprisons it and makes of it a wonderful power for lighting, and a means of
communication to a distance of thousands of miles. But man himself may become a captive to the
things he has invented. His true second birth occurs when he is freed from all material
things: for he only is free who is not a captive to his desires. He has then as Jesus has said,
become captive to the Holy Spirit."124

The call of the Kingdom is heard in your midst. Glory be to God, you have been born again,
you have been baptized by the fire of the Love of God; you have been plunged in the Sea of
Life and regenerated by the Spirit of Love!125

During the time Jesus Christ was upon the earth mankind sought nearness to God, but in that day
no one attained it save a very few -- His disciples. Those blessed souls were confirmed with divine
nearness through the love of God. Divine nearness is dependent upon attainment to the knowledge
of God, upon severance from all else save God. It is contingent upon self-sacrifice and to be found
only through forfeiting wealth and worldly possessions. It is made possible through the
baptism of water and fire revealed in the Gospels. Water symbolizes the water of life,
which is knowledge, and fire is the fire of the love of God; therefore, man must be baptized with the
water of life, the Holy Spirit and the fire of the love of the Kingdom. Until he attains these three
degrees, nearness to God is not possible. This is the process by which the Bahá'ís of Persia have
attained it. They gave their lives for this station, sacrificed honor, comfort and possessions, hastened
with the utmost joy to the place of martyrdom; their blood was spilled, their bodies were tortured
and destroyed, their homes pillaged, their children carried into captivity. They endured all these
conditions joyfully and willingly. Through such sacrifice nearness to God is made possible.126

John’s appellation for his countrymen of the generation in which He ministered—“generation of vipers”—
recalls the words of two Psalms:

58:1 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?
58:2 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth. 58:3 The
wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies. 58:4
Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;

140:1 Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man; 140:2 Which
imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war. 140:3 They have
sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips.

The “generation of vipers” is a generation of wicked, evil men and women, who “work wickedess…go astray
as soon as they are born, speaking lies…imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war”.
These are the persecutors of the prophets, the enemies of the anointed ones, who poison the innocents and lead them out of
the garden of paradise and into the desert of hardship and estrangement from God.

Jesus used the very same expression, as reported uniquely in the Gospel of Matthew, calling it “evil” and “adulterous”,
and calling it condemned by “the men of Nineveh” redeemed by Jonah and “the queen of the south” who beheld
Solomon, and “killers” of the prophets:

\[126\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 147

12:34 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the
abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. 12:35 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart
bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil
things. 12:36 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account
thereof in the day of judgment. 12:37 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words
thou shalt be condemned. 12:38 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying,
Master, we would see a sign from thee. 12:39 But he answered and said unto them, An evil and
adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of
the prophet Jonas: 12:40 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall
the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. 12:41 The men of
Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because
they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here. 12:42 The
queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall
condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon;
and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

23:29 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets,
and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, 23:30 And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers,
we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. 23:31 Wherefore ye be
witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. 23:32 Fill ye up
then the measure of your fathers. 23:33 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye
escape the damnation of hell? 23:34 Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise
men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall
ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city: 23:35 That upon
you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto
the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. 23:36
Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation. 23:37 O Jerusalem,
Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee,
how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under
her wings, and ye would not! 23:38 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.

Bahá’u’llah likewise refers to the inhabitants of the Holy Land as “a generation of vipers”:

This Holy Land hath been mentioned and extolled in all the sacred Scriptures. In it have appeared
the Prophets of God and His chosen Ones. This is the wilderness in which all the Messengers of
God have wandered, from which their cry, "Here am I, here am I, O my God" was raised. This is
the promised Land in which He Who is the Revelation of God was destined to be made manifest.
This is the Vale of God's unsearchable decree, the snow-white Spot, the Land of unfading splendor.

Whatever hath come to pass in this Day hath been foretold in the Scriptures of old. These same
Scriptures, however, unanimously condemn the people that inhabit this land. They have, at one
time, been stigmatized as the "generation of vipers." Behold how this wronged One is now,
whilst surrounded by a "generation of vipers," calling aloud and summoning all men to Him
Who is the world's Ultimate Desire, the Summit and Day Spring of Glory. Happy is the man that
hath hearkened to the voice of Him Who is the Lord of the Kingdom of Utterance, and woe betide
the heedless, they that have strayed far from His truth.127

'Akká, the ancient Ptolemais, the St. Jean d'Acre of the Crusaders, that had successfully defied the
siege of Napoleon, had sunk, under the Turks, to the level of a penal colony to which murderers,
highway robbers and political agitators were consigned from all parts of the Turkish empire. It was
girt about by a double system of ramparts; was inhabited by a people whom Bahá'u'lláh stigmatized
as "the generation of vipers"; was devoid of any source of water within its gates; was flea-
infested, damp and honey-combed with gloomy, filthy and tortuous lanes. "According to what they
say," the Supreme Pen has recorded in the Lawh-i-Sultán, "it is the most desolate of the cities of the
world, the most unsightly of them in appearance, the most detestable in climate, and the foulest in
water. It is as though it were the metropolis of the owl." So putrid was its air that, according to a
proverb, a bird when flying over it would drop dead.128

And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then? He answered and saith
unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none [Matt
25:36]; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise [Matt 25:35]. Then came also
publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall be do? And he said
unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you. And the soldiers
likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do
violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages."
(Luke 3:10-14) And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the
people. (Luke 3:18)

There is no commentary on these verses in the Bahá’í source texts, but they recall this statement:

If thine eyes be turned towards mercy, forsake the things that profit thee and cleave unto that which
will profit mankind. And if thine eyes be turned towards justice, choose thou for thy neighbour that
which thou choosest for thyself.129

129Bahá’u’lláh, Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 64

The teachings of John the Baptist exemplify justice…they are fair, they are balanced, they are moderate, they represent a
sharing of one’s resources with others. The teachings of Jesus perfectly embody mercy…they are self-sacrificing, they are
uncompromising, they are unilateral, and they represent a bestowal of one’s all upon those, each according to his needs:

5:38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: 5:39 But I say
unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the
other also. 5:40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy
cloak also. 5:41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. 5:42 Give to him
that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. 5:43 Ye have heard
that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. 5:44 But I say unto
you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for
them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; 5:45 That ye may be the children of your
Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth
rain on the just and on the unjust. 5:46 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do
not even the publicans the same? 5:47 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than
others? do not even the publicans so? 5:48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
heaven is perfect.

25:31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he
sit upon the throne of his glory: 25:32 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall
separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: 25:33 And he
shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. 25:34 Then shall the King say unto
them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from
the foundation of the world: 25:35 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye
gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: 25:36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and
ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. 25:37 Then shall the righteous answer him,
saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? 25:38
When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? 25:39 Or when saw we
thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? 25:40 And the King shall answer and say unto them,
Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye
have done it unto me. 25:41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye
cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: 25:42 For I was an hungred, and
ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: 25:43 I was a stranger, and ye took me
not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. 25:44 Then shall
they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or
naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? 25:45 Then shall he answer them,
saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to
me. 25:46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

Now, at the last, we will turn our attention to the relationship between John the Baptist and Jesus. While several
references have already been made to that relationship, both with regard to the fulfillment of prophecies, the family tie
between their mothers, and the similarities and dissimilarities between their teachings, we have waited until now to
consider the story of their interactions during the years they both resided on planet earth. We might suppose that these
sons of cousins, who are also some kind of cousins, had some contact before they are described as meeting, as if for the
first time, by all of the canonical Gospels:

3:13 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. 3:14
But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to
me? 3:15 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it
becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.130

1:9 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and
was baptized of John in Jordan.131

3:21 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being
baptized…132

1:29 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of
God, which taketh away the sin of the world. 1:30 This is he of whom I said, After me
cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me. 1:31 And I knew
him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come
baptizing with water.133

What is particularly interesting about the account found in the Gospel of John is that John the Baptist is telling the
story to one or more persons. As Jesus approaches, he says, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh
away the sin of the world. This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is
preferred before me: for he was before me. And I knew him not: but that he should
be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.” He must have
baptized Jesus earlier, without this person or persons having witnessed the event, because the narrator goes on, “1:32
And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove,
and it abode upon him. 1:33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with
water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and
remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. 1:34 And I
saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.” John is testifying to someone else that he has seen
133Gospel of John 1:29-31

and heard these things, and the one to whom he testifies is quoting him verbatim. Maybe there is a clue to who this
person might have been…we know he accompanied John on this particular day, when John said, “Behold the Lamb of
God” and we know that he must have been an intimate follower of John to be trusted with such precious revelations.
The story continues:

1:35 Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples; 1:36 And looking
upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God! 1:37 And the two
disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 1:38 Then Jesus turned, and saw
them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi,
(which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou? 1:39 He saith unto
them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that
day: for it was about the tenth hour. 1:40 One of the two which heard John speak,
and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 1:41 He first findeth his own
brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being
interpreted, the Christ.

Are these the same two disciples to whom John initially said, “Behold the Lamb of God”? It seems that they
were, because otherwise how would the chronicler, who was one of the two, know what transpired on this second
occasion, and afterwards? One of the two disciples of John is identified, and it is Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.
Since Andrew promptly recruits his brother, we know the other disciple is not Peter. My speculation is that it is John,
the supposed author of the Gospel of John, the Epistles of John, and the Apocalypse/Revelation. There are several
reasons for this suggestion, but let us review the references to this disciple in the Gospel of John before we proceed:

13:23 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. 13:24 Simon
Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake. 13:25 He
then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? 13:26 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I
shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas
Iscariot, the son of Simon.

19:26 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith
unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son! 19:27 Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother!
And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.

20:1 The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the
sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. 20:2 Then she runneth, and cometh
to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken
away the LORD out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.

21:6 And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast
therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. 21:7 Therefore that
disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was
the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.

21:17 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved
because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou
knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep. 21:18 Verily,
verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou
wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee,
and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. 21:19 This spake he, signifying by what death he should
glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me. 21:20 Then Peter, turning
about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and
said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee? 21:21 Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what
shall this man do? 21:22 Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?
follow thou me.

These words, urging Peter to follow Him into the fray, and to sacrifice his life for his Lord, for by the expression
“signifying by what death he should glorify God” the traditional understanding of the passage is that Jesus
predicted that Peter would die a martyr to his faith.134 This statement was witnessed by “the disciple whom Jesus
loved”, and of all the disciples, the only one who is reported to have lived a long enough life to know that Peter died a
martyr was John135. So typical of Peter was his concern about what another person would do--so he asks, “Lord, and
what shall this man do?” Jesus answers in the only mode He could adopt with such a stubborn and simple man, a
man who understood only straight talk, and some things only when they were repeated three times (either by himself as in
the three denials or by Jesus as in these three repetitions of the same question): “If I will that he tarry till I come,
what is that to thee?” According to tradition, John tarried, that is, he remained alive and cognizant in the physical
world until Jesus revealed to him…the Book of Revelation: “1:1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God
gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and
signified it by his angel unto his servant John: 1:2 Who bare record of the word of God, and of the
testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.”

The Gospel of Matthew reports that John did not want to baptize Jesus, that He voiced His objection and that Jesus
insisted and so He went ahead with it:

3:13 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. 3:14 But John
forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? 3:15 And Jesus

134http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11744a.htm
135http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08492a.htm

answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.
Then he suffered him.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá was asked why John objected and He answered:

Question. -- It is said in the Gospel of St. Matthew, chapter 3, verses 13, 14, 15: "Then cometh
Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. But John forbade Him, saying, I
have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him,
Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered Him."
What is the wisdom of this: since Christ possessed all essential perfection, why did He need
baptism?

Answer. -- The principle of baptism is purification by repentance. John admonished and
exhorted the people, and caused them to repent; then he baptized them. Therefore, it is apparent
that this baptism is a symbol of repentance from all sin: its meaning is expressed in these words:
"O God! as my body has become purified and cleansed from physical impurities, in the same way
purify and sanctify my spirit from the impurities of the world of nature, which are not worthy of
the Threshold of Thy Unity!" Repentance is the return from disobedience to obedience. Man,
after remoteness and deprivation from God, repents and undergoes purification: and this is a
symbol signifying "O God! make my heart good and pure, freed and sanctified from all save Thy
love."

As Christ desired that this institution of John should be used at that time by all, He Himself
conformed to it in order to awaken the people and to complete the law of the former religion.
Although the ablution of repentance was the institution of John, it was in reality formerly
practiced in the religion of God.

Christ was not in need of baptism; but as at that time it was an acceptable and
praiseworthy action, and a sign of the glad tidings of the Kingdom, therefore, He confirmed it.
However, afterward He said the true baptism is not with material water, but it must be with spirit
and with water. In this case water does not signify material water, for elsewhere it is explicitly
said baptism is with spirit and with fire, from which it is clear that the reference is not to material
fire and material water, for baptism with fire is impossible.136

During the baptism of Jesus, the canonical Gospels report a visitation of the Holy Spirit. This visitation must have been
witnessed, because it is described by John the Baptist as well as by others in two other Gospels:

136‘Abdu’l-Bahá,   Some Answered Questions, pp. 91-92

3:16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens
were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:
3:17 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.137

1:10 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a
dove descending upon him: 1:11 And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased.138

3:21 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and
praying, the heaven was opened, 3:22 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove
upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well
pleased.139

1:32 And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it
abode upon him. 1:33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said
unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he
which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. 1:34 And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of
God.140

‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that the “dove” is a symbol, not a material form:

So the symbol of knowledge is light, and of ignorance, darkness; but reflect, is knowledge sensible
light, or ignorance sensible darkness? No, they are merely symbols. These are only intellectual states,
but when you desire to express them outwardly, you call knowledge light, and ignorance darkness.
You say: "My heart was gloomy, and it became enlightened." Now, that light of knowledge, and
that darkness of ignorance, are intellectual realities, not sensible ones; but when we seek for
explanations in the external world, we are obliged to give them a sensible form.

Then it is evident that the dove which descended upon Christ was not a material dove, but it
was a spiritual state, which, that it might be comprehensible, was expressed by a sensible figure.
Thus in the Old Testament it is said that God appeared as a pillar of fire: this does not signify the
material form; it is an intellectual reality which is expressed by a sensible image.141
138Gospel  of Mark 1:10-11
140Gospel of John 1:32-34

\[141\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, pp. 84-85

In the Gospel it is said, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God." Then it is
evident and clear that Christ did not reach to the station of Messiahship and its perfections at the
time of baptism, when the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in the likeness of a dove. Nay, the
Word of God from all eternity has always been, and will be, in the exaltation of sanctification.142

Shoghi Effendi takes this explanation of the spiritual significance and symbolism of the “dove” representing the Holy
Spirit in the baptism of Jesus, and relates it to the awakening into prophetic consciousness of Zarathushtra, of Moses, of
Muhammad, and of Bahá’u’llah:

…of Jesus when coming out of the waters of the Jordan He saw the heavens opened and the Holy
Ghost descend like a dove and light upon Him…143

…the "Most Great Spirit," as designated by Himself, and symbolized in the Zoroastrian, the
Mosaic, the Christian, and Muhammadan Dispensations by the Sacred Fire, the Burning Bush, the
Dove and the Angel Gabriel respectively, descended upon, and revealed itself, personated by a
"Maiden," to the agonized soul of Bahá'u'lláh.144

…the descent of the Dove upon Christ in the Jordan… It was on that occasion that the "Most Great
Spirit," as designated by Bahá'u'lláh Himself, revealed itself to Him, in the form of a "Maiden," and
bade Him "lift up" His "voice between earth and heaven" -- that same Spirit which, in the
Zoroastrian, the Mosaic, the Christian, and Muhammadan Dispensations, had been respectively
symbolized by the "Sacred Fire," the "Burning Bush," the "Dove," and the "Angel Gabriel."145

Hence, what many Christians have understood to have been a miraculous physical manifestation of God’s power, the
appearance of the Holy Spirit as a “dove” alighting upon Jesus at the same time as the voice of God is heard speaking
words reminiscent of a Psalm text, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that this “dove” is a symbol, that Jesus was a Manifestation
of God prior to this event. Shoghi Effendi points out that other Manifestations of God have conveyed the experience of
their prophetic call employing other symbols. What cannot be conveyed without symbolism is the reality of the Holy
Spirit. We can know the effects of its influence, but not the thing in itself.

THE TEACHING OF JESUS ON THE PREACHING OF JOHN

Jesus commented in several discourses on the preaching and behavior of John. During their first recorded encounter, at
the baptism of Jesus, we find the first conversation:

\[143\] Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p. 92

\[144\] Shoghi Effendi, Ibid., p. 100

\[145\] Shoghi Effendi, Messages to America, pp. 99-100

3:13 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. 3:14 But John
forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? 3:15 And
Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all
righteousness. Then he suffered him. (Gospel of Matthew)

Jesus then went into the wilderness, and when He came out, John had been imprisoned by Herod Antipas (Matthew
4:12; Mark 6:17; Luke 3:20). Jesus left Judea and went into Galilee, where He began to teach:

4:12 Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;
4:13 And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the
borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim: 4:14 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
prophet, saying, 4:15 The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea,
beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles; 4:16 The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and
to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up. 4:17 From that time
Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
(Gospel of Matthew)

1:14 Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel
of the kingdom of God, 1:15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God
is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. (Gospel of Mark)

The Gospels of Luke and John do not say when John was imprisoned. Luke cites John’s imprisonment before the
baptism of Jesus:

3:19 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife, and for
all the evils which Herod had done, 3:20 Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in
prison. 3:21 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being
baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, 3:22 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily
shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son;
in thee I am well pleased.

Luke then notes that after His baptism:

4:1 And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the
wilderness, 4:2 Being forty days tempted of the devil.

He then reports that after Jesus returned from the wilderness He went into Galilee and there taught
in the synagogues:

4:14 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him
through all the region round about. 4:15 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.
(Gospel of Luke)

Hence, the sequence of events, while somewhat murky in the Gospel of Luke, is clear in the Gospels of Matthew and
Mark, and between the three of them they indicate that Jesus did not begin to preach until John was already in prison.
The next interaction between John and Jesus is reported in the Gospel of Matthew and almost identically in the Gospel
of Luke:

11:2 Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, 11:3
And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another? 11:4 Jesus answered
and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see: 11:5
The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the
deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
11:6 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me. 11:7 And as they departed,
Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness
to see? A reed shaken with the wind? 11:8 But what went ye out for to see? A man
clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. 11:9
But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a
prophet. 11:10 For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger
before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. [Malachi 3:1] 11:11 Verily I
say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater
than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is
greater than he. 11:12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of
heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. 11:13 For all the prophets
and the law prophesied until John. 11:14 And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which
was for to come. 11:15 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. 11:16 But whereunto
shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and
calling unto their fellows, 11:17 And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not
danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented. 11:18 For John came
neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil. 11:19 The Son of man
came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a
winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her
children. (Gospel of Matthew)

7:19 And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that
should come? or look we for another? 7:20 When the men were come unto him, they said, John
Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? 7:21

And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto
many that were blind he gave sight. 7:22 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way,
and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame
walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the
gospel is preached. 7:23 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.
7:24 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people
concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with
the wind? 7:25 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?
Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings'
courts. 7:26 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and
much more than a prophet. 7:27 This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my
messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. 7:28 For I say
unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than
John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. 7:29
And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized
with the baptism of John. 7:30 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of
God against themselves, being not baptized of him. 7:31 And the Lord said,
Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?
7:32 They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to
another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have
mourned to you, and ye have not wept. 7:33 For John the Baptist came neither eating
bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil. 7:34 The Son of man is come
eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a
friend of publicans and sinners! 7:35 But wisdom is justified of all her children.
(Gospel of Luke)

Apparently not all of the followers of John were satisfied with the answers given by Jesus. While this is not reported
in the New Testament, some of the followers of John did not recognize Jesus as the fulfillment of John’s prophecies.
Bahá’u’llah refers to them in Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, and compares them with the followers of the Báb who
failed to recognize Him as the Promised One of the Báb:

Likewise, refuting certain disbelievers, He saith: "For none knoweth the time of the Revelation
except God. Whenever it appeareth, all must acknowledge the Point of Truth, and render thanks
unto God." They that have turned aside from Me have spoken even as the followers of John (the
Baptist) spoke. For they, too, protested against Him Who was the Spirit (Jesus) saying: "The
dispensation of John hath not yet ended; wherefore hast thou come?"146

146Bahá’u’lláh,   Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 157

The incomparable exaltation of the station of this successor to John the Baptist is also noted for the relationship of
Bahá’u’llah to the Báb:

And likewise, He147 saith: "Were He to make of every one on earth a Prophet, all would, in very
truth, be accounted as Prophets in the sight of God." And likewise, He saith: "In the day of the
revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest all that dwell on earth will be equal in His
estimation. Whomsoever He ordaineth as a Prophet, he, verily, hath been a Prophet from the
beginning that hath no beginning, and will thus remain until the end that hath no end, inasmuch
as this is an act of God. And whosoever is made a Vicegerent by Him, shall be a Vicegerent in all
the worlds, for this is an act of God. For the will of God can in no wise be revealed except
through His will, nor His wish be manifested save through His wish. He, verily, is the All-
Conquering, the All-Powerful, the All-Highest."148

And likewise, He149 saith: "Let not names shut you out as by a veil from Him Who is their Lord,
even the name of Prophet, for such a name is but a creation of His utterance." And likewise, He,
in the seventh chapter of the second Vahid, saith: "O people of the Bayan! Act not as the people
of the Qur'án have acted, for if ye do so, the fruits of your night will come to naught." And
further, He saith -- glorified be His mention: "If thou attainest unto His Revelation, and obeyest
Him, thou wilt have revealed the fruit of the Bayan; if not, thou art unworthy of mention before
God. Take pity upon thyself. If thou aidest not Him Who is the Manifestation of the Lordship of
God, be not, then, a cause of sadness unto Him." And further He saith -- magnified be His
station: "If thou attainest not unto the Presence of God, grieve not, then, the Sign of God. Ye will
renounce that which can profit them that acknowledge the Bayan, if ye renounce that which can
harm Him. I know, however, that ye will refuse to do so."150

THE TEACHINGS OF JESUS CITED BY BAHÁ’U’LLÁH

The sayings, or LOGIA of Jesus have been collected, compared, analyzed, and, in recent years, they have also been
published alongside similar sayings attributed to Lao-Tse, Buddha and Muhammad. Parallels between these logia
and the Bahá’í teachings have not yet been attempted, except in specific and isolated cases, and even those are
difficult to track down. Here is a collection of references to the logia by Bahá’u’llah in various of His Tablets.

These are the melodies, sung by Jesus, Son of Mary, in accents of majestic power in the Ridvan
of the Gospel, revealing those signs that must needs herald the advent of the Manifestation after
Him. In the first Gospel according to Matthew it is recorded… Similarly, in the three other

147   The Bab.
148Bahá’u’lláh, Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 154
149The Bab.
150Bahá’u’lláh, Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 171

Gospels, according to Luke, Mark, and John, the same statements are recorded. As We have
referred at length to these in Our Tablets revealed in the Arabic tongue151, We have made no
mention of them in these pages, and have confined Ourselves to but one reference.152

Beside this passage, there is yet another verse in the Gospel wherein He saith: "Heaven and earth
shall pass away: but My words shall not pass away."153 Thus it is that the adherents of Jesus
maintained that the law of the Gospel shall never be annulled, and that whensoever the promised
Beauty is made manifest and all the signs are revealed, He must needs re-affirm and establish the
law proclaimed in the Gospel, so that there may remain in the world no faith but His faith. This
is their fundamental belief. And their conviction is such that were a person to be made manifest
with all the promised signs and to promulgate that which is contrary to the letter of the law of the
Gospel, they must assuredly renounce him, refuse to submit to his law, declare him an infidel,
and laugh him to scorn.154

Consider now, had the people of the Gospel recognized the meaning of the symbolic terms "sun"
and "moon," had they sought, unlike the froward and perverse, enlightenment from Him Who is
the Revealer of divine knowledge, they would have surely comprehended the purpose of these
terms, and would not have become afflicted and oppressed by the darkness of their selfish desires.
Yea, but since they have failed to acquire true knowledge from its very Source, they have
perished in the perilous vale of waywardness and misbelief. They still have not awakened to
perceive that all the signs foretold have been made manifest, that the promised Sun hath risen
above the horizon of divine Revelation, and that the "sun" and "moon" of the teachings, the
laws, and learning of a former Dispensation have darkened and set.155

Judge fairly: Were the prophecies recorded in the Gospel to be literally fulfilled; were Jesus, Son
of Mary, accompanied by angels, to descend from the visible heaven upon the clouds; who would
dare to disbelieve, who would dare to reject the truth, and wax disdainful?156

Our purpose in relating these things is to warn you that were they to maintain that those verses
wherein the signs referred to in the Gospel are mentioned have been perverted, were they to
reject them, and cling instead to other verses and traditions, you should know that their words
were utter falsehood and sheer calumny.157

unidentified Tablets.

We have also heard a number of the foolish of the earth assert that the genuine text of the
heavenly Gospel doth not exist amongst the Christians, that it hath ascended unto heaven. How
grievously they have erred! How oblivious of the fact that such a statement imputeth the gravest
injustice and tyranny to a gracious and loving Providence! How could God, when once the Day-
star of the beauty of Jesus had disappeared from the sight of His people, and ascended unto the
fourth heaven, cause His holy Book, His most great testimony amongst His creatures, to
disappear also? What would be left to that people to cling to from the setting of the day-star of
Jesus until the rise of the sun of the Muhammadan Dispensation? What law could be their stay
and guide? How could such people be made the victims of the avenging wrath of God, the
omnipotent Avenger? How could they be afflicted with the scourge of chastisement by the
heavenly King? Above all, how could the flow of the grace of the All-Bountiful be stayed? How
could the ocean of His tender mercies be stilled? We take refuge with God, from that which His
creatures have fancied about Him! Exalted is He above their comprehension!158

In another passage of the Gospel it is written159: "And it came to pass that on a certain day the
father of one of the disciples of Jesus had died. That disciple reporting the death of his father
unto Jesus, asked for leave to go and bury him. Whereupon, Jesus, that Essence of Detachment,
answered and said: "Let the dead bury their dead."160

It is also recorded in the Gospel according to St. Luke, that on a certain day Jesus passed by a
Jew who was sick of the palsy, and lay upon a couch. When the Jew saw Him, he recognized
Him, and cried out for His help. Jesus said unto him: "Arise from thy bed; thy sins are forgiven
thee." Certain of the Jews, standing by, protested saying: "Who can forgive sins, but God alone?"
And immediately He perceived their thoughts, Jesus answering said unto them: "Whether is it
easier to say to the sick of the palsy, arise, and take up thy bed, and walk; or to say, thy sins are
forgiven thee? that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins."161
This is the real sovereignty, and such is the power of God's chosen Ones! All these things which
We have repeatedly mentioned, and the details which We have cited from divers sources, have
no other purpose but to enable thee to grasp the meaning of the allusions in the utterances of the
chosen Ones of God, lest certain of these utterances cause thy feet to falter and thy heart to be
dismayed.162

Moreover, those whom they had formerly known were Moses, the Revealer of the Pentateuch,
and Jesus, the Author of the Gospel. Notwithstanding, why did Muhammad say: "When He of

158Bahá’u’lláh, Ibid., pp. 89-90
160Bahá’u’lláh, Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 119
162Bahá’u’lláh, Kitab-i-Iqan, pp. 133-134

Whom they had knowledge came unto them" -- that is Jesus or Moses -- "they disbelieved in
Him?" Was not Muhammad to outward seeming called by a different name? Did He not come
forth out of a different city? Did He not speak a different language, and reveal a different Law?
How then can the truth of this verse be established, and its meaning be made clear?163

Wherefore, O my friend, it behooveth Us to exert the highest endeavour to attain unto that City,
and, by the grace of God and His loving-kindness, rend asunder the "veils of glory"; so that, with
inflexible steadfastness, we may sacrifice our drooping souls in the path of the New Beloved. We
should with tearful eyes, fervently and repeatedly, implore Him to grant us the favour of that
grace. That city is none other than the Word of God revealed in every age and dispensation. In
the days of Moses it was the Pentateuch; in the days of Jesus the Gospel; in the days of
Muhammad the Messenger of God the Qur'án; in this day the Bayan; and in the dispensation of
Him Whom God will make manifest His own Book -- the Book unto which all the Books of
former Dispensations must needs be referred, the Book which standeth amongst them all
transcendent and supreme. In these cities spiritual sustenance is bountifully provided, and
incorruptible delights have been ordained. The food they bestow is the bread of heaven, and the
Spirit they impart is God's imperishable blessing. Upon detached souls they bestow the gift of
Unity, enrich the destitute, and offer the cup of knowledge unto them who wander in the
wilderness of ignorance. All the guidance, the blessings, the learning, the understanding, the
faith, and certitude, conferred upon all that is in heaven and on earth, are hidden and treasured
within these Cities.164

Even as the Christian divines who, holding fast to the verse of the Gospel to which We have
already referred165, have sought to explain that the law of the Gospel shall at no time be
annulled, and that no independent Prophet shall again be made manifest, unless He confirmeth
the law of the Gospel. Most of the people have become afflicted with the same spiritual disease.166

As alluded to above, Bahá’u’llah cited other verses from the Gospels in a treatise revealed in Arabic, and entitled
Jawahiru’l-Asrar (Gems of Divine Mysteries)167:

This is the text of that which was revealed aforetime in the first Gospel, according to Matthew,
regarding the signs that must needs herald the advent of the One Who shall come after Him. He

165"Heaven and earth shall pass away: but My words shall not pass away." (Gospel of

Matthew 24:35; Gospel of Mark 13:31; Gospel of Luke 21:33)

saith: "And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days..."168,
until the mystic Dove, singing in the midmost heart of eternity, and the celestial Bird, warbling
upon the Divine Lote-Tree, saith: "Immediately after the oppression of those days shall the sun
be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the
powers of the heavens shall be shaken: and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in
heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man
coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he shall send his angels with a
great sound of a trumpet."169

In the second Gospel, according to Mark, the Dove of holiness speaketh in such terms: "For in
those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God
created unto this time, neither shall be."170 And it singeth later with the same melodies as before,
without change or alteration. God, verily, is a witness unto the truth of My words.

And in the third Gospel, according to Luke, it is recorded: "There shall be signs in the
sun, and in the moon, and in the stars, and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the
sea and the waves roaring; and the powers of heaven shall be shaken. And then shall they see the
Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. And when these things begin to come
to pass, know that the kingdom of God hath drawn nigh."171

And in the fourth Gospel, according to John, it is recorded: "But when the Comforter is come,
whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the
Father, he shall testify of me: and ye also shall bear witness."172 And elsewhere He saith: "But the
Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you
all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you."173 And:
"But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? But
because I have said these things unto you..."174 And yet again: "Nevertheless I tell you the truth:
It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you;
but if I depart, I will send him unto you."175 And: "Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come,
he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear,
that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come."176

And should they reply: "The Books that are in the hands of this people, which they call the
Gospel and attribute to Jesus, the Son of Mary, have not been revealed by God and proceed not
from the Manifestations of His Self", then this would imply a cessation in the abounding grace of
Him Who is the Source of all grace. If so, God's testimony to His servants would have remained
incomplete and His favour proven imperfect. His mercy would not have shone resplendent, nor
would His grace have overshadowed all. For if at the ascension of Jesus His Book had likewise
ascended unto heaven, then how could God reprove and chastise the people on the Day of
Resurrection, as hath been written by the Imams of the Faith and affirmed by its illustrious
divines?177

It is recorded in all the Books of the Gospel that He Who is the Spirit spoke in words of pure light
unto His disciples, saying: "Know that heaven and earth may pass away, but my words shall
never pass away."178 As is clear and evident to thine eminence, these words outwardly mean that
the Books of the Gospel will remain in the hands of people till the end of the world, that their
laws shall not be abrogated, that their testimony shall not be abolished, and that all that hath
been enjoined, prescribed, or ordained therein shall endure forever. O My brother! Sanctify thy
heart, illumine thy soul, and sharpen thy sight, that thou mayest perceive the sweet accents of the
Birds of Heaven and the melodies of the Doves of Holiness warbling in the Kingdom of eternity,
and perchance apprehend the inner meaning of these utterances and their hidden mysteries. For
otherwise, wert thou to interpret these words according to their outward meaning, thou couldst
never prove the truth of the Cause of Him Who came after Jesus, nor silence the opponents, nor
prevail over the contending disbelievers. For the Christian divines use this verse to prove that the
Gospel shall never be abrogated and that, even if all the signs recorded in their Books were
fulfilled and the Promised One appeared, He would have no recourse but to rule the people
according to the ordinances of the Gospel. They contend that if He were to manifest all the signs
indicated in the Books, but decree aught besides that which Jesus had decreed, they would
neither acknowledge nor follow Him, so clear and self-evident is this matter in their sight.179

In other Writings Bahá’u’llah likewise refers to the Gospel as the revelation to Jesus:

The followers of the Gospel, likewise, hold as impossible that the Bearer of a new Revelation
should again shine forth from the dayspring of the Will of God after Jesus, Son of Mary -- peace
be upon Him! In support of this contention, they adduce the following verse from the Gospel:
"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but the words of the Son of Man shall never pass away."180
They maintain that neither the teachings nor the commandments of Jesus -- peace be upon Him!

177Bahá’u’lláh, Gems of Divine Mysteries, pp. 12-13
179Bahá’u’lláh, Gems of Divine Mysteries, pp. 17-19

-- may ever be altered. At one point in the Gospel, He saith: "I go away, and come again."181
Again in the Gospel of John, He hath foretold the advent of a Comforter who shall come after
Him.182 In the Gospel of Luke, moreover, a number of signs and portents have been mentioned.
Certain divines of that Faith, however, have interpreted these utterances after their own fancy,
and have thus failed to grasp their true significance. O would that thou wouldst permit Me, O
Shah, to send unto thee that which would cheer the eyes, and tranquillize the souls, and persuade
every fair-minded person that with Him is the knowledge of the Book. Certain persons, incapable
of answering the objections raised by their opponents, claim that the Torah and the Gospel have
been corrupted183, whereas in reality the references to such corruption pertain only to specific
cases.184

Say: O peoples of all faiths! Walk not in the ways of them that followed the Pharisees and thus
veiled themselves from the Spirit. They truly have strayed and are in error. The Ancient Beauty
is come in His Most Great Name, and He wisheth to admit all mankind into His most holy
Kingdom. The pure in heart behold the Kingdom of God manifest before His Face. Make haste
thereunto and follow not the infidel and the ungodly. Should your eye be opposed thereto, pluck
it out.185 Thus hath it been decreed by the Pen of the Ancient of Days, as bidden by Him Who is
the Lord of the entire creation. He, verily, hath come again that ye might be redeemed, O
peoples of the earth. Will ye slay Him Who desireth to grant you eternal life? Fear God, O ye
who are endued with insight.186

Again, heard ye not that which hath been recorded in the Gospel concerning those "which were
born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God"187 -- that is,
those who have been made manifest through the power of God? Wherefore it becometh evident
that one may well be manifested in the world of creation who is truly of God, the Almighty, the
All-Knowing, the All-Wise. How is it then that when word reached you of Our Cause, ye failed
to inquire from Our own lips, that ye might distinguish truth from falsehood, discover Our aim
and purpose, and learn of the afflictions which We have suffered at the hands of an evil and
wayward generation?

Gospel according to John concerning the Word and those who are its Manifestations? And hast

thou ignored the counsels of the Spirit [Jesus] concerning the Manifestations of the Word, and
been numbered with the heedless?188

The primacy of the apostle Peter is seemingly affirmed by these words in the Gospels:

16:15 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? 16:16 And Simon Peter answered and
said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. 16:17 And Jesus answered and said unto
him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my
Father which is in heaven. 16:18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this
rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. 16:19 And I will give
unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be
bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. (Gospel of
Matthew)

18:15 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee
and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. 18:16 But if he will not hear
thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every
word may be established. 18:17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if
he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. 18:18
Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and
whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. 18:19 Again I say unto you, That if
two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them
of my Father which is in heaven. 18:20 For where two or three are gathered together in my
name, there am I in the midst of them. 18:21 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft
shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? 18:22 Jesus saith unto him, I
say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven. (Gospel of Matthew)

One of the meanings of Matthew 16:18-19 is that the Christian sanctuary is founded upon the faith of Peter:

Jesus Christ, addressing Peter, said, "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church."
This utterance was indicative of the faith of Peter, signifying: This faith of thine, O Peter, is the
very cause and message of unity to the nations; it shall be the bond of union between the hearts
of men and the foundation of the oneness of the world of humanity. In brief, the original purpose
of temples and houses of worship is simply that of unity -- places of meeting where various
peoples, different races and souls of every capacity may come together in order that love and
agreement should be manifest between them. (‘Abdu'l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p.
65)

188Bahá’u’lláh,   The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, pp. 191-192

Another of the meanings of Matthew 16:18-19 is that the house of worship, the physical church is a symbol of the
church of God which is the divine law:

That is to say, the Manifestation of God is the real divine temple and Collective Center of which
the outer church is but a symbol. Recall the statement of Jesus Christ in the Gospel. Addressing
Peter, He said, "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church." It is evident,
therefore, that the church of God is the law of God and that the actual edifice is but one symbol
thereof. For the law of God is a collective center which unites various peoples, native lands,
tongues and opinions. (‘Abdu'l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, pp. 163-164)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá indicates that this appointment of Peter as the foundation of the church is not comparable to His
appointment by Bahá’u’llah in Kitab-i-Aqdas and Kitab-i-‘Ahd:

Christ, for instance, did not appoint a center of authority and explanation. He did not say to His
followers, "Obey the one whom I have chosen." Upon one occasion He asked His disciples,
"Whom say ye that I am?" Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the
living God." Christ, wishing to make firm the faith of Peter, said, "Thou art Peter, and upon this
rock I will build my church," meaning that the faith of Peter was the true faith. It was a sanction
of Peter's faith. He did not say that all should turn to Peter. He did not say, "He is the branch
extended from my ancient root." He did not say, "O God! Bless all who serve Peter. O God!
Degrade those who are not obedient to him. Shun him who is a violator of the Covenant. O
God! Thou knowest that I love all who are steadfast in the Covenant." (‘Abdu'l-Bahá, The
Promulgation of Universal Peace, pp. 385-386)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá indicates that this statement in Matthew 16:18-19 indicates that Peter was singled out for a special
honor:

Judas Iscariot was the greatest of the disciples, and he summoned the people to Christ. Then it
seemed to him that Jesus was showing increasing regard to the Apostle Peter, and when Jesus
said, 'Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church,' these words
addressed to Peter, and this singling out of Peter for special honour, had a marked effect on the
Apostle, and kindled envy within the heart of Judas. For this reason he who had once drawn nigh
did turn aside, and he who had believed in the Faith denied it, and his love changed to hate, until
he became a cause of the crucifixion of that glorious Lord, that manifest Splendour. Such is the
outcome of envy, the chief reason why men turn aside from the Straight Path. So hath it
occurred, and will occur, in this great Cause. But it doth not matter, for it engendereth loyalty in
the rest, and maketh souls to arise who waver not, who are fixed and unshakeable as the

mountains in their love for the Manifest Light. (‘Abdu'l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, p. 163)

Shoghi Effendi twice stated in one of his letters to the American Bahá’ís that the traditional Roman Catholic
affirmation of the primacy of Peter is affirmed in the Bahá’í Revelation:

“…the primacy of Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, is upheld and defended.” (Shoghi Effendi,
The Promised Day is Come, p. 109)

“…the legitimacy of the institution of the Imamate, and of the primacy of St. Peter, the Prince of
the Apostles...” [These are among] “the central, the solid, the incontrovertible principles that
constitute the bedrock of Bahá'í belief, which the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh is proud to acknowledge,
which its teachers proclaim, which its apologists defend, which its literature disseminates, which
its summer schools expound, and which the rank and file of its followers attest by both word and
deed.” (Shoghi Effendi, The Promised Day is Come, p. 110)

There is yet another interpretation of the meaning of Matthew 16:18-19, and it bears close examination:

Question. – “In the Gospel of St. Matthew it is said: "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will
build My church." What is the meaning of this verse?

Answer. – “This utterance of Christ is a confirmation of the statement of Peter, when Christ
asked: Whom do you believe Me to be? and Peter answered: I believe that "Thou art the Son of
the living God." Then Christ said to him: "Thou art Peter" -- for Cephas in Aramaic means rock
-- "and upon this rock I will build My church." For the others in answer to Christ said that He
was Elias [Elijah/Eliahu], and some said John the Baptist, and some others Jeremias
[Jeremiah/Yermiyahu] or one of the Prophets.

“Christ wished by suggestion, or an allusion, to confirm the words of Peter; so on account of the
suitability of his name, Peter, He said: "and upon this rock I will build My church," meaning, thy
belief that Christ is the Son of the living God will be the foundation of the Religion of God, and
upon this belief the foundation of the church of God -- which is the Law of God -- shall be
established.

“The existence of the tomb of Peter in Rome is doubtful; it is not authenticated. Some say it is in
Antioch.

“Moreover, let us compare the lives of some of the Popes with the religion of Christ. Christ,
hungry and without shelter, ate herbs in the wilderness, and was unwilling to hurt the feelings of
anyone. The Pope sits in a carriage covered with gold and passes his time in the utmost splendor,
amidst such pleasures and luxuries, such riches and adoration, as kings have never had.

“Christ hurt no one, but some of the Popes killed innocent people: refer to history. How much
blood the Popes have shed merely to retain temporal power! For mere differences of opinion they
arrested, imprisoned and slew thousands of the servants of the world of humanity and learned
men who had discovered the secrets of nature. To what a degree they opposed the truth!

“Reflect upon the instructions of Christ, and investigate the habits and customs of the Popes.
Consider: is there any resemblance between the instructions of Christ and the manner of
government of the Popes? We do not like to criticize, but the history of the Vatican is very
extraordinary. The purport of our argument is this, that the instructions of Christ are one thing,
and the manner of the Papal government is quite another; they do not agree. See how many
Protestants have been killed by the order of the Popes, how many tyrannies and oppressions have
been countenanced, and how many punishments and tortures have been inflicted! Can any of
the sweet fragrances of Christ be detected in these actions? No! in the name of God! These
people did not obey Christ, while Saint Barbara, whose picture is before us, did obey Christ, and
followed in His footsteps, and put His commands into practice. Among the Popes there are also
some blessed souls who followed in the footsteps of Christ, particularly in the first centuries of the
Christian era when temporal things were lacking and the tests of God were severe. But when they
came into possession of governmental power, and worldly honor and prosperity were gained, the
Papal government entirely forgot Christ and was occupied with temporal power, grandeur,
comfort and luxuries. It killed people, opposed the diffusion of learning, tormented the men of
science, obstructed the light of knowledge, and gave the order to slay and to pillage. Thousands
of souls, men of science and learning, and sinless ones, perished in the prisons of Rome. With all
these proceedings and actions, how can the Vicarship of Christ be believed in?

“The Papal See has constantly opposed knowledge; even in Europe it is admitted that religion is
the opponent of science, and that science is the destroyer of the foundations of religion. While the
religion of God is the promoter of truth, the founder of science and knowledge, it is full of
goodwill for learned men; it is the civilizer of mankind, the discoverer of the secrets of nature,
and the enlightener of the horizons of the world. Consequently, how can it be said to oppose
knowledge? God forbid! Nay, for God, knowledge is the most glorious gift of man and the most
noble of human perfections. To oppose knowledge is ignorant, and he who detests knowledge
and science is not a man, but rather an animal without intelligence. For knowledge is light, life,
felicity, perfection, beauty and the means of approaching the Threshold of Unity. It is the honor

and glory of the world of humanity, and the greatest bounty of God. Knowledge is identical with
guidance, and ignorance is real error.

“Happy are those who spend their days in gaining knowledge, in discovering the secrets of
nature, and in penetrating the subtleties of pure truth! Woe to those who are contented with
ignorance, whose hearts are gladdened by thoughtless imitation, who have fallen into the lowest
depths of ignorance and foolishness, and who have wasted their lives!”

(‘Abdu'l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, pp. 135-137)

While the previously cited interpretations might well be taken to confirm Peter as the founder of the Christian church
and therefore to confirm the long-established dogma of the Roman Catholic Church that the Papacy and the entirety
of the ecclesiastical structure was established by Jesus Christ, and therefore unimpeachable in authority, even, as
Catholic doctrine indicates, infallible. But this last passage undermines that dogma, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá pointed out
that the Papacy was responsible for perpetrating horrendous of crimes against humanity. While the founder of the
church was appointed by Jesus, that did not ensure that the church would remain faithful to the teachings of its
Master. There are indications in the Gospel accounts that Peter himself was not above criticism, and hardly
infallible. Jesus taught non-violence (Luke 6:27-29; Matthew 5:38-39,44-45), but Peter committed violence
(John 18:10-11; Luke 22:49-51; Mark 14:47; Matthew 26:51-52); Jesus commanded obedience (John
10:27, 14:5-12), and Peter rebuked Him and was told “Get thee behind me Satan!” (Mark 8:32-33; Matthew
16:22-23); Jesus enjoined loyalty (Luke 12:8-9), and Peter denied Him three times (John 18:17,25-27; Luke
22:57-60; Mark 14:67-72; Matthew 26:69-74).

If Jesus had prophesied that Peter would be the founder of the church, and that thereby the authority and
infallibility of Jesus Christ was conveyed by this first of the disciples to the entire line of Popes, and to the
ecclesiastical order as a whole, then history tells us that this prophecy was not fulfilled. On the other hand, if He
predicted that Peter, with his significant foibles, would be emblematic of the leadership of the Christian community,
then this may have been more accurately realized than Christian tradition might wish to recognize. The most
spiritually perceptive of the disciples was Mary Magdalene, who was the first to see and affirm the risen Christ.
Here seven sins preceded her conversion. In contrast to her, Peter initially denied the resurrection (Mark 16:9-11),
and his plentiful sins postdated his conversion…I speak of his violence, his disobedience, his disloyalty.

The most beloved of the disciples was John, as attested plentifully in the Gospel of John (13:23,25; 19:26-27;
20:2; 21:7,20) , and it was plain that Jesus preferred John over Peter, as indicated by these verses at the
conclusion of his Gospel:

“21:20 Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also
leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee? 21:21 Peter seeing
him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? 21:22 Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he

tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me. 21:23 Then went this saying abroad among
the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but,
If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? 21:24 This is the disciple which testifieth of
these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.”

Hence, the special distinction of Peter is that he is the model for what will become of the church leadership—it will
engage in and condone violence, it will be disobedient to the teachings of Jesus, and it will be disloyal to Him and
follow after idols and false prophets. It began to turn violent shortly after the death of Jesus, as reported in the Book
of Acts:

“4:36 And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The
son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus, 4:37 Having land, sold it, and
brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet. 5:1 But a certain man named Ananias, with
Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, 5:2 And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy
to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet. 5:3 But Peter said, Ananias, why
hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the
land? 5:4 Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own
power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto
God. 5:5 And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came
on all them that heard these things. 5:6 And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried
him out, and buried him. 5:7 And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not
knowing what was done, came in. 5:8 And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the
land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much. 5:9 Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye
have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried
thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out. 5:10 Then fell she down straightway at his
feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying
her forth, buried her by her husband. 5:11 And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as
many as heard these things.”

Consider whether there is any record of Jesus condemning any man or woman to death for the commission of any
sin? Did He not forgive and show mercy to every one? Was Peter stricken down when he disobeyed Jesus, when he
was unfaithful to Jesus? Or was he pardoned, not once but multiple times? Why then was Peter, so soon after the
passing of his Master, condemning and meting out capital punishment for the minor crime of misreporting income to
the community of believers? This was precisely the model that centuries of church governance was to follow, so that
the church ultimately became the exact opposite of the teachings of Jesus…to such a degree that millions of
Christians risked death and indeed did meet their earthly end as a result of discovering this contradiction and
refusing to adhere to the traditions in which they were raised and by which they were governed.

Cleanliness is a major theme of Jesus’ teachings. But unlike Biblical injunction, which requires women to bathe in
order to purify themselves after intercourse and during menstruation, and Jewish tradition, which required similar
cleansing by men, Jesus put all the stress on spiritual purification.

15:16 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? 15:17 Do not ye yet understand,
that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
15:18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they
defile the man. 15:19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: 15:20 These are the things which defile a man: but
to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. (Gospel of Matthew)

7:14 And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every
one of you, and understand: 7:15 There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him
can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man. 7:16 If
any man have ears to hear, let him hear. 7:17 And when he was entered into the house from the
people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable. 7:18 And he saith unto them, Are ye so
without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth
into the man, it cannot defile him; 7:19 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly,
and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats? 7:20 And he said, That which cometh out of
the man, that defileth the man. 7:21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil
thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, 7:22 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit,
lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: 7:23 All these evil things come from
within, and defile the man. (Gospel of Mark)

Jesus critiques those among His compatriots, his coreligionists who put all the emphasis on outward rather than
inward spirituality:

23:25 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup
and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. 23:26 Thou blind Pharisee,
cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.
(Gospel of Matthew)

11:37 And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat
down to meat. 11:38 And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed
before dinner. 11:39 And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of
the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness. 11:40 Ye fools,
did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also? 11:41 But rather give
alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you. (Gospel of Luke)

Jesus exhorts His followers not to be overly concerned with what they eat and how they clothe themselves. They
should put first things first, the matters of the spirit, and everything else will follow:

6:25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall
drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body
than raiment? 6:26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather
into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? 6:27
Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? 6:28 And why take ye
thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they
spin: 6:29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of
these. 6:30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is
cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? 6:31 Therefore take no
thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be
clothed? 6:32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth
that ye have need of all these things. (Gospel of Matthew)

12:19 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine
ease, eat, drink, and be merry. 12:20 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall
be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided? 12:21 So is he
that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God. 12:22 And he said unto his
disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for
the body, what ye shall put on. 12:23 The life is more than meat, and the body is more than
raiment. 12:24 Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse
nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls? 12:25 And which
of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit? 12:26 If ye then be not able to do
that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest? 12:27 Consider the lilies how they
grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not
arrayed like one of these. 12:28 If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and
to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith? 12:29
And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind. 12:30
For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have
need of these things. (Gospel of Luke)

The chief disciple Peter saw a vision, after the ascension of Jesus, not once but three times (as was the case with
other counsels he had received during the lifetime of Jesus), as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles:

11:4 But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them,
saying, 11:5 I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel

descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to
me: 11:6 Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted
beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. 11:7 And I heard a
voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat. 11:8 But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing
common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth. 11:9 But the voice answered me
again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. 11:10 And this was
done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.

The apostle Paul concurred with this understanding, as indicated in the Epistle to the Romans:

14:13 Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a
stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way. 14:14 I know, and am persuaded by
the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be
unclean, to him it is unclean. 14:15 But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou
not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. 14:16 Let not then your
good be evil spoken of: 14:17 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness,
and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

He extended this principle to the company one keeps when one is eating:

5:29 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of
publicans and of others that sat down with them. 5:30 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured
against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners? 5:31 And Jesus
answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. 5:32
I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. 5:33 And they said unto him, Why do
the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but
thine eat and drink? 5:34 And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber
fast, while the bridegroom is with them? 5:35 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall
be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days. (Gospel of Matthew)

2:15 And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat
also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him. 2:16 And
when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his
disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners? 2:17 When Jesus
heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that
are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. (Gospel of Mark)

Then He points to the hypocrisy of His critics, who accuse His ascetic herald of being possessed by a devil, while
regarding Him, proBábly in comparison with John, a glutton and wino and a friend of riffraff:

11:18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil. 11:19 The Son
of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a
friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children. (Gospel of Matthew)

7:33 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a
devil. 7:34 The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man,
and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! 7:35 But wisdom is justified of all her
children. 7:36 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went
into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat. (Gospel of Luke)

Consider that, of all religions, the most strict and detailed in its regulation of diet and clothing is proBábly
Judaism. The rules that govern Zoroastrian priests, Hindu Brahmins, Buddhist monks are complicated and
regarded by their practitioners as essential to spiritual order and advancement. But for Orthodox Jews, it is not just
the religious professionals, the rabbis and cantors who are bound by hundreds of rules that govern food and
raiment…it is every man and every woman, every boy and every girl. While it might be observed, and rightly so,
that most of these rules may have come into existence subsequent to the lifetime of Jesus, it is certain that the
Sadducees referred to in the Gospels were strict in their observant of Biblical laws and Temple traditions; that the
Pharisees and scribes also spoken of in the Gospels were not only keepers of Biblical laws but also of layers of
traditional elaboration of those injunctions that gave rise to the Mishnah, the Gemara and ultimately the great codes
of halakhah.

However, Jesus does not actually reject laws and commandments, in fact, He insists they be obeyed by His
followers:

5:17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but
to fulfil. 5:18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no
wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. 5:19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least
commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven:
but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
5:20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the
scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. (Gospel of Matthew)

19:16 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I
may have eternal life? 19:17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none
good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. 19:18 He
saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery,

Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, 19:19 Honour thy father and thy mother:
and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 19:20 The young man saith unto him, All these
things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? 19:21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be
perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven:
and come and follow me. (Gospel of Matthew)

10:17 And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him,
and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? 10:18 And Jesus said
unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God. 10:19 Thou
knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear
false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother. 10:20 And he answered and said unto
him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth. 10:21 Then Jesus beholding him loved
him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give
to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.
(Gospel of Mark)

18:18 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
18:19 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.
18:20 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do
not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother. 18:21 And he said, All these have I
kept from my youth up. 18:22 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest
thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure
in heaven: and come, follow me.        (Gospel of Luke)

13:34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that
ye also love one another. (Gospel of John)

14:15 If ye love me, keep my commandments. (Gospel of John)

14:21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that
loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
(Gospel of John)

15:10 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's
commandments, and abide in his love. 15:11 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy
might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. 15:12 This is my commandment, That ye
love one another, as I have loved you. (Gospel of John)

This same theme is recapitulated in the First Epistle of John:

2:3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. 2:4 He that saith,
I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 2:5 But
whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are
in him. 2:6 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked. 2:7
Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from
the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.
(First Epistle of John)

3:21 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. 3:22 And
whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things
that are pleasing in his sight. 3:23 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the
name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. 3:24 And he
that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he
abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us. (First Epistle of John)

4:20 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his
brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? 4:21 And this
commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also. 5:1 Whosoever
believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth
him also that is begotten of him. 5:2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we
love God, and keep his commandments. 5:3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his
commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. (First Epistle of John)

Paul reiterates this principle in his First Epistle to Timothy:

1:5 Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience,
and of faith unfeigned: 1:6 From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain
jangling; 1:7 Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof
they affirm. 1:8 But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; 1:9 Knowing this, that
the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and
for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for
manslayers, 1:10 For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for
menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to
sound doctrine; 1:11 According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed
to my trust. (Gospel of 1 Timothy)

And John cites it in the Apocalypse:

14:12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and
the faith of Jesus.   (Gospel of Revelation)

22:14 Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life,
and may enter in through the gates into the city. (Gospel of Revelation)

It is not the law itself but the interpretation of the law that is taken in another direction from the conventional by
Jesus, as expressed in the Gospels:

5:20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the
scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. 5:21 Ye have heard
that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in
danger of the judgment: 5:22 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother
without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca,
shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell
fire. 5:23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother
hath ought against thee; 5:24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be
reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. 5:25 Agree with thine adversary
quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the
judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. 5:26 Verily I say
unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.
5:27 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: 5:28
But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed
adultery with her already in his heart. 5:29 And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast
it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy
whole body should be cast into hell. 5:30 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it
from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy
whole body should be cast into hell. 5:31 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let
him give her a writing of divorcement: 5:32 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away
his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall
marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. 5:33 Again, ye have heard that it hath been said
by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:
5:34 But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: 5:35 Nor by
the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. 5:36
Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. 5:37
But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of

evil. 5:38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: 5:39
But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn
to him the other also. 5:40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let
him have thy cloak also. 5:41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.
5:42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.
5:43 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.
5:44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate
you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; 5:45 That ye may be the
children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the
good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. 5:46 For if ye love them which love you,
what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? 5:47 And if ye salute your brethren
only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so? 5:48 Be ye therefore perfect,
even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. 6:1 Take heed that ye do not your alms before
men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. 6:2
Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do
in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you,
They have their reward. 6:3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right
hand doeth: 6:4 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself
shall reward thee openly.6:5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for
they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be
seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 6:6 But thou, when thou prayest,
enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and
thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. 6:7 But when ye pray, use not vain
repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. 6:8
Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before
ye ask him. 6:9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed
be thy name. 6:10 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. 6:11 Give us
this day our daily bread. 6:12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. 6:13 And lead
us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the
glory, for ever. Amen. 6:14 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also
forgive you: 6:15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your
trespasses. 6:16 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they
disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have
their reward. 6:17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; 6:18 That
thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which
seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. 6:19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,
where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: 6:20 But lay up
for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves

do not break through nor steal: 6:21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
6:22 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full
of light.

(Gospel of Matthew)

6:63 It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you,
they are spirit, and they are life. (Gospel of John)

This is reiterated by the apostle Paul in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians:

3:1 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of
commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you? 3:2 Ye are our epistle written in
our hearts, known and read of all men: 3:3 Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the
epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not
in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart. 3:4 And such trust have we through Christ to
God-ward: 3:5 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our
sufficiency is of God; 3:6 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the
letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. (Gospel of 2 Corinthians)

The law that Jesus does not approve of is the law of man, not the law of God:

15:1 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, 15:2 Why do
thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat
bread. 15:3 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment
of God by your tradition? 15:4 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother:
and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. 15:5 But ye say, Whosoever shall
say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; 15:6
And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment
of God of none effect by your tradition. 15:7 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you,
saying, 15:8 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their
lips; but their heart is far from me. 15:9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines
the commandments of men. (Gospel of Matthew)

7:7 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. 7:8
For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots
and cups: and many other such like things ye do. 7:9 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject
the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition. (Gospel of Luke)

The apostle Paul likewise makes this distinction in his Epistle to Titus:

1:13 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;
1:14 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.
(Gospel of Titus)

In contrast to the teachings and life of Jesus, consider these details of Apollonius of Tyana, a contemporary189:

And having said this he declined to live upon a flesh diet, on the ground that it was unclean, and
also that it made the mind gross; so he partook only of dried fruits and vegetables, for he said that
all the fruits of the earth are clean. And of wine he said that it was a clean drink because it is
yielded to men by so well-domesticated a plant as the vine; but he declared that it endangered
the mental balance and system and darkened, as with mud, the ether which is in the soul.

After then having thus purged his interior, he took to walking without shoes by way of
adornment and clad himself in linen raiment, declining to wear any animal product; and he let
his hair grow long and lived in the Temple. And the people round about the Temple were struck
with admiration for him, and the god Asclepius one day said to the priest that he was delighted to
have Apollonius as witness of his cures of the sick; and such was his reputation that the Cilicians
themselves and the people all around flocked to Aegae to visit him. Hence the Cilician proverb:
"Whither runnest thou? Is it to see the stripling?" Such was the saying that arose about him, and
it gained the distinction of becoming a proverb.

These are a few of the references made by Bahá’u’llah to the verses of the Gospel. There are many others that refer
to the epistles of the disciples and the Book of Revelation which are also included in the canonical New Testament.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi have also cited such verses. On the contrary. Bahá’u’llah writes about this verse
(Matthew 22:16-21; Mark 12:13-17 ; Luke 20:19-25):

Regard for the rank of sovereigns is divinely ordained, as is clearly attested by the words of the
Prophets of God and His chosen ones. He Who is the Spirit (Jesus) -- may peace be upon Him --
was asked: "O Spirit of God! Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not?" And He
made reply: "Yea, render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the
things that are God's." He forbade it not. These two sayings are, in the estimation of men of
insight, one and the same, for if that which belonged to Caesar had not come from God, He
would have forbidden it. (Bahá'u'llah, Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, pp. 89-90)

189http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_1_06.html#1:             Flavius Philostratus, The Life of
Apollonius of Tyana, Book One

22:35 And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye
any thing? And they said, Nothing. 22:36 Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a
purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment,
and buy one. 22:37 For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me,
And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.
(Gospel of Matthew)

22:38 And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.
(Gospel of Luke 22:35-38)

One commentator suggests this is in fulfillment of this verse from the Book of Isaiah:

53:12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the
strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the
transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

Another interpretation is suggested by what happened later in the Gospel account:

26:51 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his
sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. 26:52 Then said Jesus unto
him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. 26:53
Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than
twelve legions of angels? 26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
26:55 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with
swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold
on me. (Gospel of Matthew)

14:47 And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and
cut off his ear. 14:48 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief,
with swords and with staves to take me? 14:49 I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and
ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled. (Gospel of Mark)

22:49 When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall
we smite with the sword? 22:50 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off
his right ear.22:51 And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and
healed him. 22:52 Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the
elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves? 22:53

When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your
hour, and the power of darkness. (Gospel of Luke)

This recalls the prophecy related almost identically by two of the Hebrew prophets…they envisioned a time when
the sword would be used no longer…and Jesus made it crystal clear according to the Gospel of Matthew, that this
moment had arrived. Instead of calling Peter and his other followers to defend him and to overcome his enemies, he
told him to lay down his weapon. When the religious authorities sought to apprehend him, he reprimanded them for
bearing swords and staves, as if he was a common criminal.

2:4 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat
their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword
against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. (Book of Isaiah)

4:3 And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall
beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a
sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. (Book of Micah)

Whereas Jewish tradition dichotomized the entirety of human society into male and female spheres, and Christian
tradition has, until recently and under the powerful influence of secular factors rather than religious influences, done
the very same, Jesus sets forth a vision of the kingdom of God, in which gender is simply not a factor. It is found in
all three of the synoptic Gospels:

22:23 The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and
asked him, 22:24 Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall
marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. 22:25 Now there were with us seven brethren:
and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his
brother: 22:26 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh. 22:27 And last of all the
woman died also. 22:28 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for
they all had her. 22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures,
nor the power of God. 22:30 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given
in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven. (Gospel of Matthew)

12:18 Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked
him, saying, 12:19 Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind
him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his
brother. 12:20 Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.
12:21 And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise. 12:22
And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also. 12:23 In the resurrection

therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.
12:24 And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the
scriptures, neither the power of God? 12:25 For when they shall rise from the dead, they
neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in
heaven. (Gospel of Mark)

20:27 Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and
they asked him, 20:28 Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a
wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his
brother. 20:29 There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without
children. 20:30 And the second took her to wife, and he died childless. 20:31 And the third took
her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died. 20:32 Last of all the
woman died also. 20:33 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had
her to wife. 20:34 And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry,
and are given in marriage: 20:35 But they which shall be accounted worthy to
obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are
given in marriage: 20:36 Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the
angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection. (Gospel
of Luke)

Jesus tells a different story which bears upon the same principle, in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke:

24:37 But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 24:38 For as in
the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in
marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, 24:39 And knew not until the flood came,
and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 24:40 Then shall two be
in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 24:41 Two women shall be grinding at the
mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. (Gospel of Matthew)

We should note that there is no distinction between gender, but rather whether it be two men in the field or two
women grinding at the mill, “the one shall be taken, and the other left”.

24:42 Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. 24:43 But know this,
that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have
watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. 24:44 Therefore be ye also
ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. 24:45 Who then is a faithful
and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due
season? 24:46 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. 24:47

Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods. 24:48 But and if that evil
servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; 24:49 And shall begin to smite his
fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; 24:50 The lord of that servant shall come
in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, 24:51 And shall cut
him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth. (Gospel of Matthew)

He counsels that we live knowing that any day the Lord may arrive and witness our actions, not
to imagine that “My lord delayeth his coming” and that therefore one has permission to do
wickedness, “to smite his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken”. (Gospel of
Matthew)

17:26 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. 17:27
They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that
Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. 17:28 Likewise also as it
was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they
builded; 17:29 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
heaven, and destroyed them all. 17:30 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is
revealed. 17:31 In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let
him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.
17:32 Remember Lot's wife. 17:33 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and
whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it. 17:34 I tell you, in that night there shall be two men
in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left. 17:35 Two women shall be
grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 17:36 Two men shall be in the field;
the one shall be taken, and the other left. 17:37 And they answered and said unto him, Where,
Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered
together. 18:1 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and
not to faint; 18:2 Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded
man: 18:3 And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of
mine adversary. 18:4 And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself,
Though I fear not God, nor regard man; 18:5 Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge
her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. 18:6 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust
judge saith. 18:7 And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him,
though he bear long with them? 18:8 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless
when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? (Gospel of Luke)

The independence of this election to the true life from the daily events and concerns of the world, including gender
and gender roles is reinforced by these counsels:

6:25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall
drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body
than raiment? 6:26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather
into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? 6:27
Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? 6:28 And why take ye
thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they
spin: 6:29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of
these. 6:30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is
cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? 6:31 Therefore take no
thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be
clothed? 6:32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth
that ye have need of all these things. 6:33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his
righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. (Gospel of Matthew)

Jesus describes the kingdom of heaven in many of His parables:

13:31 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain
of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: 13:32 Which indeed is the least of all
seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds
of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. 13:33 Another parable spake he unto them;
The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of
meal, till the whole was leavened. 13:34 All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in
parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them: 13:35 That it might be fulfilled which
was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which
have been kept secret from the foundation of the world. 13:36 Then Jesus sent the multitude
away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the
parable of the tares of the field. 13:37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good
seed is the Son of man; 13:38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the
kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; 13:39 The enemy that sowed them is
the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. 13:40 As therefore
the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. 13:41 The
Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that
offend, and them which do iniquity; 13:42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall
be wailing and gnashing of teeth. 13:43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the
kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. 13:44 Again, the kingdom of
heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for
joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. 13:45 Again, the kingdom of
heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: 13:46 Who, when he had found one

pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. 13:47 Again, the kingdom of
heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: 13:48 Which,
when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast
the bad away. 13:49 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever
the wicked from among the just, 13:50 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be
wailing and gnashing of teeth. 13:51 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?
They say unto him, Yea, Lord. 13:52 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is
instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth
forth out of his treasure things new and old. (Gospel of Matthew)

19:23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter
into the kingdom of heaven. 19:24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 19:25 When
his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved? 19:26 But
Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are
possible. (Gospel of Matthew)

20:1 For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early
in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. 20:2 And when he had agreed with the
labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. 20:3 And he went out about the
third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, 20:4 And said unto them; Go ye also
into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way. 20:5 Again he
went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. 20:6 And about the eleventh hour he
went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day
idle? 20:7 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also
into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive. 20:8 So when even was come, the
lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire,
beginning from the last unto the first. 20:9 And when they came that were hired about the
eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. 20:10 But when the first came, they supposed
that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. 20:11 And
when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house, 20:12 Saying,
These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have
borne the burden and heat of the day. 20:13 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do
thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny? 20:14 Take that thine is, and go thy
way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee. 20:15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will
with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good? 20:16 So the last shall be first, and the first
last: for many be called, but few chosen. (Gospel of Matthew)

21:28 But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go
work to day in my vineyard. 21:29 He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented,
and went. 21:30 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go,
sir: and went not. 21:31 Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him,
The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into
the kingdom of God before you. 21:32 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and
ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it,
repented not afterward, that ye might believe him. 21:42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never
read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the
corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? 21:43 Therefore say I unto you,
The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits
thereof. 21:44 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall
fall, it will grind him to powder. (Gospel of Matthew)

Jesus describes the kingdom of heaven in the Gospel of Luke:

13:18 Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?
13:19 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew,
and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it. 13:20 And again he
said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God? 13:21 It is like leaven, which a woman took
and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. 13:22 And he went through the
cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem. 13:23 Then said one unto him,
Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them, 13:24 Strive to enter in at the strait
gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able. 13:25 When once the
master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to
knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I
know you not whence ye are: 13:26 Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy
presence, and thou hast taught in our streets. 13:27 But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not
whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. 13:28 There shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the
kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out. 13:29 And they shall come from the east, and
from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of
God. 13:30 And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.
(Gospel of Luke)

In another story Jesus reiterates this principle, that it is not male or female, marriage or celibacy, or maturity that
make one fit for the kingdom of heaven:

19:3 The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a
man to put away his wife for every cause? 19:4 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye
not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, 19:5 And said,
For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain
shall be one flesh? 19:6 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God
hath joined together, let not man put asunder. 19:7 They say unto him, Why did Moses then
command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away? 19:8 He saith unto them,
Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the
beginning it was not so. 19:9 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be
for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is
put away doth commit adultery. 19:10 His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so
with his wife, it is not good to marry. 19:11 But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this
saying, save they to whom it is given. 19:12 For there are some eunuchs, which were so born
from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and
there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He
that is able to receive it, let him receive it. 19:13 Then were there brought unto him little
children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them. 19:14
But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the
kingdom of heaven. (Gospel of Matthew)

9:36 And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his
arms, he said unto them, 9:37 Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name,
receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.

(Gospel of Mark)

10:13 And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples
rebuked those that brought them. 10:14 But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said
unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the
kingdom of God. 10:15 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God
as a little child, he shall not enter therein. 10:16 And he took them up in his arms, put his hands
upon them, and blessed them. (Gospel of Mark)

18:15 And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples
saw it, they rebuked them. 18:16 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children
to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. 18:17 Verily I say unto
you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter
therein. (Gospel of Luke)

In other Gospel stories Jesus calls His disciples “little children” and reverses the conventional order of relations
between parents and children:

13:33 Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the
Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you. 13:34 A new commandment I give unto
you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. 13:35 By this
shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. (Gospel of John)

18:1 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom
of heaven? 18:2 And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, 18:3
And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall
not enter into the kingdom of heaven. 18:4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little
child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 18:5 And whoso shall receive one such little
child in my name receiveth me. 18:6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe
in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were
drowned in the depth of the sea. (Gospel of Matthew)

What is needed then is not marriage or celibacy, not maturity or learning, but one thing—to be born again of the
Spirit:

3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born
again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. 3:4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be
born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? 3:5
Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit,
he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 3:6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that
which is born of the Spirit is spirit. 3:7 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
3:8 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell
whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. (Gospel of John)

Those who are born again, they are the “children of God, the children of the resurrection”:

20:35 But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from
the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: 20:36 Neither can they die any more: for
they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the
resurrection. (Gospel of Luke)

Who are the “children of God”? They are already identified in the Gospels:

5:9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. 5:10 Blessed are
they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. (Gospel of
Matthew)

The children of God are not of one nation or race or religion…they are those who make peace and those who are
persecuted because they have done what is righteous.

There is no hint in any of His discourses or actions that Jesus preferred men over women, or that He favored the
loquaciousness of men and the silence of women. What He called for was a change of heart, and, the direct result of
this change of heart, a change of behavior. This was indicative of salvation and redemption, of being one of the few
who was chosen rather than one of the many who were called. We may conclude therefore that the counsels that
Paul and Peter gave to their Christian brothers and sisters in faith pertaining to the conduct of women were not in
fact derived from the teachings of Jesus.

STORY BY STORY:
BAHÁ’Í INTERPRETATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT

We will begin with the stories told in the Gospels, as explained in the Bahá’í source texts, including the talks of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the letters written on behalf of the Guardian, and the writings of the Báb, Bahá’u’llah, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and Shoghi Effendi. The stories included here represent the start of a collection…and your assignment is to
expand upon this collection, so please take note of the general method employed.

THE COSMIC JESUS

Rather than starting with the Gospel of Matthew or more generally with the synoptic Gospels, we will commence
with the first verses of the Gospel of John…because they give a cosmic perspective on the appearance of Jesus Christ
which is unique to the New Testament and which predates His birth and even the story of His human heritage. The
verses are as follows190:

1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God. 1:2 The same was in the beginning with God. 1:3 All things were made by
him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.

The references to this first verse of the Gospel are numerous in Bahá’í source literature and they are all cited below
in order that we might come to a overall understanding of its interpretation:

In the Gospel it is said, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God." Then it is
evident and clear that Christ did not reach to the station of Messiahship and its perfections at the
time of baptism, when the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in the likeness of a dove. Nay, the
Word of God from all eternity has always been, and will be, in the exaltation of sanctification.191

In the world of God there is no past, no future and no present; all are one. So when Christ said,
"In the beginning was the Word" -- that means it was, is and shall be; for in the world of God
there is no time. Time has sway over creatures but not over God. For example, in the prayer He
says, "Hallowed be Thy name"192; the meaning is that Thy name was, is and shall be hallowed.

190Gospel of John 1:1-1:18

\[191\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, p. 153

\[192\] Gospel of Matthew 6:9; Gospel of Luke 11:2

Morning, noon and evening are related to this earth, but in the sun there is neither morning,
noon nor evening.193

In like manner, the Holy Manifestations of God are the centers of the light of reality, of the
source of mysteries, and of the bounties of love. They are resplendent in the world of hearts and
thoughts, and shower eternal graces upon the world of spirits; They give spiritual life and are
shining with the light of realities and meanings. The enlightenment of the world of thought
comes from these centers of light and sources of mysteries. Without the bounty of the splendor
and the instructions of these Holy Beings the world of souls and thoughts would be opaque
darkness. Without the irrefutable teachings of those sources of mysteries the human world would
become the pasture of animal appetites and qualities, the existence of everything would be
unreal, and there would be no true life. That is why it is said in the Gospel: "In the beginning was
the Word," meaning that it became the cause of all life.194

But the proceeding through manifestation (if by this is meant the divine appearance, and not
division into parts), we have said, is the proceeding and the appearance of the Holy Spirit and the
Word, which is from God. As it is said in the Gospel of John, "In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God"; then the Holy Spirit and the Word are the appearance of God.
The Spirit and the Word mean the divine perfections that appeared in the Reality of Christ, and
these perfections were with God; so the sun manifests all its glory in the mirror. For the Word
does not signify the body of Christ, no, but the divine perfections manifested in Him. For Christ
was like a clear mirror which was facing the Sun of Reality; and the perfections of the Sun of
Reality -- that is to say, its light and heat -- were visible and apparent in this mirror. If we look
into the mirror, we see the sun, and we say, "It is the sun." Therefore, the Word and the Holy
Spirit, which signify the perfections of God, are the divine appearance. This is the meaning of the
verse in the Gospel which says: "The Word was with God, and the Word was God"; for the
divine perfections are not different from the Essence of Oneness. The perfections of Christ are
called the Word because all the beings are in the condition of letters, and one letter has not a
complete meaning, while the perfections of Christ have the power of the word because a
complete meaning can be inferred from a word. As the Reality of Christ was the manifestation of
the divine perfections, therefore, it was like the word. Why? because He is the sum of perfect
meanings. This is why He is called the Word.

And know that the proceeding of the Word and the Holy Spirit from God, which is the
proceeding and appearance of manifestation, must not be understood to mean that the Reality of
Divinity had been divided into parts, or multiplied, or that it had descended from the exaltation

of holiness and purity. God forbid! If a pure, fine mirror faces the sun, the light and heat, the
form and the image of the sun will be resplendent in it with such manifestation that if a beholder
says of the sun, which is brilliant and visible in the mirror, "This is the sun," it is true.
Nevertheless, the mirror is the mirror, and the sun is the sun. The One Sun, even if it appears in
numerous mirrors, is one. This state is neither abiding nor entering, neither commingling nor
descending; for entering, abiding, descending, issuing forth and commingling are the necessities
and characteristics of bodies, not of spirits; then how much less do they belong to the sanctified
and pure Reality of God. God is exempt from all that is not in accordance with His purity and
His exalted and sublime sanctity.

The Sun of Reality, as we have said, has always been in one condition; it has no change,
no alteration, no transformation and no vicissitude. It is eternal and everlasting. But the Holy
Reality of the Word of God is in the condition of the pure, fine and shining mirror; the heat, the
light, the image and likeness -- that is to say, the perfections of the Sun of Reality -- appear in it.
That is why Christ says in the Gospel, "The Father is in the Son"195 -- that is to say, the Sun of
Reality appears in the mirror. Praise be to the One Who shone upon this Holy Reality, Who is
sanctified among the beings!196

The Christ was the word of God from the beginning - in the same way Mohammed says, "I was
a prophet before the existence of Adam," and Bahá'u'llah says, "In the beginning which has no
beginning I loved thee."

The sun is always the sun; if at a certain period it gave no light it would not at that period
be called the sun, for the characteristics of the sun are light and heat. The great ones are from all
time in their glorious station, their reality is luminous from the beginning, the reality that causes
the qualities of God to appear, but the day of their manifestation is the day when they proclaim
themselves of this earth.197

Our belief in regard to Christ is exactly what is recorded in the New Testament [Hamán tawr kih
dar Injíl madhkúr ast, lákin má sharh mídahím];198 however, we elucidate this matter and do not
speak literally [záhir] or in a manner based merely on blind belief. For instance, it is recorded in
the Gospel of St. John, "In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the
word was God." The majority of Christians accept this as a matter of belief,199 but we give an
explanation which is accepted by reason, an explanation that no one need find occasion to reject.

198Injíl literally means the Evangel, the Gospel.
199The original reads, "The Christians accept these assertions on mere hearing".

The Christians have made this statement the foundation of the trinity [Tathlíth], but
philosophers deny it as mere superstition,200 stating that the trinity as regards the identity of
divinity is impossible;201 and, in turn, the Christians do not give a satisfactory explanation and
interpretation that can be accepted by the philosophers, as the former base their whole
exposition of this subject upon the authority of the holy scriptures;202 the latter do not accept it,
saying, "Is it possible to have three in one and one in three?"

We explain this subject as follows:203 By the "word" we mean that creation with its infinite
forms is like unto letters,204 a letter individually has no meaning, no independent significance, but
the station of Christ is the station of the word.205 That is why we say Christ is the word. By
complete significance we mean that the universal bestowal of divinity206 is manifest in Christ. It is
obvious that the evolution207 of other souls is approximate, or only a part of, the whole, but the
perfections of the Christ are universal, or the whole. The reality of Christ is the collective centre
of all the independent virtues and infinite significances.208

For example, this lamp sheds light, the moon also illumines the night with its silvery
beams, but their light is not self created, they receive their light from another source; but His
Holiness the Christ is like unto the sun; his light issued forth from his own identity. He has not
received it through another person, therefore we give him the comprehensive title of the "word".
By this we mean that the all-comprehending reality and the depository of the infinite divine
virtues. 209 This "word" has an honorary beginning,210and not a beginning of [in] time. For
instance, we say, this person has precedence over all. This precedence comes to him through the
station and honour which he now holds in life, but it is not a precedence of [in] time. In reality
the "word" has neither a beginning nor ending. It means those perfections which appeared in
Christ and not his physical body. Those perfections were from God. It is similar to the rays of the
sun which are reflected in a clear mirror. The perfections of Christ were the splendour and

200"Mere   superstition" is not present in the original.
201The   original does not have "as regards the identity of Divinity".
202The original reads, "As this matter is only based on semantics and belief".
203 The original adds, "This priority and pre-existence is not in time for, if this priority were in time, the

Word would become contingent on time not eternal and changeless."
204 The original reads, "The world of existent beings is like the letters and all human beings as individual

letters."
205 The original adds, "which has a completely self-sufficient and independent meaning".
206 The original reads, "the bounties of divine perfections."
207The original reads, "The perfections of souls other than Christ are partial and are not derived from

themselves but from another".
208Alternatively the original reads, "But the Reality of Christ possesses complete and self-sufficient

perfections".
209The original reads, "That is an all-comprehending reality having all perfections".
210The original reads, "This word has a priority in honour and rank".

bounty of divinity.211 It is evident that these qualities were ever with God, even at this time they
are with him, they are inseparable from him, because divinity is not subject to division. Division
is a sign of imperfection, and God is the perfect one.

It is clear that the perfections of divinity are co- equal and co-existent with the essence. In
that station there is absolute unity. This in brief is the exposition of the station of Christ.212

Consider the statement recorded in the first chapter of the book of John: "In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." This statement
is brief but replete with the greatest meanings. Its applications are illimitable and beyond the
power of books or words to contain and express. Heretofore the doctors of theology have not
expounded it but have restricted it to Jesus as "the Word made flesh," the separation of Jesus
from God, the Father, and His descent upon the earth. In this way the individualized separation
of the godhead came to be taught.

The essential oneness of Father, Son and Spirit has many meanings and constitutes the
foundation of Christianity. Today we will merely give a synopsis of explanation. Why was Jesus
the Word?

In the universe of creation all phenomenal beings are as letters. Letters in themselves are
meaningless and express nothing of thought or ideal -- as, for instance, a, b, etc. Likewise, all
phenomenal beings are without independent meaning. But a word is composed of letters and has
independent sense and meaning. Therefore, as Christ conveyed the perfect meaning of divine
reality and embodied independent significance, He was the Word. He was as the station of reality
compared to the station of metaphor. There is no intrinsic meaning in the leaves of a book, but
the thought they convey leads you to reflect upon reality. The reality of Jesus was the perfect
meaning, the Christhood in Him which in the Holy Books is symbolized as the Word.

"The Word was with God." The Christhood means not the body of Jesus but the
perfection of divine virtues manifest in Him. Therefore, it is written, "He is God." This does not
imply separation from God, even as it is not possible to separate the rays of the sun from the sun.
The reality of Christ was the embodiment of divine virtues and attributes of God. For in Divinity
there is no duality. All adjectives, nouns and pronouns in that court of sanctity are one; there is
neither multiplicity nor division. The intention of this explanation is to show that the Words of

211Or "effulgent from God".
212The original adds at this point, "We do not postulate three hypostases (Persons, Ocnoom) in the Essence
of Divinity by merely asserting that in the beginning was the Word and the Word was God and the Word
was Christ. Rather we elaborate it."

God have innumerable significances and mysteries of meanings -- each one a thousand and
more.213

1:4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men. 1:5 And the light shineth in
darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. (Gospel of John)

The interpretation of this verse, while it is not specifically cited, is that the Spirit is the “light of men” and that it is
revealed by the Manifestation of God, and that most men do not recognize it, on account of their lack of spiritual
discernment, their spiritual ignorance:

As to thy question, "That ‘Abdu’l-Bahá hath said to some of the believers that evil never exists,
nay rather, it is a non-existent thing:"214 This is but truth, inasmuch as the greatest evil is (man's)
going astray and being veiled from Truth. Error is lack of guidance; darkness is absence of light;
ignorance is lack of knowledge; falsehood is lack of truthfulness; blindness is lack of sight; and
deafness is lack of hearing. Therefore, error, blindness, deafness and ignorance are non-existent

213‘Abdu’l-Bahá,    The Promulgation of Universal Peace, pp. 154-155
214‘Abdu’l-Bahá,    Some Answered Questions, Chapter 74, pp. 263-265: The Nonexistence of Evil
The true explanation of this subject is very difficult. Know that beings are of two kinds: material and
spiritual, those perceptible to the senses and those intellectual.
Things which are sensible are those which are perceived by the five exterior senses; thus those outward
existences which the eyes see are called sensible. Intellectual things are those which have no outward
existence but are conceptions of the mind. For example, mind itself is an intellectual thing which has no
outward existence. All man's characteristics and qualities form an intellectual existence and are not
sensible.

Briefly, the intellectual realities, such as all the qualities and admirable perfections of man, are
purely good, and exist. Evil is simply their nonexistence. So ignorance is the want of knowledge; error is
the want of guidance; forgetfulness is the want of memory; stupidity is the want of good sense. All these
things have no real existence.

In the same way, the sensible realities are absolutely good, and evil is due to their nonexistence --
that is to say, blindness is the want of sight, deafness is the want of hearing, poverty is the want of wealth,
illness is the want of health, death is the want of life, and weakness is the want of strength.

Nevertheless a doubt occurs to the mind -- that is, scorpions and serpents are poisonous. Are they
good or evil, for they are existing beings? Yes, a scorpion is evil in relation to man; a serpent is evil in
relation to man; but in relation to themselves they are not evil, for their poison is their weapon, and by
their sting they defend themselves. But as the elements of their poison do not agree with our elements --
that is to say, as there is antagonism between these different elements, therefore, this antagonism is evil;
but in reality as regards themselves they are good.

The epitome of this discourse is that it is possible that one thing in relation to another may be evil,
and at the same time within the limits of its proper being it may not be evil. Then it is proved that there is
no evil in existence; all that God created He created good. This evil is nothingness; so death is the absence
of life. When man no longer receives life, he dies. Darkness is the absence of light: when there is no light,
there is darkness. Light is an existing thing, but darkness is nonexistent. Wealth is an existing thing, but
poverty is non-existing.
Then it is evident that all evils return to nonexistence. Good exists; evil is nonexistent.

things. If we say that according to the text of the Bible, "God hardened Pharaoh's heart"215 that
he might not believe in Moses, this signifies that, verily, He did not soften his heart. And when
we wish to say that God hath not guided a certain one of His servants, this would be interpreted
(by people) that God led him astray. The darkness spoken of in the Bible as being created by
God216, signifieth that, verily, God hath not caused light to shine; inasmuch as where there is no
light, there will be darkness; when there is no sight, there will be blindness; when there is no life,
there will be death; when there is no riches, there will be poverty; and when there is no
knowledge, there will be ignorance.

Consequently, it is proven by indisputable argument and clear explanation that, verily,
evils are non-existent, but people have not understood the meaning of the verses of the Bible.217

1:6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. 1:7 The same came
for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.
1:8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. 1:9 That was
the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. (Gospel of
John)

The Bahá’í interpretation of this verse, while not cited yet found in countless references, is that the “true Light,
which lighteth every man that cometh into the world” is the Light of the Spirit. Here are some references to this
Light of the Spirit, which is revealed by each of the Manifestations of God and Their chosen ones:

But this power of the Covenant shall heat every freezing soul, shall bestow light upon everything
that is dark and shall secure for the captive in the hand of nature the true freedom of the
Kingdom.218

Well is it then with that countenance that reflecteth the splendour of the Light of the Beloved
One! The Lord be praised, thou hast been illumined with this Light, hast acquired the pearl of
true knowledge, and hast spoken the Word of Truth.219

215Book  of Exodus 7:13f
216Book  of Genesis: 1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 1:2 And the earth was
without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters. 1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 1:4 And God saw
the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. 1:5 And God called the
light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
217‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Tablets of Abdu'l-Baha, v3, pp. 609-610
218‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, pp. 102-103
219‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Ibid., p. 203

Now if the illustrious people of the one true God, the recipients of His confirmations, the objects
of His Divine assistance, should put forth all their strength, and with complete dedication, relying
upon God and turning aside from all else but Him, should adopt procedures for spreading the
Faith and should bend all their efforts to this end, it is certain that His Divine light would envelop
the whole earth.220

Man is said to be the greatest representative of God, and he is the Book of Creation because all
the mysteries of beings exist in him. If he comes under the shadow of the True Educator and is
rightly trained, he becomes the essence of essences, the light of lights, the spirit of spirits; he
becomes the center of the divine appearances, the source of spiritual qualities, the rising-place of
heavenly lights, and the receptacle of divine inspirations. If he is deprived of this education, he
becomes the manifestation of satanic qualities, the sum of animal vices, and the source of all dark
conditions.221

The principles of the Teachings of Bahá'u'lláh should be carefully studied, one by one, until they
are realized and understood by mind and heart -- so will you become strong followers of the light,
truly spiritual, heavenly soldiers of God, acquiring and spreading the true civilization in Persia, in
Europe, and in the whole world.222

In the time of Jesus Christ there was an outpouring of the Light from East to West that brought
the people under a heavenly banner and illumined them with divine insight. Western lands have
been kindled by the Light of the Christ. I pray earnestly that the Light in this advanced age will
so illumine the world that all may rally under the banner of Unity and receive Spiritual
education.

Then those problems which cause difference among the peoples of the earth will be seen
no more, for verily they are not. You are all waves of one sea, mirrors of one reflection.

This day the countries of Europe are at rest; Education has become widespread. The light
of liberty is the light of the West, and the intention of government is to work for truth and justice
in Western countries. But ever the light of spirituality shines from out of the East. In this age that
light has become dimmed; religion has become a matter of form and ceremony and the desire for
God's love has been lost.

220‘Abdu’l-Bahá, The Secret of Divine Civilization, p. 43
221‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, p. 236
222‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Paris Talks, p. 22

In very age of great spiritual darkness, a light is kindled in the East. So once again the
light of the teachings of God has come unto you. Even as education and progress travel from
West to East, so does the spiritual fire travel from East to West.

I hope that the people of the West may be illumined by the light of God; that the
Kingdom may come to them, that they may find eternal Life, that the Spirit of God may spread
like a fire among them, that they may be baptized with the Water of Life and may find a new
birth.223

Hearken, and I will show you the meaning thereof. Although He came from Nazareth, which
was a known place, He also came from Heaven. His body was born of Mary, but His Spirit came
from Heaven. The sword He carried was the sword of His tongue, with which He divided the
good from the evil, the true from the false, the faithful from the unfaithful, and the light from the
darkness. His Word was indeed a sharp sword!224

Therefore strive that your actions day by day may be beautiful prayers. Turn towards God, and
seek always to do that which is right and noble. Enrich the poor, raise the fallen, comfort the
sorrowful, bring healing to the sick, reassure the fearful, rescue the oppressed, bring hope to the
hopeless, shelter the destitute!

This is the work of a true Bahá'í, and this is what is expected of him. If we strive to do all
this, then are we true Bahá'ís, but if we neglect it, we are not followers of the Light, and we have
no right to the name.225

Our greatest efforts must be directed towards detachment from the things of the world; we must
strive to become more spiritual, more luminous, to follow the counsel of the Divine Teaching, to
serve the cause of unity and true equality, to be merciful, to reflect the love of the Highest on all
men, so that the light of the Spirit shall be apparent in all our deeds, to the end that all humanity
shall be united, the stormy sea thereof calmed, and all rough waves disappear from off the surface
of life's ocean henceforth unruffled and peaceful.226

When perfect justice reigns in every country of the Eastern and Western World, then will the
earth become a place of beauty. The dignity and equality of every servant of God will be

acknowledged; the ideal of the solidarity of the human race, the true brotherhood of man, will be
realized; and the glorious light of the Sun of Truth will illumine the souls of all men.227

1:10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew
him not. 1:11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not. 1:12 But as
many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to
them that believe on his name: 1:13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will
of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. (Gospel of John)

Again, heard ye not that which hath been recorded in the Gospel concerning those "which were
born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God" -- that is, those
who have been made manifest through the power of God? Wherefore it becometh evident that
one may well be manifested in the world of creation who is truly of God, the Almighty, the All-
Knowing, the All-Wise. How is it then that when word reached you of Our Cause, ye failed to
inquire from Our own lips, that ye might distinguish truth from falsehood, discover Our aim and
purpose, and learn of the afflictions which We have suffered at the hands of an evil and wayward
generation?

O Minister of the King of Paris! Hast thou forgotten the pronouncement recorded in the
Gospel according to John concerning the Word and those who are its Manifestations? And hast
thou ignored the counsels of the Spirit [Jesus] concerning the Manifestations of the Word, and
been numbered with the heedless? If not, wherefore then didst thou conspire with the Minister of
Persia to inflict upon Us that which hath caused the hearts of men of insight and understanding
to melt, the tears of the denizens of the Realm of eternity to flow, and the souls of them who are
nigh unto God to mourn? And all this thou didst commit without seeking to examine Our Cause
or to discern its truth. For is it not thy clear duty to investigate this Cause, to inform thyself of the
things that have befallen Us, to judge with equity, and to cleave unto justice?228

Furthermore, in the first chapter of the Gospel of John, verses 12 and 13, it is said: "But as many
as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believed
on His name:

"Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
God."

227‘Abdu’l-Bahá,   Ibid., p. 154
228Bahá’u’lláh,   Suriy-i-Muluk, in The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, pp. 191-192

From these verses it is obvious that the being of a disciple also is not created by physical power,
but by the spiritual reality. The honor and greatness of Christ is not due to the fact that He did
not have a human father, but to His perfections, bounties and divine glory. If the greatness of
Christ is His being fatherless, then Adam is greater than Christ, for He had neither father nor
mother. It is said in the Old Testament, "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the
ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."229
Observe that it is said that Adam came into existence from the Spirit of life. Moreover, the
expression which John uses in regard to the disciples proves that they also are from the Heavenly
Father. Hence it is evident that the holy reality, meaning the real existence of every great man,
comes from God and owes its being to the breath of the Holy Spirit.

The purport is that, if to be without a father is the greatest human glory, then Adam is
greater than all, for He had neither father nor mother. Is it better for a man to be created from a
living substance or from earth? Certainly it is better if he be created from a living substance.230

The rewards of this life are the virtues and perfections which adorn the reality of man. For
example, he was dark and becomes luminous; he was ignorant and becomes wise; he was
neglectful and becomes vigilant; he was asleep and becomes awakened; he was dead and
becomes living; he was blind and becomes a seer; he was deaf and becomes a hearer; he was
earthly and becomes heavenly; he was material and becomes spiritual. Through these rewards he
gains spiritual birth and becomes a new creature. He becomes the manifestation of the verse in
the Gospel where it is said of the disciples that they "were born, not of blood, nor of the will of
the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God" -- that is to say, they were delivered from the animal
characteristics and qualities which are the characteristics of human nature, and they became
qualified with the divine characteristics, which are the bounty of God. This is the meaning of the
second birth. For such people there is no greater torture than being veiled from God, and no
more severe punishment than sensual vices, dark qualities, lowness of nature, engrossment in
carnal desires. When they are delivered through the light of faith from the darkness of these vices,
and become illuminated with the radiance of the sun of reality, and ennobled with all the virtues,
they esteem this the greatest reward, and they know it to be the true paradise. In the same way
they consider that the spiritual punishment -- that is to say, the torture and punishment of
existence -- is to be subjected to the world of nature; to be veiled from God; to be brutal and
ignorant; to fall into carnal lusts; to be absorbed in animal frailties; to be characterized with dark
qualities, such as falsehood, tyranny, cruelty, attachment to the affairs of the world, and being
immersed in satanic ideas. For them, these are the greatest punishments and tortures.

229Book   of Genesis 2:7
230‘Abdu’l-Bahá,  Some Answered Questions, pp. 89-90

Likewise, the rewards of the other world are the eternal life which is clearly mentioned in
all the Holy Books, the divine perfections, the eternal bounties and everlasting felicity. The
rewards of the other world are the perfections and the peace obtained in the spiritual worlds after
leaving this world, while the rewards of this life are the real luminous perfections which are
realized in this world, and which are the cause of eternal life, for they are the very progress of
existence. It is like the man who passes from the embryonic world to the state of maturity and
becomes the manifestation of these words: "Blessed, therefore, be God, the most excellent of
Makers."231 The rewards of the other world are peace, the spiritual graces, the various spiritual
gifts in the Kingdom of God, the gaining of the desires of the heart and the soul, and the meeting
of God in the world of eternity. In the same way the punishments of the other world -- that is to
say, the torments of the other world -- consist in being deprived of the special divine blessings and
the absolute bounties, and falling into the lowest degrees of existence. He who is deprived of
these divine favors, although he continues after death, is considered as dead by the people of
truth.232

The Bahá’í texts speak of being “born…of God” as being born “of the spirit”, and, as we shall see presently (when
we arrive at consideration of the appropriate verses), and echoing the words of Jesus reported in the Gospel of John,
of the “second birth”, and being “born again”:

When the human soul soareth out of this transient heap of dust and riseth into the world of God,
then veils will fall away, and verities will come to light, and all things unknown before will be
made clear, and hidden truths be understood.

Consider how a being, in the world of the womb, was deaf of ear and blind of eye, and
mute of tongue; how he was bereft of any perceptions at all. But once, out of that world of
darkness, he passed into this world of light, then his eye saw, his ear heard, his tongue spoke. In
the same way, once he hath hastened away from this mortal place into the Kingdom of God,
then he will be born in the spirit; then the eye of his perception will open, the ear of his soul will
hearken, and all the truths of which he was ignorant before will be made plain and clear.233

Now amidst all the peoples of the world must the beloved arise, with a heart even as the day-star,
a strong inward urge, a shining brow, a musk-scented breath, a tongue speaking ever of God, an
exposition crystal-clear, a high resolve, a power born of heaven, a spiritual character, a
confirmation nothing short of the divine.234

Strive ye, therefore, with the help of God, with illumined minds and hearts and a strength born
of heaven, to become a bestowal from God to man, and to call into being for all humankind,
comfort and peace.235

Without the spirit the world of mankind is lifeless, and without this light the world of mankind is
in utter darkness. For the world of nature is an animal world. Until man is born again from the
world of nature, that is to say, becomes detached from the world of nature, he is essentially an
animal, and it is the teachings of God which convert this animal into a human soul.236

1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory,
the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. 1:15 John
bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that
cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me. 1:16 And of his
fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. 1:17 For the law was given by
Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. 1:18 No man hath seen God at
any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath
declared him. (Gospel of John)

Heretofore the doctors of theology have not expounded it but have restricted it to Jesus as "the
Word made flesh," the separation of Jesus from God, the Father, and His descent upon the earth.
In this way the individualized separation of the godhead came to be taught.237

‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written on “the individualized separation of the godhead”, namely, the orthodox Christian
doctrine of the Trinity, and this topic will be addressed when it is provoked by Gospel verses that allude to it.

Shoghi Effendi distinguishes the doctrine of the incarnation of the names and attributes of God in His
Manifestation from the doctrine of the incarnation of God Himself:

The divinity attributed to so great a Being and the complete incarnation of the names and
attributes of God in so exalted a Person should, under no circumstances, be misconceived or
misinterpreted. The human temple that has been made the vehicle of so overpowering a
Revelation must, if we be faithful to the tenets of our Faith, ever remain entirely distinguished
from that "innermost Spirit of Spirits"238 and "eternal Essence of Essences"239 -- that invisible yet
rational God Who, however much we extol the divinity of His Manifestations on earth, can in no

wise incarnate His infinite, His unknowable, His incorruptible and all-embracing Reality in the
concrete and limited frame of a mortal being. Indeed, the God Who could so incarnate His own
reality would, in the light of the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh, cease immediately to be God. So crude
and fantastic a theory of Divine incarnation is as removed from, and incompatible with, the
essentials of Bahá'í belief as are the no less inadmissible pantheistic and
anthropomorphic conceptions of God -- both of which the utterances of Bahá'u'lláh
emphatically repudiate and the fallacy of which they expose.

He Who in unnumbered passages claimed His utterance to be the "Voice of Divinity, the
Call of God Himself"240 thus solemnly affirms in the Kitáb-i-Íqán: "To every discerning and
illumined heart it is evident that God, the unknowable Essence, the Divine Being, is
immeasurably exalted beyond every human attribute such as corporeal existence, ascent and
descent, egress and regress241... He is, and hath ever been, veiled in the ancient eternity of His
Essence, and will remain in His Reality everlastingly hidden from the sight of men242... He
standeth exalted beyond and above all separation and union, all proximity and remoteness243...
'God was alone; there was none else beside Him' is a sure testimony of this truth."244

"From time immemorial," Bahá'u'lláh, speaking of God, explains, "He, the Divine Being, hath
been veiled in the ineffable sanctity of His exalted Self, and will everlasting continue to be wrapt
in the impenetrable mystery of His unknowable Essence245... Ten thousand Prophets, each a
Moses, are thunderstruck upon the Sinai of their search at God's forbidding voice, 'Thou shalt
never behold Me!'; whilst a myriad Messengers, each as great as Jesus, stand dismayed upon their
heavenly thrones by the interdiction 'Mine Essence thou shalt never apprehend!'"246 "How
bewildering to me, insignificant as I am," Bahá'u'lláh in His communion with God affirms, "is the
attempt to fathom the sacred depths of Thy knowledge! How futile my efforts to visualize the
magnitude of the power inherent in Thine handiwork -- the revelation of Thy creative power!"247
"When I contemplate, O my God, the relationship that bindeth me to Thee," He, in yet another
prayer revealed in His own handwriting, testifies, "I am moved to proclaim to all created things
'verily I am God!'; and when I consider my own self, lo, I find it coarser than clay!"248

248See also Bahá’u’lláh, Suriy-i-Haykal, in The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 85:

Say: I, verily, have not sought to extol Mine own Self, but rather God Himself, were ye to judge fairly.
Naught can be seen in Me except God and His Cause, could ye but perceive it. I am the One Whom the
tongue of Isaiah hath extolled, the One with Whose name both the Torah and the Evangel were adorned.

"The door of the knowledge of the Ancient of Days," Bahá'u'lláh further states in the Kitáb-i-
Íqán, "being thus closed in the face of all beings, He, the Source of infinite grace ... hath caused
those luminous Gems of Holiness to appear out of the realm of the spirit, in the noble form of the
human temple, and be made manifest unto all men, that they may impart unto the world the
mysteries of the unchangeable Being and tell of the subtleties of His imperishable Essence249... All
the Prophets of God, His well-favored, His holy and chosen Messengers are, without exception,
the bearers of His names and the embodiments of His attributes250... These Tabernacles of
Holiness, these primal Mirrors which reflect the Light of unfading glory, are but expressions of
Him Who is the Invisible of the Invisibles."251

That Bahá'u'lláh should, notwithstanding the overwhelming intensity of His Revelation, be
regarded as essentially one of these Manifestations of God, never to be identified with that
invisible Reality, the Essence of Divinity itself, is one of the major beliefs of our Faith -- a belief
which should never be obscured and the integrity of which no one of its followers should allow to
be compromised.252

One of the cherished doctrines of orthodox Christianity is that Jesus Christ was the “only begotten Son”, and that
this makes Him unique and superior to every other Being that has existed on earth or in the heavens, superior to all
but God Himself. This belief is buttressed with the citation of several other passages in the Gospel of John:

3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.253

3:18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is
condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten
Son of God.254

4:9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his
only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.255

Thus hath it been decreed in the Scriptures of thy Lord, the Most Merciful. He, verily, hath borne witness
unto Me, as I bear witness unto Him. And God testifieth to the truth of My words. Say: The Books have
been sent down for naught but My remembrance. Whosoever is receptive to their call shall perceive
therefrom the sweet fragrances of My name and My praise; and he who hath unstopped the ear of his
inmost heart shall hear from every word thereof: "The True One is come! He indeed is the beloved of the
worlds!"

254Gospel of John 3::18

The problem with interpreting these verses in an exclusive manner is that in the first chapter of the Gospel of John,
it is written:

1:12 But as many as received him, to them gave the power to become the sons of
God, even to them that believe on his name: 1:13 Which were born, not of blood,
nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

Furthermore, alongside the statements cited above are the following verses which seem to identify believers as “sons
of God” and “children of God”:

3:8 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning.
For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works
of the devil.

3:9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him:
and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.

3:10 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil:
whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his
brother.256

4:4 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he
that is in you, than he that is in the world.

4:5 They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth
them.

4:6 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth
not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.

4:7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is
born of God, and knoweth God.257

5:1 Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that
loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.

5:2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep

5:3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his
commandments are not grievous.

5:4 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory
that overcometh the world, even our faith.258

Paul also referred to the “sons of God” and to the “children of God” repeatedly in his Epistle to the Romans:

8:14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.

8:16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of
God:

8:17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be
that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.

8:19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of
the sons of God.

8:21 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of
corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.

Paul uses the same expression in his Epistle to the Galatians:

3:26 For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.

Furthermore, Paul wrote of Isaac being the “only begotten son” of Abraham in his Epistle to the Hebrews:

11:17 By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had
received the promises offered up his only begotten son, 11:18 Of whom it was said,
That in Isaac shall thy seed be called: 11:19 Accounting that God was able to raise
him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.259

258Gospel   of John 5:1-4
259Paul,   Epistle to the Hebrews, 11:17-11:19

We know that Paul was well-acquainted with the Torah, and he could not have meant that Abraham had no other
sons, inasmuch as the First Book of Chronicles reports:

1:28 The sons of Abraham; Isaac, and Ishmael.

1:32 Now the sons of Keturah, Abraham's concubine: she bare Zimran, and
Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.

Hence, Abraham did not have one son…He had 8 sons. Nor was His first son Isaac…Ishmael was born before
Isaac260:

16:15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which
Hagar bare, Ishmael.

16:16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to
Abram.

21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah
bare to him, Isaac.

21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had
commanded him.

21:5 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto
him.

The meaning of the actual word “only begotten” is key to understanding the intentions of the author. The
Greek word “monogenes” (mon-og-en-ace', Strong's 3439) and the Hebrew word “yachid” are translated "only
begotten" in the New Testament. Neither one literally meanings "to be born." Both words mean "unique," "only,"
"one of a kind." If Jesus and Isaac are likewise called “unique”, then in what way are followers of Jesus “the sons
of God” or the “children of God”? We simply cannot shrug off this expression, because it is used often in the Old
Testament and the New Testament:

6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters
were born unto them, 6:2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair;
and they took them wives of all which they chose. 6:4 There were giants in the earth in those

260Book   of Genesis 16:15-16, 21:3-5

days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare
children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.261

14:1 Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any
baldness between your eyes for the dead. 14:2 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy
God, and the LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the nations
that are upon the earth.262

1:10 Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be
measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them,
Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God.263

1:6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD,
and Satan came also among them.264

38:7 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?265

Most important is how Jesus used the expression “sons of God” or “children of God”:

5:9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.266

20:34 And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in
marriage: 20:35 But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the
resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: 20:36 Neither can they die
any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of
the resurrection.267

The purpose in citing all of these Scriptural verses on the “sons” and “children” of God is to demonstrate that the
expression that is so often translated as “only begotten son of God” could not possibly be meant to be understood
literally, inasmuch as it would then conflict with the many references to other “sons” and “children” of God in the
New and Old Testament. If it were to mean “unique” or “without equal” in the context in which John speaks in
his Gospel and his Epistle, then it is consistent with Scriptural testimony, and is corroborated by the Bahá’í texts.

\[267\] Gospel of Luke, 20:34-36

Shoghi Effendi indicated through his secretary:

As regards to your questions concerning the station of Jesus Christ, and His return as explained
in the Gospel. It is true that Jesus referred to Himself as the Son of God, but this, as explained by
Bahá'u'lláh in the 'Íqán, does not indicate any Physical relationship whatever. Its meaning is
entirely spiritual and points to the close relationship existing between Him and the Almighty
God. Nor does it necessarily indicate any inherent superiority in the station of Jesus over other
Prophets and Messengers. As far as their spiritual nature is concerned all Prophets can be
regarded as Sons of God, as they all reflect His light, though not in an equal measure, and this
difference in reflection is due to the conditions and circumstances under which they appear.268

Regarding the passage you enclosed about the Qur'án: In reality there is no contradiction at all;
when the Qur'án denies Christ is the Son of God it is not refuting His Words but the false
interpretation of them made by the Christians who read into them a relationship of an almost
corporeal nature, whereas Almighty God has no parents or offspring. What is meant by Christ, is
His spirit's relation to the Infinite Spirit, and this the Qur'án does not deny. It is in a sense
attributable -- this kind of Sonship -- to all the Prophets.269

Our perusal of the Gospel verses that refer to the “sons” and “children” of
God, as well as to the “only begotten Son of God” in reference to Jesus indicates that the Bahá’í view is in harmony
with the text. It is not in harmony with certain doctrines of particular Christian theologians and denominations,
including traditional Roman Catholics and Protestants, who restrict the meaning of “son of God” to Jesus Christ.

THE GENEALOGY OF JESUS

The Gospel of Matthew270 opens with a genealogy of Jesus of Nazareth, and likewise the Gospel of Luke271, with
an alternative genealogy. Both genealogies trace the bloodline of Joseph, the stepfather, the adoptive father of Jesus,
saying nothing about the forebears of Mary, His mother. Notwithstanding this, there is no statement from any of the
Bahá’í authorities with regard to the ancestors of Joseph, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá makes the following statement272:

Besides this, an especial blessing is conferred on some families and some generations. Thus it is
an especial blessing that from among the descendants of Abraham should have come all the

272‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, p. 213

Prophets of the children of Israel. This is a blessing that God has granted to this descent: to
Moses from His father and mother, to Christ from His mother's line…

Now how would ‘Abdu’l-Bahá come to the conclusion that Mary, mother of Jesus was descended from Abraham?
The First Book of Chronicles, Chapters 1:34 to 6:3 (reiterated 23:13) identifies Amram as the descendant of
Abraham. According to the same book, verses 6:3 and 23:13, as well as Exodus 6:20 and Numbers 26:59,
Amram was the father of Aaron (as well as Moses and Miriam). The Gospel of Luke 1:5 indicates that Elizabeth,
the wife of Zacharias and mother of John the Baptist was “of the daughters of Aaron” and verse 1:36
has the angel speaks to Mary saying “behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a
son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.”

Was Mary likewise a descendant of Aaron, and hence of Amram and Abraham? This is not completely clear from
the text of the Gospels. But not so in the Qur’an. There we read, in Surah 3:35-36, that Mary was the daughter of
a “woman of ‘Imran” and in Surah 66:12, Mary herself is called “the daughter of ‘Imran”. In one of the non-
canonical gospels, the Protoevangelium of James273, Joachim is the name of the father of Mary, and he is said to
have been of “the house of Amram”. Hence, a Christian non-canonical gospel and the Qur’an both identify Mary
as being a descendant of Amram, which would make her also among the progeny of Abraham. This identification of
Mary rather than Joseph as the descendant of Abraham, and a bloodline through the maternal rather than the
paternal line is harmonious with Christian and Islamic tradition. It is also in agreement with Jewish tradition.
“All branches of Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism today, maintain that the halakhic rules (ie.
matrilineal descent) are valid and binding…rabbis have pointed to Deuteronomy 7:3-4 and Ezra 10:3 as implicit
sources”274 and those sources read as follows:

7:3 neither shalt thou make marriages with them [7:1 the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the
Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite]: thy daughter
thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son. 7:4 For he will
turn away thy son from following Me, that they may serve other gods; so will the anger of the
LORD be kindled against you, and He will destroy thee quickly. (Deuteronomy)

10:2 And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra: 'We
have broken faith with our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land; yet
now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing. 10:3 Now therefore let us make a covenant
with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of
the LORD, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done
according to the law. 10:4 Arise; for the matter belongeth unto thee, and we are with thee; be of
good courage, and do it.' (Ezra)

273Also    called the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew

\[274\] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_is_a_Jew%3F

While intermarriage of Israelites with other nations often occurred throughout the span of time reported in the Bible,
and in the two millennia since the Biblical text has been “closed”, nevertheless the rabbis sought to curtail this
practice, which resulted in the assimilation of these families to the dominant culture and their loss to the Jewish
community…and have continued to do so to this day. The determination of Jewish identity by matrilineal descent
was thus a well-established phenomenon in the time of Jesus, and hence His descent from Abraham through His
mother, as attested by the Protoevangelium of James and the Qur’an, and noted also by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is at least as
likely as the paternal descent from Abraham through His step-father, particularly inasmuch as the two accounts of
the latter differ in their details, and apply to a person with whom Jesus had in fact no biological relationship.
Likewise, if Jesus was a “son of David”, as was attested by some in His own time and reported in the Gospels,
then, following the same principle, it was most likely through His maternal line.

The Gospel of Luke indicates that Joseph brought his pregnant wife to Jerusalem because he was of Davidic
descent:

2:4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city
of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) 2:5 To
be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.

It is reported Joseph was descended from David, but inasmuch as Jesus was not fathered by Joseph therefore Jesus
was not a “son of David” because of Joseph’s bloodline. This is further attested by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s indication that
Bahá’u’llah rather than Jesus fulfilled the requirements of the expected Maschiach ben David, the Messianic
descendant of King David promised by the Hebrew prophets:

In Isaiah, chapter 11, verses 1 to 10, it is said: "And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem
of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots: And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him,
the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge
and of the fear of the Lord; And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord:
and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears: But
with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and
he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the
wicked. And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.
The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf
and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and
the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the
ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his
hand on the cockatrice' den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain: for the
earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea."

But "they shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of
the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea." These conditions did not prevail in the
time of the manifestation of Christ; for until today various and antagonistic nations exist in the
world: very few acknowledge the God of Israel, and the greater number are without the
knowledge of God. In the same way, universal peace did not come into existence in the time of
Christ -- that is to say, between the antagonistic and hostile nations there was neither peace nor
concord, disputes and disagreements did not cease, and reconciliation and sincerity did not
appear. So, even at this day, among the Christian sects and nations themselves, enmity, hatred
and the most violent hostility are met with.

But these verses apply word for word to Bahá'u'lláh. Likewise in this marvelous cycle the
earth will be transformed, and the world of humanity arrayed in tranquillity and beauty.
Disputes, quarrels and murders will be replaced by peace, truth and concord; among the nations,
peoples, races and countries, love and amity will appear. Cooperation and union will be
established, and finally war will be entirely suppressed. When the laws of the Most Holy Book are
enforced, contentions and disputes will find a final sentence of absolute justice before a general
tribunal of the nations and kingdoms, and the difficulties that appear will be solved. The five
continents of the world will form but one, the numerous nations will become one, the surface of
the earth will become one land, and mankind will be a single community. The relations between
the countries -- the mingling, union and friendship of the peoples and communities -- will reach
to such a degree that the human race will be like one family and kindred. The light of heavenly
love will shine, and the darkness of enmity and hatred will be dispelled from the world. Universal
peace will raise its tent in the center of the earth, and the blessed Tree of Life will grow and
spread to such an extent that it will overshadow the East and the West. Strong and weak, rich
and poor, antagonistic sects and hostile nations -- which are like the wolf and the lamb, the
leopard and kid, the lion and the calf -- will act toward each other with the most complete love,
friendship, justice and equity. The world will be filled with science, with the knowledge of the
reality of the mysteries of beings, and with the knowledge of God.275

Shoghi Effendi reiterates that it was Bahá’u’llah rather than Jesus Who fulfilled the prophecies in the Book of
Isaiah, cited in Some Answered Questions, as well as others276:

To Him Isaiah, the greatest of the Jewish prophets, had alluded as the "Glory of the Lord," the
"Everlasting Father,"277 the "Prince of Peace,"278 the "Wonderful,"279 the "Counsellor,"280 the

"Rod come forth out of the stem of Jesse"281 and the "Branch grown out of His roots,"282 Who
"shall be established upon the throne of David,"283 Who "will come with strong hand,"284 Who
"shall judge among the nations,"285 Who "shall smite the earth with the rod of His mouth, and
with the breath of His lips slay the wicked,"286 and Who "shall assemble the outcasts of Israel,
and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth."287

Shoghi Effendi likewise asserts that Bahá’u’llah was descended from Jesse, the father of David:

He derived His descent, on the one hand, from Abraham (the Father of the Faithful) through his
wife Katurah, and on the other from Zoroaster, as well as from Yazdigird, the last king of the
Sasaniyan dynasty. He was moreover a descendant of Jesse…288

JOHN THE BAPTIST

Having examined the text on the cosmic Jesus which opens the Gospel of John, and the genealogies that are found in
the first chapter of the Gospel of Matthew and the third chapter of the Gospel of Luke, we will now consider the
depiction of John the Baptist from the time of His conception through His annunciation of Jesus, as reported in all
four canonical Gospels, and then consider these stories in light of the references thereto in the Qur’an and the Bahá’í
source texts.

We begin with the prophecy of the appearance of John the Baptist, found in the Book of Isaiah289:

The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make
his paths straight in the desert.

This verse is stated to have been fulfilled by John the Baptist in all of the canonical Gospels290, and it is alluded to in
the references to Him in the Writings of Bahá’u’llah291:

280Ibid.
282Ibid.
288Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p. 94
290Gospels of Matthew 3:3; Mark 1:3; Luke 3:4; John 1:23
291 Bahá’u’lláh, The Kitab-i-Iqan, pp. 64-65

As to the sign in the invisible heaven -- the heaven of divine knowledge and understanding -- it was
Yahya, son of Zachariah, who gave unto the people the tidings of the Manifestation of Jesus. Even
as He hath revealed: "God announceth Yahya to thee, who shall bear witness unto the Word from
God, and a great one and chaste."292 By the term "Word" is meant Jesus, Whose coming Yahya
foretold. Moreover, in the heavenly Scriptures it is written: "John the Baptist was preaching in the
wilderness of Judea, and saying, Repent ye: for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand."293 By John is
meant Yahya.294

O followers of the Son! We have once again sent John unto you295, and He, verily, hath cried out in
the wilderness of the Bayan: O peoples of the world! Cleanse your eyes! The Day whereon ye can
behold the Promised One and attain unto Him hath drawn nigh! O followers of the Gospel! Prepare
the way! The Day of the advent of the Glorious Lord is at hand! Make ready to enter the Kingdom.
Thus hath it been ordained by God, He Who causeth the dawn to break.296

Say, did ye not hearken to the Voice of the Crier, calling aloud in the wilderness of the Bayan,
bearing unto you the glad-tidings of the coming of your Lord, the All-Merciful? Lo! He is come in
the sheltering shadow of Testimony, invested with conclusive proof and evidence, and those who
truly believe in Him regard His presence as the embodiment of the Kingdom of God. Blessed is the
man who turneth towards Him, and woe betide such as deny or doubt Him.297

Verily, the Crier hath cried out, when the promised time came, and they that have recognized the
splendors of Sinai have swooned away in the wilderness of hesitation, before the awful majesty of thy
Lord, the Lord of creation.298

Another prophetic verse which is fulfilled by John the Baptist, as affirmed by the synoptic Gospels299 is from the Book of
Malachi300:

I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me…

A third prophetic verse also from the Book of Malachi301, is cited in two of the synoptic Gospels302:
292Qur'án  3:39
294The first reader of Kitab-i-Iqan was a Muslim, who knew John the Baptist by His name in the Qur’an,

Yahya, and where His father’s name is Zachariah.
295According to Bahá’í teaching, the Bab was the return of John the Baptist, even as Bahá’u’lláh was the

I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of
the Lord…

‘Abdu’l-Bahá affirms that John the Baptist was the return of Elijah303, and at a later juncture in this narrative we will
examine His explanation of the way in which Elijah returned in John:

Therefore, John the Baptist was the promised Elias.304

In the Gospel it says that John, the son of Zacharias, is Elias.305

Christ announced that John the Baptist was Elias, who was to come before Christ…306

Elijah also was expected to come from heaven, and the Christ said, "Elijah is none other than John
the Baptist."307

Shoghi Effendi reminds us that the Báb was also the return of Elijah:

…the "Return of Elijah" anticipated by the Jews…308

…the Báb -- Whose advent marks the return of the Prophet Elijah…309

Two of the persons depicted in the story of John the Baptists are His mother and His father. The Bahá’í source texts
make no reference to His mother, but do mention His father, and in a manner that warrants our attention. According to
the Book of Exodus310, Elisheva311 was the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Naashon, and the wife of Aaron, and
her ancestors and descendants are cited in the Book of Ruth312 and the Gospel of Matthew.313 In the Gospel of Luke,
Elizabeth314 is a cousin of Mary315, a descendant of Aaron316, and the wife of Zacharias317. In that same Gospel, she

is depicted as infertile318 and therefore childless, and aged319. In the Qur’an, it is related that the wife of Zachariah is
infertile320 and therefore childless321. The father of John is named Zacharias322, and this is a well known name found
many times in the historical accounts of the Bible323, and according to the Gospel of Luke he was a priest [cohen]324; he
burned incense in the temple of the Lord325; he was descended from Abia326; he was elderly327 and righteous before God,
obeying all His commandments328. In the Qur’an, Zakariyya the father of Yahya is elderly329, the servant of God330,
and among the virtuous ones [min al-Salihiina]331. The portraits are identical in the Gospel of Luke and the Qur’an. In
the Bahá’í Writings Zacharias is depicted in a few passages. In Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, Bahá’u’llah refers to

John as the son of Zacharias332, and in Some Answered Questions, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says three times over in the same
paragraph that John was the son of Zacharias333.

We next come to the annunciation of John, the announcement to His parents that He will be born to them. The Gospel
of Luke tells us that Zacharias prays for a child334; that an angel of the Lord appears to Zacharias in the temple of the
Lord, at the side of the altar of incense335; that the angel of the Lord is named Gabriel336; that the angel of the Lord
promises Zacharias: (1)a son, to be named John (Luke 1:13), that (2)Zacharias will be joyful, and many will rejoice
at the birth of his son(Luke 1:14), that (3)his son will be great in the sight of the Lord (Luke 1:15), that (4)his son
will not drink wine, strong drink (Luke 1:15), that (5)his son will be filled with Holy Spirit, from the womb (Luke
1:15), that (6)he ill turn many of children of Israel to God (Luke 1:16), that (7)he will go forth in the spirit and
power of Elijah, to ready the people for the Lord (Luke 1:17). Zacharias protests to Gabriel that this is impossible
(1:18), and Gabriel replies that Zacharias will be rendered dumb until these promises are fulfilled (Luke 1:20). The
Qur’an tell substantially the very same story: Zakariyya prays for pure offspring (3:38; 19:4-6;         21:89);         the
angels of the Lord reply to him as he stands praying in the shrine [al-mihraabi] (3:39); he receives a reply from God
(19:7; 21:89) while Zakariyya is in the shrine [al-mihraabi] (19:11); and the reply of the Lord promises Zakariyya:
(1)a son, to be named John [yahya] (3:39; 19:7; 21:90), that (2)his son will testify to the truth of the word from
God, that (3)his son will be           noble, that (4)his son will be chaste, that (5)his son will be a prophet, that (6)his
son will be among the righteous [min al-Salihiina] (3:39). Zakariyya is incredulous (3:40; 19:8), and he asks for a
token, a sign [aj'al] (3:41; 19:10), and the reply he receives is that the token/sign for him will be that he will not be
able to speak for three days and three          nights (3:41; 19:10), and Zakariyya is instructed to remember [adhkur]
the Lord in the evening and early morning (3:41), and apparently he was not struck dumb immediately because
Zakariyya comes out of the shrine (al-mihraabi] and instructs the people to praise God morning and evening (19:11).

After the annunciation, Zacharius returns to his own house from the        temple of the Lord, and John is conceived
(Luke 1:23). The Qur’an likewise says that God cured Zakariyya’s wife of infertility and granted him a son (21:90).
The Gospel of Luke goes into some detail about the pregnancy of John’s mother, about His birth and His
circumcision…none of which details are described in the Qur’an or the Bahá’í source texts. It is telling that, of all of the
canonical Gospels only the Gospel of Luke set forth these details. Could it be because the author of this Gospel was a
physician?337 In any case, the principal events recounted in the Gospel of Luke are briefly repeated here: Elizabeth hides
herself for five months (Luke 1:24); Mary visits Elizabeth during her pregnancy (Luke 1:39-56), arriving in her sixth
month (Luke 1:26,36); when Elizabeth hears the salutation of Mary, her cousin, her Báby John leaps in her womb
and she is filled with the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:41); Elizabeth recognizes Mary as the mother of the Lord (Luke 1:42-
45); Mary recites the prayer known as the magnificat (Luke 1:46-55); Mary abides with Elizabeth for three months
and then returns to her home, prior to the birth of Jesus (Luke 1:56); Elizabeth births her son after Mary departs for

337Paul’s Epistle to the Colossians 4:14

her homeland (Luke 1:57); her neighbors and cousins rejoice (Luke 1:58); and “on the eighth day they
came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his
father. And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John. And
they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.” (Luke 1:59-
60); “And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called. And he asked
for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.”
(Luke 1:59-63); “And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he
spake [Zacharias], and praised God.” (Luke 1:64); the news of the birth and of all the signs attending it
was spread throughout Judea (Luke 1:65-66); Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied regarding the
coming of the Lord (savior from the house of David), and his son John as the prophet of the Highest (Luke 1:68-79)

The Gospel of Luke then says that “the child John grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in
the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel” (Luke 1:80), and with that the Gospel of Luke
leaves off with the detailed descriptions….and, surprise of surprises, the Qur’an starts up! John manifests divine
wisdom while yet a child and tenderness of heart and purity, piety, is dutiful towards his parents, not haughty and
rebellious, and a man of peace his whole life long (19:12-15); he is described as vying with his father Zacharias in
good works, and reported that both father and son called upon God in hope and fear and humbled themselves before God
(21:90).

Now that we reach the maturity of John, and the start of His prophetic ministry, the other canonical Gospels begin to
participate in telling the story. The Gospel of Luke tells us that Zacharias prophesied that his son John would be a
prophet (Luke 1:76), and that the Word of God came to John in the wilderness in the fifteenth year of the reign of
Tiberius Caesar (Luke 3:1-2). He is described as preaching in the wilderness of Judaea (Matthew 3:1; Mark 1:4;
Luke 3:2); in country around Jordan (Luke 3:3); in Bethabara beyond Jordan (John 1:28). He baptizes with water
(Matthew 3:11; Mark 1:8; John 1:26,31); baptizes in Jordan (Matthew 3:6; Mark 1:5,9); baptizes unto
repentance (Matthew 3:11; Mark 1:4), with confession of sins (Matthew 3:6; Mark 1:5), for the remission of sins
(Mark 1:4); all of Jerusalem and Judaea are baptized (Matthew 3:5; Mark 1:5); those of the region around Jordan
are baptized (Matthew 3:5-6). John is baptizing in “Aenon near to Salim” at the same time as Jesus is
baptizing in Judaea (John 3:22-23). His raiment is of camel's hair (Matthew 3:4; Mark 1:6); and a leather girdle
(Matthew 3:4), girdle of skin (Mark 1:6); not soft raiment as in the king's houses (Matt 11:8). His foods are locusts
and wild honey (Matthew 3:4; Mark 1:6). Priests and Levites come from Jerusalem to ask John who he is, and he
indicates that he is not Christ, not Elias and not the promised prophet (John 1:19-21). The common folk also wonder
if he is the promised Christ (Luke 3:15). John reproves the tetrarch of Galilee, King Herod Antipas for having taken his
brother Philip's wife, Herodias, and for his other evil actions (Matt 14:3-4; Mark 6:17-19; Luke 3:19). Herod
Antipas fears and admires John (Mark 6:20, 26), and fears the common folk because they believe John to be a prophet
(Matt 14:5, 21:26; Luke 20:6).

John is cast into prison because of his criticism of the King’s marriage (Matthew 4:12, 11:1, 14:3; Mark 1:14,
6:17; Luke 3:20). When in prison, John sends two of His disciples to Jesus (Matthew 11:2-6):

11:2 Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his
disciples, 11:3 And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for
another? 11:4 Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those
things which ye do hear and see: 11:5 The blind receive their sight, and the lame
walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the
poor have the gospel preached to them. 11:6 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not
be offended in me.

Considering that according to all of the canonical Gospels, John was aware of the prophetic identity, the station of Jesus
at the time of His baptism, this story may seem peculiar at first. But if this is the way in which John provided for his
emissaries to learn of the ministry of Jesus, it makes much more sense. Either John did not know the full station of Jesus
and wanted to be reassured, which is possible but unlikely inasmuch as John heard the voice of God calling from heaven,
and John called Jesus the Lamb of God; or John wanted His disciples to hear the claims of Jesus firsthand, and to
know from Jesus Himself that He was the one promised by John and by all the Hebrew prophets who preceded Him.

While John was in prison, Salome, the daughter of Herodias, wife of Herod Antipas (and formerly wife of Phillip) was
asked to dance by her stepfather at his birthday feast, and she agreed to do so provided that he granted her wish. He
swore he would grant her wish, and she forthwith asked for John's head (Matt 14:8; Mark 6:24). Herod had John
beheaded (Matt 14:10-11; Mark 6:27-28). John's disciples buried his body (Matt 14:12; Mark 6:29), and went
and told Jesus (Matt 14:12).

Bahá’u’llah referred to Bethlehem as the birth place of Jesus Christ, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refers to him as Jesus of
Nazareth in some of his talks:

In like manner, when the hour of the Revelation of Jesus drew nigh, a few of the Magi, aware
that the star of Jesus had appeared in heaven, sought and followed it, till they came unto the city
which was the seat of the Kingdom of Herod. The sway of his sovereignty in those days
embraced the whole of that land.

These Magi said: "Where is He that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen His star in the
east and are come to worship Him!"[Matthew 2:2] When they had searched, they found out that
in Bethlehem, in the land of Judea, the Child had been born. This was the sign that was
manifested in the visible heaven. As to the sign in the invisible heaven -- the heaven of divine
knowledge and understanding -- it was Yahya, son of Zachariah, who gave unto the people the
tidings of the Manifestation of Jesus. Even as He hath revealed: "God announceth Yahya to thee,
who shall bear witness unto the Word from God, and a great one and chaste."[Qur’an 3:39] By
the term "Word" is meant Jesus, Whose coming Yahya foretold. Moreover, in the heavenly
Scriptures it is written: "John the Baptist was preaching in the wilderness of Judea, and saying,

Repent ye: for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand."[Matthew 3:1-2] By John is meant Yahya.
(Bahá'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, pp. 64-65)

Bethlehem is astir with the Breeze of God. We hear her voice saying: 'O most generous Lord!
Where is Thy great glory established? The sweet savours of Thy presence have quickened me,
after I had melted in my separation from Thee. Praised be Thou in that Thou hast raised the
veils, and come with power in evident glory.' We called unto her from behind the Tabernacle of
Majesty and Grandeur: 'O Bethlehem! This Light hath risen in the orient, and travelled towards
the occident, until it reached thee in the evening of its life. Tell Me then: Do the sons recognize
the Father, and acknowledge Him, or do they deny Him, even as the people aforetime denied
Him (Jesus)?' Whereupon she cried out saying: 'Thou art, in truth, the All-Knowing, the Best-
Informed.' Verily, We behold all created things moved to bear witness unto Us. Some know Us
and bear witness, while the majority bear witness, yet know Us not. (Bahá'u'llah, Tablets of
Bahá'u'llah, pp. 14-15)

Therefore, they were deprived of the bounties of Christ, whereas if they had forsaken imitations
and investigated the reality of the Messiah, they would have surely been guided to believing in
Him. Instead of this they said, "We have heard from our fathers and have read in the Old
Testament that Christ must come from an unknown place; now we find that this one has come
from Nazareth." Steeped in the literal interpretation and imitating the beliefs of fathers and
ancestors, they failed to understand the fact that although the body of Jesus came from Nazareth,
the reality of the Christ came from the unknown place of the divine Kingdom. (‘Abdu'l-Bahá, The
Promulgation of Universal Peace, pp. 291-292)

And now, do you consider these great men of France greater than Jesus of Nazareth? It is evident
that in comparison with Jesus Christ they are as nothing. Consider the grandeur and majesty of
Jesus in contrast with such men as we have mentioned. Consider Him from the standpoint of
fame and renown. Where is the station of Christ, and where is their station? What comparison is
there? In reality, Christ is incomparable. What harm, then, could come from your declaration
that Jesus of Nazareth was a great man of Israelitish birth and, therefore, we love Him? (‘Abdu'l-
Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 414)

The philosophers of the times, Romans and Greeks, wrote against Christ. Even the kings wrote
books of abuse, calumny and contempt. One of these kings was a Caesar. He was also a
philosopher. In his book he says, concerning the people of Christ, "The most degraded of people
are the Christians. The most immoral of the people of this time are the Christians. Jesus of
Nazareth has led them astray. O people! If you wish to know who Jesus is and what Christian

means, go and ask his relatives. Go and ask the Jews who know him. See what a bad person he is,
how degraded he is." There were many similar accounts. But remember that these statements did
not affect the cause of Christianity. On the contrary, Christianity advanced daily in power and
potency. (‘Abdu'l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 429)

Bahá’u’llah refers to the flight of Jesus with his parents from the persecution of King Herod to another land in Epistle to
the Son of the Wolf (p. 58). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refers to this flight in Ten Days in the Light of Acca (p. 7), indicating in
the same collection of pilgrim notes that this is elaborated in one of the lost Gospels…originally he says there were 50
Gospels. Shoghi Effendi also refers to the flight in God Passes By (p. 107).

THE APOSTLES OF JESUS

There are very few references to and quotations from the Acts and Epistles of the disciples of Jesus to be found
interspersed among the talks and writings of the Central Figures and Guardian of the Faith. There are many more
citations from the Book of Revelation than there are for the entirety of this section of the New Testament, even
though the former is only 15 pages in length while the latter is 118 pages long, six more pages than the four
canonical Gospels. This may be reflect the interests of the Western (Christian) believers to some degree, for if they
asked many questions about the interpretation of the Book of Revelation and few questions about the Acts and
Epistles this would explain the inverse ratio. However, it seems also likely that these few references also reflected the
priorities of the Bahá’í leadership, and their conception of which of the contents of the New Testament were of the
most decided value for modern readers.

Both Peter and Paul come in for praise from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

One's conduct must be like the conduct of Paul, and one's faith similar to that of Peter. This
musk-scented breeze shall perfume the nostrils of the people of the world, and this spirit shall
resuscitate the dead.338

I have the utmost love for thee and I ask God that thou mayest become assisted in the world and
in the Kingdom and precede Paul and Peter in spreading the Word of God and diffusing the
fragrances of God and become a manifest ensign in the regions of America.339

Nevertheless, Bahá’u’llah affirms the primacy of Peter rather than that of Paul:

There is certainly an element of truth at the bases of the organizations of the Christian Church.
For instance, the primacy of Peter and his right to succession after Jesus have been established by
the latter, though only orally and not in an explicit and definite language. The real reason why
Christ did not make some explicit statement regarding His succession is not known, and cannot
be known. For how can we, poor humans, claim to unravel the mysteries of God's mind and
purpose, and to grasp the inscrutable Dispensations of His Providence. The utmost we can do is
to give some explanations, but these must necessarily fail to give the fundamental reason to the
problem we seek to solve. Now with regard to your questions. First concerning the statement of
Jesus Christ 'Thou art Peter and upon this rock etc.'; this saying of Jesus establishes beyond any
doubt the primacy of Peter and also the principle of succession, but is not explicit enough

338‘Abdu’l-Bahá,    Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, pp. 223-224

\[339\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, v2, p. 471

regarding the nature and functioning of the Church itself. The Catholics have read too much
into the statement, and derived from it certain conclusions which are quite unjustifiable.340

As to the position of Christianity, let it be stated without any hesitation or equivocation that its
Divine origin is unconditionally acknowledged, that the Sonship and Divinity of Jesus Christ are
fearlessly asserted, that the Divine inspiration of the Gospel is fully recognized, that the reality of
the mystery of the Immaculacy of the Virgin Mary is confessed, and the primacy of Peter, the
Prince of the Apostles, is upheld and defended. The Founder of the Christian Faith is designated
by Bahá'u'lláh as the 'Spirit of God', is proclaimed as the One Who 'appeared out of the breath of
the Holy Ghost', and is even extolled as the 'Essence of the Spirit'. His mother is described as
'that veiled and immortal, that most beauteous countenance', and the station of her Son
eulogized as a 'station which hath been exalted above the imaginings of all that dwell on earth,'
whilst Peter is recognized as one whom God has caused 'the mysteries of wisdom and of
utterance of flow out of his mouth.'341

While Peter is affirmed as the Prince of the Apostles, upon which the Church has been established, his Epistles are
not quoted in any of the Bahá’í Writings, while there are a few citations from the Epistles of Paul, which comprise
74 out of the 118 pages of the Acts and Epistles. These are cited below. First there is one reference to the Epistle to
the Romans of Paul, ironically in the last book revealed by Bahá’u’llah, the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, whose
first reader was a fanatical enemy of the Bahá’ís and one who no doubt considered the entirety of the New
Testament unreliable, corrupted and thus without divine authority.

In the Epistle to the Romans Saint Paul hath written: "Let every soul be subject unto the higher
powers. For there is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever
therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God." And further: "For he is the
minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil." He saith that the
appearance of the kings, and their majesty and power are of God.

Moreover, in the traditions of old, references have been made which the divines have
seen and heard. We beseech God -- blessed and glorified be He -- to aid thee, O Shaykh, to lay
fast hold on that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the bounty of God, the Lord of
the worlds. The divines must needs unite with His Majesty, the Shah, and cleave unto that which
will insure the protection, the security, the welfare and prosperity of men. A just king enjoyeth
nearer access unto God than anyone. Unto this testifieth He Who speaketh in His Most Great

Prison. God! There is none other God but Him, the One, the Incomparable, the Almighty, the
All-Knowing, the All-Wise.342

Question. -- Is the ablution of baptism useful and necessary, or is it useless and unnecessary? In the
first case, if it is useful, why was it abrogated? And in the second case, if it is useless, why did John
practice it?

Answer. -- The change in conditions, alterations and transformations are necessities of the essence of
beings, and essential necessities cannot be separated from the reality of things. So it is absolutely
impossible to separate heat from fire, humidity from water, or light from the sun, for they are
essential necessities. As the change and alteration of conditions are necessities for beings, so laws also
are changed and altered in accordance with the changes and alterations of the times. For example,
in the time of Moses, His Law was conformed and adapted to the conditions of the time; but in the
days of Christ these conditions had changed and altered to such an extent that the Mosaic Law was
no longer suited and adapted to the needs of mankind; and it was, therefore, abrogated. Thus it was
that Christ broke the Sabbath and forbade divorce. After Christ four disciples, among whom were
Peter and Paul, permitted the use of animal food forbidden by the Bible, except the eating of
those animals which had been strangled, or which were sacrificed to idols, and of blood.343 They
also forbade fornication. They maintained these four commandments. Afterward, Paul permitted
even the eating of strangled animals, those sacrificed to idols, and blood, and only maintained the
prohibition of fornication. So in chapter 14, verse 14 of his Epistle to the Romans, Paul writes: "I
know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself:
but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean."

Also in the Epistle of Paul to Titus, chapter 1, verse 15: "Unto the pure all things are
pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their
mind and conscience is defiled." Now this change, these alterations and this abrogation are
due to the impossibility of comparing the time of Christ with that of Moses. The conditions and
requirements in the later period were entirely changed and altered. The former laws were,
therefore, abrogated.

The existence of the world may be compared to that of a man, and the Prophets and
Messengers of God to skillful doctors. The human being cannot remain in one condition: different
maladies occur which have each a special remedy. The skillful physician does not give the same
medicine to cure each disease and each malady, but he changes remedies and medicines according
to the different necessities of the diseases and constitutions. One person may have a severe illness

caused by fever, and the skilled doctor will give him cooling remedies; and when at some other time
the condition of this person has changed, and fever is replaced by chills, without doubt the skilled
doctor will discard cooling medicine and permit the use of heating drugs. This change and alteration
is required by the condition of the patient and is an evident proof of the skill of the physician.

Consider, could the Law of the Old Testament be enforced at this epoch and time? No, in
the name of God! it would be impossible and impracticable; therefore, most certainly God
abrogated the laws of the Old Testament at the time of Christ. Reflect, also, that baptism in the days
of John the Baptist was used to awaken and admonish the people to repent from all sin, and to
watch for the appearance of the Kingdom of Christ. But at present in Asia, the Catholics and the
Orthodox Church plunge newly born children into water mixed with olive oil, and many of them
become ill from the shock; at the time of baptism they struggle and become agitated. In other places,
the clergy sprinkle the water of baptism on the forehead. But neither from the first form nor from
the second do the children derive any spiritual benefit. Then what result is obtained from this form?
Other peoples are amazed and wonder why the infant is plunged into the water, since this is neither
the cause of the spiritual awakening of the child, nor of its faith or conversion, but it is only a custom
which is followed. In the time of John the Baptist it was not so; no, at first John used to exhort the
people, and to guide them to repentance from sin, and to fill them with the desire to await the
manifestation of Christ. Whoever received the ablution of baptism, and repented of sins in absolute
humility and meekness, would also purify and cleanse his body from outward impurities. With
perfect yearning, night and day, he would constantly wait for the manifestation of Christ, and the
entrance to the Kingdom of the Spirit of God.344

To recapitulate: our meaning is that the change and modification of conditions, and the
altered requirements of different centuries and times, are the cause of the abrogation of laws. For a
time comes when these laws are no longer suitably adapted to conditions. Consider how very
different are the requirements of the first centuries, of the Middle Ages, and of modern times. Is it
possible that the laws of the first centuries could be enforced at present? It is evident that it would be
impossible and impracticable. In the same manner, after the lapse of a few centuries, the
requirements of the present time will not be the same as those of the future, and certainly there will
be change and alteration. In Europe the laws are unceasingly altered and modified; in bygone years,
how many laws existed in the organizations and systems of Europe, which are now abrogated!
These changes and alterations are due to the variation and mutation of thought, conditions and
customs. If it were not so, the prosperity of the world of humanity would be wrecked.

For example, there is in the Pentateuch a law that if anyone break the Sabbath, he shall be
put to death. Moreover, there are ten sentences of death in the Pentateuch. Would it be possible to

\[344\] I.e., of Christ, Whom the Muslims frequently designate by the title of Ruhu'llah, the Spirit of God.

keep these laws in our time? It is clear that it would be absolutely impossible. Consequently, there
are changes and modifications in the laws, and these are a sufficient proof of the supreme wisdom of
God.

This subject needs deep thought. Then the cause of these changes will be evident and apparent.
Blessed are those who reflect!345

Question. -- In verse 22 of chapter 15 of 1 Corinthians it is written: "For as in Adam all die,
even so in Christ shall all be made alive." What is the meaning of these words?

Answer. -- Know that there are two natures in man: the physical nature and the spiritual nature.
The physical nature is inherited from Adam, and the spiritual nature is inherited from the Reality of
the Word of God, which is the spirituality of Christ. The physical nature is born of Adam, but the
spiritual nature is born from the bounty of the Holy Spirit. The first is the source of all imperfection;
the second is the source of all perfection.

The Christ sacrificed Himself so that men might be freed from the imperfections of the
physical nature and might become possessed of the virtues of the spiritual nature. This spiritual
nature, which came into existence through the bounty of the Divine Reality, is the union of all
perfections and appears through the breath of the Holy Spirit. It is the divine perfections; it is light,
spirituality, guidance, exaltation, high aspiration, justice, love, grace, kindness to all, philanthropy,
the essence of life. It is the reflection of the splendor of the Sun of Reality.

The Christ is the central point of the Holy Spirit: He is born of the Holy Spirit; He is raised
up by the Holy Spirit; He is the descendant of the Holy Spirit -- that is to say, that the Reality of
Christ does not descend from Adam; no, it is born of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, this verse in
Corinthians, "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive," means,
according to this terminology, that Adam346 is the father of man -- that is to say, He is the cause of
the physical life of mankind; His was the physical fatherhood. He is a living soul, but He is not the
giver of spiritual life, whereas Christ is the cause of the spiritual life of man, and with regard to the
spirit, His was the spiritual fatherhood. Adam is a living soul; Christ is a quickening spirit.

This physical world of man is subject to the power of the lusts, and sin is the consequence of
this power of the lusts, for it is not subject to the laws of justice and holiness. The body of man is a
captive of nature; it will act in accordance with whatever nature orders. It is, therefore, certain that
sins such as anger, jealousy, dispute, covetousness, avarice, ignorance, prejudice, hatred, pride and
345‘Abdu’l-Bahá,      Some Answered Questions, pp. 93-96

\[346\] Abu'l-bashar, i.e., the father of man, is one of the titles given by the Muslims to Adam.

tyranny exist in the physical world. All these brutal qualities exist in the nature of man. A man who
has not had a spiritual education is a brute. Like the savages of Africa, whose actions, habits and
morals are purely sensual, they act according to the demands of nature to such a degree that they
rend and eat one another. Thus it is evident that the physical world of man is a world of sin. In this
physical world man is not distinguished from the animal.

All sin comes from the demands of nature, and these demands, which arise from the physical
qualities, are not sins with respect to the animals, while for man they are sin. The animal is the
source of imperfections, such as anger, sensuality, jealousy, avarice, cruelty, pride: all these defects
are found in animals but do not constitute sins. But in man they are sins.

Adam is the cause of man's physical life; but the Reality of Christ -- that is to say, the Word
of God -- is the cause of spiritual life. It is "a quickening spirit," meaning that all the imperfections
which come from the requirements of the physical life of man are transformed into human
perfections by the teachings and education of that spirit. Therefore, Christ was a quickening spirit,
and the cause of life in all mankind.

Adam was the cause of physical life, and as the physical world of man is the world of imperfections,
and imperfections are the equivalent of death, Paul compared the physical imperfections to death.

But the mass of the Christians believe that, as Adam ate of the forbidden tree, He sinned in
that He disobeyed, and that the disastrous consequences of this disobedience have been transmitted
as a heritage and have remained among His descendants. Hence Adam became the cause of the
death of humanity. This explanation is unreasonable and evidently wrong, for it means that all men,
even the Prophets and the Messengers of God, without committing any sin or fault, but simply
because they are the posterity of Adam, have become without reason guilty sinners, and until the
day of the sacrifice of Christ were held captive in hell in painful torment. This is far from the justice
of God. If Adam was a sinner, what is the sin of Abraham? What is the fault of Isaac, or of Joseph?
Of what is Moses guilty?

But Christ, Who is the Word of God, sacrificed Himself. This has two meanings, an apparent and
an esoteric meaning. The outward meaning is this: Christ's intention was to represent and promote
a Cause which was to educate the human world, to quicken the children of Adam, and to enlighten
all mankind; and since to represent such a great Cause -- a Cause which was antagonistic to all the
people of the world and all the nations and kingdoms -- meant that He would be killed and
crucified, so Christ in proclaiming His mission sacrificed His life. He regarded the cross as a throne,
the wound as a balm, the poison as honey and sugar. He arose to teach and educate men, and so He
sacrificed Himself to give the spirit of life. He perished in body so as to quicken others by the spirit.

The second meaning of sacrifice is this: Christ was like a seed, and this seed sacrificed its own
form so that the tree might grow and develop. Although the form of the seed was destroyed, its
reality became apparent in perfect majesty and beauty in the form of a tree.

The position of Christ was that of absolute perfection; He made His divine perfections shine
like the sun upon all believing souls, and the bounties of the light shone and radiated in the reality of
men. This is why He says: "I am the bread which descended from heaven; whosoever
shall eat of this bread will not die"347 -- that is to say, that whosoever shall partake of this
divine food will attain unto eternal life: that is, every one who partakes of this bounty and receives
these perfections will find eternal life, will obtain preexistent favors, will be freed from the darkness
of error, and will be illuminated by the light of His guidance.

The form of the seed was sacrificed for the tree, but its perfections, because of this sacrifice,
became evident and apparent -- the tree, the branches, the leaves and the blossoms being concealed
in the seed. When the form of the seed was sacrificed, its perfections appeared in the perfect form of
leaves, blossoms and fruits.348

It is said in the New Testament that God is like a potter who makes "one vessel unto honour,
and another unto dishonour."349 Now the dishonored vessel has no right to find fault with
the potter saying, "Why did you not make me a precious cup, which is passed from hand to
hand?" The meaning of this verse is that the states of beings are different. That which is in the
lowest state of existence, like the mineral, has no right to complain, saying, "O God, why have
You not given me the vegetable perfections?" In the same way, the plant has no right to
complain that it has been deprived of the perfections of the animal world. Also it is not befitting
for the animal to complain of the want of the human perfections. No, all these things are perfect
in their own degree, and they must strive after the perfections of their own degree. The inferior
beings, as we have said, have neither the right to, nor the fitness for, the states of the superior
perfections. No, their progress must be in their own state.

Also the inaction or the movement of man depend upon the assistance of God. If he is not
aided, he is not able to do either good or evil. But when the help of existence comes from the
Generous Lord, he is able to do both good and evil; but if the help is cut off, he remains
absolutely helpless. This is why in the Holy Books they speak of the help and assistance of God.
So this condition is like that of a ship which is moved by the power of the wind or steam; if this
power ceases, the ship cannot move at all. Nevertheless, the rudder of the ship turns it to either

\[347\] Gospel of John 6:41, 50, 58

\[348\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, pp. 117-121

349Epistle to the Romans 9:21

side, and the power of the steam moves it in the desired direction. If it is directed to the east, it
goes to the east; or if it is directed to the west, it goes to the west. This motion does not come
from the ship; no, it comes from the wind or the steam.

In the same way, in all the action or inaction of man, he receives power from the help of
God; but the choice of good or evil belongs to the man himself. So if a king should appoint
someone to be the governor of a city, and should grant him the power of authority, and should
show him the paths of justice and injustice according to the laws -- if then this governor should
commit injustice, although he should act by the authority and power of the king, the latter would
be absolved from injustice. But if he should act with justice, he would do it also through the
authority of the king, who would be pleased and satisfied.

That is to say, though the choice of good and evil belongs to man, under all
circumstances he is dependent upon the sustaining help of life, which comes from the
Omnipotent. The Kingdom of God is very great, and all are captives in the grasp of His Power.
The servant cannot do anything by his own will; God is powerful, omnipotent, and the Helper of
all beings.350

In his scriptural lesson this morning the revered doctor read a verse from the Epistle of St. Paul
to the Corinthians, "For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face."351

The light of truth has heretofore been seen dimly through variegated glasses, but now the
splendors of Divinity shall be visible through the translucent mirrors of pure hearts and spirits.
The light of truth is the divine teaching, heavenly instruction, merciful principles and spiritual
civilization. Since my arrival in this country I find that material civilization has progressed
greatly, that commerce has attained the utmost degree of expansion; arts, agriculture and all
details of material civilization have reached the highest stage of perfection, but spiritual
civilization has been left behind. Material civilization is like unto the lamp, while spiritual
civilization is the light in that lamp. If the material and spiritual civilization become united, then
we will have the light and the lamp together, and the outcome will be perfect. For material
civilization is like unto a beautiful body, and spiritual civilization is like unto the spirit of life. If
that wondrous spirit of life enters this beautiful body, the body will become a channel for the
distribution and development of the perfections of humanity.

Jesus Christ came to teach the people of the world this heavenly civilization and not material
civilization. He breathed the breath of the Holy Spirit into the body of the world and established

350‘Abdu’l-Bahá,     Some Answered Questions, pp. 249-250
351First   Epistle to the Corinthians 13:12

an illumined civilization. Among the principles of divine civilization He came to proclaim is the
Most Great Peace of mankind. Among His principles of spiritual civilization is the oneness of the
kingdom of humanity. Among the principles of heavenly civilization He brought is the virtue of
the human world. Among the principles of celestial civilization He announced is the
improvement and betterment of human morals.

Today the world of humanity is in need of international unity and conciliation. To establish these
great fundamental principles a propelling power is needed. It is self-evident that the unity of the
human world and the Most Great Peace cannot be accomplished through material means. They
cannot be established through political power, for the political interests of nations are various and
the policies of peoples are divergent and conflicting. They cannot be founded through racial or
patriotic power, for these are human powers, selfish and weak. The very nature of racial
differences and patriotic prejudices prevents the realization of this unity and agreement.
Therefore, it is evidenced that the promotion of the oneness of the kingdom of humanity, which
is the essence of the teachings of all the Manifestations of God, is impossible except through the
divine power and breaths of the Holy Spirit. Other powers are too weak and are incapable of
accomplishing this.

For man two wings are necessary. One wing is physical power and material civilization;
the other is spiritual power and divine civilization. With one wing only, flight is impossible. Two
wings are essential. Therefore, no matter how much material civilization advances, it cannot
attain to perfection except through the uplift of spiritual civilization.

All the Prophets have come to promote divine bestowals, to found the spiritual civilization
and teach the principles of morality. Therefore, we must strive with all our powers so that
spiritual influences may gain the victory. For material forces have attacked mankind. The world
of humanity is submerged in a sea of materialism. The rays of the Sun of Reality are seen but
dimly and darkly through opaque glasses. The penetrative power of the divine bounty is not fully
manifest.

In Persia among the various religions and sects there were intense differences. Bahá'u'lláh
appeared in that country and founded the spiritual civilization. He established affiliation among
the various peoples, promoted the oneness of the human world and unfurled the banner of the
Most Great Peace. He wrote special Epistles covering these facts to all the kings and rulers of
nations. Sixty years ago He conveyed His message to the leaders of the political world and to
high dignitaries of the spiritual world. Therefore, spiritual civilization is progressing in the
Orient, and oneness of humanity and peace among the nations is being accomplished step by
step. Now I find a strong movement for universal peace emanating from America. It is my hope

that this standard of the oneness of the world of humanity may be upraised with the utmost
solidity so that the Orient and Occident may become perfectly reconciled and attain complete
intercommunication, the hearts of the East and West become united and attracted, real union
become unveiled, the light of guidance shine, divine effulgences be seen day by day so that the
world of humanity may find complete tranquillity, the eternal happiness of man become evident
and the hearts of the people of the world be as mirrors in which the rays of the Sun of Reality
may be reflected. Consequently, it is my request that you should strive so that the light of reality
may shine and the everlasting felicity of the world of man become apparent.

I will pray for you so you may attain this everlasting happiness. When I arrived in this
city, I was made very happy, for I perceived that the people here have capacity for divine
bestowals and have worthiness for the civilization of heaven. I pray that you may attain to all
merciful bounties.

O Almighty! O God! O Thou compassionate One! This servant of Thine has hastened to
the regions of the West from the uttermost parts of the East that, perchance, these nostrils may be
perfumed by the fragrances of Thy bestowals; that the breeze of the rose garden of guidance may
blow over these cities; that the people may attain to the capacity of receiving Thy favors; that the
hearts may be rejoiced through Thy glad tidings; that the eyes may behold the light of reality;
that the ears may hearken to the call of the Kingdom. O Almighty! Illumine the hearts. O kind
God! Make the souls the envy of the rose garden and the meadow. O incomparable Beloved!
Waft the fragrance of Thy bounty. Radiate the lights of compassion so that the hearts may be
cleansed and purified and that they may take a share and portion from Thy confirmations.
Verily, this congregation is seeking Thy path, searching for Thy mystery, beholding Thy face and
desiring to be characterized with Thine attributes.

Almighty! Confer Thou infinite bounties. Bestow Thine inexhaustible treasury so that
these impotent ones may become powerful.

Verily, Thou art the Kind. Thou art the Generous. Thou art the Omniscient, the
Omnipotent.352

Shoghi Effendi cited additional verses which contain prophecies fulfilled by the advent of the Twin Manifestations
for this day and age:

To the hour of His advent St. Paul had alluded as the hour of the "last trump," the "trump of
God," whilst St. Peter had spoken of it as the "Day of God, wherein the heavens being on

\[352\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, pp. 11-13

fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat." His Day he,
furthermore, had described as "the times of refreshing," "the times of restitution of all
things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy Prophets since the
world began."353

The verses cited in their immediate context are found here:

15:51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, 15:52 In
a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the
dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.354

4:16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the
archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: 4:17 Then we
which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord
in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.355

3:10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall
pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the
works that are therein shall be burned up. 3:11 Seeing then that all these things shall be
dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, 3:12
Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on
fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? 3:13
Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein
dwelleth righteousness.356

3:19 Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times
of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord. 3:20 And he shall send Jesus Christ,
which before was preached unto you: 3:21 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of
restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy
prophets since the world began.357

Much has been written about the apostle Paul's views of women generally and of Christian women in particular.

generally accepted and assumed, have regarded Paul a traditional Jew of his time, while others have sought in

357Sermon of Peter recorded in the Book of Acts of the Apostles 3:19-21

Paul's personal experience a cause for what they characterize as his misogyny. Here are the four passages from
among his letters that are at issue:

11:3 But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the
woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. 11:4 Every man praying or prophesying,
having his head covered, dishonoureth his head. 11:5 But every woman that prayeth or
prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she
were shaven. 11:6 For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for
a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. 11:7 For a man indeed ought not to cover his
head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
11:8 For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man. 11:9 Neither was the man
created for the woman; but the woman for the man. 11:10 For this cause ought the woman to
have power on her head because of the angels. 11:11 Nevertheless neither is the man without the
woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. 11:12 For as the woman is of the man,
even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God. 11:13 Judge in yourselves: is it
comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? 11:14 Doth not even nature itself teach you,
that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? 11:15 But if a woman have long hair, it is a
glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. (First Epistle to the Corinthians)

14:34 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak;
but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law. 14:35 And if they will learn
any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the
church. (First Epistle to the Corinthians)

2:9 In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness
and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; 2:10 But (which becometh
women professing godliness) with good works. 2:11 Let the woman learn in silence with all
subjection. 2:12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to
be in silence. 2:13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve. 2:14 And Adam was not deceived, but
the woman being deceived was in the transgression. 2:15 Notwithstanding she shall be saved in
childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety. (First Epistle to
Timothy)

1:26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the
natural use into that which is against nature: 1:27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural
use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is
unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. (Epistle to
the Romans)

There is nothing remotely misogynistic about Paul's views. They do not seem to be based however on the Torah,
because the only verse in the Law and the Prophets that correlates with what he has written in these letters is the
strong condemnation of homosexual acts between men in the Book of Leviticus:

18:22 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.

20:13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an
abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

The behavior enjoined upon women by Paul is nonetheless entirely compatible with Jewish tradition, as described in
the Talmud and codified in the legal code [halachah] based thereon. A discussion of the obedience of wife to
husband in the Talmud is here cited358:

When we turn to the respect that a woman owes her husband,however, a different picture
emerges. The Talmud (Qiddushin 31a) rules that honoring one's father takes precedence over
honoring his mother, "because you and your mother are required to honor your father."
Similarly (ibid. 30b) we learn that even though both menand women are required to honor their
parents, "a man is able to do it, but a woman is not able to do it, because others have control
over her"; i.e. her husband, as Rashi comments. Thus a married woman is exempt from the
Biblical command of "honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12) because the honor she
owes her husband comes first. This "honor" clearly means doing his will, as the Midrashsays
(Tana De-Vei Eliyahu 10:5), "There is no fit one among women but she who does the will of her
husband." The following story told by the Talmud (Nedarim 66b) shows how far the virtue of
obedience to a woman's husband goes. Once a man from Bábylon came to the Land of Israel
and took a wife. She didn't understand him very well, however, because of the differences
between the dialects of Aramaic spoken in the two countries. Day after day she went wrong in
the cooking, until one day he told her, "Go bring me two gourds (buzinei)". She misunderstood
this too and brought him two lamps. At this he got angry and said, "Go break them on the top of
the door! (`al reisha de-Bába)" But she misunderstood this too and thought he meant "over the
head of Bába"; i.e. Bába ben Buta, the leading scholar of the day who was sitting that moment as
the judge in court,and thus she did. He asked her, "What's this you've done?" "Thus commanded
me my husband", she answered. At this Bába ben Buta blessed her, saying, "You did the will of
your husband - may the Omnipresent bring out from you two sons like Bába ben Buta!" Since
the obedient wife is held in such high esteem, the Talmud advises one to be patient and careful in
choosing a wife who will accept his authority. Thus Rav Papa says (Yevamot 63a), "Go down
astep and take a wife", or as Rashi explains, "Don't take a wife who is more important than you,
lest you not be accepted by her."

It seems reasonable that Paul, a student of the Pharisees in Jerusalem prior to his conversion, should have become
familiar with the so-called oral traditions which were ultimately recorded in the Mishnah and Gemara. But was
Paul the only follower of Jesus who held to such views? We would be remiss to entertain such a belief, inasmuch as
Peter, the first and foremost disciple of Jesus articulated substantially the same convictions in this canonical text:

2:25 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of
your souls. 3:1 Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not
the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; 3:2 While
they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. 3:3 Whose adorning let it not be that
outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; 3:4 But
let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a
meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. 3:5 For after this manner in the
old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto
their own husbands: 3:6 Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye
are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement. 3:7 Likewise, ye husbands,
dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel,
and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered. (First Epistle of
Peter)

Sarah did call Abraham "my lord"...once and in a specific context that belies the reference to her cited here:

18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in
the heat of the day; 18:2 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and
when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the
ground, 18:3 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray
thee, from thy servant: 18:4 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest
yourselves under the tree: 18:5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts;
after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as
thou hast said. 18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready
quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth. 18:7 And
Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man;
and he hasted to dress it. 18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed,
and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat. 18:9 And they said
unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. 18:10 And he said, I will
certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.
And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. 18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah
were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure,

my lord being old also? 18:13 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh,
saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? 18:14 Is anything too hard for the LORD?
At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a
son. 18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but
thou didst laugh. (Book of Genesis)

As to her obedience to her husband Abraham, the only explicit indication we have of this in the Bible is a story
which indicates that she lied in order to save his life:

12:11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai
his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon: 12:12 Therefore it shall
come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will
kill me, but they will save thee alive. 12:13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well
with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee. 12:14 And it came to pass, that,
when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. 12:15
The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was
taken into Pharaoh's house. 12:16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep,
and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels. 12:17
And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's
wife. 12:18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why
didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? 12:19 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might
have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way. (Book of
Genesis)

Hence, both Paul, the learned student of the Pharisees, and Peter, the most likely illiterate fisherman held to
traditional Jewish views about a woman's place and her relationship with her husband that were not explicitly set
forth in the Hebrew Bible, but are found in the oral tradition associated recorded some centuries thereafter. We
might well ask then whether Paul and Peter spoke in this way because it was expedient for them to do so, or whether
they sincerely believed that Jesus enjoined such behavior upon his followers. It might well have seemed auspicious to
both of them that their contemporary fellow believers should behave in such a manner as would commend them most
highly to the unbelievers of their times, so that they might more successfully become "fishers of men" (Gospel of
Matthew 4:19, KJV). Their decision not to require ritual observance of Jewish law from Gentile converts and to
renounce such ritual observance themselves indicates that they were sensitive to the audience they addressed, but also
that they did not believe that such ritual observance was required by Jesus. This is quite remarkable, inasmuch as
the Gospel of Matthew records Jesus saying:

5:17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but
to fulfil. 5:18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no
wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. 5:19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least

commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven:
but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
5:20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the
scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.

As both Paul and Peter held that some of the commandments were not binding on Christians, is it not inevitable
that we recognize this fact...that they believed that "all" was "fulfilled" that "heaven and earth" had passed, and
that, in this new heaven and new earth, the "righteousness" of the Christians did not depend on their obedience to
"the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees"? If, notwithstanding this "paradigm shift" they espoused views
about women and marriage that were in harmony with Jewish tradition two centuries later, what does this mean?
Were such views integral to the vision of the kingdom of God revealed by Jesus? And If they believed that these
teachings were from Jesus himself, what words of his might be the basis for such convictions? In subsequent
postings, with the participation of other exegetes, we will explore these questions.

Responding to Peter and Paul

To recall the previous posting, Paul describes the relationship between man and woman in relation to the story of
Adam and Eve:

11:7 For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of
God: but the woman is the glory of the man. 11:8 For the man is not of the woman: but the
woman of the man. 11:9 Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the
man. (First Epistle to the Corinthians)

2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one
of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; 2:22 And the rib, which the LORD God had
taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. 2:23 And Adam said, This is
now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken
out of Man. (Book of Genesis)

There is another Biblical story that is alluded to by Paul and which suggests another kind of relationship between
man and woman:

1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have
dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all
the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 1:27 So God created man
in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 1:28
And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the

earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and
over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. (Book of Genesis)

Whereas Paul derives the woman from the man from the story of Adam and Eve, the story which describes “man”
as having been “created in his own image” by God specifically states that “male and female created he them” and
“God blessed them, and God said unto them” His commandments that together they “be fruitful, and multiply, and
replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over…every living thing that moveth upon the earth.” In His
relations with His mother, His aunt, His female followers, and the women He addressed in the course of His
ministry, Jesus does not come across as one who believes or wishes them to consider themselves as created of man
and for man. On the contrary, women and men alike are created that they might be born again and attain to eternal
life, and this is only in service to God and attainment to His kingdom.

THE PROPHECIES OF JESUS AND THEIR FULFILMENT

1) DID JESUS PREDICT THE ADVENT OF MUHAMMAD

Now we must consider whether or not Jesus Christ gave "glad tidings of a Messenger" to follow
Him. The numerous references in the Gospels to the appearance of the "Comforter", the "Son of
man coming in the glory of the Father", the "Spirit of Truth" demonstrate beyond the shadow of
a doubt that Jesus Christ did indeed promise a divine Messenger after His departure from this
world. Inasmuch as the references which are traditionally cited both by Christians and by
Muslims with reference to this question are those which refer to the "Comforter", these will be
examined in depth. All of these references are found in the Gospel of John (XIV:16, XIV:26,
XV:26, XVI:7). The actual Greek words employed in this Gospel are "Parakleton" (XIV:16) and
"Parakletos" (XIV:26, XV:26, XVI:7) which has been translated into English as "Comforter"
(King James Version); "Comforter" (Revised Version text) and "Advocate" and "Helper"
(Revised Version margin); "Helper" (Watchtower Society text) and "Comforter" (Watchtower
margin). In all cases, "Parakletos" and "Parakleton" are masculine in gender.

Every one of the four Gospels (Matthew III:3; Mark I:3; Luke III:4; John I:23) contains an
account of John the Baptist fulfilling a certain prophetic verse (number three) found in the 40th
chapter of the Book of Isaiah: “The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way
of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.” The verse which opens this
chapter of Isaiah is as follows: “Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.” (XL:1) In
the Hebrew language the original wording of this text is as follows: “nakhamu nakhamu 'ami
yomar eloheikhem” (XL:1) "Nakhamu" is the Hebrew word translated as "comfort ye". In
Hebrew, the verbal infinitive form of "comfort" is "nikhem"; the noun forms for "comfort" are
"nokhiyut", "nekhamah" and "tenkhumim"; and the noun form for "comforter" is "mnakhem".
The three letter root of all of these words is [NKHM].

This word may contain a clue to the meaning intended by Jesus in identifying His successor by
the name "Comforter", which, in Hebrew, would be "Menakhem". There does not appear to be
any connection whatsoever between the Hebrew name "Menakhem" and the Arabic name
"Ahmad". Christian and Muslim commentators have claimed that the answer to this puzzle is to
be found in the Greek term used in the Gospel of John. Christian commentators affirm that
"Parakleton/Parakletos" sounds similar to "Periklytos", and that while the former means
"Comforter" the latter means "praised, glorified", and since this latter word agrees with the
meaning of the Arabic name "Muhammad" and its cognate "Ahmad", the author of the

Qur'an--whom they presume to be Muhammad--must have thought heard the text of the Gospel
of John in Greek and decided that the wrong word had been employed, that what Jesus Christ
had intended was not "Parakletos" but "Periklytos". This preposterous conclusion is based upon
no evidence whatsoever. Is it likely that an illiterate merchant from Arabia would ever come into
contact with a Greek text of the Gospels? And if he ever did so, what is the likelihood that He
would have mastered the Greek tongue sufficiently to discover the relevant passages to
"Parakletos" in the Gospel of John and also come to know that there was a quite similar Greek
word "Periklytos" which had much the same meaning as His own name? This would imply that
Muhammad was a deceiver, one might even say a forger--for He claimed that the Qur'an was
revealed to Him by the Angel Gabriel--and a scholar of New Testament Greek to boot! This
examination of the evidence seems to point to a symbolic rather than a literal interpretation of
these verses--that is, a symbolic interpretation of "Parakletos" in the Gospel of John and a
symbolic interpretation of "Ahmad" in the Qur'an. A literal interpretation of either or both of
these terms seems to make them incompatible, and to render the claims of Muhammad
uncertain if not invalid on this score. Jesus Christ promised that a "Comforter" would follow
Him. The Qur'an states that Jesus promised that He would be followed by a Messenger of God
named "more laudable, more praiseworthy". Jesus Christ did not say that the Comforter's name
was to be "Comforter". The Qur'an does not say that the new Messenger's name would be
"Ahmad". There is no conflict. But did Jesus Christ say that the "Comforter" would be "more
laudable, more praiseworthy" than Himself?

And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may
abide with you forever; Even the Spirit of truth... (Gospel of John XIV:16-17)

But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my
name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,
whatsoever I have said unto you. (Gospel of John XIV:26)

Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go
not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him
unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of
righteousness, and of judgment...I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye
cannot bear them now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide
you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear,
that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. (Gospel of John XVI:7-8,
12-13)

These references to the "Comforter" certainly seem to refer to a Prophet of God who is "more laudable, more
praiseworthy" than the His predecessor, with regard to the intensity of His Revelation and the readiness of humanity
to receive that greater intensity. When He said: "It is expedient for you that I go away" (Gospel of
John XVI:7), Jesus Christ was teachings His followers that Prophets succeed each other, that they do not remain
fixed stars by which humanity is meant to navigate forever; also, He was not referring to His station as a Prophet of
God, which is eternal and immeasurably exalted above all earthly acts, including birth and death, but rather to His
Dispensation and possibly to His mortal humanity. For every Prophet of God is a human being as well as the
Supreme Representative in the worlds of creation of the Creator Himself. Literal interpretations often fall far short of
hitting the mark. Bahá'u'llah writes in "Kitab-i-Iqan" (KI:80-81):

Judge fairly: Were the prophecies recorded in the Gospel to be literally fulfilled; were Jesus, Son
of Mary, accompanied by angels, to descend from the visible heaven upon the clouds; who would
dare to disbelieve, who would dare to reject the truth, and wax disdainful? Nay, such
consternation would immediately seize all the dwellers of the earth that no soul would feel able to
utter a word, much less to reject or accept the truth.

The Kitab-i-Iqan cites many verses from the canonical Gospels and interprets them as being fulfilled by Muhammad.
Bahá’u’llah likewise indicates that inasmuch as these prophecies are phrased in symbolic language having universal
applications, they refer also to the advent of the Báb and to the coming of every Manifestation of God. The first reference
to such prophecies cites a verse from the Gospel of John (Bahá'u'llah, Kitab-i-Iqan, pp. 20-22):

To them that are endowed with understanding, it is clear and manifest that when the fire of the love
of Jesus consumed the veils of Jewish limitations, and His authority was made apparent and partially
enforced, He the Revealer of the unseen Beauty, addressing one day His disciples, referred unto His
passing, and, kindling in their hearts the fire of bereavement, said unto them: "I go away and
come again unto you." [Gospel of John XVI:7] And in another place He said: "I go and
another will come Who will tell you all that I have not told you, and will fulfil all that
I have said." [paraphrase of Gospel of John XVI:7-8] Both these sayings have but one meaning,
were you to ponder upon the Manifestations of the Unity of God with divine insight.

Every discerning observer will recognize that in the Dispensation of the Qur'án both the
Book and the Cause of Jesus were confirmed. As to the matter of names, Muhammad, Himself,
declared: "I am Jesus." He recognized the truth of the signs, prophecies, and words of Jesus, and
testified that they were all of God. In this sense, neither the person of Jesus nor His writings hath
differed from that of Muhammad and of His holy Book, inasmuch as both have championed the
Cause of God, uttered His praise, and revealed His commandments. Thus it is that Jesus, Himself,
declared: "I go away and come again unto you." [Gospel of John XVI:7] Consider the sun.
Were it to say now, "I am the sun of yesterday," it would speak the truth. And should it, bearing the

sequence of time in mind, claim to be other than that sun, it still would speak the truth. In like
manner, if it be said that all the days are but one and the same, it is correct and true. And if it be
said, with respect to their particular names and designations, that they differ, that again is true. For
though they are the same, yet one doth recognize in each a separate designation, a specific attribute,
a particular character. Conceive accordingly the distinction, variation, and unity characteristic of the
various Manifestations of holiness, that thou mayest comprehend the allusions made by the creator
of all names and attributes to the mysteries of distinction and unity, and discover the answer to thy
question as to why that everlasting Beauty should have, at sundry times, called Himself by different
names and titles.

The prophecies contained in the mirror apocalypse in the Gospels of Matthew and Mark:

24:29 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and
the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the
powers of the heavens shall be shaken: 24:30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of
man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man
coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 24:31 And he shall send
his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect
from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. 24:32 Now learn a parable
of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that
summer is nigh: 24:33 So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it
is near, even at the doors. 24:34 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass,
till all these things be fulfilled. 24:35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my
words shall not pass away. 24:36 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not
the angels of heaven, but my Father only. 24:37 But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the
coming of the Son of man be. 24:38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating
and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, 24:39
And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of
man be. 24:40 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 24:41 Two
women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 24:42 Watch
therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. 24:43 But know this, that if the
goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and
would not have suffered his house to be broken up. 24:44 Therefore be ye also ready: for in
such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.

13:24 But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the
moon shall not give her light, 13:25 And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers
that are in heaven shall be shaken. 13:26 And then shall they see the Son of man

coming in the clouds with great power and glory. 13:27 And then shall he send his
angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost
part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven. 13:28 Now learn a parable of the fig
tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer
is near: 13:29 So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know
that it is nigh, even at the doors. 13:30 Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall
not pass, till all these things be done. 13:31 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my
words shall not pass away. 13:32 But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no,
not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. 13:33 Take ye heed,
watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. 13:34 For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far
journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and
commanded the porter to watch. 13:35 Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the
master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the
morning: 13:36 Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. 13:37 And what I say unto
you I say unto all, Watch.

Bahá’u’lláh writes, explaining the meaning of these verses:

These are the melodies, sung by Jesus, Son of Mary, in accents of majestic power in the Ridvan of
the Gospel, revealing those signs that must needs herald the advent of the Manifestation after Him.
In the first Gospel according to Matthew it is recorded: And when they asked Jesus concerning the
signs of His coming, He said unto them: "Immediately after the oppression of those days
shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall
fall from heaven, and the powers of the earth shall be shaken: and then shall appear
the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn,
and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and
great glory. And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet." [Gospel of
Matthew 24:29-31] (Bahá'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, pp. 24-25)

Inasmuch as the Christian divines have failed to apprehend the meaning of these words, and did not
recognize their object and purpose, and have clung to the literal interpretation of the words of Jesus,
they therefore became deprived of the streaming grace of the Muhammadan Revelation and its
showering bounties. The ignorant among the Christian community, following the example of the
leaders of their faith, were likewise prevented from beholding the beauty of the King of glory,
inasmuch as those signs which were to accompany the dawn of the sun of the Muhammadan
Dispensation did not actually come to pass. Thus, ages have passed and centuries rolled away, and
that most pure Spirit hath repaired unto the retreats of its ancient sovereignty. Once more hath the
eternal Spirit breathed into the mystic trumpet, and caused the dead to speed out of their

sepulchres of heedlessness and error unto the realm of guidance and grace. (Bahá'u'llah, The Kitab-i-
Iqan, p. 26)

Beside this passage, there is yet another verse in the Gospel wherein He saith: "Heaven and earth
shall pass away: but My words shall not pass away." [Gospel of Matthew XXIV:35;
Gospel of Mark XIII:31] Thus it is that the adherents of Jesus maintained that the law of the Gospel
shall never be annulled, and that whensoever the promised Beauty is made manifest and all the signs
are revealed, He must needs re-affirm and establish the law proclaimed in the Gospel, so that there
may remain in the world no faith but His faith. This is their fundamental belief. And their
conviction is such that were a person to be made manifest with all the promised signs and to
promulgate that which is contrary to the letter of the law of the Gospel, they must assuredly
renounce him, refuse to submit to his law, declare him an infidel, and laugh him to scorn. This is
proved by that which came to pass when the sun of the Muhammadan Revelation was revealed.
Had they sought with a humble mind from the Manifestations of God in every Dispensation the
true meaning of these words revealed in the sacred books -- words the misapprehension of which
hath caused men to be deprived of the recognition of the Sadratu'l-Muntaha, the ultimate Purpose -
- they surely would have been guided to the light of the Sun of Truth, and would have discovered
the mysteries of divine knowledge and wisdom. (Bahá'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, pp. 27-28)

As to the words -- "Immediately after the oppression of those days" [Gospel of Matthew
XXIV:29]-- they refer to the time when men shall become oppressed and afflicted, the time when
the lingering traces of the Sun of Truth and the fruit of the Tree of knowledge and wisdom will have
vanished from the midst of men, when the reins of mankind will have fallen into the grasp of the
foolish and ignorant, when the portals of divine unity and understanding -- the essential and highest
purpose in creation -- will have been closed, when certain knowledge will have given way to idle
fancy, and corruption will have usurped the station of righteousness. (Bahá'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan,
p. 28)

What "oppression" is greater than that which hath been recounted? What "oppression" is
more grievous than that a soul seeking the truth, and wishing to attain unto the knowledge of God,
should know not where to go for it and from whom to seek it? For opinions have sorely differed, and
the ways unto the attainment of God have multiplied. This "oppression" is the essential feature of
every Revelation. Unless it cometh to pass, the Sun of Truth will not be made manifest. For the
break of the morn of divine guidance must needs follow the darkness of the night of error. For this
reason, in all chronicles and traditions reference hath been made unto these things, namely that
iniquity shall cover the surface of the earth and darkness shall envelop mankind. (Bahá'u'llah, The
Kitab-i-Iqan, pp. 31-32)

And now, concerning His words -- "The sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not
give light, and the stars shall fall from heaven." [Gospel of Matthew XXIV:29; Gospel of
Mark XIII:24-25] By the terms "sun" and "moon," mentioned in the writings of the Prophets of
God, is not meant solely the sun and moon of the visible universe. Nay rather, manifold are the
meanings they have intended for these terms… (Bahá'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 32)

Thus, by the "sun" in one sense is meant those Suns of Truth Who rise from the dayspring of
ancient glory, and fill the world with a liberal effusion of grace from on high. These Suns of Truth
are the universal Manifestations of God in the worlds of His attributes and names…(Bahá'u'llah, The
Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 33)

Thus, it hath become evident that the terms "sun," "moon," and "stars" primarily signify the
Prophets of God, the saints, and their companions, those Luminaries, the light of Whose knowledge
hath shed illumination upon the worlds of the visible and the invisible…(Bahá'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan,
p. 34)

In another sense, by these terms is intended the divines of the former Dispensation, who live in the
days of the subsequent Revelations, and who hold the reins of religion in their grasp. (Bahá'u'llah,
The Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 35)

In another sense, by the terms 'sun', 'moon', and 'stars' are meant such laws and teachings as have
been established and proclaimed in every Dispensation, such as the laws of prayer and fasting.
These have, according to the law of the Qur'án, been regarded, when the beauty of the Prophet
Muhammad had passed beyond the veil, as the most fundamental and binding laws of His
dispensation. (Bahá'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 37)

And now, with reference to His words: "And then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn,
and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and
great glory." [Gospel of Matthew 24:30-31; Gospel of Mark 13:26] These words signify that in
those days men will lament the loss of the Sun of the divine beauty, of the Moon of knowledge, and
of the Stars of divine wisdom. Thereupon, they will behold the countenance of the promised One,
the adored Beauty, descending from heaven and riding upon the clouds. By this is meant that the
divine Beauty will be made manifest from the heaven of the will of God, and will appear in the form
of the human temple. (Bahá'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, pp. 66-67)

In the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, Bahá’u’llah interprets one of these verses:

The Hour that was concealed within the knowledge of God hath struck, whereupon all the atoms
of the earth have proclaimed: "The Ancient of Days is come in His great glory! Hasten unto Him, O
peoples of the earth, with humble and contrite hearts." (Bahá'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of
Hosts, p. 56)

O Shaykh! Hearken unto the melodies of the Gospel with the ear of fairness. He saith -- glorified be
His utterance -- prophesying the things that are to come: "But of that Day and Hour knoweth
no man, no, not the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father." [Gospel of Matthew
XXIV:36; Gospel of Mark XIII:32] By Father in this connection is meant God -- exalted be His
glory. He, verily, is the True Educator, and the Spiritual Teacher. (Bahá'u'llah, Epistle to the Son of the
Wolf, p. 143)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá is reported to have explained the meaning of one of these verses:

The meaning of Christ's saying "Verily I say unto you, this generation shall not pass away
till all these things be fulfilled" [Gospel of Matthew XXIV:34; Gospel of Mark XIII:30] is
this: There are two generations -- a spiritual one and a physical one. Thirty-three years is counted
one physical generation (Christ himself was thirty years old when He began to teach, and was
crucified when He was thirty-three) but in this saying, Christ was not speaking of the physical but of
the spiritual generation or epoch, and meant that His dispensation or epoch would not pass away,
until all things should be fulfilled -- which took place at the coming of Mohammed. (Bahá’í Prayers
9, pp. 48-49)

2)FULFILLED BY BAHÁ’U’LLAH

According to the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and letters written by and on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, a
number of prophecies uttered by Jesus and recorded in the gospels are fulfilled by Bahá’u’lláh. In certain verses
recorded in the Gospel of John, Jesus Christ speaks to His disciples about His death and His return:

And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may
abide with you forever; Even the Spirit of Truth; Whom the world cannot receive,
because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him: but ye know Him; for He dwelleth
with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.
(John XIV:16-18)

But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My
name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,
whatsoever I have said unto you. (John XIV:16)

But when the Comforter is come, Whom I will send unto you from the Father, even
the Spirit of Truth, which proceedeth from the Father, He shall testify of Me. (John
XV:26)

Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go
not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him
unto you. (John XVI:7)

It is well known that most Christians have understood the promise of Jesus Christ to send the Comforter as meaning
that He would send to His followers the Holy Ghost (Spirit), and that this promise was fulfilled in Pentecost, and
that hence no other Comforter is implied. Bahá'u'llah does not deny that the followers of the Christ received the
inspiration and confirmation of the Holy Spirit after the ascension of their Master. Here is how He describes the
spiritual influence of the Christ upon His ascension:

Know thou that when the Son of man yielded up His breath unto God, the whole creation wept
with a great weeping. By sacrificing Himself, however, fresh capacity was infused into all created
things. Its evidences, as witnessed in all the peoples of the earth, are now manifest before thee.
The deepest wisdom which the sages have uttered, the profoundest learning which any mind
hath unfolded, the arts which the ablest hands have produced, the influence exerted by the most
potent of rulers, are but manifestations of the quickening power released by His transcendent,
His all-pervasive, and resplendent Spirit. ("Lawh-i-Fatah A'dham", in GL:85-86)

Many other verses of Bahá'u'llah speak of this theme, and it is also discussed in the discourses and writings of His
appointed interpreters. The other meaning of "Comforter" according to Bahá'u'llah is its reference to the return of
Jesus Christ in another Prophet, or what Christians call the "second coming", and Bahá’u’llah claims to be the
most recent fulfillment of this promise:

The Comforter Whose advent all the Scriptures have promised is now come that He may reveal
unto you all knowledge and wisdom. Seek Him over the entire surface of the earth, haply ye may
find Him. (WOB:104-105)

In the Gospel of John XIV:16 and XV:26 the Comforter is identified with the Spirit of Truth. In
John XVI:13 Jesus Christ speaks of the Spirit of Truth to His followers:

Howbeit when He, the Spirit of Truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth: for
He shall not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak:
and He will show you things to come.

Bahá'u'lláh speaks directly to this verse in a number of passages, declaring its fulfillment in His ministry:

O kings of Christendom! Heard ye not the saying of Jesus..."When He, the Spirit of Truth,
is come, He will guide you into all truth." And yet, behold how, when He did bring the
truth, ye refused to turn your faces towards Him, and persisted in disporting yourselves with your
pastimes and fancies. ("Surat'u'l-Muluk"; PDC:27-28; BWF:38)

Verily the Spirit of Truth is come to guide you into all truth. (WOB:104)

Verily, He Who is the Spirit of Truth is come to guide you unto all truth. He
speaketh not as prompted by His own self, but as bidden by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the
All-Wise. (“Lawh-i-Aqdas,” TB:12)

In the same chapter of the Gospel of John there are other verses pertaining to this Comforter, this Spirit of Truth
--they are fulfilled also:

I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. (John:16:12)

These gospel verses are also referenced by Bahá’u’lláh in several statements:

This is the Word which the Son concealed, when to those around Him He said: 'Ye cannot
bear it now.' And when the appointed time was fulfilled and the Hour had struck, the Word
shone forth above the horizon of the Will of God. Beware, O followers of the Son, that ye cast it
not behind your backs. (TB:11)

Adorn ye your bodies whilst the raiment of God is stained with the blood of hatred at the hands
of the people of denial? Issue forth from your habitations and bid the people enter the Kingdom
of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgement. The Word which the Son concealed is made
manifest. It hath been sent down in the form of the human temple in this day. Blessed be the
Lord Who is the Father! He, verily, is come unto the nations in His most great majesty. Turn
your faces towards Him, O concourse of the righteous! (SLH:#112, p. 59)

This is the Word which the Son veiled when He said to those around Him that at
that time they could not bear it. (WOB:104)

Briefly, in the sayings of Him Who is the Spirit (Jesus) unnumbered significances lie concealed.
Unto many things did He refer, but as He found none possessed of a hearing ear or a seeing eye
He chose to conceal most of these things. Even as He saith: "But ye cannot bear them

now." That Dawning-Place of Revelation saith that on that Day He Who is the Promised One
will reveal the things which are to come. Accordingly in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, and in the Tablets to
the Kings, and in the Lawh-i-Ra'is, and in the Lawh-i-Fu'ad, most of the things which have come
to pass on this earth have been announced and prophesied by the Most Sublime Pen. (ESW:148)

In the Gospel of John the description of the true successor to Jesus continues:

He shall glorify Me: for He shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you. (John
26:14)

That statement is also referenced by Bahá’u’lláh:

He is the One Who glorified the Son and exalted His Cause. (WOB:104)

Say, this is the One Who hath glorified the Son and hath exalted His Cause.
("Lawh-i-Aqdas", TB:12)

There are also prophecies of Jesus found in the synoptic Gospels, including the following passages:

For the Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father with His angels... (Mt:16:27)

...of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when He cometh in the glory of His Father
with the holy angels. (Mk:8:38)

...of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when He shall come in His own glory, and in
His Father's, and of the holy angels. (Lk:9:26)

This wording is somewhat modified but nonetheless reiterated in Matthew 24:30 and Luke 21:27:

And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the
earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with
power and great glory. (Mt:24:30)

And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
(Lk:21:27)

In His Tablet to Pope Pius IX, the leader of the largest community of Christians:

Adorn ye your bodies whilst the raiment of God is stained with the blood of hatred at the hands
of the people of denial? Issue forth from your habitations and bid the people enter the Kingdom
of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgement. The Word which the Son concealed is made
manifest. It hath been sent down in the form of the human temple in this day. Blessed be the
Lord Who is the Father! He, verily, is come unto the nations in His most great
majesty. Turn your faces towards Him, O concourse of the righteous! (Bahá’u’lláh, Tablet to
Pope Pius IX, in The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, #112, p. 59; Proclamation of
Bahá’u’llah:30-31)

In His Tablet to Czar Alexander of Russia Bahá’u’lláh refers to this prophecy:

Beware lest thy sovereignty withhold thee from Him Who is the Supreme Sovereign. He, verily,
is come with His Kingdom, and all the atoms cry aloud: "Lo! The Lord is come in His great
majesty!" He Who is the Father is come, and the Son, in the holy vale, crieth out: "Here am I,
here am I, O Lord, My God!", whilst Sinai circleth round the House, and the Burning Bush
calleth aloud: "The All-Bounteous is come mounted upon the clouds! Blessed is he that
draweth nigh unto Him, and woe betide them that are far away." (“Tablet to Czar Alexander II
of Russia”, Proclamation of Bahá’u’llah:83,85; ESW:57; SLH:#159, p. 84)

In “Kitab-i-Aqdas” we find this reference to the prophecy:

Ye are but vassals, O kings of the earth! He Who is the King of Kings hath appeared,
arrayed in His most wondrous glory [Bahá], and is summoning you unto Himself, the
Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting [al-Qayyum]. ("Kitab-i-Aqdas", #82; in GL:211)

Bahá'u'llah in "Lawh-i-Aqdas" addresses various categories of Christians regarding the same prophecy:

Say, O followers of the Son! Have ye shut out yourselves from Me by reason of My Name?
Wherefore ponder ye not in your hearts? day and night ye have been calling upon your Lord,
the Omnipotent, but when He came from the heaven of eternity in His great glory,
ye turned aside from Him and remained sunk in heedlessness. (TB:9)

O concourse of priests! Leave the bells, and come forth, then, from your churches. It behoveth
you, in this day, to proclaim aloud the Most Great Name among the nations. Prefer ye to be
silent, whilst every stone and every tree shouteth aloud: 'The Lord is come in His great
glory!'? (TB:13)

Bethlehem is astir with the Breeze of God. We hear her voice saying: "O most generous
Lord...Praised be Thou in that Thou hast raised the veils, and come with power in
evident glory." (TB:14)

In "Suriy-i-Vafa" He reiterates this fulfillment to an individual believer:

The Promised One Himself hath come down from heaven, seated upon the
crimson cloud with the hosts of revelation on His right, and the angels of
inspiration on His left, and the Decree hath been fulfilled at the behest of God, the
Omnipotent, the Almighty. (TB:182)

In "Kitab-i-Iqan" Bahá'u'llah explains the inner meanings of the terms used in these passages --the meanings of
"clouds", "coming down from heaven", "angels" and so forth-- and 'Abdu'l-Bahá has spoken and written
extensively with regard to this symbolic language of the Prophets. Bahá'u'llah testifies that the return of the Son in
the glory of the Father is the return of the Son in "Bahá'u'llah", a literal translation of "Glory of the Father" if the
Father is taken to be equivalent to "Allah", which the reader will agree is entirely reasonable and indeed,
inescapable. However, Bahá'u'llah takes this one step further, and this is what will astonish many Christians who
are given to literal interpretations and therefore do not perceive the flexibility, the subtlety, the infinite significances of
the Creative Word --the Son of man returns also in the glory of the Father: hence it is the Father Who is returning
in His glory. This harmonizes with certain prophecies from the Hebrew Prophets as we shall see, especially with
the Book of Isaiah, chapter IX, verse 6:

6 Forto us a Child will be born. To us a Son will be given. And the rule of the
nations will be on His shoulders. His name will be called Wonderful, Teacher,
Powerful God, Father Who Lives Forever, Prince of Peace.

Bahá’u’lláh referred to Himself as the fulfillment of this prophecy, in literal and direct language, indicating that not
all prophecies are meant to be understood in an entirely metaphorical fashion and that He did not entirely eschew
literal interpretation:

Lo! The Father is come, and that which ye were promised in the Kingdom is fulfilled!
(“Lawh-i-Aqdas”, TB:11; SLH:59)

Tell Me then: Do the sons recognize the Father, and acknowledge Him, or do they deny Him,
even as the people aforetime denied Him (Jesus)? (“Lawh-i-Aqdas”, TB:14-15; PDC:103)

O concourse of bishops! Trembling hath seized all the kindreds of the earth, and He Who is the
Everlasting Father calleth aloud between earth and heaven. (Proclamation of Bahá’u’llah:93;
PDC:101; BWF:60)

Adorn ye your bodies whilst the raiment of God is stained with the blood of hatred at the hands
of the people of denial? Issue forth from your habitations and bid the people enter the Kingdom
of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgement. The Word which the Son concealed is made
manifest. It hath been sent down in the form of the human temple in this day. Blessed be the
Lord Who is the Father! He, verily, is come unto the nations in His most great
majesty. Turn your faces towards Him, O concourse of the righteous! (Bahá’u’lláh, Tablet to
Pope Pius IX, in The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, #112, p. 59; Proclamation of
Bahá’u’llah:30-31)

Beware lest thy sovereignty withhold thee from Him Who is the Supreme Sovereign. He, verily,
is come with His Kingdom, and all the atoms cry aloud: "Lo! The Lord is come in His great
majesty!" He Who is the Father is come, and the Son, in the holy vale, crieth out: "Here am I,
here am I, O Lord, My God!", whilst Sinai circleth round the House, and the Burning Bush
calleth aloud: "The All-Bounteous is come mounted upon the clouds! Blessed is he that draweth
nigh unto Him, and woe betide them that are far away." (“Tablet to Czar Alexander II of
Russia”, Proclamation of Bahá’u’llah:83,85; ESW:57; SLH:#159, p. 84)

Shoghi Effendi quotes from Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet, cited above, and reaffirms the interpretation:

“Say: O concourse of bishops! Trembling hath seized all the kindreds of the earth, and He Who
is the Everlasting Father calleth aloud between earth and heaven. Blessed the ear that hath
heard, and the eye that hath seen, and the heart that hath turned unto Him Who is the Point of
Adoration of all who are in the heavens and all who are on earth.” (Shoghi Effendi, The Promised
Day is Come, p. 101)

These “fallen stars” of the firmament of Christendom, these “thick clouds” that have obscured
the radiance of the true Faith of God, these princes of the Church that have failed to
acknowledge the sovereignty of the “King of kings,” these deluded ministers of the Son who have
shunned and ignored the promised Kingdom which the “Everlasting Father” has brought
down from heaven… (Shoghi Effendi, The Promised Day is Come, p. 103)

In his history of the Bahá’í Faith, Shoghi Effendi reiterates this interpretation:

To Israel He was neither more nor less than the incarnation of the “Everlasting Father,” the
“Lord of Hosts” come down “with ten thousands of saints”; to Christendom Christ returned “in
the glory of the Father”…To Him Isaiah, the greatest of the Jewish prophets, had alluded as the
“Glory of the Lord,” the “Everlasting Father,” the “Prince of Peace,” the “Wonderful,” the
“Counsellor”…359

In passages addressed to its bishops He proclaims that “the Everlasting Father calleth aloud
between earth and heaven,”…And finally, in several passages addressed to the entire body of the
followers of Jesus Christ He identifies Himself with the “Father” spoken of by Isaiah, with the
“Comforter” Whose Covenant He Who is the Spirit (Jesus) had Himself established, and with the
“Spirit of Truth” Who will guide them “into all truth”…360

There is yet another passage in the gospels which has been referenced by Bahá’u’lláh as fulfilled by Himself…it is
found in the prayer of Jesus, cited in the Gospel of Matthew (6:10) and the Gospel of Luke (11:2):

Thy kingdom come…

Bahá’u’lláh writes, in His Tablet to Pope Pius IX:

Adorn ye your bodies whilst the raiment of God is stained with the blood of hatred at the hands
of the people of denial? Issue forth from your habitations and bid the people enter the
Kingdom of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgement. The Word which the Son concealed
is made manifest. It hath been sent down in the form of the human temple in this day. Blessed be
the Lord Who is the Father! He, verily, is come unto the nations in His most great majesty. Turn
your faces towards Him, O concourse of the righteous!361

By the righteousness of God! Should they cast Him into a fire kindled on the continent, He will
assuredly rear His head in the midmost heart of the ocean and proclaim: "He is the Lord of all
that are in heaven and all that are on earth!" And if they cast Him into a darksome pit, they will
find Him seated on earth’s loftiest heights calling aloud to all mankind: "Lo, the Desire of the
World is come in His majesty, His sovereignty, His transcendent dominion!" And if He be buried
beneath the depths of the earth, His Spirit soaring to the apex of heaven shall peal the summons:
"Behold ye the coming of the Glory; witness ye the Kingdom of God, the Most Holy, the
Gracious, the All-Powerful!" And if they shed His blood, every drop thereof shall cry out and

invoke God in this Name through which the fragrance of His raiment hath been diffused in all
directions.362

Shoghi Effendi reiterated this fulfillment of prophecy in several of his communications:

It alone can usher in the Kingdom of the Heavenly Father as anticipated by the Faith of
Jesus Christ.363

Then will the worldwide sovereignty of Bahá’u’lláh—the Establisher of the Kingdom of the
Father foretold by the Son, and anticipated by the Prophets of God before Him and after
Him—be recognized, acclaimed, and firmly established.364

The final establishment of this seat of the future Bahá’í World Commonwealth will signalize at
once the proclamation of the sovereignty of the Founder of our Faith and the advent of the
Kingdom of the Father repeatedly lauded and promised by Jesus Christ.365

The Formative Period, the Iron Age, of that Dispensation was now beginning, the Age in which
the institutions, local, national and international, of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh were to take shape,
develop and become fully consolidated, in anticipation of the third, the last, the Golden Age
destined to witness the emergence of a world-embracing Order enshrining the ultimate fruit of
God’s latest Revelation to mankind, a fruit whose maturity must signalize the establishment of a
world civilization and the formal inauguration of the Kingdom of the Father upon earth as
promised by Jesus Christ Himself. (God Passes By, p. 324)

Shoghi Effendi refers to the fulfillment of these several prophecies, citing Bahá’u’lláh’s words already included in
this survey:

“The Word which the Son concealed is made manifest. It hath been sent down in the form of the
human temple in this day. Blessed be the Lord Who is the Father! He, verily, is come unto the
nations in His most great majesty. Turn your faces towards Him, O concourse of the righteous!
…This is the day whereon the Rock [Peter] crieth out and shouteth, and celebrateth the praise of
its Lord, the All-Possessing, the Most High, saying: ‘Lo! The Father is come, and that which ye
were promised in the Kingdom is fulfilled!…’ My body longeth for the cross, and Mine head

waiteth the thrust of the spear, in the path of the All-Merciful, that the world may be purged
from its transgressions….366

A humiliation less spectacular yet historically more significant awaited Pope Pius IX. It was to
him who regarded himself as the Vicar of Christ that Bahá’u’lláh wrote that “the Word which
the Son [Jesus] concealed is made manifest,” that “it hath been sent down in the form of the
human temple,” that the Word was Himself, and He Himself the Father. It was to him who
styling himself “the servant of the servants of God” that the Promised One of all ages, unveiling
His station in its plenitude, announced that “He Who is the Lord of Lords is come overshadowed
with clouds.” It was he, who, claiming to be the successor of St. Peter, was reminded by
Bahá’u’lláh that “this is the day whereon the Rock [Peter] crieth out and shouteth … saying: ‘Lo,
the Father is come, and that which ye were promised in the Kingdom is fulfilled.’”367

TO BE CONTINUED

Books of this variety usually end with “Conclusions”, often prefaced with “Summaries”. You will
notice that this volume provides neither…and intentionally. It would be impossible to
meaningfully summarize the great variety of ideas surveyed here, and any attempt to do so would
devalue the project as a whole. The purpose of this study is to open doors and provoke the
appearance of new ideas, not to neatly pigeonhole the words and ideas cited here and thereby
deprive them of light an warmth alike. And there can be no conclusion to an enterprise such as
this, particularly when further volumes are contemplated. We just got started here. I welcome
you now, to volume two.
