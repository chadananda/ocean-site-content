Leo Tolstoy and Ameen Rihani: The Interaction Between Two Creative

Worlds

Both were prolific writers, fearless thinkers and unbending prophets. Each one
created an inner self and left us a unique world of his own. The elder never knew
about the existence of the younger who, in his turn, always held him in the highest
esteem. Their worlds, however, are not unilateral, and the interchange between them
is much deeper than one could imagine at first sight. Moreover, these worlds form a
three-dimensional space with points in Russia, the Arab World, and the USA.

When very young, Leo Tolstoy took a great interest in Near Eastern culture.

He started to learn Turkish and Arabic, successfully passed his entrance exams in
1844 and has become for a while a student of the Turkish-Arabic section of Kazan
University, then the best Oriental studies center in Russia. Much later a private
physician of Tolstoy recalled among a flood of letters coming all over the world to his
estate in Yasnaya Poliana those written in Arabic or a similar script from the Ottoman
Empire, Persia and other Muslim countries.1 There were artless messages with
expressions of love and respect like the Russian letter of a Lebanese girl, Ramza
Awawini from Zahle, or an erudite epistle of Muhammad Abdo, Mufti of Egypt, with
whom Tolstoy discussed the ways of universal religious reformation.2

In his answer to Muhammad Abdo Tolstoy incidentally demonstrated a
favorable attitude to the Bahai religion. A staunch supporter of rational thought, he

censured what he called the arrogant intolerance, formal rites and obscure
superstitions of official religions, claiming that classical Islam in its outward shape
stood much higher than the contemporaneous Orthodox Christian Church.3 Even more
he was attracted in 1898-1909 by the Bahai movement, and for some time he fostered
an idea of writing a book about this radical offshoot of Islam. There are sources on
Bahai history and doctrine in Yasnaya Poliana’s library, incuding the research of
F.C. Andreas and a Russian translation of Bahaulla’s Kitab-i Aqdas by A. Tumansky.4

Tolstoy could not help but sympathized with the Bahai sayings coined by Abd
al-Baha when they asked God to unify mankind and illumine the world of humanity -

Gather all people beneath the shadow of Thy bounty and cause them to unite
in harmony, so that they may become as the rays of one sun, as the waves of one
ocean, as the fruit of one tree. May they drink from the same fountain (...)

Let the religions agree and make the nations one, so that they may see each
other as one family and the whole earth as one home (...)

> O God! Raise aloft the banner of the oneness of mankind.

O God! Establish the Most Great Peace.

Praise be unto Thee for kindling the fire of divine love in the Holy Tree on the
summit of the loftiest mount: that Tree which is «neither of the East nor of the West
[Quran 24: 35]».5

Tolstoy maintained indirect contact with Abd al-Baha, or Abbas-effendi, son
of the late Bahaullah, via a Bahai messenger, Azizullah Djazzab, a Jewish merchant
from Meshhed, who left a detailed account of his journey from Akka to Yasnaya
Poliana.6 However, Tolstoy was disappointed by The Most Holy Book (Kitab-i Aqdas)
of Bahaullah and some writings of Abbas-effendi because of its ‘empty Oriental
rhetoric’, the intricacies of dark Sufi style, replacing ancient prejudices with new
ones. So, he decidedly concluded, this religion has no future.7

Despite all his ebbs and flows of enthusiasm for certain Middle Eastern trends,
Tolstoy always appreciated the Arabic folk legacy; he admired Arabian proverbs,
aphorisms, wise and funny stories. In artistic influence he compared Arabian fairy
tales with Japanese painting and Indian architecture.8 He meant in particular Ali-
Baba and the forty thieves and the story of prince Qamar al-Zaman from The Arabian
Nights which he included into the list of most impressive books of his childhood and
adolescence along with Russian epic Bylinas, the Gospel of Matthew, the Sentimental
Journey of Stern, and Confession and other writings of Rousseau.9 Arabian tales were
mentioned many times, e.g. when Tolstoy light-heartedly described a horse of his son
like a cross between a camel and a chicken, a poor creature presumably being a
bewitched prince, or when he recommended that all young men read Arabian tales
rather then modern articles on liberalism.10 Today this oblique pattern that connects
Tolstoy with Rihani has become more distinct with the publication of Rihani’s book
on the lore of the Arabian Nights.11

In one of his last private letters Tolstoy marked as a very good book a reader
for peasant children entitled The Sayings of Mahomet [Prophet Muhammad.- M.R.]
not included in the Koran (Moscow 1910) which was compiled by Tolstoy on the
basis of an English selection made by Abdallah al-Suhravardi, an Indian layer.12

Beside his other works, the Sayings were translated into Arabic by Salim Qobain as
The Wisdom of the Prophet Muhammad presented by philosopher Tolstoy and
published in Cairo in 1915 and 1987. The structure and content of the Russian
original were examined by Arabian scholar Makarem al-Ghimri as well as the
interactions between Tolstoy and the Arab world in general.13

Undoubtedly, one of the key figures in this process from the Arab side is
Amin Rihani. His essay, along with that of Mustafa al-Manfaluti,14 written at the very
end of Tolstoy’s life, reflects the common idea of the Russian thinker as shared by
educated Arab readers and, at the same time, alters it. A pedantic observer would find
some factual mistakes in Rihani’s essay. Thus Tolstoy did not divide all his property
and land between his peasants and friends. The famous Kreutzer sonata was
completed in 1889 (and published two years later) when the author, so to speak, was
not young any more. Besides, Tolstoy’s original style is far from dry, and his novels
are not at all void of persuasive power, subtlety of description, diversity and
perspicacity as Rihani argues, presumably owing to mediocre translations. And,
finally, Tolstoy never borrowed his political, economical and social views from Karl
Marx. These shortcomings, however, cannot eclipse Rihani’s certainty in the
magnitude of his hero. The greatness of Tolstoy, he points out, is a sheer example of
the greatness of Jesus Christ, for both spoke and acted in opposition to petty
reformists full of envy and lust, dreaming to replace the rich of their time; a preacher
of that kind is better to be hanged than to be glorified. Intuitively Rihani grasped the
essentials of Tolstoy’s philosophic outlook, namely his dogmatic candor as shaped by
Isaiah Berlin.15

The artistic world of Tolstoy appears to be much more diverse and
multicolored than his ideas. Hence comes the inner conflict in Tolstoy himself

between the creative artist, whose work is more real than reality, and the destructive
thinker who advocates a single vision of a simple soul, a bitter struggle between his
vital insight and theoretical convictions. In his last, religious, period Tolstoy publicly
denied poetry for its vagueness and artificiality of expression. Privately, however, he
still admired the poems of Pushkin, Tiutchev and early Fet. The sad wisdom, skeptical
irony and religious tolerance of Abul-Ala al-Maari’s verse as felicitously translated
by Amin Rihani might have pleased Tolstoy as well.

> Afearing whom I trust I gain my end,
But trusting, without fear, I lose, my friend;

Much better is the Doubt that gives me peace,
Than all the Faiths which in hell-fire may end.

.....................................................................

> A church, a temple, or a Kaba Stone,
Koran or Bible or a martyre’s bone ¤

All these and more my heart can tolerate
Since my religion now is Love alone.16

Although Tolstoy most likely did not come across the English versions of
Abul-Ala’s poetry Rihani started to publish in 1903, the three names are tightly
interrelated. In his long elegy on the death of Tolstoy (1914), Egyptian poet and
playwright Ahmad Shawqi brought Abu-l-Ala and Tolstoy together, the mediaeval

Arab thinker inquired about the present condition of humanity and his Russian
counterpart sadly explained him that there had been no positive changes ever since.17
For Rihani, too, Abul-Ala and Tolstoy stand side by side in their search for the
universal religion of mankind. It is not a coincidence, therefore, that like Tolstoy
Rihani was curious about Bahaism, as revealed in The Book of Khalid.18 By that time,
after the first two parts of Al-Rihaniyat had appeared, he was called by the Egyptian
press ‘the philosopher of Freike’, not unlike ‘the sage of Yasnaya Poliana’ as the
international media addressed Tolstoy.

Among the many points of similarity between Tolstoy and Rihani (in their life
and literature, in religious, philosophical and social beliefs and concerns), suffice it to
mention here but few.

Due to their anticlerical attitudes and appeal for religious tolerance, both were
excommunicated by their Churches, Tolstoy in 1901, Rihani in 1903. In their writings
they perceive beyond the conventional and generally accepted: thus the method of
estrangement, or seeing familiar things as strange, demonstrated by the way in War
and Peace, echoed in Rihani’s poetic principle of defamiliarization, or innovation in
the treatment of subjects to make them look new.19 Both were inspired by Rousseau
and regarded American transcendentalists as their intellectual comrades-in-arms.

Both were rational idealists in search of truth, love, freedom and universal
unity. Seeking the brotherhood of man, both experienced personal solitude and
fostered loneliness as the pledge of their spiritual independence. Russian aristocrat
and Arabian emigrant, they are akin, sharing a sort of intellectual exile, if we
understand it, together with Edward Said, as metaphorical condition of living outside
of all privileges and superstitions of a given society and inherited culture.20

Incidentally, the last letter Tolstoy started to dictate when he had quitted his
house in Yasnaya Poliana was in English. He began and left unfinished the phrase:
«On my way to the place where I wished to be alone...»21 The last entry in his
intimate diary which he had interrupted in mid-word, was in French: «Fais ce que
doit, ad[vienne que pourra]» (Do what you ought, let come what may).22 It was the
motto Tolstoy had been guided by all his life. Since the deeds of a writer are his
words, one may recall in this respect a saying of Rihani «Say your word and go your
way», the motto borrowed from him by Russian philologist Ignaty Kratchkovsky.

Kratchkovsky was not a writer who could have taught freedom and equity by
his word. He was a scholar and translator who saw his task in bridging Russia and the
realm of Arabic culture. This task became especially clear to him after Tolstoy’s
death. Kratchkovsky indeed personifies freedom of judgment and dignity of conduct
for those whoever knew him. This impact paradoxically follows from his nature, since
he defined himself as ‘the bondsman of duty’: that is the title of the book his disciple
Anna Dolinina wrote about him.23 Based on documentary materials, including diaries,
private and official letters, etc., the book reveals the drama of a scientist who never
ceased to struggle against the dogmatic pressure of authorities and kept his door open
to cultural contacts in spite of the iron curtain. And again Rihani appears as one of the
most important figures in the fight.

It is well-known that Kratchkovsky in the first decade of the 20th century
translated many of Rihani’s writings in prose and poetry.24 In 1910 he met Rihani
accidentally at a newspaper editor’s office in Beirut and left a description of a pale,
thoughtful, slightly sad man, completely free of effusiveness, whom he started to
identify only by the already mentioned motto.25 This was a part of the preface to
Rihani’s Selected works published by Kratchkovsky in 1917, just before the

Bolshevik upheaval. According to his diary, in the dramatic years of 1918-1920 he
had been trying to take comfort in reading Tolstoy.In 1922 his translation of Rihani’s
poetry in prose appeared in a Russian magagazine Vostok.26 Shortly after
Kratchkovsky clashed for the first time with Bolshevik censorship: in 1923 they
banned the printing of his book Arab Emigrants in America, a huge volume
comprising essays, speeches and poems of Ameen Rihani, poems and fragments of
three novels of Kahlil Jibran, a novel by a Brazilian émigré Shukri Khoury,
sociopolitical and critical articles by Suleiman al-Bustani, Louis Cheikho. Amin al-
Greyib, and Nasib Arida. A censor, Volkov, based his prohibition on the authors’
mysticism, individualism, naive nationalism and protest against Party spirit and social
life; Kratchkovsky’s preface was branded as rather superficial with respect to the
social motivation of the chosen works.27 At that period average readership associated
the word emigrant with White Army refugees. As for Rihani’s essay The Descent of
Bolshevism, where he denounced its pseudo-messianic anti-human nature,28 we
cannot assert for certain whether it was known either to the officialdom or to Russian
Orientalists of that time. If the latter knew they kept silent about it until recently in
their effort to save Rihani, Gibran and other Syro-American writers as officially
acceptable figures. And they succeeded in this struggle. Rihani earned a separate
entry in the Soviet Encyclopedia (vol. 21, p.606), and a special book entitled The
Philosopher of Freike was published in Russia and translated into Arabic.29 The only
tribute to Communist authorities was obligatory pledge that Rihani greeted the Great
October Revolution. At that price the disciples of Kratchkovsky managed to publish
his works in various selections and, finally, in a special volume.30

In 1944 Kratchkovsky wrote a brief article where he quoted the philosopher of
Freike who addressed him on the occasion of the Russian publication (1932) of Abul-

Ala’s little known work Epistle on the Angels. Thus, concluded Kratchkovsky, Abul-
Ala a thousand years after his birth by his name alone strengthens the ties of
brotherhood between different countries.31 After all, Tolstoy, Rihani and Abul-Ala
drew no boundaries within the universal realm of human culture and refused to
delineate our legacy into parochial fiefdoms.
