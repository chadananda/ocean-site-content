                      The Purposes and Objectives of Bahá‟í Scholarship

FOREWORD
The present monograph brings together three essays related to Bahá‟í scholarship.
The first of these is entitled “The Purposes and Objectives of Bahá‟í Scholarship” and
is the principal essay (pp. 3-75). The two other essays are entitled “Attaining to the
Knowledge of God” (pp. 76-106) and “The Study of Philosophy” (pp. 107-129).

On 7 July 2000, I completed the first draft of a listing of the purposes and specific
objectives of Bahá‟í scholarship as depicted in four compilations produced by the
Research Department of the Bahá‟í World Centre. On 11 September 2005, I began to
revise this draft and add some commentary, completing the revision on 17 September.
On 14 January 2006, I made some minor revisions, prior to sharing it with various
interested parties. Finally, between September and November and December of
2008, I added many more citations from Bahá‟í texts, and expanded some of the
commentaries.

The numbers in [brackets] denote quotations from “Extracts from the Writings of
Bahá‟u‟lláh and „Abdu‟l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice
on Scholarship” (1995) 1. The numbers in {whatever these are called} denote the
compilation on scholarship prepared in 1979, and the numbers in <this sort of
figure> denote that compiled in 19832. The numbers in (parentheses) denote
quotations from the 1983 compilation entitled "The Importance of Deepening Our
Knowledge and Understanding of the Faith"3. I should note that only the 1995
compilation has the quotations numbered, and, for the ease of identifying selections, I
have numbered them in each of the other compilations, chronologically, from start to
finish. All three compilations were prepared by the Research Department at the
Bahá'í World Centre in Haifa, Israel.

I find that in trying to categorize the Bahá'í teachings, there are often cases where a
particular teaching can fit into more than one category, and others where any category
that one tries to fashion just doesn't seem to fit! In any case, I have tried to organize
these ideas, and I hope others will find this effort useful and that they will improve
upon it.

PURPOSES OF SCHOLARSHIP

1\. to promote the well-being of the world [22], {1}, {7}, {16}, {21}

2\. to establish the present-day requirements of society, in articles and books [23]

3\. to defend the Faith [26], [29]

4\. to protect the believers [27]

5\. to raise up and make victorious the Word of God [27], [30], {6+}, {8}, (50)

6\. to increase the number of believers [27]

7\. to create teachers of the Faith [31], [33], {25}, <10>

8\. to awaken the people, educate mankind, expand the consciousness of men {5},
(31), (37), (49)

9\. to attain to knowledge of God {4}, {6}, {8}, {10}

10\. to discover the truth [70], {9}, {11}, {19}, {27}, <1>, <2>, <4>, <5>, <12>,
<14>

Each principle will now be examined, with the texts articulating that principle reproduced in full,
accompanied by a Commentary authored by the compiler:

1\. to promote the well-being of the world [22], {1}, {7}, {16}, {21}

> True learning is that which is conducive to the well-being of the world, not to pride
> and self-conceit, or to tyranny, violence and pillage. (Bahá'u'lláh, from a Tablet,
> translated from the Persian) [22]

> The learned of the day must direct the people to acquire those branches of
> knowledge which are of use, that both the learned themselves and the generality of
> mankind may derive benefits therefrom. Such academic pursuits as begin and end
> in words alone have never been and will never be of any worth. The majority of
> Persia's learned doctors devote all their lives to the study of a philosophy the ultimate
> yield of which is nothing but words. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, from a Tablet) {1}

> They are busy by night and by day with meticulous research into such sciences as
> are profitable to mankind, and they devote themselves to the training of students of
> capacity. ('Abdu'l-Bahá, The Secret of Divine Civilization, pp. 21-22) {7}

> The world is undoubtedly facing a great crisis and the social, economic and political
> conditions are becoming daily more complex. Should the friends desire to take the
> lead in reforming the world, they should start by educating themselves and
> understand what the troubles and problems really are which baffle the mind of man.
> (Shoghi Effendi, from a letter written on his behalf to an individual believer, dated 27

January 1932) {16}

> The Cause needs more Bahá‟í scholars, people who not only are devoted to it and
> believe in it and are anxious to tell others about it, but also who have a deep grasp of
> the Teachings and their significance, and who can correlate its beliefs with the
> current thoughts and problems of the people of the world. The Cause has the
> remedy for all the world's ills. The reason why more people don't accept it is
> because the Bahá‟ís are not always capable of presenting it to them in a way that
> meets the immediate needs of their minds. (Shoghi Effendi, from a letter written on
> his behalf to an individual believer, dated 21 October 1943; in Canadian Bahá‟í News,
> March 1967, p. 7) {21}
This is indicative of the overall tenor of Bahá‟í intellectual effort, which is meant to result in the
upliftment of humanity, the improvement of human life, the promotion of an ever-advancing
civilization. Our deeds are supposed to exceed our words and not the other way around, and we are
enjoined to devote ourselves to learning and applying sciences that are of benefit rather than those
which begin and end in words. Bahá‟í scholarship is pragmatic, and since the root causes of most
human ailments are spiritual, and its understanding of the spiritual is unitive rather than dualistic,
its pragmatism embraces both the temporal and the supernatural dimensions of human existence.

∆

2\. to establish the present-day requirements of society, in articles and books

\[23\] 
It is therefore urgent that beneficial articles and books be written, clearly and
> definitely establishing what the present-day requirements of the people are, and what
> will conduce to the happiness and advancement of society. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, from The
> Secret of Divine Civilization, pp. 109-110) [23]
There are two ways of understanding this imperative--the first is to perceive it as a call to be
physicians to the body of humanity, which conforms to Bahá‟u‟lláh's vision of what His followers are
to be doing. Hence, we are called upon to diagnose the "present-day requirements of society", in
keeping with the principle that we are to be preoccupied with the needs of our own day rather than
those of a past or future period of time. A second way of understanding this is that we should
promulgate the Bahá‟í teachings, as they pertain to the various problems encountered in contemporary
society, inasmuch as these teachings constitute the sovereign remedy for the ills of mankind. These two
ways of deconstructing the imperative are complementary, and both are in harmony with the Bahá‟í
teachings. The second part of the imperative is that we write about these matters, in articles and in
books, and this presumes, I would argue, that we publish those articles and books, so that they have
the potential of impacting the lives of others. Hence, Bahá‟í scholarship should be intimately involved
in gauging the needs of society and actively publishing treatises that address those needs.

∆

3\. to defend the Faith [26], [29]

> If any man were to arise to defend, in his writings, the Cause of God against its
> assailants, such a man, however inconsiderable his share, shall be so honoured in the
> world to come that the Concourse on high would envy his glory. (Bahá‟u‟lláh,
> Gleanings, CLIV) [26]

> There is an answer in the teachings for everything; unfortunately the majority of the
> Bahá‟ís, however intensely devoted and sincere they may be, lack for the most part
> the necessary scholarship and wisdom to reply to and refute the claims and attacks of
> people with some education and standing. (Shoghi Effendi, from a letter written on
> his behalf to an individual believer, dated 25 September 1942) [29]

> The second of these spiritual standards which apply to the possessor of knowledge is
> that he should be the defender of his faith. [SDC:41]

> Definition: It is obvious that these holy words do not refer exclusively to searching
> out the implications of the Law, observing the forms of worship, avoiding greater
> and lesser sins, practicing the religious ordinances, and by all these methods,
> protecting the Faith. [SDC:41]

> (201.0) They mean rather that the whole population should be protected in every way;
> [SDC:41]

> (202.0) that every effort should be exerted to adopt a combination of all possible
> measures to raise up the Word of God, [SDC:41]

(203.0) increase the number of believers, [SDC:41]

(204.0) promote the Faith of God and exalt it [SDC:41]

(205.0) and make it victorious over other religions. [SDC:41]

> If, indeed, the Muslim religious authorities had persevered along these lines as they
> ought to have done, by now every nation on earth would have been gathered into the
> shelter of the unity of God and the bright fire of "that He may make it victorious over
> every other religion" [Qur‟án 9:33; 48:28; 61:9] would have flamed out like the sun in
> the midmost heart of the world. [SDC:41]

> Now if the illustrious people of the one true God, the recipients of His confirmations,
> the objects of His Divine assistance, should put forth all their strength, and with
> complete dedication, relying upon God and turning aside from all else but Him,
> should adopt procedures for spreading the Faith and should bend all their efforts to
> this end, it is certain that His Divine light would envelop the whole earth. [SDC:43]

This cannot be effected through violence, or through fanaticism and unreasoning
religious zeal, but rather through its avoidance:

> Not through violence: If, however, they would carefully examine this question, they
> would see that in this day and age the sword is not a suitable means for
> promulgating the Faith, for it would only fill peoples' hearts with revulsion and
> terror. According to the Divine Law of Muhammad, it is not permissible to compel
> the People of the Book to acknowledge and accept the Faith. While [SDC:44] it is a
> sacred obligation devolving on every conscientious believer in the unity of God to
> guide mankind to the truth, the Traditions "I am a Prophet by the sword" and "I am
> commanded to threaten the lives of the people until they say, `There is none other
> God but God'" referred to the idolaters of the Days of Ignorance, who in their
> blindness and bestiality had sunk below the level of human beings. A faith born of
> sword thrusts could hardly be relied upon, and would for any trifling cause revert to
> error and unbelief. After the ascension of Muhammad, and His passing to "the seat
> of truth, in the presence of the potent King," [Qur‟án 54:55] the tribes around
> Medina apostatized from their Faith, turning back to the idolatry of pagan times.

> As for the sword, it will only produce a man who is outwardly a believer, and
> inwardly a traitor and apostate. [SDC:46]

Not through fanaticism and unreasoning religious zeal:

Rather, the purpose of His consummate wisdom was to free the people from the
chains of fanaticism which had bound them hand and foot, and to forestall those very
objections which today confuse the mind and trouble the conscience of the simple
and helpless. [SDC:29]

One of the principal reasons why people of other religions have shunned and failed
to become converted to the Faith of God is fanaticism and unreasoning religious
zeal. See for example the divine words that were addressed to Muhammad, the Ark of
Salvation, the Luminous Countenance and Lord of Men, bidding Him to be gentle
with the people and long-suffering: "Debate with them in the kindliest
manner."[Qur‟án 16:126] That Blessed Tree Whose light was "neither of the East nor
of the West"[Qur‟án 24:35] and Who cast over all the peoples of the earth the
sheltering shade of a measureless grace, showed forth infinite kindness and
forbearance in His dealings with every one. In these words, likewise, were Moses
and Áron commanded to challenge Pharaoh, Lord of the Stakes: [Dhu'l-Awtad is
variously rendered by translators of the Qur‟án as The Impaler, The Contriver of the
Stakes, The Lord of a Strong Dominion, The One Surrounded by Ministers, etc.
Awtad means pegs or tent stakes. See Qur‟án 38:11 and 89:9] "Speak ye to him with
gentle speech."[Qur'án 20:46]
Although the noble conduct of the Prophets and Holy Ones of God is widely known,
and it is indeed, until the coming of the Hour, [Qur‟án 33:63: "Men will ask Thee of
`the Hour.' Say: The knowledge of it is with God alone." Cf. also 22:1, "the
earthquake of the Hour," etc. See also Matthew 24:36, 42, etc. To Bahá‟ís, this refers
to the Advent of the Báb and Bahá‟u‟lláh.] in every aspect of life [SDC:54] an
excellent pattern for all mankind to follow, nevertheless some have remained
neglectful of and separated from these qualities of extraordinary sympathy and
loving-kindness, and have been prevented from attaining to the inner significances of
the Holy Books. Not only do they scrupulously shun the adherents of religions other
than their own, they do not even permit themselves to show them common courtesy.
If one is not allowed to associate with another, how can one guide him out of the
dark and empty night of denial, of "there-is-no-God," into the bright morning of
belief, and the affirmation, "but God."[Cf. the Islamic confession of faith, sometimes
called the two testimonies: "I testify that there is no God but God and Muhammad is
the Prophet of God."] And how can one urge him on and encourage him to rise up
out of the abyss of perdition and ignorance and climb the heights of salvation and
knowledge? Consider justly: had not Hanzala treated Nu'man with true friendship,
showing him kindness and hospitality, could he have brought the King and a great
number of other idolaters to acknowledge the unity of God? To keep aloof from
people, to shun them, to be harsh with them, will make them shrink away, while
affection and consideration, mildness and forbearance will attract their hearts toward
God. If a true believer when meeting an individual from a foreign country should
express revulsion, and [SDC:55] should speak the horrible words forbidding
association with foreigners and referring to them as "unclean," the stranger would
be grieved and offended to such a point that he would never accept the Faith, even if
he should see, taking place before his very eyes, the miracle of the splitting of the
moon. The results of shunning him would be this, that if there had been in his heart
some faint inclination toward God, he would repent of it, and would flee away from
the sea of faith into the wastes of oblivion and unbelief. And upon returning home to

> his own country he would publish in the press statements to the effect that such and
> such a nation was utterly lacking in the qualifications of a civilized people. [SDC:55]

> To maintain his leadership, he will everlastingly direct the masses toward that
> prejudice and fanaticism which subvert the very base of civilization…O people of
> Persia! Open your eyes! Pay heed! Release yourselves from this blind following of
> the bigots, this senseless imitation which is the principal reason why men fall away
> into paths of ignorance and degradation. [SDC:104]

The primary means for this defense of his Faith is through the exalted character of his
deeds:

> In spite of this agonizing requital, the Christians continued to teach the Cause of
> God, and they never drew a sword from its scabbard or even so much as grazed a
> cheek. Then in the end the Faith of Christ encompassed [SDC:46] the whole earth,
> so that in Europe and America no traces of other religions were left, and today in
> Asia and Africa and Oceania, large masses of people are living within the sanctuary
> of the Four Gospels. It has now by the above irrefutable proofs been fully
> established that the Faith of God must be propagated through human perfections,
> through qualities that are excellent and pleasing, and spiritual behavior. If a soul of
> his own accord advances toward God he will be accepted at the Threshold of
> Oneness, for such a one is free of personal considerations, of greed and selfish
> interests, and he has taken refuge within the sheltering protection of his Lord. He
> will become known among men as trustworthy and truthful, temperate and
> scrupulous, high-minded and loyal, incorruptible and God-fearing. In this way the
> primary purpose in revealing the Divine Law--which is to bring about happiness in
> the after life and civilization and the refinement of character in this--will be realized.

[SDC:46]

> Observe how one individual, and he a man of the desert, to outward seeming
> unknown and of no station--because he showed forth one of the qualities of the pure
> in heart, was able to deliver this proud sovereign and a great company of others from
> the dark night of unbelief and guide them into the morning of salvation; to save them
> from the perdition of idolatry and bring them to the shores of the oneness of God,
> and to put an end to practices of the sort which blight a whole society and reduce the
> peoples to barbarism. One must think deeply over this, and grasp its meaning.

[SDC:52]
Apologetics has been a requirement of religious scholarship for many millennia, and Bahá‟u‟lláh
strongly encourages His followers to defend the Faith against attacks in writing, so it will continue to
be an integral part of Bahá‟í scholarship in the future. „Abdu‟l-Bahá expands upon this theme of
defending the Faith in SDC, and since it is of such vital importance, His remarks have been cited in
their entirety.

> But acquired infallibility is not a natural necessity; on the contrary, it is a ray of the
> bounty of infallibility which shines from the Sun of Reality upon hearts, and grants a
> share and portion of itself to souls. Although these souls have not essential
> infallibility, still they are under the protection of God -- that is to say, God preserves

> cause believing souls to fall into error, and thus the foundation of the Religion of
> God would be overturned, which would not be fitting nor worthy of God. („Abdu‟l-
> Bahá, Some Answered Questions, Chapter 45, p. 172)

> I hope that through the bounty and favors of the Most Glorious Lord, in this new
> age, the regions of the West become the East of the Sun of Truth, the believers of
> God become the dawning-places of lights, the manifestors of the signs, be protected

> of the Kingdom those who are deprived, to confer a share from the never-ending
> outpouring upon those who are helpless, to become the heralds of the Kingdom and
> to call the inhabitants of this terrestrial world to the Celestial Realm.
> O ye Cohorts of God! Today in the present world each community is wandering in a

of the world, that the people of the city may all cry out: "This person is
unquestionably a Bahái; for this manners, his behavior, his conduct, his morals, his
nature and his disposition are of the attributes of the Baháis." Until you do attain to
this station, you have not fulfilled the Covenant and the Testament of God. For
according to the irrefutable texts, He has taken from us a firm covenant that we may
live and act in accord with the divine exhortations, commands and lordly teachings.
(„Abdu‟l-Bahá, Tablets of „Abdu‟l-Bahá, v1, pp. 40-42)

O maid-servant of God! Verily, the tests and trials of God are very great and very
violent. Beseech thou God to protect thee from all doubts and to guard thee from the
interpretations of parabolical1 verses, as made by those who know not in what valley
they are roving, who speak according to their own selfish purposes and after their
own evil inclinations; who accept and then reject; who believe in God and then deny
Him; and who appear firm and then backslide; thus thou beholdest these oscillating
daily.
"Leave them to amuse themselves with their own vain discourses," and turn thou to
the light of the Testament, and rejoice at the bounty of the effulgence, and seek
shelter under the shadow of the standard of the Covenant. Thou wilt soon find it
fluttering on the highest summits of glory, surrounded by the valiant hosts of the
angels of heaven and assisted by spiritual armies of great number that proceed from
the Supreme Concourse.
O my tender friend!
Verily, the union between myself and thee is on a solid foundation and a well made
basis. Neither the winds can remove it nor the events of time annihilate it. It is
everlasting and eternal, heavenly, spiritual and divine, and it is of no end or
termination. Consequently be rejoiced at these words which cheer the hearts of the
righteous and the souls of the pious when hearing them.
O thou lamp who art illuminated with the light of the Love of God!
Leave thou the world and abandon the people and turn unto the Kingdom of thy
independent Lord. Beseech Him every morn and eve and supplicate to the Gate of
His Oneness to make thee firm and steadfast in the Testament and to guard thee
from all calamities, with the eye of His protection, and protect thee from the tests
which are (so violent) as the whirlwinds which uproot trees. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, Tablets
of „Abdu‟l-Bahá, v1, pp. 72-73)

These bodies [Spiritual Assemblies] have the sacred obligation to help, advise,
protect and guide the believers in every way within their power when appealed to --
indeed they were established must for the purpose of keeping order and unity and
obedience to the law of God amongst the believers. You should go to them as a child
would to its parents... (From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an
individual believer, September 28, 1941: The Local Spiritual Assembly, compiled by
the Universal House of Justice; in Lights of Guidance, p. 3)

The winds of test and trial have blown upon our Faith more than once, and he
strongly feels that old believers like yourself should do everything in their power to
protect the younger Bahá'ís, to strengthen their faith, deepen them in the Covenant,
and enable them to take full refuge in the Will and Testament of the beloved Master,
that impregnable fortress He built for our safety when He Himself should have gone

> from our sight. (From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi dated 26 October
> 1941 to an individual believer; in The Compilation of Compilations, vol I, #2270, p.

430)
The protection of the believers is a multi-faceted enterprise. The believers must be protected against the
assault of the enemies of the Faith, in some cases from the unjust actions of governments, as in Iran
and other Islamicate2 societies; from religious communities, which oppression, while chiefly found in
Islamicate societies at present, is predicted to spread to Christian and Hindu populations in the
future; from prejudiced employers, teachers, neighbors, who may find some pretext for attacking the
believers. This is a separate enterprise from defending the Faith, inasmuch as apologetics is aimed at
responding to attacks in writing on the Faith itself, rather than attacks on the believers. Another
dimension of protecting the believers is internal, and involves ministering to assaults upon the faith
and peace of mind of the believers by the unwise and the malevolent among their co-religionists. The
excommunication of a dissident and trouble-making adherent of the Faith is the most drastic of
measures, and prior or in place of this step being taken, all other efforts must be made to protect the
believers from the pernicious influence of the misguided one. Finally, „Abdu‟l-Bahá includes in His
description of defence of the Faith, "that the whole population should be protected in every way"
[SDC:41], and much thought must be given to this universal act of protection, to ways in which
scholarship can protect all of humanity from harm of any kind. We return then to the metaphor cited
by Bahá‟u‟lláh to describe the efforts of His followers, who are to be the true physicians to the ailing
body of humankind, applying the remedy revealed by God.

Whoso ariseth to teach Our Cause must needs detach himself from all earthly things,
and regard, at all times, the triumph of Our Faith as his supreme objective. This
hath, verily, been decreed in the Guarded Tablet. And when he determineth to leave
his home, for the sake of the Cause of his Lord, let him put his whole trust in God, as
the best provision for his journey, and array himself with the robe of virtue. Thus
hath it been decreed by God, the Almighty, the All-Praised. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Gleanings
from the Writings of Bahá‟u‟lláh, pp. 334-335)

I implore Thee, O my God, by Thy name whereby all the kindreds of the earth have
wailed, except such as Thou hast safeguarded with Thine unerring protection and
sheltered beneath the shadow of Thy transcendent mercy, to make us so firm in Thy
Cause and steadfast in Thy love that were Thy servants to rise up against Thee and
Thy people turn away from Thee, and no one would remain on earth to invoke Thy
name or set his face toward the sanctuary of communion with Thee and the Kába of
Thy sanctity, I would still arise singly and alone to render Thy Cause victorious, to
exalt Thy word, to proclaim Thy sovereignty, and to celebrate the praise of Thine
august Self. (Compilation on The Importance of Obligatory Prayer and Fasting)

Although the policy of Sultan Abdu'l-Hamid was harsher than ever; although he
constantly insisted on his Captive's strict confinement -- still, the Blessed Beauty
now lived, as everyone knows, with all power and glory. Some of the time Bahá'u'lláh
would spend at the Mansion, and again, at the farm village of Mazra'ih; for a while
He would sojourn in Haifa, and occasionally His tent would be pitched on the
heights of Mount Carmel. Friends from everywhere presented themselves and gained
an audience. The people and the government authorities witnessed it all, yet no one
so much as breathed a word. And this is one of Bahá'u'lláh's greatest miracles: that
He, a captive, surrounded Himself with panoply and He wielded power. The prison
changed into a palace, the jail itself became a Garden of Eden. Such a thing has not
occurred in history before; no former age has seen its like: that a man confined to a
prison should move about with authority and might; that one in chains should carry
the fame of the Cause of God to the high heavens, should win splendid victories in
both East and West, and should, by His almighty pen, subdue the world. Such is the

Faithful, p. 27)

Those "kindreds, people and nations" signify those who are gathered under the
shadow of the Qur'án, not permitting the Cause and Law of God to be, in outward
appearance, entirely destroyed and annihilated -- for there are prayer and fasting
among them -- but the fundamental principles of the Religion of God, which are
morals and conduct, with the knowledge of divine mysteries, have disappeared; the
light of the virtues of the world of humanity, which is the result of the love and
knowledge of God, is extinguished; and the darkness of tyranny, oppression, satanic
passions and desires has become victorious. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, Some Answered
Questions, pp. 52-53)

But as to you, O ye firm and steadfast, be straightforward in the Cause of God, let
your feet be firm in the Religion of God, and arise with every effort within your power

In Western Christian practice, apologetics is concerned not merely with defending the Faith against
attacks, but with promulgating the Faith as well. „Abdu‟l-Bahá includes this dimension in His
development of this theme in SDC, indicating "that every effort should be exerted to adopt a
combination of all possible measures to raise up the Word of God…promote the Faith of God and
exalt it and make it victorious over other religions. [SDC:41]" This vision is unapologetically
triumphalist, and is corroborated by many other source texts in the Bahá‟í Writings. The purpose of
teaching and promulgating the Cause, in our deeds and our words, and, in the case of scholars, in
speeches and publications, is to "raise up and make victorious the Word of God". „Abdu‟l-Bahá
stipulates (and also Bahá‟u‟lláh), that this cannot be effected through violence or through fanaticism

and unreasoning religious zeal, but through deeds of sterling character, through service to humanity,
and through unparalleled and unsurpassed knowledge, wisdom and eloquence. Making the Faith
victorious does not in itself increase the number of believers. This triumph may take many forms, in
which the prestige of the Faith, the popularity of the Faith among men of learning and influence, the
liberation of the Faith from onerous legal and social restrictions.

Although grouped with the foregoing purpose, of making victorious the Word of God, the imperative
"to increase the number of believers" [SDC:41] has a separate trajectory. In order to win over the
hearts and minds of individuals, and attract them to this Cause, and beyond that to nurture their
commitment to the Cause so that they remain believers over the course of a lifetime, this is a distinct
purpose of Bahá‟í scholarship. There is no profit to simply signing up new believers so their names
will be on some list and their numbers cited to bolster the confidence of the community and increase its
prestige in the wider society. This is without substance. What Bahá‟í scholars are called upon to do
is to bring new believers into the community, and assist them to remain in the community and to live
lives consecrated to the Bahá‟í teachings.

They that have forsaken their country for the purpose of teaching Our Cause -- these
shall the Faithful Spirit strengthen through its power. A company of Our chosen
angels shall go forth with them, as bidden by Him Who is the Almighty, the All-
Wise. How great the blessedness that awaiteth him that hath attained the honor of
serving the Almighty! By My life! No act, however great, can compare with it, except
such deeds as have been ordained by God, the All-Powerful, the Most Mighty. Such a
service is, indeed, the prince of all goodly deeds, and the ornament of every goodly
act. Thus hath it been ordained by Him Who is the Sovereign Revealer, the Ancient
of Days.
Whoso ariseth to teach Our Cause must needs detach himself from all earthly things,
and regard, at all times, the triumph of Our Faith as his supreme objective. This
hath, verily, been decreed in the Guarded Tablet. And when he determineth to leave
his home, for the sake of the Cause of his Lord, let him put his whole trust in God, as
the best provision for his journey, and array himself with the robe of virtue. Thus
hath it been decreed by God, the Almighty, the All-Praised. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Gleanings
from the Writings of Bahá‟u‟lláh, CLVÍ, pp. 334-335)

God hath prescribed unto every one the duty of teaching His Cause. Whoever ariseth
to discharge this duty, must needs, ere he proclaimeth His Message, adorn himself
with the ornament of an upright and praiseworthy character, so that his words may
attract the hearts of such as are receptive to his call. Without it, he can never hope to
influence his hearers. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá‟u‟lláh,
CLVÍI, p. 334)

God hath prescribed unto everyone the duty of teaching His Cause. Whoever ariseth
to discharge this duty, must needs, ere he proclaimeth His Message, adorn himself
with the ornament of an upright and praiseworthy character, so that his words may
attract the hearts of such as are receptive to his call. Without it, he can never hope to
influence his hearers. Thus doth God instruct you. He, verily, is the Ever-Forgiving,
the Most Compassionate.
They who exhort others unto justice, while themselves committing iniquity, stand
accused of falsehood by the inmates of the Kingdom and by those who circle round
the throne of their Lord, the Almighty, the Beneficent, for that which their tongues
have uttered. Commit not, O people, that which dishonoureth your name and the fair
name of the Cause of God amongst men. Beware lest ye approach that which your
minds abhor. Fear God and follow not in the footsteps of them that are gone astray.
Deal not treacherously with the substance of your neighbour. Be ye trustworthy on
earth, and withhold not from the poor the things given unto you by God through His
grace. He, verily, will bestow upon you the double of what ye possess. He, in truth, is
the All-Bounteous, the Most Generous.
Say: We have ordained that our Cause be taught through the power of utterance.
Beware lest ye dispute idly with anyone. Whoso ariseth wholly for the sake of his
Lord to teach His Cause, the Holy Spirit shall strengthen him and inspire him with
that which will illumine the heart of the world, how much more the hearts of those
who seek Him. O people of Bahá! Subdue the citadels of men's hearts with the
swords of wisdom and of utterance. They that dispute, as prompted by their desires,
are indeed wrapped in a palpable veil. Say: The sword of wisdom is hotter than
summer heat, and sharper than blades of steel, if ye do but understand. Draw it forth

in My name and through the power of My might, and conquer then with it the cities
of the hearts of them that have secluded themselves in the stronghold of their corrupt
desires. Thus biddeth you the Pen of the All-Glorious, whilst seated beneath the
swords of the wayward. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, pp. 78-79)

We heard that which the person in question hath mentioned regarding certain
teachers of the Faith. Indeed he hath spoken truly. Some heedless souls roam the
lands in the name of God, actively engaged in ruining His Cause, and call it
promoting and teaching the Word of God; and this notwithstanding that the
qualifications of the teachers of the Faith, like unto stars, shine resplendent
throughout the heavens of the divine Tablets. Every fair-minded person testifieth
and every man of insight is well aware that the One true God -- exalted be His glory -
- hath unceasingly set forth and expounded that which will elevate the station and
will exalt the rank of the children of men. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Tablets of Bahá‟u‟lláh, p. 58)

Restrain thou the inhabitants of those regions from provocative acts, from strife,
dissension or aught else that would create trouble. That which is praiseworthy in
these days is the promotion of the Cause. For instance if those people who pursue
certain aims were to dedicate themselves to the teaching of the Cause, all the
dwellers of those regions would, ere long, be invested with the mantle of faith.
Should anyone perceive the sweetness of the following passage in the Tablet revealed
in honour of Nabil of Qa'in3, he would readily comprehend the significance of
assistance: Human utterance is an essence which aspireth to exert its influence and
needeth moderation. As to its influence, this is conditional upon refinement, which
in turn is dependent upon hearts which are detached and pure. As to its moderation,
this hath to be combined with tact and wisdom as prescribed in the Holy Scriptures
and Tablets.
O My Name! Utterance must needs possess penetrating power. For if bereft of this
quality it would fail to exert influence. And this penetrating influence dependeth on
the spirit being pure and the heart stainless. Likewise it needeth moderation, without
which the hearer would be unable to bear it, rather he would manifest opposition
from the very outset. And moderation will be obtained by blending utterance with the
tokens of divine wisdom which are recorded in the sacred Books and Tablets. Thus
when the essence of one's utterance is endowed with these two requisites it will
prove highly effective and will be the prime factor in transforming the souls of men.
This is the station of supreme victory and celestial dominion. Whoso attaineth
thereto is invested with the power to teach the Cause of God and to prevail over the
hearts and minds of men. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Tablets of Bahá‟u‟lláh, pp. 198-199)

Now is the moment in which to cleanse thyself with the waters of detachment that
have flowed out from the Supreme Pen, and to ponder, wholly for the sake of God,
those things which, time and again, have been sent down or manifested, and then to
strive, as much as lieth in thee, to quench, through the power of wisdom and the
force of thy utterance, the fire of enmity and hatred which smouldereth in the hearts
of the peoples of the world. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 12)

And in another connection: "O peoples of the earth! Haste ye to do the pleasure of

Bahá‟u‟lláh makes reference to the “learned in Bahá” without defining the precise
nature of these persons and their learning:

From this we might conclude that “the learned ones in Bahá” are the members of the
House of Justice…but, according to the Kitáb-i-„Ahd, there are “the rulers and the
learned in Bahá”, and it appears that these are not one and the same. The House of
Justice is distinguished from “the people of Bahá who speak not except by His leave and
judge not save in accordance with what God hath decreed in this Tablet -- lo, they are the
champions of victory betwixt heaven and earth” so we should not be surprised if the
“learned in Bahá” are not identical with the members of the House of Justice.

The Guardian defined the meaning of this appellation “learned in Bahá” in a letter
written in Persian to the Bahá‟ís of Iran and dated 4 November 1931:

> In this holy cycle the 'learned' are, on the one hand, the Hands of the Cause of God,
> and, on the other, the teachers and diffusers of His teachings who do not rank as
> Hands, but who have attained an eminent position in the teaching work. As to the
> 'rulers' they refer to the members of the Local, National and International House of
> Justice. The duties of each of these souls will be determined in the future.10

This interpretation was further elucidated by the Universal House of Justice as
follows:

> The Hands of the Cause of God, the Counsellors and the members of the Auxiliary
> Boards fall within the definition of the 'learned' given by the beloved Guardian. Thus
> they are intimately interrelated and it is not incorrect to refer to the three ranks
> collectively as one institution. "However, each is also a separate institution in
> itself....”11

It should however be affirmed that Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s words often have multiple meanings,
and that the Guardian did not indicate that the exclusive meaning of the “learned in
Bahá” is embodied in the Hands of the Cause, the Counselors and the members of
their Auxiliary Boards. The Guardian said that this appellation also means, “the
teachers and diffusers of His teachings who do not rank as Hands, but who have attained an
eminent position in the teaching work.” What is clear is that these “learned in Bahá”
are not religious professionals12, trained in religious sciences (and arts) and possessed
of prerogatives and powers like the clerical orders that have existed and continue to

exist in other religious communities. These are divine physicians 13, they are teachers
of the Cause of God14, they are servants of humanity 15, and they are teachers of the
Faith.

While the Bahá‟í Writings do not envision the creation of a professional ecclesiastical elite, either to
administer sacraments, to elaborate and rule upon points of law, to evangelize the general population,
or to guide the spiritual life of the individual and the community, they do articulate the need for
universal learning (the result of universal education), for professional educators, and for individuals
who are proficient in sciences and arts and crafts. Finally, it endorses a model of comprehensive
learning, in SDC, which will be the ideal and the model for Bahá‟í scholarship for centuries and
perhaps millennia. Inasmuch as Bahá‟u‟lláh calls upon every Bahá‟í to teach the Faith and every
Bahá‟í to be schooled and become learned, this purpose of Bahá‟í scholarship is not specialized to
professional scholars. The Universal House of Justice has pointed out tirelessly that there are no
formal arrangements made for professional scholars which would set them apart from the Bahá‟í
population as a whole. On the other hand, one of the most honorable and praised professions is that
of educator, and education about the Faith must begin at the start of life, with the parents having this
responsibility unless they cannot discharge it in which case it defaults to those appointed for the
purpose by the House of Justice; as children mature, while their parents continue to bear the principal
responsibility for their education, it becomes increasingly likely that this responsibility will be delegated
to professional educators. Such educators are singled out by Bahá‟u‟lláh for a share of inheritance,

fragrance. They waken those who sleep. They bring awareness to the unheeding, and a portion to the outcast, and to the
hopeless, hope. If in this day a soul shall act according to the precepts and the counsels of God, he will serve as a divine
physician to mankind, and like the trump of Israfil, he will call the dead of this contingent world to life; for the
confirmations of the Abha Realm are never interrupted, and such a virtuous soul hath, to befriend him, the unfailing
help of the Company on high. Thus shall a sorry gnat become an eagle in the fullness of his strength, and a feeble
sparrow change to a royal falcon in the heights of ancient glory.” („Abdu'l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings

which, apart from this profession, is devoted entirely to family members. Finally, teaching the Faith is
a responsibility of those who are learned in the sciences, arts and crafts, and indeed, such spiritual
education is envisioned by Bahá‟u‟lláh as complementing practical knowledge, and the capacity to
apply spiritual principles to the solution of temporal problems. Hence, one of the aims of Bahá‟í
scholarship is to train educators, not in seminaries and for ecclesiastical careers, but in institutions of
higher learning and for careers in education, in the sciences and arts and crafts--instructors, professors,
trainers, who will be teaching the Faith through their professions.

We haven't yet considered the actual content of programs which will create teachers of the Faith.
Bahá‟u‟lláh has written regarding the prerequisites of Bahá‟í teachers, and „Abdu‟l-Bahá has
reiterated these principles and elaborated upon them. He also speaks of the methodology of how we
can convey the Bahá‟í teachings to others in such a way that their hearts and minds will be touched
and they will become our friends and even our fellow believers. For example, in His talks, which are
models in themselves of how to teach Westerners, He speaks of needing to marshal rational as well as
traditional and spiritual proofs in support of the Bahá‟í teachings. Likewise, Shoghi Effendi advised
Bahá‟í teachers to employ certain methodologies, for example, he urged them to learn the language of
the target audience (and this applies even to the mode of verbal expression of particular professions
and cultural sub-groups as well as to the actual tongue of preference), and in most cases to proceed
gradually and without shocking their listeners, from the familiar to the new, from the simple to the
challenging, from the particular interests and issues of the individual or collective to the overall vision
of reality found in the teachings. These counsels are integral to the preparation of Bahá‟í teachers.

The education of mankind is, above all, a spiritual imperative, and here are some
references to this principle:

> The beloved of the Merciful must show forth such character and conduct among His
> creatures, that the fragrance of their holiness may be shed upon the whole world, and

(„Abdu‟l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of „Abdu‟l-Bahá, pp. 10-11)

(„Abdu‟l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 170)

The education of mankind is also a social principle of Bahá‟u‟lláh, Who called for
universal education of all people. „Abdu‟l-Bahá articulated this principle early on in
The Secret of Divine Civilization and throughout His talks in the West:

> It is, furthermore, a vital necessity to establish schools throughout Persia, even in the
> smallest country towns and villages, and to encourage the people in every possible
> way to have their children learn to read and write. If necessary, education should
> even be made compulsory. Until the nerves and arteries of the nation stir into life,
> every measure that is attempted will prove vain; for the people are as the human
> body, and determination and the will to struggle are as the soul, and a soulless body

does not move. This dynamic power is present to a superlative degree in the very
nature of the Persian people, and the spread of education will release it. („Abdu‟l-
Bahá, The Secret of Divine Civilization, pp. 111-112)

To accept and observe a distinction which God has not intended in creation is
ignorance and superstition. The fact which is to be considered, however, is that
woman, having formerly been deprived, must now be allowed equal opportunities
with man for education and training. There must be no difference in their education.
Until the reality of equality between man and woman is fully established and
attained, the highest social development of mankind is not possible. Even granted
that woman is inferior to man in some degree of capacity or accomplishment, this or
any other distinction would continue to be productive of discord and trouble. The
only remedy is education, opportunity; for equality means equal qualification. In
brief, the assumption of superiority by man will continue to be depressing to the
ambition of woman, as if her attainment to equality was creationally impossible;
woman's aspiration toward advancement will be checked by it, and she will gradually
become hopeless. On the contrary, we must declare that her capacity is equal, even
greater than man's. This will inspire her with hope and ambition, and her
susceptibilities for advancement will continually increase. She must not be told and
taught that she is weaker and inferior in capacity and qualification. If a pupil is told
that his intelligence is less than his fellow pupils, it is a very great drawback and
handicap to his progress. He must be encouraged to advance by the statement, "You
are most capable, and if you endeavor, you will attain the highest degree."
It is my hope that the banner of equality may be raised throughout the five
continents where as yet it is not fully recognized and established. In this enlightened
world of the West woman has advanced an immeasurable degree beyond the women
of the Orient. And let it be known once more that until woman and man recognize
and realize equality, social and political progress here or anywhere will not be
possible. For the world of humanity consists of two parts or members: one is woman;
the other is man. Until these two members are equal in strength, the oneness of
humanity cannot be established, and the happiness and felicity of mankind will not
be a reality. God willing, this is to be so. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, The Promulgation of
Universal Peace, pp. 76-77)

Among other teachings and principles Bahá'u'lláh counsels the education of all
members of society. No individual should be denied or deprived of intellectual
training, although each should receive according to capacity. None must be left in
the grades of ignorance, for ignorance is a defect in the human world. All mankind
must be given a knowledge of science and philosophy -- that is, as much as may be
deemed necessary. All cannot be scientists and philosophers, but each should be
educated according to his needs and deserts. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, The Promulgation of
Universal Peace, p. 108)

Furthermore, the education of woman is more necessary and important than that of
man, for woman is the trainer of the child from its infancy. If she be defective and
imperfect herself, the child will necessarily be deficient; therefore, imperfection of
woman implies a condition of imperfection in all mankind, for it is the mother who
rears, nurtures and guides the growth of the child. This is not the function of the

father. If the educator be incompetent, the educated will be correspondingly lacking.
This is evident and incontrovertible. Could the student be brilliant and accomplished
if the teacher is illiterate and ignorant? The mothers are the first educators of
mankind; if they be imperfect, alas for the condition and future of the race. („Abdu‟l-
Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, pp. 133-134)

He promulgated the adoption of the same course of education for man and woman.
Daughters and sons must follow the same curriculum of study, thereby promoting
unity of the sexes. When all mankind shall receive the same opportunity of education
and the equality of men and women be realized, the foundations of war will be utterly
destroyed. Without equality this will be impossible because all differences and
distinction are conducive to discord and strife. Equality between men and women is
conducive to the abolition of warfare for the reason that women will never be willing
to sanction it. Mothers will not give their sons as sacrifices upon the battlefield after
twenty years of anxiety and loving devotion in rearing them from infancy, no matter
what cause they are called upon to defend. There is no doubt that when women
obtain equality of rights, war will entirely cease among mankind. („Abdu‟l-Bahá,
The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 174)

Eighth, education is essential, and all standards of training and teaching throughout
the world of mankind should be brought into conformity and agreement; a universal
curriculum should be established, and the basis of ethics be the same. („Abdu‟l-
Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 182)

Bahá'u'lláh has announced that inasmuch as ignorance and lack of education are
barriers of separation among mankind, all must receive training and instruction.
Through this provision the lack of mutual understanding will be remedied and the
unity of mankind furthered and advanced. Universal education is a universal law. It
is, therefore, incumbent upon every father to teach and instruct his children
according to his possibilities. If he is unable to educate them, the body politic, the
representative of the people, must provide the means for their education. („Abdu‟l-
Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 300)

Seventh, the necessity of education for all mankind is evident. Children especially
must be trained and taught. If the parent cannot afford to do this owing to lack of
means, the body politic must make necessary provision for its accomplishment.
Through the broadening spirit of education illiteracy will disappear, and
misunderstandings due to ignorance will pass away.             („Abdu‟l-Bahá, The
Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 317)

All are human beings. Why have the people of America advanced to a high degree of
civilization while the tribes of central Africa remain in extreme ignorance and
barbarism? The difference and distinction between them is the degree of education.
This is unquestioned. The people of Europe and America have been uplifted by
education and training from the world of defects and have ascended toward the
realm of perfection, whereas the people of Africa, denied educational development,
remain in a natural condition of illiteracy and deprivation, for nature is incomplete
and defective. Education is a necessity. If a piece of ground be left in its natural and

> original state, it will either become a thorny waste or be covered by worthless weeds.
> When cleared and cultivated, this same unproductive field will yield plentiful
> harvests of food for human sustenance.
> This same difference is noticeable among animals; some have been domesticated,
> educated, others left wild. The proof is clear that the world of nature is imperfect, the

> 330)

What a wonderful imperative to inspire scholars for the coming millennia! The scholar as agent of
awakening, of education, of expanding consciousness is very attractive because it underlines the
spiritual dynamic involved in learning. Learning is not a passive, mechanical process with no
profound influence upon the learner. Learning changes us, for the better or for the worse, and if the
for better, potentially for the best. Central to this expansion of consciousness is for humanity to
become awakened to its unity, not just intellectually but emotionally and volitionally, so that
increasing number of people live daily in the awareness of this unity and connectedness of all
humanity. Be as one body in one soul, counsels Bahá‟u‟lláh. Also integral to this awakening is to
usher in the ever-expanding consciousness of the continuity of human identity and existence, from birth
to maturity, and from this world to the spiritual worlds that lie outside of our sensory perception but
within the intuition of our hearts and the rational recognition of our minds. This purpose of
scholarship calls for adoption of those means that will best effect this awakening and for leaving aside
the methods which are not conducive to this end, and which may have resulted in the heedlessness of

humanity in the past and present. „Abdu‟l-Bahá says, for instance, that many moderns have rejected
religion because religion rejects science. Bahá‟í scholars must not reject science, and must find ways of
bringing the sciences into their work of awakening consciousness.

> knowledge of the Ancient of Days… (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Kitáb-i-ĺqán, p. 192) {4}

> Likewise, ask thou of God that the magnet of His love should draw unto thee the
> knowledge of Him. Once a soul becometh holy in all things, purified, sanctified, the
> gates of the knowledge of God will open wide before his eyes. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, SWAB,
> pp. 190-191) {8}

> If, then, the pursuit of knowledge lead to the beauty of Him Who is the Object of all
> Knowledge, how excellent that goal; but if not, a mere drop will perhaps shut a man
> off from flooding grace, for with learning cometh arrogance and pride, and it
> bringeth on error and indifference to God. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, SWAB, p. 110) {10}

Attaining to the knowledge of God is one of the purposes of human life. As the Short Obligatory
Prayer of Bahá‟u‟lláh states: "Thou hast created me to know Thee and to worship Thee." Knowledge
and recognition of the Manifestation is, for the human being, the summit of knowledge and recognition
of God: "The door of the knowledge of the Ancient Being hath ever been, and will continue for ever
to be, closed in the face of men. No man‟s understanding shall ever gain access unto His holy court.
As a token of His mercy, however, and as a proof of His loving-kindness, He hath manifested unto
men the Day Stars of His divine guidance, the Symbols of His divine unity, and hath ordained the
knowledge of these sanctified Beings to be identical with the knowledge of His own Self. Whoso
recognizeth them hath recognized God. Whoso hearkeneth to their call, hath hearkened to the Voice
of God, and whoso testifieth to the truth of their Revelation, hath testified to the truth of God
Himself. Whoso turneth away from them, hath turned away from God, and whoso disbelieveth in
them, hath disbelieved in God. Every one of them is the Way of God that connecteth this world with
the realms above, and the Standard of His Truth unto every one in the kingdoms of earth and
heaven." (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá‟u‟lláh, pp. 49-50) Hence, one of the
purposes of Bahá‟í scholarship is to know the Manifestations of God, not just Bahá‟u‟lláh but all of

the Manifestations Who have preceded Him of which there is an historical record. It might be
observed that while many of the purposes of scholarship articulated here are pragmatic, while this
purpose does not appear to be pragmatic, to lead to the improvement of human life in any discernable
way. However, I would answer, that one of the very purposes of human life is to know God, and to
fulfill a purpose for which we have been created is useful to us in ways that far transcend mere
pragmatic values, inasmuch as they resonate with the core of our existence. We are not just of value
because of what we do, but also because of who we are. We are creations of God and one of the
purposes of our creation is that we recognize and know that to be true, and to be aware of that
relationship at all times, "I bear witness, at this moment" we say in the Short Obligatory Prayer.
Every moment is potentially filled with this consciousness, just such chosen sacred moments when we
choose to honor our relationship to God. As Bahá‟u‟lláh writes, every atom has been created for our
education, and the names and attributes of God are reflected in every atom…our recognition of them
is integral to our being authentic, because recognition of God is requisite for recognition of our true
nature, our authentic identity. This theme is more fully explored in an essay appended to this study.

This may be the summary of all purposes for scholarship, for the investigation of reality, the discovery
of truth is the constant aim of the rational soul, the distinguishing characteristic of the human being.
Scholarship, through the sciences, through material philosophy, through the arts and crafts, is occupied
with discovering the truth of the empirically perceived world. Scholarship, through religion, through
divine philosophy, through meditation and prayer, is occupied with discovering the truth of the
spiritual worlds. These two are wings of one bird of existence, facets of one integrated whole,
inasmuch as both realms are real, both are essential for the during of this life. The scholar must be
uncompromising the search for truth, and ever ready to recognize and integrate new dimensions to this
search, which cannot be confined by the received strictures of any cultural dynamic. Whether these be
institutionalized in the mystical brotherhoods of Islam or Christianity, or in the scientific faculties of
Harvard or Oxford, or in the corporate offices of New York or Tokyo, they must give way to new
discoveries in this age of light.

his eyes. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, SWAB, pp. 190-191) {8}

The youthful and eager workers for the Cause ... occupy a warm place in my heart. I
will remember their hopes, their plans, their activities in my hours of prayer at the
Holy Shrine. I urge them to study profoundly the revealed utterances of Bahá'u'lláh
and the discourses of 'Abdu'l-Bahá and not to rely unduly on the representation and
interpretation of the Teachings given by Bahá'í speakers and teachers. May the
Almighty sustain you and guide you in your work. (In the handwriting of Shoghi
Effendi, appended to a letter dated 20 March 1929 written on his behalf to an
individual believer) {15}

He does not ask us to follow Him blindly; as He says in one of His Tablets, God has
endowed man with a mind to operate as a torchlight and guide him to the truth.
Read His words, consider His Teachings and measure their value in the light of
contemporary problems and the truth will surely be revealed to you. Read books such
as the Íqán, Some Answered Questions, Nabil's Narrative, and you will appreciate
the truth of His Mission, as well as the true spirit He creates in whosoever follows
His ways. (From letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer,
February 26, 1933: Bahá'í News, No. 80, p. 5 January 1934) {19}

The Cause needs more Bahá'í scholars, people who not only are devoted to it and
believe in it and are anxious to tell others about it, but also who have a deep grasp of
the Teachings and their significance, and who can correlate its beliefs with the
current thoughts and problems of the people of the world. The Cause has the remedy
for all the world's ills. The reason why more people don't accept it is because the
Bahá'ís are not always capable of presenting it to them in a way that meets the
immediate needs of their minds. Young Bahá'ís like yourself must prepare
themselves to really bring the Message to their generation, who need it so
desperately and who can understand the language it speaks so well. He would advise
you among other books to study the Talks of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, as His method of
approaching the mind of the public cannot be surpassed... He also advises you to
develop yourself as a public speaker so you will be increasingly able to teach the
Cause....(From a letter dated 21 October 1943, written on behalf of the Guardian to an
individual believer. Published in Canadian Bahá'í News, March 1967, p. 7) {21}

Likewise he is constantly urging them to really study the Bahá'í teachings more
deeply. One might liken Bahá'u'lláh's teachings to a sphere; there are points poles
apart, and in between the thoughts and doctrines that unite them. We believe in
balance in all things; we believe in moderation in all things -- we must not be too
emotional, nor cut and dried and lacking in feeling, we must not be so liberal as to
cease to preserve the character and unity of our Bahá'í system, nor fanatical and
dogmatic. Very few people, as you as a psychologist know, have attained perfect
equilibrium in their minds or their lives -- their acts -- the same is certainly true of
the Bahá'ís, for anyone who believes in our teachings can become a Bahá'í and they
represent all elements of the population. (From a letter dated 5 July 1947 written on
behalf of the Guardian to an individual believer) {24}

We should concentrate on the Cause, because it is what is needed to cure the world.
This is a sound attitude, for if we don't devote ourselves to the Bahá'í work and
teaching, who will? (From a letter dated 5 July 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi
Effendi to an individual believer) {25}

The Bahá'ís should seek to be well informed on the Teachings, but not waste too
much time trying to understand everything, especially as some of the material we
have is not well translated, and meanings are occasionally ambiguous. The main
point is to understand the Faith, and be able to convey it to others, and not waste too
much time on details. (From a letter dated 31 January 1955 written on behalf of the
Guardian to an individual believer) {28}

If you read the utterances of Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu'l-Bahá with selflessness and care
and concentrate upon them, you will discover truths unknown to you before and will
obtain an insight into the problems that have baffled the great thinkers of the
world.(From a letter dated 30 January 1925 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an
individual believer) <1>

I urge them to study profoundly the revealed utterances of Bahá'u'lláh and the
discourses of 'Abdu'l-Bahá and not to rely unduly on the representation and
interpretation of the Teachings given by Bahá'í speakers and teachers. May the
Almighty sustain you and guide you in your work. (In the handwriting of Shoghi
Effendi, appended to a letter dated 20 March 1929 written on his behalf to an
individual believer) <2>

There is no limit to the study of the Cause. The more we read the writings the more
truths we can find in them and the more we will see that our previous notions were
erroneous. (From a letter dated 25 August 1926 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi
to an individual believer) <4>

This objective of Bahá‟í scholarship should be obvious to everyone and require no commentary.
However, we might enquire as to what it means to "become informed of the teachings of Bahá‟u‟lláh".
Is it sufficient to read a few introductory books, to understand Bahá‟u‟lláh through the eyes of His

followers? Not likely. Is it sufficient to read only selections from the Writings of Bahá‟u‟lláh,
ignoring many of His works that are accessible in a language one can read? Not likely. Is it
sufficient to become apprized of the teachings of Bahá‟u‟lláh through His Writings alone and without
consulting the interpretations of those teachings by „Abdu‟l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi? Or to read
the Master but not the Guardian? Or the Guardian and not the Master? Or either of them and
not Bahá‟u‟lláh? Not likely at all. The Guardian pointed out that the Bahá‟í teachings are like a
sphere, and one must become apprized of the whole sphere in order to comprehend the connection
between points on at sphere. With a consciousness of the whole, we can understand the part. This
calls for a systematic and balanced study of the Bahá‟í Revelation, inasmuch as the literature is vast,
the linguistic challenges are many, and the opportunities for misjudgment legion.

This is a specific objective of Bahá‟í scholarship whose importance cannot be discounted even to the
slightest degree. This is not without conditions however. The Universal House of Justice has pointed
out many academic scholars and Muslim and Christian apologists have mischaracterized the Báb and
Bahá‟u‟lláh as Muslim reformers, philosophers or mystics. This failure to represent their prophetic
claims has resulted in the erroneous assumption on the part of many of the learned of our time that the
Bábi and Bahá‟í religions are schismatic and heretical movements within Islam, and that the ideas
found in these religions are derivative of Islamic models which can be readily traced within the course
of Islamic history and often discovered among the associates of the Báb and Bahá‟u‟lláh. This
perhaps inevitable mischaracterization is to be assiduously avoided by Bahá‟ís and countered with a
forthright representation of the prophetic missions of the Founders.
Hence, while a sound understanding of Islam is indispensable to a sophisticated understanding of the
Faith, the Faith cannot be reduced to an update and a restatement of Islamic teachings. On the
contrary, we should strive to see Islam, not through the eyes of academic historians or Muslim
commentators but through the eyes of the Báb and Bahá‟u‟lláh.

3\. to become informed of the contents of the sacred Scriptures of other Faiths
{6}, (57), (62), (68)

> Study the Holy Words, read your Bible, read the Holy Books, especially study the
> Holy Utterances of Bahá‟u‟lláh… („Abdu‟l-Bahá in SW, vol. 19, No. 3, p. 69) (68)

This requirement of Bahá‟í scholars is reiterated in countless passages in the Bahá‟í source texts. In
some cases the emphasis is put on the Scriptures of Islam or Judaism and Christianity, but overall the
imperative is that Bahá‟í scholars become familiar with the contents of the Scriptures of Hinduism,
Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam and the Bábi and Bahá‟í Faiths.
This is a daunting task, inasmuch as each of these religions has an immense sacred literature, and
scholars are actively engaged in editing and translating and analyzing each of these text anthologies.
There are certainly short-cuts which can be taken, if we can rely on the specialists in each religious
tradition to compile what they conceive of as the most important texts for a clear understanding of that
religion. However, the bias of the specialist has to be considered, and Bahá‟í scholars must be awake

to the tendency of many contemporary specialists to emphasize the distinctions between religious
traditions which appear to make them incompatible with one another rather than the common ground
amongst them which would make them intelligibly compatible. A systematic interpretation of all
authentic Scriptures in light of the principle of progressive revelation will enable the Bahá‟í scholar to
contribute to interfaith understanding while accurately and authentically articulating a Bahá‟í
perspective on the teachings contained in those Scriptures and the relative authority of those texts.
There is, in effect, a sort of Bahá‟í exegetical method which is historical and critical but not in the
materialistic and humanistic fashion developed in Western Europe since the 18 th century. It depicts
the revelation of religious truth and also of textual accuracy as steadily increasing over the course of
time, so that the depiction of that truth is more complete and more authentic in the Gospels than in
the Tanakh, in the Qur‟án than in the Gospels, in the Writings of the Báb and Bahá‟u‟lláh than in
the Qur‟án. Hence, it is imperative, if we are to apply this historical-critical method, to examine the
former in the light of the latter.

History is perhaps the most controversial of all fields of study, inasmuch as no history is written
without a bias, without an axe to grind, without predispositions and presuppositions, and it is often
impossible or at least very difficult to distinguish between the commentary of the historian and the facts
he has compiled, for the simple reason that he collects the facts that support his view of history, he cites
the facts that he considers historical, and the facts which might undermine or contradict his thesis are
conveniently left out of the picture. It has been observed that history is often more fictive than fiction
itself. In any case, being informed about history, including religious history is one of the specific
objectives of the Bahá‟í scholar, and in order not to become a convert to the worldview of the histories
he studies, he must understand how to read history. In His own historical works, in A Traveler's
Narrative and Memorials to the Faithful, as well as in His references to history in The Secret of
Divine Civilization and in various of His talks and Tablets, „Abdu‟l-Bahá demonstrates that
history from a Bahá‟í perspective is not composed primarily of events within an empirical time, space
and cultural frame. Rather, history is the unfoldment of the divine plan for the education and
development of humankind, not in its potentiality, which is revealed in the Scriptures, but rather in its
actuality, in its human actuality in the temporal world. This paradigm is further developed in God
Passes By and The Promised Day is Come of Shoghi Effendi. Hence, the Bahá‟í scholar who seeks
to become informed about history, including religious history, must translate all he absorbs from
whatever source he consults into the framework revealed in the Writings. Otherwise, he is likely to
become unwittingly seduced by a humanist, Marxist, capitalist, liberal, conservative, Christian,
Muslim or some other particular and biased viewpoint, which will result not in him becoming
informed about history, but rather becoming informed about one interpretation of what has happened.
If he pays attention he can learn to distinguish fact from fiction, but in order to do so, he must grasp
the point of view of the historian. Reading history is always an act of translation, from the mind and
viewpoint of the historian to the mind and viewpoint of the reader. In this case, the Bahá‟í will be
wise to remain grounded at all times in the teachings of his Faith.

Shoghi Effendi encouraged Bahá‟í scholars to become familiar with economics and sociology, and, as
indicated on this list of specific objectives, the Guardian also approved of the study of psychology and
political science. In general, the Guardian advised the believers "to make detailed inquiry into the
various branches of contemporary learning -- arts and sciences alike" (Shoghi Effendi, letter dated 30
January 1926 to the Spiritual Assemblies in Iran, translated from the Persian; in the 1995
Compilation on Scholarship, p, 7, [20])

6\. to become informed of the laws, principles, customs, conditions and
manners, material and moral virtues characterizing the statecraft of nations {6}

> He should in addition be informed as to the laws and principles, the customs,

> Civilization, pp. 35-36) {6}

This is, properly speaking, political history and political science, and follows the same principles as the
social science content discussed above. One of the purposes of studying this statecraft of nations is to be
able to compare these various "laws, principles, customs, conditions and manners, material and moral
virtues" with the Bahá‟í teachings, and to be facilitated in our unflagging efforts to attract the minds
of the leaders of nations to the principles of the New World Order of Bahá‟u‟lláh.

7\. to become informed about psychology [38]

> Psychology is still a very young and inexact science, and as the years go by Bahá'í
> psychologists, who know from the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh the true pattern of
> human life, will be able to make great strides in the development of this science, and
> will help profoundly in the alleviation of human suffering. (Letter dated 6 February
> 1973, published in Messages from the Universal House of Justice, 1968-1973

(Wilmette: Bahá'í Publishing Trust, 1976), pp. 111-112) [38]

The Universal House of Justice wrote about another of the social sciences: "Psychology is still a very
young and inexact science, and as the years go by Bahá'í psychologists, who know from the teachings
of Bahá'u'lláh the true pattern of human life, will be able to make great strides in the development of
this science, and will help profoundly in the alleviation of human suffering." (Letter dated 6
February 1973, published in Messages from the Universal House of Justice, 1968-1973 (Wilmette:
Bahá'í Publishing Trust, 1976), pp. 111-112; in 1995 Scholarship Compilation, [38]) In general
this is the manner in which we are encouraged to approach the social sciences, recognizing that they
may have usefulness in their current configuration, but also recognizing that there are many truths
enshrined in the Bahá‟í Writings which will ultimately transform these social sciences by expanding
the awareness of human nature in its individual and collective, spiritual and material dimensions and
manifestations.

8\. to become informed about all the progressive movements of the
day [50], {24}, <9>

> Shoghi Effendi has for years urged the Bahá'ís (who asked His advice, and in
> general also) to study history, economics, sociology, etc., in order to be au courant
> with all the progressive movements and thoughts being put forth today, and so that

> study the Bahá'í teachings more deeply. One might liken Bahá'u'lláh's teachings to
> a sphere; there are points poles apart, and in between the thoughts and doctrines that
> unite them.... (5 July 1947 to an individual believer) [50], {24}, <9>

In various talks and writings, the Bahá‟ís have been encouraged at least from the ministry of the
Master to collaborate with and support the progressive movements of the day, those with which our
world-embracing values are in harmony. The Bahá‟í vision of what is progressive and modern is

decidedly distinct from that of many self-described progressives and modernists. In one of His talks,
„Abdu‟l-Bahá wrote: " At such a time as this Bahá'u'lláh appeared among them like a luminary in
the heavens. He flooded the East with light. He proclaimed new principles and teachings. He laid a
basis for new institutions which are the very spirit of modernism, the light of the world, the
development of the body politic and eternal honor." („Abdu'l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal
Peace, p. 402) In another talk He said: " This reformation and renewal of the fundamental reality
of religion constitute the true and outworking spirit of modernism, the unmistakable light of the
world, the manifest effulgence of the Word of God, the divine remedy for all human ailment and the
bounty of eternal life to all mankind." („Abdu‟l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p.
439) Shoghi Effendi contrasted this authentic "spirit of modernism" with " the prevailing spirit of
modernism, with its emphasis on a purely materialistic philosophy, which, as it diffuses itself, tends
increasingly to divorce religion from man's daily life." (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of
Bahá‟u‟lláh, p. 183) „Abdu‟l-Bahá gave a list of "teachings, which embody the divine spirit of the
age and are applicable to this period of maturity in the life of the human world" which included the
"oneness of the world of humanity…protection and guidance of the Holy Spirit…foundation of all
religion is one…Religion must be the cause of unity…Religion must accord with science and
reason…Independent investigation of truth…Equality between men and women…abandoning of all
prejudices among mankind…Universal peace…Universal education…A universal
language…Solution of the economic problem…An international tribunal". („Abdu‟l-Bahá, The
Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 440) Modernism, in its general meaning and apart from the
specific cultural trends that are widely described by this term, has been associated with a great variety
of phenomena including, alphabetically, alienation, bureaucracy, decontextualization, centralization,
chaos, commodification, consumerism, decontextualism, democratization, disenchantment with the
world, diversification, homogenization, hybridization, individuation and individualism, linear-
progression, mass society, mechanization, objectivism, reductionism, subjectivism, and universalism, is,
as a descriptive term for the ideological malaise of the Western world, which has infected most of the
planet over the course of the 20th century, primarily the result of "a purely materialistic philosophy,
which, as it diffuses itself, tends increasingly to divorce religion from man's daily life." (Shoghi
Effendi, The World Order of Bahá‟u‟lláh, 183) It is obviously not with movements which reflect this
kind of progressivism, namely, the triumph of materialistic philosophy over all religions, that is meant
by these encouraging words, but rather the life-affirming progressive spirit exhibited in the
aforementioned principles, that is, in the social teachings of Bahá‟u‟lláh.

9\. to be informed about the present condition of the world and its problems
[24], {16}, {21}, {25}

> behalf of the Guardian to an individual believer. Published in "Canadian Bahá'í
> News", March 1967, p. 7) {21}

> If the Bahá'ís want to be really effective in teaching the Cause they need to be much
> better informed and able to discuss intelligently, intellectually, the present condition
> of the world and its problems. (From a letter dated 5 July 1949 written on behalf of
> the Guardian to an individual believer) {25}

Bahá‟u‟lláh advises: "The remedy the world needeth in its present-day afflictions can never be the
same as that which a subsequent age may require. Be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye
live in, and center your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements." (Gleanings from the
Writings of Bahá‟u‟lláh, p. 213) In order apply the divine remedy revealed by Bahá‟u‟lláh, we must
become "informed about the present condition of the world and its problems".

10\. to formulate and learn proofs of the Faith [70], {5}, <16>, (28), (29),
(30), (31), (32), (33), (36), (37), (61), (65)

> From your letter the House of Justice understands that you desire to find ways of

> Himself used such a method. The danger Bahá'í scholars must avoid is the
> distortion of religious truth, almost forcibly at times, to make it conform to
> understandings and perceptions current in the scientific world. True Bahá'í scholars

should guard against this. In a letter to a National Spiritual Assembly dated 21 July
1968, the House of Justice wrote:
While it may often be the part of wisdom to approach individuals or an audience
from a standpoint of current knowledge, it should never be overlooked that the
Revelation of the Manifestation of God is the standard for all knowledge, and
scientific statements and theories, no matter how close they may come to the eternal
principles proclaimed by God's Messenger, are in their very nature ephemeral and
limited. Likewise, attempting to make the Bahá'í Faith relevant to modern society is
to incur the grave risk of compromising the fundamental verities of our Faith in an
effort to make it conform to current theories and practices. (7 June 1983 to an
individual believer) [70], <16>

If it were possible that in every city a few of the awakened ones, when opportunity
offered, could hold a meeting and therein habitually present the proofs and
arguments of God, this would do much to expand the consciousness of men;
provided, however, that the discourse be kept to this one theme. (From a translation
of the Tablet of „Abdu‟l-Bahá) {5}

The attainment of the most great guidance is dependent upon knowledge and
wisdom, and on being informed as to the mysteries of the Holy Words. Wherefore
must the loved ones of God, be they young or old, be they men or women, each one
according to his capabilities, strive to acquire the various branches of knowledge,
and to increase his understanding of the mysteries of the Holy Books, and his skill in
marshalling the divine proofs and evidences. (From a Tablet - translated from the
Arabic) (28)

When your hearts are wholly attracted to the one true God you will acquire divine
knowledge, will become attentive to the proofs and testimonies and will commit to
memory the glad-tidings concerning the Manifestation of the Beauty of the All-
Merciful, as mentioned in the heavenly Scriptures. Then ye shall behold how
wondrous are His confirmations and how gracious is His assistance. (From a Tablet
- translated from the Persian) (29)

It is imperative to acquire the knowledge of divine proofs and evidences, and to
acquaint oneself with convincing testimonies which demonstrate the revelation of
God's resplendent Light. The study group thou didst organize hath imparted much
joy and happiness to the heart of 'Abdu'l-Bahá. Thou must exert much effort and
show forth perseverance and constancy that, God willing, through the reviving
breaths of His mercy, souls may be so educated as to become like radiant candles
shining in the assemblage of divine knowledge and understanding. This matter is
highly important. It is binding on every one and must be regarded as an obligation....
(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian) (30)

In truth thou art now rendering a great service to the basic foundations of the Cause
of God, inasmuch as the cornerstone of its structure is the promotion of His Faith,
the awakening of the people, the diffusion of the divine teachings and the education
of mankind; and all this dependeth on instructing the friends in the teaching work. I
beseech God that within a short time thou mayest be able to acquaint the children of

the Abha Paradise with the divine mysteries and truths and to rend asunder the veils
of idle imaginings, that each one of them may become a fluent speaker and be able
to guide many others to the Cause of God. Then will the outpourings of the heavenly
bounties become manifest and the invisible hosts of the Kingdom, armed with
conclusive proofs and evidences, will conquer the realms of the inner realities and
domains of the hearts of men, even as a single seed developing into seven ears of
grain. (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian) (31)

In this day there is nothing more important than the instruction and study of clear
proofs and convincing, heavenly arguments, for therein lie the source of life and the
path of salvation.... (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian) (32)

The method of instruction which ye have established, beginning with proofs of the
existence of God and the oneness of God, the mission of the Prophets and
Messengers and Their teachings, and the wonders of the universe, is highly suitable.
Keep on with this. It is certain that the confirmations of God will attend you. It is
also highly praiseworthy to memorize the Tablets, divine verses and sacred
traditions. Ye will surely exert every effort in teaching, and in furthering
understanding. (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian) (33)

Wherefore, O ye illumined youth, strive by night and by day to unravel the mysteries
of the mind and spirit, and to grasp the secrets of the Day of God. Inform yourselves
of the evidences that the Most Great Name hath dawned.... (From a Tablet -
translated from the Persian) (36)

If it were possible that in every city a few of the awakened ones, when opportunity
offered, could hold a meeting, and therein habitually present the proofs and
arguments of God, this would do much to expand the consciousness of men;
provided, however, that the discourse be kept to this one theme. (From a Tablet -
translated from the Persian) (37)

Day and night you must strive that you may attain to the significances of the
heavenly Kingdom, perceive the signs of Divinity, acquire certainty of knowledge
and realize that this world has a Creator, a Vivifier, a Provider, an Architect --
knowing this through proofs and evidences and not through susceptibilities, nay,
rather, through decisive arguments and real vision -- that is to say, visualizing it as
clearly as the outer eye beholds the sun. In this way may you behold the presence of
God and attain to the knowledge of the holy, divine Manifestations.
You must come into the knowledge of the divine Manifestations and Their teachings
through proofs and evidences. You must unseal the mysteries of the supreme
Kingdom and become capable of discovering the inner realities of things. Then shall
you be the manifestations of the mercy of God and true believers, firm and steadfast
in the Cause of God. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, pp. 227-
228; in Foundations of World Unity, p. 65) (61)

It is very good to memorize the logical points and the proofs of the Holy Books.
Those proofs and evidences which establish the fact that Bahá'u'lláh is the
fulfillment of the Promises of the Holy Books. These proofs ought to be collected

> and memorized. As soon as someone will ask you -- What are your proofs? -- you
> may cry out at the top of your voice and say: 'Here they are!' (Star of the West, Vol 3,
> No. 1, p. 4) (65)

There are a very large number of proofs presented in the authentic Writings of Bahá‟u‟lláh and
„Abdu‟l-Bahá, as well as in the talks of the Master4. These proofs do not appear to be of marginal
significance in the scheme of the Bahá‟í teachings. Indeed, the Bahá‟í teachings assert that true
religion is in harmony with science and reason, that it must be in harmony with science and reason,
and if it isn't in harmony with science and reason, it cannot be true religion at all. Such a religion
would be fanatical, superstitious, and such it does not belong in this new age, of learning and science
and universality. There are proofs for the existence of God, for the unity of God, for the existence of
Prophethood, for the validity of individual Prophets, for the existence of the human soul, for the
eternal life of the human soul, for the nature of the created world, and these are not to be found tucked
away in dusty attics, in rare manuscripts, but rather front and center, accessible to all. But often
invisible, both to believers and to non-believers. In any case, this aspect of Bahá‟í learning is
emphasized in multiple texts, and if we chuck out this teaching then we jettison a large body of the
Bahá‟í teachings which are based upon proofs.
Some of the translated references to proofs are here cited, to demonstrate just how widely this
terminology is used by both Bahá‟u‟lláh and „Abdu‟l-Bahá, and to legitimize it thereby in the eyes of
their present-day adherents, for whom the rational arguments disproving such proofs, including the
philosophical arguments of Karl Popper (1902-1994), may bear considerable weight.

We beseech God to strengthen thee with His power, and enable thee to recognize Him
Who is the Source of all knowledge, that thou mayest detach thyself from all human
learning, for, "what would it profit any man to strive after learning when he hath
already found and recognized Him Who is the Object of all knowledge?" Cleave to the
Root of Knowledge, and to Him Who is the Fountain thereof, that thou mayest find
thyself independent of all who claim to be well versed in human learning, and whose
claim no clear proof, nor the testimony of any enlightening book, can support. (GL:176-

The saying: "Knowledge is one point, which the foolish have multiplied" is a proof of
Our argument, and the tradition: "Knowledge is a light which God sheddeth into the
heart of whomsoever He willeth" a confirmation of Our statement. (KI:183)

They that valiantly labour in quest of God's will, when once they have renounced all
else but Him, will be so attached and wedded to that City [City of Certitude] that a
moment's separation from it would to them be unthinkable. They will hearken unto
infallible proofs from the Hyacinth of that assembly, and receive the surest testimonies
from the beauty of its Rose and the melody of its Nightingale. Once in about a
thousand years shall this City be renewed and re-adorned. (KI:198-199; GL:268)

Behold, how lofty is the station, and how consummate the virtue, of these verses which
He hath declared to be His surest testimony, His infallible proof, the evidence of His
all-subduing power, and a revelation of the potency of His will. He, the divine King,
hath proclaimed the undisputed supremacy of the verses of His Book over all things
that testify to His truth. For compared with all other proofs and tokens, the divinely-
revealed verses shine as the sun, whilst all others are as stars. To the peoples of the
world they are the abiding testimony, the incontrovertible proof, the shining light of the
ideal King. (KI:205)

They cleave to the obscure intricacies of knowledge, when He, Who is the Object of all
knowledge, shineth as the sun. They see the sun with their own eyes, and yet question
that brilliant Orb as to the proof of its light. They behold the vernal showers descending
upon them, and yet seek an evidence of that bounty. The proof of the sun is the light
thereof, which shineth and envelopeth all things. (KI:208-209)

Each one of these verses is unto all the peoples of the world an unfailing testimony and
a glorious proof of His truth. Each of them verily sufficeth all mankind, wert thou to
meditate upon the verses of God. In the above-mentioned verse itself pearls of
mysteries lie hidden. Whatever be the ailment, the remedy it offereth can never fail.
(KI:209-210)

Amongst the proofs demonstrating the truth of this Revelation is this, that in every age
and Dispensation, whenever the invisible Essence was revealed in the person of His
Manifestation, certain souls, obscure and detached from all worldly entanglements,
would seek illumination from the Sun of Prophethood and Moon of divine guidance,
and would attain unto the divine Presence. (KI:221; GL:179)

Their very deeds are a sufficient testimony, and an irrefutable proof unto all the peoples
of the earth, were men to ponder in their hearts the mysteries of divine Revelation.
(KI:226-227; GL:182)

Another proof and evidence of the truth of this Revelation, which amongst all other
proofs shineth as the sun, is the constancy of the eternal Beauty in proclaiming the
Faith of God. (KI:230)

Wert thou to ponder a while, thou wilt recognize that, apart from all these established
truths and above-mentioned evidences, the repudiation, cursing, and execration,
pronounced by the people of the earth, are in themselves the mightiest proof and the
surest testimony of the truth of these heroes of the field of resignation and detachment.
(KI:236-237)

Verily I say, this is the Day in which mankind can behold the Face, and hear the Voice,
of the Promised One. The Call of God hath been raised, and the light of His
countenance hath been lifted up upon men. It behoveth every man to blot out the trace
of every idle word from the tablet of his heart, and to gaze, with an open and unbiased
mind, on the signs of His Revelation, the proofs of His Mission, and the tokens of His
glory. (GL:10-11)

I have manifested Myself among men, and have sent down Him Who is the Day Spring
of the signs of My Revelation...He Who is everlastingly hidden from the eyes of men
can never be known except through His Manifestation, and His Manifestation can
adduce no greater proof of the truth of His Mission than the proof of His own Person.
(GL:49)

My Pen groaneth, and all created things weep with a great weeping, as a result of the
woes He suffered at the hands of them that have broken the Covenant of God, violated
His Testament, rejected His proofs, and disputed His signs. Thus recount We unto
thee the tale of that which happened in days past, haply thou mayest comprehend.
(GL:57)

Consider this wronged One. Though the clearest proofs attest the truth of His Cause;
though the prophecies He, in an unmistakable language, hath made have been fulfilled;
though, in spite of His not being accounted among the learned, His being unschooled
and inexperienced in the disputations current among the divines, He hath rained upon
men the showers of His manifold and Divinely-inspired knowledge; yet, behold how
this generation hath rejected His authority, and rebelled against Him! (GL:58)
Say: The first and foremost testimony establishing His truth is His own Self. Next to
this testimony is His Revelation. For whoso faileth to recognize either the one or the
other He hath established the words He hath revealed as proof of His reality and truth.
(GL:105)

He accused Us, in his letter to thee, and thou didst believe him and followed in his way,
without seeking any proof or trustworthy evidence from him. Thou didst ask for no
explanation, nor didst thou attempt either to investigate or ascertain the matter, that the
truth might be distinguished from falsehood in thy sight, and that thou mightest be

clear in thy discernment. Find out for thyself the sort of man he was by asking those
Ministers who were, at that time, in Iraq, as well as the Governor of the City (Baghdad)
and its high Counsellor, that the truth may be revealed to thee, and that thou mayest be
of the well-informed. (GL:229-230)

Say: The verses We have revealed are as numerous as those which, in the preceding
Revelation, were sent down upon the Báb. Let him that doubteth the words which the
Spirit of God hath spoken seek the court of Our presence and hear Our divinely-
revealed verses, and be an eye-witness of the clear proof of Our claim. (GL:259)

Let thine ear be attentive, O Nabil-i-A'zam, to the Voice of the Ancient of Days, crying
to thee from the Kingdom of His all-glorious Name. He it is Who is now proclaiming
from the realms above, and within the inmost essence of all created things: "I truly am
God, there is none other God but Me. I am He Who, from everlasting, hath been the
Source of all sovereignty and power, He Who shall continue, throughout eternity, to
exercise His kingship and to extend His protection unto all created things. My proof is
the greatness of My might and My sovereignty that embraceth the whole of creation."...
(GL:302)

Although His signs have encompassed the world and His proofs and testimonies are
shining forth and manifest as the light, yet the ignorant appear heedless, nay rather,
rebellious. (TB:33)

I beg of Thee, by that Word through which Thy proof was perfected among Thy
creatures and Thy testimony was fulfilled among Thy servants to strengthen Thy
people in that whereby the face of the Cause will radiate in Thy dominion, the
standards of Thy power will be planted among Thy servants, and the banners of Thy
guidance will be raised throughout Thy dominions. (TB:34)

Truly this Wronged One desireth not to demonstrate His Own Cause with proofs
produced by others...One wondereth by what proof or reason the disbelievers among
the people of the Bayan have turned away from the Lord of being. (TB:74)
They have rejected the bounty of God and His proofs and have repudiated the
testimony of God and His signs. (TB:107)

Verily, the Inevitable is come, and He, the True One, hath appeared with proof and
testimony. (TB:117)

They have denied the testimony of God and His proof, after he came from the heaven
of power with the kingdom of His signs. (TB:120)

Say, O concourse of divines! Be fair in your judgement, I adjure you by God. Produce
then whatever proofs and testimonies ye possess, if ye are to be reckoned among the
inmates of this glorious habitation. Set your hearts towards the Dayspring of divine
Revelation that We may disclose before your eyes the equivalent of all such verses,
proofs, testimonies, affirmations and evidences as ye and other kindreds of the earth
possess. (TB:245)

There are no clearer proofs than this in the Holy Books for any Manifestation. For him
who is just, the agreement of the times indicated by the tongues of the Great Ones is
the most conclusive proof. There is no other possible explanation of these prophecies.
Blessed are the just souls who seek the truth. (SAQ:XÍI:82)

These are conclusive and evident facts. But the arguments which these European
philosophers have used raise doubtful proofs and are not conclusive. (SAQ:XLVI:208)

This is a spiritual proof, but one which we cannot at the beginning put forth for the
benefit of the materialists; first we must speak of the logical proofs, afterwards the
spiritual proofs. (SAQ:L:229)

Therefore as long as signs of existence appear, they are a proof that the possessor of the
sign is existent. (SAQ:LX:261-262; BWF:325)

This is a rational proof which we are giving, so that the wise may weigh it in the
balance of reason and justice. But if the human spirit will rejoice and be attracted to
the Kingdom of God, if the inner sight becomes opened, and the spiritual hearing
strengthened, and the spiritual feelings predominant, he will see the immortality of the
spirit as clearly as he sees the sun, and the glad tidings and signs of God will
encompass him. (SAQ:LX:262)

When the prophets of God appear on this earth, their validity is established by means of
certain proofs. (ABDP:43)

Praise be to God! You have heard the call of the Kingdom. Your eyes are opened; you
have turned to God. Your purpose is the good pleasure of God, the understanding of
the mysteries of the heart and investigation of the realities. Day and night you must
strive that you may attain to the significances of the heavenly Kingdom, perceive the
signs of Divinity, acquire certainty of knowledge and realize that this world has a
Creator, a Vivifier, a Provider, an Architect--knowing this through proofs and evidences
and not through susceptibilities, nay, rather, through decisive arguments and real
vision--that is to say, visualizing it as clearly as the outer eye beholds the sun. In this
way you may behold the presence of God and attain to the knowledge of the holy,
divine Manifestations.
You must come into the knowledge of the divine Manifestations and Their teachings
through proofs and evidences. You must understand unseal the divine mysteries of the
supreme Kingdom and become capable of discovering the inner realities of things.
Then shall you be the manifestations of the mercy of God and true believers, firm and
steadfast in the Cause of God. (PUP:227-228)

The intellectual proofs of Divinity are based upon observation and evidence which
constitute decisive argument, logically proving the reality of Divinity, the effulgence of
mercy, the certainty of inspiration and the immortality of the spirit. (PUP:326)

In this day there is nothing more important than the instruction and study of clear
proofs and convincing, heavenly arguments, for therein lie the source of life and the
path of salvation. (The Importance of Deepening our Knowledge and Understanding

of the Faith, p. 9; quoted in Hugh Motlagh, Teaching: The Crown of Immortal Glory,
If thou wishest the divine knowledge and recognition, purify thy heart from all beside
God, be wholly attracted to the ideal, beloved One; search for and choose Him and
apply thyself to rational and authoritative arguments. For arguments are a guide to the
path and by this the heart will be turned unto the Sun of Truth. And when the heart is
turned unto the Sun, then the eye will be opened and will recognize the Sun through the
Sun itself. Then man will be in no need of arguments (or proofs), for the Sun is
altogether independent, and absolute independence is in need of nothing, and proofs
are one of the things of which absolute independence has no       need. (BWF:384)

Told of the study of the Ighan in the Wednesday night meetings in Washington, his
[„Abdu‟l-Bahá's] comment was, 'Very good! Very good! It is very good to memorize
the logical points and the proofs of the Holy Books. Those proofs and evidences which
establish the fact that Bahá‟u‟lláh is the fulfillment of the Promises of the Holy Books.
These proofs ought to be collected and memorized. As soon as someone will ask you--
What are your proofs?--you may cry out at the top of your voice and say: "Here they
are!"' (SW:II:11, p. 4: from conversation in Dublin, New Hampshire, 31 July 1912)

O ye illumined youth, strive by night and by day to unravel the mysteries of the mind
and spirit, and grasp the secrets of the Day of God. Inform yourselves of the evidences
that the Most Great Name hath dawned. Open your lips in praise. Adduce convincing
arguments and proofs. Lead those who thirst to the fountain of life. (Letter from the
International Teaching Centre, 12/5/1988; quoted: Hugh Motlagh, Teaching: The
Crown of Immortal Glory, p.200)

The attracted leaves should not, when associating with each other, talk merely about
the temperature of the weather, the coldness of the water, the beauty of the flowers and
gardens, the freshness of the grass and the flowing water. They should rather restrict
their discussions to glorification and praise and the uttering of proofs and reasons, to
quoting verses and traditions and putting forth clear testimonies, so that all the homes
of the loved ones will be converted into gathering places for lessons on teaching the
Cause. (The Compilation of Compilations, vol. Í, p. 396, quoted in Hugh Motlagh,
Teaching: The Crown of Immortal Glory, p. 201)

Those who would have men believe that religion is their own private property once
more bring their efforts to bear against the Sun of Truth: they resist the Command of
God; they invent calumnies, not having arguments against it, neither proofs. They
attack with masked faces, not daring to come forth into the light of day.
Our methods are different, we do not attack, neither calumniate; we do not wish to
dispute with them; we bring forth proofs and arguments; we invite them to confute our
statements. They cannot answer us, but instead, they write all they can think of against
the Divine Messenger, Bahá‟u‟lláh. (PT:103)

When I was in America I used to go to churches to speak. When I entered they were
engaged in worshiping. I also used to stand up and turn to the Kingdom of God. After
they had finished their prayer I used to give the Divine Glad Tidings. I used to give the

proofs and evidences of God. I gave the teachings of the Blessed Beauty. All listened.
There was no opposition. (Star of the West, XI:16, p. 268-269)

As to the proofs and arguments of the Beauty of Abha, these are manifest like the sun.
If thou wishest a discerning eye and seekest for a hearing ear, set thou aside that which
thou hast heard from fathers and ancestors, for such things are imitation--and then seek
for the truth with the utmost attention until the divine confirmation may reach thee and
the matter may be properly disclosed unto thee. (BWF:387)

Every subject presented to a thoughtful audience must be supported by rational proofs
and logical arguments. Proofs are of four kinds: first, through sense perception;
second, through the reasoning faculty; third, from traditional or scriptural authority;
fourth, through the medium of inspiration. That is to say, there are four criteria or
standards of judgment by which the human mind reaches its conclusions. We will first
consider the criterion of the senses. This is a standard still held to by the materialistic
philosophers of the world. They believe that whatever is perceptible to the senses is a
verity, a certainty and without doubt existent. For example, they say, 'Here is a lamp
which you see, and because it is perceptible to the sense of sight, you cannot doubt its
existence. There is a tree; your sense of vision assures you of its reality, which is
beyond question. This is a man; you see that he is a man; therefore, he exists." In a
word, everything confirmed by the senses is assumed to be as undoubted and
unquestioned as the product of five multiplied by five; it cannot be twenty-six nor less
than twenty-five. Consequently, the materialistic philosophers consider the criterion of
the senses to be first and foremost.
But in the estimation of the divine philosophers this proof and assurance is not reliable;
nay, rather, they deem the standard of the senses to be false because it is imperfect.
Sight, for instance, is one of the most important of the senses, yet it is subject to many
abberations and inaccuracies. The eye sees the mirage as a body of water; it regards
images in the mirror as realities when they are but reflections. A man sailing upon the
river imagines that objects upon the shore are moving, whereas he is in motion, and
they are stationary. To the eye the earth appears fixed, while the sun and stars revolve
about it. As a matter of fact, the heavenly orbs are stationary, and the earth is turning
upon its axis. The colossal suns, planets and constellations which shine in the heavens
appear small, nay, infinitesimal to human vision, whereas in reality they are vastly
greater than the earth in dimension and volume. A whirling spark appears to the sight
as a circle of fire. There are numberless instances of this kind which show the error and
inaccuracy of the senses. Therefore, the divine philosophers have considered this
standard of judgment to be defective and unreliable.
The second criterion is that of the intellect. The ancient philosophers in particular
considered the intellect to be the most important agency of judgment. Among the wise
men of Greece, Rome, Persia and Egypt the criterion of true proof was reason. They
held that every matter submitted to the reasoning faculty could be proved true or false
and must be accepted or rejected accordingly. But in the estimation of the people of
insight this criterion is likewise defective and unreliable, for these same philosophers
who held to reason or intellect as the standard of human judgment have differed widely
among themselves upon every subject of investigation. The statements of the Greek
philosophers are contradictory to the conclusions of the Persian sages. Even among
the Greek philosophers themselves there is continual variance and lack of agreement

> upon any given subject. Great difference of thought also prevailed between the wise
> men of Greece and Rome. Therefore, if the criterion of reason or intellect constituted a
> correct and infallible standard of judgment, those who tested and applied it should have
> arrived at the same conclusions. As they differ and are contradictory in conclusions, it
> is an evidence that the method and standard of test must have been faulty and

> intellect finds itself incapable of explaining certain questions, or if the possessors of
> intellect contradict each other in the interpretation of traditions, how can such a
> criterion be relied upon for accurate conclusions?
> The fourth standard is that of inspiration. In past centuries many philosophers have

> four standards of judgment and thereby reaching our conclusions... (PUP:253-255)

The Guardian also referred to the proofs of Bahá‟u‟lláh, often citing Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s Tablets:

> To this same Sultan He, moreover, as attested by the Suriy-i-Ra'is, transmitted, while
> in Gallipoli, a verbal message through a Turkish officer named Umar, requesting the
> sovereign to grant Him a ten minute interview, "so that he may demand whatsoever
> he would deem to be a sufficient testimony and would regard as proof of the veracity
> of Him Who is the Truth," adding that "should God enable Him to produce it, let
> him, then, release these wronged ones and leave them to themselves." (GPB:172)

> He, moreover, in that same Tablet, demonstrated the validity of His Mission;
> expressed the wish to be "brought face to face with the divines of the age, and
> produce proofs and testimonies in the presence of His Majesty," which would
> establish the truth of His Cause; exposed the perversity of the ecclesiastical leaders

> in His own days, as well as in the days of Jesus Christ and of Muhammad;
> prophesied that His sufferings will be followed by the "outpourings of a supreme
> mercy" and by an "overflowing prosperity"; drew a parallel between the afflictions
> that had befallen His kindred and those endured by the relatives of the Prophet
> Muhammad; expatiated on the instability of human affairs; depicted the city to
> which He was about to be banished; foreshadowed the future abasement of the
> ulamas; and concluded with yet another expression of hope that the sovereign might
> be assisted by God to "aid His Faith and turn towards His justice." (GPB:173-174)

> Finally, mention must be made of His Epistle to Shaykh Muhammad-Taqi,
> surnamed "Ibn-i-Dhi'b" (Son of the Wolf), the last outstanding Tablet revealed by
> the pen of Bahá'u'lláh, in which He calls upon that rapacious priest to repent of his
> acts, quotes some of the most characteristic and celebrated passages of His own
> writings, and adduces proofs establishing the validity of His Cause. (GPB:219)

These proofs and evidences are not an end in themselves…they serve a purpose, which is to attract the
heart and mind, and thereby the soul to a receptivity to the Truth. Once the inner faculties are
awakened and one perceives Truth for oneself, proofs are no longer necessary:

> It is incumbent upon thee, by the permission of God, to cleanse the eye of thine heart
> from the things of the world, that thou mayest realize the infinitude of divine
> knowledge, and mayest behold Truth so clearly that thou wilt need no proof to
> demonstrate His reality, nor any evidence to bear witness unto His testimony. (KI:90)

> These obvious arguments are adduced for weak souls; but if the inner perception be
> open, a hundred thousand clear proofs become visible. (SAQ:Í:7)

> This is a rational proof which we are giving, so that the wise may weigh it in the
> balance of reason and justice. But if the human spirit will rejoice and be attracted to
> the Kingdom of God, if the inner sight becomes opened, and the spiritual healing
> strengthened, and the spiritual feelings predominant, he will see the immortality of the
> spirit as clearly as he sees the sun, and the glad tidings and signs of God will
> encompass him. (SAQ:LX:262; BWF:325-326)

The Guardian imbued the rank and file believers, particularly those who worked alongside him with the
spirit of faith that transcends proof, for how otherwise can we understand what his secretaries wrote on his
behalf to Bahá‟ís in Germany and the British Isles:

> Mere intellectual understanding of the teachings is not enough. Deep spirituality is
> essential. (Letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, dated 31 March 1949, in The
> Light of Divine Guidance, v. I, p. 81)

> An intellectual grasp of the teachings is purely superficial; with the first real test such
> believers are shaken from the bough! (Letter on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, dated 11

April 1949, in The Light of Divine Guidance, v. I, p. 81)

> There is very little Divine love in the world to-day, but a great deal of intellectual

\[16\] Note from the compilation: Cf. "Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas", p. 26

of sciences as employed by the Manifestation. Bahá'u'lláh's comment about sciences
which begin and end in mere words does not apply to the systematic
study of natural phenomena in order to discover the laws of order in the physical
universe, an order which mathematics seeks to explore. Pure mathematics frequently
has application in practical matters, such as, for example, group theory or the study
of fundamental particles.
As for classical studies, we are to share with you the following excerpt from a letter
dated 30 November 1932 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual who
had asked a question about the skills of story writing and whether such occupation
would be classed as those sciences that begin and end in words". What Bahá'u'lláh
meant primarily with "sciences that begin and end in words" are those theological
treatises and commentaries that encumber the human mind rather than help it to
attain the truth. The students would devote their life to their study but still attain no
where. Bahá'u'lláh surely never meant to include story-writing under such a
category; and shorthand and typewriting are both most useful talents, very necessary
in our present social and economic life. (24 May 1988 to an individual believer) [55]

The first attribute of perfection is learning and the cultural attainments of the mind,
and this eminent station is achieved when the individual combines in himself a
thorough knowledge of those complex and transcendental realities pertaining to
God, of the fundamental truths of Qur'ánic political and religious law, of the
contents of the sacred Scriptures of other faiths, and of those regulations and
procedures which would contribute to the progress and civilization of this
distinguished country. He should in addition be informed as to the laws and
principles, the customs, conditions and manners, and the material and moral virtues
characterizing the statecraft of other nations, and should be well versed in all the
useful branches of learning of the day… („Abdu‟l-Bahá, The Secret of Divine
Civilization, p. 35) {6}

They are busy by night and by day with meticulous research into such sciences as
are profitable to mankind… („Abdu‟l-Bahá, The Secret of Divine Civilization, p. 21)

The third Tajalli is concerning arts, crafts and sciences. Knowledge is as wings to
man's life, and a ladder for his ascent. Its acquisition is incumbent upon everyone.
The knowledge of such sciences, however, should be acquired as can profit the
peoples of the earth, and not those which begin with words and end with words.
Great indeed is the claim of scientists and craftsmen on the peoples of the world.
(Bahá‟u‟lláh, Tajallíyát, in Tablets of Bahá‟u‟lláh, pp. 51-52)

The eleventh Glad-Tidings
It is permissible to study sciences and arts, but such sciences as are useful and would
redound to the progress and advancement of the people. Thus hath it been decreed
by Him Who is the Ordainer, the All-Wise. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Bishárát, in Tablets of
Bahá‟u‟lláh, p. 26)

Unveiled and unconcealed, this Wronged One hath, at all times, proclaimed before

Bahá‟u‟lláh, particularly in His later Tablets, emphasizes the importance of acquiring useful sciences,
and enjoins this acquisition not only upon His followers, but upon the whole of humanity. In one
text He says that knowledge of geometry is preferable to a mastery of all the mystical literature of
Islam.
This principle cannot be overemphasized, as it is related to His counsel that words are more
important than deeds, and that great ideas must be realized in great actions in order to be of any real
value. On the other hand, we must be careful not to judge the sciences too critically, and must allow
that there may be usefulness in sciences which at first blush may appear to begin and end in words.
The sciences of textual analysis associated with higher criticism, the social sciences such as sociology,
anthropology, political science and economics, these are not as firmly grounded in empirical method as
the hard sciences. However, it is certain that they may be of value, inasmuch as they inform and
discipline our study of human behavior and human self-expression. On the other hand, Bahá‟u‟lláh
points out that the endless disputations of clerics and mystics are without utility, as they pertain to
things which, in many cases, do not exist except in the imaginations of their votaries.

How does one "become informed of the mysteries of the Holy Words"? Is this not a private endeavor,
to be pursued in the intimacy of one's home, of one's bed chamber, or if in public in the sanctified
space of a synagogue, church or mosque? Bahá‟u‟lláh would have us continue to pray and meditate in
private and in sanctuaries, but He would also have us study the Holy Words in our schools and
universities, and consult them in our workplaces and centers of civic life. To become so informed is not
only an intuitive exercise calling for purity of heart and submission of self, it is also an intellectual
enterprise requiring a sharp enquiring logic and a ready and facile tongue. It is not just a private
pursuit but also a public activity, and in the latter case it calls for consultation, for the participation of

each searching soul in dialogue to ferret out the truth. It is then both a feminine and a masculine
process, requiring humility and listening and sensitivity and association on the one hand and self-
confidence and speaking and courage and analysis on the other hand.

Strengthen Thou, O my Lord, the hearts of them that love Thee, that they may not be
affrighted by the hosts of the infidels that are turned back from Thee, but may follow
Thee in whatsoever hath been revealed by Thee. Aid them, moreover, to remember
and to praise Thee, and to teach Thy Cause with eloquence and wisdom.
(Bahá‟u‟lláh, Prayers and Meditations, XXXI, p. 38)

Endeavour to the utmost of thy powers to establish the word of truth with eloquence
and wisdom and to dispel falsehood from the face of the earth. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Tablets
of Bahá‟u‟lláh, p. 139)

Drink your fill from the well-spring of wisdom, and walk ye in the garden of wisdom,
and soar ye in the atmosphere of wisdom, and speak forth with wisdom and
eloquence. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Tablets of Bahá‟u‟lláh, p. 212)

He hath, moreover, ordained that His Cause be taught through the power of men's
utterance, and not through resort to violence. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Gleanings from the
Writings of Bahá‟u‟lláh, CXXVÍI, p. 278)

Aid ye your Lord with the sword of wisdom and of utterance.              (Bahá‟u‟lláh,
Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá‟u‟lláh, CXXXVI, p. 296)

Know thou that We have annulled the rule of the sword, as an aid to Our Cause, and
substituted for it the power born of the utterance of men. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Gleanings
from the Writings of Bahá‟u‟lláh, CXXXIX, p. 303)

Walk thou steadfastly in the love of God, and keep straight on in His Faith, and aid
Him through the power of thine utterance. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Gleanings from the
Writings of Bahá‟u‟lláh, CXLII, p. 312)

The Pen of the Most High hath decreed and imposed upon every one the obligation
to teach this Cause.... God will, no doubt, inspire whosoever detacheth himself from
all else but Him, and will cause the pure waters of wisdom and utterance to gush out
and flow copiously from his heart. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Gleanings from the Writings of
Bahá‟u‟lláh, CXLIV, p. 313)

He that wisheth to promote the Cause of the one true God, let him promote it
through his pen and tongue, rather than have recourse to sword or violence.
(Bahá‟u‟lláh, Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá‟u‟lláh, CLIV, pp. 329-330)

O ye loved ones of God! Drink your fill from the wellspring of wisdom, and soar ye in
the atmosphere of wisdom, and speak forth with wisdom and eloquence.
(Bahá‟u‟lláh, Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 99)

And when thy distinguished guests have assembled, speak to them about the Cause.
(„Abdu‟l-Bahá, from a Tablet translated from the Persian, in The Compilation of
Compilations, vol I, p. 268)

The teacher should not see in himself any superiority; he should speak with the
utmost kindliness, lowliness and humility, for such speech exerteth influence and
educateth the souls. ('Abdu'l-Bahá, SWAB, Sec 15, p. 30)

They must speak out, expound the proofs, set forth clear arguments, draw irrefutable
conclusions establishing the truth of the manifestation of the Sun of Reality.
('Abdu'l-Bahá, SWAB, Sec. 212, p. 268)

When a speaker's brow shineth with the radiance of the love of God, at the time of
his exposition of a subject, and he is exhilarated with the wine of true understanding,
he becometh the centre of a potent force which like unto a magnet will attract the
hearts. This is why the expounder must be in the utmost enkindlement. (From a
Tablet - translated from the Persian; in The Compilation of Compilations, vol. I, p.

Speak, therefore; speak out with great courage at every meeting. When you are
about to begin your address, turn first to Bahá'u'lláh and ask for the confirmations of
the Holy Spirit, then open your lips and say whatever is suggested to your heart; this,
however, with the utmost courage, dignity and conviction....('Abdu'l-Bahá, SWAB,
Sec. 216 p. 269)

Teaching individually is of great importance, and often enables you to confirm
people, whereas public speaking, while it carries the Message to more people, does
not confirm very many. You can do both. (From a letter dated 5 August 1949 written
on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer; in The Compilation of
Compilations, vol I, p. 315)

Now is the time to speak forth and to deliver speeches, the time to teach and to give
testimony. Loosen thy tongue, expound the truths, and establish the validity of the
verse: "The All-Merciful hath taught the Qur'án."[Qur‟án 55:2] The Holy Spirit
speaketh through the innermost essence of the human tongue, God's Spirit which
desireth communion with the human soul unfoldeth the truths, the Faithful Spirit
writeth down and the Spirit of the Ancient of Days confirmeth. I swear by that
Peerless Beauty, Who is in the Unseen Kingdom, that when the leaves loose their
tongues in praise and glorification of the All-Loving Lord, and in teaching the Cause
of the Kind Lord, the concourse of the Kingdom and the inmates of the Unseen
Realms will give ear, and cry out with exclamations of extreme joy and jubilation.
Glory be upon thee and upon every handmaiden who is steadfast in the Covenant.
(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian; in The Compilation of Compilations,
vol I, p. 398)

It ill beseemeth thee to turn thy gaze unto former or more recent times. Make thou
mention of this Day and magnify that which hath appeared therein. It will in truth
suffice all mankind. Indeed expositions and discourses in explanation of such things
cause the spirits to be chilled. It behoveth thee to speak forth in such wise as to set
the hearts of true believers ablaze and cause their bodies to soar. Teach thou the
Cause of God with an utterance which will cause the bushes to be enkindled, and the
call "Verily, there is no God but Me, the Almighty, the Unconstrained" to be raised

> therefrom. Say: Human utterance is an essence which aspireth to exert its influence

> The youth should be encouraged to train themselves in public speaking while they

> individual believer, published in Bahá'í News, No. 64 (July 1932), p 4; in The
> Compilation of Compilations, vol I, p. 420)

Most of our communications with others are spoken, not written. In speech we are able to
communicate our emotions, and to stir emotions in others that are virtually inaccessible to the writer.
If we are possessed of the most exquisite thought but do not find the words to clothe that thought and
convey it to others, there are only two who will know this thought--the one whose mind it alights into,
and God. God knows our thoughts before we act, so He also must know our thoughts before we
speak. But in order for our thoughts to be shared and not reside unaccompanied within our minds,
we must speak. The art of rhetoric, much neglected in the formal schooling of most young people and
adults, is highly regarded by Bahá‟u‟lláh and this art will be revived with great confidence and beauty
and power in our educational institutions. For this is the first Dispensation in which eloquence is so
highly praised, in which the silence of the child, the woman, the unlettered, the poor, the powerless is to
be broken.

> 19, 1932; in Lights of Guidance, p. 150)

The capacity of the human mind to store and organize words is a phenomenon that was appreciated in
former centuries, before the invention of those technologies which store information for our use, and
before the utilization of educational methods that reward a quick response to a variety of stimuli over
the settled methodical application of enduring principles. In the West we have not been asked to
memorize texts, not since early childhood, if at all. We've been required to memorize facts, dates,
names, formulae, equations, processes, but our memories are bereft of poetry, of drama, of Scripture.
We have not internalized any of the classics of our culture or of any other culture…our memory of
lyrics is reduced to reciting pop songs and television ads. Bahá‟u‟lláh does not ask us to memorize the
Bible, or the Qur‟án, or His voluminous Tablets and Books. But He does enjoin His followers to so
familiarize themselves with His utterances that we remember them intact and without alteration, and
are thus able to cite them at will, when we would refer to His teachings rather than to our own very
imperfect understanding of those teachings. When we are immersed in the Word from early childhood
and throughout our adult lives, it is inevitable that we will memorize much of the Word, and thereby
it is brought inside, thereby we are able to meditate upon it without having to refer to a printed
volume, without having to search through a database, without having to rely upon any intermediary,
to see the Self of God standing within us.

15\. gain a mastery of such books as the “Gleanings”, “The Dawn-Breakers”,
“God Passes By”, the “Íqán”, “Some Answered Questions” and the more

that are directly connected with the origin and birth of their Faith, with the

and the more important Tablets. All aspects of the Faith should be deeply studied

-- and ... they need to know more about the Administration. (4 May 1946 on behalf of
Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer) [74]

They must strive to obtain, from sources that are authoritative and unbiased, a sound
knowledge of the history and tenets of Islam -- the source and background of their
Faith -- and approach reverently and with a mind purged from preconceived ideas
the study of the Qur'án which, apart from the sacred scriptures of the Bábí and
Bahá'í Revelations, constitutes the only Book which can be regarded as an absolutely
authenticated Repository of the Word of God. They must devote special attention to
the investigation of those institutions and circumstances that are directly connected
with the origin and birth of their Faith, with the station claimed by its Forerunner,
and with the laws revealed by its Author. (25 December 1938 by Shoghi Effendi to
the Bahá'ís of the West, published in The Advent of Divine Justice (Wilmette: Bahá'í
Publishing Trust, 1990), p. 49) [73]

In anticipation of its forthcoming appearance Shoghi Effendi cabled American in
October 1931: "Urge all English speaking believers concentrate study Nabil's
immortal narrative as essential preliminary to renewed intensive Teaching Campaign
necessitated by completion Mashriqu'l-Adhkar. Strongly feel widespread use of its
varied rich and authentic material constitutes most effective weapon to meet
challenge of a critical hour. Unhesitatingly recommend it to every prospective visitor
of Bahá‟u‟lláh's native land." (Ruhiyyih Khanum, The Priceless Pearl, p. 217)Feel
impelled appeal entire body American believers to henceforth regard Nabíl's soul-
stirring Narrative as...source of inspiration in all literary and artistic pursuits...
(Shoghi Effendi, cablegram dated June 21, 1932,Messages to America 1932-1946, p. 1)

I would strongly urge you to utilize, to the utmost possible extent, the wealth of
authentic material gathered in Nabíl's stirring Narrative and to encourage the youth
to mater and to digest the facts recorded therein as a basis for their future work in the
teaching field, and as a sustenance to their spiritual life and activities in the service
of the Cause. (Shoghi Effendi, from a letter dated 9 November 1932 to an individual
believer)

Shoghi Effendi hopes that you will exert all your efforts to deepen your knowledge of
the literature of the Movement, until you become fully acquainted with its spirit and
tenets. Unless you do obtain such a firm hold you will never be able to teach others
and render real service to the promulgation of the Faith. Of special importance is the
Book of the Iqán which explains the attitude of the Cause towards the prophets of
God and their mission in the history of society. Besides this there is Some Answered
Questions of the Master and Dawn-Breakers of Nabíl. Every Bahá'í should master
these books and be able to explain their contents to others. Besides their importance,
they are interesting and most absorbing. (From a letter dated 9 February 1932
written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)

Shoghi Effendi undertook the translation of the Dawn-Breakers only after being
convinced that its publication will arouse the friends to greater self-sacrifice and a
more determined way of teaching. Otherwise he would not have devoted so much
time to it. Reading about the life and activities of those heroic souls is bound to

influence our mode of living and of the importance we attach to our services in the
Cause. Shoghi Effendi therefore hopes that the friends will read, nay rather study
that book, and encourage their young people to do that as well…
It is also very important to hold study classes and go deep in the teachings. A great
harm is done by starting to teach without being firmly grounded in the literature.
"Little knowledge is dangerous" fully applies to the teaching work. The friends
should read the Writings to be able to quote from the Tablets when discussing
subjects pertaining to the Faith. (From a letter dated 9 May 1932 written on behalf of
Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)

He fully approves the idea of holding study classes, for the deeper the friends go in
their understanding of the teachings the more firm and steadfast they will become
and more unwavering in their support of the institutions of the Faith. Books such as
the Iqán, Some Answered Questions and The Dawn-Breakers should be mastered by
every Bahá'í. The first two books will reveal the significance of this divine revelation
as well as the unity of all the Prophets of old. The last book will show how the Faith
was ushered into the world and how its early adherents heroically faced martyrdom
and suffering in their desire to establish the Cause throughout the world. Knowing
the life of those heroes will create in us the urge to follow their footsteps and achieve
the same. (From a letter dated 9 June 1932 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi an
individual believer)

Books such as the Iqán, Some Answered Questions, the Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh,
Nabíl's Narrative and Dr. Esslemont's book should be read and read over again by
every soul who desires to serve the Movement or considers himself an active member
of the group. (From a letter dated 9 November 1932 written on behalf of Shoghi
Effendi to an individual believer)

Shoghi Effendi found great pleasure and spiritual upliftment while working on the
translation of Nabíl's Narrative. The life of those who figure in it is so stirring that
every one who reads those accounts is bound to be affected and impelled to follow
their footsteps of sacrifice in the path of the Faith. The Guardian believes, therefore,
that it should be studied by the friends, especially the youth who need some
inspiration to carry them through these troubled days. (From a letter dated 11 March
1933 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi an individual believer)

The Guardian sincerely hopes and prays that the study of the Dawn-Breakers will
inspire the friends to greater activity and more exerted energy in serving the Cause
and spreading its message in that town. (From a letter dated 16 April 1933 written on
behalf of Shoghi Effendi, in The Light of Divine Guidance, vol. I, p. 24)

I certainly advise you to concentrate next year on the Dawn-Breakers, as well as on
the needs, the principles and the purpose of Bahá'í Administration. The Cause in
your land is still in its formative period. It needs men and women of vision, of
capacity and understanding. May your newly-established school render inestimable
services in this as well as in other fields of activity. I will pray for your high
endeavours from the depths of my heart. Rest assured and persevere. (Shoghi
Effendi, from a letter dated 25 September 1933 to an individual believer)

> The Guardian feels particularly appreciative of the emphasis your Committee has
> laid on the study of the "Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh" -- which book,
> he believes, should be the continued guide and companion of every believer,
> especially those who are actively engaged in teaching the Cause. It is his fervent

January 1936; in The Compilation of Compilations, vol. I, #484, p. 222)

> He is particularly pleased to realize that the book of "Gleanings" is of such a

Bahá‟í learning must have some fundamentals, and among these fundamentals are "mastery of such
books as" listed above. In our own time, it would no doubt include, by Bahá‟u‟lláh, Kitáb-i-ĺqán,
Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, Tablets revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Gems of
Divine Mysteries, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts; by „Abdu‟l-Bahá, Selections from the
Writings of „Abdu‟l-Bahá, Tablet to Dr. Forel, Tablets of the Divine Plan, The Secret of Divine
Civilization, Memorials of the Faithful, Will and Testament of „Abdu‟l-Bahá; by Shoghi Effendi,
God Passes By, The World Order of Bahá‟u‟lláh, The Citadel of Faith, The Advent of Divine
Justice, The Promised Day is Come. Of the thousands of Tablets and letters written by the Central
Figures and Guardian, it is essential that this core selection be mastered in order for the Bahá‟í
scholar to be intimately and profoundly well informed about the teachings and history of the Faith.
All of these volumes manifest these teachings and this history from the perspective of its Authors and
its Interpreters. This is not the human face of the Faith, it is the divine face of the Faith. Without
seeing Bahá‟u‟lláh through His own eyes, without seeing the Faith through the infallibly guided vision
of the Master and Guardian, how can we possibly make sense of what others have said about it?
How shall we differentiate between truth and falsity, between right and wrong? This is the balance,
and in its all things are weighed…if we weigh it in the balance of all things, we have no truth and
only a million opinions. Truth is one point, which the ignorant have multiplied…and multiplied…

16\. focus on the needs, the principles and the purpose of Bahá‟í Administration

> September 25, 1933: Centers of Bahá'í Learning, p. 8, a compilation of the Universal
> House of Justice, Wilmette, 1980 ed.; in Lights of Guidance, p. 558)

> ... To accept the Cause without the administration is like to accept the teachings
> without acknowledging the divine station of Bahá'u'lláh. To be a Bahá'í is to accept
> the Cause in its entirety. To take exception to one basic principle is to deny the

> Guidance, p. 2)

While not incumbent upon the new believer, knowledge of the Administrative Order is indispensable
to the Bahá‟í who would be of service to the community and through it the world. It is particularly
important for Bahá‟í scholars to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the New World Order of
Bahá‟u‟lláh inasmuch as it is precisely due to a lack of such understanding that a number of Bahá‟í
scholars have strayed from the unity of the community, strayed so far that they ultimately broke their
covenant with Bahá‟u‟lláh, either by leaving His body, the ark of His spiritual family, or by being
cut off from that body because of the malignancy of their disease. On the other hand, a profound
comprehension and application of principles from this Order will result in masterpieces of scholarship,
of spiritual science, such as the planet has never experienced. The Bahá‟í scholar will not comprehend

the unity of this Order with the spiritual and social teachings of Bahá‟u‟lláh unless he is as fully
conversant with all three aspects of the Faith.

17\. study of philosophy

> Philosophy, as you will study it and later teach it, is certainly not one of the sciences

> that not only are all the teachings not yet translated into English, but they are not
> even all collected yet. Many important Tablets may still come to light which are at
> present owned privately. (Shoghi Effendi, Letter written on behalf of the Guardian,
> dated 15 February 1947; in The Unfolding Destiny of the British Bahá‟í Community,
> p. 445)

> …it is recognized that the contemporary men of learning are highly qualified in
> philosophy, arts and crafts… (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Lawh-i-Hikmat, in Tablets of Bahá‟u‟lláh,
> p. 144)

> The essence and the fundamentals of philosophy have emanated from the Prophets.

(Bahá‟u‟lláh, Lawh-i-Hikmat, in Tablets of Bahá‟u‟lláh, p. 145)

Notwithstanding the undeniable encouragement which Bahá‟í students of philosophy have received
from the Faith, the Guardian was at pains nevertheless to make certain clarifications with regard to
the relationship between the philosophical writings of Bahá‟u‟lláh and the science of ideas. He wrote:
"For Bahá'u'lláh, we should readily recognize, has not only imbued mankind with a new and
regenerating Spirit. He has not merely enunciated certain universal principles, or propounded a
particular philosophy, however potent, sound and universal these may be." (Shoghi Effendi, The
World Order of Bahá‟u‟lláh, p. 19; Shoghi Effendi, in USBN, No. 59, February 1932, pp. 6-7)
At other time his secretary wrote on his behalf: "The Guardian hopes this will better enable you to
understand our wonderful Faith -- for a living religion it is, and not merely a philosophy!" (Extract,
letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, June 7th, 1946) And on another occasion: "For the
Cause is not a system of philosophy; it is essentially a way of life, a religious faith that seeks to unite
all people on a common basis of mutual understanding and love, and in a common devotion to God."
(Shoghi Effendi, Directives from the Guardian, p. 76)

Nor was Bahá‟u‟lláh an unreserved admirer of philosophy. In the Kalímát-i-Firdawsiyyih He writes
regarding Haji Mulla Hadi Sabzivari (d. 1873), a renowned philosopher and poet of Iran
contemporary with Himself: "Christ saith: 'Thou hast granted to children that whereof the learned
and the wise are deprived.' The sage of Sabzivar hath said: 'Alas! Attentive ears are lacking,
otherwise the whisperings of the Sinaic Bush could be heard from every tree.' In a Tablet to a man of
wisdom who had made enquiry as to the meaning of Elementary Reality, We addressed this famous
sage in these words: 'If this saying is truly thine, how is it that thou hast failed to hearken unto the
Call which the Tree of Man hath raised from the loftiest heights of the world? If thou didst hear the
Call yet fear and the desire to preserve thy life prompted thee to remain heedless to it, thou art such a
person as hath never been nor is worthy of mention; if thou hast not heard it, then thou art bereft of
the sense of hearing.' In brief, such men are they whose words are the pride of the world, and whose
deeds are the shame of the nations." (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Tablets of Bahá‟u‟lláh, p. 61) In the Lawh-i-
Maqsud, He writes: "The majority of Persia's learned doctors devote all their lives to the study of a
philosophy the ultimate yield of which is nothing but words." (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Tablets of Bahá‟u‟lláh,
p. 169) Hence it is evident that He did not have a high regard for those who turned to philosophy
rather than recognizing divine Revelation as the ultimate source of truth.
„Abdu‟l-Bahá echoes the same concern in a number of His treatises and talks, including in those in
which He describes His epistemology. Reason is the criterion of knowledge employed by philosophers,
and while it has yielded fruit and will continue to do so, He observes that philosophers do not agree,
and concludes thereby that this is not an infallible path to truth. He makes some rather pointed
comments about materialistic philosophy in one of His talks while sojourning in Europe: "Is the
materialistic philosophy of this Europe, so much praised by contemporary agnostics and atheists, a
philosophy to be admired? Are these people wooers of the spirit? Nay, they have drowned that
capacity and are out of touch with the kingdom of reality. Is this an enviable goal to which humanity
may aspire? Is this a system of philosophy through which people may become glorified? No, by God,
the philosophy of glory needs no scholastic curriculum." („Abdu‟l-Bahá, Divine Philosophy, p. 140)

Conclusions
This study represents a step in the direction of defining and developing a text-based and
intellectually and spiritually coherent approach to fruitful learning in the light of the
Bahá‟í teachings. The Research Department has prepared a series of compilations
related to Bahá‟í scholarship, and these have been mined and their contents correlated
with each other and with other passages related to the subject. The choice and
organization of these passages has been carried by one person and with one purpose in
mind, namely, to make the purposes and objectives of Bahá‟í scholarship as clearly
intelligible to a broad readership as could be expected. I have provided commentary
without attempting to comprehensively examine any of these topics, but simply to express
some personal thoughts and to provoke further discussion. While others will focus on
specific topics, what has been essayed here is an overview of all topics. While others will

express their emotions, their enthusiasm for, their faith in, or their struggle with
particular aims set forth here, I have attempted to cite and describe what is in the Bahá‟í
texts and not to burden the reader with my emotions. My personal response to the
material certainly has included strong emotions, and these have changed over time, as
emotions have a way of doing; but my conviction is that a rational and objective
discussion of the ideas set forth here is of greater value than the sharing of how we feel
about them. In any case, others will no doubt write about these topics with their
emotions in plain display and for readers who were expecting such from me, I encourage
you to find other authors who will more readily satisfy your inclinations.
There are a great number of texts which have not been cited, and which have not been
included in this study There are no conclusions that the present compiler would draw
from this survey, other than those that are articulated in the texts cited. Much more
research and analysis needs to be carried out before it will be possible to identify all of the
characteristics of an authentic and inclusive Bahá‟í vision of scholarship based upon the
source texts of the Faith. This effort is offered to all those interested in the spirit of
search.

II. Attaining to the Knowledge of God

One of the purposes of Bahá‟í scholarship (#9 in the foregoing study) is to attain to
the knowledge of God. Indeed, this is one of the fundamental purposes for the very
existence of human beings according to explicit statements of Bahá‟u‟lláh:

> I bear witness, O my God, that Thou hast created me to know Thee and to worship Thee.

(Short Obligatory Prayer)

> The purpose of God in creating man hath been, and will ever be, to enable him to know his
> Creator and to attain His Presence. (Gleanings, XXIX, p. 70)

> He hath called into being His creatures, that they may know Him, Who is the
> Compassionate, the All-Merciful. (Gleanings, LXXVI, pp. 144-145)

> Thou didst bring mankind into being to know Thee and to serve Thy Cause, that their
> station might thereby be elevated upon Thine earth and their souls be uplifted by
> virtue of the things Thou hast revealed in Thy Scriptures, Thy Books and Thy Tablets.

(Ishráqát, in TB:111)

> I testify, O my God, and my King, that Thou hast created me to remember Thee, to
> glorify Thee, and to aid Thy Cause. (ESW:3)

In this essay we will seek to discover this knowledge of God through a close
examination of the Kitáb-i-ĺqán and related passages from other works by Bahá‟u‟lláh.
This search will be conducted with the following principles in mind:

> …the reading of the scriptures and holy books is for no other purpose except to
> enable the reader to apprehend their meaning and unravel their innermost mysteries.
> Otherwise reading, without understanding, is of no abiding profit unto man.

(Bahá‟u‟lláh, Kitáb-i-ĺqán, p. 172)

> If any of the utterances of this Servant may not be comprehended, or may lead to
> perturbation, the same must be inquired of again, that no doubt may linger, and the
> meaning be clear… (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Seven Valleys, p. 40)

Bahá‟u‟lláh refers to the state of being which will alone enable one to attain to the
knowledge of God:

> With fixed and steady gaze, born of the unerring eye of God, scan for a while the
> horizon of divine knowledge, and contemplate those words of perfection which the
> Eternal hath revealed, that haply the mysteries of divine wisdom, hidden ere now
> beneath the veil of glory and treasured within the tabernacle of His grace, may be
> made manifest unto you. (KI:16-17)

In order to understand these verses we must comprehend Bahá‟u‟lláh's expression
"eye of God". In Kitáb-i-ĺqán there is another use of this expression: "then will the
manifold favours and outpouring grace of the holy and everlasting Spirit confer such new
life upon the seeker that he will find himself endowed with a new eye, a new ear, a new
heart, and a new mind. He will contemplate the manifest signs of the universe, and will
penetrate the hidden mysteries of the soul. Gazing with the eye of God, he will perceive
within every atom a door that leadeth him to the stations of absolute certitude. He will
discover in all things the mysteries of divine Revelation and the evidences of an everlasting
manifestation." (KI:196) In His Seven Valleys we find these verses: "In this station
[maqAm] he pierceth the veils of plurality, fleeth from the worlds of the flesh, and ascendeth
into the heaven of singleness. With the ear of God he heareth, with the eye of God he
beholdeth the mysteries of divine creation." (SV:17) The "station" is [maqám-i-tawhíd],
which is translated as "Valley of Unity". In another Tablet, translated and cited by
Shoghi Effendi in The Advent of Divine Justice, Bahá‟u‟lláh affirms: "Verily I say! No
one hath apprehended the root of this Cause. It is incumbent upon everyone, in this day, to
perceive with the eye of God, and to hearken with His ear. Whoso beholdeth Me with an eye
besides Mine own will never be able to know Me. None among the Manifestations of old,
except to a prescribed degree, hath ever completely apprehended the nature of this
Revelation." (ADJ:77)        In Kalímát-i-Firdawsiyyih Bahá‟u‟lláh also writes: "Certain
wrong-doers who profess allegiance to the Cause of God committed such deeds as have
caused the limbs of sincerity, of honesty, of justice, of equity to quake. One known
individual to whom the utmost kindness and favour had been extended perpetrated such
acts as have brought tears to the eye of God." (TB:59) Among the Tablets of „Abdu‟l-
Bahá in English translation, one was found which refers to this expression: "Know
verily, that the Ocean is waving, the Sun shining, the Stars dawning. (Understand what I
say!) The tree will grow, the earth will send forth hyacinths and give blessings, and man will
become the heavenly angels. Feed on the light of guidance and impart light to the people.
The bird will warble melodies unknown save by the birds of heaven; then tear asunder the
veil and see the realities of things with the eye of God. Verily, thy Lord guideth whomsoever
He willeth unto the Straight Path!" (TAB:II:560) This expression seems to refer to that
state of consciousness which the believer may attain, wherein he so empties himself of
his personal opinions, his attachments and desires, his worldly loves and hates, that he
can perceive with a pure heart. With a pure heart he sees with the eye of God, hears
with the ear of God, that is to say, he sees and hears what is real rather than the
imaginations which have been created by his own faculties and by the faculties of his
fellows.

> Both these sayings have but one meaning, were you to ponder upon the
> Manifestations of the Unity of God with divine insight. (KI:20)

It is implicit in this statement that human beings are able to "ponder…with divine
insight." As truly as human beings can of themselves only attain to human
perception, through their recognition of the Manifestation of God, they can attain to
"divine insight."

> Had they sought with a humble mind from the Manifestations of God in every
> Dispensation the true meaning of these words revealed in the sacred books--words
> the misapprehension of which hath caused men to be deprived of the recognition of
> the Sadratu'l-Muntaha, the ultimate Purpose--they surely would have been guided to
> the light of the Sun of Truth, and would have discovered the mysteries of divine
> knowledge and wisdom. (KI:28)

In order to be "guided to the light of the Sun of Truth," and discover "the mysteries of
divine knowledge and wisdom" we must seek with a humble mind the true meaning of
the Sacred Texts from the Manifestations of God. The "Sun of Truth" is one of the
names of the Manifestation of God. This not only associates that "divine knowledge
and wisdom" with the teachings of the Manifestations, but it also indicates that the
soul which wishes to attain to this knowledge must be humble and must turn to the
Manifestations for guidance. The Manifestation has therefore the role of teaching
"true knowledge and wisdom" to the humble soul.

> If these divines be illumined by the light of the latter Revelation they will be
> acceptable unto God, and will shine with a light everlasting. Otherwise, they will be
> declared as darkened, even though to outward seeming they be leaders of men,
> inasmuch as belief and unbelief, guidance and error, felicity and misery, light and
> darkness, are all dependent upon the sanction of Him Who is the Day-star of Truth.
> Whosever among the divines of every age receiveth, in the Day of Reckoning, the
> testimony of faith from the Source of true knowledge, he verily becometh the
> recipient of learning, of divine favour, and of the light of true understanding.
> Otherwise, he is branded as guilty of folly, denial, blasphemy, and oppression.
> It is evident and manifest unto every discerning observer that even as the light of the
> star fadeth before the effulgent splendor of the sun, so doth the luminary of earthly
> knowledge, of wisdom, and understanding vanish into nothingness when brought
> face to face with the resplendent glories of the Sun of Truth, the Daystar of divine
> enlightenment. (KI:36-37)

Bahá‟u‟lláh has explained that "the Day of Reckoning" is the time of the appearance
of the Manifestation of God: "It is evident that every age in which a Manifestation of
God hath lived is divinely ordained, and may, in a sense, be characterized as God's
appointed Day." (GL:XXV:60) The Manifestation is here called "the Day-star of
Truth", "the Source of true knowledge", "the Sun of Truth" and "the Day-star of
divine enlightenment." He states here that the learned and powerful leaders of men
are counseled to turn towards the Manifestation at the time of His appearance, for it
is attainment to His knowledge, the true knowledge that is incumbent upon all. If a
leader turns towards the Manifestation, he is accounted among the truly learned,
otherwise, he is accounted among the ignorant and deprived.

> If they be in the likeness of the Sun of Truth, they will surely be accounted as the
> most exalted of all luminaries; otherwise, they are to be recognized as the focal
> centres of hellish fire. (KI:37)

> Were the earth of their hearts to remain unchanged, how could such souls who have
> not been taught one letter, have seen no teacher, and entered no school, utter such
> words and display such knowledge as none can apprehend? Methinks they have
> been moulded from the clay of infinite knowledge, and kneaded from the water of
> divine wisdom. Therefore, hath it been said: 'Knowledge is a light which God
> casteth into the heart of whomsoever He willeth.' It is this kind of knowledge which
> is and hath ever been praiseworthy, and not the limited knowledge that hath sprung
> forth from veiled and obscured minds. This limited knowledge they even stealthily
> borrow one from the other, and vainly pride themselves therein! (KI:46)

True knowledge is from God, not from our own selves. It is found in our own hearts,
not in the borrowings we receive from others. This knowledge is attained, first and
foremost, through the recognition of the Manifestation of God, and through the
observance of whatsoever He reveals. This recognition is not an acquired learning; it
is an inner awakening which can not be borrowed, "one from the other" and which
engenders humility rather than "pride".

> Were the eye of the heart to open, it would surely perceive that the words revealed
> from the heaven of the will of God are at one with, and the same as, the deeds that
> have emanated from the Kingdom of divine power. (KI:57-58)

Here the spiritual perception required for the apprehension of true knowledge is
called the "eye of the heart".

> If the eye of justice be opened, it will readily recognize, in the light of that which
> hath been mentioned, that He, Who is the Cause and ultimate Purpose of all these
> things, is made manifest in this day. (KI:58-59)

Likewise, in this passage the "eye of justice" is associated with the spiritual perception
necessary for apprehension of true knowledge. The Manifestation of God is called
the Cause and ultimate Purpose of all these things.

> Know verily that Knowledge is of two kinds: Divine and Satanic. The one welleth out
> from the fountain of divine inspiration; the other is but a reflection of vain and
> obscure thoughts. The source of the former is God Himself; the motive-force of the
> latter the whisperings of selfish desire…From the sayings of those Masters of holy
> utterance, Who have expounded the meaning of true knowledge, the odour of these
> dark teachings, which have obscured the world, can in no wise be detected. (KI:69)

Bahá‟u‟lláh is speaking of knowledge of spiritual matters here, and He indicates that
this knowledge is either revealed by God or is inspired by the selfish animal nature of

human beings--that nature which is not transformed by the Revelation of the
Manifestation of God. The Manifestations are called "the Masters of holy utterance".

> Our hope is that, God willing, the breeze of mercy may blow, and the divine
> Springtime clothe the tree of being with the robe of new life; so that we may discover
> the mysteries of divine Wisdom, and, through His providence, be made independent
> of the knowledge of all things. We have, as yet, descried none but a handful of souls,
> destitute of all renown, who have attained unto this station. Let the future disclose
> what the Judgment of God will ordain, and the Tabernacle of His decree reveal. In
> such wise We recount unto thee the wonders of the Cause of God, and pour out into
> thine ears the strains of heavenly melody, that haply thou mayest attain unto the
> station of true knowledge, and partake of the fruit thereof. (KI:129-130)

Here Bahá‟u‟lláh makes allusion to His own prophetic mission, to the imminence of
"the divine Springtime" which He will usher into existence. Throughout His
Writings, "the divine Springtime" refers to that period of time when the new
Manifestation of God appears, signaling the commencement of a new Dispensation, a
new cycle of divine civilization. It is only through His Revelation during this "divine
Springtime" that "we may discover the mysteries of divine Wisdom" and "be made
independent of the knowledge of all things"--that is, independent of all human
learning. It is only if the reader of these words recognizes Bahá‟u‟lláh that he can hear
"the strains of heavenly melody" and "attain unto the station of true knowledge, and
partake of the fruit thereof."

> Although the sole and fundamental purpose of all learning, and the toil and labour
> thereof, is attainment unto, and the recognition of, this station, yet they are all
> immersed in the pursuit of their material studies. They deny themselves every
> moment of leisure, and utterly ignore Him, Who is the Essence of all learning, and
> the one Object of their quest. Methinks, their lips have never touched the cup of
> divine Knowledge, nor do they seem to have attained even a dewdrop of the showers
> of heavenly grace. (KI:145)

The "purpose of all learning" is "attainment unto, and recognition of" the
Manifestation of God, Who is here called "the Essence of all learning, and the one
Object of their quest."

> And how many of the ignorant who, by reason of their acceptance of the Faith, have
> soared aloft and attained the high summit of knowledge, and whose names have
> been inscribed by the Pen of Power upon the Tablet of divine knowledge. (KI:146)

> Notwithstanding the obviousness of this theme, in the eyes of those that have
> quaffed the wine of knowledge and certitude, yet how many are those who, through
> failure to understand its meaning, have allowed the term "Seal of the Prophets" to
> obscure their understanding, and deprive them of the grace of all His manifold
> bounties! (KI:161-162)

> We have consumed this densest of all veils, with the fire of the love of the Beloved--
> the veil referred to in the saying: "The most grievous of all veils is the veil of
> knowledge." Upon its ashes, We have reared the tabernacle of divine knowledge.
> We have, praise be to God, burned the "veils of glory" with the fire of the beauty of
> the Best-Beloved. We have driven from the human heart all else but Him Who is the
> Desire of the world, and glory therein. We cleave to no knowledge but His
> Knowledge, and set our hearts on naught save the effulgent glories of His light.

(KI:188)

Bahá‟u‟lláh here alludes to His prophetic station, and indicates that whatever He
reveals is from God rather than from himself. Even as He calls upon His readers to
trust in the divine knowledge of the Manifestation rather than in their own acquired
knowledge, He indicates that He Himself is detached from all knowledge but the
knowledge revealed to Him by God.

> Upon detached souls they bestow the gift of Unity, enrich the destitute, and offer the
> cup of knowledge unto them who wander in the wilderness of ignorance. All the
> guidance, the blessings, the learning, the understanding, the faith, the certitude,
> conferred upon all that is in heaven and on earth, are hidden and treasured within
> these Cities. (KI:200)

These Cities are "the Word of God revealed in every age and dispensation. In the
days of Moses it was the Pentateuch; in the days of Jesus the Gospel; in the days of
Muhammad the Messenger of God the Qur‟án; in this day the Bayan; and in the
dispensation of Him Whom God will make manifest His own Book…" (KI:199)
True knowledge is to be derived only from the Word of God, and this brings the soul
of the true believer to a state of unity with God through unity with His Manifestation.
The seeker need look nowhere else for true knowledge of spiritual realities--it is all to
be found in the Word of God, the Sacred Texts. In the Writings of the Báb we find a
statement differentiating the value of the knowledge of God revealed by the
Manifestation from the value of human knowledge as found in human beings:

> Verily on that Day the learning of the learned shall prove of no avail, neither the
> accomplishments of the exponents of knowledge, nor the pomp of the highly
> honoured, nor the power of the mighty, nor the remembrance of the devout, nor the
> deeds of the righteous, nor the genuflexion of the kneeling worshipper, nor his
> prostration or turning towards the Qiblih, nor the honour of the honoured, nor the
> kinship of the highly born, nor the nobility of those of noble descent, nor the
> discourse of the eloquent, nor the titles of the prominent—none of these shall be of
> any avail unto them—inasmuch as all these and whatever else ye have known or
> comprehended were created by His word of command „Be‟ and it is. Indeed if it be
> His Will He can assuredly bring about the resurrection of all created things through
> a word from Himself. He is, in truth, over and above all this, the All-Powerful, the
> Almighty, the Omnipotent.

> Beware, O concourse of Mirrors, lest on that Day titles make you vainglorious. Know
> ye of a certainty that ye, together with all those who stand above you or below you,
> have been created for that Day. Fear ye God and commit not that which would grieve
> His heart, nor be of them that have gone astray. Perchance He will appear invested
> with the power of Truth while ye are fast asleep on your couches, or His messengers
> will bring glorious and resplendent Tablets from Him while ye turn away disdainfully
> from Him, pronounce sentence against Him—such sentence as ye would never pass
> on yourselves—and say, „This is not from God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Existent‟.

(Selections from the Writings of the Báb, pp. 165-166)

This same principle is found in one of the Tablets of Bahá‟u‟lláh:

> O ye wise men of the City and philosophers of the world! Beware lest human
> learning and wisdom cause you to wax proud before God, the Help in Peril, the Self-
> Subsisting. Know ye that true wisdom is to fear God, to know Him, and to recognize
> His Manifestations. This wisdom, however, can be attained only by those who
> detach themselves from the world, and who walk in the ways of the good pleasure of
> their Lord. Are ye possessed of greater wisdom than the one who contrived a moon
> which would rise from one well and set in another, and whose light was visible at a
> distance of three leagues? God, verily, blotted out every trace of his works and
> returned him unto dust, as ye have already heard or are now informed.
> How many the sages and philosophers who equalled or surpassed him in learning

> God doth not ask you of your sciences, but of your faith and of your conduct. Are ye
> greater in wisdom than the One Who brought you into being, Who fashioned the
> heavens and all that they contain, the earth and all that dwell upon it? Gracious God!
> True wisdom is His. All creation and its empire are His. He bestoweth His wisdom
> upon whomsoever He chooseth amongst men, and withholdeth it from whomsoever
> He desireth. He, in truth, is the Bestower and the Withholder, and He, verily, is the
> All-Bountiful, the All-Wise.
> O ye learned of the world! Ye failed to seek Our presence, that ye might hearken unto

> that would have rendered you independent of all else. But this ye failed to do, and
> thus hath the decree of God been fulfilled. Now have I been forbidden to disclose it,

> Powerful, the Self-Sufficient.
> I counsel you, in the end, not to overstep the bounds of God, nor to heed the ways

> rather, your gaze upon the precepts of God. Whosoever desireth, let him accept this

> counsel as a path leading unto his Lord, and whosoever desireth, let him return to his

> heavens and on the earth, and above all that they say and do. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, The
> Summons of the Lord of Hosts, pp. 233-235)

> Your sciences shall not profit you in this day, nor your arts, nor your treasures, nor
> your glory. Cast them all behind your backs, and set your faces towards the Most
> Sublime Word through which the Scriptures and the Books and this lucid Tablet

> Knowledge hath shone forth above the horizon of certitude. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, TB, p. 211;
> Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, pp. 97-98)

This true learning of the Manifestation of God is affirmed in another context:

> O Temple of Holiness! We, verily, have made Thine inmost heart the treasury of all
> the knowledge of past and future ages, and the dawning-place of Our own
> knowledge which We have ordained for the dwellers of earth and heaven, that all
> creation may partake of the outpourings of Thy grace and may attain, through the
> wonders of Thy knowledge, unto the recognition of God, the Exalted, the Powerful,
> the Great. In truth, that knowledge which belongeth unto Mine own Essence is such
> as none hath ever attained or will ever grasp, nor shall any heart be capable of
> bearing its weight. Were We to disclose but a single word of this knowledge, the
> hearts of all men would be filled with consternation, the foundations of all things
> would crumble into ruin, and the feet of even the wisest among men would be made
> to slip.
> 'Within the treasury of Our Wisdom there lieth unrevealed a knowledge, one word of
> which, if we chose to divulge it to mankind, would cause every human being to
> recognize the Manifestation of God and to acknowledge His omniscience, would
> enable every one to discover the secrets of all the sciences, and to attain so high a
> station as to find himself wholly independent of all past and future learning. Other
> knowledges We do as well possess, not a single letter of which We can disclose, nor
> do We find humanity able to hear even the barest reference to their meaning. Thus
> have We informed you of the knowledge of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.'
> [translated and cited by Shoghi Effendi in WOB:109] Were We to find worthy
> vessels, We would deposit within them the treasures of hidden meanings and impart
> unto them a knowledge, one letter of which would encompass all created things.
> O Inmost Heart of this Temple! We have made thee the dawning-place of Our
> knowledge and the dayspring of Our wisdom unto all who are in heaven and on
> earth. From thee have We caused all sciences to appear, and unto thee shall We
> cause them to return. And from thee shall We bring them forth a second time. Such,
> indeed, is Our promise, and potent are We to effect Our purpose. Erelong shall We
> bring into being through thee exponents of new and wondrous sciences, of potent
> and effective crafts, and shall make manifest through them that which the heart of
> none of Our servants hath yet conceived. Thus do We bestow upon whom We will
> whatsoever We desire, and thus do We withdraw from whom We will what We had
> once bestowed. Even so do We ordain whatsoever We please through Our behest.

(Bahá‟u‟lláh, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, pp. 34-46)

True knowledge is not circumscribed--it is infinite. Bahá‟u‟lláh affirms the limitless
riches of divine wisdom and knowledge in a number of His Tablets:

> Notwithstanding all that We have mentioned, how innumerable are the pearls which
> have remained unpierced in the shell of Our heart! How many huris of inner
> meaning that are as yet concealed within the chambers of divine wisdom! (KI:70)

The "huris of inner meaning" refers the beauty of spiritual meanings who are like the
"húrun" of the Qur‟án (56:22-23): "with eyes like pearls" who are promised to the
believers in Islam. Just as these "maidens" are concealed in the "mansions" of
Paradise, so also, the inner meanings are "concealed within the chambers of divine
wisdom".

> Behold, how many are the mysteries that lie as yet unravelled within the tabernacle
> of the knowledge of God, and how numerous the gems of His wisdom that are still
> concealed in His inviolable treasuries! Shouldst thou ponder this in thine heart, thou
> wouldst realize that His handiwork knoweth neither beginning nor end. The domain
> of His decree is too vast for the tongue of mortals to describe, or for the bird of the
> human mind to traverse; and the dispensations of His providence are too mysterious
> for the mind of man to comprehend. His creation no end hath overtaken, and it hath
> ever existed from the "Beginning that hath no beginning"; and the Manifestations of
> His Beauty no beginning hath beheld, and they will continue to the "End that
> knoweth no end." Ponder this utterance in thine heart, and reflect how it is
> applicable unto all these holy Souls. (KI:167)

> Immeasurably exalted is the celestial Melody above the strivings of human ear to
> hear or mind to grasp its mystery! How can the helpless ant step into the court of the
> All-Glorious? And yet, feeble souls, through lack of understanding, reject these
> abstruse utterances, and question the truth of such traditions. Nay, none can
> comprehend them save those that are possessed of an understanding heart. (KI:168)

> By God! This Bird of Heaven, now dwelling upon the dust, can, besides these
> melodies, utter a myriad songs, and is able, apart from these utterances, to unfold
> innumerable mysteries. Every single note of its unpronounced utterances is
> immeasurably exalted above all that hath already been revealed, and immensely
> glorified beyond that which hath streamed from this Pen. Let the future disclose the
> hour when the Brides of inner meaning, will, as decreed by the Will of God, hasten
> forth, unveiled, out of their mystic mansions, and manifest themselves in the ancient
> realm of being. Nothing whatsoever is possible without His permission; no power
> can endure save through His power, and there is none other God but He. His is the
> world of creation, and His the Cause of God. All proclaim His Revelation, and all
> unfold the mysteries of His Spirit. (KI:175-176)

The "Bird of Heaven" is Bahá‟u‟lláh, and here He alludes to His prophetic station.
The "Brides of inner meaning" are also called the "huris of inner meaning" (KI:70),
namely, those inner meanings which will, in due course, become manifest. Not until
the designated "hour" is come will His station be fully disclosed, and the spiritual
teachings latent within His consciousness be revealed to the world.

> All that I have revealed unto thee with the tongue of power, and have written for thee
> with the pen of might, hath been in accordance with thy capacity and understanding,
> not with My state and the melody of My voice. (Arabic Hidden Words: #67)

This citation from the Arabic Hidden Words -- revealed some years prior to the
Kitáb-i-ĺqán -- denotes the infinite capacity of the Manifestation of God to reveal
truths, as well as the revelation of those truths according to limited human capacity.

> How great the multitude of truths which the garment of words can never contain!
> How vast the number of such verities as no expression can adequately describe,
> whose significance can never be unfolded, and to which not even the remotest
> allusions can be made! How manifold are the truths which must remain unuttered
> until the appointed time is come! Even as it hath been said: "Not everything that a
> man knoweth can be disclosed, nor can everything that he can disclose be regarded
> as timely, nor can every timely utterance be considered as suited to the capacity of
> those who hear it." (GL:LXXXIX:176)

In this citation from "Tafsir Súrat va'l-Shams" Bahá‟u‟lláh indicates that divine
knowledge and wisdom is infinite, but that it is revealed according to the exigencies of
humanity's spiritual development. He also states that many truths cannot be
expressed in words. In "Seven Valleys" He refers to this theme:

> The tongue faileth in describing these three Valleys, and speech falleth short. The
> pen steppeth not into this region, the ink leaveth only a blot. In these planes, the
> nightingale of the heart hath other songs and secrets, which make the heart to stir
> and the soul to clamor, but this mystery of inner meaning may be whispered only
> from heart to heart, confided only from breast to breast. (SV:30)

The three Valleys which words cannot describe are, the Valley of Contentment
[madínih-i-istighná], the Valley of Wonderment [vadí-i-hayrat] and the Valley of True
Poverty and Absolute Nothingness [vadí-i-faqir haqíqí va fanáí así]. This subject, of
the limitations of human language, and of "others songs and secrets" is treated in a
separate monograph entitled "Language of the Spirit."

Notwithstanding the limitations of words, Bahá‟u‟lláh states unequivocally that the
Word of God, the source of divine knowledge, is meant to be understood by human
beings:

> They have even failed to realize, all this time, that, in every age, the reading of the
> scriptures and holy books is for no other purpose except to enable the reader to
> apprehend their meaning and unravel their innermost mysteries. Otherwise reading,
> without understanding, is of no abiding profit unto man. (KI:172)

In certain verses of the Seven Valleys and also in the Arabic Hidden Words
Bahá‟u‟lláh states that the words He has revealed are meant to be understood:

> If any of the utterances of this Servant may not be comprehended, or may lead to
> perturbation, the same must be inquired of again, that no doubt may linger, and the
> meaning be clear as the Face of the Beloved One shining from the "Glorious
> Station." [maqám-i-mahmúd, Qur‟án 17:81] (SV:40)

> All that I have revealed unto thee with the tongue of power, and have written for thee
> with the pen of might, hath been in accordance with thy capacity and understanding,
> not with My state and the melody of My voice. (Arabic Hidden Words: #67)

Bahá‟u‟lláh also explains that the common people can understand the Word of God,
not just an elite, whether they be the "learned" or the "mystics":

> Heed not the idle contention of those who maintain that the Book and the verses
> thereof can never be a testimony unto the common people, inasmuch as they neither
> grasp their meaning nor appreciate their value. And yet, the unfailing testimony of
> God to both the East and the West is none other than the Qur‟án. Were it beyond
> the comprehension of men, how could it have been declared as a universal testimony
> unto all people? If their contention be true, none would therefore be required, nor
> would it be necessary for them to know God, inasmuch as the knowledge of the
> divine Being transcendeth the knowledge of His Book, and the common people
> would not possess the capacity to comprehend it.
> Such contention is utterly fallacious and inadmissable. It is actuated solely by
> arrogance and pride. Its motive is to lead the people astray from the Ridvan of divine
> good-pleasure and to tighten the reins of their authority over the people. And yet, in
> the sight of God, these common people are infinitely superior and exalted above their
> religious leaders who have turned away from the one true God. (KI:210-211)

In this context, those religious leaders "who have turned away from the one true
God" are those Muslim (and other) clerics who have rejected the Báb and Bahá‟u‟lláh,
while "these common people" who "are infinitely superior and exalted above" those
clerics are the Bábis and subsequently the Bahá‟ís who have recognized the Báb and
Bahá‟u‟lláh.

> …the wine of renunciation must needs be attained, and the meditation referred to in
> the words "One hour's reflection is preferable to seventy years of pious worship"
> must needs be observed, so that the secret of the wretched behavior of the people
> might be discovered, those people who, despite the love and yearning for truth which

> they profess, curse the followers of Truth when once He hath been made manifest.

(KI:238)

Bahá‟u‟lláh indicates that one hour of reflection, of thought is of more value than
seventy years (a whole lifespan) of pious worship without such reflection. For one
hour of reflection may result in recognizing the new Manifestation of God and
subsequently following His teachings, while pious worship in itself may result in the
rejection of the new Manifestation. In "Seven Proofs" the Báb affirms that many
Muslims have failed to recognize His prophethood because they are too devoted to
religious practice, because they imitate the thoughts as well as the practices of their
forebears rather than investigating the truth for themselves. This seems to be akin to
the Socratic saying: The unexamined life is not worth living. Bahá‟u‟lláh refers to the
insight which may result from reflection upon the truth in other passages of His
Writings:

> Wert thou, for the sake of God, to ponder, though it be but for an hour, upon the
> things which have occurred in former times and more recently, thou wouldst turn
> away from the things thou dost possess unto the things which belong unto God, and
> wouldst become a means for the exaltation of His Word. (ESW:92)

Bahá‟u‟lláh is addressing here Shaykh Muhammad Taqiy-i-Najafi, a violent enemy of
the Bahá‟í Faith resident in the city of Isfahan. Just as He counselled Haji Mirza
Siyyid Muhammad, one of the maternal uncles of the Báb, in Kitáb-i-ĺqán in circa
1861, so also He counseled Ibn-i-Dhi'b (the Shaykh whom He denominated the "Son
of the Wolf") in circa 1891, to take one hour to reflect upon the way things are and to
consider His claims and those of the Báb.

> It is evident that nothing short of this mystic transformation could cause such spirit
> and behaviour, so utterly unlike their previous habits and manners, to be made
> manifest in the world of being. For their agitation was turned into peace, their doubt
> into certitude, their timidity into courage. Such is the potency of the Divine Elixir,
> which, swift as the twinkling of an eye, transmuteth the souls of men!
> For instance, consider the substance of copper. Were it to be protected in its own
> mine from becoming solidified, it would, within the space of seventy years, attain to
> the state of gold. There are some, however, who maintain that copper itself is gold,
> which by becoming solidified is in a diseased condition, and hath not therefore
> reached its own state.
> Be that as it may, the real elixir will, in one instant, cause the substance of copper to
> attain the state of gold, and will traverse the seventy-year stages in a single moment.
> Could this gold be called copper? Could it be claimed that it hath not attained the
> state of gold, whilst the touch-stone is at hand to assay it and distinguish it from
> copper? Likewise, these souls, through the potency of the Divine Elixir, traverse, in
> the twinkling of an eye, the world of dust and advance into the realm of holiness; and
> with one step cover the earth of limitations and reach the domain of the Placeless.

(KI:156-157)

In this passage, Bahá‟u‟lláh uses the imagery and terminology of alchemy in order to
make the same point. In Seven Valleys He also alludes to the potency of the
transformative moment:

> These journeys have no visible ending in the world of time, but the severed
> wayfarer…may cross these seven stages in seven steps, nay rather in seven breaths,
> nay rather in a single breath, if God will and desire it. (SV:40-41)

We human beings are meant to understand the Word of God, and this understanding
is not limited to the learned but is accessible to the "common people".          But
Bahá‟u‟lláh does not indicate that human understanding of the Word of God is
bestowed upon every individual equally, and that the gift of understanding is
distributed in equal measure to each person. On the contrary, He indicates that the
capacity of each person is unique, and that each must seek to understand according to
his own capacity rather than according to the capacity of others:

> Thereupon, We imparted unto him, according to the measure of his capacity and
> understanding, certain truths of science and ancient Wisdom. (KI:173)

> We have variously and repeatedly set forth the meaning of every theme, that
> perchance every soul, whether high or low, may obtain, according to his measure and
> capacity, his share and portion thereof. Should he be unable to comprehend a
> certain argument, he may, thus, by referring unto another, attain his purpose. "That
> all sorts of men may know where to quench their thirst." [Qu'ran 6:127] (KI:175)

> In fact, all the Scriptures and the mysteries thereof are condensed into this brief
> account. So much so, that were a person to ponder it a while in his heart, he would
> discover from all that hath been said the mysteries of the Words of God, and would
> apprehend the meaning of whatever hath been manifested by that ideal King. As the
> people differ in their understanding and station, We will accordingly make mention
> of a few traditions, that these may impart constancy to the wavering soul, and
> tranquillity to the troubled mind. Thereby, will the testimony of God unto the people
> , both high and low, be complete and perfect. (KI:237-238)

The "ideal King" is, in this context, Muhammad, the Messenger of God. Elsewhere,
this appellation may refer either to the Manifestation of God, or to God Himself.
The "traditions" to which Bahá‟u‟lláh refers are called "hadith" and they represent
sayings of Muhammad which were allegedly reported and written down during His
lifetime or shortly thereafter but which are not part of the Qur‟án; and sayings of the
twelve Imams who are recognized by Ithna 'Ashari Shí'í Muslims (in Iran, 'Iraq,
Afghanistan, Syria and elsewhere) as the authentic interpreters of the teachings of
Muhammad.

> Of these truths some can be disclosed only to the extent of the capacity of the
> repositories of the light of Our knowledge, and the recipients of Our hidden grace.

(GL:LXXXIX:176)

In "Tafsir Súrat va'l-Shams" Bahá‟u‟lláh is here referring to the followers of the
Manifestations, not to the Manifestations Themselves. If His intention had been to
indicate the Manifestations, this would have been reflected in the Guardian's
translation, and "repositories" and "recipients" would have been capitalized.

> The essence and the fundamentals of philosophy have emanated from the Prophets.
> That the people differ concerning the inner meanings and mysteries thereof is to be
> attributed to the divergence of their views and minds. (TB:145)

We have seen that according to Bahá‟u‟lláh, human learning is not necessary for
recognition of divine knowledge and wisdom. We have also learned that divine
knowledge is unlimited and that which is revealed to us does not represent its riches
but rather our capacity to understand those riches; that many truths cannot be
conveyed in words; that the Word of God can be understood by common people;
that the capacity for its understanding differs in each individual human being. What
then is required of the human being, in order to attain to this divine knowledge?

> They should put their trust in God, and holding fast unto Him, follow in His way.
> Then will they be made worthy of the effulgent glories of the sun of divine
> knowledge and understanding, and become the recipients of a grace that is infinite
> and unseen, inasmuch as man can never hope to attain unto the knowledge of the
> All-Glorious, can never quaff from the stream of divine knowledge and wisdom, can
> never enter the abode of immortality, nor partake of the cup of divine nearness and
> favour, unless and until he ceases to regard the words and deeds of mortal men as a
> standard for the true understanding and recognition of God and His Prophets.

(KI:3-4)

There is no way to attain to this "stream of divine knowledge and wisdom" except by
purifying the heart:

> Unto every discerning observer it is evident and manifest that had these people in the
> days of each of the Manifestations of the Sun of Truth sanctified their eyes, their
> ears, and their hearts from whatever they had seen, heard, and felt, they surely would
> not have been deprived of beholding the beauty of God, nor strayed far from the
> habitations of glory. (KI:14-15)

> This is the food that conferreth everlasting life upon the pure in heart and the
> illumined in spirit. (KI:22-23)

> O my brother! Take thou the step of the spirit, so that, swift as the twinkling of an
> eye, thou mayest flash through the wilds of remoteness and bereavement, attain the

> Ridvan of everlasting reunion, and in one breath commune with the heavenly Spirits.
> For with human feet thou canst never hope to traverse these immeasurable distances,
> nor attain thy goal. Peace be upon him whom the light of truth guideth unto all
> truth, and who, in the name of God, standeth in the path of His Cause, upon the
> shore of true understanding. (KI:43)

> Would that the hearts of men could be cleansed from these man-made limitations
> and obscure thoughts imposed upon them! haply they may be illumined by the light
> of the Sun of true knowledge, and comprehend the mysteries of divine wisdom.

(KI:47)

The "Sun of true knowledge" is the Manifestation of God.

> The heart must needs therefore be cleansed from the idle sayings of men, and
> sanctified from every earthly affection, so that it may discover the hidden meaning of
> divine inspiration, and become the treasury of the mysteries of divine knowledge.

(KI:70)

> It is incumbent upon thee, by the permission of God, to cleanse the eye of thine heart
> from the things of the world, that thou mayest realize the infinitude of divine
> knowledge, and mayest behold Truth so clearly that thou wilt need no proof to
> demonstrate His reality, nor any evidence to bear witness unto His testimony.

> Shouldst thou ponder these words in thine heart, thou wilt of a certainty find the
> doors of divine wisdom and infinite knowledge flung open before thy face. (KI:102)

> Wert thou to attain to but a dewdrop of the crystal waters of divine knowledge, thou
> wouldst readily realize that true life is not the life of the flesh but the life of the spirit.
> For the life of the flesh is common to both men and animals, whereas the life of the
> spirit is possessed only by the pure in heart who have quaffed from the ocean of faith
> and partaken of the fruit of certitude. This life knoweth no death, and this existence
> is crowned by immortality. (KI:120)

> Only those will attain to the knowledge of the Word of God that have turned unto
> Him, and repudiated the manifestations of Satan. (KI:122-123)

> Strive, therefore, O my brother, to grasp the meaning of "Resurrection," and cleanse
> thine ears from the idle sayings of these rejected people. Shouldst thou step into the
> realm of complete detachment, thou wilt readily testify that no day is mightier than
> this Day, and that no resurrection more awful than this Resurrection can ever be
> conceived. (KI:144)

> Ponder this in thine heart, that the sweet gales of divine knowledge, blowing from
> the meads of mercy, may waft upon thee the fragrance of the Beloved's utterance,
> and cause thy soul to attain the Ridvan of understanding. (KI:149)

The "Beloved" is the Manifestation of God.

> …cleanse the darkened self with the waters of mercy flowing from the Source of
> divine knowledge; that perchance thou mayest, through the power of God and the
> light of divine guidance, distinguish the Morn of everlasting splendour from the
> darksome night of error. (KI:151-152)

The "Source of divine knowledge" and the "Morn of everlasting splendour" are
references to the Manifestation of God.

> And yet, feeble souls, through lack of understanding, reject these abstruse
> utterances, and question the truth of such traditions. Nay, none can comprehend
> them save those that are possessed of an understanding heart. Say, He is that End
> for Whom no end is all the universe can be imagined, and for Whom no beginning in
> the world of creation can be conceived. Behold, O concourse of the earth, the
> splendours of the End, revealed in the Manifestations of the Beginning! (KI:168)

> Thus the peoples of the world are judged by their countenance. By it, their misbelief,
> their faith, and their iniquity are all made manifest. Even as it is evident in this day
> how the people of error are, by their countenance, known and distinguished from the
> followers of divine Guidance. Were these people, wholly for the sake of God and with
> no desire but His good-pleasure, to ponder the verses of the Book in their heart, they
> would of a certainty find whatsoever they seek…No man, however, can comprehend
> this except he who is possessed of an understanding heart. (KI:173-174)
> Whoso desireth to fathom the mystery of this "Mi'raj," and craveth a drop from this
> ocean, if the mirror of his heart be already obscured by the dust of these learnings, he
> must needs cleanse and purify it ere the light of this mystery can be reflected therein.

> We have driven from the human heart all else but Him Who is the Desire of the
> world, and glory therein. (KI:188)

"Him Who is the Desire of the world" is the Manifestation of God.

> O my brother! A divine Mine only can yield the gems of divine knowledge, and the
> fragrance of the mystic Flower can be inhaled only in the ideal Garden, and the lilies
> of ancient wisdom can blossom nowhere except in the city of a stainless heart. "In a
> rich soil, its plants spring forth abundantly by permission of its Lord, and in that soil
> which is bad, they spring forth but scantily." [Qur‟án 7:57] (KI:191)

A "divine Mine" and "the mystic Flower" are references to the Manifestation of God.

> But, O my brother, when the true seeker determines to take the step of search in the
> path leading to the knowledge of the Ancient of Days, he must, before all else,
> cleanse and purify his heart, which is the seat of the revelation of the inner mysteries
> of God, from the obscuring dust of all acquired knowledge, and the allusions of the
> embodiments of satanic fancy. He must purge his breast, which is the sanctuary of

> the abiding love of the Beloved, of every defilement, and sanctify his soul from all
> that pertaineth to water and clay, from all shadowy and ephemeral attachments. He
> must so cleanse his heart that no remnant of either love or hate may linger therein,
> lest that love blindly incline him to error, or that hate repel him away from the truth.
> Even as thou dost witness in this day how most of the people, because of such love
> and hate, are bereft of the immortal Face, have strayed far from the Embodiments of
> the divine mysteries, and, shepherdless, are roaming through the wilderness of
> oblivion and error. (KI:192-193)

The "immortal Face" and the "Embodiments of the divine mysteries" are references
to the Manifestation of God.

> With unswerving vision, with pure heart, and sanctified spirit, consider attentively
> what God hath established as the testimony of guidance for His people in His Book,
> which is recognized as authentic by both the high and lowly. (KI:202)

In this context, "His Book" is the Qur‟án, but generally it refers to the Scriptures
associated with all of the Manifestations of God.

> The understanding of His words and the comprehension of the utterances of the
> Birds of Heaven are in no wise dependent upon human learning. They depend
> solely upon purity of heart, chastity of soul, and freedom of spirit. This is evidenced
> by those who, today, though without a single letter of the accepted standards of
> learning, are occupying the loftiest seats of knowledge; and the garden of their hearts
> is adorned, through the showers of divine grace, with the roses of wisdom and the
> tulips of understanding. Well is it with the sincere in heart for their share of the light
> of a mighty Day! (KI:211)

Human learning here refers to the human arts and sciences, and, in particular, to those
Islamic sciences which pertained to esoteric matters. The criteria and content of
divine knowledge and wisdom are set forth in the Tablets of Bahá‟u‟lláh, as well as in
the writings of „Abdu‟l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi.

> In fact, all the Scriptures and the mysteries thereof are condensed into this brief
> account. So much so, that were a person to ponder it a while in his heart, he would
> discover from all that hath been said the mysteries of the Words of God, and would
> apprehend the meaning of whatever hath been manifested by that ideal King.

> None apprehendeth the meaning of these utterances except them whose hearts are
> assured, whose souls have found favour with God, and whose minds are detached
> from all else but Him. (KI:255)

Bahá‟u‟lláh refers to this teaching in many of His Tablets, including in the following
passages from the Hidden Words and Seven Valleys:

> My first counsel is this: Possess a pure, kindly and radiant heart, that thine may be a
> sovereignty ancient, imperishable and everlasting. (AHW:#1)

> Thy heart is My home; sanctify it for My descent. Thy spirit is My place of
> revelation; cleanse it for My manifestation. (AHW:#59)

> It is incumbent on these servants that they cleanse the heart--which is the wellspring
> of divine treasures--from every marking, and that they turn away from imitation,
> which is following the traces of their forefathers and sires, and shut the door of
> friendliness and enmity upon all the people of the earth. (SV:5)

„Abdu‟l-Bahá, in the course of His Western tour, gave some addresses which
specifically touched upon this theme, one of which is cited here:

> It is easy to read the Holy Scriptures, but it is only with a clean heart and a pure
> mind that one may understand their true meaning. Let us ask God's help to enable
> us to understand the Holy Books. Let us pray for eyes to see and ears to hear, and
> for hearts that long for peace. (PT:56-57)

There are two kinds of verses in the Scriptures: those which are meant to be
understood literally, and those which are symbolic in nature. Bahá‟u‟lláh refers to this
theme in Kitáb-i-ĺqán:

> It is evident unto thee that the Birds of Heaven and Doves of Eternity speak a
> twofold language. One language, the outward language, is devoid of allusions, is
> unconcealed and unveiled; that it may be a guiding lamp and a beaconing light
> whereby wayfarers may attain the heights of holiness, and seekers may advance into
> the realm of eternal reunion. Such are the unveiled traditions and the evident verses
> already mentioned. (KI:254-255)

This passage refers to Súrat al-'Imrán (3:7) in the Qur‟án: "He it is Who has sent down
unto thee the Book; in it there are verses that are decisive in meaning [ayatun
muhkamatun] --they are the basis of the Book-- and there are others that are
susceptible of different interpretations [mutashabihatun]. But those in whose hearts is
perversity pursue such thereof as are susceptible of different interpretations, seeking
discord and seeking wrong interpretation of it. And none knows the right
interpretation except God and those who are firmly grounded in knowledge; they say,
'We believe in it; the whole is from our Lord.' And none heed except those gifted
with understanding." Bahá‟u‟lláh cites a verse of His own Book which is meant to be
interpreted literally, in Kitáb-i-Aqdas:

> Whoso layeth claim to a Revelation direct from God, ere the expiration of a full
> thousand years, such a man is assuredly a lying impostor…Whosoever interpreteth
> this verse otherwise than its obvious meaning is deprived of the Spirit of God and of

> His mercy which encompasseth all created things. Fear God, and follow not your
> idle fancies. (K37)

In Kitáb-i-ĺqán Bahá‟u‟lláh continues with a description of the second kind of
Scriptural language:

> The other language is veiled and concealed, so that whatever lieth hidden in the
> heart of the malevolent may be made manifest and their innermost being be
> disclosed. Thus hath Sadiq, son of Muhammad, spoken: "God verily will test them
> and sift them." This is the divine standard, this is the Touchstone of God,
> wherewith He proveth His servants. None apprehendeth the meaning of these
> utterances except them whose hearts are assured, whose souls have found favour
> with God, and whose minds are detached from all else but Him. In such utterances,
> the literal meaning, as generally understood by the people, is not what hath been
> intended. (KI:255)

There are many references in Kitáb-i-ĺqán to this symbolic language and to its role in
testing the hearts of men, a sampling of which are cited here:

> This is the purpose underlying the symbolic words of the Manifestations of
> God…Hence, it is clear and manifest that by the words "the sun shall be darkened,
> and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven" is
> intended the waywardness of the divines, and the annulment of laws firmly
> established by divine Revelation, all of which, in symbolic language, have been
> foreshadowed by the Manifestations of God. None except the righteous shall
> partake of this cup, none but the godly shall share therein. "The righteous shall
> drink of a cup tempered at the camphor fountain." [Qur‟án 76:5] (KI:41)

> Know verily that the purpose underlying all these symbolic terms and abstruse
> allusions, which emanate from the Revealers of God's holy Cause, hath been to test
> and prove the peoples of the world; that thereby the earth of the pure and illuminated
> hearts may be known from the perishable and barren soil. From time immemorial
> such hath been the way of God amidst His creatures, and to this testify the records of
> the sacred books. (KI:49)

> Yea, such things as throw consternation into the hearts of all men come to pass only
> that each soul may be tested by the touchstone of God, that the true may be known
> and distinguished from the false. (KI:52)

> But inasmuch as the divine Purpose hath decreed that the true should be known
> from the false, and the sun from the shadow, He hath, therefore, in every season sent
> down upon mankind the showers of tests from His realm of glory. (KI:53)

> Wert thou to cleanse the mirror of thy heart from the dust of malice, thou wouldst
> apprehend the meaning of the symbolic terms revealed by the all-embracing Word of
> God made manifest in every Dispensation, and wouldst discover the mysteries of
> divine knowledge. Not, however, until thou consumest with the flame of utter

> detachment those veils of idle learning, that are current amongst men, canst thou
> behold the resplendent morn of true knowledge. KI:68-69)

> Notwithstanding the warning which, in marvelously symbolic language and subtle
> allusions, hath been uttered in days past, and which was intended to awaken the
> peoples of the world and to prevent them from being deprived of their share of the
> billowing ocean of God's grace, yet such things as have already been witnessed have
> come to pass! (KI:75)

> The All-Glorious hath decreed these very things, that are contrary to the desires of
> wicked men, to be the touchstone and standard whereby He proveth His servants,
> that the just may be known from the wicked, and the faithful distinguished from the
> infidel. (KI:76; see KI:227,228)

> Little perception is required to enable them to gather from the symbolic language of
> these two verses all that We have purposed to propound, and thus to attain, through
> the grace of the All-Merciful, the resplendent morn of certitude. (KI:78)

„Abdu‟l-Bahá makes reference to the symbolic language of the Scriptures in one of
His talks in New York:

> I have been informed that the purpose of your class meeting is to study the
> significances and mysteries of the Holy Scriptures and understand the meaning of
> the divine Testaments. It is a cause of great happiness to me that you are turning
> unto the Kingdom of God, that you desire to approach the presence of God and to
> become informed of the realities and precepts of God. It is my hope that you may
> put forward your most earnest endeavor to accomplish this end, that you may
> investigate and study the Holy Scriptures word by word so that you may attain
> knowledge of the mysteries hidden therein. Be not satisfied with words, but seek to
> understand the spiritual meanings hidden in the heart of the words…The divine
> Words are not to be taken according to their outer sense. They are symbolical and
> contain realities of spiritual meaning…
> All the texts and teachings of the holy Testaments have intrinsic spiritual meanings.
> They are not to be taken literally. I, therefore, pray in your behalf that you may be
> given the power of understanding these inner real meanings of the Holy Scriptures
> and may become informed of the mysteries deposited in the words of the Bible so
> that you may attain eternal life and your hearts may be attracted to the Kingdom of
> God. May your souls be illumined by the light of the Words of God, and may you
> become repositories of the mysteries of God, for no comfort is greater and no
> happiness is sweeter than spiritual comprehension of the divine teachings.

(PUP:459-460)

How, then, are we to understand the symbolic language of Scripture? Do we only
need to purify our hearts--then will all of the inner meanings of this "other language"
become evident to us? Bahá‟u‟lláh affirms that our true guide in understanding these
symbolic verses of Scripture are the Manifestations of God. It is precisely so that we

do not turn in any direction except towards the Manifestations that He stresses the
importance of purity of heart, detachment of mind, and reflection.               The
Manifestation, and whomsoever the Manifestation may appoint as His successor and
interpreter, is the only divine authority able to unravel these inner meanings of the
symbolic language of Scripture:

> With fixed and steady gaze, born of the unerring eye of God, scan for a while the
> horizon of divine knowledge, and contemplate those words of perfection which the
> Eternal hath revealed, that haply the mysteries of divine wisdom, hidden ere now
> beneath the veil of glory and treasured within the tabernacle of His grace, may be
> made manifest unto you…
> It is obvious and manifest that the true meaning of the utterances of the Birds of
> Eternity is revealed to none except those that manifest the Eternal Being, and the
> melodies of the Nightingale of Holiness can reach no ear save that of the denizens of
> the everlasting realm…Even as He saith: 'None knoweth the meaning thereof except
> God and them that are well grounded in knowledge.' [Qur‟án 3:7] And yet, they
> have sought the interpretation of the Book from those that are wrapt in veils, and
> have refused to seek enlightenment from the fountainhead of knowledge. (KI:16-17)

This passage speaks both of those who attain to true knowledge, who are "those that
manifest the Eternal Being" and "the denizens of the everlasting realm", and of the
"fountainhead of knowledge", the Manifestation of God.

> In God We put our trust, and to Him We cry for help, that haply there may flow from
> this pen that which shall quicken the souls of men, that they may all arise from their
> beds of heedlessness and hearken unto the rustling of the leaves of Paradise, from
> the tree which the hand of divine power hath, by the permission of God, planted in
> the Ridvan of the All-Glorious. (KI:19-20)

The "pen" is that of Bahá‟u‟lláh, and "the tree which the hand of divine power hath,
by the permission of God, planted in the Ridvan of the All-Glorious" is Bahá‟u‟lláh
Himself.

> Make haste, O my brother, that while there is yet time our lips may taste of the
> immortal draught, for the breeze of life, now blowing from the city of the Well-
> Beloved, cannot last, and the streaming river of holy utterance must needs be stilled,
> and the portals of the Ridvan cannot for ever remain open. The day will surely come
> when the Nightingale of Paradise will have winged its flight away from its earthly
> abode unto its heavenly nest. Then will its melody be heard no more, and the beauty
> of the rose cease to shine. Seize the time, therefore, ere the glory of the divine
> springtime hath spent itself, and the Bird of Eternity ceased to warble its melody,
> that thy inner hearing may not be deprived of hearkening unto its call. This is My
> counsel unto thee and unto the beloved of God. (KI:23-24)

The "Nightingale of Paradise" and "Bird of Eternity" are references to His own
prophethood.

> And yet they bear witness to this well-known tradition: "Verily Our Word is abstruse,
> bewilderingly abstruse." In another instance, it is said: "Our Cause is sorely trying,
> highly perplexing; none can bear it except a favorite of heaven, or an inspired

> O my beloved! Immeasurably exalted is the celestial Melody above the strivings of

(KI, p. 168)

> Inasmuch as it hath been clearly shown that only those who are initiated into the
> divine mysteries can comprehend the melodies uttered by the Bird of Heaven, it is
> therefore incumbent upon every one to seek enlightenment from the illumined in

> Faith and the abstruse allusions in the utterances of the Day-springs of Holiness.
> Thus will these mysteries be unravelled, not by the aid of acquired learning, but
> solely through the assistance of God and the outpourings of His grace. "Ask ye,
> therefore, of them that have the custody of the Scriptures, if ye know it not."[Qur'án
> 16:43] (KI, pp. 191-192)

> The people, therefore, must not allow such utterances to deprive them of the divine
> bounties, but should rather seek enlightenment from them who are the recognized
> Expounders thereof, so that the hidden mysteries may be unravelled, and be made
> manifest unto them.
> We perceive none, however, amongst the people of the earth who, sincerely yearning
> for the Truth, seeketh the guidance of the divine Manifestations concerning the
> abstruse matters of his Faith. (KI, p. 255)

In Seven Valleys and also in Persian Hidden Words Bahá‟u‟lláh informs His reader
that the divine inspiration which flows from His pen will not be manifest indefinitely:

> O My friend, listen with heart and soul to the songs of the spirit, and treasure them
> as thine own eyes. For the heavenly wisdoms, like the clouds of spring, will not rain
> down on the earth of men's hearts forever; and though the grace of the All-

> Bounteous One is never stilled and never ceasing, yet to each time and era a portion
> is allotted and a bounty set apart, this in a given measure. "And no on thing is there,
> but with Us are its storehouses; and We send it not down but in settled measure."
> [Qur‟án 15:21] The cloud of the Loved One's mercy raineth only on the garden of the
> spirit, and bestoweth this bounty only in the season of spring. The other seasons
> have no share in this greatest grace, and barren lands no portion of this favor.
> O Brother! Not every sea hath pearls; not every branch will flower, nor will the
> nightingale sing thereon. Then, ere the nightingale of the mystic paradise repair to
> the garden of God, and the rays of the heavenly morning return to the Sun of Truth--
> make thou an effort, that haply in this dustheap of the mortal world thou mayest
> catch a fragrance from the everlasting garden, and live forever in the shadow of the
> peoples of this city. And when thou hast attained this highest station and come to
> this mightiest plane, then shalt thou gaze on the Beloved, and forget all else. (SV:37-

These two paragraphs make allusion to the divine springtime in which Bahá‟u‟lláh is
manifesting His prophethood. He calls Himself "the nightingale of the mystic
paradise" and the "city" is the Valley of True Poverty and Absolute Nothingness, the
seventh of the "Seven Valleys".

> The time cometh, when the nightingale of holiness will no longer unfold the inner
> mysteries and ye will all be bereft of the celestial melody and of the voice from on
> high. (PHW:#15)

Here Bahá‟u‟lláh refers to Himself as "the nightingale of holiness" who not only
reveals the "inner mysteries" but Who is the source of the "celestial melody" and the
"voice from on high"--the Voice of God amongst men. We continue now with the
passages in which Bahá‟u‟lláh clearly identifies the Manifestation of God as the source
of divine knowledge and the true interpretation of the Word of God in every Age:

> Had they sought with a humble mind from the Manifestations of God in every
> Dispensation the true meaning of these words revealed in the sacred books--words
> the misapprehension of which hath caused men to be deprived of the recognition of
> the Sadratu'l-Muntaha, the ultimate Purpose--they surely would have been guided to
> the light of the Sun of Truth, and would have discovered the mysteries of divine
> knowledge and wisdom. (KI:28)

The "Sadratu'l-Muntaha" and "Sun of Truth" are references to the new Manifestations
of God Who appear in every Age.

> Thus We instruct thee in the interpretation of the traditions, and reveal unto thee the
> mysteries of divine wisdom, that haply thou mayest comprehend the meaning
> thereof, and be of them that have quaffed the cup of divine knowledge and
> understanding. (KI:32-33)

Bahá‟u‟lláh has the authority to instruct His reader in the interpretation of these
symbolic verses, inasmuch as He is a Manifestation of God.

> Consider now, had the people of the Gospel recognized the meaning of the symbolic
> terms 'sun' and 'moon,' had they sought, unlike the forward and perverse,
> enlightenment from Him Who is the Revealer of divine knowledge, they would
> surely have comprehended the purpose of these terms, and would not have become
> afflicted and oppressed by the darkness of their selfish desires. Yea, but since they
> have failed to acquire true knowledge from its very Source, they have perished in the
> perilous vale of waywardness and misbelief. They still have not awakened to
> perceive that all the signs foretold have been made manifest, that the promised Sun
> hath risen above the horizon of divine Revelation, and that the 'sun' and 'moon' of
> the teachings, the laws, and learning of a former Dispensation have darkened and
> set. (KI:41-42)

The "Revealer of divine knowledge" and "its very Source" as well as "the promised
Sun" is the Manifestation of God.

> From the sayings of those Masters of holy utterance, Who have expounded the
> meaning of true knowledge, the odour of these dark teachings, which have obscured
> the world, can in no wise be detected. (KI:69)

The "Masters of holy utterance" are the Manifestations of God.

> Little perception is required to enable them to gather from the symbolic language of
> these two verses all that We have purposed to propound, and thus to attain, through
> the grace of the All-Merciful, the resplendent morn of certitude. Such are the strains
> of celestial melody which the immortal Bird of Heaven, warbling upon the Sadrih of
> Bahá, poureth out upon thee, that, by the permission of God, thou mayest tread the
> path of divine knowledge and wisdom. (KI:78)

The "Bird of Heaven" and "Sadrih of Bahá" (Tree of Splendour) are both references
to Bahá‟u‟lláh and to His prophetic station and "divine knowledge and wisdom."

> And yet they bear witness to this well-known tradition: "Verily Our Word is abstruse,
> bewilderingly abstruse." In another instance, it is said: "Our Cause is sorely trying,
> highly perplexing; none can bear it except a favorite of heaven, or an inspired
> Prophet, or he whose faith God hath tested." These leaders of religion admit that
> none of these three specified conditions is applicable to them. The first two
> conditions are manifestly beyond their reach; as to the third, it is evident that at no
> time have they been proof against those tests that have been sent by God, and that
> when the divine Touchstone appeared, they have shown themselves to be naught but
> dross. (KI:82-83)

> Yea, inasmuch as the peoples of the world have failed to seek from the luminous and
> crystal Springs of divine knowledge the inner meaning of God's holy words, they

> therefore have languished, stricken and sore athirst, in the vale of idle fancy and
> waywardness. (KI:105)

The Manifestations of God are the "luminous and crystal Springs of divine
knowledge".

> As they understood not the significance of these noble sayings, nor sought
> enlightenment from the recognized expounders of the Faith, that these might confer
> a sprinkling of the Kawthar of divine knowledge upon them, therefore such fires of
> mischief were kindled amongst men. (KI:122)

"The "recognized expounders of the Faith" are, in this case, the twelve Imams. If
they were the Manifestations of God, the Guardian would have capitalized
"Expounders".

> Inasmuch as these undiscerning and wretched souls have failed to apprehend the
> true meaning of "Resurrection" and of the "attainment unto the divine Presence,"
> they therefore have remained utterly deprived of the grace thereof. Although the sole
> and fundamental purpose of all learning, and the toil and labour thereof, is
> attainment unto, and the recognition of, this station, yet they are all immersed in the
> pursuit of their material studies. They deny themselves every moment of leisure, and
> utterly ignore Him, Who is the Essence of all learning, and the one Object of their
> quest. Methinks, their lips have never touched the cup of divine Knowledge, nor do
> they seem to have attained even a dewdrop of the showers of heavenly grace.

The Manifestation of God is "Him, who is the Essence of all learning, and the one
Object of their quest."

> Those words uttered by the Luminaries of Truth must needs be pondered, and
> should their significance be not grasped, enlightenment should be sought from the
> Trustees of the depositories of Knowledge, that these may expound their meaning,
> and unravel their mystery. For it behooveth no man to interpret the holy words
> according to his own imperfect understanding, nor, having found them to be
> contrary to his inclination and desires, to reject and repudiate the truth. For such,
> today, is the manner of the divines and doctors of the age, who occupy the seats of
> knowledge and learning, and who have named ignorance knowledge, and called
> oppression justice. Were these to ask the Light of Truth concerning those images
> which their idle fancy hath carved, and were they to find His answer inconsistent
> with their own conceptions and their own understanding of the Book, they would
> assuredly denounce Him Who is the Mine and Wellhead of all Knowledge as the very
> negation of understanding. Such things have happened in every age. (KI:181-182)

The "Luminaries of Truth" and "Trustees of the depositories of Knowledge" as well
as the "Light of Truth" and "Him Who is the Mine and Wellhead of all Knowledge"
are all references to the Manifestation of God.

> Should a touchstone be found, however, it would instantly distinguish truth from
> falsehood, light from darkness, and sun from shadow. (KI:189)

The "touchstone" is defined in earlier-cited passages as the Word of God, and, in
particular, the symbolic verses of the Word.

> Would that this unlearned and humble Servant, who never laid any pretension to
> such things, nor even regarded them as the criterion of true knowledge, might
> undertake the same task, that thereby the truth might be known and distinguished
> from falsehood. But of what avail! All this generation could offer Us were wounds
> from its darts, and the only cup it proferred to Our lips was the cup of its venom. On
> Our neck We still bear the scar of chains, and upon Our body are imprinted the
> evidences of an unyielding cruelty. (KI:189-190)

> O my brother! A divine Mine only can yield the gems of divine knowledge, and the
> fragrance of the mystic Flower can be inhaled only in the ideal Garden, and the lilies
> of ancient wisdom can blossom nowhere except in the city of a stainless heart. "In a
> rich soil, its plants spring forth abundantly by permission of its Lord, and in that soil
> which is bad, they spring forth but scantily." [Qur‟án 7:57] Inasmuch as it hath
> been clearly shown that only those who are initiated into the divine mysteries can
> comprehend the melodies uttered by the Bird of Heaven, it is therefore incumbent
> upon every one to seek enlightenment from the illumined in heart and from the
> Treasuries of divine mysteries regarding the intricacies of God's Faith and the
> abstruse allusions in the utterances of the Daysprings of Holiness. Thus will these
> mysteries be unravelled, not by the aid of acquired learning, but solely through the
> assistance of God and the outpourings of His grace. "Ask ye, therefore, of them that
> have the custody of the Scriptures, if ye know it not." [Qur‟án 16:43] (KI:191-192)

The Manifestation of God is a "divine Mine", "the mystic Flower", "the Bird of
Heaven", the "Treasuries of divine mysteries" and "Daysprings of Holiness."
Bahá‟u‟lláh indicates that the knowledge of the Manifestations of God is not
"acquired learning" and that it is attained "through the assistance of God and the
outpourings of His grace."

> To this testimony we both, as well as all the peoples of the world must cling, that
> through its light we may know and distinguish between truth and falsehood,
> guidance and error. Inasmuch as Muhammad hath confined His testimonies to His
> Book and to His Family, and whereas the latter hath passed away, there remaineth
> His Book only as His one testimony amongst the people. (KI:202)

In this passage, Bahá‟u‟lláh asserts that after the passing of the Manifestation of God,
it is His Book and His appointed successors which remain as the divine standard of
knowledge and wisdom. And upon the passing of His successors, there remains the
Book. He reiterates this point in Kitáb-i-Aqdas:

> Should differences arise amongst you over any matter, refer it to God while the Sun
> still shineth above the horizon of this Heaven and, when it hath set, refer ye to
> whatsoever hath been sent down by Him. This, verily, is sufficient unto the peoples
> of the world. (K53)

During His lifetime, all differences among believers must be referred to the
Manifestation of God, to Bahá‟u‟lláh Himself. After His passing, they must be
referred to His Book. And in His Book, He has indicated that whatever His followers
do not understand in the Book must be referred to His appointed successor:

> When the ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the Book of My Revelation is ended,
> turn your faces toward Him Whom God hath purposed, Who hath branched from
> this Ancient Root. (K121)

> When the Mystic Dove will have winged its flight from its Sanctuary of Praise and
> sought its far-off goal, its hidden habitation, refer ye whatsoever ye understand not in
> the Book to Him Who hath branched from this mighty Stock. (K174)

The capacity of the Manifestation to explain the inner meanings of the symbolic
verses of Scripture is limitless:

> Were We to expound its inner meanings and unfold its hidden mysteries, eternity
> would never suffice to exhaust their import, nor would the universe be capable of
> hearing them! God verily testifieth to the truth of Our saying! (KI:204)

> Even as thou dost witness how the people of the Qur‟án, like unto the people of old,
> have allowed the words "Seal of the Prophets" to veil their eyes. And yet, they
> themselves testify to this verse: "None knoweth the interpretation thereof but God
> and they that are well-grounded in knowledge." [Qur‟án 3:7] And when He Who is
> well-grounded in all knowledge, Who is the Mother, the Soul, the Secret, and the
> Essence thereof, revealeth that which is the least contrary to their desire, they bitterly
> oppose Him and shamelessly deny Him. (KI:213)

The Manifestation of God, in this case the Báb, is "He Who is well-grounded in all
knowledge, Who is the Mother, the Soul, the Secret, and the Essence thereof".

> For whatsoever hath come to pass, hath been prophesied by them who are the Mines
> of divine knowledge, and Recipients of God's eternal law. (KI:237)

The Manifestations are the "Mines of divine knowledge, and Recipients of God's
eternal law."

> We entreat the learned men of the Bayán not to follow in such ways, not to inflict, at
> the time of Mustaghath, upon Him Who is the divine Essence, the heavenly Light,
> the Absolute Eternity, the Beginning and the End of the Manifestations of the

> Invisible, that which hath been inflicted in this day. We beg them not to depend
> upon their intellect, their comprehension and learning, nor to contend with the
> Revealer of celestial and infinite knowledge. (KI:248)

In the Persian Bayán of the Báb, He states that His successor, "Him Whom God shall
make manifest" will appear before the time of "Mustaghath". This word, being
rendered into numbers through gematria (called abjad, hurufat and jafar in Arabic)
comes to 2001. Hence, "Him Who is the divine Essence, the heavenly Light, the
Absolute Eternity, the Beginning and the End of the Manifestations of the Invisible"
and the "Revealer of celestial and infinite knowledge" is non other than "Him Whom
God shall make manifest"--the Promised One of the Báb.

> None apprehendeth the meaning of these utterances except them whose
> hearts are assured, whose souls have found favour with God, and whose
> minds are detached from all else but Him. In such utterances, the literal
> meaning, as generally understood by the people, is not what hath been
> intended. Thus it is recorded: 'Every knowledge hath seventy meanings, of
> which one only is known amongst the people [the literal one]. And when the
> Qa'im shall arise, He shall reveal unto men all that which remaineth [all of
> the symbolic meanings].' He also saith: 'We speak one word, and by it we
> intend one and seventy meanings; each one of these meanings we can
> explain.' (KI:255)

While the first portion of this citation is familiar to us, as it refers to the spiritual
requirements of those who aspire to understand the symbolic verses, the second
portion refers to the divine knowledge of the Manifestations of God. Only the
Manifestations are capable of explaining these esoteric meanings. The first quotation
cited by Bahá‟u‟lláh refers to the Qa'im, and He is the first Promised One of Islam,
and a Manifestation of God according to Bahá‟u‟lláh. The second quotation is voiced
by Muhammad, and as such refers to the capacity of the Manifestations to explain the
myriad inner meanings of the symbolic verses of Scripture.

> The people, therefore, must not allow such utterances to deprive them of the divine
> bounties, but should rather seek enlightenment from them who are the recognized
> Expounders thereof, so that the hidden mysteries may be unravelled, and be made
> manifest unto them. We perceive none, however, amongst the people of the earth
> who, sincerely yearning for the Truth, seeketh the guidance of the divine
> Manifestations concerning the abstruse matters of his Faith. All are dwellers in the
> land of oblivion, and all are followers of the people of wickedness and rebellion. God
> will verily do unto them that which they themselves are doing, and will forget them
> even as they have ignored His Presence in His day. (KI:256)

The "recognized Expounders" are the "divine Manifestations".

> Know assuredly that just as thou firmly believest that the Word of God, exalted be
> His glory, endureth for ever, thou must, likewise, believe with undoubting faith that
> its meaning can never be exhausted. They who are its appointed interpreters, they
> whose hearts are the repositories of its secrets, are, however, the only ones who can
> comprehend its manifold wisdom. (GL:LXXXIX:176)

In this passage from "Tafsir Súrat va'l-Shams" Bahá‟u‟lláh affirms that true
interpretation of the symbolic language of Scripture can only be effected by those
"who are its appointed interpreters". Inasmuch as the Guardian has not capitalized
"interpreters" it seems to refer to the chosen ones of the Manifestations of God, the
twelve Imams in the Dispensation of Muhammad, and „Abdu‟l-Bahá and Shoghi
Effendi in the Dispensation of Bahá‟u‟lláh.

To conclude, the divine knowledge of the Manifestation of God is wholly
independent of the approval of humanity. He delivers His message, and each human
being is free to accept or reject that message, and neither its acceptance nor its
rejection can deter the Manifestation from saying and doing what He is sent by God
to say and do:

> This is My counsel unto thee and unto the beloved of God. Whosoever wisheth, let
> him turn thereunto; and whosoever wisheth, let him turn away. God, verily, is
> independent of him and of that which he may see and witness. (KI:24)

> We have shown thee these two ways; walk thou the way thou choosest. This verily is
> the truth, and after truth there remaineth naught but error. (KI:221)

> Thus doth the Nightingale utter His call unto you from this prison. He hath but to
> deliver this clear message. Whosoever desireth, let him turn aside from this counsel
> and whosoever desireth let him choose the path to his Lord. (Tablet of Ahmad,
> BP:210-211)

> This Wronged One calleth aloud for the sake of God. Whosoever wisheth, let him
> turn thereunto; whosever wisheth, let him turn away. Verily God can well afford to
> dispense with all things, whether of the past or of the future. (Tarazát, TB:41)

> We exhort, wholly for the sake of God, His servants. Let him who wisheth turn unto
> Him, and him who wisheth turn aside. Our Lord, the Merciful, is verily the All-
> Sufficing, the All-Praised. (Lawh-i-Burhan, TB:211)

> Truly this Wronged One desireth not to demonstrate His Own Cause with proofs
> produced by others. He is the One Who embraceth all things, while all else besides
> Him is circumscribed. Say, O people, peruse that which is current amongst you and
> We will peruse what pertaineth unto Us. I swear by God! Neither the praise of the
> peoples of the world, nor the things that the kindreds of the earth possess are worthy
> of mention before the remembrance of His Name. Unto this beareth witness He
> Who under all conditions proclaimeth, 'Verily He is God, the sovereign Ruler of the

> Day of Reckoning and the Lord of the Mighty Throne.' (Kalímát-i-Firdawsiyyih,
> TB:74)

> Who can ever believe that this Servant of God hath at any time cherished in His heart
> a desire for any earthly honor or benefit? The Cause associated with His Name is far
> above the transitory things of this world. Behold Him, an exile, a victim of tyranny,
> in this Most Great Prison. His enemies have assailed Him on every side, and will
> continue to do so till the end of His life. Whatever, therefore, He saith unto you is
> wholly for the sake of God, that haply the peoples of the earth may cleanse their
> hearts from the stain of evil desire, may rend it s veil asunder, and attain unto the
> knowledge of the one true God--the most exalted station to which any man can
> aspire. Their belief or misbelief in My Cause can neither profit nor harm Me. We
> summon them wholly for the sake of God. He, verily, can afford to dispense with all
> creatures. (GL:XXXV:85)

> We exhort, wholly for the sake of God, His servants. Let him who wisheth turn unto
> Him, and him who wisheth turn aside. (Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 97)

> Let him who wisheth turn thereunto, and let him who wisheth turn aside. (Epistle to
> the Son of the Wolf, pp. 110-111)

Not only is the Manifestation of God independent of the approval of humanity, but
He exhorts His followers to be independent as well:

> If your hearer respond, he will have responded to his own behoof, and if not, turn ye
> away from him, and set your faces towards God's sacred Court, the seat of
> resplendent holiness. (SUrat al-BayAn, GL:CXXVII:279)

> He would object within himself, voice protests, and would be among the
> rebellious.Such is the state of this people. Leave them unto themselves, saying: Unto
> you be that which ye desire and unto us that which we desire. Wretched indeed is
> the plight of the ungodly. (Suriy-i-Vafa, TB:186)

As general characterization of the Bahá‟í approach, we might conceptualize the
process of attainment to divine knowledge as composed of two sets of polarities. In
the "Lawh-i-Hikmat" (Tablet of Wisdom) Bahá‟u‟lláh writes:

> The world of existence came into being through the heat generated from the
> interaction between the active force and that which is its recipient. These two are
> the same, yet they are different. Thus doth the Great Announcement inform thee
> about this glorious structure. Such as communicate the generating influence as such
> as receive its impact are indeed created through the irresistible Word of God which is
> the Cause of the entire creation, while all else besides His Word are but the creatures
> and effects thereof. (TB:140)

Based upon this paradigm, we might see the Manifestation of God and His Revelation
as the "active force" and the "generating influence" and "Cause" and the human heart
as the "recipient", "such as receive" the "impact" of the "active force", and the
"creature" and effect of the "Word". The heart is in receptive mode, hence the need
for it to be purified, emptied, readied to receive. The Manifestation of God is in
active mode, hence the need for Him to speak and to write and to impress upon the
hearts His teachings and spiritual motivation for their realization, the Kingdom of
God on earth. This would represent one set of polarities. In order to become pure,
the heart must be purified, and this requires an "active force" and the application of
that force upon the heart. In order for the Manifestation of God to generate
influence, He must receive truth from God, that is, His heart must be receptive to the
truths revealed to Him. Hence, in the second set of polarities, the heart is "active"
and the Manifestation of God is "receptive". These two polarities seem to represent
the ideal relationship between the human heart and the Manifestation of God. The
actual relationship may not represent true polarity, and inasmuch as it is the polarity
which generates the "magnetic field", the attraction which binds the heart and the
Manifestation together, imperfect polarity may result in the estrangement of the heart
from the Manifestation. This represents a fundamental disequilibrium in the nature of
things, and it is this lack of authentic relationship and consequent disharmony which
is found in the fragmentation of the individual personality and of the community at all
levels. On the other hand, God has so designed the universe that human hearts are
granted freedom of choice. Hence, what appears to be dis-equilibrium and
disharmony actually embodies a higher and more inclusive equilibrium and harmony
which is inherent in the very structure of reality. Regardless of how the heart with
free will chooses to act, that choice is in harmony with the spiritual law which permits
free will to exist. The higher level equilibrium and harmony which represent the
potential and, in the course of progressive evolution, the future of humanity, requires
that these two polarities be balanced and functioning in an organic relationship.

III. The Study of Philosophy

The study of philosophy has been identified (#17) in the first essay as one of the
specific objectives of Bahá‟í scholarship. In order to elucidate the meaning intended
by this reference to philosophy, we will begin with a definition of terms as they are
used in the Bahá‟í source texts. „Abdu‟l-Bahá defines philosophy in Some Answered
Questions:

> Philosophy consists in comprehending the reality of things as they exist, according
> to the capacity and the power of man. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions,
> Chapter 59, p. 221)

And He reiterates that definition in one of His talks:

> Philosophy develops the mind. Christ and the Word of God are revealed through the
> Spirit. Plato says, “The mental conclusions are so and so.” Christ says, “Be led of the
> Spirit.” („Abdu‟l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 212)

In one of His Tablets to an American believer He writes:

> In the Tablets of His Holiness BAHÁ'ULLAH, there are many philosophic
> questions. For example, the Tablet of Wisdom, but it has not yet been translated. It
> may be found that his honor Fazel Mazindarani gave this Tablet to a Persian expert
> to translate into English. In His Tablets He has encouraged and rather urged (the
> people) to study philosophy. Therefore, in the religion of BAHÁ'ULLAH
> philosophy is highly esteemed.
> "As to life, however, it has had no beginning, nor will it have any end. The eternal
> grace of God has always been the cause of life. It has had no starting point and it
> will not approach any end. But concerning the degrees through which the soul has
> gone, these degrees are spiritual. Consider all the advancement of the word of
> humanity which is at present manifest and known. This has been realized through
> the spirit. The manifestation of the will of the Omnipotent, in the universe, means
> the manifestation of the divine laws and disciplines which are essential to the

„Abdu‟l-Bahá recommends that all be educated in philosophy:

> Among other teachings and principles Bahá‟u‟lláh counsels the education of all
> members of society. No individual should be denied or deprived of intellectual
> training, although each should receive according to capacity. None must be left in

Shoghi Effendi reiterated that point in one of the letters written by his secretary on
his behalf:

> It is hoped that all the Bahá‟í students will ... be led to investigate and analyze the
> principles of the Faith and to correlate them with the modern aspects of philosophy

In the Tablet of Wisdom and other Writings, Bahá‟u‟lláh indicates that the origin of
philosophy is not to be found in the Golden Age of the ancient Greeks, but in the
Prophets of God:

> The sages aforetime acquired their knowledge from the Prophets, inasmuch as the
> latter were the Exponents of divine philosophy and the Revealers of heavenly
> mysteries. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Lawh-i-Hikmat, TB, pp. 144-145)

> The essence and the fundamentals of philosophy have emanated from the Prophets.

(Bahá‟u‟lláh, Lawh-i-Hikmat, in TB, p. 145)

He reiterates an Islamic tradition, that the father of philosophy was Idris, called a
prophet in the Qur‟án (19:56-57). He identifies Idris with Hermes, considered the
founder of philosophy in the Hermetic tradition:

> „The first person who devoted himself to philosophy was Idris. Thus was he named.
> Some called him also Hermes. In every tongue he hath a special name. He it is who
> hath set forth in every branch of philosophy thorough and convincing statements.
> After him Balinus derived his knowledge and sciences from the Hermetic Tablets
> and most of the philosophers who followed him made their philosophical and
> scientific discoveries from his words and statements...‟ (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Lawh al-Basit
> al-Haqiqa; cited in TB, Note 1, p. 148)

> …the theories put forward by the Father of Philosophy regarding the mysteries of
> creation as given in his chrysolite tablets… (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Lawh-i-Hikmat, in TB, p.

> While it may be surmised that in its origins, philosophy was integrated, inasmuch as
> the Father of Philosophy “set forth in every branch of philosophy thorough and
> convincing statements,” philosophy was at some point differentiated into two
> branches. In some of His talks He refers to these two branches of the primordial

In another talk, He refers to the two kinds of philosophy as two kinds of sciences:

> Scientific knowledge is the highest attainment upon the human plane, for science is the
> discoverer of realities. It is of two kinds: material and spiritual. Material science is the
> investigation of natural phenomena; divine science is the discovery and realization of

> and attainment. Both are necessary--one the natural, the other supernatural; one
> material, the other divine. By the divine we mean the discovery of the mysteries of God,
> the comprehension of spiritual realities, the wisdom of God, inner significances of the
> heavenly religions and foundation of the law. (Talk at the home of Mr. and Mrs.

Francis W. Breed, Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 23 May 1912; in PUP:138)

> Bahá‟u‟lláh taught that in all schools and colleges sciences, both divine and material,
> should be taught, in order that the students may discover material realities and the

Some philosophers have devoted themselves to both kinds of philosophy, the
material and the divine:

> The philosophers of Greece -- such as Aristotle, Socrates, Plato and others -- were
> devoted to the investigation of both natural and spiritual phenomena. In their
> schools of teaching they discoursed upon the world of nature as well as the

He points out that some philosophers, notably some amongst the ancient Greeks, and
many in the modern West, are materialists, and deny the existence of the spiritual:

> The people of the world are divided into two classes. One class is the materialistic
> philosophers who deny the spirit and it immortality. The second class comprises the
> divine philosophers the wise men of God, the wise illuminati. They believe in the
> spirit and its immortality. Some of the Greek philosophers declared man to consist

> Consequently, the philosophizers and wise men of God have said that it is firmly
> established that existing phenomena may be resolved into grades; that is to say, the

mineral, vegetable or animal kingdoms. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, Talk at the Theosophical
Society, Boston, on July 24, 1912; in SW IV:7, pp. 115-117; VII:7, pp. 85-86)

The philosophers of the world are divided into two classes: materialists, who deny
the spirit and its immortality, and the divine philosophers, the wise men of God, the
true illuminati who believe in the spirit and its continuance hereafter. The ancient
philosophers taught that man consists simply of the material elements which
compose his cellular structure and that when this composition is disintegrated the
life of man becomes extinct. They reasoned that man is body only, and from this
elemental composition the organs and their functions, the senses, powers and
attributes which characterize man have proceeded, and that these disappear
completely with the physical body. This is practically the statement of all the
materialists.
The divine philosophers proclaim that the spirit of man is ever-living and eternal,
and because of the objections of the materialists, these wise men of God have
advanced rational proofs to support the validity of their statement. Inasmuch as the
materialistic philosophers deny the Books of God, scriptural demonstration is not
evidence to them, and materialistic proofs are necessary. Answering them, the men
of divine knowledge have said that all existing phenomena may be resolved into
grades or kingdoms, classified progressively as mineral, vegetable, animal and
human… („Abdu‟l-Bahá, Talk at the Theosophical Society, Boston, on July 24, 1912;
in edited version, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 239)

In schools and temples of learning knowledge of the sciences acquired is based upon
material observations only; there is no realization of Divinity in their methods and
conclusions -- all have reference to the world of matter. They are not interested in
attaining knowledge of the mysteries of God or understanding the secrets of the
heavenly Kingdom; what they acquire is based altogether upon visible and tangible
evidences. Beyond these evidences they are without susceptibilities; they have no
idea of the world of inner significances and are utterly out of touch with God,
considering this an indication of reasonable attitude and philosophical judgment
whereof they are self-sufficient and proud.
As a matter of fact, this supposed excellence is possessed in its superlative degree by
the animals. The animals are without knowledge of God; so to speak, they are
deniers of Divinity and understand nothing of the Kingdom and its heavenly
mysteries. As deniers of the Kingdom, they are utterly ignorant of spiritual things
and uninformed of the supernatural world. Therefore, if it be a perfection and virtue
to be without knowledge of God and His Kingdom, the animals have attained the
highest degree of excellence and proficiency. Then the donkey is the greatest
scientist and the cow an accomplished naturalist, for they have obtained what they
know without schooling and years of laborious study in colleges, trusting implicitly
to the evidence of the senses and relying solely upon intuitive virtues. The cow, for
instance, is a lover of the visible and a believer in the tangible, contented and happy
when pasture is plenty, perfectly serene, a blissful exponent of the transcendental
school of philosophy. Such is the status of the material philosophers, who glory in
sharing the condition of the cow, imagining themselves in a lofty station. Reflect
upon their ignorance and blindness. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal
Peace, pp. 261-262)

> All the animals are materialists. They are deniers of God and without realization of a
> transcendent power in the universe. They have no knowledge of the divine Prophets
> and Holy Books -- mere captives of nature and the sense world. In reality they are
> like the great philosophers of this day who are not in touch with God and the Holy
> Spirit -- deniers of the Prophets, ignorant of spiritual susceptibilities, deprived of the
> heavenly bounties and without belief in the supernatural power. The animal lives this
> kind of life blissfully and untroubled, whereas the material philosophers labor and
> study for ten or twenty years in schools and colleges, denying God, the Holy Spirit
> and divine inspirations. The animal is even a greater philosopher, for it attains the
> ability to do this without labor and study. For instance, the cow denies God and the
> Holy Spirit, knows nothing of divine inspirations, heavenly bounties or spiritual
> emotions and is a stranger to the world of hearts. Like the philosophers, the cow is a
> captive of nature and knows nothing beyond the range of the senses. The
> philosophers, however, glory in this, saying, "We are not captives of superstitions; we
> have implicit faith in the impressions of the senses and know nothing beyond the
> realm of nature, which contains and covers everything." But the cow, without study
> or proficiency in the sciences, modestly and quietly views life from the same
> standpoint, living in harmony with nature's laws in the utmost dignity and nobility.

(„Abdu‟l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, pp. 311-312)

> Therefore, I have thought it expedient to discourse upon the subject of philosophy,

> The criterion of judgment in the estimation of western philosophers is sense

> reality—that there is no doubt of its existence. For example, we prove the existence
> of this light through the sense of sight; we visualize this room; we see the sun, the
> green fields; we use our sense of sight to observe them. The opinion of these

> standard of perception and judgment, in which there can neither be doubt nor

> deceived and mistaken. That which is liable to mistake cannot be infallible, cannot
> be a true standard of judgment… („Abdu‟l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal
> Peace, pp. 355-356)

He compares the approach of the Western materialist with that of the “philosophers
of the Orient” to the question of evolution, first summing up the Western
philosophical view and then turning to the Eastern philosophy:

> These statements and demonstrations express the substance of western philosophy
> upon the question of human evolution.
> The philosophers of the Orient in reply to those of the western world say… („Abdu‟l-
> Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 358)

These two philosophies, the Western and the Eastern, represent two criteria of human
judgment, namely empiricism and reason. In other talks and Tablets, which will be
discussed in my talk on Bahá‟í Epistemology, three other criteria are described and
compared with these two. Mirza Mahmud Zarqani was present at this talk, before the
Open Forum in San Francisco and he describes the event as follows:

> Another meeting was held at the Open Forum in San Francisco. Although the
> audience was composed mostly of philosophers and professors, they were all
> humbled by the talk. The Master's profound words contrasted the philosophy of the
> East with that of the West, elucidated the power beyond nature and explained the
> inherent distinction between mankind and other creatures. He concluded with the
> assertion that if philosophers believed that the highest perfection was not to believe
> in abstract and spiritual truth, it would be preferable to go to the cow, who, without
> any formal training, already had this attribute. When the Master uttered these words,
> everyone burst into laughter. This kind of humor, delivered in such a light-hearted
> manner, is popular and accepted by the Americans and so brought smiles and joy to
> the audience. At the conclusion of the Master's talk, when a philosopher stood up,
> several were heard to say to one another that the cow takes the lead in not believing
> in intellectual thought.

[http://Bahái-library.com/?file=zarqani_mahmuds_diary.html&chapter=8]

In this talk He critiqued the Western reliance upon the senses, that is upon empirical
standards for advancing human knowledge and development. In another talk He
referred to the same principle:

> In these days there are new schools of philosophy blindly claiming that the world of
> nature is perfect. If this is true, why are children trained and educated in schools, and
> what is the need of extended courses in sciences, arts and letters in colleges and
> universities? What would be the result if humanity were left in its natural condition
> without education or training? („Abdu‟l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace,

> That the forces of irreligion, of a purely materialistic philosophy, of unconcealed
> paganism have been unloosed, are now spreading, and, by consolidating themselves,
> are beginning to invade some of the most powerful Christian institutions of the
> western world, no unbiased observer can fail to admit. (From a letter written by the
> Guardian and dated 11 March 1936 to the Bahá‟ís of the West, published in The
> World Order of Bahá‟u‟lláh: Selected Letters, pp. 180-81)

„Abdu‟l-Bahá praised the benefits accruing from the development of science and
philosophy, but also critiqued the development of one wing of philosophy to the
neglect of the other wing:

> No matter how far the material world advances, it cannot establish the happiness of
> mankind. Only when material and spiritual civilization are linked and coordinated
> will happiness be assured. Then material civilization will not contribute its energies

to the forces of evil in destroying the oneness of humanity, for in material civilization
good and evil advance together and maintain the same pace. For example, consider
the material progress of man in the last decade. Schools and colleges, hospitals,
philanthropic institutions, scientific academies and temples of philosophy have been
founded, but hand in hand with these evidences of development, the invention and
production of means and weapons for human destruction have correspondingly
increased. In early days the weapon of war was the sword; now it is the magazine
rifle. Among the ancients, men fought with javelins and daggers; now they employ
shells and bombs. Dreadnoughts are built, torpedoes invented, and every few days
new ammunition is forthcoming. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal
Peace, p. 109)

The teacher of material principles is limited. The philosophers who claimed to be the
educators of mankind were at most only able to train themselves. If they educated
others, it was within a restricted circle; they failed to bestow general education and
development. This has been conferred upon humanity by the power of the Holy
Spirit.
For example, Christ educated and developed mankind universally. He rescued
nations and peoples from the bondage of superstition and idolatry. He summoned
them all to the knowledge of the oneness of God. They were dark, they became
illumined; they were material, they became spiritual; earthly they were, they became
heavenly. He enlightened the world of morality. This general, universal development
is not possible through the power of philosophy. It is only attainable through the
pervading influence of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, no matter how far the world of
humanity advances, it fails to attain the highest degree unless quickened by the
education and divine bestowals of the Holy Spirit. This ensures human progress and
prosperity. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, pp. 205-206)

It is my hope that you may be the means of changing this wild jungle of materialism
into a fruitful orchard, this thorny thicket into a rose garden. May Europe become
the divine university wherein heavenly sciences and divine arts are taught and
learned! By heavenly sciences I mean divine philosophy and spiritual teachings; by
the songs and fragrances of the rose garden I mean the mysteries of the kingdom of
kingdoms, the secrets of the degrees of existence and the knowledge of the results of
human life. This universe is not created through the fortuitous concurrences of
atoms; it is created by a great law which decrees that the tree bring forth certain
definite fruit. Verily, this universe contains many worlds of which we know nothing.
Is the materialistic philosophy of this Europe, so much praised by contemporary
agnostics and atheists, a philosophy to be admired? Are these people wooers of the
spirit? Nay, they have drowned that capacity and are out of touch with the kingdom
of reality. Is this an enviable goal to which humanity may aspire? Is this a system of
philosophy through which people may become glorified? No, by God, the
philosophy of glory needs no scholastic curriculum.
Strive so that these people may be released from their nature worship and become
like sons of wisdom from the city of light. We speak one word and by it we intend
one and seventy meanings. (BAHÁ‟O‟LLAH IN THE IGHAN) („Abdu‟l-Bahá on
Divine Philosophy, pp. 139-141)

I have cited a number of passages which refer to divine sciences, spiritual sciences and
divine philosophy. But what do these terms mean? The material sciences and
material philosophies are well known to us, but we don't know how to identify the
other wing. „Abdu‟l-Bahá helps us by describing divine philosophy in some of His
talks:

> Some one has asked this question, “What are the proofs through which one can
> establish the existence of God?”
> Humanity is divided into two classes:—one is satisfied with the knowledge of
> divinity through its attributes and the other strives to understand the mysteries of
> divinity and be informed of the fundamental principles of divine philosophy. I will
> speak to you of the scientific proofs which establish the existence of God and I will
> not quote the scriptural proofs from the Old and New Testaments, or the Koran, with
> which you are more or less familiar. („Abdu‟l-Bahá on Divine Philosophy, pp. 103-

> Material virtues have attained great development, but ideal virtues have been left far

> pp. 326-327, 328)

While „Abdu‟l-Bahá honors the contributions of philosophers, He also sets forth the
limitations of philosophy:

> The influence of the wisest philosophers, without this Spirit Divine, has been
> comparatively unimportant, however extensive their learning and deep their
> scholarship.
> The unusual intellects, for instance, of Plato, Aristotle, Pliny and Socrates, have not
> influenced men so greatly that they have been anxious to sacrifice their lives for their
> teachings; whilst some of those simple men so moved humanity that thousands of
> men have become willing martyrs to uphold their words; for these words were
> inspired by the Divine Spirit of God! The prophets of Judah and Israel, Elijah,
> Jeremiah, Isaiah and Ezekiel, were humble men, as were also the apostles of Jesus
> Christ. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, Paris Talks, p. 164)

> The greatest philosophers without this Spirit are powerless, their souls lifeless, their
> hearts dead! Unless the Holy Spirit breathes into their souls, they can do no good
> work. No system of philosophy has ever been able to change the manners and
> customs of a people for the better. Learned philosophers, unenlightened by the
> Divine Spirit, have often been men of inferior morality; they have not proclaimed in
> their actions the reality of their beautiful phrases.

The difference between spiritual philosophers and others is shown by their lives. The
Spiritual Teacher shows His belief in His own teaching, by Himself being what He
recommends to others. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, Paris Talks, p. 165)

The will of every sovereign prevaileth during his reign, the will of every philosopher
findeth expression in a handful of disciples during his lifetime, but the Power of the
Holy Spirit shineth radiantly in the realities of the Messengers of God, and
strengtheneth Their will in such wise as to influence a great nation for thousands of
years and to regenerate the human soul and revive mankind. Consider how great is
this power! It is an extraordinary Power, an all-sufficient proof of the truth of the
mission of the Prophets of God, and a conclusive evidence of the power of Divine
Inspiration. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, Tablet to August Forel, pp. 27-28)

In reality they are like the great philosophers of this day who are not in touch with
God and the Holy Spirit—deniers of the Prophets, ignorant of spiritual
susceptibilities, deprived of the heavenly bounties and without belief in the
supernatural power. The animal lives this kind of life blissfully and untroubled,
whereas the material philosophers labor and study for ten or twenty years in schools
and colleges, denying God, the Holy Spirit and divine inspirations. The animal is
even a greater philosopher, for it attains the ability to do this without labor and study.
For instance, the cow denies God and the Holy Spirit, knows nothing of divine
inspirations, heavenly bounties or spiritual emotions and is a stranger to the world of
hearts. Like the philosophers, the cow is a captive of nature and knows nothing
beyond the range of the senses. The philosophers, however, glory in this, saying,
“We are not captives of superstitions; we have implicit faith in the impressions of the
senses and know nothing beyond the realm of nature, which contains and covers
everything.” But the cow, without study or proficiency in the sciences, modestly and
quietly views life from the same standpoint, living in harmony with nature‟s laws in
the utmost dignity and nobility. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal
Peace, pp. 311-312)

Teachers are of two kinds: universal and special. The universal Instructors are the
Prophets of God, and the special teachers are the philosophers. The philosophers are
capable of educating and training a limited circle of human souls, whereas the holy,
divine Manifestations of God confer general education upon humanity. („Abdu‟l-
Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, pp. 400-401)

The philosophers of old had the strongest resolve to improve human morals and
strove to the utmost in this regard, but at most they succeeded in refining their own
characters, not the virtues of all mankind. Refer to history and you will find that this
is clear and evident. But the power of the Holy Spirit brings forth the universal
virtues with which man is potentially endowed, illuminates the human world,
bestows true exaltation, and trains all people. Thus, the well-wishers of the world
must endeavor to attract by this attractive power the confirmations of the Holy Spirit.

Bahá‟u‟lláh considers those philosophers who believe in God to be superior to those
who do not:

> Verily, the philosophers have not denied the Ancient of Days. Most of them passed
> away deploring their failure to fathom His mystery, even as some of them have
> testified. Verily, thy Lord is the Adviser, the All-Informed. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Lawh-i-

> souls of men. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá‟u‟lláh, p. 157)

While „Abdu‟l-Bahá praises both kinds of philosophy, He favors the conclusions of
the divine philosophers over those of the material philosophers:

> Now concerning philosophers, they are of two schools. Thus Socrates the wise
> believed in the unity of God and the existence of the soul after death; as his opinion

(„Abdu‟l-Bahá, Tablet to August Forel, pp. 13-14)

> The philosophers of the world are divided into two classes: materialists, who deny
> the spirit and its immortality, and the divine philosophers, the wise men of God, the
> true illuminati who believe in the spirit and its continuance hereafter…The divine
> philosophers proclaim that the spirit of man is ever-living and eternal, and because

of the objections of the materialists, these wise men of God have advanced rational
proofs to support the validity of their statement. Inasmuch as the materialistic
philosophers deny the Books of God, scriptural demonstration is not evidence to
them, and materialistic proofs are necessary. Answering them, the men of divine
knowledge have said that all existing phenomena may be resolved into grades or
kingdoms, classified progressively as mineral, vegetable, animal and human, each of
which possesses its degree of function and intelligence. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, The
Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 240)

Consequently, the materialistic philosophers consider the criterion of the senses to
be first and foremost.
But in the estimation of the divine philosophers this proof and assurance is not
reliable; nay, rather, they deem the standard of the senses to be false because it is
imperfect. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 253)

The materialists hold to the opinion that the world of nature is complete. The divine
philosophers declare that the world of nature is incomplete. There is a wide
difference between the two. The materialists call attention to the perfection of nature,
the sun, moon and stars, the trees in their adornment, the whole earth and the sea—
even unimportant phenomena revealing the most perfect symmetry. The divine
philosophers deny this seeming perfection and completeness in nature‟s kingdom,
even though admitting the beauty of its scenes and aspects and acknowledging the
irresistible cosmic forces which control the colossal suns and planets. („Abdu‟l-Bahá,
The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 329)

The philosophers of the East consider the perfect criterion to be reason or intellect,
and according to that standard the realities of all objects can be proved; for, they say,
the standard of reason and intellect is perfect, and everything provable through
reason is veritable. Therefore, those philosophers consider all philosophical
deductions to be correct when weighed according to the standard of reason, and they
state that the senses are the assistants and instruments of reason, and that although
the investigation of realities may be conducted through the senses, the standard of
knowing and judgment is reason itself. In this way the philosophers of the East and
West differ and disagree. The materialistic philosophers of the West declare that man
belongs to the animal kingdom, whereas the philosophers of the East—such as
Plato, Aristotle and the Persians—divide the world of existence or phenomena of life
into two general categories or kingdoms: one the animal kingdom, or world of
nature, the other the human kingdom, or world of reason. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, The
Promulgation of Universal Peace, pp. 356-357)

Some men and women glory in their exalted thoughts, but if these thoughts never
reach the plane of action they remain useless: the power of thought is dependent on
its manifestation in deeds. A philosopher‟s thought may, however, in the world of
progress and evolution, translate itself into the actions of other people, even when
they themselves are unable or unwilling to show forth their grand ideals in their own
lives. To this class the majority of philosophers belong, their teachings being high
above their actions. This is the difference between philosophers who are Spiritual
Teachers, and those who are mere philosophers: the Spiritual Teacher is the first to

> follow His own teaching; He brings down into the world of action His spiritual
> conceptions and ideals. His Divine thoughts are made manifest to the world. His
> thought is Himself, from which He is inseparable. When we find a philosopher
> emphasizing the importance and grandeur of justice, and then encouraging a
> rapacious monarch in his oppression and tyranny, we quickly realize that he belongs
> to the first class: for he thinks heavenly thoughts and does not practice the
> corresponding heavenly virtues.
> This state is impossible with Spiritual Philosophers, for they ever express their high
> and noble thoughts in actions. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, Paris Talks, p. 18)

> Consequently, the great divine philosophers have had the following epigram: All
> things are involved in all things. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, in Foundations of World Unity
> (Wilmette: Bahá‟í Publishing Trust, 1972), pp. 51-52; in Letters, 1992 June 08, Gaia
> Concept, Nature, p. 5)

> Is the materialistic philosophy of this Europe, so much praised by contemporary
> agnostics and atheists, a philosophy to be admired? Are these people wooers of the

> Divine Philosophy, pp. 116-141)

Why would „Abdu‟l-Bahá favor divine philosophers and philosophers of the East over
material philosophers and philosophers of the West? Does He regard all philosophers
of the West to be materialists?

> We must not take many of „Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s statements as dogmatic finalities, for there

> very spiritual in their concepts.... (From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi,
> dated 7 June 1946; published in Arohanui - Letters to New Zealand, p. 88)

„Abdu‟l-Bahá likewise asserts that the revelation of Bahá‟u‟lláh is a higher and more
complete standard of truth than is found in the scientists and philosophers:

> Bahá'u'lláh says, "The universe hath neither beginning nor ending." He has set
> aside the elaborate theories and exhaustive opinions of scientists and material
> philosophers by the simple statement, "There is no beginning, no ending." The
> theologians and religionists advance plausible proofs that the creation of the universe

> dates back six thousand years; the scientists bring forth indisputable facts and say,
> "No! These evidences indicate ten, twenty, fifty thousand years ago," etc. There are
> endless discussions pro and con. Bahá'u'lláh sets aside these discussions by one
> word and statement. He says, "The divine sovereignty hath no beginning and no
> ending." By this announcement and its demonstration He has established a
> standard of agreement among those who reflect upon this question of divine
> sovereignty; He has brought reconciliation and peace in this war of opinion and
> discussion. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 220)

No, not all Western philosophers are materialists…but those Western philosophers
who have adhered to the standard of the senses, to empiricism are limited in the
scope of their awareness of reality, for reality has spiritual as well as material
dimensions, dimensions which can not be perceived by the senses as well as
dimensions which can be perceived by the senses. What do divine philosophers,
philosophers from the East have access to which material Western philosophers
deny? Consider the origins, the foundations, the fundamentals, the essentials of
divine philosophy, as described by Bahá‟u‟lláh and „Abdu‟l-Bahá:

> The sages aforetime acquired their knowledge from the Prophets, inasmuch as the
> latter were the Exponents of divine philosophy and the Revealers of heavenly
> mysteries. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Lawh-i-Hikmat, TB, pp. 144-145)

> The essence and the fundamentals of philosophy have emanated from the Prophets.

(Bahá‟u‟lláh, Lawh-i-Hikmat, in TB, p. 145)

> …the theories put forward by the Father of Philosophy regarding the mysteries of
> creation as given in his chrysolite tablets… (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Lawh-i-Hikmat, in TB, p.

> „The first person who devoted himself to philosophy was Idris. Thus was he named.
> Some called him also Hermes. In every tongue he hath a special name. He it is who
> hath set forth in every branch of philosophy thorough and convincing statements.
> After him Balinus derived his knowledge and sciences from the Hermetic Tablets
> and most of the philosophers who followed him made their philosophical and
> scientific discoveries from his words and statements...‟ (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Lawh al-Basit
> al-Haqiqa; cited in Tablets of Bahá‟u‟lláh, Note 1, p. 148)

In keeping with the principle set forth in “Lawh-i-Hikmat”, that "the essence and the
fundamentals of philosophy have emanated from the Prophets", the Guardian
reiterates that point, writing, "Nor should a review of the outstanding features of
Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s writings during the latter part of His banishment to „Akká fail to include
a reference to the “Lawh-i-Hikmat” (Tablet of Wisdom), in which He sets forth the
fundamentals of true philosophy…" (Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p. 219)

The "essence and fundamentals" of divine philosophy in the Bahá‟í Dispensation and
Cycle may be considered therefore to have "emanated from" Bahá‟u‟lláh and His
chosen ones. In Kitáb-i-ĺqán, Bahá‟u‟lláh refers to the principle of progressive
revelation and applies it to His own Book:

> That city is none other than the Word of God revealed in every age and dispensation.
> In the days of Moses it was the Pentateuch; in the days of Jesus the Gospel; in the
> days of Muhammad the Messenger of God the Qur‟án; in this day the Bayan; and in
> the dispensation of Him Whom God will make manifest His own Book—the Book
> unto which all the Books of former Dispensations must needs be referred, the Book
> which standeth amongst them all transcendent and supreme.       (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Kitáb-
> i-ĺqán, pp. 199-200)

In the Most Holy Book of Bahá‟u‟lláh, He advises the leaders of religion, and beyond
them all of humanity:

> Weigh not the Book of God with such standards and sciences as are current amongst
> you, for the Book itself is the unerring Balance established amongst men. In this
> most perfect Balance whatsoever the peoples and kindreds of the earth possess must
> be weighed, while the measure of its weight should be tested according to its own
> standard, did ye but know it. (K99)

In another of His Tablets He writes: "Weigh it with the just Balance that ye possess,
the Balance of the testimony of the Prophets and Messengers of God." (Bahá‟u‟lláh,
Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá‟u‟lláh, p. 281) If the "Book of God", the
"testimony of the Prophets and Messengers of God" is the "most perfect Balance",
the "just Balance" then surely the Book of Bahá‟u‟lláh, "the Book unto which all the
Books of former Dispensations must needs be referred, the Book which standeth
amongst them all transcendent and supreme" is the superlative Balance. Hence, we
may look to His Book as the source for the divine philosophy of the present and
future alike.    Indeed, the Guardian has written that, in the “Lawh-i-Hikmat”,
Bahá‟u‟lláh "sets forth the fundamentals of true philosophy" (God Passes By, p. 219).

Bahá‟u‟lláh indicates that the Prophets of God "speak a twofold language"
(Bahá‟u‟lláh, Kitáb-i-ĺqán, p. 254). "One language, the outward language, is devoid of
allusions, is unconcealed and unveiled; that it may be a guiding lamp and a beaconing
light whereby wayfarers may attain the heights of holiness, and seekers may advance
into the realm of eternal reunion." (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Kitáb-i-ĺqán, pp. 254-255) While
this "outward language" prescribes specific counsels and commandments meant to
serve as the foundations of human belief and behavior, "the other language is veiled
and concealed" (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Kitáb-i-ĺqán, p. 255) and no one "apprehendeth the
meaning of these utterances except them whose hearts are assured, whose souls have
found favour with God, and whose minds are detached from all else but Him. In such

utterances, the literal meaning, as generally understood by the people, is not what hath
been intended." (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Kitáb-i-ĺqán, p. 255) Furthermore, "if the Sun of Truth
were suddenly to reveal, at the earliest stages of its manifestation, the full measure of
the potencies which the providence of the Almighty hath bestowed upon it, the earth
of human understanding would waste away and be consumed; for men‟s hearts would
neither sustain the intensity of its revelation, nor be able to mirror forth the radiance
of its light. Dismayed and overpowered, they would cease to exist." (Bahá‟u‟lláh,
Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá‟u‟lláh, XXXVÍI, p. 87)

> It hath been decreed by Us that the Word of God and all the potentialities thereof
> shall be manifested unto men in strict conformity with such conditions as have been
> foreordained by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have, moreover,
> ordained that its veil of concealment be none other except its own Self. Such indeed
> is Our Power to achieve Our Purpose. Should the Word be allowed to release
> suddenly all the energies latent within it, no man could sustain the weight of so
> mighty a Revelation. Nay, all that is in heaven and on earth would flee in
> consternation before it.
> Consider that which hath been sent down unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God. The
> measure of the Revelation of which He was the bearer had been clearly foreordained
> by Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. They that heard Him, however, could
> apprehend His purpose only to the extent of their station and spiritual capacity. He,
> in like manner, uncovered the Face of Wisdom in proportion to their ability to
> sustain the burden of His Message. No sooner had mankind attained the stage of
> maturity, than the Word revealed to men‟s eyes the latent energies with which it had
> been endowed—energies which manifested themselves in the plenitude of their glory
> when the Ancient Beauty appeared, in the year sixty, in the person of Ali-
> Muhammad, the Báb. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá‟u‟lláh,
> XXXÍI, pp. 76-77)

The revelation of truth is gradual according to the development of mankind, and
while the overall process of that development is progressive and inexorable, the pace
of the unfolding is not. Bahá‟u‟lláh writes:

> We now perceive that veils thicker than the ones We have already torn asunder have
> intervened, obstructing the vision and causing the light of understanding to be
> obscured." (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Tarazát, in TB, p. 41)

> It was intended that at the time of the manifestation of the One true God the faculty
> of recognizing Him would have been developed and matured and would have
> reached its culmination. However, it is now clearly demonstrated that in the
> disbelievers this faculty hath remained undeveloped and hath, indeed, degenerated.

(Bahá‟u‟lláh, Tajallíyát, in TB, pp. 52-53)

> This humble servant is filled with wonder, inasmuch as all men are endowed with the
> capacity to see and hear, yet we find them deprived of the privilege of using these
> faculties. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Lawh-i-Maqsud, in TB, p. 171)

> Methinks people's sense of taste hath, alas, been sorely affected by the fever of
> negligence and folly, for they are found to be wholly unconscious and deprived of the
> sweetness of His utterance. How regrettable indeed that man should debar himself
> from the fruits of the tree of wisdom while his days and hours pass swiftly away.

(Bahá‟u‟lláh, Lawh-i-Maqsud, in TB, pp. 173-174)

The Guardian reiterated this principle in one of his letters:

> Yet, if we but call to mind the practice generally adopted by „Abdu‟l-Bahá, we cannot
> fail to perceive the wisdom, nay the necessity, of gradually and cautiously disclosing
> to the eyes of an unbelieving world the implications of a Truth which, by its own
> challenging nature, it is so difficult for it to comprehend and embrace.
> It was He, our beloved „Abdu‟l-Bahá, our true and shining Exemplar, who with
> infinite tact and patience, whether in His public utterances or in private converse,
> adapted the presentation of the fundamentals of the Cause to the varying capacities
> and the spiritual receptiveness of His hearers. He never hesitated, however, to tear
> the veil asunder and reveal to the spiritually ripened those challenging verities that

> the most effective means for the attainment of the end so greatly desired by even the
> staunchest and most zealous advocate of the Faith. (Shoghi Effendi, Bahá‟í
> Administration, p. 125)

This application of divine teachings revealed by the Prophets of God to the questions
that perplex humanity is hence not a process fixed in time and reserved for the
Prophets and their chosen ones alone. „Abdu‟l-Bahá describes the process whereby
the spiritually attuned in divine philosophy in the Islamic Dispensation were able to
solve the problems posed to them:

> They divided Divine philosophy into two parts: one kind is that of which the
> knowledge can be acquired through lectures and study in schools and colleges. The
> second kind of philosophy was that of the Illuminati, or followers of the inner light.
> The schools of this philosophy were held in silence. Meditating, and turning their
> faces to the Source of Light, from that central Light the mysteries of the Kingdom
> were reflected in the hearts of these people. All the Divine problems were solved by
> this power of illumination.
> This Society of Friends increased greatly in Persia, and up to the present time their
> societies exist. Many books and epistles were written by their leaders. When they
> assemble in their meeting-house they sit silently and contemplate; their leader opens
> with a certain proposition, and says to the assembly „You must meditate on this
> problem‟. Then, freeing their minds from everything else, they sit and reflect, and
> before long the answer is revealed to them. Many abstruse divine questions are
> solved by this illumination.

Some of the great questions unfolding from the rays of the Sun of Reality upon the
mind of man are: the problem of the reality of the spirit of man; of the birth of the
spirit; of its birth from this world into the world of God; the question of the inner life
of the spirit and of its fate after its ascension from the body.
They also meditate upon the scientific questions of the day, and these are likewise
solved.
These people, who are called „Followers of the inner light‟, attain to a superlative
degree of power, and are entirely freed from blind dogmas and imitations. Men rely
on the statements of these people: by themselves—within themselves—they solve all
mysteries.
If they find a solution with the assistance of the inner light, they accept it, and
afterwards they declare it: otherwise they would consider it a matter of blind
imitation. They go so far as to reflect upon the essential nature of the Divinity, of the
Divine revelation, of the manifestation of the Deity in this world. All the divine and
scientific questions are solved by them through the power of the spirit.
Bahá‟u‟lláh says there is a sign (from God) in every phenomenon: the sign of the
intellect is contemplation and the sign of contemplation is silence, because it is
impossible for a man to do two things at one time—he cannot both speak and
meditate.
It is an axiomatic fact that while you meditate you are speaking with your own spirit.
In that state of mind you put certain questions to your spirit and the spirit answers:
the light breaks forth and the reality is revealed.
You cannot apply the name „man‟ to any being void of this faculty of meditation;
without it he would be a mere animal, lower than the beasts.
Through the faculty of meditation man attains to eternal life; through it he receives
the breath of the Holy Spirit—the bestowal of the Spirit is given in reflection and
meditation.
The spirit of man is itself informed and strengthened during meditation; through it
affairs of which man knew nothing are unfolded before his view. Through it he
receives Divine inspiration, through it he receives heavenly food.
Meditation is the key for opening the doors of mysteries. In that state man abstracts
himself: in that state man withdraws himself from all outside objects; in that
subjective mood he is immersed in the ocean of spiritual life and can unfold the
secrets of things-in-themselves. To illustrate this, think of man as endowed with two
kinds of sight; when the power of insight is being used the outward power of vision
does not see.
This faculty of meditation frees man from the animal nature, discerns the reality of
things, puts man in touch with God.
This faculty brings forth from the invisible plane the sciences and arts. Through the
meditative faculty inventions are made possible, colossal undertakings are carried
out; through it governments can run smoothly. Through this faculty man enters into
the very Kingdom of God.
Nevertheless some thoughts are useless to man; they are like waves moving in the
sea without result. But if the faculty of meditation is bathed in the inner light and
characterized with divine attributes, the results will be confirmed.
The meditative faculty is akin to the mirror; if you put it before earthly objects it will
reflect them. Therefore if the spirit of man is contemplating earthly subjects he will
be informed of these.

> But if you turn the mirror of your spirits heavenwards, the heavenly constellations
> and the rays of the Sun of Reality will be reflected in your hearts, and the virtues of
> the Kingdom will be obtained.
> Therefore let us keep this faculty rightly directed—turning it to the heavenly Sun and
> not to earthly objects—so that we may discover the secrets of the Kingdom, and
> comprehend the allegories of the Bible and the mysteries of the spirit.
> May we indeed become mirrors reflecting the heavenly realities, and may we become
> so pure as to reflect the stars of heaven. („Abdu‟l-Bahá, Paris Talks, pp. 173-176)

Bahá‟u‟lláh and „Abdu‟l-Bahá left it to the House of Justice to respond to the specific
requirements of the times and situations in which the people of the future would
exist:

> Inasmuch as for each day there is a new problem and for every problem an expedient
> solution, such affairs should be referred to the Ministers of the House of Justice that
> they may act according to the needs and requirements of the time. (Bahá‟u‟lláh,
> Tablets of Bahá‟u‟lláh, p. 27)

> Unto the Most Holy Book every one must turn, and all that is not expressly recorded
> therein must be referred to the Universal House of Justice.   („Abdu‟l-Bahá, The
> Will and Testament, p. 19)

Shoghi Effendi expresses confidence that Bahá‟ís will solve problems posed to them
the specific answers for which are not found in the Writings of the Faith:

> We must turn aside from these vain imaginings and suppositions and
> philosophizings of the world, and fix our eyes upon the clear stream of the Teachings
> of Bahá‟u‟lláh. Out of these Teachings, and the society which they will create on this

> scholars, more deeply spiritual thinkers, will be able to answer from a Bahá‟í
> standpoint many of these questions. It is not necessary that they should be in the

The field of divine philosophy is not synonymous with the study of metaphysical
questions in the Jewish yeshiva, the Christian seminary, the Muslim madrasa. It is a
field of knowledge that has its antecedents, going back to the philosopher
Idris/Hermes/Enoch, to Empedocles and Pythagoras, Socrates, Hippocrates, Plato
and Aristotle, according to Bahá‟u‟lláh in the “Lawh-i-Hikmat” and “Lawh al-Basit al-
Haqiqa”. It is a field of knowledge associated by „Abdu‟l-Bahá with the Persian
Islamic philosophers, which included the forerunners of the Báb, Shaykh Ahmad-i-
Ahsa'i and Siyyid Kazim-i-Rashti. But it is also a field renewed and redefined by
none other than the Founder and Expounder of the Bahá‟í Revelation, and hence
reborn in this new Age and Cycle.

It is clear that Bahá‟u‟lláh does not wish His followers to preoccupy themselves with
the philosophical musings of past philosophers, particularly those famous Persian
philosophers whom He describes as follows:

> The Great Being saith: The learned of the day must direct the people to acquire
> those branches of knowledge which are of use, that both the learned themselves and
> the generality of mankind may derive benefits therefrom. Such academic pursuits as
> begin and end in words alone have never been and will never be of any worth. The
> majority of Persia‟s learned doctors devote all their lives to the study of a philosophy
> the ultimate yield of which is nothing but words. (“Tablets of Bahá‟u‟lláh Revealed
> after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas”, p. 169)

Those familiar with the Writings of the Báb have observed that He is severely critical
of both Mulla Sadr al-Din al-Shirazi (Mulla Sadra), the most outstanding philosopher
of the School of Isfahan, and Muhammad Ibn 'Ali Ibnu'l-'Arabi (Ibn 'Arabi), the most
famous and influential Islamic mystical writer. Bahá‟u‟lláh strongly critiques the
leading exponent of Iranian philosophy of His own day, Haji Mulla Hadi Sabzivari,
writing:

> The sage of Sabzivar hath said: „Alas! Attentive ears are lacking, otherwise the
> whisperings of the Sinaic Bush could be heard from every tree.‟ In a Tablet to a man
> of wisdom who had made enquiry as to the meaning of Elementary Reality [Lawh al-
> Basit al-Haqiqa], We addressed this famous sage in these words: „If this saying is
> truly thine, how is it that thou hast failed to hearken unto the Call which the Tree of
> Man hath raised from the loftiest heights of the world? If thou didst hear the Call yet
> fear and the desire to preserve thy life prompted thee to remain heedless to it, thou
> art such a person as hath never been nor is worthy of mention; if thou hast not heard
> it, then thou art bereft of the sense of hearing.‟ In brief, such men are they whose
> words are the pride of the world, and whose deeds are the shame of the nations.

(Bahá‟u‟lláh, Kalímát-i-Firdawsiyyih, in Tablets of Bahá‟u‟lláh, p. 61)

Nor does Bahá‟u‟lláh focus His critique upon select individuals:

> Each sect hath picked out a way for itself and is clinging to a certain cord. Despite
> manifest blindness and ignorance they pride themselves on their insight and
> knowledge. Among them are mystics who bear allegiance to the Faith of Islam, some
> of whom indulge in that which leadeth to idleness and seclusion. I swear by God! It
> lowereth man‟s station and maketh him swell with pride. Man must bring forth fruit.
> One who yieldeth no fruit is, in the words [Matthew 3:10, 7:19, 13:40] of the Spirit
> [Jesus Christ], like unto a fruitless tree, and a fruitless tree is fit but for the fire [SLH,
> p. 70; KA, Q&A, #105, p. 139; TB, pp. 60, 257; SWAB, p. 223; ABDP, p. 110].

(Bahá‟u‟lláh, Kalímát-i-Firdawsiyyih, in TB, p. 60)

> Do thou beseech God to enable thee to remain steadfast in this path, and to aid thee
> to guide the peoples of the world to Him Who is the manifest and sovereign Ruler,
> Who hath revealed Himself in a distinct attire, Who giveth utterance to a Divine and
> specific Message. This is the essence of faith and certitude. They that are the
> worshipers of the idol which their imaginations have carved, and who call it Inner
> Reality, such men are in truth accounted among the heathen. To this hath the All-
> Merciful borne witness in His Tablets. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Gleanings from the Writings of
> Bahá‟u‟lláh, CLX, p. 338)

FINAL WORDS

The compilations cited so copiously in this monograph have been accessible in print and
online for many years…one might expect that the distinctive characteristics of Bahá‟í
scholarship would have become a hot topic among Bahá‟í scholars, and even generally in
the Bahá‟í community. This is not the case, notwithstanding the many attempts of
Bahá‟í administrators to jump-start engagement with this theme. We might well wonder
why…and while no proof can be mustered here for the causes identified, nevertheless
the topic is worthy of our consideration. Based on observation and rational deduction,
one cause of this reluctance to engage with the Bahá‟í texts that pertain to this theme is
the status quo, that is, the established scholarly methodologies in the academy, which are
various but nevertheless emblematic of theological and philosophical paradigms which
differ, in some cases fundamentally, with the Bahá‟í teachings. The methodologies
employed in the seminary derive from Jewish, Christian and Muslim traditions, rooted in
a distant past, a past that was pre-industrial, pre-global and pre-scientific. Of course, in
making this allegation I am not denying the existence of industrial, global and scientific
antecedents in that distant past, only affirming that industrialization as we know it,
globalism as we know it, and science as we know it did not exist 1400, 2000 and 3000
years ago. All three of these present characteristics of human society began to emerge in
full force barely 200 years ago. The methodologies which have become dominant in the
secular academy, which have become the predominant form of scholarship over the
course of these two centuries are also formally unrelated to the Bahá‟í teachings. While
there may well be a hidden relationship between these two phenomena, it is evident that
no formal and outwardly demonstrable and empirical linkage can be demonstrated
between the two. Bahá‟í scholarship is “the Other”, not either a branch of classical
ancient scholarship, nor of the same family as modern scholarship as we know it in the
academy. When we attempt to discern the characteristics of Bahá‟í scholarship, we are
always inclined to try to put new wine in old wineskins. The other danger is that we
might suppose that Bahá‟í scholarship is entirely original, in which case we may attempt
to reinvent the wheel. Neither of these solutions, as indicated by their cliché status are
adequate engagements with the ideas contained in Bahá‟í texts. Those ideas need to be
contextualized, and also projected out of the box and into the future, rather than tied to
past understandings and present inclinations. Bahá‟í scholars would be well-advised to
take up the study of this topic in earnest, and to encourage young people in their
communities to do so. The leadership of the Universal House of Justice, which has
provided fine compilations of source texts, and a number of letters to scholars and
about scholarship, this leadership, and that of the National Spiritual Assemblies and
Associations for Bahá‟í Studies is not only to be commended by Bahá‟í scholars but
heeded with energy and determination. Only the taking to heart and mind of these

Bahá‟í teachings by the Bahá‟í community at all levels can result in the integration and
implementation of this new paradigm, and its application to the myriad fields of
knowledge, craft and art as they are presently configured.
