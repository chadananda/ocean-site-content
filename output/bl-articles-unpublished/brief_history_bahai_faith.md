## Brief History of the Bahá'í Faith

Bahá'í History can be divided into seven periods thus far. The first three periods form the Apostolic or Heroic Age. The first epoch centres around the youthful and gentle Bab \[meaning the Gate, also known as the Forerunner of the Ancient Beauty\], Whose brief tumultuous Ministry prepared the way for the long-awaited coming of the promised Messenger of God. The second epoch is centered about the majestic, powerful and awe-inspiring figure of Bahá'u'lláh \[meaning the Glory of God, also known by the titles: The Blessed Perfection, The Ancient Beauty\], the Promised One of all religions. Having given up a life of extreme wealth and ease, He promoted the Message of the Bab, only later to learn that He Himself was the Promised One foretold by the Bab and by the religions of the past. Enduring 40 years of exiles and imprisonments, and under nearly impossible circumstances, surrounded by enemies and their plots, lies and intrigues, He revealed God's Message for this Day. The third epoch revolves around the ministry of 'Abdu'l-Bahá \[meaning servant of the Glory, i.e. of the Glory of God\] and eldest son of Bahá'u'lláh. Sharing His Father's exiles and imprisonments, 'Abdu'l-Bahá became the perfect example of His Father's Teachings and today is known as the Exemplar and Interpreter of the Bahá'í Faith, The Most Great Branch, The Master, and The Center of Bahá'u'lláh's Covenant.  
  
The last four periods comprise the Formative Age. The first epoch of the Formative Age "witnessed the birth and the primary stages in the erection of the framework of the Administrative Order of the Faith". "That epoch was characterized by a twofold process aiming at the consolidation of the administrative structure of the Faith and the extension of the range of its institutions." —Citadel of Faith, p. 5. The second epoch extended that twofold process, extending the range of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's Divine Plan and culminating with the election of the Universal House of Justice. The third epoch, characterized by rapid growth, concluded with the beginning of the Faith's emergence from obscurity into the larger arena of public notice, fueled in no small part by the persecution of the Bahá'í's in the land of It's birth. The fourth (and present) epoch began with the increased maturation of the administrative institutions from the local spiritual assemblies up to and including the Universal House of Justice which is now engaged in a vast expansion of the World Center. This epoch will also witness the complete emergence of the Faith from obscurity and vastly greater involvement in the social and economic development of the world.  
  
This brief guide provides a chronological view of the more significant events in the history of the religion. The chronology has been pieced together from a broad array of historical sources which will one day be listed at the end.

Shoghi Effendi's system of transliteration is used throughout to most accurately display Persian and Arabic names. HTML does not permit full accuracy in this regard, as it does not support all the necessary characters. Here is a brief pronunciation guide to assist the reader:

Bahá'u'lláh is pronounced: Ba (as in back) - haw - o (as in short) - law. Wherever you see a, think a as in arm. ' indicates a pause. Mirza is pronounced: Meerzaw. Whenever you see i, think ee as in meet. Bahá'í would therefore be Ba - haw - (brief pause) - ee; in this context the i means of, as in follower of. Quddus is pronounced: Khodoos. Whenever you see u think oo as in moon. Don't worry too much about the Q - it is a guttural sound that doesn't come naturally to Anglophones . Unless you have heard Arabic or Persian, just treat it like a K.

#### First Epoch of the Heroic Age: 1844-1853: The Ministry of the Bab, the Forerunner

*   12 Nov 1817 Birth of Bahá'u'lláh \[Mirza Husayn-'Ali\] in Tihran, to one of the wealthiest families in Persia. Bahá'u'lláh, never having attended school, is taught calligraphy, riding, classical poetry and a good reading knowledge of the Qur'an which was customary for a nobleman's son at that time.
*   20 Oct 1819 Birth of the Bab \[Siyyid 'Ali-Muhammad\] in Shiraz, Persia
*   pre-1844 Bahá'u'lláh becomes known as "The Father of the Poor" for His generosity and care of the needy. His father dies in 1839. Bahá'u'lláh was asked to take His father's place in the government but Bahá'u'lláh refuses the position.
*   22 May 1844 Declaration of the mission of the Bab in Shiraz to Mulla Husayn at 2 hours, 11 minutes after sunset (technically, 23 May - new day begins after sunset).
*   23 May 1844 Birth of 'Abdu'l-Bahá \['Abbas Effendi\], eldest son of Bahá'u'lláh
*   soon after: The Bab instructed Mulla Husayn to journey through Persia and Iraq and deliver a scroll to One Who is worthy. The reputation of Bahá'u'lláh convinces him that He is the intended recipient. Bahá'u'lláh reads the scroll and immediately becomes a follower of the Bab.
*   12 Dec 1844 The Bab, accompanied by His foremost disciple Quddus, undertakes a pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina where He performs His first public declaration of His divine mission.
*   Mar 1845 The Bab returns to Shiraz. His Teachings cause commotion among the populace, especially the clergy.
*   soon after: The Shah commands the erudite Vahid to investigate the Bab's claims. Vahid becomes a leading disciple. Hujjat, another dignitary of the realm, also becomes a leading disciple. The anxiety among the clergy increases.
*   Sep 1846 The Bab journeys to Isfahan, accorded honours by the people. Death warrant issued by the local high clergy. The Bab journeys to Kashan and Tabriz, receives enthusiastic reception by the people.
*   23 Sep 1846 The Bab is arrested in Shiraz at the house of His uncle. The Shah, prompted by his top advisor, Haji Mirza Aqasi, has the Bab incarcerated at the fortress of Mah-ku in the mountains of Adhirbayjan for nine months. The local populace, at first hostile, comes to revere Him. The Bab reveals one of His great works, the Bayan.
*   1 Apr 1847 Bahá'u'lláh sends a letter and gifts to the Bab in Mah-ku.
*   20 Mar 1848 Mulla Husayn arrives at Mah-ku to see the Bab.
*   10 April 1848 Due to the great influence He was having with the people of the area, the Bab is transferred to prison in Chirig, a Kurdish area hostile to Persians. Here too many leading citizens become followers. The Bab is arraigned in Tabriz where He makes a dramatic public declaration of His Station. He is returned to Chirig.
*   Jun 1848 Conference of Badasht. Organized, directed and hosted by Bahá'u'lláh and attended by 81 of the Bab's leading followers, the Babi Faith for the first time becomes understood by It's followers as a religion distinct from Islam. Bahá'u'lláh bestows a new name upon each participant and with no contact, the Bab later confirms and uses those same names \[note: the new names are the ones being used in this account\]. Tahirih \[the pure\] pronounces the equality of women and publicly removes her veil. Bahá'u'lláh reconciles the participants following this great controversy, facilitating their understanding of this new religion.
*   21 Jul 1848 Mulla Husayn hoists the Black Standard and marches from Mashad with 202 fellow disciples to assist Quddus in Mazindaran.
*   4 Sep 1848 Muhammad Shah, intending to order death of Bahá'u'lláh, dies, succeeded by 17-year old Nasiri'd-Din Shah. Haji Mirza Aqasi, chief antagonist of the Bab \[the Antichrist of the Babi Faith\], is expelled from the capital.
*   10 Oct 1848 Mulla Husayn and the 202 fellow disciples are besieged at Shaykh Tabarsi, eventually surrounded by twenty thousand soldiers.
*   Nov 1848 Quddus arrives at Fort Tabarsi after Mulla Husayn secured his release from Sari.
*   Dec 1848 Bahá'u'lláh imprisoned and tortured in Amul.
*   10 May 1849 The siege at Shaykh Tabarsi ends in betrayal when a promise of "no harm", signed on a Qur'an, is broken. The Babis are tortured, mutilated and massacred.
*   16 May 1849 Martyrdom of Quddus in Barfurush.
*   soon after: A force of 5000 men begin extermination of Babis, confiscating possessions, destroying houses, grizzly tortures, mutilations and executions - all inspired by religious fanaticism inflamed by the clergy. 1800 Babis martyred in Zanjan including men, women and children. Hujjat is martyred. The famous Seven Martyrs of Tihran are martyred.
*   29 June 1850 Vahid is mutilated and killed in Nayriz.
*   9 Jul 1850 Attempted execution of the Bab in Tabriz by a firing squad of 750 soldiers in front of 20,000 witnesses fails. The Bab vanishes in the smoke and is found later completing His final instructions to His amanuensis. The leader of the first firing squad refuses to try again. A second attempt is made using a new leader at noon, this time successfully. A gale force wind, earthquake, cholera and famine immediately follow. One third of the firing squad later die in an earthquake, the remainder are executed for mutiny. The bodies of the Bab and Anis are retrieved as directed by Bahá'u'lláh and ultimately interred at the Shrine of the Bab on the slope of Mt. Carmel, Israel.
*   30 Aug 1851 Bahá'u'lláh arrives in Karbila, Iraq - the start of a 10 month pilgrimage. Continues to spread the Bab's Teachings.
*   15 Aug 1852 Two crazed Babis attempt to kill Nasiri'd-Din Shah. They are executed on the spot. Nationwide reign of terror sweeps Persia. Anyone suspected of being Babi are killed in unspeakably gruesome and inhumane manners. Many European diplomats witness and record the events. The nominee of the Bab, Mirza Yahya, half-brother of Bahá'u'lláh, flees \[note: the Bab appointed him as His figurehead to deflect attention away from Bahá'u'lláh\]. Upon hearing news of the assassination attempt, Bahá'u'lláh rides to the military post in Niyavaran. He is arrested and marched in chains, bare headed and bare footed to the Siyah-Chal of Tihran \[literally meaning the Black Pit, it was "an abominable pit that had once served as a reservoir of water for one of the public baths" of Tihran\]. Here He was surrounded by criminals with His feet in mighty stocks and neck weighed done by a mighty chain, a chain so infamous that it had it's own name. Tahirih is executed. Her last words: "You can kill me as soon as you like, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women". Bahá'u'lláh is now the sole survivor from among the leaders of the Babi Faith. No one would sign His death warrant out of fear that His execution would spark riots throughout Persia. Instead, it was hoped that he would die in this loathsome prison. This was not to be.

#### Second Epoch of the Heroic Age: 1853-1892: The Ministry of Bahá'u'lláh

*   Aug - Nov 1852 In the Siyah-Chal, Bahá'u'lláh receives His Intimation that He is the Messenger of God for this Day. He leads the prisoners in song so loud that the Shah hears the singing from his palace. One by one, most of the other Babis chained with Him are executed. By now, an approximate total of 20,000 Babis had been martyred. Bahá'u'lláh is poisoned, but survives. Bahá'u'lláh's family and Russian Minister Prince Dolgorouki demonstrate the complete innocence of Bahá'u'lláh in the matter of the assassination attempt. Bahá'u'lláh is released after four months of imprisonment, carrying the deep marks of the chains throughout the remainder of His days. 'Abdu'l-Bahá recognizes the full impact of the station of His Father. Bahá'u'lláh bestows upon His Son the designation "Mystery of God".
*   12 Jan 1853 Bahá'u'lláh is banished, chooses Baghdad for His place of exile. His wealth is confiscated and properties pillaged. His youngest son is left behind with relatives because of the lack of provisions and the harsh winter travel.
*   8 Apr 1853 Bahá'u'lláh arrives in Baghdad. Mirza Aqa Jan is the first to recognize Him as the Promised One. Bahá'u'lláh achieves great fame because of the love He shows the people and because of the great Writings He reveals. He is shown veneration by the populace. Mirza Yahya, prodded by Siyyid Muhammad \[the Antichrist of the Bahá'í Faith\], begins to discredit Bahá'u'lláh out of jealousy.
*   10 Apr 1854 Bahá'u'lláh leaves for the mountains of Kurdistan (Sulaymaniyyih) so that He would not be a source of disunity among the Babis. Here he stays nearly two years in isolation, except for brief visits to a local town for provisions. Villagers who have contact with Him spread word of Him and are magnetized with His love. Meanwhile, under Mirza Yahya's direction, the Babi community degenerates. Out of desperation, 25 men claimed to be the Promised One foretold by the Bab. 'Abdu'l-Bahá, heartbroken by His Father's absence, passes time by copying and memorizing the Bab's Writings.
*   19 Mar 1856 Fame of a man in the mountains of Kurdistan, had reached Baghdad. Bahá'u'lláh's family realized this man is Bahá'u'lláh and pleads for His return. He does return to Baghdad on this day and begins to rebuild the Babi community. The community grows in size and respect.
*   1856 Bahá'u'lláh reveals The Seven Valleys. Later reveals The Four Valleys.
*   1858 Bahá'u'lláh reveals the Hidden Words.
*   circa 1860 Bahá'u'lláh applies for Ottoman nationality - obtains Turkish passports. Bahá'u'lláh's attendant is convinced to murder Him as He bathed, but struck by awe in His presence and remorse, he flees. Later, the same man approaches Bahá'u'lláh with a pistol, but again, in His presence, drops the pistol and flees. Famous meeting occurs between Bahá'u'lláh and clergy of several different faiths, in which the clergy concedes Bahá'u'lláh's knowledge and wisdom. They ask Him to perform a miracle as a final proof. Bahá'u'lláh agrees, but says they must all agree to one miracle (for the Cause of God is not a sideshow with hourly miracles) and put in writing that upon completion of the miracle, they must confess the truth of His Cause. The clergy could not agree on a miracle and drop the challenge. 'Abdu'l-Bahá, now 15, visits the local mosques and has dialog with the learned and Himself becomes famous for His wisdom.
*   circa 1861-2 Bahá'u'lláh reveals The Book of Certitude (Kitab-i-Iqan).
*   21 Mar 1863 Bahá'u'lláh reveals the Tablet of the Holy Mariner, in which He reveals gloomy predictions. Prompted by the stirrings of the clergy and the Persian Consul General of Baghdad, Bahá'u'lláh was invited to Istanbul on March 26th and given a sum of money for the journey by the Governor of Baghdad. Bahá'u'lláh accepts the invitation but gives all the money to the poor.
*   22 April 1863 Public declaration of the mission of Bahá'u'lláh in the Garden of Ridvan \[meaning Paradise, then known as the Garden of Najibiyyih\] in Baghdad on the shores of the Tigris River, nineteen years after the Bab's declaration, which fulfills the Bab's prophecy.
*   3 May 1863 Bahá'u'lláh, 11 family members and 26 disciples depart for Constantinople at noon. During the journey, they are accorded enthusiastic receptions wherever they stopped, being preceded by the government cavalry, flags flying and drums beating.
*   13 Aug 1863 Bahá'u'lláh departs by steamer from the port of Samsun to Constantinople.
*   16 Aug 1863 Arrival in Constantinople \[the Sublime Porte\] at noon. The house provided was too small. Within a month they were relocated to larger quarters. The Persian government is extremely upset with the courteousness and kindness shown by the Sultan toward Bahá'u'lláh, Who was received as a guest. Finally the Sultan was unable to resist the political pressure and issues the edict of banishment to the remote Adrianople (modern day Edirne). Bahá'u'lláh sends His first of many letters to the Kings and rulers of the world, to Sultan 'Abdu'l-'Aziz.
*   12 Dec 1863 Arrival in Adrianople \[the Land of Mystery\] after a bitterly cold 12 day journey. Here, Bahá'u'lláh publicly announces His mission, both to His followers and to the world in letters to the Kings, rulers, religious leaders and mankind in general including elected officials. Most Babis accept Him and become known as Bahá'ís. Note that Bahá'u'lláh's presence in Constantinople and Adrianople were the first time in recorded world history that a Manifestation of God set foot on European soil. Here, His revelation rose to its zenith; He is shown great respect by local officials, the diplomatic corps, and religious communities. Among those addressed by Bahá'u'lláh at this time were: Napoleon III, the Czar, Queen Victoria, the Pope, the Sultan and the Shah. In most cases, Bahá'u'lláh declares His Mission and makes demands of the ruler and states the consequences should He be rejected. All but Queen Victoria reject Him, and all but Queen Victoria succumb to defeat and humiliation, including Pope Pius IX.
*   1864 Bahá'u'lláh is poisoned by His half brother, Aqay-i-Kalim. He was seriously ill for a month and was left with a shaking hand until the end of His life. (Today, you can see the effects of the poisoning in the penmanship of Bahá'u'lláh, preserved in the Bahá'í archives in Haifa.) Mirza Yahya has the well poisoned which provided water to Bahá'u'lláh's companions.
*   1865 Les Religions et les Philosophies dans l' Asie Centrale by the Comte de Gobineau is published, making the West aware of the Bab. 'Abdu'l-Bahá becomes known by all as "The Master".
*   some time later Bahá'u'lláh reveals the Tablet of Ahmad for Ahmad-i-Yazdi, a resident of Baghdad, who travels throughout Persia confirming that Bahá'u'lláh is the Promised One of all ages (part of the proof he gave was a written statement by the Bab "which declared that 'He Whom God shall make manifest' would bear the name Bahá").
*   12 Aug 1868 Mirza Yahya \[who had been given the title Subh-i-Azal (Morning of Eternity) by the Bab), responded to Bahá'u'lláh's public claim by also claiming he was a messenger of God. Due to the plotting,scheming and intrigues by Mirza Yahya (who was the constant willing tool of Siyyid Muhammad), the Sultan banishes Bahá'u'lláh and His companions to 'Akka, while Mirza Yahya and his party (the Azalis) are sent to Cyprus. Bahá'u'lláh and 66 of His followers departs from Adrianople, initially for Gallipoli. Additionally, the government decided that four of the Azalis would accompany the Bahá'í group and vice versa. Siyyid Muhammad was one of the four to accompany Bahá'u'lláh. The lies and calumnies by Mirza Yahya and Siyyid Muhammad damaged the prestige of the Faith in the eyes of its western admirers such as E. G. Browne and A.L.M. Nicolas (the French Diplomat and translator of the Persian and Arabic Bayans). Yahya later died with no followers left to give him a burial as either a Babi or Bahá'í.
*   21 Aug 1868 Bahá'u'lláh departs from Gallipoli by steamer for Haifa and then by sail to 'Akka.
*   31 Aug 1868 Arrival in 'Akka \[the Most Great Prison, today known as Acre\], a prison city for which it was said at that time that should a bird fly over it, the bird would surely fall to the ground dead for its foul air. During the first short while, almost all the prisoners became ill with malaria, dysentery or other sicknesses. 'Abdu'l-Bahá tended to all the sick even though he himself contracted an illness. Bahá'u'lláh predicts that one day He will pitch His tent on Mt. Carmel. Three succumbed to their illnesses.
*   2 Sep 1868 The Governor of 'Akka visits the "desperate criminals" and is deeply impressed by 'Abdu'l-Bahá. He is moved to improve their conditions. Another visitor states that "such pure and sanctified souls had never before been seen in 'Akka". Meanwhile, Siyyid Muhammad and Aqa Jan Big, the source of all the lies to the authorities, convinced some guards to move their quarters to overlook the land gate so that they could identify anyone who arrived if they were Bahá'í and thus warning the guards, the pilgrims who had walked for weeks would be turned back without even a glimpse of Bahá'u'lláh through His cell window.
*   23 Jun 1870 Mirza Mihdi (the Purest Branch, Bahá'u'lláh's youngest son) falls through a skylight in the prison. Bahá'u'lláh offers to heal him but Mirza Mihdi instead offers his life as a sacrifice so that those who desire may undertake pilgrimages. Bahá'u'lláh accepts and the Purest Branch dies at age 22. 70 years later, his body is entombed in the Monument Gardens on Mount Carmel.
*   4 Nov 1870 Release from prison barracks to house within 'Akka (the house of 'Udi Khammar). This house was attached to the house of 'Abbud. The partition between them was later removed and became known as simply the house of 'Abbud.
*   23 Jan 1872 Murder of Siyyid Muhammad (the one who had constantly manipulated Mirza Yahya into his cowardly acts), Aqa Jan Big and another companion Covenant-breaker in 'Akka in retaliation for their persecutions. Bahá'u'lláh had forbidden any act of retaliation, but seven of His tormented companions succumbed. An army of men descended upon the Bahá'ís. The seven guilty men were confined for several years. The remainder were confined for six months. The distress caused to Bahá'u'lláh of this event was immeasurable: "That which can make Me ashamed is the conduct of such of My followers as profess to love Me".
*   Aug - Sep 1872 Marriage of 'Abdu'l-Bahá and Munirih Khanum. Four of their daughters survived the long imprisonment and distinguished themselves in their lives dedicated to service.
*   1873 A new governor of 'Akka is appointed. This one was captivated by 'Abdu'l-Bahá and saw through the ploys of the antagonists. He asked Bahá'u'lláh what he could do of service: Bahá'u'lláh requested that the aqueduct be restored to operation. Bahá'u'lláh reveals the Kitab-i-Aqdas \[the Most Holy Book, the Book of Laws and Ordinances of the Bahá'í Faith\]. In this Book is also found many more addresses to the rulers of the world and is the culmination of His formal declaration. The Bahá'í community transformed into a respected community and Bahá'ís were allowed to open up shops.
*   1875 The new governor is transferred, expresses his sorrow at his separation from Bahá'u'lláh and His son.
*   June 1877 Departure from 'Akka for the Mansion of Mazra'ih and His first visits to the Ridvan Garden.
*   Sep 1879 Occupation of the Mansion of Bahji \[Joy\]. Bahá'u'lláh increasingly delegates affairs of the Bahá'í community toward 'Abdu'l-Bahá, helping the community to become gradually accustomed to 'Abdu'l-Bahá's role after Bahá'u'lláh's passing.
*   1883 Visit by Bahá'u'lláh to Haifa
*   1886 Death of Bahá'u'lláh's wife Navvab in 'Akka
*   April 1890 Edward Granville Browne of Cambridge University, interviews Bahá'u'lláh and visits with 'Abdu'l-Bahá at Bahji.
*   Spring 1890 and summer 1891 Two more visits by Bahá'u'lláh to Haifa; revelation of the Tablet of Carmel; Bahá'u'lláh's identification of the site of the future Shrine of the Bab.
*   1891 Bahá'u'lláh's revelation of the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf
*   1892 Revelation of the Kitab-i-'Ahd \[the Book of the Covenant\], the last Tablet revealed.
*   29 May 1892 Ascension of Bahá'u'lláh at 8 hours after sunset (approximately. 3AM) in Bahji, 'Akka.
*   7 Jun 1892 Unsealing and reading of Bahá'u'lláh's Kitab-i-'Ahd at Bahji. 'Abdu'l-Bahá \["the Centre of the Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh", "the Master", "the Most Mighty Branch", "the Exemplar"\] is appointed as the interpreter of His teachings and the source of authority in all affairs of the faith.

  

#### Third Epoch of the Heroic Age: 1892-1921: The Ministry of 'Abdu'l-Bahá

*   1892-1896 Mirza Muhammad-'Ali \[also a son of Bahá'u'lláh, designated The Greater Branch, second in rank to 'Abdu'l-Bahá and half-brother of 'Abdu'l-Bahá\] undertakes covert campaign to discredit 'Abdu'l-Bahá and assume leadership of the Bahá'í Faith. 'Abdu'l-Bahá chooses to keep silent and protect the community .
*   23 Sep 1893 First public mention of the Bahá'í Faith in the West. In a session of the World's Parliament of Religions, the Reverend George A. Ford, a Syrian missionary, reads a paper talking about Bahá'u'lláh.
*   Feb 1894 Dr. Ibrahim George Khayru'llah, having arrived in New York in 1892, moves to Chicago and seeks out people interested in the Bahá'í Message.
*   1894 Thornton Chase becomes first American Bahá'í. 'Abdu'l-Bahá confers upon him the title "Steadfast". Louisa A. Moore becomes a Bahá'í, given the title "Banner", i.e. Banner of the Cause, and is later designated by the Guardian as "the mother teacher of the West". She marries Edward Getsinger and becomes Lua Getsinger. Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, wife of Senator George F. Hearst, was taught by Lua Getsinger during one of Mrs. Getsinger's extensive travels throughout America.
*   1 Mar 1897 Shoghi Effendi, eldest grandson of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, is born of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's eldest daughter in the House of Abdu'llah Pasha.. He is descended from Bahá'u'lláh on his mother's side and related to the Bab on his father's side.
*   1898 Phoebe Hearst organizes historic pilgrimage of 15 early American Bahá'ís to meet 'Abdu'l-Bahá. By now there are hundreds of Bahá'ís in America. The pilgrims arrive in 'Akka 10 Dec 1898. The hearts of the pilgrims are set ablaze by the love of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, so much so that some believe 'Abdu'l-Bahá is the return of Jesus Christ. 'Abdu'l-Bahá corrects them, saying that He is the Servant of Bahá. Robert Turner, the black butler of Mrs. Hearst, shown great kindness by 'Abdu'l-Bahá, later becomes the first black Bahá'í on the American continent. May Ellis Bolles is asked to teach the Faith in Paris. Dr. Khayru'llah, also among the pilgrims, sought 'Abdu'l-Bahá's endorsement of his presentation of the Bahá'í Faith. 'Abdu'l-Bahá corrects his misconceptions and urged him to seriously study the Bahá'í Writings. Khayru'llah refuses.
*   31 Jan 1899 Remains of the Bab finally arrive at Mt. Carmel. 'Abdu'l-Bahá begins construction of a befitting resting-place.
*   1899 First Bahá'í centre in Europe established in Paris.
*   1900 Dr. Khayru'llah violates Bahá'u'lláh's Covenant, establishes pact with Mirza Muhammad-'Ali and works against 'Abdu'l-Bahá, trying to seize control of the Faith in the West. Almost none of the American Bahá'ís follow his lead; they remain faithful to 'Abdu'l-Bahá. Khayru'llah would continue spreading his poison for two decades, but unsuccessful, finally returns to Syria.
*   1901 'Abdu'l-Bahá and His family, until this time free to venture in the area, are once again confined to the prison walls of 'Akka as a consequence of His enemies representation to the authorities that 'Abdu'l-Bahá was constructing a fort (in reality, the mausoleum) and building an army (in reality, just visiting pilgrims). He directs attention to correspondence while in prison and visits and assists the needy and the sick of 'Akka.
*   summer 1901 May Ellis Bolles teaches Thomas Breakwell, first British Bahá'í.

'Abdu'l-Bahá drafts His Will and Testament, detailing the two principal institutions of the Faith (the Guardianship - the sole authority for the interpretation of the Bahá'í teachings, and the Universal House of Justice - the primary legislative and administrative authority of the Bahá'í community). He begins to focus on building the international community and the establishment of spiritual assemblies in North America and Persia, the forerunners of the future local Houses of Justice.
*   28 Nov 1928 Construction begins on the first Bahá'í House of Worship ('Ishqabad, Russia).

This is a work in progress. More details on the development of the World Center will be added when I can do so. It is my hope that this chronology provides you with an overview which will aid your understanding of the extraordinary circumstances in which the Bahá'í Teachings have been revealed. This is by no means an exhaustive work; myriads of details have been left out for the sake of brevity. As a suggestion, try viewing this chronology when you pick up one of Bahá'u'lláh's works. Look at His trials and tribulations and peruse the words from The Pen of Glory. How else could such outpourings of wisdom and love have emanated under such circumstances from an uneducated Man except through the Power of God? This is the first and foremost proof of the Manifestation of God: His Revelation.
