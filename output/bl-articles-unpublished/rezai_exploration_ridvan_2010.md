> The following paper was written in December 2010 for a Wilmette Institute course (and in anticipation of the 28 Dec 2010 Five Year Plan message of the House). In order to obtain a better understanding of the Ridvan 2010 message, the paper explores the prevalence and purpose of six common elements of Plan letters of the Guardian and the House of Justice – praise and acknowledgement, analysis of conditions, call and directives, reminder of fundamentals, guidance, and encouragement and assurance – using word counts of each element within each paragraph. The resulting data is then analyzed and discussed to provide, hopefully, a more clear understanding of the role of each of these elements, as well as an additional mindset by which to read subsequent House messages.

ABSTRACT

In order to obtain a better understanding of the Ridvan 2010 message, six common elements of Plan
letters of the Guardian and the House of Justice – praise and acknowledgement, analysis of conditions,
call and directives, reminder of fundamentals, guidance, and encouragement and assurance – are
explored within this message, using word counts of each element within each paragraph.

INTRODUCTION

The Vision Conveyed in Plans - chapter 2 of The Spiritual Conquest of the Planet: Our Response to
Plans, the fifth publication in a Series on Major Themes of the Creative Word, authored by Melanie
Smith and Paul Lample - explores an overview of the common elements that provide a framework for
understanding the progress of the Divine Plan found in the messages of Shoghi Effendi and the
Universal House of Justice. These elements include: praise and acknowledgment of achievements; an
analysis of spiritual and material conditions; a call to new achievements and directives for action; a
reminder of fundamental processes; guidance to individuals and institutions; and encouragement and
assurance. These same elements appear in the Ridvan 2010 message of the House of Justice and will
be explored below.

The Ridvan 2010 message of the House of Justice, the longest Ridvan message since the multiple
messages in 1996, is a colossal work of beauty which details the cultural advances achieved by the
Baha’i community since the start of the last quarter of the first century of the Formative Age fourteen
years ago; calls for additional directives in the last year of the Five Year Plan within which it was
written, after, of course, praising the community for winning the current Plan’s goals a year in advance
of its conclusion; and introduces the next two movements on which the Baha’i world is embarking,
foreshadowing the next Plans and providing invaluable guidance through at least the hundred year
anniversary of the Master’s passing. Of note, the five prominent cultural advances, referred to below
on many occasions, are all included in paragraph nineteen, and are, briefly: direct teaching, study
circles, children’s classes, the junior youth program, and a posture of learning. The message is
separated into four sections, each by a distinguishing single centered asterisk: paragraphs one through
eighteen deal with four of the cultural developments, namely the teaching work, the training institute,
and its two programs for children and junior youth; nineteen through twenty-four explore the fifth
cultural development, learning as a mode of operation, along with the relationships and the roles of the
institutions; twenty-five through thirty-two discuss two new lines of action, social action and
participation in prevalent discourses; and finally, as a section-in-itself, paragraph thirty-three reminds
us of the spiritual nature of the enterprise.

Both of these patterns - exploring past, present, and future; and the six elements listed above – occur
not only throughout the message as a whole, but also within specific topics addressed from paragraph
to paragraph (ie, children’s classes, role of the LSAs, etc.) Below are the six elements mentioned
above, as taken from The Spiritual Conquest of the Planet:

Praise and acknowledgment of achievements

"Usually presented at the beginning of the messages, these passages recount the gains made during a
particular time period, describe their effects in the world, and praise the believers’ efforts. They impart
a clear sense of our progress toward achieving the goals of the plan and offer concrete evidence of
Bahá’u’lláh’s power to build a new world."

Analysis of spiritual and material conditions

"A common theme in plan letters is an analysis of the current status of the twin processes of integration
—the building of the new world order—and disintegration—the breakdown of the old world. These
passages enable us to see the spiritual significance of past efforts and current and future challenges in
the context of a long-range vision of the destiny of the Faith."

Call to new achievements and directives for action

"Each plan calls for new actions that build upon previous achievements and that set the stage for future
development. Other messages presented in the course of a plan include additional objectives and
specific directives that provide concrete ways to achieve the goals."

Reminder of fundamental processes

"As the Faith develops, the range of actions that engage the community becomes broader in scope,
leading, potentially to confusion about priorities and how one goal relates to another. Plan messages
are filled with reminders of fundamental processes and principles that guide our actions as we work.
Examples include the organic process of growth, the purpose for which we are laboring, and the
importance of teaching."

Guidance to individuals and institutions

"These passages acknowledge the obstacles and opportunities confronting individuals and institutions
in the path of service, then provide detailed guidance for systematically addressing the challenges."

Encouragement and assurance

"Ultimately, the work of the Faith depends on spiritual forces that can be tapped through perseverance,
selfless action, unity, and sacrifice. The messages are filled with assurances that potent spiritual forces
will reinforce our efforts if we arise to do our part."

Released just over halfway through the quarter century series of Plans with the explicit aim of
advancing the process of entry by troops, the message has seemed to inject a massive spiritual impetus
to communities everywhere during the final year of the current Five Year Plan – an impetus already
being added to the momentum generated from both the spiritual forces released from the historical 41
conferences at the halfway point of this twenty-five year period, and the winning of goals a year early.
That the energy released will be drawn upon for years is equally matched by the far-reaching insights
that will be used and referenced also for years – insights into understanding the purpose, nature, and
dynamics of the community building process, and the two further areas of activity, namely social
action and participation in discourse.

Understanding how these six elements, common features of the Plan messages of the Guardian and the
House of Justice, play a role in the Ridvan 2010 message will help us obtain a better sense of the
significance of the social and spiritual impact this momentous document has caused.

METHODS

Took six different color highlighters or pens, read the Ridvan message six times, underlined or
highlighted passages corresponding to the above six elements with a respective color, used Microsoft
Word’s trusty word count tool to count words per paragraph, then counted up the words per paragraph
per each color, inputted the word counts into Excel, made a bunch of elaborate graphs, looked over it a
few times, pondered a bit, then wrote this paper.

RESULTS

I didn’t feel like reliving my college stats experience, so I didn’t include any fancy p value
calculations, standard deviation of the means, nor whatever else would have made this paper in any
way even slightly statistically legitimate. Instead, it’s simply a bunch of bar graphs based off each
element’s word count percentage of the paragraph’s total word count. Then I just looked at the trends
of the graphs. But I did try to match my color scheme on the graphs with my highlighted/underlined
Ridvan message!

Table 1: Total word count (left column) and percentage word count (right column) for each element
separated by paragraph. NOTE: Percentage word count is the data used throughout the discussion
section.

Graph 1: Total word count for each element per paragraph (NOT percentage)

Graph 2: Percentage word count for each element per paragraph

So, it seems to make more sense for me to present the graphs and discuss the results of each particular
element in the discussion section, hence that’s what going to happen.

DISCUSSION

Assuming by now that you’ve thoroughly belabored upon and even memorized the results section,
each element will be presented below and discussed one at a time. One thing to keep in mind when
looking at the graphs is the separation of the message into four sections: paragraphs 1-18, 19-24, 25-
32, and paragraph 33.

This element generally appears at the beginning of messages and recounts gains made and their effects
on the world. In the Ridvan message, we see heavy praise placed in the first two paragraphs as the
announcement is made that the goals of the Plan have been won a year early. More importantly
though, and clearly and plainly written by the House in the second paragraph, the feat about which
they are most proud is “a combination of developments at the more profound level of culture”.

We subsequently see, within the first section, each of the four descriptions of culture advancement
accompanied by praise. For instance, paragraphs nine and ten regarding study circles and paragraph
thirteen about children’s classes, include such words as “an accomplishment of enormous proportions”,
“how pleased we are”, and “such promising beginnings”. For reference, paragraph nineteen recounts
the four cultural developments detailed in the first section, and introduces a fifth. (And in retrospect,
that paragraph should have been counted with heavy praise; my mistake. I figured it wasn’t really
praising, simply recounting.)

The three instances of praise we see in the second section is associated with each Institution – the

LSAs, NSAs, and Counsellors, one after another, in paragraphs twenty-two, twenty-three, and twenty-
four, respectively, with words such as “It is gratifying to see” and “one of the most significant
advances”. And the ITC is not left out; they receive “abiding gratitude” in section one, paragraph
fifteen, for their efforts and energy; vital to secure the early attainment of the goals.

Finally, the only significant praise we see in the third section, paragraph twenty-eight, is contained in
the first paragraph after introducing two new areas of activity, and give acknowledgement to the many
Baha’is already engaged in these endeavors.

Analysis of the processes of integration and disintegration is not only the most abundant by total word
count, but one of the most exciting features of this message, as we understand our efforts in the context
of our world and the destiny of our Faith.

Contrasted with the element of call to new achievements, the element of analysis is heavy in the
second half the message, and we see a major increased beginning in section two (paragraph 19) and
continuing to be a very prominent feature of the sections two and three. In fact, statements of analysis
comprise the majority of half of section two paragraphs (3/6), and more than half of section three
paragraphs (5/8). These two sections are dealing with the Institutions and the Administrative Order,
and social action and involvement in discourse. Naturally, the Administration is a crowning feature of
the New World Order, and thus its evolution is heavily tied in with the process of integration; while
social action and participation in discourse is related to the spiritual and material advancement of
civilization, and is itself an integrative force

One example from section two includes the fifth cultural development first mentioned in paragraph
nineteen, at which point the message contrasts the approach of the Baha'i community “in which
learning is the mode of operation, a mode that fosters the informed participation of more and more
people in a united efforts to apply Baha’u’llah’s teachings to the construction of a divine civilization”
against the “moribund ways of an old social order that so often seeks to harness human energy through
domination, through greed, through guilt or through manipulation.” An example from section two
about the Administration includes, “Evolving relationships among administrative structures have
brought the Local Spiritual Assembly to the threshold of a new stage in the exercise of its
responsibilities to diffuse the Word of God, to mobilize the energies of the believers, and to forge an
environment that is spiritually edifying.”

The most significant analysis, in my opinion, comes in section three, as the House is not only
introducing these two new areas of activity, but describing their significance in context of the history
and future of the Faith. “The work advancing in every corner of the globe today represents the latest
stage of the ongoing Bahá’í endeavour to create the nucleus of the glorious civilization enshrined in
His teachings, the building of which is an enterprise of infinite complexity and scale, one that will
demand centuries of exertion by humanity to bring to fruition.” They mention by name the dual
process of integration and disintegration at the end of paragraph twenty-nine, another analysis-heavy
paragraph that explains, among other things, how “perpetuation of ignorance is a most grievous form
of oppression; it reinforces the many walls of prejudice that stand as barriers to the realization of the
oneness of humankind, at once the goal and operating principle of Baha’u’llah’s Revelation.” And
finally, section three is ending with placing our work in the context of “the movement of populations
towards Baha’u’llah’s vision of a prosperous and peaceful world civilization.”

Prior to sections two and three, the significant areas of analysis are mainly in describing the role of the
core activities in contrast to the forces of disintegration in the world. In paragraph six, just after
paragraph five describes all of the core activities, we are given a task to “find those souls longing to
shed the lethargy imposed on them by society”. In paragraph ten, the highest spike of analysis in
section one, we see the juxtaposition of a cultural development enabling millions to see themselves as
active agents of their own learning, to advance and tread a common path of service together through
the educational system built around the study circle and the Ruhi curriculum, against with the forces of
society and the current educational systems of the world today, which breed passivity and cultivate a
desire to be entertained and led. Finally, paragraph sixteen, the second large spike of analysis in
section one, begins by introducing the fourth cultural advance, the junior youth program, and
immediately contrasts the image that the world attributes to this age group against that of the Baha’i
world. “While global trends project an image of this age group as problematic, lost in the throes of
tumultuous physical and emotional change, unresponsive and self- consumed, the Bahá’í community—
in the language it employs and the approaches it adopts—is moving decidedly in the opposite
direction, seeing in junior youth instead altruism, an acute sense of justice, eagerness to learn about the
universe and a desire to contribute to the construction of a better world.” The paragraph continues to
explain that this program will enable junior youth to, themselves, analyze the constructive and
destructive forces in the world and “combat the forces that would rob them of their true identity as
noble beings.”

Since the Ridvan message of 2010 was written towards the end of the Five Year Plan, it calls for
additional objectives not specified in the 27 Dec 2005 message, in addition to restating certain goals
that were previously present. This element is really only prominent in section one of the message,
where much of the discussion regarding the current Plan is found; though, of note, it does occur only
once per each other section, in each concluding paragraph (including the concluding paragraph of
section one).

The call that begins the message in paragraph one is to “strengthen the pattern of expansion and
consolidation now everywhere established”, further elaborated in paragraph five, six, and seven, as we
are asked to extend this pattern broadly while also focusing on pockets of the population, teach within
one or more receptive populations this year, and strengthen the institute process and increase those
capable of acting as tutors, respectively.

As the section moves on to the first core activity addressed, study circles, the tutors are called upon in
paragraphs eleven and twelve to increase the quality of the study circle and provide an environment
conducive to spiritual empowerment, the coordinators are called upon to accompany tutors and arrange
periodic tutor reflection gatherings, and all are called upon to learn how to ensure a “proper measure of
vitality is pulsating through this system”.

With the next two core activities / cultural developments, children’s classes and the junior youth
program, a few specific calls are made. Paragraph fourteen calls for further efforts to systematize the
provision of spiritual education of children, while paragraph fifteen specifically notes an upcoming
analysis of the ITC. Finally, in the conclusion of the first section, a very specific call is made to
establish thirty-two JYSEP learning sites and institute six hundred forty full-time JY coordinators.

As mentioned earlier, each section’s concluding paragraph contains a call. In section two, paragraph
twenty-four, the institutions of the Administrative Order are called to strive to reinforce the mode of
learning referred to as the fifth cultural development at the beginning of that section. And in section
three, paragraph thirty-two, we are asked to concentrate on strengthening “the institute process and the
pattern of activity that it engenders”, despite the House having just described two new opportunities
now opening at the level of the cluster. Finally, in the concluding paragraph of the message, we are
asked, after stirring encouragement, to continue to “bring Baha’u’llah’s message to waiting souls”.

The second most abundant element (after analysis), reminder of the fundamentals seems especially
important in this Ridvan message, not only because two new areas of activity are introduced, but also
because certain concepts within expansion and consolidation are re-examined. In this period of
history, characterized by rapid change and development in the Baha’i community, by an increase in the
breadth and scope of its range of actions, a reminder of the purpose and nature of our work and the
relationship between various goals and priorities are very much needed. Thus, one unique feature of
this element is that nearly half of the paragraphs total have a constant baseline of an average of 15%
reminder statements. This baseline is prominent in the first half of section one and throughout section
two, while section three contains all but two of the spikes in reminders, the others being in section one.

The first set of reminders in the first half of section one (paragraphs two through six) deal with
teaching the Faith within the context of community building. We are reminded first, “that teaching is a
basic requirement of a life of generous giving”, teaching is “an indispensable feature of Baha’i life”,
and it can become “a catalyst for an enduring process of spiritual transformation”. Next, however, we
are reminded to view our teaching work “in terms of community building”, as a “process that seeks to
raise capacity”. It is in this light that the House makes two very significant priority-shifting
statements. At the end of paragraph four, we are told that more important than whether contacts lead to

enrollments in the Baha’i community or simply participation, is that every soul feel welcome to
contribute to the better of society. For so long, teaching work was aimed at increasing the numerical
strength of the Baha’i community; now the priority is not declaration, but community building.
Secondly, in paragraph six, the House redefines receptivity as “willingness to participate in the process
of community building set in motion by the core activities”. Again, for so long, receptivity was a
person’s readiness to embrace Baha’u’llah; now the priority is their readiness to community building
activities.

The second group of reminder statements in the first half of the first section (paragraphs eight through
twelve) deal with the fundamental purpose behind the Ruhi curriculum and some characteristics about
those who serve as tutors. We are reminded that training institutes were called for fourteen years ago
in order to impart knowledge, insights, and skills required for expansion and consolidation, and the
Ruhi Institute fulfilled this call. We are reminded in paragraph nine that understanding the
implications of the Revelation “increase manifold when study and service are joined and carried out
concurrently”, a principle that is echoed three paragraphs later when discussing the way in which
capabilities of tutors develop. Finally in paragraph eleven, we are reminded that the force necessary
for change is generated through spiritual empowerment of individuals, through their constant effort to
apply knowledge to effect transformation.

To end section one, the House places priority this coming year on creating the capacity to offer the
junior youth program.

Section two has a low yet constant level of reminders, first about learning, and then about the nature
and role of the Administration. The culture of learning mentioned in paragraph nineteen, we are
reminded, is directly tied into the “construction of a divine civilization, which Guardian states is the
primary mission of the Faith.” Next, we look at Baha’i administration as a living organism, able to
evolve higher and higher degrees of complexity. Finally, we see the role of the Institutions in the Plan
and in reinforcing this mode of learning.

It is naturally expected that the bulk of reminders will come in section three, as two new areas of
endeavor are introduced and tied into the purpose of and the principles that govern our work.
Statements such as “[Baha’u’llah’s Revelation] calls for a profound change not only at the level of the
individual but also in the structure of society”, “every human being…can take inspiration from His
teachings”, “numerous groups and organizations…will contribute to the civilization destined to
emerge”, and “the world civilization...must achieve a dynamic coherence between the material and
spiritual requirements of life” remind us of the purpose and nature of our work, and that this
Revelation has come for all of humankind. We are then reminded directly that the value of social
action and public discourse is not to be judged by enrollments generated, but their purpose is to apply
the teachings and principles of the Faith to improve some aspect of social and economic life. And to
conclude section three, we are reminded that, over the next year, our priorities still lie with the current
Plan’s focus on expansion and consolidation.

Finally, in section four, we are beautifully reminded of ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s exhortation to “see all men as
friends”, and that all our work is really an expression of universal love.

The majority of guidance to individuals and institutions appears to come in large and spread out
clumps. These statements acknowledge obstacles and opportunities, and then give detailed guidance
about how to proceed.

Throughout the first section, we see each of the four cultural developments with some example of
guidance, in addition to the community building process in general. Examples of the four cultural
developments include understanding the logic underlying the illustrative example in Ruhi Book six to
present the essentials of the Faith, providing a spiritually empowering environment for study circles,
having patience and cooperation while efforts to educate children are systematized, and supporting JY
coordinators with resources persons. The guidance regarding community building in general comes
mainly in paragraphs five, seven, and twelve. The activities that drive this process are described, at
which point it is stated that indigenous human resources should soon sustain them. To specifically
meet this challenge, two points of guidance are offered: the institute process needs to be strengthened,
and the coordinators must bring both practical experience and dynamism to his or her efforts to
accompany those who serve as tutors.

Section two, paragraph twenty-one, addresses the fifth cultural advance, and contains guidance
regarding collective decision-making in the context of learning as the community’s mode of operation.
Specifically, reflection gatherings – cluster-wide, for tutors, for children’s class teachers, and for
animators – and cluster agencies (coordinators, ATC, ABM) are offered as a way to enable planning
and implementation to become more responsive to circumstances on the ground.

In section three, just before social action and participation in discourse are introduced, the House is
guiding the friends everywhere to reflect on the nature of the contributions which their communities
will make to the material and spiritual progress of society. It seems, then, that these two new areas of

activity are the fruit of such reflection, and the rest of the section contains points of guidance regarding
them. General examples include the first sentence of paragraph twenty-nine and the second sentence
of paragraph thirty, while detailed examples include “Efforts best being, then, on a modest scale” and
“sincerity in this respect in an imperative.”

And in the concluding section, the guidance that will always help overcome any challenge we may
face is to press on and bring Baha’u’llah’s message to waiting souls everywhere.

Encouragement and assurance of the potent spiritual forces at our aid, though by word count was the
least numerous within the message a whole, perhaps included the most powerful statements delivered
at very intentional moments, and provided a spiritual foundation upon which rests the entire message.
Each instance will be examined.

A few sentences into the message, we witness that the House says that the opportunity of this coming
year to strengthen the pattern of expansion and consolidation is a bounty that God has bestowed upon
His community. This sets the attitude and approach for all upcoming directives and calls for
achievement that are given for the coming year.

Two paragraphs later, we read the implication of the establishment of 1,500 IPGs and the first cultural
advance, the rise in capacity to converse with others on spiritual matters – that believers are “ready to
be led by the guiding Hand of the All-Merciful”. Throughout the message, all future achievements
recounted and goals given related to individual initiative will be with this implication in mind.

At their first mention of an Institution, in paragraph fifteen, they tell of “the tremendous power
inherent in the Administrative Order”, further evidenced by their assertion in paragraph twenty-four of

the energies released in 2001 when the Counsellors and their Auxiliaries gathered in the Holy Land.

Section two’s description of the roles and relationships of the Administrative Institutions are within this
context.

After describing the fifth cultural advance, learning as a mode of operation, we read its requirement
that all assume a posture of humility, “placing complete trust in God, reliant on His all-sustaining
power and confident in His unfailing assistance, knowing that He, and He alone, can change the gnat
into an eagle, the drop into a boundless sea.” The assurance of God’s assistance for individuals and
institutions that are characterized by a humble posture of learning is a foundational theme for all of
section two and three, as the maturation of Institutions are recounted and two new areas of activity are
introduced.

In the second paragraph of section three, we read that there is no greater joy than for a soul, yearning
for Truth, to find shelter in the stronghold of the Cause, draw strength from the unifying power of the
Covenant, and receive sustenance from Baha’u’llah’s life-giving message – this contrasted with
Baha’u’llah’s statement in the Iqan (and referenced in the 2008 Ridvan message) that there is no more
grievous oppression than for a soul, seeking the truth, should know not where to go for it and from
whom to seek it. The paragraph continues that the spirit of world solidarity, an indirect manifestation
of Baha’u’llah’s conception of the principle of the oneness of humankind, will animate numerous
groups and organizations. That all of humanity, “irrespective of whether they are counted among His
followers, can take inspiration from His teachings, benefiting from whatever gems of wisdom and
knowledge will aid them in addressing the challenges they face”, and the assurance that spiritual
forces, whether direct or indirect, are present, is a fundamental principle upon which social action and
participation in prevalent discourses are introduced.

And finally, in the fourth section and last paragraph of the message, we see a relatively large amount of
encouragement and assurance of potent spiritual forces, as the House reminds us that all that we are
doing is motivated by love for God and is “an expression of universal love achieved through the power
of the Holy Spirit.” They end their message by injecting spiritual vigor into the community of the
Greatest Name with this powerful, wholehearted, and moving assurance: “Never do you leave our
thoughts and prayers, and we will continue to implore the Almighty to reinforce you with His
wondrous grace.

CONCLUSION

The null hypothesis is rejected.

Mainly, I think that reading the Ridvan 2010 message with these six elements in mind helped me to
understand it in a greater depth. And with this understanding, I was able to better understand where it
came from. From seeing the type of language that the House uses in praising the believers and
understanding what really evokes pride and gratitude in their hearts, to getting a better sense of the
value priorities they are asking us to adopt at this current stage in the Divine Plan; from placing our
work in the context of building a New World Order, to reminding us of the spiritual forces if we but
arise and play our part; from contrasting our approach to community-building with that of the current
social orders, to addressing specific challenges we face with their wisdom borne of a collective
experience and a world-embracing vision; I felt my heart and mind connected this much more to an
Institution, and although thousands of miles away, I felt that they knew me and my cluster, and that I
was somehow involved in the writing of this message. I felt closer and closer to the “last refuge of a
tottering civilization”, the “source of all good”, and the implementator of the Divine Plan. Through

further understanding the message, I felt more connected to both its content and the process by which it
was written. And I felt more intimately tied with ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s Divine Plan.

Additionally, in this first attempt of mine to really analyze these six elements within a Plan message, I
feel I am better able now to naturally keep these elements in mind as I read and attempt to delve deep
into future Plan messages, most specifically the 28 Dec 2010 message. I hope that my understanding
of this next letter, and other Plan messages, will be strengthened because of this paper. This, really,
might be the most practically beneficial outcome of my endeavor.

Not really sure what the conclusion is meant for, but I will, at this point, mention a few observations
for any future undertaking of this nature (besides the glaring observation that the author should next
time figure out how to properly write a research paper, and learn what each section is for). The first is
regarding statistics. I simply based everything on word count percentage per paragraph. A few
obvious problems arise, let alone all the subtle ones if one was to delve into statistics. Because the
paragraph lengths vary, certain elements within certain paragraphs having either a skewed increase or
decrease in percentage. The basic trend I found was that analysis, and to a lesser extent reminder, was
more prevalent in larger paragraphs, and therefore had a relatively lower total percentage compared to
a percentage of total message word count. Encouragement tended to be in smaller paragraphs and the
opposite situation arose. Additionally, because many sentences had more than one element or neither,
total percentages per paragraph never once added to 100. I don’t think it influenced the discussion and
conclusions drawn, as the basic trends stayed the same for the most part (and I did include raw data vs
percentage data in the results section for your viewing pleasure), but if statistical analysis is to be done,
these discrepancies should be taken into account.

I think something exciting to do for next time would be an in-depth analysis on the regions of overlap
between various elements. I was contemplating including that as a seventh section in my discussion,
or even as the major theme of my conclusion section, but I realized how it would pretty much be as
long as what I’ve already written, and how this paper was already much longer than I imagined. In
general, call and guidance seemed to overlap, as did reminder and analysis. There were points in the
message where sentences had three or four elements within them (color overload, I know!). One brief
example occurs in paragraph eleven, where we are reminded, called, and guided, “that the quality of
the educational process fostered at the level of the study circle rise markedly over the next year”.

I suppose a concluding remark for each element is warranted at this point, to end this never-ending
paper.

Praise: What struck me originally upon my first read of the Ridvan message was how I really felt the
deep sense of pride and gratitude that the House of Justice had in its heart for the cultural
developments achieved. After this analysis, I realize that it wasn’t simply a second paragraph
phenomenon, but that each mention of cultural development throughout the message, in addition to
each Institution named and even early social action efforts, was accompanied by emotional words of
praise that served to further motivate the reader towards whatever action, achievement, or advance was
being praised.

Analysis: Not to repeat myself too much, it will suffice to simply add that the vision of the worldwide
Baha’i community was greatly enhanced by the exquisite analysis of our work within the context of the
world.

Call: Among the eleven pages, no one is left without a clear direction about how to proceed during this
upcoming year.

Reminder: As individuals and institutions, we are constantly striving to align our wills through the
Minor Plan with God’s will through His Major Plan, and these reminders prove invaluable to
understanding principles, priorities, and processes, and help us discern characteristics of the Faith that
are constant versus aspects that evolve and change. The House never ceases to lovingly aid in the
maturation of the individual, the community, and the institutions.

Guidance: As if they were two clusters away, the guidance from the Supreme Institution to address
specific challenges seems to be speaking directly to the reader’s conditions on the grassroots; and
further reinforces that they are deeply in touch with our struggles, our obstacles, and our conditions in
the field.

Encouragement: If each section were accorded equal weight, we would see a statistically massive
amount of encouragement and assurance, as it is the most prominent feature of the last paragraph – a
section within itself. While the first three sections provided the social insights on myriad topics,
section four injected spiritual energy directly into the veins of the community of the Greatest Name
and strengthened the tie that binds the Universal House of Justice with every single of this
community’s members.
