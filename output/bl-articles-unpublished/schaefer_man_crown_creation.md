Man — The Crown of Creation or its Destroyer?1

For many people it is becoming more and more difficult to believe that homo
sapiens is the Crown of Creation, given the destructiveness and bestiality of
which he is capable. History is a slaughter-house and the century just past was
bloodier than all the previous ones. In the course of his evolution, man has
developed from inferior life-forms into a civilised being; but woe betide us all
when the dark urges of his animal nature are unleashed and regain the upper
hand.

Nietzsche described civilisation as “a thin layer of apple peel over seething
chaos“, and often enough this “peel” has failed to resist those atavistic drives and
barbarianism has descended upon us. The crime of the Holocaust was committed
in the land of poets and philosophers, by a people who were regarded as among
the most cultivated in the world. After Auschwitz, after the genocides in
Cambodia and Rwanda, after the unthinkable atrocities in the Balkans and
elsewhere, one cannot but ask oneself: what is man, if he is capable of such
horrific things?

Many people take refuge in cynicism. There is talk of a “failed creation” 2; man
has been called a “biological freak” 3, an “evolutionary misfit” 4; “a naked ape” 5, „a
product of chance”, “a gipsy” whose duties and destiny “have not been written
down” 6. He has been condemned as a “miscarriage of nature” 7, as the ultimate
“monster” 8, in short, as a being which, weary of all utopias and visions of
paradise, is about to turn the earth, the Garden of Eden, into a sea of debris, a

lunar desolation. Owing to its “constitutive deficiencies” 9 the “monster” will, it is
feared, bring about the destruction of its own species and all living things in a
single final cataclysmic event. One may shudder at this shockingly negative utopia
but the same basic idea was already evident in the writings of Schopenhauer, who
called man “a hideous wild beast” 10 and believed “that it would be better if we did
not exist” 11. The human sciences, those known as “anthropologies from below”,
also see only the lower, destructive characteristics of the human race. They
reduce man to his drives and see him as a being that is “Beyond Freedom and
Dignity” 12.

But this verdict is one-sided and therefore wrong. One must not blind oneself
to the fact that man also has another, very different side to his character. Since he
walked onto the stage, his genius has created works that will endure throughout
the ages. In all cultures there have been individuals, spiritual leaders and
trailblazers in the development of true humanity, who have guided mankind
towards loftier realms.         Man also has the potential to be an angelic being:
“Wonders are many, and none is more wonderful than man”, says Sophocles 13,
and similar words in praise of man abound in world literature.

Like the ancient Roman god Janus, man has two faces, “two natures” 14: “he
has the animal side as well as the angelic side” 15. He is ambivalent, capable of
both good and evil. This ambivalence, the greatness and the vile baseness of
man 16, is a topic that has been dealt with at length by philosophers and poets and
also in the sacred scriptures of the religions:

> “No animal changes as often as he;
> now soaring upwards, now sinking into abasement”,

says the Greek poet Menander 17. An

“unfortunate being, midway between angel and beast”

is how he is described by a German poet. 18

The question as to man’s ultimate nature and the purpose of his existence —
which Immanuel Kant calls the most important of the four fundamental questions
of philosophy 19 — extends into the realm of metaphysics. It cannot be answered
by science, and even philosophical anthropology, which takes us a little further,
does not provide any certain answers. Statements that go beyond what we are
able to discern through experience and rational thinking are to be found in the
sacred writings of the religions. Despite all the differences that exist in matters of
detail, these answers from a transcendental source display remarkable
similarities, even though the essence of man is not completely unveiled in them.
According to Baha-’u’lla-h, man is as inscrutable as the essence of God:

“Man is My mystery, and I am his mystery.” 20

He calls the human soul “a heavenly gem whose reality the most learned of
men hath failed to grasp, and whose mystery no mind, however acute, can ever
hope to unravel” 21. Of all created things, it is man who is closest to God, because
in the act of creation God has engraved on him His “image”. 22 Therefore, “in him
are potentially revealed all the attributes and names of God” 23. Man is the
ontological summit of the universe 24; he is God’s representative 25 and, as it is
stated in the Qur’a-n, his “vicegerent (khali-fa) in the earth” 26. Created “to know
Thee and to worship Thee” 27, man is potentially “the most perfect of all created
things” 28 and “a mirror of His [God’s] own Self” 29. He should purify himself from
all transitory things, from all corrupt desires and passions and become a clear
and polished “mirror” that can “reflect the glory of the names and attributes of

God” 30. Man is endlessly perfectible and he is called upon to attain perfection, as
set out in the Gospel of Matthew:

> Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is
> perfect. 31

He is called upon “to soar above the world of matter” 32, “he should be free and
emancipated from the captivity of the world” 33, and free himself from the fetters
of earthly existence 34 so as to “gain the victory over your own selves (an-nafs al-
amma-ra)” 35, since the self is the source of all egotism, greed, hatred and suffering.
The self “is the ego, the dark, animalistic heritage each one of us has, the lower
nature that can develop into a monster of selfishness, brutality, lust and so on.” 36.
A person can only attain true happiness if he succeeds in liberating himself from
this “bondage” 37 and his spiritual nature gains the upper hand, enabling him, at
the hour of death, “to ascend, in the utmost purity and sanctity and with absolute
detachment, to the throne of the Most High” 38. God’s revelation is “the Source of
his [man’s] education” 39. One of the names of God is “Al-Murabiyu’l-Akbar”, the
“Greatest Educator” 40. Hence, the Manifestations are the “divine educators of
mankind”:

> the heaven of God’s Will . . . hath been sent down that which is the
> most effective instrument for the education of the whole human
> race. 41

Man is not merely a highly developed animal. Through his power of reason,
his rational, immortal soul, which is a “sign of God” 42, he is on a higher level in the
hierarchy of creation. He is the only created being that has a share in the spiritual
world 43, but he can only achieve his destiny, his salvation, under the Covenant of

God — that eternal Covenant 44 that the prophets and messengers of God have
continually renewed. Without divine revelation and guidance (huda-), without
“proper education” he remains “deprived … of that which he doth inherently
possess”. 45 Revelation, „the true education” 46 can overcome man’s ignorance
about his true self, enlighten him and cause him to attain his “high destiny” and
his “lofty … station” 47.

Man must consciously decide to follow this pattern of life, and he has the
freedom to do so. Whereas the animal is a “captive of nature” 48, man has been
granted freedom. 49 The determining characteristic of human existence and
human dignity consists in man’s ability, irrespective of the prevailing biological
and social conditions, to subdue his vital urges, to control and sublimate his
impulses so that these imperfections become useful and “are transformed into
human perfections” 50. He has the choice between right and wrong, the potential
to do good or to do evil. 51 This image of man is a verdict against the widespread
delusion of innocence, the popular idea that nobody is responsible for anything,
that it is only society or structures that are at fault, the secular dogma of the
“good individual” being victimised by “evil society”.

Baha-’u’lla-h’s image of man does not concur with the naive, optimistic
Enlightenment motto “Man is good!” He is only potentially good, but he is
certainly not predestined to be good, with peace and happiness automatically
ensuing if the right social conditions prevail. The idea that it is only “relations”
that prevent the individual from being a “good person” — as expressed by Bertolt
Brecht in his “Ballad of the Good Man” 52 — is mistaken. Even in the best of all
possible worlds man’s happiness and peace on earth are unattainable unless man
turns around, transforms himself and, by the grace of God, rises unto that for
which he was created.

However, man is also not “framed out of … crooked wood” 53, he is not of a
“fallen nature”, not fundamentally evil and corrupt. Adam’s fall from grace does
not mean that man is inherently sinful. Each individual is born into the world in a
state of complete purity, but his animal nature means that he is “prone to evil” 54.
Existentially he is a sinner (a-thim) 55, because as long as he is still on the path
towards his goal, which is perfection, he is always deficient compared with what
he has the potential to become.

The ambivalence of the spirit of man is that “it is capable of the utmost
perfection, or it is capable of the utmost imperfection” 56. If his spiritual capacities
are developed, he can become a “mirror” of divine perfection and “the most noble
of the existing beings”. If these capacities of the spirit are neglected and “it
acquires vices, it becomes the most degraded existence” 57. The spectrum of
human existence is extremely broad: with God’s grace man can be exalted and
“raised above the angels” 58, but he can also sink into depths of degradation
“which the meanest of creatures have never reached” 59. As Aristotle says,
“Brutality is less bad than vice, but more fearful.” 60 The diabolical side of human
nature 61, la bête humaine, the dark aspects of the world, are thus certainly not
ignored.

The required way of life is a happy medium between ascetic rejection of the
world 62 and Baudelaire’s utopian vision of a life of “luxury, idleness and
voluptuousness” 63. Baha-’u’lla-h’s image of man is incompatible with the idea that
the purpose of life is the satisfaction of urges and enjoyment of pleasure, 64 the

61   Satan, symbolised by the serpent, is a metaphor for the attachment of the soul to the human

world (see ‘Abdu’l-Baha-, Some Answered Questions 30:6).
62   Practising “asceticism” (al-riyad.a-t ash-shaqqa) is prohibited for Baha-’i-s (see Baha-’u’lla-h, Tablets 6:37;

> Baha-’u’lla-h, Kita-b-i-Aqdas 36; Baha-’u’lla-h, Epistle to the Son of the Wolf , pp. 49f.). The idea of

64   The French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) sees diversion or

insatiable striving for material prosperity and luxury, the cult of the orgasm and
the cult of Mammon; in short, the modern lifestyle which has infected the whole
world and which is causing the sense of solidarity, people’s readiness to help each
other, to wither and die out. A person who has — as the Qur’a-n puts it — “made a
God of his passions” 65, and individuals who are so caught up in selfish desires
that “like the bats of darkness, they lift not their heads from their couch except to
pursue the transient things of the world” 66, have, according to Baha-’u’lla-h, failed
to recognise the true purpose of their existence. The only lasting thing that man
can attain here on earth is “love of God” 67 and “a pure, kindly and radiant
heart” 68.

But when will deficient man 69, who, like Goethe’s “sorcerer’s apprentice”, is
no longer able to solve the existential problems of humanity, change for the
better? The survival of mankind depends on a new ethic and a substantially new
way of thinking. The longing for the renewal of man and human society 70, the
dream of a New Man 71 is as old as the hills; it is a history of hopes and
disappointments. The New Man expected by Christian eschatology at the Time of
the End, has been proclaimed to be imminent again and again — by the
philosophers of the Enlightenment, by Jean-Jacques Rousseau 72, Friedrich
Nietzsche and Karl Marx, by the Russian intelligentsia and the Latin American
revolutionaries 73 and by the New-Age movement. But the birth of this new man
seems more questionable than ever, and the idea of the recreation of man
through genetic engineering is no less of a nightmare than the human breeding
programme promoted by the Nazis.

Scientists who were searching for a new ethic and a new man 74 came to the
despondent conclusion that: “Compared with the task of changing the sons of
Adam, the splitting of the atom seems like child’s play” 75. Baha-’u’lla-h says that
the only thing that “is endowed with the capacity required for so great and far-
reaching a change” is the new “Word of God” 76. He promises mankind’s
transformation in the fullness of time:
