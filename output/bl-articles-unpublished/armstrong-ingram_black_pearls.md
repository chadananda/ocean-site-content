“Black Pearls”: The African Household Slaves of a Nineteenth Century Iranian Merchant
Family.

Slavery in the Middle East can be, and often is, approached in terms of laws and
diplomacy, statistics and economics, as the availability of sources most readily supports
such a discussion. What is less usual, and more difficult, is to attempt to examine the
lives of individual slave: to give names, faces, and personalities to slavery.

Apart from some of the poster children for the vaunted different character of slavery in
the Middle East – prominent concubines and state officials – there are relatively few
sources to allow us to discuss the lives of particular slaves. I will attempt here to
reconstruct something of the lives of some African slaves owned by a merchant family of
Shiraz in the 1800s. In particular, I will discuss how they fit into the social structures of
households and, as the rationale for the legitimacy of slavery in the Islamic world was
that it constituted a vehicle for conversion, their religious identity.

The importation of African slaves into Iran was a long-established commonplace. Slaves
were shipped directly, and pilgrims brought them back from the markets in the Hijaz. By
the mid-nineteenth century, the British had extracted from the Persian crown the same
sort of pro forma interdiction of the slave trade, with an associated grant of maritime
police authority to themselves, that they obtained from other rulers in the region. While
such achievements assuaged anti-slavery sentiment at home, in the field they were more

an inconvenience than a hindrance to the flow of goods for which the court itself would
remain a leading consumer.

In Iran there was some use of African slaves in directly instrumental economic roles, but
this was not widespread. African slaves were mostly absorbed into the market for
domestic labor. As in the Ottoman regions, a distinction of desirability and hence price
was made between ‘Ethiopian’ slaves and other slaves from Africa. The former were
considered much superior in their capabilities to the latter and as a result were more
likely to receive an education and to fill positions of trust.

Yershater remarked of Nasir al-Din Shah’s reign that: “Internally, the rise of the Bab and
the persecution of his followers, and the disturbances following the aborted concession of
the tobacco monopoly to a British company, were the two notable events threatening the
status quo of the social order.” (1) The family whose slaves form the topic of this
discussion was closely connected to both these events.

Mirza Muhammad Hasan Shirazi who issued the fatwa against the Tobacco Regie was a
close relative; and a member of the family itself, Siyyid Ali-Muhammad, was the founder
of the radical Babi religion and executed for his claims in 1850. Subsequently various
family members were prominent not only in their kinsman’s faith but also in its claimed
(and, in Iran, equally stigmatised) successor the Baha’i Faith. Other family members
remained, or became, indifferent, or even hostile to these religious innovations.

The descendants of Siyyid Ali-Muhammad’s maternal uncles and brothers-in-law became
known as the Afnans and over time this designation transmuted into a family surname.
In the 1840s when Siyyid Ali-Muhammad began his religious activities, the family
already had trading interests throughout Iran and in India. By the decade of the Tobacco
Revolt, their interests spread from Hong Kong to Cairo.

Over the decades the family was not only involved in trade (and religion for some
members) but had connections of blood and marriage with government officials. In the
early 1900s, younger members were sent to such new educational opportunities as the
American College in Beirut and became prominent in many fields and throughout the
region. For example, Hussein Afnan was Secretary to the Council of Ministers of the
Iraqi government in the 1920s and later served in the diplomatic corps. His wife was the
noted promoter of education and international representative of Iraq, Bediah Afnan. (2)

Thus, this is not a typical merchant family, and that is why there are sources to work
from. This has long been a family with a strong sense of its place in history and, for
some members, a belief in the numinous nature of persons and events. When people
believe that events are imbued with epochal significance they note and value even the
most everyday of details surrounding those events. One does not have to agree with their
interpretation to make use of the narratives they produce as a source for the taken-for-
granteds that would not usually be considered worth recording.

By the later decades of the twentieth century one member of the family, Abu’l-Qasim
Afnan, had come to be considered “the true custodian in this age of the traditions of the
Afnan family.” (3) He was assisted in this effort by the extensive private archives held
by members of the family, archives consisting of documents contemporary to events and
later chronicles and memoirs.

In the 1980s, Abu’l-Qasim Afnan wrote a narrative of certain family slaves which
circulated in near-print form in East Africa. An edited version of this account was
published in the United States in 1988 under the title Black Pearls, with a second edition
being published in 1999. I shall use the near-print version as my primary source text for
this discussion as the less mediated one. (4)

The text runs the gamut from sections based on cited primary and secondary sources to
those which simply record Abu’l-Qasim’s personal memories. It is not a methodical
work of history; neither is it simply a memoir. It seems evident that Abu’l-Qasim is
concerned to present an ‘accurate’ narrative but his approach is less than fully conscious.

Not surprisingly, the main thread running through Abu’l-Qasim’s account is the loyalty
and devotion of the slaves to ‘their’ family, and in a few instances to the family
associated religious movements. Yet this unquestioned assumption in itself leads to the
naïve inclusion in the narrative of clues that allow us to go beyond it. Certainly, what we
can recover from this text of the life experience of these slaves is merely fragmentary and
suggestive, but it is nonetheless valuable in trying to give some voice to their experience.

Fortunately, our interrogation of this principle text in the case of some of the slaves can
draw on published texts and memoirs more contemporaneous to the events and, indeed,
on other versions of family tradition attributed to Abu’l-Qasim. In addition, the process
of transforming the near-print text into a formal publication in 1988 involved
correspondence between Abu’l-Qasim and the publisher which further elucidates his
account.

One area in which this family is completely typical of the propertied classes of its time
and place is that the family tree frequently doubles back upon itself. In addition,
individuals often accrued a string of honorifics and sobriquets. I will refer to individuals
in this discussion by the simplest version of their name that uniquely identifies them and
will attempt to unravel the relationships between them as necessary.

The two slaves for which we have most sources other than Abu’l-Qasim’s narrative are
Mubarak and Fiddih as they served Siyyid Ali-Muhammad and his wife Khadijih Bagum.
Abu’l-Qasim devotes eight pages to Mubarak, twice as many as to any other slave; and
almost four pages to Fiddih, more than twice as many as to any other woman slave.
These were the two slaves closest to the centre of numinousness and so most touched
with significance thereby.

According to Abu’l-Qasim’s narrative, the “Ethiopian” Mubarak was purchased as a
child of five from slave traders by Haji Mirza Abu’l-Qasim, a brother of Khadijih
Bagum. He received “training and upbringing” which are described as “exemplary.”
Abu’l-Qasim states, “I vividly recall my grandmother (the daughter of Haji Mirza Abu’l-
Qasim) often remark about his extreme modesty and politeness. She would recount that,
while intelligent, quick of understanding and with great capacity to learn, he yet
displayed the utmost meakness and humility, showing kindness to all. She would also
describe his manners and demeanour as being regal and well befitting his residing in the
holy house [of the Bab].” [AQ:9]

Siyyid Muhammad-Rida, Siyyid Ali-Muhammad’s father, died when his son was a child
and Siyyid Ali-Muhammad’s mother’s brother, Haji Mirza Siyyid Ali took responsibility
for him. When Siyyid Ali-Muhammad was fifteen, he formally entered his uncle’s
business, shortly thereafter moved to Bushire, and subsequently assumed management of
the company trading-house there. In the spring of 1841, he settled the books and left for
a pilgrimage to the holy cities of Iraq. At the urging of his mother, he returned to Shiraz
in 1842.

It was then, when Mubarak was supposed to be nineteen, that Siyyid Ali-Muhammad
purchased him from Mirza Abu’l-Qasim. Apparently a bill of sale is still held within the
family and the purchase price was 14 tumans. By this time, Siyyid Ali-Muhammad had
substantively ‘retired’ from business to concentrate on study and writing on religious
matters. However, there were still affairs to be settled and Mubarak acted as Siyyid Ali-

Muhammad’s agent. “He was delegated to collect and settle these accounts, and
discharged these duties superbly.” [AQ:9] Mubarak also delivered messages for Siyyid
Ali-Muhammad, greeted his guests at the house door, acted as their escort within the
house, and waited on them and his master.

Siyyid Ali-Muhammad not only acquired a slave in 1842, but a full household. In
August, he married Khadijih Bagum. For her he “acquired” (to use Abu’l-Qasim’s term)
“an Ethiopian girl of tender years (probably no older than seven years of age)” named
Fiddih. The new household thus consisted of Siyyid Ali-Muhammad, Khadijih Bagum,
Mubarak, Fiddih, and also Siyyid Ali-Muhammad’s mother, Fatimih Bagum. The
‘house’ in which they lived was not free-standing, but consisted of two storeys of rooms
surrounding a courtyard. It was the house in which Siyyid Ali-Muhammad had been
born and it interconnected with the adjoining houses of other family members including
that of his uncle, Siyyid Ali.

Before considering further the lives of Mubarak and Fiddih it would be useful to look
more closely at the formation of this household and their place in that formation.

Khadijih Bagum was the daughter of Mirza Ali, the brother of Siyyid Ali-Muhammad’s
mother’s father. Mirza Ali’s house was adjacent to that of Siyyid Ali-Muhammad’s
maternal uncle, Siyyid Ali. Khadijih Bagum and Siyyid Ali-Muhammad were about the
same age and had played together as children. At the time of their marriage in 1842,

Siyyid Ali-Muhammad was 22 years old. If Khadijih Bagum was in her early twenties,
that was a rather advanced age for a bride of her day. Then we also have the puzzle of
why Siyyid Ali-Muhammad bought Fiddih for her, a young girl who had to be trained in
household duties from scratch, rather than Khadijih Bagum bringing a fully trained slave
with her from her natal household.

Apart from the family traditions and documents recorded in Abu’l-Qasim’s narrative in
the 1980s, there are earlier sources on the household. H. M. Balyuzi – whose mother was
an Afnan - wrote a biography of Siyyid Ali-Muhammad which was published in 1973. In
the Foreword, he expresses his “deep gratitude’ to Abu’l-Qasim Afnan for making
available “the chronicle-history and the autobiography of his father, the late Haji Mirza
Habibu’llah” and other family documents.(5) Balyuzi also prepared a short biography of
Khadijih Bagum which was posthumously published in 1981. However, according to the
foreword written by Robert Balyuzi, the work “is largely based on the written narrative of
Abu’l-Qasim Afnan.” (6) Indeed, the first paragraph states:

Khadijih Bagum, would at times recount the story of her glorious but tragic life to the
younger members of her family. Decades later, a niece, Maryam-Sultan Bagum,
daughter of Haji Mirza Abu’l-Qasim, recalled all that she had heard from her saintly
aunt; her grandson, Abu’l-Qasim Afnan, has now put on paper these recollections. (7)

Balyuzi’s work seems to be in large part, at least, a translation of his cousin’s notes.
Thus, the isnad for Afnan family traditions on this household does seem to always
connect to us through Abu’l-Qasim.

Yet there is another source which lies outside the family. In 1871, Munirih Khanum
(who was on her way to Palestine to marry Abbas Effendi, the son of Baha’u’llah, the
founder of the Baha’i Faith) visited Khadijih Bagum in Shiraz. There are two surviving
versions of this visit. In the early 1920s, Lady Blomfield, an Englishwoman visiting
Palestine, collected oral accounts of the history of the Babi and Baha’i faiths.(8) Among
those she interviewed was Munirih Khanum whose daughters spoke fluent English.
Thus, Blomfield’s notes of the translation of Munirih Khanum’s oral account should be
reasonably reliable. Munirih Khanum also wrote her own brief account of her life around
the same time and included in it another retelling of her visit to Shiraz.(9)

Both the Afnan tradition accounts and the Munirih Khanum ones tend to read like oft-told
tales. The various versions have set scenes, even phrases, in common. This makes all the
more likely to be illuminating any aspect which does not fit the standardised script.

This is what seems to happen in the Munirih Khanum versions. The elements are the
same, but the chronology is different. But then Munirih Khanum had no reason to report
anything other than her best memory of what Khadijih Bagum had told her. The Afnans
may believe they only intend to do the same, but they are engaged not just with the
narrative but with the family’s reputation and how any version of events supports that.

There need not be anything conscious here; it is simply that one line of descent for the
narrative of the formation of this household branches off many decades earlier than the
other and was not enmeshed in the broader later narrative formation involved in creating
the Afnan ‘story.’

The Balyuzi versions have the bethrothal and marriage of Siyyid Ali-Muhammad and
Khadijih Bagum taking place after Siyyid Ali-Muhammad returns to Shiraz in 1842.
Munirih Khanum’s versions tell a significantly different story.

In both Balyuzi’s (probably in effect Abu’l-Qasim’s) biographical account of Khadijih
Bagum and in Munirih Khanum’s accounts of her visit to Shiraz there is a retelling,
purportedly in the words of Khadijih Bagum , of two dreams. One dream presages her
engagement; the other occurs when Siyyid Ali-Muhammad is in Bushire. The
Balyuzi/Afnan account states that the Bushire dream occurred first and the engagement
dream happened after Siyyid Ali-Muhammad returned to Shiraz from Iraq. Both Munirih
Khanum versions place the engagement dream before the Bushire one. All accounts
agree that the engagement took place very shortly after the predictive dream and the one
written personally by Munirih Khanum states explicitly that the betrothal came before the
journey to Bushire. [MK2:33]

Thus the Balyuzi/Afnan account has the betrothal and marriage occurring shortly after
one another in 1842, but both Munirih Khanum versions put the bethrothal before Siyyid
Ali-Muhammad went to Bushire and the marriage after he returned. The Munirih

Khanum versions solve the problem of why Khadijih Bagum remained unmarried at such
an ‘advanced’ age. By these versions she was actually betrothed in her mid-teens.

It seems likely that with Siyyid Ali-Muhammad being sent to Bushire it was thought that
the groom was too young for an immediate assumption of the role of head of a household
and that the marriage itself should be delayed until he was more established in business.
It may be that part of his mother’s concern that he return from Iraq to Shiraz in 1842 –
something it seems that he had to be strongly persuaded into doing - was this long drawn
out betrothal that she had arranged.

Afnan accounts emphasise the high respect in which Siyyid Ali-Muhammad was held by
the family and there are contemporary letters that bear this out for some family members.
Yet, the oral account by Munirih Khanum suggests that this regard was not monolithic
and had its limits. According to Munirih Khanum, Khadijih Bagum told her: “We were
three sisters; our father was the least prosperous of the great-uncles of my Beloved. We
were far from being wealthy when we were married, as the world counts wealth.
Therefore there was little joy amongst our relations and friends at our union.” [MK1:77]

This is certainly not the complexion that later Afnan accounts apply to events, but it has a
considerable ring of authenticity to it. Khadijih Bagum is said to have commented that at
the start of their marriage Siyyid Ali-Muhammad:

… had no definite occupation. He spent most of his time in the upper chamber of the
house, engaged in devotions. At times, he went in the morning to his uncle’s trading-
house in the Saray-i-Gunruk (Customs Serai). And some afternoons he would go for a
walk in the fields outside the city and come home at sunset. It was his wont to write his
letters or his meditations in the early part of the evening, after performing the obligatory
prayers pertaining to that period of the night. [B/A:9-10]

That Siyyid Ali-Muhammad ceased to engage in the business of this energetically
mercantile family; that Khadijih Bagum’s brother sold Mubarak to him at an absurdly
low price; that she did not bring a slave from her natal household and made do with an
untrained, young child; and that they seem to have lived fairly separately from the rest of
the family, even though their accommodation connected with other, presumably much
better equipped, households; all suggest the likelihood of both financial strictures and less
than total family harmony.

Mubarak and Fiddih were thus brought into a newly forming separate household where
they would have found themselves both the major labor sources and significant personal
supports without full participation in the broader family service network. The lasting
effect of this can be seen particularly in the case of Fiddih.

Abu’l-Qasim states that:

Fiddih received instruction from and was educated by the mother and wife of the Bab. At
an early age, she showed a prodigious mastery of manners and etiquette. She also
excelled in the culinary arts and acquired a reputation for needlework and embroidery.

From the start, Fiddih was regarded by young and old alike as a member of the Bab’s
family, and was treated accordingly. She, herself, was enthralled by Khadijih Bagum …
who also loved her dearly. Such was their affection for one another that neither could
bear to be parted for even a short time. [AQ:16]

Yet, it is presumably through Abu’l-Qasim that we also have the recollection of Khadijih
Bagum of one day in 1844 when Siyyid Ali-Muhammad “asked that dinner be served
earlier” and “Fiddih, the servant who did all the cooking, was so informed.” On the
following day: “At sunrise Fiddih took the samovar and tea-things to the room of my
mother-in-law and, as usual, he went to his mother’s room to take tea.” [B/A:10;12] This
was when Fiddih was about nine years old. It sounds like Fiddih had plenty of work to
do, probably more than her ‘Ethiopian’ status would have required of her in a more
substantial household, and certainly more than a ‘member’ of such a family. After all,
she was a child doing “all the cooking” in a household with two adult women.

As things turned out, the separate household was not of long duration - lasting only just
over two years. Khadijih Bagum give birth to a son in 1843, who was either still-born or
died shortly after birth. And then in 1844, Siyyid Ali-Muhammad began his public
religious career leading to his arrest, confinement and execution. In late1844, he left to

make the hajj taking Mubarak with him. On his return he was arrested and, apart from
some brief interludes in the first year, would be under increasing confinement until his
execution in 1850.

These years saw both increasing knowledge of his religious claims and increasing
persecution by religious and civil authorities of those who accepted them. He was
removed from Shiraz in 1846, and did not see any member of this little household
thereafter.

With the breakup of the household, Mubarak and Fiddih were charged by Siyyid Ali-
Muhammad with looking after his mother and wife and their roles changed more to that
of personal attendants to persons who were living in provisional situations. It was often
unsafe to live in their former house and the two women resided in one or other of the
adjoining houses of their relatives.

While Fatimih Bagum, Siyyid Ali-Muhammad’s mother, remained in Shiraz “Fiddih
devoted much time to nursing her and looking after every detail of her life.” But when
Fatimih Bagum left Shiraz, then:

… Fiddih was able to dedicate herself completely to Khadijih Bagum to the exception of
all others in her life. Never did she develop any warm friendship with anyone else, even
though there were a number of servants in the houses of the uncles of the Bab. Never
would she appear in public except in attendance on Khadijih Bagum. [AQ:16]

According to Abu’l-Qasim, this reported devotion to Khadijih Bagum was so pronounced
that:

She would always beseech Khadijih Bagum to pray that she would not continue to live
after her beloved lady. Fiddih could not even contemplate life without her. In her
prayers, Fiddih would supplicate God to accept her wish that, so long it was destined for
the wife of the Bab to remain in this mortal world, that Fiddih too, would remain to serve
her, but that she would not live to see the day when her mistress was no longer with her.
[AQ:17]

And, indeed, when Khadijih Bagum died in 1882: “While arrangements were still in
progress for the funeral and interment, true to her soul’s desire, the spirit of Fiddih
winged its flight to join her beloved mistress. [AQ:18] The Balyuzi account states that:
“… strangely, the faithful servitor, Fiddih, died two hours after the death of her mistress,
in the same house.” [B/A:35]

The tone of these references nicely balances the narrative claim that Khadijih Bagum
died of grief when a relative failed to come and escort her to visit Baha’u’llah as
promised. Actually, both women are said to have died of dysentery: Khadijih Bagum
probably being somewhat over 60 and Fiddih around 47. That the personal attendant of
someone afflicted with dysentery should also contract the illness is no surprise; and that
the complaint should be fatal for either or both even less so.

One is tempted by Abu’l-Qasim’s description of Fiddih to consider her a child so
traumatised by the experience of enslavement that she attached herself totally to a
‘protector’ and grew up to be a withdrawn, asocial person. Yet, as the widow of Siyyid
Ali-Muhammad, Khadijih Bagum was a person of considerable interest and influence in
the religious circles that looked to her late husband as a numinous figure. She was visited
by many women over the decades, acting as their guide to the house in which she had
lived during her marriage and recounting tales of her days with Siyyid Ali-Muhammad.
As Fiddih would have waited on this parade of visitors, she may not have been quite so
singularly focused on Khadijih Bagum or such a social isolate as family tradition paints.
Abu’l-Qasim mentions a letter from Munirih Khanum to Khadijih Bagum referring to
Munirih Khanum’s “gratitude for the services rendered by Fiddih” during her stay in
Shiraz in 1871 and conveying warm greetings to her.

As for Mubarak, after the enforced departure of Siyyid Ali-Muhammad he served
Fatimih Bagum and Khadijih Bagum. When Fatimih Bagum moved to Karbila in the
1850s she asked Mubarak to go with her and he died there at about the age of forty.

Abu’l-Qasim notes in the historical introduction that precedes his account of the slaves
that in nineteenth century Iran:

The privileged classes – notably the rulers and their ministers – made eunuchs of young
boys and sent them to serve in their private households, allowing them to mingle freely

with the women folk. The eunuchs were well respected and trusted by the ladies of the
house and were often taken into their full confidence. In Iran, the nobility and the gentry
too, kept eunuchs. Unlike ordinary slaves, some of these eunuchs were promoted and
came to occupy places of prominence in society.” [AQ:5-6]

Despite this comment in his introduction, there is no mention in the narrative of the
obvious fact that with his close relationship with Fatimih Bagum and Khadijih Bagum
and others of their female relatives, Mubarak must have been a eunuch. That he was
‘Ethiopian,’ highly educated, given full confidence, mingled freely with the ladies of the
household, and even his young age at death all suggest the same conclusion.

There is another slave whom Abu’l-Qasim eulogises who seems likely to have been a
eunuch. Abu’l-Qasim says that Mas’ud was purchased by Haji Mirza Siyyid Muhammad
“from slave-traders who had abducted him from Zanzibar.” Abu’l-Qasim describes
Mas’ud as “but a youth” when pruchased, but he must have been even younger than this
suggests as Siyyid Muhammad sent him to a maktab. Abu’l-Qasim says that he there
“acquired a broad education with a good grasp of sums and diction.” In addition: “Over
the years he became renowned in Shiraz as a sportsman, and particularly in
horsemanship. Mas’ud enjoyed cooking and would often prepare exquisite dishes which
were admired by all.” [AQ:20]

After Mubarak left Shiraz, Mas’ud “would assist the wife of the Bab … with all matters
that required attention outside the house.” In contrast to the very personal devotion

attributed to Mubarak and even more so to Fiddih, Abu’l-Qasim comments of Mas’ud
that his “love and devotion to the members of the family were unaffected by the death of”
Siyyid Muhammad.

In the 1880s Mas’ud escorted Khadijih-Sultan Bagum, a daughter of Siyyid Muhammad,
on the hajj and then on to Palestine. They stayed there for six months and Mas’ud wished
to remain and enter the household of Baha’u’llah, but he was told to return with Khadijih-
Sultan Bagum. On the return journey they spent several months in the house of Haji
Mirza Siyyid Hasan, a brother of Khadijih Bagum, in Beirut. Khadijih-Sultan Bagum’s
sister was married to Siyyid Hasan and had “played a major role in the training and
instruction of Mas’ud” when in her father’s household. They completed their journey to
Shiraz via Bombay.

Mas’ud was thus Khadijih-Sultan Bagum’s escort for a trip that encompassed Mecca,
Palestine, Beirut, and Bombay with travel between by land and sea, the whole lasting
around a year and the lady arriving home with her reputation presumably intact. It seems
almost inconceivable that Mas’ud was not a eunuch, yet there is a twist to this tale.

Abu’l-Qasim states that when Mas’ud got back to Shiraz he “became greatly distressed
by his separation from Baha’u’llah. So intense were his feelings of sadness that they
could not be contained.” Mas’ud “withdrew from the society of his friends and secluded
himself.” The remedy applied by the family raises some questions. They “made every
effort to comfort and console him. They urged him to marry, hoping that this new life

would make him less despondent and sad.” The way Abu’l-Qasim describes his response
is intriguing: “Although he was spiritually unprepared to marry, he conceded to their
wishes and married an Ethiopian girl called Golchihrih, who was also in the household.”
To add to the questions, Abu’l-Qasim continues: “To them was born a daughter whom
they named Sa’idih.”

The remedy was less than effective, however, as, “Despite his new life and the love and
devotion shown him by his family, Mas’ud only longed for another opportunity to attain
the presence of Baha’u’llah.” And, soon after his marriage, he died.

So what happened? Golchihrih was of the household and she undoubtedly had a daughter.
One might, though, reasonably question the paternity. If she had become a mother by a
member of the household, the child would have had inheritance rights. The marriage
patterns of the family show how careful they were to maintain property within controlled
lines. If she gave birth as a married woman there would be a presumption that the child
was the child of her husband, even if he were “spiritually unprepared to marry.” The
social fiction of marital parentage would prevail unless one of the principal parties
refused to let it.

Mas’ud may have rendered his final service to the family by claiming to have started one
of his own. Interestingly, when the daughter of that family, Sa’idih, married one Faraj,
also of the household, her wedding was jointly celebrated with two Afnan family

marriages. Like her mother, Sa’idih had one child, a son named Mas’ud who lived in
Shiraz until his death in 1968.

And what of her mother, Golchihrih? Here we enter territory encompassed by Abu’l-
Qasim’s personal memory:

The author remembers Golchihrih distinctly. She was a tall, slender woman with an
attractive countenance. She was jolly, talkative and very fond of the water-pipe. She
came to the house of my father to care for my mother and lived with us for a number of
years until her death. [AQ:21]

At the end of his memoir of the Afnan slaves, Abu’l-Qasim returns to Golchihrih in the
midst of more general closing comments:

Most of these innocent victims of slavery went through life remembering and cherishing
their mother tongues. … The majority of these people also remembered their homes and
childhood days. Golchihrih, … whom the author distinctly remembers, would hold me
on her lap and tell me about her home. Not once was she able to finish her story without
my breaking down and weeping.

Golchihrih would longingly describe the wide tree-lined avenues of her native town and
the large home in which she lived. She would say: “There was a brook running outside
our house where I would play with my brothers and sisters. Our parents used to warn us

to beware and keep away from the white man. One day, while playing with my friends,
we spotted two camel riders approaching. As they drew near, the older children
recognized who they were and fled. I could not keep up with them and was soon caught.
One of them put a knife to my throat and threatened me. I dared not say a word. They
took me away and eventually, I was shipped to Bushihr.” She would also describe her
family – father, mother, aunts and uncles – and the love and warmth which existed
among them. She remembered that she also had a new-born brother who was very dear
to her. [AQ:29]

While at one level Golchihrih’s story is a variant of the caregiver’s traditional warning to
children about behaving or they may be stolen by ‘gypsies,’ the circus, or the ‘boogie-
man’ – himself the naturalised representative of the Bugis, the feared pirates, and slave
traders, of the South China Seas – there is not the solace that this is a fiction. It is the
testimony of one who was herself stolen; one who for a minor lapse in childhood
correctness (she did not, could not, “keep away”) lost home and family forever – but not
her memory, her knowledge that her life could have been, should have been different.
And in rehearsing that memory to the successive generations of her owners she asserted
the cost of their comfort.

Without questioning the care she took of their children and the regard she may indeed
have felt for them, there is an essential aggression in constantly repeating to the children
of her owners how she had herself been stolen as a child: Her care for them came at the
cost of her own childhood, her own home, her own family. Golchihrih may have been

“jolly” and enjoyed her pipe, but she was not going to be simply subsumed into this
family and they should know that.

Let me turn now to the issue of the religious identity of these slaves. The United States
publisher of Abu’l-Qasim’s account publicised it as forthcoming under the title Black
Babis. Abu’l-Qasim strongly resisted the idea that these slaves could be characterised as
‘Babis.’ With the exception of Ma’sud, he denied that any of them could be considered
Babis or Baha’is based on an analysis of their behaviour. It would seem that part of the
problem was that Abu’l-Qasim projected a bureaucratic view of religious identity that
became common in the Baha’i community around the 1930s on his subjects. For him
religious identity required instruction and acceptance by an ‘authority.’

Without these, in Abu’l-Qasim’s world view, the slaves must remain default Muslims
whatever one may wish to infer from their actions. Yet large numbers of those
acknowledged as ‘Babis’ in the mid-nineteenth century were primarily focused on the
person of the Bab rather than having any developed ideological understanding of their
‘new’ religion. And even for those who did, the majority maintained a public conformity
with Islam.

Abu’l-Qasim’s approach can be seen from the following extracts from his
correspondence with the publisher on this issue:

… there is no evidence which indicates that any of the black servants mentioned in my
book except Masoud became a believer in the Bab or Baha’u’llah. …. We have to bear in
mind that simply the fact of the presence of these servants at certain important historical
occasions is not sufficient as evidence of belief or proof of declaration. …. Therefore not
having seen or heard any evidence of a declaration of faith by any of these Black
servants, I am reluctant to state categorically that they became believers. (10)

… these black servants were not declared Babis except Masud, but they were dedicated
and faithful, selfless, truthful and loving followers of the Bab and Baha’u’llah and their
family and followers. (11)

Mas’ud was the exception as: “In manners, demeanor, in all respects of propriety and in
relations with others, he was meticulous,” and because of this Siyyid Muhammad,
“favoured him with special affection and endeavoured to teach him the Faith. Mas’ud
became deeply attracted and was soon to rank among the foremost believers in
Shiraz.”[AQ:20] That he was consciously taught, and overtly accepted that teaching,
provides Mas’ud with the requisite credentials.

Of Fiddih, Abu’l-Qasim simply states that she “was faithful in performing her religious
duties” (we are obviously meant to infer that he means Islamic ones), and that “she was
not aware of the station and mission of the Bab.” [AQ:17] And of Golchihrih that:
“Unfortunately, she knew nothing of the Fasith which had been so dear to her husband.”
Obviously, that is not literally true, especially as Abu’l-Qasim describes her daughter,

Sa’idih, as “a believer and … well versed in the teachings.” [AQ:23] It would seem that
Golchihrih must have chosen not to know.

Which brings us to Mubarak who was with Siyyid Ali-Muhammad during the whole
period of his initially declaring his religious mission. Many of Mubarak’s activities
between May 1844 and September 1846, when Siyyid Ali-Muhammad left Shiraz for the
last time, involved him in the early stages of Siyyid Ali-Muhammad’s independent
religious activities. He was present in an adjoining room when Siyyid Ali-Muhammad
first declared his claimed religious position to Mulla Husayn-i-Bushru’i in May 1844; he
carried secret correspondence between Siyyid Ali-Muhammad and some of his first
followers; and he personally attended to them in Siyyid Ali-Muhammad’s house. When
not in the upstairs reception room with Siyyid Ali-Muhammad and his visitors, Mubarak
occupied a room next door within easy earshot in case should he be needed, and thus
overheard everything that was said. He was Siyyid Ali-Muhammad’s companion on the
hajj in late 1844 when Siyyid Ali-Muhammad announced at the Ka’aba that he was the
Qa’im; was with him when he was first arrested on his return to Iran in 1845; and was
entrusted with the care of his wife and mother when Siyyid Ali-Muhammad was taken
from Shiraz in 1846.

One of the things that most upset some African-American Baha’i readers of Abu’l-
Qasim’s account when it was first published in the United States was that the slaves were
not ‘taught’ a new religious identity. They felt the emphasis on personal loyalty - without
a sharing of religious understanding - to be demeaning.

Something that is not fully clear in reading the book is the generational distinction
between these slaves. Mubarak died in the early 1860s; Mas’ud in the 1880s. There was
a considerable distinction between the inchoate Babi situation of Mubarak’s day and the
gradually rationalising Baha’i one of Mas’ud’s. Whatever the belief consequences
correlate with a personal devotion to Siyyid Ali-Muhammad in the time of Mubarak, they
were not inconsistent with continuing a pattern of Muslim observance. That he did so, is
not a solid basis on which to argue his ignorance or lack of understanding of the claims of
his master. All indications are that Mubarak was fully within the confidence of Siyyid
Ali-Muhammad and it seems likely that this was based on more than simply Mubarak’s
personal loyalty.

Another thing which upset some African-American readers was that the account states
that Mubarak and Fiddih were not told of the death of Siyyid Ali-Muhammad. Abu’l-
Qasim states that:

Even until the time of his death, Mubarak was not told of the Martyrdom of the Bab. The
family wanted neither to distress him not to allow the members of the household who
were regularly seen in the market-pace to inadvertently become the source of rumours.
Both Mubarak and Fiddih imagined that the Bab had voyaged to India in pursuit of his
mercantile affairs and would eventually be returning. [AQ:14]

Obviously, nobody knew better than Mubarak how little interest Siyyid Ali-Muhammad
had in pursuing “his mercantile affairs.” And as an educated, literate man there was no
way that he could be uninformed of an event that had even been reported in European
newspapers. But there is a deep strain in Iranian culture (comparable to that in nineteenth
century European culture) of being conscious of the distinction between what one knows
and what is known. Public acknowledgement of only what is known is expected.

Abu’l-Qasim tells the story of how in Karbila Mubarak made a broom with a green
handle (symbolising the lineage of Siyyid Ali-Muhammad):

Every morning at the hour of dawn, he would use the broom to sweep the courtyard
around the sanctuary of the shrine of Imam Husayn, vowing to perform this deed until the
return of his Master. Each morning after this exercise, he would proceed to procure the
provisions required by the household. [AQ:15]

Mubarak was attending two aging women who had fallen out with their relatives, I can
think of reasons why he would wish to pursue regular morning “exercise” out of the
house, and if that exercise conferred some religious merit by being a service to a shrine,
all the better. I do not think that his performing this daily task years after the execution
of Siyyid Ali-Muhammad can be seen as confirming that he had no idea of something
that was common knowledge. What it likely did do was act as a public gesture to
reinforce a story that made it more comfortable for those two women. Obviously,
Fatimih Bagum would live more comfortably in Karbila with a public persona as a

widow whose only child was away in India in business and who had thus come to the
holy city to live out her final days, than as the mother of an executed heretic.

Fiddih may be a different matter. Abu’l-Qasim states that, when the house in which she
had first lived with Khadijih Bagum and Siyyid Ali-Muhammad was being repaired in
1877 so that Khadijih Bagum could resume residence there, Fiddih thought the repairs
were being made because Siyyid Ali-Muhammad was about to return from his journey.

The correspondence between Siyyid Ali-Muhammad and Khadijih Bagum shows them to
have been truly in love. Fiddih must have been aware of the closeness of their
relationship. Can she have really thought that he had gone on a commercial trip that
lasted 30 years and had not sent a letter or message for over a quarter of a century? And
then there were all those conversations that Fiddih must have heard between Khadijih
Bagum and her guests while she attended the samovar, served meals, and made up beds.
Conversations in which Khadijih Bagum recounted the stories of her life with Siyyid Ali-
Muhammad that have been passed down through the sources we are discussing. One
must suspect that Fiddih was also playing the what’s known game and that her focus on
her mistress gave a added fillip to her maintaining the appearance that she believed
Khadijih Bagum wanted.

Siyyid Ali, the maternal uncle of Siyyid Ali-Muhammad was executed in Tehran a few
months before his nephew was executed in Tabriz in 1850. The news of both deaths was
initially kept from the women of the household. According to Khadijih Bagum:

“whenever we mentioned rumours that had come to our ears, the men would hotly deny
them – all lies they would say.” [B/A:26]

The time limit on the men’s denials was short, however. Haji Mirza Abu’l-Qasim,
Khadijih Bagum’s brother, had gone on pilgrimage with Mirza Javad, the eighteen-year-
old son of Siyyid Ali. On their return journey from Mecca, Mirza Javad died at Jiddah.
Mirza Abu’l-Qasim delayed coming home to Shiraz until over a year after the executions
but eventually he did. When the death of the son became known, then the death of the
father had to be revealed and the execution of Siyyid Ali-Muhammad also. So, the
women of the household suspected, but did not know of the death of Siyyid Ali-
Muhammad for something over a year.

Abu’l-Qasim asserts that Khadijih Bagum confided in Fiddih entirely. Yet Khadijih
Bagum is reported to have said: “Of the servants and the maids whom we had in the
house, no one knew of the martyrdom … It was not possible to talk of such matters with
anyone.” [B/A:29] And she is reported to have told the story of Fiddih and the repairing
of the house. But there must be some carefully structured social play at work here.
Indeed, one can picture Khadijih Bagum retelling these narratives of ignorance as Fiddih
quietly pours tea for her and her guests and then withdraws to the background until
needed again.

The rumours and the men’s denials must have caused considerable discussion among the
women of the family. Then the news of the deaths occasioned such grief on the part of

the bereaved, and such spite on the part of those of the family who had deprecated Siyyid
Ali-Muhammad’s activities, that it precipitated Fatimih Bagum’s move out of Shiraz.
How could anyone living in the household remain actually unaware of what was going on
- although they might be required to be unaware socially? How could Fiddih who
“devoted much time to nursing her and looking after every detail of her life” be
unconscious of the cause of Fatimih Bagum’s grief?

The range of religious feeling within the family may be gauged from Munirih Khanum’s
account of her visiting in Shiraz in 1871 (by which time things were much calmer than in
the 1850s). She describes a daughter and two daughters-in-law of Siyyid Muhammad as
being “not absolutely Baha’is, though interested in the Cause.” She notes their pleasure
that she joined them in ablutions and chanting the sunset prayer. [MK1:75] Munirih
Khanum also describes Khadijih Bagum’s eldest sister, the widow of Siyyid Ali, as
“firmly attached to the orthodox ordinary Muslim religion,” and continues:

She moaned “Why should religion cause so much bloodshed? Surely it should be a cause
of peace. I am perplexed and distressed, and my heart is full of sorrow.”
I tried to help her, I longed to do so. Being a stranger, she listened to me. I chanted some
prayers, and she wept, but understood not at all.

This condition of mind was very usual amongst those Persians who, far from being
enemies, were kind and good, but whose eyes had not been opened. [MK1:76-77]

At the time of the Siyyid Ali-Muhammad’s execution the only member of his family who
fully accepted his religious claims was his wife. His uncle, who had also unreservedly
accepted him, had already been executed in Tehran. For the Afnans generally, their main
concern in this period must have been survival. Indeed, family accounts describe the
urgent destruction of any paper in Siyyid Ali-Muhammad’s handwriting by washing off
the ink and then burying the paper.

Mubarak and Fiddih could not have been unaware of the religious claims of Siyyid Ali-
Muhammad nor of his death. But their loyalty to Khadijih Bagum, and Fatimih Bagum,
would have led them to adopt whatever self-presentation protected them. A public
substitution of a fictional merchant on extended business in India for an executed heretic
who was regarded by the government as a fomentor of rebellion, would certainly have
been a logical course for the broader family. Khadijih Bagum’s dependence on the
family would necessitate her cooperation; and she would expect her slaves to go along
with the pretence.

In all three cases, this acquiescence would be irrespective of whatever the individuals
actually believed. The supposed ignorance of the death of Siyyid Ali-Muhammad on the
part of the family slaves insisted on in the family narrative is unlikely to tell us anything
about the knowledge of family affairs possessed by the slaves, but is likely to indicate the
important role these slaves had in maintaining the public fictions which preserving face
for the family required.

Although Mubarak, Fiddih, Mas’ud, and Golchihrih are the only slaves about whom
Abu’l-Qasim gives much detail they would have lived in a context where among the
various branches of the family there were many slaves. Abu’l-Qasim closes his account
by noting of his own youth:

Altogether, seven blacks lived in our family – six women and one man. Three of them
lived in the house of Hand of the Cause Mr. Balyuzi. The other stayed with my maternal
uncle. The last remaining one was a woman from Zanzibar whose name was Gol-i-Bahar
(spring flower), who remembered the Khal-i-Akbar [ Siyyid Muhammad] and would tell
of the kindness he would show her. She had a very imposing and dignified stature, and
lived to about ninety years of age. [AQ:29-30]

This would have been in the early twentieth century when we can assume establishments
were rather reduced from earlier days. However, it is notable how the sense of “family”
still includes more than one household.

According to Abu’l-Qasim:

The last slave purchased by my forefathers was a Swahili youth named Salman, who was
acquired around 1870 in Shiraz. Eventually, Salman was sent to the town of Abadih to
serve in the family of Da’i Husayn… [AQ:8]

But the last remaining slave living with the family is not quite clear.   In his account he
credits that status to Gol-i-Bahar, but in correspondence it is another Golchihrih he
names.

The first published edition of Abu’l-Qasim’s account had included a photograph
captioned as being the Golchihrih who married Mas’ud, yet the woman did not fit the
physical description of the text.(12) As this second Golchihrih is never mentioned in the
account by name, one wonders why Abu’l-Qasim provided the photograph. It is a
powerful image evidently cropped from a group photograph. It shows a somewhat heavy
set, very dark woman in simple cotton clothes. Her hands are placed palm down on her
thighs with work-thickened fingers spread apart. A child leans toward her. The
correspondence reveals that this Golchihrih was not married, and “she was one of the
maid servants of Monavar Khanoum the mother of … H. M. Balyuzi.” (13) Another letter
adds that she was “the last African in the Afnan family.” (14)

So even something as seemingly simple as naming the last African servitor of the family
turns out not to be so simple. The sources that are available to us on these slaves have
enabled us to frame as many questions as answers, but they did permit us to add names,
fragments of life history, and even in one case a face, to a handful of the multitude caught
up in the institution of slavery. And the questions that they raise remind us that slaves are
fully human and their lives have all the nuances, inconsistencies, and complications of all
lives.
