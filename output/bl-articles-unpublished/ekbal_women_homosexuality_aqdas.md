The Quranic Roots of Some Legal and Theological
Terms of the Kitáb-i Aqdas Regarding Women

and Homosexual Relations,

> “Sacred scripture clearly requires especial care and faithfulness in
> translation. This is supremely important in the case of a book of
> laws, where it is vital that the reader not be misled or drawn into
> fruitless disputation.”2

> In its introduction to the English translation of the Kitáb-i Aqdas, the Universal House of
> Justice (UHJ) has pointed out the difficulties that faced the translators originating from the
> “varied modes of expression” in the Arabic and English languages and the “intense
> concentration and terseness” of the Arabic style of the Aqdas. “Striking the right balance
> between beauty and clarity of expression on the one hand, and literalness on the other”, was
> thus one of the major issues which led to a “repeated reconsideration of the rendering of
> certain passages”.3

> Regarding some critical remarks on the English translation of the Aqdas included in the
> following article, it should therefore be taken into consideration that the UHJ has, on different
> occasions, drawn attention to the fact that the present version of the translation is “an English
> translation”,4 and not the final translation, as was also stated in the preface to the present
> edition. The UHJ has also stressed that whereas it had now come to consider the translation as
> having “reached a point where it represents an acceptable rendering of the original”, it
> nevertheless “will undoubtedly give rise to questions and suggestions which may shed further
> light on the content”.5

> It is in the light of such an understanding that we propose raising some questions as to the
> “accuracy of meaning” and “conformity of style with that used by Shoghi Effendi”, which
> were declared to be major aims of the translation,6 and include some suggestions concerning a
> future edition of the Aqdas.

> Great similarities exist between the Kitáb-i Aqdas and the Koran, not only concerning matters
> of style and structure, but also with regard to the legal and theological terms of the Aqdas
> which are basically of Koranic origin. For a proper understanding of the Aqdas and to avoid
> the dangers of a superficial interpretation of some of its contents, knowledge of its Islamic
> backgrounds will prove indispensable in many cases.

> Similarities between the Aqdas and the Koran exist, not only with regard to the lack of a
> systematic structure, where, for example, aspects of one and the same subject appear scattered
> in the different suras and paragraphs of the two Books, but also in relation to quite a number
> of the laws and ordinances of the Most Holy Book, some of which may actually be traced back
> to Biblical or Zoroastrian origins.7 A few examples should suffice here to illustrate this point.
> So is the very first duty prescribed in Aq. 1, “The recognition of Him Who is the Dayspring of
> His Revelation”, not only based on the shahāda in Islam, which gives testimony “that
> Muhammad is the Messenger of God”8 and also on a number of Koran verses, for example,
> “Say: Obey Allah and the messenger” (Q 3:32, cf. also 3:132, 172; 4:64; 57:8 etc.),9 but may
> be also traced back to Matthew 10:32: “Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men,
> him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven” (cf. also Mark 16:16; Luke 12:8-
> 9, John 3:18) and to a similar Provision of Zarathustra: “All those who will give hearing for
> Me unto this one (the Prophet) will come unto Salvation and Immortality through the works
> of the Good Spirit”.10 The right of a God’s Messenger to abrogate laws and ordinances
> prescribed by his forerunners (Aq. 77, 142 and particularly 162) has similar foundations in the
> Koran concerning Muhammad and Jesus as transmitters of God’s will: “Allah effaceth
> (yamḥu =eradicates, K.E.) what He will, and establisheth (what He will), and with Him is the
> source of ordinance” (Q 13:39)11. And finally the prohibition of muttering sacred verses in
> public, which may also be traced back to the custom of zamzama prevailing among
> Zoroastrians in some of their ritual ceremonies, which had already been prohibited by the
> Arabs after the conquest of Persia, when Djaz’ bin Mu`āwiya in 641 forbade zamzama in the
> countryside near Basra (EI² s.v. madjūs )12. The prohibition became, in early Islam, of such
> vital importance that even when a Zoroastrian rebel, Bih’āfarῑd bin Farwardῑn, set himself up
> as a new prophet in 747 and organized an uprising against the Umayyads, he kept to this
> prohibition and confirmed it openly (EI² s.v. Bih’āfarῑd b. Farwardῑn). An extensive study of
> the laws and ordinances of the Aqdas will be inevitable for a better perception of their place in

> way through. It has been already indicated elsewhere13 that a number of constructions which
> are in absolute conformity with their Koranic origins, as well as quite a few other
> constructions which show only slight linguistic modifications, have been included in the
> Aqdas. Here, too, a few examples should suffice to demonstrate this:

> Aq. 66: wa kāna Allāh `alá kulli shay’in qadῑr / “and He, in truth, hath power over all things”
> is identical to Q. 33:27 and 48:21. In many other verses of the Koran, a slightly modified
> construction, beginning with “inna” instead of “kāna” appear. For example, Q 2:20, 106, 109,
> 148 etc., etc.

> Aq. 161: lā yus’al`ammā yaf `al / “He shall not be asked of His doings” is identical to Q
> 21:23, and

> Aq. 7+47: yaf `alu mā yashā’/ “He doeth what He pleaseth” or “He doeth whatsoever He
> willeth” is identical to Q 3:40; 22:18; 14:27.

On the other hand,

> Aq. 188: man qatala nafsan khaṭa’an falahu diyatun musallamatun ilā ahlihā / “should
> anyone unintentionally take another’s life, it is incumbent upon him to render to the family of
> the deceased an indemnity” is an only slightly modified version of Q 4:92 (! diya), where the
> substitution of mu´minan / “believer” by nafsan / “anyone” is the only real difference between
> the two constructions beside the minor addition of “falahu” / “it is incumbent upon him” and
> the feminine form of “ahlihi” and an omission of the obligation “to set free a believing slave”,
> which would have made obviously little sense in regard to modern times. Also

> Aq. 64: iyyákum an tufsidū fῑ al-arḍi ba´da iṣlāḥihā / “Take heed not to stir up mischief in the
> land after it hath been set in order“, is a slight modification to Q 7:56 + 85, where instead of
> iyyākum / “take heed not to …” the negation particle lā / “don’t” appears.14

> In translating the Aqdas into English, unfortunately, no sufficient care was taken to verify the
> Koranic constructions in a reliable manner. It is only a matter of exception that a construction
> such as the one given in Aq. 161 and rendered originally by Shoghi Effendi into English15–
> “He shall not be asked of His doings”–was put into quotation marks to point out its Koranic
> origin, whereas this same necessary method was neglected in nearly all other cases. The
> reader is thus denied access to, and insight into, the vast number of Koranic terms,
> expressions and constructions included in the book. On other occasions, such as with yaf `alu
> mā yashā’, which appears both in Aq. 7 and 47, and without any apparent reason, different
> translations of this same construction were introduced–“He doeth what He pleaseth” (Aq. 7)
> and “He doeth whatsoever He willeth” (Aq. 47)–of which, again, only the first was put in
> quotation marks. The reader remains thus incapable of recognizing the fact that a) in both
> cases Bahá’u’lláh was using the one and the same construction and that b) this construction is

> great proximity to the Koran.

> Similarities between the Aqdas and the Koran had already been observed by E.G. Browne
> who, in his introduction to Nuqṭatu’l-káf, wrote that “if the Báb produced ‘Verses’ in the style
> of the Qur´án, so did Bahá’u’lláh”.17 The fact that Bahá’u’lláh produced such verses was seen

> recounteth a miracle other than the verses of the Bayán, has no witness for it. But he who
> assumes to produce (revealed) verses, none should oppose him.”18 The Báb gave this
> declaration such prominence that he ordained the believers to read it “once in every 19 days”19
> in anticipation of the coming of man yuẓhiruhu’l-lāh, of “Him whom God shall Make
> Manifest”, a frequent stereotyped reference in the Bab’s writings to another messenger of God
> coming in the future, which Bahá’ís believe to refer to Bahá’u’lláh. And it was exactly this
> fact of Bahá’u’lláh producing verses in the style of the Koran and in fulfillment of the Báb’s
> above-mentioned statement, that made Browne consider as being the main reason why, “in
> spite of violent dissentions, Bahá’u’lláh’s claim should have been ultimately accepted by the
> great majority of the Babis”.20

> Concerning certain laws revealed by the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh declares in Ishráqát 71 that He had
> sanctioned such laws “by embodying them in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in different words”.21 There
> is enough reason to maintain that the same is true and also applies to similar aspects of the
> Koran, which have been either embodied and incorporated unchanged into the Aqdas, or else
> reconstructed there “in different words”.

> It was already demonstrated22 that all six Arabic legal terms and their plural derivatives
> denominating Laws and Ordinances in the Aqdas–`ahd (injunction, command, obligation,
> covenant, treaty), amr / awámir (divine commands), ḥadd / ḥudūd (hindrance, impediment,
> limit, boundary etc., then restrictive ordinances or statutes of God, but also physical penalties
> in Islamic law), ḥukm / aḥkām (decision, judgment, command), nāmūs (divine law) and sunna
> / sunan (custom, use, habit, practice, tradition, orthodoxy) are all Koranic terms with the one
> exception of nāmūs which is derived from the Greeek nomos and was introduced by Ibn Isḥāq
> (died 767), the renowned biographer of the Prophet Muhammad, and his editor Ibn Hishām
> (died 834) into Islamic apologetics. Apart from the proximity and synonymity of many of
> these terms, the richness and variety as well as the ambiguities of their individual meanings
> makes it inevitable to have access in future to an academic and scholarly edition of the
> translation of the Aqdas to supply the reader with the original terms, which may either be put
> in brackets or given in the footnotes. The reader may thus not only gradually get acquainted

> In this very important paragraph (Aq. 42), concerned with the fate of charitable endowments

> and, if then, the weakest–out of several other possibilities, and being an interpretation that

> The same will prove to be true in many other cases, where, for example a pronoun “from him”
> (min`indihi) has been rendered “from My Forerunner” (Aq. 136), a term that does not occur
> all through this particular verse of the Aqdas. Whereas pronouns were correctly explained in
> footnotes as being references to say the Báb or Bahá’u’lláh, for example, in Aq. 141, 142,
> 143, in this, and in other cases, the explanation and interpretation was transferred to the body

\[23\] That is, the aghṣān = Branches. With this term, plural of ghuṣn, the male descendants of Bahá’u’lláh are
> unanimously designated in Bahá’í writings. In the above mentioned context it is quite obvious that a period is
> anticipated when no more aghṣān, among whom a guardian may be designated, exist.

\[24\] To give only 2 examples: Hans Wehr: Arabisches Wörterbuch, Wiesbaden 1968, translates bilád: “Land, Stadt
> (city), Ortschaft (locality)”, and gives examples “b. aṣ-ṣῑn: (Land of) China; b. al-Hind (Land of ) India, etc.”. F.
> Steingass: A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary, repr. Beirut 1975, translates bilād into “an inhabited
> country” and gives its plural sense as: “Cities, countries, regions, habitations, provinces, territories”, making it
> clear that, not even in its Persianized sense of meaning, does bilád occur as “world”. And, of course, the
> Palestinians, among whom Bahá’u’lláh lived when the Aqdas was revealed, don’t mean the world but their home
> country, when they sing in their national anthem “bilādῑ, bilādῑ, bilādῑ, fatḥu thaura `a’l-a`ādῑ” (my country, my
> country, my country, it is victory and revolution against the enemies). The term bilād in Aq 160 was translated
> on the other hand correctly into “countries”: “Promote ye the development of the cities of God and His countries
> (bilād)”, then again into “world” in Aq 189: “O members of parliaments throughout the world (bilād)”–without
any apparent reasons!

> Giving reference to the original Arabic termini would not only be in accordance with a
> method approved and encouraged by Shoghi Effendi as early as November 1923, when he
> forwarded to the American National Assembly his list of “Transliterated Oriental Terms”
> through which, as his wife, Ruhiyyih Khánum, points out, the exact word should be “nailed
> down”, in spite of the “irksome and often confusing” business of transliteration25. It would
> moreover preserve the fine nuances which distinguish the different terms used. Whether any
> significance may be attached to the fact that Bahá’u’lláh in Aq. 146 adopts the very rarely
> used expression of “raqq” (parchment, cf. Q 52:3) instead of “lawḥ” (tablet, cf. Q 85:22) may
> be incomprehensible for the moment. But to render both terms into “Tablets” without
> preserving the original term in one way or another, not only creates a potpourri, in which
> different termini are intermingled, but suppresses the differentiations made by Bahá’u’lláh
> himself in such cases.

> An example may elucidate this point: Both ghuṣn/ aghṣān (Arab.) and shākheh/ shākhsār
> (Pers.) denominate the same thing and mean “branch”. But since no differentiation was
> usually made in the English translations where the two termini occur in their original form,
> some Bahá’ís around Charles Mason Remey (a prominent American Bahá’í who, after the
> death of Shoghi Effendi, claimed to be his successor and was thus expelled as a “covenant
> breaker” from the community) were misled by the word “branch” in the Will and Testament
> of ’Abdu’l-Bahá, and claimed that Bahá’u’lláh’s numerous references to human beings as “the
> fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch” would enable any believer to be elected as a
> successor to the Guardian.26 First-hand access of the reader to the original terms of such
> scriptural writings may very well avoid unnecessary mischief of this sort.

> Time and again, Bahá’u’lláh draws attention to such passages of the Aqdas, which have been
> revealed in an allegorical fashion. He points out to the “hidden pearls … enshrined within
> them” (Aq. 136) and calls upon the reader to “ponder … the pearls of mysteries from the
> ocean” of his utterances (Aq. 137). And Aq. 182 is nothing less than a mandate regarding
> each and all of those who come to envisage his Book: “Immerse yourselves in the ocean of
> My words, that ye may unravel its secrets, and discover all the pearls of wisdom that lie hid in
> its depths”.

> To unravel the secrets of this Book without having access to the original Arabic keywords
> will prove in most cases a fruitless job. Another example may elucidate the necessity of
> consulting the Koran for a better understanding of the Aqdas, and the “hidden pearls”
> enshrined within it. The permission to attire in silk (Aq. 159) may of course be understood in
> its literal sense as an abrogation of previous prohibitions in Islam. 27 Having access to the
> keyword ḥarῑr for silk, will on the other hand enable an examination of all those verses in the
> Koran, where mention of ḥarῑr has been made (Q 22:23; 35:33 and 76:12) and find out that
> not only these verses, but all further ones, too, which mention silk-brocade, istabraq, or
> sundus (18:31; 44:53; 55:54; 76:21) are without exception concerned with the attirement of
> the inhabitants of paradise. But the researcher will be furthermore capable of finding out, that
> besides silk a direct connection exists between these verses and two other indicators for the
> dwellers in paradise: They not only carry “armlets of gold” (18:31; 22:23) and are served food

> states: “He, of a truth, desireth that His servants and His handmaids should be at peace (iṣlāḥ,

> father he shall receive his share of the inheritance in the prescribed measure recorded in the
> Book; but if he be descended from the mother, he shall receive only two thirds of his
> entitlement…” (QA 6)30. In another part, Bahá’u’lláh seems to consent to bigamy (Aq. 63),
> which is again confirmed by Him on another instance in QA 30. And ’Abdu’l Bahá’s

> to wickedness (baghῑy) and lust (faḥshā’)”.

> Both terms, which constitute an idiomatic phrase in Arabic, are Koranic and appear in Q
> 16:90: “Lo! Allah … forbiddeth lewdness (faḥshā’) and abomination and wickedness
> (baghῑy)”, (cf. also Q 7:33). With regard to women baghῑy designates the act of fornication
> (" zinā’) and adultery.32 The term faḥshā’ and its synonym fāḥisha (vice, depravity, lewdness)
> occur much more often in the Koran, for example, 2:268: “The devil promiseth you
> destitution and enjoineth on you lewdnesss (faḥshā’)”, or 4:15: “As for those of you women
> who are guilty of lewdness (fāḥisha), call to witness four of you against them” (cf. also 4:19,
> 22, 25; 7:28, 80 etc.). As in Q 27:54 fāḥisha also designates sodomy (" liwāṭ and ghilmān).

\[31\] The verse in Aq 32 should have actually read: “The Lord hath ordained that those (of you) who are able shall
> make pilgrimage to the (sacred) House with the exception of women (dūna an-nisā’). God hath exempted them
> (`afā Allāh `anhunna) as a mercy on His part.”

> The nafs ammāra, the self which summoneth insistently to wickedness, mentioned in the first
> part of this verse, is by the way also an important Koranic construction–Q 12:53: “Lo! The
> (human) soul (nafs) enjoineth (ammāra) unto evil”. The construction has gained a

> commanding to evil, corresponding thus to the Hebrew nefesh, and the New Testament
> “flesh” (EI², s.v. nafs).

> Bikr: Virgin. (Aq. 63): “And he who would take into his service a maid (bikr) may do so with
> propriety”. The term appears in its plural form abkār in Q 56:36, denominating “virgins” and
> was rendered by Marmeduke Pickthall in Q 66:5 into “maids”. Rudi Paret and Max Henning33

translate it exclusively as “Jungfrauen”, that is, “virgins”.

> Whereas the word “maid” used in the translation of Aq. 63 suggests the meaning “virgin”,
> among a variety of different other meanings, that is, “An unmarried woman, esp. one young; a
> virgin; a female servant” (Chambers) only according to some English dictionaries, others
> disregard this meaning of “virgin” completely in their definitions for “maid”34. The original
> Arabic term “bikr” denominates on the other hand solely “virgin”35, whereby the
> supplementary meaning “Erstgeborene” = first born (Wehr) or “a young cow” (al-Mundjid),
> both obviously do not fit into this verse. No dictionary translates “bikr” in the sense of “an
> unmarried woman” or “a woman servant”, which Western readers in general would most
> probably associate with “maid”. Whereas “maid” therefore implies a variety of different
> meanings and very rarely that of “virgin”, “bikr” is indisputably clear in its meaning of
> “virgin”.

> Here, too, the translation is in dire need of reassessment. The fact that the English translation
> is to be taken as the foundation of all other European translations, distorts completely the
> original meaning of bikr as is clearly the case with the draft German translation. Here “Magd”
> which was used for the English term “maid” has no more connotations with “virgin”
> whatsoever. The fact that “virginity” and not “woman servant” which is the basic meaning of
> “Magd”, is meant by Bahá’u’lláh, is also evident in Aq. 106: “Immerse yourselves in clear
> (bikr, in the sense of “untouched, unpolluted”) water”.

> The fact that this verse is part of the paragraph relating to bigamy, makes it very probable, that
> Bahá’u’lláh’s intention here is the protection of a maid servant from sexual abuse. Only a
> virgin retaining her virginity till she decides to marry, may be regarded to be exempt from
> harassment and false accusations. Such an interpretation may very well be supported by QA
> 30: “This is solely for service such as is performed by any other class of servants … in
> exchange for wages; such a maiden is free to choose a husband at whatever time she
> pleaseth…”. The fact that this verse is meant to prevent the abuse of female servants may be
> also deduced from a very similar Koranic provision in Q 24:33 deterring from forcing maid-
> servants into prostitution (bighā’ " baghῑy wa faḥshā’).

> specified amount of money or goods due in cases of homicide or other physical injuries,
> corresponding to the compensation or Wergeld of the ancient Roman and Germanic laws and

> where major physical injuries are suffered, for example the loss of both arms, legs, eyes,
> etc.37.

> Whereas diya is generally used in its Islamic sense in cases of homicide–arsh being the
> designation in all other cases–the term has undergone a significant change in the Aqdas and is
> used in the general sense of compensation. Thus it has been extended, for example, to cases of
> adultery " zinā’, which, according to Islamic law, lies outside diya. This is the case, for
> example, in Aq. 49: “God hath imposed a fine (diya) on every adulterer and adulteress, to be
> paid to the House of Justice: Nine mithqáls of Gold, to be doubled if they should repeat the
> offence”. It is evident that diya has been used by Bahá’u’lláh in the sense of “penalty”, jazā’,
> and not as a compensation for harm done physically: “Such is the penalty (jazá´), which He
> Who is the Lord of Names hath assigned them in this world …”(Aq. 49).

> Probably in this same generalized form diya, in its plural form diyát, has also been used in Aq.
> 52: “We have decreed that a third part of all fines (diyát) shall go to the Seat of Justice …”.
> As mentioned, diya appears in the Koran in the sense of blood money: “He who hath killed a
> believer by mistake must set free a believing slave, and pay the blood-money (diya) to the
> family of the slain, unless they remit it as charity” (Q 4:92). As stated above, this verse has
> been with only a slight modification incorporated into the Aqdas: “Should anyone
> unintentionally take another’s life, it is incumbent upon him to render to the family of the
> deceased an indemnity (diya) of one hundred mithqáls of gold” (Aq. 188). In the same sense
> of an indemnity for physical injuries, diya encounters in Aq. 56: “The penalties [actually
> provisions, aḥkām] for wounding or striking a person depend upon the severity of the injury;
> for each degree the Lord of Judgment hath prescribed a certain indemnity (diya)”. Here, too,
> inconsistency in translating the same legal term in different manners–as “a fine” (Aq. 49) and
> “indemnity” (Aq. 56)–is rather a matter of confusion for the reader who would not notice that
> both refer to the same–Koranic–terminus technicus.

> It may finally be interesting to note that diya has now, in actual fact, disappeared from

> Nadjis: Impure, unclean, opposite of ṭāhir (cf. ṭahāra in Aq. 75). As already mentioned ("
> ḥayḍ) Bahá’u’lláh has abolished the concept of “uncleanness” concerning both things and
> peoples in the Aqdas. Aq. 75: “God hath, likewise, as a bounty from His presence, abolished
> the concept of ´uncleanness´, whereby divers things and peoples have been held to be
> impure”. Although in this verse the term nadjis was not used, but instead dūna aṭ-ṭahāra, “not
> pure”, this provision is certainly in connection with prevailing customs in Islam concerning
> the impurity of certain things. According to Shāfi`ῑ doctrine, for example, wine and other
> spirits, dogs, swine, mayta (dead animals), blood and excrements as well as the milk of
> animals whose flesh is not eaten, are declared nadjis. Although dogs are not considered nadjis
> in the Koran–just to the contrary is Q 18:18, 22–however certain traditions attributed to
> Muhammad, probably out of an attitude of conscious contrast to the estimation of dogs in
> Zoroastrianism, imply a general attitude against dogs. Provisions against certain animals
> which were considered impure, such as dogs and swine, have of course similar roots in
> Judaism, where according to Num.19 also human corpses are considered to be impure (EI²,
> s.v. nadjis).

> Considering corpses, but also infidels, to be impure is restricted to the Shiah, who establish
> their attitude concerning polytheists on Q 9:28: “O ye who believe! The idolators (mushrikūn)
> are unclean (nadjas, pl. of nadjis), so let them not come near the Inviolable Place of Worship
> after this their year”. The last part of this verse proves that the measure pertained actually to

> Zinā’: Adultery, fornication. Aq. 19: “Ye have been forbidden to commit murder or adultery
> (zinā’)”. Adultery has been condemned by all major religions of the world: Thus, for example,
> in the third of Buddha’s five laws, the Panica Sῑla,54 Deutr. 23:3,18; Matth. 15:19; Mark 7:21;
> Gal. 5:19; 1.Cor. 5:9; Eph. 5:5; Hebr. 12:16; 1 Petr. 4; Rev. 21:8; 22:15. It was even
> considered to be taboo among the ancient Greeks, whereas this prohibition had led to the
> spread of pederasty among them.55

> The Koran is also very explicit in condemning adultery. Q 17:32: “And come not near unto
> adultery (zinā’). Lo! It is an abomination (fāḥisha, " baghῑy wa faḥshā’) and an evil way”. A
> severe penalty of a hundred lashes was ordained in Q 24:2: “The adulterer and adulteress,

> adulteresses in their houses, an idea which was already discussed under " `idda.

> Although committing adultery is strongly condemned in Bahá’í scriptures, much less severe
> punishments for adultery were maintained in Aq. 49: “God hath imposed a fine (" diya) on
