"The Mystery of the Sworded Warrior in Hindu
Apocalypse: was Kalki Vi~~uyasas Baha'u'llah?"

by Christopher Buck

'lllis paper_p~cl::es the validity of the claim that Bahi•u•llih, Prophet-Founder
of the Baha'i Faith, fulfills messianic eJCpectaticns associated with the Hindu
eschatological figure, Kalki Vil?l}uyasas, the tenth.Avatar or incarnation of Vil?l}u,
who shall appear as a ~rded warrior astride a winged white steed, to end the
dark era by slaying the wicked, thus inaugurating the golden age.
~ first appears in the ~ta, then in later epics, such as the Visnu
Purana. But the Kalki Pur!na is the nest developed apocalypse. 'llle Kalki
prophecies are often related in~ tense, and seem nore ·reflective of a
medieval crisis rather than a future visicn. In fact, Kalki is arguably an
eschatologically-heroized form of the warlord Vi§I).u-vardana Yaso-dhallnan (ccm-
pressed into Vigluyasas), who in ~ sixth century A.D~ vanquished Mihirakula
and the White Huns, thus establishing a Brahmanical renaissance. If so, then
past events have becate transfonred into last events in the Kalki Purana.
~·Is in Malwa, the sama province in India over which Yasodharman (called in
Jaina saurces "Kalki-raja") had ruled, have proclaimed in song Baha'u'llah as
Kalki.   Baba' i books have been published in Hindi and English, adducing proof-
texts fran the Kalki Pur~ in support of this claim. Upon examination, lx:Mever,
the proof-texts used fail to con.form to the latest critical edition of the Kalki.
Pura'Qa. Related efforts to prove that the Buddhist messiah Maitreya is Baba' u' ll.ah
are also derrcnstrably uncritical.
Kalki is an avenger who not cnly repulses Huns, but who persecutes Jains, Buidhists
and even Muslims as well. lt>st of the prophecies are vaticinia ex eventu (predic-
ticns fran past events) , are late in final form, are not uru.f1ed-;-and are nore
predicative than predictive in nature. Cycles of tine vary in Hindu systems, so
that Kalki' s advent will also vary. For Baba' u' D.ah to be Kalki, the prophecies
themselves nrust be radically spiritualized fran their prcnounced etlmocentrism.
'lbe.re is, lx:Mever, an interesting e:IUivalence of titles, insofar as Vi~uyasas and
Baha'u'llih both signify "the Glory of God" in the literal translation of their
respective Sanskrit and Persian narres. Furthernore, parallels between Bah.a' u' D.ah'
cbctrine of Manifestatiai ('lheophanology) and the Hindu theory of Pradurbbava

("Manifestation") are striking, both dcctrinally and histerically. For the <X>ctrir.

of Pra&n:bhiva (a term predating the use of the TNC>rd Avatara) provided the ideol~
which brought about the federaticn of disparate cults, to produce a religious and
social synthesis-unifying different groups of people into a single camrunion of
Vaisnavic Hinduism.                                                ·
In much the sane way, the federal ideology of Baha'u'Dih is presently effecting
a synthesis of its own, uniting· ·the followers of diverse and often caapeting
religious backgrounds into a single, universal Faith. 'lllis process .inproves
upcn the utopia of Kalki, whose holy war can only achieve peace through forced
a:nversion, in order to restore a Brahmanical orthodoxy. :r.t:>reover, there is
sociological truth to the identification of Baha'u'llah as Kalki, since several
millicn Baha'is the TNC>rld over have reached this eschatological reoognition.
Che may say that in the process of advancing an apocalyptic claim,.Baha'u'llah
has redefined as well as revalorized Kalki.
THE MYSTERY OF THE SWORDED WARRIOR IN HINDU APOCALYPSE:

WAS KALK.I VISNUYASAS BAHA'U'LLAH?

In the gaze of America, amongst the foremost symbols of India are her
Avatars, or God-Men.   If a person knows little else about India, apart from
cartoons of cobra-pipers in diapers, chances are that her holy men are first
pictured, along with hunger and mystery.

Of these mystics, one is struck by the legendary power of the supreme
God-Men, known as Avatars.   Avatars tower in India's cultural heritage with
a presence that dw.arfs Paul Bunyan, an American heroic counterpart.      For
millions of Hindus over multiple centuries, Avatars as mediators between the
Divine and the mundane proved inspirational.    These supermen represented a
Deity Who was not passive, existing merely as spectator.

Through the Avatar, the Supreme Being became    deepl~   involved in the
spiritual evolution of the human race.     On an individual level, the Avatar
becomes a kind of process mandala on which to contemplate, and, ultimately, to
pattern one's life after.    Through devotion, meditation, and action, the
religiously sincere could model his or her own life after a favorite Avatar,
and serve as an arm of God in a small way.

In India, various revitalization movements took root over the past century.

Of such, the Baha'i Faith is one.    Recently, the government. there has agreed
to include the Baha'i Faith as one of the major religions in its moral course
books for all grades up to high school.     This program will be the first of
its kind in India.

In relating the founder of the Baha'i Faith, the Persian prophet Baha'u'llah,
to cultural tradition, Indian Baha'1s of Hindu antecedence have chpsen to
identify Baha'u'llah with Kalki Visnuyasas, the tenth and final major Avatar,
whose future advent to save the world from evil had long flourished in Hindu
thought as both a promise as well as a hope.     The purpose of this enquiry is

to determine the extent to which such an identification is either warranted
or artificial, from a scholarly perspective.

The Most Powerful Theological Concept Of India
The growth of Avatar-legends throughout the sacred epics of India, and
the devotionalism surrounding those Avatars on the folk level--through places
of pilgrimage, veneration of icons, and celebration in festivals--makes the
doctrine of Avatars probably the most powerful theological concept in India
ever to arise since that of the Absolute or Brahman.    Not only is the Avatar
of the Absolute the most powerful metaphysical preamble in the spiritual

constitution of India, but the most successful as well.

The most famous expression of the Avatar-concept comes from the lips of
Krsna as found in the Bhagavad Gita (IV:7-8): "For whenever the law of right-
EDusness withers away and lawlessness arises, then do I generate myself (on earth)
For the protection of the good, _for the destruction of evil-doers, for the setting
up of the law of righteousness I come into being age after age. 1 ~

For the history of the Avatar doctrine, it is wise to-start with the
origins of the term first, to arrive at an insight into the roots of the idea.
Upon investigation, we find a constellation of related terms.

Avatara And Other Terms Current In Earlier Times
Avatar is the Anglicization of the Sanskrit Avatara.     Fortunately, the
English-speaking world is not so cavalier as were the Greeks in the naturali-
zation of foreign terms.     However, Avatar is most often thought of in the Occi-
dent as a Hindu synonym for Incarnation.

Since the chrysalis of our culture is Christian, we are naturalized to
the God-embodying concept.     Incarnation is a part of our theological frame of
reference.   And to a great extent, the two ideas are related.

Yet it is significant that_ both Avatar and Incarnation were crystallized
at dates comparatively late with respect the origins of those notions, as
will be shown below.
That the term Avatara is of late currency is well-known in scholarly

circles.       Avatara derives from the root avatr which means "to come down" or
"to descend."

Now the Bhagavad Gita uses other terms to convey this unique and fullest
appearance of God to man.      The words janman (birth), sambhava (come into being),
and srjana (creation) are employed. 4      The Mahabharata, the great Hindu saga
in which the Bhagavad Gita is embedded, most often prefers the word Pradurbhava
(manifestation or appearance) to Avatara.

The Pradurbhava Or Manifestation Of God
The most thorough treatment of the term Pradurbhava was accomplished by
Paul Hacker in a contribution entitled, Zur Entwicklung Der Avataralehre,
appearing in the Vienna journal: Wiener Zeitschrift Filr Die Kunde Sild-Und
Ostasiens Und Archiv Fur Indische Philosophie: Vol. IV (1960): pp. 47-70, of
which a summary in English is provided on pages 68-70.
When the mythology of Visnu's manifestations began to take shape, those

5                    6 .

terms first used were rupa (form), vapus (embodiment), and tanu (appearance
in certain specific aspects). 7     Whereupon, Pradurbhava (Manifestation) was
chosen as the most precise or rather approximate expression from which one
could choose.

Why?      The crucial significance of Pradurbhava is that "God manifests Himself
while remaining transcendent. 118                    - - probably implies that

Or: "The term pradubhava
the God continues to exist in His true unmanifest presence, although He mani-
fests Himself at the same time in definite forms (rupani) for particular

'l
purposes, presumably through His yuga powers.     But the idea involved in the
term avatara seems to be that either the whole (purnavatara) or a part
(amsavatara) of the Divine essence is imagined to descend from heaven, taking
a particular form (murti) or birth (janma). 119

In other words, God is transcendent.      The term Pradurbhava ensures and
preserves that transcendence in one's awareness.     The term Avatara threatens
the purity of the God-concept by ascribing to the Divinity motion (descent)
and substance (incarnation).    The idea of Avatar or Incarnation as such puts
flesh on the spirit, and then confuses the two at the moment of the union of
both universes.    For this reason, Pradurbhava is preferred to Avatara in the
earlier literature.    The resonance between Baha'u'llah's doctrine of Manifesta-
tion and Pradurbhava,from the phenomenology of religion perspective, is
significant.    (See Baha'u'llah's Tablet Of The Manifestation at the end of
this paper.

The Unific Force Of The Avatar Theory In Indian History
The Avatar-doctrine emerges as the most powerful notion in the history
of Hinduism due to the fact that the concept propelled into motion a unifying
religious synthesis.

Originally, different divinities like Rama, Krsna, Parasurama, and so
forth, appear to have flourished as the gods of independent religious cults.
These cults had founded, developed or preserved different and often competing
traditions, composed of historical or mythological legends or both.      Those
legends were heritages which could not be denied or forgotten.      But eventual.ly
such diverse heritages had to be brought into some sort of unity in order to
stave off conflict.    Which meant in most cases a patchwork heritage had to
somehow be evolved.    The patchwork or synthesis took shape in a mythological
chronology of stories along with a universalization of local events.

Over the course of time suGh arrangements brought about or made far more
possible federation of those cults to form what came to be known as Hinduism.
By representing diverse gods as successive manifestations of one single Lord

(Visnu), a more comprehensive unity of Godhood was sought.        The process had
extraordinary consequences, owing to its unific force.

Who is Kalki Visnuyasas?
A further significance of the Avatar doctrine goes beyond the marriage
of heritages into a single, sacred past.     There was, moreover, the assurance
that moral and social order would be restored during mankind's darkest hard-
ships.

So a future Avatar of Visnu appears in the sacred sagas of India to rein-
force and to augment hope in the hearts of her people.     A Messiah is promised.
Or is one?     Even the great philosopher Sri Aurobindo struggled with this very
uncertainty.    How much reliance can be placed on the prophetic accounts,
variant as they are, and what do those accounts signify?     This is Sri Auro-
bindo's approach to the problem, in the form of a warning:

> The Hindu procession of the ten Avatars is itself, as it were, a
> parable of evolution. First the Fish Avatar, then the amphibious
> animal between land and water, then the land animal, then the Man-Lion
> Avatar, bridging man and animal, then man as dwarf, small and unde-
> veloped and physical but containing in himself the godhead and taking
> possession of existence, then the Rajasic, sattwic, nirguna Avatars,
> leading the human development from the vital Rajasic to the sattwic
> mental man and again the overmental superman. Krishna, Buddha, and
> Kalki depict the last three stages, the stages of the spiritual de-
> velopment--Krishna opens the possibility of overmind, Buddha tries
> to shoot beyo.nd to the supreme liberation hut that liberation is :
> still negative, not returning upon earth to complete positively the
> evolution; Kalki is to correct this by bringing the Kingdom of the
> Divine upon earth, destroying the opposing Asura forces. The progres-
> sion is striking and unmistakable.
> As for the lives in between the Avatar lives, it must be remembered
> that Krishna speaks of many lives in the past, not only a few supreme
> ones, and secondly that while he speaks of himself as the Divine,
> in one passage he describes himself as a Vibhuti, vrsninam vasudevah.
We may therefore fairly assume that in many lives he manifested as the

Vibhuti veiling the fuller Divine Consciousness. If we admit
> that the object of Avatarhood is to lead the evolution, this is
> quite reasonable, the Divine appearing as Avatar in the great
> transitional stages and as Vibhutis to aid the lesser transitions.
> Too much importance need not be attached to the details about Kalki~
> they are rather symbolic than an attempt to prophesy details of future
> history. What is expressed is something that has to come, but it is
> symbolically indicated, no more.
> So too, too much weight need not be put on the exact figures about
> the Yugas in the Purana. Here again the Kala and the Yugas indicate
> successive periods in the cyclic wheel of evolution,--the perfect
> state, decline and disintegration of successive ages of humanity fol-
> lowed by a new birth--the mathematical calculations are not the im-
> portant element. The argument of the end of the Kali Yuga already
> come or coming and a new Satya Yuga coming is a very familiar one
and there have been many who have upheld it.

(Sri Aurobindo Birth Centenary Library (1970): Vol. 2, pp. 402-403.)
Aurobindo provides here a native insight sharp in its focus on Kalki:      One
should look to the prophecies as having little literal value.   The apocalyptic
details and age-computations embellish basic symbols of cycles in evolution.
These symbols are charged with much more deep meanings than are the specifics
and figures.   Aurobindo comes close to suggesting that what must come to just
as important as who is to come.   And that the prophecies offer us a sense of
the dynamics of social change in civilization.   This line of reasoning was
pursued by another great Indian philosopher, Radhakrishnan, in a small volume
entitled, Kalki: Future Of Civilization.

PART II:   THE-KALKI APOCALYPSE

Visnu's future advent as Kalki is for the first time foretold in the
Mahabharata (3:190:94).      The hero appears, so as to vanquish the godless.
Through purging the world of its mlecchas, Kalki brings forth the Truth Age
once more.     The barbarians conquered, orthodoxy is restored.
This late hero is born into a priest's family.     The child's full name is

g~ven   as Kalkin Visnuyasas, according to not only Mahabharata 3:190            , but

2:50 as well.        Other sources relate Visnyasas as an alias of Kalki, those

sources being, most notably, Harivamsa I:41, Vayu Purana 104,            and Brahmanda
Purana 2:111:73:104-124, where Kalki is known as Visnuyasas, son of Parasara.
Elsewhere, however, Kalki comes as Son of Visnuyasas.        Either confusion reigns
in the epic texts over who Visnuyasas is--(father or son?)--or perhaps both
bear Visnuyasas as a family cognomen.        Visnuyasas traD;slates as "Glory of
Visnu."

Interestingly enough, Kalki Visnuyasas emerges as a warrior out of priest's
clothing--an exceptional instance of caste mobility.        And yet, the original
caste-classes are to be restored when Kalki establishes order once more, accord-
ing to the Mahabharata.      The priests (Brahmanas) will wield sacral power again.
Clearly, such is a Hindu "Kingdom of God" on earth.         So should we expect, since
visions of Kalki's victory is the kind of monarchy under which priests could
flourish.     And those who took to composing the Kalki cycle of tradition in its
final forms were priests whose influence had       wa~d   and waned, as the sacerdotal
order slowly fell prey to encroaching secularism and was threatened by rival
religions.

So pro-orthodox is Kalki Visnuyasas that this terrible warrior takes a
flashing sword to both Buddhists and Jains alike.         And, in later texts, Kalki wars

upon Moslems!   The earth is to Qe dyed with. the Blood of daring heretics--by
Kalki's enormous military force!   Furthermore, Kalki's resemblance to tlie
warrior on the white steed, whose cloak is soaked in blood and whose orders
are to put pagans to the sword as foretold in the Apocalypse Of Saint John
The Divine (19:11-15), is astonishing.       O'Flagherty is convinced there is

almost assuredly a historical relationship oetween the two images.

Kalki's near massacre of Buddhists and Jains is pictured in th.e Kalki
Purana thus:

> At the end of the Age, Brahma created from his back an evil one
> known as Adharma. From him Kali was descended, foul-smelling and
> lustful, with gaping mouth and lolling tongue. He oegat Fear and
> a daughter named Death; thus were born the many descendants of Kali,
> revilers of dharma. Men then became lustful, hypocritical, and
> evil, intent upon penis and stomach, adulterers, drunkards, evil-
> doers. Ascetics took to houses, and householders were devoid of
> discrimination. The earth yielded few crops. Men aoandoned the
> study of the Vedas and sacrifices, and they ceased to offer obla-
> tions. The gods were all without sustenance, and they sough.t refuge
> with Brahma •.
> Then Visnu was born as Kalki. He amassed a great army to chastise
> the Buddha; he fought the Buddhists, who were led by the Jina, and
> he killed the Jina and defeated the Buddhists and the barbarians
> who assisted them. The wives of the Buddhists and oaroarians had
> also taken up arms, but Kalki taught them bhaki-yoga, karma-yoga
> and jnana-yoga (the three paths of the Bhagavad Gita}. Kalki then
continued his march and met Dharma, who had oeen driven out by Kali.

Kalki defeated Kali and his allies, but Kali escaped to anoth.er age.

The earliest episodal account of Kalki is foµnd in th. Mahabharata, as reported
before.   The motif of persecution of heretics--and Buddhists and Jains qualify
all too well--is pronounced from the very start:

> At the beginning of the Kali Age, Visnu will become the Buddha, son
> of Suddhodana, and he will be a bald preacher who will speak in the
> Magadha dialect and delude men. All men will become bald and take the
> acre robe, and priests will cease to offer oblations or recite the
> Vedas •••• Then, at the end of the Kali Age, a Brahmin named Kalkin,
> the son of Visnuyasas, will be born to uproot the oaygarians and
> heretics, and the final dissolution will take place.

If to qualify as Kalki Visnuyasas, Baha'u'llah.must have led campaign against
Buddhists and Jains, such identification is clearly impossiole.       Yet a more
profound relationship might exist, as will be shown below.

The Jains were certainly sensitive to Kalki's threat. In one sloka of
a Jain work known as the Harivamsa, after the founder Mahavira attains Nirvana,
a Kalki will appear every thousand years in order to preach a dharma quite

contrary to Jainism.

In fact, it is felt by some that Kalki was an actual king in history who
was one of the most, if not the most devastating arch-fiends of the Jains.
K. P. Jayaswal marshalled the argument that Kalki was to be identified with
Yasodharman. 18

A Closer Look At Kalki Visnuyasas
The title Kalki derives from Kalka, and would signify "the destroyer of
what is foul. 1119    Kalki, therefore, is first regarded as a destroyer of all that
is sinful, heterodox, or foreign--a view of Kalki Hindu descriptions justify.
Visnuyasas is a Sanskrit compound most often rendered "the Glory of

Visnu"        or "The Glory of God."   The striking similarity of names--Visnuyasas
and Baha'u'llah, both of which signify "the Glory of God"--has profoundly im-
pressed Indian Baha'is, who number several millions.        This phenomenon is
interesting and will deserve space later in this paper.

Corresponding with the advent of Kalki ·visnuyasas is the dawn of the
Krta Yuga or Golden Age.       Rather than being a particular, predestined juncture
in time, the twilight of the Kali or Dark Age starts to occur with the work

,
of the king mighty in righteousness.        Thus, Sukra states that "the king is
the maker of the age as the promulgator of duties and sins.        He is the cause
of the setting on foot of the customs and usages and hence is the cause or

n
maker of the times."   Nevertheless, predicative though Hindu prophecy is,
there does emerge an interesting specific prediction as to time:
yad&' candras ca suryas ca tatha ti~yabrhaspatl!

> ekara sau same~ yanti prapatsyati tada kftam//

> whole Yuga, bringing it to an end.

Next to the Mahabharata passage shown above, the Harivamsa preserves the
oldest epic prophecy regarding Kalki Visnuyasas.        Although various translators
such as O'Flagherty and D. N. Bose render Kalki Visnuyasas as "Kalki, son of
Visnuyasas," such does little justice to the earliest Kalki prophecies.        For
instance:

> kalki visnuyasa nama sambhale namake dvijah/
> sarvaloka-hitarthaya bhuyas cotpasyate prabhuh//
> dasamo bhav!Ja-sampanno yajnavalkya-purahsarah/
> ksapayitva ca tan sarvan bhavinarthena coditan//
ganga-yammunayor madhye nistham prapsyati sanugah//

IIv I, 41, 164-166a)
These verses and more are rather freely translated by Bose so:

> 0 king! I have narrated to you the past incarnations of Narayana
> for the good of humanity. Now I will tell you His future incar-
> nations; please listen to me. At the end of His tenth incarnation,
> the Lord Narayana will again descend on earth for the good of the
> world and be born as the son of Visnuyasa in the village called
> Samvala. He will be· known in this incarnation as Kalki. In this
> incarnation Kalki as a companion of Yajnavalkya will first defeat
> the · Buddhas of the Kshanika schooi in argument and then destroy them;
> He will then rest in the region between the Ganges and the Jamuna.
> Afterwards nobody will be satisfied with his own wife, and each will
> try to snatch the wife of the other; a general fight will start and
> kings and subjects with ministers and men will be annihilated;
> anarchy will reign, and as there will be no king, the strong will
> rob the weak. All these will happen in the evening of the Kali ~;
> there will be intense distress and desolation; but with the close of
> the Kali ~ all these will also end. At the end of the Kali ~,
the Satya ~ will again come. The people of their own accord will only

do what is right. The Vrahmavadins speak of these and other in-
> carnations of Narayana in the Purangs. Even the gods are overwhelmed
> (with awe and excitement) while describing the incarnations of
> Narayana. I only narrate very briefly His incarnations. The nar-
> ration of the incarnations of Narayana pleases the pitris. Those
> who reverentially listen to the mystic and mysterious life-histories
> of the Lord of all the yugas, are freed from all sins. Through the
> grace of Narayana, they enjoy plenty and prosperity.
This is a development of the legend of Kalki Visnuya§as which finds place in the

Aranyaka Parva of the Mahabharata (III:l88:89f.).        In the passage above where
the word "incarnation(s)" is given, the actual term in the text itself is
Pradurbhava or "Manifestation." 23    Perhaps we overstress this point, but it
is so often overlooked.

Later Kalki prophecies will be modelled on these prior texts.      For example,
the Brahma Purana states:

> kalki visnuyasa nama sambhala-grama-sambhavah/
> sarvaloka-hitar'thaya bluyo devo mahayasah//
This verse nearly reproduced Harivamsa I:41:164 quoted already. 24     We dis-
cover a trait of Hindu texts which actually is rather universal:      prophecies·
become more and more elaborate as speculations find nourishment over the years
·and centuries in the ripe minds of priests.    The Kalki Purana gives us a most
ornate and romantic document of this process.     The extent to which Hindu
prophecies and especially the Kalki Purana serve as a litarary crystal ball
will be treated later in this paper.

So far, we have shown that the Avatar theory was a powerful dynamic in Hindu
thought.   Originally the doctrine was one of "Manifestation" rather than "In-
carnation," the term Pradubhava having been current earlier.      Historically, the
Avatar concept was significant since it was instrumental in bringing about a
confederation of independent cults.     The progression of Avatars is for Aurobindo
"a parable of evolution."   The prophecies on Kalki are symbolic also.        Some con-
fusion persists over the name Visnuyasas, associated with Kalki.      Kalki

prophecies become more and more fanciful in the Hindu tradition down the
centuries.

The Dark Age Prior.To The Sworded Warrior's Advent
The following selections afford a most lurid picture of theDark Age
or Kali Yuga which Kalki comes to close.    These descriptions document an
alarmingly keen insight tothe·outcome of moral decay, which appear sur-
prisingly enough, to apply to our own times.   However, scholars have ob-
served that the descriptions almost certainly lament conditions already
prevalent at the time of the composition.   Representative prophecies follow
below:

> In the age of Kali men will become slaves of women and miserable.
> Sexual pleasure being the (only) ground of their affection •••• Those
> who have no knowledge of religion will occupy high seats and preach
> religion. Oppressed with famine and (heavy) taxation,--land being
> divested of foodgrains,--and striken with fear of droughts, people
> in the Kali age will ever remain perturbed of mind.
> (Srimad Bhagavata Mahapurana 12:3:37,38,39)
> In the Kali age wealth alone will be the criterion of pedigree, morality
> and merit ••• Capability of affording sexual delight will be the (only)
> criterion of masculine or feminine excellence •••• Justice will have every
> chance of being vitiated because of one's inability to gratify those
> administering it, and voluble speech will be the (only) criterion
> of scholarship. Want of riches will be the sole test of impiety and
> hypocrisy the only touchstone of goodness. (Mutual) consent will be
> the sole determining factor in marriage ••••
> (Srimad Bhagavata Mahapurana 12:2:2,3,4,5)
> Filling one's belly will be the (only) end of human pursuit and auda-
> city of speech will be the only criterion of veracity •••• When religion
> is replaced by heresy to a large extent and rulers mostly turn out to be
> thieves, ••• annual plants get stunted in growth and trees are mostly re-
> duced to the size of a sami (a small tree); ••• and dwellings will mostly
> lo.ok desolate (for want of hospitality to strangers); in this w~y the
> Kali age, whose career is so severe to the people, is well-nigh past,
> the Lord will appear in His divine form for the protection of virtue.
> (Srimad Bhagavata Mahapurana 12:2:6,12-16)
> The Lord will appear under the name Kalki in the house of the high-souled
> Vishnuyas~ (Glory of God)--the foremost Brahman of the village of
> Sambhala. Riding a fleet horse named Devadutta and capable of subduing
> the wicked, the Lord of the universe, wielding eight divine powers and
> possessed of (endless) virtues and matchless splendour, will traverse
> the globe on that swift horse and exterminate with His sword in tens of
> millions robbers wearing the insignia of royalty •••• When the moon, the
> sun and the Jupiter rise together in one zodiacal house and the Pusya
> constellation is in the ascendant, then it will be Satyayuga.
(Srimad Bhagavata Mahapurana 12:2:18-20,24.)

The Srimad Bhagavata   Mah:a~urana    is the greatest of all the Purartas
in terms of the vast popularity and reverence it enjoys in India.        This
Mahapurana devotes an entire Canto (X} to the life and legends of Krsna.
Canto XI comprises Krsna's last teachings ever given, according to the story,
and are confided to a disciple known as Uddhava.        Hence, the Uddhava Gita,
which is sometimes published separately.        Can.to XII, from which ex-
cerpts were just shown, is prophetic outwardly out evidently emlieds a
wealth of historical matter, especially old dynasty lists, periods of
reign, and geneologies as well.    The above extracts were selected from the
popular Gita Press version.

Proceeding now to another very popular epic, the Visnu Purana, we en-
counter descriptions of a kindred nature:

> These will all be contemporary monarchs reigning over the earth;
> kings of churlish spirit, violent temper, and ever addicted to
> falsehood and unrighteousness. They will inflict death on women,
> children and cows; they will seize upon the property of others;
> they will be of limited power, and will, for the most part,
> rapidly rise and fall; their lives will be short, their des·ires
> insatiable; and they will display but little ~harma. The people
> of various countries will intermingle with them and follow their
> example; and the barbarians, being powerful under the patronage
> of princes, and the purer tribes, acting in a contrary manner
> (viparyayena vartamanah), will destroy the people.. Wealth and
> piety will decrease day by day, until the world will be wholly
> depraved. Then property alone wiil confer rank; wealth will be
> the only source of Dharma; passion will be the sole bond of union
> between the sexes; falsehood will be the only means of success
> in litigation; and women will be objects merely of sexual grati-
> fication. The Earth will be venerated but for her mineral
> treasures; the Brahmanical thread will constitute a Brahman;
> external types will be the only distinctions of the several orders
> of life; dishonesty will be the (universal) means of subsistence;
> weakness will be the cause of dependence; menace and presumption
> will be substituted for learning; liberality will constitute
> Dharma; simple ablution will be purification; mutual assent will
> be marriage; fine clothes will be dignity; and water or a temple
> afar off will be esteemed as a holy place (tirtha). Amidst all
> castes, he who is the strongest will reign over a principality

thus vitiated by many faults.. Th.e people,. unal)le to '.bear the·· :: ,
> heavy burdens imposed upon them by their avaricious sovereigns,
> will take refuge amongst the valleys of the mountains, and will
> be glad to feed upon (wild) honey, herbs, roots, fruits, leaves
> and flowers; their only covering will be the bark of trees; and
> they will be exposed:~to cold, and wind, and sun, and rain. No
> man's life will exceed three and twenty years. Thus, in the Kali
> age, shall decay 2giistantly proceed, until the human race approaches
> its annihilation.
> When the practices taught by the Vedas and the institutes of law
> shall nearly have ceased, and the close of the Kali age shall be
> nigh, a portion of that Divine Being who exists of His own spiritual
> nature in the character of Brahma, and Who is the Beginning and
> the End, and Who comprehends all things, shall descend upon the
> earth: He will be born in the family of Vishuyashas, an eminent
> Brahman of Sambhala village, as Kalki, endowed with the eight
> superhuman faculties. By His irresistible might He will destroy
> all the Mlecchas · and thieves, and all whose minds are devoted
> to iniquity. He will then re-establish righteousness upon earth;
> and the minds of those who live at the end of the Kali age shall
> be awakened, and shall be as pellucid as crystal. The men who
> are thus changed by virtue of that peculiar time shall be as the
> seeds of human beings, and shall give birth to a race who shall
> follow the laws of the Kri ta age, or age of purity. As it is said~
"When the sun and moon, and the lunar asterisni. Tishya, and the

planet Jupiter are in one mansion, the Krita age shall return."

The Iconography Of Kalki Visnuyasas
A further source of our knowledge of Kalki Visnuyasas comes from icons.

Emil Abegg in his masterful work, Der Messiasglaube In Indien Und Iran (Berlin
and Leipzig: Walter de Gruyter & Co., 1928), reproduces three distinct re-
presentations of Kalki.

One of the Kalki icons presented in Der Messiasglaube .(which continues to
be the major monograph on Kalki to date) is that of a sworded warrior--but
with a horse's head!       Two lines of tradition find distinction here.     The first
is of a popular nature, where Visnu manifests as a white stallion, rippling
·with power and blazing sheen.       The other is of course the warrior astride a

military steed.         The warrior's association with the charger evidently re-

lates back to the old folk notions of power embodied in the horse.

Banerjea, in his treatise on the iconography of incarnations, relates
that in the Matsya Purana, the final Avatar will enter the world as:

> Kalkin, the son of Visnuyasah, and the great sage Yajnavalkya will
> be his priest. Then .;gain the Vartiasramadharma, good works and
> piety will be re-established and Hari after fulfilling his mission
> of restoration of 'dharma' will ascend to Heaven. This idea about
> the future incarnation of Visnu is directly associated with the
> 'Bhagavadgita' conception of the descent of the lord in various forms
> for restoring virtue and destroying vice. The same Purana describes
> two varieties of Kalki images, in one of which, evidently two-armed,
> he is endowed with a bow and a quiver full of arrows, in the other,
> a four-armed variety, he is depicted riding on horseback and holding
> a sword, a conchshell, a wheel and an arrow (ch. 49, 9: 'Dhanustunan-
> vita~ KalkI mlecchotsadakaro dvijah/ Athavasvasthitah khadgi san-
> khacakrasaranvitah'). The 'Hayasirsa Pancaratra' also speaks of
> these two varieties, two-armed and four-armed, the objects held in
> the hands of the same being almost identical ('Kalkinam tu caturbahum
> vaddhatUnam dhanurddharam/ Sankhacakradharam kuryattatha khadgadhara;
prabhum/i Dvibhujam va hayarudham, khadgapa~im suresvaram/ K~lkinam

sthapayitvaivam S~krasthanam. labhenn~rah'). • The 'Visnudharmottar~'

> describes Kalk! as two-armed with a sword in his raised hand, riding
> on horseback, and should be depicted in an angry mood ('Khadgodya-
> takarah kruddho hayarudho mahabalah/ Mlecchocchedakarap Kalki dvib-
> huj ah parikirttitah'). But the 'Vaikhanasagama' description of
> Kalkin is interesting on account of the fact that of the two varieites
> of his images, one should be horse-faced and the other with the face
> of man; his four hands should carry 'cakra,' 'sankha,' 'khadga' and
> 'khetaka' and he should be fierce-looking; his 'kautukabera' should be
> like an ordinary four-armed Visnu image. These different descrip-
> tions of Kalkin are not all illustrated in plastic or pictorial form,
> the only variety almost invariably represented there is the two-armed
> one shown on horseback with a sword in raised right hand, the left
> holding the reins of the prancing horse. Separate figures of this
> Avatara are unknown to me.

Mostly, Kalki images have been found in the aureole or encircling radiance ·
of Visnu representations in company with the other incarnations.      Although rare,
occasionally small images were depicted separately and sometimes one or two
vassals are shown holding a Chattra over Kalki.      In the image with two servants
a sceptre is shown, pendent on Kalki's side from the belt girding his waist,
while the Gartida (or huge eagle on which Visnu rides) is shown soaring directly

above Kalki.

Furthermore, Kalki's steed is shown with right hoof raised, poised in
anticipation.       This poised foreleg is held in suspense until the time for
Kalki's advent arrives.       The hoof will then paw the ground with apocalyptic
potency. 31

As Erwin R. Goodenough        points out, symbols become like heraldry, a
> kind of identification.   Deeper knowledge of icongraphic symbols promises
> to open up a new frontier for the historian.       Religious symbols embody
> the heart of an otherwise silent populace.       For history most often gives
> us an elite presentation of events dominated by the powerful.       Rarely are
> we shown what the common villager felt and thought, hoped for and spoke.
> But into their symbols these silent villagers have projected their hearts
> and beings.   Those symbols have not lost this.      We have only to recapture
> what symbols have for centuries treasured.       Therefore, religious symbols
> survive as the greatest unexplored territory of historical data.       For this
> reason, Kalki icons must be explored far more deeply.

The Major Hindu Apocalypse: The Kalki Purana
Although little known in the west, the Kalki Purana emerges as the major
> Apocalypse (or prophetic revelation of the future) within Hindu tradition.
> 'The Kalki Purana comes down to us as India's most fully developed Apocalypse,
> notwithstanding the fact that it is actually one of the Upapuranas or lesser
> epics.   Even so, the work is also known as Anubhagavata, showing it to be
> a sequel to the Twelfth Canto of ·:the Srimad Bhagavata Mahapurana.     The Kalki
> Purana at its end tells its audience that 6,100 slokas or verses compose the
total work.   But addition only yields 1,318.      Possibly the surviving version

· has been cut down from a larger work.

Perhaps the most outspoken appraisal of the Kalki Purana was given in
> controlled candor by H. C. Norman, in the abstract of a fuller version which,
> so far as I know, never appeared in print--a lamentable fact.       In "The Kalki
> Avatara Of Visnu" abstracted in Transactions Of The Third International Congress
> For the History Of Religions (Oxford, 1908): pp. 85-89, Norman relates:

The Purana is a strange jumble of featureless character, conventional
> battles, allegorical ideas, and hymns in praise of Visnu, Siva and
> the Ganga. The hero has nothing but his divinity to distinguish him
> from the typical prince of a Kavya. His performance is nothing more
> than the Digvijaya of a Cakravartiraja. As regards the horse, which
> has been frequently compared with the white horse in Rev. XIX.11,
> very little is said about it. We find it once furiously kicking the
> two demons Koka and Vikoka without slaying them, and it also carried
> Kalki over to Ceylon to win his bride. Like Kanthaka, the Buddha's
> horse, it is only one of the appendages of the Cakravarti, and seems
> to have most in common with the Horse-Treasure of the Mahasudassana-
> Sutta (Sacred Books Of The East, xi, p. 255).
> The Kalki-Purana is apparently not very well known in India, and seems
> to be an expansion of the short account of Kalki at the end of the
> Bhagavata Purana, which is the authority generally acknowledged.
> The romantic details of his career do not represent any real tradi-
> tion. The work is instructive as showing how a pious Bhagavata
> might envisage the coming of the liberator of humanity. Western
> writers seem to have jumped to the conclusion that Kalki must be
> the same as the conqueror of the Revelation; but at any rate the
> Indian account gives us a developed idea of a totally different kind,
> whatever the· germ may be.

Most religions, if not all, place hope within both present and future.

The past, as heritage, serves to range the believer within a sacred process
of events.   The future is the treasury of potential destiny.   The present
is where history and destiny are wed through will power and deed.    Knowledge
and wisdom refine one's will to a skill.   One strives, through spiritual dis-
cipline, to master destiny, rather than to suffer as its victim.

Yet.there are times so black and ruinous that little hope is possible
for the present.   Such circumstances offer little consolation, except
through the future.   When hopelessness becomes a collective phenomenon,
experienced by a people, a form of crisis literature often develops.     We
might broadly call this crisis literature apocalxptic.   Apocalyptic litera-
ture telescopes one's awareness into how present conditions will eventuate,
to give insight farsightedness.

Yet the Kalki Purana is complex, as apocalypses are.   It seems to defy
the traditional position--that the Kalki apocalypse is a kind of divine

time machine.    For historians now, this may well be.    But not into the
future; rather, we are transported into the past.       The projected "future"
is by the scholar inverted into itself.    Here both motives as well as
leitmotiv     come into view.   The Kalki apocalypse turns out to be a very
telling document, in a surprising way.

The Story And Exploits Of Kalki
As has been told before, the Kalki Purana has defied complete translation
into English, for whatever reasons.    Yet we are given two nearly complete
accounts of the major episodes by R. C. Hazra (Studies In The Upapuranas:
Vol. I, pp. 303-308) and by H. C. Norman in the abstract cited above.

Kalki is every bit as royal, warring, and championing of Hindu India
as is the royal Messiah for the struggling sovereignty of Israel.

The Kalki Purana, curiously, relates future events in past tense.

Essentially a war story, Kalki's mission is to conquer Earth.       Kalki's pur-
pose is also to restore the old form of religion.       For the world has swerved
from the old ways, and so occurs the reverse; too, since the priests end up
following after suspect and inert, if not hurtful doctrines.       Kalki is princi-
pally a restorer, rather than revealer.

The very evils pictured in both the Bhagavata and Visnu Puranas populate
the world of the Kalki Purana.     Into this riot of lust Kalki is born.     Kalki's
father, Visnuyasas, is a priest in the village of Sambhala.       Much to the
father's astonishment, Kalki is born with four arms.       Visnuyasas reduced them
to two.    Otherwise, Kalki's youth follows the precious invisibility of the
usual.    Kalki is brought up, however, under a most unusual teacher, who is
Parasurama, who had come from an earlier age, followed by various sages, to
honor Kalki as a newborn, in a Christ-like nativity.

Parasurama, himself a military Avatar, at last tells Kalki that he is an
Avatara of Visnu, and foretells Kalki's conquest of the earth.      Whereupon
Kalki praises Siva, who bestows upon the youth rewards of "a winged horse
going whither it listeth and multiform and a parrot all-knowing," also "a
terrible sword with jewelled handle and of great lustre."       Moreover, Siva
reveals to Kalki the ultimately open secret that mankind will honor Kalki
as master of all weapons, as consunnnate in knowledge of the fourfold Vedas,
and as a vanquisher of all beings.

Kalki rides away with his gifts and, after proclaiming to his own country-
men what had just taken place, goes off and enlists under his banner King
Visakhayupa of the city of Mahiqmati.       The parrot thereupon artfully praises
Ceylon, its king and especially the king's daughter, Padma, who is really

- magically preserved for Kalki, who marries her and reverses the curse
Lakqmi,
which had fallen upon her misfortunate suitors, who had been turned into
women.     After saving these doomed wooers from the wretched destiny of being
female, Kalki returns to commence his conquest of Earth.

The first campaign is against the Buddhists of Kikata.       Yet it is the
Jains who are first vanquished in battle.       The terrified Buddhists suppli-
cate Maya, who ends up uniting with Kalki, much to everyone's surprise.
Whereupon the wives of the "Bauddhas" sally forth to fight, only to find
their very own weapons cautioning against such ill use of arms!       So the
wives seek refuge in Visnu, to find true spiritual lives.

More blood spills wherever Kalki marches to fight.       Kalki slays terrible
demons, as well as terrible men.     Kalki conquers the world of India, then
divides the sovereignties of her various kingdoms amongst his companions
and relatives.     Visnuyasas retires as a holy man and dies.    The golden age
arrives.

K.alki enjoys a life of unbridled pleasure and feasting.        Yet,
since the gods beg him to return, Kalki gives up the luxury of spoils
of war and bequeaths the kingdom to all four sons, and departs from this
earthly world.   So ends the major Hindu Apocalypse.

The Kalki Purana draws from myths composed during a time of crisis,
for otherwise, the hope for religious vengeance would not be the most
profound wish of the whole document.         The progressive universality of
the apocalypse's vision is somewhat neutralized by its very transparent
prejudice against other religions.       Conversion through force is a rather
oppressive sentiment, which must have been generated from a position of
weakness which Hinduism was then experiencing during the time of writing.

One must not fear honesty of approach to a religious document.

The Kalki apocalypse is very human.         There is no doubt that the future-
tense story is a wish-image of the priestly class.         As such, the
apocalypse functions both as a protest, an outcry, as well as a prayer.
The purpose of the Kalki Purana is also to bring hope to the reader,
to steel.him or her in resolve to persevere through times of oppression.
Such hope is indeed a kind of escape from time.
In chapter-colophons of various manuscripts of the Kalki Purana, the

statement is made:        --iti Sri-kalki-purane anubhagavate bhavisye •••• "
In claiming to be a continuation of the Bhagavata Mahapurana, the Kalki
apocalypse is shown to be of late date, being composed after the major
epics were in circulation. · Furthermore, that it is a late work is known
from the fact that, as Hazra points out, it is never referred to or drawn
upon by any of the numerous Smrti-writers.         Textually speaking, the claim
to reveal the future is much like the medicine man in the Wizard of Oz
whose crystal ball augur is augmented by a furtive photograph.

PART THREE:   THE HISTORICITY OF KALKI VISNUYASAS

The Historicity Of Gods And Demons In General
Various conjectures have been ventured as to the origins of the
Vedic, Epic and Puranic pantheon of gods.      Those speculations mostly
fall within natural, symbolic, psychological, fabulous or ancestral
provinces of possibility.

If we look to the Hindu scriptures themselves, we shall find that
it is not always true that "dead men tell no tales."

According to the most ancient scripture of India, the Rig Veda
(10:63:7), all the gods have sprung from the loiris of Manu, son of
Vivasvant.     If Manu is accepted as being a human lawgiver, which is how
India regards him, there would be potent force to the thesis that all
gods were once men.

The later priestly commentaries on the Vedas accord with the view:
"A hundred times greater is the happiness of the saints who through
ritual observances have become gods" (Taittiriya Upanishad II Valli,"8
Anuvaka, 3).     Sir Charles Eliot observed:

"But though in one way the gods seem vague and impersonal, in
another the distinction between gods and men is slight.      The Brahmanas
tell us that the gods were originally mortal and obtained immortality by
offering sacrifices:     the man who sacrifices like them makes for himself
an immortal body in the abode of the gods and practically becomes a Deva
and the bliss of great sages is declared equal to the bliss of the
gods. 1134

"Strange to say that these (gods) seem to be the names of distin-
guished personages in the Sattvata or Vrishni clan.      Mere deification

occurs in many countries but the transformation of heroes into meta-
physical or psychological terms could hardly have happened outside
India. 1135

This concept of forefathers as those who won godship through deeds
of merit and sacrifice excited the aspirations of those to whom those
tales were told.     The transformation of past ancestors from clods of
clay into beings of luminous immortality is found throughout the Rig

Veda.

Conversely, it is also true that men could draw the curse of
becoming demons.    As early as the Satapatha Brahmana (3:2:1:24),
barbarians are called demons.        O'Flagherty says "this confusion persists
in later texts. 1137

Is Kalki Visnuyasas An Historical Personage?
This is a touchy subject.     So far, dealing with Avatars of the past
posed little threat to existing theological constructs.        But now, in sub-
jecting to scrutiny the Messianic figure of Kalki Visnuyasas, we cruise
close to the isle of hope.     Although America would largely be in total
darkness as to who Kalki is, were it not for Gore Vidal's best seller
novel, Kalki; there are spiritual connnunities as well as individuals in
India who place great faith in the coming of Kalki.        To tell them that
Kalki must be appreciated in a careful way, if we are to preserve our
scientific integrity, might sound like doubting hope out of existence
through that invincible and inexorable sword known as analysis.        This is
a risk which must be taken.

Kosambi, the famous Indian mathematician, arose with a mighty im-
portant observation, spelled out in a contribution entitled, "The Avatara
Syncretism And Possible Sources Of The Bhagavad-Gita."

"But there does appear a Brahmin avenger Kalki-Visnuyasas just after
the kali age, too late this    ~ime   as Krsna was too early, who slaughters
the heathen (in later accounts Jains and Buddhists) to make the world safe
for Brahminism ••• "

"The Kalki episode has all the earmarks of a historical event dis-
guised as a prophecy.    We do know of a Krta or Kalki era which coincides
approximately with the Vikrama era; there is very good reason.to believe
in the occurrence of several local conflicts against invaders, from what
remains to us of historical records, including such stories as the Jain
acarya Kalaka.     If the event had not been local, it would have been better
recorded; but it was important enough to give some groups of Brahmins
cause for gratitude, sufficient to preserve and exalt the name of the
hero ••• "

"The Kalki (::::;Anu-Bhagavata 3:8:1 ff.) Purana shows this hero
promoted to a full incarnation ••• That Kalki still remains a future
messianic avenger is due to his comparative obscurity; originally it
was necessary to put the whole account as a prqphecy in order to keep the
main narrative at the time of the great war, while adding to the authority
of the Mahabharata by inclusion of an episode well-known to the
diaskeuasts.     Closer identification of Kalki would lead to information
about the time of the redaction and perhaps the place; the fact of a
Brahmanical renaissance is clear."

Kalki's vengeance thunderstorms three principal religious communities
in Hindu apocalypse, those being: (1) Jains, (2) Buddhists, (3) Moslems.
Let us now focus on Kalki's conquest of these rival religions.

Kalki's Campaign Against The Jains
According to several       s~holars,   Kalki Visnuyasas was an historical
personage.   In order to have determined this, a natural point of departure
was, of course, Kalki's name itself.          "Prophecies" are found to have very
telling memories.

Visnuyasas is generally recognized as the king whose Messianic
title would be Kalki.        Visnuyasas would be the given name by which Kalki
would first be known.

The authoritative Purana Index (University of Madras_, 1955),
enters Visnuyasas (Vol. III: p. 288) as "another name of Kalki to be born
to a Brahman of Sambhalagrama" (Bhagavata I:3:25; XII:2:18; Visnu IV:24:98;
Brahmanda III:73:104; Vayu 98:104).

K. P. Jayaswal observes that earlier Puranas give Visnuyasas as the
earthly appellation of Kalki. The Vayu Purana states that Visnu-Yasas was

-.-    38

born of the family of Parasara.          The Matsya Purana slips a little on the
spelling, referring to Kalkin as Visnu-Yasasa, the leader of the

Parasaras, as against Visnu-Yasa of the Brahmanda Purana.             The Bhagavata
Purana, moreover, "improves" on this mistake of the Matsya and makes Kalki

a son of Visnu-Yasas!

Now the name   Visnu-Ya~as     proves to be a major clue to who the Kalki
of Jaina tradition should be.        There survive several stinging stories sur-
rollllding a certain sovereign surnamed King Kalki, who was most cruel to
the Jains.

Perhaps the foremost Jaina record of King Kalki (Kalki-raja) is embodied
in the Hari-VB.lllsa Purana, the author of which is Jinaseni-Suri, who
belonged to the Digambara sect of the Jaina Faith.          Jinaseni-Suri's
Hari Vamsa Purana is· a work which dates from the year 705 of the Saka

.
era.          The mention of well-known contemporary kings secures our confidence
in the correctness of this date.          Therefore, the work was without doubt

composed during the year 783-784 A.D.

Jinasena gives a chronology of events since the death of Maha-Vira,
the founder of Jainism.          In an explicit passage (Hari-Va.itisa 60:552-553),
Jinasena records that a King Kalki flourished 1000 years after the Maha-

vira and that. Kalki-Raja was a terrible persecutor of the Jains.

Another Jaina chronicler, known as Gw;i.abhadra, in his Uttara Purana,
provides further details regarding Kalki-Raja.            This king appeared in
the year 1000 after vira-Nirva~a, in Pafaliputra, as the son of King
,,. ,,.
Sisupala.

-       Kalki-Raja was also known as Caturmukha, who ruled over the whole
earth for forty years, until death took him at the age of 70 (Uttara Purana
Parva 76: Stanzas 397-401 and 428).            Kalki-Raja is pictured by Gunabhadra
as oppressive.          Yet the only instance given is that King Kalki was stubborn

in his refusal to exempt Jaina monks from taxes.

But the Kalki-Raja of Jaina tradition remains a rather nebulous
monarch until linked to a known historical personage.            This is where Kalki's
alias -- Visnu-Yasas forges the missing link.            According to Jayaswal,
Visnu-Yasas represents a compression of the fuller title: Visnu-(Vardhana)
Yasas (Dharman) of Malva.          King Yaso-Dharman is known, from the year 589

of the Malava era column of victory, also as Visnu-Vardhana.

Who Was Ya§o-Dharman, Known as Kalki-Raja?
Yasodharman was a Central Indian Raja or King who dealt defeat to
a white hun tyrant known as Mihirakula.             This invader was probably
the king of a Himalayan country, "a small kingdom in the north" as
Line 6 of the Mandasor Stone Pillar inscription suggests. 45

Evidently, Yasodharman forged a confederacy of neighboring inde-
pendent Indian states for     th~   purpose of thwarting the Hunnish menace,
to throw off the foreign yoke.        This was a supreme feat since Mihirakula

was the most formidable    H~a   monarch of India.
Waves of Central Asian invading swarms led to a fifteen year reign

(circa 515-530 A.D.) of Mihirakula, give or take several years.
Mihirakula had   a vast   empire, including possibly the whole of India,

••
accor ding to Hsuan-                           . 48

Tsang, a Ch.1nese p il grim.
So it appears to be clear that Yasodharman and Visnuvardhana,

the identity and equivalence of which have been conclusively proved,
are two names which, when compressed, yield Visnu-Yasas, who is Kalki.

This explains why the Puranas treat Kalki little differently than
any other historical king.       But just as Kalki is put into future tense,
so also is he placed in past tense.        For instance, the Vayu Purana records
that Visnu-Yasas "although an ordinary man was born of a portion of the
Deity."    "He flourished in Kaliyuga. 1150    Moreover, the Matsya Purana, after
relating Kalki's conquests, tells us:         "Time having past that king disap-
peared.1151   Thus there is evidence that an historical Kalki did usher
in a Golden Age for Hinduism, an age which was to last for nearly five
centuries, wherein India enjoyed almost total immunity from foreign

invasion, until Islamic armies darkened the horizon.

.Kalki's Persecution Of The Buddhists
Not only did Kalki oust Jainism from Northern India, but Buddhism as
well.     The principal advocate for this historical position was     D~   R.
Mankad, whose contribution, "Kalki--The Earliest Check To Buddhism,"
appeared in the New Indian Antiquary (Vol. 4, No. 10 (January, 1942):
pp. 337-343).
The Kalki Purana has been, for the most part, overlooked for its

historical value.          The Kalki Purana, along with other Puranas,'. declares
that, in a village called Shambhala, a son was born to the Brahman chief
Visnuya~as.    The boy was called Kalki, probably because, later on, he dis-
guised himself as a warrior.
Kalki was born during the reign of King       Vi~akhayupa.    The Kalki

~     -                                         54

Purana states that Visakhayupa came to pay homage to Kalki at birth.
Kalki, when grown, forms a confederacy of kings, one which begins with
Visakhay~pa (King of Magadha), the next to join being Sumitra55 (King
of Kosala) and Ksemaka (King of Kausambi), then .an obscure king, Rucirasva.
This confederacy of four or five kings, under the able generalship of
Kalki, waged a campaign against the Buddhists and others.          Kalki appears
to have been a resourceful statesman as well as an accomplished warrior.
Mankad concludes:        "Thus Buddhism met with its first check within about
10 to 15 years of Buddha's death ••• as a result of which Buddhism or Jainism
could never take the place of paramount religion in India.          Herein lies
the triumph of Kalki ••• a link of our religio-political history which is
so well preserved for us in the Kalki Purana. 1156

Kalki's Conquest Of The Muhammadans
Jayaswal places Kalki around 453 A.D. to 543 A.D. ·This dating is
at variance with that of Mankad, who proposes a date one thousand years
earlier.   Now if Kalki is also to conquer the Arabian invaders, this
creates a further historical dissonance.

What is the evidence that Kalki is to destroy the supremacy of
Islamic sovereignty in India?        This is more a popular, grassroots wish
which took shape as a form of religious resistance than anything else.

This folk apocalyptic lietmotiv was recorded in the Dabistan, or School
of Manners, written in India by Mohsan Fani in the seventeenth century.
The Dabistan relates of Kalki:

> The tenth Avatar is to occur at the expiration of the
> Kali-jug, for the purpose of destroying the Mlechas, or
> "enemies of the Hindoos." The Kalki Avatar is to take
> place on the third of Bhadun, in the Shakl Pachah, in the
> city of Sumbul, in the house of a Brahman named Jasa.
> Kalki is also to be of the Brahman caster He will destroy
> the corruptions of the world, and all the Mlechas, that is,
> Muhammedans, Christians, Jews, and such like, are to be
entirely extirpated5 after which the Satyog, or "golden

> age," is to return.

Note that Christians and Jews are also included as "enemies of the
Hindoos," which appears to include the votaries of every rival religious
tradition.    In this context, Kalki could hardly be thought of as the return
of Christ per   ~·

Most of the Puranas are medieval in final redaction. This accounts
for the transparent reference to Muhammadans, after the fact.       In Puranic
Records, Hazra shows that by the word "mleccha" the Agni Purana (ch. 49)
means those barbarian dynasties which established kingdoms in India after
the death of the Kushan king Vasudeva.       This is the general tenor of the
term.    But in a specific sense it is directed at the Muhammadans who
invaded India arotmd the ninth century A.D.      Kalki is often described as
"the exterminator of the Mlecchas" (mlecchot sadakara).       It is clear that
the Kashmirian polymath   ~ememdra,   who flourished in the eleventh century
A.D., used mlecchato refer especially to Moslem hordes who violated the
peace of India through attacks and massacres (Dasavatara-Carita).

"Vengeance Is Mine"
The principal mission of Kalki is vengeance. Repeating Kosambi's observati
"But there does appear a Brahmin avenger Kalki-Visnuyasas just after the

Kali age, too late this time as Krsna was too early, who slaughters the
heathen (in later accounts Jains and Buddhists) to make the world safe
for Brahminism ••• nie Kalki episode has all the earmarks of a historical
event'.disguised as a prophecy."   Kalki is always associated with the final
stages of the dark and ruinous age, Kali Yuga.    Corroborating in a more
general way what Kosambi and others had to say of the historicity of Kalki,
L. M. Toshi recently wrote:
"'nle theory of kaliyuga thus does not ref er to a mythical world-

> epoch; it refers to a real but complex phenomenon in the religious
> history of India ••• 'nle real content of the doctrine of kaliyuga
> corresponds to an historical situation full of ideological tensions.
> It mirrors the reactions of Brahmanical theologians towards powerful
> spiritual ideologies which were outside of and ran counter to Vedic

> "'nlis is, properly speaking, an interesting phenomenon in the religious
> history of a country the people of which espouse a plurality of faiths •
> •• In our opinion the theory of four yugas in general and of kaliyuga

> (L.M. Joshi: "A Seventeenth Century Perspective On Kaliyuga": in:
> Punjab University Journal Of Medieval Indian Literature: Vol. 2 (1978):
pp. 67-75 (esp. pp. 73 and 68).

Multiple Appearances Of Kalki Visnuyasas
A mysterious birthdate for Kalki appears in the Chhinnamasta Khanda
of the Saktisangamatantra. In the sixth Pantala, is found the following
curious passage:

10. In the year called the Durmukha and in the month of
> Margasir~a, on the 2nd day of the bright fortnight when the
> Moon will occupy the constellation of Purvasa~ha and when the
> Vrddhi Y~ga will be on, and when the night will advance by three
> Ghatik~s, the Lord will manifest himself as Kalki with the sole
> obj~ct of destroying the Bhallasura. 58              ·
Another specimen of a precise date for Kalki occurs in the Mahavirachariyam
of Nemichandra, the oldest Svetambara (Jain) work which refers to Kalkiraja:

""

> 'nlere will arise the Saka king 605 years and 5 mgnths after my
Nirv~na.   After the expiry of 1309 years of the Saka era there

will arise at Kusumapura the wicked-souled Kalki in the prant-race."
Bhide, in his study, "Is Kalkiraja An Historical Personage?" (in:
Indian Antiquary: Vol. 48 (July, 1919): pp. 123-130), establishes the fact
that the Jain traditions regarding Kalkiraja are conflicting and therefore
possess no historical importance.   In fact,   ~ccording    to Digambara (Jain)
tradition, Kalki would appear 1000 years after Mahivira, the founder of
the Jain faith, while the Svetambara (rival Jain sect) places Kalki 2000

years after Mahavira.

And there is yet a further Jaina prognostication which gives us the
year 1857 A.D. for the birth of Kalkiraja, which is approximately 2400 years

after Mahavira.

The Trilokya-Prajfiapati (a Digambara work authored around 1200 A.D.)
ultimately tells us that every 1000 years a new Kalki arises and every

500 years a new Upakalki ("Lesser Kalki") arises.          The Jaina records,
exclusive of the general one of 500-year cycles for periodic Kalki advents,
can be summarized as follows:

> (1) According to Titthogoli Kalki was born in      Pa~aliputra
> in 1928 M.E. or in Saka Era 1323.
> (2) According to K~lasaptatika 1912 M.E. is the date of Kalki's
> birth. This source gives three names of Kalki--1. Kalki,
> 2. Rudra and 3. Caturmukha.
> (3) Dtpamalakalpa of Jinasundarasuri gives 1914 M.E. as the
> date of Kalki's birth. It is said in this source that Kalki
> was the son of Yasa and Yasoda.
> (4) Dipamalakalpa of Up~dhyaya ~ama~alyana gives 475 M.E.
> as the date of Vikrama and puts Kalki's birth 124 years after
> Vikrama.
> (5) Tiloyasara says that Saka king flourished in"605 M.E. and
> Kalki was born 394 years after that.
> (6) Dipalikikalpa of Jinasundara gives 2000 M.E. as the date
> of Kalki's death at the age of 86.
> (7) One other source also gives 2000 M.E. as the date of
Kalki's death.

Thus we get the following dates for Kalki.
Birth in 599, 1000, 1912, 1914, 1928 M.E.

Death in 2000 M.E. at the age of 86.

Kalki In Buddhist Traditions
A Buddhist apocalypse, the Mahasanm.ipata Chandra-garbha Sutra, may
contain an oblique reference to Kalki.       This apocalypse is preserved in
the Chinese Tripitaka, but is rendered from a Sanskrit original, of

which only one page survives.

First of all, in a general sense, this Buddhist text refers to five-
hundred-year cycles as being of signal-significance to the history of a

religion.        But in particular, the apocalypse speaks of the invasion
of the Huns (=Hiiqas=yanuas of Puranas = yavanas (of the sutra), corrupt

spelling for yanuas).         But the present writer will need to consult a
working translation (none has, as yet, found print) to determine if the
Kalki of the Puranas -- Yasodharman          figures in the def eat of the white
Huns in the Buddhist narrative.        If so, we should have a direct Buddhist
memory of Kalki.

Appearance Of Kalki Every Five Hundred Years
Why, in both Jaina and Buddhist traditions, and later·in Confucian
thought, are 500-year cycles of such apocalyptic importance, and what
has this to do with Kalki?       Our historical enterprise cannot proceed until.
this chronological knot is untied.

The peoples of the Indian subcontinent were prone to think in
correspondences.      This is a very crucial thing to keep in mind with respect
to Hindu thought.      For example, one can easily see how the notion of
rebirth or reincarnation arose, originally, as a correspondence between

the human soul and the sun.            At one time the doctrine of reincarnation
was unknown in India.         In the Vedas, given their innocent optimism, no such
idea is found.       Furthermore, according to A. B. Keith, the Brahmanas do
not know transmigration, for these texts "have no conception· of pessimism,
and therefore seek no release from the toils of life. 1168

The very number of the major Avataras of       Visn~,    viz. 10, is itself
symbolic, "--the ten being, as elsewhere, the number of development, that
is, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4     = 10.    The upward trend of the figures doubtless accounts

for this symbolism."

. This is a clue      ·· to Kalki' s recurrent returns, and, indeed, ·.a key
factor to the celebrated·Bhagavad Gita verse (IV:8):
Paritrait~ya =adh~am_vinasaya cha dushkritam

Dharmasamsthapanarthaya sambhavami yuge yuge.

The Rhythm Of Avataric Appearances
In the above verse we find the term sambhavami,           which is a first-
person present tense conjugation of the verb sambhava, which means "to
come into being."       The time factor, "yuge yuge," is simply "age after
age."       Thus, if Kalki is really Krsna, the verse would imply that Kalki
reappears, strategically, every several age.

The doctrine of ages in Hinduism is neither uniform nor primitive.

Simply put, the idea took time to develop.          Now the literature of Hinduism
represents an enormous corpus usually grouped into two great categories:
>
Sruti and Smrti.

> >
> Sruti ("Revelation") literature is coextensive with the Vedas,
and the fourfold Vedas are composed of three tiers or strata of tradition:
1) the Samhitas, (2) the Brahmanas, (3) the Aranyakas, and (4) Upanishads.

Throughout this earliest of Hindu scriptures, there appears to be
no unequivocal reference to a cyclic notion of time, at least in a well-

defined sense.

The other comprehensive category of Hindu holy writ is Smrti,
which encompasses a vast mass of scriptures.       Prominent in this division
are the two Hindi epics--the Ramayana and Mahabharata, the eighteen
Mahapuranas (not to mention the all-too-of ten overlooked Upapuranas) and
the Laws of Ma.nu.       In contrast to Sruti, Smrti   literature is rife with
references to cyclical time.        In the Mahabharata we find, for instance, an
interesting picture of time painted in vivid colors:

> svetab k+tayuge varQah pitas tretayuge mama/
> rakto dvaparam asadya k+~~ah kaliyuge tatha//
> trayo bhaga hy adharmasya tasmin kale bhavanty uta/
> antakale ca sa~prapte kalo bhutvatidaru~abl
> trailokyam nasayamy ekab k+tsna~ sthavarajangamam//
> yavad yugan~~ viprar~e sahasrapivartanam/
> tavat svapimi visvatma sarvalokapitamaha~/I
> "My colour is white in the Kfta Yuga, yellow in the Treta
> Yuga: having reached the Dvapara Yuga it is red, and black
> in the Kali Yuga. In that time (i.e. Kali Yuga) there are
> three portions of Adharma: and when the time of the end has
> been reached, I alone having become very terrible Time shall
> destroy the three worlds entirely, both stationary and mobile.
> As long as are 1,000 revolutions of the Yugas, 0 Viprarsi, for
> so long do I sleep, the soul of the universe, the grandsire
> of all the worlds."72

The Hindu blueprint of Yugas at first glance appears to be a stylistic
unity.        But upon closer scrutiny, the doctrine is found to embody several
disparate elements skillfully woven together. These elements, so adroitly.
edited into a single framework, are reducible to four:

> 1.     Time-divisons (from the wink of an eye to vast aeons)
2.    Historically-oriented ages of semi-divine Rulers (viz.

Manvantaras of Manus)
3.    Myth of Brahma's creation, dissolution, and

reemanation of the worlds
4.    Evaluation of the relative Dharma or virtue of each

successive age.
These four principal elements of content (Time-divisions, Manvan-
taras, Brahma-myth, and Dharma) were developed into a single story over

a long period of time, stretching from roughly 1000 B.C. to 400 A.D.
During this time the cyclic scheme of time was harmonized, intentionally,
by an editor, with the reigns of kings.         This led to an artificial construct
which has fooled many, including certain Baha'! apologists, into believing
that the scheme was fixed and reliance could be placed on that theme to
speculate, with accuracy, when the last Avatar was to appear.

However, one must also notice a great advance in the Hindu idea of
time, that of progress.         This appears to first have found force in the
advent of Zoroaster, who taught the Indo-Iranian peoples this then-subtle
differentiation, an abstraction difficult to comprehend for an ancient
mind.      One might say that, in geometric language, Zoroaster shifted time-
consciouslness from circle to spiral.

Huntington, although ignoring Zoroaster, makes the following obser-
va:tion:

> "The prominent tendency in modern Western thought is to regard
> Prometheus as a heroic figure, and to minimize the 'original sin'
> involved in the rebellion of Adam in the primordial Garden. The
> underlying assumption in this interpretation--that human evolu-
> tion is the standard of value--must not be ignored. While the
> puranic writers are cognizant of man's growth in individuality
> and do not belittle it, they steadfastly refuse to set it
> up as the exclusive measure of good •••
> "Progress may be given a limited meaning from the foregoing
> considerations •••• But what about the assertion that Kalki comes
> to reinstitute Krta yuga? Does this not weigh the balance against
> the idea of progress in the manifested universe by implying a
> ceaseless repetitive cycle? The answer is not inevitably in the
affirmative •••• The possibility of interpreting 5he cycle three

dimensionally as a spiral is never ruled out."
But the notion of successive, and to some extent, progressive Ages
and Revelations in later Hindu thought proved to be unific in function.
Again, as Soifer points out:

> "The formulation of the doctrine of avataras or descents of
> Visnu in Hindu mythology and its popularization through icono-
> graphy, pilgrimage sites, and festivals is p-robably the most
> powerful Indian theological concept since the Upanisadic ab-
> solute of Brahman and, eminently, the most successful. 11 76

The Unifying Influence Of The Avatar-Yuga   Blueprin~t

What is suggested earlier in this paper is worth repeating here.

The Avatar concept, although somewhat artificial with the later wooden
wheels of age-associations, had a very positive influence on Indian culture.
As Dandekar observes:

> "From the point of view of history of Hinduism the avatara
> theory may be regarded as a major factor in the religious
> synthesis brought about by that religion. Originally, the
> different divinities like Rama, Rrsna, Parasurama, etc., seem
> to have been the gods of different religious cults. When, in
> the course of the religious history of India, these cults
> federated themselves to form what came to be known as Hinduism,
> some kind of unity of godhead was sought to be achieved by those
> gods being represented as the incarnations of one single god
> Visnu •••• It may further be noted that the avat~ra-theory gen-
> erally tended to supersede the philosophical pantheism and to
> promote some kind of theology approaching monotheism •••• Among
> other concepts, which are in some way related to the concept
> of avatara but which must needs be essentially differentiated
> from it, may be mentioned ••• pradurbhava wherein God mani7ests
> Himself while remaining transcendent in His true f~rm." 7

It is remarkable that the doctrine of a Supreme Being appearing in Manifesta-
tion (pradurbhava) to mankind in successive, progressive ages should have
had so unific an influence in Hindu history.   The theory has phenomenological
correspondences in the theologies of Mani and Baha'u'llah.      The meta-historical
view of "progressive revelation" is not without enormous appeal, just as
the theory of evolution to the scientific mind.

PART FOUR:
WAS KALKI VISNUYASAS BAHA'U'LLAH?
BAHA'I SCHOLARSHIP AND HINDU APOCALYPSE
The fact that Baha'is in India are proclaiming that   Bah~'u'll~h
(Prophet-Founder of the Baha'i Faith) is Kalki Visnuyasas has recently
attracted the attention of one particular historian of religion: Dr.
Daniel Bassuk, of the University of South Florida.    At the joint session
of the American Academy Of Religion andthe Society of Biblical Literature
in the Fall of 1978, Dr. Bassuk presented a paper, entitled,    "Kalk~:
Apocalyptic Avatar Appears Among Baha'i Faith And Again In New Orleans."
This study is given summary in:     Abstracts: The American Academy Of
Religion Annual Meeting: New Orleans, Louisiana 18-21 November, 1978:
compiled-by John F. Pr.iest (Missoula, Montana: Scholars Press, 1978):
p. 141.

Dr. Bassuk's presentation represents two chapters from his work-in-
progress, The Divine Descent which focuses on those Masters, both East
and West, who claim to be the Kalki Avatar.     Also included are those
savants who were silent on this identity, but whose votaries would later
assert of their respective masters the station of Kalki.·

Jamshed K. Fozdar's Buddha Maitrya-Amitabha Has Appeared (New Delhi,
India; Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1976) links Baha'u'llah to the Buddhist
future Messiah, through prophecy.     Fozdar's effort was reviewed by
Jane Nishi Goldstone before the Third Annual Conference of Scholars
representing The Canadian Association For Studies On The Baha'i Faith.
Her review, presented on December 30, 1977, performed the uncomfortable

task of subjecting to scientific critique the labor of love undertaken
by a fellow Baha'! scholar.      Fozdar was treated with great respect,
and questioned with humility.      Nevertheless, Jane Nishi Goldstone was
forced to cast serious doubt over Fozdar's grasp of Buddhist apocalyptic
literature as well as the method by which prophetic proof-texts are
marshalled forth to persuade Buddhists especially of the truth of
Baha'u'llah.

Goldstone chose not to venture specific criticism of Chapter Nine
in Fozdar's book, for she did not feel prepared to wrestle with Hindu and
Buddhist chronologies of future events.      The purpose of this section
is to complement Goldstone's just review by offering observations by a
non-Baha'! specialist as well as those of my own.      It is strongly hoped
that these remarks might contribute to the advancement of the Baha'!
academic community.

Jamshed Fozdar's presentation of Baha'u'llah's fulfillment of
Hindu prophecy is drawn from the work of a Baha'!      scholar in India,
Prakash Narayan   M~shra,   whose book, entitled Kalki Avatar Ki Khoj ("The
Quest For The Kalki Avatar") was published in Hindi back in 1972
(Buddha-Maitrya: p. 273 n. 1).      So since Fozdar depends on   ~shra
almost entirely, let us turn our gaze to the work of this very dedicated
gentleman who emerges as one of the most outstanding professors of the
Baha'! Faith in India.

The.present author had the good forttme of correspondence with
Prakash Narayan Mishra, thanks to Jamshed Fozdar's furnishing of the address.
In a letter dated Ri4van, 1975, Prakash Narayan Mishra, after extending to
me permission to draw from his work, states:      "Mr. Jamshed Fozdar was here
in Kota and he is writing a book on the same subject.     He had also come

for permission to use the above matter."      Mishra had prepared an English
abstract of his research, bearing "Prophecies In Hindu Scriptures" as
title, which he gave to Mr. Fozdar, who kindly circulated it to me.         It is
from Mishra's English version that Fozdar evidently draws.

The most important proof-texts which to both Mishra and Fozdar
represent the surest evidence found in Hindu scriptures that Baha'u'llah
is the Hindu future Messiah, Kalki     Vis~uyasas   or the Tenth Avatar, were
drawn from the principal Hindu Apocalypse -- the Kalki Purana.         The Kalki
Purana is one of the minor works of Epic Indian literature.         An English
summary of the Kalki Upapurana is given by R. C.      Haz~a   in Studies In The
Upapuranas (Calcutta, 1958): Vol. I, pp. 303-308.

The latest critical edition of the Kalki (Upa-)Purana appeared as
Vol. 103 of the Sarasvati Bhavana Granthamala Series, published in 1972
by the Varanaseya Sanskrit Vishvavidyalaya in India.          To the critical
editor himself    ~   submitted the five most crucial proof-texts adduced by
Mishra and (later) Fozdar.       Since Mishra's transliteration was uncon-
ventional and his translations sometimes imprecise, Dr. Asoke Chatterjee
Sastri of the Department of Sanskrit at Calcutta University kindly provided
proper transliterations and exact translations of the five proof-texts
under question.       (Now the Kalki Purana has not been translated into English
save for passages in Wendy Doniger 0' Flaherty' s The Origins Of Evil In
Hindu Mythology (University of California, 1976).        Here below is
presented Dr. Sastri's letter, after which follows a discussion.          #1 corres-

My dear Buck,                               1.1.1976

I received your reply in time. I put below my humble
observations in connection with your different queries.
1\. Location~page 8 (of my edition), chapter 2, verse 8.
Proper transliteration:_

> Sumaty~ Vi~QUyasasa garbham adhatta vai~QaVam/
> graha nak~atra rasyadi sevita sri padambujam//
English rendering:

> By Vilj.1}uya5as, SumatI bore the womb devoted to Vi!jl}U and
> served by the planets, stars, zodiacal signs and lotus
> like feet of the goddess Lak~rriI..

Comments:
If the additional reading noted in the footnotes of my edition
is taken into consideration, then the adjectives "devoted to
Visnu" etc. are related to the new baby born from the womb of
Sumati and not related to the embryo in the womb. I think "the
lotus like feet is served by the planets, stars, zodiacal signs
as well as by the goddess LaksmI" should be the correct trans-
lation. But this does not follow the text, strictly speaking.

Discussion:

l.   Fozdar (p. 276) does not refer to the event of S!yah-Chal
which Mishra believes took place on either the 30th or 31st of August,

1852, to which this prophecy refers, he feels.           Mishra assigns numerical
values to the Sanskrit words and applies them to a future time scheme.
Such cabbalistic     acrobatics were probably not intended by this verse,
nor does the context warrant a speculation on the time of the advent
of Kalki Visnuyasas or Baha'u'llah.

2.   Fozdar (p. 274) reproduces Mishra's computations but not his
conviction that this verse    refe~s    to the 1863 declaration of Baha'u'llah.

3.   Fozdar (p. 271) on the authority of Mishra applies this verse
to Baha'u'llah's birth.     The trouble is, both Baha'! scholars accept
without question the traditional date for       K!~~a,    a date which is, on
the strength of archaeological evidence for the Mahabharata war, over
1,500 years too early.

4.   Fozdar (p. 273) fails to explain the quantum leap from "100,000

years" to "100,000 solar days."        Mishra states:     "Suraya Abda   means human
days of 24 hours."    However, the verse here does not contain "Suraya Abda"
or "solar days" in its text!

5.   Fozdar (p. 227) trusts Mishra implicitly, who reverses the
traditional   ~    or epochal blueprint of time most often found in Hindu
scriptures.   Kali Yuga is made to last 4,800 years in duration rather
than the customary 1,200 years.        If Mishra only knew that the original
yuga system quite likely had equal ages of 1,000 years in length, such
could have accorded with Baha'u'llah's own pronouncement on the approxi-
mate frequency of the appearance of Prophets or Manifestations of God.

> Mishra's response to Sastri is as follows:
> In Sanskrit Arithmetic there is a rule for writing figures
> or numbers in verses: (a) Whenever a number is written like
> 1975, the figures are written like 1975 in the same order;
> (b) Whenever independent figures are given for valuation,
> the order of the figures is changed, as 5791. Similarly, the

figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 are written as 4, 3, 2, and 1 in
> Shloka (verse) for clear differentiation of figures from
> number. .This rule is known to Sanskrit scholars very well.

(From a communication dated January 22, 1976.)
The best I can say on this debate is that, judging from Prof. Asoke
Chatterjee Sastri's interest in and request for advanced treatises on
mathematics (elsewhere in the letter), it is more probable that Sastri's
ground is every bit as firm as Prakash Narayan Mishra's, if not more,
severe as such judgement is.

In fact, I decided to suppress this information for over four
years, since I did not wish to neutralize Mishra's tremendous efforts
as well as those of Fozdar, whose treatment of Buddhist apocalypse
is also selective and unscientific.

THE PROBLEM OF VATICINIA EX EVENTU:

IS HINDU PROPHECY PROPHETIC?

Does Hindu prophecy presage future events?      From the foregoing
pages, evidence shows that Hindu apocalypses are modelled on past events.
For this reason, the prospecting historian can mine apocalypses for
historical ore.     If the past does yield clues to the future, then in
this sense Hindu prophecy does have a forward orientation.

This idea of prophecy as document of historical pattern is really
the only way in which an apocalypse such as the Kalki Upapurana can be
vaticination.     P.' V. Sharma, in his article, "Kalki Purana," states
that this well-known work is not mentioned in any of the early, standard
lists of Upapuranas ~ nor is any verse of it found quoted in Dharma-

Sastra-Nibandhas.     This tells us that the text is relatively late in
origin.   Nevertheless, the Kalki ranks as the most important of all other
'Upapuranas.

The work, which consists of 1,318 verses, was most likely composed
between 1200-1800 A.D. in Uttar Pradesh.     This Vaisnava scripture,
Sharma holds, appears to be an extension or natural development of the
earlier story of Kalki narrated briefly in a number of other Puranas.

In our opinion, an account so late in its final redaction, with
such obvious development and so evidently modelled on past     ~ere-kings,

could hardly be considered a divine revelation of the future.

If this is so, a death-blow is dealt to the whole modality of Mishra's
and Fozdar's approach.     This negative conclusion cannot be avoided.     In
studying Hindu doctrines of ages, we will show below that the various systems
of time in Hindu tradition cannot be harmonized.      Thus it is simply impossible
to yield a firm time for Kalki's advent.

/, c;:
THE PUZZLE OF RIVAL CHRONOLOGIES OF GOD:

WHICH IS.THE TRUE YUGA?

But suppose the Kalki Purana were true in its mantic vision, its
prophetic spectacle of future events?         Is the problem of time any
easier to solve     when there are several yuga-systems from which to
choose?     Although the four-fold age scheme is ancient, that scheme has
complex·variations.      And it all was based on a gamble, on the throw of
dice.

It is well-known that in the Vedas different rolls of dice,
probably counted 1, 2,     ~'   and 4, were called      Kali~·.   Dvapara, Treta and
Krita.     In later tradition, the waning strength and stability of dharma
is represented as a majestic bull who stood firm on all four legs
during the Golden Age of the world (Krta Yuga), but who loses one of
each of his legs in succeeding ages (Treta and Dvapara)                 to totter on
a single limb during the Dark Age (Kali Yuga).              The bull does not throw
dice, but the ratio stays the same.

So far the progression is consistent.          But names start to vary
slightly.     The later yet still ancient
Sadvim~a Br~hmana         (V:8) classes
yugas as:     Pusya, Dvapara,    Kh~a,   Krita..       In some of the medieval
Puranas Kali is in some places Tisya.         And, of course, Satya Yuga is
a well-known synonym for Krita Yuga."

Now for age valuations.     The most autho'ritative enumeration is set
forth in Manu Smriti (I:68ff.) in the following table of years:

> Krita    4800
> Treta    3600
> Dvapara 2400

Kali     1200

The Mahabharata (Vana Parva 188:V:l2-18) repeats the figures from
Manu's code of laws.   Yet so.solid and creditworthy a witness as
Alberuni (I,p.373) relates a divergent, perhaps earlier tradition:
"Brahmagupta says that Aryabhata considers the four yugas as the four
equal parts of a chatur yuga."

The swollen period of 4,320,000 which constitutes a Mahayuga, that
is, a set of Four Ages, would seem utterly fantastic.       Yet this and
other bewilderingly long durations make sense when traced to the newly
acquired knowledge of the precession of equinoxes which entered India
from cultural exchange with Mesopotamia.       Berossus, a celebrated
Babylonian priest of antiquity, gives us a king-list of antedeluvian
reigns which span 120 sars (120 x 3600 years) which yields 432,000 years!
As Langdon observes:

> This long mythical period was received and revised by Indian
> and Chinese mythologists. The Chinese period or age of the
> thirteen kings of Heaven and eleven kings of earth, was also
> 432,000 years, and so was the Indian Kali-yuga ••• The Hindu
> tradition is apparently developed from the Sumerian-Indian-
> Chinese system by fanciful theological thinkers. 11 79

Further evidence of cultural        exchange between Mesopotamia and
India has sparked charged discussions.       R. C. Hazra, in "Did Vyasa
Owe His Origin To Berossus?," concedes:        "We do not deny the possi-
bility of the spread of the name and fame of Berossus into Gujurat
through merchants who carried on maritime commerce between Babylon and
the mouth of the Indus. 1180

In conclusion, as far as Balla 'l. scholars endeavoring to "prove"

that Baha'u'llah is Kalki Visnuyasas on the basis of chronological
prophecies, the process is doomed to confusion, if one wishes to re-
present Hindu tradition with intellectual honesty.        The Hindu tradition
is simply not unified on the question of ages and cycles.        To select one

system from among several is simply artificial.    Moreover, evidence
exists to suggest that Hindu time-speculation is multiply· derivative in
nature.   And, lastly, there is the problem that this sort of prophecy is
simply not important in tradition nor is it popular.    On this issue,
Sir Charles Eliot points out:
"It is remarkable that Indian thought, restless and speculative

> as it is, hardly ever concerns itself with the design, object,
> or end of the world ••• Legends about the end of the world and
> the establishment of a better order are rare. Hindu chronology
> revels in periods, whose enormous length, though expressed in
> figures, °leave no real impression on the mind, days and nights
> of Brahma, Kalpas, Manvantaras and Yugas, in which gods and
> worlds are absorbed into the supreme essence and born again.
> But there is no finality about these catastrophes: the destruc-
> tion of the universe is as certain as the death of a mouse and
> to the philosopher not more important ••• The Buddhists look for-
> ward to the advent of Maitreya, the future Buddha, and the
> Hindus to the reappearance of Visnu as Kalki, who, sword in hand
> and mounted on a white horse, will purge India of barbarians,
> but these future apparitions excite only a feeble interest in the
> popular conscience and cannot be compared in intensity with such
> ideas as the Jewish Messiah. 11 81

Furthermore, Eliot observes:    "Any attempt to describe Hinduism
as a whole leads to startling contrasts.   The same religion enjoins
self-mortification and orgies: commands human sacrifices and yet counts
it a sin to eat meat or crush an insect. 1182

Baha'i Scholarship And Buddhist Apocalypse
Related to our enquiry is the parallel effort to establish
Baha'u'llah as Maitreya, the future Buddha.     Here we shall only touch
on the major attempt to date by a Bah&'l apologist, viz. Jamshed K.
Fozdar, whose Buddha Maitrya-Amitabha Has Appeared (1976) enjoys a wide
circulation among Baha'ls of both India and America.

In chapter nine, "The Time," Fozdar focuses chiefly on the most
famous Buddhist apocalypse, the An~gata Vainsa, an English translation

of which appears in Warren's Buddhism In Translations 83--a source which
Fozdar fails to acknowledge.

The Anagata-Vaiiisa forecasts a series of five disappearances: of
Attainments, of Method, of Learning, of Symbols, of Relics.      These
successive deteriorations of the Buddha's religion span a time of one
thousand years each.   Thereupon, the Anagata-Va~sa concludes:

> "Thereupon, the Dispensation of the Supreme Buddha being
> now five thousand years old, •••• Metteyya (Maitreya) will
> be born."

Were this Buddhist apocalypse to be true in its projected time frame, it
could hardly be marshalled forth as a proof that the nineteenth century
was to have been the period for Maitreya's, and thus for   Bah~'u'll~h's
appearance.   But Fozdar argues:

> "And yet surely it is not 5000 years? No, it is just exactly
> half that time. And this too Siddharta foresaw only too well--
> the halving of the time of the Dharm.a's duration •••• His Dharma,
> which was to have 'endured a thousand years,' will now, because
> of His permission for women to enter the samgha, 'endure for only
> five hundred years'--just half the time. Half also of 5000--
> 2500 years. tr1d that time has come and passed .•• Hence, where
> is Maitrya? 118

The passage in question is from Cullavagga 10:1 of Vinaya-Pitaka
(Vol. II, pp. 253ff of Oldenberg's edition).   In the fifth year after
the Enlightenment, Buddha's father Suddhodana died and   c~nsequently      the
Buddha went to Kapilavattnu to pay his respects.   There his aunt, Maha-
Prajapatf, beseeched the Buddha, saying:

> "It would be well, Lord, if women ghould be allowed to renounce
> their homes and enter the homeless state under the doctrine and
> discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata."

The Buddha refused, but Ananda interceded on her behalf, whereupon the
Buddha assented and granted the supplications of Maha-Prajapati'.        The
Buddha, however, warned:

"If women had not received the going forth in the
> doctrine and discipline, the religious system would
> have lasted long, the good doctrine would have endured
> for a thousand years; but as women have gone forth,
> now theteligious system will not last long; now, Ananda,
> the good doctrine will last only 500 years."

Now, this prediction has historical significance, being an important
point of reference for both Theravadin and Sarvastivadin Buddhists of Ceylon
and Northern India, respectively.      Eggermont traces the origin of the
Saka-Era (78 A.D.) to a fresh epoch started by Sarvastivadin-Buddhism when
it determined that the first five centuries of the turning of the Wheel of
Law were over and a new cycle was to come.

86      In fact, the prophecy did
not come true, for Sarvastivadin Buddhism.         As Eggermont observes:

"However, in the year A.D. 78 Kaniska grasped power, a king
> who acquired for Sarvastivadin Buddhism an importance which
> equalled that of king Asoka for the ancient form of Buddhism.
> The prospects of the propagation of Buddhism seemed better than
> ever and instead of the predicted downfall of the Law there
> seemed to arrive for Buddhism an epoch of the highest prosperity.
> Apparently the tradition about the downfall of religion was not
> coming true."87

This raises the question as to whether or not the Buddha uttered such a
prophecy at all -- one which is so patently anti-feminine, a prejudice
which creates a dissonance within the Buddha's all-embracing         compassion.
Moreover, it seems quite unlikely that so enlightened a being would voice
a prophecy doomed to become an error.

Quite honestly, if we are to talk about any prophecies of the Buddha
at all, we must again be selective after we ask, which one?         For, as
Lamotte has shown, Buddhist apocalypses range from 500 years to 12,000
years in predicting the disappearance of Dharma. 88

It can still be argued that the Buddha was a Prophet, in a sense
not too removed from the truer conception of a Prophet more as forth-
~eller    rather than foreteller.   A very old Buddhist.text, the Pasadika-
Suttanta ("The Delectable Discourse") of Di'gha Nikaya 3:13J represents
the Buddha as declaring:

"And so, 0 Cunda, concerning things past, future and
> present the Tathagata is a Prophet of the hour, a Prophet
> of fact, a Prophet of good, a Prophet of the No~, a Prophet
> of the Discipline. For this is the Tathagata. 11

The purpose here is not to disparage Fozdar, but to improve on the view
of prophecy which is so very common and which he, naturally, would reflect.
Since various kings such as Yasodharman, vanquisher of Huns, and Kaniska,
champion of   Sarv~stivadin   Buddhism, inaugurated new eras or Golden
Ages in Indian history, it appears that prophecies which envision such
times of zenith in religion outline and describe those conditions which
would favor such good fortune.      Thus, prophecy is far more predicative
than predictive.    Buddhist ages, as well as Hindu, must be thought of
more as symbolic chronologies rather than as inverse histories.- We
see this in China, where Mencius says:

> "A sage is the teacher of a hundred generations • • •
> It is a rule that a true imperial sovereign should
> arise the course of (every) five hundred years, and
that during that time there should be men illustrious."

(Mencius 7b:l5; 2b:l3)
And Taoist apoca;ypse, which participates in this general Oriental
orientation, also appears to be more conditional than predestinational
in its perspective:

> The Tao says: Listen to me attentively, I will speak to you
> now about the era to come and the period of the end.
> Lao-Tzu transforms himself following the (junctures of) time;
> All (his) manifestations correspond to the Great Circuits time.
> I have manifested myself many times in order to save (mankind).
> (Following) the junctures of time I have transformed myself.
> Few are those who understand me.
> Numerous those who disapprove.
> The manifestation of the Perfect Lord will not be noticed among
> men. At the time that I shall manifest myself, (I shall do so)
> in order to effect the transformation of Heaven and Earth. The
> old doctrines of all books and codes will have to perish. A
> reformed orthodoxy will again be manifest. The empire will be
> abolished, but Heaven and Earth will be reestablished; then

the Perfect Lord will manifest himself. When he has come, all
> saints, sages, and immortals, as well as those who have re-
> ceived this sutra, will come to be his assistants to the right
> and to the left •••• You men of this age need only receive this
> sutra to be sure of getting to see the Perfect Lord.
> I shall come forth riding in a chariot drawn by nine dragons.
> The dragons will be streaked in nine colours with scales like
> lined-up cash pieces; the chariot, under a nine-fold feather
> canopy will be of sandalwood, inlaid with gold, silver, pearls
> and jade, in varigated colours; impossible to perceive and
> describe it all! I shall summon all the perfect officials of
> the empire, all the wind gods, rainmasters and all the ten
> thousand subordinate demons of the sea and the mountain peaks •••• 91

It is useful to make a comparative study of Oriental apocalypses,
but all seem to reflect characteristic traits, and, moreover, some
draw from each other during the course of development.   For instance,
in the Anagata-Vamsa,_ which is so crucial a proof-text in Fozdar's

argument, Visnu is referred to as one of ten Bodhisattvas!

A Bah&'! Perspective On Hindu And Buddhist

Traditions, And Thus Of Apocalypses
From Baha'u'llab, in Ai-Kitab Al-Aqdas (=The Most Holy Book), the

I

following pronouncement on Hindu orthopraxis   is made:

> "Of them there is he who claims the Hidden and the Hidden
> of the Hidden.

> "Say, 0 liar, by God, what thou hast is husks. We have left
> it for you as bones are left for the dogs. By God, the Truth,
> if one were to wash the feet of everybody in i:the world and
> worship God in thickets and in green valleys, on mountains,
> hill-tops, and summits, and at every stone, and tree, and clod,
> and yet the fragrance of My good pleasure be not diffused from
him, he would never be accepted.

"This is what the Master of Mankind has ruled.

> "How many a creature in the isles of India has withdrawn from the
> world and deprived himself of what God has made lawful for him
> and endured retreats and hardships;.yet these things will not be
remembered by God who sends down the verses.

> "Do not make deeds a snare of hopes. Do not deprive yourselves
> of this end which was the hope of those who drew nigh (to God)
> in the eternity of past eternities. 11 93

Baha'u'llah here associates esoteric and ascetic pretensions with false
notions of holiness, and singles out India as the paradigm of this
startling spiritual paradox.

Baha'u'llah's eldest son, 'Abdu'l-Baha, enlarges upon Baha'u'llah's
critique of Indian religion:

> "Brahma, Krishna and Buddha never advocated polytheism. They
> were eminent teachers of monotheism as were all other Prophets
> of God; but succeeding generations misconstrued their words
> and in order to further their own selfish interests fabricated
> these false doctrines. 11 94

These two and other Baha'! sources speak of corruption in Hindu and
Buddhist traditions.   This being so, from a Baha'f viewpoint, apocalypses
would doubtless be included.   In fact, there is a statement in Baha'f
Scriptures where 'Abdu'l-Baha refers to Buddhist apocalypses very cautiously,
and warns those who approach them to do so carefully--to guard against
literalistic interpretation and to appreciate how highly symbolic

Buddhist prophecies are. This is what Fozdar should have taken more to
heart.     A serious enquiry into Hindu and Buddhist origins will prove
more fruitful to Baha'i scholars than to continue to prove Baha'u'llah
on the strength of weak traditions--a practice which Orientalist
Edward Granville Browne observed with chaste distaste. 95

Is Kalki Visnuyasas Baha'u'llah:     Conclusions
In an ideal sense, yes.    In a strict sense, no.   The only place
in Baha'i sources (available to the present writer) where a central figure
of the Faith approved of the identification of Kalki with Baha'u'llah is
found in Star Of The West: Vol. 6, No. 15 (December 12, 1915): p. 114 (note)
and p. 117, where 'Abdu'l-Baha reviewed a manuscript, "The Call Of God"
by George O.     Latimer, and consented to publication the declaration:

> " ••• and the Hindus await the appearance of the tenth incarnation
> of Truth, called Kalki. •• "
(followed later in the essay by statements such as:)

> "The Baha'1. Revelation brings the fulfillment of all these
> hopes •••• Baha'o'llah ••• fulfilled the spiritual prophecies of
> all the former religions."

Once an apocalypse from an ancient tradition is taken for what it is--a
document of pain and hope for an oppressed people and a vanquished
religion--one will not find an infallible revelation telescoping through
centuries like some kind of divine time machine.        But another kind of truth
will be unveiled to the reader's inner eye, of struggle, of suffering,
of a will and determination to overcome dark forces and to bring about a
world of peace and justice--words        which centuries ago were not empty
diplomatic cliches.      Instead of a crystal ball, we will find a blueprint

for a new world order.   Instead of futuristic binoculars scouring the
horizon of time, we will peer through a microscope detailing social
illnesses of the prevailing age.   In sum,   Bah~'u'll~   is Kalki Visnuyasas,
if and only if Baha'u'llah and the army of followers can wage love more
effectively than war, can restore justice and the true spirit of religion
with the sword of truth upon the steed of power, and plant the throne of
spiritual sovereignty atop the white-maned waters of chaos.

Additional Note:   How Do Baha'1 Sources Look Upon
Prophecy?   An Instance Of Apparent Contradiction.
It is the present writer's conviction that Baha'! sources support
the dictum advanced and defended in this paper, viz, prophecy is far more
predicative than predictive, and that most, if not all apocalypses, are
modelled on past events.

> Baha'u'llah shares this very same perspective:
> "You have asked regarding· the heavenly Books:
> ••• Say, 0 thou possessor of sight!   The past is the
> mirror of the future; look and perceive."

(Star Of The West: Vol. 1, No. 1 (March 21, 1910): p. 8.)
The idea of prophecy as document of historical patterns is reinforced
by an apparent, though not real, contradiction found in Baha'f Writings.
Baha'u'llah is presented as the one the Qur'an foretells in the verse:
" ••• therefore with a third (Messenger) We strengthened them" (Ya Sin:
verse 13).   This link is forged in God Passes By, p. 96.     (The sura of
Ya Sin is said to have been termed by Muhammad "the heart of the Qur'an.")
The following text in Arabic corroborates this identification, with the
first two Messengers being explained as the Bab and Quddus.

Yet 'Abdu'l-Baha, Baha'u'llah's eldest son and successor by testament,
reproduces the traditional Islamic exegesis of the verse as referring
to the presence of Peter in Antioch:

> "In order to spread and teach the Cause of God two of the
> Apostles went to the city of Antioch. No sooner had they
> arrived than they started to exhort and give counsel to the
> peop·le. As the inhabitants of the city were totally unin-
> formed of the divine principles, they started to censure and
> arraign them, which finally ended in their persecution and
> torture and imprisonment •••
> "But when Peter heard about it he started for that country
> without delay ••• For this reason it is revealed in the blessed
> verse: 'We have glorified them by the appearance of a third
> person.'"

(Star Of The West: Vol. 13, No. 7 (Oct., 1922): pp. 180-1)
That a Qur'anic figure could have dual or even multiple identities is
confirmed by the verse:
"He who warneth you is one of the Warners of old."

(The Star: v. 57).

Prophecies are often appealed to in Baha'i Writings as specific fulfill-
ments.     Yet, as the above example shows, there is a deeper-level
appreciation of what prophecy is and is not:      The symbolic is far more
revealing than the literal, and the conditional has deeper insight than
the predictive.     Prophecy is more profound when seen as a document of
why and how world change occurs, rather than of when and of what place.

Once again, 'Abdu'l-Baha stresses that Buddhist prophecies are
written in symbols, and are not to be taken literally (Baba'! Scriptures:
·section *856; also, Japan Will Turn Ablaze: p. 20).     The text is as
follows:

Baha'u'llSh's Tablet Of The Manifestation
In accord with the original doctrine of Pridurbhava in Hindu
tradition, Baha'u'llah's Revelation revoices the ancient truth but on a
remarkably higher octave.    The power, majesty and authority of Baha'u'llah
is a striking feature of both style and content.     Not on prophecy but
on Baha'u'llah's Revelation itself is the basis on which one should rest
judgement as to whether or not the Baba' 1. Faith represents the .evolution
or fulfillment of all that the    genius of Hindu tradition stands for.
Some one hundred volumes of Baha'u'llah's works survive.     What follows
below is but a taste before a feast:

Tablet of the Manifestation

by Baha'u'llah
> 373. In the name of God!     The Most Holy, the All-Knowing!
> The Mighty!
> 374. 0 thou who art gazing toward the direction of God and
> submerged in His Nearness and Good-pleasure!
> 375. Know thou that, verily, the "Manifestation" is not com-
> posed of the four elements (earth, fire, air and water), nay, rather,
> He is the Mystery of Oneness, of the Ancient Identity, the Eternal
> Essence and the Unknowable Reality, and that, verily, He can
> never be known by any other save Himself. Therefore, one can
> never realize that He hath appeared from any of the four elements,
> or from any of the substances mentioned by the tongues of philos-
> ophers, or from any of the four expressons of nature, such as
> heat, cold, dry and wet, inasmuch as all these are created by His
> command and will, which has ever been and shall ev~r be sepa-
> rate and apart from all else; even as He is now, in truth, on the
> throne of excellence and in revealed verses unto thee, which are
> creative in kindling the fire of Love within thy heart.
> 376. Is there anything endowed with utterance in the world that
> may be able to speak with Him? Or any revealer to arise with
> Him in His Cause? Or any existing to claim the existence for
> himself? No, by thy Lord, the element! All are evanescent and
> as nothingness! Were one to be known by any beside Him, it
> would never be proven to have its essence sanctified from any
> similitude, its identity purified from likeness and its singleness
> from any created appearance.
> 377. He is a sea upon which no one can sail, inasmuch as
> ail that thou mayest see in heaven and earth is created by His
> Word.

378. By Myself, the True One! Were His servants to know
> Him as He is to be known, they would all sever themselves from
> everything, and would make themselves subject to Him, their
> King, and the sultans would abandon their crowns and hasten to-
> ward His direction in the path of His good-pleasure; but since He
> has hidden from them, they have fixed their gaze upon others be-
· side, and are flying with the wings of eagles, in the sky of their

superstitions and imaginations.

379\. Testify thou with thine essence, then with thyself, and then
with thy tongue, that, verily, there is no God but He! No other
save Himself can know Him, and no one can ever approach Him!
Verily, He is not a Manifestation in Himself, but rather He is a
Manifestation in His Identity, and this is what We have mentioned
to thee in the Divine Mystery, and in the Eternal Essence.
380\. As to the bodies, verily, they are as thrones for His Mani-
festation, of which no one is informed save Himself. These bodies,
although they have appeared in the world of creation, in the tem-
ple in which ye have been informed of them (Moses, Jesus, etc.),
yet were ye to gaze upon them with the eye of reality and innate
consciousness, ye would testify that although they are created
from the elements, yet they are sanctified from them to such an
extent that there is no similitude between them.
381\. Consider the diamond--can the stone be compared to it?
Thus hath appeared in El-Beyan, from the presence of thy Lord,
the mighty, the powerful, the potentate! Were they not to be their
temples, the bodies of His servants would not have been created.
Wert thou minutely to consider, thou wouldst find that, verily, all
in heaven and earth are created from their outward temples, and
that all of the worlds of thy Lord seek help from the appearance
of the Manifestation of God, the protector, the self-subsistent!
382\. In every world, He appears according to the capacity of
that world. For example, in the world of spirits He manifests
Himself to them and appears unto them with the signs of Spirit.
So, likewise, in bodies, in the world of names and attributes; and
in the worlds which are not known to any save God. All of these
worlds have their position from this Manifestation. He appears
unto them in His form, so that He, their Lord, may direct them,
and draw them nearer to the seat of His Command, and cause
them to attain to that which was ordained for them~ As His
Reality is not known, so likewise all that is related to Him is not
known, except to a certain degree.

> 383. Think over thine own identity. Would it not consist in
> the expression and order of the five senses? Otherwise the limbs
> would become inactive; the eye would never see, the ear would
.never hear, the tongue would never speak, the hand would never

> grasp and the form would never move,--although He sways and
> rules over all, for God has made the use of all dependent upon
> Him. Yet He sees through the eye, hears through the ear, and
> speaks by the tongue. Wert thou to reflect upon this, thou
> wouldst find even this to be His Guidance in.such.manner that
> His dignity is not defective through these attachments and instru-
> ments.

384. Consider a goldsmith: verily, he makes a ring, and al-
though he is its maker, yet he adorns his finger with it. Likewise
God the Exalted, appears in the clothing of the creatures. This is
through His favor, so that His servants may not flee from Him,
but that they may approach Him and rest in His Presence, hear
His wonderful melodies and be benefited by that which proceeds
from His mouth, and by that which He reveals unto them from
the heaven of His Will. There is wisdom in this. Wert thou to
reflect upon it with the duration of God, thou wouldst discover
at every moment that which thou hadst not found before.
385\. Verily, were God the exalted to appear in His (proper)
grade and form, and in a manner befitting His Station, no one
could ever app~oach Him or endure to be near Him.
386\. For example, consider the throne, the seat and the chair.
All of these are made by certain of His creatures, through the con-
firmation which descends upon them from the heavens of His
grace and the clouds of His bounty. He establishes Himself upon
them. Before He is seated no one knows them, or considers them
important, for they find them simply articles made by their own
hands; but when He is established upon them every relation is
cut from them and they become the Throne of the Merciful God,
and the realities of all things that are created in heaven revolve
around them. Then only the most discerning, the most perceiving
of the perceiving, can realize their value.
387\. Every one who is endowed with a clear insight will behold
that They (the Manifestations) were created before the creation of
heaven and earth, and that this has ever been the Throne of the
Merciful, and will forever be as it was; that there is no relation,
connection, similarity or reference between that Throne and all
else save it, and that all things testify with their inmost tongue:
"Verily, these (bodies) are the Thrones of the Merciful One."
They have no like in creation nor any equal in the world of emana-
tion. From their elements all have appeared in such wise that
thou wilt find that, verily, from their Fire the fire hath appeared
in the unvierse and hath spoken in the Blessed Branch of Unity,
in the lofty Sinai of Moses the Interlocutor, and that from their
Waters thou findest every soul living and immortal. So, likewise,
after this manner, consider its other elements; but with manifest
certainty. This was the mention of the place whereon He was
established. How much above this, then will be the station of His
Chair, and that upon which He stands? (The prophets.) All
that which We have revealed and mentioned unto thee in this
Tablet is according to the language of the people of creation;
otherwise, by the One in the grasp of whose power are all things,
verily, We have utterances concerning this station such as are not
befitting to mention in these days, during which the people have
differed, and have cast the Lord of Lords behind them, and have
made an idol by the hands of lust, and have circled around it and
become of those who are attached to it.
388\. Blessed art thou for that which God hath desired for thee,
because thou hast walked in the path of His good-pleasure until
thou hast presented thyself before His Face, the shining, the
radiant!

389. His Manifestation for His creatures has ever been through
His creatures, just as He manifested Himself unto thee in truth,
and delivered thee from the depths of the suggestions of those who
have denied God and have striven with Himself, and at every mo-
ment have taken for themselves other gods than God, and are of
the poeple of oppression and error in the Manifest Book of Might.
Wert thou to be submerged in the sea of power and might thou
wouldst surely know, verily, God, who is wonderful to make even
one of these things made by Him, to be the maker of all that which
He desires. There is no God but He, the Powerful, the Mightyt
Every power is in this, wert thou to reflect! Every grace is in it,
were thou of those who perceive! I beg of God to manifest His
Cause in all countries, and that the servants may attain such a
position that He may explain to them that which He desires, with-
out veiling or concealment; that He may teach them the wonders
of His knowledge and prqvide them with the fruits of the tree
of His grace and beneficence, and that all may become.affluent
through His affluence, and that all may become powerful through
His power, the impregnable, the high and inaccessible!
390\. By the One, through whose command all are moved, had I
found the people as We created them, I would have opened a door
of doors of mercy and inner significances, so that they would be-
hold all the mysteries with their eyes, and subdue all lands through
the names of their Lord. But thou beholdest the creatures, and
hearest that which proceeds from their mouths; therefore the
bounty is restrained, except so many of its drops as thou hast
discovered. Verily, thy Lord witnesseth and is well informed
thereof. Were We to manifest Ourselves more than that which
We have manifested, dogs and deniers would surround Us.
391\. Thus hath the Cock of the Throne crowed and the Dove
cooed. Beware, that thou mayest be of the thankful. Praise be
unto God, the Lord of the creatures!

"Due to defects in the activities of the brahmins fear arises in the subjects.

The twice-born neglect the study of Vedas and do not sacrifice as prescribed.

Men perish. Ksatriyas and Vaisyas decline gradually. In      · ·Sudras
claim kinship with brahmins through their learning through interdining
and sharing seats and beds. Kings become mostly Sudras and they harass
brahmins.
Killing of foetus and murder of heroes become prevalent. Sudras adopt
the conduct of life prescribed for the brahmins and the brahmins adopt
the ways of Sudras.

> Thieves function as kings and kings function as thieves. The chaste
> ladies cease to exist and wanton sluts increase in number.
> Stability and discipline of four castes and stages of life disappear from
> all places. At that time the earth yields very little fruit in one
> place and great fruits in another.

0 Silasana, the kings confiscate and misappropriate public property.
They cease to be protectors. Sudras acquire knowledge and are honoured
by the brahmins.
Non-ksatriyas become rulers. Brahmins depend on Sudras. Sudras proud
of their intellect remain sitting in their seats and do not stir on
seeing Brahmins.

> In Kali, even the excellent brahmins demean themselves by selling the
> fruits of their austerities and sacrifices.

It should be known that towards the close of yuga, the beasts of prey
will be very violent. The selling of Vedas and other sacred literature
will occur in cross streets; young women will sell even their honour.
Men will rob others of their wealth and violate the chastity of other men's
wives. They will be lustful, wicked at heart, base and foolhardy. They
will lose proper perspective of things. Suffering from colic they will
have their hairs dishevelled.
When noble and befitting holy rites are no longer performed; when all
the people become inactive and lethargic, germs, mice and serpents will
torment men. Prosperity, welfare, health and efficiency will be
difficult to attain.

> When the yuga has come to a close and the period of junction too has
> arrived, the chastiser of the wicked people will rise up in order to kill
> all the bad living beings. He will be born in the family of the Moon.
He will be called Pramiti by name.

A. D. Pulsalker.

O'Flagherty is in accord with Dandekar historically with regard to the
late inclusion of Buddha into the Avatar list, where the Buddha is
subsumed, reluctantly and begrudgingly, into the system. Nevertheless,
a kind of unffic purpose is at work, even if at first no ethic other
than a kind of mercenary tolerance is exercised.

"The Buddha incarnation, accomplishing the delusion of the demons, is
said in many texts to be followed by the avatar of Kalkin, exterminating
the heretics and barbarians of the Kali Age; these myths presuppose a
political situation in the pre-Gupta period (precisely when the myth
of the Buddha avatar first appears), when orthodox Brahmins were fighting
a desperate.battle on two fronts, against foreign invaders and a thriving
Buddhist community at home.

"The Buddha avatar may well have been inspired by the·Kalkin avatar.

The Mahabharata and the Vayu Purana, which do not mention the Buddha
avatar, say that Visnu will be born as Kalkin in order to destroy bar-
barians and heretics. These passages may represent a reaction against
the invasion of India by Greeks, Scythians, Pahlavas, and Kusanas during
the centuries immediately preceding and following the turn of the
Christian Era. The Kalkin avatar may be connected in some way with the
idea of the Millennium, as it was current in Europe and elsewhere from
the fourth to the seventh centuries A.D., but the main inspiration was
probably the Buddhist doctrine of Maitreya, the future Buddha, which may
have been derived from Zoroastrian doctrines, perhaps brought into India
by these same invaders. The fact that Kalkin appears as a warrior on
horseback supports the possibility of some such political reference.

Only later, in the Gupta period, when Jainism and Buddhism posed a
> serious threat to the fast-burgeoning Hindu revival, does the Buddha
appear in the list of avatars, immediately preceding Kalkin."

Mahapuranas": in: Purana: Vol. 19, No. 2 (July, 1977): p. 271, the theory
continues to be defended:

"But there is also another important meaning of the fish-symbol:
that of the soul, since God is the supreme soul. This symbolic aspect
of the fish is not expressly given in Puranic texts, but emerges from
very old interpretations in ancient cultures, as for instance in
Egypt, or in Mesopotamia, and reappears in commentaries to the Purana.

"It is also possible that there was a link between the fish avatara in
India and the fish-god in Sumeric tradition: the god who brought men
arts and sciences, and constitutes a parallel to the God Ea of 'Akkadic
mythology. Now, Ea, whose name means "house of the waters", is also
related to the waters on which float the earth and is, therefore, a
sort of support; but, what is more important, is the fact that Oannes
and Ea are masters of wisdom and founders of civilization."

Representations of Oannes and depictions in Puranic texts are found to
match. Vide: Agarwal, Urmila: "Worship Of Visnu: His Incarnations In
