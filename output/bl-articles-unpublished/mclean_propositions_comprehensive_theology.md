                   Propositions on a More Comprehensive Theology

Jack McLean

Abstract

"Propositions on a More Comprehensive Theology"1 points to the wider implications of theology
for science and creativity, religious language, Bahá'í Kerygma and apologetics, the existential
dimension, the relativity of religious truth, ethics and scholarship, method and mysticism. These
propositions present theology as having the potential for formulating a unifying vision or synopsis
between the various branches of learning and the creative arts. As such "Propositions for a More
Comprehensive Theology" seek to diversify the scope of theology and free up the sacred study from
that limited understanding which would view it as a monolith having few implications for other
branches of the arts and sciences, or as a restricted specialty relegated to one corner of the
curriculum. Theology is a geometry of thought that measures both the sacred space of divine
questions and the concrete issues of the human condition. The implications for a more
comprehensive theology are elucidated through a series of thirteen propositions and sub-
propositions. These are: (1) Theology as a Comprehensive Science (2) The Theologian, Literacy
and Creativity (3) Theology and Beauty (4) Theological Language (5) Bahá'í Kerygma (6)
Responsible Apologetics (7) The Method of Correlation (8) Theology and the Existential Moment
(9) The Relativity of Religious Truth (10) Ethics and Scholarship (11) Method in Religion and
Science (12) Method in Bahá'í History (13) Mysticism.

Introduction

"Prolegomena to a Bahá'í Theology"2 asserted that it is indeed valid to speak of a "Bahá'í
theology" in a qualified sense, and that it makes sense to do so both in light of internal logic and in
the context of interreligious dialogue. That paper distinguished two types of Bahá'í theology, source
theology/revelation theology and derivative theology or commentary ("Prolegomena" 36).3 The
following thirteen propositions belong to the second category are being put forward in order to more
clearly define the outlines of a derivative theology which seeks to be comprehensive. These
propositions represent axioms located on diverse points of the theological spectrum. For the sake of
brevity they are being presented in terse propositional form. I define "proposition" as an
encapsulated statement proposed for consideration, or a deliberated judgement. "Comprehensive" is
meant to convey the idea that Bahá'í theology should aim to interact with all areas of the curriculum
and allude to all forms of knowledge which are susceptible of contributing to an increase of divine
knowledge.

All propositions follow from the cornerstone 1.[a]. The common thread that ties all the

propositions together is perspectival. The general method followed in this paper is basically that of
Aristotelian natural philosophy and adopted by classical philosophy: proceeding by rational inquiry,
offering definitions, advancing a few hypotheses, making observations, presenting judgements, and
concluding.

The thirteen propositions elaborated here are not presented in the spirit of a codified list, but
rather as dynamic principles. I recognize that there are other equally valid principles in the Bahá'í
Faith, but limitations of space do not permit a wider examination.

Proposition 1: Theology as a Comprehensive Science4

[a] The cornerstone of all propositions is Bahá'u'lláh's statement: "The source of all learning is the
knowledge of God, exalted be His glory, and this cannot be attained save through the knowledge of
His Divine Manifestation" ( "Asl-i-Kullu'l-Khayr" in Tablets 156).

[b] It follows that theology5 seeks to illuminate both divine and human science, disciplines that
employ methodical investigation. Accordingly, theology would be the most comprehensive of
sciences. Its domain includes All-Being. Theology not only consists of the statements revealed
through the authority of divine revelation, but also builds on commonsensical observations, and/or
those theories verified by experience.

[c] Following from Proposition 1.[b], "science" (scientia=knowledge) has the double-meaning of
both the principles of the exact sciences and, in `Abdu'l-Bahá's words, "discovering the verities of
the universe, the means by which man finds a pathway to God" (Promulgation of Universal Peace
49).6

[d] The most outstanding characteristic of Bahá'í theology is theophanology or manifestation
theology7 which excludes a theology of the divine essence which by definition is unknowable.

[e] Theology is a geometry of thought that measures all it surveys.

[f] In De l'espirt géomètrique (On the Geometrical Spirit) Pascal makes several cogent observations
about geometry that could be applied to a rationalistic method of theology. Pascal's essay consists of
a definition theory of the proof method of geometry whereby once certain propositions are granted,
others logically inter-related must necessarily follow. Pascal underscores, however, that those
propositions which are first in the series and from which others derive must be granted, self-evident
or axiomatic. He calls these axioms "definitions of names" (The Geometrical Spirit 429) and "a
name divested of every other meaning" (Geometrical 430), and "the arbitrary application of names
to things which are clearly designated by terms perfectly known..." (Geometrical [p.]). According to
Pascal, these names need no proof for they are self-evident.

[g] Although Pascal argues that clear definitions are necessary from which irrefutable proofs can be
logically drawn, it is ludicrous to define everything. Paradoxically, Pascal also states: "...the lack of
definition is a perfection rather than a defect, since it does not come from their obscurity [of things],

but on the contrary from their extreme obviousness..."(Geometrical 435).8

[h] The unknowability of the Divine Essence would be consequently a geometric definition of a
name.

[i] To differentiate sacred study from other forms of knowledge, Aquinas distinguished between
philosophy as "deriving from notions of creatures" and theology "not derived from creatures, but
immediately inspired by the divine light" (An Aquinas Reader 411-12).9 Aquinas made two
significant conclusions about the science of "the divine light" which he called "the doctrine of
theology" (Aquinas 411) and its relationship to the other sciences:

> One is that this science commands all the other sciences as the ruling science. The other is
> that this science uses for its service all the other sciences, as though its vassals, as is the
> case with all arts ordered to one another where the end of one is under the end of the
> another. Thus the end of preparing of powders [pharmacy], which is the making of
> medicines, is ordered to the end of the medical art itself, which is health. Hence the doctor
> commands the one who prepares the powders [the pharmacist] and uses the powders he
> prepares for his end. In the same way, since the end of the whole of philosophy is beneath
> the end of theology, and ordered to this end, theology should command all the other
> sciences and use those things that are transmitted in them (Aquinas 411-12).

[j] For Aquinas this end was "the contemplation of God" (Aquinas 411).

[k] I take Aquinas' phrase "theology should command all the other sciences" to mean to take a
leading role, rather than a return to a pre-Copernican theological age. A modern theology would
find itself integrated with the truths of the twentieth century arts, sciences and humanities.

[l] Aristotle seemed to have the same view of a "single science" in mind when he described the
philosopher's task as: "Next, it is the philosopher's task to be able to view things in a total way."
(Metaphysics, Book Gama 64) and "Now, to sum up, there is a single science that must view
systematically being as being and whatever belongs to it as being" (Metaphysics 66). P. Merlan
writes that ancient readers up to the time of Plotinus took Aristotle's being qua being as a definition
of God, for in their view "...only of God can it be said that He is, whereas everything else is not only
being but becoming" (The Cambridge History of Later Greek and Early Medieval Philosophy, 52).
This systematic view of being by a single science that embraces all sciences figures among the tasks
of Bahá'í theology.

[m] In The Secret of Divine Civilization, `Abdu'l-Bahá makes "learning and the cultural attainments
of the mind" to be "The first attribute of perfection..."(Secret 35).10 This condition is made
dependent upon a mastery of a very wide spread of several branches of learning such as: (i)
theology — "a thorough knowledge of those complex and transcendental realities pertaining to
God." (ii) Shariah — "the fundamental truths of Qur'ánic political and religious law"... (iii)
comparative religion — "the contents of the sacred Scriptures of other faiths"... (iv) what would be
called today anthropology, sociology, political science or international relations — "the laws and
principles, the customs, conditions, and manners and the material and moral virtues characterising

the statecraft of other nations"... (v) religious and exact science — "the entire field of divine and
natural science"... (vi) history — "the historical records of bygone governments and peoples". To
keep the curriculum at pace with the latest developments, `Abdu'l-Bahá also says: "He should...be
well versed in all the useful branches of learning of the day". I envision a comprehensive theology
serving as a synopsis to unify the curriculum as `Abdu'l-Bahá has outlined it.

[n] `Abdu'l-Bahá's view of learning would require a new philosophy of education and a thorough
revision of the curriculum which he also advocates (Secret 105-6). To further this end, rather than
seeing itself as an independent and autonomous discipline, Bahá'í theology should seek to establish
interconnections with the other schools of science and encompass the study of arts, sciences and
humanities.

[o] The Bahá'í perspective of such a synoptical theology seems to answer the description of synopsis
which Plato understood as a comprehensive view of the various branches of knowledge and their
relationships, relationships that he envisioned would be elucidated as a function of Dialectic
(Dialektos, <dia, between + legó, speak = discussion) for the education of the philosopher.
Dialectic was exercised at the highest section of Plato's Line, was critical of assumptions, related to
first principles and tried to grasp the essence of things. Its ultimate aim was the investigation into
the pre-existent Forms or Ideas, culminating in the idea of the Good. 11

[p] Comprehensive theology should be dialectical theology, one that aims to resolve apparent
contradictions into a higher synthesis of truth. Dialectic accepts the language of paradox and
negation as being necessary for the emergence of truth since denial provides truth with an
opportunity to assert its claims.

[q] Bahá'í theology seeks to develop a foundational theology of the world's revealed religions, one
of the most daunting tasks facing global theologians today. Although the Bahá'í Faith views the
world's religions as one organic whole, in its elaboration of this whole, it cannot escape its own
particularity.

[r] Although a line is usually drawn between participant and observer, whether it is thick or thin
depends largely on outlook. Dialogue theologian Leonard Swidler writes: "Such multiple
"belonging" [to religions] may not be possible for most religious persons, for most religious
thinkers, or for those ideologically committed, but some experience of another's religion or ideology
`from within' is possible for all of us" (Swidler, After the Absolute. The Dialogical Future of
Religious Reflection 52). Put another way, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the religion
under study, the observer should be prepared, as far as possible, to assume the point of view of the
participant. This view was first formulated by the phenomenologist, W. Brede Kristensen, in The
Meaning of Religion, who stated that observers are duty bound to accept the evaluations of believers
in their assessment of any religion: "Let us not forget that there is no other religious reality than the
faith of the believers. If we want to make the acquaintance with true religion, we are exclusively
thrown on the pronouncements of the believers." (Kristensen, Meaning 13).

[s] Whereas Kristensen's statement may help to ensure an authentic understanding of the religion
under study, it should be borne in mind that both the individual and community understanding of

the Bahá'í Faith is in constant evolution, since it is influenced by a variety of factors both cultural
and personal. The reality of the Bahá'í Faith is to be found in the Bahá'í sacred writings.12

Proposition 2: The Theologian, Literacy and Creativity

[a] Martin E. Marty states that the theologian may be an interpreter, story-teller, pastor, professional
exegete, or counselor. "The theologian....exists to interpret the world and the life of a people in the
light of a transcendent reference — in this case, of theos" (Marty, "From the Centripetal to the
Centrifugal in Culture and Religion" 5).13 The theological thread runs through consequently a
variety of literary genres and textual forms and is not restricted merely to technical theology.

[b] Theological discourse preceded the theological treatise. Although theology may be expressed in
either spoken or written form, its oral expression makes the domain of theology open to all, even to
those who are ill or barely literate.

[c] Bahá'u'lláh writes that an understanding of the Word of God depends upon "purity of heart,
chastity of soul, and freedom of spirit" (Kitáb-i-Iqán 211). [Persian] Since these qualities are
possessed by both the literate and the illiterate, it does not follow that book learning is necessary for
the exercise of theological discourse. Theology, like all Bahá'í scholarship, is not reserved only for
the select few: "Bahá'í scholarship is an endeavour accessible to all members of the Bahá'í
community, without exception...including those who may lack formal education, and those who
dwell in remote areas, villages and islands" (Bahá'í Scholarship 3).

[d] More formalised expressions or systems of theology would presuppose higher levels of literacy.

[e] Original scholarship is a form of creativity since it creates a new language of discourse.

[f] Creativity makes for a lesser sacrifice of self. Through creativity the self is "lost in thought" or
artistic creation. This loss, submerging or absorption of the ego by the creative process brings about
the submission of the ego to allow unseen forces to mould consciousness and steer the artist to new
patterns of thought and expression.

[g] The lesser sacrifice of self is brought about in creativity by inspiration.

[h] There is a great need to sound out the connections between theology and the creative arts. A
theological perspective of creativity can be found in the contemplation of the many creative acts of
God which the artist imitates by producing a multitude of forms and expressions that preserve and
perpetuate the sense of the true, the beautiful and the eternal. Speaking loosely, creativity is the
emergence of something out of nothing.14 Creativity shares with religion the work of the liberation
of the spirit while it indwells the body, one of the meanings of salvation. In the creative arts, there
lie unsuspected powers of joy and liberation to inspire spirituality, and to release those instinctive
spiritual forces generated at the beginning of "dream time"15 forces that constitute in part humanity's
common archetypal sacred memory.

[i] The creative arts express the human need for joy and celebration which are likewise vital
functions of religion. Bahá'u'lláh's exhorts us to "rejoice in the gladness of thine heart" and to
experience "the joy of reunion". He also says: "O SON OF SPIRIT! With the joyful tidings of light I
hail thee: rejoice!"16 Such divine celebration is one of the meanings of spiritual liberation.

Proposition 3: Theology and Beauty

[a] There are clear aesthetic dimensions to the work of theology through an analysis of those
elements comprising a religion of beauty with its harmonies of truth, proportion and perfection.
Such elements of beauty are suggested in the following quotation of `Abdu'l-Bahá:

> It is natural for the heart and spirit to take pleasure and enjoyment in all things that show
> forth symmetry, harmony, and perfection. For instance: a beautiful house, a well designed
> garden, a symmetrical line, a graceful motion, a well written book, pleasing garments — in
> fact, all things that have in themselves grace and beauty are pleasing to the heart and spirit
> — ....("Music" 2:78).17

[b] Further, there is an aesthetic dimension to the spiritual realities of holiness and blessedness.
`Abdu'l-Bahá speaks of "the beauty of holiness" (Star of the West, 9:8, 1 August 1918)18, a beauty
that was modelled to a supreme degree in the example of his own life. Bahá'u'lláh has united
blessedness with beauty as indicated in one of his divine titles Jamál-i-Mubárak, the Blessed
Beauty. Such a "beauty of holiness" is entirely consistent with the prophet David's psalm in which
he sings: "Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; worship the Lord in the beauty of
holiness" (Heb.= Hadrat Kadósh). (Psalm 29:2)19

[c] Aristotle also held that beauty is implicit in knowledge. Alexi Losev and Aza Takho-Godi
interpret Aristotle's teaching on beauty and knowledge in this way:

> In a word, all knowledge is beautiful according to Aristotle. All philosophy is true beauty,
> to which one must always give oneself up completely, endlessly, patiently, diligently,
> serenely, trusting in the possibility of achieving truth and beauty...(Aristotle 96).

Losev and Takho-Godi further cite Aristotle's concept of the Good in the Metaphysics (12:7) as the
source of everything that from the beginning is complete, beautiful and perfect. Aristotle says:

> Those who suppose, as the Pythagoreans and Speusippus do, that supreme beauty and
> goodness are not present in the beginning, because the beginnings both of plants and
> animals are causes, but beauty and completeness are in the effects of these, are wrong in
> their opinion. For the seed comes from other individuals which are prior and complete, and
> the first thing is not seed but the complete being (Cited in Aristotle 96).

[d] God in the Bahá'í Faith, as for the God in Aristotle's cosmological scheme,20 the Primum
Mobilum (Prime Mover), is the object of all desire, and exerts an attractive force on all the spheres
which gravitate toward Him. The Báb prays: "O God, my God, my Beloved, my heart's Desire"

(Bahá'í Prayers [p.]). The sublimest form of eros, the supreme attractive force, is the love of the
soul for God, generated in response to God's love for the soul, its Creator. This divine eros is
intrinsic to the religion of beauty.

Proposition 4: Theological Language

[a] Theological language is expressed by both the cognitive (true/false) and non-cognitive
statement21 and includes such expressions as the moral imperative, the narrative account, the
existential moment, the emotive élan, the vision quest,22 and the psychological truth. It [theological
language] therefore lends itself both to rational and logical exposition and the subtleties of intuitive
knowledge and expression.

[b] The language of theology should not be reduced to one static monotone. There is a variety of
vocabularies and dialects that make up theological discourse.23 This variety lends a certain
flexibility of expression to Bahá'í theology. Creative writing is also well suited to the expression of
a metaphysic of meaning and to spiritual experience, both in any oblique or overt theological
purpose it may have, as well as in any psychological sense.24 Even though theologians and
philosophers may speak in different accents and dialects, it would further mutual understanding if
the speakers of each dialect were at least familiar with the others' language. Subjectively, one may
prefer some accents to others, but objectively one cannot say that one accent is better than another.
Consequently, no one language more correctly defines Bahá'í theology.

[c] The radical constraints on language to adequately express conceptual thought are explicitly
acknowledged by Bahá'u'lláh when he says:

> How great the multitude of truths which the garment of words can never contain! How vast
> the number of such verities as no expression can adequately describe, whose significance
> can never be unfolded, and to which not even the remotest allusions can be made!

(Gleanings From the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh 176).

[d] Proposition 4.[c] notwithstanding, theologians reject the assertions of linguistic logicians and
positivists that metaphysical statements are meaningless.25

[e] The writings of theologians and philosophers are susceptible, however, of falling into the
labyrinth of those sciences "which begin with words and end with words" (Bahá'u'lláh, "The third
Tajallí" in Tablets 52).26 Consequently, theological reflection should retain as its goal clarification
or resolution of questions, rather than sterile or obscure analysis. Theology in its relationship to
spiritual life should, moreover, inspire, inform or elucidate the dynamics involved in the acquisition
of spirituality.27 To configure the lived experience of the believer should figure among the principal
aims of theology.28

[f] While a knowledge of source languages is indispensable for the translation and commentary of
Bahá'í scared scripture, and a definite advantage in the study of Bahá'í theology, citing text at source
does not in and per se ensure a resolution of the hermeneutical dilemma.29 Textual study tends to be

very focused and concrete, but the Word of God is highly allusive. Exposition makes these allusions
explicit. Exposition, however, does not depend solely on lexicographical ability.

[g] G. Widengren30 wrote in this respect: "Philology alone does not make a student a historian of
religion, any more than a historian of law, medicine, or economics" ("Stand und Aufgaben der
iranischen Religionsgeschichte", Numen 1, 1954-5, 17). Exegetical and all syntactical approaches
should be integrated with some larger overall network of meaning.

[h] I hypothesize that there is a silent grammar of theology built into the syntax of language when it
expresses the unity of God, the plurality of the divine names, and the relationship between Being
(Existence) and Essence (Substance). This tacit grammar of theology hidden in speech suggests that
Essence and Existence are both co-dependent and co-eternal. This silent grammar of theology can
be decoded by reflecting on the meaning of the divine names.

[i] Some have envisioned that the future of theological discourse lies in a growing fusion between
theological language and literary critical theory and such genres of creative writing as drama, sacred
narrative, poetry and historical fiction. P. Joseph Cahill points to a closer collaboration of literary
criticism and theology:

> In conjunction with the basic research required to study the history of religions, literary
> criticism offers meaningful structures which can disclose the literary and religious
> universes of all men. If there is to be a large systematic theology in the future, it will have
> to be congruent with the data disclosed by the critical operation of literary criticism. And
> the task of the theological interpreter is to insure that his vision of the theological world be
> at least as broad as the literary universe. ("Literary Criticism, Religious Literature, and
> Theology", Studies in Religion/Sciences religieuses, 12:1, 61).

Such a view is fully congruent with the Bahá'í outlook which advocates a close partnership for the
literary and dramatic arts and theological discourse.31 In this closer collaboration, both myth and
symbol, the two most effective vehicles for moving the psychological depths, and existential
spiritual experience will play central roles as devices to further such a unitive vision of literary and
spiritual truth.

[j] Propositional theological language should take into account both religious experience and the
textuality of sacred texts rather than basing itself strictly on the fixed intellectual construct ("I am all
the Prophets: The Poetics of Pluralism in Bahá'í Texts", (Poetics Today 14:3, Fall 1993, 447-476).32

[k] The Bahá'í vision of the arts aims at a restatement of poetry as a premier literary genre.
Wordsworth reports Aristotle that poetry is the most philosophical of writing (Preface to the Lyrical
Ballads).33 `Abdu'l-Bahá is reported to have said that "Poetry is much more effective and complete
than prose. It stirs more deeply, for it is of finer composition"("Music", The Compilation of
Compilations, 2:78).34 The Báb, the Prophet-Herald of Bahá'u'lláh, during his nine month
imprisonment (1848) in the mountain fortress of Máh-Kú in Adhirbáyján, quoted to his first disciple
Mullá Husayn, a well-known Islamic tradition: "Treasures lie hidden beneath the throne of God; the
key to those treasures is the tongue of poets." (Nabíl's Narrative. The Dawn-Breakers 258-9)

[l] The art and science of rhetoric as an integral part of theological language awaits further study by
Bahá'í scholars.35

Proposition 5: Bahá'í Kerygma36

[a] The root of Bahá'í kerygma lies in the historical divine-human encounter of the Báb and
Bahá'u'lláh with God. These twin Manifestations of God have inaugurated a "...new cycle of human
power"(`Abdu'l-Bahá in London, 19),37 and fulfil the divine promise of the Coming One given at the
inception of the Adamic cycle. With the proclamation of their divine revelations comes the
assurance of the saving grace of one universal prophetic faith in "a world come of age".38

[b] The quintessential kerygma word is the apocalyptic proclamation of the Báb: "I am, I am, I am
the Promised One!" (God Passes By 21).39

[c] The Bahá'í kerygma event (BKE) of 1844 invites all men and women to a decision of faith
whereby we are called to die to self and the world and to live again in the Word of God.

[d] The break-through of a divine revelation into space-time establishes its own timetable and fixes
its own agenda based on the requirements of the age. Bahá'í kerygma proclaims that this
transformational process is now upon us.

[e] The BKE aims at nothing less than a new creation which Tillich wrote was the ultimate concern:

> The New Creation — this is our ultimate concern; this should be our infinite passion — the
> infinite passion of every human being. This matters; this alone matters ultimately. In
> comparison with it everything else, even religion or non-religion, even Christianity or non-
> Christianity, matters very little — and ultimately nothing (The New Being 19).40

[f] The BKE necessarily seeks to vindicate both truth and transcendence and is causally linked to
apologia with its proclamation of prophethood, for the voice of divine transcendence and truth is
ever met with disdain, doubt and denial.

Proposition 6: Responsible Apologetics41

[a] Apology is not merely the defence of faith. It is also an attempt to rationally justify the meaning
of faith to a world dominated by materialism, meaninglessness, and secularism. It is both the
justification and on-going interpretation of faith to an unbelieving world.

[b] Old style apologetics took the form of monologue. Bahá'í apologetics assumes that the dialogue
partner possesses valid understandings of divine truth.

[c] Historically, apologetics is usually at its peak during the formative age of a religion, an age in
which the Bahá'í Faith currently finds itself. It was the "apologetic impulse" (Krieger, The New

Universalism. Foundations for a Global Theology 17)42 that first drove Christian theology, and
made it a vital enterprise. This "apologetic impulse" should also continue to be a driving force for
Bahá'í theology today.

[d] Apologia is not restricted to religion alone, but is implicit in socio-political systems and
worldviews, either secular or theistic.

[e] The etymological roots of "responsible" are found in the Latin respondere meaning to answer.
The responsible Bahá'í philosopher or theologian is consequently one who is engaged in answering.
The corollary is that responsible apologetics is also an apologetics that questions.

[f] "Responsible" means: (1) not autocratic (2) capable of rational conduct (3) respectable (4) of
good credit or position or repute (5) involving responsibility, as that of an office. Such definitions
have their origins mainly in concepts of statecraft or political office and by analogy point to the
theologian as a responsible member of the community.

[g] Apologetics should exclude dogmatism, empty rhetoric, or sterile ideology, the politics of an
idea without the dynamics of faith. `Abdu'l-Bahá, moreover, deprecates "fanaticism and
unreasoning religious zeal" and quotes the quranic maxim arising from Moses' and Aaron's historic
interview with Pharaoh: "Speak ye to him with gentle speech" (Qur'án 20:46) and "Debate with
them in the kindliest manner" (Qur'án 16:126) (Secret 53).

[h] Responsible apologetics is committed apologetics. Karl Barth's statement is particularly
meaningful to Bahá'ís.: "The word and the work of the believer cannot possibly remain a neutral,
uncommitted work and word. Where there is faith, God's doxa, gloria, His brightness is necessarily
made known on earth" (Dogmatics in Outline 30).

[i] Apologetical approaches to the study of religion and the non-normative, non-confessional
science of religion (Religionswissenschaft) are currently at odds in the academy. Bahá'í scholarship,
however, bridges this gap in the light of its teaching on the complementarity of science and religion
by requiring that any apologetic approaches to the Bahá'í Faith make good use of the techniques and
findings of the scientific study of religion.

[j] Apologetics requires, moreover, the presence of philosophy in order to sharpen its critical sense
and to deter it from dogmatism.

[k] In today's global village, apologetical theology needs another ally: the comparative study of
religions or global theology whose potential `Abdu'l-Bahá saw at the beginning of this century as a
means of eliminating prejudice and fostering unity. During a talk at Eighth Street Temple in
Washington, D.C., November 8, 1912 `Abdu'l-Bahá said:

> Praise be to God! You are living in a land of freedom. You are blessed with men of learning,
> men who are well versed in the comparative study of religions. You realize the need of unity
> and know the great harm which comes from prejudice and superstition...This [prejudice]

must be abandoned, and the way to do it is to investigate the reality which underlies all the
religions (The Promulgation of Universal Peace 410).

[l] An apologetic approach to Bahá'í theology is not to be based upon a coercive confessionality, for
Bahá'u'lláh says:

> In this Day, We can neither approve the conduct of the fearful that seeketh to dissemble his
> faith, nor sanction the behavior of the avowed believer that clamorously asserteth his
> allegiance to this Cause. Both should observe the dictates of wisdom, and strive diligently
> to serve the best interests of the Faith (Gleanings 343).

[m] In light of `Abdu'l-Bahá's prophecy of widespread and severe opposition to the Bahá'í Faith,43
Bahá'í teaching will need advocates for its defence.

[n] The Kitáb-i-Aqdas contains, moreover, some provisions that fly in the face of conventional
wisdom and popular morality. These provisions will require rational justification in the face of those
critics who will reject the divine standards advocated by Bahá'u'lláh.44

[o] Bahá'u'lláh was the first apologist for his faith. `Abdu'l-Bahá has moreover exhorted the Bahá'ís
to unveil to the world the greatness of Bahá'u'lláh and his preeminence in spiritual history:

Further, speak of the greatness of Bahá'u'lláh, of the events that took place in Persia and
> Turkey, of the astonishing influence that He exerted, of the contents of the Epistles which
> he addressed to all the sovereigns, and of their fulfilment (Selections From the Writings of
> `Abdu'l-Bahá 308).45

Proclaiming Bahá'u'lláh's greatness is not undertaken as a will to power, or to promote spiritual
exclusivity, but rather because it is fitting to begin to appreciate Bahá'u'lláh as one of the great
spiritual geniuses of history.

[p] Robert Parry has rightly pointed out there is an existential dimension to the enterprise of
apologetics, an existential dimension that seeks responsibility:

Proposition 7: The Method of Correlation

[a] In proposition 6.[p] Parry is echoing the method of correlation found in both Shoghi Effendi and
Paul Tillich. Tillich's monumental three volume work, the Systematic Theology (1951-1963),46 is
based upon a method of correlation, one that is basically apologetic. Tillich writes: "Apologetic
theology is `answering theology.' It answers the questions implied in the `situation' in the power of
the eternal message and with the means provided by the situation whose question it answers"
(Systematic Theology 6). In A History of Christian Thought Tillich also writes: "This is the
apologetic form of theology which I use in my own systematic theology, that is, the correlation
between question and answer." (26-27).47 Such a method of question and answer is also employed
in the Bahá'í sacred writings, in such texts as Bahá'u'lláh's The Kitáb-i-Aqdas48 and `Abdu'l-Bahá's
Some Answered Questions.

[b] Shoghi Effendi also advocated a method of correlation in order to relate the Bahá'í Faith "to
modern aspects of philosophy and science" and "to correlate" the Bahá'í Faith with "all the
progressive movements and thoughts being put forth today" and with the various branches of the
university curriculum:

> It is hoped that all the Bahá'í students will follow the noble example you have set before
> them and will, henceforth, be led to investigate and analyze the principles of the Faith and
> to correlate them with the modern aspects of philosophy and science. Every intelligent and
> thoughtful young Bahá'í should always approach the Cause in this way, for therein lies the
> very essence of the principle of independent investigation of truth (cited by the Universal
> House of Justice in a letter to an individual 19 October, 1993). [emphasis not in Shoghi
> Effendi].

In another communication through his secretary, Shoghi Effendi also used the key methodological
word "correlate":

> Shoghi Effendi has for years urged the Bahá'ís (who asked his advice, and in general also)
> to study history, economics, sociology, etc., in order to be au courant with all the
> progressive movements and thoughts being put forth today. and so that they could
> correlate these to the Bahá'í teachings. (The Universal House of Justice, letter of 19

October, 1993)[emphasis not in Shoghi Effendi].

[c] Correlation is a method of both dialogue and scholarship whereby we interact with individuals
and other systems of thought. As such correlation assumes that there is an element or elements of
commonality in the things being compared, without there being total identification in all respects. In
this sense, correlation respects particularity.

[d] Correlation clarifies truth statements, and as a function of dialectic leads to the emergence of
new truths.

[e] Further, correlation connects a sequence of interrelated events or thoughts in a progressive
theology that links the intellectual and spiritual life of antiquity with modern thought. In this
respect, correlation can be viewed as bridge between the ancient and modern worlds.

[f] Sandra Hutchison sees in Shoghi Effendi's method of correlation a certain pragmatism that
invites us "to contemplate the relationship between the academic disciplines we are pursuing and
the social principles enunciated in the Bahá'í writings" ("Interchange", The Bahá'í Studies Bulletin,
[date]). Hutchison sees, moreover, in the method of correlation a "bridge" that might link the Bahá'í
perspective with other contemporary issues or projects.

[g] Further, Hutchison foresees in Shoghi Effendi's method of correlation the possibilities for
practical problem-solving, a new theoretical framework, holistic methodologies and the
advancement of interdisciplinary studies. With Shoghi Effendi's call for the practice of a "more
profound and coordinated Bahá'í scholarship" (letter to an individual 3 July 1949), Hutchison sees
the possibility not only for "solutions to specific modern problems..." but also for providing "the
basis upon which a new theoretical framework for understanding our chosen subjects can be
established.", and "their implications with respect to interdisciplinary studies as well as to the
development of holistic methodologies within each discipline...("Interchange", same).

[h] Shoghi Effendi's statement that the Bahá'í teachings are to be taken as "a great balanced whole"
(letter to an individual 19 March 1946), is a validation of holism and invites us to consider that the
method of correlation can serve to provide linkages between poles in the intellectual sphere. For,
without these linkages or correlations, thinkers in the various disciplines might remain at the
antipoles, and diverse disciplines might remain entrenched in worldviews that would make dialogue
with other modes or systems of thought problematic.

[i] Correlation as a method of question and answer in the search for truth presents two models, open
and closed.

(1) T= OQ (open). The truth remains an open question. The question is unanswered. (2) T= Q + A
(closed). The truth is revealed by the question and answer.

[j] Theoretical questions may be answered satisfactorily, existential questions, not. Existential
questions which derive from life experiences are dilemmas that must be lived through and their
answers continually sought.

[k] As for answers, the Buddha is reported to have said in the Anguttara-nikáya, that answers
should be given in the following manner: (1) Directly (2) By analysis of the question (3) By
counter-questions. But the fourth answer is no answer, for it sets the question aside. (Walpola
Rahula, What The Buddha Taught 64).

[l] The method of question and answer is not only academic and theoretical, but also real,
transformative and practical. It is basic to all teaching and learning, profoundly influences the
evolution of science, and has major consequences in courts of law. Indeed, question and answer can
lead to revolutionary societal changes. The poor man in the third world asks himself, "Why don't I
have shoes while they live in such luxury?" and the rest, as they say, is history.

Proposition 8: Theology and The Existential Moment

[a] In addition to analyzing questions or presenting interpretations or data, Bahá'í theology should
not fail to address the human condition. This lived experience often breaks into consciousness as the
"existential moment". By existential moment I mean the subjective experiences that rise up to
confront the individual in: (i) a moment of profound meaning which significantly raises
consciousness or alters perspective (ii) a situation of spiritual crisis or test (iii) a moment of spiritual
transformation.

[b] The contrarieties and the experiences of loss, suffering and eventual death which the individual
unavoidably faces in the world, offer the possibility of investing the Lebensituation (the life
situation/the human condition) with meaning by embracing the realm of spiritual values or the
truths of the Word of God.

[c] Reinhold Niebuhr has written that the "...essential homelessness of the human spirit is the
ground of all religion..." (The Nature and Destiny of Man [p.]) This state of homelessness has a
positive value when it causes the restless heart and the searching mind to seek God. Without God, it
leads to disillusionment.

[d] The patterns of existential experience do not lie only in the individual's experiences of the "real
world", in the day to day round of the quotidian. They can also be found in the Word of God and in
the archetypal experiences of sacred history, and in the deeds and events in the lives of the Prophets
of God. The life experiences of the Prophets do not explain theoretical questions. They provide
models that tutor the believer in right-mindedness and right action in the face of suffering or
adversity, furnishing at the same time a wealth of meaning that illuminates individual experience.
The existential moment provides the individual with an opportunity to articulate the personal
meaning bound up in le vécu (the lived experience) and to construct a spiritual Lebensphilosophie
(philosophy of life).

Proposition 9: The Relativity of Religious Truth

[a] The Absolute cannot be relativised either by thought or discourse.

[b] We should not fall into the trap of absolutising relativity. Relativity as a concept is itself relative.
The worldview of post modernism attempts to abolish the notion of some ultimate system of truth
and value through a radical view of relativity. The dangers, however, of this anti-systematic
splitting up of the intellectual universe into such diverse micro-worlds of subjectivity are twofold:
First, such radical subjectivity effectively weakness the community of intra-subjective thought and

the commonality of language and weakens the viability of any universal value system. Second, such
acute subjectivity undermines the concept of relativity itself, and forces it into continual retreat.
Relativity becomes meaningful only in relation to and through the Absolute. If there are no ultimate
truths, no Absolute Mind or irreducible absolute convictions, what remains is a series of
disconnected relativities wherein every statement can become a true or false statement, or a
statement devoid of signifying force.

[c] Religious relativity acts as a bulwark against the one-way interpretation of dogmatism. It implies
that religious truth, although fundamentally one, is progressive, dynamic, infinite, and ever-
changing.49 Relativity is open to various interpretations of metaphysical and theological questions
which would on the surface appear to be incompatible. Relativity is thus an ally of a more inclusive
view of reality, one that allows for a diversity of approaches and methodologies, but which does not
destroy systematisation and the notion of absolute truth, and which does not fall into the trap of
radical subjectivity. The relativity of religious truth also has strong implications for establishing a
large measure of complementarity between science and religion, one of the most meaningful and
potentially fruitful questions in our time.50

[d] Notwithstanding 9.[b] one does perceive the Absolute (God) or irreducible truth statements in a
relative way. This statement can have two meanings: (1) One's Sitz im Leben (life setting) changes
one's understanding of the Absolute. Tomorrow's understanding will be different from today's. (2)
To say that one perceives Absolute Mind or Absolute Truth in a relative way becomes functional
and meaningful especially in dialogue. In dialogue, one enters into the paradox of relativity during
which one's own absolute convictions become temporarily suspended and relativised in order to
listen to the truth of the speaking-other. Through this temporary suspension of the doctrinal,51 one
becomes alert to the possibility of the emergence of commonly held shared truths.

[e] The "temporary suspension of the doctrinal" does not indicate an incidental betrayal of our most
profound beliefs. It allows us to function "as if" our deepest religious convictions are momentarily
inactive. This "as if" fosters an openness on our part and a receptivity to the truth of the speaking-
other thus helping to ensure that the speaking-other feels as if her views have been sincerely and
conscientiously received.

[f] Although the relativity of religious truth may lead to rapprochement with those whose belief
system may differ from one's own, one can question the practice of a methodology of total époché
(suspension of judgement) (Gk.=suspension)52 where the Bahá'í writings make unambiguous
doctrinal statements. Époché can be used effectively, however, when approaching the study of any
phenomenon in order not to create undue bias of the subject, for bias of some kind is intrinsic to any
theology, philosophy or science.

[g] Further to 9.[b], "Relativity becomes meaningful only in relation to and through the Absolute",
one of the meanings of the eternal absolute is the immutable spiritual law as taught by `Abdu'l-
Bahá.

> The spiritual aspect of religion is the greater, the more important of the two, [of the
> spiritual and the practical] and this is the same for all time, it never changes! It is the same

yesterday, today, and for ever! `As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be (Paris
Talks 142-3).

[h] In Bahá'í thought God is the Absolute. The domain of the absolute includes moreover the unity
of the prophets. Bahá'u'lláh reveals that the unity of the prophets is "absolute"(Gleanings 78). One
can, of course, say that one's understanding of this absolute unity is relative, or relative to
Bahá'u'lláh's, but this absolute and independent objective existence of prophetic unity is in no way
compromised by one's relative understanding of it. Bahá'u'lláh also states that in the mystical state,
the "true seeker" through the application of ardent search, spiritual discipline and passion "will
perceive within every atom a door that leadeth to the stations of absolute certitude" (Kitáb-i-Iqán
196). While in this condition one may "touch the Absolute",53 but one does not in any sense become
the Absolute. During the mystical encounter with the divine attributes of creation, the relativities of
consciousness momentarily cease to exist.

[i] On the absolute side of the relative/absolute dyad, Udo Schaefer sees in divine truth an absolute
character:

> Divine truth on the other hand is absolute. One can accept it or reject it, but once accepted,
> it is no longer at our disposal (steht sie nicht mehr zur Disposition). Such truth is
> authoritative, above criticism, and not subject to rational justification (keiner
> Hinterfragung fähig). One has no right to whittle it down or simply unhinge it by
> relativism. (Heilsgeschichte und Paradigmenwechsel, Zwei Beiträge zur Bahá'í-Theologie,
> 59).54

[j] Schaefer contrasts the absolute nature of religious convictions with the method of philosophy
which by contrast can be selective and eclectic. He maintains that there is no contradiction with
Shoghi Effendi's statement that "religious truth is not absolute but relative" (World Order 115) since
the religious relativity of which Shoghi Effendi writes refers to dispensational divine revelation,
suited to a particular phase of social evolution, and to the human capacity to conceive divine truth at
that phase, which nonetheless makes its claims on human consciousness in an absolute way.
(Schaefer 59-60).

Proposition 10: Ethics and Scholarship55

[a] The Bahá'í Faith gives more weight to ethical theism than it does to propositional theology.

[b] `Abdu'l-Bahá has defined ethics as "the fundamental aspect of the religion of God"
(Promulgation 403).56 Ethics finds its true origins in the workings of the Primal Will [source
language].57 An understanding of and response to the Primal Will takes place through both reason
and obedience, that is, in finding a rational justification for the law and in submitting the human will
to the divine imperative. Although, as `Abdu'l-Bahá points out, reason plays a strong role in the
justification of ethical principles,58 the ultimate justification for ethical behaviour lies in the
authority of the divine imperative expressed as "God doeth whatsoever He willeth".59 Reason,
however, is characterised by an ambiguity that is not characteristic of the Divine Will.

[c] The Primal Will seeks to influence the human soul to be predisposed to act in a befitting way,
and this predisposition on the part of the individual seeks to repeat itself in forms of behaviour that
become societal custom. Ethics is also governed by questions of emotions or personal taste (liking
or not liking). It is moreover clear from a reading of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas60 that divine love also plays
a vital role as a motivating force in the exercise of ethical behaviour. The result is that Bahá'u'lláh's
ethics reflect both strong moral imperatives and a mystical spirituality of divine love.

[d] Belief in a Primal Will stems from an anthropological analogy of the Divinity, namely, a
personal or voluntaristic one that sees God as the All-Powerful Personal Being who guides by
divine imperative in order to form ethical conduct. This would clearly align the Bahá'í concept of
the Primal Will with the Abrahamic faiths and with Hinduism, since Buddhism and Taoism do not
normally ground their ethical codes in a divinely revealed will. We can find, however, a common
ground between the Bahá'í Faith and the eastern religions in terms of practical morality, in the
disciplined pursuit of self-mastery which results collectively in more stable, productive and
harmonious social relationships, and individually in a greater measure of tranquillity. Like the
eastern religions, the Bahá'í Faith would also hold that the individual who is immoral can be neither
truly wise nor detached, liberated or whole.

[e] The modes of Bahá'u'lláh's utterance are very diverse and allow for a multiplicity of
interpretations. The Bahá'í theologian is thus free to create a wide-range of discourse.

[f] Bahá'u'lláh says in "The First Tajallí":

> True belief in God and recognition of Him cannot be complete save by acceptance of that
> which He hath revealed and by observance of whatsoever hath been decreed by Him and
> set down in the Book by the Pen of Glory. They that immerse themselves in the ocean of
> His utterances should at all time have the utmost regard for the divinely-revealed
> ordinances and prohibitions ("Tajallíyát" in Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh 50).

The earlier translation of this text instead of "by observance" renders [Arabic verb] by the more
active verbal noun "by practising all that He hath commanded..."(Bahá'í World Faith 188)
(emphasis mine). The earlier translation more faithfully conveys the meaning implicit in
Bahá'u'lláh's statement that divine knowledge is linked to praxis (practical knowledge), that is, the
practice of good deeds. Knowledge is linked to praxis in a relationship of mutual dependence or
symbiosis. Bahá'u'lláh's epistemology consists of a an interaction of praxis and sound theoretical
knowledge. Consequently, the ideal theologian would be likewise the true believer.

[g] Following Proposition 4.[b]. above, religious studies could well benefit from a "judicious
cooperation"61 between the historians, sociologists and scriptural exegetes on the one hand, and the
philosophers, comparative religionists and theologians on the other hand. The work of historians
and scriptural commentators, valuable in its own right, benefits the work of philosophers and
theologians who are able to provide larger interpretations of the sacred texts and historical episodes,
and correlate these to a broad horizon of religious phenomena and philosophies. Scriptural
commentators likewise benefit from the wider application by philosophers and theologians of
textual studies. Comparative religionist H.D. Lewis recognized a generation ago the need for

scholars of religion to engage in cooperative learning:

> This is an area of study where the close cooperation of many scholars seems to be pre-
> eminently required. Even when we seem to be dealing with severely factual issues or with
> scientific questions, our understanding of how certain practices appeared in respect of their
> ultimate meaning and significance to those who observed them, can be of the utmost
> importance; and that is an area where the philosopher has much to contribute. If the
> linguistic expert complains that the philosopher intrudes upon a domain where he is
> lacking the necessary tools, the philosopher can make the corresponding claim about the
> technical expert. In any case, no one can have the same expert mastery in all important
> fields of linguistic study. One expert must learn from another and rely on the most
> authoritative opinion available in fields where human frailty and limitations of time
> preclude his being an expert himself. Judicious cooperation seems to be the appropriate
> policy, and in some respects the insights of the philosopher appear to be essential pre-
> requisites for the soundest understanding of the features of the various cultures of the
> world (Lewis, The Study of Religion 137).

[h] The scholar is called upon to observe a judicious balance between his/her understanding of the
truth and the integrity of the Bahá'í teachings. `Abdu'l-Bahá has written: "...no soul must either
publicly or privately utter one word against or in contradiction to the general Teachings..." (Tablets
of `Abdu'l-Bahá, 3:433-434).62 Shoghi Effendi has also written: "To discard the authority of the
revealed Words is heretic....", but he also says in the same context, "and to suppress completely
individual interpretation of those Words is also bad. We should try to strike a happy medium
between these two extremes" (Principles of Bahá'í Administration 25). These directives help ensure
the "unity of doctrine" (The Universal House of Justice, Wellspring of Guidance 53) that is so vital
in preserving the unity of the Bahá'í Faith, while allowing for at the same time a certain freedom of
interpretation.

[i] These directives also have important applications for Bahá'ís engaging in interreligious dialogue.
Leonard Swidler, who echoes the views of Panikkar and others, writes that the authentic partner in
dialogue has to remain "true to the vital core of his or her own religious tradition" (After the
Absolute. The Dialogical Future of Religious Reflection 46) in order to witness sincerely to the
other, just as the other must remain authentic to his/her tradition in order to witness sincerely to us.
Swidler referring to "the golden rule" of interreligious dialogue advocated by Raimundo Panikkar
and Wilfred Cantwell Smith, states that "the side interpreted must be able to recognize itself in the
interpretation" (Swidler 44). Swidler's Fifth Rule of the "Ground Rules for Interreligious and
Interideological Dialogue" states further: "Thus it is mandatory that each dialogue partner defines
what it can mean to be an authentic member of that tradition." (Swidler 44)

[j] Shoghi Effendi has defined in part the "true believer" as one who maintains "close association
with the spirit as well as the form of the present-day Bahá'í administration throughout the
world..."(Principles of Bahá'í Administration 5). This definition applies also [and perhaps
especially] to the scholar who, because of the solitary and demanding nature the work, may see
him/herself apart from the community, or disassociated from the Bahá'í administration.

[k] In the same vein, H. Richard Niebuhr focused on the social or community aspect of "the
responsible self". For Niebuhr, the responsible self is "an accountable self, called upon by its
companions to answer for its responses to nature" (The Responsible Self. An Essay in Christian
Moral Philosophy 81-2).63 Niebuhr's triadic theory of responsibility involves the notions of: (i)
response (ii) interpretation (iii) accountability or social solidarity. (Responsible Self, 61-5). Drawing
on Josiah Royce's ideas of loyalty to a cause and community, Niebuhr writes:

> Now in devotion to a cause — be it a nation or science or a religion or some simple duty —
> he finds himself associated with other loyalists to the same cause. The bond of loyalty is
> then a double bond, on the one hand to the companions, on the other to the cause. So the
> soldier's loyalty is an affair of faithfulness to his fellow soldiers, and to the cause, never to
> one of them alone (Niebuhr 83).

[l] By analogy, one could say consequently that the Bahá'í scholar's loyalty is to Bahá'u'lláh, the
Bahá'í Cause and the community, not to oneself alone.

[m] The Bahá'í scholar should not be viewed consequently as an exceptionally solitary individual
who is without ideological bounds, but rather as a member of the community who has entered into a
covenantal relationship and who occupies a unique position of trust in the faithful transmission of
the Bahá'í teachings.

Proposition 11: Method in Religion and Science

[a] Whereas the scientific method proceeds in part by a process of the controlled experiment which
inspires confidence because of its predictability, or by a process of logical symbolic demonstration
(mathematics), its incessant questioning, constant revision, and doubt recognize no transcendent
sacred authority for the determination of truth. Belief in prophetic faith requires, however, an assent
to divine authority and proposes that belief in God as a personal Being surpass every weight of
value.

[b] Divine teaching holds out timeless truths, and grants repose to the soul in the certitude of God's
love and salvation.

[c] The propositions of theology should be subject to scientific inquiry, that is, being critical of
assumptions, advancing hypotheses, verifying results, pursuing research in an open and free spirit
while cautiously offering conclusions.

[d] A significant benefit of science to religion is the banishment of puerile, superstitious, and
fanatical modes of thought and feeling from religion's intellectual and emotional life.

[e] The results of scientific inquiry lead to the plausibility of the God hypothesis as the supreme
intelligent force behind the universe. Religion confirms the hypothesis and makes explicit the acts
of God within nature, history, and the human soul.

[f] The Bahá'í Faith is proclaimed to be "scientific in its method" (Shoghi Effendi, World Order
xi).64 The meaning of the phrase "scientific method" as applied to the Bahá'í Faith is deemed to be
"soft" rather than "hard". Bahá'í theology would best profit from the application of scientific method
when the phrase is interpreted broadly to mean that the study of questions should be conscious,
thorough, and orderly, and that statements show evidence of critical thinking, and be empirically,
intuitively or logically verifiable.

[g] As Einstein has pointed out, the scientific method is lame without appropriate goals. Ways and
means are ineffective when not defined in terms of ends. Einstein wrote:

> Whatever this tool [scientific method] in the hand of man will produce, depends entirely
> upon the nature of the goals alive in this mankind. Once these goals exist, the scientific
> method furnished means to realize them (Ideas and Opinions 328).

[h] A too rigid application of the scientific method to religion, as an overly facile solution to the
now waning conflict between religion and science, would fundamentally deform the nature both of
God and religion through reductionism. Namely, it would reduce the concept of God to the
Absolute Idea and religion to the cognitive question.

[i] Excessive deduction limits Bahá'í theology. If pursued excessively deduction leads to antinomies
and denies experience, reducing theology to a narrow form of ratiocination. Bahá'í theology must
also include the description of phenomena, and where description is lacking, theology will suffer
from an overly rational fabric. Description is the method both of history and the account of mystical
experience.

[j] Science cannot provide worldview. The proponents of scientism mistake the part for the whole
by attributing a world view to science. Science does not deal with the cosmos65 in a unified way, for
the "cosmos" must take into account both the human being as spiritual self and questions of value.
Huston Smith writes:

> It happens though, that a scientific world view is impossible. I do not mean that we are a
> long way from having such a view: I mean that we will never have one — -it is impossible
> in principle, a contradiction in terms. For "world" implies whole and science deals with
> part, an identifiable part of the whole that can be shown to be part only — -most of this
> paper will be devoted to this showing. Again, it is crucial to see that this is not a temporary
> limitation but one that is built into science's very nature. To hope for a world view from
> science is like hoping that increasingly detailed maps of Illinois will eventually produce
> the ultimate map of the United States (Huston Smith, Beyond the Post-Modern Mind 109).

[k] Nevertheless, the mystical writings of founders of the new physics66 contain insights that are
vital to the complementarity of the principles of twentieth century science with fundamental
metaphysics. (See sub-propositions [n].-[q]. below.

[l] One of the driving forces of the scientific quest, according to Einstein, is mystical feeling:

His [the scientist's] religious feeling takes the form of a rapturous amazement at the
> harmony of natural law, which reveals an intelligence of such superiority that, compared
> with it, all the systematic thinking and acting of human beings is an utterly insignificant
> reflection. This feeling is the guiding principle of his life and work, in so far as he succeeds
> in keeping himself from the shackles of selfish desire. It is beyond question closely akin to
> that which has possessed the religious geniuses of all ages (Einstein, Ideas and Opinions
> 50).

[m] Einstein's view is complemented by Tillich's that rationalism is the daughter of mysticism:

> Rationalism and mysticism do not stand in contradiction to each other, as is so often
> thought. Both in Greek and modern culture rationalism is the daughter of mysticism.
> Rationalism developed out of the mystical experience of the 'inner light' or the 'inner truth'
> in every human being. Reason emerged within us out of mystical experience, namely, the
> experience of the divine presence within us (History of Christian Thought, [p.]).

[n] The religious outlook of the founders of the new physics might best be described as a mystical
monism of the Mind or Spirit.67 Sir Arthur Eddington writes for example: Similarly, I assert that the
nature of all reality is spiritual, not material, nor a dualism of matter and spirit...[complete]
(Quantum Questions 180).68

[o] Sir Arthur Eddington (The Nature of The Physical World, Science and the Unseen World) and
Erwin Schrödinger (What is Life, Mind and Matter) became the leading philosophical scientists of
the New Physics that emerged between 1900-1930. The main tenet of a group of philosophical
scientists in the 1930s ("The Cambridge Club") that included Sir Arthur Eddington, Sir James Jeans,
Bertrand Russell69 and Alfred North Whitehead was that "The stuff of the world is mind stuff"
(Eddington, The Nature of the Physical World [p.]). In other words, science is not only empirically
tested matter, but depends also on the perceptions of the mind itself: "Mind is the first and most
direct thing in our experience; all else is remote inference."(Eddington, Science and the Unseen
World [p.]). The fact that the mind has some central role in the perceptions of science establishes
clear links between science and a philosophical understanding of mind as a major component of an
ideal or spiritual self.

[p] Erwin Schrödinger who developed the theory of wave mechanics also posited that there is only
one Self or Mind in the universe. This one mind theory is very close to the absolute idealist's one
Absolute Spirit (Mind) and the idealist claim that reality is based in the mind. Schrödinger writes:

> The overall number of minds is just one. I venture to call it indestructible since it has a
> peculiar time-table, namely mind is always now. There is really no before and after
> mind....I also grant, should anyone wish to state it, that I am now talking religion, not
> science — -a religion, however, not opposed to science, but supported by what
> disinterested scientific research has brought to the fore (Mind and Matter, [p.]).70

Schrödinger points to here an eternal quality of mind always existing in the "now".

[q] What the religionist and the scientist have in common consequently is a belief in the Reality of
Spirit that has organised the symbolical forms that the mind constructs out of its experience of the
universe, and their common love for truth and the mystery of being.

[r] Science can best befit religion, and religion best befit science, when these two powerful forces
recognize the integrity of the other's epistemology, and when each seeks to find methods and forms
of experience that complement their common search for, and love of, truth.

Proposition 12: Method in Bahá'í History71

[a] Several present day Bahá'í scholars have rightly advocated that scholars of the Bahá'í Faith
pursue academic scholarship based on the Western tradition of critical analysis of primary source
materials.

[b] The key word in this statement is "critical". One can readily concur with a criticism that looks
for new facts, or seeks to reinterpret events in a new light, a method in short that is open to
correction and revision. In the context of Bahá'í scholarship, however, one may concur with that
sense of "critical" that points to thorough-going research of documents, thought-provoking insight
and in-depth analysis in a spirit of open inquiry.

[c] The word "critical", however, is a double-edged sword and requires closer definition. In the
hands of some scholars, western critical methodology has been used to overthrow the concept of
divine revelation itself and the veracity of scripture which are the very foundations of religion.
Consequently, the word "critical" would have to exclude, in Robert Parry's phrase, "methodological
agnosticism." ("Phenomenology, Methodological Agnosticism and Apologetics" 18).

[d] "Critical" may also refer to reductionist methods that explain Bábí-Bahá'í teachings simply and
strictly in terms of their historical, religious, cultural, or intellectual antecedents, without taking into
account divine intervention, revelation or transcendence.

[e] The Universal House of Justice has notified Bahá'í scholars of certain limitations of modern
academic methods that practice a purported objectivity and intellectual neutrality. It is a
questionable move, however, for Bahá'í scholars to import this method uncritically and holus bolus
into Bahá'í studies. The Universal House of Justice has referred moreover to "a methodological
bias" and "discordant tone" in the work of certain scholars who "in attempting to achieve what they
understand to be academic objectivity" end up by placing themselves in a situation of conflict of
interest: "In other words, we are presented in such articles with the spectacle of Bahá'ís trying to
write as if they were non-Bahá'ís" (The Universal House of Justice, letter of 4 October 1994 to a
National Spiritual Assembly). This irony is underscored in such "critical" and "objective" studies by
the marked presence of the secular perspectives of both humanism and materialism (same).

[f] Humanism denies any divine intervention into human history, which is one of the foundations of
Bahá'í belief, and materialism reduces such realities as religious ideals, values, meanings, virtues,
divine intention and spiritual states of consciousness to mere names without force, or subjective

human tags that are basically disguises of sensate human consciousness. Both views work to the
detriment of transcendent and immanentist views of God and history.

[g] In its more radical sense, "critical" may refer to inimical or hostile treatments of the Bahá'í Faith
that attempt to discredit or overturn Bahá'í teaching.

[h] Deriving from its view of the harmony of religion and science, a Bahá'í methodology of sacred
history should be built upon the tacit or explicit assumptions of the truth of revelation and
considerations of spiritual value, as well as the conclusions of reason, research and purported
statements of fact (Research Department of the Universal House of Justice to First Bahá'í Studies
Seminar on Ethics and Methodology).72

[i] Shoghi Effendi's vision of history was clearly providential, that is the "working out of a divine
purpose" (Harold H. Titus "The Philosophy of History" 460), a view shared by the early Hebrews,
Christians and Muslims. Consequently, any methodology of sacred history that attempts to divorce
theological truths and value judgements from a purely "objective"73 factuality, would necessarily
diminish or distort the subject matter.

[j] Bahá'í history becomes meaningful when it becomes related to our own experience and when we
are able to sympathetically identify with the events of Bahá'í history by becoming part of them. This
sympathetic identification is mediated by analogy, by our ability to relate past events to what we,
individually or collectively, are experiencing in the present.74

[k] All Bahá'í history is not in this sense just historiography. When the events of Bahá'í history are
applied to the theological, existential, moral or psychological dimensions, they also have profound
meaning. The history of Bahá'u'lláh's exile (1853-1892), for example, may be studied or written for
its pure historicity, as the most accurate and complete reconstruction of events the historian is able
to redact. Beyond strict historiography, however, there is a theological meaning and purpose to the
exile; namely, its significance in the present and future expansion and development of the Bahá'í
Faith. `Abdu'l-Bahá has indicated that Bahá'u'lláh's exile has already had an enormous effect in the
wider spread and development of the Bahá'í Faith, and will continue to do so in the future.75 The
exile also demonstrated that Bahá'u'lláh was not only able to repeatedly withstand the stratagems of
his enemies to annihilate both him and his religion, but also that he was able to utilize his
banishment as an instrument for the wider proclamation of his newly revealed faith.76

[l] There are likewise at least three existential, moral or psychological meanings in the exile of
Bahá'u'lláh, viz. in Bahá'í history: (i) the theme of victory in defeat. Future developments are not
always determined by the restricted view of present circumstances. (ii) an instructive pedagogy of
adversity in the development of spirituality (iii) a logotherapy that will assist the individual to find
meaning in suffering and to develop coping mechanisms. For Bahá'u'lláh's exile may become
meaningful or inspirational for those who can identify with him and find meaning and healing in the
midst of adversity, angst, deprivation or loneliness. One can infer from these few applications that
Bahá'í history may interact with psychology in a meaningful dynamic.

[m] Consequently, there should be no antagonism between critical-objective and engaged-

apologetic methods of Bahá'í scholars. These methods should be employed inclusively.

[n] The method of correlation treated in Proposition 7.[a-l] above also suggests a connective
causality between events in a series. Within sacred history, however, not every historical event in
the series is explicable merely in terms of a humanistic or even religio-cultural logic if it is devoid
of transcendence. The events of history in the Bahá'í view are also determined by divine
intervention through periodic, orderly and cyclical visitations accomplished through the divine
mission of the prophets and Divine Manifestations, the founders of the world's great religions,
civilizations and cultures. This view does not exclude at the same time the immanentist or "steady
state" view of God's eternal presence within history.

Proposition 13: Mysticism

[a] Shoghi Effendi states that The Seven Valleys "describes the seven stages which the soul of the
seeker must needs traverse ere it can attain the object of its existence" (God Passes By 140)
(emphasis mine). Scholars could enrich the fabric of theology by validating the Bahá'í perspective
on mysticism,77 that longing to attain the presence of God.

[b] Some may have concluded that when Bahá'u'lláh wrote The Seven Valleys (Haft Vádí) and The
Four Valleys (Cháhár Vádí)78 he was describing unattainable spiritual experiences to which it is
virtually impossible to relate. Although the macro-mystical world of the soul depicted by
Bahá'u'lláh may well lie beyond the spiritual psychology of the norm, it is not so in every case. One
is apt to forget that within the universe Bahá'u'lláh describes, there are numerous micro spiritual
worlds and states with which the reader is already familiar or has already experienced. Otherwise,
an understanding of these mystical writings would lie entirely beyond the imagination of the reader.
Fádil-i-Mázindarání has moreover enumerated mystical writings as one of the nine styles or
categories of writings eluded to by Bahá'u'lláh in his Suriy-i-Haykal (Surih of the Temple), a tablet
revealed in Akká (Taherzadeh, The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh 1:42-43).

[c] For, who has not experienced both the joy and the pain that Bahá'u'lláh describes in The Valley
of Love and The Valley of Contentment: "The steed of this Valley is pain; and if there be no pain
this journey will never end" (The Seven Valleys 8) and "From sorrow he turneth to bliss, from
anguish to joy" (Valleys 29). These alternating human emotions are universal. There are, moreover,
other universal elements in Bahá'u'lláh's sacred narrative of the journey of the soul. These include
the search itself, the tests and difficulties along the way, and the final happy reunification with the
beloved at journey's end.

[d] It would be consequently self-defeating for the seeker to regard the universe of the valleys as
unattainable, ideal transformative spiritual experiences miraculously reserved for the few. In the
preamble to The Seven Valleys Bahá'u'lláh not only affirms, but seems to expect, that the ultimate
Sufí goal of self-evanescence (faná) and seeing God in everything can ultimately be won: "...to the
end...that every man thereby win his way to the summit of realities, until none shall contemplate
anything whatsoever but that he shall see God therein (Valleys, 1-2).79

[e] It would seem consequently that Bahá'u'lláh, in writing The Seven Valleys and The Four Valleys,

was not communicating a purely private experience, but was describing the states that the
spiritualised soul could attain, or at the very least, strive for in the search to become one with the
Creator.80

[f] Further, the fact that Shoghi Effendi included this work in his first canonical list of Bahá'í
writings to be translated into English indicates that the mystical genre is to be regarded as a
categorical imperative of the language of revelation.

[g] Critics dismiss mysticism either as a pseudo form of knowledge, or an intensely personal and
erratic mode of subjective experience inaccessible to intellectual scrutiny. The first objection has
already been debunked by Max Weber:

> The unique character of mystical knowledge consists in the fact that, although it becomes
> more incommunicable the more strongly it is characterized by idiosyncratic content, it is
> nevertheless, recognized as knowledge. For mystical knowledge is not new knowledge of
> any facts or doctrines, but rather the perception of an overall meaning in the world. This
> usage of "knowledge" is intended wherever the terms occurs in the numerous formulations
> of mystics; it denotes a practical form of knowledge. Such gnosis is basically a
> "possession" of something from which there may be derived a new practical orientation to
> the world, and under certain circumstances even new and communicable items of
> knowledge. But even these items will constitute knowledge of values and non-values
> within the world (The Sociology of Religion 169-70).81

[h] The second objection, that the world of mysticism is a closed and private world collapses in the
light of two factors: (i) the universality of divine love (ii) the efficacy of prayer and meditation as
two of the most profound forms of mystical feeling and discovery. As an expression of divine grace,
mysticism reveals a universal and democratic face in one of its predominant modes as the
experience of divine love. If one considers that the experience and the practice of divine love is an
elemental form of mysticism, then all who experience and practice the love of God are mystics,
degrees of love notwithstanding.

[i] This last statement is not mere truism, for its implications are not as obvious as one might first
suppose. Mysticism as the practice of divine love puts the mystical quest on a potentially universal
footing, and opens a gate by which all who practice this universal reality may enter.

[j] Love is an ineffable mystery, and the sense of mystery is one of the driving forces of religion. In
the Bahá'í view, divine love is the sine qua non of finding God:

> O My Brother! Until thou enter the Egypt of love, thou shalt never come to the Joseph of
> the Beauty of the Friend; and until, like Jacob, thou forsake thine outward eyes, thou shalt
> never open the eye of thine inward being; and until thou burn with the fire of love, thou
> shalt never commune with the Lover of Longing (The Seven Valleys 9).

[k] There is, moreover, the closest of connections between mysticism and religious faith for "The

core of religious faith", Shoghi Effendi tells us, "is that mystic feeling which unites man with God."

He states further that this "mystic feeling" is a "state of spiritual communion" that "can be brought
about and maintained by means of meditation and prayer".[reference]

[l] Allied to prayer is meditation which by nature is profoundly mystical for its seeks to bring
hidden mysteries into the divine light of consciousness and understanding.

[m] There are in addition to mysticism, moreover, other forms of experience that are also unusual or
rare, such as those of the poet, the artist, the scientist and the philosopher. These experiences
likewise are not accessible to everyone, but this does not make the work of their practitioners any
less valuable, or less subject to inquiry.

[n] Further, mysticism can only become part of the public domain when such experiences and the
reflections that accompany them, are recorded. Otherwise, they remain unknown, private
experiences from which others cannot benefit through reflection and study. What the nature and
character of mysticism might be in Bahá'í experience can only emerge consequently when the
Bahá'ís who have had such experiences venture to record them, and offer them in a spirit of
collaboration to those scholars who would be in a position to appreciate them further by identifying
their dynamics and characteristic features.

[o] The fact that genuine mystical experiences are relatively rare should not, however, disqualify
mysticism from the scrutiny of the scholar, and it has not done so in other religious traditions.

[p] A mystical worldview can serve, moreover, as one of those great "esoteric" focal points that
unites the great religions,82 and it would be interesting to observe what common characteristics
there might be in the mystical experiences of Bahá'ís and how these compare to those experiences in
other traditions. More significantly, it would be interesting to observe what these experiences might
reveal about the nature of God, the soul or the spiritual life.

[q] Notwithstanding, Shoghi Effendi has signalled certain cautions in regard to mystical
experiences.83 William James has also recorded some reservations in The Varieties of Religious
Experience with regard to the mystic's claims. Although the mystic's supernatural experiences may
confer psychic certitude upon the soul making the mystic "invulnerable" in his/her convictions
(Varieties 324) these rare experiences confer upon the mystic no special authority that would
warrant our uncritical acceptance of such experiences or the adoption of the mystic's personal
lifestyle (Varieties 325). Nevertheless, despite the varieties that mark their subjective experiences,
the unanimous voice with which they speak of the supernatural states of the soul interacting
intimately with its Creator or with other spiritual forces in transcendent worlds, creates in those who
seek to understand and to share in these experiences a willingness to listen to their voice. The
mystics offer to those who have not had the experience, "hypotheses" (Varieties 328) of a divine life
which is more dramatic and real than anything thus far imagined or experienced.

Conclusion

I have discussed the foregoing propositions to argue for a more diversified and
comprehensive view of Bahá'í theology. Such development and diversification are in order, not only
to make Bahá'í theology meaningful to scholars of religion, but also to correlate the insights of the
Bahá'í revelation and the reflections of Bahá'í philosophers and theologians with the views of
contemporary scholars and modern schools of thought and progressive movements. A more
comprehensive view of theology would have consequently profound implications for providing a
unifying vision of humanity's intellectual life, and particularly for "global theology", those
comparative religious studies which are currently at the forefront of a world intellectual and
spiritual movement to foster a consciousness of the oneness of humanity, one that advocates at the
same time the development of a world ethic84 and spirituality in which all of the adherents of the
world's great religions might feel at home.

In a spirit of dialogue, I leave the last word to St. Augustine who said: `And if anyone says,
"I understand your meaning well enough, but it's not true," I ask him to state his own position and
refute mine. If he does this sincerely and without malice and will inform me of his views (if I am
still alive, that is), then I shall count my efforts well rewarded. If he cannot let me know personally,
then I would be delighted if others profit from his views.'85

\[17\] . Although the context of the discussion is music, and particularly the human voice, the text of `Abdu'l-Bahá cited

above clearly indicates a wider application of the aesthetically pleasing than music alone.

\[18\] . The context of the phrase "the beauty of holiness" is contained within `Abdu'l-Bahá's exhortation that colleges

\[36\] . Kerygma is a verbal noun which means "to herald, announce, proclaim". It was used by the apostle Paul to refer

> imprisoned for being a dangerous heretic. The trial led to the Báb's subsequent execution. In the presence of the
> governor, the highest Muslim ecclesiastical dignitaries of the city, and the heir to the Peacock throne, prince
> Násiri'd-Dín Mírzá, the Báb fearlessly proclaimed to the awe-struck assembly: "I am, I am, I am the Promised

> Verily, I say, it is incumbent upon the peoples of both the East and the West to obey My word, and to pledge
> allegiance to My person" (God Passes By 21). The messianic figure of the twelfth imám (Qá'ím) whom the Báb

claimed to be was held in such lofty reverence that all stood up at the mention of his name. This explains the
Báb's reference to "at Whose mention you have risen".

\[41\] . There appears to be the same identity crisis within some circles of the community of Bahá'í scholars surrounding

\[43\] . `Abdu'l-Bahá has prophesied that in time there will be universal opposition to Faith of Bahá'u'lláh: "...How great,

\[52\] . Époché and Éidós were two techniques that formed part of Edmund Husserl's method of phenomenology.

> The application of the phenomenological method to comparative religion lead to a heightened objectivity of

\[58\] . In his discussion of "The Justice and Mercy of God" `Abdu'l-Bahá says: "Now the question of the good or evil of

\[59\] . The quaranic verse "God doeth whatsoever He willeth, and ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth" [reference] is

quoted several times by Bahá'u'lláh in The Kitáb-i-Iqán [Book of Certitude]. See, for example, 97, 170, 243.

\[67\] . Ken Wilber writes in Quantum Questions. Mystical Writings of the World's Great Physicists that in spite of the

> fact that the physicists in his anthology "did not believe that physics and mysticism shared similar
> worldviews"..."they nevertheless all became mystics" (Preface). The profound and thought-provoking essays of
> Prince Louis de Broglie (theory of "matter waves"), Sir Arthur Eddington (theoretical physics of stellar
> systems), Werner Heisenberg (matrix quantum mechanics), Wolfgang Pauli ("exclusion principle", anticipation
> of neutrino), Erwin Schroedinger ("Schroedinger's wave equation"), Sir James Jeans (dynamic theory of gases,
> electromagnetism, the nature of nebulae, etc) all have the purpose of in some way reconciling the rational with
> the mystical. One is further struck by the cogent, terse, insightful philosophic expression of these essays. They
> are written with the acumen and insider experience of great mystical philosophers. "The Cambridge Club" (see

\[68\] . The mystical monist views of the great physicists comes very close to pantheism. God or Spirit is radically

\[69\] . Although David Foster in The Philosophical Scientists includes Bertrand Russell as one of the "1930 Cambridge

Club" (2), as is well-known, Russell categorically dissented from any spiritual interpretation of the universe.

\[70\] . See also Schrödinger's remarkable essay, "The Oneness of Mind" in Ken Wilber, editor, Quantum Questions,

pp.[...]

\[71\] . Proposition 12 in its treatment of Bahá'í history addresses a concern that Bahá'í scholarship may be unknowingly

> drifting toward a too rigid demarcation between the engaged-apologetic approach of Bahá'í philosophers and
> theologians on the one hand, and the critical-objective approach of the sociologist-historians on the other hand.

I argue that both methods must be used inclusively. Apologetic approaches must show evidence of critical

> and existential questions.

\[72\] . Held in Cambridge, England, September 30-October 1, 1978. Also published in Bahá'í News, June 1979.

Proposition [h] reflects the tenor of that statement.

\[73\] . There is a tendency among modern historians to no longer hold to a concept of objectivity in history. According

> to this view, all that historical accounts can aim for is plausibility and consistency. But I am wondering if the
> concept of objectivity in history can be completely jettisoned. It would seem more accurate to speak of
> "tentative objectivity", meaning that until further proof is forthcoming, certain "facts" shall be considered
> objective. Even ideological antagonists can agree on some modicum of historical factuality in the telling of
> events. Shoghi Effendi has moreover recognized the possibility of [objective] factuality when he wrote: "The
> Cause requires scholars versed in various branches of learning who can "interpret the teachings to suit the
> facts". (letter on behalf of Shoghi Effendi in Bahá'í Youth: A Compilation 16) Thanks to Dr. Graham Hassals
> for this quotation.

\[74\] . In this point about the analogy of past events, I have followed somewhat loosely Ernst Troeltsch's (1865-1923)

> view of analogy in history as outlined in his article "Historiography" in Hastings' Encyclopedia of Religion and
> Ethics, 6:716 ff. However, in other respects, Troeltsch's views of history should be contrasted with those of the
> Bahá'í Faith. Troeltsch did not believe in any special interventions by God within history. For Troeltsch there
> were no special or privileged events. Apart from these views, from an orthodox Christian perspective,
> Troeltsch's views were damning for they relativised Christianity, making it only one religion among many,
> shorn of any absolute claims, special status or unique power.

\[75\] . In telling of the story of Abraham, `Abdu'l-Bahá said: "Since the exile of Abraham from Ur of Aleppo in Syria

> produced this result, we must consider what will be the effect of the exile of Bahá'u'lláh in His several removes
> from Tihrán to Baghdád, from thence to Constantinople, to Rumelia and to the Holy Land." Some Answered

> establishment of the belief in the unity of God, the bestowal of the Holy Land as patrimony to the Semites,
> Abraham's prophetic descendants such as Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Muhammad, Christ and the Báb, and the
> influence of the Hebrew Bible on Christian Europe (13). One can only speculate as to the far-reaching effects of
> Bahá'u'lláh's exile.

\[76\] . Some Answered Questions 31.

\[77\] . There are to date regrettably few scholarly articles written by Bahá'ís which explore the phenomenon of

> mysticism. In 1953 Bahá'í physicist Glenn Shook wrote Mysticism, Science and Revelation in straightforward
> language which gives an instructive account of mysticism in Bahá'í perspective. The book, Once to Every Man
> and Nation. Stories About Becoming a Bahá'í, whose half title is taken from James Russell Lowell's (1819-
> 1891) anti-slavery poem of the same name, although its main intent is not to detail individual mystical
> experiences, recounts some by the way. See, for example, Rona M. Freeman's "The Figure in the Red Robe",
> Sally Eiler's "A Spiritual Crown", Violet Dutov Tichenor's "Thrill of Recognition", Thomas Lysaght's "In the
> Clouds of Glory", especially Margot Johnson's "Seasons of the Soul" and Elaine Shevin's "In Desperation", as
> well as Randie Gottlieb's "Mind and Heart". If one adds the dream and prayer as signs of mystical experience,
> other stories apply. Moojan's Momen's "The Psychology of Mysticism and its Relationship to the Bahá'í Faith"
> reflects a certain ambiguity about the topic which looks at mysticism from a medical perspective. (See "The
> Psychology of Mysticism and its Relationship to the Bahá'í Faith", Bahá'í Studies Bulletin 2:4, March 1984, 4-
> 21.) Certainly pathology sometimes masquerades as mysticism, but when one reads the accounts of the mystics

> of 1901 (The Varieties of Religious Experience) as a generally "optimistic" (323) frame of mind in a "religion

of healthy-mindedness" (76-108). Staying within a few examples of the Christian tradition, that religion of
> delight is reflected in St. John of the Cross when he says that the immense desert of the soul is "delicious"
> (313). Saint Teresa speaks of an "unspeakable happiness" (316). Saint Ignatius of "intoxicating consolations"
> (317). The father of Christian mysticism, Dionysius the Areopagite, speaks everywhere in superlatives in his
> cataphatic language of the via negativa. God is super everything. (319) Jacob Boehme writes of the "Primal
> Love" as "that only good" (320). The great contradictions that we sometimes find in the writings of the mystics

> the natural to the supernatural and the reverse, of being wrenched down from the supernal world back to the
> mundane.

\[78\] . The companion volumes The Hidden Words (Kalimát-i-Maknúnih) and the Kitáb-i-Iqán (Book of Certitude) shed

much light on Bahá'u'lláh's mystical works when read conjointly with The Seven Valleys and The Four Valleys.

\[79\] . To "win his way" suggests other spiritual attributes: courage, patience, steadfastness, struggle and endurance.

\[80\] . Becoming "one with the Creator" does not in any sense mean that the soul takes on the essence of divinity or

shares in that divine essence. It refers to an experience of unity without there being identity of essence.

\[81\] . Quoted by Jalil Mahmoudi in "`Irfán, Gnosis, or Mystical Knowledge", World Order, Summer 1973, 10.

\[82\] . Sufi mystic and philosopher of the world religions Frithjof Schuon distinguishes the "esoteric" mystical core of

> the great religions from the "exoteric" outer hull of its diverse cultural expressions, doctrinal formulations,
> dualistic worldviews and claims of exclusivity. Through a deeper penetration of the various guises of myth,
> symbol and metaphor, one can experience an underlying unity of the great religions at the level of the esoteric
> heart. See The Transcendent Unity of Religions 7-60.

\[83\] . The possibility of mystical experience is clearly acknowledged in the Bahá'í Faith, although Shoghi Effendi

> states that true mystical experiences are rare. He indicates that there is a danger in self-generated, presumably
> imaginary mystical experience, brought on more likely than not by the inordinate desire to have one. According
> to Shoghi Effendi, God rather than self, would be the author of the "deeply spiritual experience". (Lights of

> however, that dreams are more or less conditioned by both the preoccupations and the purity of the mind of the
> dreamer. (Lights of Guidance, no. 1051) Regarding visions, Shoghi Effendi maintained that visions were not
> confined to the prophets alone, but that is difficult to distinguish between imaginations and true visions.
> However, the possibility of the true vision is clearly acknowledged for pure and receptive souls (ibid, no. 1052).
