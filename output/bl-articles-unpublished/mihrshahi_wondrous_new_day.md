PREFACE1

Ever since the beginning of recorded history human beings have
devised and used calendars that have helped them to understand and
compute time and to organize and structure their lives more
efficiently. Most religious communities have their own calendars,
which are used to celebrate or commemorate important events that are
commonly associated with the founders of their religion. These
calendars often begin with the inception of their faith or another
episode of similar significance.2 Most calendars are based upon three
cycles that are readily observable in nature: the day, the lunar month
and the solar year.3 Some calendars, however, deviate from these
cycles. The Islamic calendar, for example, does not make use of the
solar year, while the Mayans of Central America used months that
were only twenty days long and thus not synchronized with the phases
of the moon.4

The Bahá’í Faith also has its own calendar, called the Badí‘ (new,
wondrous) calendar that was devised by the Twin Founding Figures of
this religion: the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh.5 The Badí‘ calendar, however,
is not simply a system that is used to calculate time or commemorate
important      events   associated    with    the   Central   Figures

of the Bahá’í Faith. Having been principally created by the Báb but
later completed by Bahá’u’lláh, this calendar expresses symbolically a
number of concepts that were central to the Báb’s perception of the
nature of being and the universal laws underlying all of creation.
Furthermore, it can also be seen to contain some allusions to the
relationship between the two religious systems created by these Twin
Manifestations.

The present work aims to explore but some of this symbolism
contained in the Badí‘ calendar.6 In doing so, it will examine some of
the Shaykhí origins of the Báb’s cosmology and ontology, investigate
how these Shaykhí concepts are developed in the Báb’s Writings and
finally explore how they find symbolic expression in the structure and
organization of the Badí‘ calendar. Before commencing with this
effort it should be noted, however, that all interpretations of passages
from the Bábí and Bahá’í Writings offered here are either my own or
those of the authors they are attributed to in the text and thus do not in
any way represent official Bahá’í doctrine.7

\[7\] I am very much indebted to Vahid J. Brown for offering his comments on various
drafts of parts of this monograph and for supplying me with information and materials
from which it has greatly benefited. The remarks and suggestion offered by Javid
Atai, Borhan Borhani, Grover Gonzales, Gerald Keil, David Levick and Bijan Samali
have, likewise, been very valuable.

I. SHAYKHÍ ORIGINS

Before converting to the Bábí Faith, most of the early believers
including the Báb’s childhood teacher Shaykh ‘Ábid and many of the
Báb’s family members had been Shaykhís, i.e. followers of Shaykh
Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í and Siyyid Káẓim-i-Rashtí. The Báb Himself had
also attended some of Rashtí’s classes in Karbilá and had referred to
him as “My teacher” in some of His early writings.8 For this reason,
the Báb predictably made frequent use of Shaykhí terminology and
theories in His writings. Insofar as it is constructed upon and around a
number of metaphysical and cosmological Shaykhí concepts, the
Badí‘ calendar constitutes no exception to this rule. A brief summary
of some of these concepts will therefore be necessary for a better
understanding of the origin and symbolic significance of various
aspects of this calendar.

According to Shaykh Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í, the founder of the Shaykhí
Order, the whole of creation is constituted by divine letters.9 Each of
the twenty-eight letters of the Arabic alphabet corresponds to a divine
name or attribute as well as a metaphysical plane or level of existence.
In this schema the first letter, Alif, for example, corresponds to the
divine name al-Badí‘ (wondrous, new, first, beginning) and to the
metaphysical plane of the Universal Intellect, which is the first
emanation from the Divine Will. This Universal Intellect is also called
‘the One’ (Váḥid).

According to the so-called abjad system, each letter of the Arabic
alphabet has a specified numerical value.10 The numerical value of the
first letter, Alif, for example, is one, and that of the word Váḥid

\[10\] For an overview of the abjad system, see Lewis, Abjad.
4                      A WONDROUS NEW DAY
(which bears the meaning of one) is nineteen. For this reason, God is
said to have uttered nineteen letters on the plane of the Universal
Intellect, thereby creating the lower nineteen levels of existence: the
nine spheres (of planets), the four elements (fire, air, water, earth), the
three kingdoms of nature (mineral, plant and animal kingdom), as well
as man, jínn (invisible beings, genies) and angels. These nineteen
letters form the invocation ‘Bismi’lláhi’r-Raḥmáni’r-Raḥím’11 (In the
Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful) which precedes all
chapters of the Qur’án with the exception of the ninth.12

Attributing even more importance to the number nineteen, Rashtí,
furthermore, states that although the Arabic alphabet has twenty-eight
letters, in reality there are only nineteen.13 This is because some letters
(e.g. the letters Bá’, Tá’ and Thá’) are essentially the same and only
distinguished from one another by one or more dots placed above or
underneath them. He supports this statement with a saying attributed
to Muḥammad which reads “the letters are nineteen”14. For Rashtí, the
number nineteen, therefore, constitutes a universal principle, which
governs and underlies the whole of creation. This universal law of
nineteen is expressed in and signified by the Basmalah, a formula that
is said to sum up and contain all levels of contingent being.15

The Basmalah occupies a central position in Islamic theology. It is
regarded as a prayer in its own right and a source of divine knowledge
and healing. It is said to have been designated ‘the greatest verse in
the Book of God’ by Imám Ja’far-i-Ṣádiq, the sixth Imám of Shí’ah
Islám, and has been described by Rashtí as being closer to the
‘Greatest Name of God’ than the pupil of the eye is to the white.16
This Greatest Name of God is believed to be a hidden and

\[11\] Hereafter, and in accordance with common practice, this formula will be referred to
as the Basmalah.

mathematically based upon the number nineteen (see, for example, Khalifa,
Computer). This notion has, however, been rejected by most other Muslim scholars.

unpronounced name that sums up being in its entirety, thus making it
even more all-embracing than the Basmalah, a formula which only
contains and manifests the different levels of contingent being.17
According to Shí’ah traditions, the knowledge of this Name is with the
hidden twelfth Imám and will be revealed by him when he returns.18

According to Imám ‘Alí-ibn-i-Abí-Ṭálib, the first Imám of Shí’ah
Islám, the Basmalah itself and thereby the entire contingent world is,
furthermore, condensed in its first letter Bá’: “All that is in the world
is in the Qur’án, and all that is in the Qur’án is condensed in the
Fátiḥa [first chapter] of the Book, and all that is in the Fátiḥa is in the
Basmalah, and all that is in the Basmalah is in the Bá’ and I am the
point under the Bá’.”19 The “point under the Bá’” is what
differentiates this letter from other letters of similar shape and is thus
its essence and distinguishing feature. For this reason, it was also
called ‘Furqán’ (distinguisher) by the Báb. The tile ‘Furqán’
traditionally denotes the Qur’án as the book that distinguishes between
believers and unbelievers, but was also applied by the Báb to His own
writings, especially His first major work the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’.20
Because all letters are potentially contained within it, this point
signifies the Divine Unity and Simplicity21 and the Universal Will of
God,22 which is the origin of all created things.23 The Bá’ without its
dot is, therefore, nothing more than a cloak, shell or exterior for the
point.24

\[17\] Cole, “Cosmologies”. Bahá’u’lláh claims that the name ‘Bahá’’ (glory, splendour)
which He chose for Himself is this Most Great Name of God. The Báb also placed
great emphasis on the name Bahá’ and even instructed His amanuensis to write this
name in red ink when preparing manuscript copies of some of His writings while all
other words were to be written in black (Faizi, Explanation)

“Knowledge is one point, which the foolish have multiplied”.

\[24\] Lawson “Reading”.

II. THE BÁB’S CONCEPT OF ‘ALL THINGS’

The Báb used and expanded these Shaykhí concepts shaping them into
a new system, which He made the underlying structure of His
Dispensation. After having declared Himself to his first follower,
Mullá Ḥusayn-i-Bushrú’í, on the night corresponding to the Gregorian
calendar date of the 22nd of May 1844, He instructed the latter not to
divulge His claim to anyone until another seventeen individuals had
“spontaneously and out of their own accord” accepted Him and
recognized the truth of His Revelation.25 These eighteen first disciples
He called ‘Letters of the Living’ (Ḥurúf-i-Ḥayy).26 Together with the
Báb Himself they formed the first Váḥid (unit, unity, one), i.e. unit of
nineteen, of the Bábí Dispensation. Each one of them was regarded as
the incarnation of one of the nineteen letters of the Basmalah. The Báb
Himself was the manifestation of the first letter Bá’, Mullá Ḥusayn
represented the second letter Sín, and so on.27

The Báb, furthermore, did not only identify Himself with the Bá’ of
the Basmalah but also more specifically with the point under this
letter. This is evident from titles such as ‘the Primal Point’ (Nuqṭiy-i-
Úla) or the ‘Point of the Bayán’ (Nuqṭiy-i-Bayán), which He chose for
Himself.28 It is conceivable, in this context that the Báb may have used
the term ‘Point’ to refer to Himself as the locus of Divine

\[25\] Nabíl, Dawn-Breakers 63.

\[26\] The Báb used the term ‘letters’ to refer to the followers of various religions. Al-
Ḥayy (the Living) is one of the names of God and was also used by the Báb in
reference to His own Person. The title Letters of the Living could therefore be
interpreted on a more literal level as simply meaning ‘followers of the Báb’. The
numerical value of the word ‘ḥayy’ is eighteen thus specifying the number of letters.
This is the reason why Shoghi Effendi translated Ḥurúf-i-Ḥayy as the ‘eighteen
Letters of the Living’.

\[27\] Amanat, Resurrection 175.

\[28\] Lawson, “Reading”.

Revelation, the source of all knowledge and the manifestation of the
Universal Will, while alluding to His physical being (i.e. the carrier of
this Revelation) when identifying Himself as the letter Bá’, which is
the outer shell or cloak of that point.

A very similar interpretation of the Basmalah is also given by the Báb
in the context of the Islamic Dispensation. Here the first letter Bá’
signifies the ‘Point of the Qur’án’, the second letter Sín is manifested
in the person of the Prophet Muḥammad and the remaining seventeen
letters stand for Muḥammad’s daughter Fáṭimih, the twelve Imáms of
Shí’ah Islám and the four emissaries or abváb (sing. báb) of the hidden
twelfth Imám. Together, these nineteen constitute the primary Váḥid
of the Islamic Dispensation. The reason why the Báb distinguishes in
this schema between the Point of the Qur’án and the Prophet
Muḥammad is that in Islamic thought only the text of the Qur’án is
regarded as the authentic word of God, while the Prophet’s other
utterances are not necessarily considered a product of direct Divine
Revelation.29

Being the incarnations of the same letters of the Basmalah, the Báb
and the eighteen Letters of the Living are considered the separate
returns of the members of this primary Váḥid of the Islamic
Dispensation. The Báb is, therefore, the return of the Point of the
Qur’án in the form of the Point of the Bayán, Mullá Husayn is the
reappearance of Muḥammad, and so on.30 A significant difference in
this schema is that the Báb makes no distinction here between His
own Person and the Point of the Bayán. This is because the Báb
claims that in His case Divine Revelation is continuous and that,
therefore, all His writings and utterances are the word of God.31 The
Person of the Báb is thus identical with His Revelation, which He
collectively refers to as the Bayán (utterance, exposition), while the
Prophet Muḥammad is not always synonymous with the Qur’án.

\[29\] Saiedi, Logos 296 f.

\[30\] This was the Báb’s way of fulfilling common Shí’ah expectations relating to the
return (raj’a) of the hidden twelfth Imám (the Mahdí) with a certain number of his
supporters immediately before the end of the world and the day of Resurrection. For
an explanation of these apocalyptic Shí’ah expectations see Amanat, Resurrection.

II. THE BÁB’S CONCEPT OF ‘ALL THINGS’                                    9

After the first Váḥid of the Bábí Dispensation had been formed, the
Báb instructed the Letters of the Living to disperse and spread the
news of His Revelation. The name of every new believer they enrolled
was to be recorded and forwarded to Him. “I shall classify these
lists,” He explained to them, “into eighteen sets of nineteen names
each. Each set will constitute one Váḥid. All these names, in these
eighteen sets, will, together with the first Váḥid, consisting of My own
name and those of the eighteen Letters of the Living, constitute the
number of Kull-i-Shay’.”32 The term ‘Kull-i-Shay’’ literally means
‘All Things’ and its numerical value is 361 (19 x 19). In this way, the
Báb thus intended to materialize on earth what was an essentially
metaphysical concept of Him as the “Primal Point from which have
been generated all created things”.33

Being basically an extended version of the Shaykhí theory of
‘nineteen’, this concept of ‘All Things’ (Kull-i-Shay’) constitutes for
the Báb a divine and universal principle underlying the whole of
creation. Both, the Persian and Arabic Bayán, as well as many of the
Báb’s later writings were, therefore, also structured according to this
formula, each consisting of nineteen Váḥids of nineteen chapters or
gates (abváb).34 The Báb thus states in the beginning of the Persian
Bayán that God has structured the creation of all things according to
the number of ‘All Things’, and that the chapters of the religion of the
Bayán have, therefore, also been arranged according to the number of
‘All Things’.35

1\. Kull-i-Shay’ and the Computation of Time

\[32\] Nabíl, Dawn-Breakers 123.

\[33\] The Báb, Selections 12.

\[34\] The Persian as well as the Arabic Bayán, however, were left unfinished by the Báb
and thus end in the middle of the ninth and after the eleventh Váḥid respectively. The
Báb left the completion of these works up to ‘Him Whom God shall make manifest’
(Man-Yuẓhiruhu’lláh), the promised future Manifestation repeatedly mentioned in the
Báb’s writings. Bahá’ís believe that Bahá’u’lláh is this Promised One and that His
Kitáb-i-Íqán constitutes the completion of the Báb’s Bayáns (Saiedi, Logos 126 ff)

\[35\] Browne, Selections 316.

The universal principle of ‘All Things’ does not only occupy a central
position in the Báb’s cosmology and ontology but is also used by Him
in the computation of time. The Báb thus grouped the years following
His Revelation into cycles of nineteen years, each of which He again
called a Váḥid. The first nineteen Váḥids, i.e. 361 years, constitute the
first Kull-i-Shay’ of the Bábí/Bahá’í Era. The nineteen years that
make up one Váḥid were given names whose numerical value is
identical with their position within the Váḥid. The first year of each
Váḥid is thus named ‘Alif’, which is the first letter of the Arabic
alphabet and has a numerical value of one. The names of the nineteen
years of each Váḥid are as follows:36

> 1   Alif (The letter ‘A’)             11      Bahháj (Delightful)
> 2   Bá’ (The letter ‘B’)              12      Javáb (Answer)
> 3   Ab (Father)                       13      Aḥad (Single)
> 4   Dál (The letter ‘D’)              14      Vahháb (Bountiful)
> 5   Báb (Gate)                        15      Vidád (Affection)
> 6   Váv (The letter ‘V’)              16      Badí‘ (Beginning)
> 7   Abad (Eternity)                   17      Bahí (Luminous)
> 8   Jád (Generosity)                  18      Abhá37 (Most Luminous)
> 9   Bahá’ (Splendour)                 19      Váḥid (Unity)
10   Ḥubb (Love)

In His writings, the Báb put special emphasis on the years nine
(Bahá’) and nineteen (Váḥid) and linked them to the coming of ‘Him
Whom God shall make manifest’. Shoghi Effendi summarizes some of
these references as follows:

\[36\] See Walbridge, Sacred 187. It is of interest to note that these Váḥids are also of
some astrological significance, as a period of nineteen years marks the common
multiple of the orbital periods of the earth and the moon. In other words, it takes
nineteen years for the phases of the moon to fall again on the same days of the solar
year. These cycles of nineteen years are called Metonic cycles after their discoverer
Meton of Athens (fl. 432 BC).

\[37\] The final Alif Maqsúra of the word Abhá is given the numerical value of the
usually orthographically indistinguishable letter Yá’ (10) instead of that of the letter
Alif (1) here, which gives this word a numerical value of eighteen. This name could
thus also be read as Abhí.

II. THE BÁB’S CONCEPT OF ‘ALL THINGS’                                   11

> “In the year nine,” He, referring to the date of the advent of the
> promised Revelation, has explicitly written, “ye shall attain unto all
> good.” “In the year nine, ye will attain unto the presence of God.” And
> again: “After Ḥín (68)38 a Cause shall be given unto you which ye shall
> come to know.” “Ere nine will have elapsed from the inception of this
> Cause,” He more particularly has stated, “the realities of the created
> things will not be made manifest.” […] “Wait thou,” is His statement to
> Azím, “until nine will have elapsed from the time of the Bayán. Then
> exclaim: 'Blessed, therefore, be God, the most excellent of Makers!'”
> “Be attentive,” He, referring in a remarkable passage to the year
> nineteen, has admonished, “from the inception of the Revelation till the
> number of Váḥid (19).” “The Lord of the Day of Reckoning,” He, even
> more explicitly, has stated, “will be manifested at the end of Váḥid (19)
> and the beginning of eighty (1280 A.H.).”39

The year nine of the Bahá’í Era (1852-53 A.D.), i.e. the year of Bahá’,
is the year in which Bahá’u’lláh, Whom Bahá’ís believe to be the
Object of these prophesies, according to His own testimony received
His Divine Revelation while lying in chains in an underground
dungeon in Tihrán. Another interesting reference to this year can be
found in the Báb’s Arabic Bayán 6:15: "Ye should all rise up in
respect upon hearing the mention of 'Him Whom God shall make
manifest’, and ye should watch the difference between the Qá'im and
the Qayyúm, for in the Year Nine ye shall attain unto all good."40

The Qá’im (‘He Who arises’), whom the Báb identified with His own
Person, is the awaited Mihdí or return of the twelfth Imám of Shí’ah
Islám. Bahá’ís believe that the term Qayyúm (superlative of Qá’im
and often translated as ‘the Self-Subsisting’ by Shoghi Effendi) which
is used as an attribute of God in the Qur’án is a reference to
Bahá’u’lláh.41 In an interpretation of this phrase from the Arabic

\[38\] This is a reference to the year 1268 A.H. (1851-52 A.D.), which is the year eight of
the Bahá’í Era. “After Ḥín” therefore refers to the year nine after the Declaration of
the Báb.

Bahá’í translation list Tarjuman (http://listserv.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=tarjuman-
list), 2 December 2003. Reproduced here in an amended version with permission of
the translator.

\[41\] see, for example, Nabíl Dawn-Breakers 42n
Bayán, Bahá’u’lláh explains that the difference in numerical value
between these two terms is nine (Bahá’). He arrives at this value by
giving the hamzih in the word Qá’im the numerical value of six
(instead of the usual value of one) due to its orthographical similarity
to the equivalent Persian numeral.42

The first Váḥid after the Báb’s Declaration alluded to in the
Guardian’s above assemblage of quotations ended in March 1863, and
the year 1280 A.H. began in June of the same year. Bahá’u’lláh’s
Declaration to His followers assembled in the Garden of Najíb Páshá,
which was later designated by Him as the Garden of Riḍván, took
place on the 22nd of April 1863 and, therefore, fell exactly between
these two dates mentioned by the Báb.

2\. ‘All Things’ and the Badí‘ Calendar

The principle of Kull-i-Shay’ that governs the flow of time on the
macrocosmic level of years, decades and centuries also regulates the
microcosm of days and months within each year. The new calendar
devised by the Báb thus consists of nineteen months of nineteen days
each, thereby forming one Kull-i-Shay’ within each year.43 To
constitute a whole solar year, however, four to five intercalary days
needed to be added to these nineteen months. The Báb Himself did not
specify where within the year these intercalary days should be placed
and, in this way, rendered His calendar practically unusable until the
coming of Him Whom God shall make manifest, Who was the only
One with the authority to complete the Báb’s design. This Promised
One of the Báb was to complete the Badí‘ calendar in a similar way as
He was expected to conclude the Persian and Arabic Bayán. With
omissions of this kind, the Báb apparently aimed to demonstrate that
His own Revelation and that of Him Whom God shall make manifest

\[42\] See, Bahá’u’lláh, Iqtidárát 65. I am indebted to Khazeh Fananapazir for bringing
this reference to my attention.

\[43\] The Badí‘ calendar therefore displays a strong element of fractality with the number
nineteen being the organizing component on all levels of computation.

are essentially one and the same and cannot be separated from each
other.44

The name of the Báb’s new calendar is also of symbolic significance.
As mentioned above, the Arabic word Badí‘ can be variously
translated as ‘first’, ‘beginning’, ‘new’, ‘wondrous’, etc.45 and thus
connotes the act of divine creation.46 We have also seen that in
Shaykhí cosmology al-Badí‘ stands for the Universal Intellect which
in turn is often referred to as the One (Váḥid). The terms Váḥid and
Badí‘ are therefore somewhat interchangeable and both signify the
Universal Intellect which is the first emanation from the Divine Will.
This Divine Will is in turn manifested in the Person of the Báb, Who
is the Primal Point from which all things (Kull-i-Shay’), including the
‘All Things’ of the Badí‘ calendar, have been generated.

The nineteen Bahá’í months are all named after attributes or names of
God which are derived from the dawn prayer that Shí’ah Muslims
recite during the month of the fast (Ramadán). This prayer is
attributed to either the fifth (Muḥammad-Báqir) or sixth (Ja’far-i-
Ṣádiq) Imám of Shí’ah Islam. The opening words of this prayer read:
“O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Bahá’ (Splendor) at its most
Splendid (abhá’) for all Thy Splendor (bahá’) is truly resplendent
(bahí). I, verily, O my God, beseech Thee by the fullness of Thy
Splendor (bahá’).”47

\[44\] Saiedi, Logos 127 f.

\[45\] The Arabic root of the word Badí‘ is Bá’-Dál-‘Ayn (B-D-‘) meaning (he) created,
invented, contrived, introduced, said something new, did something for the first time,
excelled, etc.

\[46\] Walbridge, Sacred 193.This is probably why Bahá’u’lláh gave the name Badí‘ to
Áqá Buzurg-i-Khurásání, the youth who delivered His letter to Násiri’d-Dín Sháh.
Bahá’u’lláh states that He had created Badí’ anew in order to fulfill this mission and
had sent him out as a ball of fire (Taherzadeh, Revelation 179). Furthermore,
Bahá’u’lláh also used the adjective Badí‘ to describe both His ‘wondrous Cause’
(Amr-i-Badí‘) and His ‘New World Order’ (Naẓm-i-Badí‘).

have said that the Most Great Name is found in this prayer (Faizi, Explanation). For a

Being a solar calendar with months named after divine attributes, the
Badí‘ calendar is much more similar to the Zoroastrian calendar,
which has twelve months bearing the names of angels, than to the
lunar calendar of Islám. Muḥammad had explicitly forbidden the
Arabian practice of intercalation that served to keep the lunar calendar

\[48\] The dates given for the beginning and end of each month here are reflective of
current Bahá’í practice. According to Bahá’u’lláh, Naw-Rúz is to be celebrated on the
day of the vernal equinox, which does not always fall on the 21st of March. This
means that the beginning and end of each month does not always fall on the same
Gregorian calendar date. Pending further clarification by the Universal House of
Justice, which would have to involve the choice of a particular spot that can serve as
the standard for the fixing of the time of the vernal equinox, however, western Bahá’í
communities always celebrate Naw-Rúz on the 21st of March (See Bahá'u'lláh, Aqdas
177).

of twelve months in accordance with the solar year. This is why the
Islamic year only consists of 354 or 355 days. By re-introducing
intercalary days into His calendar the Báb, therefore, asserted the
independence of His Revelation from that of Muḥammad.

The Badí’ calendar also contains a seven-day week like that of
Judaism, Christianity and Islám. Following Persian custom this Bahá’í
week starts on Saturday, with Friday being the day of rest50. Each day
of the week is again named after a divine attribute, the first three of
which are identical to the names of the second, third and eighth month
respectively, while the remaining four names are unique. The names
of the days of the week are: 51

1        Saturday: Jalál (Glory)
2        Sunday: Jamál (Beauty)
3        Monday: Kamál (Perfection)
4        Tuesday: Fiḍál (Grace)
5        Wednesday: ‘Idál (Justice)
6        Thursday: Istijlál (Majesty)
7        Friday: Istiqlál (Independence)

Similar to Christian liturgical as well as Islamic and Judaic practice,
the day of the Bábí/Bahá’í day starts at sunset.

\[50\] The Islamic week does not have a designated day of rest, but Friday is the day when
Muslims perform their congregational prayer (Walbridge, Sacred 177).

III. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SEVEN-DAY

WEEK

The use of the seven-day week finds its origin in the Old Testament’s
Book of Genesis, where God is said to have created the world in six
days, after which He rested on the seventh.

These seven days of creation mentioned in the Bible and also in the
Qur’án are linked by Bahá’u’lláh to the appearance of cycles of
Divine Manifestations. In an interpretation of the Qur’ánic version of
this account of creation52 He thus states that the coming of the Báb
signified the rolling up like a scroll of the ‘heavens’ of the religions
‘raised in the Qur’án’.53 According to Shí’ah Islám, the number of
‘prophets endowed with constancy’ that were sent down to earth by
God is six: Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muḥammad.54
This cycle of six Divine Messengers is signified for Bahá’u’lláh by
the first six days of creation. The Báb is, therefore, the seventh
Manifestation of God and above and beyond that also the completion
of the entire six-thousand year long cycle of Divine Revelation that
started with Adam.55

This same principle of religious cycles is also signified for the Báb
and Bahá’u’lláh by the letter Váv of the Arabic alphabet, a letter on
which Shaykh Aḥmad had placed great emphasis.56 If spelled out this
letter is written as Váv-Alif-Váv (V-A-V). Having a numerical value
of six, the first one of these two Vávs symbolizes for the Báb and

\[52\] See for example Qur’án 50:38; cf. 7:54; 10:3; 11:7; 25:59; 32:4; 57:4

\[53\] MacEoin, Rituals 148.

\[54\] Ibid.

\[55\] This schema only includes the major religions accepted by Shí’ah Islám and,
therefore, does not take into account figures such as Krishna, Buddha and Zoroaster,
which are also regarded as Divine Manifestations in the Bahá’í Writings.

\[56\] Bahá’u’lláh, Aqdas 240.

Bahá’u’lláh the six Manifestations that appeared before the Báb. The
Báb Himself is signified by the second letter, the ‘Upright Alif’ (al-
Alifu’l-Qá’imat), while Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation, being as potent as
those of the first six Manifestations together, is referred to by the
second Váv.57 This is why Bahá’u’lláh states in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas:
“Well is it with him whom God hath aided to recognize the ‘Six’
[Bahá’u’lláh] raised up by virtue of this ‘Upright Alif” [the Báb]’.58

The seven days of creation, and by implication possibly also the seven
days of the week, are thus a symbol for the religious cycle begun by
Adam and completed by the Báb.

Some additional clues relating to the significance of the number seven
can be found in one of the Báb’s Tablets in which He gives
instructions on how to construct a circular talisman called Dá’ira59.
This Dá’ira consists of seven concentric circles which are each
divided into nineteen sections. These sections contain various signs,
letters and words many of which are derived from the Basmalah. In
the centre of these circles, a square consisting of seven by seven
compartments or ‘houses’ (bayt) is located.60 As it is thus constructed
upon basically the same elements as the Badí‘ calendar, a study of the
Báb’s Dá’ira might also shed some light on the significance of various
aspects of this calendar itself.

In His instructions on how to construct such a talisman the Báb states:

> … and the seven circles are together the light of the Night of Decree, for
> the geometry of the shape of the Decree is this: 304; and when you put
> the two of them [i.e. the 3 and 4] together, there appears the number
> seven. What is written there is what has been decreed here. And these
> are the gates of all good … for the seven letters have been sent down in

> the four words and when you join it there appears the number of the
> word huva [“he” = 11 = 7+4], for that is the mention of the Seal of the
> Point from the beginning of its mystery in the letters of the Basmalah
> until the end of its descent unto its centre, which is the Point itself ….61

The ‘Night of Decree’ (Laylatu’l-Qadr) is the night in which,
according to the Qur’án, Muḥammad received His Divine Revelation
from the angel Gabriel. As indicated in the above quotation, the
numerical value of the word Qadr is 304, the cross total of which is
seven. For this reason, the Báb states that the light of this Night is
represented by the seven circles of His talisman. The ‘seven letters’
are probably a reference to the Báb Himself, Whose name ‘Alí
Muḥammad consist of seven Arabic letters, while the ‘four words’
might signify the words of the Basmalah, which are four in number.
Referring to the four words and nineteen letters of this phrase, the Báb
has, therefore, stated that the entire structure of the Qur’án and of the
Islamic Dispensation is based upon the identity of four and nineteen.62

The Báb’s assertion that “the seven letters have been sent down in the
four words” might thus imply that He (the ‘seven letters’) has
revealed Himself (been sent down) through the four words of the
Basmalah. This interpretation appears reasonable if we consider that
the structure of the Basmalah also constitutes the underlying principle
and order of His Own Revelation and Dispensation.

The ultimate origin of both, the Báb and His Revelation, is God or the
‘Seal of the Point’. Being the creator of the numbers seven
(representing the Báb) as well as four (ostensibly symbolising the
Báb’s Revelation through the structure of the Basmalah) God is thus
signified by the number eleven, which is the grand total of both of
these numbers and the numerical value of the word Huva (He). As
implied by the above quotation, this number thus descends from God
in the form of four and seven until it reaches the Point, which signifies
the Báb as the Revealer of Divine Verses and the Origin of all things.

\[61\] Adapted from MacEoin, Rituals 104.

\[62\] Saiedi, Logos 295.

Being a reference to both the Divine Decree as sent down upon the
Manifestations of God and the Person of the Báb Himself, the number
seven might, therefore, signify these Manifestations in their role as the
recipients of the Divine Decree or Revelation. In this context it is,
moreover, of interest to note that the title Bahá’u’lláh as well as the
Latter’s birth name Ḥusayn ‘Ali both also have seven Arabic letters.63

Reiterating a Shí’ah concept, the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, furthermore,
assert that “the completion of every existence [is] realized through the
seven stages of Will (Mashíyyat), Purpose (Irádih), Predestination
(Qadar), Fate (Qaḍá’), Permission (Idhn), Fixed time (Ajal), and the
Book (Kitáb)”.64 In this schema we can thus discern another indication
of the significance of the number seven in the process of Divine
Revelation. It seems to be through these seven stages that God’s Will
is communicated to the Divine Manifestation in order to be finally
revealed to mankind in the form of ‘the Book’.65

In such a numerical representation of the act of Divine Revelation,
God Himself is thus represented by the number eleven (Huva), while
the process of the communication of the Divine Will to the Person of
the Manifestation of God and the Latter’s role as the recipient of this
Revelation appear to be symbolized by the number seven. In His
function as the source of revelation in the human world, however, the
Divine Manifestation is, as explained above, signified by the number
one. This number is in turn represented by the Point from which all
things are created through the structure of Váḥids (19) and Kull-i-
Shay’s (361).

\[63\] This is the reason why ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states in one of His Tablets that “the seven
spirits and the seven stars mentioned in the Apocalypse refer to the seven letters of the
alphabet which constitute the Most Great Name”. (From a letter on behalf of the
Universal House of Justice to an individual believe, dated 7 August 1978)

III. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SEVEN-DAY WEEK                              21

While the number nineteen, through the principle of Kull-i-Shay’, thus
governs the process of the Báb’s (as well as Muḥammad’s) Revelation
to humanity, the number seven appears to play a significant role in the
process of the communication of Divine Revelation to the
Manifestations of God. Together, the two principles of seven and
nineteen might, therefore, describe the entire process of Divine
Revelation, which could be another reason why both of these numbers
feature so prominently in the Báb’s Dá’ira as well as the Badí‘
calendar.

Another indication of the significance of the number seven can be
found in the Báb’s interpretation of the seven verses of the Fátiḥa. In a
schema similar to that of the association of the primary Váḥid of both,
the Islamic and the Bábí Dispensations with the nineteen letters of the
Basmalah, the seven verses of this Súrih are linked by Him to the
‘Fourteen Pure’ or ‘Infallible Ones’ (Ma’ṣumún) of Shí’ah Islám:
Muḥammad, Fáṭimih and the twelve Imáms. This association works
for the Báb because these fourteen figures only have seven different
names, as four of them are called Muḥammad, four ‘Alí and two
Ḥasan, while the remaining four (Fáṭimih, Ḥusayn, Ja'far-i-Ṣádiq and
Músá-Káẓim) have unique names.66 Through this pattern of
association the Báb offers a novel interpretation of one of the more
common names of the Qur’án’s opening chapter, namely ‘the seven
oft repeated’ or ‘the seven doubled’ (as-Sab‘u’l-Mathání).67 Linking
this pattern back to the process of creation He thus also states that one
of the results of this process is that seven becomes fourteen.68

Considering that the Báb also associated the seven days of the week
with these fourteen Ma’ṣumún in several of His writings,69 the Holy
Family of Islám, which in Shaykhí thought symbolically represents
the Divine Will,70 therefore, forms a link between the seven days of
the Bahá’í week and the first Súrih of the Qur’án. As shown in the
quotation from Imám ‘Alí cited above, this opening chapter in turn

“contains, in potentia, all creation”.71 Such a pattern of association
would thus, in several ways, be similar to that of the correlation
between the Primary Váḥids of the Islamic and Bábí Dispensations
with the days of the months and the months of the year as well as the
letters of the Basmalah.

Finally, the number seven also plays a central role in various other
hierarchies described in the writings of the Báb. Some of these
heptads include, for example, the concept of seven spiritual grades or
levels (marátib) each occupied by a different people (ahl), seven hells
each being the shadow of a paradise (plus the eighth paradise of ‘the
Absolute’ which has no infernal counterpart), seven classes of people,
seven grades of lordship (rubúbíyat), as well as seven heavens and
seven earths.72

In concluding this discussion of the significance of the number seven
in the Báb’s writings it will be of interest to note that, while the ‘law
of nineteen’ features especially prominently in His later works, the
principles of seven and fourteen, which appear to be mainly based on
the Báb’s interpretation of ‘the seven oft repeated’ (as-Sab‘u’l-
Mathání), are mostly of importance in His earlier texts. Many of the
abovementioned heptadic structures were, indeed, introduced in a
work titled Tafsír Súratu’l-Baqara (Commentary on the Súrih of the
Cow) which even predates the Báb’s Declaration to Mullá Ḥusayn in
1844\.73 A number of the early writings of the Báb that were revealed
after his Declaration are, furthermore, based on a fourteen-fold
structure, and in His Khuṭbih-i-Dhikriyyih (Sermon of
Remembrance), He does not only confirm this fact but also dedicates
His first fourteen works to the fourteen Ma’ṣumún.74

One could thus state that the order in which the Báb revealed His
writings seems to reflect His perception of the processes of creation
and Divine Revelation in general. As described above, in the act of
God’s Revelation to mankind the number seven may be seen as

describing the process by which the divine Will is communicated to
His Manifestations, which are Themselves also symbolized by this
number. This number is then ‘doubled’ and revealed to mankind in the
form of fourteen, which symbolizes the fourteen Pure Ones, before it
finds it’s final and complete expression in the number nineteen
signifying the primary Váḥid of the Islamic as well as of the Bábí
Dispensation. Possibly in an effort to mirror this pattern, the Báb thus
placed great emphasis on the number seven before the time of His
Declaration, did then structure His Revelation according to the
number fourteen before finally making the principle of nineteen the
underlying and organizing element of His Dispensation.
IV. THE COMING OF HIM WHOM GOD SHALL

MAKE MANIFEST

The details of the Badí‘ calendar were introduced by the Báb in a
number of His later writings, most notably the Persian Bayán and the
Kitáb-i-Asmá’ (Book of Names). Consisting of nineteen Váḥids of
nineteen chapters each, this latter work also follows in its structure the
law of Kull-i-Shay’. Like many other writings of the Báb, including
the Persian Bayán itself75, the main theme of the Kitáb-i-Asmá’ is the
coming of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Preparing His
followers for the appearance of this Promised Manifestation was one
of the Báb’s major objectives, and this overall aim of His ministry
also appears to underlie the design of the Badí‘ calendar. In the
Persian Bayán 5:3, the Báb states:

> …the Lord of the Universe hath created all the years by His command,
> and by the manifestation of the Bayán hath appointed ‘the Number of All
> Things’ [361] as the number of every year, and hath appointed it [to
> consist of] nineteen months, and hath appointed each month nineteen
> days […]. And He hath called the first month Bahá’ and the last ‘Alá’….

> And the first month is the month of the ‘Point,’ and around it revolve the
> months of ‘the Living’ [18]; and it is like unto the sun amidst the
> months, the other months being like mirrors wherein shineth forth the
> light of that month, and wherein naught is seen save that month. And it
> hath been named by the Lord the month of Bahá' in this sense, that the
> brightness of all the months is in that month. And [God] hath set it apart
> for ‘Him Whom God shall make manifest’, and hath assigned every day
> of it to one of the ‘Letters of the Living’. And the first day [thereof],
> which is the Naw-Rúz, is the day of ‘there is no god but God’;

\[75\] The Persian Bayán mentions He Whom God shall make manifest more than 300
times (Taherzadeh, Child 98).

> the like of that day is as the ‘Point’ in the Bayán, from which all are
> created, and unto which all return76. And He hath made the manifestation
> thereof in the ‘Point of the Bayán’, the ‘Person of the Seven Letters’, and
> hath made it the throne of ‘Him Whom God shall make manifest’ in this
> manifestation.77

The structure of the Badí‘ calendar thus reflects and represents the
primary Váḥid of the Bábí Dispensation on two levels: On the level of
the months, the first month (Bahá’) signifies the Point78 (i.e. the Báb)
while the remaining eighteen months symbolize the Letters of the
Living. The same schema is then repeated on the level of the days of
each month, where the first day (the day of Bahá’) again stands for the
Báb while the other days are similarly dedicated to the eighteen
Letters of the Living. Both the first month of the year and the first day
of each month, i.e. the month of Bahá’ as well as the day of Bahá’,
however, are not only dedicated to the Báb, but also to Him Whom
God shall make manifest. This may denote on the one hand that the
Revelation of the Báb and That of Him Whom God shall make
manifest are essentially one and the same and on the other hand
suggest that the Latter promised Manifestation is expected to appear in
the name of Bahá’. By giving the name of Bahá’ to the day from
which ‘All Things’ of the Badí‘ calendar originate, the Báb thus
essentially equated this name with the Primal Point of the promised
future Revelation. This is also evident from another Kull-i-Shay’
created by the Báb, which is a pentacle consisting of 360 derivates of

\[76\] It can be argued that this idea of the Point “from which all are created, and unto
which all return” is also expressed mathematically through the concept of Kull-i-
Shay’. The Point is represented by the number one, which is the origin of all numbers.
As explained above, from this number the numbers nineteen (Váḥid) and 361 (Kull-i-
Shay’) are generated. Both of these numbers have a cross total of ten and the essence
of ten is one again, so that in the end ‘All Things’ have returned to the Point. (I am
indebted to David Levick for alerting me to this interpretation.)

\[77\] Adapted from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Narrative 421 f.

\[78\] As indicated above, the term ‘Point’ signifies the Divine Unity and Universal
Intellect as manifested in the Person of the Manifestation of God. The day of Naw-
Rúz is thus also dedicated to the Unity of God which is evident from the Báb’s
assertion quoted above that it is the day of “there is no God but God”. Probably also
for that reason, every Bábí was to recite 361 times the verse “God beareth witness
that there is no God but Him, the Ineffable, the Self-Subsistent” during the night of
Naw-Rúz; and during the day, “God beareth witness that there is no God but Him, the
Precious, the Beloved” (Walbridge, Sacred 215).

IV. HE WHOM GOD SHALL MAKE MANIFEST                                        27

the name Bahá’ that He had sent to Bahá’u’lláh together with some of
His writings, His pen-case, seals and rings shortly before His
martyrdom.79 In this context of the association of the Point with the
name Bahá’ and the coming of Him Whom God shall make manifest it
is also of interest to note the presence of a tradition attributed to Imám
Ja’far-i-Ṣádiq which reads: “the Bá’ of the Basmalah is the glory of
God (Bahá’u’lláh).”80

‘Abdu’l-Bahá confirms the Báb’s abovementioned identification of
the day of Naw-Rúz81, which falls on the day of Bahá’ of the month of
Bahá’, with the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest.
For Him, Who obviously regards Bahá’u’lláh as this Promised One of
the Báb, the day of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation marks the beginning of a
new era in the religious history of mankind in a similar way in which
the day of Naw-Rúz is the first day of the new year and thus signifies
the start of a new cycle in nature:

> The rising of the sun at the equinox is the symbol of life, and likewise it
> is the symbol of the Divine Manifestation of God, for the rising of the
> Sun of Truth in the heaven of Divine Bounty established the signal of
> Life for the world. The human reality begins to live, our thoughts are
> transformed and our intelligence is quickened. The Sun of Truth bestows
> eternal Life, just as the solar sun is the cause of terrestrial life.82

The other month mentioned in the above quotation from the Persian
Bayán is the month of ‘Alá’ (Loftiness), which is the last month of the
year. In the Bahá’í Writings, the name ‘Alá’ is associated with the

the Basmalah (nineteen), which is the organizing element of the Badí‘ calendar, can in
itself also be read as a reference to the name Bahá’u’lláh, as it consists of the two
numbers one, which signifies the Divine Unity and thus God (Alláh) and nine, which
is the numerical equivalent of Bahá’ (Glory). Put together these two words form the
name Bahá’u’lláh (Glory of God). The same holds true for the number 361, as three
plus six equals nine (Bahá’), while one, again, stands for Alláh. (I am indebted to
Grover Gonzales for bringing this interpretation to my attention.)

Person of the Báb, which is evident from commonly used titles such
as ‘His Holiness the Exalted One’ (Ḥaḍrat-i-‘Alá).83 This month was
designated by the Báb as the month of the fast.84 Bahá’u’lláh accepted
this placement of the fast85 but changed some of the specific
regulations related to it.86

In the writings of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the fast is
described as a symbol of restraint, detachment and spiritual
purification:

> …this material fast is an outer token of the spiritual fast; it is a symbol of
> self-restraint, the withholding of oneself from all appetites of the self,
> taking on the characteristics of the spirit, being carried away by the
> breathings of heaven and catching fire from the love of God.87

And again:

> These are the days whereon Thou hast bidden all men to observe the fast,
> that through it they may purify their souls and rid themselves of all
> attachment to any one but Thee.… Cleanse Thou by its means the hearts
> of Thy servants… .88

Being the last month of the year, the month of ‘Alá’ therefore serves
as a period during which the believers cleanse themselves from the
burdens of past attachments and appetites and thereby purify their
hearts in preparation for the coming of the next year.

\[86\] The Bábí fast was, for example, compulsory for believers from the age of eleven,
which is numerically equivalent to and thus signifies the word ‘Huva’ (He = God)
until the age of forty-two which stand for the world ‘balá’ (yea!) indicating
humanity’s response to the Divine Covenant. Bahá’u’lláh changed this law making
the fast binding for believers between the age of fifteen and seventy (Walbridge,

IV. HE WHOM GOD SHALL MAKE MANIFEST                              29

The last nineteen days (Váḥid) of each year are thus associated with
the Báb and constitute a period of preparation for the next cycle
(year), while the first day of the new year signifies the coming of Him
Whom God shall make manifested in the name of Bahá’. This seems
to suggest that the month of the fast symbolizes the first Váḥid (i.e.
nineteen years) of the Bábí/Bahá’í Era, the end of which, according to
the Báb, would witness the Revelation of His Promised One.

During these first nineteen years after the Báb’s Declaration, which,
for Bahá’ís, mark the duration of the Bábí Dispensation, thousands of
believers gave up their rank, possessions and oftentimes even their
lives for their new Faith, thus demonstrating the ultimate degree of
sacrifice and detachment. The month of the fast could, therefore, be
considered a symbolic re-enactment of this early period of
Bábí/Bahá’í history.

In a similar way in which the fast prepares the believer for the start of
the next year this first Váḥid of the Bahá’í Era, according to the Báb,
served the purpose of preparing His followers for the coming of Him
Whom God shall make manifest and thus the beginning of a new
religious cycle. The Báb, therefore, states that the faith of His
followers is dependent upon the acceptance of Him Whom God shall
make manifest and begs the Latter to grant a period of nineteen years
to prepare them for His Revelation:

> I, indeed, beg to address Him Whom God shall make manifest, by Thy
> leave in these words: “Shouldst Thou dismiss the entire company of the
> followers of the Bayán in the Day of the Latter Resurrection by a mere
> sign of Thy finger even while still a suckling babe, Thou wouldst indeed
> be praised in Thy indication. And though no doubt is there about it, do
> Thou grant a respite of nineteen years as a token of Thy favour so that
> those who have embraced this Cause may be graciously rewarded by
> Thee. Thou art verily the Lord of grace abounding.”89

V. THE COMPLETION OF THE BADÍ‘

CALENDAR

1\. The Badí‘ Calendar and the Formative Age of the Bahá’í Faith:

During the early years of the Bábí/Bahá’í Era there was considerable
confusion about the proper use of the Badí‘ calendar. As already
mentioned, the Báb had not specified the placement of the intercalary
days, and it was also not quite clear which name corresponded to
which month and with which year the calendar was supposed to have
started. The Azalís90 had, for example, placed the intercalary days at
the end of the year just before the festival of Naw-Rúz, and some
Bahá’ís believed that 1863, the year of Bahá’u’lláh’s Declaration,
marked the commencement of the calendar. In 1870 Bahá’u’lláh thus
instructed one of His loyal followers, Nabíl-i-A‘ẓam, to prepare a
summary of the Badí‘ calendar which would help clarify some of
these questions. Bahá’u’lláh Himself then specified that the calendar
was to begin with Naw-Rúz of the year 1844, the year of the Báb’s
Declaration. Furthermore, in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas He later ruled that the
intercalary days should be placed before the month of the fast and
designated them as ‘Ayyám-i-Há’, the ‘Days of (the letter) Há’. These
days were to be dedicated to hospitality and charity or, as explained by
Shoghi Effendi, to the giving of gifts:91

> We have ordained that these, amid all nights and days, shall be the
> manifestations of the letter Há, and thus they have not been bounded by
> the limits of the year and its months. It behoveth the people of Bahá’,
> throughout these days, to provide good cheer for themselves, their

\[90\] Followers of Mírzá Yaḥyá (Subḥ-i-Azal), a half-brother and the main rival and
adversary of Bahá’u’lláh.

\[91\] Walbridge, Sacred 182.

> kindred and, beyond them, the poor and needy, and with joy and
> exultation to hail and glorify their Lord, to sing His praise and magnify
> His Name; and when they end – these days of giving that precede the
> season of restraint – let them enter upon the Fast.92

The letter Há, in the term Ayyám-i-Há, can have a number of different
meanings. Having a numerical value of five it could, on the one hand,
be meant to indicate the highest possible number of intercalary days.93
On the other hand, the number five is also associated with the
numerically equivalent title, Báb. Being shaped like a human body,
the five-pointed star, which the Báb called ‘Haykal’ (temple), is,
furthermore, a symbol for the human frame of the Manifestation of
God and is thus, according to Shoghi Effendi, the symbol not only of
the Bábí but also of the Bahá’í Faith.94 Moreover, the letter Há also
stands for the terms ‘Huva’ (He), which signifies God,95 and
‘Huvíyyah’ (essence, ipseity) denoting the unknowable Divine
Essence.96 Finally, according to the Bahá’í Writings, this Divine
Essence is contained within the divine realm of Háhút97, a name that is
probably derived from a combination of the letter Há and the word
Huva.98

When Bahá’u’lláh states in the above quotation that these days “shall
be the manifestations of the letter Há, and thus they have not been
bounded by the limits of the year and its months”, this might,
therefore, indicate that, while all the other days and months of the year
are dedicated to divine attributes, the Days of Há signify the
unknowable Essence of Divinity (Huvíyyah). In the same way in
which this Divine Essence is outside the range and limits of human
understanding, these days are, then, not part of the Kull-i-Shay’ (All
Things) of the year and thus beyond the limits of time and names.

V. THE COMPLETION OF THE BADÍ‘ CALENDAR 33

If we were to place the Festival of Ayyám-i-Há into the framework of
the interpretation of the Badí‘ calendar as a symbolic re-enactment of
early Bábí/Bahá’í history suggested above, it would denote the time
immediately preceding the Declaration of the Báb. According to
Amanat, it was during this time, especially the year before His
Declaration to Mullá Ḥusayn, that the Báb started to make allusions to
His family members regarding the claims He was to announce
publicly later on.99 It would thus appear that this was the time when
the Báb first came to the conviction that He had been chosen by God
to become the bearer of a new Divine Revelation.

In light of this interpretation we could, therefore, argue that the letter
Há, because of its numerical value of five and its association with the
Haykal (temple), signifies the Person of the Báb as the recipient of
Divine Revelation and at the same time, due to its association with
God (Huva) and the Divine Essence (Huvíyyah), symbolizes the
Divinity which is the source of this Revelation. This is also confirmed
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ Who explains the significance of the letter Há by
stating that “[t]his Há is the Há of the reality (Huvíyyah) and essence
of the Most Merciful, which is manifest and clear in the number five,
which is the numerical equivalent of the word Báb”100. The dreams
and visions in which the Divine Will was communicated to the Báb
and which caused Him to become convinced of His divinely ordained
mission were, then, not part of this world in the same way as the Days
of Há are not part of the nineteen months of the year and thus beyond
All Things. In this context it is also of interest to note that the phrase
Ayyám-i-Há is numerically equivalent to fifty-nine, which, according
to the Islamic calendar, corresponds to the year before the Báb’s
Declaration.101

By specifying the day of Naw-Rúz 1844 as the beginning of the Badí’
calendar and by placing the intercalary days before the month of the
Fast and designating them as Ayyám-i-Há Bahá’u’lláh, therefore,
completed this calendar in such a way that its structure now reflects

the chronology of some of the major events associated with the early
years of the Bábí/Bahá’í Era. Whether this was done intentionally or
not I cannot, at this stage, ascertain; but the precision of this match
between the organization of the Badí‘ calendar and the sequence of
events surrounding the birth of the Bábí and Bahá’í Religions suggests
that it is not a mere coincidence.

2\. Naw-Rúz and the Creation of the World:

The sequence of Ayyám-Há, the fast and Naw-Rúz appears to contain
yet another level of symbolic meaning as an allusion to and a replay of
the divine act of creation. This act of creation is described by
Bahá’u’lláh as follows:

> Indeed He was a hidden treasure. This is a station that can never be
> described nor even alluded to. And in the station of “I did wish to make
> Myself known”, God was, and His creation had ever existed beneath His
> shelter from the beginning that hath no beginning, apart from its being
> preceded by a Firstness which cannot be regarded as firstness and
> originated by a Cause inscrutable even unto all men of learning.

> That which hath been in existence had existed before, but not in the form
> thou seest today. The world of existence came into being through the
> heat (harára) generated from the interaction between the active force (al-
> fá'il) and that which is its recipient (al-munfa'il). These two are the same,
> yet they are different. Thus doth the Great Announcement inform thee
> about this glorious structure. Such as communicate the generating
> influence (al-fá'ilayn) and such as receive its impact (al-munfa'ilayn) are
> indeed created through the irresistible Word of God which is the Cause
> of the entire creation, while all else besides His Word are but the
> creatures and the effects thereof. Verily thy Lord is the Expounder, the
> All-Wise.102

The first part of this account is a reference to the famous Islamic
hadith “I was a Hidden Treasure and loved to be known. Therefore I
created the Creation that I might be known.” In His celebrated
commentary on this tradition, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that the station of

\[102\] Bahá'u'lláh, Tablets 140.

V. THE COMPLETION OF THE BADÍ‘ CALENDAR 35

the ‘Hidden Treasure’ is the same as the Divine Essence or Ipseity
(Huvvíyat).103 As we have already seen, the days of Ayyám-i-Há are
dedicated to the remembrance of this Divine Essence contained within
the world of Háhút.

The next stage in the process of divine creation described by
Bahá’u’lláh is that of the interaction of the active force with its
recipient, both of which are said to be created by the Word of God.104
Through this interaction a heat (harára) is generated that, in turn,
brings forth the world of existence. According to Bahá’u’lláh, the
same kind of heat is also produced by the fast: “Grant, O my Lord,
that the fire of Thy love and the heat (harára) produced by the fast
enjoined by Thee may inflame them in Thy Cause, and make them to
be occupied with Thy praise and with remembrance of Thee.”105 In a
similar way in which the heat of the cosmogony brings forth a new
creation, this heat of the fast can, therefore, inflame the believers in
the Cause of God and thus create a renewed and strengthened faith
within them.

In the third and last stage of Bahá’u’lláh’s account of the process of
divine creation, this cosmogenic heat brings about the entire world of
existence. This process can, therefore, be linked to the concept of the
Primal Point from which all things (Kull-i-Shay’) have been
generated. This Primal Point, of course, is, in turn, signified by the
Festival of Naw-Rúz. While the days of Ayyám-i-Há symbolize the
Divine Essence which precedes the existence of all created things, the
month of the fast, therefore, seems to signify the heat of the
cosmogony and the Festival of Naw-Rúz the beginning of the coming
into being of the entire world of existence.106

\[106\] I am indebted to Vahid J. Brown for bringing this level of symbolism to my
attention.

3\. The Badí‘ Calendar and the Shrine of the Báb:

Interestingly, this link between the Festival of Naw-Rúz and the act of
creation also seems to be reflected in the process of the erection of the
Báb’s Shrine on Mount Carmel. Almost all important stages and
landmarks in this process where achieved on various Naw-Rúz days.
On the day of Naw-Rúz 1953, Shoghi Effendi thus sent the following
cablegram to the Bahá’ís of the world:

> On occasion of Naw-Rúz of Holy Year convey twin joyful tidings to
> National Assemblies of the Bahá’í world. Building operations of the
> final unit of the Báb's Sepulcher commenced. Recall at this hour
> successive landmarks, each coinciding with a Naw-Rúz Festival in the
> history of the sixty year old enterprise founded by the Author of the
> Bahá’í Revelation. First, Naw-Rúz, 1909, witnessed the entombment
> within the Holy of Holies of the Shrine constructed by ‘Abdu'l-Bahá of
> the dust of the Martyr-Prophet of the Faith. Second, Naw-Rúz, 1949,
> coincided with the laying of the first threshold stones of the arcade.
> Third, Naw-Rúz, 1951, synchronized with the termination of the
> excavation within the Shrine foundations for the eight piers designed to
> support the weight of the three-storey superstructure. Fourth, Naw-Rúz,
> 1952, is associated with the completion of the octagon setting second
> crown of the holy Edifice.

> The celebrations of Naw-Rúz in this Holy Year are heightened by the
> placing of the first stones encircling the base of the dome. Anticipating,
> as the climax of the world-wide rejoicings of the Holy Year draw near,
> the placing of the gilded tiles, the fourth and last unit of the majestic
> Edifice. Fervently hoping that the greatest enterprise undertaken at the
> World Center of the Faith will be consummated ere the conclusion of the
> festivities of the Holy Year.107

It is not only in the process of the erection of this shrine, however, that
we can discern a link between this sacred building and the
organization of Bahá’í year. The structure and design of this edifice
also reflects the concept of Kull-i-Shay’ that constitutes the organizing
principle of the Badí’ calendar. The Báb’s Shrine has eighteen
windows – symbolizing the eighteen Letters of the Living – that
surround the vault containing His Remains. The terrace on which this

\[107\] Cablegram dated 21 March 1953. Cited in Shoghi Effendi, Messages 47 f.
V. THE COMPLETION OF THE BADÍ‘ CALENDAR 37

shrine is located is, moreover, surrounded by eighteen other terraces;
nine lying below and nine above it. While the day of Naw-Rúz is thus
the calendrical equivalent of the Primal Point Whose remains are held
within this edifice, the shrine itself, with its eighteen windows,
ostensibly corresponds to the month of Bahá’, the days of which are
dedicated to the Letters of the Living. The eighteen remaining
terraces, finally, could be regarded as the equivalent of the following
eighteen      months      of    the    Bábí     and     Bahá’í     year.
VI. THE DIVINE NAMES USED IN THE BAHÁ’Í

WEEK

1\. Tetrads, Heptads and Enneadecads

As already mentioned, the numbers four, seven and nineteen all play
significant roles in Bábí and Bahá’í cosmology and ontology. In order
to understand the following explanations of the significance of these
numbers within the Badí’ calendar, it will be necessary to take a brief
look at how the various tetrads, heptads and enneadecads (groups of
nineteen) described in the Bahá’í Writings are related to and derived
from each other.

We have already seen that, for the Báb, the number nineteen
constitutes a universal law or principle through which all things are
created and God’s plan unfolds in the world. It has also been
established that this number is primarily derived from the nineteen
letters of the Qur’ánic opening verse “Bismi’lláhi’r-Raḥmáni’r-
Raḥím” (In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful) which,
for the Báb, constitutes something like a divine world formula containing
in its essence the entire contingent world. According to the Báb, this
formula was made manifest for the first time in a corporal way in the
form of the primary Váḥid of the Islamic Dispensation. Since then it has
been re-revealed as “Bismi’lláhi’l-Amna‘i’l-Aqdas” (In the Name of
God, the Most Exalted, the Most Holy), the opening verse of the Báb’s
Arabic and Persian Bayán, and returned to the plane of physical existence
in the form of the primary Váḥid of the Bábí Dispensation. This universal
principle of nineteen is, as already mentioned, also the organizing element
of many of the Báb’s writings and of the Badí‘ calendar itself.

While the nineteen letters of the Basmalah are thus the source and
origin of the various Bábí and Bahá’í enneadecads (or Váḥids), the
four words that make up this verse give rise to a large number of
different tetrads mentioned in the Báb’s writings. Due to the fact that
the first word (or word group) of the Qur’ánic as well as of the Bábí
Basmalah (bism) consists of three letters, the second (Alláh) of four
and the last two (al-Raḥmán and al-Raḥím or al-Amna‘ and al-Aqdas) of
six letters each, many of these tetrads or quaternaries are, in turn,
composed of one group of three, one group of four and two groups of six
entities each. In the last chapter (báb) of the Persian Bayán, the Báb thus
states, for example, that human hearts (af’ida108 ) can only be purified
through belief in the first three letters of His Basmalah, while the spirits
(arwáḥ109 ) of man are cleansed by belief in the next four letters, souls or
selves (anfus110 ) through belief in the following six and bodies (ajsám111 )
by belief in the last six letters.

Another tetrad of this nature appears in váḥid eight, báb five of the same
book, where the Báb’s followers are asked to offer three diamonds, four
topazes, six emeralds and six rubies to Him Whom God shall make
manifest. In the same chapter, this tetrad of precious stones is associated
with a number of other quaternaries including one of white, yellow, green
and red lights, another consisting of the four elements of fire, air, water
and earth and a third one containing the abovementioned human faculties
of heart, spirit, soul or self and body.112 All of these quaternaries are said
to be in the shadow of “Bismi’lláhi’l-Amna‘i’l-Aqdas”, which ostensibly
signifies that they are derived from the four words of the Báb’s new
Basmalah.

As can be gleaned from these examples, the Báb’s tetrads generally
show a certain internal hierarchy, i.e. they usually start with the
lightest, warmest, brightest and most spiritual component and end
with the heaviest, coldest, darkest and most physical member. This
tendency is also exemplified by another one of these quaternaries
which is mentioned repeatedly in the Bahá’í Writings, namely that of
the four realms of Heavenly Court (Lahút), Dominion (Jabarút),

\[108\] Sing. fu’ád.

\[109\] Sing. rúḥ.

\[110\] Sing. nafs.

\[111\] Sing. jism.

\[112\] For an explanation of these tetrads see chapter VII.1 below.
VI. DIVINE NAMES IN THE BAHÁ’Í WEEK                                 41

Kingdom (Malakút) and Mortal Realm (Násút).             This tetrad
describes the different levels of the contingent word, while a fifth
realm called Háhút, which is sometimes added to these four, denotes
the station of the Divine Essence.

It appears that the different members of many of the Báb’s tetrads
describe certain qualities and attributes of each of these four realms of
the contingent world. The world of Násút which denotes the physical
word is thus, for example, associated with the coldest, heaviest and
most solid element earth, the human body and the darkest colour red.
This colour, according to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, signifies the act of
martyrdom which takes place in the material world.114

A variant of this tetrad of realms appears to be the abovementioned
notion of the seven stages of coming into being. In this Shí’ah
concept, that was first described by Imám Ja’far-i-Ṣádiq,115 the first
level Will (Mashíyyat) thus appears to be located in the realm of
Lahút, while the second level Purpose (Irádih) is ostensibly contained
within the dominion of Jabarút and the third stage Predestination
(Qadar) in the kingdom of Malakút. The last four stages of Fate
(Qaḍá’), Permission (Idhn), Fixed-Time (Ajal) and Book (Kitáb), on
the other hand, all occur within the material world called Násút, which
has thus been divided into four parts to form yet another tetrad. This
interpretation is supported by the fact that the attributes and functions
ascribed to each of these seven stages as well as their associated
colours largely correspond to their alleged counterparts in the tetrad of
realms. The realm of Lahút, as well as the stage of Will, are thus
linked to the colour white, while Jabarút and Purpose are both
associated with the colour yellow. The realm of Malakút and the stage
of Predestination are linked to the colour green and the realm of Nasút
as well as the stage of Fate, when mentioned as part of the first four
levels, to the colour red.116 When mentioned as the first member of the

\[113\] The realms of Malakút and Násút are both sometimes also referred to as Mulk. For
a more in-depth study of these realms see Milani and Fananapazir, “Pen Motif” and

last four of the seven stages of coming into being, however, the level of
Fate is linked to the colour white, while Permission is associated with
yellow, Fixed-time with green and the Book with red.117

These patterns of association can be summarized as follows:

2\. The Seven Stages of Coming into Being

In the foregoing pages it has already been suggested that the seven
stages of coming into being may be related to the seven days of the
Bahá’í week. In order to further explore the possibility of such a
relationship we will now examine these seven stages in a slightly more
detailed manner.

Following in the tradition of Shaykh Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í, the Bahá’í
Writings distinguish between three major ontological levels or worlds:
The World of God (‘Alám-i-Haqq), the World of Command (‘Alám-i-
Amr), and the World of Creation (‘Alám-i-Khalq).118 In this schema
the World of God refers to the unknowable and unattainable Divine
Essence or Ipseity – a station, which even the Manifestations of God
can never attain or fully comprehend. The World of Command is,
according to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “the station of the Primal Will, which is a
universal reality (ḥaqíqat-i-kullíyyih) that is resolved into infinite
forms”119, while the World of Creation denotes the realm of physical
existence.

While the World of God, according to the Bahá’í Writings, is not part
of the seven stages of coming into being, the first three of these stages
Will, Purpose and Predestination belong to the World of Command
which is an immaterial and atemporal dimension. The last four levels
of Fate, Permission, Fixed-Time and the Book, on the other hand, are
of a temporal nature as they occur within the World of Creation.120
The first of these seven stages, Will (Mashíyyat), is also referred to as
the Word (Kalimát) or Command (Amr) of God, the First Intellect
(‘Aqlu’l-Awwal) or the Self or Soul of God (Nafsu’l-lláh).121 It is the

\[118\] These are the three levels inscribed on the Bahá’í ringstone symbol.

\[120\] Brown, Creation.

\[121\] These designations apply to both the totality of the first three stages of coming into
being that subsist in the World of Command and the first one of these stages in

VI. DIVINE NAMES IN THE BAHÁ’Í WEEK                                    45

first emanation from God and the vehicle through which everything
else is created. This Primal Will has not been created by God’s
essence but through itself, because the Divine Essence is exalted
above any attributes or activities.122 Imám Ja’far-i-Ṣádiq is thus
reported to have stated: “God created the Will through itself, then He
created all things through the Will.”123

According to the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, and in the tradition of the
ancient Greek philosophers, nothing can be created except through the
interaction of an active force with a recipient. This principle of
polarity or coincidentia oppositorum is also described as a dyad of
existence and essence, matter and form124 or masculine and feminine.
When these two opposites unite a connection is realized from which a
new creation comes into being. The Báb thus states that

> with the exception of God, nothing can subsist through itself. All things
> are composite. Once this duality is established, connection is also
> established, for a thing cannot be a thing except through its existence,
> which is the aspect of manifestation (tajallí) in it, through its essence,
> which is the aspect of receiving (qubúl), and through connection (rabṭ),
> which is realized after the union [of the first two].125

In the divine act of creation these three realities of existence, essence
and connection correspond to the first three stages of coming into
being. The Primal Will (Mashíyyat) is the active force or existence,
the recipient agent or essence is represented by Purpose (Irádih) and
the resulting entity of connection is the stage of Predestination
(Qadar).126 For this reason, the stage of Will is also associated with the
element of fire, which is the most active one of the Aristotelian
elements. Likewise, Purpose is linked to air, an element that is less
active than fire but more active than water, with which the stage of

particular. The second and third stage (Irádih and Qadar) can thus also be regarded as
different forms or levels of the Will (Mashíyyat).

Predestination is associated. The first two of these three stages are also
linked by the Báb to the divine imperative “BE” (kun) through which
God called all creation into being.127 Referring to the two letters “B”
and “E” (Káf and Nún) that form this command, the Báb thus asserts:
“The "B" is the stage of the Will and the "E" is the stage of Purpose.
The Will is the father of all things, and Purpose is their mother. […]
Through the "B" God created the matter (mádda) of all things...and
through the "E" God created the form (ṣúra) of all things.”128 Once
these two letters have been joined together the stage of Predestination
is manifested.129

Another symbol used in the Bahá’í Writings to explain this process is
that of the pen (qalam). Bahá’u’lláh frequently refers to the Will of
God, and to Himself as its Manifestation, as the Most Sublime or Most
Exalted Pen (Qalamu’l-A‘lá) and equates the act of writing with the
process of divine creation.130 In order for the pen, as an active force, to
be able to write it needs a recipient, which is usually signified by the
tablet (lawḥ). However, some Islamic traditions also point to the ink as
the recipient force, as the pen has to unite with it before it can be used
to write. One of these traditions is cited by Ibn-Kathír and reads:
“Verily the first thing that God created is the Pen, then He created the
nún, which is the ink-pot (dawát).”131 The Arabic letter “Nún”, that is
the second letter of the divine command “BE” (kun) which is linked
by the Báb to the station of Purpose (Irádih), is shaped like an ink-pot
and, possibly for this reason, can also literally signify an ink-pot when
spelled out as Nún-Waw-Nún. The actual script inscribed by this pen,
then, signifies the stage of Predestination, as can be gleaned from
another Islamic tradition which reads: “The first thing which God

\[127\] See, for example, the following passage in the long obligatory prayer: “I testify
[…] that He Who hath been manifested is the Hidden Mystery, the Treasured Symbol,
through Whom the letters B and E (Be) have been joined and knit together.”
Bahá'u'lláh, Aqdas 95.

created is the Pen. Then He said (to the Pen), ‘Write!’ The Pen said,
‘what shall I write?’ He said, ‘inscribe Predestination (Qadar)!’”132

This principle of the necessary interaction of an active force with a
recipient in the process of creation may also shed some light on the
symbolic significance of the biblical story of Adam and Eve as the
founders of the human race. Viewed in the light of this concept, Adam
may be regarded as symbolizing the active force of the Will, while
Eve could be the seen as signifying the recipient entity of Purpose.
Such an interpretation is, indeed, confirmed by the Báb Who states
that “the stage of Purpose, […] is the Eve of the Primal Adam and the
Throne whereon the Will is seated in the station of the All-
Merciful.”133

The stage of Predestination, that is the third stage of coming into
being, is described by Bahá’u’lláh as “the stage of scheme and
dimension, that is to say, the appearance of means in proper
quantity”.134 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, furthermore explains that this stage
consists of “the necessary and indispensable relationships which exist
between the realities of things”.135 What this means is that, through
the interaction of Will and Purpose, the divine archetypes (‘ayn) for
all created things come into being at this level. These archetypes are
more or less identical to the Platonic forms and signify the divine
design plans after which all created things are fashioned.136 The course
of biological evolution, for example, is, therefore, the process by
which matter is gradually shaped and fashioned until a being (e.g. a
species) is formed whose form and shape reflects its archetype
contained in the realm of Predestination.137 For this reason, the Báb
also calls this stage the “womb of the contingent world” and explains

that its purpose is “the design (handasa) of substances, matters,
existences, natures, essences, accidents, and forms”.138

According to the Báb, this stage of Predestination “which is made
manifest after the conjunction of the two Commands [i.e. Will and
Purpose]” is also the realm where “the condition of choosing good or
evil ariseth”.139 This ability of choice between good and evil is what
‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes as the free will granted to human beings.140
Imám Ja’far-i-Ṣádiq explains in this regard:

> Each believer has a likeness upon the Throne [i.e. in the realm of
> Predestination], such that when he performs an obligatory prayer his
> likeness does the same, whereupon the angels bless him and ask for his
> forgiveness. And when a servant is disobedient, God causes a curtain of
> night to descend around his likeness, of which the angels are aware.141

In a similar way in which the term Will (Mashíyyat) is applied to the
total of the first three stages of coming into being (Will, Purpose and
Predestination) as well as to the first one of these three levels in
particular, the four stages following the manifestation of
Predestination are sometimes collectively referred to as Fate (Qaḍá’),
which is also the name of the first of those four levels. These last four
stages, together, signify the manifestation of the divine Will in the
world of physical existence and are thus subject to the temporal and
material limitations of this realm. For this reason, change to the divine
Will (badá’) is not possible anymore once the stage of Fate has been
reached.142 These last four stages of coming into being are also
referred to by the Báb as the four pillars of the Throne of Purpose
(Irádih) whereon the Primal Will (Mashíyyat) is seated.143

Shaykh Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í describes the first of these last four levels,
which is the fourth stage of coming into being, using the example of
the construction of a bed: While the stage of Predestination (Qadar) is
“measuring the materials of a bed for length, breadth, and shape”,
the level of Fate or Decree (Qaḍá’), he explains, “corresponds to
[actually] composing them into a bed.”144

The stage of Fate is associated with the most passive or recipient
element earth and the corresponding colour red when mentioned as the
last member of the first tetrad of stages.145 This is because the stage of
Fate serves as a recipient to the three higher levels. When mentioned
as part of the last four levels, however, this stage is linked to the most
active element fire and the corresponding colour white, because it
serves as an active force in relation to the three stages that it precedes.

The fifth stage of coming into being is variably termed Permission
(Idhn) or Execution (Imḍá’). This level is associated with the element
air as well as the colour yellow and signifies the divine authorization
for the existence of any particular thing or creature. The sixth stage,
Fixed-Time (Ajal), denotes the predetermined duration of existence of
every such thing and is linked to the colour green and the element
water. The seventh and last level, which is the stage of the Book
(Kitáb) signifies “the unveiling of the perfection of things” 146 and thus
the final and complete manifestation in the physical world of the
divine archetypes contained within the World of Command. It is
associated with the recipient element earth and its corresponding
colour red.

These seven stages of coming into being, therefore, describe the
process by which the Divine Will manifests itself in the material
world. Bahá’u’lláh thus explains in His Lawḥ-i-Hikmat that “nature is
God’s Will and its expression in and through the contingent world.”147
It is also of interest to note in this context that the Arabic terms for
“will” (mashíyyat) and “thing” (shay’) are both derived from the same

root, which is “he willed” (shá’a), thus implying that every created
thing is in its essence an expression of the Divine Will.

3\. The Concept of Divine Names

Before we can try to establish a connection between the act of divine
creation as described above and the names of the days of the Bahá’í
week it may be of benefit to take a brief look at the concept of names
and attributes of God as it is depicted in the Bahá’í Writings and in
Islamic literature. According to Bahá’í Scripture, God is “in His
Essence sanctified above all names and exalted beyond even the
loftiest attributes.”148 If the Divine Manifestations describe Him by
certain names or attributes they are thus not trying to say that He
actually possesses any of these attributes but are only asserting that He
cannot possibly lack them:

> For instance, as we consider created things we observe infinite
> perfections, and the created things being in the utmost regularity and
> perfection we infer that the Ancient Power on whom dependeth the
> existence of these beings, cannot be ignorant; thus we say He is All-
> Knowing. It is certain that it is not impotent, it must be then All-
> Powerful; it is not poor, it must be All-Possessing; it is not non-existent,
> it must be Ever-Living. The purpose is to show that these attributes and
> perfections that we recount for that Universal Reality are only in order to
> deny imperfections, rather than to assert the perfections that the human
> mind can conceive. Thus we say His attributes are unknowable.149

Such a description via negation makes it possible to circumvent the
philosophical dilemma that God, if He actually possessed any of the
attributes human beings ascribe to Him, would be dependent upon the
existence of His creation. If God was knowing in the sense that human
beings use this attribute, for example, He would be dependent upon
the existence of things He can have knowledge of. As such a notion is
not possible from a Bahá’í perspective, the essential attributes of God
must, therefore, be of a fundamentally different nature than the
attributes known to man:

\[148\] Bahá'u'lláh, Gems 33.

\[149\] ‘Abdu'l-Bahá, Tablet to Forel 17 f.

> The Prophets say the knowledge of God has no need of the existence of
> beings, but the knowledge of the creature requires the existence of
> objects of knowledge; if the knowledge of God had need of any other
> thing, then it would be the knowledge of the creature, and not the
> knowledge of God, for the preexistent is different from the created, and
> the created is opposed to the preexistent….Therefore, the preexistence of
> the specifications and individualizations of beings, which are the things
> known of God, does not exist. These divine and perfect attributes
> [belonging to God’s Essence] cannot be encompassed by rational
> perception in order to judge whether the knowledge of God needs objects
> of knowledge or not.150

The essential attributes of God, which exist in the world of Háhút, are
thus beyond human understanding and not describable by human
terminology and language. In this realm of the Ipseity no difference
exists between God’s essence and His attributes. Such a distinction
only arises in the first realm of the contingent world, i.e. the Primal
Will (Mashíyyat) or the corresponding realm of Láhút.151 Any names
and attributes we use to describe God do, therefore, not actually apply
to the Divine Essence but to His Prophets and Messengers, Who are
the manifestations of God’s Will rather than His Essence:

> All the descriptions, the qualities, the names and the attributes which we
> mention return to the Divine Manifestations; but as no one has attained
> to the reality of the Essence of Divinity, so no one is able to describe,
> explain, praise or glorify it. Therefore, all that the human reality knows,
> discovers and understands of the names, the attributes and the
> perfections of God refer to these Holy Manifestations.”152

Even though only the Divine Manifestations possess all the attributes
ascribed to God to their fullest degree, human beings are also
potentially able to reflect every single one of them. This potential sets
humanity apart from the rest of creation, as all other created things are
only able to reflect one of the divine names or attributes:

\[150\] ‘Abdu'l-Bahá , Some Answered Questions 293 ff.

\[151\] Brown, Creation.

\[152\] ‘Abdu'l-Bahá , Some Answered Questions 148.

> Upon the inmost reality of each and every created thing He hath shed the
> light of one of His names, and made it a recipient of the glory of one of
> His attributes. Upon the reality of man, however, He hath focused the
> radiance of all of His names and attributes, and made it a mirror of His
> own Self. Alone of all created things man hath been singled out for so
> great a favor, so enduring a bounty.153

God’s attributes are thus manifested in the physical world, i.e. the
realm of Násút, in two different ways: The manifestation of individual
attributes through every created thing which is referred to as universal
revelation (tajallíy-i-‘ám)154 and the manifestation of the totality of
His attributes through the Divine Manifestations that is called specific
or secondary revelation (tajallí-i-khás/tajallí-i-thání).155

The names and attributes of God contained in the World of Command
are more than mere terms used to describe the Logos or the Divine
Manifestations, they are the highest creative principle and the cause of
existence of all created things. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, therefore, describes
these names as “the first principle of giving existence in the world of
creation and the source of the different grades of realities in the
degrees of existence”.156 He, furthermore, asserts that they “are
actually and forever existing and not potential. Because they convey
life, they are called Life-giving; because they provide, they are called
Bountiful, the Provider; because they create, they are called Creator;
because they educate and govern, the name Lord God is applied”.157
Bahá’u’lláh thus explains:

> When God purposed to make His action manifest in His realm, reveal it
> upon His earth, establish it in His land, and make it a perpetual word and
> a clear sign, He clothed it in the garment of names. […] Nothing in the
> heavens or on the earth can exist unless it is under the shadow of certain
> names among His names. For example, if thou seest the knowledge of a
> learned person, be assured that this knowledge hath appeared as a result
> of the effulgence of the name of God the Knowing. If thou observest the

Unlike God’s essence and essential attributes which are contained in
the realm of Háhút and independent of the contingent word, the names
and attributes of God - or more precisely of His Manifestations -
contained in the World of Command “require the existence of objects
or creatures upon which they have been bestowed and in which they
have become manifest”.159

4\. God’s Names and the Seven Stages of Coming into Being

Keeping in mind the essential distinction between God’s unknowable
essence and the attributes ascribed to Him, we can now go on to
examine the individual names and attributes of God used in the Badí‘
calendar in a slightly more detailed manner. For this purpose we will
first direct our attention to the names given to each day of the Bahá’í
week.

In late Islamic thought, these divine names and attributes which, as we
have seen, actually belong to the Manifestations of God, are grouped
into the two complementary categories of names of Glory or Majesty
(Jalál) and names of Beauty (Jamál).160 The attributes of Jalál are
names that indicate God’s power, might or wrath, while the names of
Jamál denote His mercy and forgiveness.161 In accordance with the
ubiquitous principle of polarity described above, the divine names of
Jalál thus represent a masculine or active force, while the attributes of

Archives, unpublished manuscript, no. BC003/070/00084 C. Cited in Brown,
Creation.

\[159\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Promulgation 219.

\[160\] Walbridge, Sacred 196.

\[161\] Ibid 196 f.

Jamál are of a feminine and, therefore, recipient nature.162 Some
Islamic and especially Súfí schools of thought, however, have added a
third category to this schema which is that of the divine names of
perfection (Kamál).163

The Súfí mystic Hazrat Inayat Khan (1882–1927) thus describes the
act of breathing, not only of humans but also of God, as consisting of
three different types of breath: a stronger breath called Jalál, a weaker
breath termed Jamál and the breath of Kamál, which unites and
thereby annihilates the other two. For Khan, breath is the great power
that stands behind the word and is thus the underlying cause of its
existence.164 In regard to the process of the utterance of the Word of
God this would, therefore, mean that these three types of breath have
to appear before any word can be pronounced and, thereby, made
manifest.

This notion bears some resemblance to the depiction of the act of
divine creation given by Shaykh Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í in his Sharḥu’l-
Favá’id and confirmed in the Báb’s Tafsír-i-Há’, wherein the first four
levels of the seven stages of coming into being are described as
consisting of two stages of inhaling (istansháq) and two stages of
exhaling (istanṭáq).165 In the first of these four stages the air is inhaled
into the divine mouth, after which it is warmed by the heat of divine
Reality in the second stage, pushed to the fore in the third stage and
finally exhaled as a complete word in the fourth.166 The first three of
these stages, therefore, take place in the mouth of God which seems to
symbolize the World of Command wherein the levels of Will, Purpose
and Predestination are contained, while the fourth stage arises outside
the mouth thus ostensibly pointing to the fact that the level of Decree
is manifested in the physical world.

From a blend of these two accounts it would, therefore, follow that the
divine name Jalál (Glory or Majesty) might signify the active force

\[162\] See, for example, Murata, Sourcebook..

\[163\] See, for example, Nicholson, Mysticism 207

\[164\] Khan, “Sufí Teachings”, part 1, chapter XVII.4.

\[165\] Saiedi, Logos 56 f.

\[166\] Ibid.

present in the process of divine creation and could thus be indicative
of the level of Will (Mashíyyat) in the seven stages of coming into
being. The name of Jamál (Beauty) would, then, signify the recipient
agent of Purpose (Irádih), while Kamál (Perfection) might denote the
level of Predestination (Qadar), which is where the active force and its
recipient unite. When the Báb gave the names of Jalál, Jamál and
Kamál to the first three days of the Bábí/Bahá’í week, He may thus
have intended to allude, thereby, to the first three stages of coming
into being. Such an interpretation is also supported by the fact that
these three names are the only ones that appear in both the seven-day
week and the nineteen-day month of the Badí‘ calendar. Furthermore,
the order of these three names is the same in both cases with the only
difference lying in the fact that the name of Kamál does not follow
that of Jamál immediately in the nineteen days of the month.167
Interestingly, this order does not reflect the structure of the Du’á sahar
– the Shí’ah dawn prayer from which the Báb originally took the
names for the nineteen days of the Bábí/Bahá’í month – as in this
prayer the name of Jamál is mentioned before that of Jalál although
most other names are invoked in the same order in which they appear
in the Badí‘ calendar.168
It appears that this ostensible pattern of association between the seven
stages of coming into being and the names of the days of the Bahá’í
week can also be extended to the remaining four stages and their
respective counterparts in the seven-day week:

As mentioned above, the fourth stage of coming into being is termed
Decree or Fate (Qaḍá’), while the corresponding weekday is named
Fiḍál (Grace). Although these two terms do not seem to be closely
related at first sight, the Bahá’í Writings are full of indications of the
fact that whatever God decrees for His creatures (i.e. what He
determines to be their fate) is, in reality, nothing but a sign of His
grace and mercy. As already indicated, the level of Fate or Decree is
the first stage of the manifestation of the Divine Will in the physical
world. Whatever manifests itself as the Divine Decree in this world,

\[167\] For a possible explanation of this difference refer to chapters VII.3-5 below.

\[168\] The only other change of order introduced by the Báb in the Badí‘ calendar is the
reversal of the names of ‘Ilm and Qudrat
however, is in reality a sign of God’s grace and mercy without which,
as Bahá’u’lláh explains, any form of existence would be impossible:

> I can have no doubt that should the holy breaths of Thy loving-kindness
> and the breeze of Thy bountiful favor (ifḍál)169 cease, for less than the
> twinkling of an eye, to breathe over all created things, the entire creation
> would perish, and all that are in heaven and on earth would be reduced to
> utter nothingness.170

Bahá’u’lláh furthermore asserts that the “Word of God”, which, as
already explained is the same as His Will and thus the origin of the
divine decree (Qaḍá’), “is God's all-pervasive grace (fayḍ), from
which all grace (fuyúḍat) doth emanate.”171

The following quotation is another indication of the essential
equivalence of Qaḍá’ and Fiḍál, both of which are mentioned here
together in slightly different grammatical forms:

> Know thou that We have annulled the rule of the sword, as an aid to Our
> Cause, and substituted for it the power born of the utterance of men.
> Thus have We irrevocably decreed, by virtue of Our grace (‘an jahati’l
> faḍlin maqḍíyyá).172

The term Fate (Qaḍá’), therefore, describes from a human perspective
what is, from the divine point of view, an outpouring of Divine Mercy
(Fiḍál). Put in other words: the divine name of Mercy manifests itself
as Fate in the world of humanity.

The fifth stage of coming into being is the level of Permission (Idhn),
and the corresponding weekday bears the name of ‘Idál (Justice).
Justice, in Islamic thought, is the opposite of grace, as justice is giving
exactly what is due, while grace means to give more than is
deserved.173 The term Idhn, as used in the Bahá’í Writings, denotes the

\[169\] The word ifḍál is a grammatical variant of Fiḍál.

\[170\] Bahá'u'lláh, Prayers 90. In light of the above references to the divine breath, it is
also of interest to note that, in this quotation, it is God’s holy breaths (nafaḥáti) which
breathe His bountiful favours over all created things.

\[171\] Bahá'u'lláh, Tablets 141.

\[172\] Bahá'u'lláh, Gleanings 303.

\[173\] Walbridge, Sacred 195.

permission or approval of an authority for a certain act to be carried
out. This word, therefore, has certain legal connotations, which is why
it is also translated by Shoghi Effendi as “judgment”.174 In its negated
form (lá adhinta, i.e. not permitted) it signifies actions that are legally
prohibited. Permitting certain things and prohibiting others is an act of
legislation and thus of justice.

God’s Justice (‘Idál), therefore, ostensibly manifests itself in the world
as His Permission (Idhn) for the existence of every created thing. It
should not, therefore, appear unreasonable to relate the divine name of
Justice to the level of Permission, the fifth stage of coming into being.

The sixth stage of coming into being is termed Ajal (Fixed-Time)
while the name of the corresponding weekday is Istijlál (Majesty).
The term ajal is used in both the Qur’án and the Bahá’í Writings to
describe the appointed time of resurrection175 which, according to
Bahá’í Scripture, denotes the Revelation of a new Divine
Manifestation. At Qur’án 29:5, a verse quoted by Bahá’u’lláh in His
Epistle to the Son of the Wolf,176 for example, “the set time of God
(ajalu’l-lláh)” refers to the time when mankind will attain God’s
presence. It is at this appointed time of resurrection that the Majesty
and Glory of God is revealed to mankind. Bahá’u’lláh thus exclaims:
“Verily, the Crier hath cried out, when the promised time (míqát)
came, and they that have recognized the splendors of Sinai have
swooned away in the wilderness of hesitation, before the awful
majesty (saṭwat) of thy Lord, the Lord of creation.”177 Similarly, He
asserts that “when the set time (míqát) of concealment was fulfilled,
We sent forth, whilst still wrapt within a myriad veils, an infinitesimal
glimmer of the effulgent Glory (An-núr-i-núrá) enveloping the Face of
the Youth…”178 Moreover, Bahá’u’lláh explains that in pursuance “of
the principle that for every thing a time (waqt) hath been fixed, and
for every fruit a season hath been ordained, the latent energies of such
a bounty can best be released, and the vernal glory (rabí‘a) of such a

\[174\] For example in the phrase “tokens of Thy decree and judgment” found on page 210

of Bahá’u’lláh, Prayers.

\[175\] See, for example, Qur’án 6:2.

\[177\] Bahá’u’lláh, Epistle 132f.

\[178\] Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings 75.

gift can only be manifested, in the Days of God.”179 Using a different
grammatical form of the word Istijlál, Bahá’u’lláh, furthermore,
repeatedly asserts that God lies hidden behind veils of glory (subuḥát-
i-jalál) which only His Manifestations can rent asunder through Their
Revelation.180

When applied to the process of Divine Revelation, the term fixed-time
(ajal) thus apparently denotes the appointed time when the Glory and
Majesty (Istijlál) of God is revealed to mankind through the
Revelation of a Divine Manifestation. It is also of interest to note in
this context that the word ajal is usually orthographically
indistinguishable from the term ajall (the most exalted), which is a
different grammatical form of Istijlál.

The seventh and last stage of coming into being is termed Kitáb
(Book), while its corresponding weekday is named Istiqlál
(Independence). The root from which the word Istiqlál is derived
(qalla) is a verb meaning to diminish, wane, decrease, etc. In a similar
way in which Justice (‘Idál) and Mercy (Fiḍál) can be regarded as two
complementary opposites, Istijlál and Istiqlál thus also lie on two ends
of the same spectrum, as the root word of Istijlál (jalla) refers to
making something exalted, great and majestic while the term, qalla,
signifies an act of diminishing or making small.

A possible link between the attribute of Independence and the stage of
the Book can be seen in the numerous statements contained in both the
Bahá’í Writings and the Qur’án, which point to the fact that the
revelation of a Holy Book (Kitáb) or divinely inspired verses (áyát) is
the greatest and most compelling proof of the independence of God’s
Prophets and Messengers. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá thus explains: “The
independent Prophets (anbíyá’-i-mustaqillah181) are the lawgivers and
the founders of a new cycle. Through Their appearance the world puts
on a new garment, the foundations of religion are established, and a
new book (kitáb) is revealed.”182 The Book as the last stage and the

\[181\] A different grammatical form of Istiqlál.

\[182\] “Abdu'l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions 164.

end product of the process of divine creation and revelation is thus
also the ultimate sign of the independence of its Revealer.

In His Lawḥ-i-Hikmat Bahá’u’lláh, moreover, refers to the entire world
as a divine book and states that the study of this book will render the
reader independent of any other teacher:

> Look at the world and ponder a while upon it. It unveileth the book
> (kitáb) of its own self before thine eyes and revealeth that which the Pen
> of thy Lord, the Fashioner, the All-Informed, hath inscribed therein. It
> will acquaint thee with that which is within it and upon it and will give
> thee such clear explanations as to make thee independent of every
> eloquent expounder.183

A book can, therefore, not only serve as a proof of the independence
of its Revealer, but can also render its reader independent of other
sources of knowledge.
The names chosen by the Báb for the seven days of the Bábí/Bahá’í
week do, therefore, appear to be more than an arbitrary selection of
different attributes of God. In a similar way in which many aspects of
the Badí’ calendar ostensibly are a reflection of certain cosmological
and ontological Bábí and Bahá’í concepts, the various meanings and
connotations as well as the order of these names may be seen as
signifying the process by which, according to the Bahá’í Writings,
every created thing comes into being.

The pattern of association between the divine names used in the
Bahá’í week and the seven stages of coming into being tentatively put
forward here is thus one where each of these seven attributes of God
manifests itself as one of the stages of coming into being. The divine
name of Glory (Jalál) thus ostensibly manifests itself as God’s Will
(Mashíyyat) while the name of Beauty (Jamál) gives rise to the level
of Purpose (Irádih) and the name of Perfection (Kamál) to the stage of
Predestination (Qadar). In the same way God’s Mercy (Fiḍál) reveals
itself through the Fate (Qaḍá’) He decrees for His creatures, and His
Justice (‘Idál) is manifest in the Permission (Idhn) He gives for their
existence. Likewise, God’s Majesty (Istijlál) is revealed at the

\[183\] Bahá’u’lláh, Tablets 141f.

appointed or Fixed-Time (Ajal) of the appearance of His
Manifestations, Whose Independence (Istiqlál) is, finally, proven and
established through the revelation of a divinely revealed Book (Kitáb).
VII. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NAMES OF

THE MONTHS

1\. The Báb’s Tetrad of Months

Following a schema already described above in the discussion of Bábí
tetrads, the Báb divided the nineteen months of the year into four
groups. In accordance with the number of letters of each of the four
words of the Basmalah,184 the first member of this tetrad consists of
the first three months, while the following four months form the
second group. The next six as well as the last six months of the year,
likewise, form one member of this tetrad each.

This scheme was introduced in a passage from váḥid 5, báb 3 of the
Persian Bayán, which is summarized by E.G. Browne as follows:

> … the three first months are chiefly set apart for Glorification (taṣbiḥ)
> since in them is created the Fire (nár) in the Hearts (af’ida) of All Things;
> and in the four following months, which are the months of Praise
> (taḥmíd), are created the Spirits (arwáḥ) of all Contingent things, for in
> them is Sustenance (rizq) given; and in the six subsequent months, which
> are the months of Unification (tawḥíd), God causeth existing things to
> die, not by a bodily death, but by a Death (mawt) from denial and a Life
> (ḥayat) in affirmation; and in the subsequent six months, which are the
> months of Magnification (takbír), God gives life to the people who have
> died from love of all that is beside Him, and have remained firmly
> established in His Love.

> And in the first three months is the Fire of God (nár-i-alláh); and in the
> four subsequent months, the Air of Eternity (ḥawá’-i-azal) without
> Beginning; and in the six subsequent months the Water of Unification
> (má’-i-tawḥid), which runs over the Selves (anfus) of all things, from

\[184\] As mentioned above, the four words of the Bábí Basmalah are: bism, Alláh, al-
Amna‘ and al-Aqdas.

> the air of Eternity which is projected from the Fire of God; and the
> subsequent six months are connected with the Earth (turáb), for what
> appeared from the three elements has become fixed in those three
> elements.185

The tetrads involved and their corresponding months are thus:

In a similar way in which the days of the Bahá’í week appear to be
associated with the seven stages of coming into being, it is possible to
discern a link between this tetrad of months with their four associated
quaternaries and the realms of Láhút, Jabarút, Malakút and Násút. In
order to examine this ostensible pattern of association it will be
beneficial to first take a brief look at the four tetrads mentioned in the

\[186\] The term khalq is used a few times in the above quotation in its verbal form
(khalaqa) where it is translated as (he) created, but is not explicitly referred to as a
member of any tetrad here. In other writings of the Báb, however, khalq is mentioned
numerous times as the first member of the tetrad containing rizq, mawt and ḥayat .

\[187\] Although the human body is not explicitly mentioned in the above quotation, it is
evident from other references in the writings of the Báb that it is indeed the fourth
member of the tetrad containing heart, spirit and self. The Báb uses the terms jism and
jasad, which can both be translated as body, interchangeably in these cases.

above passage from the Persian Bayán and their respective
relationships to these divine realms.

The first tetrad mentioned in this passage contains the four
Aristotelian elements of fire, air, water and earth. According to
Bahá’u’lláh these four elements were the first things to be created by
God: “Know that the first tokens that emanated from the pre-existent
Cause in the worlds of creation are the four elements: fire, air, water
and earth”.188 This quaternary of elements could, therefore, be seen as
a reference to the process of divine creation. Interestingly, this account
is very much in conformity with modern scientific theories about the
birth of our universe. These theories postulate that matter existed first
in the physical state of plasma (fire), which later condensed to take on
the gaseous state (air) and, after further cooling and compression by
gravitational forces, was turned into liquids (water) and finally solids
(earth).189 This role of the four elements in the process of creation may
be one of the reasons for their abovementioned association with the
four realms of Láhút, Jabarút, Malakút and Násút and the
corresponding stages of coming into being.

The second tetrad contains the four most important forms of Dhikr
(remembrance of God), which are called Glorification (taṣbiḥ), Praise
(taḥmíd), Unification (tawḥid) and Magnification (takbír). According
to an Islamic hadith, these forms of remembrance were dearer to
Muḥammad “than anything over which the sun rises”.190 Glorification
(taṣbiḥ) is praising God by exclaiming “subḥhána-Alláh (praised be
God)”. Praise (taḥmíd) is giving thanks to God by saying “al-ḥamdu
Lilláh” (thanks be to God). Unification (tawḥid) is the confession of
the oneness of God and, in its shortest form, is performed by
exclaiming “lá iláha illa’Lláh” (no god is there but God). The Islamic
formula of Magnification (takbír) is “Alláhu Akbar” (God is Great)
while the Bahá’í version adopted during the lifetime of Bahá’u’lláh is
“Alláhu Abhá” (God is All-Glorious). Each of the four members of

the Báb’s tetrad of months is thus dedicated to the remembrance of
God by one of these four forms of Dhikr.

A possible link between these different forms of Dhikr and the four
divine realms can be discerned in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s assertion that the
soul in the realm of Malakút confirms the reality of the profession of
God’s unity.191 The third form of Dhikr (tawḥid) is, therefore,
associated with the corresponding third realm of Malakút.
Furthermore, and as already explained above, the level of
Predestination (Qadar), which is the third stage of coming into being
and apparently associated with the same realm, is the locus of the
unification of Will (Mashíyyat) and Purpose (Irádih). Links between
the other three forms of Dhikr and the remaining realms of Láhút,
Jabarút and Násút appear to be of a more indirect nature, i.e. through
their shared association with other quaternaries such as that that of the
four elements.

The third tetrad mentioned in the above quotation contains the four
human faculties of Heart (fu’ád), Spirit (rúḥ), Self or Soul (nafs) and
Body (jism or jasad). The term heart (fu’ád) describes the highest
spiritual faculty of man. According to the Bahá’í Writings, the heart is
the seat of intuition, the faculty with which the essence of the Sacred
Writings can be understood without need for prior education and
learning.192 It is the heart which, when detached from all earthly things
and turned towards God, becomes a mirror reflecting the divine
attributes. 193 According to Bahá’u’lláh, the human heart is the only
thing in the entire world of creation that God has reserved for Himself
and that He has made the “throne of the revelation of His Glory”.194

The human spirit (rúḥ), which is described as an essence (dhát) and a
spiritual reality (haqíqat) in the Bahá’í Writings, is the eternal and
immortal aspect of man and constitutes his true identity. Its function is to
know its Creator and to receive His grace.195 The intellectual power of

\[195\] Lepain, Archéologie VII.3.

reason (‘aql), which allows human beings to understand abstract realities
is a faculty of the human spirit.196 After the death of the human body, the
spirit continues its eternal journey towards its Creator. As the human
spirit does not appear to be able to gain access to the divine realms higher
than that of Malakút,197 however, it can never actually reach the presence
of God, but only that of His Manifestations.198 The Bahá’í concept of the
eternal human spirit is thus quite similar to the Christian idea of the
immortal soul of man, which is why the term rúḥ is also commonly
translated as ‘soul’ in the Bahá'í Writings.

The term nafs (self or soul) describes the vital principle of man that
makes up his psyche and contains his psychological traits and
characteristics as well as his sense of self.199 It is the organ that allows the
spirit (rúḥ) to communicate with the body and the locus of academic
knowledge and learning.200 As it contains the human ego with all its
animal instincts and sensual desirers, it is prone to develop attachments to
self and the material world. When this happens the self or soul becomes
consumed by idle fancies and vain imaginings and turns into a veil
preventing man from understanding his true destiny and purpose in life.201
Because the self dies together with the body, these idle fancies and vain
imaginings are removed at the moment of death, thus enabling the human
spirit to realize his true station and the value of his accomplishments in
life202. Bahá’u’lláh thus explains: “It is clear and evident that all men
shall, after their physical death, estimate the worth of their deeds, and
realize all that their hands have wrought.”203

In the Bahá’í Writings as well as Islamic literature we can find many
indications of links between these four human faculties and the four
divine realms. The Báb states, for example, that the language of divine
verses (áyát), which extends from the realm of Láhút, becomes
manifested in His heart (fu’ád), while that of prayers (munáyát)

originates in the realm of Jabarút and is conceived in the mirror of
reason (‘aql) which, as described above, is a faculty of the human
spirit (rúḥ). In continuation of this theme, He asserts that the language of
sermons (khuṭub) that extends from the realm of Malakút is reflected in
the mirror of the self (nafs) while that of visitation prayers (ziyárát) and
commentaries (tafasír) extends from the world of Násút and is connected
to the body.204

Another indication of this pattern of association can be found in the
description of Jabarút as the realm in which the Divine Manifestations
acquire Their true individuality,205 which, as we have seen, is a quality of
the spirit (rúḥ). Moreover, according to Islamic thought, this realm is the
dwelling place of the archangel Isráfíl whose responsibility it is to give
immortal spirits (arwáḥ) to human beings.206

The realm of Malakút is often described as an intermediary between the
higher spiritual realm of Jabarút and the physical world of Násút,207 in a
similar way in which the human soul or self (nafs) serves as an
intermediary between the spirit (rúḥ) and body (jism/jasad) of man.
Furthermore, Malakút is also described as the ‘psychic realm’ in Islamic
mysticism,208 which, again, links it to the corresponding faculty of self
that is believed to contain the human psyche. In some of His Writings
Bahá’u’llah also makes mention of the “Kingdom of His [God’s] Self
(Malakútun Nafsihi)”,209 which constitutes yet another link between the
faculty of self and the divine realm of Malakút. The human body, finally,
evidently belongs to the physical world of Násút.

As human beings apparently have no access to the worlds of Láhút and
Jabarút,210 it is primarily through the faculties of the Divine
Manifestations, however, that the links to these higher realms are
established. Ordinary human beings, on the other hand, can only enter the

spiritual realm of Malakút, which is also referred to as the ‘Abhá
Kingdom.211

The last tetrad of Creation (khalq), Sustenance (rizq), Death (mawt) and
Life (ḥayat) can be read as a description of the life of a human being. The
first component, Creation (khalq), would, following such an
interpretation, be a reference to the moment of conception at which the
new human being is created. The giving of sustenance (rizq), according to
Islamic traditions, denotes the process of ensoulment, i.e. the donation of
an immortal spirit (rúḥ) to the unborn child. The death (mawt) from
denial and life (ḥayat) in affirmation mentioned by the Báb is, according
to the Bahá’í Writings, the purpose of human existence on earth.212 Those
souls that have reached this station and, during their lifetime, have died
from the love of anything but God, will, finally, at the moment of their
death, be given eternal life by God.

These four stages in the life of an individual are, again, closely linked to
the four divine realms. The process of creation is associated with the
realm of Láhút which contains the Primal Will (Mashíyyat) of God that is
the ultimate origin of all created things. This ostensibly also holds true in
the case of the creation of a human being, as the human ability to create
and give life is ultimately nothing but a reflection of the creative power of
the Primal Will. The giving of sustenance (rizq) is, as we have already
seen, the donation of an immortal spirit by the archangel Isráfíl who can
be found in the realm of Jabarút. The death from denial and life in
affirmation that man is asked to accomplish during his earthly life entails
the detachment of his self (nafs) from the material world, his ego and
animal instincts. When this is accomplished, the human spirit is freed
from idle fancies and vain imaginings and can enter the spiritual realm of
Malakút. Finally, the moment of physical death is evidently an event that
occurs in the material world of Násút.

This association of the four tetrads mentioned in the above quotation from
the Persian Bayán with the four heavenly realms and the corresponding
stages of coming into being can be summarized as follows:

2\. The Nineteen Months and the Four Divine Realms

We have seen that the four tetrads which the Báb associates with His
quaternary of months all seem to be linked to the four realms of Láhút,
Jabarút, Malakút and Násút. This pattern of association makes it seem
reasonable to expect that the names of the months within each of the
four groups that make up this quaternary should also be related to
these same divine realms. Such an expectation is, indeed, confirmed
by a closer examination of the individual members of this quaternary:

3\. The First Three Months and the Realm of Láhút

\[213\] As already explained, the term Fate (Qaḍá’) does not only denote the fourth stage
of coming into being but also the totality of the last four stages which all occur in the
realm of Násút.

The divine names that are contained in the first member of the Báb’s
tetrad of months are Bahá’ (Splendour), Jalál (Glory) and Jamál
(Beauty). Following the schema described above, we would expect
these three names to be related to the realm of Láhút and the
associated stage of Will (Mashíyyat). According to Islamic thought,
the realm of Láhút contains the most excellent names and the most
exalted attributes of God.214 This description evidently applies to the
three names that make up the Báb’s first group of months: Bahá’, as
explained above, is regarded as the Most Great Name (Ism-i A‘ẓam)
of God while the names of Jalál and Jamál represent the total of all
active and passive or masculine and feminine attributes of God
respectively. We have also seen that the Báb associated the name of
Bahá’ with the ‘Point’ (Nuqṭih) a term that denotes the Will of God.
The name Jalál, as a representative of all active divine attributes can
also be seen as signifying the Will of God, which is the active force
that unites with the recipient entity of Purpose (Irádih) to bring about a
new creation.

The third attribute Jamál is associated with Bahá’u’lláh and, therefore,
the name Bahá’. This can be gleaned from the various references
contained in the Bahá’í Writings where Bahá’u’lláh is described as the
‘Abhá Beauty’ (Jamál-i-Abhá), the ‘Blessed’ or ‘Sacred Beauty’
(Jamál-i-Mubárak) or the ‘Blessed Perfection’ or ‘Ancient Beauty’
(Jamál-i-Qidam). As a synonym for the name Bahá’, the attribute of
Jamál is therefore also indicative of the ‘Point’.

4\. The Fourth Through Seventh Month and the Realm of Jabarút

The second member of the Báb’s tetrad of months contains the names
of ‘Aẓamat (Grandeur), Núr (Light), Raḥmat (Mercy) and Kalimát
(Words). These attributes we would expect to be related to the realm
of Jabarút and the associated stage of Purpose (Irádih). The term
‘aẓamat is often used in the Bahá’í Writings to describe the Revelation
of Bahá’u’lláh. This can be gleaned from phrases such as ‘the
greatness of this Cause’ (‘aẓamat-i-Amr), the ‘greatness of this
Revelation’ (‘aẓamat-i-Zuhúr) and the ‘greatness of the Day’
(‘aẓamat-i-Yawm). Bahá’u’lláh, furthermore, refers to Himself as the

\[214\] Milani and Fananapazir, “Pen Motif”.

‘Tongue of Grandeur’ (Lisán-i-‘Aẓamat) in various instances. Finally,
‘Aẓamat is also used in reference to Christ and God’s Manifestations
in general. As seen above, Jabarút is, in turn, the realm in which the
Divine Manifestations acquire individuality and from which their
Revelations originate. Bahá’u’lláh, therefore, also describes Himself
as the “King of the heaven of knowledge (Sultánu-i-jabarút-i-
‘irfán)”215 and frequently speaks of the “heaven of Revelation
(Jabarút-i-Amr or Jabarútu’l-Amr)”. Moreover, He makes reference to
the “heaven of [His] omnipotent glory (Jabarútu’l-‘aẓamat)” as the
realm from which the tongue of His power has addressed His
creation.216

The superlative form217 of ‘aẓamat is a‘ẓam. It is thus not surprising
that, while the attribute a‘ẓam, due to its association with the name
Bahá’ which is the Most Great Name (Ism-i A‘ẓam) of God, belongs
to the highest contingent realm of Láhút, the name of ‘aẓamat belongs
to the inferior realm of Jabarút. Núr is, likewise, an attribute that is
frequently used in the Bahá’í Writings as well as the Qur’án in
reference to the Divine Manifestations and Their Revelations, which
are both described as lights of guidance, and can, therefore, also be
associated with the realm of Jabarút from which these revelations
originate. As it happens, Núr is also the name of the province where
Bahá’u’lláh was born and which could thus be regarded as the
recipient of the Manifestation of the Will of God in a similar way in
which the stage of Purpose contained in the realm of Jabarút is the
recipient of this Will.

Raḥmat is the most feminine and thus most passive or recipient
attribute used in the Badí‘ calendar and could, therefore, be seen as
representing the recipient nature of the stage of Purpose, which is
contained within the realm of Jabarút. Kalimát, finally, is a reference
to the Word of God, and, as we have already seen, it is the coming
together of Will and Purpose, the first two stages of coming into
being, that leads to the utterance of the divine imperative BE (kun)
which, in turn, brings all of creation into being.

\[215\] See Bahá’u’lláh, Epistle 119.

\[216\] Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings 332.

\[217\] Or more strictly speaking an escalated form.

5\. The Eighth Through Thirteenth Month and the Realm of
Malakút

The third member of the Báb’s calendrical quaternary contains the
months of Kamál (Perfection), Asmá’ (Names), ‘Izzat (Might),
Mashiyyat (Will), ‘Ilm (Knowledge) and Qudrat (Power). These six
names would be expected to be connected to the realm of Malakút and
the corresponding stage of Predestination (Qadar). As already
explained, Kamál is an attribute that brings together and unites the
masculine and feminine names of God and can thus be seen as
representing the stage of Predestination which is the result of the
interaction of Will and Purpose.

Asmá’, which means names or attributes, may be seen as a reference
to the eternal archetypes (‘ayn) that exist in the realm of Malakút,
which is thus often also referred to as the “kingdom of names
(malakútu’l-asmá’)” in the Bahá’í Writings. As already explained,
these archetypes are the design plans for all created things and
therefore contain the qualities and attributes of everything within the
world of creation. While every ‘Ilm can, likewise, be seen as a
reference to these divine blueprints, as it denotes, among other things,
the knowledge that God has of His creation. The divine knowledge
(‘ilm) contained in the realm of Malakút and the stage of
Predestination can thus be interpreted as knowledge of the qualities
and attributes (‘asma) of all created things.

Mashíyyat is the Will of God. Even though this Primal Will is
contained within the realm of Láhút, it does not extend to the physical
world of Násút directly but through the intermediary worlds of Jabarút
and Malakút. From the perspective of a human being, the Will of God
thus reaches and manifests itself in the world from the lowest non-
material realm of Malakút. Moreover, the term Mashíyyat is, as
already explained, also used in the Bahá’í Writings to denote the
entire World of Command. The only realm within this world to which
ordinary human beings have access is the realm of Malakút. For this
reason, the Will of God as it exists and manifests itself within this
realm is the only form human beings can experience.

The term Qudrat (Might) can be readily linked to the realm of Malakút
and the associated stage of Qadar (Predestination), as qudrat and qadar
are both derived from the same Arabic root word. This root word
(qaddara) can be translated as (he) predetermined, considered,
measured, counted or valuated. The attribute Qudrat denotes God’s
ability to do whatsoever He wishes. God, therefore, has the ability or
power (qudrat) to predetermine (qaddara) the fate or predestination
(qadar) of all created things.

The attribute ‘Izzat, which is also translated as power or omnipotence
in the Bahá’í Writings, is practically synonymous with Qudrat. Both
of these terms thus denote the divine ability to determine the fate
(qadar) of everything contained within the realm of Násút. This divine
decree reaches the physical world from the realm of Malakút, which
ostensibly contains the stage of Predestination (Qadar).

6\. The Last Six Months and the Realm of Násút

The last group within this tetrad contains the months of Qawl
(Speech), Masá’il (Questions), Sharaf (Honour), Sulṭán (Sovereignty),
Mulk (Dominion) and ‘Alá (Loftiness). These six attributes would be
expected to be related to the realm of Násút and the corresponding
stage of Fate (Qaḍá’) and possibly also Permission (Idhn), Fixed-Time
(Ajal) and Book (Kitáb).

In the Bahá’í Writings and the Qur’án, the word qawl, in many
instances, denotes the speech or revelation of the divine Messengers or
Manifestations. This speech or revelation, evidently, occurs within the
realm of Násút and is, furthermore, closely associated with the
revelation of a holy book (kitáb). This is also the reason for the
commonly used designation of the Qur’án as the speech (qawl) of
God. The term Book, in turn, is the name of the last stage of coming
into being that is contained within the world of Násut.

The term Masá’il can be translated as questions, problems, concerns
or affairs and denotes the matters that God deals with in the world or,
in other words, His actions in the realm of Násút. In the Bahá’í
Writings, this term is, therefore, often used in reference to the
intricacies or problems of the application of the divine law and the
social issues humanity is facing, which can both only be resolved by
the Manifestations of God or their appointed successors.

The word Sharaf is only used twice in the Bahá’í Writings translated
by Shoghi Effendi, both times in reference to events that occur in the
material world. In the first reference, Bahá’u’lláh states that the
excellence (sharaf) of all things, which, in this case, refers specifically
to the actions of human beings, is dependant upon God’s bidding and
God’s word,218 and in the second, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asserts that Palestine
has become the glory (sharaf) of all nations, since it was visited by
many of the Manifestations of God.219 The term sharaf thus appears to
denote an act carried out or an object contained in the world of Násút
that has been honoured by God or His Manifestations. This
interpretation is also supported by the frequent use of another form of
this word (tasharrafa), which means to be honoured or sacralized. In
the Súrih-i-Ghuṣn, Bahá’u’lláh thus states that Beirut has been
honoured by the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá220 and the ear by
hearkening to His call.221 The Land of Syria is also said to have been
honoured by the footsteps of Bahá’u’lláh,222 and the whole world has,
likewise, been honoured by His presence.223 All of these references
thus refer to the sacralisation of things contained in the world of Násút
through the actions of God or His Manifestations.

The attribute Sulṭán does not only denote God’s sovereignty over His
creation but is also frequently used in the Qur’án in reference to the
divine authority or warrant with which God’s Messengers are sent to
earth. Moreover, Sulṭán is also the designation of a king or ruler as

\[218\] See Bahá’u’lláh, Prayers 68.

\[220\] Shoghi Effendi, World Order 136.

\[222\] Bahá’u’lláh Epistle 60.

\[223\] See, for example, ibid 44, Bahá’u’lláh, Prayers 179.

well as of a preponderate or hegemonic style of governance. This
term, therefore, signifies God’s absolute sovereignty over the world
and the divine authority with which His Manifestations appear in the
realm of Násút. A closely related term is the name of Mulk, which
denotes a dominion or kingdom. The connection to the realm of Násút
is quite obvious here, since Mulk is, as already mentioned, an
alternative designation for this realm.

The term ‘Alá’ can, finally, be seen as a reference to the detachment
from the realm of Násút which the believer demonstrates during the
month of the fast that bears this name. This attribute has, furthermore,
already been explained as a possible reference to the person of the Báb
and the early years of the formative age of the Bahá’í Faith. These
years were a time of absolute detachment from the material world that
often resulted in martyrdom. As mentioned above, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
states that the colour red is associated with the realm of Násút because
this     material    world       is   the    plane     of    martyrdom.

CONCLUSION

The Badí‘ calendar, as devised by the Báb and completed by
Bahá’u’lláh, is more than simply a system designed to help calculate
time, structure and organize human lives and commemorate events of
religious significance. Being founded upon a number of Islamic and
particularly Shaykhí ideas and theories that were adopted, expanded
and elaborated upon by the Báb, it expresses, through its structure and
organization a wealth of symbolic allusions to metaphysical,
cosmological and theological concepts of the Bábí and Bahá’í
Religions.

Furthermore, it appears to reflect and re-enact, symbolically, some of
the more significant events and phases in the early history of these
twin religions and gives some indications of their intrinsic
connectedness and interdependence as it was perceived by the Báb
and Bahá’u’lláh.

The study of this calendar can, therefore, offer fascinating insights
into various Bábí and Bahá’í doctrines and concepts, a preliminary
exploration of some of which I have tried to offer in this monograph.

NAMES OF THE BAHÁ’Í MONTHS
Bahá’ (‫ﺎء‬    ‫) ﺑ‬: Splendour. Also translated in the Bahá’í Writings
َ‫ﻬﮭ‬

as glory, light or excellence. Additional definitions are handsomeness,
shapeliness, loveliness, nicety, charm, beauty, pleasantness, prettiness,
grace, comeliness, elegance, fineness, foppery, gracefulness,
gorgeousness, glamor, goodness and pulchritude. Bahá’ is not
mentioned in the Qur’án. This attribute is also used in its superlative
(abhá’) and adjective form (bahí) in the Du’á sahar.224

Jalál (‫َﻝل‬‫) ﺟ‬: Glory. Also rendered as majesty in the Bahá’í

> ‫ﻼ‬
> َ
Writings. Alternative translations are magnificence, gravity, sublimity,
respect, reverence, solemnity, splendor, stateliness, luxuriousness,
veneration, loftiness, greatness, augustness, portliness, dignity,
grandeur, glorification, grandness and lug. In Bahá’u’lláh’s Kitáb-i-
Íqán225 Muḥammad is designated as the “King of glory (Sultán-i-
Jalál)”. In the same book and elsewhere, God is said to be hidden
behind “veils of glory (subuḥát-i-jalál)” which have been burnt or rent
asunder through the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. Jalál is mentioned
twice in the Qur’án as an attribute of God, both times in combination
with honour (al-ikrám). Jalál is also used in its superlative (ajall) and
adjective form (jalíl) in the Du’á sahar.

Jamál (‫ﺎﻝل‬َ‫ﻤ‬‫) ﺟ‬: Beauty. Also translated in the Bahá’í Writings as

َ
charm. Other definitions include comeliness, shapeliness, loveliness,
nicety, pulchritude, glory, handsomeness, fineness, grace, goodness,
gorgeousness, foppery, gracefulness, glamor and prettiness. Jamál is
the most commonly used alternative designation for Bahá’u’lláh,

\[224\] For an in-depth treatment of the meaning and significance of the name Bahá’, see
Lambden, “Bahá’” and Faizi, Explanantion.

\[225\] Bahá’u’lláh, Íqán 26.

Who is referred to as the “Abhá Beauty (Jamál-i-Abhá)” and the
“Ancient”, “Blessed” or “Sacred Beauty (Jamál-i-Mubárak)” in
numerous instances. Another one of His designations is “Jamál-i-
Qidam”, variously translated as the “Blessed Perfection” or “Ancient
Beauty”. The prophet Salih, Imám Husayn, Muḥammad and the Báb
are all identified as the “eternal”, “everlasting” or “immortal Beauty
(Jamál-i-Azalí)” in the Kitáb-i-Íqán, while the Báb is also referred to
as the “Primal Beauty (Jamálu’l-Awwalí)” in the Bahá’í Writings.
The attribute jamál is, furthermore, used to describe Christ, Imám
Ja’far-i-Ṣádiq, the Báb and the prophet Hud. Morevover, God’s
Revelation is referred to as the “Beauty of God (Jamálu’lláh)”. Jamál
is mentioned once in the Qur’án, but not as an attribute of God. Later
Islamic traditions do, however, attribute beauty to God.226 The
attribute Jamál is also used in its superlative (ajmal) and adjective
form (jamíl) in the Du’á sahar.

‘Aẓamat ( ‫َﺔ‬  ‫ﻤ‬

‫َﻈ‬‫) ﻋ‬: Grandeur. Also rendered in the Bahá’í Writings
as glory, majesty, dominion or greatness. Additional definitions
include stateliness, gravity, respect, regard, reverence, solemnity,
magnificence, loftiness, splendor, grandness, luxuriousness,
glorification, exaltation, esteem, augustness, mightiness, lug and
solemnity. Apart from its use as an attribute of God, ‘aẓamat is also
applied in the Bahá’í Writings to describe Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation in
phrases such as “the greatness of this Cause (‘aẓamat-i-Amr)”, the
“greatness of this Revelation (‘aẓamat-i-Zuhúr)” and the “greatness
of the Day (‘aẓamat-i-Yawm)”. Bahá’u’lláh, furthermore, refers to
Himself as the “Tongue of Grandeur (Lisán-i-‘Aẓamat)” in various
instances. Finally, ‘Aẓamat is also used in reference to Christ and
God’s Manifestations in general. The superlative form a‘ẓam (most
great) is associated with Bahá’u’lláh, whose name is regarded as the
“Most Great Name (Ism-i A‘ẓam)” of God and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the
“Greatest Branch (Ghusn-i-A‘ẓam)”. ‘Aẓamat is not mentioned in the
Qur’án in this but in some other forms. In the Du’á sahar, it is also
mentioned in its superlative (a`ẓam) and adjective form (aẓim).

APPENDIX I                              79

Núr (‫)ﻧﻮﺭر‬: Light. Also translated in the Bahá’í Writings as
radiance, brightness, splendour, effulgence or illumination. Additional
definitions include gleam, emergence and limelight. The word Núr is
used in reference to Muḥammad, the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh in the
Bahá’í Writings. When a person accepts the Revelation of God his
heart is said to be illumined with the knowledge of God. Mention is
also made of the light (núr) of God’s law. Moreover, many Bahá’í
principles are described as various expression of light. Examples of
this are “the light of justice (núr-i-‘adl)”, “the light of unity (núr-i-
tawḥíd)” and “the light of chastity (núr-i-‘ismat)”. Mention is also
made of “the light of divine guidance (núr-i-hidáyat)”, the “light of
certitude (núru’l-íqán)” and “the light of this Cause (núru’l-Amr)”.
Núr is mentioned 43 times in the Qur’án, eight times as an attribute of
God. The famous ‘Light Verse’227 has been the subject of many
interpretations by Islámic scholars and is also referred to and
interpreted in the Bahá’í Writings. The Qur’án and Muḥammad are
both designated as “The Light (an-Núr)”. Furthermore, light (núr) and
guidance (huda) is said to have been provided in the Torah as well as
the Gospel. Those who accept Islám are stated to have, thereby, been
guided from darkness to light, referring to the light of faith and the
darkness of disbelief and polytheism respectively. In the Qur’ánic as
well as the Biblical account of the act of creation, these two opposites
of light and darkness are said to have been separated by God.
Moreover, Núr is the title of Súrih 24 of the Qur’án. This name of God
is also used in its superlative (anwár) and adjective form (nayyír) in
the Du’á sahar.

Raḥmat ( ‫َﺔ‬  ‫َﺣ‬

> ْ
> ‫ﻤ‬ ‫) ﺭر‬: Mercy. Also rendered in the Bahá’í Writings as
blessing, grace, favor, loving kindness, providence or compassion.
Alternative definitions are tameness, tenderness, lenity, love, leniency,
kindliness, warm-heartedness, benignity, deep sympathy, affection,
clemency, commiseration, fineness, feeling, graciousness, friendliness
and care. In the Bahá’í Writings, God is “the source of infinite grace
(raḥmat)”, and His Revelation a “river of mercy”. The verses (áyát)
of Bahá’u’lláh are thus also a manifestation of the “divine mercy
(raḥmat-i-rabbání)”. Raḥmat is used 63 times in the Qur’án, 56 times

\[227\] See Qur’án 24:35.

in reference to God. The Qur’án was sent down as a guidance (huda)
and mercy (raḥmat) from God, and so was the Torah. Muḥammad was
also sent to earth as a mercy to the servants of God. Other forms of
this word (esp. Raḥmán and Raḥím, which are the two divine
attributes mentioned in the Basmalah) are used hundreds of times in
the Qur’án. In the Du’á sahar, God’s mercy is described twice as all-
embracing (‘awsa).

Kalimát ( ‫َﺎﺓة‬ ‫َﻠ‬

> ِ
> ‫ﻤ‬ ‫) ﻛ‬: Words. Also translated in the Bahá’í Writings
as sayings and writings, terms, utterance, the Word of God, entities or
talk. Further renderings of the singular form (kalimat) are speech,
address, letter, note, disquisition, dispatch, say, conception, concept,
view, notion, announcement, statement and vocable. The “Word of
God (Kalimatu’l-lláh)” is of central importance for Islamic and Bahá’í
theology. It is the divine creative impulse and the Divine Elixir (Iksír)
that can convert “satanic strength into heavenly power”.228
Bahá’u’lláh, furthermore, asserts that the knowledge of one word
(kalimat) lies within the Treasury of His wisdom, which, if revealed to
mankind, would cause everyone to recognize His station.229 Kalimat is
mentioned 20 times in the Qur’án, 13 times in reference to the Word
of God. By the Word from God ‘Be’ (kun) creation came into being.
The term kalimat is also used in the Qur’án in reference to God’s
decree or judgment, e.g. God’s “Word of punishment (kalimatu’l-
‘adhábi)”230 . In the Du’á sahar, God’s words are described as
complete (támmat) and as most perfect (atamm).

Kamál (‫ﺎﻝل‬   ‫) ﻛ‬: Perfection. Also rendered in the Bahá’í Writings
َ‫ﻤ‬

َ
as excellence, fullness, consummation or maturity. Additional
definitions include exemplariness, entirety, completeness, completion,
conclusion, perfectibility, totality and wholeness. The Bahá’í Writings
contain many references to God’s perfection (kamál). In the Kitáb-i-
Íqán,231 Bahá’u’lláh, moreover, states that He is wholly (kamál)
resigned to God’s will, and the Báb states that the ultimate perfection
(kamál) of His Bayán will only become apparent with the revelation of

Him Whom God shall make manifest. Kamál is used twice in the
Qur’án, but not as an attribute of God. Later Islamic thought and
traditions do, however, attribute kamál to God.233 The attribute kamál
is also used in its superlative (akmal) and adjective form (kamíl) in the
Du’á sahar.

Asmá’ ( ‫َﺎء‬    ‫) ﺍاﺳ‬: Names. Also translated in the Bahá’í Writings as

> ْ
> ‫ﻤ‬
titles, attributes or designations. Further renderings include nouns and
substantives. God is designated in the Bahá’í Writings as the “King”
or “Lord of Names” (Maliku’l-Asmá’ or Sulṭánu’l-Asmá’)”, as He
possesses and is the Origin and Creator of all attributes. Reference is
also made in various instances to the “kingdom of names (malakútu’l-
asmá’)”, the realm in which all of those attributes become manifest.
While every created thing is said to mirror forth one of the names of
God, the human soul is potentially capable of reflecting all of them.
This potential is, however, only fully expressed in the Divine
Manifestations Who are the perfect mirrors of all the names and
attributes of God. Asmá’ is mentioned eight times in the Qur’án, four
times as an attribute of God Who is said to have the “most beautiful
names (al-Asmá’u’l-ḥusna)”.234 At Qur’án 2:31, God teaches Adam
“all names” or the “natures of all things (al-asmá’a kullahá)”.
According to Islamic thought, the Qur’án contains 99 names of God,
while the hundredth is His “Most Great Name (Ismu'l-a‘ẓam)”. For
Bahá’ís the name Bahá’, which is not mentioned in the Qur’án, is this
Most Great Name of God. In the Du’á sahar, God’s names are
described as great (kabír) and most great (akbar).

‘Izzat ( ‫ﱠﺓة‬

> ‫) ﻋ‬: Might. Also rendered in the Bahá’í Writings as glory,
> ِ
> ‫ﺰ‬
power, exaltation, honour, majesty, grandeur, pomp, strength,
sovereignty or magnificence. Other possible translations are arrogance
and pride, but it can also mean to be precious or dearly loved. In the
Kitáb-i-Íqán,235 every Prophet is said to have “winged His flight unto
the heights of glory (‘izzat). Bahá’u’lláh asserts that God has seized

power (‘izzat ) from kings and ecclesiastics236 and, in the Persian
Hidden Words,237 states that man has chosen boundless shame for
himself even though God had chosen for him imperishable glory
(‘izzat). ‘Izzat is mentioned twelve times in Qur’án, four times as an
attribute of God to whom belongs all honour.238 It is, moreover, used
very frequently in other grammatical forms. The attribute ‘Izzat is also
used in its superlative (a’azza) and adjective form (‘azíz) in the Du’á
sahar.

Mashíyyat (‫َﺔ‬  ‫ﻴﯿ‬

> ِ
> ‫َﺸ‬ ‫) ﻣ‬: Will. Also translated in the Bahá’í Writings as
purpose, wish, the Primal Will, the Will of God, bidding, pleasure or
desire. The Will of God (Mashíyyatu’l-lláh) in Islamic and Bahá’í
thought is primarily a metaphysical realm, the first creation of God
through which all other things come into being. Nevertheless, it can
also refer to God’s plan for His creatures,239 which finds expression in
the laws that govern the physical as well as spiritual worlds.
Bahá’u’lláh repeatedly states that the verses He has revealed have
been sent down from the “heaven of the Will of God”.240 The term
mashíyyat is not used in the Qur’án, but the corresponding verb
(yashá’) appears numerous times most commonly in reference to the
Will of God. In the Du’á sahar, God’s will is described as conclusive
(máḍiyat) and most conclusive (amḍá).

‘Ilm (‫ْﻢ‬  ‫) ﻋ‬: Knowledge. Also rendered in the Bahá’í Writings as

> ‫ﻠ‬
> ِ
wisdom, divine knowledge, science, attainments, learning, discerning,
revelation or understanding. Other meanings include familiarity,
know-how, lore, noticing, vigilance, carefulness, apprehension,
acquaintance,      recognition,      consciousness,    comprehension,
conversance, cognizance, erudition, versedness, expert's advice, and
cognition. In the Bahá’í Writings, knowledge is of two kinds: Divine
(Ilahí) and satanic (shayṭání).241 The former is the knowledge of God
that is revealed through His Manifestations. These Manifestations are

the repositories of divine knowledge, and from Them God has
“caused to proceed the knowledge (‘ilm) of all that was and shall
be”.242 Bahá’u’lláh thus asserts that when He received His Revelation
in the Síyáh-Chál” the “breezes of the All-Glorious” taught Him the
“knowledge of all that hath been”.243 According to an Islamic
tradition quoted in the Kitáb-i-Íqán,244 this divine knowledge is said to
consist of 27 letters, only two of which were revealed to mankind by
the Manifestations of God that preceded the Báb. Satanic knowledge,
on the other hand, signifies the idle fancies and vain imaginings that
the divines erroneously believe to be true knowledge.245 This latter
type of knowledge can, therefore, act as a veil (subaḥát) preventing
man from recognizing the Divine Manifestations. Nevertheless, the
acquisition of knowledge is incumbent upon everyone, as it has the
potential to become like “wings to man’s life”.246 ‘Ilm is mentioned
104 times in the Qur’án, frequently in reference to God, Who is said to
have full knowledge of all things.247 The term is also used in reference
to the knowledge imparted to man through Muḥammad and the
Qur’án. God’s knowledge is described as penetrating (náfid) and most
acute (anfad) in the Du’á sahar.

Qudrat ( ‫َﺓة‬‫ﺭر‬

> ‫ُﺪ‬
> ْ  ‫) ﻗ‬: Power. Also translated in the Bahá’í Writings as
might, potency, strength, authority, dominion, celestial might,
omnipotence, transcendent power, influence, indomitable strength, all-
pervading power, ascendancy or divine power. Additional meanings
include force, faculty, ability, capacity, capability, thew and violence.
In the Bahá’í Writings, one of the designations of God is the “Ancient
Power (Qudrat-i-Qadím)”. The word Qudrat is most commonly used
to describe God’s unlimited ability to act in the world. This divine
power of action is often expressed through the metaphor of the Hand
(Persian: dast, Arabic: yad) of Power or Omnipotence (Qudrat). It is
thus, for example, the “Hand of Divine power” that can, alone, deliver
mankind from the desolating affliction of religious fanaticism and

hatred, and it is within the grasp of God’s power that all things in
heaven and earth lie.249 Qudrat is not mentioned in this form in the
Qur’án, but other derivatives of the same root are used numerous
times. The adjective qadír (all-powerful), for example, is applied in
many instances to describe God’s ability or power to do whatsoever he
wishes. The term decree (qadr) is derived from the same root, a
secondary meaning of which is to measure. God’s power is described
as all-subduing (mustatílat) in the Du’á sahar

Qawl (‫ْﻝل‬  ‫) ﻗ‬: Speech. Also rendered in the Bahá’í Writings as

> ‫ﻮ‬
saying, words, pretension, request, testimony or discourse. Other
possible meanings include notion, opinion, view, concept, say,
utterance, talk, speaking, colloquy, conversation, yarn and statement.
Qawl is used more or less synonymously with kalimát in the Bahá’í
Writings. The Báb states that “the Bayán and whosoever is therein
revolve round the saying (qawl) of Him Whom God shall make
manifest” in the same way in which the Gospel “revolved round the
saying of Muḥammad”.250 Qawl is mentioned 92 times in the Qur’án,
often in reference to the Word of God and His Revelation (through the
speech of Muḥammad). The term is also used in reference to God’s
law and the Qur’án, which is the Word that separates truth from
falsehood.251 In the Du’á sahar God’s speech is described as pleasing
(radíy) and most delightful (ardá).

Masá’il ( ‫ِﺋﻞ‬  ‫َﺴ‬
> ‫ﺎ‬ ‫) ﻣ‬: Questions. Also translated in the Bahá’í
Writings as problems, principles, truths, matters, mysteries, subtleties,
obscurities or intricacies. Additional definitions include affairs and
concerns. In the Kitáb-i-Íqán, Bahá’u’lláh asserts that the divines
falsely claim to know the subtleties (masá’il) of God’s law and that
the people should thus rather seek guidance concerning abstruse
matters (masá’il) of Faith from the Divine Manifestations. According
to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Bahá’í teachings are the most perfect solutions to
the world’s “social problems (masá’íl-i-ijtimá’iyy)”,252 and in His

Will and Testament the Universal House of Justice is charged with the
responsibility to resolve all “difficult problems”.253 As a divine
attribute, masá’il thus signifies the matters or affairs that God decrees
and deals with in the world as well as the intricate theological and
legal subtleties that only the Divine Manifestations are able and
authorized to explain. This name of God is not mentioned in the
Qur’án. God’s questions are described as beloved (habíb) and most
agreeable (ahabb) in the Du’á sahar.

Sharaf (‫َﻑف‬ ‫) ﺷ‬: Honour. Also rendered in the Bahá’í Writings as

> ‫ﺮ‬
excellence or glory. Other definitions include uprightness,
virtuousness, righteousness, rectitude, integrity, honesty, goodness,
correctness, kudos, high repute, eminence and nobility. Bahá’u’lláh
states that the excellence (sharaf) of all things is dependant upon
God’s bidding and God’s word.254 According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
Palestine has become the glory (sharaf) of all nations, since it was
visited by many of the Manifestations of God.255 Sharaf is not
mentioned in the Qur’án. The attribute sharaf is also used in its
adjective form (sharíf) in the Du’á sahar.

Sulṭán ( ‫َﺍاﻥن‬

> ◌
‫ْﻂ‬‫) ﺳ‬: Sovereignty. Also translated in the Bahá’í

> ُ
> ‫ﻠ‬
Writings as king, lord, shah, majesty, sovereign, monarch, authority,
potency, the power of sovereignty, the All-Possessing, he who ruleth
or the most potent of rulers. Other meanings include potentate, chief,
ruler, governor, tyranny, grip, rule, totalitarianism, predominance,
supreme power or authority, command, clout, control, imperiousness,
influence, leverage, ascendancy, absolutism, abuse, preponderant
governing, hegemony, warrant and permission. In the Bahá’í Writings,
numerous designations of God include the term Sulṭán. Among them
are the “Ancient (or King) of Days (Sulṭán-i-Qidam)”, the “King of
the seen and unseen”, the “King of Revelation (Sulṭánu’ẓ-Ẓuhúr)”,
the “King of Names (Sulṭánu’l-Asmá’)” and the “King of Kings”. The
Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh is, at times, designated as the “King of
Days (Sulṭánu’l-Ayyám)”.256 Sulṭán is mentioned 37 times in the

\[253\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Will and Testament 20.

\[254\] Bahá’u’lláh, Prayers 68.

\[255\] Cited in Shoghi Effendi, Citadel 27

\[256\] See, for example, Bahá’u’lláh, Prayers 117.

Qur’án, where it is a great sin to lay claims to authority without any
warrant, permission or authority (sulṭán) from God. Only God’s
messengers such as Moses, Aaron and Muḥammad have been sent by
God with “manifest” or “clear authority (sulṭánun mubín)”. Satan
only has power or authority (sulṭán) over those who obey and follow
him. In the Qur’án, sulṭán thus primarily refers to the authority with
which God’s Messengers have been invested. God’s sovereignty is
described as enduring (dá'im) and most permanent (adwam) in the
Du’á sahar.

Mulk (‫ْﻚ‬   ‫) ﻣ‬: Dominion. Also rendered in the Bahá’í Writings as

> ‫ﻠ‬
> ُ
sovereignty, empire, kingdom, realm, universe, this world or the land
wherein one dwelleth. Further translations are dominance, command,
clout, rule, power, reign, property, ownership and holding. In the
Persian Hidden Words,257 we are warned not to abandon an
everlasting dominion (mulk) for things which perish, and in the Kitáb-
i-Íqán,258 the leaders of religion, in any age, are said to have deprived
themselves of an everlasting sovereignty (mulk) by having rejected
God’s Prophets. In His Kitáb-i-Aqdás,259 Bahá’u’lláh, furthermore,
states that anyone who has tasted of the sweetness of servitude to God
will “refuse to barter it for all dominion (mulk) of earth and heaven”.
In some instances Mulk is used synonymously with Násút in
references to the material world. Mulk is mentioned 46 times in the
Qur’án. According to this book, God’s is the kingdoms of heaven and
earth, and the sovereignty will be God’s on the Day of Judgment.260
God is also stated to have given their kingdoms to Abraham, Saul,
David and Solomon and has bestowed sovereignty (mulk) on
Muḥammad. 261 Another form of this word is malik (king), which is
also used as an attribute of God in both the Bahá’í Writings and the
Qur’án. In the Du’á sahar, God’s dominion is described as excellent or
magnificent (fákhir) and most magnificent (afkhar).

\[260\] See, Qur’án 22:26 and 25:26.

\[261\] See, Qur’án 12:101.
‘Alá’ (‫َء‬   ‫) ﻋ‬: Loftiness. Also translated as glory in the Bahá’í

> ‫ﻼ‬
Writings. Other meanings include exaltation, dignity, elevation,
sublimity, transcendence and high or noble rank. ‘Alá’ is not
mentioned frequently in the officially translated Bahá’í literature, but
other derivatives of the same root word are. One example of this is the
form a‘lá’ that is frequently used in the context of teaching the Faith,
an activity which is described as the exaltation (a‘lá’) of God’s word
or Cause. ‘Alá’ is mentioned twice in the Qur’án in reference to God
although in a slightly different spelling (without the final hamzih).
Moreover, it appears quite frequently in other forms, for example in
the phrase “Exalted be He” (ta’álá) which is habitually added by pious
Muslims when mentioning the name of God.262 The superlative form
a‘lá (most lofty or most exalted) of this word, furthermore, forms the
name of Súrih 87 of the Qur’án. The attribute ‘alá’ is derived from the
word `ulúww (loftiness, elevation) mentioned in the Du’á sahar where
it is also used in its superlative (a‘lá) and adjective (‘ál) forms.
