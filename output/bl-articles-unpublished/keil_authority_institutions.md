Abstract

Text analysis is a form of exegesis which focusses on the internal cohesion of a
complete text: not merely an investigation of individual isolated sentences and
passages, but a systematic analysis which accommodates the linguistic character
of the text as a whole and takes context into account. The subject of the present
study is ‘Abdu’l-Bahaā ’s Will and Testament, which is subjected to a detailed
investigation with regard to the institutions of the present-day Bahaā 'īā Admini-
strative Order, giving due consideration to pertinent statements elsewhere from
‘Abdu’l-Bahaā , Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice. The view is
substantiated that, through this methodology, the competencies and areas of
responsibility of the various institutions described in the Will and Testament
present themselves in a considerably more differentiated manner than is the
case when the same text is read uncritically and its content subordinated to the
expectations of the reader.

Zusammemfassung

Die Textanalyse ist eine Form der Exegese, die die innere Kohaä renz eines
Gesamttextes im Auge hat: Ziel ist nicht nur eine Untersuchung einzelner
isolierter Saä tze und Passagen, sondern vielmehr eine systematische Analyse, die
den sprachlichen Gesamtcharakter des Textes beruä cksichtigt und dem Kontext
Rechnung traä gt. Gegenstand der vorliegenden Analyse ist das Testament 'Abdu'l-
Bahaā s, das in Hinblick auf die Institutionen der gegenwaä rtigen Bahaā 'īā-
Gemeindeordnung und unter Beruä cksichtigung einschlaä giger Aussagen 'Abdu'l-
Bahaā s, Shoghi Effendis und des Universalen Hauses der Gerechtigkeit einer
detaillierten Untersuchung unterzogen wird. Es stellt sich heraus, dass durch
diese Methodik die im Testament dargestellten Kompetenzen und
Zustaä ndigkeitsbereiche der verschiedenen Koä rperschaften der Gemeinde-
ordnung wesentlich differenzierter in Erscheinung treten, als dies bei einer
unkritischen und durch Vorverstaä ndnisse gesteuerten Lektuä re des gleichen
Textes der Fall ist.

1    Introduction

The Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahaā 2 is the cornerstone of the Bahaā ’īā
Administrative Order, “that Charter of Bahaá ’u’llaá h’s New World Order, the
offspring resulting from the mystic intercourse between Him Who is the Source
of the Law of God and the mind of the One Who is the vehicle and interpreter of
that Law.”3 As such it is the indispensable starting-point for every investigation
of the Bahaā ’īā Administrative Order.

Since its first public reading on 3rd January 1922 4 ‘Abdu’l-Bahaā ’s Will and
Testament of has been frequently discussed,5 among others by Hands of the
Cause of God and members of the Universal House of Justice. Excerpts from it
have appeared in countlesss books and articles as well as in numerous state-
ments by the Universal House of Justice. One might think that it would be
sufficient to place one’s trust in the powers of reasoning of those competent,
trustworthy and commendable individuals and institutions which have busied
themselves with the Will and Testament over the past near-century, and to
cherish the actual document as a monument or an icon rather than as an object
of personal study.

There are good reasons, however, why an individual Bahaā ’īā should examine the
content of the Will and Testament for himself. First and foremost is his duty to
achieve familiarity with the holy writings, the obligation of each and every
believer to engage in independent investigation of truth. ‛Abdul-Bahaā explains
that

> … God has created in man the power of reason, whereby man is enabled
> to investigate reality. God has not intended man to imitate blindly his
> fathers and ancestors. He has endowed him with mind, or the faculty of
> reasoning, by the exercise of which he is to investigate and discover the

The former member of the House of Justice David Hofman astutely observed:

It is not so much a question of whether or not one may place one’s trust in the
understanding which has been passed down, but rather the fact that one is
enjoined to form one’s own judgement.

A second good reason lies in the fact that reading the Will and Testament
imparts a wealth of impressions concerning the history of the emergence of the
Bahaā ’īā Religion — of the trials which beset ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā , and in particular of the
manner in which He addressed and in the end mastered these trials. The Will
and Testament is an eyewitness account of the events during a crucial period of
the still very young Faith.

In the present paper a further aspect emerges. To the best of my knowledge
there exists to date not a single text analysis of the Will and Testament of ‛Abdu’l-
Bahaā which deals with the institutions existing today. 9 By ‘text analysis’ I mean
not merely an investigation of individual isolated sentences and passages, but a
systematic analysis which accommodates the linguistic character of the text as a
whole and which takes context into account. Many statements can be found in

print regarding the meaning of individual sentences and passages in the Will and
Testament, but quotations typically appear bereft of context, and as such they
reveal much about the personal opinions being expounded but very little about
the content of the Will and Testament itself. Hofman comes close to a text
analysis, at least in the sense that he deals with the complete text, and he orients
the structure of his presentation on the Will and Testament’s own organisation.
But his investigation concentrates mainly on a description of the content, and he
does not delve very deeply into the linguistic character of the text.

Admittedly, the present analysis does not cover every topic mentioned in the
Will and Testament. The intrigues of the Covenant-breakers10 and the prayers
and supplications of ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā interspersed in the text are mentioned at best
peripherally, and diverse topics such as the payment of Huquā qu’llaā h, the
obligation to teach, the shunning of Covenant-breakers and the election of the
House of Justice are not dealt with at all. In order to restrain the size of an
already voluminous paper, the analysis of the functions of the various institu-
tions is restricted to those aspects which are still relevant today. Thus the areas
of duty and responsibility of the Hands of the Cause of God and of the Aghsaā n
and Afnaā n are not dealt with at all, and remarks concerning the competencies of
the Guardianship are restricted to those aspects which interact with the
authority of the Universal House of Justice. That having been said, all text
passages which have any bearing at all on the themes discussed are dealt with:
not a single word or phrase in the Will and Testament is glossed over — this my
pledge to the reader — on the grounds that it disturbs the analysis.

Of the three parts of the Will and Testament, the first is the most extensive and
at the same time the least structured. Of the second part, only paragraphs 2:8
and 2:9 are of immediate relevance for the present paper. These two paragraphs,
which concentrate exclusively on the competencies of the Universal House of
Justice, serve to complement and elaborate topics already introduced in the first
part, in particular in paragraphs 1:17 and 1:25. As far as the description of the
tasks and duties of the House of Justice is concerned, the arrangement of the

second part is markedly more systematic, and this part lends itself both to the
contextualisation and to the clarification of corresponding statements in the first
part.11 The third part, which exhibits a structure of its own, will be discussed in
Chapter 9 of this paper.

It is recommended that, while perusing this paper, the reader have the
complete text of ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā ’s Will and Testament at hand so that he or she may
examine all quotations in their respective context.

Besides serving as content identification of the successive chapters, the
headings in what follows are verbatim expressions from the text of the Will and
Testament which demand thoroughgoing investigation.

2    Not expressly recorded in the Book

The expression ‘not expressly recorded in the Book’ occurs three times in quick
succession in the second part of the Will and Testament, once in paragraph 2:8
and twice in paragraph 2:9, with slightly varying wording but in each case as the
rendition of the unvarying Persian-language expression gheyr-e manṣūṣeh12 in
the original text. The variation in the wording of the English-language version is
purely stylistic and does not in itself indicate a change in meaning. The three
passages are as follows:

> Unto the Most Holy Book every one must turn and all that is not expressly
> recorded therein (gheyr-e manṣūṣeh) must be referred to the Universal
> House of Justice. (2:8)
> It is incumbent upon these members to gather in a certain place and
> deliberate upon all problems which have caused difference, questions
> that are obscure and matters that are not expressly recorded in the Book
> (gheyr-e manṣūṣeh). (2:9)
> And inasmuch as this House of Justice hath power to enact laws that are

11 Alone from the fact that ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā obviously considered the extension of the Will and

> Testament to be necessary indicates that this part (that is, paragraphs 2:8 und 2:9) is to
> be understood as clarification and elucidation of the text already in existence.
12 The original text consists of a mixture of Arabic and Persian. Whereas the difference in

> pronunciation between the two is mirrored in the transcription with respect to vocali-
> sation, the consonants consistently follow the written Arabic in order to differentiate in
writing between phonetically identical sounds in spoken Persion.

> not expressly recorded in the Book (gheyr-e manṣūṣeh) and bear upon
> daily transactions, so also it hath power to repeal the same. (2:9)
As indicated by its root form, the term manṣūṣeh denotes the content of a
written document (cf. Arab. naṣṣ, ‘wording’, also ‘text’, particularly in religious
[Islamic and Bahaā ’īā] context: revealed, holy, authoritative text13). Shoghi Effendi
translates manṣūṣeh as the Book or the Most Holy Book.14

The expression gheyr-e manṣūṣeh is formally negative: it indicates what is not
being referred to. Beyond its primary function of excluding the Most Holy Book
from the intended spectrum of meaning, this ‘everything-but’ statement con-
tributes nothing to the closer understanding of the text. The intention behind
this choice of words first becomes evident in connexion with paragraph 1:16, in
which ‘Abdu’l-Bahaā describes the area of responsibility of the Guardian:

> He [the Guardian of the Faith] is the expounder of the words of God
> (mobayyen-e āyātu’llāh) … (1:16)
Āyāt is generally translated as ‘verse’, often as (divine, holy) ‘text’, occasionally
also as ‘writings’.15 The expressions āyātu’llāh and āyāt-e ketāb serve to describe
that which has been recorded in the writings of the Baā b and Bahaā ’u’llaā h.

13 There are seven occurrences in the Will and Testament: taṣrīḥ be-naṣṣ-e qāṭe‛ (despite the

> firm exhortations and counsels) [1:4], be-naṣṣ-e āyeh-ye mubārakeh-ye thābeteh (unto the
> Text of the clear and firmly established blessed verse) [1:5], īn naṣṣ ‘ebārat-e mīrzā shu‘ā‘
> dar maktūbast keh marqūm dāshteh (The following are his [Shu‘aā ‘u’llaā h’s] very words
> written by him in this letter) [1:9], be-naṣṣ-e qāṭe‛eh-ye elāhī (in accordance with the
> decisive words of God) [1:11], mānand-e nāṣṣ (the same effect as the Text itself) [2:9],
> naṣṣ-e ṣarīḥ-e elāhī (part of the Divine Explicit Text) [2:9], be-naṣṣ-e elāhī (according to
> the explicit Divine Text) [2:11], along with four in the plural: thrice noṣūṣ-e elāhī (sacred
> command of God) [1:8], (Holy Text) [1:25], (Holy Writ) [3:8] and once īn noṣūṣ-e qāṭe‛eh
> (decisive words) [1:8].
14 … neben manṣūṣ (Sacred Text) [2:10]. The term manṣūṣeh occurs only in the expression

gheyr-e manṣūṣeh.
15 The word occurs numerous times in the text: mīthāqahu ath-thābit bi-āyātin bayyinātin

> (established firmly by His clear and manifest words) [1:1], āyāt-e towḥīd (verses of His
> Divine Unity) [1:3], az āyāt-e bayyenāt (to His manifest verses) [1:4], āyāt-e ketāb (the
> Holy Text) [1:5], āyāt-e moḥkamāt (the firm and conclusive verses) [1:5], āyāt (the
> verses) [1:5], āyāt (2x) (the Sacred Text) [1:6], āyāt va kalemāt va makāteb (the Holy
> Writings and Epistles) [1:6], maẓāhir āyātika’l-bayyināti (manifestations of Thy glorious
> Signs) [1:12], bi-āyātin nāzilatin min malakūti tafrīdika (with the verses revealed from
> Thy Holy Kingdom) [1:12], āyātu’llāh (the words of God) [1:16], tantashira’l-āyātu’l-
> bayyināt (Thy manifest Signs be spread abroad) [2:2], kafara bi-āyātika’l-kubrā bi-mā
> anẓaltahu bi-ḥaqqi ‘abdika’l-maẓlūmi fī’l-āfāq (He did also maliciously insert … into what
Thou didst reveal for this servant of Thine that hath been wronged in this world) [2:4].

Since the Guardian, and only he, has been designated to be the expounder of
the word of God, and since the expression ‘not expressly recorded in the Book’
occurs solely in the context of the competencies of the House of Justice — as will
be illustrated in the following — one may conclude on the basis of the text
passages already encountered that the expressions gheyr-e manṣūṣeh and
mobayyen-e āyātu’llāh serve to define the categorical boundaries of the mutually
exclusive areas of responsibility of the House of Justice on the one side and the
Guardian on the other. With explicit reference to the passages in the Will and
Testament in which these two key phrases occur, Shoghi Effendi explains:

> From these statements it is made indubitably clear and evident that the
> Guardian of the Faith has been made the Interpreter of the Word and that
> the Universal House of Justice has been invested with the function of
> legislating on matters not expressly revealed in the teachings. The
> interpretation of the Guardian, functioning within his own sphere, is as
> authoritative and binding as the enactments of the International House of
> Justice, whose exclusive right and prerogative is to pronounce upon and
> deliver the final judgment on such laws and ordinances as Bahaá 'u'llaá h has
> not expressly revealed.16

This situation offers a perspicuous explanation as to why ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā made use
of this negative form of expression: with just these two words gheyr-e manṣūṣeh
He focusses His remarks exclusively on the responsibilities of the House of
Justice and at the same time excludes the area of responsibility of the Guardian
from the discussion. That is economy of expression at its finest. As will be made
clear in the following, however, the specific meaning of this expression must be
gleaned in each instance from the context in which it occurs.

3    The Truth and the Purpose of God Himself

The expression gheyr-e manṣūṣeh occurs for the first time in paragraph 2:8:

> Unto the Most Holy Book (ketāb-e aqdas) every one must turn and all that
> is not expressly recorded therein (gheyr-e manṣūṣeh) must be referred to
> the Universal House of Justice. (2:8)
Clearly it is not always easy to determine in any given instance whether or not
16 Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, Wilmette, IL: Bahaá ’ī á Publishing Trust,
1982, p. 149–150.

this condition applies,17 but the distinguishing criterion itself is unequivocal. The
reference to the Most Holy Book subsumes all commandments and regulations
in the Kitāb-i Aqdas plus those in other holy writings which Bahaā ’u’llaā h has
designated as being parts thereof, such as Questions and Answers and the eighth
Ishrāq, although the fact that Shoghi Effendi also renders the expression ‘the
Most Holy Book’ (ketāb-e aqdas) as ‘the teachings’ (cf. the passage from The
World Order of Bahā’u’llāh cited above) appears to imply that the implied corpus
is not strictly confined to the these writings.

It is evident that the ‘everything-but’ clause cannot simply refer here to
‘everything under the sun.’18 The House of Justice is, for example, no more
responsible for major life decisions of individual believers (education,
profession, marriage etc.) than for the conduct of their everyday lives. But what
could it mean otherwise? As we will see, ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā ’s answer to this question
lies in the sentence immediately following:

> That which this body … doth carry, that is verily the Truth and the
> Purpose of God Himself.19 (2:8)
With reference to the House of Justice, this passage is a confirmation and
clarification of that which had already been stated in the first part of the Will and
Testament:

> The … Guardian of the Cause of God, as well as the Universal House of
> Justice, … are both under the care and protection of the Abhaá Beauty,
> under the shelter and unerring guidance of the Exalted One 20 …
> Whatsoever they decide is of God. (1:17)
Now it is true that Oriental and in particular Persian narrative style exhibits a
distinct tendency towards hyperbole, a fact which must always be taken into

17 This difficulty will be taken up in detail further on in this chapter and again in Chapter 5,

Daily transactions.
18 The expression ‘all that is not expressly recorded therein must be referred to the

> Universal House of Justice’ is clearly not meant to describe the scope of the competency of
> the Universal House of Justice; rather, it makes clear that dealing with matters in the
> sense of paragraph 2:8 is the exclusive right and responsibility of the Universal House of
> Justice (cf. 1:25: “It enacteth all ordinances and regulations that are not to be found in the
> explicit Holy Text”).

20 The phrase ‘under the shelter and unerring guidance of the Exalted One’ will be discussed
in its own chapter later on in this paper.

account when interpreting Bahaá ’ī á scripture, including these two passages.
Indeed, not a few Persian-speaking believers are of the opinion that the
statement ‘That which this body, whether unanimously or by a majority doth
carry, that is verily the Truth and the Purpose of God Himself’ merely indicates
that decisions which have been reached by majority vote are no less valid than
unanimous decisions, and that this statement has nothing directly to do with
matters of truth and divine will in a literal sense. Similarly, it is held that the
statement ‘Whatever they decide is of God’ merely confirms the legitimacy and
authority of the Guardian and the House of Justice. However, such an interpre-
tation ignores a crucial exegetical factor: the communicative intent of the author.
In the case of texts which are by nature mystic, proclamatory, visionary or
edifying, such expressions frequently carry pictorial, symbolic or allegorical
meanings, often with allusions to concepts and images from their religious or
cultural/literary environment. The profundity of the message often lies precisely
in the intended ambiguity of the text, which engages each individual reader at
the stage which he happens to have reached in his personal spiritual
development. A ḥadīth says: "We speak one word, and by it we intend one and
seventy meanings.”21 When dealing with commandments, directives and
instructions, however — in other words, with texts which can only fulfil their
purpose when they are capable of being understood by every reader in the same
manner — a literal interpretation which yields a sensible and comprehensible
reading of the text should be preferred in principle. What is more, the literary
style of a single document can vary strongly in accordance with the momentary
literary goal. The reader is invited to compare for example the emotionality of
the following passages from the Will and Testament with the more matter-of-
fact language style of those passages in which ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā is concerned with
specifying instructions for the continuity of the leadership of the Cause following
His passing:

> Ten thousand souls have shed streams of their sacred blood in this path,
> their precious lives they offered in sacrifice unto Him, hastened wrapt in
> holy ecstasy unto the glorious field of martyrdom, upraised the Standard
> of God’s Faith and writ with their life-blood upon the Tablet of the world
> the verses of His Divine Unity. (1:3)

21 Zitiert in Bahaā 'u'llaā h, The Kitáb-i-Íqán, Wilmette, IL: Bahaá ’īá Publishing Trust, 1983, §2:182.

> Every dart he seized and hurled to pierce the breast of this wronged
> servant, no wound did he neglect to grievously inflict upon me, no venom

> O God, my God! Thou seest this wronged servant of Thine, held fast in the
> talons of ferocious lions, of ravening wolves, of bloodthirsty beasts. (1:10)
By contrast, paragraphs 1:17, 1:25, 2:8 und 2:9 — in other words, those para-
graphs which set out the competencies of the Universal House of Justice — are
decidedly prosaic in tone. Even in the imprecations in 1:17 and in the first part of
paragraph 2:8, in which He describes the life-threatening predicament in which
He finds himself, ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā allows no ambiguity to arise. Hyperbole is neither
appropriate nor necessary in these passages. Only in the case of lamentations
such as those cited above, and when exposing defectors, does ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā
resort to a more emphatic form of expression. In short, it is hermeneutically
extremely problematic to dismiss the expression ‘the Truth and the Purpose of
God Himself’ in paragraph 2:8 as a mere literary device. It is my conviction that,
to the contrary, this expression is to be taken at face value: ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā is really
and truly referring to divinely ordained, truth-bearing decisions of the Universal
House of Justice. This understanding is in accordance with that of the Universal
House of Justice:

> Bahaā 'u'llaā h, the Founder of the Bahaā 'īā Faith, made a Covenant with His
> followers to direct and channel the forces released by His Revelation,
> guaranteeing the continuity of infallible guidance after His death through
> institutions to which all of His followers must turn. … ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā
> asserts in His Will and Testament that “… That which this body [the
> Universal House of Justice] … doth carry, that is verily the Truth and the
> Purpose of God Himself.” Thus the fundamental purpose of the Universal
> House of Justice is to ensure the continuity of the divine guidance that
> flows from the Source of the Faith.22

However, the idea that absolutely every decision of the House of Justice is
infallible implies that the scope of its inerrancy is limitless. The House of Justice
has declared this proposition to be untenable,23 thereby rejecting, in its own
estimation, any reading of the Will and Testament whereby the predicate ‘the
Truth and the Purpose of God Himself’ literally covers everything ‘which this
body doth carry.’24 Furthermore, this perception is in compliance with common
sense. Is, for example, a document published by the House of Justice just as
inerrant as a subsequently published list of errata it contains, or a translation
just as error-free as a subsequently revised version (as occurred with Summons
of the Lord of Hosts25)? And quite apart from epistemological considerations: is it
prudent to present empirically verifiable, i. e. falsifiable, assertions as infallible
and thereby expose oneself to the danger of being contradicted by informed
experts?26

It follows that there are in principle decisions of the House of Justice which are
not covered by the predicate ‘the Truth and the Purpose of God Himself.’ In the
absence of appropriate and trustworthy criteria of distinction, however, any
attempt to delineate the set of all conceivable decisions described in paragraph
2:8 on the basis of a set of chosen examples is doomed to failure. On the other
hand, it would be unseemly to declare this choice of words to be imprecise,
subjecting ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā to the accusation of linguistic unclarity. We must
approach the topic from a different angle if we hope to gain a more satisfactory
understanding of what this passage might imply.

> House of Justice has explicitly claimed infallibility for itself: “[National and Local Spiritual

24   If the infallibility of the House of Justice is in fact limitless, this statement would be a

paradox of the form ‘The next sentence is true. The preceding sentence is false.’

The word ‘truth’ can mean a number of different things. When someone
crowns a statement with the remark “… and that’s the truth,” there is frequently
nothing more behind this claim than the averment of one’s own sincerity or the
intimation of concurrence. Neither is this the sort of truth which is implied in
this passage, nor the axiomatic or empirical truth which is accessible to the
faculty of reason and often topicalised in the writings, nor truth in a pragmatic
sense, as for example during consultation:

> He who expresses an opinion must not voice his opinion as if that opinion
> is correct or right … When he sees that the opinion previously expressed
> is better, he must immediately accept it. He must not be wilful in having
> an opinion of his own. This we call the endeavour at [sic] arrival at unity
> or truth.27
In the phrase ‘the Truth and the Purpose of God Himself,’ the Truth — al-ḥaqq
— should be understood as an absolute quality, equivalent to the divine will
(murādu’llāh) and belonging to a level of reality to which the human being has
no direct access through his own faculties. Truth is one of the ninety-nine names
of God, “the Sovereign, the Truth, the Resplendent”. 28 God is “He Who knoweth all
things,”29 and His Messenger is the bearer of this Truth, the “Point of Truth”
(nuqṭatu’l-ḥaqq),30 who speaks “naught except at His bidding” and follows “not,
through the power of God and His might, except His truth.”31

‘Truth’ is thus a metaphysical concept, and the predicate ‘the Truth and the
Purpose of God Himself’ refers to things which are inseparable from the claim to
truth. It has here to do with veritas in re ipsa, with statements which cannot be
other than true.

Again, by way of reminder:

The parallelism between this passage and the following passage from the first
part of the Will and Testament cannot be overlooked:

> And now, concerning the House of Justice which God hath ordained as the
> source of all good and freed from all error,32 … Unto this body all things
> must be referred. It enacteth all ordinances and regulations that are not
> to be found in the explicit Holy Text (noṣūṣ-e elāhī). (1:25)
Taken together, these two passages make it clear that the decisions of the House
of Justice which are ‘freed from all error’ have to do with ‘ordinances and
regulations’ (qavānīn va aḥkām) which are by their very nature the ‘Truth and
the Purpose of God Himself.’ In other words, they have to do with divine
legislation, or in the terminology of Church law, with ius divinum.

In this context, the expression gheyr-e manṣūṣeh appears to serve as the
criterion of distinction between two classes of divine law: those laws which are
prescribed in the Most Holy Book, and those which are not. Tajan Tober has
come to a comparable conclusion in his dissertation, albeit through a different
but complementary line of argumentation. With reference to the second-named
class of divine legislation he explicates:

> … the House of Justice … is empowered to establish norms the nature of
> which is such that they could well have been, and are objectively
> comparable to, revealed law. In the view presented in this analytical

> universe of non-regulated legal issues, but rather a limited field of
> jurisdiction which is distinguished by a clear and explicit relationship to
> justice or which otherwise features an immediate moral-theological
> component.33
It would be inappropriate to trivialise this lofty concept of ‘the Truth and the
Purpose of God Himself’ by squandering it on the petitesses of everyday life. As
will be seen in the four chapters to follow, the House of Justice is in possession of

32 maṣūnan min kulli khaṭā’, lit. ‘safeguarded against all error.’
33 Tober, Tajan, Ein neues ius divinum? Zur Theologie des Rechts der Bahá’í, Frankfurt am
Main: Peter Lang Verlag, 2008, S. 56 [my translation].

other mechanisms to deal with such matters.

It must be borne in mind that, as envisaged in the Will and Testament, the
House of Justice is a body the membership of which necessarily includes the
Guardian:

> By this body all the difficult problems are to be resolved and the Guardian
> of the Cause of God is its sacred head and the distinguished member for
> life of that body. (1:25)
It is clear that the House of Justice is vested with the exclusive right to enact
legislation:

> Though the Guardian of the Faith has been made the permanent head of
> so august a body he can never, even temporarily, assume the right of
> exclusive legislation.34

Nevertheless, every draft law of the House of Justice is subject to the approval of
the Guardian in his function as interpreter of the Word of God:

> He [the Guardian] cannot override the decision of the majority of his
> fellow-members, but is bound to insist upon a reconsideration by them of
> any enactment he conscientiously believes to conflict with the meaning
> and to depart from the spirit of Bahaá 'u'llaá h's revealed utterances.35

In response to the objection that the remaining members of the House of Justice
can disregard the misgivings of the Guardian,36 the House of Justice has stated:

> Although the Guardian, in relation to his fellow members within the
> Universal House of Justice, cannot override the decision of the majority, it
> is inconceivable that the other members would ignore any objection he
> raised in the course of consultation or pass legislation contrary to what he
> expressed as being in harmony with the spirit of the Cause. 37

As a result, every subsequent submission of a proposal for legislation is subject
anew to the approval of the Guardian. This cycle is terminated either by the
ultimate ratification of a scripturally unobjectionable law or by the abandon-
ment of the legislative proposal.

34   Shoghi Efffendi, The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 150.

37   The Universal House of Justice, Messages from the Universal House of Justice 1963 to 1986,
S. 158 [my emphasis].

It is significant that, as the House of Justice assures us, freedom of error is a
property of the final decision and not of the legislative proposal itself:

> It is, after all, the final act of judgement delivered by the Universal House
> of Justice that is vouchsafed infallibility, not any views expressed in the
> course of the process of enactment.38

The vacancy of the Guardianship means that there no longer exists a magisterial
power of veto as protection against the theoretical possibility of the submission
of a legislative proposal which contradicts the revealed writings in word or
spirit. In accordance both with Shoghi Effendi’s explanation and with its own
elucidations, without the participation of its ‘sacred head’ the Universal House of
Justice is not able to ensure beyond any doubt the scriptural compatibility of a
legislative proposal and thus to satisfy the predicate ‘the Truth and the Purpose
of God Himself’ in this respect.

Nevertheless there are in my estimation situations in which the enactment of
ius divinum is perfectly legitimate despite the vacancy of the Guardianship.
Among these are such cases in which the Guardian already granted the
necessary nihil obstat during his lifetime, as in the following example (excerpt
from an unpublished manuscript by Udo Schaefer:39

ruled that the requirement of parental consent be waived in such cases.42
It is incontrovertible that this decision belongs to that category of rulings for
which it is conceivable that they might well have been part of revealed law, had
the circumstances at the time been conducive to their inclusion. As such it fulfils
— pending publication — the criteria of ius divinum (also called ‘supplementary
legislation’ by Udo Schaefer),43 comparable in its claim to infallibility to the ex
cathedra proclamation of the Bishop of Rome in 1950.44

Yet however indispensable it may otherwise be, guarantee of scriptural
conformity does not in itself justify the claim ‘the Truth and the Purpose of God
Himself:’ for that, the active participation of the Universal House of Justice as a
body is required as well. That is to say, the infallibility vouchsafed to the House of
Justice in paragraphs 1:17, 1:25 und 2:8 of the Will and Testament is, as this
body itself explains, more than and different from mere reliance on the inerrant
interpretation of the Guardian:

Thus despite the factual vacancy of the Guardianship, the claim to ‘the Truth and
the Purpose of God Himself’ could, in full compliance with the stipulations in the
Will and Testament and instructions from Shoghi Effendi, 46 justifiably be

advanced for any decision by the House of Justice taken within the framework of
a “limited field of jurisdiction which is distinguished by a clear and explicit
relationship to justice or which otherwise features an immediate moral-theo-
logical component”47 but which has no immediate bearing on the explicit holy
Text and which therefore is not conditional upon the nihil obstat of the Guardian.

For example, there is to my knowledge no instruction or stipulation in the
writings of any of the central figures of the Faith which is directly relevant to the
scheduling of the two-day festival48 in commemoration of the birth of the Baā b
and the birth of Bahaā 'u'llaā h (eid-e moulūd) as specified in the recent calender
reform.49 Moreover, the method selected is in conformity with general guidelines
from Shoghi Effendi in this regard.50 The facticity of the historical data is
incontestable: the Baā b and Bahaā ’u’llaā h were born on the first and second day,
respectively, of the eighth lunation after the preceding spring equinox. 51 The
decision to determine the time of celebration each year on the basis of this
reformulation of the historical facts appears to me to satisfy every precondition
for being classified as ius divinum.

Only after a detailed analysis of all legislation enacted to date by the Universal
House of Justice would it be possible to estimate the degree to which use has
been made of the authorisation to legislate within the framework of ius divinum
as conceived in this paper.

4    The same effect as the Text itself

In paragraph 2:9 the expression gheyr-e manṣūṣeh occurs two more times:

> It is incumbent upon these members [of the Universal House of Justice] to
> gather in a certain place and deliberate upon all problems which have
> caused difference, questions that are obscure and matters that are not
> expressly recorded in the Book (gheyr-e manṣūṣeh). Whatsoever they
> decide has the same effect as the Text itself. And inasmuch as this House
> of Justice hath power to enact laws that are not expressly recorded in the
> Book (gheyr-e manṣūṣeh) and bear upon daily transactions, so also it hath
> power to repeal the same. (2:9)
This passage makes it clear that the competency of the House of Justice is not
restricted to the dispensation of ius divinum as addressed in paragraphs 1:25
and 2:8, but that there also exist further areas of responsibility, characterised
collectively by the following predicate:

> Whatsoever they decide has the same effect as the Text itself (mānand-e
> naṣṣ ast). (2:9)
It is not clear at first sight whether this predicate applies only to the portion of
text immediately preceding it or to the paragraph as a whole. The fact that the
topic of legislation is taken up following the predicate speaks only superficially
in favour of the more restrictive reading, since — whatever else it indicates —
the placement of the predicate between the two subject areas sidesteps a
compositional problem: as a result of the extensive remarks on the topic of
legislation following the excerpt cited above,52 placing the predicate at the very
end of the paragraph would have had the effect of severing its association with
the text portion at its beginning.53

It must furthermore be taken into consideration that, aside from its apportion-
ment into three separate parts, the original text consists of an unstructured

52 The text continues:

> “Thus for example, the House of Justice enacteth today a certain law and enforceth it,
> and a hundred years hence, circumstances having profoundly changed and the
> conditions having altered, another House of Justice will then have power, according to
> the exigencies of the time, to alter that law. This it can do because that law formeth no
> part of the Divine Explicit Text. The House of Justice is both the initiator and the
> abrogator of its own laws.”
53 The compositional problematics are identical in the Persian-language text.

series of sentences. The subdivision of the text into paragraphs was an initiative
of Shoghi Effendi and serves primarily as aid to orientation. But in some cases —
such as here — it also delivers important clues with regard to the Guardian’s
own understanding of the text.

Had Shoghi Effendi closed paragraph 2:9 with the sentence ‘Whatsoever they
decide has the same effect as the Text itself’ and allocated the topic of legislation
its own paragraph — which he could just as easily have done — then it would
have been unambiguously clear that the predicate ‘the same effect as the Text
itself’ applied only to the aforementioned ‘problems, questions and matters.’ The
fact that Shoghi Effendi chose not to start a new paragraph at this point can be
interpreted in either of two ways: either he gave preference to a misleading
rendition of the text over an unambiguous one, or this is not the reading he
intended. To anyone who is acquainted with the accuracy and precision of
Shoghi Effendi’s use of the English language, the former assumption is simply
frivolous. The introductory conjunction ‘and’ fortifies the impression that it was
Shoghi Effendi’s conscious decision to include both subject areas in one and the
same paragraph:54

And inasmuch as this House of Justice hath power to enact laws … (2:9)
One may assume with confidence that the predicate ‘the same effect as the Text
itself’ applies both to the ‘problems, questions and matters’ which precede it and
to the acts of legislation which follow it.

In light of the cross-paragraph repetition of gheyr-e manṣūṣeh (‘not expressly
recorded therein/in the Book’), the temptation is great to lump paragraphs 2:8
and 2:9 together mentally and to conclude that the results of the consultations of
the House of Justice within the framework of the competencies enumerated in
paragraph 2:9 likewise fall under the predicate ‘the Truth and the Purpose of
God Himself.’ When examined more closely, however, this assumption gives rise
to a number of incongruities.

To begin with, the wording of the predicate ‘the same effect as the Text itself’

54 Where in Persian and Arabic the conjunction va/wa separates two main clauses from one

> another, it is generally appropriate to render it in English as a full stop. The retention of

such is to be regarded as semantically significant.

prohibits equation with the predicate from the paragraph before. Since ‘the
Truth and Purpose of God Himself’ permits no escalation, incrementation or
qualification, a legal norm for which this predicate applies is in its very essence
true and an expression of the will of God, regardless of whether it is revealed
scripture or a decision of the Universal House of Justice. Such legal norms count
without exception as ius divinum. By contrast, the wording ‘the same effect as the
Text itself’ implies similarity but not identity in status between the revealed
Word and the decisions of the House of Justice in question. 55 The fundamental
non-identity is even more clearly expressed in the original text: mānand-e naṣṣ
ast means ‘as if it were holy Text (though it is not)’.

Furthermore, equating these two predicates has the effect of suggesting that
‛Abdu’l-Bahaā wrote two paragraphs in immediate succession, both of which
attribute freedom of error to the decisions of the House of Justice: the former
with respect to matters not recorded in the Book, the latter with respect to
matters not recorded in the Book plus ‘problems and questions’ — with the
result that the provisions of the second paragraph totally subsume those of the
first. There must perforce be a reason why the decisions of the House of Justice
are ascribed freedom from error twice with respect to statutory transactions in
matters in which the Book is silent but only once with respect to controversial
problems, obscure questions and diverse other matters. This terminological
redundancy — arguably in the most prosaic paragraph in the entire Will and
Testament — cannot simply be stylistically motivated embellishment on the part
of ‘Abdu'l-Bahaā . Is infallibility perhaps additive? — or do two forms of conferred
infallibility exist: veritable and effectual (or — following the Persian —
ostensible)? Either way: what implications does this reading bear for our
understanding of this concept?

Maybe ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā was forced to interrupt work on the Will and Testament
after having written down paragraph 2:8 and to take it up again after some lapse
of time. (The beginning of paragraph 2:8 hints that this may well have been the
case.) The enhanced set of provisions in paragraph 2:9 might either be the result
of ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā ’s having changed His mind in the meantime with respect to the

55 This footnote concerns the translation of the expression ‘the same effect’ into German and

competencies of the Universal House of Justice, or an indication that, upon
resuming composition of the Will and Testament, He noticed His earlier
oversight. The first assumption has far-reaching consequences, since it suggests
that ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā proceeded according to whim and fancy. 56 The alternative
explanation is no less problematic, for the concepts of ‘inerrancy’ and ‘oversight’
don’t really fit very well together, an observation which places the reliability of
the entire Will and Testament in serious question. Either way: such an impu-
tation necessitates a completely new assessment of the concept of infallibility
with respect to the station of ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā . On the other hand, one might imagine
that the text redundancy was unintentional, the result of a memory lapse on the
part of ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā . Can memory lapses be reconciled with infallibility?

I hasten to explain that no inferences should be drawn from these rhetorical
questions with regard to the person or station of ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā . Instead, they
illustrate the negative consequences of the reading in which paragraph 2:9 is
regarded as simply continuing the assignation of the competencies characterised
as infallible in paragraph 2:8.

Let us assume for the moment that, notwithstanding the reservations presen-
ted above, ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā really did consider the decisions of the House of Justice
with respect to the areas of responsibility described in paragraph 2:9 to be
equated with the Word of God. Would He have contented himself in that event
with the statement that these competencies were merely comparable to divine
Text? Whilst committing His Will and Testament to words, ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā was very
much aware of the fact that the content of this document — upon the clarity of
which the welfare of the community of believers depended — wouldn’t be made
available for public scrutiny until after His passing. He would no longer be there
to resolve ambiguities. The choice of words in paragraph 2:8 leave for the
practiced exegete no room for doubt about what is meant. Why, then, should
‛Abdu’l-Bahaā have expressed himself in the very next paragraph in such an
undifferentiated, indeed downright misleading manner and thereby hazard the

risk that this reading go unnoticed or eventually be challenged?

The assumption seems to me more likely that, with this statement, ‛Abdu’l-
Bahaā gave expression to the notion that the decisions named in this paragraph
were fundamentally different in nature but nevertheless equally as binding as
the Word of God.

The distinction in meaning between these two predicates (‘Truth and Purpose
of God’ vs. ‘the same effect as the Text’) extends down to the fundamentals of
our religious understanding of the freedom of conscience, a principle which is
firmly anchored in the Bahaā ’īā Faith. The freedom and sovereignty of conscience 57
is a fundamental element of the teachings of Bahaā ’u’llaā h:

> Let us also remember that at the very root of the Cause lies the principle
> of the undoubted right of the individual to self-expression, his freedom to
> declare his conscience and set forth his views.58

‛Abdu’l-Bahaā explains that no-one except God wields authority over the human
conscience:

> Convictions and ideas are within the scope of the comprehension of the
> King of kings, not of kings; and soul and conscience are between the
> fingers of control of the Lord of hearts, not of [His] servants.59

As ‘the Truth and Purpose of God Himself’, the decisions of the House of Justice
as layed down in paragraph 2:8 are constituent elements of divine legislation
and, as such, they bind the believer in conscience. Decisions which are not
constituent elements of divine legislation do not bind the believer in conscience;
they bind him in obedience.

The distinction is fundamental. When something is binding for me in
conscience, I think it or do it out of inner conviction. Should this conviction be
lacking with respect to divine law, then I have serious problems with my self-
perception as Bahaā ’īā. That which binds me in obedience does not necessarily
involve conscience. Life is of course easier if I am personally convinced of the
correctness of any action demanded of me (whereby advance trust certainly can
and should play a contributing role), 61 but whether or not I in fact harbour
doubts or misgivings is no-one else’s concern: decisive is alone my choice of
action — a commonplace for anyone steeped in the principles of rule of law. I am
entitled to express my reservations, formulate counterarguments and suggest
alternatives if I feel compelled to do so, not least to the House of Justice, under
the condition that I do so in a manner which is dignified in form and appropriate
in substance. But I may neither engage in actions to the contrary nor incite
others to do so. That would be insubordination, disobedience.

This differentiation is reflected in the assertions of commitment found in the
Will and Testament:

The word which ‘Abdu’l-Bahaā generally uses in the Will and Testament for
‘obedience/obey’ is eṭā‘at and for ‘disobedience’ tamarrod:

> We must obey (eṭā‘at) and be the well-wishers of the governments of the
> land, regard disloyalty (khiyānat) unto a just king as disloyalty to God
> Himself and wishing evil (bad-khāhī) to the government a transgression
> (tamarrod) of the Cause of God. (1:8)

60 Ibid. p. 40)
61 … with the proviso that this must not degenerate into blind imitation (taqlīd) — what

> would run counter to the commandment of Bahaā ’u’llaā h (see Bahaā ’u’llaā h, Kitāb-i Īqān §89,
§176; Tablets of Bahá‘u‘lláh §10:23; Gleanings §75:1, §84:2, §147:1.

> The mighty stronghold shall remain impregnable and safe through
> obedience (eṭā‘at) to him who is the Guardian of the Cause of God. It is
> incumbent upon the members of the House of Justice, upon all the
> Aghsaā n, the Afnaā n, the Hands of the Cause of God to show their obedience
> (eṭā‘at), submissiveness and subordination unto the Guardian of the
> Cause of God, to turn unto him and be lowly before him. (1:17)
> The Hands of the Cause of God must be nominated and appointed by the
> Guardian of the Cause of God. All must be under his shadow and obey his
> command [‘stand under his command (ḥokm)’]. Should any, within or
> without the company of the Hands of the Cause of God disobey
> (tamarrod) and seek division, the wrath of God and His vengeance will be
> upon him, for he will have caused a breach in the true Faith of God. (1:20)
> Serve ye the sovereigns of the world with utmost truthfulness and loyalty.
> Show obedience (khedmat, ‘service’, ‘obeisance’) unto them and be their
> well-wishers. (1:28)
> For he is, after 'Abdu'l-Bahaā , the Guardian of the Cause of God, the Afnaā n,
> the Hands of the Cause and the beloved of the Lord must obey (eṭā‘at)
> him and turn unto him. (3:13)
Interestingly, ‘Abdu’l-Bahaā employs these terms frequently in the Will and
Testament with reference to Shoghi Effendi (outwith his magisterial function 62)
as well as to politics and state, but not once with reference to the House of
Justice. This omission can perhaps be explained by the fact that Bahaā ’u’llaā h had
already stressed in no uncertain terms the duty of obedience to the House of
Justice:

> This passage, now written by the Pen of Glory, is accounted as part of the
> Most Holy Book: The men of God's House of Justice have been charged
> with the affairs of the people. … Inasmuch as for each day there is a new
> problem and for every problem an expedient solution, such affairs should
> be referred to the House of Justice that the members thereof may act
> according to the needs and requirements of the time. … It is incumbent
> upon all to be obedient (eṭā‘at) unto them. All matters of State should be
> referred to the House of Justice.63

It is significant that those decisions of the House of Justice which Bahaā ’u’llaā h
placed under the duty of obedience have expressly nothing to do with ius

62 There (cf. 1:16): “… unto all … must turn. He is the expounder of the words of God …”
63 Bahaā ’u’llaā h, Tablets of Bahá‘u‘lláh §8:60-61 (the eighth Ishrāq).

divinum, but are concerned instead with the ‘daily affairs of the people’ (‘each
day a new problem’) and with ‘political’ matters (omūr-e siyāsiyyeh,
‘administrative affairs’64). The two chapters to follow will address this topic more
thoroughly.

The consequences of defiance against the decisions of the House of Justice
within the framework of ius divinum are of a different nature altogether. The
renegade is not accused of insubordination, but instead imputed depravity of
character:

> Whoso doth deviate therefrom is verily of them that love discord, hath
> shown forth malice and turned away from the Lord of the Covenant. (2:8)
Such maledictions from ‘Abdu’l-Bahaā are marked by special characteristics:
they are invariably in Arabic and set in the characteristic style of rhyming prose
(saj‘), suggesting a qur’aā nic source or antetype. The above malediction is a good
example i. a. of end rhyme:65

> man tajāwaza ‘anhu fa-huwa mimman aḥabba’sh-shiqāq
> wa aẓhara’n-nifāq
> wa a‘raḍa ‘an rabbi’l-mīthāq (2:8)

Following the statement ‘Whatever they decide is of God’, the text of paragraph
1:17 continues with the following malediction:

> Whoso obeyeth him [the Guardian] not (khālafa, ‚contradict‘), neither
> obeyeth them [the Universal House of Justice], hath not obeyed God;
> whoso rebelleth against him and against them hath rebelled against God;

The rhyme and rhythm is hard to overlook even at a casual glance at the
transliterated original text:

> man khālafahu wa khālafahum fa-qad khālafa’llāh
> wa man ‘aṣāhum fa-qad ‘aṣā’llāh
> wa man ‘āraḍahu fa-qad ‘āraḍa’llāh
> wa man nāza‘ahum fa-qad nāza‘a’llāh
> wa man jādalahu fa-qad jādala’llāh

> ‘alaihi ghaḍabu’llāh
> ‘alaihi qahru’llāh
> wa ‘alaihi naqmatu’llāh (1:17)

Under closer examination one can discover, in addition to the pulsating
intonation, further saj‘ elements such as assonance, alliteration and inversion.
Poetic considerations play equally as important a role for the choice of words as
semantic. Similarly paragraph 3:13:

> He that obeyeth him not (man ‘aṣā, ‘he who revolts’), hath not obeyed
> God; he that turneth away from him, hath turned away from God and he
> that denieth him, hath denied the True One (al-ḥaqq).66 (3:13)

> man ‘aṣā amrahu fa-qad ‘aṣā’llāh
> wa man a‘raḍa ‘anhu ‘araḍa ‘ani’llāh
> wa man ankarahu fa-qad ankara’l-ḥaqq (3:13)

The balanced hemistichs which characterise the maledictions in paragraphs 1:17

66 This footnote concerns the translation of the expression ‘the True One’ into German and is
preserved to maintain parity between the German and the English versions.

and 3:13 are formulaic in structure and forbid a strictly literal interpretation. In
light of the complete amalgamation of the misconduct toward the institutions
and the word-identical misconduct toward God, differentiation between the duty
of obedience and the obligation to conscience is not supportable in these last
two passages.

And finally, the following must be taken into consideration: If the predicate
‘the Truth and Purpose of God Himself’ in paragraph 2:8 were to apply to
paragraph 2:9 as well, then all decisions of the House of Justice would without
exception be matters of conscience.67 However, that would imply that the duty of
obedience to the Universal House of Justice so clearly emphasised by Bahaā ’u’llaā h
were totally superfluous.

All in all, these considerations speak for a text reading in which those things
which ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā describes in paragraph 2:8 with the words gheyr-e
manṣūṣeh are not the same as those which He characterises in paragraph 2:9
with the identical phrase. To the contrary: the second passage indicates the
complementary set — everything which lies within the jurisdiction of the House
of Justice except for divine legislation, or in other words, those areas of
responsibility to which the duty of obedience applies.

5    Daily transactions

We will return to the ‘problems which have caused difference, questions that are
obscure and matters that are not expressly recorded in the Book’ in the next
chapter, after we have finished discussing the topic of legislation. In paragraph
2:9 ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā explains:

> And inasmuch as this House of Justice hath power to enact laws that are
> not expressly recorded in the Book and bear upon daily transactions
> (qavānīn-e gheyr-e manṣūṣeh az mu‘āmalāt), so also it hath power to
> repeal the same. (2:9)
Before we discuss this passage further, it is important to note a discrepancy in
the German-language text which significantly influences the interpretation of

67 Not to mention the fact that the infallibility of the Universal House of Justice would then
be limitless — a thesis which the House of Justice repudiates (see note 23).

this passage, indeed of the entirety of the Will and Testament, and which has
occasioned considerable misunderstanding in the German-speaking community.
The official German translation reads as follows:

> Da dieses Haus der Gerechtigkeit die Gewalt hat, Gesetze zu geben, die
> nicht ausdruä cklich im Buche enthalten sind, und die laufenden Geschaä fte
> zu regeln, hat es auch die Gewalt, solche Gesetze aufzuheben. (2:9)
The German version presents two areas of responsibility:
•      the enactment of laws, and
•      the regulation of daily transactions.
According to both ‘Abdu’l-Bahaá and Shoghi Effendi, however, the text describes
one single area of responsibility:
•      the enactment of laws which regulate daily transactions.
In other words, this passage has to do with a clearly delimited legislative
empowerment. The reading is compelling: the House of Justice is to determine
the legal frame of reference within which the daily affairs68 of the community are
to be conducted.
The text continues:

> Thus for example, the House of Justice enacteth today a certain law and
> enforceth it, and a hundred years hence, circumstances having profoundly
> changed and the conditions having altered, another House of Justice will
> then have power, according to the exigencies of the time, to alter that law.

(2:9)
As ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā explains, the time span of one hundred years is intended as an
example; and whereas it most certainly is not to be understood as a guideline, it
does suggest a certain continuity: this passage is not concerned with ephemeral
solutions or case-related directives, but instead with legislation which is expec-
ted to have a long-term, sustainable but not necessarily irrevocable influence on
the community as a whole. The legislation referred to here concerns the practical
affairs of the members of the community and their institutions, to the exclusion
of religious teachings. In other words, it has to do with ius humanum.

68 In other words, ‘administrative affairs’ (vgl. Fn. 64); Arab./Pers. mu‘āmalāt, from Arab.
‘amila, ‘to do, to take action, to work,’ III. Stamm, ‘proceed, treat, handle’.

The power ‘to alter that law’ or ‘repeal the same’ is clearly restricted to ius
humanum: the phrase ‘that law’ expressly excludes the ius divinum described in
paragraph 2:8. This reading is further supported by the remark which follows:

> This it [the Universal House of Justice] can do because that law formeth
> no part of the Divine Explicit Text (naṣṣ-e ṣarīḥ-e elāhī nīst). (2:9)
The predicate ‘no part of the Divine Explicit Text’ applies exclusively to the
immediately aforementioned laws for the regulation of daily transactions. 69 It
follows that there must exist in turn other laws from the Universal House of
Justice for which this description does not hold — in other words, laws which do
indeed count as part of the Divine Explicit Text. Only two categories of law with
respect to the Universal House of Justice are mentioned in the Will and
Testament:
• law for the regulation of daily transactions, as described in paragraph 2:9 (ius

humanum), and
• law which counts as ‘the Truth and Purpose of God Himself,’ as described in

paragraph 2:8 (divine law, ius divinum).

It follows that laws of the latter category count as ‘part of the Divine Explicit
Text.’ The expression ‘Divine Explicit Text’ (naṣṣ-e ṣarīḥ-e elāhī)70 thus subsumes
both those laws which are layed down in the Most Holy Book (manṣūṣeh) and
those laws of the Universal House of Justice which count as ‘the Truth and
Purpose of God Himself,’ i. e. both ius divinum scripturae and ius divinum
complementum.71
Furthermore, the passage explicates:

> This it can do because (zīāraā ) that law formeth no part of the Divine
> Explicit Text. (2:9) [my emphasis]
Thus according to ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā the quality of not forming part of the Divine
Explicit Text is the precondition for the ability of the House of Justice to alter or
revoke a particular law of its own provenience. As shown above, divine law does

69 The implicit subject of the relative clause in the Persian-language original, understood as

> ‘the just-mentioned entity’ (here the phrase ‘a given law’ at the beginning of the same
> sentence), was made explicit by Shoghi Effendi in the phrase ‘that law.’

71 Cf. Tober, T., Ein neues ius divinum? Zur Theologie des Rechts der Bahá’í, p. 102ff.

not possess this quality. It follows that those laws of the House of Justice
classified as ius divinum complementum — “norms the nature of which is such
that they could well have been, and correspond objectively to, revealed law” 72
and which satisfy the predicate ‘the Truth and the Purpose of God Himself’ —
remain in effect equally as long as the laws in the revealed Text, i. e. until the
Dispensation of Bahaā ’u’llaā h is superceded by a new theophany.73

Examples for the enactment of ius humanum (or more precisely, of ius
humanum ecclesiasticum) in the annals the Bahaā ’ī ā Faith include — in my
estimation — those laws which inform the Bahaā ’īā administrative order, such as
the establishment of the Continental Boards of Counsellors on 24 June 1968, the
ratification of the Constitution of the Universal House of Justice on 24 November
1972, the creation of the International Teaching Centre on 8 June 1973, the
establishment of the so-called Training Institute along with its administrative
structure on 26 December 1995, the founding of the Regional Bahaā ‘īā Councils on
30 May 1997, the introduction of clusters on 9 January 2001, and finally the
establishment of the International Board of Trustees for Hḥuquā qu’llaā h at Ridḥ vaā n
2005\.74 Following the reading of paragraph 2:9 presented here, the House of
Justice reserves the right to change, extend or abrogate those aspects of the
administrative order which have been fashioned by its own legislation.

The area of ius humanum is also affected by the absence of a Guardian. Shoghi
Effendi explained that the House of Justice had the authority neither for the
delineation of its own area of competency nor for the judgement of the
compatibility of its own decisions with the holy writings:

> Divorced from the institution of the Guardianship … the necessary
> guidance to define the sphere of the legislative action of its [the Faith’s]
> elected representatives would be totally withdrawn.75

72 See note 33.
73 Strictly speaking, this implication is not conclusive, since the existence of other criteria by

> criteria are mentioned nowhere in the Will and Testament, however; one would have to
> invent them. Presumably, the conviction to the contrary which predominates in the Bahaā ’īā

and 2:9.
74 It is my understanding that this holds also for the institution of the Auxiliary Boards

established at Ridḥ vaā n 1954 by Shoghi Effendi.

and

In light of the vacancy of the Guardianship, not even the relatively clear instruc-
tions in the Will and Testament of ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā can be applied with absolute
certainty except in the degree to which they have already been layed out unam-
biguously by Shoghi Effendi. In the consciousness of being under way ‘without
satnav,’ as it were, the House of Justice is always at pains to identify the limits of
its authority on the basis of written evidence:

> [T]he Guardian, functioning within his own sphere, had the right and duty
> "to define the sphere of the legislative action" of the Universal House of
> Justice. In other words, he had the authority to state whether a matter
> was or was not already covered by the Sacred Texts and therefore
> whether it was within the authority of the Universal House of Justice to
> legislate upon it. No other person, apart from the Guardian, has the right
> or authority to make such definitions. The question therefore arises: In

> straying outside its proper sphere and thus falling into error? Here we
> must remember three things: First, Shoghi Effendi, during the thirty-six
> years of his Guardianship, has already made innumerable such defini-

> Himself. As already announced to the friends, a careful study of the
> Writings and interpretations on any subject on which the House of Justice
> proposes to legislate always precedes its act of legislation. Second, the
> Universal House of Justice, itself assured of divine guidance, is well aware
> of the absence of the Guardian and will approach all matters of legislation

> Guardian has confidently described as "clearly defined." Third, we must
> not forget the Guardian's written statement about these two Institutions:
> "Neither can, nor will ever, infringe upon the sacred and prescribed
> domain of the other."77
This modus operendi results in action solely in the event of the existence of a

clear indication in the ‘Writings and interpretations’ upon which the House of
Justice can orient itself — not only with respect to its areas of competency, but
also with respect to the consistency of its decisions with the word and spirit of
the Revelation. But in the wake of scientific, technological, medical and socio-
political advancements and innovations, modern society unremittingly offers
fields of action and deliberation for which no interpretive guidance exists. One
need only think of such topics as abortion, artificial insemination, cloning, stem
cell research, organ transplantation, life-prolonging measures, nanotechnology,
computer technology and telecommunication, satellite, drone and robot tech-
nology, surveillance and data protection, globalisation, mobility and environ-
ment, overpopulation, global warming, nuclear technology, computer-aided
warfare, and much more. It is either the case that there is no guidance with
respect to the delineation of competency or criteria for the shaping of decisions,
or what is available is not sufficiently illuminating on account of the drastic
changes in living conditions or advances in technology which have taken place in
the meantime. And in the coming ten, fifty, hundred, five hundred years there are
certain to evolve new problem areas the nature of which we cannot even imagine
today.

The way out of this dilemma certainly does not consist in the House of Justice
assuming the leadership role reserved for the Guardian, a ‘solution’ which would
be tantamount to an infringement “upon the sacred and prescribed domain” of
the Guardian.78 Nor can the House of Justice get around the problem by creating
an entity and investing it with competencies which it does not itself possess.
Notwithstanding, abstention from any and all actions for which no appropriate
guidance can be found in the writings of Shoghi Effendi would hardly be a
sensible solution for the House of Justice in the long run: that would simply lead
to a situation whereby, for increasing areas of life, the Bahaā ’īā community would
be incapable of offering authoritative guidelines to its members. Precisely in that

area in which a religion should most clearly assume social responsibility, the
Bahaā ’īā Religion would slowly but surely grind to a stop and, like so many belief
systems before it, sink into irrelevance.

It would seem as if we are dealing with a competency which has been forseen
in the Testament and which we cannot do without, but which on account of the
configuration of the administrative order which has emerged historically no
person and no institution can ever exercise. In an area where no-one can assume
responsibility, that responsibility must necessarily default to the community as a
whole. Bahaā ’īās collectively possess an immense treasure-trove of intellectual
capacity, experience, expertise and speciallist knowledge. Correctly unharnessed
and effectively employed, this capacity could be of considerable value to the
House of Justice as input to its own consultations. It goes without saying that this
latent potential is no substitute for the lost magisterium, and it is unnecessary to
add that the House of Justice always has the last word. But the active and above
all cooperative participation of the House of Justice in promoting community-
wide discourse would not only spread the intellectual groundwork over the
greatest possible number of individuals, it would also be an important signal to
the believers that they carry a participatory responsibility for the unfolding of
their community of faith.

These deliberations apply to all areas of responsibility outlined in paragraph
2:9, i. e. also to those discussed in the next chapter.

6   Problems which have caused difference, questions that are obscure

and matters that are not expressly recorded in the Book

By way of reminder:

> It is incumbent upon these members (of the Universal House of Justice) to
> … deliberate upon all problems which have caused difference (ān-cheh
> ekhtelāf vāqe‘), questions that are obscure (masā’el-e mobhameh) and
> matters that are not expressly recorded in the Book (masā’el-e gheyr-e
> manṣūṣeh). … And inasmuch as (chūn) this House of Justice hath power to
> enact laws, … so also it hath power to repeal the same. (2:9)
In the German translation the Persian word chūn is translated as da, which
signals a robust cause-and-effect relationship between subordinate and main

clause. The word also masquerades as a back reference, placed as it is at the
beginning of the sentence (the ‘and’ from Shoghi Effendi’s translation is missing).
The adverbial clause thus takes on the appearance of a truth claim whose formal
justification is to be found in the immediately preceding flow of text: an
expectation which lulls the German-speaking reader into falsely assuming that
the ‘problems which have caused difference, questions that are obscure and
matters that are not expressly recorded in the Book’ have basically to do with
legislation. In Shoghi Effendi’s translation with inasmuch as — a more faithful
rendition of the basic meaning of chūn — this implied causality is lacking
altogether. Instead, attention is drawn to the reciprocity which exists between
the two clauses.

Furthermore, the identification of just what is being referred to is confounded
by the German translation alle Fragen, … die kontrovers, unklar oder nicht
ausdrücklich im Buche behandelt sind (all questions … which are controversial,
unclear or not explicitly dealt with in the Book), which deviates markedly from
the English- and Persian-language versions.

In my understanding of the text, ‘problems which have caused diffference’ are
not merely ‘controversal questions,’ as the German translation would have me to
believe, but conflict situations which must be dealt with and contained: in
addition to ‘difference’ or ‘dissimilarity,’ ekhtelāf means ‘contradiction,’ ‘conflict,’
in agreement with the Shoghi Effendi’s translation ‘caused difference’. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahaā saw conflict and contention between individual believers or groups of
believers as serious impediments to the growth and advancement of the Faith,
and the avoidance of discord was among the main driving forces behind the
writing of His Will and Testament. Here one passage among many:79

> O ye beloved of the Lord! In this sacred Dispensation, conflict and
> contention are in no wise permitted. (1:23)
According to the wording of the text, the House of Justice is to deliberate upon
which measures are to be taken in the event of a disturbance to the peace and
unity of the community. The House of Justice elucidates in this regard:

… [The House of Justice] states what must be done in cases where the

79 See also 1:3, 1:10, 1:17, 1:18, 1:22, 1:24, 2:8, 2:13, 3:10, 3:13.

revealed Text or its authoritative interpretation is not explicit.80

Accordingly, the finding of the House of Justice is not an ‘answer’ to a ‘question,’
but rather a sovereign decision: Haifa locuta, causa finita.81 It is essential that
measures be taken to counter the centrifugal forces of disunity.

Similarly, the phrase ‘questions that are obscure’ refers by no means to
theological controversies. It is true that the House of Justice has the right to
elucidate the written Word, but this right does not differ principally from that of
every individual believer:

> O Son of Spirit! The best beloved of all things in My sight is Justice; turn
> not away therefrom if thou desirest Me, and neglect it not that I may
> confide in thee. By its aid thou shalt see with thine own eyes and not
> through the eyes of others, and shalt know of thine own knowledge and
> not through the knowledge of thy neighbour. Ponder this in thy heart;
> how it behooveth thee to be. Verily justice is My gift to thee and the sign
> of My loving-kindness. Set it then before thine eyes.82
When the House of Justice decides what is to be done, every Bahaā ’īā is obligated
to follow suit. When it occasionally elucidates divine scripture, one can and
should assume that the opinion it presents has been meticulously researched,
and one is well advised to take close heed. However, it is binding neither in
conscience nor in obedience: after all, authoritative elucidations would be in
clear contradiction to the instructions of Shoghi Effendi:

> The interpretation of the Guardian, functioning within his own sphere, is
> as authoritative and binding as the enactments of the International House

Clearly, the ‘questions which are obscure’ are open questions of a practical or
procedural nature whose unclarity impedes or endangers the homogeneity of
the community. A topic which was current at the time of the writing of the Will
and Testament and which presented much potential for confusion was the

question of gender separation in the staffing of the North American ‘Assembly of
Teaching’ and ‘House of Spirituality’, of which the latter was considered the
forerunner of the national House of Justice. ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā ended this discussion
by putting his foot down.84 This reading of the text suggests that the authority to
react similarly in comparable situations has been transferred to the Universal
House of Justice.

The third element in the list of characteristics defining those issues over which
the House of Justice is to deliberate includes for the third and final time the
expression gheyr-e manṣūṣeh. By translating masā’el-e gheyr-e manṣūṣeh as
‘matters [instead of ‘questions’] that are not expressly recorded in the Book’,
Shoghi Effendi made it clear that the word masā’el is being used here in a general
sense.

The occurrence of the ‘everything-but’ construction gheyr-e manṣūṣeh begs
once again the question of the scope of ‘everything’. We recall that, for the sphere
of action in question, believers are committed to obedience. That effectively
restricts this scope to areas in which the House of Justice is entitled to exact
obedience in the first place: to internal affairs of the Bahaā ’ī ā community, 85
excluding both the domain of personal conscience and the area of responsibility
of the Guardian. Other than that, the jurisdiction of the House of Justice reaches
its limit where it encounters the domain of secular law or other state authority:
just as every Bahaā ’īā is enjoined by Bahaā ’u’llaā h to respect the laws of the land in
which he lives, so too are the Bahaā ’īā institutions obliged to recognise authority
emanating from the state:

> The one true God, exalted be His glory, hath ever regarded, and will
> continue to regard, the hearts of men as His own, His exclusive
> possession. All else, whether pertaining to land or sea, whether riches or
> glory, He hath bequeathed unto the Kings and rulers of the earth. … What
> mankind needeth in this day is obedience unto them that are in authority,

> Bahá, Haifa: Bahaá ’īá World Centre, 1982, §38:4).
85 “The Administrative Order is not a governmental or civic body, it is to regulate and guide

> the governors of human society. This is the wish of God and His decree. 87

‛Abdu’l-Bahaā even dedicated the closing words of the first part of the Will and
Testament to this theme:

> O ye beloved of the Lord! It is incumbent upon you to be submissive to all
> monarchs that are just and to show your fidelity to every righteous king.
> Serve ye the sovereigns of the world with utmost truthfulness and loyalty.
> Show obedience unto them and be their well-wishers. Without their leave
> and permission do not meddle with political affairs, for disloyalty to the
> just sovereign is disloyalty to God Himself. (1:28)
Now, it being the case that the ‘everything-but’ phrase already subsumes the
first two areas of responsibility, i. e. the ‘problems which have caused difference’
and the ‘questions that are obscure,’ what motivation lies behind their being
mentioned in the first place? In my estimation it has to do with the overriding
goal of the Will and Testament: with ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā ’s efforts to protect the
community from future threats to its well-being:

> The greatest of all things is the protection of the True Faith of God, the
> preservation of His Law, the safeguarding of His Cause and service unto
> His Word. (1:3)
> No doubt every vainglorious one that purposeth dissension and discord
> will … seize upon divers measures and various pretexts that he may
> separate the gathering of the people of Bahaá . (1:17)
> I am now in very great danger … I am thus constrained to write these
> lines for the protection of the Cause of God, the preservation of His Law,
> the safeguarding of His Word and the safety of His Teachings. … My
> supreme obligation, however, of necessity, prompteth me to guard and
> preserve the Cause of God. Thus, with the greatest regret, I counsel you
> saying: Guard ye the Cause of God, protect His law and have the utmost
> fear of discord. (2:8)
In light of these vivid appeals to the protection of the Faith and the preservation
of its unity, this reading is clearly appropriate. Abdu’l-Bahaā identifies the sources
86 Cf. Mark. 12:17: “And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that

are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.”
87 Bahaā ’u’llaā h, Gleanings §102:1.

from which danger is most likely to be expected and enjoins the House of Justice
to pay especial attention to these two areas. It is not hostile attacks from non-
Bahaā ’īās, nor the incessant intrigues of the Covenant-breakers, but rather conflict
situations and infighting among the members of the community which represent
the greatest challenge for the Universal House of Justice.

In another sense, problems which have caused difference and questions that are
obscure are definitive for the contextualisation of the scope of the ‘everything-
but’ expression: Accordingly, masā’el-e gheyr-e manṣūṣeh are measures of a non-
legislative nature not expressly dealt with in the holy Book which need to be
carried out to preserve the unity and/or to foster the growth of the community.
In my estimation, this category of decisions includes announcements such as
occur typically in the form of Ridḥ vaā n messages, including the plans for action
which are developed for years in advance and other guidance of a similar nature.

7     Under the shelter and unerring guidance

Let us return to an assurance in The Will and Testament which we have until
now encountered only in passing:

> The … Guardian of the Cause of God, as well as the Universal House of
> Justice, … are both under the care and protection of the Abhaá Beauty,
> under the shelter and unerring guidance (‛eṣmat-e fā’eḍ) of the Exalted
> One (may my life be offered up for them both). Whatsoever they decide is
> of God. (1:17)
The statement ‘Whatsoever they decide is of God,’ which was discussed above
within the framework of ius divinum, comes immediately after the assurance of
care, protection and unerring guidance. The proximity of these two statements
can be taken to support the assumption that the statement ‘under the shelter
and unerring guidance’ likewise has to do with ius divinum. That is indeed most
certainly the case. But the circumstances under which these words came into
being permit a more embracing interpretation:

The first part of the Will and Testament was written probably in 1904, 88 at a
88 See the memorandum of 24. Juli 1996 from the research department at the Bahaá ’īì World

writings.com/?a=SHOWTEXT&d=%2F%2Fen%2FBahai+Faith%2F1+-+Primary+Sources

time during which ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā was in immediate mortal danger. 89 Thanks to the
scheming of the Covenant-breakers gathered around ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā ’s half-brother
Muhḥ ammad-‛Alīā, the “Center of Sedition”,90 an investigation committee was sent
from Istanbul to examine the grave charges these had brought against ‛Abdu’l-
Bahaā ’s person:

> They so perturbed the minds of the members of the Imperial Government
> that at last a Committee of Investigation was sent from the seat of His
> Majesty’s Government which, violating every rule of justice and equity
> that befit His Imperial Majesty, nay, with the most glaring injustice,
> proceeded with its investigations. (1:7)
> But alas! The Committee of Investigation hath approved and confirmed
> these calumnies of my brother and ill-wishers and submitted them to the
> presence of His Majesty the Sovereign. Now at this moment a fierce storm
> is raging around this prisoner who awaiteth, be it favorable or
> unfavorable, the gracious will of His Majesty ... (1:8)
Even as He wrote these words, ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā awaited the announcement and
enforcement out of Sultḥaān ‛Abdu’l-Hḥamīād’s decree. The structure of the docu-
ment reveals ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā s effort to cover as quickly and parsimoniously as
possible every matter vital to the continued functioning of the community in the
event of His sudden banishment or execution. The accusations of the Covenant-
breakers, along with ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā ’s refutations, are presented in considerable
detail, from which we may infer that, in addition to its function as general
documentation for the sake of the community of believers, this writing was
intended as material for submission during a possible further hearing.91

These are interspersed with, among other things, instructions for the future
configuration of the administrative order. These instructions are written down in
extremely condensed form, clearly under pressure of time, and the narrative
occasionally switches abruptly from one theme to the next. The usual supposi-

tions with respect to the inner cohesion92 of units of text do not necessary apply
here: the mere fact of consecutiveness of two statements in this part of the Will
and Testament is not a reliable indication that they belong to the same topic. It is
therefore thoroughly possible that ‘under the shelter and unerring guidance’ is
the description of a general condition, even though the immediately following
sentence specifically addresses the truth claim of ius divinum.

The adjective ma‛ṣūm (i. a. ‘infallible’) occurs nowhere in the Will and
Testament, the substantive form ‛eṣmat (i. a. ‘infallibility’) only this one time in
paragraph 1:17 in the expression ‛eṣmat-e fā’eḍ (unerring guidance).93 The assu-
rance of across-the-board infallibility for the institutions of the Guardianship and
the House of Justice cannot legitimately be inferred from this passage, since
according to the wording it is the divine guidance which counts as being
infallible. The availability of inerrant guidance is no guarantee that this guidance
be inerrantly followed — there are other contributing factors to be considered.
With reference to the consultation of the elected bodies, ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā explains:

> The first condition is absolute love and harmony amongst the members of
> the assembly. They must be wholly free from estrangement and must
> manifest in themselves the Unity of God, for they are the waves of one sea,
> the drops of one river, the stars of one heaven, the rays of one sun, the
> trees of one orchard, the flowers of one garden. Should harmony of
> thought and absolute unity be nonexistent, that gathering shall be
> dispersed and that assembly be brought to naught. … They must, when
> coming together, turn their faces to the Kingdom on high and ask aid from
> the Realm of Glory. They must then proceed with the utmost devotion,
> courtesy, dignity, care and moderation to express their views. They must
> in every matter search out the truth and not insist upon their own
> opinion, for stubbornness and persistence in one's views will lead
> ultimately to discord and wrangling and the truth will remain hidden. …
> Should they endeavour to fulfil these conditions the Grace of the Holy
> Spirit shall be vouchsafed unto them, and that assembly shall become the
> centre of the Divine blessings … 94

94 ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā , Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá §45.

‛Abdu’l-Bahaā also makes it clear in the Will and Testament that the unflinching
devotion of each of the members of the House of Justice is an indispensable
precondition to the correct functioning of this body:

> Its [the House of Justice’s] members must be manifestations of the fear of
> God and daysprings of knowledge and understanding, must be steadfast
> in God’s faith and the well-wishers of all mankind. (1:25)
A distinctive feature of this assurance of inerrant guidance is the fact that it does
not apply to the body as a whole, but instead expressly to its individual members
— in contrast to the assurance of unconditional infallibility for ius divinum:

> That which this body, whether unanimously or by a majority doth carry,
> that is verily the Truth and the Purpose of God Himself. (2:8)
It is to be assumed that the decisions of the Universal House of Justice are
deliberated in a conscientious and meticulous manner, that they are free of
personal interest and accompanied by an irreproachable spiritual deportment,
so that the conditions for the reception of the guidance vouchsafed them are
often if not regularly fulfilled. Nevertheless there is no surety that this will be the
case in any given instance, since the members of the Universal House of Justice
are and remain human beings and do not forfeit their freedom of will upon
entering the council chamber. All in all, one can here hardly speak of infallibility,
since ‘infallibility sans surety’ is an oxymoron. Udo Schaefer describes this
assurance instead as ‘relative’, as

> a general divine guidance that is promised to all elected bodies, which is a
> relative one, because it depends on certain preconditions, “prime
> requisites for them that take counsel together.”95 … [T]he relative
> [guidance] does not exclude error.96
Man is endowed with reason, and his conceptual capacity and power of
reasoning distinguish him from all other creatures:

> First and foremost among these favours, which the Almighty hath
> conferred upon man, is the gift of understanding. … This gift giveth man
> the power to discern the truth in all things, leadeth him to that which is
> right, and helpeth him to discover the secrets of creation.97

96 Schaefer, Udo, ‚Infallible Institutions?‘, p. 22.
97 Bahaā ’u’llaā h, Gleanings §95:1.

Reason on its own does not suffice for optimal decision-making; it requires the
partnership of a radiant spirit, a spirit free from everything which veils reality
and blinds rationality. A purified intellect is more likely to arrive at good
decisions than one which is fettered to the baser things of life. That is after all
the key to the success of well-functioning consultation. Were the unconditional
infallibility of the House of Justice in force for all its decisions, then rationality,
freedom of will and the aforementioned spiritual prerequisites for membership
in that body would be meaningless frills, and consultation would be superfluous:
if it weren’t a transgression against the Will and Testament, 98 one might just as
well forget about elections and simply cast lots for membership.

It is moreover unrealistic to make blanket claims of ‘error-free’ decision-
making outwith the domain of ius divinum. The ramifications of every non-trivial
action are extensive and frequently intransparent, and the results are virtually
never purely positive or negative. Decisions in this world ensue from the relative
prioritisation of competing objectives and interests, which must as often as not
be weighed against one another under consideration of compex and constantly
varying consequences of action. What is more, the effects of any given decision
are discernible only retrospectively, since the decision informs the environment
in which it takes effect and creates a reality different from the one in which the
decision had been taken. Whether or not a decision was ‘correct’ depends not
least on the perspective from which its effects — positive and negative — are
assessed. The ‘correctness’ of the result of an arbitration or of a ruling in the
framework of ius humanum is thus the subjective judgement of the observer,99
and not, as in the case of ius divinum, an intrinsic property of the ruling itself.
Objective correctness exists as little as subjective inerrancy.

The notion that the unconditional infallibility of the House of Justice is limited
to decisions within the framework of ius divinum detracts by no means from the
obligation of obedience to that body. All other decisions and instructions are to
be obeyed for the simple reason that Bahaā ’u’llaā h has commanded us to do so. 100
The claim that the duty of obedience would be weakened or even nullified if it

99 Cf. Note 27.

were not accompanied by the charisma of infallibility101 contradicts the clear and
unambigouous statements of ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā ; moreover, by placing conditions on
the divinely ordained duty of obedience, such a claim depreciates the
commandment of Bahaā ’u’llaā h.

8    This House of Justice enacteth the laws and the government enforceth

them

Whereas ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā layed down the basic groundwork of the Bahaā ’īā
Administrative Order for the period following His own ministry, He vested the
institutions mentioned in the Will and Testament with the requisite
authorisation for its future extension. In particular, He assigned far-reaching
competencies to the House of Justice — competencies which, should they remain
exclusively in the hands of the members of this body, would never reach their full
efficacy. Even today, where the number of Bahaā ’īās in the world still lies in the
single millions, it would be ludicrous to assume that nine individuals would be
able to cope with the manifold tasks which need to be carried out at the World
Centre.

It is therefore evident that not all competencies with which the House of
Justice is endowed are intended to remain at its exclusive disposal, but instead
are to be delegated in an orderly fashion. Some of the areas of responsibility
assigned to the House of Justice can be passed on to the secondary Houses of
Justice, i. e. the Spiritual Assemblies at national and local level: the organisation
of national conventions and comparable events comes to mind, or arbitration in
inheritance matters or other disputes between individual Bahaā ’īās within their
respective areas of jurisdiction, or matters of legislation within the framework of
ius humanum102 which require harmonisation with country-specific law. 103 For

the performance of the various routine administrative functions other agencies
are required: one need only think of the multifarious office activities, building
projects, tending of gardens and maintenance of the various monuments on
Mount Carmel and elsewhere, the establishment and maintenance of a central
archive, the translation of the extensive corpus of holy writings (including
ongoing examination and improvement of existing editions), the maintenance of
a research department, the establishment and operation of a bookkeeping and
finance system, to name the most obvious. But in order to distribute
competencies, the House of Justice must first possess them. The Will and
Testament sees to it that the House of Justice is provided with the necessary
power of disposition.

Though ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā does not address the issue directly, the necessity for the
partial transfer of administrative, juristic and legislative competencies arises out
of the logic of the circumstances — a supposition which has been corroborated
by the course of subsequent events. With respect to the executive functions,
however, ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā issues specific instructions regarding how and to what
degree this transfer is to take form:

> This House of Justice enacteth the laws and the government (ḥokūmat)
> enforceth them.104 (1:25)
The word used here by ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā for ‘the laws’ is tashrī‛ (‘legislation’), which
has the same root as the word sharī‛a. From the Muslim point of view, law
subsumes two areas: ‛ibādāt (religious observance) und mu‘āmalāt (regulation
of the interpersonal concerns of the community). Since Bahaā ’u’llaā h excludes all
matters of ‛ibādāt from future alteration,105 the responsibility of the House of
Justice is restricted to mu‘āmalāt, which corresponds to the legislative powers of
the House of Justice in the sense of the reading of paragraph 2:9 presented above
(qavānīn-e gheyr-e manṣūṣeh az mu‘āmalāt), i. e. ius humanum ecclesiasticum.106

This statement clearly obligates the House of Justice to the outsourcing of the
executive. Which authority or authorities are implicated, however, remains to be

respect to ius divinum the individual is answerable to God alone.

identified.

It is frequently assumed that the remarks in paragraph 1:25 present a
scenario in which the supreme Bahaā ’īā body has a secular counterpart with which
it shares the governing of the planet — an assumption which appears at first
sight to be supported by the world-encompassing vision of the future which
closes the paragraph:

> … so that through the close union and harmony of these two forces, the
> foundation of fairness and justice may become firm and strong, that all
> the regions of the world may become even as Paradise itself. (1:25)
But a closer examination of this sentence discloses that ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā is by no
means consigning the delegation of executive competency to some distant
future. The paradisiac conditions which He envisages are instead the consum-
mation of a development for which the implementation of this directive is a
precondition.107

Support for this triumphalistic assumption must therefore be sought
elsewhere. If this is what ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā intended, then we should reasonably
expect to encounter this key vision elswhere in His writings. ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā did in
fact extensively and unequivocally express His opinion concerning this issue. His
own words need no further commentary:

> They [the heavenly Books that have been sent down, the Prophets of God,
> and spiritual souls and devout religious leaders]108 have never had any
> role to play in questions of the government and the governed, of ruling
> and being ruled. They are ones chosen by the sweet-scented breezes of
> God, the ones closest to the overflowing waters of the spirit of eternity.
> They do not seek any role in other matters, and they do not urge the steed
> of ambition in the arena of greed and power. For matters of politics and
> government, of the kingdom and of subjects have a specified source and a
> respected place to which they refer, while guidance, religion, insight,
> education, and the promotion of the morals and virtues of humanity have
> a sacred centre and designated spring. These souls have nothing to do

108 ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā , [A Sermon on] the Art of Governance (Resāle-ye Siyāsiyyah), translated by Sen
McGlinn, http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/trans/vol7/govern.htm, §6:1.

> with political affairs, nor do they seek any involvement.109
> The fact is, that the functions of the religious leaders and the duties of
> experts in religious law are to keep watch over spiritual matters and to
> spread abroad the virtues of the Merciful. Whenever the leaders of the
> manifest religion, the pillars of religious law, have sought a role in the
> political sphere, have issued opinions and taken control, the unity of the
> believers in the one true God has been dissolved, and schisms have
> encompassed the community of the faithful.110

And finally, ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā s stance in this respect can be found, in a somewhat
more restrained tone, in the Will and Testament itself:

> O ye beloved of the Lord! It is incumbent upon you to be submissive to all
> monarchs that are just and to show your fidelity to every righteous king.
> Serve ye the sovereigns of the world with utmost truthfulness and loyalty.
> Show obedience unto them and be their well-wishers. Without their leave
> and permission do not meddle with political affairs, for disloyalty to the
> just sovereign is disloyalty to God Himself. (1:28)
It is to be noted that participation in politics, though not expressly forbidden,
may nevertheless take place only by leave and permission of the state. The
hierarchy implied here between the state and the House of Justice is the exact
opposite of the perception of the House of Justice as lawgiver and the state as its
executive organ. The state-approved participation presented here does not
involve the assimilation of the civil legislature into the Bahaā ’ī ā administrative
structure, but rather for example the establishment and running of schools,
hospitals, homes for the aged and day-care centres — services which already
today are in many places carried out by church organisations under the auspices
of the state.

And finally, we must bear in mind that ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā was primarily concerned
in His Will and Testament with the preservation of unity and solidarity in the
community following His passing. It would indeed be strange if, in this selfsame
document, ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā should mandate practices on account of which, in His
own earlier words, “the unity of the believers in the one true God has been
dissolved, and schisms have encompassed the community of the faithful”
wherever they have been followed.
109 Op. cit. §6:2.
110 Op. cit. §12.

All in all, there are sound reasons for adopting a reading of paragraph 1:25 in
which the ‘government’ is not that of the state, but a body established and
authorised by the Universal House of Justice: an executive body which manages
the affairs of the Bahaā ’īā community independent of but in close cooperation with
the House of Justice — a sort of Bahaā ’īā Curia. Since the Islamic world knows no
counterpart to such a structure and therefore there exists no Persian or Arabic
word to describe it, ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā was obliged to assign a novel, community-
internal meaning to an existing term with similar connotations. It would appear
that this function was most satisfactorily fulfilled by the Arabic-Persian word
ḥokūmat, which means a government or agency with executive authority, 111 a
neologism which is in agreement with the use of the word ḥokūmat elsewhere in
the Will and Testament: the word appears eight times in other passages with the
meaning ‘body with executive authority,’ each time with reference to middle-
echelon Ottoman secular authority: three times in paragraph 1:6, twice in
paragraph 1:7 and 2:4 and once in paragraph 3:9.112

‛Abdu’l-Bahaā continues:

111 Shoghi Effendi’s translation of ḥokūmat as government comes very close to the meaning

> intended (< Gr. κυβερνάω, ‚I steer‘): alongside local/state/federal/national government
> one speaks also of church government, school goverment etc. In the German-language
> version this is translated using the less appropriate word Regierung (< Lat. regere), i. e.
‘regime.’

There are further terminological shifts of meaning in the same paragraph (1:25). In the
> opening sentence, ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā speaks of ‘universal sufferage’ (entekhāb-e ‘omūmī) with
> reference to the election of members of the House of Justice, although this is patently the
> prerogative of the believers (mo’meneh), and later on He uses mellat (‘the people’) quite
> obviously in the sense of ‘community’ (i. e. in connexion with the election of a replace-
> ment member of the House of Justice) — a meaning variation which was quite common in
> the Ottoman empire at that time. For ‘people’ generally, ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā used the word
> omām: “contention and conflict amidst peoples (omām) … may disappear” (1:22);
> “members of all the governments (omām) and peoples of the world” (ibid.); “all the
> kindreds (omām) and peoples of the world” (1:8); “the nations and peoples (omām) of
> the world” (1:14). Should one choose to interpret the terms ‘omūmī and mellat literally,
> then the electorate for the Universal House of Justice would subsume the entire world
> population, Bahaā ’īās and non-Bahaā ’īās alike.
112 In paragraph 1:8 the word ḥokūmat occurs twice with respect to secular government, in

‛Abdu’l-Bahaā is at pains to prevent the still evolving administrative order from
ever assuming the role of a counterforce to the House of Justice in the sense of
checks and balances, as this expression is generally understood in political
theory; the relationship between the two forces is rather one of mutual
cooperation.113 Indeed, the adoption of mechanisms of state power as means for
the enforcement of the decisions of the House of Justice would be incommen-
surate with the principle of obedience through personal conviction.

9    To none is given the right to put forth his own opinion

In paragraph 3:13 there occurs an ostensibly unambiguous sentence:

> To none is given the right to put forth his own opinion or express his
> particular conviction. (3:13)
Stripped of its context, this statement could easily be understood as a proscrip-
tion of every conceivable expression of personal opinion: taken literally it would
forbid even the word-for-word quotation of passages from the writings of the
central figures of the Faith or from the Universal House of Justice, since the
preference of one particular text selection over another represents in itself the
formulation of a personal opinion. Bereft of the possibility of freely paraphrasing
the writings — what is in the end nothing other than the presentation of one’s
own understanding of the text and therewith the expression of one’s own
viewpoint — the prime duty of every believer to teach the Cause could not be
carried out. And discussion among the friends about the meaning of the holy
writings and the exchange of alternate perspectives in an effort to gain a deeper
mutual understanding would be forbidden, since to do so would involve the
expression of particular convictions. These proscriptions would result in a
situation whereby each Bahaā 'īā would cultivate his own, autonomous system of
belief — assuming that, under these conditions, Bahaā ’īās were at all identifiable as

113 The Vatican Curia should suffice for us as a warning against ever allowing a community-
internal instance to evolve into a self-subsisting counterforce.

such. Healthy common sense suffices to reject such a reading — quite apart from
the fact that this understanding contradicts everything which Bahaā ’u’llaā h and
‘Abdu’l-Bahaā otherwise have to say about the freedom of expression of personal
opinion. It is therefore hardly surprising that there are also concrete text-
analytical considerations which speak decidedly against this reading.

The closing paragraph of the second part of the Will and Testament leaves the
unmistakable impression of a coda, as if ‘Abdu’l-Bahaā considered the Will and
Testament to be completed at that point:

> O God, my God! I call Thee, Thy Prophets and Thy Messengers, Thy Saints
> and Thy Holy Ones, to witness that I have declared conclusively Thy Proofs
> unto Thy loved ones and set forth clearly all things unto them, that they
> may watch over Thy Faith, guard Thy Straight Path and protect Thy
> Resplendent Law. (2:15) [my emphases]
The third part of the Will and Testament was written apparently some time
between 1912 and 1920,114 or in other words, roughly between five and thirteen
years after the composition of the second part in or around 1907. 115 This part
differs in content from the preceding two parts insofar as it neither introduces
new and heretofore undiscussed topics nor offers elucidations to instructions or
injunctions already covered, as the second part does with respect to the first.
Whereas each of the first two parts consists of a relatively arbitrary succession
of diverse themes, the third part takes the form of an essay, structured argumen-
tatively and ending with a conclusion. In light of this structural, thematic and
stylistic disparity it would not be unreasonable to view the third part as an epi-
logue or appendix to, rather than as the continuation of, the Will and Testament.

In contrast to the treatment of the first two parts, analysis of the third part of
the Will and Testament, which is dedicated to the topic of assault against the
Covenant, is best pursued in the order in which ‘Abdu’l-Bahaā composed it, i. e. in
accordance with its own internal logic:

‘Abdu’l-Bahaā commences with a vivid description of the tribulations which He
experienced throughout His own ministry on account of the machinations of the

114 See Sohrab, A., The Will and Testament of Abdul Bahá, An Analysis, p. 14-15.
115 See Research Department of the Universal House of Justice, “The Dating of ‛Abdu’l-Bahaá ’s
Will and Testament”.

“people of malice” (3:2), (3:3), (3:4). He points out that these evil intrigues had
already begun in the first days and hours following the passing of Bahaā ’u’llaā h
(3:6), (3:7). He had long tempered His own reactions in an attempt to veil the
deeds of these confused and rebellious souls, but in the end He was forced to
recognise that His patience had provoked just the opposite of what He had
hoped for (3:7). With the help of true and dedicated friends He succeeded at first
in upholding the solidarity of the community (3:8), but then the enemies of the
Cause of God changed their tactics and began to defame ‘Abdu’l-Bahaā in the eyes
of the Ottoman authorities (3:9).

It was blatantly clear that the intrigues of the Covenant-breakers represented
an existential danger to the Cause of God (3:9). For that reason, ‘Abdu’l-Bahaā
called upon the believers to “entirely shun them, avoid them, foil their machina-
tions and evil whisperings, [and] guard the Law of God and His religion” (3:10).
Finally, He offers advice to the friends concerning the appropriate manner of
counselling individuals or groups of individuals exibiting obstructive behaviour
(3:11).

The salutation which closes paragraph 3:11 introduces the conclusion: the
friends must spare no effort to prevent Shoghi Effendi from suffering the same
fate as He. ‘Abdu’l-Bahaā enjoins the believers to care for the young Shoghi Effendi
and to encourage him in the task before him (3:12). He then confirms for the last
time the standing of Shoghi Effendi as Guardian of the Cause of God, whom
everyone is to obey and to whom everyone must turn:

> For he is, after ‘Abdu’l-Bahaá , the Guardian of the Cause of God, the Afnaá n,
> the Hands (pillars) of the Cause and the beloved of the Lord must obey
> him and turn unto him. He that obeyeth him not, hath not obeyed God; he
> that turneth away from him, hath turned away from God and he that
> denieth him, hath denied the True One.116 (3:13)
It must be remembered that Shoghi Effendi’s appointment as Guardian occurred
initially in the first part of the Will and Testament, i. e. when he was about seven
years old — at an age in which his aptitude for this office would have been
apparent to no-one beside ‘Abdu’l-Bahaā . Shoghi Effendi was at the very least
fifteen years old at the time of the writing of the third part of the Will and

116 Cf. note 66.

Testament, possibly as old as twenty-three: that is, in an age in which a challenge
to his authority on account of his manifest youthfulness would no longer bode
success.

There then follows an urgent warning to the believers. The text reads as if
‘Abdu’l-Bahaā had a premonition of the afflictions which would descend upon
Shoghi Effendi and tragically mirror the tribulations which He himself had had to
endure during His own ministry. He exhorts the believers to watchfulness, in the
hope that the worst may be avoided:

> Beware lest anyone falsely interpret these words, and like unto them that
> have broken the Covenant after the Day of Ascension (of Bahaá ’u’llaá h)
> advance a pretext, raise the standard of revolt, wax stubborn and open
> wide the door of false interpretation.117 To none is given the right to put
> forth his own opinion or express his particular conviction. (3:13) [my
> emphases]
The formulation ‘these words’ (īn kalemāt) refers to the immediately preceding
statement regarding the station of Shoghi Effendi and the duty of obedience to
which he is entitled. “To none is given the right” to use the transfer of office to
Shoghi Effendi as an opportunity “to put forth his own opinion or express his
particular conviction” and thereby interpret this statement in accord with his
own aspirations.118 In hindsight we think immediately of such individuals as
Ruth White and Hermann Zimmer,119 who did exactly that. There are only two
institutions, ‘Abdu’l-Bahaā assures us, which have the right and the authority to
put forward any opinions in this matter:

> All must seek guidance and turn unto the Center of the Cause and the
> House of Justice. And he that turneth unto whatsoever else is indeed in
> grievous error. (3:13)

117 This warning is reminiscent of the self-reference in the Kitāb-i Aqdas: “Whosoever

> interpreteth this verse otherwise than its obvious meaning is deprived of the Spirit of God
> and of His mercy which encompasseth all created things.” (Verse 37)
118 This applied in particular to His roughly twenty years younger half-brother Mirza

> Muhḥ ammad-‘Alīā, who viewed the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahaā and the lack of experience of

119 See Schaefer, U., Towfigh, N., Gollmer, U., Making the Crooked Straight. A Contribution to
Bahá’í Apologetics, Oxford: George Ronald 2000, p. 724ff.

Like the discursive part of the essay, the conclusion is rounded off with the
salutation wa ‘alaikuma’l-bahā’u’l-abhā (3:14).

10 The most perfect balance

Whereas the revealed Word of God is the most perfect balance of our Faith, the
lesser Covenant is the guarantee that this balance will remain unerring in the
future. It is for that reason that the covenantal chain which reaches from God
down to each and every believer — the Covenant of God with Bahaā ’u’llaā h
through the Revelation, the Covenant of Bahaā ’u’llaā h with ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā in the
form of the Kitāb-i ‛Ahd, and finally the Covenant of ‛Abdu’l-Bahaā i. a. with Shoghi
Effendi and the House of Justice through His Will and Testament — is both the
guarantee of the integrity of the Teachings and the legal basis for the
competencies of the institutions of the administrative order.

It is therefore essential that the Will and Testament be read and studied as an
independent document, “free,” as David Hofman explains, “of all objective
conceptions, shapes, colors, institutions, methods, free particularly of any
expectation and of the ‘tales of the past’.” And of all approaches to study, the
methodology of text analysis is the one which is most strongly orientated on the
text and least strongly influenced by popular, often deeply rooted traditions.

In summary, the following picture ensues from the text-analytical exercise
presented here: Through the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahaā the Universal
House of Justice is invested with extensive legislative, judiciary and executive
competencies, of which the executive are to be wholly and the legislative and
judiciary partially delegated: the former to an executive authority to be created
by the Universal House of Justice, the latter to the secondary Houses of Justice
(currently called Spiritual Assemblies). The legislative competency of the
Universal House of Justice comprises two categories, in conformity with existing
literature on this theme here designated ius divinum complementum and ius
humanum ecclesiasticum. The former category is the exclusive purview of the
Universal House of Justice;120 it is restricted to things for which the claim of truth
is an essential and inalienable property and which are thus free from error and

120 See Note 102.

binding in conscience. Being ‘part of the Divine Explicit Text,’ such decisions are
irrevocable.121 Decisions of the second category are limited to practical affairs of
the Bahaā ’īā community and are in principle alterable or revocable. Together with
judicial decisions they are binding in obedience but not inherently free from
error.

The results of this present analysis should be understood as a contribution to
an ongoing discourse. The substantiations which meticulously accompany the
analysis at every step are not there to thwart anticipated counterarguments.
Quite the contrary: it is only through complete disclosure of the thoughts which
lie behind such exegetical exercises that it is at all possible to compare different
perspectives in an ordered fashion.
