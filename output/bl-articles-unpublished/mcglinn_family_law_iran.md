following childbirth).1 These requirements do not apply if the husband is
absent, and so cannot obtain information concerning her menstruation,2 if
the marriage has not been consummated, or if the wife is pregnant.3 It is not
proper to divorce a wife between two menstruations during which
intercourse has taken place, unless the wife is pregnant or is incapable of
conception.4 The effect of these provisions appears to be that both parties
should know whether the wife is pregnant or not at the time of repudiation.
Where a woman is of childbearing age but has no periods, the repudiation
cannot be pronounced until three months after the last intercourse.5

After pronouncing the repudiation, the husband abstains from sexual
intercourse with his wife, and she enters a period of waiting ('iddah) lasting
three menstrual cycles. This is a revocable repudiation: during the three-
month period the husband has the right to revoke his repudiation and take
his wife back without any further formalities, by any act or word that
conveys his intention.6 During this period the wife cannot remarry, and is
entitled to maintenance and does inherit if her husband should die during
that period.

The Civil Code specifies that the repudiation formula must be in clear
and precise wording, and may be uttered by an attorney.7 The divorcer must
be of legal age, in possession of his faculties, must intend the act and not be
under coercion.8 The guardian of a permanently insane person can divorce
his ward’s wife if this is in the interests of his ward. The guardian of a
minor cannot divorce the permanent wife of his ward, but may terminate a
temporary marriage before the end of its term, if this is in the interests of
his ward.9

Since the calculation of the waiting period depends on factors that may
be known with certainty only by the woman (when she heard of her
husband’s death, if and when she menstruates) it is not surprising that the
woman’s simple statement that her waiting period has ended is taken as
sufficient, except where she is ‘under accusation’ or the time since the death
or divorce is shorter than the possible waiting period.6

Shí'a custody rules leave little room for negotiation. Wilaya (the supervision
excercised by the father or paternal grandfather) is incontestable according
to the Civil code, whereas the mother's right to give care (hadana) and have
access is restricted. She has the right to keep her son until the age of two,
and her daughter until the age of seven,5 after which the hadana right passes
to the father. The mother loses her hadana right if she remarries or becomes
insane.6 In short, the post-divorce family is strongly patri-focal, and not
matrifocal as in Malikite countries and western countries.

In the case of the death of either parent, the hadana right passes to the
surviving partner,7 and in the case of the father's absence or disqualification
it passes to the paternal grandfather. Custody is never passed through the
maternal line. Under traditional shí`a law, a widow who remarried would
lose her right of hadana (to her deceased husband's father), but this
provision was cancelled with effect from July 1985.8

Prior to the revolution courts had discretionary power to award custody
to the more suitable parent, but any such rulings must now have lapsed. The
Special Civil Courts now do not have this legal discretion, but can facilitate

> From the perspective of present standards of good governance, the family
> law of Iran, appears to be a ramshackle system, self-contradictory and
> brutally unfair to women and non-Muslims. The law’s provisions foster
> social ills such as multiple sexual partners (for men), the abuse of girls,
> arbitrary divorce, and the relegation of women to an inferior economic
> position. Similar critiques could be levelled against its criminal law system,
> the laws regarding media and press laws and political prisoners, and the
> commercial laws that restrict investment and accountability. Iran is a
> country whose systems of law, in almost every field, have become a major
> part of its problems. There is no immediate way of remedying the ills,
> because of the peculiar constitutional arrangements that have in effect given
> Iran two governments, one under the Leader with effective power but
> functioning under a conception of law which allows only a limited room for
> flexibility, the other made up of an elected legislature whose powers are
> limited to proposing legislation and an ‘executive’ which does not have
> executive power over the most important ministries. Some progress has
> been made, for instance by requiring the registration of divorces, and in this
> respect the system may appear more flexible than the family law systems of
> Sunni countries. The rule that a wife has a right to be paid for doing
> housework is a highly creative solution, giving a wife something she may
> concede in divorce negotiations. However there appears so be no prospect
of achieving the thorough-going reform of family law that is required.

It should not be imagined however that Iranian society and Iranian
