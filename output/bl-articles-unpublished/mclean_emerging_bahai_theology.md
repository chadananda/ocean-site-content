Introduction

In one of his letters to a Bahá'í who had questioned him on the nature of "indirect teaching",
Shoghi Effendi (1897-1957 CE) distinguished the humanitarian or social teachings of the Bahá'í
Faith from those which are "more challenging in character, and are specifically and solely Bahá'í....i
While his response did not name theology directly, a plausible interpretation of Shoghi Effendi's

distinction between the social/humanitarian and "specifically and solely Bahá'í" teachings would
seem to point to the distinctively religious or theological teachings of the Bahá'í Faith. If this
reading is correct, the work of Bahá'í theology would involve certain special challenges, as Shoghi
Effendi's qualifier indicates. This paper is devoted to a discussion of some of these specifically
religious or theological aspects of the Bahá'í Faith.

By Bahá'í theology, I intend the substance of the Bahá'í Revelation, that is the doctrine, or
divinely revealed teachings in the writings of the Founders of the Bábí-Bahá'í Faiths, the Báb and
Bahá'u'lláh, and those of their appointed successors and interpreters,ii what I have called elsewhere
source theology. At a lesser level, I intend by Bahá'í theology the commentary of its scholars of
religion (derivative theology).iii

Although it would be premature to speak of "schools" of Bahá'í theology at this time, one
would however be justified in pointing to three sub-disciplines or functional tendencies of the field.
Exegesis, what Islamic scholars called commentary (tafsir), critical apologetics and philosophical
theology, appear to have emerged thus far as the three leading formative sub-disciplines of Bahá'í
theology. I move now to a few respective considerations of these three areas.

Three Functional Tendencies of Bahá'í Theology

(i) Exegesis

The source of theology lies in reflection upon both the evidences of Divine Revelation and
Holy Writ, for Bahá'u'lláh says: "No breeze can compare with the breezes of Divine Revelation,
whilst the Word which is uttered by God shineth and flasheth as the sun amidst the books of men".iv
He also says that it is "...the irresistible Word of God which is the Cause of the entire creation,
while all else besides His Word are but the creatures and the effects thereof".6 Bahá'í theology,
consequently, should be firmly text-rooted, through either direct or indirect reference. The goal of
exegesis, moreover, aims not only to discover any literal and figurative sense in the text but also to
expand on their wider meaning, thus validating the allusive and comprehensive nature of the Word
of God. The Bahá'í Kerygma Event (BKE)7 reaffirms the reality of divine revelation as Holy Writ,
that is, as the supreme instrument for world reform and spiritual transformation and as the
unsurpassed repository of divine wisdom.

The study of the Bahá'í writings as a personal experience in spiritual deepening may well be
consonant with one of the current postcritical trends of a return to a more holistic, interactive
reader-oriented and literary/narrative approach to scripture that aims for personal and social
transformation, approaches that cohabit uneasily with the older historical-critical method.8
Bahá'u'lláh in a uncompromisingly emphatic underscores the preeminence of His Person as the
"Living Book" to which all other books and scriptures are subjected:

> Say: God, the True One, is My witness that neither the Scriptures of the world, nor all the
> books and writings in existence shall, in this Day, avail you aught without this, the Living
> Book, Who proclaimeth in the midmost heart of creation: "Verily, there is none other God
but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."9

This passage serves as a pointed reminder to scriptural commentators that even though
sacred text permanently sets down the verbal forms of divine revelation, the text itself is not the
ultimate reality, but rather the Author of the text who is a divine, living Being. This suggests that

both exegete and theologian must transcend a mere cognitive understanding of the text and seek to
engage in an interactive personal relationship with the Creator of Holy Writ who is the source of all
knowledge and the door of salvation.

In modern times the disciplines of exegesis and systematic theology have become alienated
from one another a gap that Hans Küng calls a "misery".10 For honest systematics can only be
carried out in light of the texts, and the historical critical method. In the Bahá'í Faith the
collaboration of the two disciplines should remain a close one. One the one hand, systematic
theology should rely to a great extent on the findings of exegesis and commentary, and not view
them merely as auxiliary, even less, subordinate disciplines. On the other hand, the textual skills of
the exegete can find broader applications through the work of the systematic theologian in the
phenomena of comparative religion, and in a broad range of theological motifs.

(ii) Critical Apologetics

The "apologetic impulse"11 that first drove Christian theology has also characterised much of
the work of Bahá'í scholars until now. Yet Bahá'í apology is increasingly revealing a harder, more
critical edge and should continue to serve as the driving force of the Bahá'í Kerygma event (BKE).
A strong apologetical impulse is one of the vital manifestations of a rapidly growing world religion,
and as apology relates to interreligious dialogue, Paul Griffiths argues that without what he calls
"positive apologetics", dialogue becomes "pallid, platitudinous, and degutted."12 Further, it should
be born in mind that apology cannot be reduced merely to justification and defence of the
propositions of religion. David J. Krieger makes the point that Apologia is implicit in all western
worldviews [and sociopolitical systems], either secular or theistic: "...to this day", writes Krieger,
"the pragmatics of theological thinking, indeed all Western thinking, remain determined by what
may be called the apologetic method."13 But religious apologetics is also an attempt to make faith
meaningful to a secular world.

In short, Bahá'í apology is responsible apologetics, that is, a non-autocratic, rational, but
responsible and faithful transmission of the beliefs of the covenantal community by its scholars to
succeeding generations. Bahá'í apologetics, moreover, while it may be committed apologetics, seeks
to respect the spirit of the non-normative, non-confessional science of religion
(Religionswissenschaft) in the light of confessional faith.

(iii) Philosophical Theology

Bahá'í theology is largely philosophical theology. Philosophical theology as I use it both
implies — and does not imply — several strands of meaning. It refers principally to the
philosophical analysis and defence of religious beliefs and is thus related to critical apologetics.
Philosophical theology is not, at least in this perspective, to be understood in the narrow academic
sense as "philosophy of religion", for philosophy of religion may begin from purely rational
premises, as a natural theology which excludes divine revelation. Such a philosophy of religion
would be consequently incompatible with a Bahá'í world view. However, philosophical theology in
a Bahá'í understanding does include a philosophy of life or philosophy of existence which in John
Hick's view is beyond the pale of the term "philosophy of religion".14 The Bahá'í teachings clearly
intend to speak to the concrete realities of human existence in all their aspects.

Since the Bahá'í teachings expound meaningful faith and speak to "real life" human
conditions in an engaged rather than a detached mode, Bahá'í theology retains a large existential

element and cannot consequently be fully equated with a philosophy of religion that excludes
Existenzphilosophie. Moreover, the philosophy of religion, that is "philosophical thinking about
religion",15 as Hick points out, may be done by atheist and agnostic alike, whereas Bahá'í
philosophical theology underscores an understanding which results from an identity of subject and
object. A Bahá'í philosopher of religion who is an agnostic or atheist would be a contradiction in
terms, for the divine philosopher in the Bahá'í view must have some experience of the divine, rather
than pursuing a mere intellectual curiosity about ideas on divinity.

Philosophy of religion, however, must continue to play its role as an indispensable adjunct
to Bahá'í theology, for it sharpens theology's critical sense and deters it from dogmatism, promotes
the scientific spirit of free inquiry, and keeps it in touch with the dialectical method which seeks to
create a new synthesis for seemingly antithetical points of view. While in Islam, falásifa and `Ilm-i-
Kalám were often at odds,16 in the modern day Bahá'í Faith, properly philosophical concepts are
often imbedded at source, that is in the Bahá'í sacred writings, concepts such as Kant's distinction
between the phenomena (appearances), the experiential world of the senses, and the noumena, the
unknown but nonetheless real things-in-themselves, the world of das Ding an sich.17 The numerous
philosophical motifs that are patterned throughout Bahá'í scripture18 indicate, or more properly
should indicate, that the outlook of Bahá'í theology, although grounded in revelation, also looks to
philosophy as a divine science, particularly to its neo-Platonic and Aristotelian versions to which
Islam became so heavily indebted.

The view that philosophy (reason) as much as theology (revelation) leads men to the
knowledge of God was held by the Spanish Muslim Ibn Rushd or Averrroës (1126-96 CE), one of
the protagonists of the so-called "Double Truth" or "Two Truths" theory.19 Ibn Rushd had a strong
influence on the medieval scholastics and especially on the misnamed "Latin Averroists" who were
in reality Aristotelians.20 The great Aquinas was also markedly influenced by Ibn Rushd, whose
teachings, along with those of Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 980-1033 CE), Aquinas often rejected.21
However, unlike Ibn Rushd, Al Farabi and Ibn Siná who all prioritized rational demonstration over
the fundamentalism of dialectical Kalam, Aquinas clearly placed theology above philosophy since
theology was "not derived from creatures, but immediately inspired by the divine light" whereas
philosophy derived "from notions of creatures".22 For Ibn Rushd, however, it is the specific function
of philosophy to lead seekers to the knowledge of God.

In this unified vision of philosophy and theology, the Bahá'í Faith is consonant with several
outstanding contemporary theologians such as Paul Tillich, the last great systematic theologian of
the present age, and Martin Buber, both of whom have grounded their theologies in the borderlands
with philosophy. Tillich's autobiographical sketch On the Boundary as the title indicates, relates that
the pivotal point of Tillich's entire life and thought was seen from within the Grenzsituation
(boundary situation) between philosophy and theology.23 In the Eclipse of God Martin Buber,
whose theology was a telling synthesis of classical prophetic faith and modern existential concerns,
alluded to a saying of Franz Rosenzweig, that divine truth wished to be implored with both hands,
that of philosophy and that of theology.24 And while Buber sees the I-Thou relationship expressed
in its "highest intensity and transfiguration in religious reality", he sees the I-It relationship finding
"its highest concentration and illumination in philosophical knowledge."25 Outside of `Ali Murad
Davudí (dates), former professor of philosophy at the University of Tihran,26 one can scarcely speak
yet of a great Bahá'í philosopher of note in the West, one who has attracted the notice of the
academic community or the reading public, a situation which the twenty first century will hopefully
remedy. If the Bahá'í theologian is the proverbial rare bird, the Bahá'í philosopher is even rarer, at
least for the moment. [Ishraq-i-Khavari].

Systematic Theology, Deconstructionism and the “Bahá'í Theologian”

One reads from time to time an appeal for the Bahá'í systematic theologian to emerge,27 or
references to the Bahá'í systematic theology that is to be. Systematics in this view would represent a
theological apogee or culmination. While following the classical theological model, the appearance
of such a scholar would be highly desirable for a thorough-going and authoritative exposition of the
key doctrines of the Bahá'í Faith, the temper of postmodernity remains as yet decidedly
unsystematic. Although deconstructionism has not by now had a great impact on theology,28 it is
nonetheless dedicated to what Heidegger had already called Abbauen29 or "dismantling", a "de-
construction" of all systems, theological or other, which have in the meantime been relegated to the
hopelessly outdistanced intellectual landscapes of yesteryear, in which once pious or ponderous
speculants or systematisers lived and moved.

Current Bahá'í theology is also characteristically unsystematic through no intent to dismantle
but because it has not yet had sufficient time to construct. Bahá'í theology for the time being is
reminiscent of the genre — as distinguished from the content — of the writings of the scholastics.30
The Bahá'í scholars entering the third millennium, like the scholastics who were on the threshold of
the second, pursue their theological concerns in piecemeal fashion probing a variety of topical
issues. Bahá'í theology is for the present theology à la carte.

It remains at this time an open question whether or not Bahá'í theology will become
systematic in the sense of the doctrinal mega-system. Kierkegaard who was the prime
deconstructionist of his day, critiqued the then predominant Hegelian system of absolute idealism
precisely for its being closed, finite and dehumanising in abstracting the "real" human being out of
existence. According to Kierkegaard's perspective, theology should never amount to a desertion of
human in contradistinction to abstract philosophical considerations of existence. Kierkegaard's
condemnatory question put to the philosophers of his day can apply equally well to any theologian
in ours: what is the good of the medicine if it expels the fever but kills the patient?31 Put differently,
the answer must not only solve the question, it must also remedy the condition of the questioner as
well. If it does not, it is as useless as a weed.

If a systematic Bahá'í theology or theologies were to emerge as aloof, hermetic,
propositional superstructures, such approaches would benefit from a coexistence with more
humane, "real" existential and spiritual theologies. Aristotle, for whom theology formed part of the
larger study of metaphysics, was right almost two and a half millennia ago when he argued that
philosophy must be an investigation of the totality of being qua being: "Now, to sum up, there is a
single science that must view systematically being as being and whatever belongs to it as being.
And the same science examines both primary beings and whatever attributes they have..."32 Humans
certainly qualify as Aristotle's "primary beings", who are above all spiritual beings, not just
ambulating questions, and it is above all the element of spirituality that makes us both essentially
and profoundly human. Aristotle argues for both the system and existence.

Here, I am reminded of Blake's Motto that "I must Create a System or be enslav'd by another
Man's. I will not Reason & Compare: my business is to Create".34 Blake's motto suggests that the
great minds have by nature been system-builders, and that rather than analyse the works of others,
they create their own. Systematics would have the definite advantage of protecting a "unity of
doctrine"35 of the Bahá'í Faith, but this protection should not be won at the cost of erecting an
oppressive monolith which by its monotone silences the voices of diversity.

If and when, then, the Bahá'í systematic theologian does emerge, he or she will hopefully

welcome human existence into the considerations of theology and thereby avoid the monolithic and
totalitarian nature that have characterised the thought systems of the past. Although Chairman
Mao's political ideology demanded that both the arts and sciences be pressed into the service of
Communism,36 nevertheless his saying of "letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools
of thought contend..."37 is a welcome indicator of the manifold diversity that should characterise the
development of Bahá'í theology. Such diversity appears, moreover, to be the favoured prescription
by many present-day proponents of "global theology" or theology tout court, as we head into the
third millennium. Martin E. Marty writes, for example, in Theology Today:

> What theology tomorrow calls forth is what I call variously a multiplex, multifocal,
> multivocal, and multimodel approach. Such an approach attempts to do justice at once to
> the particularities that do exist and the universals that both world survival and, in the
present case, Christian belief demand.38

For some global theologians, such as Raimundo Panikkar, who was perhaps the first to
challenge the "common core" theory,39 the many doctrinal varieties in pluralism (=my way is only
one way of many with no common goal) are not to be papered over at the expense of postulating
any objectified, abstracted or unified vision of the Real or Ultimate Truth à la John Hick.40 The
"many" continues to vie with the "one". Hans Küng, however, argues for a drive to universalist
thinking, to a "transition from particularist to universal thinking, from a "theology of controversy"
to an "ecumenical theology", "...a theology that sees in every other theology not an opponent but a
partner, is bent on understanding instead of separation...".41

Dogmatism, Relativity, Perennial Philosophy and Shoghi Effendi's Kerygmatic Theology42

Dogmatism is the much feared bogeyman of theology for postmoderns. Deconstructionism
has set about dismantling what it views as all dogmatic, authoritarian, fixed or monolithic systems
on the pretext of contextualising or relativising meaning. Some may wish to laud deconstructionism,
then, for its overthrow of the totalitarian mega-system, be it theological or other, and the large place
that has been left for the pluralized universe of the individual's microcosmic view of this or that
corner of the cognitive world.

However, theology — Bahá'í or other — should have as one its preeminent goals the
communal objectivisation of truth, even though truth largely transcends any logical strictures to
which it is confined by human thought. Now truth, as Peter Berger has pointed out in
commonsensical fashion, resists relativization.43 Spiritual truth, following the view of those who
hold to a Sophia perennis et universalis or to its other guise as primordial tradition,44 is everywhere
and always the same, even though it may appear in many a disguise. However, even if one granted
that there are no absolute truths in the sense of contradiction-free statements, the truth is certainly
absolute in the existential claim that it makes upon our lives.

When Shoghi Effendi refers to the relativity of religious truth in conjunction with
progressive revelation as "the fundamental principle which constitutes the bedrock of Bahá'í
belief",45 he is most likely not rejecting the notion of absolute truth, for `Abdu'l-Bahá has elsewhere
said:

> The spiritual aspect of religion is the greater [than the practical/formal], the more important
> of the two, and this is the same for all time, it never changes! It is the same, yesterday,
> today, and for ever! `As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be.'46

To address, at least in part, these timeless eternal truths in their momentary and situational
garments, is the work of Bahá'í theology.

It is significant that Shoghi Effendi mentions the relativity of religious truth in conjunction
with progressive revelation, for the key to his statement would seem to be that the relativity of
religious truth becomes meaningful in the context of dispensational religion.47 The Bahá'í view of
dispensational religion would seem to be that religious truth is relative both to a given point in the
historical evolution of successive revelations from God (world religions) and to the state of current
understanding.

Shoghi Effendi's theology might be called kerygmatic or a theology of the Word, for his task
is to take up and pass on the Word of Bahá'u'lláh, while more clearly defining its content. As
kerygma (proclamation), Shoghi Effendi's theological writings resemble preaching or rhetorical
theology, for he seeks as much to move, as he does to intellectually convince his readers, and his
texts are characteristically exhortative, emphatic and triumphant.48 That Shoghi Effendi's theology
is in part rhetorical is no denigration. Scriptural scholar George A. Kennedy puts it that "all
religious systems are rhetorical",49 and to use Christianity as a reference point, there has been much
rhetorical theology throughout its history. The rhetorical intent of Shoghi Effendi's theology is also
understandable since theologica rhetorica is connected with proclamation and teaching.

Deconstruction, however, has lead to a fragmentation of human discourse, in which
consensual meaning (logocentrism) has been carelessly jettisoned. Deconstructionism's vision of
language as nothing more than an endless chain in a "play of difference"50 has called into question
the viability of language itself, the very meaning of meaning. Ineluctably, deconstructionism must
lead to a nihilistic deconstruction of itself. Its questionable attack on the meaning of language has
had the effect of weakening the vitality of any belief system upon which religion to a great extent
depends. Deconstructionism's incessant contextualisation of language would forgo or reduce that
question so vital to religion — what can we or do we believe?

Many a sub-culture may answer in the affirmative that it shares common beliefs, but even
within sub-cultures fragmentation proceeds unabated. Today especially, it is imperative that the
world community begin to formulate some common global philosophy (pansophism/panlogism) and
values, if for no other reason than as an imperative to survival. It should, moreover, be mentioned in
this context that the global theologians are a rare lead-group of twentieth century intellectuals who
are at least attempting to define some common core in world ethics, spiritual values, and world
theology.51 Here the theologians may well take a lead from the literati. As literature seeks to
express itself in the language of the universal, and thus make itself more accessible, so should
theology increasingly strive to speak the language of universal spiritual experience.

Although dogmatism may offend a postmodern view of theology, it would not be true to
assert that Bahá'í theology is entirely non-dogmatic. The unconditional nature of the Word of God is
uncompromising in it proclamation of the truth. Yet, Bahá'u'lláh, at the same as He is fearless in the
salvific truths He proclaims, also exhorts his followers to an ethic of open-mindedness and
sympathetic understanding in their dialogue with members of other religions.52 Moreover, Shoghi
Effendi's commentaries on Bahá'í scripture such as The Dispensation of Bahá'u'lláh which is a
classic theological treatise, is also uncompromising or dogmatic in its authoritative exposition of
Bahá'í belief. In his role of Guardian and defender of the Faith, Shoghi Effendi's theological rhetoric
was markedly dogmatic in the rejection of those theologies that did not concord with his
authoritative interpretation of Bahá'í scripture.53 Indeed, the Universal House of Justice has affirmed
that Shoghi Effendi's interpretations of Bahá'í scripture are quite authoritative: "The Guardian

reveals what the Scripture means; his interpretation is a statement of truth which cannot be
varied."54 However, following the pluralism of meaning implicit in the Word of God, other
interpretations of the same text respecting the integrity of Shoghi Effendi's hermeneutic are valid.

However, Shoghi Effendi advocates a more "liberal theology"55 in his advocacy of the
hermeneutic of the "correlation" of the Bahá'í principles "to modern aspects of philosophy and
science"56 and in his recommendation "to correlate" the Bahá'í Faith with "all the progressive
movements and thoughts being put forth today."57 This openness to the spirit of modernity is
coupled with Bahá'u'lláh's counsel "not to view with too critical an eye the sayings and writings of
men", and to "rather approach such sayings and writings in a spirit of openmindedness and loving
sympathy".58 Despite the Bahá'í Faith's drawing of clear lines in its own doctrinal understanding of
religious truth, its intellectual tolerance as attested to by Arnold Toynbee59 and others leaves an
open door for rapprochement.

The Debt of Bahá'í Theology to `Ilm-al-Kalám

Shoghi Effendi has made strong recommendations that Bahá'ís:
> ...must strive to obtain, from sources that are authoritative and unbiased, a sound
> knowledge of the history and tenets of Islám — the source and background of their Faith
> — and approach reverently and with a mind purged form preconceived ideas the study of
the Qur'án...60

Yet in my view it would put a limitation on Bahá'í theology to reduce it entirely to the
categories and terminology of its Islamic antecedents, as important as these are. Bahá'í theology
must seek increasingly to become universal, that is, its scholars, wherever they reside, would do
well to interpret the Bahá'í teachings in correlation with the teachings of the world's great religions.

Bahá'í scholars with backgrounds in Islamic-Bábí-Bahá'í studies have made valuable inroads
into Bahá'í scholarship, inroads that have produced scholarly works of quality. Yet, it seems to me
that more work has to be done, not only on the parallels between Islam and the Bábí-Bahá'í faiths,
but also on how Bahá'í theology is distinguished from its Islamic antecedents. Stephen Lambden,
for example, recognizes that "Typically Sufistic terminology and hermeneutics permeate certain of
the writings of the Báb" and "Qur'ánic exegesis in Bábí-Bahá'í scripture is quite frequently, in one
way or another, Sufistic.". Lambden, however, makes the important distinction that "The modern
Bahá'í Faith, however, is not merely neo-Sufi. It is only peripherally and in certain doctrinal areas
Sufistic."61

Shoghi Effendi's recommendation that Bahá'ís thoroughly familiarize themselves with the
history and teachings of Islam as "the source and background of their Faith" should also be read
jointly with the following statement of `Abdu'l-Bahá made during his lecture tour of North America
in 1912. At Eighth Street Synagogue in Washington, D.C., in a talk during which he challenged the
Jews in the assembly to accept Christ as "a Manifestation of the Word of God"62, `Abdu'l-Bahá said:

> Praise be to God! You are living in a land of freedom. You are blessed with men of
> learning, men who are well versed in the comparative study of religions. You realize the
> need of unity and know the great harm which comes from prejudice and superstition. I ask
> you, is not fellowship and brotherhood preferable to enmity and hatred in society and
community? The answer is self-evident.63

`Abdu'l-Bahá's statement suggests that not only is comparative religion — now referred to

increasingly as global theology — an instrument for learning and the alleviation of the blight of
religious superstition and prejudice, but also infers that it is a vehicle for furthering societal
harmony through interfaith association and dialogue.

The Knowledge of the Spiritual Self as a Convergence of Theology and Spirituality

Postmodernism has attempted to void the notion of self as nothing more than a social
construct.64 Yet in Bahá'í theology the self is a basic category that is the common property of both
philosophical theology and mysticism. According to Juan Ricardo Cole whose paper "Bahá'u'lláh
and Liberation Theology" appears in this volume, the "Self of God"(nafs illahí) would seem "to
refer to the totality of God's active attributes, of which the prophets and messengers are
manifestations."65 The individual, divine self mirrors the Self of God through all of the names and
attributes of God (Ar. Asmá wa Sifát Alláh).66 On the individual level, Shoghi Effendi makes a
binary distinction in the understanding of the self: one, the divine self, the identity of the individual
created by God, the other, the ego "....the dark, animalistic heritage each one of us has, the lower
nature that can develop into a monster of selfishness, brutality, lust and so on."67

In Bahá'í mysticism, the ideal self is found in the first valley of The Four Valleys (Cháhár
Vadí) as the beloved self: "On this plane, the self is not rejected but beloved; it is well-pleasing and
not to be shunned."68 Bahá'u'lláh's location of the origin of the human self in the Self of God are
echoed in Peter Berger's telling statement: "In other words, there can be no self without God".69 In
Bahá'í perspective he who would void self voids God. Such a vital metaphysical reality as the self
as soul cannot be so easily annihilated.

By "the knowledge of spiritual self" I refer to the individual's understanding of the Divine
Word and the concrete experiences of living-in-the-world as progenitors of understanding. The
knowledge of spiritual self will illumine the understanding of spiritual anthros, and inspire or enrich
the life of the believer. Otherwise, theology will remain restricted to that knowledge which `Abdu'l-
Bahá's describes as being confined to the realm of "Thought that belongs to the world of thought
alone."70 The knowledge of the spiritual self refers, then, to an understanding of self and others as
living and acting divine beings. In this perspective, spiritual experience and spiritual knowledge are
perceived as existing together as one thing, in a symbiotic relationship in which theory and practice
function as one manifold. For Bahá'u'lláh emphatically declares that the discovery of the knowledge
of self as the knowledge of God will lead to the acquisition of vast wisdom and knowledge.

> I swear by God, O esteemed and honoured friend! Shouldst thou ponder these words in
> thine heart [`He hath known God who hath known himself.'], thou wilt of a certainty find
> the doors of divine wisdom and infinite knowledge flung open before thy face.71

The knowledge of the spiritual self (self-knowledge) would here be perceived as the highest form of
knowledge worth possessing, for it is a more perfect knowledge that constitutes both end and
means.

The spiritual anthropology of the believer distinguishes the spiritual person as the
preeminent creation of God. The knowledge of the spiritual self involves, moreover, what `Abdu'l-
Bahá has called "the discovery of the verities of life"72 and `ilm-i vújúdí (the knowledge of
being/existence),73 critical areas that have been thus far conspicuously lacking in Bahá'í theology.
Further, such an approach to Bahá'í theology alludes to the growth of the soul in its continual
evolution toward the ultimate and final goal of spiritual life, union with God which is the proprium
of mysticism. The main purpose of religion, as the Bahá'í writings repeatedly affirm, is spiritual

transformation74 which is but another word for enhanced self-knowledge.

It is underscored that this knowledge of the spiritual self is not merely theoretical, however,
but derives from and leads to praxis (practical ethics). It is savoir-faire or "know-how" and should
be distinguished from knowledge as an end in itself. Self-knowledge as praxis or know-how is an
empirical form of spiritual science that is distinguished from speculation or analysis. Such
knowledge includes both principle and practice. In this context, the renowned literary critic,
Northrop Frye, has referred to a useful distinction created by Plato. Plato distinguished nous from
dianoia. Nous75 is knowledge of things, as distinguished from dianoia, knowledge about things. The
knowledge of things, Frye says, "implies some identification or essential unity of subject and
object", whereas dianoia implies a dichotomy of subject and object.76 Nous would refer, then, to
participatory knowledge and dianoia to detached knowing. The knowledge of the self relates to
nous, that is a direct, intuitive form of knowledge with which the knowing subject is intimately
connected, a knowledge which leads to praxis, or some deeper insight or wisdom.

Similarly, Simone Weil in Leçons de philosophie (Lectures on Philosophy)77 writes
regarding the injunction of the Delphic maxim `Know thyself'(gnothi sauton)78 written over
Apollo's shrine that by it Socrates meant self-knowledge, in contradistinction to knowledge about
external things, as "the ultimate end of all thought."79 Weil comments further on the famous dictum:
"It seems to have meant: `Why do you have to come and ask me about the secrets of nature, of the
future? All you need to do is know yourself".80 She states further about self knowledge: "The
knowledge of external things has no real interest, or, at least, is of less interest for men in general
than self-knowledge. And, what is more, self-knowledge is the only thing that gives any value to
any thought and action you care to think about."81

While this comment is merely stipulative, Weil writes that the meaning of self-knowing is
ambiguous. She understands three ordinary meanings to self-knowing: (1) knowing oneself in order
to change, to correct oneself [transformation]. This would be self-knowledge as a means while
Socrates viewed self-knowledge as an end (2) knowing oneself in order to find out what one is
capable of doing, to make good use of oneself [the release of potential]. (3) Following Montaigne,
knowing oneself in order to come to know human nature.[self-understanding to understand
others].82 By a process of shorthand dialectic, however, Weil concludes that the "self is a term
which has no meaning",83 yet she comes to the ethical insight at the conclusion of her lecture that
"In all circumstances, to be a man, is to know how to separate the `I' and `self'. This is a task which
never ends."84 Weil here seems to be making a similar distinction found in the Bahá'í sacred
writings between the "higher" and "lower" self.85 Weil's `I' would represent the ego, elemental or
selfish desires and the `self', the magnanimity or self-sacrifice of the spiritual individual.

Some modern-day theologians have also come to the realisation that theology cannot be
integral without spirituality (the knowledge of self). After centuries of having staked out their
territory from the more "pastoral" concerns of spirituality, certain scholars of religion maintain that
the partition between the two domains is no longer tenable. From the same academies of religion
that have been devoted to Max Müller's advocacy of Religionswissenschaft86 dating back to 1867,
new voices are now being heard that have seriously begun to question this sundering of personal
spiritual beliefs from the objective question. This recent trend toward an integration of the
spirituality of the believer with the performative aspects of the intellect, although it has more
ancient roots in medieval Christianity and Islam,87 is fully consonant with the Bahá'í Faith.

David Tracy, one of North America's preeminent theologians, has outlined some of the
benefits to the performative aspects of theology in its recovery of spirituality. In a conversation with

Todd Breyfogle and Thomas Levergood, Tracy declares the present necessity of a much-needed
collaboration:

> I think that theology will be better off the more theologians attempt to recover a
> relationship to traditions of spirituality and thus undo the separation of theology and
> spirituality that developed after medieval scolasticism, which made a distinction between
the two without separating them.88

For David Tracy "...an absolutely crucial part of the undoing of that separation would be, in
theology, spiritual attentiveness to the presence of God in all of life, including [and perhaps
especially] theology".89 Further, the "crucial part", for Tracy, of a synthesis of the spiritual and
theological dimensions would be a recovery of both the mystical and prophetic traditions.90 [Diana
Eck]

Bahá'í scholars of religion, particularly, could render a great service to the discipline of
theology were they to begin to restore the consciousness and practice of spirituality to the study of
theology.91 Purely theoretical approaches to the study of religion would appear to fall into the trap
of `Abdu'l-Bahá's pointed critique of religion as "the noise, the clamor, the hollowness of religious
doctrine."92 Marcus Bach reports a comment of Shoghi Effendi that is relevant to this point: "Men
have been so absorbed in the study of theology that they have neglected the study of life."93

The three-pronged exegetical, apologetical and philosophical theological approaches that
have thus far defined Bahá'í theology, by the predominance of a detached objectivism, have created
a benign neglect of other capital questions such as practical ethics or spirituality which `Abdu'l-
Bahá has defined as "the fundamental aspect of the religion of God".94 Such "objective" approaches
have tended to divorce Bahá'í theology from the existential experience of the individual believer.
The detached-objective mode of Bahá'í theology has also resulted in a certain monotony of
discourse for a religion that increasingly demands a pluralism of meaning.

The Recovery of the Prophetic Tradition

David Tracy's advocacy of the recovery of the prophetic tradition is, of course, deeply
meaningful for Bahá'ís. The Bahá'í Faith since its inception in 1844 has not only advocated the
recovery of prophetic teaching as the treasury of the world's wisdom, but remains fully immersed in
it through the voluminous writings of the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá. While the Bahá'í Faith
claims to be a new, distinct and universal revelation, its message is also a restatement and a
reaffirmation of the prophetic messages gone before. It comes then, Bahá'ís believe, as the
fulfilment of a long line of prophetic dispensations in the classical sense of the word,95 but sees
itself inextricably bound with the revelations that have gone before it.

The enormous influence of the prophets or Manifestations of God within history is
ubiquitous and still largely unsuspected. The literature on prophethood is vast, and there is no space
here for appreciating the distinctions and variations in the various cultural forms of prophetic office
throughout history, both in Europe and the Middle East, such as the ecstatic cultic Pythia (priestess)
and associate prophet of Apollo's oracle-shrine at Delphi, the prophetic brotherhoods in ancient
Israel, or even for comparing the significant differences in the missions and teachings of the earlier
Ro'éh (seers, visionaries) and later prophets (Nebí'ím, sing. Nábí) among the company of divine
messengers of Israel and Judah. However, I move now inter alia96 to three brief considerations of
prophetic teaching: (i) prophetic apophasis as one of the foundation stones for the unity of the
world's great religions (ii) the unity of the prophets (iii) the prophets as role models of spirituality.

The first point concerns the very strong potential that the prophetic via negativa of the
divine apophasis holds for laying down one of the common foundational beliefs of the world's great
religions. Stephen N. Lambden has well covered the ground with his paper "The Background and
Centrality of Apophatic Theology in Bábí and Bahá'í Scripture" (pp. 00-00) which engages the
reader in a comparative study of the point with Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The apophasis of
the divine teachers, their reverent silence for the Divine Ipseity, the unknown, inaccessible essence
of God-Háhút as taught in Sufi speculative mystical theology, is a teaching which in various guises
shares common ground in the Abrahamic Faiths. But it also has implications worth exploring in the
religions of Asia. Hinduism's Nirguna Brahman, God without attributes, as taught by mystic
philosopher Sankará (Sankaracharya) (circa 788-820 CE), has clear apophatic dimensions as
contrasted with Saguna Brahman,97 God with attributes, and the Nirguna Brahman of the Katha
Upanishad (6:7,8) is precisely the apophatic God. As to the nontheistic nature of Buddhism,
comparative religionist Raimundo Panikkar in The Silence of God. The Answer of the Buddha
(1989), maintains that the Buddha cannot qualify either as an agnostic or an atheist (9-10). Panikkar
writes: "God remains obscure, unknown, incomprehensible, mysterious. On his salvation journey,
Shákyamuni prescinds [leaves out of consideration] from God....The Buddha is silent of God."98
Such a statement has apophatic implications.

The second point concerns the collegiality of the prophets. Bahá'u'lláh asks us to see the
prophets with the "eye of oneness",99 and be sensitive to their correlative and complementary
functions. Despite the liberalism observed by the dialogue theologians and the academic community
of religionists generally, the adherents of the world's faiths have not yet totally divested themselves
of that mind-set of "religious nationalism", in Joachim Wach's phrase, which betrays us into
believing, however subtly, that the founder of one great religion is superior in some particular way
to another. And certainly the Bahá'í Faith makes the clear distinction, as does the Quran ("Even as
He hath revealed "Some of the Apostles We have caused to excel the others.")100, that the intensity
of the light is greater in some of the prophets than in others. But it is interesting — and it is as if to
downplay this greater intensity that shines more in the globe of some divine lamps than in others —
that Bahá'u'lláh says: "They only differ in the intensity of their revelation, and the comparative
potency of their light"101 [emphasis mine]. Bahá'u'lláh, it appears, is drawing our attention not so
much to the degree of intensity in the divine luminosity of the individual prophet, but rather to the
genesis of the diaphanous light itself.

Put more literally, Bahá'u'lláh has excluded the notion of moral, salvific, psychological or
metaphysical superiority from the discussion of one religion and another, a mode we are liable to
slip into when we compare, since the natural human tendency is to make value judgements and
appraisals when faced with differences. Such fine distinctions may be appropriate in our mundane
choice of gourmet coffee or automobiles, but the only heavenly distinction that Bahá'u'lláh requires
us to make is the one that says all the Divine Manifestations are excellent in their moral authority,
their psychological wisdom, the purity of their lives and their saving grace: "Every one of Them is
the Way of God that connecteth this world with the realms above, and the Standard of His Truth
unto every one in the kingdoms of earth and heaven."102

And while comparative religion has served its students well in counteracting religious
nationalism, in accentuating the diversity that makes for the richness and beauty of the multi-
motifed tapestry of the great world's religions, and in bringing to light the distinctive features of
each one, in respect to any purported or potential superiority of one prophet over another "all
comparisons are odious". For they, Bahá'u'lláh teaches, are to be considered as one soul, and so, he
tells us, they considered themselves: "For they are all but one person, one soul, one spirit, one

being, one revelation."103 Bahá'u'lláh's imperative of prophetic unity goes even further. It is
categorical and absolute, and he ties into the very fabric of belief in God:

> Whoso maketh the slightest possible difference between their persons, their words, their
> messages, their acts and manners, hath indeed disbelieved in God, hath repudiated His
signs, and betrayed the Cause of His Messengers.104

Thus in the Bahá'í view, the messengers are one and their cause is one. That the prophets of
God did not, prior to the coming of Bahá'u'lláh, emphasize their intrinsic metaphysical unity only
indicates the divine wisdom in foreseeing humanity's former incapacity to appreciate the prophetic
oneness, given geographical impediments, cultural isolation and the provincialisms imposed by
space-time.

But it should also be noted that the silence of the prophets on this point was not complete,
and they certainly did allude to it in certain of their sayings. Moses says, for example,: "The Lord
your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brethren — him you
shall heed — ..."And whoever will not give heed to my words which he shall speak in my name, I
myself will require it of him" (Deuteronomy 18: 15, 18).105 In what appears to be a remarkable
fulfilment of that prophecy, Jesus said: "Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father; it is
Moses who accuses you, on whom you set your hope. If you believed Moses, you would believe
me, for he wrote of me. But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?"
(John 5:45-47). Bahá'u'lláh likewise tells us: "Thus hath Muhammad, the Point of the Qur'an,
revealed: "I am all the Prophets." Likewise, He saith: "I am the first Adam, Noah, Moses, and
Jesus." Similar statements have been made by Imam 'Ali".106 Further, `Abdu'l-Bahá tells us that
within the Abrahamic religions each of the prophets covenanted as to the coming of the Divine
Manifestation who succeeded him.107

Now that the door of the Adamic cycle has been closed in the coming of the Prophet
Muhammad, "the Seal of the Prophets" (khátam al-nabíyyín),108 and the door to a new and greater
cycle been flung wide open, a cycle already characterised by the first stirrings of the unity of the
human race, as perceived by Arnold J. Toynbee, Wilfred Cantwell Smith and many others, it is now
both timely and expedient to expand on Bahá'u'lláh's teaching of the "essential unity" of the
prophets as one of the greatest aids in the pacification and reconstruction of a united human race.
Cantwell Smith has written of our epoch-making century as a harbinger for world unity:

> Future historians, it has been said, will look back upon the twentieth century not primarily
> for its scientific achievements but as the century of the coming-together of peoples, when
> all mankind became for the first time became one community.109

For to use a poetic analogy, when mountain-climbing, one has to reach a certain altitude
(vertically), just as the human race has reached a culminating point in the time-line of its collective
history (horizontally), before one can pause to survey the vista below and be truly awed by the
scene. Such is the broad pattern now visible to those who contemplate the history of the prophets.

While he does not attempt to level out the particularity of the message of each Divine
Manifestation to an indiscrete, bland sameness, to "some sort of something or other", Bahá'u'lláh
draws our attention especially to this station of "pure abstraction" and "essential unity" of the divine
messengers:

> If thou wilt observe with discriminating eyes, thou wilt behold Them all abiding in the
> same tabernacle, soaring in the same heaven, seated upon the same throne, uttering the

same speech, and proclaiming the same Faith. Such is the unity of those Essences of
Being, those Luminaries of infinite and immeasurable splendor!110

Based on a historic interview with Shoghi Effendi, comparative religionist Marcus Bach
relates in simple but telling words the thoughts of the former head of the Bahá'í Faith on the being
and mission of the prophets as "The greatest forces in the world..."111

> Through them God makes Himself known and carries civilization forward. They are His
> messengers. They live, and it is God living among men. They speak, and it is God's word.
> They suffer, and it is God bearing the pain and the sin of the world. They take upon
> themselves disdain and persecution, and it is God bowing His head and baring His shoulders
> to the whips and scourges of His children. They die, and it is God who weeps. They ascend,
and it is God in His glory who again shows man His true estate.112

The third point concerns the prophets as credible role models of spirituality. In their
acquiescence to the Divine Will throughout their sorrow-laden lives and in the execution of their
missions, the prophets have manifested a singular, exemplary faithfulness and detachment. In
responding readily to the call of God as depicted in the various "call narratives"113, and in their
fierce devotion to the Truth He mandated them to reveal, the divine Manifestations proved
themselves to be the most ready instruments for the proclamation of the divine purpose. When they
felt it was justified, the God-borne audacity that surged out from their prophetic charisma ("gift of
grace"),114 drove them to be anti-syncretistic, anti-cultic, and on occasion even anti-monarchical.
Our very sense of judgement has been born out of their discriminatory moral sense, and the
judgements they pronounced on nations, kings and priests.

Bahá'u'lláh writes that the very revolutionary changes brought about by these anti-
institutional non-conformists in the proclamation of new laws and the reformation of former
religious teachings was the very cause of rejection by their contemporaries:

> Consider how men for generations have been blindly imitating their fathers, and have been
> trained according to such ways and manners as have been laid down by the dictates of their
> Faith. Were these men, therefore, to discover suddenly that a Man, Who hath been living in
> their midst, Who, with respect to every human limitation, hath been their equal, had risen
> to abolish every established principle imposed by their Faith — principles by which for
> centuries they have been disciplined, and every opposer and denier of which they have
> come to regard as infidel, profligate and wicked, — they would of a certainty be veiled and
hindered from acknowledging His truth.115

The worth of these exceptional individuals, moreover, has been made plain for all who care
to examine their lives. William Elmslie writes:

> Knowledge of Hebrew Prophecy is knowledge of the lives of glorious personalities; only
> when name after name of the prophets calls up the memory of lonely insight into truth, of
> unbreakable loyalty to duty, maintained through scorn and hatred and despite despair, can
its splendour be realised.116

It is very largely through the steadfastness of the Prophets in the face of the incredible
adversity that has always been mounted against them that human personality has become defined in
its most noble aspects. Their lives have given credence to the meaning of authenticity. For the
prophets, unlike most armchair philosophers, are themselves the first exemplars of their profoundly
ethical teachings. Although their writings reflect a clear awareness of the depths of metaphysical

truth, they are no mere speculants. Before all others, the prophets discovered the secret to the
equation that faith is life, and life is faith. For them life is intrinsically sacred and hallowed with
divine meaning. They are willing, moreover, to pay the supreme sacrifice for the sake of credibility.
For they know, that lest their blood be spilled, lest their way be agony, they will not be believed.
Belief, for them, is wrought not by discursive reason but by example.

Bahá'u'lláh asks us to "Examine the wondrous behaviour of the Prophets..."117 and he affirms
that a careful examination of their lives and the reasons for the opposition they faced will lead to an
increase of faith:

> Should you acquaint yourself with the indignities heaped upon the Prophets of God, and
> apprehend the true causes of the objections voiced by their oppressors, you will surely
> appreciate the significance of their position. Moreover, the more closely you observe the
> denials of those who have opposed the Manifestations of the divine attributes, the firmer
will be your faith in the Cause of God.118

The prophets were, moreover, profoundly action-oriented. Their lives both answer and
transcend the criterium which Goethe set for himself in a letter to Friedrich Schiller stating his
preference for the reciprocity of learning and activity: "Moreover I hate everything which merely
instructs me without increasing or directly quickening my activity."119 As untutored teachers, the
prophets dispensed learning by the sheer force and cogency of their meaning, the beauty of their
words, the integrity of their lives. Through them "the individual's aspiration towards God" (prayer
and longing) and the sense of "individual responsibility" (promise and covenant) and "the instincts
of personal piety" (spirituality)120 became well-established in the history of religion. Without them,
the words "the knowledge of God" would never have been written.

The Bahá'í Faith and the Truth Claim

The advent of the revelations of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh in the last century has brought to
the fore in compelling fashion once again the issue of the truth-claim. The phenomenon of the truth-
claim is one of those patterns that runs through the comparative study of religion, for all the major
prophets of God claimed to be, not only revelators of divine truth, but more significantly the truth
itself. Any claim on the prophet's part to reveal divine truth and/or to be the living embodiment of
truth should strike us as a dramatically singular claim, worthy of the most serious attention.

Curiously, however, the modern academic study of religion has to a large extent jettisoned
any preoccupation with the truth-claim. In this context, Huston Smith questions the sorry neglect of
the paramount question of the investigation of the truth itself. In "Postmodernism's Impact on the
Study of Religion", a paper that critiques modernity's consequences for the study and teaching of
religion, Smith writes:

> So we pour our departmental energies into features of religion that have objective,
> empirical grounding — philology, archaeology, historical influences and textual parallels
> — and bracket the question of whether the beliefs that generated those fallouts were
mistaken or true.121

Precisely. It would appear, however, that the fear of offending another's religious beliefs lies
behind this neglect, and has created, at least in the polite world of academic protocol, a virtual no
man's land where few dare to address the issue of the seeming incompatibility of the key doctrines
of the world's great religions. And yet, according to `Abdu'l-Bahá's dictum, if "the shining spark of

truth cometh forth only after the clash of differing opinions",122 scholars must find a way of
expressing their views when they have honest differences with particular components of other
religious systems, without expressing the hostile extremism that is so characteristic of
fundamentalism. The detached objectivism that merely portrays the characteristics of this system or
that, only describes some theological construct or other from a distance, and does not dare to
evaluate, would seem to be lacking in one of the most requisite characteristics of the scholar —
critical judgement. Lack of commitment to one's own fully integrated understanding of the truth, in
the long run, rather does a disservice to the power of truth in its acquisition of faith and certitude.
This reluctance to engage in challenging debate and dialogue has resulted in a consequent dilution
in the powers of human thought and levelled out the belief systems to the lowest common
denominator.

John Hick is one of the few notable scholars of religion today to have asserted that the
critical evaluation of truth-claims cannot be set aside, even at the risk of sparking contention.
During an address given to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the World's Parliament of
Religions at the Church of Scotland Assembly Hall in Edinburgh on 2 October 1993 Hick said:

> For many involved in dialogue, this practical focus means leaving on one side the thorny
> question of the conflicting truth-claims of our different traditions. Many hold that we are
> still not ready to tackle those questions, and should not risk contention by bringing them
> forward. My own view is that genuine questions of belief cannot be avoided and that we
> must prepare ourselves to face them — not instead of matters of practical cooperation but,
for some of us at least, as well as these.123

Hick's challenge not only causes us to confront the issue, but he also suggests a bipolar
outcome. The first is exclusionary. The second is conciliatory. The first is the either/or clause, the
logic that says A cannot be B, that truth cannot admit of error:

> One is the conclusion that our respective doctrines are simply contradictory and
> irreconcilable, and that this sets a final limit to the developing relations between the
different religious traditions.124

Hick's conciliatory option is based on three analogies. The first lies in the duck-rabbit
picture-perspective of Wittgenstein. Hick argues through the Wittgenstein's analogy that because of
cultural antecedents the ones who see a duck, and the others who see a rabbit, are both right. But
one is not right to maintain that the other is either confused or mistaken. For the others' perception
of either duck or rabbit is as valid as ours. The second analogy is based on Niels Bohr's wave-
particle complement in the physics of the 1950's. Seemingly divergent, even irreconcilable views of
the Absolute and God and practices of prayer and meditation in Hinduism, Zen and Christianity can
be simultaneously embraced because the practitioners cause the light of the Real to behave
metaphorically in some situations as interference effects (waves), and in others as photoelectric
reactions (particles). Both reactions are true and real relative to the observer's perception of the
light. The third analogy is from cartography, an analogy also used by Huston Smith in an article on
science and religion.125 Hick compares the theologies of the world's great religions to the gnomonic,
stereographic, and orthographic types of projections used by cartographers. Any mode of projection
inevitably distorts a map, but it does not follow that one mode is accurate and the others are
inaccurate. All are accurate, but all, to some extent, distort.126

In their own estimates of the veracity of certain key doctrines of the world faiths, the
founders of the Bahá'í Faith oscillate between the exclusionary and the conciliatory modes. While

the exclusionary mode certainly dominates, for example, in the proclamation of Bahá'u'lláh's
prophethood, i.e., the Bahá'í writings exclude the possibility of Bahá'u'lláh's being anything but a
divine Manifestation of God, and while there are also clear rejections of pantheism and incarnation
theology, other passages allow for more open door interpretations of these same doctrines. For one
thing, the computer that is processing this text, even by the most generous stretch of the
imagination, cannot be God (pantheism). However, idealist philosopher Karl C.F. Krause's (1781-
1832)127 modified version of pantheism, panentheism (God is in all things but all things are not
God), put to further use in Whitehead's and Hartshorne's Process Theology, parallels the Bahá'í
teaching of the indwelling names and attributes of God. [Arabic] By this reckoning, even the
computer might reflect one of the divine names — the genius of the human being. Yet even
acknowledging a greater comfort with panentheism, I am still confronted by a mystery: what is the
name or names of the attributes of God which dwell in matter? Even more confounding, what is the
essence of matter itself that humans have remodelled over the ages in the endless variety of their
artifacts? Bahá'í theology thus leaves a large place for mystery and wonder which Einstein tells us
lies at the root of science.128 Further, God may be personal, but He is not in essence a Person. So
incarnation theology in the Bahá'í view is doubly erroneous, not only for its reduction of the
infinite, changeless, and eternal Godhead to the temporal structure of the human frame (Christ's,
Krishna's or other), but it is also anthropomorphic in that it makes God a person. Yet God cannot
belong to the genus "person", since He is by definition unique and incomparable, however person is
defined,129 and lies beyond the created orders of being or thought. Bahá'í theology speaks, however,
of "the complete incarnation of the names and attributes of God"130 in the person of the Divine
Manifestation. The essence of Divinity remains, however, in Otto's phrase das ganz Andere, the
wholly other.131

These two brief examples of pantheism/panentheism and incarnation of essence/incarnation
of names also point to the conciliatory mode of Bahá'í theology. While the literal interpretation of
both pantheism and incarnation theology are rejected by the Bahá'í Faith, it has nonetheless its own
understanding of such doctrines. While reinterpretations of another's religious doctrines is usually
viewed as being invalid hermeneutics, we have to remember that adaptations and variations of
another's doctrinal concepts or religious practices have passed from one religion to another for
centuries.

The Religionsgeschichtliche Schule132 has traced, for example, the Hellenistic influences of
the mystery religions and gnostic groups on such Christian doctrines as blood sacrifice and
atonement, resurrection and the sacraments.133 In the perspective of the history of religions school,
the Christian doctrines were themselves reformulations of the Greek mysteries and other Oriental
religions of salvation. So one may argue that from this perspective there is no religious doctrine
which is not a reinterpretation or reformulation of a prior belief. All beliefs derive from or are set
against a particular theological background, and are then defined, in the light of the prior beliefs, as
being correct or incorrect. The Bahá'í Faith has employed such reformulations,134 and has defined
any of its new doctrines by virtue of the authority of the divine revelation of its scriptures, but has
preserved any notions of truth that it has defined as part of its legacy from the religion(s) that have
preceded it.

The Universal House of Justice has, moreover, written something quite pertinent to this
discussion. While the Universal House of Justice points to certain positive effects, it has also
alluded to the resultant double negative that has followed in the wake of "the liberalization of
religious thought" since roughly 1850. The House of Justice writes:

One is antagonism to any statement which could be held to imply even an oblique criticism
> of another person's religion. The other, which is indirectly related to the first, is a
> progressive dilution of the content of religious belief to a lowest common denominator of
uncontentious statement.135

In a cogent twist of logic, The Universal House of Justice links the gingerly world of polite
interfaith dialogue to the paradoxically opposite extreme of the rise of religious fundamentalism:

> It is not surprising that in reaction to such an atmosphere. there has been a corresponding
> increase in the number of those, particularly among the youth who, thirsty for truth,
> discipline and challenge in religion, gravitate to the opposite extreme of
fundamentalism.136

The prophets of God, it is worth remembering, came onto the world scene as iconoclasts in
their proclamation of divine truth. During a talk at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Edward B. Kinney in
New York on 29 May 1912, `Abdu'l-Bahá said: "The divine Manifestations have been iconoclastic
in Their teachings, uprooting error, destroying false religious beliefs and summoning mankind anew
to the fundamental oneness of God."137 Scholars are neither prophets nor the rare recipients of
divine revelation, but their devotion to truth, and their defence of it, should reflect, in however
diminished fashion, the same consecration that fired the spirit of the Manifestations of God.

All of this to say that the question of the truth-claim has once again come full front and
centre in the advent of Bahá'u'lláh. For those who may regard themselves as devoted seekers of
truth, they can in no wise ignore the claims of the Persian Prophet whose repeated and emphatic
proclamation was that he was the most Mighty Instrument in our age for the establishment of
planetary unity through the aegis of a new world faith.

Shoghi Effendi sets the implications of Bahá'u'lláh's weighty claim against the fragility and
precariousness of the human condition today in the following dramatic and moving statement:

> Who, contemplating the helplessness, the fears and miseries of humanity in this day, can
> any longer question the necessity for a fresh revelation of the quickening power of God's
> redemptive love and guidance? Who, witnessing on one hand the stupendous advance
> achieved in the realm of human knowledge, of power, of skill and inventiveness, and
> viewing on the other the unprecedented character of the sufferings that afflict, and the
> dangers that beset, present-day society, can be so blind as to doubt that the hour has at last
> struck for the advent of a new Revelation, for a re-statement of the Divine Purpose, and for
> the consequent revival of those spiritual forces that have, at fixed intervals, rehabilitated
> the fortunes of human society?138

Conclusion

Bahá'í theology in its current state of development is characterised by the functional
tendencies of exegesis, apologetics and philosophical theology. Although the postmodern and
deconstructionist temper of the times is decidedly anti-authoritarian, Bahá'í theology, particularly in
the writings of Shoghi Effendi, reveals alternately both dogmatic and liberal tendencies. The
systematic Bahá'í theologian has not yet emerged. However, any Bahá'í systematic theology must
welcome a pluralism of thought, and avoid a detached over-objectivisation of the truth by
addressing the existential concerns of the self in a process of spiritual transformation while living-
in-the-world. While recognizing its debt to `Ilm-i-Kalám, Bahá'í theology should increasingly seek

to become universal. The recovery of the unsuspected but ubiquitous influence of the prophets
> merits on-going attention as one of the fundamental preoccupations of Bahá'í theology. The weighty
> claims advanced by the founders of the Bahá'í Faith have brought again to the fore in compelling
> fashion the issue of the truth claim.

8\. Several theologians and postcritical interpreters of scripture such as Hans Frei, Moshe Greenberg and Michael

> expose." (The World Order of Bahá'u'lláh pp, 112-13) Shoghi Effendi also writes that the view that would
> profess a cessation of divine revelation, and a temporal end to the succession of Messengers of God "would
> indeed be nothing less than sheer blasphemy". (WOE p. 58) Shoghi Effendi further wrote that to in any way

83\. Weil makes this claim because she says that one cannot "come to grips" with such concepts as the Will and

> Intelligence. As for "emotional states", she says that "one can only lay hold of those emotional states that
> have passed." She says further that there is a fragment of self that continues to exist from moment to moment
> but the term self itself disappears with time (Lectures on Philosophy, p. 191).

85\. "...self has really two meanings, or is used in two senses, in the Bahá'í writings; one is self, the identity of the

> individual created by God. This is the self mentioned in such passages as `he hath known God who hath
> known himself etc.' The other self is the ego, the dark, animalistic heritage each one of us has, the lower
> nature that can develop into a monster of selfishness, brutality, lust and so on. it is this self we must struggle
> against, or this side of our natures, in order to strengthen and free the spirit within us and help it to attain

perfection." From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual, December 10, 1947 in Lights
of Guidance, comp. Helen Hornby, 1144:421. (Bahá'í Publishing Trust, New Delhi, 1983)

92\. `Abdu'l-Bahá said: "Wherefore it is incumbent upon all Bahá'ís to ponder this very delicate and vital matter in

> their hearts, that, unlike other religions, they may not content themselves with the noise, the clamor, the
> hollowness of religious doctrine. Nay, rather, they should exemplify in every aspect of their lives those
> attributes and virtues that are born of God and should arise to distinguish themselves by their goodly
> behavior." The Divine Art of Living, p. 25 (first edition)

94\. `Abdu'l-Bahá has stated that "the ordinances which concern the realm of morals and ethics" constitute "the

> fundamental aspect of the religion of God". The complete quotation is: "These [essential spiritual teachings]
> are faith in God, the acquirement of virtues which characterize perfect manhood, praiseworthy morals, the
> acquisition of the bestowals and bounties emanating from the divine effulgences — in brief, the ordinances
> which concern the realm of morals and ethics. This is the fundamental aspect of the religion of God, and this
> is of the highest importance because knowledge of God is the fundamental requirement of man"

(Promulgation p. 403).
95\. What I intend by "the classical sense of the word" regarding prophethood is the divine election of a pure,

> singular soul who is called by God to deliver a specific teaching, and accomplish a definite mission within a
> "dispensation", a time frame during which the prophet's authority is exercised until the advent of the
> subsequent Divine Manifestation. Dispensation prophethood is thus characterised by the legacy of a Holy
> Book, and the bequeathing of a rich cultural heritage to the world, that takes form as a high culture or
> civilisation (Jewish, Islamic, Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, etc.). is [complete]. The Bahá'í Faith maintains,
> consequently, a more restrictive definition of the word "prophet" than the one sometimes used more loosely
> to refer to a charismatic individual, or one who propounds an original or unique teaching. Such individuals as
> Newman, Bonhoeffer, Kierkegaard, Ghandi, Swedenborg, Blake, Martin Luther King or religious reformers
> such as Joseph Smith would not be considered prophets by Bahá'ís.
96\. An important consideration which I leave out of this discussion is the role of the prophets as progenitors of

civilization and culture.

99\. I have wrenched this little phrase from its context and put it to a different use above, but one that seems to be

possesses a partial not a total view of the cosmos since the human being as spiritual being is conspicuously

absent: "To hope for a world view from science is like hoping that increasingly detailed maps of Illinois will
eventually produce the ultimate map of the United States." (p. 109).

127\. Krause was a lesser known but enlightened German philosopher and a contemporary of Hegel who wrote

> higher Ultimate Reality, God, who transcended the opposition of body and spirit, and nature itself. Krause
> reflected that totality thinking that was typical of the absolute idealists and which is so strikingly similar to
> pantheism, but he departed from them in several respects. Something of a pragmatist, Krause believed that
> humanity could only realise its function in perfecting society. Das Urbild der Menscheit included reflections
