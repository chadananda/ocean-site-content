## Bahá'í Writings, Philosophy and Environment

> **Abstract:** Drawing on decades of high school teaching experience using philosophical inquiry as a teaching tool, this paper explores how philosophy, which Shoghi Effendi describes as a “sound branch of learning,” contributes to a better inner environment thereby improving the external environment. Among other things, philosophy encourages thoughtfulness, reflection, self‐evaluation, self‐critique, objectivity, understanding and empathy for new viewpoints, clear questioning and analysis: it helps us reach our maximum potential as “rational souls” (SAQ, 151). It also improves our social environment by fostering mental habits that encourage more thoughtful dialogue and action. \[Abstract taken from [conference program](https://bahai-library.com/pdf/a/abs_2008_conference_program.pdf).\]

Preface: A Restatement of the Obvious

Because the obvious is easy to overlook, it bears repeating that if we want to
change the world we must change the people in it, and to change the people in the world
we must change our inner environment. After all, the way we think and feel ultimately
determines how we act in the world, in the social and in the natural environment. We
cannot improve our relationship to the natural world if we do not improve our inner,
psycho-spiritual environment. Bad thinking cannot lead to good action. Therefore,
whatever enhances our inner psycho-spiritual environment, whatever develops our
thinking and reflective skills and expands our empathetic capacities is an invaluable
resource that we cannot afford to squander.

The purpose of this paper is to suggest that philosophy is one of the most under-
utilized resources in the quest for an improved psycho-spiritual environment and an
improved relationship to the natural world. Unfortunately, I think this is also the case
within the Baha’i community where philosophy is often associated with pursuits “that
begin[] and end[] in words.”1 However, as Shoghi Effendi’s and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
statements make clear, if properly pursued, philosophy is “a sound branch of learning”2
which inculcates habits of careful reflection that facilitate teaching, explicating and
defending the Faith

My observations on philosophy’s ability to improve our inner intellectual
environment are based on three decades of teaching high school English and Comparative
Civilizations by the method of philosophic inquiry. Socratic dialogue was part of the
method, but so was a program I developed called “The Great Questions,” a survey of the
most basic philosophical questions individuals and cultures all to answer in one way or
another and to one extent or another. The students’ responses not only led me to the
conclusion that all but a few young people are ‘natural born philosophers’ eager to
discuss the questions that face all thoughtful human beings, but also demonstrated that
philosophy has the power to draw out the latent gems of profundity hidden in these
‘mines.’3 In the appropriate ‘consultative’ atmosphere, where the quest for truth, not the
quest for being right was paramount, the vast majority were enthusiastic participants.

The Great Questions program was inspired by the Bahá’í teaching that the human
soul is inherently rational:

> The human spirit which distinguishes man from the animal is the rational soul,
> and these two names—the human spirit and the rational soul--designate one thing.
> This spirit, which in the terminology of the philosophers is the rational soul,
> embraces all beings, and as far as human ability permits discovers the realities of
> things and becomes cognizant of their peculiarities and effects, and of the
> qualities and properties of beings.4

Because the human soul is a “rational soul” it seeks rational answers. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
says, “in this age the peoples of the world need the arguments of reason,”5 i.e. they want
rational answers. According to him, even faith cannot flourish without reason: “If a
question be found contrary to reason, faith and belief in it are impossible and there is no
outcome but wavering and vacillation.”6 In this regard, one of philosophy’s strengths is
its special cultivation of correct reasoning and the laws of reason; by teaching us to think
analytically and to practice critique and above all, self-critique of ideas philosophy helps
us discover the truth about reality—and this, according to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is its primary
task: “Philosophy consists in comprehending the reality of things as they exist, according
to the capacity and the power of man,”7

It must be emphasised at this point that the quest for rational answers does not
exclude the heart since they are in mutual, dialectical inter-action with each influencing
the other. That is why the two are so frequently mentioned together in the Writings. For
example, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá links them when he says, in regards to spiritual meetings,

> Each of the meetings ye have organized, wherein ye feel heavenly emotions and
> comprehend realities and significances, is like unto the firmament, and those
> souls are as resplendent stars shining with the light of guidance.8

Reason and heart/feeling are distinct but inter-active since both feeling and thought are
responses to our inner and outer environment. Just as faith must be harmonized with
reason,9 our hearts and minds must also be harmonized. Thus, the ‘Great Questions’
program touches more than just the intellect of students because the questions raised are
answered from various viewpoints which has the effect of expanding students’ empathy
and understanding.

Part 1: The Bahá’í Writings and Philosophy

If we must make changes in our “inward life,” we inevitably raise the question
‘How can we do so?’ The most obvious answer is education—but that only raises the
question, ‘What kind of education?’ In the words, of Shoghi Effendi, how can we bring
about “a change of heart, a reframing of all our conceptions and a new orientation of our
activities”10? Because it focuses on the process of careful reflection, philosophy can
contribute a great deal to improving our inner environment and, by extension, our action
in the world. Thoughtful people will act thoughtfully and that is precisely what we need
in regards to the natural environment.

Mentioning philosophy inevitably requires a clarification of what the Bahá’í
Writings say about it. Unfortunately, the role of philosophy has been subject to

considerable misunderstanding among some Bahá’ís according to whom philosophy
belongs to “[s]uch academic pursuits as begin and end in words alone [and] have never
been and will never be of any worth.”11 In their view, the pursuit of philosophy
contradicts Bahá’u’lláh’s injunction that to “acquire knowledge is incumbent on all, but
knowledge of those sciences which may profit the people of the earth, and not of such
sciences begin in mere words and end in mere words.”12 This misunderstanding is not
supported by the Writings.

In The Promulgation of Universal Peace, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá praises the early
Christians as people who were able to transform their philosophy into positive self-
transformation and proper action in the world.13 They practiced Bahá’u’lláh’s injunction
to “Let deeds not words be your adorning.”14 However, interpreting these words requires
us to recall that according to the Writings, proper action must be based on knowledge and
understanding. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> Although a person of good deeds is acceptable at the Threshold of the Almighty,
> yet it is first "to know," and then "to do" . . . . Consider how most animals labor
> for man, draw loads and facilitate travel; yet, as they are ignorant, they receive
> no reward for this toil and labor.15

In other words, appropriate knowledge and understanding are necessary pre-conditions
for proper action. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá re-emphasises this when he says,

> In the erection of a house it is first necessary to know the ground and design the
> house suitable for it; second, to obtain the means or funds necessary for the
> construction; third, to actually build it.16

In the following pages we shall explore what philosophy can do to prepare us for
effective action by improving our inner environment through reflection and the other
mental skills for which philosophy provides training.

Another statement by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also dispels the view that the Bahá’í Writings
have a negative outlook on philosophy. He says,

> All mankind must be given a knowledge of science and philosophy—that is, as
> much as may be deemed necessary. All cannot be scientists and philosophers,
> but each should be educated according to his needs and deserts.17

It is important to note the imperative “must” in this statement; ‘Abdu’l-Bahá insists that
such knowledge—albeit in varying degrees—be given to “all mankind.” To one extent or
another, philosophical thinking is important for all. Specifically, he says that
“Philosophy develops the mind,”18 a topic we shall pursue below.

Significantly, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá provides a definition of philosophy which clearly
outlines its mandate: “Philosophy consists in comprehending the reality of things as they
exist, according to the capacity and the power of man,”19 In other words, philosophy, no
less than science, is a way of learning about and understanding the real world. Insofar as
such understanding is necessary, philosophy is necessary as well as one of our intellectual
tools. Of course, he thinks philosophy is best pursued within the framework given by the
Manifestations, i.e. a ‘divine philosophy.’ It is no accident that he wrote a book called
Divine Philosophy in which part of this framework is outlined.

Nor did Shoghi Effendi think philosophy was in itself something that necessarily
began and ended in words. He writes,

> Philosophy, as you will study it and later teach it, is certainly not one of the
> sciences that begins and ends in words. Fruitless excursions into metaphysical
> hair-splitting is meant, not a sound branch of learning like philosophy.20

The Guardian recognises that philosophy per se is “a sound branch of learning” even
while he recognises and rejects certain abuses and/or extreme developments of this
subject which diminish its value. Furthermore, the Universal House of Justice gives great
encouragement to philosophical studies when it writes,

> It is hoped that all the Bahá’í students will follow the noble example you have set
> before them and will, henceforth, be led to investigate and analyse the principles
> of the Faith and to correlate them with the modern aspects of philosophy and
> science.21

This statement implicitly recognises the influential reach of philosophy is as well as the
importance for Bahá’ís to study and correlate the Teachings with contemporary
developments in this field. Identifying such correlations is obviously a way of building
bridges to other schools of thought and facilitating dialogues which inevitably introduce
Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation to a wider circle of readers and thinkers – something which can
only be good. Philosophy facilitates this process by allowing us to “find a point of entry
into contemporary mind in order that [it] might be able to present the [Bahá’í] message in
terms intelligible to their own age.”22

Moreover, the extensive presence of philosophy in the Bahá’í Writings illustrates

the importance of philosophy. Some Answered Questions, notably in the second half,
deals with numerous philosophical issues often in technical philosophical language that
must be learned and understood before the texts can be fully comprehended. The same
may be said of The Promulgation of Universal Peace, and, to varying degrees about
Paris Talks, Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and The Secret of Divine
Civilization. A good example of such a passage is the following:

> Some think that the body is the substance and exists by itself, and that the spirit is
> accidental and depends upon the substance of the body, although, on the contrary,
> the rational soul is the substance, and the body depends upon it. If the accident—
> that is to say, the body—be destroyed, the substance, the spirit, remains.23

This statement which is the basis of his argument for the immortality of the soul and the
relationship between mind and body is steeped in the terminology and argumentation of
Aristotle and is not fully comprehendible without some exposure to it. The appropriate
knowledge of philosophy will, therefore, expand our understanding of the Writings and
thus put us in a stronger position to explain and defend them convincingly to others. This
in itself improves not only in our own inner environment but also that of our audience.

Understanding the philosophical principles explicitly and implicitly embedded in
the Bahá’í Writings also facilitates inter-faith dialogue especially with those religions
such as Catholicism, Judaism, Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism which have highly
developed philosophical traditions notably in ontology, metaphysics, epistemology and
ethics. Without understanding the relevant philosophical principles in the Bahá’í Writings,
we cannot effectively explicate let alone defend the Writings effectively—and that is
bound to have a negative impact on our global intellectual and social environment. After
all, as Bahá’ís we believe that the Writings contain the “healing medicine” needed by the
world and this obligates us to be effective purveyors of this medicine. If we can clearly
explicate what the Writings say such human problems as our relationship to the
environment we have a better chance of influencing others and joining them in practical
work to make changes in human thought, feeling and behavior.

Before identifying specific ways in which philosophy can be used to improve our
inner environment and, thereby, contribute to a better relationship with the natural
environment, we shall examine some of the foundations of environmentalism in the
Writings.

Part II: The Foundations of Environmentalism in the Bahá’í Writings

Long before environmental issues came to the forefront of public consciousness,
Shoghi Effendi issued a statement that not only lays out the philosophical foundations of
environmentalism, but also establishes a guideline for pursuing it effectively and
intelligently. He writes,

\[23\] `Abdu'
l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, p. 239.

> We cannot segregate the human heart from the environment outside us and say
> that once one of these is reformed everything will be improved. Man is organic
> with the world. His inner life moulds the environment and is itself also deeply
> affected by it. The one acts upon the other and every abiding change in the life of
> man is the result of these mutual reactions.24

This declaration, is, of course, a specific application of the ontological principle laid
down by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá when he says,

For all beings are connected together like a chain, and reciprocal help, assistance,
and influence belonging to the properties of things, are the causes of the existence,

development, and growth of created beings.25

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s assertion portrays the universe as dialectical in nature, with each part
influencing and being influenced by all the others. The importance of this is clear: Bahá’í
environmental philosophy is built on the ontological foundation that humankind and the
natural environment are aspects of a single cosmic process and cannot be regarded in
isolation. Changes in one will inevitably be accompanied by changes in the other in an
endless cycle of mutual interaction.

It is noteworthy that Shoghi Effendi draws special attention to our “inner life” in
this process: “[Mankind’s] inner life moulds the environment and is itself also deeply
affected by it.”26 This statement eloquently summarises the dialectical complexity of the
process but, perhaps more important for our time, draws attention to the vital role that the
“inner life” plays in dealing with environmental challenges. There is a tendency in our
age to focus almost exclusively on external, technological fixes for all problems with
both the human and natural environments and to ignore the necessity of transforming our
“inner lives.” We think we can change the environment without changing ourselves and
the way we think and feel.

Our thoughts and beliefs, assumptions, concepts, attitudes, feelings and values
generate and shape our action in the external world, i.e. in both the social and natural
environment. In other words, to look after the natural environment, we must take care of
the psycho-spiritual environment within ourselves and, by extension, in the social order.
We cannot expect to foster a better relationship to the natural environment if we do not
recognise the necessity of developing a better psycho-spiritual environment both
individually and socially.

Commitment to this whole dialectical process is, according to Shoghi Effendi,
is one of the hallmarks and unique strengths of Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings.

\[24\] Compilations, The Compilation of Compilations vol. I, p. 84; emphasis added.

\[25\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Bahá'í World Faith, p. 302.

\[26\] Compilations, The Compilation of Compilations vol. I, p. 84; emphasis added.

> No movement in the world directs its attention upon both these aspects of human
> life and has full measures for their improvement, save the teachings of
Bahá’u’lláh.

And this is its distinctive feature.27

Furthermore, he adds,

> We need a change of heart, a reframing of all our conceptions and a new
> orientation of our activities. The inward life of man as well as his outward
> environment have to be reshaped if human salvation is to be secured.28

Our “inward life” must be transformed by a “change of heart,” by “a reframing of all our
conceptions” and by a reorientation of our worldly activities i.e. feeling, thought and
action. Only in this way can we develop a new world-view that will let us build a healthy
relationship with the natural environment and, thereby, secure our own future.

If establishing a healthy relationship to the natural environment depends on
developing a new and better “inward life,”29 how can this be done? How can we improve
our psycho-spiritual inner environment or “inward life”? How can we develop minds and
hearts that have the sensitivities, intellectual skills and habits and above all, the
willingness to deal adequately and realistically with the challenges of our dialectical
relationship with nature?

We cannot, for example, grasp superficially attractive but simplistic answers as
some have done and merely slough off past progress to return to living in more primitive
physical conditions. Few people will seriously adopt a return to ancestral ways and give
up positive fruits of progress in medicine, personal and communication, transportation
and travel or the advantages of a globalised economy. It is simply not in our nature to do
so, as Shoghi Effendi asserts when he writes, humans

> shape nature to meet our own needs, as no animal does. Animals adapt
> themselves to better fit in with and benefit from their environment. But men both
> surmount and change environment.30

In other words, we cannot expect humans to violate their own essential natures if we are
to make sustainable changes in our relationship to the natural environment. Such pseudo-
answers are not appropriate to our nature. Obviously, therefore, it is not a question of
whether or not we shall change the environment but a question whether or not we shall
change ourselves and the environment in ways that are appropriate to all aspects of the
cosmic dialectic.

Nor can we rely exclusively on scientific “techno-fixes” since these inevitably
have unforeseeable consequences in the cosmic dialectic. Science and technology are
certainly part of the answer but they cannot, in themselves, re-focus or “re-orient”31
our activities. They cannot transform our scale of values from one which puts material
acquisition at the apex to one which puts spiritual, intellectual and creative development
in this position. Nor can they bring recognition that material progress itself is not a
guarantee of what existentialist philosophers call ‘authentic existence.’

Part III: How Philosophy Improves Our “Inward Life”

Thinking about the philosophy’s role in developing a better relationship with the
natural environment begins with the recognition that the most important renewable
resources on the planet are human minds and hearts which make up our inner
environment. Without improving our inner environment, no effort to improve our man-
made or natural external environment will be sustainable or successful. After all, to
paraphrase ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, knowing must precede doing. Therefore, let us explain the
ways in which a study of philosophy—especially if guided by the Writings—improves
the inner environment, our “inward life.”

Philosophy encourages the habit of thoughtfulness, of careful, orderly and
detached reflection so that our thinking about things will be just, i.e. appropriate to the
subject matter and to reality. We must be impartial, and follow truth where it leads:

> The first teaching of Bahá’u’lláh is the duty incumbent upon all to investigate
> reality. What does it mean to investigate reality? It means that man must forget all
> hearsay and examine truth himself, for he does not know whether statements he
> hears are in accordance with reality or not. Wherever he finds truth or reality, he
must hold to it, forsaking, discarding all else; for outside of reality there is

naught but superstition and imagination.32

According to this statement, the investigation of “truth or reality” is obligatory for all and
to fulfill this responsibility we must not rely upon hearsay but see for ourselves. We must,
moreover, hold to whatever truth we find, rather than allow it to be swept aside by other,
extraneous considerations, which, so the statement implies, is a danger that besets all
seekers of truth. This advice is given to improve our inner environment, our “inward life”

Without following ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s advice, our thinking cannot be just i.e. could
not give each side of a subject its appropriate due which would violate Baha’u’llah’s
often expressed injunction to “Be fair in thy judgment.”33 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also says that in
order to achieve justice in our thinking,

> We must set aside bias and prejudice. We must abandon the imitations of
> ancestors and forefathers. We ourselves must investigate reality and be fair

\[31\] Compilations, The Compilation of Compilations vol. I, p. 84.

\[32\] `Abdu'l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 62; emphasis added.

\[33\] Gleanings from the Writings of Baha’u’llah, p. 285.

in judgment.34

From these statements (and many others like them) we can see that the Writings are
deeply concerned about the quality of our inner environment. Our actions in the world
are not likely to improve if our thinking remains biased, hasty and unquestioning.

To be “fair in our judgment” also means that we be impartial, i.e. detached from
the outcomes so that we do not let our preferences mislead us. For example, in seeking
knowledge of God, the seeker must “so cleanse his heart that no remnant of either love or
hate may linger therein, lest that love blindly incline him to error, or that hate repel him
away from the truth.”35 The same impartiality or detachment in the search for truth
should guide us in all our investigations and is, therefore, an essential aspect of our inner
environment.

One of philosophy’s most powerful tools in improving the “inward life” is careful
and systematic questioning. Indeed, questions are so important in the Bahá’í Faith that
they have a feast in their honour—the Feast of Questions—for it is only by means of
questions that we shall be able to investigate the truth for ourselves. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asks
rhetorically,

> Shall man gifted with the power of reason unthinkingly follow and adhere to
> dogma, creeds and hereditary beliefs which will not bear the analysis of reason in
> this century of effulgent reality?36

Obviously not. Doing so violates God’s gift of reason, “the rational faculty with which
God hath endowed the essence of man”37 and enslaves us to the past, i.e. robs us of
intellectual freedom and capacity to act intelligently in our own circumstances. Skilful
questioning, however, not only satisfies our need for rationality and freedom but also
help us meet our obligation to find the truth. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says, “it is incumbent upon
all mankind to investigate truth.”38 Furthermore, without truth, unity cannot be achieved
and this would frustrate one of the main raisons d’etre of the Bahá’í Faith. According to
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “If such investigation be made, all should agree and be united, for truth or
reality is not multiple; it is not divisible.”39

Careful questioning encourages other virtues explicitly listed and/or implied by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Most obviously, they help attain intellectual freedom from ancestral
beliefs, and thereby free us from thoughtless imitations that cannot “bear the analysis of
reason.”40 Only in this way will we be able to investigate the truth for ourselves and come
to our own conclusions. Even if these conclusions agree with an established belief, we
will agree with them because we understand them ourselves and not merely because we
have adopted them passively. We have, thereby, made these conclusions our own.

By subjecting our own views to questioning we practice humility and self-critique
by regarding ourselves as simply another seeker for truth. In practising self-critique we
help ensure that our judgments are just and do not unduly privilege ourselves. Without
self-critique we cannot hope to know reality. With it, our views will become more fair
and just than before. Self-critique also helps develop the virtues of impartiality and
objectivity. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes, “In this day man must investigate reality impartially
and without prejudice in order to reach the true knowledge and conclusions.”41

Another benefit of questioning skills is an increased ability to view issues from
various points of view, which is exactly what the world needs to facilitate empathy and
mutual understanding. Studying philosophy is especially useful in developing our powers
of empathy and compassion because philosophy confronts us with carefully developed
world-views expounded from widely different points-of-view. The powers of empathy
developed in this way help to discover the truth about reality and may even help point the
way to common ground among contending views. In a world evolving towards unity this
is a vital skill.

One of the most important functions of questioning is to forestall any tendency to
literal reading. Literalism is, ironically, the common intellectual vice of both religious
fundamentalism and the new atheism.42 This vice is especially destructive vis-à-vis
religious texts: “The purpose of the prophetic words was not the outward or literal
meaning, but the inner symbolical significance.”43 Speaking of the story of Adam and
Eve, he says,

> if the literal meaning of this story were attributed to a wise man, certainly all
> would logically deny that this arrangement, this invention, could have emanated
> from an intelligent being.44

Thus, implicitly ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is teaching us that we must adopt metaphorical or
symbolic readings when literal understanding leads to logical contradictions, a lack of
internal consistency, or to physically impossible events such as Mt. Zion dancing.45
However, this can become clear to us only if we carefully question the text in regards to
its purpose, its logical coherence, its implicit assumptions, its evidence as well as our
own way of reading the text.

In order to facilitate and sharpen understanding of questions, it is worthwhile
identifying some of the more common question types. The best way to begin is to identify
the two broadest categories of questions, closed and open. A closed question can be
answered simply, for example by a ‘yes’ or ‘no,’ with a word or short phrase, or a fact.

\[45\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 246.

Virtually no debate is possible, e.g. ‘In what year did the Báb declare His mission?’
Closed questions are good for developing basic textual understanding i.e. they focus on
basic reading skills. Open questions ask for opinions and viewpoints which must be
explained and supported; they require reflection and, therefore, focus on thinking skills.

There are, however, also some particular kinds of questions worthy of attention.

Among them are,

1: Purpose questions: what is the purpose, task or goal of a statement, plan,

action?

2: Cause questions: what are the past causes that lead to a result?

3: Analysis questions: what are the parts or aspects? What role to these parts or

aspects play? How are they put together (structure)?

4: Application questions: how can an idea, action, etc. be used in other contexts

or applied in daily life?

5: Relevance question: Who or what is affected by the statement? How much? In

Systematic use of these questions in habitual reflection on what we encounter, fosters the
kind of inner milieu that the Writings encourage i.e. analysis that is rational, impartial,
independent, just, thorough, empathetic and committed to finding the truth. Of course,
regular and consistent application of these questions is the key to achieving the inner
environment characterised by these traits. Philosophical education is especially well-
suited to this task because the questions it cultivates are adaptable to all areas of human
thought and action.

Let us apply a sample of these questions to a particular passage from the Writings
to show how our understanding may be deepened

> XCIII. Know thou that every created thing is a sign of the revelation of God. Each,
> according to its capacity, is, and will ever remain, a token of the Almighty.
> Inasmuch as He, the sovereign Lord of all, hath willed to reveal His sovereignty
> in the kingdom of names and attributes, each and every created thing hath,
> through the act of the Divine Will, been made a sign of His glory. So pervasive
> and general is this revelation that nothing whatsoever in the whole universe can
> be discovered that doth not reflect His splendor. Under such conditions every
> consideration of proximity and remoteness is obliterated....47

If, for example, we ask ‘What is the purpose of this passage?’ we may find ourselves
discussing such issues as the sacralisation of nature as a divine creation – and our
potential responses to that; the direct proof of God’s existence by the evidence of nature,
or, evidence for the contingency of all natural things. We shall also encounter the
sacralisation of nature if we question the consequences of this statement: how does this
statement change our views on the value of nature?; how does it affect cost/benefit
analysis of our treatment of nature? However, we are also led to an important ethical
questions. For example, do even those who wilfully commit evil reflect God’s splendor?
How are we to treat them in view of this?

If we ask a clarification question about the phrase “proximity and remoteness”

\[46\] Counter-examples show exceptions to a rule or universal generalisation.

\[47\] Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh, p. 184.

we might explore the irrelevance of spatial categories in discussing spiritual realities. We
might also ask clarification about the whole issue of being a “sign of the revelation.”
What precisely does this mean? Does this refer to the actual natural object or body, to its
essence or soul, to its qualities or attributes, or does it refer to all of these things or
something else entirely? It is obvious that each question forces us to dig deeper into the
Writings and thereby encourages the quest for truth and all its attendant virtues.

If we ask about the hidden assumptions, several possibilities emerge. For example,
the passage seems to assume idealism, i.e. the view that all natural, material things are the
products of something immaterial, in this case God and His Divine Will. Does it then also
assume that matter itself is created by the “act of the Divine Will”? Is matter the residue
of the divine Will? Since God chooses “to reveal His sovereignty,” does that assume God
is a personal and intentional Being, or is this statement only a metaphor? By answering
these questions we can pursue investigations into the ontological teachings i.e. theory of
reality of the Faith.

From this brief sample, it becomes apparent that the study of philosophy can
inculcate the habit of careful, precise and orderly questioning that leads not only to a
better understanding of the Writings but is also conducive to a more considered and
reflective relationship to nature. We will not be content with one-dimensional thinking
that only concerns itself with one aspect—such as profitability or physicality—in
deciding whether or not a project is really worth doing. There are, for example, questions
of values to consider. Because it specialises in and has a great deal of experience with
questioning, philosophy has a unique contribution to make in teaching us better
intellectual habits or, in Shoghi Effendi’s words, thereby achieve “a reframing of all our
conceptions and a new orientation of our activities.”48

In order to promote a better inner environment that will lead to improved
understanding and action vis-à-vis the natural environment, the Bahá’í Writings also
promote a different way of thinking, i.e. dialectical thinking. Again, philosophy helps
develop this kind of thinking not only by inculcating the habits of careful, systematic
reflection and intellectual exploration, but also by providing a methodical understanding
of how dialectics can be put into practice.

In the Writings, dialectics takes two forms. First, in its classical or applied form,
dialectical thinking involves reasoning by an exchange of view-points, questions and
counter-arguments as illustrated in the Plato’s dialogues. Each side submits propositions
and counter-propositions that are questioned in the quest for truth which unites both sides.
A proper Socratic dialogue is not an ‘argument’ in which participants try to score points
against each other so that their own viewpoints may win whether they are true or not. All
parties in a Socratic dialogue aim at truth and all participants are considered equal. One
viewpoint or another may be refuted but that is important only insofar as it is part of
establishing the truth. Sometimes a new, more inclusive viewpoint or synthesis will
emerge that includes previously opposing views and thus unanimity on a subject is

\[48\] Compilations, The Compilation of Compilations vol. I, p. 84.

attained. Because Socratic dialectics are focused on attaining truth, not victory in
argument, they encourage impartiality or fair judgment.

The Bahá’í Writings promote dialectical thinking in the Socratic sense and
develop it even further in the process of consultation which goes beyond Socratic
dialectic because of the spiritual framework within which consultation works. Each
participant is valued not only as a fellow seeker for truth or a solution but is also regarded
as a revelation of God “according to [their] capacity.”49 The discussion is framed by an
atmosphere of care and mutual respect which in itself helps to diffuse the point-scoring
that bedevils too many discussions. This encourages a “free, frank loving”50 but
“unfettered”51 dialogue. According to Bahá’u’lláh,

> The heaven of divine wisdom is illumined with the two luminaries of consultation
> and compassion. Take ye counsel together in all matters, inasmuch as
> consultation is the lamp of guidance which leadeth the way, and is the bestower
> of understanding.52

It is noteworthy that consultation, which includes the art of careful questioning and
discussion found in the Socratic dialogue “leadeth the way” and thereby bestows
“understanding”—from which “compassion” and empathy develop. As we understand the
views of others better, our capacity for compassion expands.

How then, do dialectical thinking and especially consultation improve our inner
environment and, by extension, lead to better action vis-à-vis the environment? As
already stated, they encourage the virtues of impartiality and fair judgment, objectivity,
self-criticism and humility, intellectual empathy and the quest for truth as the only
legitimate goal. This develops the kind of inner environment or “inward life” that can act
more sensitively in regards to all aspects of the external environment.

Obviously, dialectical thinking in the form of consultation affects our relationship
with the human and natural environment insofar as it trains us to think of these
relationships as dialectical or dialogical. The human and/or natural environment becomes
one of the partners in the consultation-dialectical process; as such, they require respect,
empathy and compassion for their ‘interests’ which must be taken into consideration.

However, the Bahá’í Writings also seem to endorse a second level of dialectical
thinking which originated with Hegel and, in its materialist form, with Marx and Engels.
Of course, the Writings categorically reject the materialism of the latter. However, the
Writings, as we shall see share a commitment to a view of reality as a process involving
two sides or aspects in interaction. Both must be considered.

\[49\] Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh, p. 184.

\[51\] Lights of Guidance, p. 176.

\[52\] Bahá’u’lláh, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 168; emphasis added.

(As a note of caution it needs to be said that we should not expect the Bahá’í
version of dialectical thinking to be a perfect replica of what we find in Hegel and/or
Marx and Engels. It would take further study to determine how far the similarities could
be pressed. For example, is the transformation of the Baha’i community caused by
“entrance by troops” the sublation of quantity into quality? Can we regard the changes in
our inner life derived from material sacrifices as an example of the sublation of quantity
i.e. money as mere money, into quality i.e. money as an expression of spirituality?)

In any case, we may observe evidence of dialectical thinking in the following
passage by Shoghi Effendi:

> We cannot segregate the human heart from the environment outside us and say
> that once one of these is reformed everything will be improved. Man is organic
> with the world. His inner life moulds the environment and is itself also deeply
> affected by it. The one acts upon the other and every abiding change in the life of
> man is the result of these mutual reactions.53

In short, as noted before, both aspects of the process must be considered. Humankind and
the environment, though seemingly opposed, are one, an organically linked unity with
two inter-acting aspects. In some respects, these aspects are in opposition; each shapes
the other. Humankind acts, and nature reacts and this reaction in turn shapes and affects
humankind which then responds to nature which reacts and so on. Sometimes the results
are destructive but at other times, the previous oppositions achieve a newer, higher
synthesis in which the interest of both sides are met at a higher level or synthesis. (Solar
power may be an example of a higher synthesis: the interests of humankind for electricity
are met as well as nature’s, i.e. other life forms’ ‘interest’ in being minimally impacted.)

What we observe here, and elsewhere in the Writings, are the basic elements of
dialectical thought, the first being that everything is in process or involved in change.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá says, “The material world is subject to change and transformation”54 and
adds,

> Know that nothing which exists remains in a state of repose, that is to say, all
> things are in motion. Everything is either growing or declining, all things are
> either coming from non-existence into being, or going from existence into non-
> existence . . . This state of motion is said to be essential--that is, natural; it cannot
> be separated from beings because it is their essential requirement, as it is the
> essential requirement of fire to burn.55

Dialectics sees reality as a process, but more than that, it sees each individual thing as
being a process in itself an inter-action between two aspects which to one degree or
another are in opposition. For example, Bahá’u’lláh says,

\[53\] Compilations, The Compilation of Compilations vol. I, p. 84; emphasis added.

\[54\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 161; see also 259,

\[55\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, p. 233; emphasis added; Paris Talks, 88.

> The world of existence came into being through the heat generated from the
> interaction between the active force and that which is its recipient. These two
> are the same, yet they are different.56

This statement perfectly illustrates Hegel’s principle of the ‘interpenetration of opposites’
or the ‘unity of opposites’: the active and recipient are “the same, yet they are different.”
They are essentially one but they take opposite roles and from their inter-action the
“world of existence came into being.” The “heat” of course represents the energy arising
from this inter-action and this energy is the stuff from which the material world is made.

However, there are numerous other dialectical pairs in the Writings. For example,
a human being is an interaction and often a conflict between our animal and spiritual
aspects. Without the spiritual aspect of this dialectical process, man “is merely an
animal.”57 To become human, the spiritual aspect must become active. Thus, our generic
human and individual identity is a result of a dialectic process between animal and
spiritual. Both must be considered and appropriately included. Furthermore, as in
Hegelian dialectics, there is a conflict among these ‘opposites’ to see which shall
dominate—the spiritual or the animal. In those who evil, their animal proclivities
dominate and control their spiritual side.

Like all other animate and non-animate things, humans are also a dialectic
between actuality—what we are at the moment—and potential—what we could be in the
future. Here, too, we see a struggle of opposites: the potentials, drawn by the attractive
power of God, exerts its pressure to be actualized and what is already actualized trying to
preserve or conserve itself as it is. Another dialectical pair seen in the Writings is that of
matter and form. Matter is the “raw material” to which form is given in order to make it a
specific, individual thing. For example, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> The sun is born from substance and form, which can be compared to father and
> mother, and it is absolute perfection; but the darkness has neither substance nor
> form, neither father nor mother, and it is absolute imperfection58

By itself, matter/substance has no form, is formless and anarchic, non-specific and non-
individual and limitless. Form brings limits and thereby makes mater a specific
something, which is what matter resists being. The recalcitrance of matter to receiving
form is, as we know from human experience, one of the sources of evil in our existence.

The matter/form dialectical pair also informs the teaching of progressive
revelation, although the term “form” is used here as “outward appearance” or “historical
expression” and substance as “the essential nature” of all religion. Nevertheless, the
dialectical situation is not changed. There is interaction and/or conflict between the two
until a new Manifestation arrives to establish a new synthesis that maintains the
substance or essential nature of religion in a new outward historical form or expression.

\[58\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, p. 89; emphasis added; also SAQ 280; See also BWF, 240,

\[297\] 18

We should understand that this is only a broad formulation and more study is needed to
establish its details.

Another dialectical pair in the Writings is the two sexes, male and female, which
are described as the wings of one bird, i.e. humankind. They are obviously in inter-action,
influencing each other and being influenced, with different opposed view-points and
interests yet united with intertwined destinies. Neither will be able to reach its fullest
development without commensurate progress in the other. When we regard the two sexes
dialectically, we find that their differences or “oppositions” are part of a process of
mutual inter-action that leads both of them to a higher state of being or, in Hegelian terms,
a higher synthesis. The same will happen to the human environment as this process
proceeds.

Yet another dialectical pair shaping humankind is that of individual/community;
both individual and community shape each other and undue emphasis on one of the

pair creates serious social distortions. For example, within the individual/community pair,
we find the dialectical pair of liberty/true liberty in the Writings. The desire for liberty,
symbolized by “the animal”59 inter-acts in opposition to “true liberty”60 which “consists
in man’s submission to His commandments.”61

Here, too, we observe an inter-active process of ‘oppositional’ pairs that eventually lead
to a higher synthesis in which both the interests of the individual and the community are
preserved.

The dialectical pair material/divine in regards to a civilization also pervades the
Writings.62 In our social development we have the dialectical pair us/other which has
dramatically influenced the course of our material and spiritual history. This pair is also
at work in the concept of progressive revelation. The material conditions and the divine
influx through the Manifestation interact to form or synthesise a new, more advanced
religion and civilization—which in turn is sublated into a higher form by a subsequent
revelation. Indeed, progressive revelation, can also be seen as illustrating the interaction
of the dialectical pair matter/form, i.e. of the matter of previous dispensations in a new
form. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says, “Every community in the world findeth in these Divine
Teachings the realization of its highest aspirations.”63 Of course, no synthesis can last
forever, because if it did, we would exist “in a state of repose” which is impossible
according to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Whenever a synthesis is reached, the process begins again.
Vis-à-vis progressive revelation, a new dispensation is inaugurated.

Most importantly perhaps, dialectical thinking encourages us to look for the
unities hidden beneath apparent opposites and to build on these unities. It also teaches us
to regard most oppositions as part of a process that will eventually lead to a synthesis of

some kind. (In any dialectical synthesis some oppositions are left behind as out-dated
remnants of an earlier phase of development.) This process or dialectical way of
understanding not only refers to discussions but all aspects of life including our
relationship to nature is also of great benefit because it requires us to see everything in
terms of a process that will have many, often unforeseeable consequences of which we
must be careful. This is exactly what has been lacking in our thought and actions
regarding the natural environment. But there are still other advantages to dialectical
thinking.

The synthesis achieved by the Bahá’í dispensation also points to another
characteristic of dialectical thinking—change moves in expanding spirals towards the
never-attainable goal of full or absolute actualization. In other words, the Bahá’í Writings
include the essentials of all other religions albeit in a new, more historically appropriate
form. The spiral widens—and will do so forever as the universe and humankind evolve.
The same is true for human society: the dialectical pair us/other has become more
inclusive as humankind evolves.

Dialectical thinking also maintains that all things are connected to and interact
with each other. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states,

> For all beings are connected together like a chain; and reciprocal help, assistance
> and interaction belonging to the properties of things are the causes of the
> existence, development and growth of created beings. It is confirmed
> through evidences and proofs that every being universally acts upon other beings,
> either absolutely or through association.64

This statement emphasises things would not exist, develop or grow; nothing is isolated
from anything else. Consequently, dialectical thinking encourages us to think in terms of
“wholes” rather than in terms of isolated “parts,” in terms of systems rather than
individual components, and in terms of inter-actions not just our actions. This is precisely
why it is so important for us to adopt dialectical thinking if we want to improve our
relationship with the natural environment.

Our task is to follow the guidance of the Writings and learn to think dialectically
i.e. in terms of continuous cycles of inter-action, especially between humankind and the
natural environment. We can no longer afford to believe that our actions vis-à-vis nature
can be “concluded” or “closed” simply because we think them so. We must also learn to
think of ourselves as part of this process and not detached from it.

It may be objected that according to the Bahá’í Writings, humans as conscious
spiritual beings, are in some sense ‘above nature:

> The exigency of nature demands that he should be restricted to the earth; but he,
> by breaking the laws of nature, soars in the atmosphere high above it. By the

\[64\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, p. 178 – 179; emphasis added.

application of his intellect he overcomes natural law65

However, we must remember that even when we control nature, we are inevitably
involved in a dialectical, i.e. inter-active process so we must still exercise care in how we
control nature and to what purpose.

Part IV: Conclusion

In the foregoing pages, we have seen how the proper study of philosophy can help
us reframe our concepts, develop a “a new orientation to our activities”66 and achieve a
“change of heart.”67 These developments to our inner environment are essential to each
one of us if we are to develop a more positive relationship to the natural world. However,
once aware of what philosophy can do to evolve our inner environment and, thereby, our
actions in the outer environment, we face a simple choice. On one hand we can leave the
reframing of concepts, developing a new orientation and changing our hearts to relatively
haphazard development in which some will progress more readily than others. This,
unfortunately sets a stage for new conflict. On the other hand, we can encourage and
facilitate this evolutionary process by teaching, philosophy, as Abdu’l-Bahá suggests,68 to
everyone to their capacity. Especially if we do this for the young, we are more likely to
raise a thoughtful generation than we have been in the past, and if the world needs
anything, it is more thoughtful people. Without that there is no hope for us or for the
natural environment.
