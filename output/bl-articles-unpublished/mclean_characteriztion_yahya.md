              Characterization in the Writings of Shoghi Effendi:

With Special Attention to Yahya

Abstract

The writings of Shoghi Effendi Rabbaní (1897-1957) contain "brief
characterizations" and "bold and precise condensations" of the monarchs and
ecclesiastics of Bahá'u'lláh's day and individuals more directly connected to the
Bábí-Bahá'í Faith. These characters are historically based and belong consequently
to the world of non-literary prose but are nonetheless imaginatively presented.
Shoghi Effendi's manner of characterization is terse, of strong "authorial
comment," and heavily moralistic. The Guardian does not "let the characters speak
for themselves," following the convention of the novelist. With a vivid realism, he
makes decisive value judgements that assess both motive, action or inaction vis-à-
vis the character's role in aiding or hindering the spread of the early Bábí-Bahá'í
Faith. The dramatic and tumultuous history Shoghi Effendi portrays is peopled
with either heroes or villains. His assessment of the historical status of these
figures is determined entirely by their rejection or acceptance of the missions of the
Báb and Bahá'u'lláh. This tendency is most clearly evident in the depiction of
Mírzá Yahyá (Subh-i-Azal, "morning of eternity") (c. 1832-1912), Bahá'u'lláh's
younger half-brother and attempted assassin. This paper examines aspects of
Shoghi Effendi's manner of characterization in a literary critical and theological
perspective and correlates certain demonic features exhibited by Yahyá to the
world of the bizarre religious personalities depicted by the great Russian novelist
Fyodor Mikhailovitch Dostoyevsky (1821-1881).
Characterization as Character Assessment[1]

Characterization has been "the main business of the writer"[2] since the
inception of the modern English-language novel in the mid 1700's. While Shoghi
Effendi was no novelist and not primarily concerned with characterization, the
character sketch merits nonetheless further consideration in any study of the

Guardian's writings. This literary device is employed in both God Passes By (1944)
and The Promised Day is Come (1941), the two main works employing what may
be more properly called the character stamp.

Shoghi Effendi's characters belong to the world of historical non-fiction and
not, in essayist William Hazlitt's phrase in describing the novel, to "the airy
medium of romance."[3] Firuz Kazemzadeh in his 1967 preface to The Promised
Day Is Come remarked upon Shoghi Effendi's "brief characterizations" and "bold
and precise condensations" (ix) of the crowned heads of Europe and the Middle
East, and the Muslim and Christian ecclesiastics who received and rejected
Bahá'u'lláh's letters of proclamation. Kazemzadeh's comment holds true, not only
for The Promised Day is Come and God Passes By, but also for the cablegrams
that Shoghi Effendi composed describing the character of his enemies or when
lauding the virtues and exemplary services of Bahá'ís who had just died.

What Otto Reinert has written of the poet and the novelist, in
contradistinction to the playwright, applies to the Guardian's character stamps. "He
can judge and analyze his characters in authorial comment, by godlike ubiquity and
omniscience enter at will into their hearts and souls, and just as easily exit back
into straight narrative of external events."[4] The hyperbolic use of the words
"godlike" and "omniscience" are meant to indicate the mastery an author of fiction
may exercise over characters, since they are largely the author's own creation.[5]
While the Guardian's writings are historically based, his character portrayals are
stamped nonetheless with this authorly omniscience.

As mentioned above, the Guardian's aim was to assess the role of a
particular historical figure in light of his or her response to the Bahá'í Revelation.
However, we should not overlook the fact that Shoghi Effendi was guided in his
observations by the writings of European historians or observers, a consideration
that deserves further investigation. His description of Pope Pius IX, whom Shoghi
Effendi clearly viewed as an antagonist, indicates that he relied, at least in part, on
such sources which typically he does not identify:[6]

> Authoritarian by nature, a poor statesman, disinclined to conciliation,
> determined to preserve all his authority, he, while he succeeded through
> his assumption of an ultramontane attitude in defining further his
> position and in reinforcing his spiritual authority, failed, in the end, to
> maintain that temporal rule which, for so many centuries, had been
exercised by the heads of the Catholic Church.[7]

Shoghi Effendi also sought those testimonies that would validate his
argument. He remained unaffected by any contemporary and academic concerns
for the "objective" and detached historiography of the university textbook. He was

both theological historian and historical theologian. For example, the Guardian
naturally shared Lord Curzon of Kedleston's incisive observation that the
massacres of the Bábís following the attempt on the life of Násiri'd-Dín Sháh
(August 15, 1852), gave the Bahá'í Faith "a vitality which no other impulse could
have secured."[8]

Like the novelist, Shoghi Effendi also wrote by "invisualisation," or seeing
into his characters, just as the private world of motives, dreams and prayers was
laid bare before the vision of his Great-Grandfather as attested in his proclamation
letters.[9] We are quite far here from the novelist's tendency of letting the characters
speak for themselves. In this case, the characters are spoken for or spoken of.
These comments, for example, are reserved for William II, the second German
Emperor and the successor to the recipient of Bahá'u'lláh's tablet:

> William II, temperamentally dictatorial, politically inexperienced,
> militarily aggressive, religiously insincere, posed as the apostle of
> European peace, yet actually insisted on "the mailed fist" and "the
> shining armor." Irresponsible, indiscreet, inordinately ambitious, his
> first act was to dismiss that sagacious statesman [Bismarck], the true
> founder of his empire, to whose sagacity Bahá'u'lláh had paid tribute,
> and to the unwisdom of whose imperial and ungrateful master
`Abdu'l-Bahá had testified (PDC 4).

While one can readily understand how Shoghi Effendi came to these views
through his own reading of European history ("politically inexperienced, military
aggressive"), the more subjective phrase "religiously insincere"[10] suggests an
assessment arrived at by subtler means.

Both The Promised Day Is Come and God Passes By report on the final
destinies of the monarchs and clerics who ignored or scorned Bahá'u'lláh's message
or persecuted him or his followers. While the former work may be roughly
classified as a historical treatise, it is atypical in both form and content compared to
academic or current treatments of history. It is more properly a contemporary
rendering of an ancient view of providential history, written in an original voice
and style, contextually modern but theologically conservative. Spoken with the
authoritative voice of Amtscharisma[11] ("charisma of office"), polymodal in
exposition and synthetic in approach, it cites scripture in context with historical
narrative and is heavy with authorial comment. In a "Judaic" prophetic voice of
protest and judgement, it makes strong theological pronouncements of the world's
travails as a result of "This judgment of God" which Shoghi Effendi views as a
"...retributory calamity and an act of holy and supreme discipline" (PDC 4) for the
world's tragic rejection of Bahá'u'lláh which the Guardian lays squarely at the feet

of the kings and ecclesiastics as "... a responsibility appalling and inescapable..."
(PDC 18).

The Judaic element in The Promised Day Is Come is evident, not only in its
central theme of divine retribution, but also in its pervasive use of iconoclastic
language, specifically in the mention of the "false idols" (PDC 112) that hold sway
over humanity, an iconoclasm that has its origins in the Hebrew Bible as the
prohibition against idolatry (Deut. 5:8-9). Shoghi Effendi writes: "The chief idols
in the desecrated temple of mankind are none other than the triple gods of
Nationalism, Racialism and Communism, at whose altars governments and
peoples, whether democratic or totalitarian, at peace or at war, of the East or of
the West, Christian or Islamic, are, in various forms and in different degrees, now
worshiping" (PDC 113). The Guardian implies by this statement that humanity is
practising forms of de facto polytheism, deceptive and deadly substitute religions
that detract from the worship of God and that alienate man from himself.

Erich Fromm, drawing on Paul Tillich, writes that the modern existential
notion of estrangement, expressed philosophically by Hegel in Lectures on the
Philosophy of History (1837) as Entfremdung, "...found its first expression in
Western thought in the Old Testament concept of idolatry."[12] Through idolatry
man is estranged, at one stroke, from both God and himself. However, to
overemphasize the purely retributive aspect of this book as an exercise in the
vengeance of God on nineteenth and twentieth century rulers and society for
rejecting Bahá'u'lláh is to misunderstand both Shoghi Effendi's theology and his
reading of providential history:

> God, however, as has been pointed out in the very beginning of these
> pages, does not only punish the wrongdoings of His children. He
> chastises because He is just, and He chastens because He loves. Having
> chastened them, He cannot, in His great mercy, leave them to their fate.
> Indeed, by the very act of chastening them He prepares them for the
> mission for which He has created them. "My calamity is My providence,"
> He, by the mouth of Bahá'u'lláh, has assured them, "outwardly it is fire
and vengeance, but inwardly it is light and mercy" (PDC 115-16).

Here is Shoghi Effendi's determined vignette of Emperor Charles Louis
Napoleon III (1808-1873), son of Louis and nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte I and
recipient of two of Bahá'u'lláh's tablets. Shoghi Effendi's acerbic critique is no
doubt motivated by the emperor's disdainful rejection of Bahá'u'lláh's first tablet —
"If this man is God, I am two gods!" (PDC 51) — but also contains properly
historical judgments of the emperor:

Possessed of a fixed and indestructible ambition, he aspired to emulate
> the example, and finish the interrupted work, of his imperial uncle. A
> dreamer, a conspirator, of a shifting nature, hypocritical and reckless,
> he, the heir to the Napoleonic throne, taking advantage of the policy
> which sought to foster the reviving interest in the career of his great
> prototype, had sought to overthrow the monarchy...Though able to
> initiate far-reaching movements, he possessed neither the sagacity nor
the courage required to control them. (PDC 50).

The Guardian also calls Napoleon "...that superficial, tricky and pride-
intoxicated monarch...this false and boastful monarch..." (PDC 51). Where Shoghi
Effendi stands vis-à-vis these "...ill-fated scions.." who rejected Bahá'u'lláh, he
makes indubitably clear, with few nuances. Except for the partly qualified cases of
Queen Victoria[13] and Czar Alexander II,[14] his judgement is categorical: "All
failed completely in their duty to arise and extend their assistance" [to Bahá'u'lláh]
(PDC 48). Hubris, that mainstay of the Greek tragedy, is brought to life again in
the Guardian's writings. The monarchs and ecclesiastics who ignored, disdained or
opposed the Persian prisoner and exile, were shaken from their thrones by the
"invisible Hand of God."[15] (cf. Dan. 7:9: "I beheld till the thrones were cast down,
and the Ancient of Days did sit [upon it]."

Shoghi Effendi's judgemental characterizations were not something entirely
of his own invention. They reflected the morally evaluative tendencies of
nineteenth century historians such as Thomas Babington Macaulay (1800-1859),
English parliamentarian, historian and essayist whose fame rests almost entirely on
his five volume History of England (1848-1861). Shoghi Effendi's wife and
personal secretary Rúhíyyih Rabbaní (née Mary Sutherland Maxwell), (1910-
2000), describes Shoghi Effendi's writings, using Macaulay's words in describing
another author, that "he wrote in language...precise and luminous."[16] Of
Macaulay, Lord Acton wrote: "Read him therefore to find out how it comes that
the most unsympathetic of critics can think of him very nearly the greatest of
English writers."[17] It seems sure that the Guardian had read Macaulay.[18] Here
Macaulay portrays Sir George Jeffreys who lived during the reign of King James II
(1633-1701). Jeffreys was a tyrannical Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench
and assisted in the administration of the Great Seal:
He was a man of quick and vigorous parts, but constitutionally prone to insolence
and to the angry passions....The profusion of maledictions and vituperative epithets
which composed his vocabulary could hardly have been rivalled in the fish-market
or the bear-garden....Already might be remarked in him the most odious vice which
is incident to human nature, a delight in misery merely as misery.[19]

Character as Destiny

The old dictum of the Shakespearean theatre that `Character is destiny'[20]
applies, not only to Shoghi Effendi's dramatis personae, but also to the "unfolding
destiny"[21] of the Bahá'í Faith. The characters who either ignored, opposed or
promoted the new revelation largely determined the immediate fortunes of the
fledgling faith. The younger half-brother, Mírzá Yahyá's "rebellion" against
Bahá'u'lláh in 1864, for example, "...left its mark on the fortunes of the Faith for no
less than half a century."[22]

William Hazlitt's appraisal of the moral function of the novel as an
acquaintance with "the motives and characters of mankind," that "imbibe our
notions of virtue and vice from practical examples..."[23] is also relevant to Shoghi
Effendi's mode of characterization. The qualifying adjectives or adjectival phrases
so pointedly employed by the Guardian are indicators, not only of the stuff of
history, but also imply one of the traditional preoccupations of moral theology. His
character stamps and passing descriptions of positive and negative personal
attributes indicate those virtues worth cultivating and those vices to avoid.
For example, in the depiction of the "vast company"[24] of martyr-disciples of the
Báb (1819-1850), we encounter a string of epithets which reads as an index of the
more heroic, saintly and noble spiritual virtues. The Guardian describes the Bábí
spirit as:

> ...a spirit exalted, unquenchable and awe-inspiring, a knowledge
> surprisingly profound, an eloquence sweeping in its force, a piety
> unexcelled in fervor, a courage leonine in its fierceness, a
> self-abnegation saintly in its purity, a resolve granite-like in its firmness,
> a vision stupendous in its range....a standard of faith and a code of
> conduct that challenged and revolutionized the lives of their
countrymen" (GPB 5).

By contrast, "people, clergy, monarch and government," are depicted as
portraying "...intrigue, ignorance, depravity, cruelty, superstition and cowardice"
(GPB 5). In this hero-villain scenario, considered further below, we find opposing
spiritual attributes juxtaposed in a starkly contrasting mirror-image. Novelist and
essayist Aldous Huxley (1894-1963), who graduated from Balliol College, Oxford
(1915) just five years before Shoghi Effendi arrived there as a "non-collegiate
student"[25] in 1920, and reacting to I.A. Richards' statement that only
Shakespearean theatre "...can stand the test..."of true tragedy, writes: "Now, the
shadow, the photographic negative of a thing, is in no sense irrelevant to it."[26]
Huxley explains:

The tragedies of Shakespeare are veined, it is true, with irony and an often
terrifying cynicism; but the cynicism is always heroic idealism turned neatly inside
out, the irony is a kind of photographic negative of heroic romance. Turn Troilus's
white into black and all his blacks into white and you have Thersites. Reversed
Othello and Desdemona become Iago. White Ophelia's negative is the irony of
Hamlet, is the ingenuous bawdry of her own mad songs; just as the cynicism of
King Lear is the black-shadow replica of Cordelia.[27]

Both history and spirituality can take their clue from this observation.

Abstracted, Shoghi Effendi's villains are, in an ideal sense, potential spiritual
heroes, their dark qualities are positive ones awaiting transformation. Whereas
every sinful deed, cruel or gross act, or quality has its potential counterpart, Shoghi
Effendi presents the great deeds of Bábí-Bahá'í sacred history as the mirror of a
spirituality directly inspired by the living presence of the Manifestations of God,
the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh. Moral purpose was intrinsic to the Guardian's vision of
history, as he explicitly expressed in the Introduction to his translation of Nabíl's
Narrative, The Dawn-Breakers (1932): "It has its thrilling passages, and the
splendour of the central theme gives to the chronicle, not only great historical
value but high moral power."[28] As Shoghi Effendi's characters either assist or foil
the spread of the Bahá'í Revelation, they become thereby either victors or victims
in the creation of their own destiny.

In the writings of the Guardian, moreover, we uncover the Aristotelian
notion of character. For Aristotle, "character" in its ethical sense, was fully
revealed only in action.[29] This maxim applies to God Passes By, The Promised
Day Is Come and the Introduction and Epilogue of Nabíl's Narrative, The Dawn-
Breakers. Shoghi Effendi's characters are not asleep on the page. As is true for the
theater and prominent historical figures, they reveal themselves fully only by
deeds. Implicit in the Guardian's historical writings is the underlying presence of
the reciprocal relationship between the actions of the individual and their outcome
on the events of history, between the inner dynamics of the soul and their decisive
influence on the larger collective. This dual interplay of inner spiritual
predisposition and outer concrete happening characterizes Shoghi Effendi's method
of analyzing and representing historical events.

The "sin-covering eye,"[30] the spiritual prescription for interpersonal
conduct, was held in abeyance by Shoghi Effendi in his persona as writer. The
Guardian's acute critical sense qua defender of the faith and hence writer,
functioning as one manifold, was quite unlike Shoghi Effendi's personal spirituality
which was disinclined to dwell on human failings.[31] But for the purpose of
exposing the dire suffering that was inflicted upon the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh by the
neglect and opposition of the kings and ecclesiastics, and to draw attention to the

world's plight occasioned by the rejection of the twin prophets, Shoghi Effendi
consciously engaged in the exposure of reprehensible deeds and sins of both
commission and omission. Those readers who may find these works too
categorical and forbidding in their moral aspect, should bear in mind that the
purpose, in part, was to draw attention to the unjustified cruelties inflicted upon the
founders of the Bahá'í Faith. As a measure of divine justice, the Guardian laid the
blame directly at the feet of those same leaders who so afflicted "...the true
Monarchs of the world, those Gems of divine virtue!"[32]
Character as the Internal Event of History

The above assertions have also been advanced, in a slightly different
version, by Oxford metaphysician,[33] archaeologist/historian and philosopher of
history R.G. Collingwood in The Idea of History (1946). Robin George
Collingwood (1889-1943), respected as an archaeologist and historian for his work
on Roman Britain, wrote that any historical event has two sides: the external event
"which can be described in terms of bodies and their movements" (Caesar's
assassination on the floor of the Roman Senate) and the internal event "which can
only be described in terms of thought" (Caesar's defiance of republican law).[34]
But we should note here that "defiance" is as much a property of character or soul
as it is idea. In the same context Collingwood wrote "...an historical process is a
process of thoughts."[35] The notion that the idea moves history reveals the
influence of Hegel's Lectures on the Philosophy of History (1837).

For Collingwood, the historian should take account of both internal and
external aspects in the representation and interpretation of the historical act. Put
differently, the historian cannot ignore the determinations of thought which
demand, certainly in Shoghi Effendi's reading of history, character assessment,
since thought is expressed through character. Although Collingwood was sensitive
to the movements of thought as a dimension of history, he was less sympathetic to
the purely psychological considerations in the epistemology of the historian that
motivated Wilhelm Dilthey's theory of history and he criticised Dilthey on that
account.[36]

The historian's main task, according to Collingwood, is "to think himself
into this action, to discern the thought of its agent."[37] For Collingwood, it was
sufficient to examine the "thought" that led to the act, but his notion of the internal
event remained at the level of concept. Shoghi Effendi, however, ventured boldly
into the subjective dynamics of psychology, into ulterior motives and "hidden
agendas." His characterizations of historical figures, however far removed from
current methods of historiography, address the determinations of character on
history, thereby acknowledging character as a substantive issue in the unfolding of

the historical event. If, for Shakespeare, character is destiny, for Shoghi Effendi it
is also history. This does not mean, however, that the Guardian has reduced history
to the subjective dynamics of character, for then history would become subordinate
to individual psychology and the broader sweep and more objective view would be
lost.

Collingwood, like Dilthey and Macaulay envisioned a legitimate role for the
imagination in the writing of history. Macaulay, who is closest to Shoghi Effendi
in his treatment of historical "characters," wrote in his Essay on History: "a perfect
historian must possess an imagination sufficiently powerful to make his narrative
effective and picturesque."[38] This remark indicates that Macaulay was strongly
influenced by the early narrative roots of history and by its literary concept of
history as story. For Shoghi Effendi, likewise, history is both drama and story and
has strong literary qualities. For Collingwood, who followed Kant in this respect,
the imagination was a structural faculty, not ornamental as it was for Macaulay:" it
is this which, operating not capriciously as fancy but in its a priori form, does the
entire work of historical construction."[39]
Heroes and Villains

Heroes and villains figure predominantly into the Guardian's mode of
characterization. His heroes are not the world's heroes. Kings, prime ministers and
courtiers are often his villains. The rich and the powerful, those whom commoners,
the dispossessed and disenfranchised regard with awe and envy, become in Shoghi
Effendi's vision of things, tragic and pitiful figures who were nonetheless worthy
of abject condemnation. The Guardian's overall negative assessment of kings and
ecclesiastics followed closely Bahá'u'lláh's generally dim view of the sacerdotal
caste, especially regarding the clerics of Persia, whose prelates he castigated as:
"...they that worship no God but their own desire, who bear allegiance to naught
but gold, who are wrapt in the densest veils of learning, and who, enmeshed by its
obscurities, are lost in the wilds of error."[40] As for kings, although he praised
exemplary rulers,[41] Bahá'u'lláh also wrote: "The faults of kings, like their favours,
can be great."[42] This saying applies in pointed fashion to the recipients of
Bahá'u'lláh's tablets.

The opening pages of God Passes By make clear this great divide between
those who joined forces with the new revelation and those who aligned themselves
in opposition. Villains are not merely villains. They are "arch villains" (GPB 4).
Heroes display supernatural powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men.
They are virtual gods.[43] The following description of the Bábís, although partially
quoted above, bears repeating here since it stands, in context, in such marked
contrast to the villains whom Shoghi Effendi so graphically portrays:

The arch villains who joined hands with the prime movers of so wicked a
> conspiracy were the two grand vizirs, Hájí Mírzá Áqásí, the idolized
> tutor of Muhammad Sháh, a vulgar, false-hearted and fickle-minded
> schemer, and the arbitrary, bloodthirsty, reckless Amír-Nizám, Mírzá
> Taqí Khán, the first of whom exiled the Báb to the mountain fastnesses of
> Adhirbáyján, and the latter decreed His death in Tabríz. Their
> accomplice in these and other heinous crimes was a government
> bolstered up by a flock of idle, parasitical princelings and governors,
> corrupt, incompetent, tenaciously holding to their ill-gotten privileges,
> and utterly subservient to a notoriously degraded clerical order. The
> heroes whose deeds shine upon the record of this fierce spiritual contest,
> involving at once people, clergy, monarch and government, were the
> Báb's chosen disciples, the Letters of the Living, and their companions,
> the trail-breakers of the New Day, who to so much intrigue, ignorance,
> depravity, cruelty, superstition and cowardice opposed a spirit exalted,
> unquenchable and awe-inspiring, a knowledge surprisingly profound, an
> eloquence sweeping in its force, a piety unexcelled in fervor, a courage
> leonine in its fierceness, a self-abnegation saintly in its purity, a resolve
> granite-like in its firmness, a vision stupendous in its range, a veneration
> for the Prophet and His Imáms disconcerting to their adversaries, a
> power of persuasion alarming to their antagonists, a standard of faith
> and a code of conduct that challenged and revolutionized the lives of
their countrymen (GPB 4-5).

Should the reader find such descriptions over-dramatic or stretching the
limits of credibility, it is because there are very few precedents in human
experience by which to register the unique events that were unleashed in mid-
nineteenth century Persia with the declaration of the Báb. The Bábí revolution
created a situation, not only uniquely inspirational, but also volatile in the extreme.
The true prophet, "standing in the midst," through whom "...the splendour of the
Face of God is made manifest"[44] distilled a "divine elixir"[45] that worked a
uniquely transformative effect on both converts and self-declared enemies. The
converts, "...a galaxy of God-intoxicated heroes..." (GPB 3) win our admiration,
not with rhetoric, nor with literary devices and figures of speech, but with the full
weight of history behind them, a history that has been generated by the Divine
Presence.

Shoghi Effendi does not engage us here in an abstract discussion of spiritual
principles. He spells out deeds. In these pages, history is made the ancillary, even
the foundation of theology and spirituality. For we have fully entered a domain in
which his vehicle, hyperbole, in another strange reversal, becomes the virtual

imposter. Hyperbole cannot itself measure up to the telling of these dramatic
events. We become witnesses by proxy to the rare privilege of "touching the
Absolute," passive observers of the ultimately real and sacrificial effects of a first
creation — what the newly revealed Word of God wrought in the souls, hearts,
minds and bodies of men, women and children who are Its first vital offspring and
who performed by It extraordinary deeds.

It is these events and their effects that Shoghi Effendi is striving to convey
beyond what may seem to some at first reading like sheer dramatization. The
Guardian's art is not only a literal, close mimesis, a representation of life in another
form, but is also eloquent testimony to those supernatural forces that have created
such art. In this endeavour, Shoghi Effendi strives to reawaken, not only our own
somnolent faith, but to inspire a fresh sense of awe and wonder that such deeds
could have been done, were done, and to provoke our sombre and profound
reflection as to their causes. At this point, we are returned to a basic, ancient
motive of rhetoric — persuasion — one of the several conduits of faith, a
persuasion that moves to the point, not only of assent, but beyond assent to action,
the ultima Thulé[46] in the act of reading.

On the other side of the divide, the characters that he finds wanting are not
just any old historical figures resistant to change. With the possible exception of
Queen Victoria, they are sovereigns depicted as negligent, unaware, or retrograde
individuals who are drunk with power and pride, blinded by ignorance, irreligion
and ruled by fierce passions. These sovereigns, in another startling reversal,
become the very antagonists who thwart the progress and prosperity of humanity
by rejecting the Bahá'í Cause. What, we wonder, might have been the outcome for
Persia and the world if "... the bigoted, the sickly, the vacillating Muhammad
Sháh..." had not "...at the last moment cancelled the Báb's imminent visit to the
capital..."? (GPB 4). But again, on this photographic plate of history, there is the
counterpart sovereign; Marie of Rumania, the queen who became a believer.[47]
Correlating the Character of Mírzá Yahyá to the Literary World of
Dostoyevsky[48]

Of the several demonic characters briefly sketched by Shoghi Effendi, that
of Mírzá Yahyá, Bahá'u'lláh's younger brother, is the fullest. It is a significant
measure of the devastating effects of the rebellion of Yahyá, who attempted, by all
means, to overthrow Bahá'u'lláh that Shoghi Effendi writes that its gravity
outweighed even the "...tragic martyrdom of the Báb." This was a "...crisis of the
first magnitude..." that shook the twenty-year-old Faith "...to its roots." Yahyá's
behaviour is "monstrous" (GPB 163), a word that alludes to an ego grown ugly and
vicious beyond all proportions. Shoghi Effendi's moral indictment of Yahyá's

crimes reads like a formal accusation in a court of law which gives at the same
time its verdict:

> His corruption, in scores of instances, of the text of the Báb's writings;
> the blasphemous addition he made to the formula of the adhán by the
> introduction of a passage in which he identified himself with the
> Godhead; his insertion of references in those writings to a succession in
> which he nominated himself and his descendants as heirs of the Báb; the
> vacillation and apathy he had betrayed when informed of the tragic
> death which his Master had suffered; his condemnation to death of all
> the Mirrors of the Bábí Dispensation, though he himself was one of those
> Mirrors; his dastardly act in causing the murder of Dayyán, whom he
> feared and envied; his foul deed in bringing about, during the absence of
> Bahá'u'lláh from Baghdád the assassination of Mírzá `Alí-Akbar, the
> Báb's cousin; and, most heinous of all, his unspeakably repugnant
> violation, during that same period, of the honor of the Báb Himself [49]
> — all these, as attested by Áqáy-I-Kalím, and reported by Nabíl in his
> Narrative, were to be thrown into a yet more lurid light by further acts
the perpetration of which were to seal irretrievably his doom (GPB 165).

These last lines refer, of course, to Yahyá's poisoning of Bahá'u'lláh, one of
several "desperate designs" (165) to do so. Succumbing to his inner urges as an
evil apothecary, Yahyá, smeared the edge of Bahá'u'lláh's tea cup with a toxic
herbal substance he had concocted himself.[50] The attempt very nearly succeeded.
The effects of the attack poisoned Bahá'u'lláh "...sufficiently to produce a serious
illness which lasted no less than a month, and which was accompanied by severe
pains and high fever, the aftermath of which left Bahá'u'lláh with a shaking hand
till the end of His life" (GPB 165). The sum total of Yahyá's litany of crimes was
such that "It brought incalculable sorrow to Bahá'u'lláh, visibly aged Him, and
inflicted, through its repercussions, the heaviest blow ever sustained by Him in His
lifetime" (163-4).

But beyond Shoghi Effendi's indictment and condemnation of Yahyá, what
further insights can we gain into the motivations of this character, epithetized as
"credulous and cowardly" and that "vain and flaccid man" (112), and into the
significance of the poisoning itself? Following the principle of correlation
endorsed by Shoghi Effendi,[51] it is instructive to view Yahyá from the perspective
of the fictional world created by the great Russian novelist Fyodor (Theodore)
Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky (1821-1881), who positively influenced Nietzsche,[52]
and who is regarded, along with Kierkegaard, as one of two founding figures of
modern existentialism. By comparing the bizarre spirituality of Dostoyevsky's
characters to the twisted behaviour of Yahyá, we can derive a set of propositions

that better informs both Yahyá's conduct and the religiously existential world to
which I maintain he belongs.[53]
The first correlative — the bizarre religious world.
Dostoyevsky's characters are pervasively marked by the influence of religion but
are situated, as is Yahyá, within a bizarre and twisted internal universe.
Dostoyevsky's depiction of the practice of Russian orthodox Christianity with its
believers, doubting Thomases, saints, sinners, atheists and nihilists travesties the
polite, ideal theological standards of prescriptive religion, just as Yahyá repeatedly
violated the moral and spiritual norms of the Bábí-Bahá'í Faith. Religion, for
Dostoyevsky's characters, becomes an oppressive instrument of conscience but one
that also liberates and redeems at the same time. On the sacred soil of Mother
Russia, we find the most paradoxical collection of religieux manqués ever
assembled, "...a strange gallery of men and women.

There is an innocent prostitute like Sonia Semenova [Crime and
Punishment], a saintly adulteress such as Sonia Andreievna and a cardinal of the
Roman Catholic Church who no longer believes in God"[54] [The Brothers
Karamazov] (1879-1880) In the explication of the fourth correlative below, we
will return to the paradox of the atheistic cardinal,[55] the "Grand Inquisitor," who
arrests Christ when the Messiah returns to Seville, Spain at the height of the
Inquisition. In Ivan Karamazov's prose poem (Book V, Chapter 5), an interrogation
takes place in a prison cell, during which the cardinal finds fault with Christ for
rejecting Satan's three temptations in the desert (Luke 4:1-13) and argues that
Jesus' offer of salvation renders only the elect truly free. This salvation of the few
would interfere with the institutionalised church's plan of keeping the dull masses
content. But Christ's divine economy would dispense with the need for the church
itself. The cardinal releases Jesus, who remains silent throughout, and orders him
never to return.[56]

Yahyá, while not psychotic, is a character in the extreme and lives and
breathes, as does the gross and vulgar sensualist, the murdered father Fyodor
Karamazov [The Brothers Karamazov] in a dark, subterranean realm. Yahyá is
very much an "Underground Man."[57] He dwells perpetually in the cloak-and-
dagger world of the vile scheme and the hatching plot. His world is ruled by the
imperious and inflexible demands of "the insistent self," one of `Abdu'l-Bahá's
indications of the presence of the demonic. Yahyá was "spurred on by this
mounting jealousy and impelled by his passionate love of leadership" (GPB 165).
He will stop at nothing to get what he wants, not even at the horror of murdering
the very Elder Brother who "had watched over his early youth and manhood"
(165). Of such "covenant-breakers,"[58] `Abdu'l-Bahá writes: "They gave up

everlasting glory in exchange for human pride, and they sacrificed greatness in
both worlds to the demands of "the insistent self."[59]

While evil may be a metaphysical non-reality for the speculative
theologian,[60] it remains a disturbing fact of life and grist for the mill of many a
writer who generally finds an evil character easier to portray than a virtuous one.
Hubben comments that evil and sin are easier to analyze than "...virtue, perfection
and saintliness...".... "...because evil and sin are finite and human," whereas these
higher qualities "..reach out into the infinite realm of eternity."[61] Shoghi Effendi's
graphic depictions of the evil forces that governed Yahyá highlight, by contrast,
the benevolence and magnanimity of Bahá'u'lláh.

The presentation of evil, in which Kierkegaard also succeeded so admirably,
evokes by contrast the image of perfection. But virtue and perfection transcend the
borders of psychology, and our inability to understand them when they appear in
great strength is as irremediable as our incompetence fully to understand Jesus.[62]
Or Bahá'u'lláh.
The second correlative — character as soul.
Dostoyevsky's characters are the concrete intra subjective expressions of the
human soul which becomes, as much as Mother Russia is the external locus, the
inner setting of his novels: "The soul is the stage for triumph, defeat, and suffering,
and all that seems to matter in life is the consideration of what life has done or will
do to man's soul."[63] This thought is akin to Shoghi Effendi's statement through his
secretary: "The troubles of this world pass, and what we have left is what we have
made of our souls; so it is to this we must look — no matter what our human minds
and bodies go through."[64] William Hubben writes of Dostoyevsky's characters:
"The intersubjective conditions of friendship, love, hate, suspicion, and tension
seem to occupy them more than anything else, and they are forever engaged in this
tempestuous business of loving, hating, helping, or destroying themselves and
others, in finding or losing life, in rushing headlong into the hell of despair or the
heaven of happiness."[65]

These characters strike the reader as being graphically real because they are
representations and composites of individuals Dostoyevsky had encountered
throughout his lifetime in such places as the prison in Omsk, Siberia where he was
exiled (1850-1855) following his arrest on April 23, 1849 for being a member of
the Petrashevsky Circle, "a socialist group of middle-class liberals interested in
Fournier's theories."[66] As a member of the lesser nobility, Dostoyevsky was
familiar with all types in Russian society — peasants, prisoners, clerics and nobles.
With Yahyá also, hell and damnation take place within the subterranean regions of

the mortal soul. Tragically, he refused the heaven of salvation proffered to him by
Bahá'u'lláh.

Yahyá is a complex individual who nonetheless exhibits traits of a
stereotypical personification of evil with his morbidly unidimensional, "flat"[67]
character. Like the "negative space" on an artist's canvas that helps the eye to focus
on those elements that really make the painting, Yahyá seems to stretch laterally
into infinite darkness. In his theory of narrative texts, Mieke Bal notes that
characters may change and that "The changes or transformations which a character
undergoes sometimes alter the entire configuration of character as it looked during
the analysis of mutual relations."[68] Yahyá, however, while accelerating into evil,
remains negatively static.

But his very negativity draws the reader's attention to Bahá'u'lláh's
magnanimity, forgiveness and patience, his willingness to bear unbearable
suffering at the hands of the younger brother. Yahyá is possessed by the pathetic
yet dangerous drives of a starving ego in need of constant feeding. In this respect,
`Abdu'l-Bahá's descriptive imagery characterizing the relationship between Yahyá
and Siyyid Muhammad of Isfáhán, "...the Antichrist[69] of the Bahá'í
Revelation...""...the    black-hearted      scoundrel     who       befooled       and
manipulated..."Yahyá, is pointed indeed. He describes their relationship as that of
"the sucking child" to the "much-prized breast" of its mother (GPB 112-113). The
Freudian implications are not lost on the reader. Yahyá is stuck at an infantile stage
of development.

The motivation for Yahyá's irrational crimes results in the mystery and the
conundrum of the chilling notion of the unforgivable sin. Simply put, his soul hates
the light. Because of overweening vanity, he cannot be content to show his paltry
candle to the illumination of the sun. He imagines that he can extinguish the sun
itself. This condition goes far beyond mere dislike for Bahá'u'lláh, in either his
human station as elder brother or in his divine station as Manifestation of God.
`Abdu'l-Bahá teaches that "If a soul remains far from the manifestation, he may yet
be awakened; for he did not recognize the manifestation of the divine perfections.
But if he loathe the divine perfections themselves — in other words, the Holy
Spirit — it is evident that he is like a bat which hates the light."[70] There is no
remedy and no forgiveness for this aversion.[71] (There can be no help for a
ravaging, life-threatening disease if the patient refuses the remedy). Nevertheless,
Bahá'u'lláh assures Yahyá of God's forgiveness, were he to truly repent.[72]
The third correlative — redemption and damnation.
Redemption and damnation are central to the destiny of Dostoyevsky's gospel-like
figures. In Crime and Punishment (1866), the main character Raskolnikov, who

has murdered money lender Alonya Ivanova and her sister Lizaveta, allows
himself to be redeemed by the love of Sofia (nickname Sonia) Semyanova
Marmaledov, the prostitute. Raskolnikov is moved to accept the full responsibility
for his crimes by Sonia's compassion, openness and simple child-like faith. This
raises the question of how redemption might have applied to Yahyá.

The redemption parallel is valid, but only in a backhanded way. If Yahyá
does have any redeeming qualities, Shoghi Effendi is not about to tell us what they
are. The Guardian seems to forgo the possibility: "All these [acts]...the perpetration
of which were to seal irretrievably his doom" (GPB 165).If we view this last
comment as a post-Aqdas reflection on forgiveness, it would appear to underscore
a belief in eternal damnation, i.e. where the offer of forgiveness has been refused.
Redemption, however, is secured through the vicarious suffering endured for all
humanity. Yahyá, unregenerate, becomes the catalyst that reveals the magnificent
patience and long-suffering of the Persian prisoner:

> “The Ancient Beauty hath consented to be bound with chains that
> mankind may be released from its bondage, and hath accepted to be
> made a prisoner within this most mighty Stronghold that the whole
> world may attain unto true liberty. He hath drained to its dregs the cup of
> sorrow, that all the peoples of the earth may attain unto abiding joy, and
be filled with gladness.”[73]

This "cup of sorrow" is far from being an ornamental literary device. The
phrase takes on a heightened, literal meaning when viewed in the lurid light of the
poisoned tea cup. C.S. Lewis had made some observations that relate directly to
`Abdu'l-Bahá's teaching above on the innate detestation of the divine light. Among
Shoghi Effendi's several epithets of Yahyá, we find the word "vain" (GPB 112).
Vanity (vainglory) is, of course, related to pride. These two negative qualities are
closely linked by Bahá'u'lláh in The Kitáb-i-Íqán in those passages of this
preeminent doctrinal work that qualify the attributes of the `true seeker": "He must
never seek to exalt himself above any one, must wash away from the tablet of his
heart every trace of pride and vainglory.[74] It would seem that Bahá'u'lláh, in the
same context, continues to refer to this negative attribute as the one that most
seriously endangers the salvation of the soul: "How often hath a sinner, at the hour
of death, attained to the essence of faith, and, quaffing the immortal draught, hath
taken his flight unto the celestial Concourse. And how often hath a devout believer,
at the hour of his soul's ascension, been so changed as to fall into the nethermost
fire."[75]

Lewis remarks that pride or vanity is essentially a competitive sin which at
bottom conceals enmity or hatred. The proud or vain person props up his/her ego

by deriving satisfaction in looking down on others in a spirit of imaginary
comparative greatness. When you encounter God, "you come up against something
that is in every respect immeasurably superior to yourself."[76] This immeasurable
superiority is precisely what Yahyá saw in Bahá'u'lláh. But instead of humbling
himself before that manifest light, Yahyá was consumed with envy. Succumbing to
the sin of "covetousness,"[77] he began to plot how he might destroy the Glory of
God.

In a concise sketch of Dostoyevsky's life and work, Alfred Kazin observes
that "Dostoevsky's greatest novels are all, ritualistically as well as symbolically,
stories of murder. And the murder, as Dostoevsky well knew, is always of the
Father God."[78] In Yahyá's unsuccessful attempts to strike down the Elder Brother,
we encounter the ultimate futility — the literal attempt at deicide, the death of
God. But even here, he is a bungler. Bahá'u'lláh, while gravely injured, will defy
Yahyá and live on until divine omnipotence bids him depart. The lot of the Glory
of God will be that of a living martyr.
The fourth correlative — free will and divine omniscience.
Dostoyevsky's characters and the rebellion of Yahyá raise the vexing problem of
human liberty in relation to evil and the justification of God or the problem of
theodicy, "...the attempt to justify God's goodness in spite of the existence of evil
and suffering."[79] In the context of the poisoning, we must ask ourselves, why, in
view of his omniscience, did Bahá'u'lláh allow Yahyá to poison him, in spite of the
great hardship he had already endured as prisoner and exile and despite the great
illness which it subsequently caused him?

Ivan Karamazov, the religiously philosophic yet tortured atheistic[80] son in
The Brothers Karamazov convinces his illegitimate brother and household servant,
Smerdyakov that if God and the immortality of the soul do not exist then
`everything is lawful (permitted).'[81] Ivan, a much subtler version of Siyyid
Muhammad of Isfáhán, who acted as the "vile whisperer" (GPB 164) who led
Yahyá astray, and using Smerdyakov as the willing tool of his own murderous
urges, thus removes any fear of divine retribution and thereby clears the way for
the epileptic brother to murder the bestial father, Fyodor Karamazov. The
multitude of Mirzá's crimes suggests that Yahyá considered himself to be fully
justified and beyond the pale of the reprehensible deed. This must bring us to the
conclusion that, in spite of his claims of divinity, Yahyá is a de facto atheist.

The suffering to which Bahá'u'lláh was subjected, like the "mystery of
sacrifice",[82] to which it is closely connected, cannot be fully understood in the
abstract. In ultimate theological terms, `Abdu'l-Bahá argues that nothing at all
happens without God's consent, in the sense that God supplies a latent power to all

actions, even though an event x may be secondarily caused by something other
than divine intervention.[83] Despite the repeated affirmations of divine
omnipotence in scripture, however, much of the course of human history has been
determined by the baser actions of human beings in violation of God's will.
Religious history is replete with examples of how the will of the Divine
Manifestation was frequently countermanded by ill-willed, ordinary human beings.

Here we encounter one of the essentials of divine tragedy: that the Divine
Will does not in space-time always prevail over human will. Purely theological
arguments, however they are calculated, that the rejection and/or unlawful death of
the Divine Manifestation, or his sufferings, were predestined are not really helpful
here. To argue that the outcome of all events was predetermined by God destroys
the whole notion of tragedy by removing the quality of free-will. Free will in
theological and dramatic terms is the very source of both tragedy and the events of
history.

But despite his persistent misdeeds, Yahyá knew, of course, that he was
wrong, just as Judas Iscariot (Judas of Kerioth) knew that he was betraying Jesus.
That Judas hanged himself at the moment of Christ's arrest offers vivid proof
(Matt: 27:5). This confrontation of psycho-spiritual motivation in rebellion, with
its consequent performance of deeds that fly in the face of divine good-pleasure,
raises the puzzling question of what I have called "the irony of knowledge." In an
essay that reflects upon the "existential moment," through a discussion of Judas's
betrayal and Peter's momentary denial of Christ, I have reflected upon the
powerlessness of knowledge in the face of a malevolent will:
“Here is a cogent example of the irony of knowledge. We are accustomed to
believing that knowledge is power and that to be forewarned is to be forearmed.
We are taught that with knowledge and foresight souls can be educated, behaviour
can change. Judas, however, could not be dissuaded by the foreknowledge of
Christ from enacting the treacherous deed which, according to `Abdu'l-Bahá, was
motivated by a conflagration of hate and envy which had consumed his heart...The
meaning of Judas's existential moment is that foreknowledge is a useless thing in
the face of the malevolent will. And in the face, too, of the inexorable will of
destiny by which such woes must come into the world....Without will, knowledge
is lame.[84]

We encounter the same phenomenon in Part One of Dostoyevsky's Notes
From Underground (1864) which was the precursor to all modern, existentialist
literature with the Underground Man's brutal, anxiety-driven, self-analysis and
self-condemnation. In typical Dostoyevskean fashion, from the very first lines we
jump right into the conflicted mind of the unnamed narrator who engages in a

disturbing, rambling, hyper-introspective monologue that exposes his mean and
spiteful psychological underground, the world of `the real man of the Russian
majority.'[85]
“I am a sick man....I am an angry man. I am an unattractive man. I think there is
something wrong with my liver. But I don't understand the least thing about my
illness, and I don't know for certain what part of me is affected. I am not having
any treatment for it, and never have had, although I have a great respect for
medicine and for doctors....No, I refuse treatment out of spite...I know better than
anybody that I am harming nobody but myself.”[86]

While the reader may be sympathetic to some of the protests of the
embittered Underground Man expressed in Part One against the utopian socialism
which Dostoyevsky once favoured, the Underground Man of Part Two emerges as
a twisted anti-hero who psychologically abuses Liza the prostitute and who merits
the misery of the subterranean realm from which he is powerless to escape. The
Underground Man is lamentably defective in will power; skilled in diagnosis but
inept at prescribing the remedy. Like Yahyá, in violation of conscience, he
knowingly commits reprehensible acts.
The fifth correlative — the existential mood of estrangement.
Both Dostoyevsky's characters and the acts committed by Yahyá raise the theme of
self-and-other estrangement, a singularly "modern,"[87] existential theme. Some of
Dostoyevsky's characters (Raskolnikov, Fyodor Karamazov) are violent, fear-
ridden and lonely. They live in the faceless, loveless world of the discontented,
insatiable, or quietly despairing self, a self that lives perpetually at odds with its
own conscience in a hostile or friendless environment. Yahyá, whose starving ego
craved attention to a pathological degree, lives in a fearful and lonely world.

In its extreme form as antipathy, estrangement is another aspect of the
demonic. Yahyá's estrangement from Bahá'u'lláh is both ironic and complete since
self-knowledge, abiding love and reunion with God were perfectly manifested in
the person of the Elder Brother. But, instead, what a lonely world he chooses: the
flights in disguise, the cowardly retreats from the maddened crowd, the stays in
communicado, the incessant improprieties, interpolations and intrigues conducted
in secret. The slow escalation into evil came finally to that not so subtle homicidal
insinuation that Ustád Muhammad-`Alí Salmání, the barber, assassinate Bahá'u'lláh
in the public bath.[88] Finally, his direct attempts on Bahá'u'lláh's life.

His outlandish crimes finally necessitated that Bahá'u'lláh drive a wedge
between Yahyá and himself. Estranged from Bahá'u'lláh, he is, above all, a man
profoundly estranged from the reality of his own soul. His repeated flights from

others were only the obverse of the great flight from self. Consumed in the firepit
> of his own ego, Yahyá forgot God and cut himself off from the very roots of his
> own being: "True loss is for him whose days have been spent in utter ignorance of

> In a quasi-literal sense, Yahyá had known God. Seen in the light of the blind envy
> that possessed him, this saying of Muhammad takes on an ironic twist: "He hath

\[45\] . In his preeminent doctrinal work, Bahá'u'lláh pursues an alchemical discourse involving the substances of copper and gold in which

\[51\] . In three of his letters, Shoghi Effendi advocated a method of correlation in order to relate the Bahá'í Faith "to modern aspects of

\[60\] . `Abdu'l-Bahá's statements on the nonexistence of evil are virtually identical to those of St. Thomas Aquinas in the Summa. `Abdu'l-

> Bahá says that evil is the privation of positive qualities: "Evil is simply their nonexistence....so death is the absence of
> life....Darkness is the absence of light:" (Some Answered Questions 263-64). Aquinas writes in the Summa Theologica: "As was
