Reflections of a Human Spirit in a Male Body

William S. Hatcher

On the basis of all available historical evidence, it appears that the Bahá’í Faith is
the first world religion to teach and proclaim unequivocally the equality of men and
women. Indeed, ‘Abdu’l–Bahá has said:

He [Bahá’u’lláh] establishes the equality of men and women.     This is peculiar
to the teaching of Bahá’u’lláh, for all other religions have placed man above woman.1

Contemporaneously with the enunciation and proclamation of this religious teaching, there
arose (primarily in the West) a largely secular movement towards the liberation of women
which focused, broadly speaking, on the following theses: (1) throughout history, women
have generally been oppressed by men and, among other things, have been systematically
denied the opportunities for education, intellectual development, and participation in social
or political affairs; (2) contemporary societies exhibit and enshrine many forms of gender
discrimination, and these practices must be confronted and eliminated; (3) attitudes towards
women based on a presumption of male superiority must be challenged, refuted, and
eliminated.

The advancement of this wide-ranging woman's movement has proceeded on many
fronts and taken many forms: social, political, sexual, religious, psychological. Moreover,
except for a minority (largely within the confines of Western societies), males have either
sabotaged or resisted this process, and it is women themselves who have had to assert their
rights and insist on their prerogatives.

From the nineteenth-century beginnings of modern feminism until the present time,
the relationship between secular feminism and the Bahá’í Faith has been checkered and
unclear. On the one hand, Bahá’ís have wholly endorsed and supported such feminist goals
as the right to vote or equal access to education and job opportunities. On the other hand,
more recent tenets of some schools of feminism (which advocate such things as unrestricted
sexual license) clearly contradict Bahá’í teachings concerning the sanctity and importance
of marriage and the family (which teachings, let it be said, apply with equal stringency to
men).

But the most fundamental problem in assessing feminism from the Bahá’í perspetive
lies in the fact that much literature on the subject (including some written by Bahá’ís) has
taken the form of a feminist analysis of Bahá’í teachings rather than a Bahá’í analysis of
feminist issues. It is not so much a question that this "one-way" relationship is unfair, but
rather that it does not permit the unique contribution a truly spiritually-based perspective
brings to the whole question of gender relations. Moreover, even in those instances when a
religious analysis is attempted, the Bahá’í viewpoint is often assimilated to the general
religious perspective derived from the traditional religious communities which never taught
gender equality and which are struggling within themselves to define and articulate their
own view of the question.

The present article represents a small attempt to reverse this trend and to address the
question of feminism frankly from a Bahá’í perspective. Our premise is that the Bahá’í

teachings offer a unique spiritually-based understanding of the issue and articulate
important insights of potential interest to all feminists.

The Oneness of Humankind Revisited

Any two entities in existence may be compared according to their degree of
similarity or their degree of difference. Moreover, any two existents share at least some
things in common (if nothing else, the fact that they both exist). Yet, no matter how similar,
any two existents must differ in some respects (otherwise there would only be one identical
existent and not two, and thus nothing to compare in the first place).

Not only is there the question of the objective degree of similarity or difference
between two existents, there is also the subjective question of what one chooses to
emphasize when articulating a given comparision. In particular, for any mutual encounter
between two human beings, the two parties involved always have a choice of whether to
focus on their differences or on their similarities.

The pivotal teaching of the Bahá’í Faith is the oneness of humankind. Among the
implications of this teaching is the similarity principle: that which any two human beings
have in common is greater and more important than whatever differentiates them. In other
words, close your eyes and pick any two human beings anywhere on earth. What they have
in common __ their essential human nature __ is far more important than whatever
separates them, whether cultural, physical, psychological, social, or religious.

The basis of the oneness principle, and its derivative, the similarity principle, is a
God-created human nature that is intrinsic (to every individual) and universal (shared by all
humans). This universal and essential human nature resides within the nonmaterial,
immortal soul or spirit of each human being, and the fundamental or defining capacity of
the soul is its ability to reflect or mirror all of the attributes of God:

Having created the world and all that liveth and moveth therein, He           [God],
through the direct operation of His unconstrained and       sovereign Will, chose to confer
upon man the unique distinction        and capacity to know Him and to Love Him -- a
capacity that must needs be regarded as the generating impulse and primary        purpose
underlying the whole of creation. . . Upon the inmost       reality of each and every created
thing He hath shed the light of       one of His names, and made it a recipient of the glory
of one of       His attributes. Upon the reality of man, however, He hath focused the
radiance of all of His names and attributes, and made it a mirror of His own Self. Alone of
all created things man hath been singled out for so great a favor, so enduring a bounty.2

Elsewhere, the Bahá’í writings make it clear that the term "man" in this and other similar
passages is strictly generic: "Man is a generic term applying to all humanity."3 Thus, the
"reality of man" referred to above is the nonphysical soul (or spirit) of the individual, and
this soul is exalted above and independent of all physical limitations.4 It follows that the
soul's essential capacity of reflecting all the attributes of God is wholly independent of
whether a particular soul is attached to a male or a female body. This fact means that we are
all essentially and fundamentally human before we are specifically and secondarily male or
female.

Thus, any comparison between men and women that focuses primarily on their
differences, without taking into consideration their fundamental identity as humans, is
bound to be faulty and unbalanced. In the Bahá’í conception, men and woman are
absolutely equal because their essential spiritual reality and capacity are literally the same:
gender equality is a preestablished and objective fact. Of course, this fact must be
appropriately acknowledged and implemented on the social level, but the Bahá’í conception
stands in significant contrast to the secular, psychosocial view that sees gender equality
primarily as a subjective concept which will have objective existence only when it is
socially established.

Indeed, in the absence of the framework that sees the essential reality of the
individual as spiritual and pre-existent with respect to physical reality, sexual differentiation
becomes the fundamental determinant of the human personality. In this case, the
presumption of difference becomes the primary basis of the relationship between men and
women. From this viewpoint, gender equity can only be achieved by overcoming objective
differences rather than, as from the spiritual viewpoint, by recognizing and acknowledging
that our common spiritual identity as human beings is prior to and more imporant than our
sexual differentiation, regardless of whether the latter is ultlimtely attributed to biology, to
socialization or to both.

The Historical Origins of Gender Inequities in Society

Nevertheless, the question remains: if gender equality is a preestablished fact of the
human reality, why has this equality remained socially unrealized throughout history? Both
secular feminism and the Bahá’í Faith give essentially the same answer to this question:
man has persistently dominated woman throughout history and prevented her from
exhibiting her true human capacity.

The world in the past has been ruled by force, and man has                   dominated over
woman by reason of his more forceful and aggressive qualities. . . .5

In past ages . . . woman was considered inferior to man, even     from            the
standpoint of her anatomy and creation. She was considered especially inferior in
intelligence, and the idea     prevailed universally that it was not allowable for her to step

into the arena of important affairs. . . . The conditions in past  centuries     were
due to woman's lack of opportunity. She was             denied the right and privilege of
education and left in her      undeveloped state. Naturally, she could not and did not

advance.6

Woman's lack of progress and proficiency has been due to her need of equal
education and opportunity. Had she been allowed this equality, there is no doubt she
would be the counterpart of man in ability and capacity.7

In the world of humanity . . . the female sex is treated as though inferior, and is
not allowed equal rights and privileges.        This condition is due not to nature, but to
education. In the       Divine Creation there is no such distinction. Neither sex is

superior to the other in the sight of God. Why then should one        sex assert the
inferiority of the other, without just rights and      privileges as though God had given His

authority for such a course of action? If women received the same educational

advantages as those of men, the result would demonstrate the   equality of
capacity of both for scholarship.8

Thus, in spite of the fundamental and essential equality of capacity between men and
women, men have used to their selfish advantage the fact that they are, in some ways,
physically stronger than women. Men have abused this particular difference and used it to
suppress the development of woman. The main feature of this suppression is the persistent
denial of educational opportunities. However, it has also taken the form of outright physical
domination and restriction.

The status of woman in former times was exceedingly deplorable, for it was the
belief of the Orient tht it was best for       woman to be ignorant. It was considered
preferable that she should not know reading or writing in order that she might not     be
informed of events in the world. Woman was considered to be        created for rearing
children and attending to the duties of the household. If she pursued educational courses,
it was deemed           contrary to chastity; hence women were made prisoners of the

household. The houses did not even have windows opening upon the outside
world.9

In other words, since men held power and controlled the parameters of public and social
life, they were able to create a situation in which it appeared that the trivial and secondary
physical differences between men and women reflected a truly fundamental difference in
nature. This is the illusion that men sought to maintain and that modern feminism, both
secular and religious, has challenged.

Redressing Gender Social Inequality

Although secular and religious feminism agree on the historic cause of social
inequality between the sexes, the philosophical differences in their respective
understandings of human nature have led to quite different approaches to the problem of
redressing inequality. Because they discount the objective existence of the nonphysical soul
__ the only metaphysical basis for an objective, preexisting gender equality __ many secular
feminists have come to feel that the only way to establish gender equality is to prove that
there are no objective differences whatever between the sexes. They have thus set
themselves an impossible task as a precondition and criterion for establishing social
equality between the sexes.

Viewed from any angle, this was and is a tragic mistake. In the first place, there
obviously are objective differences between the sexes, and so the strategy of interpreting
gender equality as absolute identity of function in all respects creates an easy target for
those men (and women) who, for whatever reason, seek to discredit not only the particular
methods but the very goals of feminism (whether secular or religious). Further, it dissipates
energy by shifting the focus from the real problems that women face in their quest for social
equality to quixotic attempts at proving, for example, that given enough training women can
learn to be just as brutal at war as men have always been. This is doubtless true, but why

should women feel impelled to demonstrate such a thing? In what way does this enhance
the status or value of women?

However, if we do take into account the existence of the soul and the objectivity of
preexisting gender equality, as spiritually-based feminism does, then women can, from the
very beginning, be secure in their identity. Rather than trying to "prove" their equality with
chauvinist males by competing with the latter, spiritually-based feminists can focus on
genuine self-affirmation and self-development. Women are then free to define themselves
in their own terms rather than on the terms of the common-denominator male values, which
do not even represent the best of men. Besides, most chauvinist males will never be
convinced of the true capacity of females no matter what women do, because the chauvinist
male is insensitive to superior and refined human values of any sort __ whether male or
female.

Let those who will brutalize each other. Why do the rest of us need to get involved?

The more efficient killers will eventually eliminate each other and the rest of us can get on
with living worthwhile lives.10 The very fact that some feminists feel impelled to prove
themselves in these areas of male dominance gives undue importance to these crude values,
and thereby negates one of the main services that spiritual feminism can render the human
race: feminizing and refining the values of humanity as a whole.

Thus, when ‘Abdu’l–Bahá says, for example, that "there are certain matters, the
participation in which is not worthy of women,"11 He clearly does not mean that women are
incapable of doing these unworthy things. He says rather that because of women's greater
sensitivity to human suffering (which is, in fact, one of the superiorities of women over
men), it is socially destructive to subject women to certain experiences:

. . . woman has been denied the opportunities which man has so long enjoyed. . . .

But even this is not always a shortcoming. Shall we consider it an imperfection and
weakness in her nature that she is not proficient in the school of military tactics, that she

cannot go forth to the field of battle and kill . . .? Nay, rather, is it       not        a
compliment when we say that in hardness of heart and             cruetly she is inferior to man? . .
. Is this to be considered a fault      and lack of qualification as man's equal? Yet be it
known that if woman had been taught and trained in the military science of               slaughter,
she would have been the equivalent of man even in                this accomplishment. But God
forbid! May woman never attain          this proficiency; may she never wield weapons of war,
for the destruction of humanity is not a glorious achievement. . . . Let         not a man glory in
this, that he can kill his fellow creatures; nay        rather let him glory in this, that he can
love them.12

. . . it is the duty of men to organize and execute such defensive measures and not
the women __ because their hearts are tender          and they cannot endure the sight of the
horror of carnage, even          if it is for the sake of defence. From such and similar

undertakings the women are exempt.13

Clearly, these passages do not imply that because women are exempt from certain tasks,
such as warfare, they must then compensate or reciprocate by withdrawing from political or
social life. For ‘Abdu’l–Bahá says clearly: "If given the same educational opportunities or

course of study, [women] would develop the same capacity and abilites [as men] . . .
whether in scientific research, political ability or any other sphere of human activity."14
The point is that there are certain areas of activity where it is not worth the effort for women
to go through the contorsions of acquiring the same ability as men. Thus secular feminism,
because it lacks adquate spiritual underpinnings, has in some instances fallen prey to the
unspoken imperative that everything that can be done must in fact be done. Spiritually-
based feminism, because it has knowledge of the preexisting condition of absolute human
equality, has greater self-assurance and autonomy. It is not so driven by outer perceptions
and is free to choose to concentrate on those areas of development which truly serve the
cause of women and of humanity.

Confronting the History of Patriarchy

Another significant difference between secular and spiritually-based feminism arises
when one confronts the following question: given the fact that men have dominated women
in history, what of our collective cultural heritage should be changed or discarded, and what
should be conserved?

Many secular feminists have come to the conclusion that all the cultural products of
our history are hopelessly infected with "patriarchy" and must be discarded. From this point
of view, everything in our history __ be it logic, science, religion, or art __ is a tool for the
continued oppression of women, because these cultural products were produced by societies
in which women were oppressed (the presumption being that these cultural products fatally
contain oppressive elements).

This 'scorched earth' view of history discounts the fact that science, literature, music,
and art were all products of the human spirit __ the very same human spirit which
constitutes the essential identity of both women and men. Patriarchy or male dominance
was a product of what differentiates men from women __ the greater physical strength and
aggressiveness of males __ but the higher-order cultural products of history were clearly the
products of the universal human spirit. Indeed, the very refinement of these higher-order
products of human culture precludes their production by something so crude as male
aggression and physical force. Thus, from the point of view of spiritually-based feminism,
women can and should feel just as much a sense of ownership of culture as do men.

Thus, the secular feminist view that our human cultural heritage is a product of
patriarchy rather than our common humanity is an ideological interpretation of the facts of
history. Even a cursory view of much feminist literature on this subject shows that very
rarely, if ever, are logical links made between charges of patriarchy and a given cultural
product. Rather, once any evidence of male bias is found in a society (a very easy thing to
do, given our history), all cultural products of that society are held to be hoplessly infected
with such biases. Let us cite an example from the author's own field of expertise,
mathematics.

The secular feminist Sandra Harding has written extensively on the male bias she
feels is to be found in science. In a particularly virulent passage, she stigmatizes Newton's
Principia as "Newton's rape manual."15 The implicit reference is to the notorious statement
of Bacon about torturing the secrets out of nature. Bacon, in turn, was referring to the
nascent experimental method. Harding's argument is that Bacon's torture/rape metaphor
applies to all of science and thus to Newton.

In fact, if one reads Newton's Principia (probably the greatest single work of
science ever written), it is immediately clear that Harding's rape metaphor is totally
nonapplicable and in fact ludicrous. Indeed, what Newton shows is that by means of a few
elegant, subtle, and well-formulated axioms and principles, one can accede to certain basic
structures of reality through pure logic, with hardly any need for recourse to observation,
much less experimentation. For example, based on Newton's theory, a few simple
calculations enable us to place a communications satellite in a fixed position with respect to
the earth's rotation. Thus Newton showed us how it is possible by pure thought to gain
maximum knowlege of reality from a minimum of experimental fuss.

As for literature and the arts, these cultural products can clearly be judged on their
own merits, regardless of whether the human spirit that produced them happened to be in a
male body. How indeed could the lyricism of Tchaikowsky's Serenade for Strings, the
ethereal joy of Bach's B-Minor Mass, or the noble simplicity of Beethoven's Ode to Joy be
reasonably held to be the product of male aggressiveness or oppressive patriarchy
(regardless of whatever failures or limitations these artists had as individual human beings)?

The recognition that the higher-order products of human culture were creations of
the generic human spirit cannot, however, compensate for or justify the tremendous loss to
our history of what exceptionally creative women could have produced but were prevented
by contrived circumstances from doing. Indeed, given the well-established fact that
exceptional creativity is normally distributed and that half of humanity has always been
female, the sytematic denial of equal education for women amounts to the suppression of
roughly half of all the exceptionally creative human spirits in history. How, then, can we
ever measure what we have lost forever as a result of the historical persistence of
patriarchy? Just as women should feel an equal sense of cultural ownership as men, men
should feel the loss of female creativity to history just as keenly as (if not more than) do
women.16

The Psychosexual Basis of Male Dominance

Although there clearly have been cultural differences in the social expression of
male dominance in history, it is nevertheless the case that such male dominance has existed
to various degrees in virtually all cultures and at all epochs. This ubiquity and persistence of
male dominace suggests that it must have a transcultural origin or basis. Indeed, why is it
that males have felt it necessary to suppress woman or deny them equal opportunities of
education and cultural advancement?

The historical persistence of social strategies of male dominance suggests strongly
that men have intuitively known all along that women were their equals. If not, then why
would such strategies even be necessary in the first place? Male chauvinists have justified
these strategies in the name of female inferiority, but if males truly believed females to be
incapable by nature of educational attainment, there would be no reason to deny them
access to education. Thus, the history of gender relations suggests that some deep form of
male insecurity is the root cause of male chauvinism. Let us examine this thesis more
closely.

One universal and transcultural fact is that every man was born and in most cases
nurtured by his mother (or a female care-giver). Thus, the initial experience of every human
life is an experience of total vulnerability and dependence on a woman. The infant knows
intuitively that his or her survival depends on the continued good will of the mother figure,

for if she rejects the infant and refuses to care for it, the infant will die. Thus, the initial
configuration of every human life is one in which rejection by the mother figure is
tantamount to death or nonexistence.

Now of course, the female child is just as vulnerable to maternal rejection as the
male child, but there is nevertheless a fundamental difference in the maternal relationship
between male and female children. This derives from the fact that the female child shares
with the mother not only the generic, preexisting humanity, but her sexual differentiation as
well. The female child is complicit with the mother, one with the mother, whereas the male
child is, to a certain extent, in contrast to the mother.17

Moreover, this initial difference in the relationship with the mother figure is not the
only factor which distinguishes the life experience of males from that of females; there are
also sigificant gender differences in subsequent socialization, in which the male learns that
he must be strong and invulnerable, whereas the female more easily sees herself as needful
and vulnerable. This gender differential in socialization generally allows women more
easily to accept their vulnerabilities and to have more realistic expectations than males
about issues of power and control. This greater self-acceptance allows women to deal more
constructively with their vulnerabilities __ by building appropriate support mechanism
through friendships and truly reciprocal relationships. The male, howerer, will have great
difficulty in accepting the fact of his vulnerability and thus of dealing with it in a
constructive manner. This denial (or even repudiation) of self-vulnerability tends to make
male friendships more competitive and less supportive. It also gives males unrealistic
expectations about power and control.

It thus seems clear that every man will have the primal memory of the initial period
of his existence when rejection by a woman meant death, and that the impact of this
memory will be amplified by the degree to which his socially-induced self-image leads him
to resist recognizing any "weaknesses" in himself. In particular, he will consider any need
for or dependency on a woman as a sign of extreme weakness, entailing as it does the
recognition of his essential vulnerability. Could it not be, then, that the essential male
vulnerability, the fundamental male insecurity, is the visceral fear of rejection by a woman?

Of course, the emotionally autonomous, adult male is fully capable of realizing that
he is no longer in this positiion of childlike vulnerability and that he can endure female
rejection without being destroyed by it. But then just how many emotionally autonomous
adult males do you actually know? Chances are not very many. Moreover, in order to
overcome his dread of female rejection, the male must first face squarely the fact that he has
it, and this self-knowledge is very damaging to the male ego and hence easily repressed or
denied.

It seems likely then, that strategies of male dominance represent the principle of
least effort in solving this problem. Men have simply used their one point of superiority ___
their greater physical strength ___ to restrict the freedom of females and control their lives
so as to deny them the possibility of rejecting the male. All of the restrictions and controls
on the lives of women were designed to place the woman in a situation where the wife, for
example, could not reject her husband, or at least could not do so without extremely grave
social consequences. Male chauvinism is a massive defense mechanism against
acknowledging a fundamental male vulnerability.

Of course, no exercise of physical power can actually prevent rejection, but it can
make the social price of engaging in rejecting behaviour so high that few will dare exhibit
it. However, the man also pays a high price for this strategy, because now he is forever
uncertain as to whether the loyal behaviour of his wife represents a free choice on her
behalf, or only her capitulation to the reality of her social situation.

"Do you really love me?" the husband asks his wife. She replies: "I bear and raise
your children, make your meals. keeep your house, pick up your clothes, and endure your
constant preoccuptation with such trivia as professional sports. What other proof do you
want?" But what he wants is the one proof he cannot have: that his wife truly had the
opportunity to do something else with her life and freely chose, in full knowledge of the
consequences, to serve him instead. Deep down, he knows that no rational human being
would make such a choice.

Thus, the male fear of and resistence to female independence derives from the deep
realization that a truly autonomous female is totally free to reject him and indeed may well
do so. In fact, the most chauvinist males are those who seem to have the least tolerance for
any degree of female independence. Clearly they interpret such independence as tantamount
to rejection itself: if she is free to reject me, then she will inevitably reject me, so he feels.
Thus, the instant the wife asserts any degree of independence, it as if she has rejected him
already.

Moreover, the very strategies of control and domination that males have deployed to
forestall or prevent rejecting behavior on the part of females are totally self-defeating.
Indeed, such strategies serve only to sabotage the authentic elements of gender relationships
and can actually produce the very result the man so fears. Thus, in their relationships with
women, men have a simple and fundamental choice: on the one hand to renounce strategies
of power and control and to pursue a reciprocal relationship based on mutual respect and
mutual free choice; or, on the other hand, to pursue various control strategies, both gross
and subtle, thereby continuing to undermine the basis for a mutually satisfying relationship.

It is also worth noting that the differential history of males and females, although
rooted in injustice, has nonetheless developed to a very high degree certain positive
capacities in women: an emotional stamina, a capacity for sustained intimacy, and for
endurance. By choosing strategies of dominance over strategies of loving cooperation and
mutuality, men are depriving themselves of what they can learn from women and thus
sabotaging their own well-being and personal development.

‘Abdu’l–Bahá has said that man will be free only when woman is free. Man will be
free of his fear of rejection only when he clearly sees that woman is free to reject him but
has freely chosen not to do so. It is only by relinquishing his dependency on strategies of
dominance that man can be certain that the woman's love is freely given and in no wise
coerced.

We close this article with the following short poem (authored by the present writer)
which attempts to give voice to the self-defeating and self-destructive nature of male
dominance behavior.

Women Everywhere

These sisters mothers daughters lovers are everywhere
Surrounding us with softness nurture compassion nuance
Subtle sensual spiritual space in which we can truly live.

My brothers, why do we violate desecrate suppress
Destroy torture maim veil mutilate amputate this precious presence?
Why must we drown its soft wisdom with beastly barking?

Do you not fear that you lose yourself, your very soul?
Can you not feel the loss as each potent part of you
Withers atrophies numbs dies, leaves your cold hard shell of
Ego to its lonely self-imposed exile?

While there is still time---may there still be time! ---
Let us stop this slaughter of life itself which
Receives meagre germ of our sex and returns us beauty incarnate.
