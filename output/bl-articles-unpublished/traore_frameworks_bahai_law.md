Introduction
In the American psyche, the illustration of a nine-member council would tend to invoke an
image of the United States Supreme Court.1 Mention that such a council is inviolable2 and
of international stature might suggest that global politics has surpassed the current “anarchic
system of states”3 to achieve something futuristic and idealistic, beyond the limited sovereignty
of the United Nations.4

Posit a globally democratically elected decision-making body tasked to legislate in the pursuit
of upholding “unity in diversity,”5 justice,6 and peace.7 Assume that it is a constitutionally
sanctioned supreme body that sits above all nations and principalities, whose constituency is
spread across the globe and permeates national borders.8 Presume that the entity is authorized to
prescribe directives, enforce and interpret its own pronouncements, and protect the most central
and sacred texts which establish its authority.9 Assume as fact that the body has the capacity
to amend and repeal laws to accommodate progressive stages of human evolution.10 Arguably,
the preceding illustration begins to resemble a legal framework akin to a governance structure
at the international level, a body with sovereignty over all constituent nation-states.

Notwithstanding the seemingly utopic principles set forth in the description above, the
illustration is not the result of fabrication, but rather a loose description of the main legal organ
of the Bahá’í Faith as described by the International Web Site of the Bahá’ís of the World.11

Frameworks of Bahá’í and Islamic Law Within and Beyond the Nation-State

History of the Bahá’í Faith
Essential to conceptualizing Bahá’í law as an independent body of law is an understanding of
the historical context to which the Bahá’í Faith was born and the evolution of the Faith since
its genesis on May 23, 1844, marking the Declaration of the Báb.13 Bahá’u’lláh, the Faith’s
venerated Prophet, founded the relatively young religion in Persia, present day Iran.14 The Báb
preceded the Founder15 and announced the arrival of Bahá'u'lláh, the next messenger in the line
of prophets to arrive after Muhammad, the figurehead of Islam and deliverer of the Qur’an.16
The historical setting and emergence of the Bahá’í Faith, subsequent to the development of
Islam, is of monumental importance to the present Bahá’í legal structure, as it relates to Islamic
law (shari’a).17

Principles of the Bahá’í Faith
Distinguishing the Bahá’í Faith from most other religions is its recognition of other faiths’
teachings and prophets.18 Bahá’ís recognize the prophets of other religions, including Judaism,
Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Zoroastrianism19.20 The prophets, spread across
various religions are seen in the Bahá’í Faith as Manifestations of the same God.21 Acceptance
of multiple teachings, sometimes seemingly contradictory doctrines, is central to the Bahá’í
belief that manifestations are made in accordance with the development and evolution of
society.22 The fundamental premise is that the teachings of the prophets are not in conflict,
because each prophet made revelations proper to the age of his ministry, thus a religious
prohibition at one period in human evolution might not be necessary upon society’s attainment
of a certain level of maturation.23 Consequently, Bahá'u'lláh has ushered humanity into the
present age and Bahá’ís believe that we are presently awaiting the next divine revelation, to

come during the next stage of human evolution.24 As will be revealed in subsequent sections
of this essay,25 the concept of progressive manifestations is the basis for some of the Bahá’í
Universal House of Justices’ constitutionally conferred powers, as stated in the Constitution of
the Universal House of Justice.26

The aggregation of many faiths into one, to form a continuum of divine evolution, is also
the foundation for the Bahá’í principle of human unification.27 Achieving global unity and
appreciation for diversity is the innermost credo of the Bahá’í Faith.28 It is believed that such
unity will put asunder barriers to human cooperation and lead to the emergence of the human
nation, a nation transcending all other national identities.29 From the Bahá’í perspective, the
development of the “human family” and a unified human race necessitates local, national, and
international legal organs to implement the laws by which such a family will have to abide in
order to ensure the emergence of world peace.30

Evolution of the Bahá’í Faith

Three main persons contributed to the growth of Bahá’í law and the legal order through which
it is administered.31 There is no equivalent to the Jewish Tannak, the Christian Bible, or
the Muslim Qur’an in the Bahá’í Faith, because the foundational documents have not been
reduced to one book.32 Bahá'u'lláh himself delivered the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, “The Most Holy
Book,” prescribing a code of laws similar to, yet operatively different from, Muslim shari’a.33
The Kitáb-i-Aqdas is the primary source of Bahá’í law covering personal status, i.e. penal
law, family law, and inheritance law.34 Bahá'u'lláh was succeeded by his son, Abdu’l-Bahá,
who was designated as the sole authority that could interpret the writings of Bahá'u'lláh.35
The Guardian, successor to the leadership of the Faith, provided the framework for the

\[24\] See Schaefer, supra note 6, at 323 (“[D]ivine law can be valid only until such time as God confirms or repeals the law He had previously
promulgated—which man is not authorized to change—through a new revelation. Since Bahá’u’lláh has excluded the possibility that such a
revelation will take place before the passing of a thousand years the ius divinum of the Baha’is is valid for at least one millennium.”).

establishment of the legal and spiritual institutions to implement Bahá'u'lláh’ s Covenant36.37
Shoghi Effendi, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s grandson, became the Guardian of the Faith.38 The entrustment
of the Guardianship in a single person would terminate as early as it started;39 Shoghi Effendi’s
passing without issue obviated the succession to the Guardianship by primogeniture.40 In the
absence of a Guardian, The Bahá’í International Teaching Centre and the Continental Boards
of Counsellors have taken over as the protectors of the Sacred Writings.41

Legal and Institutional Concretization

It would seem that Shoghi Effendi’s passing might bring sectarian division in the Faith,
but the Founder’s foresight made provisions to prevent such an occurrence.42 Bahá'u'lláh’s
writings prescribed the creation of an administrative system, the establishment of which
became the principal goal of Shoghi Effendi’s guidance of the Faith.43 Accordingly, the Bahá’í
Administrative Order was founded around two pillars, the Guardian and the Universal House of
Justice.44 As a consequence of the termination of the line of primogeniture at Shoghi Effendi’s
death, no person was able to fill the office of the Guardian and the leadership of the Faith vested
in the Universal House of Justice.45

The distinguishing characteristic between the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice
is that the former was intended to be backward looking and the latter is forward looking.46 To

\[36\] See 'Abdu'l-Bahá: the Center of the Covenant, supra note 35 (“A Covenant implies a solemn agreement between two parties. As already
noted, Bahá'u'lláh's part of His Covenant is to bring us teachings that transform both the inner and outer conditions of life on earth, to provide
us with an authoritative interpreter to keep us from misunderstanding God's will for us, and to give us guidance to establish institutions that
will pursue the goals of the achievement of unity. Bahá'u'lláh's Covenant affects us at all levels of existence, from our social organizations
to our individual lives.”).

institutions.”). See generally Effendi, supra note 34, at 57-149.

Testament … appointed His eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, as Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith and also referred to the future election of the
Universal House of Justice.”). It should also be noted that after Abdu’l-Bahá’s death, Bahiyyih Khanum, his sister, temporarily occupied
the office of the Guardian, affording Shogi Effendi the time to take leave to prepare for the task ahead. See Early Bahá’í Heroines, http://

\[39\] See Schaefer, supra note 6, at 351-53. At the passing of the Guarding, who was the President of the International Bahá’í Council, leadership
temporarily passed to the Custodians who were the living “Hands of the Cause.” They maintained stability of the Faith until the election of the
Universal House of Justice in 1963. The development of the International Teaching Centre and the Continental Boards of Counsellors followed
some time after the election of the House of Justice. See generally Custodians, http://bahaikipedia.org/Custodians (last visited Sep. 16, 2011).

of Justice has not perceived any possibility of appointing a successor. Owing to the permanent vacancy of the Guardianship, the community
no longer has an authoritative teaching office. Binding interpretation of the scripture therefore ended with the death of Shoghi Effendi. Since
the ‘Hands of the Cause of God’ (Ayadi i-amru'llah) --who, according to the testament of ‘Abdu'l-Baha were to have been subordinate to
the Guardian-- could no longer be appointed and guided by him, the Universal House of Justice created new institutions to fulfill most of
the functions of the ‘Hands’ in 1968, these functions being primarily the protection and proclamation of the Faith. These institutions are the
International Teaching Centre in Haifa and the Continental Boards of Counsellors.”).

clarify, the Guardianship was instilled with the power to protect the foundational documents
of the Faith, those authored by Bahá'u'lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, from erosion and incorrect
reinterpretation.47 Before its disappearance, the Guardianship retained the capacity to interpret
already established law.48 The Universal House of Justice, on the other hand, remains the
lawmaking body with the competence to legislate with respect to the future of the Bahá’í
Faith and interpret those laws that it promulgates.49 The purpose of the Universal House of
Justice correlates directly with the aforementioned principle of progressive manifestation and
the idea that the Faith must be adaptable to society’s evolution over time.50 The Universal
House of Justice is the head of the tripartite Administrative Order.51 The two remaining arms,
the National and Local Spiritual Assemblies feed directly into the Universal House of Justice.52
Although the national and local bodies are currently referred to as Assemblies, the foundational
documents indicate they will one day be of the same legally prescriptive character as the
Universal House of Justice.53

Reviewing the illustration given in the introduction, a transposition of the administrative order
of the Bahá’í Faith, out of the religious context upon which it was founded, reveals a state
governance structure analogous to that of a supranational entity like the European Union.54
The sections below evaluate the Bahá’í Faith in the context of a legally rooted governance
structure and consider the sovereignty of a non-state entity (The Bahá’í Faith) acting as a state

Analysis: Non-state Governance Modeled After
State-based Governance
Udo Schaefer56 and Roshan Danesh57 are the two Bahá’í scholars cited herein who have written
about Bahá’í law, but it is important to differentiate their respective articles from the aims of
this exercise. Schaefer’s study is the first scholarly overview of the Bahá’í legal order.58 His
article highlights the sources of personal status laws59 and the laws establishing the governance
structure of the Bahá’í Administrative Order.60 Danesh’s article investigates the correlation
between church and state and concludes that the writings of the Bahá’í Faith are inconclusive on
how such a relationship should be managed.61 Furthermore, Danesh resolves that an epistemic
vision of church-state relations should be adopted, wherein integration of religion and the state
may be attained in the future, when society achieves the prerequisite level of “maturation.”62
This thesis proposes to explore how the Bahá’í Faith establishes a self-referencing63 and
functionally differentiated64 legal system unlike the world’s other independent religions. The
aim is to identify how the administrative framework through which the Bahá’í legal order
operates differs from that of other faiths, focusing primarily on Islam, the religion often assumed
to have influenced the development of the Bahá’í Faith.65 Lastly, this exercise focuses on how
the centralized Administrative Order avoids fragmentation and ensures continuity of the Bahá’í
legal system, but the essay also questions the validity of Bahá’í law by raising the various
barriers to enforcement.66

To prevent excessive repetition of the work already done by various scholars, whose work is
fundamental in understanding this exercise, this essay will focus primarily on the administrative
law of the Bahá’í Faith, the conferral of competence on the Universal House of Justice and

example, in a typical statement of this idea by the Universal House of Justice, the Bahá'í Faith views [t]he human race, as a distinct, organic
unit, [which] has passed through evolutionary stages analogous to the stages of infancy and childhood in the lives of its individual members,
and is now in the culminating period of its turbulent adolescence approaching its long-awaited coming of age. This vision of social maturation
rests upon the idea of unity, which is the axis of Bahá'í ontology.”).

The Constitution of the Universal House of Justice: Prescribing
a Progressive and Living Body
After a cursory look at the Constitution of the Universal House of Justice, it becomes apparent
that it describes a legal system that bears an uncanny resemblance to the American legal
order, as described in the United States (U.S.) Constitution.70 Taking into consideration that
the Constitution of the House was ratified in 1972, centuries after the American Constitution,
one might be led to believe that the intertextuality71 between the two documents is the result
of American influence.72 In reality, there is no such intertextuality between the documents,
because the Bahá´í Faith is a new creation, not meant to imitate any existing modes of
thought. Furthermore, its governance mechanisms are based on a divinely inspired model
meant to surpass existing governance systems in effectiveness. The Bahá’í legal order is a
model of non-state-centered constitutionalism, and the Constitution of the United States is a
representation of state-based constitutionalism; a comparison of the two merely serves to relate
the Constitution of the Universal House of Justice with a document that many are familiar
with. The juxtaposition is especially telling of how a non-state entity begins to employ various
governance apparatuses in constituting itself to resemble the state.73

The Constitution of the Universal House of Justice is subdivided into multiple sections, of which
the first is the “Declaration of Trust,” enumerating (1) the powers vested in the House, (2) its
governing authority with respect to other Bahá’í institutions, and (3) its responsibilities.74

Conferral of Competence: The “Declaration of Trust”

The Constitution begins with an appeal to the function that Bahá’u’llah served in the
establishment of the Faith and His consequent role in the founding of the House of Justice.75 The

document specifically names him as the ordainer76 of both the Administrative Order and the
substantive laws by which the Faith operates.77 The Universal House of Justice is described as
a continuation of God’s Covenant with man, a covenant ensuring continued divine guidance.78
Having ordained authority, the Universal House of Justice’s defining facet is the maintenance of
unity in the human race.79 Despite the intended evolutionary character of the Faith, as described
above, the text renders the “unity of the human race” the “immovable foundation” upon which
the Faith and the House are built.80 Despite the civil nature of the Constitution as a whole, the
first paragraph serves as a guiding principle and a reminder that the Constitution is first rooted
in its divine purposes.81

Making only periodic references to the Divine, the document proceeds by laying out the
seemingly laic purposes of the Universal House of Justice.82 Exclusive competence is conferred
upon the House, because it is designated as the sole arm of the Faith with the ability to
illuminate the Sacred Texts.83 The clause granting the House such broad power seems modeled
after the American understanding that a national government within the federal structure must
be supreme, as evidenced by the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause.84 The text of the
Constitution explicitly states that the Universal House of Justice is the supreme body that sits
atop all other institutions and individuals in the Faith.85 The additional caveat that the House’s
authority will remain unchanged unless amended by a future Manifestation of God conveys the
impression that the body is inviolable.86

The House is vested with all three primary functions of governance: executive, legislative, and
judicial. Entrusted with the right to promulgate statutes not sanctioned by the Sacred Texts,
the Universal House of Justice ensures the continuity of the Faith through the ages.87 Such
legislative authority operates in tandem with executive competence to protect individual rights
granted through the founding documents and the House’s own enactments.88 Furthermore,

extensive executive power affords the House the ability to expand the scope of governance
by adding institutions to the Administrative Order.89 Primary among its judicial faculties is
its trusteeship as protector of the founding documents - the House is meant to “safeguard
their inviolability.”90 Essentially, the House does not have license to reinterpret the founding
documents, but it may settle “all problems that have caused difference[s]” with regard to the
meaning of laws that it has itself enacted.91 Such a limitation on the interpretation of the sacred
documents is by design and is prescribed in anticipation of a future Manifestation that may alter
the meaning of the foundational documents.92 Further, the Constitution seems suggestive of the
House’s adjudicative and arbitrative capacity in personal disputes, and its ability to establish
and enforce sanctions for transgressions of Bahá’í law.93

An additional operative clause in the Constitution seems to establish a system of checks
and balances, but as opposed to the U.S. Constitution, the ambiguity of the House’s
Constitution’s language makes it unclear how such a system would operate.94 Unlike the
American government’s tripartite institutional structure (the legislative,95 the executive,96
and the judicial97 branches), in the Bahá’í governance system, the three functions are all
vested in one authority, thus making it inconceivable for such a collective to ‘check’ itself.98
Consequently, it seems such oversight is only conferred upon the House with regard to
subordinate bodies; nevertheless, it seems that the Bahá’í notion of decision-making through
“Consultation” may itself be an alternative that ensures transparency and accountability in
governance.99

The spending clause that is incorporated into the Constitution of the House is vague and unlike
the U.S. Constitution’s Taxing and Spending Clause;100 it generally endows the Universal
House of Justice with the right to manage funds, endowments, and properties at Its disposal,
but it makes no mention about the direct acquisition of such materials.101 Collections from

Huqúqu'lláh, a nineteen percent tax that Bahá’ís pay voluntarily on any non-essentials, might
fund certain operations within the Faith, but the voluntary nature of the tax and the absence
of elaborative language in Constitution of the House elucidate some of the limitations on the
House; it would appear that the House has not been ordained with the power to authoritatively
mandate the payment of taxes as would be expected in state-based governance.102

As the Universal House of Justice is a supranational entity, some of Its conferred powers deal
directly with the relations between nations.103 Specifically, it is entrusted with ensuring comity
and cordiality between the ‘nations’ and establishing law and order in the world.104 Again, the
language is unclear as to the concerned states; there is no indication of whether the reference is to
the nations as devised in the traditionally recognized international system105 or if it is a reference
to the interaction amongst the Bahá’í Faith’s National Spiritual Assemblies.106 Nevertheless,
given the aims of the Faith to transcend national borders and achieve “universal peace,”107 it
would be appropriate to conclude that the reference is to relations among the sovereign nation-
states, rather than interaction between National Spiritual Assemblies.108

In concluding the section on the conferred powers, the Constitution of the Universal House
of Justice establishes the Bahá’í nation and the constituency of the House as the “people of
Bahá.”109 Conversely, the members of the Universal House of Justice are identified as “Men of
Justice,”110 once again very reminiscent of the structure and functions of the American Supreme
Court and the use of the term ‘justice’ to designate a Supreme Court judge in the American
legal system.111 Additionally, the charge bestowed on the members of the Universal House of
Justice is one of complete impartiality.112 As the life term of U.S. Supreme Court Justices is
intended to prevent the Justices from being influenced by majoritarian politics, the Constitution
of the House makes the Men of Justice accountable to their conscience and their duty to carry
out the prescriptions of the Sacred Texts, rather than the present and temporal convictions of

constitutions understood the need for a politically divorced judiciary.114

Procedural Laws: “By-Laws” of the Constitution of the Universal House of Justice

The ‘By-Laws’ of the Constitution of the Universal House of Justice may potentially be more
telling than the Declaration of Trust about the logistical operation of a non-state entity that
assumes the identify of a state.115 The Preamble describes the Bahá’í administrative system and
posits the continued expansion of the system.116 The Constitution foresees the establishment of
“auxiliary branches and … subordinate agencies.”117 The language alludes to the appointment
of executive and administrative bodies, potentially analogous to American federal agencies.118

Expanding on the description of the people of Bahá the ‘By-Laws’119 discuss qualifications
for membership in the Bahá’í Community.120 Much like the Twenty-Sixth Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution,121 attaining the appropriate age is a condition precedent to the privilege of
voting.122 The Constitution of the House of Justice makes voting incumbent on attainment of
age twenty-one, unlike the American voting age of eighteen.123

The ‘By-Laws’ also give a description of the two levels of governance leading up to
the Universal House of Justice, namely the Local and National Spiritual Assemblies.124
Reinforcing notions of intertextuality with the U.S. Constitution,125 both types of assemblies,
like the Universal House of Justice, have nine members.126 Nevertheless, in stark contrast to
the Supreme Court, members of all Spiritual Assemblies and the House are democratically
elected.127

Per the House’s Constitution, a Local Spiritual Assembly must form where more than nine
twenty-one year-old Bahá’ís reside within a common area; the members are elected through

\[113\] See id. (“[T]he members of the Universal House of Justice, it should be borne in mind, are not, as Bahá'u'lláh's utterances clearly imply,
responsible to those whom they represent, nor are they allowed to be governed by the feelings, the general opinion, and even the convictions
of the mass of the faithful, or of those who directly elect them. They are to follow, in a prayerful attitude, the dictates and promptings of their
conscience. They may, indeed they must, acquaint themselves with the conditions prevailing among the community, must weigh dispassionately
in their minds the merits of any case presented for their consideration, but must reserve for themselves the right of an unfettered decision.”).

a direct democratic vote of the local members.128 A National Spiritual Assembly, on the
other hand, forms at the prompting of the Universal House of Justice and delegates from the
Local Spiritual Assemblies of the respective country elect members of the National Spiritual
Assembly.129 Each form of Spiritual Assembly has jurisdiction over its local matters and has
its own constitution.130 Furthermore, National Spiritual Assemblies represent their constituents
before the Universal House of Justice, a structure perhaps resembling the United Nations
General Assembly.131 Similarly to many state-centered or nation-centered political systems,
the three-part governing structure devised in the by-Laws depicts a federal system akin the
American federal structure.132

The democratic nature of Bahá’í institutions is entrenched in the ‘By-Laws’ which task Spiritual
Assemblies with carrying out their mandates without “dictatorial assertiveness” and while
maintaining the utmost open discourse.133 Perhaps the only seemingly non-democratic aspect
of the prescribed structure is the fact that women are not to be elected to the Universal House of
Justice – some would say this is in apparent derogation of the progressive nature of the Faith,
but such a contention may be dispelled by the fact that a future Manifestation may grant women
the right to serve as members of the House of Justice.134

Further resembling a democratic republic like to the U.S., the election system of the House
is emblematic of a delegate-based representative democracy like the American Electoral
College, as described in the Twelfth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.135 National Spiritual
Assemblies send delegates to the International Bahá’í Convention, where the members of the
House of Justice are elected, every five years.136

The House permits impeachment and removal of members of the Universal House of Justice
for moral or sinful obstruction of community principles, similar to the American requirement
that judges only maintain their “[o]ffices during good Behavior.”137 A member of the House
may also be removed pursuant to a determination that he can no longer fulfill the functions of
his office.138 Voluntary relinquishment of office is not permitted without the prior approval of
the House.139

As the Universal House of Justice does not have a hierarchy, all members are assumed to occupy
the same position; there is no equivalent of an American Chief Justice.140 To further engrain
the equality of members of the House, all members have signatory authority on behalf of the
whole, where the entire House gives prior approval.141 Furthermore, like the Supreme Court of
the United States, the Universal House of Justice’s decisions must be made by a majority, in
the presence of the full membership or where quorum has been met.142

As the U.S. Supreme Court is the last recourse in review of national constitutional matters
in the United States, the Universal House of Justice has the exclusive competence of judicial
review.143 The Universal House of Justice’s power, in this regard, is much broader than
that of the U.S. Supreme Court, because it has the ability to review the decisions of lower
Assemblies sua sponte.144 Further, with regard to judicial appeals, the higher courts (the House
of Justice and the National Assemblies) have discretion on whether to accept cases from Local
Assemblies.145 Much like the U.S. Supreme Court, the Universal House of Justice and the
National Spiritual Assemblies have discretion in deciding whether a case is worthy of their
attention.146 An appellant must submit his appeal request to the court hearing his case in order
to obtain reconsideration or an appeal.147 Where the Assembly does not address the appeal
in a timely manner or refuses to address it, the appellant may directly petition the higher
authority.148 Similarly to the American Constitution’s notion of subject-matter jurisdiction,149
cases arising between two different governing bodies must be addressed by the higher authority,

The analysis of the judicial functions of the Universal House of Justice makes evident the
reasons for this extensive comparison of the American legal order to that of the Bahá’í Universal
House of Justice. The juxtaposition of the two establishes the framework of analysis for
the remainder of the essay by contextualizing the Universal House of Justice as a state-like
alternative to state-based governance.151 Furthermore, the comparison reveals the democratic
character that the Bahá’í Administrative Order espouses.152

Measuring Up to Theories of Non-State Governance
Larry Catá Backer153 and Gunther Teubner,154 two legal scholars, posit that private
transnational legal regulatory systems illustrate the existence of alternatives to state-centered
governance theories.155 Although both scholars primarily employ corporate regulation as the
exemplar of how industry-specific soft law is suggestive of the privatization of governance,
a valid argument can be made that the same framework is applicable to other non-state
governance structures like that of the Bahá’í Faith.156

In his article, titled, Societal Constitutionalism: Alternatives to State-centered Constitutional
Theory,157 Teubner claims that constitutional theory is no longer limited to the nation-state, and
that the aggregation of the various non-state constitutional structures amount to the Constitution
of World Society.158 The non-state governance model presupposes the transformation of objects
of law (civil society organs, corporations, and nongovernmental organizations) into the subjects
of law (the state).159

poor one into the bargain. But this formula is definitely not an abstract normative demand for remote, uncertain futures, but an assertion of a
real trend that can today be observed on a world-wide scale. The thesis is: emergence of a multiplicity of civil constitutions. The constitution
of world society comes about not exclusively in the representative institutions of international politics, nor can it take place in a unitary global
constitution overlying all areas of society, but emerges incrementally in the constitutionalisation of a multiplicity of autonomous subsystems
of world society.”).

The non-state theory puts forth the notion that where communities form,160 they seek to
establish their own rules, both substantive and procedural, for internal regulation.161 Such rules
are generated by, enforced on, and consented to by members of these communities.162 Every
such community or system has certain constitutional norms,163 and Teubner identifies four
features164 that such non-state governance structures must possess: (1) the system must exhibit
structural coupling of legal norms with a social system;165 (2) there must be a hierarchy of
norms, wherein certain norms become incontrovertible law;166 (3) a legal organ within the
system must have the capacity of judicial review;167 and (4) the constitution of the system must
be split between a formally organized sphere and spontaneous, uncontrolled sphere.168

All of Teubner’s factors are applicable to the Bahá’í legal order, perhaps with the exception of
the fourth, because it is arguably irrelevant when applied to religious entities.169 First, structural
coupling between the social system and legal norms is evident, because the Bahá’í Sacred Texts
(the works of Bahá’u’lláh, Àbdu'l-Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi) serve to inform the legal norms
in the Faith.170

Concomitantly, the same Sacred Writings are the foundation for the incontrovertible
“higher”171 law in the Constitution of the Universal House of Justice.172 The notion of
incontrovertible law conveys the understanding that certain laws are formative postulates
of the system, without which the system would cease to exist.173 In the Bahá’í Faith, such
fundamental laws would include: (1) the preservation of “unity in diversity” (establishing one
human race)174 (2) striving towards global peace and justice,175 and (3) upholding the equality
of all mankind,176 to name a few. Essentially, higher law is set forth in the Universal House

of Justice’s Constitution’s Declaration of Trust, and the House’s actions must not counter the
Declaration’s prescriptions.177

The third feature requires the entity to have an established judicial organ with the ability to
repeal laws (judicial review).178 The analysis above established that the Universal House of
Justice is conferred with such authority,179 in its ability to review the decisions of the Local
and National Spiritual Assemblies.180 Judicial review naturally hinges on the existence of some
codified law, thus Teubner and Backer’s theory requires some legal formalism.181 The system
must have its own form of positive law, rather than mere informal pronouncements, which
can be recognized by all members of the community.182 From such legal formalism is born an
autonomous “implementation organ”183 which can establish, modify, and interpret the norms
(laws) of the system.184 Again, as established in the previous section of the essay,185 the Bahá’í
Faith has its own laws, contained in its Sacred Texts.186 Furthermore, the Universal House of
Justice is the “implementation organ” that has legislative ability, and though it may not re-
interpret the Sacred Texts, it is the luminary for anything not addressed by those Texts.187

Lastly, the fourth feature requires that there be a dualism in the system.188 The legal
order must be partly institutionalized and partly spontaneous in character.189 Teubner
provides an example by explaining that in state politics dualism exists, because there is
government administration (the institutionalized part) and the electorate (the spontaneous
part).190 Similarly, in economics, the spontaneity of market sectors counters the more organized
enterprise sectors.191 Nevertheless, it is important to note that campaigning by candidates for
Bahá’í institutional offices is forbidden.192 Additionally, the Bahá’í election system is not
politicized and Bahá’ís are required to abstain from political participation outside the Faith.193

politics.” Bahá'u'lláh taught his believers to avoid partisan politics, a principle that could be interpreted as suggesting quietism and passivism.
But such a rendering is inaccurate, for the issue is not politics itself, but whether engagement in contemporary political processes is an approach

Although one might argue that economics and politics are not really applicable to organized
religious groups, the Bahá’í Faith governance structure does display aspects of dualism.194 The
Universal House of Justice and all the Spiritual Assemblies are evidently representative of the
more institutionalized structure, but since all the Faith’s institutional bodies are elected, the
electorate preserves the element of spontaneity.195

Having evaluated the Bahá’í legal structure, under the guise of Teubner and Backer’s non-
state governance theory, the Bahá’í Faith effectually begins to resemble a private governance
system, set apart from, but mimicking state-based governance systems, as described by Backer:

> The idea, one increasingly accepted among international actors, is that the constitution
> of states is not something unique to states. Instead, any juridicial person might also
> acquire a certain legitimacy as a regulatory entity by mimicking states. “We can observe
> the typical components of a constitution: regulations about the establishment and
> functioning of decision-making processes (organisational and procedural rules), and
> the codification of the boundaries of the organisation in relation to individual freedoms
> and civil liberties (basic rights).”196

Furthermore, the argument can be made that the Bahá’í Faith has acquired far more “legitimacy
as a governance structure”197 than the corporate structures that Teubner and Backer describe,
because it has a far more formalistic structure.198 The Faith has distinguished itself as a non-state
governance structure through sui generis law, coupled with its local, national, and international
legal organization.199

Enforcement Mechanisms

Describing previous efforts to form a global non-state governance structure, above independent
nation-states, Teubner points to the United Nations.200 He characterizes the creation of the
United Nations as a failed attempt to establish “the constitutional law of the ‘international
community’ [to be] put into force by a world sovereign.”201 His main reproach of the United
Nations is undoubtedly the same contention that most scholars would raise as a structural
flaw to the Bahá’í Faith’s governance order.202 Such supranational organizations, even those
that mimic state-based governance, are limited in their sovereignty, and are thus crippled

to social and political change reflective of the principle of unity. For Bahá'u'lláh, there was no value in Bahá'ís assuming positions of political
power within current political systems.”).

in their ability to enforce laws.203 Teubner notes: “Traditional law is based on institutional,
procedural and personal separation of law-making, application and law enforcement. This
is also true to a certain degree for law making in private sectors.”204 The words “to a
certain degree”205 seems to imply that separation of powers and enforcement capacity are
indicia of non-state governance rather than necessary ingredients for the existence of such
systems.206 As previously stated, there is a limited checks and balance system in the Bahá’í
Administrative Order,207 because the Universal House of Justice retains legislative, executive,
judicial authority in the governance structure.208 However, it remains important to discuss
the enforceability of Bahá’í law, because an effective and operative legal system without
enforcement power seems nearly inconceivable.209

Although the Bahá’í Faith might share the United Nations’ challenges in enforcing its laws,
it is important to note that the structural organization of the United Nations and the Bahá’í
governance structure are intrinsically different.210 The Bahá’í framework is closer to that
advanced by Teubner211 because the framework devised in the Constitution of the Universal
House of Justice shares more attributes with a multiple-branch corporation than the United
Nations.212

The United Nations is often referred to as having limited sovereignty, because its sovereignty
derives directly from the authority granted to it by the independent ‘nation-states’213 that
have signed its Charter.214 In contrast, the Bahá’í Faith has many branches, namely its
National and Local Spiritual Assemblies, over which it has direct jurisdiction.215 Although it
is acknowledged that individual nation-states may limit the influence of the Bahá’í Faith by
refusing to recognize the pronouncements of its institutions, the Universal House of Justice,
nonetheless, does not require a grant of authority from a state, i.e., India, in order to arbitrate
cases between individual Bahá’ís or to hear a case involving two countries’ National Spiritual

circumstances, nor re-specifying it carefully enough, but instead uncritically transferring nation-state circumstances to world society. In

Assemblies.216 Contrarily, the United Nations is highly limited in its authority to take positive
action, without the prior approval and monetary support of its Member States.217 Succinctly,
while the United Nation’s constituents are individual sovereign nation-states,218 the Universal
House of Justice’s constituents form one nation: the Bahá’í nation (constituted of the people
of Bahá).219

Understanding of the word ‘nation’220 in the Bahá’í context is more related to the notion of
‘nation-building’221 and divorced from the territorially-linked definition of the same word,
which is more synonymous with the word ‘state.’222 More appropriate to this comparative
exercise is an understanding that the word ‘nation’ is a reference to an aggregate of people
who are united by a common identity, and thus associate together.223 The Bahá’í nation
is an aggregate of persons who share common religious and ideological beliefs, and have
independently agreed to organize themselves into Local and National Spiritual Assemblies,
subject to the jurisdiction of the Universal House of Justice.224

People who belong to the same nation generally have the same interests, because of their shared
characteristics,225 but the same cannot be said of signatories of the United Nations Charter, as
certain signatories have more power than others, i.e., U.N . Security Council members have veto
power which other members of the General Assembly do not enjoy.226 Realist theory227 makes
evident that states are undeniably self-interested, thus making it hard for them to relinquish
sovereignty to a higher power, i.e. the United Nations.228 Essentially, the Universal House

of Justice has created its own matrix, in which its jurisdiction extends over all commonly-
interested Bahá’ís who submit to such jurisdiction, across various state boundaries.229

Issues of sovereignty arise with regard to the fact that submission to the Universal House of
Justice’s jurisdiction seems completely voluntary on the part of individual Bahá’ís.230 Unlike
the nation-state, which has the ability to apply its law to citizens, regardless of whether the
citizen recognizes the authority of the state, the Universal House of Justice appears to have
limited enforcement ability.231 This aspect of sovereignty reveals what the United Nations
and the Universal House of Justice share in common; they do not have the ability to prevent
constituents from deviating from their established laws.232

The Faith is sourced in free will and voluntariness, thus every Bahá’í has the ability to leave the
Faith at his or her own discretion.233 Such a principle seems to work against enforcement of law;
although citizens of independent nation-states may emigrate from their respective countries to
other states, leaving the Faith is far simpler than emigrating from one nation-state to another.234
Furthermore, certain governments have laws that can complicate emigration, especially for
those trying to escape legal proceedings and obligations.235 Coupled with harsher immigration
law in receiving countries, emigration can be a struggle for many prospective immigrants.236
Contrary to the difficulty of emigration, freedom to dissociate oneself from the Faith, with such
facility, is undoubtedly a barrier to enforcement of law in the Bahá’í Faith.237

The Faith’s ability to excommunicate may be its strongest enforcement tool; out of fear of
being excommunicated, Bahá’ís might be compelled to abide by the laws applicable to them.238
The ability to expel those whose actions counter the fundamental norms is the Bahá’í Faith’s
primary method of avoiding “division and sectarianism in the Faith.”239 Disloyal members
are considered to be covenant-breakers, because their actions breach the covenant formed
between mankind and the Divine.240 Though, there is “no legal definition of this offence … it
is clear that only exponents of subversion and sedition are covenant-breakers … only divisive
activities, sectarianism, and attacks on the authority of institution constitute this offence.”241

Excommunication implies a complete exclusion of the covenant-breaker, because any believer
who associates with such a person would be subject to the same punishment.242 Naturally,
such exclusion would mean disenfranchisement of the offender.243 Loss of all rights in the
community is the equivalent of loss of citizenship in any nation-state, thus excommunication
is potentially the most effective legal enforcement practice in the Faith.244

The above serves as evidence that at present enforcement tools are very limited in the Faith,
especially since excommunication could be irrelevant to someone who may already desire to
leave the Faith.245 It is absurd to think that anyone would actively seek exclusion, but those who
may seek to make themselves out to be the equivalent of the Catholic Church’s Copernicus,
may have no such reservations.246 Lack of such enforcement power may appear to invalidate
the effectiveness of Bahá’í laws, but it does nothing to prevent the institutions from mandating
compliance from adherents of the Faith, it merely limits the reach of the legal organs, beyond
the Bahá’í governance network.247

Conclusion: Comparisons with Shari’a and the
Potential for Continuity
As alluded to in previous sections of this essay, the Bahá’í Faith was born under the influence of
Islam.248 Consequently, shari’a serves as a basis of comparison in understanding the potential
for continuity of Bahá’í law.249 Having existed for centuries prior to the Bahá’í Faith,250 it is
comprehensible that Islamic law could serve as a factor in assessing the prospects of continuity
of Bahá’í law.

Much like Bahá’í law, shari’a involves personal status laws and is based on the Sacred Texts
of Islam, namely the Qu’ran and the Sunna.251 Contrarily to the Bahá’í example, some form
of shari´a has been adopted and is legally enforceable in many independent nation-states,
including Iran, Lybia, Sudan, Nigeria, Indonesia, etc.252 Reza Banakar253 and Haider Ala
Hamoudi,254 both legal scholars, have assessed the perceptions of shari’a in their respective
articles.255 Banakar criticizes the common Western approach to analyzing shari’a as a uniform
legal system,256 and Hamoudi furthers Banakar’s argument by showcasing the factors that have
lead to the disintegration of Islamic law and have, in turn, stunted its development as a uniform
legal system.257

Banakar advances the notion that Muslim communities are not “mono-cultural or mono-ethnic,”
thus they cannot have the same laws.258 In the wake of recent terrorism and the unveiling
of Samuel Huntington’s “clash of civilizations”259 paradigm, there is a Western desire to
constitute all Muslim states as having a monolithic legal system that stands in opposition
to Western principles.260 Extremist Muslim groups, in opposition to the West, also favour
this monolithic perception, because they want to reinforce the perceived West-versus-Islam
dichotomy.261 Nevertheless, cultural and social variance in Muslim countries prevents shari’a

from being regarded as a set of laws that is uniformly applied across the various Muslim
states.262 Muslim countries cannot be said to belong to the same “Islamic (legal) culture,”263
because each community’s “interpretations of Islam and religious practices are shaped by
their socio-historical backgrounds and experience.”264 Banakar concludes that because shari’a
is intrinsically tied to culture, we have witnessed its continued fragmentation into many
legal branches throughout history.265 His analysis illustrates, one of the present differences
between Bahá’í law and shari’a.266 Contrary to shari’a, Bahá’í law can be deemed holistically
monolithic, and is expected to remain as such, given the efforts of the Universal House of Justice
to avoid any sectarianism or disunity.267

Hamoudi construes shari’a as not uniform, because of its dependence on state authority and the
ability of every state to decide the extent to which it will apply religious law.268 He characterizes
Islamists (fundamentalists) as opportunistic; they desire the secular state to be subservient to
the religious state, but only when it is beneficial to them.269 Hamoudi notes the emergence of
new exception clauses in many Muslim state constitutions, allowing the state to circumvent
shari’a in certain circumstances.270 He also points to the innate difference between shari’a as
prescribed in the Sacred Texts and the statutory versions that have been promulgated by the
various states.271

In addition to having multiple schools of thought on the interpretation of religious law, there is
no equivalent of the Universal House of Justice in Islam.272 Consequently, there is no central

practices within each so-called ‘civilization.’ It is, admittedly, true that the practices of Sharia have taken inhumane and oppressive forms
in some Islamic states and much of this oppression is directed towards Muslim women. However, it does not mean that all Muslims, or all
Islamic states for that matter, are in favour of such practices.”).

in areas such as corporate law and the law of business entities, where the economic consequences might be dire … Once the law is safely in
the hands of the state, the Islamist need only bring shari’a where he wishes it … and leave all other, largely transplanted, law, where it lies,

of codification would be entirely consistent with adherence to God’s Law. The caliph could then simply enact a code based on his own
understanding of God’s Law, and future enactments and re-enactments of codes under the authority of future Caliphs could be, at least in
theory, as unproblematic as any authoritative religious institution revisiting portions of its own doctrine. Ann Elizabeth Mayer reports that
precisely such a codification was proposed in early Islamic history, and ultimately rejected.”).

bastardization of Islam by extremists and varied applications of shari’a among states.274 The
codified versions of shari’a are essentially a compromise between the secular and religious
interest of Islamists, who want to play both sides of the coin, by limiting religiosity in certain
instances.275 Islamic law judges are now well versed in the language of statutorily enacted forms
of shari’a, as opposed to the forms contained in the Sacred Texts, thus even in personal status
law, where legal systems tended to stray less from the Sacred Texts, judges are more likely
to apply the statutory form.276 Hamoudi further portrays the importation of Western forms of
criminal, constitutional, and financial law into Islamic states as the lead cause for pre-emption
of existing religious law.277 He illustrates the variance in the application of Islamic criminal
law by describing the differences in how judges interpret shari’a in Lybia, Pakistan, Iraq, and
Indonesia.278 Hamoudi effectively concludes “the broad divergence in shari’a adoption across
both subject matter and geographical location in various Muslim states will only increase with
time.”279

All the variations between the statutory enactments of shari’a and the varied interpretations
of the Sacred Texts have all led to the fragmentation of shari’a, so as to prevent it from
being considered a uniform corpus of law.280 Both Banakar and Hamoudi seem to point to a
disintegration of Islamic law, which leads to the question of whether such a fragmented unit
can actually be referred to by one name, “shari’a.”281 Arguably, shari’a is more enforceable
than Bahá’í law, because it has actually been adopted and enforced in various states; meanwhile
Bahá’í law has yet to be adopted by any state.282 Nevertheless, some would argue that the lack
of a central institution to manage the application of shari’a, like the Universal House of Justice
in the Bahá’í Faith, is essentially a death sentence for shari’a.283

Compared to Islamic law, Bahá’í law is still in its stages of infancy,284 but it would seem
that Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu'l-Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi were enlightened enough to foresee

\[274\] See id. at 9-10 (illustrating the alleged bastardization, Hamoudi writes, “[i]n the Anbar, quasi judges used their forms of shari’a to ban,
among other things, the sale of cucumbers and tomatoes together, because of their sexual suggestiveness … shari’a is capable of far more
sophistication than these various absurd applications would ever suggest.”).

as Libya, where a professional judiciary schooled in transplanted law has been left to apply those Islamic crimes that have been codified, there
has been little if any actual enforcement of the criminal codes respecting shari’a … The role of shari’a in the area of criminal law in fact
depends not only on the relative strength of Islamist forces, but also on the relative priorities of their respective selective legislative agendas.
The Islamists of Pakistan, Iran and the Sudan have seemed rather aggressive and broad in their approaches, seeking a prominent role for shari’a
in any number of areas … By comparison, … Iraq’s Islamists … have … comparatively little on their public legislative agenda in terms of
shari’a beyond personal status … Islamist parties in Indonesia probably lie somewhere between these two poles, more committed to aspects
of shari’a than Iraq’s Islamists, but also limited in the amount of shari’a they wish to , or can adopt.”).

the crippling effects of not having a central legal order (the Universal House of Justice)
to administer the Faith.285 They might have foreseen the fragmentation of shari’a,286 and
consequently took preemptive action to avoid the same fate as shari’a. Their preemptive action
resulted in the institution of the Universal House of Justice,287 in tandem with the notion
of progressive manifestation, as a fail-safe.288 Although Bahá’í laws have yet to be adopted
by any state, to date,289 if and when they are adopted by states, the structure of the Bahá’í
Administrative Order will save the Bahá’í legal corpus from facing many of the problems that
have led to the fragmentation of shari’a.290

There is no telling what the future religion-state relationship will look like in states where Bahá’í
law would be adopted, but it appears that the Faith itself postulates the evolution of a Bahá’í
state, where religion and the state would be one and Bahá’í laws would be enforceable.291
Admittedly, such a church-state relationship might seem inconceivable to some, but it must
be acknowledged that the Bahá’í Faith is potentially the world’s most progressive religion,
sharing many secular goals with civil government.292 Showcasing its secular tendencies, the
Bahá’í Faith has no clerics, unlike in Islam293.294 Roshan Danesh postulates that the evolution
of Bahá’í state will come about voluntarily, democratically, and constitutionally.295

Obviously, all religions have a manner of organizing themselves, but the Bahá’í example
presents one of the most adaptable, centralized, and organized systems of religious non-state
administration.296 The word adaptable is appropriate here, because (1) the Universal House of
Justice’s legislative functions ensures the ability of the Faith to confront future social problems,
and (2) the notion of progressive manifestations enables the Faith to guarantee its continuity

of the House of Justice, and as such reforms the classical Islamic scheme. The realm of worship (‘ibádat) is historically drawn within Islamic
law as distinct from the realms of societal relations (mu’ámalát) and politics (siyása). In the classical Sunni Islamic theory, the methods and
rules developed by the ulama control the realms of ‘ibádat and mu’ámalát, thereby lending significant public power to the clerics. Over time the
ulama also developed theoretical justifications for roles in the realm of siyása, though in practice, the ruler exercised some legal (legislative)
power in the realm of siyása.”).

The Universal House of Justice is also a form of legal actor that operates outside of the parameters of the classical Islamic legal theory. In
particular, the Universal House of Justice has an explicit grant of legislative powers. As well, there is no public or legal role for a clerical class
in this scheme, and no authority over the sacramental aspects of religious life.”).

\[295\] See id. at 61-62 (“These principles stress that a movement towards a Bahá'í state is wholly in the hands of the state that wishes to pursue such
a course. The decision by a state and its citizens to adopt the Bahá'í Faith as the State Religion, let alone to the point at which a State would
accept the Law of God as its own law and the National House of Justice as its legislature, must be a supremely voluntary and democratic process.
As a general principle, such a transition would have to occur ‘by constitutional means’ while Bahá'ís still observe principles of abstention from
certain forms of political action, and it would have to be consistent with the core Bahá'í commitments to democracy and human rights.”).

through the various stages of human ideological evolution.297 Despite its ability to adapt,
its centralized governance structure prevents it from becoming as disintegrated as shari’a.298
Furthermore, the Bahá’í aim to deconstruct human differences, and achieve the development
of a common human identity (the notion of the ‘human family’),299 is more in tune with
globalization.300

Although the Faith presupposes becoming an world governance system,301 it is currently
still in a stage of infancy302 where perhaps Teubner’s theory is still applicable; the Bahá’í
Administrative Order is a private governance structure, to be aggregated with other functionally
differentiated systems, thus forming the basis of global constitutionalism.303 Given the
progressive nature of the Bahá’í Faith, and the fact that even its religious aims seem to advance
the interests of many secular international organizations and NGOs,304 it may serve as a
far more influential governance network in the future.305 Religion has been improperly used
in many instances to justify political action at the international level, i.e. the Crusades, the
present extreme jihadist movement, etc.; perhaps the Bahá’í Faith, through non-state private
governance, will achieve the advancement of more positive secular ideals, such as human
rights.306 To conclude, the Bahá’í legal structure, as embodied in the Constitution of the
Universal House of Justice presents a model of viable non-state governance that resembles the
state and ensures continuity.307
