                                Themes of “The Erotic” in Sufi Mysticism
Jonah Winters

1\. INTRODUCTION

There is, in the human experience, a connection between sexuality and religion. This
connection can be found in all religions and in all ages. In the religions of the post-axial age,
from approximately 500 B.C.E. to the present, the sexual half of this equation has been little
emphasized, or has been expressed only esoterically. As well, sexuality in religious thought and
expression has often been subsumed by the more abstract theme of love. However, though
sexuality is often hidden, or even is masked by orthodoxy, it remains a vibrant ingredient of
religion. This is most apparent within mysticism.

I will focus on only one aesthetic of sexuality in religious expression: the theme of the
erotic. To narrow the topic yet further, I will examine it within the Islamic tradition only. I will
look briefly at sample instances of the erotic in a few different religions and then will examine in
greater depth the erotic in Sufism.

The theme of the erotic within religion can be, pardon the pun, a touchy one. On the one
hand, a person’s religious beliefs, if sincere, will surely be of paramount importance to him or
her. Misinterpretations of or challenges to those beliefs would be no small matter. In many
cultural paradigms, sexuality is seen as being far removed from spirituality, the former being a
very worldly concern and the latter an other-worldly one.

Such a tension is usually unfounded. There is a dialectic between sexuality and
spirituality within Islam, but not an oppositional one. However, since the potential for
misunderstanding is so great, it is all the more essential that I be clear about what exactly the
topic is and what the parameters of my investigation will be. I will therefore start with an
extended introduction to and background of the topic, narrowing down what exactly is meant in
this context by some of these broad and often loaded terms, such as the “erotic.” and even
“sensuality.” By defining some of the key terms and concepts up front I hope to present clearly
what the topic at hand consists of and, equally importantly, what it does not consist of. Since our
understandings of these themes are very much culturally conditioned, I will briefly explore here
what the term “erotic” signifies and suggests to modern Occidental ears. After establishing this
foundation, I present some examples of sexual and erotic expression in the history of religions.
This will demonstrate the universality of this phenomenon within history and human experience.
Following this, I examine the theme within the tradition of mystical Islam.

2. THE MEANING OF “EROTIC”

Three superficial components of the word erotic are “of or concerning, tending to arouse,
or dominated by sexual love and desire.”2 This is accurate, for the common understanding of
eroticism seems to be just this, and little more. However, the meanings of the word need not be
confined to the physical: another dictionary gives “of or pertaining to sexual love; treating of
love; amatory.” Also revealing, the word erotic can be used as a noun: “an amorous composition
or poem; also, a theory or doctrine of love.”3

Eros was originally a very positive figure. For Hesiod, the oldest of the extant Greek
poets, he was “the fairest of the deathless gods” but his character later became mischievous,
naughty, and even evil.4 A similar degeneration can be seen with Cupid, Eros’s Roman
counterpart, as “cupidity” came to signify excessive lust or avarice. The affections of the Greeks
and the Romans turned instead to the more chaste Aphrodite/Venus who, though she could
signify sexual love as well as beauty (e.g., “aphrodisiac”), never represented crude physicality.5

The word “sensual,” which I will also use in this paper, has had a similarly unfortunate
history. Though its literal meaning is nothing more than “pertaining to the senses,” it has long
signified “gratification of the physical and especially the sexual appetites.”6 The jacket blurb for
a recent book on sexuality and Christianity goes so far as to call sensuality “a twisted form of
love that has resulted in unprecedented divorce rates, promiscuity, infidelity, teenage
pregnancies, homosexuality, and abortion.”7 As far back as the eighteenth century, writers have
been aware of this and have substituted another word; Coleridge wrote: “I have adopted from our
elder classics the word sensuous, because sensual is not at present used, except in a bad sense.”8
English usage continues to observe this distinction.

I begin the discussion of the meaning of “erotic” with a truism—sex and love are not the
same thing. Common sense and intuition attest to this, as do most religious and philosophical
systems. Freud, to whom I’ll return shortly, provided empirically-verifiable theory to
demonstrate this when he investigated the nature of the libido. Though Freud conflated love and
sex, declaring love to be merely a sublimated abstraction of sex, his clinical analyses of sexuality

provided a springboard for later psychologists, such as C. G. Jung and Erich Fromm, to draw
clearer distinctions between the various forms of human love. Freud’s observations of the power
of the libido were partly validated by further research, e.g. that of Wilhelm Reich, but his
derogation of love to a release of repressed sexuality has been abandoned by more enlightened
thinkers.9

Paul Ricoeur, the influential phenomenologist of religion, noted three stages in the
understanding of sexuality and religion in the West. In the first stage, the earliest days of
humanity, there was no real separation between the two. But the axial age, when the world’s
major religions arose, witnessed a clear divorcing of the two—religion was defined
transcendentally, and sexuality became shameful. (Some words reflect this: “pudendum” is from
L. pudere, to make or be ashamed.) Ricoeur noted that we now seem to be entering a third phase,
one in which there is a push to reunite sexuality with the experience of the sacred.10

The erotic, in this third sense, refers to a unique energy which is not to be equated either
with the instinct of libido or the social construct of lust. It is not an energy which is in any way
immoral or shameful. Rather, erotic here will refer to the aesthetic of a sacralization of sexuality.
It is the sexual instinct expressed through the channels of art, love, and, in the case of mysticism,
spirituality. While it would be nice to have a synonym for erotic, one without its manifold
connotations, there is no felicitous alternative; I ask the reader to keep in mind the term’s
specialized meaning in this context.

Because sex and love are not the same thing, the concept of love also needs to be defined
for this context. As erotic means something other than, and more than, “sexual,” by love I mean
something distinct from “erotic." Whereas the theme of the erotic in philosophy and religion is
usually only implicit, or even esoterically hidden, love is conspicuous. For example, a
concordance indicates the word love is found over 400 times in the Bible, but derivations of the
word eros are not found once. There has also been a wealth of research produced on concepts
and themes of love in religion, but very little on eroticism. It is largely for this reason that I
carefully do not address this paper to the theme of love, even though love will always be arching
over and animating the topics at hand.11

The above discussion is simple and incomplete; I present it here more as a caveat. The

meaning and variety of mystic eroticism will become clearer as I relate some of its instances in
the history of religions.

3\. BACKGROUND: SEXUALITY IN THE HISTORY OF WESTERN THOUGHT

The use of erotic and love imagery is a phenomenological constant in the history of
religions—every religion seems to have its instances of it. I will survey some of these instances
partly to demonstrate both the universality and the variety of this theme and partly to provide
more of a background understanding of it. My examples are from prehistoric statuary, Greek
philosophy, the Jewish Bible, Christian thought, and then some modern psychoanalytic
understandings. To limit the scope of this introduction, I’ll mention the only Eastern traditions in
passing. The Islamic tradition will follow.

The connection between religion and sexuality seems to date back to the very earliest
days of humanity. Our only real clues about the nature of religious belief in prehistoric times are
from cave paintings and statuary. The other remnants from earliest human history, such as
fossils, tools, and weapons, provide no insight into religion. Of this primordial art, two forms
stand out in their ubiquity—phallic symbols and the so-called “Venus Figurines.”

The male human was rarely depicted as a whole body. Rather, he was represented
primarily by phallic carvings and paintings. Even more common than these is depictions of the
female body in small statues of rotund women. So many of these Venus figurines have been
found that this symbolism has been referred to as “the most prominent feature in ...prehistoric
religion.”12 It has even been suggested that these statuettes represented, not just a celebration of
femininity, but perhaps even the earliest manifestation of the concept of divinity.13 Whether or
not the figurines can be said to represent proto-theologies, one aspect of them is undeniable.
They seem to represent, not just maternity, but erotic sexuality. (Some scholars, like Richard
Lewinsohn, have commented that these fat, faceless statues “must have been quite unerotic,”14
but this is hardly a fair statement. To impose modern aesthetics on such a distant culture is
presumptuous, and, since humanity was still in the midst of an ice age, it is possible that most
people were fatter than we are today.15) All of the accent on these statuettes is on the sexual
features of breasts, mons pubis, and buttocks. Since there are few depictions of intercourse,
pregnancy, birth, or children from the prehistoric period, it seems likely that it was not maternity,
but sexual aesthetics, that was being glorified. No decisive conclusions can be made about either
the erotic or the religious significance of these Venus figurines, but at least some connection is

indubitable.

The modern Western world’s understanding of themes of the erotic starts with the
Greeks. Though Judaism obviously was the foundation of Christianity, it was Hellenistic thought
that shaped the philosophy of the West. Hellenism was the first coherent philosophical tradition
of the Occident, and also has deeply shaped Christianity and Islam.

The reader will have noted the care I took to clarify my terms (a necessity caused by the
paucity of synonyms for certain things in English). “Love” is one of these words slighted by the
language. Classical Greek, however, is more precise. It distinguishes ’ερως [eros], desirous love;
’επιθυµια [epithymia], concupiscent love; ’αγαπη [agape], affectionate, benevolent love; and
φιλια [philia], neighborly, brotherly love.

Mythological accounts of the god Eros go back at least to 900 B.C.E., the time of Hesiod,
but it wasn’t until the writings of Plato that he became a figure worthy of note. It is Plato who
first elevates Love to the importance it later takes in Christianity: “He whom Love [eros] touches
not, walks in darkness,” Plato declares.16 Eros “gives to us the greatest goods,” says Phaedrus in
the Symposium, for “there is a certain guidance each person needs for his whole life, if he is to
live well; and nothing imparts this guidance... as well as Love.”17 Eros provides guidance by
acting as a motive force to self-improvement and self-transcendence. The Platonic ideal for a
human is meditation upon the immortal Forms and, ultimately, contemplative union with them
by virtue of purifying the mind of animalistic dross. Eros represents the longing inherent in the
incarnate human being for his or her original source. It is a spirit (δαιµονιον [daimonion]) which
drives us to turn away from the world of the senses to seek transcendent union.18 Conversely, it
is the concupiscent love, manifested by the many forms of lust, which binds us to the earthly
realm.

Plato made a further distinction between heavenly and common love, though he
represented both by the same goddess, Aphrodite. Aphrodite’s “common love” side is that which
seeks fulfillment in the human sphere. “This, of course, is the love felt by the vulgar, who are
attached to women no less than to boys [and] to the body more than to the soul, ...since all they
care about is completing the sexual act,” explains Pausanias.19 Aphrodite’s “heavenly love” side,
by contrast, is “free from the lewdness of youth.”20 This is love which is mutual between souls, is
infused with wisdom, and is less concerned with (though not wholly indifferent to) physical
considerations. It is important to note that, though Plato said that the heavenly love is superior,

he in no way scorned the common love. Speaking of the two, he pointedly noted “all the gods
must be praised.”21

Plato, though he did not completely dismiss earthly love, put all of his emphasis on the
transcendent. This philosophy of love proved to be quite long-lasting, for it was preserved in the
Neo-Platonism of Plotinus and reaffirmed by St. Augustine. However, there was a solid secular
side to Greek erotic expression. First, the Hellenistic culture could be quite lewd, as Eva Keuls
has demonstrated in The Reign of the Phallus.22 But that does not constitute eroticism as used in
this context. Rather, I refer to the refined art of erotic expression found in the poetry of Sappho ,
later, Ovid. Sappho wrote poems of nostalgia and longing with very human subjects. Her writing
expresses a greater depth of feeling and passion than does Plato’s model of tidy virtue. And yet,
her art was metaphoric and spiritual enough to escape condemnation as simple sex eulogizing.
Some modern scholars have even suggested that her love poetry was purely spiritual.23

The New Testament is fairly devoid of eroticism. Greek and Essenic asceticism seems to
have been a sufficient influence to make religious sentiments of the time, as Diane Ackerman
puts it, “nonerotic and full of self-denial.”24 By contrast, she describes heterosexual love in the
Old Testament as being “sometimes down to earth, very material, and deliciously sensual.”25 For
example, the covenanted relationship between Yahweh and the Chosen People is expressed as a
marriage—Israel is God’s bride.26 Nowhere is this more evident than in the allegory of the Song
of Solomon.

Solomon’s “Song of Songs” is a paean of love from a man to his soon-to-be bride. Far
more than a simple expression of emotion, the future husband and wife loving describe the
physical features of each other in very sensuous and sensual ways. They liken aspects and parts
of each other’s bodies to fruits, trees, and animals in a beautiful garden, and sing of their
impatience to consummate their marriage. Solomon concludes by begging his beloved to make
the haste of a wild deer in returning to his side.

A literalist interpretation of the Song of Solomon is that it describes the love of a
shepherd boy and his girlfriend.27 Though attributing the poem to Solomon, the tenth century
king of Israel, is historically impossible, Ackerman points out that it would at least be
thematically consistent. He did, after all, supposedly have 700 wives and 300 concubines, and his

frequent marriages were part of a traditional fertility ritual.28 The rabbinical tradition included
mystical interpretations of the poem from the earliest days, but never seems to have done so at
the expense of its profane side.29 It was left to Christianity, and especially the mediaeval
monastics, to provide such a coherent mystical interpretation of the song that its erotic side was
fully de-emphasized.

The inheritor of Hellenistic thought is, interestingly enough, Christianity. Most
obviously, the New Testament was composed in Greek. But more than this, says historian
Jaroslav Pelikan, the Hellenization of Christianity “is a question not of language but of
Weltanshauung [worldview].”30 One major theme of Greek culture adapted to Christianity is that
of love.

The exoteric Christian attitude towards sex can be summed up as follows. St. Paul taught
that celibacy was superior to marriage. The eschaton, the end of time promised by Jesus, was
believed to be immanent, and in light of the approaching demise of the human race marriage and
sexuality could be at best a waste of time and energy. There were a few early Fathers who
believed that sexuality could hold an honored place within Christianity, but the majority accepted
the view later formalized by Augustine: sexuality is a necessary part of the natural order and, as a
creation of God, must be intrinsically good. But God’s creation was tainted by certain aspects of
human free will. Humanity sought to assert its own will over that of God, an act known as the
original sin. As a consequence of and punishment for this all people are saddled with a
disobedience that now is an integral part of them, namely, an inherited rebellious sexual nature.
This inner disobedient will is manifested in even the greatest of (male) saints in the fact that they
have no control over erection and nocturnal emission. Further, in Augustine’s theory this original
sin is passed on to each person via the father’s semen. There is thus a tension between on the one
hand honoring God’s creation by respecting sexuality, and on the other hand controlling the
rebellious animal nature. People feel the pull of concupiscence and the revulsion of sin
simultaneously; hence Augustine’s famous plea “Grant me chastity and continence, but not
yet!”31 The later Fathers thus realized that they had to declare marriage to be an often necessary

evil, but on the whole inferior to celibacy.32

It would be easy to villainize Augustine for such a negative portrayal of human sexuality.

For example, it has been alleged that he misread the Greek text of Romans 5:12 “...sin entered
the world by one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all
sinned...” as “sin entered the world in one man,” and from this misreading based his concept of
original sin.33 However, this dismissive reading of Augustine and his contemporaries would be a
mistake. In reality, they connect sexuality and sin much less than is supposed, indicting instead
humanity’s original disobedience. Augustine wrote a rather lengthy book On the Good of
Marriage, devoted to elucidating the function of, and in places praising, human unions
(conjungio). Elsewhere, he was not shy about describing things religious in erotic terms. For
example, he portrays the Crucifixion thusly:

> Like a bridegroom Christ went forth from his chamber, he went out with a presage
> of his nuptials....He came to the marriage bed of the cross, and there, in mourning
> it, consummated his marriage...he lovingly gave himself up to the torment in place
> of his bride, and he joined himself to the woman forever.34

This is a side of Augustine’s thought that is rarely presented, and seems to have been forgotten
by many Christian thinkers.

The tension in late Patristic thought between the supposed sin of human sexuality and the
goodness of the divine creation laid the foundations for what Michel Foucault called a
“pathologization of sex”: distrust of the physical sex drive and anxiety about its damning effects
dominated the thought of early Mediaeval Christianity.35 Sex was only unwillingly condoned,
even between husband and wife: “He was allowed to kiss, fondle, and caress her—provided he
didn’t really enjoy it,” writes Ackerman.36 There was, however, a glimmer of light in this
atmosphere of apprehensive asceticism, namely, the influence of the Greeks. As mentioned
above, Greek has various words for love. A measure of acceptance of things sexual was
preserved by a linguistic trick. Instead of using eros for love, as Plato had done, the writers and
later interpreters of the New Testament used agape. Anders Nygren, in his magnum opus Agape
and Eros, distinguishes sharply between the two words: agape is God’s way to man, and eros is
man’s way to God. Agape has little sense of desire, for man is basically unlovable. God’s love
for man stems from the universal, unselfish nature of agape.37 God, however, is man’s ultimate

goal and the source of his being. It is man’s neediness and longing that spurs him to love God.

Herein lies the path for humanity: God has granted a measure of agape to all humans,38 and it is
now our duty to discover this agape and express it amongst each other. God, in his very nature, is
agape, and by manifesting it we become more spiritual.

The above discussion would suggest that the Christian tradition is universal in its trend to
sublimate a dark and sinful erotic love to a chaste and ascetic love. I will conclude by showing
yet another facet of Christian love. Fundamental to Christianity is a very clear-cut dualism:
Creator and creation are eternally other. Yet, the awe-some degree to which God is so wholly
“other” inspires, not just fear, but also fascination. Rudolf Otto explains that the utter mystery of
divinity causes the creature both to cower and, at the same time, to be captivated. This can
inspire a longing for that Wholly Other which can lead to a “Dionysiac intoxication.”39

Paul Tillich has explored this sense of longing by reemphasizing the erotic. “Eros,”
writes Tillich, is “the driving force in all cultural creativity and in all mysticism.”40 This is, to
say the least, a surprising remark coming from such a prominent theologian. And this remark
was not just a passing hyperbole—the erotic is central to and a decisive influence on Tillich’s
theology.41 To explain this, it must first be noted that Tillich was careful to draw a distinction
between eros and simple sex. This distinction, which, he said, forced the New Testament authors
as well as most subsequent Christians to steer clear of the term, resulted from an unfortunate
confusing of ’ερωσ, desirous love, and ’επιθυµια, concupiscence. Eros does not just seek
pleasure by striving for union with another human being, but also strives for union with God. It
is the longing to establish a full relationship, be that with a person, with one’s social group, with
sundered value paradigms, or with God; with, in short, anything from which one has become
existentially alienated. Eros as a longing awareness of alienation becomes the dynamic force
behind creativity, growth, and self-transcendence. It is “the moving power of life.”42

Tillich does not abandon agapic love, though. Agape remains the ultimate form of love,
the universal expression of divinity. Indeed, one of the goals of spiritual living is to sublimate
eros into agape, or at least to reconcile the two. The transcendent universality of agape makes it a
less concrete element of human life that the erotic. (This concept of the erotic is relevant to the
later discussion of Islam.)

Brevity requires that I only discuss Western traditions in this introduction, but I don’t
want to leave the impression that the erotic in religion is only found in the Occident. Far from it;
the Orient has produced some of the most fascinating interactions between the two to be found.
For example, elements of Hinduism have turned religion into sexuality in the system of bhakti
yoga, or the practice of union with God through love. Conversely, elements of Hinduism,
Buddhism, and Taoism have turned sexuality into religion in the various systems of Tantra yoga,
or the practice of elevating sex itself to the divine. The latter represent what I think are the
clearest and most methodical of all schools of thought on the relation between mysticism and the
erotic (and it must be pointed out that Tantra has been so thoroughly re-interpreted and
sexualized by the contemporary West that it should more properly be termed neo-tantra). But it
is back to the West and its psychoanalytic school that I turn in concluding this survey.

To a large extent, both our understandings and our mis-understandings of the erotic stem
from Freud. Freud believed there to be two players in the drama of the erotic: pleasure and the
recovering of lost union. However, unlike the religious traditions, Freud does not recognize a
transcendental aspect to these players, but just the physical. Most forms of pleasure that we
engage in as adults are unconscious imitations of pleasures we experienced as infants, e.g.
nursing and excreting. Similarly, in our relationships the union we seek to restore is nothing
mystical, but is simply a search for lost parents. A man seeks a woman who most closely
resembles his mother, and a woman seeks a copy of her father. If sexuality harks back to
childhood excretory pleasures and our partner is the simulacrum of a parent, then the whole idea
of sexuality becomes perverted, and the meaning of love is belittled. Yet there is a good deal to
be praised in Freud’s work. He exposed the previously-unrealized extent of sexuality in human
interrelationships, and demonstrated the power of the libido. But it seems that his emphasis on
sexuality and love as nothing more than physical has harmed the respectability of the erotic. I
feel that it is necessary to mention this here, for we can’t understand the topic if we’re
unconscious of our residual cultural biases.

There is one aspect of Freud’s thought that is directly relevant to the study of mysticism:
love and death are intimately connected. This theory did not originate with Freud, as Ackerman
points out—Schopenhauer had written of the symbolic relationship between the womb and
death, and the earlier Elizabethans often used the euphemism “to die” to refer to sexual
pleasure—but it took Freud to amplify these ideas and derive a coherent theory based on them.43
There is a dialectic, Freud saw, between eros, the energy of procreative love, and thanatos, death.
Eros as an impulse towards life, towards combination and development, is set against the
movement towards death, the breakdown of structure and the cessation of stimulation.44 “Only

43 Ackerman, A Natural History of Love, 126.

1955), 227.
by the mutually opposing action of the two primal instincts—eros and the death instinct—never
by one or the other alone, can we explain the rich multiplicity of the phenomena of life,” wrote
Freud.45 All of our human lives, he believed, are lived beneath the penumbra of this struggle.

Freud understood that one of the main features of sex is the sequence from quiescence, to
rising agitation, to the moment of release of excited tension, followed by a gradual return to
quiescence. Freud found a parallel between this progression and the whole of the individual life
cycle, such that there is a tendency to try to maintain, or to return to, unstimulated tranquility. As
one author summarized it, if pain is defined as excitation and pleasure as the relief of that
excitation, then the greatest pleasure of all would be death.46 Combining the above theories gives
the following process: all humans seek pleasure, and sex is one of the most primal and powerful
pleasures, yet sex produces agitation, a “delicious tension.” While this excitement may be
pleasurable, the individual’s goal shifts from seeking pleasure to resolving that tension and
returning to a calm state. As the moment of orgasm, what Freud terms the “little death,” provides
such a release, it is analogous with the event of real death.

There is one other implication of Freud’s eros-thanatos dialectic which the existentialist
Tillich brought out. As explained above, Tillich found the motive force of life in a longing for
one’s estranged foundations, and the goal being a rediscovering, a reunion with, that foundation.
Irwin notes, though, that existentialism often focuses on the negative and painful aspects of
anxiety and loneliness (Sartre best embodies this theme). Through the theme of the erotic, a
positive element enters this predicament: namely, the possibility of overcoming it. Thus Tillich’s
existentialism, in Irwin’s words, “evokes not doubt, alienation, and psychospiritual suffering, but
a positive, eroticized existence.” Its defining characteristics and goals are knowledge, morality,
creativity, and an “erotic passion for the divine.”47 Tillich recognized that Freud’s libido,
whether expressed as sexual desire towards a person or existential-erotic desire for God, is
infinite and ultimately incapable of being fulfilled.48 The complete resolution of erotic desire, or
death, becomes its own goal — the exigency of which is, paradoxically, determined by its very
unreachability.

This discussion does not cover the full range of themes of the erotic in Western religion,
but merely demonstrates some salient aspects of this dynamic to lay a foundation for the
following discussion, where I examine the relationship between mysticism and the erotic in the
Islamic tradition more thoroughly.

4. ELEMENTS OF THE EROTIC IN SUFISM

In the remainder of this paper I will present the theme of the erotic in Sufi mysticism by
showing some specific instances, from the writings of select figures within the tradition. There
are two reasons for this. First, to examine the subject diachronically would require a familiarity
with over 1,300 years of writing and intellectual development. This is beyond both my grasp of
the subject and the limited scope of this paper. Two, there is quite a range of expression of the
topic in the history of Sufism, such that a unified distillation would distort the tradition.

There are a few themes that I wish to explore in Sufi mysticism. I will bring these up one
by one in the course of chronologically presenting the thought of the following seven figures,
each one representing a main theme. I will present the Prophet Muhammad, as the starting point
of Islamic mysticism; Rabi`a, as the founder of the theme of Sufi love; al-Hallaj, whose writings
are the locus classicus of impassioned union; al-Ghazzali, as the clear-headed systematizer and
reconciler of mysticism with orthodoxy; Ibn al-Farid, as the composer of one of the greatest
erotic love poems in Sufi literature; Ibn al-`Arabi, as a supreme philosopher of the erotic in the
Sufi tradition; and Rumi, as the exponent of love best-known in the West.

The earliest foundation of the theme of the erotic in Arabic poetry predates Islam. Poetry
was the primary form of literature, indeed, the main form of artistic expression, of the pre-
Islamic jahiliyya period (circa 500-622 C.E.). While there were many different types of poetic
form, the qasida, or ode, was the only “finished” type.49 The qasida tended to have a fairly
invariant structure: a nomad would stumble upon the remains of a desert camp and sing of its
desolation. His loneliness would inspire him to recall his fondness for those who had once
encamped there, and he would describe with nostalgia the strength of his affection for his
beloved, and frequently would describe her in detail. This section of the poem is called the nasib,
“erotic prelude.”50 Ibn Qutayba describes the nasib: here the poet (almost always male)
“bewailed the violence of his love and the anguish of separation from his mistress and the
extremity of his passion and desire.” Part of the poet’s motivation in including this was to “win
the hearts of his hearers... since the song of love touches men’s souls and takes hold of their
hearts.”51 After the nasib, the poet would praise his camel and the fortitude of the Bedouin
people, and following all of the above would begin the body of the ode, usually a panegyric to
his patron or a tale of battle.

51 Quoted in Nicholson, A Literary History, 78.

The qasida was so central to Arab culture that, as one scholar wrote, “the image of the
poet weeping at the memory of his lost love is considered the main expression of pre-Islamic
literature’s concern with matters of love and sexuality.”52 However, the poet’s detailed
descriptions of her were sensual only; Nicholson writes that “the physical charms of the heroine
are fully described but we seldom find any appreciation of moral beauty.”53 It was the
revolutionizing influence of Muhammad that inspired the development of a spiritual side to
erotic poetry.

Unlike founders of certain other religions, Muhammad figures relatively little in the
theme of erotic mysticism. He was sometimes an object of love for the later Sufis, and certainly
was often a focus of mysticism.54 The Western student of Islam, writes Annemarie Schimmel,
“will be surprised to see the strong ‘mystical’ qualities attributed to [Muhammad.]” And, she
continues, one element of Islam that Orientalism has tended to overlook is “that quality of
mystical love that his followers feel for him.”55 However, his influence in themes of the erotic is
more limited than that of the founders of some other religions is for their followers. For example,
some mediaeval nuns were known to meditate on the body of Christ with a concentrated
devotion approaching erotic fascination, a idea that would be quite alien to Islam.

The Qur’an elevates love to one of its central themes. In it, Muhammad writes numerous
times of the promise of Allah’s love for those who lead righteous lives and the threat that love
will be withdrawn should his followers be unrighteous. Besides this divine Platonic love, the
Qur’an also speaks of earthly, interpersonal love. It declares that Allah has united the disunified
peoples of the earth using the bond of love: “for ye were enemies and He joined your hearts in
love, so that by His Grace, ye became brethren...” (3:103). It also describes love as the bond
solidifying marriage: “He created for you mates from among yourselves, that ye may dwell in
tranquillity with them, and He has put love and mercy between your (hearts)” (30:21). Love is the
energy that motivates humans to reproduce: “It is He Who created you from a single person, and
made his mate of like nature, in order that he might dwell with her (in love)... [and thus] He
giveth them a goodly child” (7:189-190). There is only one mention in the Qur’an of things erotic,
namely in the story of Joseph and his master’s wife Zulaika where “(with passion) did she desire
him, and he would have desired her” (12.24). The ladies of the city later gossip that he had
“inspired her with violent love” (12:30). Nothing comes of their mutual desire, though, and this
particular incident in the tale of Joseph appears not to have inspired mystical interpretations. It

was left to the later Sufis to connect the themes of mysticism and the erotic.

The mystical thought of the first century following the Prophet was inspired by the same
elements in religion that motivated Muhammad. At its basis, writes Gibb, was “the fear of God
and of the Wrath to come”56 — very different themes from later Sufism. Some scholars have
seen such a divergence of focus from the Qur’an to second century Islamic mysticism that they
have doubted that Sufis even originated with Muhammad, postulating rather that it must have
grown out of relations with Nestorian and Monophysite Christians, mystical Judaism, or even
Buddhist and Hindu influences.

It was in the writings of Rabi`a al-`Adawiyya (d. 801) that the mysterium fascinans began
to take precedence over the mysterium tremendum. Rabi`a is credited as being the first to
introduce the theme of love into Sufism—not just the pious love of God and the brotherly,
tranquil love of one’s fellow Muslims, but an impassioned love whose only goal is unity with
God. Though Rabi`a’s love of God and God only could be quite coldly ascetic at times—she was
even said to have shut her windows to the flowers in spring in order not to be distracted57—
history treated her well. In a religion and an age where the role of women was anything but
positive, where one text was careful to define Rabi`a as a “man” before praising her58 and others
went so far as to declare women to be created from the sediment of the sins of demons,59
Rabi`a’s name quickly became a synonym for praiseworthy womanhood. To this day a woman is
praised by being called a “second Rabi`a,” and the poet Jami said that “if all women were like
[Rabi`a] then women would be preferred to men.”60

Rabi`a was, first and foremost, a lover of God. This love for God was so absolute that she
refused to compromise it by loving another human, even the Prophet himself. “I belong only to
Him,” was her answer to Hasan al-Basri’s marriage proposal.61 Indeed, her love of God was so
pure-minded that she rejected even some of the most basics tenets of her religion, as expressed in
her famous prayer:

> O God! If I worship Thee in fear of Hell, burn me in Hell; and if I worship Thee in
> hope of Paradise, exclude me from Paradise; but if I worship Thee for Thine own
> sake, withhold not Thine Everlasting Beauty.62

However, though she clearly introduced the theme of love, she does not seem to have used much
symbolism of love in her poetry. Her descriptions of it tend to be very chaste. It was the next
major Sufi figure, al-Hallaj, who seems to have inherited most profoundly Rabi`a’s legacy. He
was less meticulous about using traditional and non-sexual imagery, and was more explicit about
the goal of union.

The love which inspired Rabi`a was, in Schimmels’ words, a disinterested love, a love
“for which God has not asked and for which He will not recompense the lover.”63 This sense of
God’s love was strengthened in the thought of many later Sufis, such as Abu’l-Husayn an-Nuri
(d. 907), who spoke of being a lover (`ashiq) of God and felt a love so overwhelming that the
orthodox considered him likely to be tempted to commit blameworthy acts. To defend himself
against those who objected that a self-sufficient entity couldn’t feel the sort of longing implied
by passionate love (`ishq), Nuri stated that the lover is kept at a distance from God.64 This
passionate love was taken to its logical conclusion, namely the union for which passion longs, by
Nuri’s contemporary Husayn ibn Mansur al-Hallaj (d. 922).

Rabi`a seems to have loved a God who was an other, a being who created her and yet was
distinct from her. al-Hallaj, though, often has been interpreted as loving a God who was identical
with himself. Inspired by Qur’anic verses such as “He who hath given thee the Qur’an for a law
will surely bring thee back home again,” (28:85), al-Hallaj wrote: “I have become the One I love,
and the One I love has become me! We are two spirits infused in a (single) body.”65 This sense
of tawhid, of a complete unification of the lover and the beloved, led al-Hallaj to speak of God in
very amorous terms. al-Hallaj’s biographer Louis Massignon, in describing his ideas of mystical
ontology, wrote that, for al-Hallaj, divine union is consummated in “the amorous nuptial in
which the Creator ultimately rejoins his creature ...and in which the latter opens his heart to his
Beloved in intimate, familiar” discourse.66

According to Massignon, al-Hallaj’s writings represented a marked distinction from
other, non-religious poetry of the time. The ideal of Baghdadian high society at the time, he
states, was the search for ecstasy, often inspired by what he terms femmes de luxe, women who
were “professional idols of beauty” who functioned “to stimulate people’s desire for aesthetic
diversion.” The presence of human beauty could be used to inspire an awareness of divine
beauty, as if one’s attraction to the human object could intentionally be shunted to, or transmuted

University Press, 1982), 43.

(Princeton University Press, 1994),135.
into, an attraction to the divine object.67 al-Hallaj would at times speak of the relationship
between the mystic and God as being like that between lovers. For example, in clarifying what
he does and does not mean by tawhid, al-Hallaj portrays God as playing some kind of lover’s
game, in which God presents the mystic with a series of veils that must be lifted, one by one.68
This seemingly is for the sake of titillating the mystic and tricking him into being attracted to a
Godself which the mystic rationally understands must ultimately remain inaccessible. However,
al-Hallaj distanced himself from any erotic trend: in no place does he use imagery that could be
misconstrued as referring to human sexuality. “The mystery of loving union,” writes Schimmel,
“is celebrated in verses free of any trace of the symbolism of profane love.”69

al-Hallaj’s care in not to using profane imagery seems not to have saved him from the
misunderstandings of the orthodox. Massignon writes that one of the three main reasons he was
executed was for his crime of zandaqa, which Massignon ranslates as the “thesis of divine
love.”70 The figure of al-Hallaj was quite fresh in the mind of a mystic who followed him by two
centuries, Abu Hamid al-Ghazzali (d. 1111). In many ways al-Hallaj made mysticism quite
suspect in the eyes of much of the Muslim community, a status al-Ghazzali was determined to
rectify. And he succeeded: he is regarded not only as the reconciler of orthodoxy and the
heterodox Sufism, but has even been called “the greatest Muslim after Muhammad.”71 His
influence in Islam seems in many ways to be analogous to that of Augustine’s in Christianity.
Their similarity is especially marked in their approaches to the interface between sexuality and
mysticism.

al-Ghazzali, like Augustine, was emphatic about the good of sexuality and marriage when
practiced in their proper ways, and the evil of both when misused. He writes: “Know that
marriage is one part of the way of religion, like eating food... God created the womb. He created
the organ of intercourse... No intelligent person will miss what God means by this.” The
structure of marriage as created by God has another necessary component: desire. “God created
appetite as a deputy responsible for encouraging people to marry.” However, it was clear to al-
Ghazzali that human desires often become ends in themselves. “Marriage was made permissible
for this reason [procreation], not for the sake of satisfying one’ appetites.”72 The love of God,

Thought (Albany: SUNY Press, 1992), 172f.
which al-Ghazzali calls “the highest of all topics,” belongs in a position superior to any and all
other forms of love. If this love does not “conquer a man’s heart and possess it wholly,” or at
least “predominate in the heart over the love of all other things,” then the mystic is in “spiritual
danger.”73

al-Ghazzali’s perspective of sexual themes in mysticism comes out most clearly in his
discussions of mystical union and the manifold misunderstandings of it. He was well aware of
the tendency to use erotic imagery as metaphors for divine love. He does not dismiss this theme,
but rather cautions clearly that one not misunderstand the intent:

> As regards the erotic poetry which is recited in Sufi gatherings, and to which
> people sometimes make objection, we must remember that, when in such poetry
> mention is made of separation from or union with the beloved, the Sufi, who is an
> adept in the love of God applies such expressions to separation from or union with
> him.74

al-Ghazzali is here defending mysticism against the complaints of those who, believing all Sufis
to be as heterodox as al-Hallaj, objected to discussions of union with God. This comes out quite
clearly in his epilogue to the Ninety-Nine Beautiful Names of God, where he exhaustively
explains what al-Hallaj might and might not have meant by declaring his soul and God’s to be
united. al-Ghazzali manages to criticize al-Hallaj without actually disagreeing with him. He
concludes that al-Hallaj had not been blasphemous, but rather only unwise in proclaiming a
mystical truth that could be misleading to the uninitiated.75 In his Deliverance from Error he
explains that the fault lies, not in the attempt to attain this union, but in describing it incorrectly.
The mystics reach a “higher stage” where, instead of beholding visions, “they come to stages in
the ‘way’ which it is hard to describe in language; if a man attempts to express these, his words
inevitably contain what is erroneous.” What these mystics really achieve, he says, is “nearness”
(qurb). They may call it inherence (hulul), union (ittihad), or connection (wusul), but these are
all erroneous.76 There is a certain ambivalence in al-Ghazzali’s defense of al-Hallaj: one gets the
impression that, though he consistently denounces al-Hallaj as unwise and in error, yet he
privately does not reject al-Hallaj’s claims.

It is difficult to draw conclusions about al-Ghazzali’s feelings on the use of sensuousity
and erotic imagery, for there appears to be an ambivalence between his exoteric philosophy and
what seem to be his personal beliefs. For example, he explains that music and dancing can

induce states of ecstasy that “fan into flame whatever love is dormant in the heart, whether it be
earthly and sensual, or divine and spiritual.” If the love in one’s heart is true, then “it is perfectly
lawful, nay, laudable in [sic] him to take part in exercises which promote it,” but “if his heart is
full of sensual desires, music and dancing will only increase them and are therefore unlawful.”77
Later, he explicitly links Qur’anic recitation and erotic poetry as both being valid ways “to stir
the emotions.”78 It is likely that this seeming ambiguity is caused by the fact that some of his
texts were written for the uninitiated public and others for his inner circle of followers, and his
explanations differ accordingly depending on whom he is addressing. The resolution is simply
that the worldly appetites, for al-Ghazzali, are admirable if motivated by the proper form of
love—“the senses were created to spy for the intellect. They were to be its snare through which it
might know the wonders of God’s handiwork”—and blameworthy if motivated by worldy
satisfactions only—“the pig is appetite... through covetousness the pig invites to indecency and
abomination.”79

Moving on to the thirteenth century C.E., there are two figures who must be discussed
together. Though the philosophies of the Egyptian poet `Umar Ibn al-Farid (d. 1235) and the
Spanish theosophist Muhyiuddin Muhammad Ibn al-`Arabi (d. 1240) are quite dissimilar, they
share similarities besides mere contemporaneity: each has attracted the fascination of Westerners
to a great extent, and, more pertinent, each uses allegories of the erotic to an extent unmatched
by almost any other Muslim mystic.

Ibn al-Farid is, after al-Hallaj, the mystical poet of the Arabic language who has attracted
the most attention by Orientalists. Indeed, R. A. Nicholson devotes a full third of Studies in
Islamic Mysticism, the first major work on Sufism in English, to “The Odes of Ibn al-Farid.”80 In
his odes, which Schimmel says “unquestionably form the climax of classical Arabic mystical
verse,”81 he sings some of the most direct and romantically heartfelt love poetry to be found in
the whole of Sufism.

The earliest source within Islamic history of the erotic poem is, as mentioned above, the
prelude to the qasida, the subject of which was the poet’s earthly love, his celebration of her
beauty, his longings for her, and a mourning of her absence. As we have seen, the early Sufi
expressions of love tended to focus on a love that was spiritual only, even though the uninitiated
often misunderstood it to be a naturalistic one. Ibn al-Farid’s writings bridged the two extremes
of chaste and sensual love, and this is perhaps a part of the reason that they achieved such

popularity: both the mystic and the worldly person could find meaning and aesthetic pleasure in
his poetry. His Ta’iyyatu’l-kubra, or “Lesser Ode rhyming in ‘T’,” is often considered the
greatest example in Sufi literature of such love poetry. It can be read both as a mystical text and
as a celebration of earthly courtship. It is likely, though, that the intent of the author was to
glorify the divine, not the earthly, lover. As Schimmel points out, “the greatest mistake we can
make” in interpreting this poetry is to assume that the poets are “liberties and wild, love-
intoxicated characters who had nothing to do but sing about beautiful girls or boys and about
very worldly pleasures in the wine-house.”82 This interpretation of the Ta’iyyatu’l-kubra is
suggested by the fact that Ibn al-Farid once said that “Had I wished, I could have written two
volumes of commentary on every verse of it.”83 Though the “common person” may have read his
verses simply as love poetry, many of his fellow mystics shared his understanding of the work.
Ibn al-Farid’s commentator Nabulusi explained that

> in every erotic description, whether the subject thereof be male or female, and in
> all imagery of gardens, flowers, rivers, birds and the like [Ibn al-Farid] refers to the
> Divine Reality manifested in phenomena, and not to those phenomena themselves.

The lengthy Ta’iyyatu’l-kubra (761 verses) uses the device of a running narrative
interspersed with dialogue to describe the phases of mystical experience through which one
passes in attaining oneness with God, and describes the nature of that oneness. Unlike many
other examples of esoteric discourse, Nicholson feels that Ibn al-Farid’s symbolism was not so
much a mask used to hide what would be dangerous to express in plain speech, but rather was
the only possible means of imparting mystical truth.84 I will summarize some of the basic
elements of the poem. (Since I will need to shorten the poem considerably, I will present it in a
summarized form. Some of this is paraphrase, but most of it is a condensing of Nicholson’s
verses without the disruptive ellipses (...). The partite analysis of the text is also largely
Nicholson’s.)

The poem opens in a way reminiscent of the jahiliyya poetry: the narrator complains of
his sufferings in the path of seeking his beloved, his loneliness, and his longing to be with her.

> I drank love’s strong wine, and when my sobriety was ended, I sought union with
> her [my beloved]. And I said, from my state of ardent love and suffering, “bestow
> on my your glance. I feel a passion that only tears betrayed. Anguish hath sorely
> oppressed me, and emaciation hath laid bare the secret of my true being. But thy
> beauty ordained that I should endure, for when one is ensnared by Beauty,

methinks his soul even from the most delicious life is gladly rendered up to death.

> I swear by the firm pact of love between us that thou art the desire of my heart and
> the end of my search. Everything in thee is the source of my fascination, and I
> never was bewildered until I chose love of thee as a religion. (verses 1-83)

The Beloved answers him, saying that he is insincere and presumptuous. He is not really in love
with her, but just with himself.

> Another’s love hast thou sought and hast taken the wrong path. To those who are
> rightly guided the straight road unto me is plain, but all men are made blind by
> their desires. Cease, then, pretending to love, and shun the quarter of union: ’tis far
> off, and was never reached in life, and lo, thou art living. If thou art sincere, die!

Such is Love. (84-102)

The poet objects that, no, such a death is his truest wish, for it is through such a debasing that
true honor lies: “By my life, though I lose my life in exchange for her love, I am the gainer; and
if she wastes away my heart, she will make it whole once more.” (121) He now turns to his
audience, and explains that this beloved has truly become the focus of his spirituality.

> ‘Tis my being crazed with love of her that makes me jealous of her, and my spirit
> is rapt in ecstatic joy towards her. Whilst I prayed mine eye was seeing her in front
> of me, and to her I address my prayers. (144-152)

Yet, in a way very reminiscent of al-Hallaj, the Lover and the Beloved are one.

> Both of us are a single worshipper who, in respect of the united state, bows himself
> to his essence in every act of bowing. And I saw that I was indubitably she whom I
> loved, and that for this reason my self had referred me to myself. (153-163)

What Ibn al-Farid means by this union is not the ontological tawhid of which al-Hallaj was
accused, but rather an ec-stasy, a forgetting of oneself. It seems as if the discontiguous selves
have now attained a state of marriage, from which they work as a team.

> I sought to approach her by sacrificing myself, and she drew me nigh. And with
> entire disinterestedness I put behind me any regard for myself. Through her, not
> through myself, I began to guide unto her those who by themselves had lost the
> right ways; and ’twas she that really guided them. (168-174)

Now the poet begins to explain as well as he can just what the nature of this union is. It seems as
though he is trying to explain baqa’, or subsistence, the state which follows the above fana’,
extinction.

I had been enamored of her, but when I renounced my desire, she desired me for
> herself and loved me. And I became a beloved, nay, one loving himself. Through
> her I went forth from myself to her and came not back to myself. In the sobriety
> after self-effacement I was none other than she, and when she unveiled herself my
> attributes became hers and we are one. (204-215)

After more discussion of the nature of this union, al-Farid seems to explain that God manifests
himself in beauteous forms for the sake of tricking humans into following this, the right path.

> The charm of every fair youth or lovely woman is lent to them from Her beauty. It
> was only because she clothed herself in the form of beautiful phenomena, and her
> lovers supposed that these phenomena were other than she, that they loved her.
> Every lover, I am he, and She is every lover’s beloved, and all lovers and loved are
> but names of a vesture. (242-264)

Ibn al-Farid continues his exposition of ittihad, emphasizing the importance of not abandoning
the shari`ah, the path of law, in favor of the mystical quest. He then pauses to offer a fifty-two
verse eulogy of his beloved and her beauty. (Unfortunately, though Nicholson describes this
section as a “beautiful lyric interlude,” he doesn’t translate it here.) The poet returns to the topic
with a fascinating presentation and celebration of the physical senses as vehicles for divine
awareness.

The remainder of the poem deals largely with points of doctrine, such as the unreality of
metempsychosis and the importance of faith, and more discussions of the nature of reality.

I wish to draw attention to three specific aspects of the Ta’iyyatu’l-kubr which are
important to Sufism. One of the most unusual facets of this poem is the tone of worldliness with
which the poet speaks in places, and the physical nature of the symbols he employs. Not only
does he cast the mystical drama in human terms, but he even celebrates the human senses and
shows that they can act as conduits for transcendent awakening. Throughout the entire poem he
uses physical symbols such as clothing and veils, dressing and undressing, hiding and veiling,
the comeliness of faces, and the prehension of the transcendent Beloved with the physical senses.
Second, al-Farid’s use of the feminine pronoun, hiya / ha, must be pointed out. It would be

improper, from an objective standpoint, to connect the theme of the erotic with the use of
feminine imagery, for that would reduce the interpreter to a standpoint of androcentric
chauvinism. It must be acknowledged, though, that his audience, both then and now, was and is
likely to interpret the text in such a way; that is, to see it as erotic if but for no reason other than
that the motifs are feminine. This is largely because such motifs are unusual. The use of feminine
symbols less usual than the use of masculine imagery, because masculine imagery, e.g. God as
He and the poet a man, is the norm. The feminine pronoun immediately calls attention to itself,
especially if that pronoun refers in places to God. One might remark that there is a considerable
amount of mystical Arabic poetry which employs hiya and ha, but in the vast majority of these
instances the pronoun refers to a grammatically feminine object, such as nafs, the soul. Its
application to God, though, is not one motivated by grammatical necessity. A third important
aspect is the dramatic element of this poem. Though it is not a dialogue proper, since the
Beloved only speaks once (verses 84-102), there is much indirect dialogical activity. For example,
the poet’s “confidant” speaks to the poet in verses 24-25, though it is nonverbal speech, rather a
kind of direct intuition into the poet’s mind, “as though the Recording Angels had come down”
(verse 25). There are also a few places where the poet seems to be addressing the reader. This
dialogue gives the effect of reinforcing the theme of personal interaction between the lover and
the beloved, culminating not only in their union but also in their acting as one, almost as a
married couple.

Ibn al-`Arabi uses gender imagery in a similar way as does al-Farid—both envision a
dialogue between the soul and God through the analogy of a dialogue between a male lover and a
female beloved. However, unlike the poet al-Farid, Ibn al-`Arabi is a philosopher. He greatly
expands this imagery beyond mere poesis and makes of it an ontological explanation of the
cosmos and a soteriological explanation of encounter with God. In fine, he “sexualizes” the
cosmos.

I will examine the theme of sexual mysticism in the thought of Ibn al-`Arabi in two parts.

I will present first his involvement with themes of the erotic in the worldly plane, and then their
impact on his mystical philosophy.

Two types of human relationships motivated Ibn al-`Arabi to value highly the
relationship between human lovers, and especially women: the fondness the Prophet felt for
women, and a decisive meeting al-`Arabi himself had with a young woman. There is a famous
hadith in which Muhammad states that he was given by God a love for perfumes and women and
joy in prayer. Ibn al-`Arabi makes extensive use of this hadith in the final chapter of his Bezels of
Wisdom, where he bases much of his reverence for women on this proclivity of Muhammad.
Further, he hypothesizes that Muhammad did not merely feel an attraction to women, but even
pointedly drew attention to the general concept of femininity in a few specific locutions of

grammar. “Then the Apostle goes on to give precedence to the feminine over the masculine,
intending to convey thereby a special concern with and experience of women.” This is
remarkable, he explains, because “the Arabs usually make the masculine gender prevail.”85 Lest
one be tempted to interpret this fondness as an emotional one only, al-`Arabi goes on to explain
that Muhammad also loved “the aromas of generation in women, the most delightful of perfumes
being [experienced] within the embrace of the beloved.”86 Since the Prophet is the model of
perfection for all humanity, he concludes, “love for [women] is obligatory.”87

Ibn al-`Arabi also had one encounter with a woman that, though Merkur states was
imaginal only, seems to have been particularly influential on his thought. A shaykh had a
daughter, “a particularly lissome young girl,” and al-`Arabi states that he “observed with care the
noble endowments that graced her person.” He “took her as a model for the poems in the present
book, which are love poems.” She became a conscious inspiration for much of his work, for he
soon says “whatever name I may mention in this work, it is to her that I am alluding.”88 This
sensual attraction al-`Arabi felt for women was not merely confined to his imaginal visions, for
he elsewhere celebrates physical intercourse. “When a man loves a woman, he seeks union with
her, that is to say the most complete union possible in love, and there is in the elemental sphere
no greater union than that between the sexes.”89

The high status in which al-`Arabi places physical charms and sex should not be
interpreted to mean that his interests were lascivious. On the contrary, his intention is tantric; that
is, he elevates sex to a spiritual practice and goes so far as to found, if implicitly, his entire
cosmology on the model of sexuality. The Islamicist Sachiko Murata writes that “[i]t should not
be imagined that Ibn al-`Arabi is prescribing sexual activity as a means of achieving spiritual
realization,”90 but in many places it does seem that he is doing exactly that. First, and most
simply, he venerates the procreative function of sex. “The relation of woman with man is that of
Nature with the Soul. Woman is the medium through which children appear just as Nature is the
medium through which bodies appear.” Yet he is not simply stating the obvious, for he
immediately follows this observation with the statement that “There can be no Soul without
Nature and no nature without Soul.”91 Immediately following the above discussion of the
“delightful aromas” of the woman’s body during intercourse,92 he cites the Qur’an 24:26,

interpreting tayyib to mean, not “good” as normally translated, but “sweet-smelling,”93 thus
giving the meaning as “sweet-smelling women (tayyibat) are for sweet-smelling men.”94
However, it is in the mystical interpretation of sexuality that this “prescription” becomes most
clear.

Regarding the above-mentioned young woman, Ibn al-`Arabi wrote that any names in
that book were to be taken as reference to hers. His mystical interpretation of sex is the converse
of this: references to physical union or to the human female are to be taken as references to
mystical union or to the divine female. The reason for this is that, in al-`Arabi’s philosophy, all
divine attributes are by necessity manifested in, and nonexistent without, worldly loci of
reflection of these attributes. He criticizes the opposing argument by reference to al-Ghazzali,
who “asserted that God can be known without any reference to the created cosmos,” concluding
that this is mistaken.95 God’s attributes cannot truly be known, either by humans or by God, apart
from their manifestation. The most perfect locus of divine attributes in the created spheres is, for
Islam, the human being. For al-`Arabi, then, it is in the human that the mystic can see God most
fully. He is not, however, referring to just any type of human. Ibn al-`Arabi claims that it is
specifically women who are the most perfect mirror for God. It should seem as though this is al-
`Arabi’s personal preference as a man, and that he is mistaken in elevating it to a universal truth.
That is to say, why, for a heterosexual woman, should not a man be the most perfect form of
witnessing? He does admit that, up to a point, this is true. His exegete Dawud Qaysari (d. 1350)
explains it as follows. The essences of women require that they be loved by men, and the
essences of men require that they be loved by women. “The man is loved and desired by the
woman,” and the woman is loved and desired by the man. “Each of them brings together the
attribute of being the lover and the beloved,” so that “each of them is lover from one point of
view and beloved from another point of view.” As this activity is all a reflection of divinity,
“love sets up the interrelationship between the Real and the creature,” Qaysari concludes.96 Yet
al-`Arabi persists in elevating the mirror of the feminine over the mirror of the masculine. Some
reasons he gives for this are the Prophet’s careful manipulation of grammatical gender, as
mentioned above. He also emphasizes quite often what he sees to be the essentially feminine
nature of words that are simply grammatically feminine, such as nafs, “soul,” `illa, “cause [of the
cosmos],” and especially dhat, “essence [of God].”

93 Cf. Hans Wehr, Arabic-English Dictionary, 578.
95 al-‘Arabí, The Bezels of Wisdom, 93. This may be clarified by reference to the distinction between

> could only be said to exist if it were manifested in the particular, e.g. “a beautiful thing.”
96 Quoted in Murata, The Tao of Islam, 196.

More than these language games, al-`Arabi finds what are, to him, transcendent
metaphysical reasons that femininity is a more perfect mirror than masculinity. Like Taoism, he
declares the universe to be created by and ontologically founded upon a metaphysical dualism of
gender; he draws the classic distinction that the feminine represents receptivity and the
masculine represents activity. Yet, unlike Taoism, al-`Arabi tends to priorize the feminine aspect
of “Nature.” Since God is the origin of the attributes which are reflected in the created world,
Nature can be seen as receiving these attributes and thus, though She comprises equally both
male and female energies, it is the receiving feminine that has the most direct tie with the
Creator. She is, as William Chittick puts it, the receptivity that allows the existent things to
become manifest.97 Ibn al-`Arabi’s cosmology thus becomes doubly feminine—not only is
Nature feminine in the sense of reflecting God’s attributes and receiving God’s creative impulse,
but also She “imparturates,” if I may coin the term, this creative impulse and becomes the mother
of all things.98 Ibn al-`Arabi summarizes this philosophy as follows: “Nature in relation to the
Real is like the female in relation to the male, since within it becomes manifest engendering, i.e.
the engendering of everything other than God... Nature is the highest, greatest mother of the
cosmos.”99

As might be evident, the depth of al-`Arabi’s thought on the interrelationship of the
erotic, sexuality, and divinity is vast. I conclude with two observations. First, it is important to
keep in mind that he was aware that this philosophy of sexuality could seem heterodox. His
sexual cosmology was certainly intended for an initiated audience only. For the average person
who does not have the intellectual insight to understand this philosophy and the necessary
control of his or her desires, “the marriage act becomes a form without spirit,” an expression
merely of the animal appetite.100 He whose love for women “is limited to natural lust lacks [all]
true knowledge” of divine love.101 Second, one must not forget that al-`Arabi was, first and
foremost, a mystic. “The gnostics never hear a verse, a riddle, a panegyric, or a love poem that is
not about [God],” he says.102 His primary intent was not to eulogize creation, nor to philosophize
about it, but to experience the divine presence—hence the importance of experiencing and
understanding what he calls God’s greatest self-disclosure: sexual union. As Murata puts it, sex
“incarnates God’s desire for creation and His joy in bringing the world into existence,” in that
the human appetite is a manifestation of God’s attribute of desire and love.103 The feminine and

the erotic can be means by which the mystic is motivated to seek God. To summarize from the
Bezels of Wisdom, “[The mystic’s] contemplation of the Reality in woman is the most complete
and perfect, because in this way he contemplates the Reality in both active and passive mode,”104
and thus human beauty becomes the means by which the mystic recognizes the divine and,
ultimately, attains the true union of which sexual union is but a reflection.

I finish my survey of Sufi themes with the one name most well-known to the Western
world: Maulana Jalaluddin Rumi al-Balkhi (d. 1273). Rumi is known as the most prolific writer
of love poetry in the Muslim world, and he, too, often speaks of love as being the main force
animating his life and spirit: “’Tis the flame of Love that fired me, ’Tis the wine of Love inspired
me.”105 However, I have found little erotic love from his pen.

There is a certain polarity within Rumi’s writings. On the one hand, his life and his
thought were filled with the experience of love. He had a relationship with Shamsuddin Tabrizi,
who seems to have been both his shaykh and his friend and peer. They were so close that at
certain meetings they would embrace each other and fall at each other’s feet, so in love with each
other “that one did not know who was lover and who was beloved.”106 Rumi sings of his love of
Shamsuddin in verses which Schimmel describes as being so full of love, longing, happiness,
and despair that they “have never been surpassed in their sincerity.”107 In places he speaks of
what could be seen as human love in quite positive terms: “May these vows and this marriage be
blessed. May it be sweet milk, this marriage, like wine and halvah... May this marriage be full of
laughter, our every day a day in paradise.”108 However, the love to which Rumi refers is a very
austere one. His verses about the tender, warm aspect of love are comparatively rare, writes
Schimmel. Instead, Rumi preferred to speak of love as being only for the strong and those
willing to suffer.109 When Rumi does speak of human relations, his overall tone seems to be too
negative to refer to it as “erotic.” “The fire of sensuality pulls us to hell,” he writes. “Its remedy
[is] “the light of religion... The sensuality of sex drags you back.”110 Elsewhere he implies that he
is denouncing, not just animal desires of the sort that al-Ghazzali condemns, but rather that he is
warning against any sensuous desire inspired by the earthly realm: “He who craves sensuality is
polluted, he who craves the intellect is pure.”111 Rumi emphasizes this emotional asceticism in
his praise of the angels. He points out that, in some Islamic theology, the animals are ruled by

sensuality whereas the angels, ruled by intellect, are entirely devoid of any sensuous motivation.

Humanity, though, is composed of half of each, and the mystic’s goal is thus to rid himself of
any and all sensual impulses and foster only the intellectual.

This negative trend becomes even more pronounced in Rumi’s depictions of women:

> Alas for those whose intellects are feminine and whose ugly souls are masculine
> and prepared... Happy are those whose intellects are masculine and whose ugly
> souls are feminine and helpless... Animal qualities prevail in “women,” because
> they tend toward color and scent. When the ass perceived the colour and scent of
> the pasture, all arguments fled from its nature.112

While Murata points out that we are not to interpret these references as referring literally to
women, quoting in support Rumi’s statement “When the Prophet said, ‘Put the females behind,’
he meant your soul,”113 the fact remains that Rumi’s depictions both of femininity and of human
love in general often come across as rather severe.

Rumi, without a doubt, was a master exponent of divine love. Love was not only one of
the most transformative experiences of his life, but was, for him, both the energizing force of the
universe—“If the sun were not in love, in his beauty would be no light, and if earth and mountain
were not lovers, grass would not grow out of their breasts”—and also the most dynamic—“love
makes the ocean boil like a kettle.”114 However, his writing so often contains images that are
downright crass that one is not left with the impression that Rumi celebrates anything erotic.

5\. CONCLUSION

With the famous Rumi I conclude my brief survey of themes of the erotic in Sufism.

Certainly, the discussion is not complete. No exposition of love and the sensuous in Islamic
mysticism could be anything but incomplete without at least a mention of Bayezid Bistami,
Sana’i, Suhrawardi Maqtul, Fariduddin `Attar, Hafiz, and many others. However, the above
discussions have covered the major figures associated with the theme: Rabi`a and al-Hallaj are in
many ways the poetic founders of love and divine passion; al-Ghazzali and Rumi two of the most
famous exponents of love, even if not ones who emphasized the erotic; and Ibn al-Farid and Ibn
al-`Arabi the authors of some of the most sensuous and even sensual writing in all of Sufism.
