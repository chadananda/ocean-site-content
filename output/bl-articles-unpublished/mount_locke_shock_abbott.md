“[T]he intelligent, loyal Baha‟i should stress not the source,

but the importance of the idea,
and rejoice not in the originality and uniqueness of the principle
but rather in its prevalence and practicality.”1

—Alain Locke

In April of 1912 Abdu‟l Baha Abbas, “the leader of the Bahai [sic] movement for
world-wide religious unity”, was in the midst of a momentous crusade to inspire the
hearts and minds of African Americans with a message of hope, love, and redemption.2
In a nation accustomed to itinerant preachers and religious revivals, Abdu‟l Baha found
a ready audience in nearly every segment of American society. For African Americans
specifically, however, the fundamental tenants of his faith, which called for an end to all
forms of prejudice, a redistribution of wealth, and a peaceful approach to conflict
resolution, must have sounded like a heavenly symphony.3 Between April 23rd and April

30th Abdu‟l Baha spoke at the Fourth Annual NAACP Convention, the A.M.E Church‟s
Bethel Literary Society, and Howard University, all to great accolade.4 These
remarkable talks, as well as the African American responses to them, raise a number of
important questions regarding the nature of African American religion during the
Gilded Age and the difficulty of establishing historical causality from the dispersed
ideological and theological movements of the Baha‟i Faith in America.

In his public addresses, Abdu‟l Baha spoke with former slaves and the descendants
of former slaves. Many in his audiences had lived through the horrors of the Civil War5,
the great jubilee of Emancipation, and the broken promises of Reconstruction6. Most
had experienced firsthand the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and endured the violent

reassertion of Southern „home rule‟, where African American security literally
functioned as a bargaining chip to settle the disputed election between Rutherford B.
Hayes and Samuel Tilden in 1877. Nearly all had fought against the lynchings,
disenfranchisement, and open acts of injustice that had accelerated through the 1880‟s
and 1890‟s, as white Southerners worked to reasserted their power and undo the meager
gains of Reconstruction. Booker T. Washington‟s reconciliatory leadership, exemplified
by his infamous Atlanta Compromise of 1895, helped mollify the situation somewhat,
but it also permitted segregation to take hold and thereby frustrate the aspirations of
many African Americans yearning for a life beyond poverty, manual labor, and second
class citizenship.7

When Abdu‟l Baha arrived in America, he encountered an exhausted African
American community. It was a community deeply divided by class, generation, skin
tone, religious denomination, political ideology, and gendered expectations. Black
women were questioning whether or not the fight for liberation and equality would
include them as well.8 Black nationalists such as Bishop Henry McNeal Turner had

great deal of evidence exists that through T. Thomas Fortune and other radical black leaders, Washington
was secretly funding legal challenges to segregation, disenfranchisement, and higher education
discrimination even as he told white Americans that he was against such strategies. See Emma Lou

been arguing for years that a mass migration back to Africa was the only viable solution
for Americans of African descent.9 W.E.B. Du Bois was working systematically to
displace Booker T. Washington and offer a more progressive and intellectual public
response to American racism.10 White skinned and multiracial African Americans found
themselves in an increasingly uncertain position as the shifting racial boundaries of
post-Emancipation blackness were rapidly twisting and warping to remake blackness in
light of the new realities of Jim Crow segregation.11 In short, the black community was
in turbulent state of transition in 1912.

One Day in April

On April 23rd, at high noon in the nation‟s capital, Abdu‟l Baha spoke to the
students and faculty of Howard University. Later that afternoon, he went to a luncheon
and two receptions in his honor where he mingled with the city‟s elite white residents
and established relationships with Alexander Graham Bell and the minister of Turkey.

In the evening he once again addressed a predominantly black audience at the Bethel
Literary Society at the African Methodist Episcopalian Church.12

The visual and cultural mosaic of that day must have been stunning to say the
least, yet Abdu‟l Baha was clearly uncomfortable with the segregation he witnessed. At
the luncheon, held at the Persian Embassy, he rearranged the table settings and insisted
that Louis Gregory, one of the city‟s most prominent African American Baha‟is, would be
seated next to him as his guest of honor and thereby integrate an otherwise segregated
meeting. Gregory had quietly slipped away from the luncheon to avoid the
embarrassment of being openly Jim Crowed, however Abdu‟l Baha apparently went to
great lengths to insure that he was found and that the luncheon did not start without
him.13 This gesture must have certainly made some of the white diners uncomfortable,
as it was perhaps the first and only time that many of them had broken bread with a
black man. Yet this same act of resistance established that Abdu‟l Baha practiced what
he preached and that he would defy the tradition of segregation that had taken hold in
the nation‟s capital. For Gregory, this no doubt confirmed his belief in the spiritual
principles of the Baha‟i Faith and their potential to fight social injustice. However, to

what extend Gregory shared his experiences or how widely they circulated among black
Washingtonians remains uncertain.

What is known is that Abdu‟l Baha‟s message resonated profoundly with African
American observers if for no other reason than his willingness to acknowledge and value
diversity, even when there might have been very little to witness. This was clearly
evident at Howard University where he analogously referred to the largely black
audience as the “multicolored flowers” of one garden.14 Although he said that “I see
white and black sitting together” what he more than likely saw were dark skinned, light
skinned, and white skinned African Americans sitting together, all of whom made up
part of black Washington‟s educated class.15 Although a good number of Howard‟s
administrators and teachers, including its president, were white, almost all of its
students at the time had some measure of African ancestry and identified themselves as
such. In effect, many of the white bodies that Abdu‟l Baha observed were actually
multiracial African Americans.

This nuance may not have been immediately evident to Abdu‟l Baha, but his
words would never the less have spoken inadvertently to many of the crowd‟s underlying

University Press of Virginia, 1999) and Willard B. Gatewood, Aristocrats of Color : The Black Elite, 1880-
1920 (Bloomington : Indiana University Press, 1990). Included in both books is a discussion of the
complex realities of intra-racial divisions within the black community at the time.

intra-racial anxieties. While promising that eventually “differences between black and
white will be completely obliterated”16 he asserted that in many ways this process had
already taken place to a large degree by asserting, from his Eastern vantage point and
transnational perspective, that “you are like the whites; there are no great distinctions
left”.17 This statement combined with one in which he encouraged blacks and whites to
“mix together completely”18 would have rung true to many of the more radical black and
multiracial leaders present, who at the time were fighting for what was then called
„social equality‟ (or complete political, cultural, and sexual integration). At the same
time, these sentiments would have been scoffed at by the emerging black nationalists
and purveyors of a pan-African consciousness, who would in subsequent decades have
their positions more fully articulated by Marcus Garvey, W.E.B. Du Bois, and many
others.

On another level, however, Abdu‟l Baha would have played well to these same
„back to Africa‟ supporters who were worried about the idea of „absorption‟, even as he
would have connected with some of the more mainline black religious leaders who were
listening that day. In his talk Abdu‟l Baha put forward a patently Afro-Centric theology
relating to divine providence which was very similar to the one prevalent among many

African American Christians at the time. This theology attempted to explain exactly
how a righteous God would have allowed something like slavery to have ever occurred in
the first place. What emerged was a gospel of pre-destination, that also rung forcefully
from so many African American pulpits in 1912. This gospel held that Africans were
enslaved and brought to America as part of a larger divine plan to eventually bring
progress and monotheism back to the African „fatherland‟ through African American
missionaries and a mass re-colonization. Sounding like so many other preachers of this
period, Abdu‟l Baha said “[t]he blacks of Africa were in complete bondage, but your
emancipation led to their freedom.”19 As many returning black missionaries were
arguing at the time, he also observed that “if you go to Africa and see the blacks of
Africa, you will realize how much progress you have made.”20 He may have gone too far
in concluding that, as a result, African Americans “should be very grateful to the whites
of America”21 because they unknowingly expediting African American progress, but this
too was a common appeal made by black preachers at the time and represented a
compelling argument in favor of burying the hatchet while encouraging either black
migration to Africa or brotherly love and fellowship across racial divides while still in
America.22 Essentially, if everyone could be painted as an instrument of divine
providence, then hatred and bitterness were sins against the divine plan.

22   See Campbell, Middle Passages.

In his final talk of the day in front of the Bethel Literary Society, Abdu‟l Baha
continued to connect with African American interests and strike a balance between the
horrors of the past, the opportunities of the present, and the work of the future. He
compared his experiences as a prisoner under the Ottoman Empire to the generations
that African Americans spent in bondage by saying: “You do not know. I, who for forty
years have been a prisoner, do know. I do know the value and blessing of liberty. For you
have been and are now living in freedom, and you have no fear of anybody. Is there a
greater blessing than this? Freedom! Liberty! Security!”23 Certainly African Americans
did „know‟ a great deal about involuntary confinement and would have disagreed with
Abdu‟l Baha when he claimed that they were living in a state of liberty, security or
freedom which they could enjoy without fear. Yet the point was well taken and
enthusiastically applauded as if to usher in the promise of this idea that had eluded
African Americans since 1619. It was an acknowledgement of the progress made and
recognition of the opportunities currently open to African Americans that were firmly
closed a generation earlier. Although few would have agreed with Abdu‟l Baha‟s
characterization of the American government as one which “rules with impartial equity
and equality toward all” the hope that America might one day keep its promise and
fulfill this ideal was worth supporting. African Americans surly interpreted Abdu‟l
Baha‟s premature observations as an optimistic sign that change was on the horizon and

that perhaps it could be willed into being by this strange man from Persia who seemed
to care about them so deeply and see their situation in a fresh light.24

This evening talk is much more problematic for contemporary scholars than the
one given earlier at Howard because it demonstrates the wide gap between our current
scholarly ears and African American popular theology and politics of the 1910‟s. African
Americans in 1912 were a people in flux, and as such, were open to a wide variety of
strategies and perspectives provided that they were grounded in a spirit of love and
genuine fellowship. Abdu‟l Baha, by all accounts held these qualities in abundance.

The Problem of Causality

All told, how should scholars read Abdu‟l Baha‟s visit to Washington D.C.? Did
he come and go like so many other traveling evangelicals before him or did he cause a
lasting shift in African American political thought and religious ideology? Several
events indicate that his impact was significant yet much more work needs to be done in
order to fully trace the social and theological concepts that he and his small band of
American Baha‟is championed so fervently. Others might argue that this effort should
be abandoned altogether. Principle among them was the great African American Baha‟i
philosopher and founder of the Harlem Renaissance Movemen, Alain Locke. Locke
cautioned that the Baha‟i community “should stress not the source, but the importance
of the idea, and rejoice not in the originality and uniqueness of the principle but rather

24   Ibid, 49.

in its prevalence and practicality.” 25 While this may be true, an examination of the
African American reactions to Abdu‟l Baha‟s visit can still yield a great deal of valuable
insight regarding black lives in the early 20th century.

The Washington Bee, an African American newspaper run by the staunch social
critic William Calvin Chase, ran a favorable article in response to Abdu‟l Baha‟s visit that
has been widely cited by scholars.26 Going unnoticed, however, is a fascinating work of
plagiarism/creative editing which was done to this article by George L. Knox, editor of
the Indianapolis based Freeman. Knox copied large sections of the article while
„correcting‟ several spelling errors that he found in the Washington Bee including
changing “Baha movement” to “Bahai movement”, “Behai belief” to “Bahai belief”, and
“the Abdul” to “Abbas Effendi”.27 Clearly Knox was captivated at the prospects of Baha‟i
theology and had done a bit of independent research on his own before doing some
remarkable cheerleading. The most notable additions to the article found Knox
proclaiming proudly that one-third of all Persians were Baha‟is, an exaggeration meant
to lend legitimacy and excitement to the emerging faith.28 Knox, like Chase, made it a

27   Compare Washington Bee, April 27th, 1912 to Freeman, April 27th, 1912. To my knowledge this is
the first time that the Freeman article has been cited.

28   Knox likely would have gotten this figure from one of the many Western scholars hoping to
exaggerate the size of the Baha‟i faith as part of an anti-Muslim campaign. Although Knox was certainly
not aware that such a figure was overblown or for what purpose his use of it to forward anti-racist
struggles in America is ironic give the disparaging origins of these figures. See Moojan Momen, ed. The

point to claim that “quite a colony of colored Bahaists has been developed in
Washington” but he felt compelled to add that it was “finding considerable favor among
our people”. Given the willingness of white Baha‟is to open their homes to African
Americas, Knox also added that there are many “Negroes willingly [sic] to give the faith
a hearing.” The fact that African Americans “have mingled on terms of absolute
equality” with their white co-religionists was a major draw.29 In what was perhaps the
most telling discrepancy of all Knox became one of the few African Americans who
characterized the Baha‟i Faith as a separate independent religion rather than a
„movement‟. He explicitly excluded Chase‟s line that “one can be of any known religious
denomination and yet maintain good standing as a disciple of Bahai [sic].”30 In the end
both men were actively looking to sell the new faith to their respective readers and bring
new ideas into the discussion of African American civil rights, but each had competing
perspectives on what the Baha‟i Faith could and should be. To what extent their
editorial policies, perceptions of religion, or senses of sectarianism shifted as a result of
their encounter with the teachings of Abdu‟l Baha would require much more research
and may ultimately remain difficult to quantify. Ideas of universality, the oneness of
humanity, and other aspects of Baha‟i theology were already current among many

different circles that intersected with black intellectual life in the 1910‟s making
untangling such thoughts in search of causality a daunting task.

Another key document which prior scholars have ignored involves the
incomparable black leader W.E.B. Du Bois. In the month after the Fourth Annual
NAACP conference, but a month before the formal write up of the event cited by most
scholars, Du Bois devoted almost the entire body of his “Men of the Month” column to
Abdu‟l Baha.31 Adorned with a full page picture followed by a full page write up, the
article is less remarkable for what it says and more fascinating for what it is. In a
column reserved exclusively for African American accomplishments (which often
included black women) Abdu‟l Baha‟s inclusion seemed to be an obvious anomaly. The
space devoted to him relative to the other men of that month as well as those recognized
throughout that year is also striking. No other figure that Du Bois honored that year
warranted a full page article much less a full page photo. For most months, each
biographical sketch was given roughly equal space with a lucky few earning a small inset
photo. Abdu‟l Baha however dominated that month‟s section and literally pushed the
other honorees into a tiny space at the bottom of the page. This new find is perhaps the
most extensive article on the Baha‟i Faith attributed to Du Bois and given the space he

been cited.

devoted to it in his paper, his meeting with Abdu‟l Baha must have had a significant
impact on him.32

The article itself is a dry but largely accurate historical account of the life of
Abdu‟l Baha and the emergence of the Baha‟i Faith. Du Bois did take several editorial
liberties, however, that are important to examine. For Du Bois, and so many others, the
Baha‟i Faith was understood first and foremost as a “movement” which “does not ask a
Christian to cease professing Christianity.” This proved to be a powerful idea with wide
implications. The fact that the Baha‟i faith “pays little attention to dogma” was
especially attractive to Du Bois who throughout his life searched for a viable alternative
to „the black church‟ which could move African Americans in a more spiritually
progressive political direction.33 Du Bois was adamant about the fact that the Baha‟i
Faith was not a “”new religion”” but could rather be part of the wider and older African
American syncretic tradition that incorporated diverse religious perspectives into a

32   As editor it is possible that Du Bois may have had someone else within the NAACP actually write
the article, however, the quality of prose, knowledge of Christian history, and overall style indicates that
Du Bois himself was the most likely author. In these early years of the NAACP Du Bois had significantly
less help than he would have in later years and given the fact that The Crisis was less than two years old at
the time all fingers point to Du Bois as the writer. At the very least his decision as editor to devote the
space that he did to this subject speaks volumes as to the impact that his encounter with Abdu‟l Baha had
on the forty six year old Du Bois.

33   Until recently scholars have been perplexed regarding how to situate the spiritual life of Du Bois,
with most regarding him as an atheist. However, Edward Blum, W.E.B. Du Bois: Prophet (Philadelphia:
University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007) has largely debunked this theory by demonstrating that quite to
the contrary, Du Bois‟s major project was the spiritual transformation of African American lives and the
reform of „the black church‟ to reflect a more modern, rational, and politically engaged position.

concise world view that reconciled the troubled realities of being black in America. Du
Bois clearly saw in the Baha‟i Faith a theology that matched his distain for sectarian
divisions and his belief that spiritual principles should directly lead to social action. Du
Bois may have also found in the Baha‟i Faith an African American version of what
Robert Bellah later referred to as a „civil religion‟34 even as the Baha‟i Faith proper would
remain with him for many years to come.

On an organizational level the Baha‟i Faith would subsequently interact
significantly with the NAACP. Baha‟i “race amity” conventions, one of the first
conscious projects designed to promote interracial coalitions frequently included the
NAACP and its members.35 What effect this relationship had on the NAACP‟s move
from an all black organization rooted in the Niagara Movement, to its cooperation with
white activists later on in its history remains to be examined. It is clear that a number of
prominent Baha‟is were active in the leadership ranks of the NAACP and that the Baha‟i
race amity committees made joining and collaborating with the NAACP part of their
platform.36 In 1932 the Baha‟is held a banquet honoring the NAACP where Du Bois

34   Bella‟s concept essential accounts for unspoken „meta-religious‟ movements that take on a
religious fever and structure but are adopted by people of all denominations and expressed in the public
sphere. For more on Bellah‟s concept see Robert N. Bellah and Phillip H. Hammond Varieties of Civil
Religion (New York: Harper and Row, 1980) Blum, W.E.B. Du Bois, seems to follow this line of thought in
that an overarching religious framework that will provide a foundation for black unity is what Du Bois
finds himself perpetually grasping for.

spoke to the crowd and Walter White, the then head of the organization, said after the
meeting that “the Baha‟i movement” was “one of the great forces of human
understanding”.37

On a personal level Du Bois would remain connected to the Baha‟i Faith for the
remainder of his life. Du Bois would lecture at Baha‟i schools and may have been the
first person to introduce his lifelong friend Alain Locke to the teachings of Abdu‟l Baha
and the Baha‟i Faith.38 Locke would go on to become one of the most vocal African
American Baha‟is and explicitly incorporated a great many of its teachings into his work
as an activist/philosopher. When he died in 1945 Du Bois would speak at his funeral.39
In addition to Locke, Du Bois also corresponded with Louis Gregory and Chicago
Defender editor Robert Abbott, both of whom were open members of the Baha‟i faith.40

In 1936 however, Du Bois‟s connection with the Baha‟i Faith deepened
significantly when his wife Nina officially converted and became more active in the local
Baha‟i community. One year later Du Bois was publicly attempting to shape Baha‟i
policy regarding integrated meetings in Nashville as some of the local public events
appeared to „draw the color line‟ despite the fact that the official policy and general

practice of the faith dictated that all Baha‟i events were to be integrated and that black
and white members would meet together on an equal footing. For Du Bois to get
involved in such a local matter shows that he must have cared deeply about the direction
of his wife‟s new faith, perhaps more so than many of its confirmed believers.41 A few
years earlier in 1935, Du Bois himself was „accused‟ of being a Baha‟i by fellow black
communist George Streator, largely because of Du Bois‟s stance against violence.42 As
late as 1953, and after Nina‟s death, Du Bois was denied a passport by the United States
government as he was petitioning to attend a World Peace Council meeting in Budapest
and the Inter-Continental Conference of the Baha‟i Faith in New Delhi.43 Apparently
during the McCarthy Era such activities were deemed revolutionary communist threats
by the federal government, and hence, they were right up Du Bois‟s alley.

Beyond the more obvious and well documented work done on Alain Locke and
Robert Abbott, a study of this connection between W.E.B. Du Bois and Baha‟i theology is
long overdue and may open the door to some of the most important impacts that Abdu‟l
Baha may have had on the direction of African American history. Yet to precisely trace
Baha‟i theology through the infinitely complex thoughts that circulated Du Bois‟s mind,
and other African Americans generally, may prove to be an impossible task. However,

circumvent conventional religious lines and shift the collective direction American

‘The’ Black Church, The ‘Black’ Church, and The Black ‘Church’

In the end, what effect, if any, did Abdu‟l Baha‟s trip have on popular theology,
everyday African American belief , and the ongoing struggle for Civil Rights? Did his
ideas trickle down to the masses and cause any real change or did they remain confined
to black intellectuals like Du Bois, Locke, and Abbott? Many of the stumbling blocks in
approaching these questions are rooting in the idea of exactly what the so-called „black
church‟ actually is. For those outside the black community this term often becomes a
way to ghettoize African American religion and frame African Americans as a singular
mono-chromatic group with no internal diversity. For insiders, this often repeated term
is horribly misleading as it implies a single black church (rather than black churches),
an exclusively Christian perspective (as it‟s not „the black mosque‟), and the idea that
authentic black religion can only be found in black dominated (and presumably
Christian) congregations. A more appropriate way to conceptualize black religious
experience(s) is to think in terms of a „black theology‟ which can be understood as the

York: Oxford University Press, 1986) and Roger Finke and Rodney Stark, The Churching of America,

University Press, 2005).

dynamic, decentered, syncretic, and even contradictory process that individual African
Americans engage in so as to mark the spiritual coordinates of their lives and create
order out of the world around them.

Scholarship on black theology has been pulling the field in this direction for years
and has opened up a number of other questions regarding the centrality of religion
generally within the larger arc of African American history. Exactly how important was
religion to African Americans during slavery, Jim Crow, or the Civil Rights movement
and how relevant is it today? The myth of the singular, stable Christian black church as
the center of black life in America from time immemorial has already begun to crumble
in light of new evidence and new interpretations. Its legacy, however, remains burned
in the minds of both blacks and whites alike. Princeton Professor Eddie Glaude, in
bemoaning this fact, even went so far earlier this year to claim that “The Black Church is
Dead”.45 He and many others have criticized black religious practices and theology in
both the past and in the present as being a conservative force that reinforced
oppression, rather than a progressive force that advanced the struggle for liberation.46

46   See for example Barbara Diane Savage, Your Spirits Walk Beside Us: The Politics of Black
Religion (Cambridge: Belknap Press of Harvard University, 2008) which argues that black scholars who
came of age in the 1950‟s and 60‟s are largely responsible for projecting backwards the image of a strong,
progressive, activist black church as the center of African American life. Also Jonathan L. Walton Watch
This!: The Ethics and Aesthetics of Black Televangelism (New York: New York University Press, 2009 has
been critical of the patriarchy, homophobia, and conservative political platform of many contemporary
black mega churches.

In light of this new paradigm of „the black church‟, which in many ways was
ushered in by Du Bois,47 the Baha‟i faith was in a rather unique position in the early 20th
century. Prior to Du Bois‟s critique of the Nashville meetings Du Bois believed that
”[o]nly the Baha‟i were left” among the available black religious options because they
refused to compromise their radical position against segregation and remained
committed to fundamental social change.48 If the Baha‟i faith were understood by
scholars today as a „movement‟ as opposed to a „religion‟, just as it was by African
American observers at the time, than its influence may be easier to trace. Rather than
focus on the number of African American Baha‟is, which was always tiny, a study of the
organizational patterns, general principles, and strategic tactics of the Baha‟is can help
locate more precisely to what extent Baha‟i theology influenced everyday people and
shaped change in mainline African American congregations. This approach is not novel
and has been applied to the religious elements of Garveyism, Rastafai, and the Nation of
Islam which are numerically small but disproportionately significant in shaping African
American theology.49

49   The idea that black ideology remains decentered while incorporating often competing ideas was
explored in Melissa Harris-Lacewell, Barbershops, Bibles, and BET: Everyday Talk and Black Political
Thought. (Princeton University Press: Princeton, 2004). For early the impact of Islam on black religion

In the end, Abdu‟l Baha‟s efforts among African Americans might best be viewed
on his own terms. He said upon his arrival that“[i]t is my purpose to set forth in
America the fundamental principles of the revelation and teachings of Baha‟u‟llah. It
will then become the duty of the Bahais of this country to give these principles
unfoldment and application in the minds, hearts and lives of the people”.50 In other
words, Abdu‟l Baha saw himself as a prophetic voice of change that was not trying to
raise money or win converts but spark a movement. That movement was to be carried
forward by American Baha‟is, both black and white. Rather than fall into a limiting
paradigm such as the one entrapping „the black church‟, Abdu‟l Baha took a wider, more
inclusive, and even post-modern stance towards „membership‟ stating that“[y]ou can be
a Bahá'í-Christian, a Bahá'í-Freemason, a Bahá'í-Jew, a Bahá'í-Muhammadan” while the
community should “not distress or deny anyone by saying 'He is not a Bahá'í!' He will be
known by his deeds.”51 In terms of what constituted a Baha‟i he was equally as broad
saying: “He is a true Bahá'í who strives by day and by night to progress along the path of
human endeavor, whose cherished desire is to live and act so as to enrich and illumine
the world; whose source of inspiration is the essence of Divine Perfection, whose aim in
life is to conduct himself so as to be the cause of infinite progress. Only when he attains

unto such perfect gifts can it be said of him that he is a Bahá'í."52 Gendered pronouns
aside, nearly every African American in 1912 would have said “Amen” to that.
