  Achieving Planetary Consciousnss; Reality, Reason, and

Revelation.

William S. Hatcher

There are at least two fundamental ways of seeing the
relationship between a whole and its parts. One way sees the whole
as the sum of its parts (an explicit axiom of Euclid) and thus seeks
to understand systems (wholes) by understanding each component
(part) of the system. This is the tradition of Western thought,
beginning with Greek atomism and ending with modern physics,
which sees each physical system as a more-or-less complex
configuration of elementary particles. In this view of reality, the
worth or value of a system is almost directly proportional to its
complexity.

Complex systems frequently have a modular structure, in
which larger components of the system are themselves systems
formed from smaller components. Modularity of structure allows
for extreme specialization and individuation of the components of
a system, while still maintaining the integrity of the system as a
whole.

A typical (and in some ways prototypical) example of a
modular system is the overall structure of the human body, which
is a complex configuration of maybe a trillion cells. The modular
organization of the body is reflected in the fact that the body's
cells are not uniform, but highly specialized, where similarly
specialized cells are grouped to form tissues, similar tissues form
organs, similar organs form systems and the body itself is formed
from the interaction of its sytems. Many social and political
systems, especially in the West, also exhibit a modular structure.

There are both advantages and disadvantages to modular
organization. The advantages are solidity, stability and the
emergence, in extremely complex systems, of higher-order
properties of the system, i.e., properties of the whole that do not
exist in the parts. For example, the human body has the property
of autonomous locomotion, but an individual cell or organ does
not have this property. The disadvantages, especially in relation to
modular social systems, are rigidity, stratification (e.g, social and
economic classes), pyramidal, top-down authoritarianism, and a
tendency to overspecialization or overindividualization of the
components with resulting fragmentation, competition and
conflict.

The understanding of a whole by an exhaustive analysis of its
parts has, beginning with Descartes, led to modern science. But it

has also led to mechanism and materialism. The reasoning is
simple: since God is clearly not present in the parts (i.e., the
elementary particles) then He cannot be present in the whole since
the whole is just the sum of its parts. Thus, either God does not
exist at all or else He exists only metaphorically as a higher-order
property of complex systems.

One can, of course believe, as Descartes did, that there is a
spiritual realm of existence parallel to the realm of physical
systems. But from the Cartesian viewpoint, this "other world" has
no real explanatory value or relevance to the operation of material
systems. In other words, if it makes us feel better, we may choose
to believe that such a realm of spirit exists, but when it comes to
undertanding the dynamics of a physical or social system, the
spiritual realm is seen as essentially irrelevant. This is the famous
Cartesian duality, which holds that the observable world can be
explained in itself without reference to spiritual reality.

There is, however, another way of seeing the relationship
between whole and part, one which gives rise to the notion of a
distributed system, i.e., a system in which the whole is contained
or reproduced within each part. In such a system, there is no
individuality of the components; rather, each component is a
representative of the whole.

The (proto)typical example of a distributed system is the
human brain: Any given (neuronal) brain cell can assume any
brain function and is thus a reflection of the brain as a whole.
Indeed, it is now known that such mental functions as perception
and memory are not localized in any specific part of the brain but
are instantiated in a series of clichés by electroform waves,
emitted by the thalamus, that sweep the entire brain at regular
intervals of extemely short duration. This operational distribution
gives optimal flexibility to brain functioning, but exists only
because the brain is part of the modularly organized system of the
entire body (in which, for example, the vital needs of brain cells
are provided by the body's circulatory system). At the same time,
the functioning of the modularly organized body is harmonized
and unified only because it is directed by the distributively
organized brain. Thus, both modular and distributed systems are
needed, and the optimal functioning of each type of system
depends on the other.

The fact that both modular and distributed systems are
reconciled in the reality of the individual human being suggests
that the evolution of authentic planetary consciousness may lie in
a similar reconciliation of our views of the human social and
spiritual reality. Indeed, the modular view of reality is
fundamentally linear, whereas the distributive paradigm is
nonlinear. The complementarity between modular and distributed

system thus offers a striking parallel with the current dialogue
between linearity and non-linearity that is so central to modern
systems theory. There is also a striking parallel with the
complementarity of science and religion. Let us examine this in
more detail.

Beginning with simple observations, science builds upwards
towards more general and abstract descriptions of reality by
incorporating isolated observations into an overall theoretical
framework. In applying this method, science is deliberately
minimalist in its theorizing __ avoiding gratuitous postulation of
nonobservable entities __ and deliberately exact in its language __
insisting that every word or term have only one logical meaning.
This latter condition, especially, gives an essential linearity to
scientific language.

The original goal of science was, by persistent application of
this method, to arrive at an exact, quantitative, and complete
description of reality, thereby obviating the necessity for recourse
to more metaphorical, qualitative, and nonlinear descriptions.
However, the very pursuit of exactness in science has led to the
startling conclusion that exactness and completeness are, in
principle, incompatible: such scientifically established principles as
Heisenberg indeterminancy and Gödel incompleteness have shown
conclusively that there cannot ever exist an exact and complete
description of reality in human language.

Thus, the success of scientific method in generating exact
descriptions of various portions of reality has also shown that no
exact description of total reality exists, and consequently that the
original goal of modern science is inachievable. Science must be
content with generating a multiplicity of exact, but partial
descriptions of reality, much as we would shine a powerful
flashlight in different directions on a dark night.1

In other words, objective reality is intrinsically and
fundamentally nonlinear. Science can, in principle give us an exact,
linearized description of any given part of reality, but never of the
whole. Moreover, our experience of scientific method has shown
that the same portion of reality can give rise to several different
linearized descriptions or models. For example, cell biology and
particle physics give two completely different linearized
descriptions of the single nonlinear reality that is the human body.

Thus, by pursuing its initial programme of exactness and
linearization, science has succeeded in establishing conclusively
the nonlinear character of reality. The methodological
consequence of this discovery has been the increasing use of
qualitative methods in science. Indeed, in many instances the
explicit, quantitative solution of even a simple system of nonlinear
differential equations is not only extremely difficult (if not

impossible) but in fact may hardly yield more useful information
than does the qualitative analysis of the phase-space portrait of the
system.

Turning, now, to a consideration of revealed religion, and to
the Bahá'í Revelation in particular, we find first of all that the
Bahá'í Writings clearly affirm the nonlinear character of reality.
Indeed, it was our colleague Erwin Laszlo who first pointed out that
Bahá'u'lláh articulated these insights in the late 19th century, well
before they were rediscovered by scientists such as Prigogine in the
1970's and 80's.

But in fact the Bahá'í Writings go further and affirm that the
language of revelation is complementary to the language of science
precisely in that revelation is a complete (but of course nonlinear)
description of reality. In other words, revealed religion is not
simply a redundant rearticulation in poetical terms of some of the
insights of science: it is in itself a complete, nonlinear description
of the structure of reality. Revelation is thus maximalist and top-
down rather than minimalist and bottom-up like science. Here are
some of the passages in which             Bahá'u'lláh describes this
characteristic of His Revelation.

Every single letter proceeding from Our mouth is endowed
> with such regenerative power as to enable it to bring into
> existence a new creation __ a creation the magnitude of
which       is inscrutable to all save God. He verily hath knowledge
of all      things. It is in Our power, should We wish it . . . to
infuse into        every letter such a force as to empower it to
unfold all the     knowledge of past and future ages.2

Within the treasury of Our Wisdom there lies unrevealed a
> knowledge, one word of which, if we chose to divulge it to
> mankind, would cause every human being to recognize the
> Manifestation of God and to acknowledge His omniscience,
> would enable every one to discover the secrets of all the
> sciences, and to attain so high a station as to find himself
> wholly independent of all past and future learning.3

That Bahá'u'lláh is speaking objectively and not in metaphorical
hyperbole is made clear by such passages as the following:

Know thou, moreover, that the Word of God __ exalted be
His   glory __ is higher and far superior to that which the senses

> can perceive, for it is sanctified from any property or
> substance. It transcendeth the limitations of known elements
and is exalted above all the essential and recognized

> substances. . . . It is God's all-pervasive grace, from which all
> grace doth emanate. It is an entity far removed above all
> that hath been and shall be.4

Further, with regard to the completeness of His Revelation,
Bahá'u'lláh has said, for example:

Know assuredly that just as . . . the Word of God . . .
endureth for ever, . . . its meaning can never be exhausted.5

It is important to stress here that, in spite of these and other strong
statements which Bahá'u'lláh makes concerning the scope and
power of His Revelation, He nevertheless taught that both science
and religion are God-ordained sources of truth and that neither is
alone sufficient for the achievement of planetary consciousness.
Bahá'u'lláh stressed that Reality is one, that its laws are objective,
and that a truly integrated worldview can emerge only through the
creative dialogue between the linear exactness of science and the
nonlinear completeness of revelation.6

Indeed, we should reflect that what we normally call progress
does not represent a change in objective reality but rather a
change in our human awareness of the structure of reality: the
laws of aerodynamics or electromagnetism have existed
throughout the history of mankind. But it is only through the
discipline of scientific method that we have, in the modern period,
become aware of these laws. In the same way, the power inherent
in divine revelation has always existed, but, for our own good, God
has ordained that this power be available to us only through the
application of an appropriate spiritual and intellectual discipline.
Though this discipline is essentially scientific in nature, as Shoghi
Effendi has often stressed, it nonetheless has certain specific
features related to the differences between the linear exactness of
science and the nonlinear completeness of revelation.

I believe the time has now come when we must deliberately
and consciously develop this disciplined approach to the study of
the Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh if we are to make any substantial
further progress in our evolution towards true planetary
consciousness. Such a discipline is necessary to "decompress" or
"linearize" the profound insights contained in the Bahá'í Writings,
thereby making them available to practical application.

The urgent necessity for such a fresh approach to the
challenges currently facing humanity has been aptly described by
the Universal House of Justice in its recent statement on The
Prosperity of Humankind. We therefore conclude with a brief
citation from that document:

Since, then, the challenge is the empowerment of
humankind           through a vast increase in access to knowledge,
the strategy        that can make this possible must be constructed
around an ongoing and intensifying dialogue between science and

> religion. . . . nothing less than insights generated by the
> creative interaction of the scientific and religious systems of
> knowledge can produce so fundamental a reorientation of
> habits and attitudes.7
