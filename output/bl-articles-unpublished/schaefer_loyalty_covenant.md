At a seminar held in 1999, organized by the National Youth Committee and
European Counselors for young academics in our community, it became
evident that there are still uncertainties about the fundamentals of our faith,
especially concerning the relationship between reason and revelation, reason
and belief, and that strong sentiments come to the fore in any discourse on
this subject. This was sufficient motivation for me to present a few thoughts
in the pages that follow.

1. The foundation of our faith, our thoughts and intellectual endeavors, is
the Covenant of God, established by Bahá’u’lláh, and embodied in his
scripture, as well as the authoritative interpretations by ‘Abdu’l-Baha- and
Shoghi Effendi. Firmness and loyalty to the Covenant and obedience to the
holy writings and the institutions of the community form the basis for our
entire religious life. Loyalty to the testimony of our faith is the prerequisite
for any intellectual reflection.

2. Faith, our encounter with God’s Word and the subordination of our life
to its demands, has a variety of dimensions.

a) In the first instance, faith is an affair of the heart, the emotional bond to
Baha-’u’lla-h, a love for God, on which our entire existence is based. This
emotional dimension gives birth to our dedication to the Cause of Baha-’u’lla-
h, to our strength to keep the Commandments,1 and to our readiness to bear
witness to our faith, spread the teachings, and guide our fellowmen to the path

-
of God. According to the Kita-b-i-Iqa-n2, the heart is the seat of our conscience
and of reason. It is the “dwelling place” of God mentioned in the Hidden
Words, where the heart is mentioned no fewer than forty-five times.

When recognizing spiritual mysteries, the heart is engaged,3 but so is the
intellect.4 It is the heart that needs to be “purified”.5 Purity of heart is the
absolute demand of all religions.6 When faith fades away, the heart becomes
“lifeless”.7 The heart refers to the whole person, with all its religious feelings,
thoughts and actions. Without the bond of the heart a spiritual life is not
possible.

b) But faith is not an affair of the heart alone, it is equally one of the
intellect, reason, and critical thought:

> Man . . . hath been endowed with reason … 8 to enable His creature
> to know and recognize God—exalted be His glory.9

‘Aql (reason, rationality, intellect) is the reflection of the original celestial
reason (al-‘aql al-awwal) which is identical to the logós10. In the scripture
human reason is called “the greatest sign of God”:11

> Praise and thanksgiving be unto Providence that out of all the
> realities in existence He has chosen the reality of man and has
> honored it with intellect and wisdom, the two most luminous lights
> in either world.12

The rational faculty should be regarded “as a sign of the revelation of Him
Who is the sovereign Lord of all”:13

> First and foremost among these favors, which the Almighty hath
> conferred upon man, is the gift of understanding [‘aql].14

‘Aql is the gift that differentiates man from the animal and without which an
ethical and responsible life is impossible, because ethics mean to subordinate
our emotions, passions and inclinations to the rule of reason. The rank, which
the power of reason occupies in the religious system brought by Baha-’u’lla-h
is made clear in the talks of ‘Abdu’l-Baha-:

> God has endowed man with intelligence and reason…. If religious
> beliefs and opinions are found contrary to the standards of science,
> they are mere superstitions and imagination15 . . . If religious belief
> and doctrine is at variance with reason, it proceeds from the limited
> mind of man and not from God; therefore, it is unworthy of belief
> and not deserving of attention … How can man believe that which he
> knows to be opposed to reason? . . . Can the heart accept that which
> reason denies? Reason is the first faculty of man, and the religion of
> God is in harmony with it.16

3. It is dangerously reductionist—almost a dismemberment of our faith—
to portray rational thought and the qualities of the heart, rationality and
spirituality as opposites, and to identify critical thinking with an absence of
spirituality. There is widespread skepticism—one might almost call it a
profound mistrust—within the Baha-’i- community, which has been directed at
critical thinking. This is a serious prejudice, harmful to the faith.

I know only too well whereof I speak. Over a period of five decades, I
have had repeated, painful experiences with the anti-intellectualism in our
community.17 I am aware that there are others, engaged in similar cerebral
activity, and who are also struggling against this tide. This attitude has taken
even deeper root in the past decades under the influence of “New Age” and
similar esoteric tendencies, which tend to see the human intellect as being
responsible for a science and technology that are threatening our very
existence.

While this attitude is not often articulated, the constant emphasis on
spirituality and “having a heart that is on fire” manifests a certain aversion to
intellectual engagement with our holy texts. Without saying so, there are Baha-
’i-s who regard the engagement in Baha-’i- studies as something more or less
unspiritual. Sometimes those who do this work are told to “get down off their
high horse”. This is unacceptable.
When one reads appeals in Baha-’i- news magazines for the believers to “teach
from the heart, to be inflamed”—as if all one has to do is to make up one’s
mind and push a button—it means in plain language that we do not want
discourse and rational, systematic teaching, but rather an emotional sharing of
the message that appeals to feelings alone. Strangely enough, it is called
“teaching work.” “What do you feel,” an institute facilitator asked the
participants of a study group, after texts of Baha-’u’lla-h had been read. She
seemed to be searching for “feelings,” reminiscent of some foaming jacuzzi of
emotions, into which one can let oneself drop in a state of utter relaxation,
instead of thinking, which can be strenuous and exhausting. In some circles,
critical thinking is equated with lacking faith, with being spiritually weak.
Critical discourse is misinterpreted as “idle disputation.”18

17   This is obviously a world-wide phenomenon in Baha-’i- communities. Peter Khan writes “… I

> saw around me ... in both Australia and the United States, a number of very capable and sincere
> people who severed their connection with the Faith because of their exposure to this narrow line
> of thinking. Even here in the Holy Land, one does occasionally see this line of thinking
> appearing in disguise from time to time ... We must always be on our guard against this crypto
> fundamentalist thinking, which can lead us into error through a narrow approach to the writings
> and to the centrality of the Creative word“ (“Some Aspects of Baha-’i- Scholarship”, in The
> Journal of Baha-’i- Studies 9.4, December 1999, p. 47).

18   Kita-b-i-Aqdas, verses 177 and 77.

One can, of course, live one’s faith in a purely contemplative manner,
without rational, systematic reflection. It is up to the individual. But many of
Baha-’u’lla-h’s writings deal with philosophical and theological issues that are
as old as the world. Personally, I find it difficult to imagine how one can
penetrate to the depth of a revelation which answers such philosophical
questions, without engaging in such reflection and searching. What does
‘Abdu’l-Bahá mean when he says that religion needs “the power of
reflection”?19 Theological reflection is a matter of mind:

> When we read the Book of God, the faculty of comprehension by
> which we form conclusions, is reason. Reason is mind.20

And it is hard for me to see how the Cause of God can spread and be taken
seriously, as long as one treats discursive thought21 with contempt. Why
would Baha-’u’lla-h have given high praise to “the learned in Baha-” and have
exhorted us to hold them in honor.22

The question also arises how the Faith can be defended against criticism
and attacks, when rational thinking and argument are treated with contempt.
Baha-’u’lla-h calls upon “all men, each according to his ability, to refute the
arguments of those that have attacked the faith of God.”23 However,
arguments can only be advanced in a rational manner, and how is that
possible without a systematic, analytical approach to, and exploration of the
holy texts?

The degree to which some Baha-’i-s regard their faith as a matter of
feelings alone, regarding critical thought as a danger, was demonstrated by
the reaction of a young law student, who, despite her well trained mind, broke
down and cried when she learned that the recently published book Making the
Crooked Straight,24 raised the question whether the infallibility of the
Universal House of Justice had immanent limits, and if so, what are those

19   Paris Talks 44:15.
20   ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 22.
21   Rational thought based on logic and reasoning.
22   see Kita-b-i-Aqdas, verse 173. The learned in Bahá’: al-‘ulamá’ fi’l bahá’. The Arabic term

> ‘ulamá’ (from ‘ilm=knowledge) denotes those who know, who are qualified by their knowledge.
> In the Bahá’í community there are no formal criteria for becoming one of the “learned”, or a
> scholar of the Faith. The only qualification is deep knowledge of the Cause. Academic studies or
> exams are not required, but rather a deep knowledge of the faith and of religious history, which
> includes the ability to engage in and understand philosophical-theological discourse. This does

limits. She remarked afterwards that religion is a matter of feelings, and she
had just reacted emotionally to the book.

It is a serious misunderstanding, one with far-reaching implications, to
think that faith should be founded solely on feelings. This leaves souls open to
be preyed upon by charismatic charlatans, who will confuse and lead them
astray. Surely, there is a reason why the Covenant breaking followers of
Mason Remey, despite their fallacious arguments, managed to win over a
considerable number of people. Faith that has not been reflected upon is
easily shaken. On the other hand, reflection and critical discussion of the
contradictions that exist between the teachings of the Faith and the ideas of a
purely secular world, will reveal to the believers irrefutable insights, which
are essential when one is faced with or must stand up to attacks, whether from
within or without. Faith, which is based on intuitive and rational reflection,
and which perseveres in the forum of reason25 is also a mighty bulwark
against baseless criticism, and the tendency of many to trivialize the Baha-’i-
teachings, by mixing them up with certain fashionable psychological trends,
of dubious origin.

4. The high value placed upon rational thought in the Baha-’i- revelation is
proven by the fact that among the key virtues of the Baha-’i- ethic is h.ikma
which in western tradition stands for wisdom26 and prudence. These so-called
dianoëtic virtues are virtues of the mind, of correct thought. The prerequisite
for correct action is correct thought, which, incidentally, is also one of the
elements of the eight-fold noble path of the Buddha.27

5. This may be so self-evident that it does not require further clarification.

However, I would like to refer the reader to the many statements by Shoghi
Effendi which may be found in Crisis and Victory and in his instructions
about teaching. Here is one such quotation:

> If Baha-’i-s really wish to succeed in teaching the Cause, they will
> have to become much better informed to enable them to discuss
> today’s situation and world problems with intelligence and
> knowledge. In other words: We Baha-’i-s should arm our intelligence
> with knowledge in order to better explain the verities of our faith,
> especially to the educated….God has given man a rational power to
> be used and not killed.28

25   See ‘Abdu’l-Baha- , Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 63.
26   In Greek: Sophia and phrónesis, in Latin: sapientia and prudentia, in German Weisheit and

> Klugheit. In English translations of Baha-’i- scripture h.ikma is mostly translated by wisdom.

Prudence is practical wisdom, applied wisdom.

Buddhism, London 1970, p. 28).

One argument that is often used in discussions about the value of reason, is
that theological knowledge is really nothing but a veil that separates us from

-
“true knowledge.” One often hears people quote the verse from the Kita-b-i-I
qa-n: that “knowledge is the most grievous veil between man and his Creator”,
or refer to “idle pursuits”, or the criticism in the writings about “sciences that
begin with words and end with words.”29 But such arguments miss the point.
This was precisely what Ficicchia, a Swiss Covenant-Breaker, did when he
tried to demonstrate the alleged hostility of the Bahá’í Faith to science. I have
refuted his argument at some length in the book Making the Crooked Straight
to which I refer.30

Some people take pains to point out that knowledge, which Shoghi
Effendi calls “the best armament” for any encounter with opponents of the
faith, is liable to seduce us into an attitude of pride. Who can deny that this
danger exists? The so-called superbia theologorum, the pride of theologians,
is legendary. But arrogance and pride are to be condemned as cardinal sins in
all situations of life, not just in the field of theological research. A critical
discourse must take place in a spirit of true humility, but at the same time with
complete intellectual honesty. No one should be expected to sacrifice his
intellect.31 Whoever harbors resentment against critical thinking, and who for
this reason criticizes intellectuals for being proud, fails to recognize that there
is also such a thing as spiritual pride, when those who regard themselves as
living in the upper stratosphere of the spirit, feel superior to those whom they
see as the dwellers in the lower realms of critical thought.
6\. It would foolish, indeed, to deny that rational thinking has its dangers.
Thinking has always been regarded as dangerous. For just this reason it is
hated and feared by dictators. “He thinketh too much; such people are
dangerous,” says Caesar, in Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar. Moreover, thinking
does not guarantee truth. Despite sincere intellectual effort, one may still
come to wrong conclusions, for “to err is human.” Are we not, therefore,
justified in being concerned that asking critical questions might sew the seeds
of doubt in the hearts of those who are not firm in their faith?

In answer to this question it must be pointed out that nothing on earth is
without risk. Greater risk is perhaps attached to human thought than to
anything else. But one cannot accept the alternative, which is to renounce
critical inquiry. The following amazing statement has been ascribed to the
great Islamic theologian Al-Ghazali:

-
29   Kita-b-i-Iqa-n, Tablets 5:15, 11:8; Kita-b-i-Aqdas, verse 77.
30   See pp. 289ff.
31   An attitude which is called sacrificium intellectus in theology.

He who thinks about his faith and comes to the wrong conclusion,
> deserves a reward. He who thinks about his faith and arrives at the
> truth, deserves a double reward.

This quote is remarkable, because it says that the mere effort to think about
faith is worth rewarding. Moreover, it implies that error is unavoidable. And
are we to hold to any less a standard than that of Islam in the Middle Ages?
We must not forget that we have entered the age of reason and enlightenment
and that we must be able to explain our faith rationally to an unbelieving
world. After all, Baha-’u’lla-h revealed Himself to a humanity who had
“attained the stage of maturity.”32

Whenever one thinks about, or discusses questions of faith, there will
always be things expressed that are either right or wrong, and there is no harm
in saying the wrong thing, because we can be certain that sooner or later the
truth will emerge. Critical discourse must weigh everything in the balance,
and with the help of the abundant guidance from the revelation, and the clash
of differing opinions, will come the spark of truth. What ‘Abdu’l-Baha- told us
about consultation, that truth emerges “only after the clash of differing
opinions”, applies especially to theological discourse. I strongly recommend
the study of ‘Abdu’l-Baha-’s political treatise The Secret of Divine Civilization
to those who insist on disparaging critical thinking. It is a potent antidote
against narrow-mindedness, self-righteousness and fundamentalist tendencies.

7. In critical discourse, we must follow the practice of Ulysses as he
navigated through the narrows, staying well clear of the sea monster Scylla on
one shore, and Charybdis on the other, both of whom threatened to devour
him. We must steer a course down the middle.

One danger is that an ultra-conservative attitude, mistrustful of any critical
thought, makes unjust claims to interpretative authority and strives to
maintain everything the way it is, by disallowing critical questions and by
‘keeping the lid on.’ Such a fundamentalist stance attempts to disallow critical
questions from being asked, and holds back the development of the Cause of
Baha-'u'lla-h in a sectarian manner. Not only does it prevent its natural
unfoldment, but is partly responsible when intellectuals feel repressed, begin
to rebel, and end up throwing the baby out with the bath water, as can be
witnessed in certain Internet discussion groups. On the other hand, there is the
danger of a mentality that does not take God’s revelation seriously, but which
is oriented to what is currently in vogue and by a positivistic methodology,
seeing everything as relative and open to question.

32   Gleanings 33:2; see also Kita-b-i-Aqdas 149.

While we have to be scientific in our methods, it must be clear that the
revelation of Baha-’u’lla-h remains our point of reference. When we
systematically explore this revelation, we are not scientists but theologians.33
A theologian is not merely a student of religion; he is committed to his faith.
He who pursues religious studies just for their own sake, as l’art pour l’art
(art for art’s sake), so to speak, and sacrifices his spiritual ties and
commitment to the revelation on the altar of studies, offers no benefits, but
only causes damage.

8. Truth—and statements claimed to be true—must be made evident, and
justified by logic, as in the following examples:

a) The view has been voiced that ‘Abdu’l-Baha- was not infallible because
he never declared that he was infallible, is erroneous in view of the station
conferred on him in both the Kita-b-i-Aqdas and the Kita-b-i-‘Ahd. A teaching
authority only makes sense when it is infallible, when truth is fixed in a
binding manner. Otherwise there would be no authority at all and everyone
could be his own “Pope”. However, it is permissible to ask what is the scope
of ‘Abdu’l-Baha-’s infallibility, how far it extends and when it began. There
are believers who are distressed and raise their eyebrows when such a
question is asked. But consider the following: in the Kita-b-i-Aqdas34 and the
Tablet of Ishra-qa-t35, Baha-’u’lla-h reserves “essential infallibility” for the
Manifestations of God alone. Since ‘Abdu’l-Baha- was not a Manifestation of
God, he can only have a conferred infallibility. God can confer infallibility on
any one he chooses.36 When did this happen? Was it at the time of Abdu’l-
Baha’s birth, or at the time he was designated Center of the Covenant, or at
the time of the passing of Baha-’u’lla-h? If the latter was the case, it would
have far reaching implications for ‘Abdu’l-Baha-’s writings prior to that event.
His lofty rank as Sirrulla-h, the “Perfect Exemplar of His Teachings”37 weighs
heavily in the balance when addressing this question. In any event, these are
legitimate questions that require reflection and for which an answer must be
found, not just because we ourselves want to have an answer, but for purposes
of apologetics38, when people in the future will have to be given answers to
these obvious questions. Apologetics are the rational safeguard of faith. The
faith should be explained to others as rationally as necessary and possible.
Certain objections should be anticipated and answers prepared well in

33   I refer to my article “Baha-’i- Apologetics?”, in: Baha-’i- Studies Review, vol. 10 (2001/2002),

pp. 88f.

34   Verse 47.
35   Cf. Tablets 8:17-19.
36   See Tablets 8;17; Some Answered Questions 45:3.
37   Shoghi Effendi, World Order, p. 134.
38   The field of reasoned defence or vindication.

advance. Considerable thought must be employed to find the answers for a
wide variety of open questions.

b) The support by so-called liberal Baha-’i-s of homosexual groups in
which Baha-’i-s cultivate their homosexual identities, as has occurred in the
United States, is extreme. It is a source of amazement to me how any Baha-’i-
can allow himself to so flagrantly violate the unambiguous instructions in the
scripture,39 such as that in an unpublished Tablet of Baha-’u’lla-h, in which he
unequivocally condemns homosexual acts.40

Such individuals seem to be guided more by the zeitgeist41 than the
teachings of the Faith, as they disregard Baha-’u’lla-h’s explicit warning:

> Weigh not the Book of God with such standards and sciences as are
> current amongst you, for the Book itself is the unerring Balance
> established amongst men. In this most perfect Balance whatsoever
> the peoples and kindreds of the earth possess must be weighed, while
> the measure of its weight should be tested according to its own
> standard, did ye but know it.42

This example shows how necessary it is to think clearly in order to be
able to translate the imperatives of our Baha’i ethic into action.

c) The question about the immanent limits of the infallibility conferred on
the Universal House of Justice43 is entirely legitimate, and must be discussed
without questioning the fundamental loyalty of the person who raises it. The
discussion of this question is an act of practical wisdom, of prudence, and it is
imperative that we think about it seriously, before outsiders pick up this
theme and begin to ask probing questions.

39   See Kita-b-i-Aqdas 107, Note 134.
40   “Ye are forbidden to commit adultery [zina-’], sodomy [liwa-t.] and lechery [khi- ya-nah]. Avoid

41   “The spirit of times”.
42   Kita-b-i-Aqdas 99.
43   I refer to my article “Infallible Institutions?”, in: Baha-’i- Studies Review, London, vol. 9

(1999/2000), pp. 22-45.

d) Another issue which has caused irritation concerns the issue of whether
the Guardian’s translations of Baha-’i- texts are open to re-translation. Even if
the answer to this question were to be negative, it is still legitimate to raise it.

Any concerns about competing translations probably stem from the fact
that Shoghi Effendi occupied a position of doctrinal authority. He was the
authoritative interpreter of the holy texts. To fulfill this function the gift of
infallibility was conferred upon him. To translate something means in effect
to make an interpretation, since one has first to decide the meaning of a
particular text before one can find an adequate equivalent in another language.
From this it could be deduced that Shoghi Effendi’s existing translations are
perfect and cannot be improved.

However, considering the fact that Shoghi Effendi discussed translations
with competent linguists (especially with George Townshend), and
occasionally revised texts which he had already published in English, such
translations cannot be considered to be fully and in every aspect the
outpouring of “authoritative interpretation”. The Guardian’s English syntax is
not binding and is not covered by the charisma of infallibility. Neither is the
choice of each word from a wide spectrum of acceptable alternatives. When

-
Baha’u’llah says, in the Kita-b-i-Iqa-n, that every word has seventy meanings,44
one cannot reduce any word and fix it to a single meaning once and for all,
simply because Shoghi Effendi chose to translate it in one particular way in a
particular context. This does not, of course, negate the fact that the Guardian’s
use of certain recurring key words, which he consistently translated in the
same way, will probably always be accepted, just as all his translations from
the original texts will have a critical function forever.

If the entire primary literature translated by Shoghi Effendi were the
emanation of his infallible station, it would be “perfect”, in that it would be
identical to the original texts, without the slightest deviation. This is hard to
imagine, since any translation, even the very best, is purchased at the cost of
some of the original meaning. This is why the Muslim world never
encouraged translations of the Qur’an and why they called such translations
not “translations”, but “explanation” or “commentary”.
Shoghi Effendi never claimed perfection for his translations. Moreover,
his preface to the English edition of the Kita-b-i-Iqa-n would seem to indicate
that other translations may follow:

> This is one more attempt to introduce to the West, in language
> however inadequate, the book of unsurpassed pre-eminence among
> the writings of the Author of the Baha-’i- Revelation. The hope is that

44   para 283.

it may assist others in their efforts to approach what must always be
> regarded as the unattainable goal – a befitting rendering of Baha-’-
u’lla-h’s matchless utterance.

The announcement of the first English edition of the Kita-b-i-Iqa-n makes this
even clearer, when it says of the Guardian:

> He hopes that this new rendering will be an improvement of the
> previous one, but he fully admits that it is far from perfect, far from
> the original itself.45

e) It is equally legitimate to ask questions about our electoral system.

Apart from the rules governing the election of the Universal House of Justice
which have been set down in the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Baha-, the
entire modus operandi was introduced by Shoghi Effendi, at a time when our
law giver, the Universal House of Justice, did not yet exist. Shoghi Effendi,
who himself had no legislative power, has expressly referred these rules and
regulations to the future House of Justice.46 The system allows and requires
further development. It seems evident that our current system cannot be the
final word, when one imagines a time when a country has hundreds of
thousands, even millions of believers.

9\. Finally, it should be pointed out that unity in the teachings and unity of the
community does not mean uniformity in explaining the revealed word. A
variety of opinion is not only permitted but, according to the Universal House
of Justice, desirable.47 When Baha-’u’lla-h says that the word of God has
seventy meanings, we must be careful not to insist that our personal
interpretation is binding on everyone else.

10. What we urgently need is an atmosphere of tolerance, an ability to
listen to other opinions. Baha-’u’lla-h cautions us:

> Be forbearing one with another48 . . . It behoveth, likewise, the loved
> ones of God to be forbearing towards their fellow-men,49

and further,

> … the beloved of the one true God, [should] not … view with too

approach such sayings and writings in a spirit of open-mindedness
and loving sympathy.50

This spirit of open-mindedness and loving sympathy cannot be reconciled
with an attitude which immediately cuts down any critical thought with the
accusation of Covenant breaking. It is entirely unacceptable that statements or
questions—no matter how wrong they may be—are beaten to death with the
ominous remark “this has Covenantal implications.” We must be careful not
to introduce a principle of Islamic shari-‘a law in an effort to exclude dissident
believers, by declaring them to be takfi-r.51 The label takfi-r was used as a club
to silence those, who did not follow the traditional interpretation of the
‘Ulama-’. A Muslim scholar, Jahiz, living in the eleventh century, wrote:

> The piety of the ‘Ulama-’ consists in blackening as infidels those who
> hold another opinion.52

There is a growing tendency in the Baha-’i- community to allude to
“covenantal implications”, when issues are raised, which have not yet been
openly discussed, or if an opinion is voiced that deviates from the common
understanding in the community.

One thing we must guard against like the plague and that is the attitude,
which once drove early Christians to brand anyone a heretic as soon as he
voiced a different opinion, and then to excommunicate and persecute him.
This terrible practice corroded the spirit of Christian faith and paved the way
for the Inquisition. Baha-’u’lla-h condemned nothing so much as religious
fanaticism, which He called “a world-devouring fire”, a “desolating afflict-
ion”53. We must beware of thinking that fanaticism is something which is
only practiced by others. On the contrary, it is a universal human frailty,
namely the high virtue of steadfastness taken to an extreme, an evil from
which even we, who call ourselves Baha-’i-s, are not immune.

II.

It is every person’s duty to gain knowledge, for it is “a treasure to man” and
“the cause for human progress.”54 Ignorance, according to ‘Abdu’l-Baha-, is
“the root of wrong-doing”55 and “the principle reason for the decline and fall

of the peoples”56. Shoghi Effendi said that knowledge is the best armament
for the defense of the Faith. The question arises, what kind of knowledge did
he mean?

1. First, we can assume that this must include an intimate knowledge of
the Writings of the Ba-b, Baha-’u’lla-h, ‘Abdu’l-Baha- and the clarifications and
the writings and explanations of Shoghi Effendi. There is also a need for a
deep knowledge and profound understanding of Islam, for the Qur’án is, so to
speak, our Old Testament.

2. Beyond this depth in our own sacred Writings and guidance, it is of
great advantage for a Baha-’i- to have a good knowledge of religious history.
As long as there is still discourse with outsiders about matters of faith and
belief, Christianity is of prime importance in the Western world. Especially
when one is called upon to talk with Church ministers and theologians, a solid
grounding in the Bible, and in Christian theology and history is extremely
helpful. Knowledge of other religions is today especially urgent, since the
new interfaith dialogue now allows us to present the Faith to a much broader
audience. One must know the others when one wishes to enter into dialogue
with them, if for no other reason than to be able to understand their questions.
Our own understanding of the message of Baha-’u’lla-h is deepened by an
encounter with other religious faiths. The idea that we can’t profit from
others, because Baha-’u’lla-h has already said everything there is to say, is
erroneous. First we have to understand what he has said. A dialogue with
other religious faiths can be very helpful in gaining this understanding.

3. One important discipline that helps our dialogue with academics is
philosophy. One encounters repeatedly the misunderstanding that Baha-’u’lla-h
has called philosophy a science that “begins with words and ends with
words”.57 This is absolutely wrong, as Shoghi Effendi has encouraged us to
study philosophy,58 which is defined as “the use of reason and argument in
seeking truth and knowledge of reality, especially of the causes and nature of
things and of the principles governing existence, the material universe, the
perception of physical phenomena, and human behaviour.”59

4. And finally, knowledge of history, especially modern history and
current events, is a must. When we wish to “be anxiously concerned with the
needs of the age ye live in, and center your deliberations on its exigencies and
requirements,”60 we must be informed about what is happening in the world.

58 Unfolding Destiny, p. 445.
59 The Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus, Oxford University Press, 1996.

Even a cursory reading of the Guardian’s letters in World Order of
Baha’u’llah is sufficient to have an example of his concern with and insight
into current events and their relationship to the truths of the Faith.
Unfortunately, some Baha-’i-s reject the reading of newspapers or keeping up
with the news of the day as a waste of time. We must be equally as well-
informed about present socio-political questions as about world politics. We
cannot explain the concept of the “Lesser Peace” to others when we have no
knowledge of current problem areas and of the attempts being made by many
to solve them.

5. We cannot attain deeper knowledge solely by reading the scripture.

There must also be reflection and discourse. One can learn much by preparing
talks and essays that are initially shared with a few and eventually with the
general public, a practice it is important to start early in life. Those who think
there is not enough time to do this during their early years of study, will be
saddened, indeed, to find that later, when they are laboring to make a living,
that there will be even less time, and that the skills are more difficult to learn.

‘Abdu’l-Baha- exhorted the believers to “think of ways of imparting the
message to prominent people, for once such persons have given their
allegiance to the Faith, they will cause the people to be led, troop after troop,
to the wellspring of unfailing guidance.”61 One cannot teach the educated,
unless one has an education oneself. Those, for whom this is possible have an
obligation to gain a wide education and to expand their horizons far beyond
the confines of a particular professional expertise.
I would like to stress, in conclusion, that no amount of education and
knowledge will bring success, unless it is combined with humility, when the
learned “pride not themselves on their attainments”62, and unless the teacher
“be kindled with the fire of His love”.63
