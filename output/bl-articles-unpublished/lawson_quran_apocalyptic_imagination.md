> ‘Apocalypse’ is a genre of revelatory literature with a narrative framework, in which a
> revelation is mediated by an otherworldly being to a human recipient, disclosing a
> transcendent reality which is both temporal, insofar as it envisages eschatological salvation,
> and spatial insofar as it involves another, supernatural world. . . . [its purpose is] to interpret
> present, earthly circumstances in light of the supernatural world and of the future, and to
> influence both the understanding and the behavior of the audience by means of divine
> authority . . . (Semeia 36, pp. 2 & 7).
