Why did ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Speak on Civil War/Emancipation Proclamation

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s choice of topic was timely, as it was the 50th anniversary of the
Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation.

On September 28, 1912, Baltimore’s The Afro-American Ledger reported on the
> “golden jubilee of the lifting of the shackles of slavery from the race” observed on
> September 27, during which the “principal sessions were held in the Metropolitan
A. M. E. Church,” where President Taft addressed the audience:

“It is a pleasure to be here,” said the President, “at the celebration of the
> greatest act in the life of Lincoln, who life was filled with great acts. The extinction
> of slavery meant the extinction of a living lie, because the Declaration of
> Independence said that all men were free and equal.” Mr. Taft went on to say that
> while Mr. Lincoln abhorred slavery, that he realized that it was recognized by the
> United States Constitution.
— “President Taft Praises Emancipator: Says ‘That It Is Right That Lincoln Should be Held Up in History

> as the Man Chiefly Responsible for the Freedom of the Negro’.” The Chicago Defender
> (September 28, 1912), 2.

Mahmúd’s Diary

> Today the Master went to Howard University, an educational institution for blacks. The hosts
> (mostly black with a few whites) had made special arrangements so that when the Master
> arrived He was welcomed by music from a band while the audience applauded with excitement
> and exuberance. It is difficult to describe the scene adequately. The president of the university
> was very cordial and introduced ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as the Prophet of Peace and the harbinger of unity
> and salvation. Then the Master rose from His seat and spoke on the subject of the harmony
> between blacks and whites and the unity of humankind. The audience repeatedly applauded Him
> during the talk, delighted at His words. At the conclusion, the president of the university thanked
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on behalf of all those gathered. As He left the auditorium, group after group formed
> two lines, one on each side, all showing their highest respect by bowing and waving their hats
and handkerchiefs in farewell to the beloved Master.

Agnes Parsons on the Speech
[Tuesday] April 23rd

> On Tuesday, after seeing several people in the morning Abdul Baha
> and Dr. Fareed went for a short drive: stopped at Mr. and Mrs.
> Hannen’s and afterward they went to Howard University where Abdul
> Baha made an address before a large audience of professors and
> students. He dwelt largely upon the need of love and unity between
> the white and black races and spoke of the gratitude which the
> colored people should feel for the whites, because, through them
> came not only freedom for their race, but it was the beginning of
> freedom for all slaves. He also told through education the differences
between the two races would be lessened.

“Abdul Baha on Religious Unity”

> Abdul Baha Abbas, the leader of the Baha [sic] movement for the world-wide
> religious unity, has been in the city. Through the missionary work of Mrs. Christian
> D. Helmick (Mrs. A. C. Barney that was), quite a colony of colored Bahaists has
> been developed in Washington, and these earnest disciples gave their patron saint
> an especially warm reception. On Tuesday evening the venerable prophet
> addressed a large audience at Metropolitan A. M. E. Church, in connection with the
> Bethel Literary Society. At noon Tuesday, the Abdul [sic] spoke to the students of
> Howard University. The principal advocate of the Bahai faith in this city is Mr. Louis
> C. [sic] Gregory, a brilliant young lawyer and government official, whose zeal in the
> work was so absorbing that he made a comprehensive tour of Egypt and the Holy
> Land to study at first hand the history and philosophy of this remarkable cult.

“Abdul Baha on Religious Unity”

> The Behai [sic] belief is that universal peace can only come through the
> harmony of all religions, and that all religions are basically one. Its consistent
> espousal of the “fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man” is causing the
> new faith to find considerable favor among many of our leading people. Its
> white devotees, even in this prejudice-ridden community, refuse to draw the
> color line. The informal meetings, held frequently in the fashionable mansions
> of the cultured society in Sheridan Circle, Dupont Circle, Connecticut and
> Massachusetts avenues, have been open to Negroes on terms of absolute
> equality. The liberality of the Behaist faith is evidenced in the fact that one can
> be of any known religious denomination, and yet maintain good standing as a
disciple of Behai.

Comments on the Persian Text

by Nahzy Abadi Buck
> Let’s look closely at this statement: “Today I am most happy, for I see here a
> gathering of the servants of God.” Here, the Master’s expression in Persian
> is nahāyat-i surūr, which means that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is expressing His utmost
> “joy” (surūr).

> And the cause of this joy is the sitting together (hamnishīn) of black and
> white. Here, hamnishīn means interacting one with another, usually in
> friendship, not just sitting politely, side-by-side.

> The Arabic word “gathering” (majma‘), which means an important meeting-
> place, is not just a casual meeting. Blacks and whites, sitting together as
> equals, was a rare occurrence at that time.

> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also refers to everyone in the audience as, literally, the “slaves
> of God” (bandigān-i ilāhī).

2. “Colors are the cause of the adornment of the garden.”

> In the realm of existence, colors are of no importance. Observe, in the
> mineral kingdom, colors are not the cause of discord (ikhtiláf). In the
> vegetable kingdom the colors of multicolored flowers are not the cause
> of discord (ikhtiláf). Rather, colors are the cause of the adornment
> (zínat) of the garden, because a single color has no appeal; but when
> you observe many-colored flowers, there is charm (jilvih) and display
> (zínat).

> Here, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is comparing human beings to flowers in a garden,
> although the comparison is not stated directly.

> When black and white are together, they are more beautiful. So, each one
> looks better, now!

> “Charm” (jilvih) is usually displayed, not hidden. This “charm” attracts
> attention, rather than going unnoticed. This previously unnoticed beauty
> (the beauty of blacks and the beauty of whites separately) becomes quite
> attractive when blacks and whites are mixed together.

> And this is more than attractive in the sense of being charming in
> appearance. This “charm” actually magnifies the beauty of the garden,
> attracting attention to itself, so that others will notice and be affected by the
> display of this lovely garden. Here, the garden is the charm of blacks and
> whites sitting together.

3. “How often white doves fly with black ones.”

> The world of humanity, too, is like a garden (bústán), and humankind
> are like the many-colored flowers. Therefore, different colors constitute
> an adornment (zínat). In the same way, there are many colors in the
> realm of animals. Doves (kabútar) are of many colors; nevertheless, they
> live in utmost harmony. They never look at color; instead, they look at
> the species (naw‘). How often white doves fly with black ones. In the
> same way, other birds and varicolored animals never look at color; they
> look at the species.

> In the previous paragraph. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá talked about flowers in general. He
> did not give a specific example, such as roses, which are very often used in
> Persian mystical poetry, as well as in the poetry of love. The yellow rose, in
> fact, was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá favorite flower.

> Here, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá chose a special kind of animal—doves (kabútar)—to
> make His point. What was His wisdom in doing so?

> Although kabútar is translated by Professor Banani as “doves,” this Persian
> word also means “pigeons.” As in English, “doves” and “pigeons” are
> closely related, and often the words are used interchangeably.

> Pigeons were used as messengers. So pigeons deliver messages,
> communicate, connect.

As for the other meaning, “doves” signify peace, love and harmony.

4. “White and black are the descendants of the same Adam.”

> Now ponder this: Animals, despite the fact that they lack reason (‘aql)
> and understanding (idráq), do not make colors the cause of conflict
> (sabab-i ikhtiláf). Why should man, who has reason, create conflict?
> This is wholly unworthy of him. Especially white and black are the
> descendants of the same Adam; they belong to one household. In
> origin, they were one; they were the same color. Adam was of one color.
> Eve had one color. All humanity is descended from them. Therefore, in
> origin they are one.

Comments on the Persian Text

by Nahzy Abadi Buck
> Here, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, while still speaking of animals by comparison, states
> that animals do not make color an issue. So why should people?

> Next, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that animals “lack reason (‘aql) and
> understanding (idráq),” which are qualities that human beings possess. This
> is what differentiates human beings from animals.

> Animals are irrational, being driven primarily by instinct. Yet, when people
> make differences in skin color a cause of division and oppression, this is
> worse than animals, which are irrational.

> Animals depend on a lot of things for their survival, such as scents, sounds,
> quick movements, etc. But skin color (or fur color) is not one of them.

> So, for human beings to make a distinction that animals do not make is
> more irrational than irrational animals! This is not worthy of human beings.

5. “These colors developed later due to climates and regions.”

> These colors developed later due to climates (literally, “water” (áb) and
> regions (iqlím); they have no significance (ahamíyyat) whatsoever.
> Therefore, today (imrúz) I am very happy (imrúz besyár masrúr-am) that
> white and black have gathered together in this meeting. I hope this
> coming together and harmony (ulfat) reaches such a degree that no
> distinctions (imtíyáz) shall remain between them, and they shall be
> together in the utmost harmony and love (ulfat va maḥabbat).

> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that “climate” (literally, the Persian text says
> “water” (áb)) and “regions” (iqlím) are the natural causes of differences in
> skin color.

> Although this is not meant as a “scientific” statement, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
> remark not only is supported by scientific evidence, but by common sense.

> Not only that, but human experience shows this to be true as well. Laborers,
> farmers, and construction workers who work long hours under the sun
> usually have darker skin colors due to their exposure to the sun.

> Imagine the effect of long-term exposure to the sun over a period of
> thousands, if not millions of years.

> So difference in skin color is natural; but making a difference over skin color
> is not natural. It is irrational, unscientific and unreasonable to do so.

6. “How they fought and sacrificed until they freed the blacks!”

> But I wish to say one thing in order that the blacks (siyāhān) may
> become grateful to the whites (mamnūn-i sifīdān shavand) and the
> whites become loving (mihrabān) toward the blacks. If you go to Africa
> and see the blacks of Africa (siyāh-hā-yi ifrīqā), you will realize how
> much progress (taraqqī) you have made. Praise be to God! You are like
> the whites; there are no great distinctions left. (al-ḥamd lillāh shumā
> mis̱l-i sifīdānīd imtiyāz chandānī dar miyān nīst.) But the blacks of
> Africa are treated as servants (khadamah).

> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement that the blacks should be “grateful” to the whites
> is striking. Here, the Master shifts the focus from whites as being the cause
> of enslaving the blacks to the sacrifice of whites during the Civil War as the
> cause of emancipating blacks from slavery. (I don’t see this approach being
> used today!)

> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá shifts the focus from the evils that whites perpetrated (in
> enforcing slavery) to the good that they sacrificed their lives to bring about.

> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also shifts the focus from the evils of slavery to the overall
> advancement of African Americans in America. Further advancement is
> what is needed, and that’s what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will call on the whites to do.

7. “The emancipation proclamation became universal.”

> The first proclamation of emancipation for the blacks was made by the
> whites of America. How they fought and sacrificed until they freed the
> blacks! Then it spread to other places. The blacks of Africa were in
> complete bondage, but your emancipation led to their freedom also—
> that is, the European states emulated the Americans, and the
> emancipation proclamation became universal. It was for your sake (bi-
> jahat-i shumā) that the whites of America made such an effort. Were it
> not for this effort, universal emancipation (ḥurriyyat-i ‘umūmī) would
> not have been proclaimed (i’lān nimīshud).

> Here, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá shifts the focus from the evils of slavery to the
> unintended good that resulted, that is, the positive consequences.

> Through the sacrifice of African Americans who were enslaved, they
> eventually progressed far beyond many of the peoples in Africa, and were
> now a model for Africans to look up to in order that the people of Africa
> might advance as well.

> Here is a shift in focus from the evils of slavery to the good that resulted
> from slavery (not that slavery itself was good).

8. “Strive jointly to make extraordinary progress.”
> Therefore, you must be very grateful to the whites of America, and the
> whites must become very loving toward you so that you may progress
> (taraqqī) in all human grades. Strive jointly to make extraordinary
> progress (taraqqī) and mix together completely. In short, you must be
> very thankful to the whites who were the cause of your freedom in
> America. Had you not been freed, other blacks would not have been
> freed either. Now—praise be to God!—everyone is free and lives in
> tranquillity. I pray that you attain to such a degree of good character and
> behavior that the names of black and white shall vanish. All shall be
> called human, just as the name for a flight of doves is dove. They are
> not called black and white. Likewise with other birds.

> What does ‘Abdu’l-Bahá mean by “progress”? The Persian word for “progress
> here is “taraqqī.” Real “progress” is not just material. It is educational, social
> and spiritual advancement, as well as economic well-being.

> What does ‘Abdu’l-Bahá mean to help someone or some group “progress”?
> The Master is speaking generally here. But one thing is clear: Progress first
> depends on peace and harmony, which means integration in harmonious and
> mutually beneficial interaction.

> What does ‘Abdu’l-Bahá mean by “grateful”? In Persian, the expression is
> “mamnūn-i sifīdān shavand.” In Persian culture, to be “grateful” means a lot
> more than just saying, “Thank you.” It means to show your wholehearted
> gratitude (not just showing polite appreciation) by your actions.

> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá elsewhere talks about gratitude and advancement in speaking
> about the interaction between youth and their elders, where the elders are
> encouraged to be kind, to teach the youth and become a cause of their progress,
> while the youth should show their appreciation toward their elders.

9. “Endeavor to promote your advancement and enhance your honor.”
> I hope that you attain to such a high degree—and this is impossible
> except through love. You must try to create love between
> yourselves; and this love does not come about unless you are grateful
> (mamnún) to the whites, and the whites are loving (mihrabán) toward
> you, and endeavor to promote your advancement and enhance your
> honor (dar taraqqī-i shumā bikūshand va dar ‘izzat-i shumā sa’y
> namāyand). This will be the cause of love (sabab-i maḥabbat).
> Differences between black and white will be completely obliterated;
> indeed, ethnic and national differences will all disappear. (bi-kullī
> ikhtilāf bayn-i siyāh va sifīd zā’il mīgardad balkih ikhtilāf-i jins va
> ikhtilāf-i vaṭan hamih az miyān mīravad.)

> Here, this “high degree” of attainment is “impossible” unless certain
> conditions are met.

> The whites not only must be kind and loving toward the blacks. Although
> that’s good in itself, there is yet another condition, which is that whites
> should “endeavor to promote your advancement and enhance your
> honor” (dar taraqqī-i shumā bikūshand va dar ‘izzat-i shumā sa’y namāyand).

> When that condition is met, then—and only then—will “this … be the cause
> of love” (sabab-i muḥabbat)—that is, the cause of reciprocal love from blacks
> towards whites.

> For whites to be truly loving, they must show their love and concern in
> their actions by helping blacks to advance and make progress, not only for
> their own benefit, but for the welfare of society as a whole.

10. “Be with one another in utmost harmony and love.”

> I am very happy to see you and thank God that this meeting is
> composed of people of both races and that both are gathered in perfect
> love and harmony. I hope this becomes the example of universal
> harmony and love (nimūnih-yi ulfat va maḥabbat-i kullī) until no title
> remains except that of humanity. Such a title demonstrates the
> perfection of the human world and is the cause of eternal glory and
> human happiness. I pray that you be with one another in utmost
> harmony and love (nahāyat-i ulfat va maḥabbat) and strive to enable
> each other to live in comfort.

The Luncheon after ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Howard University Speech

Gayle Morrison’s Commentary on the Luncheon

> Early on that afternoon of 23 April ‘Abdu’I-Bahá had sought to demonstrate His
> teachings on race by challenging the practice of social segregation. After His
> speech at Howard University, He had been invited by Ali-Kuli Khan, chargé
> d’affaires of the Persian Legation, and Madame Florence Breed Khan, both of
> whom were Bahá’ís, to attend a luncheon and a reception in His honor. About
> nineteen guests were present at the luncheon. Some were “very prominent in
> the social and political life of Washington,” Mr. Gregory recalled, and others
> were Bahá’í friends of the Khans, individuals such as Agnes Parsons, a
> Washington socialite, and Juliet Thompson, a painter from New York, who were
comfortable in such circles. …

> — Gayle Morrison, To Move the World: Louis Gregory and the Advancement of Racial Unity in
> America (Wilmette, IL: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1982/1999), 52–53.

The luncheon following Abdu’l-Bahá’s speech

> During the visit of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the United States in 1912
> a luncheon in His honor was given in Washington by Mírzá
> Ali-Kuli Khan and Madame Khan, who were both Bahá’ís.
> Khan was at that time chargé d’affaires of the Persian
> Legation in the capital city. Many noted people were
> invited, some of whom were members of the official and
> social life of Washington, as well as a few Bahá’ís.

> Just an hour before the luncheon ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sent word to
> Louis Gregory that he might come to Him for the promised
> conference. Louis arrived at the appointed time, and the
> conference went on and on. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá seemed to want
> to prolong it. When luncheon was announced, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
> led into the dining room, except Louis.

“Where is Mr. Gregory? Bring Mr. Gregory!”

> All were seated when suddenly, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stood up, looked around, and then said to
> Mírzá Khan, “Where is Mr. Gregory? Bring Mr. Gregory!” There was nothing for Mírzá
> Khan to do but find Mr. Gregory, who fortunately had not yet left the house, but was
> quietly waiting for a chance to do so. Finally Mr. Gregory came into the room with Mírzá
> Khan. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who was really the Host (as He was wherever He was), had by this
> time rearranged the place setting and made room for Mr. Gregory, giving him the seat of
> honor at His right. He stated He was very pleased to have Mr. Gregory there, and then, in
> the most natural way as if nothing unusual had happened, proceeded to give a talk on
the oneness of mankind.

[668].

Juliet Thompson’s & Louis Gregory’s Accounts

> Juliet Thompson’s account of the luncheon testifies to the ease with which
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá defied convention, as if it did not in fact exist. She wrote simply
> that “a colored man, Lewis [sic] Gregory, was present and the Master gave a
> wonderful talk on race prejudice.” Mr. Gregory himself, although he
> undoubtedly told the full story of the luncheon to many friends, stated in his
> formal reminiscences only that “‘Abdul Baha’ made everyone feel perfectly at
> ease by his genial humor, wisdom and outpouring of love. … He mentioned his
> address at Howard University which was made at noon that same day and
indicated guidance and progress in race relations.”

> — Gayle Morrison, To Move the World: Louis Gregory and the Advancement of Racial Unity in
> America (Wilmette, IL: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1982/1999), 53.

Gayle Morrison’s Commentary

> Gently yet unmistakably, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had assaulted the customs of a city that
> had been scandalized only a decade earlier by President Roosevelt’s dinner
> invitation to Booker T. Washington. Moreover, as a friend who helped Madame
> Khan with the luncheon recalled, the place setting that ‘Abdu’I-Bahá had
> rearranged so casually had been made according to the strict demands of
> Washington protocol. Thus, with one stroke ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had swept aside both
segregation by race and categorization by social rank.

Interview of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

> I AM very pleased with America and its people. I find religion, high
> ideals, broad sympathy with humanity, benevolence and kindness
> widespread here, and my hope is that America will lead the movement for
> universal peace. …
> Such leadership would be in accord with their own history and the

> displayed here during the Civil War. Americans who had never seen a
> weapon used in anger left their homes and peaceful pursuits, took up
> arms, bore utmost hardships, braved utmost dangers, gave up all they
> held dear, and finally their lives, in order that slaves might be free.

Interview of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

> In Washington recently I addressed the students at Howard University—
> about fifteen hundred of them—and I told them that they must be very
> good to the white race of America. I told them that they must never forget
> to be grateful and thankful. I said to them: “If you want to know really
> what great service the white race here has rendered to you, go to Africa
> and study the condition of your own race there.” But the same time I said
> that the white people here must be very kind to those whom they have
> freed.

Interview of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

> The white people must treat those whom they have freed with justice and
> firmness, but also with perfect love. America’s example of freeing the
> slaves has been a power for freedom everywhere. Because America freed
> her slaves, even at the cost of one of the bloodiest wars of modern

The Need to Adapt ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Discourse on Race

> The American nation is much more diverse than in 1938, and the friends cannot be
> concerned only with relations between black and white, essential as they are. The
> expressions of racial prejudice have transmuted into forms that are multifaceted, less
> blatant and more intricate, and thus more intractable.
> So too, the American Baha’i community has evolved significantly and is no longer at the
> same stage of its development; it faces a wider range of challenges but also possesses
> greater capabilities.
> The House of Justice stated that the principles Shoghi Effendi brought to the attention of
> the American believers more than seventy years ago are relevant today, and they will
> continue to be relevant to future generations. It is obvious, however, that the “long and
> thorny road, beset with pitfalls” upon which the friends must tread, will take them
> through an ever-changing landscape that requires that they adapt their approaches to
> varying circumstances.
