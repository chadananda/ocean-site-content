### 1\. About this book

_Life Histories of Bahá'í Women in Canada: Constructing Religious Identity in the Twentieth Century_ is an unprecedented study of the essential features of living a Bahá'í life, examining contributions and experiences of a diverse group of Canadian women and men in a new religion through a sociological framework and a women-centred perspective.

The key figures in the Bahá'í Faith, early female heroes, major teachings of the religion, and Canadian Bahá'í history are detailed. A background on social history and the feminization of religion also provides a context for twentieth century Canadian life. Drawing upon Western religious and secular thought and practice, theories and social attitudes about the nature of woman and the Bahá'í perspective on these topics are explicated. These stirring narratives, historical and contemporary, provide a compelling perspective on social processes and interactional dimensions of Bahá'í community life. The life histories also illustrate, in poignant, humorous, and inspiring ways, how these notable Bahá'ís "story" themselves along the way.

The teachings of the Bahá'í Faith are remarkably forward looking. One of the foundational principles is the oneness of humanity, and an integral part of this oneness is the equality of women with men. Lay readers and students of religion, sociology, and women's and gender studies, will be interested in how members make meaning of these teachings on equality and how women's participation in the Bahá'í institutional system is promoted and maintained.

Lynn Echevarria is the Coordinator and Instructor for the Women's and Gender Studies Program at Yukon College, Canada, and holds a PhD in sociology from the University of Essex, United Kingdom. She has a long-time research interest and involvement in women's advancement, and more recently, men's studies. Her publications include articles, reviews, a co-authored chapter in _Lights of the Spirit: Historical Portraits of Black Bahá'ís in North America 1898-2000,_ and a chapter in _Bahá'í and Globalisation._ She has been the recipient of a Northern Research Institute grant and two Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) doctoral fellowship.

             INTRODUCTION

W      e may never have known about Edith Magee if a middle–aged soci-

ologist in New Brunswick had not been especially determined to find
her. Rummaging through an ordinary collection of correspondence, he first
came across her name—there in a letter from 1917 nestled undisturbed
amongst others. His curiosity was heightened when, serendipitously, he re-
ceived a “mysterious communication” from a man (Joseph Frost, cousin of
Robert Frost), who indicated he had two boxes of papers and photographs
belonging to her family.1 Our sociologist excitedly drove straight to Eliot,
Maine and went to the house. When the door opened, he announced, "Here I
am!", and Joseph replied, "There they are!" And so he was rewarded with an
archive of great historical value, including 350 sepia photographs of the vir-
tually unknown Miss Magee and her family. He rescued beautiful Edith from
oblivion and devotedly recorded her story to set the record straight. 2

Those dusty boxes were a treasure trove and we now know that, in 1898,
Edith, an eighteen–year–old woman of Irish Methodist background, took a
leap of faith and became the first Bahá’í in Canada. Those papers reveal that
she learned of the Bahá’í teachings at the 1893 World Parliament of Relig-
ions in Chicago. Shortly thereafter, her mother, younger sister, and two aunts
became Bahá’ís also and, with Edith, formed the first Bahá’í group in Lon-
don, Ontario. Unfortunately, no person in that era documented the signifi-
cance of her declaration of belief or personal statements of her experience.
We can only use the fragments of her family records to piece together her
life. What we do know is that, from her time forward, women were in the
vanguard of building the Canadian Bahá’í Community.

Edith has long since passed away, and in the centenary decade of the re-
ligion in Canada (1990s) there were just a few women and men still living
who had become Bahá’ís in the early part of the 20 th century. The seminal
book about the social history of the religion was published in 1996. 3 Yet
there was still no academic book that provided accounts of women’s personal
experiences, and in–depth analysis of their social interactions. The purpose

2                                    Life Histories of Bahá'í Women in Canada

of this book is to pick up this trail of historical inquiry and fill in the lacuna.
It is a sociological presentation of the construction of religious identity of
women in the Canadian Bahá’í Community through the years 1938–1960.

Why should a readership be interested in the subject of women in the
Bahá'í Faith, you may wonder, and what is distinctive about this religion
with respect to its teachings and its views of the status and roles of women?
The teachings of the Bahá'í religion are remarkably forward looking. One of
the foundational teachings of Bahá'u'lláh, the religion’s founder, is the one-
ness of humanity, and an integral part of this oneness is the equality of
women with men. So important is this principle of equality that the Bahá'í
teachings regard it as a prerequisite for the establishment of world peace.
This book explores, then, not only questions about theology but also about
how a sampling of Canadian women—some native–born converts to the new
religion, others immigrants from various countries—took up the challenges
and joys of living a Bahá'í life.

I began my research with the simple question, “How did these women
make meaning of the Bahá’í Faith and translate that meaning into action?”
Other more complex questions evolved as I gathered the data: How did the
community take shape from those early years and what was the range of ac-
tivity women could assume in the development of this new religious move-
ment? What were their personal experiences and how did they live a life of
religiosity? What were the challenges and influences from the outer society
and the processes of community life? I decided it would be useful to examine
what questions feminist scholars raise concerning women and religion, and
then to consider the Bahá’í religion in light of those queries. As I engaged in
this process, it became apparent that a key concern in feminist literature is
the promotion and maintenance of women’s leadership in religious commu-
nity. I also adopted this as a primary orientation.

My interest in the question of leadership and agency4 of women in the
public realm, and what supports or limits their activity, has naturally led me
to focus on the roles that women have taken outside family life and the do-
mestic domain. Consequently I have explored the ways in which women
have found their sense of spiritual self in this milieu. I recognize, however,
the vital importance of women’s role within the home and family as keepers
and transmitters of culture and religiosity, and I hope that scholars in the near
future will take up this area of research. 5 My orientation concentrates on
Bahá’í women’s religious community life and theology while taking into ac-

Introduction                                                                    3

count the wider society’s secular and religious gender imaging and relations.
I also explore what external resources are available to assist and support
women in their endeavours as they strive to develop and maintain agency
and equality.

In this book I focus on storytelling as a means to understand people’s
experiences, and I look at both process and product. To this end, I present
many types of stories, both informal and formal, that are drawn from histori-
cal and contemporary resources. In addition I explore, in some cases, how the
stories are told. The narratives, rich in reflection and feeling, offer the reader
a privileged glimpse into the lives and actions of these Bahá’í women. They
also provide a compelling perspective of the many facets of individual sac-
ralization, as well as the processes and interactional dimensions of Bahá’í
group life.

The Participants
The nucleus of the narrative accounts presented here are taken from life–
history interviews I conducted with Bahá’ís over the course of three years
(1993–1996). This cohort of participants is comprised of twenty individu-
als—eleven women and nine men—from across Canada who were from
sixty–five to ninety–three years of age at the time they were interviewed. The
main criterion for the choice of participants was their longevity as members
of the religion. During the three decades (1938–1960), the majority of
women in my study were between twenty–five and thirty–five years of age
(see Appendix 1 for further details on my methodology and the background
of the participants).

In addition, I recorded interviews with thirteen other people of varying
ages and backgrounds. For example, I decided that a younger Bahá’í per-
spective (middle–aged people) might be useful, and because the circum-
stances were serendipitous, I was able to record a number of supplementary
full life stories and additional interviews.6 While I do not quote those stories
in this book, they gave me a valuable contrastive perspective to the stories of
the older Bahá’ís.

I was not able to include any First Nations women in my initial study be-
cause those women who were early Bahá’ís in Ontario and Saskatchewan
(1960s) were no longer alive. However, later (2003–2004) I undertook a re-
search project in the Yukon with Aboriginal people, and that data will con-
tribute to future work on First Nations and the Bahá’í Faith.

4                                  Life Histories of Bahá'í Women in Canada

Although the focus of this book is women’s experiences, I have included
excerpts from men’s stories because they are friends, fellow Bahá’ís, and
family members living closely with these women, and as such they provide
essential contributions to an understanding of women’s agency in Bahá’í
community life. We will also come to appreciate several other important as-
pects of Bahá'í life, such as how women’s activity has affected the religiosity
and identity building of men, and the fact that men have been given man-
dates in the Bahá'í writings to advance women’s status. Therefore, introduc-
ing men’s perspectives on this process adds further depth to the text.

I chose the women because of their advanced age, not according to their
achievements in the religion or in society. I knew that a few had the reputa-
tion of being outstanding, in one way or another, for their contributions to
Canada in social and economic development, or to the service of the religion,
in general. It did not become apparent until later, however, that all these
women were intensely involved in the Bahá'í community and the public ac-
tivities of the religion.

The Life–History Method: Process and Product
I embarked on this research through the life–history method along with
certain aims of the oral historian. The goal of the sociological life history is
to understand how people construct and make sense of their lives at certain
moments in time (Plummer 1983). The oral–history perspective seeks to al-
low for a multiplicity of standpoints about the past to gain a wider historical
view (Thompson 1992). The people who narrate their life stories provide a
resource of rich description and perspective that not only can describe the
historical context through which they live, but can also illuminate their per-
sonal and joint courses of action within that context. My work was to analyze
the lay accounts, and then to go beyond the narratives of experience to create
sociological explanations of social processes within the community.

A fortuitous aspect of conducting life histories and working with qualita-
tive data is the fact that I am able to privilege my participants’ accounts by
presenting their language, theories, and explanations, as well as my own. For
example, the part of this book that discusses processes arises directly from
the major strands/themes of service my participants conveyed as being im-
portant in their lives. I was able to weave in the metaphors they provided
about “types” of Bahá’ís and exactly how they were involved with the relig-
ion. Individual histories about religious identity are the repositories of the

Introduction                                                                 5

expression of the larger spiritual meaning system, and they are informed
through fellow members’ lives and stories. My participants’ astute observa-
tions enabled me to gain and convey a sense of the historical context of an
infant Canadian religious community.

What about my position as a researcher and as an author of this work?

Researchers write themselves into their text in the way they represent the ac-
count of the life history, whether it be through the way that they contextually
frame the study, or by direct reference to their own life experience and back-
ground, and/or the particulars and relations of the interview process, itself.
My forty–seven years of acquired knowledge of Bahá’í community life as an
insider means that I know, generally, the features of Bahá’í group life, the
practices Bahá’ís assume, the shared language, “a vocabulary of understand-
ing”(Adler and Adler 1987, 82), the structure of Bahá’í institutions, and the
rhythm of community life. Indeed, in my interaction with the life–history
participants, there was a tacit recognition that we shared a collective iden-
tity—a foundation of beliefs about theology, history, and teachings. They did
not have to tell me their basic beliefs or educate me about principles and
practices.

Assuming the position of interviewer/student with my cohort was easy in
many ways because I was in the setting to learn about their particular experi-
ences, of which they are the expert practitioners. However, I was more than
an “apprentice–participant”, a person who begins the study as a student and
assumes full membership in time (Forrest 1986), a “peripheral member” who
joins but is not actually functional in the group, or an “active member” who
takes part for the sake of the study and leaves the field thereafter (Adler and
Adler 1987). I am a researcher who is a long–term member that sociological
theory calls a “committed member”. I am also the “phenomenon under
study” (Shaffir, Dietz, Prus 1994). I hold both a natural and a theoretic
stance.

My responsibility as a researcher/author, then, is to come to terms with
these multifaceted perspectives and find a way to unify them. This necessi-
tates learning new ways to observe and present familiar settings. My findings
must satisfy diverse audiences: the academic scholars who will expect that
this book, among many things, presents an objective academic viewpoint and
not a hagiography or apologetics; the community under study who will desire
facts about early history, and who will seek a perspective that resonates with
their understandings, while at the same time sheds new light on everyday ac-

6                                  Life Histories of Bahá'í Women in Canada

tivities of their community life; or the Bahá’í scholars who will hope for new
findings that illuminate Bahá’í social history and the overall topic of gender.
And then there is myself. I want to present a work that is recognizably aca-
demic, using theoretical frameworks and methodology current in my field,
while acknowledging there is a spiritual dimension in the world and affirm-
ing and enabling the life–history participant’s right to express that experi-
ence. How well I have harmonized these differing perspectives and fulfilled
my responsibility to address and convey them is for the reader to decide, and
my explanation about process is given in detail in the methodology section
(see Appendix 1).7

Theoretical Frameworks
There are several theoretical perspectives that provide the framework for
this book. A women–centred inquiry, throughout, places the concerns and
experiences of women as central to this discussion. I also use the symbolic
interactionist perspective from sociology to understand how people make
meaning of their experience, and how they construct their individual and col-
lective religious identity. Research from studies in the sociology of religion
provides an undergridding of additional insights about process and aspects of
religiosity, and I draw upon the Bahá’í literature concerning major teachings,
ordinances, and worldview to reflect a Bahá’í perspective.

Symbolic Interactionism

As a theoretical perspective, symbolic interactionism is an interpretive
approach well suited to the study of human group life. The interactionist per-
spective has informed and promoted the life–history method in sociology
emphasizing participant observation and open–ended interviewing. This so-
ciological perspective is extremely useful, both as an orientation to conduct-
ing research, and as a theoretical perspective, because it provides a frame–
work through which to understand the worldview of informants;8 how they
define their environment, and how they actively construct their lives. It en-
courages the use of the rich constructions of meaning gained through re-
cording, presenting, and interpreting the individual’s metaphors, concepts,
and personal stories.

Traditional interactionism, which is where I position my work, argues for
the primacy of the subject, the existence of an everyday world—obdurate re-
ality—and a belief that language, itself, is a social product and process con-
