> _Crown of Glory: Memoirs of Jináb-i-Azíz’u’lláh Azízí_ is the autobiography of “Jináb-i-Azízí, the Tailor” (1873–1949), whom ‘Abdu’l-Bahá considered to be one of His “dear, renowned and close companions” (Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, provisional translation, p. 22). This volume contains a wealth of historical anecdotes and photographs, including the author’s eight successive visits to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the Holy Land, and personal accounts of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in London and in Paris (1913). Jináb-i-Azízí was present at the reading of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament, and, two days later, was summoned to a private meeting with Shoghi Effendi, the newly appointed successor to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Provisional translations of several Tablets by Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá are provided as well.

Preface to the Second Revised Edition

The writing of Taj-i-Vahhaj: Memoirs of Jinab-i-Aziz 'u' llah Azizi
was originally intended for the benefit of his children and for
posterity, so that his descendants might follow in the spiritual
footsteps of their beloved forebear.

The sale of this volume experienced such a level of interest
outside the family, quite unexpected by the writer, that all copies
of the volume in its first edition sold out within a relatively
short period of time.

Following the Revolution in Iran (1979) and the upheaval in
Tehran, the resulting dispersal of the Persian Baha'i friends
abroad created an even greater need for more literature on the
Faith. There was also more opportunity to reflect and deepen on the
Faith under these new circumstances.

Within the Azizi family itself, the martyrdom of three of its
most distinguished members        Iskandar Azizi, Jal al Azizi and
Habib'u'llah Azizi        intensified interest in preserving the
spiritual legacy of the family to such extent that I received an
increasing number of requests to reprint my father's memoirs, Taj-
i-Vahaj. Interest in these memoirs was by no means confined to the
family itself.     Letters from as far away as Malta and the
Philippines, the United States and Canada -- and other places --
requested copies of the memoirs.

Unfortunately,   due   to the    adverse circumstances of      the
Revolution, there was no copy of the publication at hand with which
to oblige these requests.     However, it happened that one or two
copies of the work had inadvertently been brought to the United
States prior to the Revolution. Evidently, the photocopies of the
book were being passed along to interested individuals, and in this
manner the book was being circulated beyond the finite limited
edition itself.   I had heard that a few copies were made by hand,
in order both to save money and ensure accuracy.

This being the case, I decided to reprint the volume in a new
edition.  I was convinced that I should do so when Moslem Persian
expatriates reported to me that a number of the Moslem friends who
came from Iran to the States were circulating the book among
themselves (unaware that I was its author l ) and there was a
definite demand among them for more copiesl

Having made the decision to reprint this book, it was necessary
that the text should undergo re-editing in order to restore it to
its full original length, and, at the same time, correct errors in
the previous edition.

The present writer makes full admission to his limited knowledge
of the Torah and the sacred traditions of Judaism. Efforts have
been made to keep editorial notes referencing allusions to Jewish
traditions in the text to a minimum, lest the edition become a
target for critics. I only refer to what my father has explicitly
mentioned with respect to Jewish traditions, as my own study of the
tradition permits.

Dr. Zabih'u'llah Azizi. New York, 18 December, 1986.

Preface to the English Edition

Because the book, The Memoirs of Jinab-i-Azizi, got lost in the
turmoil of the revolution in Iran, members of the family found it
necessary to arrange for a new publication and a translation into
English so that their children would know how their grandfather had
become a believer. For this purpose, one of the grandchildren,
Hamid Azizi, with the help of his wife Sandra -- who are both
knowledgeable in English and Persian -- took the initiative and
with the help of Christopher and Nahzy Buck translated the book,
taking care to safeguard the original meaning.

Therefore it is my duty to thank Christopher and Nahzy Buck for
the first translation and Hamid and Sandra Azizi for the editing of
the text. Thanks go also to many others who in one way or another
have contributed to the production of this volume.

It is my hope that this story will inspire future generations to
follow in the footsteps of their grandfather, Jinab-i-Azizi.

Dr. Zabiollah Azfzf

The English edition is lovingly dedicated to the memory of my
grandfather, Jinab-i-Azfz'u'llah Azfzf, who brought the blessings
of our Beloved Faith to the family.

Hamid Azizi
Vancouver, B.C.
Naw-Ruz 149 B.E. (1992)

Statement, made by 'Abdu'l-Baha to Jinab-i-Azizi in Paris:

"Inscribe in the margin of your book:    All the forces of the
world are being defeated. Have patience for a few years. The light
of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah will envelop the whole world."

Additional Note:

The National Spiritual Assembly of Iran at the recommendation of
its Board of Review, gave its approval for the publication of this
book, on the condition that certain sections of the narrative
(around one-third of the text) be edited out due to the sensitive
nature of the material, considering the prevailing state of affairs
between the government of Iran and the Faith.

Puhl ication of the text in its entirety was left for a more
favourable time in the future. Meanwhile, the passages in question
were kept in archives. One may wonder about the state of these
archives considering the excesses of the Revolution in Iran. Since
the personal effects of the present writer and his brothers were
ransacked during the Revolution, we expect nothing less of the fate
of the archives of any Baha'i Assembly.

When this book was approved for publication, certain esteemed
members of both the National Spiritual Assembly and its Board of
Review personally sent letters of endorsement and encouragement to
me, including Jinab-i-Dr. Barafrukhtih.

Dr. Barafrukhtih's letter concerned a particular statement
'Abdu'l-Baha had made to Jinab-i-Azizi in Paris, in regard to the
importance of recording the events to which he was an immediate
eyewitness. We therefore quote the kind doctor's letter as follows:

"I came across the following statement by 'Abdu'l-Baha to Jinab-
i-Azizi, as found in the memoirs of Mon. Dreyfus in Paris, in which
he wrote:

"     Ecrivez dans le coin de votre canot tous les partis
politique seront aneantis, attendez quelques annees vous verrez que
la lumiere de la Foi de Baha'u'llah enveloppera le Monde entier."

Handwriting of the Beloved Guardian

Tablets of 'Abdu'l-Baha to Jinab-i-Azizi

To Jinab-i-Azfzf, of the lineage of Abraham, on him
be the Glory of God.

He is God1

0 descendant of Abraham/

In truth, thou art of that     illustrious   lineage,   a
descendant of that resplendent Sun.

From the mantle of your deeds is diffused a musk-laden
fragrance, like unto the sweet-smell of the ministry of Abraham.

Tokens of your Abrahamic heritage are evident from your
firmness and steadfastness. Thus should the descendant live up to
that nobility, so that the secret of Abraham may be revealed.

The gathering you had arranged was glorious, majestic
and beauteous and in reality a reflection of the realm above, for
it was a gathering consecrated to the establishment of a
Mashriqu'l-Adhkar. Divine favour and assistance was manifest in
that gathering, inspiring each one present to succeed in giving
generously, according to their capacity.

The blessings of that event shall return to you with a
bountiful portion thereof, causing you to become the recipient of
God's forgiveness.

Convey to your honoured wife greetings of the Most
Glorious, and may you ever show kindness to your sons and
daughters on behalf of 'Abdu'l-Baha.

Salutations and praise be upon you.

Upon him be the Glory of God.

He is God!

0 Spiritual Friend! Signs of divine assistance, in this
blessed year, are radiating from all horizons, even as the rays
of dawn. Verses of proof are chanted in village and city alike
and whole streams of heavenly blessing flow throughout societies
the world over.

From every side an anthem is raised, and from every
land a melody and refrain. These are the overall bestowals of
God. Give ear to the cry of "Ya Baha'u'l-Abha", ascending to the
Concourse on High, and to the call of "Ya Ali'u'l-Ala," imparting
joy and rapture to the ears of (those in) the Kingdom.

The friends must be at the apex of joy and happiness
because, thanks to God, the desires of the pure in heart and the
utmost wish of luminous souls, are now visible and manifest
through the bounty and grace of His Holiness (Baha'u'llah), the
Supreme Goa 1 •

The Beloved One of our desire is present in this
gathering in His Most Great Beauty and has manifested Himself to
all the friends. Jinab-i-Amin has the utmost praise for the
spiritual meetings of the friends of Jewish heritage, who in
truth have taken great steps and made every effort toward service
in the Cause of God.

At this point, I wish very much to bring each and all
to mind, and write a word for each of those dear friends who are
in my heart. Alas, time does not permit mention of each, one by
one, so they will be given recognition together. Know that Jinab-
i-Amin has made mention of each individual.

Praise be to God, that in this great Dispensation, the
glances of divine favour have embraced the people of Israel, that
the promises of the Prophets of old might be fulfilled, in the
realm of visible existence.

0 Jewish friends! His Holiness Kalim (Moses), from the
precincts of the sacred Kingdom, is, at this very moment, voicing
praises for your attraction and enkindlement (devotion). The
Concourse in the realm above are lauding you and recounting your
deeds. At every moment, the denizens of the spiritual realm raise
aloud the call: "Blessed are ye!"

It is therefore my earnest wish that the Jewish friends
will continue to render evident service to the Lord of the Friend
(Abraham), and thereby augment the joy and happiness of His

Holiness Abraham, in the lofty retreats of the Kingdom.

Upon you all rest the Glory of the All-Glorious!

were cordial and dear; and that the Cause of God has bestowed
spirit upon this old place and established there the Teachings of

unfurled. Greetings to you all, and upon each of you be the

HE IS GOD!

0 my Lord, 0 my Lord! Thou beholdest Thy loved ones,
attracted to Thy Abha Kingdom, enkindled in their inmost being,
enflamed with the fire of Thy love, that is blazing in the Tree
of Sinai, submissive to Thy lofty Word, humble in Thy Cause
amongst all people, obedient to that which Thou hast commanded in
Thy Epistles and Tablets, excelling in the promotion of Thy Word,
and clinging to Thy Most Great Bounty.

0 God! They are surging as the billowing waves, raging
as the blowing breeze. They have scattered Thy fragrances amongst
the peoples of the earth and, not concealing themselves in
obscure corners, they came forth and called out in Thy name,
openly beckoning all to Thy love at every morn and even-tide.
Thou seest them, bowing, prostrated, humble and submissive at the
door of Thy Oneness, self-effacing and lowly, and they have
resisted those , who, in their pride and arrogance were negligent
in their remembrance of Thee.

0 God! Thou knowest that Thy servant is intoning at
every morn and eve the verses of His contentment with them, His
tongue, breaking forth at every dawn and dusk in thanksgiving to
them. Praised be Thou, 0 Bestower of Bounty for having enabled
them to serve Thee and confirmed them in worshipping Thee,
attaining to Thy knowledge, being steadfast in Thy love, and
grateful to Thy Bounty and Mercy.

0 my Lord! These are the birds of the apex of
knowledge, sustain their wings with the ensigns of might and
power, that they may soar to the highest realm, to the ultimate
aim, to the endless heaven and make of them towering trees,

HE IS GOD!

0 Thou Herald of the Covenant!

Thy letter of the 19th of Muharram was received, and
from its contents signs of contentment, resolve and great
expectations were perceived. It is My desire that, from the secret
bounties of God, you will with joy and happiness sing a new song
and raise a wondrous melody.

Should letters such as yours convey happiness when they
are read, the breezes of happiness will waft aloft; and should
traces of sorrow be imparted, these too, leave a strong impact.

Praise be to God! By the grace of the Abha Kingdom,
certain persons will listen to your words, and this will continue
into the future. I am hopeful that through the blessings of the
Creator they might rend asunder the veils, and disperse the clouds.
Each of those blessed individuals, who make their homes the nests
for divine birds (spiritual friends) and a place for the radiation
of proofs of the di vine Revelation (referring to feasts and
firesides) are dear to Abdu'l-Baha, and are glorious in the Abha
Kingdom. By GodJ These have arisen with the utmost strength to
serve, They show forth every -endeavour and, with heart and soul,
strive to cause the blind to see, to quicken those who are as dead
and to turn the stranger into a friend.

I cherish the hope that these individuals are those souls
whom the Blessed Beauty had promised to 'Abdu'l-Baha from His pure
lips -- may My soul be a sacrifice to His friends-- to raise up. Of
course, all the dear friends who follow their example and initiate
similar endeavours, become each a source of results, illumination
and a mine of mysteries.

Convey Abha greetings to Jinab-i-Azfz 'u 'llah Khan, the
Tailor and to Jinab-i-Azfz'u'llah Khan, the teacher at Tarbfyat
school, on my behalf. Both are dear, renowned and close companions
at the Treshhold of the Almighty.

Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Jalal and Jinab-i-Mfrza Hajf Aqa are, in
reality, each like unto the Hoopoe of Sheba, conveying the message
of the Solomon of fidelity to lands and countries abroad, spreading
the sweet savours (teaching) and erstwhile reciting the verses and
explaining the hidden meaning of the words of God with heart and
soul.

I beseech God to endow each of these honourable gentlemen
with power to shake the pillars of the East and West, and that
people will be moved by these two illumined souls.

Moreover, may Jinab-i-Mfrza Abdu'l-Husayn in the land of
Alif      be assisted by a thousand angels! Jinab-i-Akhavan Safa
will soon be sent on a mission to Mazindaran. Jinab-i-Yusuf Khan's
trip was quite proper. My hope is that by the bounty of God,
Hadrat-i-Malik Ara will obtain the beauty of the realm above. It is
my wish that both material and spiritual affairs will be set in
order.

Upon you rest the Glory of the All-Glorious!

> 'Abdu'l-Baha Abbas

He is God!

0 God! In the Books of the Prophets, Thou hast given
good news and glad-tidings to (the people of) Israel, and you
have given the promise that there would come a day when the
despair of Israel would be transformed into hope, and that those
in captivity and the downtrodden might at last find eternal
glory. That wondrous Tribe shall, under the shadow of the Lord of
Hosts, find security and settlement in the Holy Land and, from
the far lands abroad, return unto Zion. Those, who were once
lowly shall be cherished, and those who were formerly poor are
destined to become powerful.

Those, who were forgotten shall find fame and renown
and those once detested shall become the beloved of the peoples
of the world. Now, praise be to God, that day of tranquillity has
arrived, and the means of happiness and joy are now within reach.
Soon will all of Israel become glorious, and this diaspora be
transformed into regathering.

The Sun of Truth has arisen, and a ray of divine
guidance has alighted upon Israel, so that they will enter the
Holy Land from far-away routes in the utmost joy.

0 God! Fulfil Thy promise, and bring honour upon the
progeny of His Holiness Abraham. Thou art the Powerful, the Able,
and Thou art the Seer, the Hearer, the All-Wise.

-- 'Abdu'l-Baha Abbas

Introduction

For many years, there was a fireside in my home every Tuesday.

Most of the contacts were in fact fellow physicians and friends
from my years in (medical) school. It was rare that someone else
would come.

The speaker at these firesides was usually Mr. 'Abdu' 1-Karfm
Ishraq. He was educated only very minimally and could only read and
write Persian. For many years, he had worked as a tailor in my
father's (the late Azfz'u'llah Khan Azfzf 's) shop. Later he went on
to open his own tailor shop. I heard on numerous occasions from his
friends that his love for teaching was so great that even when he
was making measurements for his clients, or fitting suits on them,
he would at the same time engage in teaching them the Faith.

Sometimes this would cause a disturbance and certain of his
clients would be offended; those who were prejudiced would simply
not come back any more.

But what was most important to him was teaching, not business and
amassing a fortune. Thus he made no change in his lifestyle, to the
extent that at one point he closed down the shop and would teach
the Baha'i Faith day and night. At the same time he would economize
within his small income, even though he had a sizeable family to
support.

As a result of his love of teaching, he became so experienced
that it could be said that he had a rare gift for it. He knew by
heart most of the divine verses in past revelations regarding this
great Revelation. To win over contacts who had some objection over
one point or other, he would recite from memory proof-texts from
the Torah, Gospel or Qur'an, where relevant. Once in a while some
of my friends, along with certain other contacts, would conspire
together to come up with difficult passages in scripture to
confound him. But they never succeeded.

Mr. I.ahraq had weak hearing, so sometimes he would take advantage
of his disability to oblige his contacts to repeat their questions
twice over, as to give him more time to consider his response.
Though he would always effectively prove his point, nonetheless
everyone would leave in good spirits and none felt upset in the
slightest. Afterwards they would remark on his cleverness and
readiness to answer.

There was a young doctor among my friends who would often come to
the firesides and who was in fact quite well-spoken. The young
doctor professed to have his own school of thought, but during
their discussions, the late Mr. Ishraq discovered that his guest's
father had been a Baha' f, and that the doctor had altered the
Baha' f teachings somewhat to suit his own purposes. Under the
pretence of his "new school of thought," he would proceed to
criticize the Faith. The doctor was ready to take any religion to
task in order to hold his own with Mr. I~raq, but Mr. Ishraq was
patient with him.

Fellow physicians who stood behind the young doctor would come
regularly to witness the on-going battle. But it was always Mr.

Ishraq who would come out on top. At the height of their
popularity, these firesides would usually have on average seven to
eight contacts, and up to twelve others as an audience. Yet each
fire side would focus on the debate which would inevitably take
place between Mr. I§.hraq and one contact who would engage him in
debate.

My father took a great deal of interest in these fires ides.

Though he had a busy schedule, when guests had arrived I would let
him know and he would join in. The firesides continued without fail
until Mr. Ifill.rag passed away. The LSA of Tehran through its
teaching committee would sponsor and lend support to these
firesides. After Mr. Ishraq passed away, the firesides were
subsequently run by Mr. Rastegar and Mr. Nahvi. Then, after Mr.
Nahvi departed to India to pioneer, our fireside was left with no
one in charge and thereafter declined in popularity. It was even
cancelled for some time. Nevertheless, my father wanted the
firesides to be re-established, as he considered them important for
the family. As a result of his perseverance and the support of the
teaching committee, a well-spoken and experienced man was appointed
to the fireside: Mr. Enayat' u' l lah Fa' iz, son of the late Aqa
Mu~ammad Allaqihband Yazdi. My father had been long-time friends
with him, and together they had visited 'Abdu'l-Baha on a number of
occasions in the Holy Land. Or, at other times, my father would
send letters to 'Abdu'l-Baha through him.

Unfortunately, when he showed up to the firesides to teach, it
had lost its former popularity. Once in a while a contact would
come, and my father would attend happily, as usual. Whenever there
was a seeker present, Mr. Fa' iz would speak and we would all
listen. But if no guest came, in order to bring some warmth to the
meeting my father would reminisce about his travels and his several
attainments to 'Abdu'l-Baha's presence, and thereafter, his visits
with the Guardian.

Since my father had visited the Master on seven occasions, had
seen the Guardian on three more, had travelled to Europe twelve
times, and had accompanied Abdu'l-Baha during the latter's sojourn
in London and Paris, he naturally had a lot to say. He would relate
his memories with 'Abdu'l-Baha, and how 'Abdu'l-Baha reacted to
meeting diverse people of different cultural backgrounds. Whenever
he would make mention of some of the crises which the Master had to
deal with, my father would become filled with emotion, and we would
see a tear begin to well up in his eyes.

These stories held Jinab-i-Fa'iz spellbound, and he would lavish
praise on my father for them. He would insist that these episodes
be committed to writing and be recorded. But Jinab-i-Azizi would
not agree.

One night, however, Mr. Fa'iz insisted and flatly stated, "If you
would only bequeth to your children your memories as an
inheritance, it would be of much greater worth than a material
inheritance! So I propose that you let me take notes and compile a
book for them."

My father replied to the effect that, "I myself had in mind to
write a narrative of my travels. In fact during my various trips I

would keep a running diary. But in 1921, when I was about to visit
'Abdu'l-Baha en route through India, I received the news of his
passing. I became so distraught that I simply abandoned my notes.
Now, after forty years, you want me to recount details of events
from the depth of my memory? Isn't that a bit difficult? Don't you
realize that some points might have become muddled in my mind by
this time, and could well spark criticism from those who see only
shortcomings?"

But Jinab-i-Fa'iz convinced him that recounting history was by no
means selfish. "If you are concerned over your critics," stated
Fa'iz, "no doubt they would find fault in even the Holy Writings!
And, anyway, this book is not intended for them. The history is
first and foremost for your family. Rest assured that some few
souls might be drawn to the Faith, having been moved by the
narrative, and will serve the Faith as a result."

After detailed discussions over these concerns, my father
consented. So we determined that he would recount whatever he could
recall, Fa'iz would record these events in the form of notes and,
later on with my help, put them into sequential order. We would
then present the narrative to my father and, upon his approval,
publish the text.

Every week these notes would become increasingly voluminous. The
order was somewhat chaotic: some notes related to the first trip,
others to the second, and so forth, while certain details had faded
away, only to be remembered later on. There were times when a
particular point would be mentioned more than once.

But Fa'iz would record all these notes on separate sheets and
these were subsequently in my possession. Though very busy, later
on I put them in order as you now see. Should there exist any
errors in the text, I beg pardon from the reader, and ask for a
measure of understanding, for now both my father and Fa'iz have
passed away! My father in his late years had developed diabetes and
would become tired rather quickly at the end of the day. He would
usually come to the fireside at 6 pm and leave around 9 pm to
retire to his own residence.

I should say a few words about his place of residence. My father
had a garden of about 6,000 squares meters on Pahlavi Avenue. At
the time he bought the land, it was on the outskirts of town,
before Shah Pahlavi came to power, who created gardens and planted
trees along the streetside and called it "The Garden" (B6stan).
Following the erection of the Pahlavi Palace closeby, it was
renamed Pahlavi Avenue. At any rate, my father had built six
separate residences for his sons on his property, for whenever each
one of the sons would marry. In the centre of the estate was his
own residence and a large guest hall. On most evenings, he would
invite all his children and grandchildren for dinner at his home,
and at the dinner-table he would talk to them and give advice.

This was carried on as a family tradition till his dying days.

Before he passed away, five of his sons had their own families and
all his four daughters were married. On festive occasions, all his
sons and daughters, together with their families would come to
greet him and everyone would stay for lunch. Altogether there were

around seventy to eighty people on these occasions.

On one particular Tuesday evening during the course of our
fireside as usual, my father was dictating his reminiscences. He
happened to be describing his third visit to the Guardian. It was
close to 9 pm when I was paged to see a patient. Upon returning
(some time after 10: 30 pm), to my surprise I found my father
sitting in the same chair and still talking. I remonstrated to
Jinab-i-Fa'iz that it was not good to keep my father up till that
hour of the night, but it was my father who insisted that he wanted
to finish everything that night. I told him that it was very late
and my mother was waiting for him. But he was adamant about
accomplishing everything that night. So I did not wish to oppose
him, and at around midnight, at last he ended the narrative and
then prayed for the success of completing the project.

He stressed to Fa'iz that he did not wish to be perceived as
arrogant or proud in all this, and Fa'iz assured him this was not
the case and that, in any event, the entire text would be submitted
to him for his approval, prior to publication. Fa'iz also assured
him that the text would be submitted to the review board for
authorization to publish. This assurance filled my father with joy
and an obvious sense of satisfaction, whereupon he left to return
home.

Whenever I remember that last night of his recounting his
memoirs, I feel some sadness, for the next Tuesday evening he was
no longer among us. That is why it all had to be completed on that
special night. By the following Tuesday he was destined to pass
away, though there were no signs of illness that would end in
death.

The night before his passing, he complained of some pain in his
stomach. He called me to his bedside in the middle of the night,
but with a little medication he recovered and the next day he felt
no pain. Even so, at my insistence, he took rest at home. That
evening, most of his sons and daughters were gathered in the room
next to his bedroom, and I myself wanted to stay the night at his
residence. At 11 pm on Sunday, the 14th of Isfand, 1328 AH (March
4, 1950), he passed away in peace. Whatever measures Prof. Manucher
Hakim took to revive him were of no avail. My father was gone.

After his passing, the fol lowing telegram arrived from the
Guardian:

"We offer our assurance to you and your loved ones of
> our ardent prayers for the exaltation of the station of this one
> who ascended to God. "
> --Shoghi (unofficial translation)
> I have always told my brothers and friends that, upon reflection,
my father must have experienced some forewarning that this would be
his last opportunity to finish his memoirs that final Tuesday
night, which alone could explain why he had determined to stay up
as late as was necessary. Another rather mystical occurrence was a
dream my father had, which made him quite upset. He dreamed that he
was leaving town in an exquisite black car, but suddenly the car

vanished from view and he found himself alone. After searching he
came across a horse and carriage which he hired for two tumans to
take him back to town. But as he rode the carriage, it too,
suddenly disappeared. And the day was about to end as well. Then
the same thing happened all over again until he woke up startled
and fearful.

On hearing this, I chuckled and stated that this dream was the
result of the day's events and could be explained by what these
events suggested. "First of al 1," I said, "You have an elegant
black car, which sometimes your sons or daughters use, obliging you
to hire a horse and carriage. Because of your various construction
projects, you deal day-to-day with porters and labourers," and I
went on to complete the picture. But my father shook his head,
smiled, and went on.

Two or three days later, I myself had a dream. I saw that a large
crowd was coming out of his guest room. There were in fact so many
present that the entire garden and the street outside were filled
with people. I recall thinking to myself in the dream, "Why is it
that all these people were gathered in the guest room?" My father
and I, in this dream, were standing at the exit door, greeting
guests as they left. Then two old friends of my father, the late
Dr. Yunis Khan Afrukbtih and the late Mr. Dabir Mu'ayyad, stood on
both sides of my father and asked him very kindly to go with them.
He accepted, and accompanied them to the middle of the garden, but
he just stood there, put his hands on each one's back and said,
"You go. I will come on my own."

Since I am not inclined to follow superstition, I paid no heed to
that dream, especially for my own peace of mind. I told myself
"Thank God my father had not gone away with them." But when these
events manifested themselves, I was amazed at the prophetic meaning
of my dream.

The death of my father left the Azizi family without its
guardian, and his passing was a cause of remorse for his many
friends. 'Abdu'l-Baha had told my father: "Inscribe in the margin
of your book:    All the forces of the world are being defeated.
Have patience for a few years. The light of the Revelation of
Baha'u'llah will envelop the whole world." *

On the ninth day after his passing, his business off ice was
opened in the presence of some of his friends. On his desktop was
found his Will and Testament. It seems he had not taken his dream
lightly, for at the beginning of the Will, he states:

"I, Aziz'u'llah Azizi, with utmost humility before the threshold
of God, do hereby, with sound mind and body, write this Will and
Testament with the following provisions:

*(General Dr. Bar-Afrukbtih, while in Paris, had seen the notes of Mr. Dreyfus,
taken while 'Abdu' 1-Baha was in Paris. These notes were given to Dr. Bar-Afrukhtih
by Madam Dreyfus, and, in turn, Dr. Bar-Abrukhtih gave me a copy, in which this
was independently recorded. This is why I placed this quotation as a frontispiece
for this book.)

.•. My children, sons and daughters, alike, I exhort you to unity
and cooperation one with another, under the shadow of the Cause of
God. Consort with each other with joy and contentment and show
forth kindness to each other." (For certain reasons, the text of
the Will is not cited here in full.)

It goes without saying that those who survive Jinab-i-Azizi are
forever grateful to Jinab-i-Fa'iz, for having been the one without
whom this narrative might never have evolved into the priceless
treasure that it is. His sincerity and perseverance throughout all
his firesides not only deserve recognition, but should serve as an
example for us.

On the eve of his departure to Belgium as a pioneer, the late
Fa'iz entrusted his notes to me so that I might edit them and
arrange them in their present order. It was unfortunate that I
could not complete the entire project with his assistance. But we
were always in correspondence with each other until the book took
final form, when I requested he write a Foreword and send it from
Belgium. As always, he accepted with characteristic graciousness
and, in fine handwriting, put forth the reasons for writing this
book, as appears in the following pages.

Why This Work is Entitled "Taj-i-Vahhaj" or   "Crown of Glory"

I recall when my father ended his memoirs and the late Fa'iz had
finished recording them, he asked my father, "What should we call
the book?" The late Mr. Azizi gazed serenely at him and said, "You
yourself know." Whereupon Mr. Fa'iz responded, "Since in one of the
Tablets in your honour 'Abdu'l-Baha has stated, 'Attire thy head
with the " Taj-i-Vahhaj", we will call the book "Crown of Glory."

My father accepted this forthwith, and since Mr. Fa'iz in his
letters from Belgium would himself refer to the narrative as Taj-i-
Vahhaj, out of respect for the wishes of each, this work is so
named.

Belgium

Dear friend, Dr. Zabfh'u'llah Azfzf

I had the good pleasure of reading in your letter news of the
imminent publication of Taj-i-Vahhaj, the narrative of your
honourable father Jinab-i-Azfz'u'llah Azfzf, the announcement of
which elates me considerably.

It is true to say that this dear spiritual soul had the distinct
honour of serving the Cause throughout his adult life. He was a
gifted tailor, and as such was commissioned to tailor apparel for
His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Baha. Your father was always the recipient of
His blessings.

Of this, the sacred Tablets in your father's honour bear eloquent
testimony, and are sufficient witness such that no other proof is
needed.

You had requested I write a Preface detailing the circumstances
and reasons which gave rise to this book and, though I have but
little time to spare, I will accept your request and forward the
preface to you.

Yours, E. Fa'iz

Preface

As the reader probably knows, I was appointed by the Teaching
Committee (under the auspices of the Spiritual Assembly of Tehran),
to serve in the capacity of teacher at the firesides held in the
Azizi's home. This I accepted whole-heartedly to do. Therefore,
without fail, I was present every Tuesday evening at 6 pm.

One day, I encountered Jinab-i-Azizi in the waiting room, and at
the time he was reminiscing about the past. Upon hearing this I
exclaimed, "Jinab-i-Azizi! What a precious treasure you have left
for your children!" He replied, "By the blessing of God, and after
a great deal of hardship, I have earned sufficient funds to ensure
that each will live comfortably after me and can serve the Cause."
I said, "Pardon me, but I was not referring to material wealth at
al 1, for that is none of my business anyway. What I meant was
spiritual treasure and eternal fortune. I have known myself from my
late father, Haji Muhammad Yazdi, that you have attained the
presence of both the M~ster and the Guardian on several occasions,
and that you have precious memories of them. Are any of these
experiences written down? Is there any compilation of them?"

I went on to say that, in my estimation, this treasure is more
precious than all the properties of Tehran, and it would be an
irretrievable loss if his memoirs were not preserved after his
passing. At which Jinab-i-Azizi said: "I know that your father
himself rendered service to 'Abdu'l-Baha by carrying letters to
him, and you yourself are a good man at heart, therefore I will
agree to record my memoirs if you write them down. Yes, by all
means, I will come to you and relate all my experiences."

I felt like a pauper who chanced upon a treasure-chest of gold!

I became delighted and, since pen and paper were handy, I proposed
we start immediately, since there was no seeker present. I asked
him to start with his very first journey, to which he agreed, and
the first page was completed that night.

His style was simple and sweet. Weeks and then months passed
while all this continued. One night, it went on very late, when I
recall you came back from visiting a patient. You saw your father
still awake and me busy writing away. It was only proper that you
as a conscientious physician brought up the fact that it was very
late and that your father should take a rest, and that Fa'iz is
tired, too, and it would be best to leave the rest for next
Tuesday. Your father smiled in a bitter-sweet way and said, "This
is the last of my journeys, and then my memoirs will be complete.
I should finish and then go to bed." Half an hour later everything
was recorded and Jinab-i-Azizi was right that it should be so, for
by the fol lowing Tuesday he was in ever lasting rest. That next
Tuesday there was a memorial for him, as he had passed away on
Sunday, the 24th of Isfand, 1328 A.H (March 4, 1950).
Even so,

> The fire of Love will scarcely be slain after death,
For this is a lamp taken from one home to the next.

Tablet of BAHA'U'LLAH to   ~aji   Eliahu Cohan, known as   'Abd-~usayn

In the name of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Mighty.

Today is the day on which God, from His Throne, is calling
all the denominations and the inhabitants of the earth,
commanding them to exalt and sactify the Name of God.

Today is the day, on which heavenly angels are at every
moment descending with the chalices of utterance and the
decanters of the Knowledge of God, spreading the sanctified, pure
and divine fragrances.

Say, the Promised God says: "O people of Judaism, you were
from Me, I made you to appear and I called you back to Me, what
happened that you do not know Me now, even though I have appeared
with all possible signs.

You have considered enemies as your friends and abandoned
the True Friend.

Today the New Heaven hath appeared and the earth hath been
renewed. If you look with pure eyes, you will see the New
Jerusalem and i f you listen with attentive ears, you will hear
the call of God.

Today all things are calling you and inviting you to God,
while you are so intoxicated with the wine of pride, that not
even for a moment did you heed the call.

The ear is   to hear My Call and the eye is to see My
Beauty; listen and   shun any other but Me. The dome of God hath
been raised by the   hand of the Bounty of God, and the Cause of
God hath appeared.   The times of bygones are passed.

A new time of fulfilment hath been reached and by the
Will of God, everything hath been renewed. However, only the new
eye can see and the new mind can comprehend this condition.

The Beginning and the End alluded to One Sacred Word,
which hath appeared and come, which is the Spirit of the Divine
Books and Scriptures. This Word hath existed from the beginning
that hath no beginning until the end that hath no end. This is
the key to the greatest Divine Treausure and Hidden Mystery,
which had forever been hidden behind the veils of innocence. This
is the mystery "A" and "YA" that John prophesied. Verily, it is
the Beginning, the End, the Manifest and the Hidden.

0 'Abd-?usayn, may God assist you in giving the joyful
tidings revealed in the sacred scriptures of the past to the
peoples of all denominations. For these glad tidings are as
living water to the dead of the world. Well is it with him, who

drinks of it and woe unto the deprived.

Say, today the City of God hath appeared and can be
witnessed in perfect adornment. This is the City, in which the
God of all peoples hath appeared. Ponder these words of John, who
announced the great and sacred city and said: "I did not see a
temple in the city, because its temple is the Lord God Almighty
and the Lamb. The city hath no need of the sun or the moon to
shine on it, because the Glory of God shines on it, and the Lamb
is its lamp."*

In the name of Truth, take hold of the cane of reliance on
God and with the utmost detachment, guide the people who have
gone astray to the great divine city, so that perchance the
people who are lost may attain to the true homeland and the blind
may see with perceiving eyes. He hath power over all things. All
things are in His power and captive in His hand. He is Powerful
and Mighty.

Birth

In the year 1252 of the Islamic calendar (approximately 1873

A.D.), during the course of the festivities of Rosh Ha-Shanah (New
Year), one of the holiest days of the Jewish calendar, the Almighty
God bestowed a son to a poor but faithful and orthodox Jewish
family who had no male descendants. The son was given the name
Isaac.

The father in this family had always prayed to God to give
him a son, whom he might raise up in the sacred Jewish tradition,
and make him his successor in life, so that his descendants might
ever worship God the Almighty, and show compassion to all His
creatures and to all mankind.

When news reached him of the birth of his son, members of
the family exclaimed, "Your prayers are answered! God has given you
a male child!" The father did not believe it at first, and was
assured at last only when he, so to speak, examined closely •••

This pious man was renowned for his godly character, and was
known as Rabbi Daniel (Ibrahim), who earned his livelihood by
peddling. His family consisted of his wife and two daughters (of
the five daughters his wife had given birth to). Though not
wealthy, his eldest daughter Miriam decided to have a celebration.
She took over the domestic affairs of the home, and apart from the
task of preparing the feast and taking care of her younger sister
at the same time, she made sure to look after her parents as well.

The father was endlessly happy over this event and, though
limited by poverty, he threw a party and even arranged for
musicians to play in order to spend time for a few days in a manner
different from the usual. Though he had named his son Ezra this
child was so dear to him that he became known as Aziz and later as
Aziz'u'llah ("Endeared of God").

Since in those days over half of the infants would die in
their first years of life due to poor hygiene and poverty, our
relatives and family friends took extra care to protect this child
from all risks. For instance, they would not even put this child
down to sleep on the floor at night, fearing the very earth would
beckon him early, believing that in this way they would secure for
him longer life. This perhaps is the best example of what might
characterize the mentality and superstitions of that time.

The child was barely five years old when his father began to
send him to a local maktab (a traditional school for reading and
writing in the home of a Jewish rabbi) where he started to learn
Hebrew.   In the evenings, he would learn the verses of the Torah
from his father and would memorize them before going to sleep in
his father's room each night.

Frequently the present writer heard from his father
(Aziz'u'llah) how he would wake at dawn hearing his own father
crying out earnestly to God in prayer. If he paid close attention,
his father could be heard asking God that he might find a sack full
or money to be free of all his hardship and poverty.
This child had an uncle who was rich, wise, caring and quite

generous. After the age of seven or eight, the child would spend
most of his time with this uncle. The uncle was called Rabbi Amran.
He was chief and judge over the Jewish ghetto, and most of his time
was spent settling family disputes and problems. People would turn
to him and show him great respect. As he would enter the synagogue,
everyone would become silent out of respect. There he would preach
to the Jewish people, and sometimes would reproach them for reading
only the Torah. "It's not enough to read only the Torah," he would
say, "We should read from other books as well."

One example of his behaviour and way of thinking, was that
he would, early most mornings sweep and rinse off the front porch
and would likewise encourage others to maintain a good standard of
cleanliness. He actually wanted people to take him as an example,
and whenever he would pass an untidy house, the very next day he
would, bright and early, march up to that porch and proceed to
personally sweep and polish that porch, hoping that the owner would
catch on. Of course the uncle was not always successful in his
mission, since people were not careful to keep their homes as clean
as they should.

In fact the neighbourhood was quite over-crowded and run
down, with no regard nor means for public maintenance. Alleys were
narrow and the houses poor and made of mud. In winters, these
alleys remained muddy and in summer were always dusty. Few houses
had trees. This district was totally lacking in water supply and in
public sanitation.

Garbage would usually be thrown to the sides of the streets
and alleys, and as a result of this rotting and putrid garbage,
flies and other vermin would breed freely. Not only was this
offensive to passers-by, but worse still, it was the source of
epidemics of various diseases. These people (the Jewish sector)
lacked the financial means to deal with their problems, and were
not given the freedom to act on their own as a community.
Furthermore, the authorities of that time were not at all concerned
with the affairs of the Jewish community since those outside the
Islamic community were considered impure, and thus subject to
second class treatment. Under these circumstances, the condition of
the Jews was only aggravated, adding to their discouragement, and
making them resentful.

In such a backward society, this bright and talented young
boy continued to grow and develop past the seventh and eighth years
of age. Day-time found him attending the maktab, and at nights
under his father's guidance he would study religious texts such as
stories from the Torah. The present writer frequently heard from
his father the following about his father (the grandfather of the
author):

(The remainder of this narrative is presented in the first
person as related by Jinab-i-Azizi himself. English Ed)

"The poverty of my father, the lack of opportunities for
work, the distress of my mother, and the anguish of members of my

family caused me to suffer, and at last I resolved that I should
make every effort to save this family. Any discomfort brought on by
lack of means would only deepen my resolve and make me more
determined. Though I was still a child, I had made a firm decision
to arise and rescue my father from these circumstances. I was
unsure however, as to what profession to pursue to this end.

Because I was able to look at things with an open mind with
a view toward the future, I began to think about a trade with
potential for expansion and some weal th. But launching on any
business venture required capital, not to mention training and
education--all of which I lacked. With the assistance of my uncle,
at last I chose tailoring, which was the most respectable and
creative profession available. Tailoring, at that time, was a
profession exclusive to Armenians, and there were very few from
other religious communities who would pursue it. With little
choice--and entirely secret from my father--! started to work in a
small tailoring shop, owned by an Armenian. I was not paid for my
work, and took the job hoping only to learn the craft. After some
time passed, my master became aware of my hard work and
dependability, and hired me at minimum wage. This brought me great
satisfaction and happiness, for even then at that tender age, I
realized that the future of this profession was bright and had
excellent prospects. For this reason, I took on my job with
optimism and dedication, looking forward to a bright future and
hoping for divine blessings. To make mention of the hardships of
this period, makes me somewhat sad, and it is not my wish to affect
the reader at all in the same way. On the other hand, though our
religious values include the principles of self-respect, respect
for others, and the preservation of human dignity, it serves a
purpose to write about the past, pointing out the mentality and the
patterns of behaviour of the time. Since my purpose is to make this
narrative a lesson of life for my family, I will just mention two
further episodes in this regard:

(1) I was six years old, when, due to a sore throat, it was
decided that my tonsils should be removed. Since I was so dear to
my uncle, and as he was the most influential member of the family,
he took charge of this situation. He took me on foot to a distant
location, to the residence of a doctor who had just returned from
Europe. The doctor right away cut and removed my tonsils and put
them on a piece of paper and placed it on the palm of my hand and
dismissed us. My considerate and thoughtful uncle took me back home
on foot, but because of various business engagements, he dropped in
at a number of different places. Since he had longer strides than
I, I was running to keep up with him, and to make a long story
short, as we finally arrived home at dusk, I fainted due to
bleeding and exhaustion. My tonsils, in the meantime, had dried on
the piece of tissue. I mention this story to give you an example of
the kind of treatment given by a wise and understanding man, with
a beloved child, according to the standards of the time. You can
well imagine, therefore, the treatment by ordinary people of their
own children or of other children!
(2) When I started to work, one night the wife of my employer

ordered me to bring a bucket of water, drawn from a water pump,
which was located in a very deep underground water storage tank.*
The bucket was so big for me, and the reservoir so deep and dark,
that I lost my balance and was thrown into a chuckhole down there.
Above my eyebrow, I was cut and bleeding, and one of my ribs was
broken, yet I still filled my bucket and brought it for the
master's wife. Rather than comfort me and tend to my injuries, she
scolded me for being so late and clumsy.

Later on in life, I experienced discomfort with my back, and
after a medical examination in Europe, it was diagnosed as having
been caused by the fracture of the rib, back in childhood. In fact,
the way that my rib had fused itself together, quite amazed the
examining physicians. At that time, no one paid any attention to my
pain and no one made any attempt to seek treatment for it. I was
kept busy with my work, and the rib fused itself together.

One day I was preparing the iron for my master. In those
days, irons were warmed up with wood charcoal. Out of negligence,
a tiny piece of charcoal fell under my foot and was crushed and
wasted, and though that piece was worth less than a penny in those
days, my master slapped me so hard for this wastefulness, that I
was bedridden for one week.

Such was my life until the age of seventeen, when, after
having gained through experience enough knowledge and skill in
tailoring, my desire for moving on and becoming independent
prompted me to open up my own dakke (a little stand or make-shift
shop in a space in the marketplace). I started to work immediately-
-not for my own customers but rather for other tailors.

For instance, I would sew a few pairs of pants for an
Armenian tailor shop (in that time the most well-known tailors were
Armenian) and was content with every little profit. Yet in order to
earn more, I would continue to cut and sew until long after
midnight. I was at a stage in my life when I had to work very hard
because I was responsible for the support of my parents as well as
my brothers and sisters. In fact, I was in charge of the entire
family, and except for earning a wage, there was no other way to
meet family expenses.

It would not be out of place to relate how owning my own
tailor shop came about. At that time I had no capital, but with the
help of my uncle I managed to borrow a small sum of money, and with
that money, I bought one ironing table, an iron, and a sewing
machine, along with a pair of scissors. All of these items were
accounted as colateral with the lender. I had to work in such ways
as to earn enough to pay the rent for the shop, satisfy the
interest on the money I borrowed, and on top of that, meet the
expenses of my family, and above all else, try to save if possible,
some earnings to pay my debt and free my belongings from

*(In that time, due to the lack of public water pipes, residences would make use
of a large storage tank where water would be kept for a few months at a time.
Usually people would try to make this storage tank- which was call abanbar -- as
large as possible, in order not to be in need of others.

collateral.

For these reasons, most nights I would work till dawn.

By the grace of God, in a couple of years, at last I had
established myself, paid off my debts, was successful in my work,
and managed to put away some savings, while all the time my mind
was occupied with making advancements in life and increasing the
success of my trade.

During this period in my life, I began to feel a growing
humiliation because of the religious discrimination against me. It
was difficult to get out of the ghetto. I had no opportunity to
attend a public gathering, as I was not permitted to enter into
crowded places, such as the bazaar. If my hands would touch
anything, it would get the Moslems mad, and all the time I was
called, "najes," which means "impure." In those days when it
rained, Jews were not permitted out of their homes, because if
their clothes were to get wet and they came into contact with a
Moslem, it would make that Moslem impure. This would create public
unrest and would result in punishment of the offending Jew, even if
the defiled Moslem was a porter or a man of no honour and the Jew
a man of respect. These superstitions were so extreme and so varied
that a separate book could be written on that subject alone. Since
this is not our object, though, we leave it at that.

These incidents left no small impact on my mind, and would
haunt me continually. I could clearly see that there was no real
difference between us and other human beings. Indeed my talents
were equal to any man's, and more! Certainly my understanding and
common sense were no less than others. Furthermore, my drive to
succeed and to aspire after everlasting blessings, caused me to
seek whatever means possible to achieve my goals.

At first I thought perhaps it was the way I dressed or
behaved that incurred the hatred of others, so I tried my best to
be clean and neatly dressed, and in public I would be polite and
respectful of others, and I presented myself respectably and with
dignity. Unfortunately, the more I tried the less success I had,
and I became more and more the target of jealousy and malice.

As a result of the education and upbringing given to me by
my father as a youth, I was very religious and even prejudiced,
following as I did the teachings and customs of the religion of the
Jews. I had no shortcomings with respect to the reading of the
Torah or other religious texts. I was quite deepened and would
meditate on each verse, looking for its true meaning. It is true
that my knowledge of the Torah was well-grounded, and there was no
aspect that was beyond my grasp. Indeed, I had memorised most of
the verses of the Torah together with their meaning and that made
my father deeply proud of me. He was expecting great things of me -
- a bright future -- for the cause of the Jews. He was hoping I
would become a rabbi. But I had no desire to become a kind of rabbi
and to sit on a spiritual throne.

When during the course of my reading the Torah, I
encountered verses concerning the "Day of God." I would read that
in that Day, the "Wolf and the Lamb" would drink from the same
stream, and injustice and discord would vanish and equality and

brotherhood would be established and so forth. It was my utmost
wish--indeed the very thought brought me fulfilment -- that mankind
would soon experience this blessed vision and all these enmities,
religious prejudices and inequalities between the sexes might
disappear. In short, all these circumstances helped prepare me and
make me receptive to the truth and acceptance of divine bestowals,
until at last I met and begin to socialize with the Baha'fs, as I
will explain in detail later •••••

Teaching the Faith in the Jewish Community

Close to 60 years ago, around the year of 1272 A.H. (1890 A.O.),
a man known as Hajf Eliahu returned from the Holy Land and was
secretly socializing with the Jews, in order to teach the Cause of
God. Orthodox Jews, aware of his activities, would call him names
in public and would insult this man of God in the streets and
marketplace. Children, encouraged by their parents, would throw
stones at him. This opposition was especially strong from my
father, Rabbi Daniel, who was one of the most prejudiced and
influential of the Jewish spiritual leaders. The matter came to a
head one day when a group of men felt agitated by his wisdom and
reason. As is the way of ill-intentioned men, they caught him by
surprise in one of the alleys of the ghetto and beat him
relentlessly probably with the intention to kill him. A goodhearted
man was passing by and immediately reported the incident to Mirza
Aqa Jan Gilavani (later known as Majzub) who was related to my
father. He was told that one of his relatives was being beaten to
death. Mirza' Aqa Jan Gilavani Majzub, went straightaway to save
him and delivered him from their hands. He took him to the house he
rented (which was owned by Mirza Aqa Jan Bolbol), where he provided
a bed for him in one room and began to attend to him to help him
recover.

Mirza Aqa Jan Bolbol, before accepting the Faith, was a wine
seller.   This job was customary at that time and involved making
wine at home. As he came home in order to pick-up and deliver some
wine for his customers, he learned that Hajf El iahu had been
brought to his home. He became extremely upset. (Mirza Aqa Jan
Bolbol told me repeatedly). Mirza Aqa Jan Bolbol, flew into a rage
and exclaimed, "I have just heard that Hajf Eliahu -- who has
turned against his own religion and beco~e an atheist--has been
brought to my house?" The homeowner later said, "My knees suddenly
weakened and somewhat paralysed. I grew pale and felt so ill, that
I could not keep my balance. So I sat down on the porch stairs in
the yard outside, and as I began to regain my senses, I shouted
out, "How dare you bring this infidel and apostate into my house?"
In the end, I was reduced to tears of frustration and under my
breath I was muttering that my entire wine supply was turned
impure. Then I turned to Mirza Aqa Jan Gilavani (Majzub) and threw
insults and screams at him."

Anyway, this disturbance continued well into the day until Mirza
Aqa Jan Bolbol calmed down. Mirza Aqa Jan Gilavani went to him and

apologized, and in the end, convinced the homeowner to visit ~aji
Eliahu to hear what kind of nonsense he was saying. Haji's words
were so unimportant to them both, that they considered. whatever he
would have to say as having no value. So at the insistence of Mirza
Aqa Jan Gilavani, Mirza Aqa Jan Bolbol reluctantly went with him to
visit Haji Eliahu.

To their surprise, they found the ~aji talking in a calm and kind
manner, in spite of the abuse, insults and physical beating he had
just suffered. The ~aji had also been quite aware of the yelling
and cursing of the landlord. The ~aji's remarks were full of truth
and sincerity; he would mention nothing apart from faith and God.
Whatever the ~aji would say, he would back up with verses of the
Torah, directing all his remarks to the landlord and his tenant.
Both calmed down, and were drawn to the Haji' s kindliness and
sweetness of speech.                         ·

The next and fol lowing days, they went to see him again and
again, till they became intoxicated and entranced by his discourses
and solid proofs. This continued until one day they referred these
matters to a person more knowledgeable than they: Mirza Ibrahim
Khay at (father of Mr. Khojasteh, who had a pharmacy on Nasir
Khusraw Avenue).     Theytold him the whole story and sought his
actvice. Mirza Ibrahim Igiayat, responded with sarcasm, but as he
found them nevertheless persistent, he started to verbally attack
and insult these two. But their insistence paid off, Bolbol and
Majzub managed to drag him along to see tJaji Eliahu. In the
presence of the ~aji, Mirza Ibrahim became also drawn to him. ~aji
Eliahu succeeded in making known to them the love of Jesus, by
means of his tenderness and love. Through his teaching, they came
to know that Jesus was from God. When later, they became believers
in the (Baha'i) Faith through Jinab-i-Haji-Mulla 'Ali Akbar
Shahmirzadi, who was a Hand of the Cause of God in the time of
~ha'u'llah, they went on to accept ~uhammad as the messenger of
God and thereafter the Bab and Baha'u'liah. At last these four men
began to teach the Faith in the Jewish ghetto: ~aji Eliahu was, as
it were, the standard bearer, with Mirza Ibrahim £i.hayat (also a
tailor) the torch bearer, Mirza Aqa Jan Bolbol the minstrel of the
four, and Mirza Aqa Jan Majzub was the one who would render service
to the group as a whole. On many occasions, I would hear Mirza Aqa
Jan Bolbol say, with a wistful and emotion-laden voice: "From that
moment on, I abandoned wine selling and besought God to forgive my
sins."

This group of four knew well that they would meet with no success
among the very prejudiced elders there, so they approached the
youth, and started to speak to them. They invited them to come and
see Mirza Aqa Jan Majzub, acquainting them with the Faith and
cultivating a seed of love for it in their hearts.

As a consequence, these activities provoked complaints and
eventually continued residence in the ghetto became impossible for
them. So Mirza Aqa Jan Majzub left the ghetto and moved to the
vicinity of the Qazvin Gate district of Tehran. Thus, the very
house that for some time was the hiding place for Jinab-i-Mirza
Ma~mud Furughi, in fact became a proof of the verse of the Torah:

"Those who were as wolves held lambs in loving embrace, and would
protect them with heart and soul from the onslaught of enemies."

( A verse from the Torah.)

Account of the Conversion to the Faith of Jinab-i-Aziz'u'llah Azizi

Among these youth, who were my close friends, with whom we found
our way to this sacred threshold, were Jinab-i-Arastu Khan Hakim,
Dr. Ayyub Khan, Aziz Eliahu (paternal uncle of JiO':ib-i-Mirza

'Abd'u'llah Abrishami), myself and a number of other Jewish youth,
who did not have the bounty and honour of accepting the Faith.
Most of the time, I would take my younger brother Aqa Murtida with
me to these firesides. Each of the youth would ask a question and
Jinab-i-Furughf would respond with utmost love and kindness.

At certain meetings, a most radiant elderly man named Mul la
~uhammad Rida-Yazdi, was present. He had much regard for the youth
and his sincerity attracted them so that they would not waste a
moment's effort to strive and seek after the truth. Other youth
were hesitant and suspicious of his attention and love towards
them, and feared this was but a trick to lure them into the Faith

We continued to gather together often, until at one point, we
found our way to the home of ijajf Mulla Alf Akbar ~hahmirzadi, Hand
of the Cause, who was residing near the Jewish ghetto.          This
honourable and knowledgeable gentleman was very kind to us. Through
his powerful and thought-provoking discourses, he would answer our
objections and misunderstandings. Due to the persuasive power of
his proofs, the truth of the Faith became evident to me and one
could say that I was half-converted. Yet the type of faith and
conviction which consumes heart and soul, the kind of faith which
leaves no room for doubt or questioning, the type of faith which
renders one intoxicated and in a state of wonderment, to the extent
that one would sacrifice life and wealth, had not yet arisen in me.

Even so, Jinab-i-Aqa Jan Bolbol, Mirza Aqa Jan Gilavani, known as
Majzub, Mirza Tglalil (father of Mr. Arjomand), and Mirza Ibrahim
Khayyat all declared, were very steadfast in their faith, and would
o bserve all the principles of the Baha'i Faith.

-
Mirza Khalil was one of the respected and confident members of
Jewish society, and therefore, his conversion to the Cause of the
Blessed Beauty created much commotion. One day, 2ajf Elliahu, as I
have mentioned, was taking refuge in the home of Nur-Mahmud out of
fear of his enemies, and in the meantime was secretly teaching the
Faith to Mirza ~ahmud's son-in-law, Mirza Ayyub. After embracing
the Faith, Mirza !S.,halil, who had a very modest home in the Ghetto,
put his house in the service of Baha'i teachers and many would
frequent his house. For instance, one day Jinab-i-pajf Mirza ~aydar
'Alf and Jinab-i-Varqa-i-Shahid entered that home where I met them
as I also visited this place often for deepening.

Jinab-i-Varqa had recently returned from the Holy Land and Mirza
§Jlalil had invited a group of Jews and Rabbis to benefit from his
teaching and to ask whatever questions they had and present any

concerns. We ourselves sat quietly in a corner and were witnessing
the discussion taking place. Unfortunately, instead of deriving
benefit and learning some truths, they were busy arguing and would
often change the subject. Out of prejudice and the habit of
clinging to their old beliefs, they were not really ready to listen
to any truthful fact whatever. Such was the case until Jinab-i-
Varqa stated, "There is a verse from His Holiness Joshua, to this
effect: 'Eye to eye, see that they will bring the Lord back to
Zion". (a verse of Joshua). And then he said, "I saw this with my
own eyes."

The Rabbis, who could not bear to hear things like this, began to
insult him. Disregarding manners and courtesy, they said, "If you
saw God, may both your eyes be blinded if you lie." This
contemptuous attitude from them, in contrast to the gracious and
courteous manner of Jinab-i-Varqa, who so eloquently marshalled
proofs and cited verses from the Torah, moved me to the extent that
I recognised the truth, and realized that in every age, the chief
source of denial has ever been this kind of unjust, stubborn, and
proud people.     At any rate, this baseless response from Jewish
religious leaders to the powerful and persuasive discourses of
Jinab-i-Varqa stirred me to such depths that I surrendered my will
right then and there. My faith was confirmed, and I took on the
path of service to Baha'u'llah.

Following this event, other instances like this took place in the
home of Mirza !Q!alil, and the situation there became so difficult
and troublesome for him, that he was forced to leave the Jewish
ghetto. So he sold his house and moved to Qasvin Gate, but he would
not put an end to his teaching efforts. Every night he invited
gifted and receptive youth to his home, and on occasion, Jinab-i-
Shaykh MuI:iammad 'Ali Qaini, went to his house and read aloud
tablets of Baha'u'llah.

As a result of frequenting this house, and socializing with the
friends there, especially with individuals like Jinab-i-~aji ~ulla
'Ali Akbar fillahmirzadi (Hand of the Cause), §.bay!Ul ~u~ammad 'Ali,
~aji ~u~ammad Allaqiband Yazdi, Nayyer and Sina, Aqa ~uhammad Rida
and his son along with Haji Abul-Hasan Ardekani (Haji Amin) and
Fayzeh Jiltanum - I forged . strong friendships. Beyond what benefits
I derived from socializing and interacting with these individuals,
I compared what I heard from them with what I knew from the Torah.

Especially on Fridays and holidays I would go with them to
various gardens throughout the suburbs of Tehran, and I was always
on the alert to learn and add to my knowledge. It was then that
Yunis K_han Afrouhteh - who later became known as Dr. Yunis IQtan -
along with Dr. Arastu Kban Hakim (Father of Mr. G._holam ~usayn Kj1.an
and Prof. Manucher Hakim) were summoned to the Holy Land. Since
Mirza Aristu Khan was a very sincere and kind friend of mine, I
called upon hi'ffito act as my go-between and to ask that I too might
be given permission for pilgrimage.

From Jewish Traditions To Baha'f Practices

Not long after my acceptance of the Faith, I became unwilling to
attend synagogue, and to observe Sabbath rituals according to
Hebrew custom. Still, I did not dare to tell my father this fact
for he was so prejudiced, ill-tempered, rough and foul-mouthed. I
was waiting for an opportune time to break this news to him, and in
the meantime I engaged myself in learning Baha'i practices,
observing them secretly. Then an event took place which enabled me
to free myself from the hold of the synagogue.

My progress, both materially and spiritually, went hand-in-hand.

By the bounty and grace of God, I cared for spiritual matters. As
a result of my discipline, hard work and thrift, I was not
materially lacking either. My life was good -- much better than
before. In accordance with the command of Baha'u'llah, I took great
care to be tidy and clean. I let my hair grow longer and took care
grooming it. This was not looked upon favourably at the time and
was considered somewhat anti-religious. Not only was this not
practiced among Jews, but pious Muslims would shave their heads and
cut short their beards. They would consider shaving their beards a
sin. Only the friends of God (i.e. the Baha'is) following the wish
of the Blessed Beauty, would grow their hair for the sake of beauty
and would shave their faces according to the practice prevalent
among advanced countries.

One Sabbath, after having closed my shop, it happened that, out
of respect for my father I reluctantly attended the synagogue, when
a very rude youth jumped at me, yanked off my hat and shouted:
"Look everyone, look at this! What kind of religious observance is
this? Just look at the hair of this son of the rabbi, take a look
at his hair! With him like this, what are others going to do? This
kind of behaviour from a youth causes others to go astray also."

There was no foul word which did not fall from his lips and no
insult he failed to invent. I was just standing there, quiet and
composed. I just looked at him and said nothing.        Since I had
earned the respect of my peers, and my father had always taken
pride in such a son, who had brought respect, honour and solace to
his father and family, this attack on my honour hurt very deeply.

I used this episode as an excuse not to go to the synagogues
anymore. At first, my father would be silent about it, and later on
he could not force me to go, as he no longer had the same authority
and influence over me as previously. But, the gentle behaviour of
the Baha'fs and their kindness, together with my own attraction to
the Baha'i Faith, impelled me to be present at many of their
gatherings and feasts. I also willingly offered my services.

Of course, these activities could not be kept secret for long,
and news of some of this eventually reached my father's ears At
first, he refused to believe what he was told. But my continued
involvement, itself considered a sin, together with my neglect of
Jewish custom and ritual and my conspicuous absence from the
synagogue, would cause my father to wonder and doubt. Still, he
could not imagine how a child of a rabbi, with such deep knowledge
of the Torah and sacred tradition, could suffer himself to be

misled and join ranks with the Baha'i religion, which to him was
manmade and baseless. But over time, repeated events increased his
suspicion and eventually he grew certain that the child he had so
implored God to grant him, so that it might become a faithful
observer of Jewish tradition, had easily slipped from his grasp.

> How Father Attempts to Prevent the Baha'i Faith from being Taught
> Among the Jewish People

My father was among the most severe opponents of the Baha'i
Faith, and was ever trying to find means to prevent Jewish youth
from associating with the Baha'is. To accomplish this, he would
seize any opportunity possible, even to the extent of forbidding
school and study.

In those days, there was a school established by the French in
Tehran. It was supervised by Monsieur Kazes. My father was very
dissatisfied and would often bring complaints to the principal of
the school. He would insult Kazes and demand that only the Torah be
taught in school and nothing else. He would even complain about the
plight of his own son and had begged the principal to show him a
solution.

The interested reader should believe that I am not exaggerating.

My father went to great pains to achieve his objective, and cursed
insistently the one who had caused his son to abandon his faith. As
always, poor Monsieur Kazes was the recipient of his complaints.
This continued until Kazes succeeded in convincing him and some of
the Jewish rabbis to agree to a debate during which they could put
forth persuasive arguments to win back his son. However, it seemed
impossible to calm down my father who was torn with anger.

Once in a while, my father would allude to the Baha'i Faith,
while talking to my mother in front of me. He would curse and
insult the Faith profusely, hoping to provoke some reaction in me
or at least make certain it was true, that his son really had
become a Baha'i. But most of the time I would keep silent without
reacting and would keep him wondering.

My First Baha'i Feast in my Father's Home

In those days, Baha'is were secretive and none would dare declare
his faith openly, which was only reasonable and out of necessity.
If a father was a believer, he would conceal it from his sons, and
if a son was a believer, he would not dare admit it to any of his
family, or for that matter, to other people. Baha'is would pray
behind closed doors. The only family in which every member had
become Baha'i, was the family of Jinab-i-Mirza Ibrahim fil:layyat (the
tailor).

As mentioned already, he was known as Mirza Ibrahim Simsar. (At
first he was an enemy of the Faith, but soon embraced the Faith and
taught his entire family). Most local Baha'i gatherings would be
held in his house. However, he could not afford to undertake all of

the expenses connected with those events. One day, I suggested that
we could try instead to have each Baha'i take turns in hosting the
meetings. At the same time, the veil should be slowly lifted and
our beliefs become known so that greater steps could be taken to
serve the interests of the Faith. In the meantime, we could lighten
the burden and hardships of Mirza Ibrahim Simsar. All present
acknowledged this. But how to begin?      Everyone was wondering and
looking at each other rather perplexed, over where and who should
be first.

Who had the heart and courage to hold a Baha'i meeting in his own
home? Perhaps everyone there was eager with all heart and soul, to
arise and do this, but at the same time inwardly disturbed over
their lack of power. When I offered my family's house, everyone
turned towards me in utter astonishment. Their surprise stemmed
from knowing my father all to well, and from being aware of his
temper and his behaviour. So they responded all at once, saying:
"Is it wise, to gather together in the home of the most prejudiced
of the Jewish rabbis and hold there a Baha'i feast? How would this
be possible? No other would present such difficulties and
obstacles." I responded to all of these objections by pointing out
that, on the night of the Sabbath, my father and family go to the
synagogue and stay there quite late. I said, "You wait nearby, so
that I can call to you as they leave. And also, you would leave
shortly before my family returns." Everyone was happy with this
arrangement and approved of it, but no one could have predicted
what would happen, but God alone.

The first night I convened the feast in my home I called to the
friends waiting nearby, right after my parents and family had left.
So, everyone gathered together and a lively feast began. Each would
say prayers in turn. We had tea ready and would have some tea
during breaks, in between chanting and reciting the Holy Writings,
even though starting a fire and preparing tea on the Sabbath was a
great sin for the Jews.

My mother had a sister, who would come for a visit on Saturdays
and they would go to the synagogue together. By accident that
night, she came later than usual and my mother had already left for
the synagogue. Because of my anxiety over the immediate situation,
I had entirely forgotten about her. To make the story short, she
arrived, opened the curtain and discovered what we had been trying
to keep secret. Especially noticeable was the samovar, simmering
and steaming, placed in the centre of our circle, on a Sabbath
night! She shook her head and dropped the curtain, and left without
saying a word.

There was no doubt that there was a crisis building up within
her. How could she have imagined that her nephew would ever touch
fire on the Sabbath? Would it have been possible for her to just
push what she had seen out of her mind?     Not so. For whatever she
saw became magnified a thousand times in her eyes, and so she went
straightaway to my parents and reported the episode, probably not
without a great deal of exaggeration. She went as far as putting my
father down. She said to him, "Congratulations! Not only has your
beloved son gone astray from religion, but he has also gathered

together other unbelievers under your very roof, and moreover, he
has touched fire, and thus made your place impure." From the way
my aunt had let down the curtain, and from the nature of her
silence, I realized right away that there was bound to be a crisis.
I asked the friends to cut the meeting short and to leave, and we
removed the tea.

The first to arrive home was my mother who was hostile and
abusive. Since there was no one else present (to catch me red-
handed), she said: "Your aunt was just saying that you have become
a Baha'i, and are socializing with infidels, have turned against
the religion of Israel and have handled fire. Of course, I just
cannot believe you would become the cause of our misfortune and
ill-repute, making us shameful and notorious before our own
people!"     My mother was telling me her feelings with the utmost
sadness. What could I say to a mother who was more dear to me, than
my own life? I replied: "Dearest mother, you yourself, have read
the Torah. In it, it is said that only illegitimate children would
forsake their belief. There is no one else here, but you and I.
Either you have concealed such a thing or the Torah is wrong?" Poor
mother swore repeatedly and then became silent. I realized how hurt
she was, so I said: "Dear mother, I know you have never done me
wrong, nor is the Torah false, I have not forsaken my faith either.
Rest assured, for it has been said that the Messiah has appeared
and the time for the emancipation and progress of Israel has at
last come." My mother's face began to open up with a smile.

We were in the middle of this conversation, when my father burst
in, roaring like a volcano. Normally, my father had a very strong
and loud voice, and so you can imagine how it was when he began
screaming out of anger. When he started to insult me, I lost my
patience and told him straight, that indeed, I had embraced the
Cause of God. I then brought up verses of the Torah, as witness to
the truth of the Cause and I challenged him to respond. Since he
had no real answer, his anger intensified a hundred times over.

I said, "Father, you refuse to listen to me, so how can I take
seriously what you have to say? There should be a third party to
judge between us." My father had the Torah in his hand and was
waving it constantly. I then said, "I firmly believe in the very
Torah you believe in." Then we placed it between us, and both of us
took an oath. If my father was right, I would agree to follow him
and attend synagogue, each and every Sabbath, and faithfully
observe all of the rituals and traditions of the Jewish faith, and
to do the utmost in my power to please him. But, if I was judged to
be in the right, then he should follow me.

Since we were both exhausted, and there was no other recourse, he
consented to this. The storm calmed somewhat, and my mother, who
had all the while been watching us, seemed relieved and satisfied
enough so that we could have supper and then turn in for the night.
But could any of us really sleep!

I, myself was in a world of imagination. After all, I was
attempting to convince my father that I had done nothing wrong, and
was trying my best to do this, through love and kindness, and by
the use of proofs and appeal to reason. But what my father's real

feelings were, I do not know.

The next morning, I related the events of the previous night's
episode to Mirza Ibrahim Simsar. Others among the friends, became
informed of what had taken place. Everyone was most supportive and
said this plan of action should be pursued until some result be
achieved. The least outcome would be that all of this would come
out of the closet. Perhaps that would bring some relief to the
whole predicament and we would be able to teach openly.

The Debate

After that night, my father could not calm down and started
working on his own plans. Monsieur Kazes, the school principal, had
advised him and other Jewish scholars, that they should try to win
over the Baha'is by convincing proofs and reason, not by hostility
or use of force. These scholars had a great deal of pride in
themselves and considered us lowly and weak. Thus they decided on
a debate and chose accordingly the following individuals to rise to
the occasion:

1) Rabbi Ha'im Murih: He was blind, yet he knew the entire Torah
by heart, and had an astonishing knowledge of other books, sacred
to the Jews. He was a brilliant and powerful speaker, and had
recently composed a refutation against Jesus and the Gospel, which
was without peer or rival at that time. (He is the father of Mr.
Ibrahim Murih)

> 2) Rabbi Ibrahim Ribino,
> 3) Rabbi Ya'qub Baha'i and his brother,
> 4) Eli Safan,
5) Rabbi Elezar Ha'im, who later emigrated to Palestine where he

> would subsequently cause trouble for me, which I will relate
> later on,
6) Rabbi Daniel, my father,

> Drawn from the Baha'i community, these individuals were present:
> 1) Adib Elahi,
> 2) Mirza Khalil Aqiba,
> 3) Mihdi Arjomand,
> 4) Aqa Mu~ammad Allaghiband Yazdi,
> 5) Aqa Sayeed Hasan Hashemizadeh (Motevajeh),
> 6) ~aji Mulla 'Ali Akbar Shahmirzadi, (Hand of the Cause)
> 7) Ibn-i-Asdaq, (Hand of the Cause)
> 8) Rahim Mulla Bakhaj,
> 9) Jinab-i-Ibn-i-Abhar (Hand of the Cause)

Of course, there were other people present, both Jews and
Baha'is, who were audience to the debate. These people were: ~ajf
Yezghil Kashi, Mirza Aqa Jan Gilavani, Haji Baba and his son, Dr.

Amir Khan Amirian, ~aji Haq Nazar, Mirza Ibrahim Khayyat, Mirza Aqa
Jan Kashi-Baha'u'l-Hukama, Aziz Eliahu, known as Abrishami, Haqq
Nazar Na'ima, Eliahu ~aji Shaul, and a host of others, whose names

I cannot recall. The debate took place in two adjoining rooms which
were packed with Baha'is and non-Baha'is.

After opening remarks and the usual courtesies, Ibn-i-Asdaq
opened the debate. The Jewish leaders answered all at once and
there were no rules of order in force. Mirza Mihdi Arjomand, known
as Rifua, sought permission from Ibn-i-Asdaq to act as speaker and
Ibn-i-Asdaq would come to his assistance, if needed. He was saying,
"I know their language better."

After some further discussion, his idea was accepted and Mirza
Mihdi, took over the debate. He began by saying to the Jews
present: "You should choose among yourselves the one you find most
knowledgeable. Because, the way things are now, everyone is trying
to talk at the same time and this creates chaos, and not a single
point can possibly be made." Of course, none of the Jewish
personalities there was pleased to be considered less than any
other. But as a result of Arjomand's persistence, after a bit of
arguing, they at last settled on one to speak on their behalf.

The second recommendation Mirza Mihdi Arjomand made, was that
everything mentioned should be written down and that the record be
signed by both sides to prevent any denial of the facts and course
of the debate at a later date. He elaborated on this idea by
saying, "We each and all are gathered here together for the sake of
God. God forbid if we are overtaken by pride and we should deny the
truth as a result. So it makes better sense to record each point
and have this attested to by both sides. Perhaps, as a result, we
might know at the meeting's end who is right." Though at first
there was disagreement over this proposal, after some reluctance
this condition was also accepted. It remained to be decided who
would be the one to write everything down -- one who would be
acceptable to both sides. Fortuitously, that problem was soon
resolved with the choice of a certain Haji Rahim Mulla Bakhaj
(grandfather of the engineer Farhadi, son~in-law of Dr. Lotfullah
Hakim). ~aji Rahim was an honest man and trusted by the Jews of the
area, and was secretly a believer of the Baha'i Faith. Thus, he was
chosen unanimously as the secretary.

Despite the fact that the Jewish party had agreed to a speaker to
debate on their behalf, they would continue to respond chaotically
all at once to statements made. Each would venture his own way of
interpretation and explanation. So it was then suggested to them
that before responding to any particular point, the Jews first
discuss among themselves and then present a unified response.
After agreement was reached, their designated spokesman should
convey the response. Having won approval of this, Mirza Mihdi
Arjomand resumed the debate and posed this question:           "Are
messengers of God sent for specific nations only, or for all the
peoples of the world?" He then gave the example of Moses, and the
very same question again: "Was Moses sent for the people of Israel
only, or for all the people of that time?"

To deal with this question, a harsh dispute broke out among the
Jewish scholars because certain of them held that Moses was for one
chosen nation only, while others believed His mission extended to
all the peoples of the world. Mirza Mihdi could not accept these

mutually-opposing viewpoints on this matter and asked for a clear,
straightforward answer. After further discussion among the Jews, it
was resolved that the Jewish religion was for the nation of Israel,
chosen as it was of God.

Then Mirza Mihdi replied, "If so, please tell us why Moses took
some of the Egyptians with him who had declared their faith in him?
If granted you are right, that this religion is for Israel only,
Moses should have rejected these Egyptian believers, all the more
so, as they were at one time the very enemies of the people of
Israel."

The Jewish Rabbis were facing a very problematic point so they
chose the other answer, namely that the Jewish religion was for the
whole world as well. As all of them at last agreed on this, it was
noted down and signed.

Thereafter any question agreed-upon, posed or response given, was
written down and signed by both sides. At length, the debate
focused on this verse of the Torah; where Moses states, "I will
choose a Prophet from among thy brethern, like unto myself,"
(Deuteronomy 18:15), which follows with, "Hearken to him," meaning:
follow him. The Jewish learned present were asked whether or not
they were in agreement as to the authenticity of this verse, and
all gave their recognition of it.

Then Arjomand said, "Set forth, if you will, those attributes of
Moses which you deem as proofs of His prophethood. Then I propose
to show you how Jesus, ~u~ammad, the Bab, and Baha'u'llah
themselves, exemplified these attributes as well."

The Jews were making guesses which were quite senseless, and
Arjomand would proceed to invalidate their responses with reason
and proof. When at last Arjomand found the Jewish debaters unable
to offer a proper response to this question, he himself proceeded
to explain the attributes of the Messengers of God so objectively,
that everyone present gave consent and signed to that effect. So
the truth of His Holiness Jesus, son of Mary, t:iutiammad, the
Messenger of God, the Bab, the Primal Point, and Baha'u'llah, the
Blessed Beauty, was demonstrated conclusively.

Following so sharp and profound an explanation on this matter,
the Jewish scholars were reduced to silence, and with one accord
conceded to the validity of his argument. They then said, "Now
leave us alone. Let the Jews be Jewish and the Christians
Christian, the Muslims to follow their own religion, and we allow
as well that you Baha' is should be free to fol low your own
religion. We do not interfere in the affairs of others, and you
also should not meddle in our affairs." So the Jews present adopted
this strategy, as a last resort. They insisted: "We really cannot
forsake our ancestral faith, even in these times. After all, we
were born in the Jewish faith and we shall die in the Jewish faith,
we do not wish to bother you, nor you to bother us."

At this point, Arjomand asked them to sign the record to this
effect. But, they stalled and ended up refusing to, even though
throughout the lengthy debate Arjomand at several points had taken

their signatures voluntarily.*

This debate had lasted several hours, and both sides had
become so involved in the issues at hand, that the time had passed
unnoticed. The end of the debate coincided with sunrise the next
day, the debate having started early in the evening the night
before. I invited everyone to dinner. At the table, now and then,
I would look up at my father's face. Though outwardly he appeared
calm and quiet, it was obvious to me that the fire of anger in him
was still smouldering. But since he had consented to all of this
beforehand, he was obliged to conceal his inner feelings and hide
his anger.

At the dinner table, he was sitting across from ~aji Mulla Akbar
Shahmirzadi, the Hand of the Cause. My father had his head down and
was idly toying with a knife, cleaning a red radish. To comfort my
father, the Hand of the Cause told him: "Do you see now, that your
son has not gone on the wrong path? You should be proud and happy
over such a mature, active, religious and God-abiding son." And
after saying a few more things, at last he said, "From now on, God-
willing, you will not bother him any longer?"

Suddenly my father's patience reached its limit, he began to
roar, and with intense anger and bitterness, while turning his
knife in his hand, said, "If you leave him in my hands, I'll cut
his head off like •.• " But Adib intruded into the argument and
jokingly said, "Jinab-i-Mulla, neither would you ever do such a
thing, nor would we deliver him to your hands to be martyred."

I believe that ijaji ~u~ammad must have related the events of that
night to 'Abdu'l-Baha, because during my pilgrimage I heard about
some of the events of that night from the most pure mouth of His
Holiness 'Abdu'l-Baha. At any rate, as a result of that night, our
debate was discussed in every neighbourhood and marketplace. The
situation changed and we had no more fear. Social gatherings became
more frequent, and I gained the freedom to hold Feasts in my home.
But the dissatisfaction of my father persisted still.

Debate with Jamal Burujirdi

Prior to accepting the Faith, in search of truth and information
on the nature of various beliefs, I would go to different places.
I even went to Sufi gatherings and to the well-known house of Sufi
'Ali Shah. But since I found their words and deeds as virtually of
no real worth compared to those of the Baha'is, I rid my hands of
them all and accepted the Baha'i Faith. After becoming a Baha'i, I
was very active, and even confronted enemies of the Faith.

Ever since I heard of Aqa' Jamal Burujirdi (Jamal Burujirdi was
a well-known Baha'i at the time of Baha'u'llah, but because he was

*  (The present author of this narrative, some time later searched in earnest for
the original document and learned of its existence in the hands of the Golsham
brothers. But since they are still Jewish and quite religious at that, they ended
up denying the whole episode and refused to produce the notes.)

against 'Abdu'l-Baha, he became a covenant breaker.) I had become
interested in meeting him, but did not have the means to do so. I
finally had the chance to visit Jamal when a friend of mine, Dr.
Fakhim, took me to his house during a holiday celebration.

Jamal deemed his own station too exalted to socialize with a poor
person like me, so he ordered his son to receive me in the
adjoining room. His son, Hob'u'llah, started to bring up certain
points. For instance, he had been reading some of the poems of
Varqa, in one of which it is written: "I'll know you, whether in
beggar's clothes or in king's clothes." He concluded that 'Abdu'l-
Baha had believed himself to be a Manifestation of God, even though
the real Manifestation of the Faith had been just one person.

Right away I knew that he harboured enmity towards 'Abdu'l-Baha.

I replied that, if a poet such as Varqa has out of love for his
Master, composed such a poem and has lavished on Him such praise,
this is not a standard by which one can judge 'Abdu'l-Baha. We
should instead see what 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself has said. He advances
no such claim, nor had He commissioned Varqa to write such things
in verse. Even in numerous tablets, He very distinctly says, "My
name is 'Abdu'l-Baha (Servant of Baha), My qualification is
'Abdu'l-Baha, My reality is 'Abdu'l-Baha." Furthermore, He had
stated that the source of His honour is servitude to the threshold
of Baha.

So clearly does 'Abdu'l-Baha explain His station, that I wonder
how so simple a matter could be so misconstrued by some. There has
even been a case where one poet mentioned 'abdu'l-Baha's name, as
"Abbas" in a poem, with which 'Abdu' 1-Baha was not pleased but
rather disturbed.

At any rate, our argument went on far too long, and no matter
what approach he used, the door was slammed in his face. At last,
he neither succeeded, nor could I determine what his real and
ultimate purpose was in choosing such a way to attack the Faith, or
what his objective was and to what authority he looked up to. So I
asked FaJglim to invite Jamal over to his place for lunch and to
arrange at the same time for Mulla 'Ali Akbar, Hand of the Cause,
to show up unexpectedly. At the same time I asked him to let me
hide in the next room, so that by observing the encounter from both
sides, I could come to my own conclusions.

He did exactly as I had suggested. Both sides engaged in lengthy
discussions, and I had the opportunity to be exposed to Jamal's
unfounded criticisms as well as his enormous pride. No matter how
Hand of the Cause Mulla 'Ali Akbar tried to deal with Jamal's
abuses against 'Abdu'l-Baha, his efforts to convince him of
anything proved fruitless. It got to the point where Jamal
proclaimed himself to be no less than 'Abdu'l-Baha, and equal to
Him in station.

At this point I had run out of patience and came out from behind
the curtain and exclaimed, "Your criticisms are similar to those of
<IDarun with regards to Moses. According to the Torah itself, Moses
was forbearing and patient for a long time, and finally besought
God to resolve Jili.arun' s problem. As you are well aware, he
disappeared from the face of the earth after enduring many

misfortunes. You should likewise be careful not to act as Gharun
did."

As Jamal heard me say this, he lost control and got extremely
upset with Dr. Fakhim, and told him, "You promised me that you
would not accept anyone else into your house. What nonsense is
this? A Jewish youth who was my subordinate yesterday, is given
permission to address me like this?" He then stormed out of the
meeting.

Yet, what I warned him about that day actually happened. Not only
did his fate end up like Gbarun's, but a hundred times worse. And
everyone who knew him is witness to that. I heard from his son that
Jamal was reduced to begging for his very survival during his last
days.*

These kinds of encounters not only failed to make me go astray,
but would kindle the lamp of faith in my heart ever brighter, just
as the light of an electric lamp is more luminous than that of a
mere candle.

Marriage and a Gift from the Reigning Monarch

My father was forever trying to get me married. It was customary
among the Jews to arrange for their son to be married, when they
reached their eighteenth year of age. As a youth I passed this year
still unmarried, and as a result, my parents felt themselves
responsible and guilty. Then I passed age twenty, still single. No
one would consent to give his own daughter in marriage to me, since
I had become a Baha'i. Then as a result of my parent's efforts, I
became engaged to a girl I had never met before. For an entire
year, I would visit my fiance on Saturday nights as the guest of
her family and sometimes would even sleep there overnight. But not
once was I given the chance to even see my fiance's face.

At last I thought of something. I came up with a plan to make a
coat for her, and while fitting it on her, try to see her face. So
I did exactly this and came to the conclusion that this poor
creature had every reason to cover her face. Not only was she far
from pretty and looked quite undesirable, but she also looked older
than me. So I backed out of this arranged marriage, and no matter
how much my parents would insist, I would not accept.

Time passed, and after a while I myself found a girl who was
young and rather beautiful, and so I went to my parents and through
them asked for her hand. But her parents would not accept because
of their prejudice against the Baha'is. This was aggravated by the
fact that I had become well-known as a "Babi".(The early Baha'is
were often known as "Babis".)

The girl's grandmother, who was quite influential, was dead set
against the marriage and no one would dare challenge her.

*(His son is Mr. Muhibat, who was faithful in the Covenant and ever engaged in
service to the Cause. During the ministry of the Guardian, he was involved in
copying the Holy Tablets.)

This continued until the assassination of Nasiri'd-Din Shah. In
those times, it was the usual practice for ruffians to take
advantage of any situation to loot the homes of innocent people,
and to perform acts of cruelty, with minorities as a prime target.

The Jewish ghetto was particularly vulnerable, and these gang
members would ransack homes in the Jewish quarter repeatedly, and
at the same time commit unspeakable crimes. After the death of the
Shah, chances of fresh attacks were more than ever. The family of
the girl I wished to marry, was very prejudiced against me - the
grandmother was especially stubborn - and yet, they vowed that if
they be spared the calamities which might befall them as a result
of the assassination, and be saved from the attacks of ruffians,
they would consent to give over the hand of her granddaughter to
me, a Baha'i.

Fortunately, the Jews were kept safe, because the Blessed Beauty
had rescued them from abasement. Although the grandmother had come
to regret her vow later, our marriage did take place. Though I
tried my best to find a way to her heart, the grandmother continued
to be upset that her granddaughter had married a Baha'i.

As I have previously mentioned, prior to the wedding I had
invested forty tumans (thanks to the loan from my uncle) in an
ironing table, an iron, a pair of fabric shears and a few other
tailoring tools of the trade, and had opened my own shop. By the
grace of God and His bounty, after several years, I paid not only
my household expenses, but managed to pay off my debts as well. So
I was running a debt free shop.

Since I was always trying my best to attract more customers and
to be accomodating, I was quite outgoing and showed respect for my
patrons as well as I could. In this way I had struck up friendships
and made acquaintances with people from all walks of life. It
happened that in the court of Muzaffari'd-Din Shah, it was decided
that a special formal piece of wardrobe be tailored for one of the
courtiers. The Shah himself was rather particular when it came to
proper apparel, so he entrusted a group of civil servants to see to
it that the outfit would be professionally tailored. It was through
the influence of a friend of mine, that I got the commission to
tailor this.

When the outfit was finished, I delivered it to the summer palace
in Shimran and presented it before His Majesty. All court members
present praised the garment in every way. The Shah was al so
impressed and added his admiration. As he did so, one official
spoke up and said, "Your Majesty, this commission - so brilliantly
executed - justly deserves a royal gift. The royal court gave its
assent, and the Shah gave order that a Khal'at (a royal gift of
honour) be presented. It was a Tirmih,   a   luxuriantly hand-woven
fabric with silver and gold thread woven into it. The Tirmih was
placed around my neck, in the presence of the Shah. I kissed the
ground out of respect and was then dismissed.
In those days, whoever became the recipient of a Khal 'at, would

be escorted back to his work place in a royal carriage, and would
be accompanied by a special guard. In this manner I was sent back
to my town. All along the way, my only thought was of the great
assurances of the Blessed Beauty and 'Abdu' 1-Baha as recorded
throughout their Tablets, and these were before my eyes and echoed
in my ears. Of these assurances, one was this:

"Ere long, hopeless Israel shall be possessed
of honour, and its hope shall be restored."

I offered up thanks to God and prayed for divine

Revelation of the First Tablet

I had received the blessings of 'Abdu' 1-Baha, so my

to give my entire fortune in three parts: one in my wife's

name, one in my daughter's name, and the remainder in my own
name. Altogether, a considerable sum of money was raised for
the House of Worship. (My daughter's name was Qudsiyyih
Khanum. >

Following this event, I started a new business, and praise
be to God, I was successful. I know not who it was who
reported this episode before the presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha, but
after some time, I received from the pen of 'Abdu'l-Baha a
Tablet which reads as follows:

Tablet of Abdu'l-Baha

To Jinab-i-Azfzf, of the lineage       of   Khalil
(Abraham), on him be the Glory of God.

He   l.S   God!

0 descendant of Abraham!

In truth, thou art of that illustrious lineage,
a descendant of that resplendent Sun.

From the mantle of your deeds is diffused a musk-
> laden fragrance,    like unto the sweet-smell of the
> ministry of !Qialfl (Abraham).

Tokens of your Abrahamic heritage are evident
> from your firmness and steadfastness. Thus should the
> descendant live up to that nobility, so that the secret
> of Abraham may be revealed.

The gathering you had arranged was glorious,
> majestic and beauteous and in reality a reflection of the
> realm above, for it was a gathering consecrated to the
> establishment of a Mashriqu'l-Adhkar. Divine favour and
> assistance was manifest in that gathering, inspiring each
> one present to succeed in giving generously, according to
> their capacity.

The blessings of that event shall return to you
> with a bountiful portion thereof, causing you to become
> the recipient of God's forgiveness.

Convey to your honoured wife greetings of the
> Most Glorious, and may you ever show kindness to your
> sons and daughters on behalf of 'Abdu'l-Baha.

On behalf of Abdu '1-Baha , salutations and praise
be upon you.

> - 'Abdu'l-Baha

In those days, I had only one baby girl, but my wife was
expecting. In accordance with the Tablet, I announced the good
news that she was going to have a boy. I also gained
confidence from the assurance that I would experience
increased success, and this also came true.

I was a servant of the Cause, and my desire to serve had
no bounds, yet the desire to attain the presence of the
Beloved of the World would not let me alone. It was through
Dr. Yunis Khan and Dr. Aristoo Khan, who themselves were
called to the Holy Land, that I applied for pilgrimage. Some
time passed and as I had not heard from them, I wrote to Dr.
Aristoo Khan again and begged him in greater earnest to
intercede on my behalf and seek permission for my visit.

Love to Serve the Cause

As I had become a Baha'i, I savoured the sweetness of the
Cause, but it was also necessary to endure the shafts of its
enemies. In those days, one needed great strength to deal with
the hardships and pains inflicted.

I had prepared myself from every angle. For me, hardships
would come in different forms from a number of directions, for
instance: those who were against the Baha'is generally would
persecute me, but on top of this, those who felt unfavourable
towards the Jews had it out for me too. According to the
persecutors, I was a Babi, impure, and without true religion.
In short, the heavy rains of calamities would pour down. But,
so also would confirmations from God come from every
direction. Praise be to God, I had the endurance and patience
for it all. I was working hard, and in spite of the opposition
of enemies, I was sucessful and advanced. My evenings were
devoted to various kinds of Baha'i service, but I was
particularly active in teaching.

There was a certain physician, a very strong and steadfast
believer, who was sent on a mission by 'Abdu'l-Baha to teach
the Faith within the Jewish community. On evenings, especially
Saturdays, he would invite the Jews to his home for the
purpose of teaching them. I would also attend and bring my own
contacts with me. Usually, I would take with me my brother,
Aqa Murtida, who eventually accepted the Faith. Since there
was no longer any pretence, and my secret was laid bare (the
fact that I was a Baha'i) I would 1 ikewise hold Baha'i
gatherings and firesides for teaching.

Though all along my father was displeased with all of
this, he would complain only secretly, and would not dare
voice his opposition openly. This was largely due to the
outcome of the debate that had taken place, at which he had
sworn never to create any disturbance. Rabbi Ibrahim Ribino,
who would show utmost good-will towards me, was himself
present at that historic debate, and would in earnest dissuade
the Jews from argument and opposition.

At any rate, we were relatively free, and the field also
was quite vast. We were given opportunities and means for
service and, praise be to God, we were successful. Every day
we had new believers and during al 1 this time, I had the
honour of participating in most of the activities and
gatherings.

Baha'i Dervishes

Six Baha'i dervishes had come to Tehran. Their names were:
Haji Muqbilan, Haji Qalandar, Haji Tavangar, Haji Yunis, Haji
Muqidih, and Haji Muidih. They ~ere in trouble financiallyrand

at times would pass through the market place in Tehran,
chanting the poetry and verses of the Blessed Beauty in loud
melodious voices. Some people who discovered that they were
Baha'is, would harass them. The fact they were dervishes at
the same time, did not make any difference. These dervishes
were new believers and had not yet been able to find jobs.
Worse sti 11, these dervishes possessed no craft, art or
vocation, nor any other source of income. I was aware of their
situation and the persecution they suffered at the hands of
the Shi'ahs, which would pain me.

I recall one winter night when it was snowing very hard.

I came home and saw that my mother was about to throw away a
big pot of meat stew. It was rich with fat and very tasty. It
was Sabbath eve, on which usually Jews would prepare food to
last two days, in order to avoid handling fire on the Sabbath.
So it's not hard to imagine just how much food she had made.
Poor mother was complaining, not having enough strength to
pick up the pot and get rid of the food. I asked her why she
was doing this. She said, "Haven't you heard? The village
crier informed everyone that among the lambs recently sold at
market, one had a broken bone. All the meat sold was suspect,
and according to both the Rabbi and Synagogue, eating of any
of that tainted meat is forbidden."     (It was a custom among
the Jews, that if a butchered animal had had a broken bone -
even if healed, consumption of the meat of that animal was
banned.)

In whatever way I tried to make her change her mind, so as
not to waste that food, nothing worked; so I thought of a
solution. I said, "Mother, a Jew cannot eat this food, but
what about a non-Jew?" She answered that nothing forbade that.
I said, "In that case, give me the pot." I then wrapped the
pot in a cloth and on that cold and snowy night, I went to our
poor friends - that is, those six dervishes who were staying
the night in a caravansarai, just outside town. I found them
in a very poor shelter, without protective clothing, huddled
together and chanting prayers. They were thrilled to see me,
especially when they noticed I was carrying something. So I
told them the story about the stew and they were all delighted
over this. Each of them were famished, having found nothing to
eat all day. Smiling, their leader Dervish Mughbilan said, "It

is not possible that the Blessed Beauty should deny His
faithful ones their share of His bounty." So he asked one of
the dervishes to chant some more in order to get some money
for bread as well.

On the way back, I thought a lot about the disability of
human beings, despite all the potential power with which each
man is endowed. I was also thinking about the abject poverty
of some people, and also about persecution. The piercing cold
of that night, and the want of proper clothing for these men,
particularly distressed me. So I decided to make each of them
a very thick vest. Thus, without any advance sizing, and only
my own visual estimates of the body size of each, I made each
of them vests and took them to these men.

Unfortunately, the dervishes were evicted from the
caravansarai by force, and so they had left town. I became
very disheartened, and sat down on a rock. Then I asked about
them from the owner of the caravansarai. I found out they were
kicked out because they had no money and had not paid for
their overnight stay. I asked, "Do you know what direction
they took?" He said, "I think they headed in the direction of
Hadrat 'Abdu'l-'Azim (a religious town known as Rayy.)
· · I followed them straightaway and I was overjoyed when I
caught up with them. The dervishes greeted me and offered up
a prayer of thanks for me, and were very gracious to me. I
presented them the vests and my happiness reached its peak
when I saw that the vests fitted perfectly, even though I had
made them by visually estimating their size. The vests were
neither loose nor tight, nor short nor long, but were a proper
fit. Anyway, the dervishes became so delighted, thankful of
the bounties of the Blessed Beauty, and thanked me over and
over. We hugged each other like brothers and kissed each other
(as men do in the Middle East). After prayer and wishing each
other wel 1, we went our separate ways, to pursue our own
destinies. They departed once more for Hadrat 'Abdu'l-'Azim,
and I for Tehran.                        ' ·

First Journey to 'Akka to Visit 'Abdu'l-Baha

The wish to see 'Abdu'l-Baha gave me no rest. I was in
touch by letter with Dr. Arastoo Khan, and after calling
earnestly on him to seek permission on my behalf to come, at
last in one of his letters the good news reached me, that
permission was granted.

My permission came at a time when the outbreak of cholera
would kill people like leaves in fall. As this plague was
epidemic, travelling was very difficult, and for this reason
'Abdu'l-Baha would not as a rule, grant permission to Persians
to visit him. But my permission, nevertheless, had come. I was
anxious and worried. So I took the matter before the Spiritual
Assembly (which at that time was called the Board of
Consultation), of which I myself was a member. Fortunately,

all present advised me to go. Baha'i friends would, moreover,
insist and say to me, "If you don't go and then die of
cholera, you will have lost a great blessing."

Furthermore, I had faith that permission from the all-
knowning Master was in itself, a sign that I would survive the
cholera epidemic. At any rate, I resolved to undertake the
journey. Enduring countless hardships, I travelled by way of
Qaf Qaz, Istanbul in Turkey, and from there to Haifa and

'Akka. On this journey, I was accompanied by Ibn-i-Asdaq,
along with his servant, and also a Baha'i friend from Yazd. At
the outset of the journey there was some conflict among us
which I tolerated until we met up with Siyyid Hasan Hashimi-
zadeh and Ustad Mahmud Khabiri, who were also destined for

'Akka. At this jun~ture, we were six men looking forward to
meeting our Beloved.

As we entered Anzali (now called Pahlavi), we were put in
quarantine. This building was made of wood, so one day it
caught on fire. But Ustad Ma~mud, with peerless bravery and
skill, saved us from the inferno. This accident forged closer
bonds between us and as a result we became more united,
sharing in one another's joy and sadness. As we reached
Badkubih, again we were thrown in quarantine. Upon release
from this temporary jail, we anxiously sought out the Baha'i
friends there, and soon became their guests.

How wonderful it was. They showered upon us much kindness
and brought us comfort. In every town where Baha'is resided,
they would treat us with the utmost hospitality. In reality,
we were as members of one family, and as children of one
Father. In Tiblis, Ahmad took us in and through his kindness
he took all the hardship of the journey away from us, while we
were there. In fact, in every town and village, the moment
they were informed of our coming, the Baha'i friends would
greet us with open arms and make us forget all the hardships
of our journey. This would intensify in us the flame of love
and goodwill.

In this manner, we journeyed from town to town. When we
were about to board our ship, the captain refused to accept
us. He ignored our passionate pleas and knew not that God had
kept us safe til 1 then. Each of us was overwhelmed with
excitement at the thought of attaining the presence of the
Beloved of the World. The captain kept his distance from us to
protect himself, and left us to suffer in our separation (from
'Abdu' 1-Baha).

Then, an Italian ship had pity on us and greed for money
prompted the captain to accept to take us to Beirut. But he
failed to keep his promise and left us stranded in Istanbul.
Again we faced quarantine, but not as easily and calmly as in
other towns. In this place, they endeavoured to disinfect us
with steam from boiling water. I can never forget how all our
leather-crafted belongings were spoiled,        and my shoes
afterward no longer fitted my feet. Was there yet any further
need for shoes?       To the precincts of the Beloved we

should go barefoot and without shoes. As we reached Beirut,
Aqa Shaykh Muhammad-'Alf Qa'ini and a group of Zoroastrian
Baha'fs from India joined us. All of us entered Haifa aboard
the same ship.

In Haifa, there was a coffee shop called "Sahlan wa
Siyyid." In that coffee shop, someone appointed by 'Abdu'l-
Baha to serve the pilgrims, was waiting for us. He hired a
carriage at once to take us to 'Akka. God only knew how
thrilled and delighted we were. We were just a few miles away
from our Beloved, and all along the way we were praying, aloud
at times and other times silently, to the one and only God. In
this excited state, we reached the gates of 'Akka. At that
point, there was a company of Turkish guards. They would
require newcomers to register and obtain visas.

Our group was a most interesting one, with different
looks, different outfits, each from a different town or
country or race, with different customs and cultures. But we
were all of one accord and showed the utmost kindness towards
each other. We all were headed towards the same goal and were
beside ourselves in our longing to see the Beloved, all to the
point of weeping. One would have to have seeing eyes, a
perceptive vision, to perceive what could possibly have
brought all these opposites together and for all these colours
to become one colour. Is there any greater happiness for
humanity than looking away from estrangement and fixing their
gaze on the oneness of mankind?

The gate of 'Akka had two large doors. There was a large
courtyard (barracks square) behind the two doors. Around it
were barracks to serve as quarters for the soldiers and
guards. The city of 'Akka was very small and its alleys
extremely narrow, dark and dirty. A group of Qaz-Qafi Baha'i
residents of 'Akka came in white outfits to receive us. They
directed us to the guest house. The guest house in 'Akka was
a caravansarai with a few small rooms. A few such guests would
stay in just one room.

The very night we entered 'Akka, al 1 travellers were
called into the presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha. I was very anxious
and uncomfortable, and a bit wary. According to the Torah, the
station of the Centre of the Covenant of the Lord of Hosts was
so exalted that I found myself too unworthy to attain His
presence. I cannot describe what went through my mind in those
moments. Even though I wanted so much to behold that peerless
Beauty, I did not dare raise my head and thus did not know
quite what to do.

It was at night when it was our honour to enter the
presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha. We kissed the ground out of respect.
His holiness 'Abdu'l-Baha was holding a lamp in His blessed
hand and was paying special heed to each one's face. Right
away I realized that 'Abdu'l-Baha was showing his own face,
fulfilling what I had always longed for before. Who were we,
that 'Abdu'l-Baha should take such trouble to meet?    Then He
said, " You are very spiritual. "   He said many

things, but due to my inner anxiety at the time, they did not
remain in my mind. But what I do remember is that He said,
"The chief of the guards informed us that a group of our
friends have entered 'Akka, whereupon we replied,          'Yes,
indeed-some from Iran, some from India and some from other
places have come to visit us." He then gave leave for al 1 of
us to retire. Memories of that night are indescribable. What
could be spoken of is beyond my ability to adequately recount.
It needs a tongue more eloquent and a mind more able than
mine. (At this point, Jinab-i-Azizi became quite emotional and
could barely speak. The corners of his eyes were moist with
tears which he would calmly wipe away with his finger.)

After two or three days, 'Abdu'l-Baha would summon the
pilgrims,    sometimes    altogether   and   at   other   times
individually, and would address them each according to his
capacity and understanding. Whenever someone was called in
privately, others would circle around him as he was dismissed,
and would ask him to recount every detail of what took place
in the presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha. That person would describe
what transpired and this would exhilarate everyone present.

One day it was my turn, and 'Abdu'l-Baha summoned me. The
moment I entered His presence, I was so nervous, I had
difficulty even keeping my balance. Immediately 'Abdu'l-Baha
said, "Bismellah (In the name of God), enter." I obeyed and
took my place on a chair, but experienced such trembling as
could not be described. The trembling became such that even
the chair was vibrating and making noise. Abdu'l-Baha was very
kind, even though I had lost my composure. He ordered tea to
be brought and served me with His own hands and bade me drink.
As I drank, I felt better and began to calm down as my anxiety
ebbed away. He asked me about the events of my journey and my
travelling companions. I had a few things to say, as there
were more than a few mishaps, and I had some complaints about
one of the friends, but as I was about to make mention of
that, He said, "Yes, I know, but so long as there are youth so
strong and steadfast in the Cause, as you - who are as an
immovable mountain - actions of people like that are not
worthy of mention."

By this single statement, many points became obvious to
me. I was now confident that both apparent and hidden aspects
of people were crystal clear to 'Abdu'l-Baha.      No need was
there   for   self-disclosure   from one like me.    Suddenly I
became conscious once again that I was in the presence of
'Abdu'l-Baha, the "Mystery of God."      Then 'Abdu'l-Baha in a
loud voice addressed one of the friends known as Aqa Mu9ammad-
Rida Qannad. He said, " I have written a prayer for the
martyrs of Yazd.     I will chant it to you, listen as well. "
He began to chant by heart.        The timbre of His voice had
such impact upon me emotionally, that I am incapable of
explaining its effect, especially the power and

magnificence He manifested in that hour.

Aqa Mirza ~asan Adib Taliqani, the Hand of the Cause, had
a very close relationship with me. With extreme kindness, he
had related to 'Abdu'l-Baha the events and the sequence of the
debate which had taken place in my house that historic night,
especially of my father's temper, anger and dissatisfaction
over my joining the Baha'i religion. At times 'Abdu'l-Baha
would make mention of that episode and would remark as to its
significance.

The City of 'Akka

'Akka was a city with a very foul environment. It was
exceedingly filthy. Its alleys were dark and narrow. There
were scarcely any trees or greenery of any kind. It's
inhabitants were accustomed to these conditions, and at any
rate, had no power to do anything to alleviate the situation
the city was in.   Since everyone who knows of 'Akka is aware
to some degree of the poor condition of this city, I will
leave this subject alone.

This run-down and ruinous city was under martial law. It
had only one gate, which was constantly patrolled by guards.
Leaving the city itself was difficult. It was hardly possible
for anyone to make it out to the surrounding fields and escape
the pitiful environs of the city with its looming and
threatening towers. At dusk, the bugles would sound and all
the hustle and bustle would grind to a halt. Everyone had to
return to their houses, which were no better than holes, and
remain there. Close to the house of 'Abdu'l-Baha, a military
garrison was stationed which kept close watch at the least
movement of the friends. It was certainly not very easy for
the devoted friends of 'Abdu'l-Baha to cope under such
restrictions.

Most of the Baha'i pilgrims would become il 1. After
traversing the long distance between Tehran and 'Akka, with
primitive means of travel and lodging overnight in low-grade
inns and weathering adverse climates, they had to face the
unhealthy conditions of 'Akka and became even more distressed
when witnessing the hardships of 'Abdu'l-Baha.

There was only one Turkish doctor who carried on his
practice in the back room of a pharmacy under very poor
conditions. It seems that Abdu'l-Baha was not very happy with
him. Among those who took ill was myself. According to what my
friends tell me, I was so ill that I was in a coma for twenty
days. At last, one day I opened my eyes and saw 'Abdu'l-Baha
who was visiting me.

Suddenly, I wanted to get up and show my servitude and
pay my respect. But I was not able to do so. He was also very
gracious and prevented me from doing so. He showered me with
unlimited blessings. He then spoke with each one of the
patients there, and at last He returned to me and said, "You

will recover. Of this you can be sure." After recovering, I
learned that 'Abdu'l-Baha had taken the trouble to visit me on
several occasions while I was ill. Upon my recovery, 'Abdu'l-
Baha advised me that in order to improve my condition, I
should travel to various holy places in Palestine. He said, "I
desire myself to go there and visit but have no leave to do
so. " He then sent a letter of introduction (for me) to
'Abdu'l-Rasul, who was residing in Jerusalem, in the vicinity
of the Dome of the Rock.

Journey To Jerusalem

In obedience to 'Abdu'l-Baha's command I departed from

It was night when I arrived at Jerusalem. With great

> Tehran. You have come to see 'Abbas Effendi! What therefore
> are you doing in Jerusalem?" To make a long story short,
> instead of kindness and hospitality, they attacked and
insulted me. Especially Rabbi Elezar Ha' im, who had been

present the night of the encounter between the Jews and
Baha'is. He was somewhat informed about the Faith and as I had
mentioned before, had, at one time insulted Jinab-i-Varqa. He
had in fact abused and insulted me more than anyone else. As
my principal opponent there, he acted as if he owned Jerusalem
and all of Palestine and that I had entered their precincts
without permission of the Feudal landlord. Whenever he would
catch sight of me, he would object seriously saying, "You're
a Baha'i why have you come to Jerusalem?" But I would pay him
no heed. I was aware of all the machinations and ill behaviour
of this type of people, which had been foretold in the Torah.
I realized there, that these were no longer my kindred but
that my real family and friends were the friends of God, (the
Baha-is, My spiritual companions.

Wedding Reception In Jerusalem

One of my acquaintances held a wedding reception in
Jerusalem, and had invited a host of guests. I don't know for
what reason, but I was invited too. Some who were not to
pleased to see me there and who did not like my company
complained to the host as to why I had been invited.
Protesting most vigorously was Rabbi Elezar Ha'im, whom I've
referred to several times before. He was one of the most
prejudiced among the Jews and was especially perseverent in
his enmity toward me. He was most uncomfortable and began to
whisper in protest and make an occasional sarcastic remark
against me. At first I did not want to say anything to him, as
I knew nothing would move his heart of stone. But he would not
keep quiet. Since I was fairly well-grounded in knowledge of
the Torah, I recited a few verses to make a point, and
challenged him to respond. As he was unprepared to answer he
changed the subject.

At length I said, "There is a verse in the Torah which
says,   'The Kingdom will not depart from the Jews until the
messiah comes.' Now suppose you show me either the Messiah or
the Kingdom?" When the argument had reached this pitch, he
tore open his collar and became infuriated, calling me various
names and insulting me. Others confronted him, saying, "What
sort of behaviour is this? If you don't know the answer why
do you argue, and if you do know, why don't you respond
properly and let us learn something? This kind of debate and
demand for proofs does not require so much ranting and
raving!" The Rabbi got more upset than before, so he created
an even greater disruption. This disturbed everyone present.
It prompted me to leave and stopped me from socializing with
them any further as long as I remained in Jerusalem.

Holy Places In Jerusalem

In Jerusalem there was a certain Baha'i named 'Abdu'l-
Rasul Nahhas, who was a confectioner. I went to see him. I had

in fact left my relatives for good and turned towards new
brothers. After introducing myself and going through the
conventional formalities, I explained my purpose:       "By the
express wish of ~bdu'l-Baha, I should visit the various Holy
Places here. The problem is I know no Arabic. Would you
accompany me as a guide and translator?" He accepted openly
and willingly, but soon said, "Since the (Muslim) fast is
about to end soon, I'm busy making sweets for the f i tr

(festivity to end the fast of Ramadan), so why don't I finish
my work and after the fitr we'll go wherever you like." Of
course I agreed to do so. So during the next few days I would
assist him in preparing all his pastries. In fact it was quite
a pleasant experience. The sweets were prepared the way he
wanted, and when the fitr was over, we went to visit various
religious leaders in Jerusalem.

After that, we departed for Holy Places such as Bethlehem,
and as we entered the large church there, we found some people
praying. We also visited the birthplace of Jesus, especially
the stable where the baby Jesus was born. In that place there
was a statue figure of a donkey which, according to legend,
with it's own breath would keep the new born infant warm.
Following our visit and chance to observe the birthplace of
His Holiness Jesus, we came back to town,      and Abdu'l-Rasul
mentioned that one of the most important and illustrious
judges in the city had become a Baha'i. "Would you care to pay
him a visit?" he asked. His name is Yusuf Effendi and he
serves in the Ministry of Justice. So with great enthusiasm,
we went to see him.

The judge's house-servant announced our coming. He was
overjoyed to see us, and rushed to the door to receive us.
After greeting him with "Allah-u-Abha" and my being introduced
by 'Abdu'l-Rasul as one of the Baha'i friends from Tehran, who
had just come from the presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha, the judge
became even more delighted.

He was presiding over a trial involving a dispute between
a husband and wife. At once he dismissed the trial, dropped
the charges on both sides and said, "Out of respect for a dear
friend who has come to see me, I hereby release you both to go
with joyous hearts." Together we went to his home. He had an
air of modesty and sense of humanity about him. He was
remarkably kind and loving towards us. After tea, I asked how
it came to be that he accepted the Faith.     At once he stood
up, placed his hand over his heart, and with consummate
respect he said, "At al-Azhar University, the foremost centre
of learning for the entire Muslim World, I was a pupil of our
master, Jinab-i-Abu'l-Fadl, and through him, I turned towards
the Holy Cause." So remarkable were the titles of respect the

judge would utter, out of veneration for Abu'l-Fagl, as would
astonish the listener. He then brought out the tablet known as
the Sura of the Temple and we read through it together.
Afterwards we all left to see several different places in
town. We came to a place of particular significance to shell-
carving artisans. There, they were making very delicate and
beautiful objects from shells. Yusuf Effendi bought a very
handsome set of pearl-like beads and gave it to me with
instructions, that, on my return to the presence of 'Abdu'l-
Baha, I should beg him to accept these beads (as a gift).

The humility and modesty of this man who commanded such
respect - a man of learning and high station - impressed me
deeply. A just description of this man, who never failed to
impress any one who met him, is beyond my capacity. Especially
moving was the deference and self-effacement he had for

'Abdu'l-Baha, and likewise his immense admiration and respect
for Abu' 1-Fac;ll. The manner by which the judge would even
mention Abu'l-Fadl's name, let alone reminiscing about him,
was quite striking indeed. After a thorough visit of Bethlehem
City, we bade him farewell, and made our return to Jerusalem.
From Jerusalem, we journeyed to the city of Hebron to pay our
respects at the Tomb of Adam, Eve, Abraham, Jacob and Joseph.
We then entered a mosque where everyone was engaged in
obligatory prayers. Following this we went to other places of
interest, so that there was no sight unseen nor Holy Place
unvisited, and each was observed with great care. Wherever we
would encounter reciters of the Qur'an, we would give alms to
those who made mention of God Almighty. When our pilgrimage
and visitations came to an end, we returned once more to
Jerusalem. The inhabitants of the city of "The friend of God"
(Abraham, referring to the city of Hebron) were far from
civilized. They were rough, savage, prejudiced, and dirty.
Especially noticeable was a blood feud taking place between
two antagonistic clans. We could hear the shooting of rifles
and the cries of women and children everywhere. All this was
coinciding with an outbreak of cholera, spreading epidemically
in a certain direction and resulting in many deaths.     As we
returned to Jerusalem, we decided to next visit the old city
and the Temple Site.    In the sight of the Jews, the Temple
Site with the Wailing Wall had an exalted station. Jewish
mothers and fathers would instill in the hearts of their
children from the beginning of childhood, love and admiration
for this place. Thus this site is held in highest esteem by
rich and poor, young and old alike. All Jews long to pay a
visit to the site. In Jerusalem, across from the Temple Site
of the prophet Solomon, there are two Mosques. One is known as
al-Aqsa and the other, which is very great and beautiful, The
Dome of the Rock. The latter is believed to have been erected
by Omar, the second Caliph.

As we were looking at this Mosque, suddenly 'Abdu'l-Rasul
grabbed my sleeves and whispered in my ear: "We must escape."
Instantly we made our escape. When we reached our hiding and

were safely out of sight, I asked the reason for our escape.
He replied, "You didn't notice the group of bandits that was
about to ambush us? They could tell we were foreigners and
were ready to shed our blood had we stayed any longer."
'Abdu'l-Rasul was right, because I had also noticed that a
group of Arabs were pointing their fingers at us and were
murmuring to one another. But since I did not know Arabic, I
didn't realize their intentions. It was fortunate that 1Abdu'l-
Rasul was so observant in overhearing and figuring out what
they were about to do. Lucky for us this happened after we had
seen all the other Holy Places, so this incident caused us no
further regret.

We had in fact visited all the other Jewish Holy Places
even though the Jews themselves generally do not dare to enter
these.    Their justification for this was that since we are
sinners and are under God's punishment (In Hebrew: In Kalut,
dispersed and in captivity), we should not enter the Sanctuary
and defile that sacred spot by our sins. This must be so until
our deliverer, the Messiah, appears and our sins are forgiven.
Now as to what precisely their "sin" is they don't know, but
confess to it anyway. But you honoured reader, know with
certainty that the sin of the Jews was their denial of Jesus,
the promised one of the Torah. There are many proofs in
support of this point, but where are their hearing ears and
where is their sense of justice to accept this fact.

They say:   "We are sinners", but fail to know what sin
they have committed, and in any event sheer prejudice is a
barrier even if you wish to explain it to them • They rub
their faces on the back of the great stone wall known to have
been raised by David and embellished later on by Solomon. They
wail and implore foregiveness from God. They ask God to hasten
the advent of the Messiah, to release them from sufferings and
free them from this Kalut. Yet they are steeped in ignorance
and do not know that the Messiah has manifested Himself, that
their Saviour has appeared. Another reason for their not
entering that sacred place was, in my opinion, deterrence by
the Arabs. No doubt, were Jews to set foot in that place, they
would be slain by Arab hands.

From there we went to the sight where Jesus was crucified.

There is a church in that place. We asked the high priest to
permit us to see the inside of the church. We said that we
were willing to sit through the entire ceremony, and so he
accepted.    We we entered the chapel, it was very dark, the
altar was a large statue of Jesus upon the cross, which was
most glorious and impressive. During the visit there, it
seemed to me that the people in the sanctuary were very short,
but when I observed more closely, I realized they were walking
on their knees and bowing before the figure of Jesus. It
instantly occured to me what influence and power was in Jesus,
so that after 1900 years, people with the utmost devotion,
self-effacement, and humility lay their heads upon His
threshold, ready to obey His every command. But where are the

eyes to see and ears to hear, and where are the persecutors
and disbelievers who might at last see the error of their
ways?

Having undertaken a pilgrimage to all these Holy Places,
and after observing every ritual, such as lighting a candle,
giving alms and kneeling down in a Holy Shrine - this done in
accordance with the wish of 'Abdu'l-Baha, I left, ready to
return to the presence of my beloved Master.

'Abdu'l-Baha's Message and Instructions

Wherever possible during my sojourn in Palestine and
pilgrimage to the Holy Places of the Jews and Christians,
especially in Jerusalem, I would speak to the Jews about the
cause of Baha'u'llah and whatever I had gleaned from the word
of God. As I have mentioned in several places I openly taught
the Faith to people high and low.

As stated previously, together with 'Abdu'l-Rasul Nahhas,
we were invited to a wedding reception held by a Jewish
family, who had known me before in Tehran. As we entered, I
became aware that all the opponents and Rabbis I had
encountered, both in Tehran as well as in Jerusalem and with
whom I had discussed the Faith, were there, each and everyone.
Moments after my arrival, religious subjects cropped up in
conversation from every corner. At first I resolved to keep my
silence. But I soon realized they were abusing my silence and
acting rude. Then I let loose my tongue to convey whatever I
knew from the Torah to produce proofs in support of this great
Cause. Of course, none would accept. In reality, none had
hearing ears, so it was necessary to bring them to silence. I
said, "Do you have Faith in the Torah? Is not this Torah the
very truth?" Everyone present affirmed their avowal of faith.
I resumed, "Then pray, tell what is the meaning of the Holy
verse which says, 'The Kingdom will never depart from the Jews
nor the sceptre from between their feet, until the Messiah
appears as well as verses similar to this. 0 Rabbi, if your
honour, you do indeed have the Kingdom, then reveal it to me.
If, on the other hand, you do not, know of a truth that the
Messiah has appeared." These subtle points were murmured from
mouth to mouth and created a stir, which in turn created a
disturbance and ill-feelings. Everyone present betrayed his
own true nature. Some reacted rudely, others resorted to
slander, and still others started arguments. Episodes like
this had happened before and all the previous experiences were
basically the same, provoking indignation and wrath among the
Jews. Apparently 'Abdu'l-Rasul reported to 'Abdu'l-Baha the
gist of al 1 experiences with Jewish Rabbis in order to
proclaim to them the faith, and that the result had been
verbal abuse.

One day, Aziz'u'llah Jazzab came from 'Akka to Jerusalem.
He came straight away to meet with 'Abdu'l-Rasul and myself.

After greeting me, he gave me the blessed message that I had
been summoned to return to 'Akka with him, and that I did not
have permission to teach these people (the Jews) for the time
being, since it was not yet the time for pursuing, that course
of action. I obeyed, and made my way back to 'Akka with him.

In the Presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha at Bahji

It was Friday when we reached 'Akka along with Aziz'u'llah
Jazzab. 'Abdu'l-Baha had gone to Bahji with friends and
pilgrims. In a garden adjacent to the Holy Shrine of
Baha'u'llah, we attained His presence, as our desire to see

'Abdu'l-Baha had drawn us to Bahji. The friends were present,
as 'Abdu' 1-Baha was giving a talk.        As we attained His
presence, we fell at His feet.     Then 'Abdu'l-Baha, with His
invigorating intonation, stated, "Your pilgrimage will surely
be accepted, as you have visited many Holy Places - places we
ourselves would like to see, yet are forbidden from doing so."
These statements might not be the exact utterances of 'Abdu'l-
Baha, but this is what continues to echo in my ears after 40
years. Following this, in the presence of all those gathered,
He bestowed infinite blessings upon the Jewish people. He
predicted that in the near future, the children of Israel
would return to this land, attain independence and exercise
sovereignty. The children of Israel would become renowned
throughout the world. Such statements of 'Abdu'l-Baha and His
blessing upon these mean and ill-tempered people, after all
the poverty and powerlessness, along with all the pride I had
witnessed, was simply beyond belief. Jerusalem was in the
hands of the Arabs, who were strong and prejudiced and they
were just a handful of impotent, meek, timid and homeless lot
of old Jewish men. 0 Godl What a blessing this was, what a
profound statement. Just how were the Jews to achieve their
sovereignty and independence? As it stood now, the Arabs did
not even let the Jews visit their own Holy Places. How then
would the Arabs ever permit them to have their own government
and self-rule?

As the mere contemplation of all these things had
bewildered me and I could contain myself no longer, I kissed
the ground out of respect and with utmost humility asked:
"Your Honour, the people of Israel, will they be re-gathered
and achieve their independence on their own, or do so after
accepting the 'Baha'i Faith?" 'Abdu'l-Baha replied:      "These
very children of Israel, these very children of Israel will do
so on their own." Then he turned His blessed face towards me
and said, "You will see for yourselves as well." I wrote all
this down in my note book, and in Tehran I mentioned this to
some of my Jewish friends especially Aqa Zechariah and now I
am witness to it. Aqa Zechariah was a rich and influential man
among the Jews. He was an old friend of mine and secretly
believed in the Cause of Baha'u'llah. But he kept his faith

hidden. Even his children (known now by the surname Qatan)
never found out. (One of the authors friends - David Qatan -
who accepted the Faith at a later time, eventually discovered
that his father was a Baha'i. David has been the recipient of
several tablets as wel 1. But the other children remained
Jewish. )

Editor's Note

The author recounted these events at the time when the
state or Israel had already been formed. Iran, moreover, had
extended its recognition of Israel, and every day in Tehran,
articles would appear regarding the Israelis, their new
government and their conflicts with the Arabs.           These
reminiscences brought the author much satisfaction, but would
also trigger anxiety in him over the fact that the Jews were
so outnumbered by the Arabs, to the extent that the Jews could
be wiped out in a single moment.

lt would be timely and fitting at this point to enrich
this narrative by introducing a Tablet and prayer of 'Abdu'l-
Baha revealed in these days. This Tablet concerns the eventual
emancipitation of the Jews and their glorious destiny, under
the protection of the Lord of Hosts, Baha'u'llah.

He is God!

0 God! In the Books of the Prophets, Thou hast given
> good news and glad-tidings to (the people of) Israel, and
> you have given the promise that there would come a day
> when the despair of Israel would be transformed into hope,
> and that those in captivity and the downtrodden might at
> last find eternal glory. That wondrous Tribe shall, under
> the shadow of the Lord of Hosts, find security and
> settlement in the Holy Land and, from the far lands
> abroad, return unto Zion. Those, who were once lowly shall
> be cherished, and those who were formerly poor are
> destined to become powerful.

Those, who were forgotten shall find fame and renown
> and those once detested shall become the beloved of the
> peoples of the world. Now, praise be to God, that day of
> tranquillity has arrived, and the means of happiness and
> joy are now within reach. Soon will all of Israel become
> glorious,   and  this   diaspora   be   transformed   into
> regathering.

The Sun of Truth has arisen, and a ray of di vine
> guidance has alighted upon Israel, so that they will enter
> the Holy Land from far-away routes in the utmost joy.

0 God! Fulfil Thy promise, and bring honour upon the
progeny of His Holiness Abraham. Thou art the Powerful,

the Able, and Thou art the Seer, the Hearer, the All-Wise.

-- 'Abdu'l-Baha Abbas

Permission Granted To Fashion A Rida (Overcoat)

The boundless blessings and kindness of the Master gave me
courage enough to seek permission to fashion a garment for
Him. Out of consideration for me, He also honoured my request
to choose the fabric Himself. Thus one day we paid a visit to
the local fabric shop. The salesman there asked for more than
the going price. This took 'Abdu'l-Baha by surprise and He
replied, "It's quite expensive. This is not a fair price. In
business and trade, that which is most equitable should be
practiced." None the less, 'Abdu'l-Baha paid what the man had
originally asked. At any rate, the material was obtained. I
then took His measurements after respectfully circling around
Him (tavaf). I commenced tailoring the coat.    Every now and
then I would go to His presence to fit the coat. Each time I
would approach Him with the utmost respect, I would experience

In the Presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha after His release

The first day I attained the presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha was
during the days of His imprisonment, but some time later He
was no longer subject to confinement.    'Abdu'l-Baha at first
would not set foot out of the prison-city, despite the fact
that many begged Him to do so.        To this He would often
respond: "We are preoccupied with a number of commitments. We
remain here. " The covenant-breakers would spread rumours that
freedom had been given to us but withheld from Him. 'Abdu'l-
Baha was supposedly a prisoner still and was kept confined.
This was of course intolerable for those faithful to 'Abdu'l-
Baha , and thus many would urge Him to exit 'Akka. Some of the
friends approached me and said, "You beg Him -- insist! His
consideration for you is so great that He might accept your
request."

So it happened one day that I found myself fitting His
rida on Him and dared to say to Him:     "Your honour, if only
You would allow for a party to be held in Your honour in the
garden of Ridvan, the friends might attain Thy presence." He
responded, "Very wel 1. " I immediately said, "Choose, Your
honour, a date, if You will." "Wednesday," was the reply.

He stressed that the friends of Beirut, Tiberias, Adasa
and elsewhere be informed and invited.    I said that all this
would be carried out, then He called upon Aqa Rida Qannad (the
confectioner) and ordered that sweets be prepared, especially

a certain kind of baklava.    He also ordered fruits, tea and
sharbat. The very next day, 'Abdu' 1-Baha sent a message
through the Innkeeper to me saying, "Do you have the resources
to do this? Do not, by any means, spend all of your money."
But as I had some gold currency with me and funds invested
with friends, with some assurance I replied, "Please tell Him
that I do have sufficient funds." He then gave permission for
a similar gathering for the ladies to be held the same day.
The friends were thrilled at His acceptance of this invitation
as it would be the occasion where He would at last set foot
outside of 'Akka. They were extremely appreciative of me and
kindly helped me in arranging the event. In the garden of
Ridvan there are a few very ancient mulberry trees alongside
a stream. These trees together create a rather large shaded
area, not unlike the great tents recounted in the tales of the
Prophets. (A passage in sacred tradition says of the latter
days that the Lord of Hosts with His angels shall, beneath
green tents, reign with justice.) On that joyous day, 'Abdu'l-
Baha, the blessed Centre of the Covenant of Baha 'u' l lah,
walked to and fro beneath these great green tents of mulberry
trees and gave speeches. A number of the Hands of the Cause
and   Afnans  and   friends   were  present.   That   day  was
unforgettable for me especially because I was of service to
Him.   My point is not to boast, and for this reason I will
refrain from relating more of the event, especially in regards
to the special blessings vouchsafed to me by Him. Instead I
will proceed to other subjects.

Pilgrimage to Bahji, the Shrine of Baha'u'llah

in the Company of 'Abdu'l-Baha

Many times I would accompany 1Abdu' 1-Baha to visit the
resting place of Baha'u'llah at Bahji. In those days Bahji was
in the hands of the Covenant-breakers. At times I would ride
beside 'Abdu' 1-Baha in a horse drawn carriage, but on most
occasions we would simply go on foot. Along the way we would
make our approach with profound humility and self-effacement,
immersing ourselves in prayer and reciting sacred verses. As
we would approach Bahji, we would perform our ablutions in an
adjacent garden. Prayerfully, and with feet bared, we would
enter the Shrine of Baha 'u' llah while 'Abdu' 1-Baha would
sprinkle rosewater on each pilgrim's hand. Following this,
'Abdu'l-Baha would chant the Tablet of Visitation in heavenly
intonations. Afterwards we would return in the same manner.
The recitation of the Tablet of Visitation would create a
wondrous atmosphere amidst those assembled. This atmosphere
would be all the more rarefied by the selflessness of 'Abdu'l-
Baha and how this was reflected in the style of His
intonation. Memorable as well was the kindness ~bdu'l-Baha
would shower on those friends who remained steadfast in the
Covenant. To truly recount those moments is beyond words, the

words simply do not exist.

Some Answered Questions

One of my most sweet and cherished memories hark back to
the days when 'Abdu'l-Baha would send the caretaker to summon
me for lunch. During most of these gatherings, 'Abdu'l-Baha
would hold a vessel in His hand and would pour out water for
everyone to wash their hands for lunch. At the table, He would
take care to personally show hospitality to the guests, or see
to it that each was served.     He would also entertain those
present with anecdotes so humorous that everyone would burst
with laughter and were hardly able to contain themselves. The
Master would often say, "Food should be taken with happiness. "
For some time an American lady, who was also very captivated
by 'Abdu'l-Baha, would sit at the table as well. Her name was
Laura Clifford-Barney*. She was very dear to 'Abdu'l-Baha and
much respected by Him. She would ask various questions from

'Abdu'l-Baha. He would answer with profound simplicity and
would sometimes repeat Himself a few times (to respond more
effectively).    Certain men were present to        record His
statements. One day before she had a chance to ask her
question, 'Abdu'l-Baha remarked, "Now you might as well ask,

'Why did God create the scorpion?'" By chance the lady moments
later put forth the very same question, and the audience
smiled. 'Abdu'l-Baha replied, "All species are creatures of
God. Were the scorpion in its own world to ask, 'Why did God
create man to kill it', what would you answer?" The style of
Abdu'l-Baha was such that He would not depart from the subject
so long as she was not convinced. These talks were compiled in
the form of a book, known as Some Answered Questions. Now this
book is in the hands of some of the friends and is treated as
though its pages were sheets of gold.

A number of Jewish and Muslim religious leaders have
acquired this book as well and drawn from it. I had the
inestimable honour of being present at the time of the
revelation of these discourses. When at times Miss Clifford-
Barney* was not present at the table, 'Abdu' 1-Baha would
address some other person and would shower His bounty on each
one in a special way. One day, as we gathered in the presence
of 'Abdu'l-Baha, He ordered Jinab-i-Shaykh Muhammad-i-Qa'inf
to chant a prayer. He thus intoned a prayer in Arabic, which
delighted 'Abdu' 1-Baha. He then asked Jinab-i-Shaykh, "Tell us
of the beatings you had to endure." He then recounted briefly
his sufferings and the persecutions he experienced in the path
of God. He had just escaped one outbreak of persecution and

known as Madame Dreyfus. She is still alive and well. At a later date I
met her and her husband in Paris, and carried on correspondence with her
husband.

had fled to Isfahan. As enemies of the Faith had begun to
inflict abuse on him there as well, he fled in disguise to
India, and from there to the Holy land. Jinab-i-Shaykh, was
always the subject of exceptional bounty and blessings from
'Abdu'l-Baha, and most of the time he would be addressed by
'Abdu'l-Baha in the course of these talks.

The Gift of Two Lire

In those days while in the presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha, I had
not yet reached thirty years of age. One day in His presence,
I asked if I should travel to Europe. He encouraged this, and
heartily endorsed the idea. He said: " You, descendant of
Abraham, are assisted by divine confirmations. You go. You
will no doubt be successful."     So I was confident upon my
dismissal from 'Abdu'l-Baha's presence that I should go to
Europe.   Therefore I wrote a letter to Tehran and asked for
the balance of my capital which I had left in the hands of
Haji Mirza 1Abdu'llah Sahih Furush.
'   I requested that it be sent immediately. While awaiting the
transfer of these funds, I was all the while deriving
enrichment from the presence of 'Abdu' 1-Baha. During this
time,'Abdu'l-Baha was erecting a structure in the heart of
Mount Carmel. Very few would know that this was to become the
Shrine of the Bab. But certain enemies along with Covenant-
breakers had taken advantage of the situation and had written
false rumours to the Imperial Court of the Ottoman Empire that
'Abdu' 1-Baha was erecting a fortress replete with battle
stations. As a consequence of these representations, the
Ottoman Court sent a task force to 'Akka to investigate the
matter.    Prior to their arrival,' Abdu' 1-Baha excused the
pilgrims and gradually dismissed the visitors. One day, Aqa
Mu~ammad-Hasan whispered in my ear that I had been asked to
leave as well. Suddenly I felt as though I had been struck by
a thunderbolt. I stood motionless and was utterly discouraged
and hopeless. Aqa Muhammad became aware of my distress from

the look at my face. So he started to comfort me and advised
me that no one was really willing to leave the Holy Threshold
of the Beloved.    Aqa had words of comfort for those in the
same situation, all of whom were in great distress. I replied,
"Yes of course I'll obey and this I must but ..• "         "But
what?" --- "But, •.• I have written to Tehran to send me my
money. It hasn't arrived yet and I've already written several
more letters but still no reply has come as yet." Right then
and there, the words of 'Abdu' 1-Baha, "Do not run out of
money. If you have capital, do not exhaust those funds," kept
echoing in my ears.

Oh my God, I thought, what am I to do in this shameful
predicament? I was immersed in such worries, when I realized
I had not noticed Aqa MuQammad leave. I desired so much to be
able to fulfil my Master's wish, especially now that there was

the possibility of an incident. But to whom should I stretch
out a hand to beg? And I had nothing to serve as collateral.
From whom should I borrow? In any event, I stood paralysed,
simply unable to budge.

I was searching for a kind of salvation, unaware that a
saviour was near. I was still standing in the same place,
plagued by these concerns, when I heard Aqa Mu~ammad Hasan
once more. I raised my head to see his face. This time his
face was different, as he now had a winsome smile on his lips.
He took my hand in his, his eyes glittering with joy, and
said, "Don't be discouraged," and put two French gold lires in
my hand. Two French gold lires were equal to 40 French francs
at that time. I was astonished. I wanted to know the reason,
from whom and how this was obtained. He himself confessed:
"The blessed Master has given this. Since I saw that you were
so shaken, I went straight away to 'Abdu'l-Baha's presence and
reported what you had said. Then His Excellency, out of
generosity, presented these two gold Li res and said, "Give
this to that person." God alone knows how great was the shame
I felt. This whole thing came about due to my own short-
sightedness and I was filled with regret and self-accusation
but ••• His blessings to each one are so special that every man
exclaims "He is my Lord."

Journey to Beirut

Close to the time of departure, the blessed Master arranged
a most memorable meeting for us all, after which the friends
set off for their different destinations with an utmost sense
of fulfilment. I went to pay a visit to my old friend and
companion Jinab-i-Yunis Khan Afrukhtih, who was studying
medicine at the American college in Beirut. I was counting
heavily on him to render me some assistance and hospitality,
until what I had sent for would arrive. The two gold lires
were spent to get me to Beirut. At last, penniless and
dispirited, I reached the presence of my friend Dr. Yunis Khan
Afrukhtih, and explained the whole matter to him. He became
visibly disturbed and his expression changed.

Right away it became obvious to me that he had no power to
help me whatsoever. I said, "My friend, I have enough money in
Tehran to get me to Europe and back. I'm sure the money will
be sent to me. But perhaps we could come up with a solution
just in case the money is delayed." I realized he was not
inclined even to advise me on this. Then I said, "What of my
illness        are you able to cure me or not?" After a
considerable pause, dear Dr. Khan replied: "Right now you
should be taking castor oil." But I had no money even for this
medicinal oil. I did, however, own an overcoat, which served
me both as a coat and as a blanket. So I decided to sell the
coat. We went to the market place together and managed to sell
it for 18 gurush. First we purchased some castor oil and also

some cube sugar, and went back to Dr. Khan's room. After I
recovered from my illness, I wrote a harsh letter to Tehran,
but still no answer came. Telegraphs were very expensive then,
but as there seemed no other way, I sent a telegram. But,
alas, still no answer. What should be done? I should stay
alive and see the fulfilment of the divine promises as well.
Besides, I had many aspirations. After much contemplation, I
told Dr. Khan to please refer me to a boarding school. There
I would remain until the expected funds arrived. He said,
"This is really not possible, since you don't know the
language, nor have you any money. They simply won't accept
you." I responded, "Fine, just take me there and translate
what I have to say and leave the rest to me."

Since he had no other choice, he consented, and we
proceeded to the boarding school. I assured the principal that
I indeed had money in Tehran, but it had failed to arrive. "If
you accept me, you can be assured I'll pay you when the funds
come. I beg you not to let me die here out of starvation.
After all, you are humanitarians here, and I expect this kind
of generosity from you. I know for myself that this is
contrary to procedure, but extending a helping hand to a
fellow human being more than justifies your bending the
rules." I don't quite recall exactly in what manner I came
across and how it was I was able to influence him, but after
a long silence and prolonged contemplation, the principal
raised his head and stated, "As you yourself have noted, this
runs counter to our policy, but I'll accept you with full
personal responsibility." The problem was solved. I moved from
Dr. Yunis Khan's residence to the school. He was freed from
any further burden on my account, I was relieved and had
succeeded in buying some time for myself.

At the same time, I wrote a very harsh letter to Tehran,
and stated, "If you refuse to send me my money, I'll drown
myself in the sea, for I have no other choice and no other way
out." My entrance to school was a capital stroke of good
fortune. Since I intended to go to France and knew not a
single word in French, I studied French with such diligence
that the school authorities were quite amazed. They could
hardly believe that one with no educational background could
in so short a time progress so rapidly in conversation and in
other areas as well.

*Jinab ~aji Mirza had accepted the Faith in the time of Baha'u'llah and
had served the Faith valiantly, and was the go-between for forwarding
letters to 'Abdu'l-Baha, and transmitting His tablets to the friends. At
first he was known as Saqat-Furush, but in accordance with certain tablets
of 'Abdu'l-Baha, he became known as Sahih-Furush. In business, as a result
of not receiving what was due to him, he went bankrupt. But as he was very
honest and trustworthy, in the sight of Baha'is and non-Baha'is alike,
God's blessings were upon him.

At any rate, as a result of my threatening letters,
especially the last one, my family and relatives were alarmed,
and had gone to Haji Mirza 'Abdullah.    They put considerable
pressure on him: But his business had taken a turn for the
worse and he had lost his capital entirely, yet did not dare
to disclose this to anyone. Since he had no other choice in
the matter, he told my wife in Tehran, "Don't expect anything
from me. I simply have nothing left. My hands are empty".

So they went to one of my kind old friends, known as Aqa
Zachariah, (Father of Mr Qatan), who was secretly a Baha'i.
He was very rich and was able to render any kind of financial
assistance. But even that friend had asked for collateral, so
my wife disposed all of her personal jewellery and household
valuables to him. She received 300 gold lire, and sent this
sum. It took four entire months until this money came. Once I
received the money, I began to pay off all my debts. The most
important debt, paramount over all my other debts, was that
which I owed to His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Baha, which I repaid in
a very nice manner. I likewise satisfied my obligations with
the school. As I had become conversant in French in the
meantime, I said my farewells and especially thanked Dr. Yunis
Khan Afru!s.htih and all of my friends and authorities in
school. I then headed for Paris, with the permission, and
moreover, encouragement of 'Abdu'l-Baha.

Arrival in Paris

I arrived in the great city of Paris from the dark narrow
city of Tehran. In this populous and crowded metropolis, where
was I to go without any guide at my disposal? What direction
should I take?    What bustle!  What traffic!   As I left the
train station, for some time I stood outside, motionless and
overwhelmed, as I watched the wide and crowded streets, full
of speeding vehicles. The reader should have seen Paris then
in order to appreciate this description. In any event 'Abdu'l-
Baha's assurance of success and promise of divine assistance
was ever with me. After finding lodging and with time, I
adapted to these new circumstances. I realized how fortuitous
it was that I had the opportunity to learn French in Beirut,
what would I have done otherwise? So dear kindred, know that
there is a hidden wisdom in anything that happens. Perhaps at
times the future appears uncertain to you, but have no fear
nor allow yourself to be agitated. We should take hold of the
rope of reliance upon God, and supplicate for divine
assistance and success. I knew of course that if I failed to
find work soon, I would come face to face again with poverty
and uncertainty. There was no Dr. Yunis [ban here. Schools
here would likely not accept me. Tehran had added very little
to my sense of confidence. So I introduced myself to a
tailoring institute. I asked to be accepted as a pupil and be

enabled to work at the same time. The owner accepted me for a
one-week probation without wages. As he observed my diligence
and professionalism, he established wages for me. That income
was enough to meet my expenses, and gave me an opportunity at
the same time to master pattern-making - the most intricate
and technical aspect of tailoring. As my skills in tailoring
reached a high level of proficiency, I was introduced to an
advanced training program in tailoring, where I earned my
advanced degree in tailoring.

In the Company of Muzaffari'd-Dfn Shah

At this time Muzaffari'd-Din Shah, with an entourage of
distinguished and prominent members of high society, arrived
in Paris. When I was in Tehran, I had connections with 'Ayn
al-Dawlih and certain other members of the court, and I had
tailored suits for them. So in Paris I went to see them. The
entourage accepted me as part of the Royal Tour. This was a
boon to me from every angle. I was given some relief from the
costly living expenses of Paris, and no longer had to labour
so hard just to survive. I was able to concentrate more of my
time on perfecting technique and advanced yet further in the
craft of tailoring. At the same time, I made acquaintance with
various members of the court. Coming to know these influential
people   on   personal  terms   contributed   greatly   to  my
advancements in the future.

I recall one day I was taking a Qalyan (water pipe) to one
of the ministers of the Shah. His Majesty asked, "Who is this
youth?" He was told, "He is a progressive Persian young man,
very talented and quite knowledgeable. He has been a tailor in
Tehran, and is now residing in Europe for the time being to
study advanced tailoring. He has earned his advanced degree in
tailoring quite recently."

The King was very much surprised and exclaimed, "A degree
in tailoring! Does tailoring require such certification?" One
of the more cosmopolitan ministers present gave a detailed
overview of just how various crafts in Paris had specialized
to such a degree that training in them had become quite
technical, even scientific. He exaggerated on some points and
succeeded in building me up to such an extent that the Shah
himself became quite cordial and helpful towards me. He
decreed that I be one of those in his entourage to return to
Tehran.

Consequently, expenses for travel back to Tehran were taken
care of. I made use of the remaining cash thus saved to
purchase equipment necessary for my trade. After preparations,
I set out for Tehran as part of His Majesty's entourage. When
I set foot again in Tehran, it had been two years and some
months since my departure. In the spectacle of the Shah's
return, some people had spotted me among the Shah's entourage
and spread rumours about it. I soon found enormous fame. I was

not properly prepared in Tehran for the flood of customers
which streamed in. Virtually all the landed gentry and high
society people came and asked for my services.

The First European-Style Shop At Lalehzar Avenue

On either side of Lalehzar avenue were luxuriant gardens
and mansions of ministers and the rich. There were absolutely
no shops in that location. Shortly thereafter, at the entrance
of Lalehzar -- near to Sepah Square I set up an attractive and
spacious shop, after the fashion of European shops. It was
across from 'Ala'el'dulleh's mansion. I established the
business in a very efficient and orderly manner. As a result
of the steady flow of clientele frequenting so conspicuous and
successful a shop by the standards of Tehran at that time,

'Ala'el'dulleh became concerned. One day he summoned me, and
asked me a few questions. He said, "I should get to know who
is conducting business opposite my residence. I should
determine his belief. Otherwise, I would not be inclined to
tolerate the noise and commotion so close to home."         To
whatever he asked, I responded very politely, but soon I came
to realize that he was not satisfied. I realized as well that
certain jealous individuals had made secret accusations, to
cause confusion, in order to take advantage of the situation.
He asked, "What is your religion?" So I said, "Your Honour, I
have the utmost belief in His Holiness Mu~ammad, and in the
pure Imams. But I am not of the type of Muslims your Honour is
familiar with." I don't know what struck him, but he paused to
think, and started to slowly pace. There were a number of
people standing in his presence like statues. After a while
he raised his head and said, "You are dismissed now." He said
some other things which I cannot now recall. At a later date,
he summoned me once again, asked further questions and at
length showed me some very precious fabric. He wished to make
a rida out of this fabric. He had previously shown this cloth
to some of the well-known tailors of the city. They each said
the material was not enough for the task at hand, and each
requested twice the length of that piece. He then asked me if
I could tailor a suit out of that amount of material. I said:
"Yes, your Honour." He was taken aback and quite astonished.

In any event,      I  tailored the    rida to his exact
specifications. The clothing was cut smartly, was comfortable
and much to his liking. There was even a piece of material
left over, which I presented to him as wel 1. He became
delighted, praised my work and expressed gratitude to me. He
then turned to those in his presence, all standing with such
deference, with their arms crossed over their chests, and with
extraordinary rage shouted, "Others are just thieves. They
have nothing in mind apart from cheating and overcharging.
They all wanted more material, and demanded exorbitant
commissions. But this youth, despite everything said against

him behind his back, with less fabric and more equitable
commission, fashioned such a prized suit." At any rate, his
confidence and regard for me increased such that not
withstanding his power, respect, pride and dignity he would
come in person to my shop every now and then to visit me. This
remarkable treatment created quite a reputation for me. For a
while all this was the talk of everyone around us, that
'Ala'el'dulleh visited Aziz'u'llah's shop. This increasing
regard shown by 'Ala'el'dulleh would of itself stir up some
disgruntlement and jealousy among such of his company as his
secretary, butler, personal deputy, and so on. Among them,
Jinab-i-Mirza Mu~ammad !Qlan Muyafiq later accepted the Faith.
He would in fact bother me the most because of his harsh
Islamic prejudice. Every day he would contrive a fresh
insinuation, even accusing 'Abdu'l-Baha of something. This
slander hurt me the most. He bothered me so much that I
decided to teach him the Faith by whatever means possible,
just to rid myself of such problems.    Night and day I would
cry to the threshold of God on his behalf. Praised be God!
With the assistance of a group of friends, we succeeded in
teaching Mirza Muhammad 'Ali Khan. He at once declared his
Faith and became trustworthy, such that at last I became free.
This is the ideal way to treat one's enemies and opposition in
general.

Monsieur Dreyfus Meets Muzaffari'd-Din Shah

In Paris, I had met Monsieur Dreyfus, who was a very pure
and devoted Baha'i. We would encounter each other often and
would talk at length of the Faith, especially of the
persecution of Persian Baha'fs. As he grew more aware of the
plight of the Baha'is in Iran, he became increasingly
concerned. When I told him I'd become one of the company of
the Shah en route back to Iran, he insisted rather strenuously
that I devise a plan whereby he might be granted an audience
with the Shah, to intercede with him on behalf of the Persian
Baha'is. So persistent was he that at length I succeeded in
making the necessary arrangements for him to attend the
presence of the Shah.

After touching on various subjects at the outset, Mon.

Dreyfus stated: "It is a pity that my brothers, under the
kingship of so just and beneficent a monarch as you, should
endure such persecution and torture even to the point of
death."   The Shah reacted with some nervousness and asked,
"Who are your brothers in Iran?" Mon. Dreyfus made mention of
the Baha'fs. Of course the Shah already knew he was speaking
of the Iranian Baha'is, and asked if Mon. Dreyfus was himself
a Baha'i. He affirmed that he was, and the entire encounter
ranged over many other important subjects which greatly
impressed the Shah. The King had given his word to Mon.
Dreyfus that, upon his return back to Iran, he would look into

the matter, and moreover, Mon. Dreyfus could be assured that
the matter would be given personal consideration. As to the
other subjects broached in the course of that session, it is
not appropriate to recount them here. But what could be
expected from so weak a personality as Muzaffari'd-Din Shah?
He was, after all, completely in the hands of those around
him, who would manipulate him to suit their own ends, so that
he became the instrument for their personal machinations, ill-
intentioned as they were. He certainly had no power to keep
his word.

Mother's Death

Following my arrival in Tehran and setting up business, I
did not hesitate for a moment to serve the Cause of God, even
though my efforts in the material realm had intensified. Apart
from my family, parents, brother and other relatives, there
were a number of other people who looked to me for assistance.
I would not deny them that in order not to fall short of my
duty. Parallel to the advances I made materially, I was
conscious of spiritual concerns. I would serve the Faith with
heart and soul. In the best way possible, I would execute
decisions of the Local Spiritual Assembly. I recall once how
I arrived at a gathering a bit late. Jinab-i-Adfb Ilahi was
curious to know why. I replied that I had been quite busy, and
then apologized. He stated, "Affairs should be conducted in
such a way that one is in control of one's affairs, not vice
versa." This was quite good advice. Though my duties were
numerous, I was in control, though not without difficulty. In
my home, which was quite large back then, sizeable gatherings
would take place and many people would attend. Since my house
was suitable for such occasions, my mother would serve the
friends    with  whole-hearted    hospitality.   Most  of   the
responsibilities of feasts were on her shoulders. She would
serve willingly and would make sure my father would remain
undisturbed.    She did this, though outwardly she did not
profess belief in Baha'u'llah.

In those days, due to lack of security and the ever-present
threat of harassment from the non-Baha'fs and street people,
the friends would stay overnight at those places where
meetings were held, especially those who had come from some
distance. It's quite obvious that making preparations for
dinner, not to mention bed and breakfast, in those situations
was no easy task. The more overnighters there were the truer
this was, but my elderly and feeble mother would, with utmost
willingness and from the bottom of her heart, accept those
chores in order to take care of the guests.

It also happened that whenever disturbances would occur in
populous areas, Baha'i friends would stand ready to render
assistance to others facing danger, take them to their homes
and give them sanctuary. For instance, there was an attack

against the Baha' is in the district where Nayyer and Sina
lived, with the intent to kill these two holy souls. The
friends were alerted instantly and a group of youthful,
robust, and brave Baha'i friends were sent over to protect
them and their property. I was among such guards to assist in
predicaments like this. In one instance, a group of soldiers
who were Baha'is drew their swords and charged their
attackers, forcing the ruffians to flee. The fear these few
soldiers commanded was enough to ensure peace and order. After
some time, a Tablet was revealed in their honour.

To resume my mother's case who was in charge of hospitality
for the Baha'i gatherings in my house, she suddenly took ill
and was confined to bed. I tried my best and spared no efforts
to restore her to health. Many sleepless nights I stayed by
her bedside. A few times I arranged for medical consultations
by physicians. At length one night I fell asleep as mother
seemed better and relatives had insisted that I get some rest.
While I was asleep, my mother had suddenly raised herself up
and called out for me. I was not told (by those around her)
that she had closed her eyes forever to the world and all its
trappings, to partake of the blessings of her Lord.     When I
awoke, I learned that my mother had ascended to the Abha
Kingdom. I was overcome with grief and tears came to my eyes.
For a long time the thought of her would not leave my mind and
I had no peace until I was in 'Abdu'l-Baha's presence. His
Holiness was enquiring about various matters to which I would
reply, until the subject of my mother came up. Hidden
emotions, the burning embers of which the passage of time had
covered with ashes were inf lamed once again and tears of
sadness welled up from my eyes. With utmost humility, I sought
forgiveness on my mothers behalf. The Master accepted this
request, took up a pen and revealed a Tablet as follows:

Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Aziz'u'llah Khan Baha'i, upon
him be the Glory of God.

He is God!

0 Thou Kind Lord! Render Thy dear servant Aziz
> precious,  endow him with unlimited knowledge and
> discernment. Make him an overflowing chalice of the wine
> of love. Impart to him vigour. In business practices,
> make him prosperous. Immerse the mother of this servant
> of God in the ocean of forgiveness, and crown him with
> the Crown of Glory (Taj-i-Vahhaj).

Monsieur Dreyfus Comes to Tehran

During the time of the Constitutional Revolution when
Tehran was under martial law, Mon. Dreyfus came to Tehran
accompanied by Miss Barney and Madame Lashne. Soldiers were
protecting the city, yet it was still far from calm and
tranquil. Aggravating the entire situation and onslaught of
the revolution were the unsanitary conditions of the city. I
was sure that they would suffer a great deal in a town full of
dust which afforded not even the most primitive means of
comfort and hospitality compared to what I had been exposed to
in Europe. At that time there were no hotels or restaurants
in Tehran. Only on 'Ala'el'dulleh Street (now called Firdowsi
Avenue) there was a tailor shop above which there were a few
dirty and unkempt rooms which a Romanian entrepreneur dared
call a "Hotel".

Mon. Dreyfus and his companions had taken up residence
there. I went to visit them and see to their well-being. To my
surprise I discovered that not only were they content, but
they were quite excited to meet the Persian Baha'i friends.
They were not concerned with their accommodations at all.    I
accepted to serve as their guide and most of the time I would
look after them and arrange for their entertainment. I did
this, since they had come from the bridal city of the world to
the dusty dangerous city of Tehran.    Jalal'u'dulleh, son of
Zillu'Sultan, was one of the rich and influential men of
Tehran. He was on friendly terms with me and was very kind to
me. He had a very lovely and pleasant garden in suburban
Tehran. This district was known as Jalaliyih*. (* Jalaliyih
was located where Tehran university now stands.) One day I
told him that I had European guests and asked whether a party
might be arranged for them in Jalaliyih. Right away he said
yes. So I threw a very fancy reception in the Jalaliyih
Garden. Several Hands of the Cause and a large number of
friends came to meet Mon. Dreyfus, Miss Barney and Madame
Lashne. A speech was made about the services these individuals
had rendered the Faith. It was a great and memorable feast
which gave our Western friends untold joy and happiness
especially since beforehand I had the garden trimmed and the
water in the pond changed. The atmosphere and charm of the
garden was enhanced and the ripples in the pond beckoned Mon.
Dreyfus to wade in that crystal clear water. Later on, Mon.
Dreyfus himself told me that he enjoyed that occasion
tremendously and wrote about it in his memoirs. He likewise
wrote of the love and friendship of the Persian friends.
After numerous meetings with the friends and having gained
sufficient information, Mon. Dreyfus was ready to return.    I
I undertook to make the agreements and we agreed to meet once
again in Europe. Jinab-i-ijaji 'Abu'l-Hasan-i Ardakani, known
as ~aji Amin - very active in the Faith in the Holy land-made
mention of the services rendered by the Jewish Baha'i friends.
In response, a Tablet in my honour was revealed and received

through Haji Amin. I now cite it to grace this narrative and
to ornam~nt these pages:

> In care of Jinab-i-Amin, Tehran.
> To Aqa Mirza Aziz'u'llah !!.han, the Tailor.

Upon him be the Glory of God.

0 Spiritual Friend! Signs of divine triumph, in

Second Journey to Europe and Palestine,
and Attaining the Presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha Again

A little over two years had elapsed since my first trip to
Europe. After receiving a Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Baha' for the
second time, I made my departure for Europe on business, and
set out as well for pilgrimage to the Holy Land. I carried
with me a very worthy gift for my western friend, Mon.
Dreyfus. When I presented it to him, he was very much
surprised and asked for what reason? I replied "Don't you know
we are Persians?     It is customary among Persians to of fer
gifts and this is acceptable by Baha'u'llah. Doing this for a
friend like you is not too much at all." So he accepted the
gift, and this strengthened the bond and tie of friendship
between us. Consequently, we were corresponding all the time
and were constantly in touch. Whenever he intended to travel
he would let me know and I would inform him likewise.       In
short, whenever I would go to Europe, I would make certain to
meet him everytime.     I would also attend his firesides. His
style of presentation was like this: he would select a theme
from the Blessed Beauty or from 'Abdu'l-Baha, he would read
the quotation (in the original) then would translate.
Following this, he would elaborate on the significance of the
text until his audience understood it thoroughly, and
benefited from it. Mon. Dreyfus was always concerned over
'Abdu' 1-Baha' s heal th, and would learn of his wel !-being
through various means. Since he knew full well of my regard
for 'Abdu'l-Baha, he would share whatever news he obtained
with me as well. Keeping to my purpose in writing this book -
to give an account of days spent in 1Abdu'l-Baha's presence -
I shall get to the main point, and describe later the events
which took place in Paris during my second trip to Europe.

Having taken care of personal affairs in Paris and London,
I headed towards Southern France. In Marseilles, I boarded a
ship to Alexandria and from there to Haifa, until at last I
reached the presence of 'Abdu' 1-Baha.       Ater the initial
meetings with     'Abdu'l-Baha,   in which I    reaffirmed my

faithfulness to the Centre of the Divine Covenant, I settled
down in an Inn known as Khan-i-'Avamid, which served as the
residence for most of the pilgrims as well as local friends.
After several days, I began to notice that 'Abdu'l-Baha was
inwardly sad. He was thinking deeply -- would talk less, and
between addresses would pause for an unusually long time. It
was clear that He was immersed in an ocean of thought.
Moreover, signs of grief were so apparent in His pure face,
that the friends became heartbroken. For His joy brought
upliftment and sparked warmth in the hearts of those near to
Him,   while   his  sadness   would   render  His   companions
disconsolate. No one among the friends, pilgrims or locals,
knew the cause. One day, Jinab-i-Mishkin Qalam, with agitation
and profound sadness told the circle of friends and pilgrims:
"I have made up my mind that, either I will be expelled from
His presence this very day and be debarred forever from gazing
upon His loving face, or I will take Him out of this
tremendous grief and sadness." The friends then asked Him,
"What do you contemplate doing?"    He said, "I know what to
do." All the friends of course had heard of Mishkin Qalam, for
specimens of his calligraphy had circulated throughout the
East and the West of the Baha'i world, and they had gained
international fame. No Baha'i home is there in the East which
is not ornamented by a piece of his work, or at least a print
of it, and nearly the same is true in the West.     In all the
Baha'i Houses of Worship, artifacts of his calligraphy on
display continue to impress pilgrims and visitors alike. (The
present writer himself witnessed in one of the renowned
museums in the capital of Switzerland a piece of his work on
display in 1950. It was a rather large piece, approximately 1
1/4 x l metre. The calligraphy was a form of The Greatest
Name, and was hung in the first room after the entrance
itself, and would draw the attention of practically any
visitor.) Mishkin Qalam had very delicate features. His face
was not very attractive. He was nearly beardless, having only
a few threads on his chin. But he was quite well-spoken and
humorous in speech, and he would pull faces and look extremely
funny. The most stoic of listeners had no choice but to break
out in laughter. Friends and pilgrims would love him, forever
relishing his company. Every now and then the friends would
request a sample of his masterful calligraphy, and this he
would never deny anyone. Right there on the spot he would
create a piece and would present it to the one who asked for
it. He created a few pieces of his art for me, both large and
small. The last piece he did for me was when he was 88 years
old. This was the invocation, " Ya Baha'ul-Abha," written in
small characters, signed with a colophon as to the date and
his age at that time. The calligraphy in this piece is no
different from his previous works and is as striking and as
breathtaking as his earlier pieces! (These works of art were
in the possession of the martyr Jalal Azizi. They were
subsequently taken out of Iran and are with his relatives who

Mon. Dreyfus at a Baha'i gathering in Jalaliyeh Garden

survived him, in Vancouver) However it is not our purpose to
describe the life story of Mishkfn-Qalam but at this juncture
I had decided to make mention of one of his actions in the
presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha.

Mishkin Qalam was always a source of joy to 'Abdu'l-Baha

Though he would always bring gladness to 'Abdu'l-Baha this
time was different. This time he was determined either to
succeed in lifting 'Abdu'l-Baha out of His depression, sorrow
and deep thoughts, or be apart from Him forever. The friends
and pilgrims together were waiting to see His blessed person.
After His arrival and the exchange of greetings with the
friends, Jinab-i-Mishkfn-Qalam very soberly -- and without
advance permission -- stepped forward and with a very earnest
expression on his face, started to talk. But what he was

saying would make no sense. His words were nonsense -- some
Persian, some Arabic. His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Baha was listening
intently to see what he was trying to say, and was unaware
that something was going on. Mishkfn-Qalam was talking very
seriously and in between sentences would tell a joke and make
funny faces. Suddenly, losing his composure, 'Abdu' 1-Baha
started to laugh out loud. As a result of this display of
laughter and happiness, everyone present was affected as well.
Still, Mishkfn-Qalam was carrying out his plot a little
further to the point where everybody lost control and broke
out in riotous laughter, until at last 'Abdu'l-Baha restored
the gathering to silence. When silence at last prevailed,
Mishkfn-Qalam stated very soberly, "Yes indeed, why shouldn't
you laugh and make fun of me? You ( 'Abdu'l-Baha) have created
this crooked body and funny face in order to laugh at it." Now
as a result of this comic scene, happiness once more was
restored. 'Abdu'l-Baha praised him and was most kind to him.
For the depression of 'Abdu'l-Baha was removed, but the cause
of his depression remained a mystery and a secret to all the
friends.

Smoking Cigarettes and the Water Pipe

As previously mentioned, the friends residing in 'Akka were
living in a Caravansarai, known as fillan-i-'Avamfd. On the
second floor was a long wrap-around balcony to which all rooms
would open, overlooking the courtyard to the caravansarai.
Each room had another door, which would open up to a small
porch. His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Baha would once in a while come to
visit the friends there, to inquire after their well-being.
Usually He would return after saying a few things to all the
friends.
One day we were sitting in the meeting room. Some were

smoking water pipes and would talk about various things.
There were a few knocks on the door. The door was opened right
away and 'Abdu'l-Baha entered the room to visit the friends.
The room was full of smoke. The Master then walked quietly to
the other door, opened it all the way, and stepped out onto
the balcony. There He stayed for more than a few minutes. He
was gazing at the distant horizon. The door behind Him was
still open. Then it dawned on everyone that the door was ajar
to clear out the stale air in the room. When 'Abdu'l-Baha had
first entered the room, everyone stood up and removed the
water pipes to a corner of the room. And still, everyone was
standing, waiting for Him to re-enter the room. After 'Abdu'l-
Baha returned to that place, He made no mention of the foul
air there. His greetings to the friends were brief, and He
left earlier than was usual. This short visit and lengthy stay
on the balcony outside caused the friends to feel shame.
Everyone knew that the smoke from the hookahs and the impure
air in the room deprived them of the good-pleasure of His
company, and from being uplifted by His talks. Everyone there
expressed regret.    Following this incident,      I  went on
pilgrimage many more times, but never again saw either Baha'is
resident there or pilgrims smoking cigarettes or puffing
hookahs. (The author of this memoir believes that, until that
incident, the Tablet of Purity had not yet been revealed, and
that the circumstances of this encounter might well have led
up to the occasion of that momentous and valuable Tablet being
revealed for the peoples of the world. Certainly, had the
friends seen that Tablet beforehand, it would not have been
possible for them to have indulged in smoking, or in the
practice of any action which was not satisfactory to their
dear Master. Since the purpose of this narrative is to
enlighten the honourable reader, I shall thus ornament this
section with the text of the Tablet of Purity:)

[English translation is taken from Selections        from   the
Writings of iAbdu'l'Baha •• pp 146-150 E J

0 Friends of the Pure and Omnipotent God! To be
> pure and holy in all things is an attribute of the
> consecrated soul and a necessary characteristic of the
> unenslaved mind. The best of perfections is immaculacy
> and the freeing of oneself from every defect. Once the
> individual is, in every respect, cleansed and purified,
> then will he become a focal centre reflecting the
> Manifest Light.

First in a human being's way of 1 ife must be
> purity, then freshness, cleanliness, and independence of
> spirit. First must the stream bed be cleansed, then may
> the sweet river waters be led into it. Chaste eyes enjoy
> the beatific vision of the Lord and know what this
encouter meaneth; a pure sense inhaleth the fragrances

that blow from the rose gardens of His grace; a burnished
heart will mirror forth the comely face of truth.

This is why, in Holy Scriptures, the counsels of
heaven are likened to water, even as the Qur'an saith:
"And pure water send We down from Heaven," (Qur 'an 25:50)
and the Gospel: "Except a man be baptized of water and of
the spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God."
(John 3:5). Thus is it clear that the Teachings which
come from God are heavenly outpourings of grace; they are
rain-showers of divine mercy, and they cleanse the human
heart.

My meaning is this, that in every aspect of life,
purity and holiness, cleanliness and refinement, exalt
the human condition and further the development of man's
inner reality. Even in the physical realm, cleanliness
will conduce to spirituality, as the Holy Writings
clearly state. And although bodily cleanliness is a
physical   thing,   it hath,   nevertheles,   a powerful
influence on the life of the spirit. It is even as a
voice wondrously sweet, or a melody played: although
sounds are but vibrations in the air which affect the
ear's auditory nerve, and these vibrations are but chance
phenomena carried along through the air, even so, see how
they move the heart. A wondrous melody is wings for the
spirit, and maketh the soul to tremble for joy. The
purport is that physical cleanliness doth also exert its
effect upon the human soul.

Observe how pleasing is cleanliness in the sight
of God, and how specifically it is emphasized in the Holy
Books of the Prophets; for the Scriptures forbid the
eating or the use of any unclean thing. Some of the
prophibitions were absolute, and binding upon all, and
whoso transgressed the given law was abhorred of God and
anathematized by the believers. Such, for example, were
things categorically forbidden, the perpetration of which
was accounted a most grievous sin, among them actions so
loathsome that it is shameful even to speak their name.

But there are other forbidden things which do not
cause immediate harm, and the injurious effects of which
are only gradually produced: such acts are also repugnant
to the Lord, and blameworthy in His sight, and repellent.
The absolute unlawfulness of these, however, hath not
been expressly set forth in the Text, but their avoidance
is necessary to purity, cleanliness, the preservation of
health, and freedom from addition.

Among the latter is smoking tobacco, which is
dirty, smelly, offensive -- an evil habbit, and one the

harmfulness of which gradually becometh apparent to all.
Every qualified physicial hath ruled -- and this hath
also been proven by tests -- that one of the components
of tobacco is a deadly poison, and that the smoker is
vulnerable to many and various diseases. This is why
smoking hath been plainly set forth as repugnant from the
standpoint of hygiene.

The Bab, at the outset of His mission, explicitly
prohibited tobacco, and the friends one and all abandoned
its use. But since those were times when dissimulation
was permitted, and every individual who abstained from
smoking was exposed to harassment, abuse and even death -
- he friends, in order not to advertise their beliefs,
would smoke. Later on, the Book of Aqdas was revealed,
and since smoking tobacco was not specifically forbidden
there, the believers did not give it up. The Blessed
Beauty, however, always expressed repugnance for it, and
although, in the early days, there were reasons why He
would smoke a little tobacco, in time He completely
renounced it, and those sanctified souls who followed Him
in all things also abandoned its use.

My meaning is that in the sight of God, smoking
tobacco is deprecated, abhorrent, filthy in the extreme;
and, albeit by degrees, highly injurious to health. It is
also a waste of money and time, and maketh the user a
prey to a noxious addiction. To those who stand firm in
the Covenant, this habit is therefore censured both by
reason and experience, and renouncing it will bring
relief and peace of mind to all men. Furthermore, this
will make it possible to have a fresh mouth and unstained
fingers, and hair that is free of a foul and repellent
smell. On receipt of this missive, the friends will
surely, by whatever means and even over a period of time,
forsake this pernicious habit. Such is my hope.

As to opium, it is foul and accursed. God protect
us from the punishment He inf licteth on the user.
According to the explicit Text of the Most Holy Book, it
is forbidden, and its use is utterly condemned. Reason
showeth that smoking opium is a kind of insanity, and
experience attesteth that the user is completely cut off
from the human kingdom. May God protect all against the
perpetration of an act so hideous as this, an act which
layeth in ruins the very foundation of what it is to be
human, and which causeth the user to be dispossessed for
ever and ever. For opium fasteneth on the soul, so that
the user's conscience dieth, his mind is blotted away,
his perceptions are eroded. It turneth the living into
the dead. It quencheth the natural heat. No greater harm
can be conceived than that which opium inflicteth.

Fortunate are they who never even speak the name of it;
then think how wretched is the user.

0 ye lovers of God! in this, the cycle of
Almighty God,    violence and force,    constraint and
oppression, are one and all condemned. It is, however,
mandatory that the user of opium be prevented by any
means whatsoever, that perchance the human race may be
delivered from this most powerful of plagues. And
otherwise, woe and misery to whoso falleth short of his
duty to his Lord. (Qur'an 39:57)

0 Divine Providence! Bestow Thou in all things
purity and cleanliness upon the people of Baba. Grant
that they be freed from all defilement, and released from
all addictions. Save them from committing any repugnant
act, unbind them from the chains of every evil habit,
that they may live pure and free, wholesome and cleanly,
worthy to serve at Thy Sacred Threshold and fit to be
related to their Lord. Deliver them from intoxicating
drinks and tobacco, save them, rescue them, from this
opium that bringeth on madness, suffer them to enjoy the
sweet savours of holiness, that they may drink deep of
the mystic cup of heavenly love and know the rapture of
being drawn ever closer unto the Realm of the Al 1-
Glorious. For it is even as Thou hast said: "All that
thou hast in thy cellar will not appease the thirst of my
love -- bring me, 0 cup-bearer, of the wine of the spirit
a cup full as the sea?"

0 ye, God's loved ones! Experience hath shown how
greatly the renouncing of smoking, of intoxicating drink,
and of opium, conduceth to health and vigour, to the
expansion and keeness of the mind and to bodily strenth.
There is today a people (The Sikhs) who strictly avoid
tobacco, intoxicating liquor and opium. This people is
far and away superior to the others, for strength and
physical courage, for health, beauty and comliness. A
single one of their men can stand up to ten men of
another tribe. This hath proved true of the entire
people: that is, member for member, each individual of
this community is in every respect superior to the
individuals of other communities.

Make ye then a mighty effort, that the purity and
sanctity which, above all else, are cherished by Abdu'l-
Baha, shall distinguish the people of Baba; that in every
kind of excellence the people of God shall surpass all
other human beings; that both outwardly and inwardly they
shall prove superior to the rest; that for purity,
immaculacy, refinement, and the preservation of health,
they shall be leaders in the vanguard of those who know.

> And that by their freedom from enslavement, their
> knowledge, their self-control, they shall be first among
> the pure, the free and the wise.

Third visit to the Presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha

After completing my business trip in Europe, I set out to
make my visit to the beloved Master in Palestine by way of
southern France. When I arrived in Haifa, I approached Seyyid
Muhammad Taqiy-i-Manshadi and requested permission to attain
the presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha. At that time he was in charge
of all correspondence and contacts. As permission was given,
I at once left for 'Akka and attained the presence of 'Abdu'l-
Baha.    I found myself overwhelmed and threw myself at His
feet. He showed me so much kindness and love, asked about my
trip and my wife and children. Each day He would demonstrate
His compassion in a special way, and would discourse on
subjects with such subtlety as the tongue cannot recount. In
those days, Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Asad'u'llah Najaf Abadi and
Mirza Aqa Sahhaf were there for sometime as wel 1. One day
Jinab-i-Mirza Asad'u'llah, known as IJaji Asad'u'llah Zayni
grabbed hold of the cloak of 'Abdu' 1-Baha and said, "Your
Honour, I beg my wish to be fulfilled." The Master stopped and
quietly looked into ~aji Asad'u'llah's face. IJaji Asad'u'llah
said, "Your Honour, I pray you make me knowledgeable, or make
me rich -- otherwise, kill me. " With a smile, 'Abdu'l-Baha
responded, "Should you desire to become a man of learning, go
and study; to become rich, work diligently; and rest assured
that death will come in its own good time." These were not
the exact words of 'Abdu'l-Baha, but what in effect He meant.
Of course, Haji Asad'u'llah chose the second option, and as a
result of perseverance and hard work went later on to become
quite wealthy, never forgetting the Cause and all the while
giving very generously to it. In many instances, I was myself
witness to these kinds of supplications at the sacred
threshold.   The Master would reply with utmost patience and
during His talks would state again and again, "Unreasonable
requests should not be sought. The blessings of the Blessed
Beauty should be according to His own will. His purpose in
bearing all manner of hardship was not for material concerns."
And also other points similar to this would be made by him.
Nevertheless, most of the friends would still present
irrelevant requests.

One day the Master summoned me and ordered me to take two
men (Mirza Asad'u'llah Zayni and Mirza Aqa Sahhaf) with me
back to Tehran. I instantly accepted, went back to these
friends, communicated the message and said, "By order of the
Master, I have been given the mission of taking you back to
Tehran." They said, "But, we don't have the money." I replied,
"I don't care whether you have the money or not. I have my
order to take you to Tehran and I am ready to do so. I know my

duty." But in my heart I was unhappy, since the length of my
pilgrimage this time was of such short duration, and I would
be denied attainment of that bountiful threshold so soon.
When the two friends were ready for the journey back,
permission was once more granted to attain His presence, to
which we were summoned for His farewell and blessings. But one
of the friends again pleaded for something and this upset the
Master, who said in exasperation, "O Shaykh, excuse us." and
then said, "God be with you," and thus left the room.

This incident upset me terribly, disturbed as I was over
this cause of annoyance to the Master. At that time, Shoghi
Effendi was but a child, yet bright and advanced for his age,
and infinitely loved by 'Abdu'l-Baha. To him I then turned,
since in my mind I knew he was different from other members of
the Holy Family. His behaviour was so special that it was
incomparable with that of others. Through the child, I sent a
message to the Master's presence to this effect, " Your
Excellency, to dismiss us like this -- in such a state, we
cannot even make it to the ship, let alone Tehran. What indeed
is the short coming of these believers? After all, had I been
informed beforehand of their plea I would have prevented them
(from asking)."

Shoghi Effendi had related this exact message to 'Abdu'l-
Baha. Scarcely a few moments had passed when 'Abdu' 1-Baha
entered the room again and presented me with a handkerchief
full of crystal sugar (nabat) and displayed great affection,
embraced each of us and again reiterated, "Take them to
Tehran." I obeyed, and after expressing deference to Him, left
Haifa and embarked for Istanbul.

I recommended that, to save on expenses, we cook our own
meals, that we share in the preparation, eating and clean-up,
which of course they accepted.      In Istanbul, I received a
telegram, and as a result had to go to Vienna. So I purchased
tickets for the friends to Badkubih, and sent them off. I
asked them to wait for me in Badkubih so we could return to
Tehran together. Thus they left for Badkubih and I for Vienna.
After finishing my business in Vienna, I set out for Badkubih,
found the friends, and was-overjoyed to see them again. We
were about to leave for Tehran, when Mirza Aqa Sahhaf said he
wished to go to 'Ishqabad.        Despite my objections that
'Abdu' 1-Baha had ordered us to go to Tehran, I failed to
pursuade him otherwise. So I obtained for him a ticket to
'Ishqabad, and gave him the means to meet his expenses for the
trip, and after saying farewell, sent him off to Ishqabad. So
~aji Asad'u'llah and I, after a few days of more visits with
the friends in Badkubih, left by ship for Anzali. Till now the
journey had gone smoothly and in good spirits, but in Rasht
the carriage we took to Tehran had far too little room. We
tried our best to make room for two seats, but this was not
possible. So the driver, seeing how we insisted on leaving,
accepted that one of us should ride next to him. Since Haji
Asad'u'llah at that time was a youthful and sturdily-built

labourer, the driver suggested he sit by him. He suddenly got
mad and, like a volcano, practically erupted and retorted, "
Why should I sit there? "    He demanded that I should go and
sit there myself. I chuckled over this unabashed outburst and
the surprising intensity of it all and said, "My friend, it
wasn't me who told you to go and sit there. The carriage
driver said so because he found you young and stronger but, by
all means, I am more than ready to give you my seat. I'll sit
by the driver myself." So, with this sort of conciliatory talk
he calmed down and realized how clear cut the whole situation
was. In fact all along the way, by ship and by train, during
our travels he always had the same accomodation as I had. He
finally accepted the reasoning behind all this and offered to
take the seat by the driver, but I insisted that along the way
we every so often trade seats. I also gave him my aba
(overcoat) so he could have a warmer and softer seat. So we
thus set out for Tehran in good spirits. In Tehran he was my
guest for a few days until I introduced him to Baqiroff to
work for him on his properties, and when he at last departed,
he was quite happy about everything.

I should also mention that Haji Asad'u'llah did take to
heart the wise admonition of ' ' Abdu' 1-Baha and with much
diligence and perseverance became quite wealthy and owned lots
of property. He was the one who tugged at 'Abdu'l-Baha's cloak
and sought wisdom, fortune, or martyrdom. The Master had
replied, "Should you desire to become a man of learning, go
and study; to become rich, work diligently; and rest assured
that death will come in its own good time."

This individual was kind and good natured and until his
last breath remained steadfast in his convictions. Frequently
he would pay me visits and would bring with him various
souvenirs from his estates. He passed away at the age of 65 to
partake of heavenly blessings as he ascended to the Abha
Kingdom.

He had a brother named Nasr'u'llah and had named me as his
guardian. Since the ~aji had no children, he willed some of
his fortune to Nasr'u'llah and a part to his wife, but most of
his wealth he gave over to the Cause.*

The Fourth Visit to 'Abdu'l-Baha

My brother, Aqa Murtida Khan, wished very much to go on
pilgrimage, and to meet 'Abdu'l-Baha. He would endlessly
express his wish for this consummate blessing. So, through

*The present author had met ~aji Asad'u'llah in his childhood. He was a
heavy set man with a sunburned face, and every time he would come to pay
my father a visit, he would bring with him a chick rooster as a gift. For
this reason I loved him very much and became quite happy whenever he'd
come, because of that chick.

Hand of the Cause, Jinab-i-Mulla 'Alf-Akbar, he sent a letter
with this request and sought permission for a visit. A Tablet
addressed to Jinab-i-Mulla 'Ali-Akbar arrived and contained
the following glad-tidings:

HE IS GOD!

0 Thou Herald of the Covenant!

Thy letter of the 19th of Muharram was received,
and from its contents signs of contentment, resolve and great
expectations were perceived. It is My desire that, from the
secret bounties of God, you will with joy and happiness sing
a new song and raise a wondrous melody.

Should letters such as yours convey happiness
when they are read, the breezes of happiness will waft aloft;
and should traces of sorrow be imparted, these too, leave a
strong impact.

Praise be to God 1 By the grace of the Abha
Kingdom, certain persons will listen to your words, and this
will continue into the future. I am hopeful that through the
blessings of the Creator they might rend asunder the veils,
and disperse the clouds. Each of those blessed individuals,
who make their homes the nests for divine birds (spiritual
friends) and a place for the radiation of proofs of the divine
Revelation (referring to feasts and firesides) are dear to
Abdu'l-Baha, and are glorious in the Abha Kingdom. By God!
These have arisen with the utmost strength to serve, They show
forth every endeavour and, with heart and soul, strive to
cause the blind to see, to quicken those who are as dead and
to turn the stranger into a friend.

I cherish the hope that these individuals are those
souls whom the Blessed Beauty had promised to 'Abdu'l-Baha
from His pure 1 ips      may My soul be a sacrifice to His
friends-- to raise up. Of course, all the dear friends who
follow their example and initiate similar endeavours, become
each a source of results, illumination and a mine of
mysteries.

Convey Abha greetings to Jinab-i-Aziz'u'llah Khan,
the Tailor and to Jinab-i-Aziz'u'llah Khan, the teacher at
Tarbiyat school, on my behalf. Both are dear, renowned and
close companions at the Treshhold of the Almighty.

Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Jalal and Jinab-i-Mirza Haji Aqa
are, in reality, each like unto the Hoopoe of Sheba, conveying
the message of the Solomon of fidelity to lands and countries
abroad, spreading the sweet savours (teaching) and erstwhile
reciting the verses and explaining the hidden meaning of the

words of God with heart and soul.

I beseech God to endow each of these honourable
gentlemen with power to shake the pillars of the East and
West, and that people will be moved by these two illumined
souls.

Moreover, may Jinab-i-Mirza Abdu'l-Husayn in the
land of Alif -- be assisted by a thousand angels! Jinab-i-
Akhavan Safa will soon be sent on a mission to Mazindaran.
Jinab-i-Yusuf Khan's trip was quite proper. My hope is that by
the bounty of God, Hadrat-i-Malik Ara will obtain the beauty
of the realm above·. ·It is my wish that both material and
spiritual affairs will be set in order.

Upon you rest the Glory of the All-Glorious!
~Abdu'l-Baha Abbas

It was the beginning of the constitutional Reform. In
those troubled days of revolution, the Mujahadin (Communists)
were heading for Tehran from the north, and we were ourselves
traveling north, to meet the beloved Master. In the course of
our journey, we witnessed clashes between government troops
and the Mujahadin. We also saw heavy casualties and war dead
piled up on carriages and corpses, transported here and there
with blood dripping off each of the body wagons. All along the
way we heard the boom of cannons and heavy rifle fire. Every
so often a bullet would zip past our carriage and would
instill in us anxiety, fear and dread.

It was so fearful, that my brother urged us to go back,
but I would not give in. We kept on course towards the Beloved
of the Worlds. Government troops would not harass us. But as
soon as the Mujahadin appeared, they would detain and
interrogate us. Even when they conceded to our innocence, they
would try to coerce us to join ranks with them and their
cause, insisting that we fight for our rights and the rights
of our fellow countrymen. At any rate, as soon as we would
free ourselves with great difficulty from one group, we would
be encountered and detained by another. On one occasion they
took us for weal thy landowners trying to escape, and they
determined to execute us by firing squad. As they were
preparing to do so, one of their leaders, who had known me
beforehand, at once came to our rescue and prevented the
execution. With utter surprise, he asked why would I ever
undertake such a trip under such precarious circumstances. He
knew that I was a Baha'i but he tried to persuade us to join
their ranks and do something to save ourselves and our
comrades. The time was short and we should scarcely miss this

opportunity otherwise we would regret it. At last I convinced
him our principals would not permit us to wage war and that we
were averse towards political strife of any kind. So he let us
go and said, "At least, pray for our cause." I assured him
that since they were fighting for noble and worthy goals, they
would prevail. Also I gave him some tea and sugar and he
ordered an escort to give us safe passage through the danger
zone. After travelling the distance and enduring countless
calamities and dangers which I will not recount for the sake
of brevity, we arrived in the Holy Land along with a number of
friends from different cities and countries. Along the way on
this trip, joining our group were Mirza Tariz'u'llah Samandari
and Mirza 'Ali' Akbar Rafsanjani. As we attained the Blessed
Presence, His Excellency displayed infinite kindness towards
each of the friends. 'Abdu'l-Baha was enquiring about services
to the Faith among the friends in Tehran. Some present were
responding with their own reports as to the situation there.
The Master would likewise admonish the friends by stressing
that each one should strive to render service both in
spiritual and material affairs. The friends should take an
active interest in all fields in order to truly progress.

These addresses encouraged Mirza Taraz'u'llah Samandari
to make mention in His presence of some of the services
rendered by certain of the Baha'is. He also made reference to
one particular Baha'i-an honest man -- who was quite well-
known and formerly a man of weal th, who had recently gone
bankrupt and asked for blessings from the Master.

The Master suddenly raised his head high and with a loud
voice said, "We should never interfere with God's work." He
then gave a long discourse and the jist of it was this,
"Blessings should be the result of God's will and should not
be sought (by asking)". These are not the exact words of His
blessed statements, but covers the meaning of His utterances
which, after 40 years, still echoes in my ears. I was witness
to many of these kinds of meetings. This was especially so in
the instance of Haji Asad'u'llah's request. Thereafter I would
advise close friends of this experience and though I myself
had something in my heart to express, I would never voice it,
persuaded as I was, that blessings should descend from the
will of God and not by means of supplication, as pleading is
forbidden.

Seeking Permission for My Brother to get Married

My brother Aqa Murtida was young and single and very much
open to marriage with a Westerner. He would persist in
expressing this wish, and all the while I would oppose it I
would argue that now is not the right time for Eastern friends
to embrace Westerners, for their lifestyle and manners are so
very different from ours especially if they are not Baha'is
and abide by different moral standards. Generally speaking,

> Westerners regard us as lower and consider themselves as
> superior to us. Besides which, even should they deign to enter
> into marriage with us,       living in so inhospitable an
> environment as Tehran is difficult, if not impossible for a
foreigner.

But my brother remained unconvinced by this and persisted
> in his intentions. He had not yet had a chance to see Europe,
> nor was he aware of their manners nor of the European outlook.

Since he was so insistent, I decided one day to approach
'Abdu'l-Baha to seek permission for such a marriage. When one

The Fifth Visit to 'Abdu'l-Baha

Every two or three years I was obligated to go to Europe
for business purposes. Usually for each trip I would seek
permission to visit and attain the presence of the Master, and
there revive and refresh my spirit. The beloved Master was
renowned for His kindness towards the friends, and would never
deny me this bounty. This was especially true on previous
visits when He would say, "You have leave to visit whenever
you wish." On this trip, His blessings were more abundant than

ever, and He was bestowing such kindness on me that it was
difficult to handle, and I was ever beseeching God to protect
me from tests afterwards. The most significant honour I
experienced during this visit was, when one day He summoned
me to meet with Him, and to come alone. As I attained His
presence, I saw that an Englishman, arrayed in Ottoman attire
with a red finnih on his head*, was standing before the
beloved Master. 'Abdu'l-Baha then said, "Today, we will go out
together." In 'Abdu'l-Bah''s carriage, he introduced the
British gentleman in the following way (of course these may
not be his exact words but the essence of them was this),
"This is Dr. Esslemont from England. Previously, he had been
of Jewish persuasion, but now has declared, and become a
Baha'i. He is currently writing a history of the Faith."
There were many other points which I cannot now recall. I do
not know whether or not this Englishman understood what
Abdu'l-Baha was saying in Persian, but what was interesting to
me was his profound humility and respectfulness in 'Abdu'l-
Baha's presence. He always had his hand upon his chest and was
paying utmost attention to 'Abdu'l-Baha's every word.

As the carriage reached the summit of Mount Carmel,
'Abdu'l-Baha ordered the carriage to stop. As he stepped out,
he faced the sea, swept his hands across the lands on the
slopes below, and said, "The Baha'i friends should endeavour
to purchase these sacred places as soon as possible, since
these would soon fall into the hands of the people of Israel,
after which this land would both be expensive and difficult to
secure. Encourage the friends -- encourage all of them to make
efforts to purchase these properties. It should not be an
individual effort, but rather a collective enterprise." He
then continued, "Haifa will become foremost among the ports
of the world, will develop extensively and in time will fall
under control of the Jewish people."**

'Abdu'l-Baha covered many other points of interest which
I had at the time recorded in a notebook, but I'm sorry to say
that I lost these notes. What is recounted here is the gist of
what he said and represents a fraction of all the important
statements I myself had heard. For years I had intended to
write the story of all my travels and visits to the presence
of 'Abdu'l Baha, and to weave these into an autobiographical
narrative.

For the same reason I made some record of 'Abdu'l-Baha's
statements as I recalled them, but as I was struck by the

*Prior to and after World War 1, under Ottoman rule, Egyptians would wear
a red finnih with a black mangulih (red cap with black tassel)

*Some 50 years later, the present writer attained the presence of Shoghi
Effendi. One day, he asked,     "What had 'Abdu' 1-Baha told your father
concerning Israel?" I recounted the episode above whereupon he asked,
"Had the government also been mentioned?" I said yes.)

greatness of the Faith and my own comparative insignificance,
I washed away what was written from the notebook, no doubt
with some of my own tears in the process. I started to believe
that memoirs of this kind, not to mention my own, should not
remain alongside all His authenticated statements. But Mr.
Fa' iz, since you insist that such a record is in fact a
priceless inheritance to pass on to my children, I'll do my
utmost to search in the inner reaches of my memory to recount
just a few out of a thousand events that transpired. I might
be mistaken in a few of my dates so please pay attention to
the main points and not so much to the dates. Now after 40
years, I am witnessing many of 'Abdu'l-Baha's statements and
warnings come true, one taking place after another. A prime
example is the coming into being of the State of Israel, along
with all the press you read in the papers today.*

As we returned from this audience with 'Abdu'l-Baha, I
asked about Dr. Esslemont from Dr. Lotfullah Khan Hakim, who
was a fellow pilgrim, and so my information about Dr.
Esslemont was verified. I learned he was a medical doctor of
Jewish ancestry. He had resigned from his occupation and was
living in 'Abdu'l-Baha's presence while compiling notes for a
book to be entitled, Baha'u'llah and the New Era. What he had
written was translated into Persian by Dr. Hakim and another
individual whose name escapes me, and was then presented to
'Abdu'l-Baha for approval or additions.    Upon return of the
text to Dr. Ess lemont, he would assiduously labour on the
necessary revisions until at last there emerged a document
that was presented to the world as Baha'u'llah and the New
Era.    What was most interesting about this respected and
knowledgeable individual was his profound sense of humility
before 'Abdu'l-Baha. It was customary among us Persians, to
remove our shoes when attaining the presence of the Master and
he would do likewise he also observed the practice of Ziyarat
(observance of pilgrimage) much better than Easterners.     He
was always crossing his arms over his chest before the Master,
and would not seat himself until given leave to do so.

One day the Master enquired about the feasts and Baha'i
gatherings in Iran. I stated that in those days it was
customary to serve a complete meal after each feast. The
reason was that the friends were few in number, so they would
eat supper or dinner following meetings and disperse
afterwards.   Those friends who had come from some distance
would stay over night for reasons of safety, and would return
home the next morning after breakfast. Since there were many
such gatherings in my home, my mother would work hard to
prepare for hospitality and would serve the friends with love
and utmost kindness.    On that day, since 'Abdu' 1-Baha had
asked about the feasts, I made mention of my mother and her
sacrifices. I said that, though not a believer, she served

to Israel and the formation of their government there.)

with all her heart to the end of her life and has now ascended
to the Abha Kingdom. As I was relating all these things, I was
overcome by emotion and as I thought of my mother I became
choked up with a sense of sadness and was holding back the
tears. In that wistful state I sought from His Presence
forgiveness on my mothers behalf. Right away, the Master asked
for pen and paper and revealed a special Tablet, as mentioned
before.

> Pilgrimage to Bahji in the Company of Shoghi Effendi,
> on Behalf of 'Abdu'l-Baha

One night, the blessed Master was pacing back and forth
in the room while giving a talk.    As He finished, He turned
His blessed face towards me and said, "Jinab-i-Khan, tomorrow
you and Shoghi Effendi shall pay a visit to the Most Holy
Shrine on my behalf." At once, I bowed and replied,    "As you
wish." Jinab-i-Mirza Azfz'u'llah fillan Varqa who was standing
beside me immediately spoke up, saying,      "I, too, wish to
share that honour and go as well." I interceded before the
Master and stated, "Jinab, the son of Varqa requests to have
this honour al so." The Master responded,     "Very well, very
well. My two Aziz's proceed together. A Syrian doctor, who was
also present was granted permission to go as well. The next
day, food was sent to us and in the company of Shoghi Effendi,
who was barely 14 or 15 years of age, we set out for the Most
Holy Shrine in 'Abdu'l-Baha's carriage. After the visit to the
Shrine of Baha'u'llah, the Baha'i friends took some time to
relax and a few of them started picking oranges from trees
nearby. I noticed that Shoghi Effendi was preparing food and
was about to wash the utensils. At once I approached him and
said,   "Your Honour, why do you take the trouble to do this
work? " And I took the dishes from his hands. He said,     "It
doesn't matter, really." In any case I besought him to permit
me to take over, which at last he did. At that time, no one
was aware of the future station of Shoghi Effendi and people
simply considered him a member of the Holy Family, and did not
consider him unique or superior. But I had observed for some
time, ever since he was a child, that there was something
special about him. Whenever he would enter the room, for
instance, Jinab-i-Hajf Mirza Haydar- 'Alf      - that elderly,
extremely spirituai man - wouid always stand-up, which he
would not do for others. I would always think to myself about
this, and would wonder why this wise old man would show such
respect for a child.

But on that blessed day when we were returning from our
pilgrimage to the Shrine, I knew inwardly what this individual
had a much higher station than we at the time had thought.
Jinab-i-~ajf Mirza ~aydar-'Alf was right. Perhaps the purpose
of 'Abdu'l-Baha in arranging this pilgrimage was to give us
this awareness.

At my insistence, we picked some oranges for the Holy
Household and then set out in the blessed carriage for our
return to Haifa. Along the way, Shoghi Effendi would ask each
of us questions.      He would then listen with the utmost
attentiveness to our answers. Then he asked,      "Recount the
most historic event that has ever happened to you."        The
visionary wisdom of these kinds of questions from the future
Guardian parted the veils before my eyes. And thus I saw his
greatness more than ever before. I could appreciate that the
profound respect shown by Mirza Haydar-'Ali had a sound basis.
Indeed, Shoghi Effendi was a · superior member among the
household of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Baha.

After our return, we attended the feast held in 'Abdu'l-
Baha' s home and we were in His presence. There were many
guests. When 'Abdu'l-Baha ended His address He asked me, "Did
you undertake the pilgrimage?" He then gave me a lengthy
explanation regarding this, and asked,     "What did you bring
with you?" I replied, "Oranges." He then ordered the oranges
be brought and He gave each one present an orange by His own
blessed hand. He began with me, and at the very last gave me
another one. With a smile, he said,     "I know you should get
two ••• "

His blessings had enveloped me and His bounty was ever
pouring forth, to the extent that I could scarcely recognize
my own person in such a state of joy. I begged God to somehow
make me worthy of all these blessings. But what could possibly
be done ? Sometimes His kindness is bestowed on individuals
without their deserving it.
Baha'i friends who attained the Blessed Presence would try to
take a picture with 'Abdu'l-Baha. Such permission was sought
from Him and He consented that a picture be taken in front of
the Blessed House. How dismayed I was, whenever I realized
that very soon I would have to be dismissed and thus would be
deprived of the experience of hearing Him with my own ears.
After a while, every one was dismissed, and each went His own
way. At times, small groups would travel together and enjoy
each others company along the way, recalling their experiences
with 'Abdu'l-Baha.

Visiting 'Abdu'l-Baha in London

Two or three years prior to World War I, I was in Europe
taking care of some business.    Dr. Lotfullah fil:!an Hakim who
was also in Europe, had learned that 'Abdu'l-Baha was about to
come to Europe and he shared this news with me.      Since I had
to travel to various cities in England, I asked him to let me
know of His arrival the moment He would reach London. This he
did, and one day I received a letter from him giving me the
good news of 'Abdu'l-Baha's arrival in London and His stay at
Lady Blomf ields' s residence.    I immediately entrusted my
business affairs to an assistant and departed for London.

Jinab-i-Az{z{, wearing a Persian hat in London

I had on a clean black suit and wore a Persian hat made
of Bukhara lamb's wool. I was tidy in appearance and made sure
I was~he epitome of neatness and cleanliness. With a happy
smile I set out for Lady Blomfields's residence. As soon as
I arrived, I introduced myself to the butler and requested to
be admitted into 'Abdu' 1-Baha' s presence. The time spent
waiting for this permission seemed like an eternity and was
difficult to endure. Thank God, the butler came back with the
welcome news of this permission.

He opened the door for me, and suddenly I observed that
the blessed Master was seated in the centre of the third room

(there were two other rooms filled with guests). The doors to
this room were open so that all present could hear His blessed
voice. As I glimpsed at His blessed face, I threw myself to
the floor and paid my respects. The Master, with a loud voice,
bade me enter. As I reached the threshold of the second room,
again I prostrated myself and again with a loud voice He bade
me enter. He said, "Come in! Welcome, Jinab-i-Khan." And thus
ordered me to enter the room where he was seated by saying,
"In God's name, Jinab-i-Khan. He then gestured with his hand
the seat I should take.-ifter I seated myself close to the
blessed Master and settled down, I came to realize how crowded
all three rooms were with guests. At first I was so excited
over seeing the Master that I had taken no notice. The Master
greeted me, asked me how I was, then with a booming voice
declared,   "This individual is Persian with a Persian hat. He
has come to visit us. He has not lost his Persian identity,
has not forgotten that he is Iranian, and what indeed is wrong
with this? What shame is there in this? Could anything be more
ideal than this? Not only is there nothing wrong with this,
but nothing in fact could be better."       He then turned His
blessed face towards me and addressed me thus, "Jinab-i-Khan,
find a Persian hat for Tamaddun. I am not pleased th.;:£ my
interpreter should wear a western hat. " I bowed and said I
would obey.     'Abdu' 1-Baha' s interpreter at this time was
Tamaddun'ul-Mulk, who was wearing a European hat.

At the end of the Master's address, when feeling quite
content, I realized I was sitting next to Mon.Dreyfus.
Quietly we greeted each other and exchanged courtesies. Among
the friends who were seated in the room with the Master were
Lady Blomfield along with her daughter, Miss Laura Clifford
Barney, and Lua Getsinger. Also seated were: Mirza Muhammad
Baqir Khan Shirazi (father of the Dehqan family), Tamaddun' ul-
Mulk, as well as Mon. Dreyfus -- and beyond these I cannot
recall any other names. There was also a German Lady present,
who Mon. Dreyfus introduced to the Master saying that she was
a famous singer, who wished to perform in His presence to win
His approval. The Master consented and that woman began to
sing a son in German in a most beautiful voice. The Master
enjoyed it very much and praised her for her performance.

> Obtaining a Persian Hat in London
> for Tamaddun'ul-Mulk, the Master's Interpreter

The wish of the Master was that Tamaddun'ul-Mulk should
wear a Persian hat. At first I had him try on a hat of my own,
but it was too large for him and there was no way to alter it
either. So I began looking for a hat for him in London.
Whoever I asked about where to find a Persian hat would laugh
and make fun of me. They would say,    "How could you possibly
find a Persian hat in London?" But since the seeker is also a
finder, and in as much as it was the wish of the Master, I was
certain that it should not be impossible to locate such a hat,
if only I tried hard enough. So I came upon an exhibition,
which had a booth from Iran.      There were some samples of
Persian wear there, including some hats, one of which was a
Nahuti hat. Though it was not for sale, after trying my best
I succeeded in purchasing it and then tried it on Tamuddun'ul-
Mulk.   It was a bit large and he was not prepared to accept
it.   I lined some paper inside the hat until it fitted. He
kept on complaining and still would not accept it. I got upset
and forced the hat on his head, snatched his European hat away
from him and said,   "It is the Master's will that you should
wear a Persian hat. So that's that and so shut up! Do you
think we are in the habedashery section of the bazaar in
Tehran that you think you can be so choosy? This is the only
such hat in London, which I obtained by accident and with
great difficulty. You should know, that were it not for the
will of the Master that you should wear a Persian hat, this
very hat would never have ended up in London. It is in fact
a miracle to chance upon any Persian hat in London, so why do
you complain?" When Tamaddun began to realize that he was
dealing with a person who under no circumstances would
overlook his Master's order, he gave in as he had no other
choice. Tamaddun kept asking and insisting that I fit one of
my own hats which were made of Bukhara lamb's wool, since it
would be elegantly pleasing to the eye. I wanted to do so but
lacked the instruments for it.     At any rate with a lot of
pressure and threats, I put the hat on his head, took him by
the hand and led him back to the Master's presence. The Master
smiled and praised the hat greatly and said,    "What is wrong
with the hat, that you should wish to make yourself look like
Europeans?"

How Tamaddun'ul-Mulk's Conduct displeased 'Abdu'l-Baha

I have visited 'Abdu'l-Baha on many occasions and was
abundantly blessed. Most of the people in His company and at
His service showed a certain respect for me and were all quite
considerate, especially since I would do whatever I could to
be of service to them. Though I was ready and willing to make
some sacrifices for each and every one of the friends, yet

those who were in the service of 'Abdu'l-Baha had a special
place in my heart. Among them was Tamaddun'ul-Mulk, who was
the most outgoing of them all. However, I would at times
notice that certain of his actions were morally questionable
and not to the liking of 'Abdu'l-Baha. I would bring this up
in private to Tamaddun and would ask him, "Why are you doing
this? Why do you hurt 'Abdu'l-Baha?" Every time I would bring
this up, he would prove himself innocent but I would make him
promise not to persist in this behaviour.     As a result, he
would make an insincere promise to not do anything which might
displease 'Abdu' 1-Baha. What was in fact distressing the
Master mostly were the inaccurate translations he would give,
so that I would repeatedly hear from Abdu'l-Baha           His
admonition,   "Translate exactly what I say, neither more nor
1 ess. "

One day in London, 'Abdu' 1-Baha summoned me to His
presence, to which I obeyed right away. We then went for
sightseeing in a long car, in the company of several English
ladies. After He seated Himself in the car, He ordered me
along with Tamaddun to get in the car and take our seats in
front. The ladies were sitting right by Him or right in front
of Him. The Master beckoned to Tamaddun,       " Translate My
statements for the ladies " with special emphasis on       "My
statements." 'Abdu'l-Baha started to talk and I was enjoying
what He had to say. Since I did not know English, I was
watching 'Abdu'l-Baha closely. I was very much moved by His
remarks and was all the time looking at Him. But it seemed
that either the translation was bad or something was added
that provoked     'Abdu'l-Baha,  so that He said angrily,
"Translate exactly as I say." The Master then sat back and
said nothing further. At the time, I was sitting behind
Tamaddun, nudging, pushing, and even pinching him from time to
time, saying, "Why do you provoke The Master so? Why do cause
him such irritation? What did you just promise me?"

But nothing would swerve him and he persisted in this
kind of behaviour, to the extent that 'Abdu'l-Baha at last
dispatched a telegram to the Baha'i world, stating, "Tamaddun
is uncivilized " (in contrast to his name, Tamaddun meaning

" civilization") and "      is (spiritually) moribund."   One
day, towards the end of his life, I caught sight of him in
Tehran. He was very downcast, filled with remorse, and would
express profound regret. But, alas, the time has past, and
there was no way to make up for the past mistakes.

'Abdu'l-Baha teaches in the Churches of London

The day fol lowing the sight-seeing excursion in the
company of 'Abdu'l-Baha, I was again in His presence. The
conversation turned to Mon. Dreyfus and his encounter with a
certain Christian priest. The priest had in fact invited
'Abdu'l-Baha to visit his church and to address the

congregation. This opportunity prompted me to beg Mon. Dreyfus
to seek 'Abdu' 1-Baha' s permission for me to be among the
Master's retinue when these kinds of meetings would take place
my primary purpose in coming to London was to be in His
company and I was free of other obligations. Mon. Dreyfus did
ask on my behalf and permission was thus given. One Sunday
afternoon, the blessed Master made his way to the City Temple
Church.   Excluding Westerners, four Persians in addition to
myself accompanied the Master: Jinab-i-Mirza Lotfullah Hakim,
Tamaddun' ul-Mulk Mirza Muhammad-Baqir Khan Shirazi, 'Aqa Mirza
Mahmud Zarqani. When the Master entered the church, the
congregation was engaged in prayer and a group of girls were
singing chorals in f rant of the sanctuary. The ministers were
either seated or standing, relative to their respective ranks
as they were want to do. The Master, with His dignified
presence, coupled with an attitude of respect, entered the
church, ascended the stairway to the stage in front, and took
his seat in full centre view. The priest came forward and
welcomed Him and after certain formalities introduced 'Abdu'l-
Baha to the audience. Dr. Lotfullah fillan Hakim - who was an
old friend of mine and was standing by me at the time - was
interpreting the priests statements to me. From what I recall
of that occasion, what the priest had said was this, "It is my
honour to present to you our guest speaker. His name is

'Abdu'l-Baha, the son of Baha'u'llah. He has suffered
imprisonment for over 40 years. He holds special beliefs. His
teachings and indeed all of His addresses are akin to those of
our Lord Jesus Christ, and are all in the Persian language.
Till   now He has been promulgating His Faith through
correspondence mainly, and this is the first time He is
delivering a public address freely. It is indeed unique and
unprecedented that someone could achieve such widespread
influence through pen and paper. He will give His address in
Persian, then it will be interpreted for you."      Thereupon,
the blessed Master gave his address, which began with words
such as "Oh respected members of the congregation. Oh seekers
in the path of God. Verily, this day is unique and this
century glorious. Soon will the world be transformed into a
heavenly realm, and the unity of mankind will shine forth from
every horizon."    As His address continued, it was so very
moving and powerful that all of us Persians were trembling and
wrapt in absolute silence. Not a sound from anyone was heard.
After the address was over, the Master raised up His hands and
began chanting a prayer in Persian. By this time the entire
congregation was standing, utterly attracted by His address
and the prayer that fol lowed. After the translation was
completed, the minister again expressed gratitude to 'Abdu'l-
Baha.

It was the Master's intention to leave as He descended
from the pulpit stage, but the congregation thronged around
Him to meet Him and show their respect ( literally kiss His
hands). Mon. Dreyfus, who was aware of what was going on,

signalled to us Persians who were standing in front of the
stage to hold back the crowd to prevent them from disturbing
the Master, as He could not possibly shake hands and greet
every one of them. Since it would have resulted in some
hardship for Him, we took hold of one anothers hands to form
a chain to fence off the crowd. So the Master retired to the
church library to rest for a while. The head priest brought a
large and weighty book to 'Abdu'l-Baha and requested He write
in it. The Master accepted and inscribed a few lines in
Persian, then instructed Mon. Dreyfus to translate it. Mon.
Dreyfus was conversant with the Persian language. As he
himself stated, he had studied under 'Ayn'u'l-Mulk, the son of
'Aqa Muhammad Riday-i-Qannad.

One of the wealthy English ladies named Miss Cooper owned
an elegant car, which was given to the Master during His
sojourn in London. When the Master emerged from the library
with an air of utmost dignity and majesty, together with the
impression created by His mane of white locks flowing onto His
white wool robe, He seemed to strike in the eyes of those
around an image of someone like His Holiness Christ. As the
car started to move slowly away, everyone began to wave their
handkerchiefs and hands, expressing their gratitude and sense
of upliftment. This left a picture in my memory which was
unforgettable.

> 'Abdu'l-Baha's Tour in London and His encounter with an
> East Indian

It is beyond capacity to attempt to recount in every
detail the events which then transpired, as more than 30 years
have past since. A few outstanding events remain in memory,
which I will mention briefly: One day, the blessed Master went
to a park in the heart of London. An exposition was being held
there at the time. At the insistence of several British Baha'i
ladies, 'Abdu'l-Baha consented to come, which He did in Miss
Cooper's car.    I was also in His company. The Master praised
the floral garden and landscaplng of the park very much. He
said, " Scenery such as this serves to heighten the spiritual
mood in man, i f he is perceptive -- especially in the secluded
spots where the individual is free to be alone." As the
blessed Master became somewhat tired, one of the ladies
present urged him to enter a restaurant to take a rest. As the
Master entered, a hush fell over all who were present and no
sound was to be heard, not even from fork and knife. But there
was no place for Him to sit. The Master then proceeded to the
upper part of the hall. At that moment, some Britons at once
left their table and waiters immediately cleared the table and
set it, so that it was ready and awaiting the Master when He
reached it.

At whatever gathering 'Abdu'l-Baha would speak, He would
impart the teachings of Baha'u'llah and His admonitions to the

peoples of the world, laying the foundation for universal
peace and love of mankind. Speaking to each occasion, He would
deliver talks which were pleasing to the heart and of benefit
to the audience at hand. Among various visitors one day was an
East Indian Maharaja. He was drawn so totally to the Master's
discourses that he would come over to wherever the Master
spoke. The Maharaja had his attachments to his own Indian ways
and customs, but at the same time had a great liking for the
Baha'i Faith. So he desired to have them both. One day, he
besought 'Abdu'l-Baha to forbid the eating of meat. In support
of his request, he cited his reasons and spoke at length in
an effort to be persuasive. But the Master gave no answer nor
acknowledgement. On another occasion, the Master stated, "We
really cannot give such instruction." On yet another occasion,
this Indian man -- whose name, I believe, was Raj Butana --
had invited the Master for dinner in Mr. Sadly's home. All the
companions of the Master were present. The discourse that
evening concerned prejudice. 'Abdu'l-Baha said words such as
these " Prejudice is the cause of the ruin of a people. It is
as a result of prejudice, that blood is shed. It is due to
prejudice that factions and nations are locked in reciprocal
hatred. Were prejudice alone to vanish, the world would become
a veritable paradise, souls would create a garden of Ridvan,
and hearts would mirror forth the highest heaven." The guests
were then invited to a large room with many kinds of foods on
display.    All those various entrees and delicacies were
entirely of vegetables, as the host and most of the guests
were vegetarian. After dinner, Mr. Sadly gave a speech and
praised 'Abdu'l-Baha as "Master of the East and Messenger of
Peace."   Others   among   the  guests   themselves   expressed
appreciation and praise for the teachings of Baha 'u' l lah.
Towards the end of the evening, the Indian gentleman insisted
once again that the eating of meat be forbidden. In response,
the Master replied, "Of course, i f man could indeed be content
with a vegetarian diet, it is better. But as the consumption
of meat is so engrained an eating habit, it is not realistic
to expect people to stop." He then related the fol lowing
story, "Once in Baghdad, I met a man from India. He insisted
vigorously that men should desist from eating meat. He was,
moreover,very compassionate towards all living creatures. He
would maintain it is most unjust to kill in order to feed
ourselves, and would give numerous examples. So I told him,

'You yourself are eating a multitude of animals.' He replied,
"Not at all." I asked, 'Do you drink water?" He said, 'Yes' '
Do you eat cheese and yogourt? The Indian said yes. I said,
"Put them under a microscope to observe how many animals are
in those substances. How many animals do you kill when you
simply boil water.' He, replied, "But these animal are tiny."
I said, "All animals feel pain whether large or small." The
Indian man grew silent and began to ponder over all this, and
later his thought~ became clear and love welled up within him.
As the Master was about to depart, according to Indian custom

the man prepared a garland of lovely flowers. He was hoping to
place it around 'Abdu' l Baha' s neck. The Master quietly
instructed me to prevent him from doing so. So I advanced
towards the Indian and with utmost courtesy and tact, without
creating the least offence, convinced him that this wreath of
flowers might cause irritation to the Master's neck, and
surely he would not wish this to happen. So I accepted to take
the garland and, to satisfy him, consented to place it about
His feet in the train. On the train one room was reserved for
'Abdu'l-Baha and another one for His companions. The Indian
gentleman was most pleased and happy that his flowers were to
be placed at last on the Master's feet. Such was the crowd at
the station that the atmosphere of joy and excitement was
beyond belief. The train began to move and all those present
at the station for sometime continued waving farewell with
laughter and happiness.

Portrait Taken of the Master in London

News of 'Abdu' 1-Baha' s arrival spread far and wide,
especially following the talks he had given in many of the
churches in London. News stories about the Master were
published and journalists rushed to get further news and
photographs as well. At first the Master would not accept any
picture to be taken, until one of the journalists succeeded in
snapping a photo from behind. That picture subsequently
appeared in the papers and caught 'Abdu'l-Baha's attention,
and from that point on he never attempted to prevent any
further pictures from being taken. In London one day he
instructed me to arrange a session with a professional
photographer. I complied at once and called upon one of the
most widely-acclaimed photographers around.*
The Photographer took a few portraits of the Master and I
presented the proofs to him. He instructed me to voice freely
my preference and asked, "Which one is better, in your
judgement?" I replied, "Your Honour, all are blessed -- each
one of them is worthy." So He chose two of them which were
clearer and sharper for publication, then autographed a few
and blessed me with keeping them.**

A Persian Who was Pretending to be British

Various accounts of events during the Master's stay in
London are quite detailed and of course are fully narrated in

*LafaYette, Ltd •• Photographers to the King and Queen ---
London,Dublin, Glasgow, Manchester and Belfast.
**Those pictures were in the possession of the present writer after the
passing of my father, and then distributed among my brothers and sisters.

a number of books. I merely make mention of certain incidents
which stand out in my memory.

In any gathering 'Abdu'l-Baha addressed, unprecedented
joy and happiness beyond description would sweep through those
present. One such episode was this: One night the Master gave
a talk before a large crowd from various walks of life and at
the end of the talk people rushed forward to meet Him and to
kiss His hand. No matter how hard the Master's companions
tried to hold them back, it was to no avail. So the members of
the audience were permitted to approach the Master, on the
condition that they did not engage in shaking hands. So one by
one they came forward, and each in turn said good-night. Some
would bow out of respect, others would take gently hold of His
hand before leaving the church hallway, which was not very
lightly lit •• We then realized the Master was clasping
someone's hand in His own and said to him, "You are Persian --
why do you conceal that fact and say farewell in English?"

This astonished those present, who observed all this with
some amazement. Everyone was asking each other who this man
was who 'Abdu'l-Baha should single out for attention inspite
of the crowd around Him and the weariness it undoubtedly
caused. How did 'Abdu'l-Baha know this individual? I inquired
at once, went to him and found out that he was from the family
of Naser'ul-Mulk and was known as Ezz'ul-Mulk Hamadani Qara-
Qazlu. He had been brought up in Europe and the amazing thing
was that his manners and the way he looked was exactly like
Britons. Even his eyes were light green and not black.
'Abdu'l-Baha had never before met him and that man himself was
taken aback. Later on, he would recount this incident to
members of high society and people of influence in Tehran. He
would say, "I was quite astonished, for 'Abdu'l-Baha had never
known me before in His life, and in such a brief encounter
under such crowded circumstances in a dimly-lit room He was
able to recognize me as Persian. Even my accent had diminished
to the extent that no one could tell I was a foreigner, as a
result of my long stay in England. Besides, I disclosed
nothing which might give me away even if I had an accent." *

Since the point he would make concerned Persians in
England at the time of 'Abdu'l-Baha's visit and their
reactions to His presence there, I will not go into any
further detail.

The Generosity of 'Abdu'l-Baha Towards British Ladies

It was the Master's practice, whether at home or abroad,
to always give presents to those around Him. He would bring

* The present writer met Mr. Ezz'ul-Mulk Hamadani in Tehran when he was
over 50 years of age. He was very refined and dignified, and he would
embellish on the story often.

happiness in a special way. To the poor, He would usually give
money. One day while He was in London, the Master summoned me
and told me, " You shouid go and obtain some ornamental
accessories. I wish to give these to the British ladies. The
things you purchase should only be necklaces, bracelets and
broaches."      He then gave a proper description of their
respective types and shapes. At length He emphasized that, "
These should not be very expensive. These people simply wish
to have something to remember me by. "           He then asked
Tamaddun to accompany me. Shopping on behalf of 'Abdu'l-Baha
should be for merchandise which was reasonably-priced and of
good quality. So I went to every store I could recall from
past visits, and to my British friends as well. At last I
succeeded in obtaining items which I felt would meet His
expectations according to His instructions. As the number of
items was quite a few, towards the end I asked for some more
discount -- in other words, I bargained as best I could.     In
any event the sales clerk accepted the offer and gave a better
discount. After all that, I asked for a commission for myself.
Of course, I had no intention of benefiting personally from
the deal. I simply wanted to do the best I could for the
Master. The sales clerk would not accept these terms at all,
saying that I had bargained exhaustively and got such a
substantial discount that there was plainly no room left for
any commission. To this I kept insisting and he kept
declining. At long last he gave in and threw in a watch as
commission. I presented all the purchased items to 'Abdu'l-
Baha. He asked about the prices. I explained in some detail
and He seemed very impressed over both price and quality, to
all of which He returned a smile of approval. He also took
special   notice   of  the watch from among        the women's
accessories. He picked up the watch and asked, " What is this?
" So I related the whole story. This made Him very happy. The
Master kept the watch in hand for some time, examined it, and
while holding it, gave a lengthy discourse concerning business
and trade. The point He would emphasize the most, was that,
"One should buy good quality at the most competitive price."

At the end of His discourse He gave the example of when
the Bab had made a purchase of honey: after such a purchase
had been made on his behalf, the Bab discovered it to be of
very poor quality and over priced as well. He then returned
the honey and said, "One should be very prudent in purchasing
goods, with the aim being to buy good quality at a cut-rate
price." At last the Master gave back the watch which He had
held in His Hands for some time and said, "You keep this" ( ie,
Aziz'u'llah). Tamaddun was present and said to Abdu'l-Baha,
"Your Honour, this watch should be mine since I served as the
translator. Otherwise, ••• " I saw a wave of sadness sweep over
the Blessed Countenance, as His expression changed. Tamaddun
would not keep quiet making his rude behaviour still worse. So
at once I kissed the watch, placed it on my eyes, and politely
handed it to Tamaddun and said: " You keep this. It will be as

if it were my very own on the condition that you keep it safe.
It is 'Abdu'l-Baha's gift to you."

This action of mine brought happiness to 'Abdu'l-Baha,
though He said nothing at the time. But in subsequent travels
together, He was increasingly friendly towards me. One day,
for instance, He gave his Finih (Egyptian-style Fez) to me,
and on another occasion he presented to me his exquisite pen-
case, as well as other blessed gifts.

'Abdu'l-Baha's Gifts to Me

It is necessary in this narrative to make reference to
the gifts bestowed by 'Abdu'l-Baha upon me.       In no way is
their mention intended as boasting, nor should it be
interpreted as showing off. These blessings in fact were not
exclusive to me. Because each one in a different way would be
favoured from His table of blessings. One day the Master took
His ring with the Greatest Name from His very finger, gave it
to me and said, "You keep this." This kindness of 'Abdu' 1-Baha
became such a source of joy for me that sometimes I would
loose my senses. The ring was for me a new-found treasure,
especially after I had determined that it had been worn by Him
for a long time -- and also because He had given it to me by
His own will and not because I asked Him.
(This Baha'i ring is with my older brother, Dr. Ezzat'u'llah-
Azizf.)

One day, after writing several Tablets, the Master gave
me a precious pen case containing pens and an inkwell all-in-
one, and said, "Keep this as a reminder." On another trip He
gave me His finih (headdress), in which there remained some of
His Blessed Locks.     On a later trip He gave me some Ottoman
coins.* Sweets, candles, oranges, and so on, were some of the
kinds of gifts the Master would usually present to me and to
the other friends, usually when we were dismissed from His
Presence. Other times He would choose to reveal a Tablet from
His pure heart and then to send it to its recipient. On
occasion He would even mention my name in Tablets to other
recipients (these Tablets appear at the beginning of this
book) .

'Abdu'l-Baha at Oxford University Faculty Club

On one of the last remaining nights of 'Abdu'l-Baha's
sojourn in England, He was invited to the Oxford Faculty Club
by certain of the British professors and scholars. It was a
breathtaking and luxurious place. In addition to the assembly

* After Jinab-i-Azizi passed away, on a particular Holy day, His widowed
wife -- after relating the story of the coins--- distributed them among
her 11 children as a gift.

of scholars and professors, there was a large number of
onlookers.   The auditorium was divided into two parts:    one
side was higher, the other lower. The Master, his companions
and the professors were seated in the higher section. 'Abdu'l-
Baha stood up and delivered a profound address. The sheer
impact on the spirit of the audience was beyond description.
It seemed just about everyone present either raised a question
or had a point to make. His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Baha gave leave
for everyone who wished to address questions, to which he
would respond.

At the close of the evening the Master made a statement
which I remember to be approximately as follows: " Tonight is
the night for saying farewell as we are about to depart from
here. Inevitably, there are those who will rise in opposition
and will write articles and essays against the Faith.    These
actions will not only prove futile, but will become the means
for creating greater awareness among people in general and
will serve as a source for further information. In Persia,
both religious as well as political leaders combined forces to
persecute the Faith. They wrote a number of books against this
Cause and made every effort to harm this Faith and destroy its
very foundation but they did not succeed.        One of these
individuals was Haji Muhammad Karim Khan. He wrote several
books, but all of them rapidly diminished in influence and are
practically forgotten. Yet the cause of God was proclaimed in
East and West, introduced as it was to the peoples of various
nations and Faiths.     Observe how, when His Holiness Jesus
appeared, the Jewish 1 ea de rs rose up against Him, even
slandering Him as Beelzebub did.    Our ears today are filled
with these same kinds of accusations. Persian Baha 'is, in
whatever village they travelled, would start to teach until a
level of general awareness of the Faith would provoke
opposition. The opponents would start to slander these
Baha 'is, yet the Baha 'is themselves would be all the more
confident that knowledge of the Faith would doubtlessly
spread. The Baha'is would say, "Should we suffer injury, or
simply be insulted by our opponents, this will cause us to
rejoice and this is our only wish and desire. What finer way
than this to become ever more humble yet ever more successful
in the path of God?      This sense of service imparts such
fulfillment as cannot be described.       When we arrived at
'Akka, we were in a state of abject misery each and every one
of us endured hardship and calamity. Yet we experienced a joy
and happiness that was far beyond description. At one time, at
least 80 of us were crowded into but a few cells of that
fortress-prison and all contracted fever to such a degree that
no one except Aqa-Rida and myself were able to move. We were
night and day engaged in tending the sick, administering
medicine, and so on.    By the way, my own room was very cold
and damp, and the floor was made of stone. This room was in
fact a morgue. Still under conditions such as these, we were
under the blessings of Baha'u'llah and were so happy that we

would consider any hardship a comfort."

At the end of the gathering of scholars and scientists in
The Faculty   Club, a portrait was taken, which will grace
these pages.* The next day, 'Abdu'l-Baha left for Paris. As
I had to stay on longer in England to tend to personal
business, I sought and obtained permission to remain. I then
made my way through various cities in England, swiftly took
care of my business and again attained the Master's Presence
in Paris.

Attaining the Presence of the Master in Paris

Upon my arrival in Paris, I went to see Mon. Dreyfus and
enquired as to 'Abdu'l-Baha -- his present condition, health,
and his address.    Mon. Dreyfus had acquired a lovely place
close to "Palais de Chaillot" on Kleber Avenue.        When I
arrived there and kissed the sacred threshold out of respect,
the Master honoured me with permission to be in His company
the whole time in Paris. 'Abdu'l-Baha was dissatisfied with
Paris and never took a liking to the city itself. On more than
one occasion He remarked, " This city is dark, and most of the
city-dwellers here are drowning in a sea of materialism. "
He would not leave His quarters very often, so that most
people would meet Him at His place of residence. It was there
that He would discourse to those present. The subjects
addressed varied according to the occasion.      Sometimes He
would speak of the United States and other times He would
refer to His trip to London. He would speak even more about
Persia and other places. Translations of some of these talks
which appeared in the newspapers of Paris would be presented
to the Master. One day a man, whose name now escapes me,
brought up the subject of government and religious leaders in
Iran working in collaboration with each other. His Holiness
'Abdu'l-Baha responded with a verse from the Qur'an; " They
are destroying their house with their own hands." In Paris
various individuals would attain the Presence of The Master.
Some Persians, some Europeans, and some from a number of
different countries until one day even a group of Russians
came. Persians residing in Europe at that time were mainly
from the upper class and nobility.       They would seek His
Presence, express their concerns, and would come away, having
heard answers which satisfied them very much. One day, one
very wealthy Persian named Dr. Isa Raffi, a dentist by
profession but engaged in the antique trade, came to see the
Master. I knew him well, as he was Jewish, but ever since his
marriage to a French woman, he had changed his own habits and

beliefs. He followed the materialist school of thought. And he
would go on and on about philosophical materialism, and would
insist that God did not exist -- that the universe was the
product of natural forces, etc; but the Master would not
respond. One day, however, 'Abdu'l-Baha stated with a wry
smile, "European professors, for certain reasons, incline
towards materialism. When we discourse with them, we simply
point out to them fallacies in their assumptions, and they
take this to heart and depart. But Persians just make false
pretences and put forward positions they themselves do not
even comprehend. They have no purpose, in short, and as such
cannot be swerved either. "

In Paris, as time passed, Persian nobility, especially
Qajar princes and high-ranking court officials, as well as
Turkish Pashas, (even those who opposed the Faith vigorously)
would come to pay their respect. They usually travelled in
groups. When in the Presence of the Master, they would show
profound humility and respect towards the Master, and would be
dismissed after listening to his wondrous discourses. I recall
how one day a high-ranking man displayed such utter respect
that one of the companions exclaimed, "Thank God that I lived
long enough to witness with my own eyes the power and
influence of the Faith." On another occasion the Master said,
"At what time now will Nasir'd-Din Shah come and witness the
greatness of the Cause of the Blessed Beauty?"

At most of the Baha'i gatherings and Feasts in Paris, the
Master would be invited and would address those present. One
night, Miss Anderson who was known as "Ruhiyyih Khanum" hosted
a Feast at her place. 'Abdu' 1-Baha invited each of the
companions to the feast and later on stated, "I am a 1 i ttl e
tired and would 1 ike to take a stroll and do some sight
seeing." He then dismissed everyone present except me, asked
me to get a car ready and from there we set off for Champs-
Elysee Avenue. There He stepped out of the car and started to
walk around. This avenue, one of the most celebrated avenues
in the World, had a particular charm about it and was quite
glamorous and luxurious. 'Abdu'l-Baha enjoyed this place
immensely, praising its beauty and the bright street-lights in
particular.   At length he expressed disappointment over the
spiritual darkness of the city and said, " If civilization is
not infused with spirituality, it is a total loss. These are
but civilized animals, while the inhabitants of Africa are
savage humans. " On this particular night, it came to my mind
to ask Him certain questions to which I had given much
thought, so that I might hear what He would say.      So after
being given leave to speak, I asked, "Should an undertaking be
carried out to completion, or should affairs be left up to God
until His blessings are given and the means of achievement are
made possible?" At once he turned His Blessed Face to me and
replied, "Why would you say things like this? A man should
make constant efforts and for every undertaking follow through
with steadfastness and perseverance. Any undertaking should be

carried out to completion and, of course, all the while divine
assistance should be sought. " During the course of our stroll,
according to Persian custom, I walked respectfully behind Him,
arms crossed over my chest, and at the same time happened to
be wearing a Persian hat. It happened that a certain Persian
Prince who was in Paris at the same time as we were, took
notice of us and recognized me. This Prince was related to
Zillu's-Sultan and was an enemy of the Faith. He ran over to
me, took me by the sleeve and inquired, "Who is this man?"
With a brusque movement I broke free my sleeve and stated,
"His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Baha, 'Abbas Effendi." The instant the
Prince heard this name, he escaped like a burst of wind, while
the Master paid no heed to him whatsoever.

All that evening I was able to spend in the company of
the Master, deriving blessings from conversing with Him. And
after the Prince went his way, His Holiness 'Abdu' 1-Baha,
began to inquire after my business and of the workers in my
employ. He asked how many they were and of them how many were
Baha'is, to which I gave a detailed reply. At that time, not
counting secretary, bookkeeper, clerks and office personal,
there were over 100 trained tailors in the business, more than
half of whom were Baha'is. As I observed the Master's concern
over the workers, I begged Him to write for them a few words.
By addressing them in a Tablet, he would impart joy to their
hearts and they would be proud that the Beloved of the Worlds
was keeping them in His remembrance.     The Master right away
accepted to do so and asked for their names.

We returned home with utmost joy. As we entered our
quarters, the Master said to the companions, "Tonight we went
for a walk with Jinab-i-Khan. By chance we were able to take
in some of the glamourous avenues of Paris we had not seen
before. Then we returned by cab, which is cheaper here than in
America. " He then dismissed everyone and afterwards I gave Him
a list of the tailors in my shops which He had requested. I
thought that He would tend to it when time permitted.       But
instead, He immediately wrote the following Tablet for the
workers in my shop while still standing and handed it to me.

- ""Abdu'l-Baha

In the Master's Presence in Paris

Late afternoon one Thursday we were in the presence of the
Master. Those assembled there to the best of my recollection
were      Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Aziz'u'llah Khan Varqa, Mirza
Muhammad Baqir Khan, 'Aqa Mirza Asad'u'llah and Tamaddun'ul-
Mulk, along with'" Mon. Dreyfus, some others and myself. The
Master was speaking of the progress of the Cause and, after
citing several instances, turned His face towards me and said,
" Inscribe in the margin of your book: All the forces of the
world are being defeated. Have patience for a few years. The
light of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah will envelop the whole
world." *

All the addresses and discourses of 'Abdu'l-Baha throughout
Europe -- especially in London and in Paris -- at which I was
present, were quite long and detailed. Since I took no notes,
I will not attempt to elaborate on them. Particularly since
all these have been meticulously detailed in the book, Paris
Talks, as well as in other sources. I shall only make mention
of those events and statements which stand foremost in my
memory. These episodes are a constant source of joy and
upliftment for my soul. Each one of the utterances of 'Abdu'l-
Baha were taken down in shorthand by several secretaries. I
was merely a humble observer, witnessing with my own eyes how
those of nobility with whom I used to associate in Tehran,
fully aware of the degree of their pride, would be transformed

*The substance, of this remark, has been attested to by Jinab-i-Aqa-i-Bar-
Afrukhtih, member of the NSA of Iran.

into a state of lowliness and humility in the presence of the
Master. The power and influence of the Master over them was so
profound that the picture of it all will never fade from my
mind.

The Theosophical Society

On a night pouring hard with rain, 'Abdu'l-Baha attended a
gathering of Theosophists to which He was invited. Many people
were assembled there. Upon 'Abdu' 1-Baha' s arrival, al 1 present
paid their respect to Him. Their convenor introduced Him as
follows: "His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Baha, in our eyes, represents
the epitome of a perfect man and spiritual being. In these
times, his discourses and pronouncements present a model for
the entire world to follow. This new Cause has been founded
some eighty years ago. At its inception the Bab appeared among
the Moslems to bring healing to the world. Then Baha'u'llah,
the greatest of the Divine Manifestations, laid stress on
universal peace and the federation of nations.      'Abdu'l-Baha
is presenting these very teachings. He has given talks and
Theosophists have been drawn to His discourses. So it is our
great honour to give audience to the discourse He is about to
deliver to us. Let us put aside all our preconceptions and
absorb ourselves in His discourse, which wil 1 undoubtedly
prove to be a source of wisdom and illumination.          We have
asked Him this evening to address us, to which He has kindly
assented. His talk will be fully translated for us and at the
end of His discourse, He will chant a prayer in Persian, which
will however, not be translated. Doubtlessly our spirits will
ascend to loftier planes as a result of that prayer. Now, with
our utmost deference, we beseech 'Abdu'l-Baha to commence His
address." Thereupon the Blessed Master gave a talk and Mon.
Dreyfus translated it, sentence by sentence.*

Newspaper Coverage

One day, a large number of people were gathered in the
presence of the Master. One of the Baha' is, who had just
returned from London, brought back with him some newspapers.
He stated to 'Abdu'l-Baha, " Your Honour, most papers have
covered your itinerary there. The majority of stories were
quite positive. But a few have penned some false statements."
The Master smiled and replied, "We knew this ful 1 wel 1, and at
our farewell night in the presence of scholars and professors
and others, we made mention of this fact. We stated, 'We are
about to depart. No doubt certain individuals will arise in
opposition. They will publish articles against the Faith.

(*For the text of this discourse, kindly refer to Mahmud's Diary.)

And what would result from it? The fruit of it all is the
increased awareness and understanding all this would create.
From the very inception of the Faith till the present, evil
wishers have written a number of unjust statements. Had you
yourself seen what lfaji Mu~ammad Karim Khan stated about the
Faith what would you have said?" It later became clear that
these articles were partially written by Professor Browne.

The Master continued, "I will have someone write a crushing
response to Professor Browne." Then He told me to accompany
Him to Mon. Dreyfus' house. At once I hired a taxi and the
Blessed Master thus honoured Mon. Dreyfus' residence with His
presence. He asked Mon. Dreyfus to read Browne's narrative,
together with the description of His attainment of the
presence of Baha'u'llah. Mr. Dreyfus was thus reading aloud,
and translating. The Master was listening most attentively.
What has stuck in my memory was more or less as follows:     I
recal 1 how Browne wrote that he had tea in Haifa, then
proceeded to 1Akka by carriage, and at last attained the
presence of Baha'u'llah. As he himself writes, "When I desired
to proceed to 'Akka, a few of Baha 'u' l lah sons were in my
company. I entered the room and found myself in the presence
of a wondrous figure.    The face on whom I gazed I can never
forget though I cannot describe it. Those piercing eyes seemd
to read ones very soul; power and authority sat on that ample
brow.   I found myself entranced in His presence.    Thereupon
Baha-u-llah stated, "Thou hast come to see a prisoner and and
excile.     We desire but the good of this world and the
happiness of the nations.     Does not your country need this
also?"    He then bade me be seated, and ordered tea for me. I
then was able to regain my power to speak."

Up to this point 'Abdu'l-Baha approved the truthfulness of
these statements!    What was written in the newspapers after
that he said was nothing but falsehood. This man is a
hypocrite. The Master then repeated over and over, "I will
order someone to write a crushing response to him." After
stating this, 'Abdu'l-Baha left Mon. Dreyfus' residence and
returned to His own.

> Jalalu'd-Dawlih Attains the Presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha in
> Paris

The Master would receive, from morning to evening, eminent
scholars from both East and West, who had requested the honour
of meeting Him. Each such individual who put forth a question,
would be granted a sufficient response, and would depart
completely satisfied. Nevertheless, the Master did not enjoy
his stay in Paris, and would frequently remark that the city
was dark "like a beehive." His wish was to leave Paris as soon
as possible.

One day, Jalalu'd-Dawlih, who was of Persian aristocracy,
rich and powerful, and also a friend of mine, came to the

Master's presence, whereupon he was invited to have lunch. At
the table, 'Abdu'l-Baha talked mainly on the greatness and
achievements of the Faith. Jalalu'd-Dawlih was listening most
carefully. At last he decided to say something, and began by
paying me a compliment. The Master stated at this point, "It
is not necessary to introduce him to me. I know him quite
well." But the reason for Jalalu'd-Dawlih's insistence in
doing this was that one of the sons of Zi 11 u' s-Sul tan's*
named Hormouz Mirza, had written a letter to 'Abdu'l-Baha. I
was the one who had delivered the letter to the Master. The
Master had given response which I had taken back to the
questioner. Jalalu'd-Dawlih was aware of this, and therefore
encouraged me to approach Zillu's-Sultan and his brothers and
inform them of the Faith. As I was well liked by Zillu's-
Sultan and his family, I was comfortable to speak of the Faith
quite openly and had no fear whatsoever in doing so. Zillu's-
Sultan, though he would listen, would at the same time turn a
deaf ear to it.

Though the Master was rather ill and weak in Paris, every
day he would meet people either in His residence or at other
gatherings of both Eastern and Western Baha'i friends.      He
would deliver elaborate discourses. Jinab-i-Dighan was in the
presence of the Master and would take notes.     Every day He
recovered   correspondence   which  consisted   primarily   of
invitations from various cities. Many invitations came from
Germany -- especially Stuttgart -- in which the friends in
those regions expressed their longing for 'Abdu' 1-Baha to
visit. Upon regaining some of His health and vigor, He set out
in that direction. Due to personal buisness, with the Master's
permission, I remained behind in Paris. In my stead, Jinab-i-
Baqir accompanied the Master to Germany.

The War of 1914-1918 and the Days Following

After my journey was completed and I had returned to Iran,
World War I broke out. The Master had warned about the war
long beforehand, but no one could imagine its eventual
outbreak. At any rate, not only during the course of the war,
but in the period following as well, I was kept in suspense as
to when I would be able to attain the Master's Presence once
again. Other friends were more fortunate and would succeed in
attaining His Presence. I often expressed my servitude to Him
through Jinab-i-Amin and other pilgrims. Each time I would beg
for the opportunity to attain His presence, once again, even
though in principle the Master had long ago granted me such
permission. I somehow did not have the opportunity until I at
last received a Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Baha which delighted my
heart and uplifted my soul:

*Son of Nasiri-d'Din-Shah and governor of Isfahan at the time of the death
of the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs.

> In care of Jinab-i-Amin, Tehran.
> To Aqa Mirza Aziz'u'llah Khan, the Tailor.

Upon him be the Glory of God.

He is GodJ

0 Spiritual FriendJ Signs of divine assistance,
in this blessed year, are radiating from all horizons,
even as the rays of dawn. Verses of proof are chanted in
village and city alike and whole streams of heavenly
blessing flow throughout societies the world over.

From every side an anthem is raised, and from
every land a melody and refrain. These are the overall
bestowa 1 s of God. Give ear to the cry of "Ya Baha 'u '1-
Abha ", ascending to the Concourse on High, and to the
call of "Ya 'Ali 'u '1- 'Ala," imparting joy and rapture to
the ears of (those in) the Kingdom.

The friends must be at the apex of joy and
happiness because, thanks to God, the desires of the pure
in heart and the utmost wish of luminous souls, are now
visible and manifest through the bounty and grace of His
Holiness (Baha'u'llah), the Supreme Goal.

The Beloved One of our desire is present in this
gathering in His Most Great Beauty and has manifested
Himself to all the friends. Jinab-i-Amin has the utmost
praise for the spiritual meetings of the friends of
Jewish heritage, who in truth have taken great steps and
made every effort toward service in the Cause of God.

At this point, I wish very much to bring each and
all to mind, and write a word for each of those dear
friends who are in my heart. Alas, time does not permit
mention of each, one by one, so they will be given
recognition together. Know that Jinab-i-Amin has made
mention of each individual.

Praise   be  to   God,   that   in  this   great

Visit with the Master after a Lengthy Lapse of Time

After the end of World War I, in the year 1919 to be
precise, I set out for Istanbul via Russia in the company of
Mirza Ghulam-'Ali Khan Davachi.    Travel following the war was
not without its difficulties. This was mainly due to the
presence of enemy forces scattered throughout the territories.
Countries which had surrendered were under occupation by the
controlling military forces, which oversaw all traffic.      At
the border crossing at Badkubih, we faced a number of
problems. Jinab-i-Davachi had left me alone while he sought
help at the Baha'i Centre.    Fortunately for me, the British
Consul there had known me previously in Tehran. He was
informed as to the nature of my business and with his
assistance, the immediate difficulties were resolved. Jinab-i-
Davachi and I were transporting a fair amount of merchandise
and because bandits were plentiful, the roads were unsafe. I
approached the Consul to see if he could consider means for
our protection. As a result, he charged two guards to escort

at Badkubih, where I found Jinab-i-

the bounty of meeting with the
Baha'i friends.

In the company of 'Ali-Akbar Nakhjavani we undertook to pay
a visit to Mirza Naqiov. He was ill and bedridden. Jinab-i-
Nakhjavani stated that these two gentlemen were on their way
to pilgrimage. "Permit them to supplicate for your recovery,"
he said. The ill man burst into tears and sobbed so deeply
that we were all deeply touched.     Later, in Batum, we heard
the news of his passing.

Together with Ghulam 'Alf-Khan we reached Batum and from
there set out for Istanbul. I had plans to travel first to
Europe and from there embark on pilgrimage on the way back.
When I notified Ghulam-'Ali Khan of my intentions, he decided
to accompany me on the rest of my itinerary, because we were
good friends even though I knew then that his only mission was
to make a pilgrimage.   I advised against it, but he insisted
on travelling through Europe.     Unfortunately he had no visa
and therefore officials denied him passage. He implored me to
stay behind and try to obtain for him a visa. We prepared

all the documents we could, even to the extent of supplying
precise dates for the major points of our itinerary. But the
will of God was otherwise. One night he was seized by severe
abdominal pains. At once we consulted a physician, who
diagnosed the ailment as appendicitis. He had to undergo an
operation immediately, so I took him to a hospital and
thank God       the operation went smoothly. I remained in
Istanbul until his recovery. I then insisted that he give up
his plans for Europe and proceed directly to 'Akka. After
saying goodbye, he set out for Haifa, and I for Europe.

After taking care of personal affairs in various European
cities, I embarked at once for the Beloved of the World. Upon
attaining His presence and kissing the sacred threshold, the
first words my Master spoke were these, "Jinab-i-Khan, we were
waiting for you for a very long time. This time you were very
late."* Thereafter the Master showed special kindness to me
and would often express words and sentiments which meant a
great deal to me. Bonds of love and loyalty grew so strong,
that I was simply unwilling to leave His threshold save for
his dismissal. In reality, I was unable to tear myself away.

One day the Master was out for a walk with Mirza Haydar-
' Ali on the slopes of Carmel. I was present as well. The
conversation was generally about Carmel, the shrine of the Bab
and the advisability of purchasing surrounding properties. The
Master thereupon turned His Blessed Face towards me and
stated, "Encourage the friends to endeavor even more to
purchase land on Mount Carmel, because it will not be possible
later on."

Afterwards the Master asked f}aji Mirza J:Iaydar- 'Ali, "Tell
me some news. " To which Mirza Haydar- 'Ali replied, " Your
Honour, Ibtihajul-Mulk has sent'a letter." He had scarcely
finished speaking when the Master broke in, "Write to him.
Respond immediately and tell him to move right away and come
here as soon as possible." Though I do not recall the exact
words, it seems this statement was reiterated several times.
As I was dismissed, Mirza Haydar-'Ali explained to me, "Jinab-
i-Ibtihajul-Mulk in his' letter had only expressed his
servitude and had not requested permission for pilgrimage but
I will write him to convey that permission has been granted."

The Son of Azal, Who Sought Refuge at the Sacred Threshold

At the Inn in Haifa, it was customary for newly arrived
travellers and pilgrims to be introduced to each other in
order to foster fellowship among all the friends. Among the
newcomers was a man with a very sad face. He had a long
moustache and a tall red finih (headdress). He would talk to
no one and would not introduce himself. He would not take part

(*When Jinab-i-Azizi was recalling this statement he was filled with
emotion.)

in discussions, and would refuse to socialize.

I asked who he was and why was he such a loner. Why did he
refuse to talk and why would others show him no kindness? I
was told, "He prefers things that way, and the Master has
ordered that no one disturb him." I was further told "He is
Azal's son, and has come from Cyprus and has sought refuge
with the Master. He is the Master's guest and 'Abdu'l-Baha is
taking care of his expenses." I was al so observing Mirza
Badi'u'llah, who was standing in the Master's Presence
respectfully, with arms crossed over his chest, eyes fixed on
the ground and very quiet. As I knew of his actions in the
past, I exclaimed, "What is he doing here?!" I was told that
he had expressed shame for his past actions and had sought
refuge at the threshold of 'Abdu'l-Baha. The Master was also
taking care of him.

Dr. Farid was likewise utterly selfless and humble in the
Master's presence.    While   'Abdu'l-Baha would discourse,
everyone would be all ears, with arms crossed in the Blessed
Presence. The actions by covenant-breakers alone suffices to
furnish irrefutable proof of the grandeur of the Cause for one
embued with insight.

The Counsel of the Master that I should not Travel Alone

I was one day in the presence of the Master on the occasion
of an outing. So drawn was I to the Master's perfections that
in my state of intoxication, I lost all sense of self. I found
myself soaring in the atmosphere of wonder and rapture as I
took in the wisdom of His utterances. Among the many things He
had to say to me was that I should not undertake to travel
alone in the time to come, and that I should try to have with
me a trusted companion.      Having said this, he related the
story of a    robust man who used to carry the sacred messages
of Baha'u'llah to the Baha'i friends, and would deliver their
letters and gifts back on return to the Holy Land. Often he
would bring with him considerable funds of money as well. His
name was Amin.    In fact, he was a very strong and imposing
man.    Towards the end of his 1 ife, he still considered
himself somewhat invincible, even when passing through
unprotected and remote villages. En route he would also
conduct some personal business. His pride and over-confidence
were his downfall. Suddenly he vanished, and nothing was heard
from him again. Indeed he had become too self-assured and
eventually met an ill-fated end. Therefore He told me that in
the course of my travels I should never again travel alone,
but to always take someone with me.     Such of course was the
gist of His statements, His exact words escape my memory.     I
simply relate what I took to heart then and what has remained
with me since. There in fact may have been other meanings in
His statements beyond what I understood, but I absorbed what
I was able to, based on my capacity back then.

A while later we were in the presence of the Master,
partaking of His blessings when the friends requested we all
be photographed with the Master. So a picture was taken in
front of His residence. At that time Shoghi Rabbani was not
present. Upon his arrival, the Master ordered that another
picture should be taken in front of the shrine of the Bab on
Mount Carmel. This resulted in the joy of the friends.

A Mission Given by 'Abdu'l-Baha

One day the Master sent word that I should prepare to
embark on a mission. At once I expressed my complete obedience
and readiness to execute His wish.      As the Blessed Master
wished to see me before my departure, He cal led me to His
Presence. He then entrusted me with a considerable number of
Tablets and sealed envelopes. He placed these with His Blessed
hands in my pocket and stressed, "Be careful, along the way,
deliver these to their intended recipients. You must endeavour
to exercise vigilant caution."

I kissed His blessed cloak, tears streaming from my eyes.

His kindness to me was endless and comforting, and He advised
me to presevere. I was scarcely able to fathom the foresight
behind His admonitions to be patient, the reasons for which
were later to become evident (as I shall explain later) .
Anyway, with heart filled with love, and eyes brimming with
tears, I made my departure.

The harsh martial restrictions immediately following the
war had not yet been relaxed. Guards at every border would
carefully make their searches. Spies were being watched for
and sealed envelopes were forbidden as a matter of course.
Warnings to this effects were made public everywhere.
Remarkably, no official took pains to search me. It was as if
all the officials with whom I had contact were somehow
negligent in their duties.

Accompanying me on this journey were Jinab-i- 'Ali Khan
Firuz Hamadani and Jinab-i-Ayyub Rafa' at. Jinab-Ayyub Rafa' at
was a tall and sturdy young man. I asked him to stand guard
over my luggage. En route, in Istanbul, I delivered a number
of Tablets of 'Abdu' 1-Baha to their respective owners.      In
particular, there was a Tablet in honour of the friends in
Badkubih, through its recipient Mirza 'Ali Akbar Nakhjavani,
who was in charge of the business interests of Nagiov. Upon
receipt of the various Tablets, all the friends held a
magnificent Feast at the Baha'i Centre. At that Feast, an
announcement was made that visitors from the Holy Land had
arrived, bearing a Tablet addressed to the friends of Bakubih
which would be read for all the friends present. Everyone
there was thrilled with anticipation. The entire Tablet was
chanted aloud and was a cause of great rejoicing.

This occasion coincided with the Russian Revolution, when
the fire of chaos had been sparked by the Bolsheviks. The

friends were in a state of bewilderment, and knew not what
course of action to take. The Czar of Russia had been ousted,
yet the Bolshevik regime was not yet in full control. In that
Tablet, the friends of Badkubih were advised to remain calm,
and not to side with or join ranks with any political faction,
and to live up to the Baba' i teachings.        Conscientiously,
after saying our farewell to the friends of Badkubih, we set
out for Tehran.

In Rasht, Ibihaju' 1-Mulk, who was an old friend, had
invited me to visit. Since he knew I had just come from the
Holy Land, he asked about the wel 1-being of 'Abdu' 1-Baha.
Suddenly I recalled the time on Mount Carmel when 'Abdu'l-Baha
asked Mirza Haydar-'Ali, "Tell me what is new?" And when
mention was m·a de of Ibtihaju' 1-Mulk' s letter the reply came,
"Write him to come right away."

All this I related to Ibtihaju' 1-Mulk, and urged him,
saying, "You must go as soon as possible to the Holy Land, as
the Master has willed you should" Jinab-i-Ibtihaju' 1-Mulk
responded, "Yes indeed. In fact the letter from Mirza Haydar
'Ali has arrived as well, admonishing me to do the same, but
the trouble is -- I have not asked for permission to go on
pilgrimage! I had merely enquired after the well-being of th e
Master."    Ibtihaju'l-Mulk did not choose to go to the Holy
Land, and, sadly, he was found murdered a short while later in
Rasht. Not only his family but friends as well were caught up
in grief caused by his loss.

In Tehran, I presented the Tablet addressing the friends to
the Spiritual Assembly, so that it could be copied and
circulated among the friends. You will find the text in the
pages following:

In care of Aqa Mirza Aziz'u'llah Khan, the Tailor, -
- on him be the Glory of the Most Glorious!

To all the spiritual friends in Tehran. Upon each
and all rest the glory of the Most Glorious!

HE IS GOD!

0 my Lord, 0 my Lord! Thou beholdest Thy loved
> ones, attracted to Thy Abha Kingdom, enkindled in their
> inmost being, enf lamed with the fire of Thy love, that is
> blazing in the Tree of Sinai, submissive to Thy lofty
> Word, humble in Thy Cause amongst all people, obedient to
> that which Thou hast commanded in Thy Epistles and
> Tablets, excelling in the promotion of Thy Word, and
> clinging to Thy Most Great Bounty.

0 God! They are surging as the billowing waves,
> raging as the blowing breeze. They have scattered Thy
> fragrances amongst the peoples of the earth and, not
concealing themselves in obscure corners, they came forth

and called out in Thy name, openly beckoning all to Thy
love at every morn and even-tide. Thou seest them,
bowing, prostrated, humble and submissive at the door of
Thy Onesness, self-effacing and lowly, and they have
resisted those , who, in their pride and arrogance were
negligent in their remembrance of Thee.

O GodJ Thou knowest that Thy servant is intoning
at every morn and eve the verses of His contentment with
them, His tongue, breaking forth at every dawn and dusk
in thanksgiving to them. Praised be Thou, 0 Bestower of
Bounty for having enabled them to serve Thee and
confirmed them in worshipping Thee, attaining to Thy
knowledge, being steadfast in Thy love, and grateful to
Thy Bounty and Mercy.

0 my Lord! These are the birds of the apex of
knowledge, sustain their wings with the ensigns of might
and power, that they may soar to the highest realm, to
the ultimate aim, to the endless heaven and make of them
towering trees,    waving banners,    surging fountains,
beautiful gardens, and mighty mountains, unmoved by the
blowing winds even though it were raging storms, breaking
down the hollow palm trees, and assist them in all their
affairs under all conditions and give them to drink of
the chalice of Hope, overflowing with Joy in the Kingdom
of Beauty.

Verily, Thou art the Compassionate, Thou art the
Bounteous, and Thou art the Most Beloved and Exalted One.

0 companions of     'Abdu'l-Baha! At this very
moment, on the slopes of Mt. Carmel, near to the Shrine
of the Bab, This Servant is engaged in your remembrance
and occupied with your mention in a state of utmost
happiness and joy. This is due to your recent initiative,
enthusiasm and efforts, deserving of recognition, which
were reported recently from Tehran. The flames of the
fire of the love of God have lept to great heights. I am
in a state of rapture and happiness, for that land is the
birthplace    of  His    Holiness,   the   Supreme   Goal
(Baha'u'llah), and should therefore become the centre of
divine inspirations. From that blessed city the rays of
the love of God should radiate in all directions, and the
fragrances   (of   the  teachings)   spread   throughout.
Teachings which shake the pillars of ancient imitations
and overthrow the foundations of decayed beliefs.

At any rate I supplicate morning and evening, day
and night, imploring His Divine Holiness (Baha'u'llah) to
impart renewed strength at every moment and to manifest

a fresh fravour and exuberant vigour.

Jinab-i-Mirza Subhi did not fall        short in
> recounting your praise. Indeed he adorned his speech with
> your mention and praise, stating that each of these
> friends is worthy of blessing from the Realm of Glory,
> and ever deserving endless bounties from the Concourse on
High.

Upon you be the Glory of the Most Glorious!

> 'Abdu'l-Baha 'Abbas 1920 Haifa

> My Wish for a Ninth Visit to the Beloved of the World,
> His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Baha

(The account of this pilgrimage is taken from the
traveller's narrative, penned by his own hand.) The longing
kindled in my heart and soul for a ninth visit had now set my
being aflame. So in 1921, both for business purposes and to
behold once again the beloved Master, I embarked on yet
another journey. A company of us Persians made our way through
India. The route through Russia was no longer possible due to
the closure of the borders as a result of the Bolshevik
Revolution, making entry by foreigners practically forbidden.

We went by way of Qazvin, and following our visit with
the venerable Hakim Ilahi, we left for Ramadan and from there
to Kirmanshah and Qasr-Shirin. In every place and town we
experienced honour and joy as a result of meeting the friends.

This was especially true in Ramadan, where the friends
hosted a festive gathering of some fifty people. The eminent
scholar Jinab-i-Fadil Shirazi delivered an address for the
occasion which was pleasing to all. Another Feast, held in our
honour at the invitation of Jinab-i-Mirza Mihdi, saw a large
number of friends attend and our spirits were uplifted. Since
the Master had ordered me never again to travel alone, I set
out once more with a group of Persian merchants in my company,
some of whom were Jewish ( Jinab-i-Cohen, his son Soloman
Khan, and Jinab-iHarunian.) We became good friends along the
way and, upon reaching Baghdad, stayed there for a week. I had
the honour of visiting the sacred house of Baha'u'llah there.
This encouraged the Jewish friends to undertake visits to
their own holy places in Baghdad. They likewise went to the
town of Hileh to visit the shrine of Navi Yizgil. Of course I
accompanied them.

Our host in this shrine was Khajih Davud. On the day of
our visit, his friends warned him, "A local gang of Arab thugs
are intent on ambushing your guests, with the justification
that they are, after all, non-Moslem. Acting on this tip-off,
Khajih Davud informed the local constable. A police escort of
several officers, upon orders from the British governor of

'Iraq, then escorted us to the railway station.

Poor Khajih-i-Davud, barefoot with a dagger concealed
beneath his cloak, followed us to the train depot in order to
defend us, should the guards fail to do so. As we distanced
ourselves from the town, the gang which was after us sent word
to other gang members at the next station. It was quite
possible that our porters had been offered bribes, since they
seemed anxious to drop our luggage and leave. The presence of
the police escort was an effective deterrent.

At any rate,     we passed through some precarious,
unprotected countryside, but at last made our way to the
station. Alas, the train had left and we would have to wait
one week for its return. There was no choice but to return to
Baghdad. Because of this we became quite disturbed. We had
made it all this way after so much hardship. Now, how could
we even make a return journey without risking further danger
from the gang still on the look-out for us?

Each of us was mulling over our predicament in our own
way when, quite unexpectedly, a non-scheduled train made a
stop about a kilometre away. Each of us put his own belongings
on his back and we hurried to reach the train. That night, I
had truly tasted the fear of death, wondering what my plight
would have been, had I travelled alone.

After five days and five nights of sailing in a ship by
the name of Zobaydih, we reached Vasra. During all this time,
we had neither room nor space for ourselves. The whole time we
would wander endlessly on deck. Imagine, five days and five
nights without any means of rest or the necessities of simple
accommodation.    Al 1 this eventually passed as we reached
Basra. We had intended to travel through Yemen, but for some
reason the required visas were not issued.

I personally knew Mr. Wilson, the British consul in
Basra. I approached him and with his influence was able to
arrange for tickets to India. As the ship was to dock for five
more days, I travel led through the city to do some sight-
seeing.

Karachi was a charming and lovely town. It brought to
mind images of beautiful cities in Europe. Along the shore,
children would throw themselves into the water, swim like
frogs out to us and beg for money, as they would from other
travellers who threw coins into the water to watch the
children dive. The little divers would retrieve each coin with
dexterity and ease. Though all this was brought on by poverty
and the callousness of the residents there, it was not without
enjoyment for all concerned, though the class disparity was
something to behold.

The city itself had a special aura, with a beauty and
order all its own. However, this landscape was marred by the
dreadful poverty we saw.

After two-and-a-half days by ship, we finally reached
Bombay. There we headed to Aqa Mirza Ardashir's establishment,
known as Edward's Inn.     During our stay, I derived great

pleasure from visiting the Baha'i friends in India. Most of my
time I spent in the company of Aqa Mirza Fadl 'u' l lah Khan
Banani, a good Shirazi friend of mine. He likewise wished to
see Europe with me and make his pilgrimage to the Holy Land on
the way back. He urged me that we should become travelling
companions.   Unfortunately, I had already purchased my own
ticket so I began to make every effort to obtain a ticket for
him on the same vessel. Also during that time, I would visit
the Haziratu'l-Quds where he was staying, and was fortunate
enough to meet several other friends.

Distressing News

One Day, I approached Mirza Fadl 'u' l lah Khan at the
Baha'i Centre to discuss our journey with him.     In front of
the    stairs,   I   met   one   of   the   blessed    friends.
Uncharacteristically, he appeared quite depressed. This caused
me to wonder. I ascended the stairs and at the top caught
sight of Mirza 'Ali Muhammad Khan Nabili (son of Jinab-i-Aqa
Shaykh Ahmad Nabili Qazvini). He was sobbing with a heart-
rending grief. I asked, "What has happened? Why are you in
tears?" He did not answer. I then entered the hall. There I
saw the caretaker crying also. I grew more curious as to what
was going on. I enquired once again, insistent upon an answer,
yet was given no response. At this point I could no longer
contain myself. Harshly, with unyielding insistence,          I
demanded to know why these men were grieving, and why no one
was saying anything.

Jinab-i-Mirza Mahmud Zarqani, with grave sadness yet with
great love, reported, "His Holiness Abdu' 1-Baha has passed
away to the Abha Kingdom."

Upon hearing this,    I was thrown into turmoil and
experienced such intense anguish that I lost all control. I
struck my head and face so violently in grief that I
eventually passed out. When I regained consciousness, I beheld
a group of individuals circled around me, splashing me with
cold water trying to rouse me. They sought to console me by
saying, "This report of the Master's Ascension was not true,
but could be the work of covenant-breakers. We should verify
such rumours by telegram."

But, alas, they thought that by talking like this they
would calm me down. God only knows the extent to which my
broken heart was shattered beyond all possibility of comfort.
I was sobbing loudly and there was no way to stop my tears.
One of the prominent Indian believers, Mr. Vakil, was trying
to console me, while sprinkling rose-water on my face. He was
talking in Hindi, and Mirza Mahmud was translating rapidly as
fol lows:   " This is no small occurrence, and the news has
reached us from an unofficial source. So we should make every
effort to confirm this report."
Meanwhile, my grief was such that everyone else present

forgot his own pain while trying to find a way to calm me
down.     In the midst of al 1 this, those around me kept
insisting that we ought to send a telegram straightaway to get
to the truth of the matter, and, moreover, there were those
non-Baha'is present for whom our display of emotion was not
appropriate and might reflect negatively on the Cause.      Yet
what antidote is there for a heart rent asunder?

While this was taking place, my travel companions arrived
at the Baha'i Centre. The instant they saw me in such a
pitiful state, they became distraught and concerned and, after
discovering the cause of my sorrow, expressed their deepest
sympathy and condolences, notwithstanding the fact that they
themselves were not Baha'is. By force, they took me back to
the residence to change my clothes, since what I was wearing
was drenched down to my underwear.

When we approached Jamshid Ardashir' s Inn, the owner
himself grew concerned over my condition the moment he saw me,
and asked me what was the matter. I did not explain. The
others simply said that I was not feeling wel 1. Al 1 the
friends came to see me and console me. They had forgotten
their own sorrow to comfort me. Such was the state of things
until the answer to our telegram came back: The Ascension of
the Master had taken place on November 28.

Sheer sorrow made my trip to Europe impossible. I told my
friends that I was not going to Europe and cancelled my
tickets accordingly. Upon receiving the telegram, the Indian
Baha'i friends gathered in a large hall, garlanded it with
memorial bouquets, and chanted prayers, especially the Tablet
of Visitation.

Profound sorrow and anguish was felt that night. How
utterly downcast the friends were. In that atmosphere of
grief, the friends resolved that they should ever remain
united, that       God forbid      there should never be any
division among them. They swore they would prevent chaos and
disunity from ever befalling the community, and never to
thwart the advance of the Cause. Nor did they wish, by so
doing, ever to give cause for the enemies and those jealous of
the Faith to gain satisfaction.

Decision to Depart for the Holy Land

My heart was crushed and my spirit was consumed in
sorrow. Whatever I tried to do to console myself was in vain.
My only recourse was to visit the Holy Land. The only ship due
to depart soon for Port Said was the "Sri Bijana." But there
was no space aboard that vessel. This mattered little to me.
With unrelenting insistence,     I succeeded at length in
convincing the captain to allot me space on deck, en route to
Port Said. To whatever objections the captain raised that the
journey would be arduous,      over rough seas,     lasting a
fortnight, lacking comfort, with no sleeping accommodations,

I swore that it was of no consequence to me.

As it turned out, the captain's warnings proved true.

From the very first day, the sea was so storm-ridden that it
was impossible even to eat. But compared to my own inner
turmoil, the storm was nothing, and for that matter eating was
of little consequence as well.

From Port of Eden to Port Said

Following two days of hunger, thirst and exhaustion, the
ship anchored a ways off Port Eden. As the stopover was for
some time, I went to Eden by boat to get some food. The town
appeared civilized, even somewhat Western, but the women were
half-naked and all walked barefoot. The city had a lively
atmosphere that would attract most any tourist.

At any rate, we reboarded the ship as it embarked for
Port Sudan. Upon entering the city, we encountered the exact
contrary to Eden.     Port Sudan was scarcely populated, the
inhabitants appeared to live in abject poverty and filth. We
boarded ship once more and set off for the Suez Canal. The
ship moved calmly through the channel. On either side were
enchanting    gardens   and  magnificent   trees.    It  was  a
breathtaking scene, a wonder to behold.

To resume, at night we reached Port Said. At once I took
a boat to town to see Mirza Ahmad Yazdi, and soon learned that
the Baha'i friends had departed for Haifa. Upon hearing this
news we left immediately, and at midnight reached Qanta.      I
had with me a letter of introduction addressed to 'Abdu'l-
Rahman Effendi, a high official in Immigration, and because
of this the paperwork was quickly done and shortly after
midnight I took the train for Jerusalem.     'Abdu'l-Rahman had
already advised me as to where I should transfer trains.

I first reached Jerusalem. It was pouring rain all along.

In the sector of Jerusalem which Muslims call the Noble
Sanctuary, I visited every holy place and shrine sacred to
Islam and Judaism, and in each place said prayers. I should
mention that in all of the Jewish holy places, I would enter
as a Moslem, since foreigners were otherwise not granted such
permission.

My sole purpose in entering these shrines was to find
some peace and consolation after pouring out my heart in
prayer. It made no difference where, since in my eyes, all
religions were one.

The Scene of Heart-Rending Sorrow

It was forty days following the ascension of the peerless
Master when I reached Haifa. A magnificent memorial service
was about to commence.      From al 1 neighbouring towns and
countries -- Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, and Egypt -- leaders

of religion and nobility alike were in attendance, and each in
turn deliverd a special tribute concerning the greatness of
the life and accomplishments of 'Abdu'l-Baha. There were more
than 500 Christians, Moslems, Jews, and Baha'is present. All
were served some food, tea and coffee in 'Abdu'l-Baha's house.
Each paid a personal tribute and gave his own account of the
many services rendered by 'Abdu'l-Baha, who was many times
referred to as the foremost individual in the entire world.
Each person spoke in his own native tongue, and most were
deeply struck with remorse. Many were moved to tears. Each
tribute was given before a large picture of 'Abdu' 1-Baha,
which was placed in the front part of the room. These
tributes, which were in French or Arabic, were published, by
and large, in the press.     On that occasion, many powerful
officials and people of eminence, together with various
journalists, presented themselves. This gathering lasted from
noon till dusk, at which time the crowd departed with deep
sorrow.

Unaware of my own condition, I myself was overwhelmed
with tears and pangs of sorrow. Only Jinab-i-Aynu'l-Mulk took
notice of me, sat by me and tried to console me.          Al so
'Abdu'l-Baha's sons-in-law manifested the greatest kindness
and sympathy towards me.    After the gathering had ended, my
tears kept flowing.   My state was such that all the friends
expressed to me their sympathy.    I had truly lost control of
myself, and until it was suppertime, all present were drawn to
the spectacle of grief and sorrow. At bedtime, the friends
entrusted me to Mirza Yusuf-Khan Vojdani to take me to Mirza
'Inayat'u'llah Khan Isfahani's residence to rest. Mirza Yusuf
Khan tried his best to console me and impart words of advice,
but nothing except my tears would quench the fire, flaming in
my dark heart.   I recall, that as a result of the entreaties
of Mirza Yusuf Khan, I lost control of my speech and said,
"What are you talking about? You -- such an old man -- wish to
live, and simply let the father of humanity pass on." The poor
man replied, "When did I ever desire such a thing? Don't you
think that I myself am just as heartsick?"

> The Occasion on which the
> Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha was Read

It was Sunday, the day after the memorial service, and
the friends were gathered in the blessed residence. In the
adjoining rooms the ladies and all the women of 'Abdu'l-Baha's
household were gathered behind closed curtains with doors left
ajar. The Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha was about to be
read.

Three Tablets written by the Master himself were brought
to the gathering by one of 'Abdu'l-Baha's sons-in-law. In the
presence of all gathered these were given to Mirza Yusuf Khan
Vojdani Hamadani to chant. He arose, and with a sorrowful

voice began to chant one of the Tablets. The gathering was
filled with sorrow and I was overcome with emotion. I could
not stop my tears. The chanting of the Will and Testament
took place from morning till 1:00 pm.     Because Mirza Yusuf
Khan was emotionally drained in the course of his reading, the
remainder of the Tablet was chanted by Aqa Muhammad-Taqi
Isfahani, a merchant from Egypt.        The final "'T ablet was
chanted by Mirza Yusuf Khan again.

During this entire time I was not alone in my tears. All
the friends from Iran, Egypt and the United States were crying
pitifully. Everyone was overwhelmed with a sense of loss and
profound grief.   Any Baha'i who has read this document knows
full well with how great an emphasis the unity of the friends
was stressed, and also of the appointment of Shoghi Effendi as
his successor. The Master referred to him as the "Incomparable
Branch" and the Guardian of the Faith. Opposition to him was
accounted as opposition to God. The Master had called upon the
people of Baha to obey the Guardian and to avoid all disunity.

When the reading of the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-
Baha was over, one of the friends gave a very moving address.
At the close of his remarks, he spoke of the naming of Shoghi
Effendi as Guardian, in an optimistic and forward-looking
manner. After this, the friends present entered the room in
which the ascension of the Master had taken place. There they
saw His taj and broke out in such expressions of sorrow as are
beyond my power to describe. My own grief left me with eyes
swollen by tears, and my appearance was quite pitiful to see.

A Wonderful Feast Following the Reading of the Will &
Testament

After reading the Will and Testament, the friends were
all invited to a luncheon hosted by Aqa Siyyid Jalal, son of
the King of Martyrs, who was one of the sons-in-law of
'Abdu'l-Baha.

There were chairs arranged in four or five rooms to seat
all the friends. After lunch was served, we returned to the
blessed residence of 'Abdu'l-Baha. As my condition still was
unstable, three of the friends were commissioned to take me on
a walk. One of them was Jinab-i-'Abdu' 1-Rasul, whom I had
known previously. He was the one I had met during my first
pilgrimage, when we visited the holy shrines together.

It was remarkable that however much I tried to calm down,
it was all to no avail. Tears were streaming from my eyes
unceasingly and I had no control over my grief. It was around
dusk that I finally began to settle down, and we returned to
the residence of 'Abdu'l-Baha. There was a gathering in the
very place where we used to visit the Master and, as his
absence again struck me, I once again lost my composure. My
sorrow overwelmed me once again, and my outburst moved all
those present. But Jinab-i-Mirza Yusuf Khan Vojdanf broke in

with a chanting of prayers and holy writings, and this
affected me a great deal. I felt better and calmed down.

After the end of the meeting, we partook of dinner and
following this, all went home to retire. Together with Mirza
Yusuf Khan Vojdani, I went again to the residence of Mirza
'Inayat'u'llah Isfahani.

> Visit to the Shrine of Baha'u'llah
> at the Request of the Greatest Holy Leaf

The next morning, Jinab-i-Mirza Lotf'u'llah Khan Hakim
arrived with a message from the residence of the female
members of the Master's household, which said that I should
pay a visit to the Most Holy Shrine in Bahji. On this day,
pilgrimage to the most sacred threshold should bring me solace
and impart tranquillity to my heart.

Upon   chanting   the    Tablet   of   Visitation    and
circumambulating the Shrine, we returned to Haifa around dusk.
As was our custom, we gathered with the friends in the
Master's residence for prayers and reminiscing about the
Master. The sorrow and sense of loss had abated little. The
time came to retire and everyone returned to their quarters.
Some went to their homes nearby, while most went to the Inn on
Mount Carmel, and others went to the homes of friends to rest.

> In the Presence of the Guardian,
> Shoghi Effendi, "The Chosen Branch"

The day following pilgrimage to Bahji, Shoghi Effendi
Rabbani, the Chosen Branch and Guardian of the Faith, accepted
for the first time a group of friends to his presence, in
spite of the fact that he himself was recovering and was in
bed.

Prior to the meeting, everyone was advised to consider
the condition of the Guardian, and not to show grief in his
presence, for the very reason that he himself was in deep
sorrow, and displays of emotion would only intensify his own.
Those who counsel led us in these matters were principally
Mirza Ahmad-i-Yazdi and one of 'Abdu'l-Baha's sons-in-law.

Those who were summoned were:

> Jinab-i-Aqa Mu~ammad Taqi,
> Jinab-i-Mirza Asadullah Shirazi
> Jinab-i-Simum Effendi (one of the Armenian Baha'is),
> Several gentlemen from Egypt,
> Jinab-i-Ma~mud Effendi from Port Said,
> Aqa Ahmad-i-Yazdi,
and myself.

We were in his presence for about half an hour. What he
said to us I do not exactly recall, overcome as we were by our
sorrow and grief. After showing great kindness to each one of
us, he dismissed us.

> Request for Pilgrimage to the Shrine of the Bab
> and to 'Abdu'l-Baha's Place of Rest

Through one of the Master's sons-in-law, I requested
permission from the holy household to go to Mount Carmel to
visit the shrines of the Bab and 'Abdu'l-Baha. When permission
was granted, I at once notified Darvish Tavangar, Jinab-i-
Mirza Yusuf Khan Vojdani, along with several other Baha'is and
together we set out for the precincts of the Beloved.

On the way, Darvish Tavangar chanted prayers in sorrowful
tones. In the guest house we had tea, and afterwards performed
our ablutions. Together with the rest of the pilgrims, we
began our way to the Shrines, to pay our respects.

As we entered the Shrine of 'Abdu'l-Baha, we bowed our
foreheads to his threshold and cried in anguish from the
depths of our souls.    There no one interfered with or tried
to console the other. The flames of sorrow were consuming our
individual hearts.

Then Mirza Yusuf Khan Vojdani raised his voice to recite
the Tablet of Visitation with his soft and sorrowful voice.
Once the Tablet was chanted, we returned to the guest house.
It was close to dusk when we made it back to Haifi from Mount
Carmel. We again went to the blessed residence of 'Abdu'l-
Baha. Again all the friends were gathered in the Master's room
and were intoning prayers. Again, following this each went to
his own place to rest and sleep.

> Request to Attain the Presence of the Guardian
> to Gain Permission to Wire Tehran

Fol lowing the reading of the Wil 1 and Testament of
'Abdu'l-Baha, and after a number of pilgrimages to the sacred
Shrines, there was pause for thought and soul-searching and
slowly but surely a sense of peace took hold once more in my
heart. The audience with the Guardian, and the time spent in
the Shrine of 'Abdu'l-Baha had special effect. One day,
through one of the sons-in-law of the Master, I requested
leave to again see the Guardian. He summoned me at once,
showered me with kindness, and proceeded to ask the reason for
my visit. I replied, "Your Excellency, the friends in Tehran
are aching in their hearts for word from this sacred spot. I
request that a telegram be dispatched to Tehran."          The
Guardian said, "Write a draft and bring it to me." So a draft
was created and presented, but the Guardian made certain
revisions.   The  message   was  finalized,   and with    full

authorization, I wired the telegram to Tehran, which read as
follows:

Tehran Spiritual Assembly

Praise be to God that we are most joyous to be under
> the shadow of the Chosen Branch -- the Guardian of the
> Faith, His Holiness Shoghi Effendi.

Aziz'u'llah.

Until that time, the honorific, "Chosen Branch," had not
been current, and the station of the Guardian was not known.
Thus the content of the message was in itself unique, though
I know not what kind of response it generated in Tehran.* A
few days after the dispatch of the telegram, and sensing
within myself peace and calm, I requested permission to leave.
The Guardian again summoned me to his presence. The il 1-
condi ti on which had afflicted the Guardian was gone. His
father, Jinab-i-Mirza Hadi, was our guide, advising me not to
display emotion and thus sadden the Guardian. Though I had
found some peace and calm, yet my heart was still grief-
stricken.

When I came into his presence, the Guardian embraced me
and, after a few words, he asked me about my business
enterprise. After this, with utmost reluctance I requested
leave to depart. The Guardian turned his face towards me and
said, "If you have anything you wish to say, don't hold back.
Should you wish for anything, do not hesitate to ask."

At this moment, feelings of inner despondency transformed
into confidence. I responded, "Your Excellency, I have nothing
to say and wish naught save the welfare and progress of the
Cause." On that note, the Guardian spoke a few words of
direction and at the end, said, "Rest assured, rest assured,
this Cause will progress and will triumph over the whole
world." He then said farewell and departed. In the evening I
said farewell to the friends, after asking them to pray for me
for divine assistance, and at length retired to my place for
rest.

The Trip to Europe

After obtaining permission to depart, I left for Port Said

*The present writer on several occasions from Jinab-i-Rastigar at various
gatherings: "At that time I was Secretary of the Local Spiritual Assembly
of Tehran. Receiving that telegram brought joy and gladness to each and
every one of the members of the Assembly. Once the message was published,
all the friends rejoiced, especially over the title, 'The Chosen Branch',
which was a new term to the friends."

on the following morning at dawn. With me were Jinab-i-Mahm6d
Effendi (one of the Arab Baha'is from Port Said) and Dr. Salih

(one of the most renowned and skilled physicians of Egypt)
My old friends and dear companions Jinab-i-Lotf'u'llah Khan
and Aqa Mirza Hasan Yazdi came to the railway station to bid
us farewell.

Upon saying our final farewells, we started our trip. We
travelled together till that afternoon when we reached the
Egyptian border.     As we reached Qantara, Dr. Salih went his
own way, while Mahm6d Effendi and I set off towards Port Said.
At Qantara on ·Egyptian soil, we disembarked from our
Palestinian train, boarded an Egyptian one and reached Port
Said an hour after midnight.

Jinab-i-Mahm6d Effendi would not tolerate my staying in a
hotel, and put me up in his own home. As our arrival was
unannounced and his family had not expected us, dinner had not
been prepared. In fact we had not had a decent meal either for
breakfast or for lunch. After waiting a while, as no dinner
was served, we went to sleep hungry and the next day we
feasted at both breakfast and lunch.

The following morning, Jinab-i-Mahm6d Effendi and I went to
purchase my      ticket   for  passage   to  Marseilles.   Quite
unexpectedly, a certain ship, which had set sail at midnight,
mysteriously returned two hours later. After purchasing a
ticket, I made the necessary arrangements, took care of
personal affairs, lunched with Mirza Ahmad-i-Yazdi in the
company of Mahm6d Effendi, and then embarked on my journey
with the 10,000 ton ship "Yorkshire."

After having endured hardships and deprivations during the
course of my travel from Tehran, and having faced various
calamities, discomforts, bad news and sorrows, I decided it
was worth the extra expense to purchase a first class ticket
to Marseilles for 25 English Pounds.

It was midnight when the ship arrived, which anchored a few
kilometres off shore. Jinab-i-MaDm6d Effendi and I took a boat
in order to board the ship. A red lantern hung in front of the
boat as a signal. The small boat heaved to and fro beneath the
enormous waves which made us seasick and anxious. It all
seemed endless. It made me wonder how many more hardships and
concerns we would yet have to endure in the course of this
voyagel     I had already endured so much suffering and hardship
in my life, and had tasted so much bitterness, yet why was
this particular hardship so hard on me then? Perhaps my broken
heart, wounded yet as it was, had been sapped of its strength
with no more power left to brave hardships. Even so, I was
thankful, and surrendered myself to fate. At last I entrusted
myself into the hands of the Blessed Beauty and prayed for
divine assistance from 'Abdu'l-Baha.

We reached the ship after two hours. The ship was large and
luxurious, and I was assigned a spacious and lavish room.
There were two beds in that room, yet the other bed wasn't
reserved for another passenger. After moving my belongings to

the room (with Jinab-i-Mahmud's assistance), we took a walk
around the ship. Even for.Mahmud Effendi, who had seen many
ships previously this Vessel Was particularly magnificent and

f

attractive. When the announcement was made that departure was
imminent, I embraced Jinab-i-Mahmud Effendi and said farewell.
Our farewell was very emotio.nal and drew the notice of
passengers around us. Some turned to watch, wondering, "Who
are these people -- one with the Egyptian finih and the other
with the Persian hat? Why is he exchanging farewells with an
Egyptian man and how is it that each is hugging the other with
such devotion? What is the reason for such brotherhood,
friendship, attraction and affinity?"     At  length,   Mahmud
Effendi disembarked from the craft and, for as long as we
still saw each other, we were waving to each other with our
handkerchiefs. Onlookers enjoyed watching the whole scene,
still wondering what was behind all this show of affection.

Half an hour after he left, moonbeams rippled across the
sea, the view being one of peace and tranquillity, as if
nature herself were giving us pause for thought on the meaning
of peace itself. The moon, in all its calmness and patience,
cast its glance upon everyone. It also cast its glance upon me
in my loneliness, as if to say, "You are now alone, without
friend or companion, and you are still touched by sorrow. Look
upon me. Consider what patience I manifest, and take me as
your example. I have witnessed many important events over
time, yet I continue in my quiet way. No power of my own have
I, nor can I resist; therefore I have surrendered myself to
the order of the universe. You are no more important than I,
and are not endowed with greater power. And you, too, abide
by the dictates of your fate."

I was thus lost in contemplation while the ship sailed on.

As I reached the shores of Europe, I experienced the opposite
to what I had endured at the onset of my journey, with all its
hardship, heartbreak and sorrow. In Europe, everything turned
out well. I was successful in all my affairs and I achieved
such progress in material concerns that I could no longer
justify, with all my fortune, depriving my family the
opportunity to visit the Holy Land and attain the presence of
Shoghi Effendi.

Therefore I resolved that on my next trip, I would take my
family and, after touring Europe, take them on a pilgrimage to
the Holy Land and visit the Guardian of the Faith.

A Third Visit to the Guardian of the Faith, Shoghi Rabbani,

In 1925, my family (including some of the children) and I
set out on a trip for Europe. After six months of combining
business with pleasure, travelling abroad in Russia, Germany,
Paris   (and other parts of      France as well),    England,
Switzerland and Italy, we departed for Egypt.    Through the
Spiritual Assembly we sought permission for pilgrimage to

From right to left; Mr. Anayatollah Azfz(, Jinab-i-Azfz 1 u 1 lla'h Az(z(,
Mr. Ezatollah Azfzf, Heshmatollah Aziz[, Mrs. Bibi Azfzf, Tahereh Aziz[

the Holy Land. Once the joyous news of our permission came, we
left right away and reached Haifa forthwith.

My wife and our two small children             Tahirih and
Heshmat'u'llah -- went to the blessed Household, where they
attained the presence of the Greatest Holy Leaf, and were her
guests. My oldest child, Anayat'u'llah, and I stayed in the
guest house on Mount Carmel. As we entered, the Guardian
summoned me privately and blessed me with his special
consideration. We stayed for nineteen days. Each day, the
beloved Guardian would accept us into his presence and would
converse with us.

He asked about the friends in Iran, and would talk often of
the progress of the Cause, comparing past to present. He was
thrilled with the speed of the progress of the Cause,
especially in the West. He would admonish and encourage the
friends of the East not to waste their time and let their
Baha'i brothers in the West surpass them in the teaching work.
The believers of the East had ever been the standard-bearers
of the Cause, and thousands of them had shed their precious
blood to this end. The Guardian, moreover, stated that on the
way back to Tehran, we should meet with the friends and
encourage them to intensify their efforts to serve the Faith,
and to ever remain steadfast. Such was the way, in which the
Guardian was accustomed to "give orders" that is, to entrust
one with a mission to carry out.

One of the interesting incidents on this trip concerned my
small child Heshmat'u'llah, who was not more than five years
old at that time. As he had no playmate, didn't know the
language and was far from his brothers and sisters, he kept
pressuring us to return to Tehran in different ways each day.
But as we reached the Holy Land, an unusual calm and peace
settled over him.     Without any advance instructions, or
discussion as to the station of the Guardian, or how he should
conduct himself in the Guardian's presence, my son was the
first to show his respect, when we entered the presence of
Shoghi Effendi. He threw himself at his feet to kiss his
shoes. But the Guardian swept the boy up in an embrace, held
him closely and made fast friends with him. This very child,
who would not keep quiet for scarcely a minute along the way,
was absolutely silent in the Guardian's presence, and would
listen attentively to all that he said.

One day, the Guardian was speaking about events which had
recently taken place in Baghdad, events which were disturbing
to him. He gave me instructions as to how I might intervene on
his behalf in these matters, and thus I was given a mission to
carry out. According to his wishes, we were dismissed on the
19th day of our pilgrimage. We set out on our return journey
home, and en route, whenever necessary, stopped and imparted
the Guardian's message in various places.

Our stay in Baghdad was somewhat longer than expected
since, in addition to delivering the Guardian's message, I was
obliged to intervene in a dispute between two of the friends,

both of whom had rendered important services to the Faith and
who were, in all other respects, steadfast. The unfortunate
incident was this:

The dispute was related to the Faith. Each man, in his own
estimation, considered his own service to the Faith as more
meritorious than the others. The Guardian, upon learning of
this dispute, was quite dismayed and consequently commissioned
me to intervene to settle the matter, and to deepen the
friends' understanding of the Baha'i teachings which relate to
such matters. In Baghdad, therefore, I addressed the friends
as to the necessity of seeking guidance and direction from the
head of the Faith, as well as the importance of concentrating
our efforts on the teaching work and on creating unity in the
Faith.   As a result of this, there was a fresh spirit which
revivified the friends, who had prior to this become somewhat
cold towards one another. Those who had been dissatisfied
emerged with a positive outlook, and the inactive became
spirited and anxious to serve. As bonds of friendship grew
stronger among each and every one, and the fire of service to
the Faith became rekindled in the hearts of all, I felt
confirmed over the result of my mission, and thus set out for
Tehran.

I suppose the friends in Baghdad had sent a report to the
Guardian in the Holy Land concerning these events.      I also
took it upon myself to send a detailed summary of what had
taken place after I finally reached Tehran. At the close of
the report, I put to paper several humble recommendations of
my own for the Guardian's consideration. The purpose of my
suggestions was to sustain and consolidate the spirit of
enthusiasm among the friends in that land. A while later, a
letter came from his presence, in the handwriting of Jinab-i-
Nuri 'd-Din-i-Zayn, with the following response:

The most specific of my recommendations was this: that
Shaykh Muhyi'd-Din from the Egyptian Baha'i community who was
a  r~wned scholar and speaker      be sent to 'Iraq for the

T

encouragement of the friends there. In fact I knew the Shaykh
from the past. He was a dynamic speaker and a profound
scholar. He would chant the sacred verses with a captivating
intonation, and no one disliked his company. He was respected
and praised by all the friends and was welcome wherever he
went.    I heard later that the Shaykh, by order of the
Guardian, took up residence in Baghdad for some time, and made
great efforts in consolidating the Baha'i community there,
news of which greatly pleased the Guardian and brought him
peace of mind with respect to the Faith in Baghdad.

> [Edi tor's Note: At this point,    the direct   narrative of
Jinab-i-Azizi comes to a close]

Jinab-i-Azizi, upon his return from the Holy Land and Baghdad.

The Wishes and Aspirations of Jinab-i-Azizi

Aziz' u' l lah Azizi, who has since passed on to the Abha
Kingdom, was an active and stalwart believer from the
beginning of his youth. To the best of his ability, he would
avail himself of every opportunity to render service to the
Cause.

To give an example: Once we were departing from the
Hazirat'u'l-Quds, where a large and radiant meeting was held.
Suddenly, great joy shone radiantly in his face, and asked the
reason, he replied, "Don't you see for yourself what a grand
crowd this is? What a magnificent gathering! Such a charming
garden! What a glorious and handsome building! And take a look
at all those late-model cars parked side-by-side, each and
every one belong to Baha'is. Observe for yourself what
progress has taken place in the space of just 30 years.
Consider what the future has in store!"

God bless the soul of Jinab-i-Na'im! He once said, "Show me
a Baha'i who now owns just a carriage, and I'll toss my hat
into the air! Where is such a man now to be seen, seeing that
Baha'is now have the best of everything -- prosperity, good
fortune, places to meet like this! Thirty years ago, Baha'is
would assemble in dark underground rooms, for fear of their
own friends and relatives.          In such surroundings they would
intone their prayers with sorrow and fearful voices. Now they
assemble in a respectable building, under a large dome, and
chant the verses of God in ringing tones. They stroll in
landscaped gardens such as we see here. All these are from the
bounties of Baha'u'llah. Why should we not be happy, joyous,
and thankful?" During my youth, I was a member of those first
Spiritual Assemblies, which were then known as Boards of
Consultation. One, of which I was a member, had, as I recall,
the following individuals elected as well:            Haji Mulla 'Ali.-
Akbar, Ibn-i-Abhar, Jahi Mirza Abdu' u' l lah Saqat-Furush (later
on surnamed by the Master, "Sahih Furush"), Nayyir and Sina.
On that Assembly, after several sessions of deliberation, it
was decided that Aqa Muhammad 'Al1-Arbab be commissioned, for
10 tumans annually, to' collect contributions for the Fund.
During the first few months, donations were not enough to
cover Aqa Mu~ammad-'Alf 's wages. Now consider what a glorious
turn-round has taken place since then. At that time the funds
were infinitesimal. Now the funds have become an ocean. And
this can be seen, not only in Tehran, but the world over. The
first meeting of that council which took place in my own home
under fearful circumstances created a lot of turmoil. Now, in
less than 30 years, there are meetings such as this held in
such a magnificent building which is matchless in Tehran.*

*The beautiful dome of the Baha'i National Centre was destroyed during
the anti-Baha'i campaign of 1335 A.H. (1955 C.E.) as a result of the edict
promulgated by Falsafi, in collaboration with General Badtman-Qalich,
Commander-in-Chief of the Iranian Armed Forces.

These are all due to the bounties of the Blessed Beauty.

In reality, until then, few buildings could match the
excellence as that of the National Hazirat 'u' 1-Quds.   Few
buildings could boast of so spacious a hall.

Last Days

Jinab-i-Azizi had rendered over 50 years of self less
service to the Faith. For half a century he was always
thankful,    positive,  service-oriented,    ever-active   and
resourceful. He was a member of numerous committees and task
forces. His sense of commitment was such that he would put the
interests of the Faith above all-else, and would do whatever
was in his power to serve those interests. He had no greater
wish than the progress of the Faith, and the advancement of
the Cause of God.

For instance, when for the first time he attained the
presence of the Guardian, the Guardian asked him what his
wishes were.   Jinab-i-Azizi asked only for the progress and
advancement of the Cause of God, to which the Guardian
repeatedly gave assurance, "It will come to pass. Rest
assured, rest assured."

His Exemplar was 'Abdu'l-Baha. In every thought and deed,
Jinab-i-Azizi looked to the Master. His love for Abdu'l-Baha
was beyond description. I can honestly say that he was
unreservedly loyal to the Master, to the extent that, at the
very mention of Abdu'l-Baha, tears would well up and glisten
in the corners of his eyes, which he would try to conceal as
well as he could.

The Premonitory Dream of Jinah-i-Aziz'u'llah Azizi

A few days prior to his passing, Jinab-i-Azizi confided to
me, "Last night, I had a dream. During the dream I was quite
anxious and agitated, but after waking, I grew calm. In my
dream, I found myself in a car speeding away from the city. By
dusk, we approached a desert. I had grown weary of the
surroundings and wished to turn around and go back. As I
started to do so, I suddenly realized that the car had
vanished. I grew anxious over this and wondered how I was
going to find my way back to town. I came upon a carriage and
the driver agreed take me back for the sum of two tumans. I
got into the carriage, but suddenly once again I discovered I
was alone, as the horse and buggy vanished as well. I was in
a quandary. I searched to and fro for a way out of there, and
chanced upon two men who accepted to carry me piggyback all
the way home. I paid them their fee for carrying me but after
a while they too disappeared, and I awoke from my dream in
great anxiety."
I responded to my father, "You've been far too busy and

overworked lately, and it's clear you have many things on your
mind -- and these affect your condition. It's wiser if you
rest a little more, and delegate responsibilities to others."

Several nights later, I myself had a dream which made me
upset as well. I saw there had been a wonderful gathering in
our home and when it was over, people were leaving in large
groups. I was standing by the door with my father, Jinab-i-
Azfz 'u' llah Azfzi, saying good-bye to people as they were
leaving. I wondered to myself how such a large crowd had
managed to fit into our living-room. Though many were leaving,
still some remained standing in the hallway. There I spotted
Jinab-i-Dr. Yunis Khan Afrukhtih and Jinab-i-Dabir Mu'ayyad,
who had in real life already had died. As they were about to
leave, they took hold of my father's arms and insisted on
taking him with them. My father left with them, descended the
stairs and walked several paces. He then told them, "You go on
ahead. I will come on my own and join you shortly."

I woke up quite disturbed, but as I took a positive
outlook, I prayed a prayer of thanks that God had not taken my
father, but that he had remained behind. But little did I know
that this was not to last beyond 20 days. On Sunday, the 14th
of Isfand, 1328 A.H. (5 March 1949 A.D.), after a brief bout
of illness which lasted but 16 hours, my father passed to the
Abha Kingdom, at the age of 75.

After his passing, he received an honourable burial in the
Gulistan-Javid Cemetery in Tehran. Friends, relatives, and
family were all present. In the memorial service which
followed, Moslems and Baha'fs alike, as well as Jews and
Christians, were in attendance. To those who loved and
respected him, all suffered a great loss and each in his own
way would pray on his behalf.

One day after Friday devotions, a Moslem priest chanted
some verses from the Qur'an, after which he stated, "I thought
it my duty to pay my respects to Jinab-i-Azizi. I am not
concerned with his religion or professed beliefs. Rather, I
consider it an obligation on my part to ask for blessings upon
his soul."

This was a cause of astonishment to all, that a priest
should act in such a way, considering what enmity there was on
the part of some Moslems towards Baha'.f.s.

As news of my father's passing reached the Holy Land, the
following telegram, sent on behalf of the Guardian was
received:

"Rest assured of our prayers for the bestowal of blessings
upon your beloved one, before God."

Though I consider myself little qualified to do so, I
should like to reflect on some of the more remarkable
character traits of that wise and stalwart believer.

Insofar as he had the Master's example to follow and would
never do anything contrary to His will, Jinab-i-Azfzf was a

loyal servant of~Abdu'l-Baha. My father was ever content with
the will of God. His heart was always turned towards God, and
was intoxicated by his love for God.          He was a very
knowledgeable and cultured individual. My hope is that each of
my father's offspring will seek to follow his example in life,
and mirror forth his qualities.

Jinab-i-Azizi is survived by four daughters and seven sons.

God-willing, each of them will become the cause of joy and
gladness for the soul of their dear father, and go through
life as lighted candles in memory of his service to the Faith.

A Brief Account of the Acceptance of the Faith

by Jinab-i-Azizi's Spouse

The spouse of Jinab-i-Azizi, Bibi fillanum, was the eldest
child of Jacob and Qamar !ib.anum. Jacob would often travel on
business to the regions of Nur, Kujur, Takur and Baladih, his
line of business being fabrics.     From the days of his youth,
he was close friends with Nidamu'l-Mamalik, cousin of Abdu'l-
Baha, to the extent that each time he would pass through
Takur, he would reside in their mansion. There he even had his
own room, which he stayed in so often that it became known as
"Jacob's Room."

Though he was Jewish, he was respected by all who knew him.

They loved him because he was a handsome individual
sociable, kind, honest in his dealings, and a stalwart
believer. Conversely, whenever Jinab-i-Fad'u'llah Nidamu'l-
Mamalike would visit Tehran, he would be received each time as
a guest at Jacob's residence home.

It was said of Jacob's father that he was known for his
profound piety, particularly when it came to prayer. His
manner of prayer was so heartfelt that he often poured out his
soul in tears. This pattern was even more pronounced if he
failed to make it to Nur. It was even said that he had
developed a profound respect for His Holiness the Bab.

The present writer would often hear from his grandfather
Jacob that in Jewish tradition, there were foretold two
Messianic figures, the first of which would be martyred.
Though Jacob was Jewish in all respects, faithfully observing
all Jewish customs, he harboured no enmity nor ill-will
towards the Baha'is, as was the case with some other Jews.
Therefore he did not oppose, but rather consented to the
marriage of his daughter to Jinab-i-Azizi, a union to which he
gave whole-hearted support.

Bibi Khanum married at a young age. From the beginning of
her life"""i n her husband's home, she was dismayed to see her
husband in frequent arguments with his father, and throughout
all this she suffered a good deal. She did not know how to
cope with the situation. She would beg her mother-in-law to
step   in     to  resolve  the  conflict.    The  mother-in-law
unfortunately did not have the courage to side against her
son, so the two women did their best to pacify father and son
and do what they could to lessen the conflict. Years passed
like this, until the outbreak of the cholera epidemic. It was
at this time that Jinab-i-Azizi set out for pilgrimage to the
Holy Land.

Bibi fillanum was praying tearfully that her husband would
return safe and sound. One night, after her vigil of prayer,
she fell asleep. She dreamt that she had entered the attic of
her house, where they used to store food in order to bring
down some rice to cook. Suddenly she saw a coffin there. Two
quite respectable looking men were standing beside the coffin,

in silent contemplation, with an air of respect.

This took her by surprise and, alarmed and frightened, she
cried out, "What are you doing here? What do you want?" The
two men replied very calmly, pointing to the coffin, saying,
"These are the sacred remains of the Primal Point. Keep your
silence regarding this." Mrs. Azizi nervously asked, "Do you
know if he was from God?" The two men signaled their assent,
continuing to stand beside the coffin, respectfully crossing
their arm each across his own chest, gazing at the coffin
itself. Mrs. Azizi often said of this that at that point she
threw herself onto the coffin and broke into tears. She cried
to the Bab, "If you are truly sent by God, I beg you to
protect my husband and return him safely to me. In return, I
will dedicate myself in service to you for the rest of my
life." It was then that she woke from her dream.

When Jinab-i-Azizi returned home from his sojourn in the
Holy Land, he found that his wife had changed. From that time
onward she gave her ful 1 support to her husband, and was
faithful in service to the Cause. In each meeting she would
serve whole-heartedly. She endeavoured to raise her children
with Baha'i attributes, as was the wish of her husband. She
was proud and thankful that all her children were under the
protection of the Cause of God, and engaged in service to the
friends of God.

We can see that the blossoming of these attitudes in her is
alluded to in the first Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Baha to Jinab-i-
Azizi:

"My heartfelt regards to your respected spouse."

The Last Days of Jinab-i-Azfzf 's Wife, and Her Passing to

the Abha Kingdom

The esteemed wife of Jinab-i-Azizi, Bibi Khanum (whom
certain relatives called Sany Khanum) left her own residence
and went to live in her eldest son's home, Anayat'u'llah Azizi
in her last days during the revolution in Iran.

Bibi Khanum kept abreast of current events, and would
closely follow news reports on radio and television. In her
own outspoken way, she would express her own ideas for the
future and she refused to trust the religious leaders.

Most of her relatives, friends and immediate family would
visit her every now and then. Though she was aware of the
events taking place in the course of the revolution, relatives
would try to downplay these things so as not to make her
anxious and upset.

It happened that one night, when a number of her relatives
came to visit, a committee meeting was taking place in her
home, and others had come to contribute to the Fund. Suddenly,
a group of revolutionary guards, armed and savage had
surrounded the house, and broke into the home and ordered

everyone to keep still. One of the guards savagely ransacked
Bibi Khanum's room and frightened everyone around her. It was
this Shameful course of events that made her aware of the
precarious circumstances affecting her children, by virtue of
the fact that they were all Baha'is. It was then that her
condition worsened.

Following the arrest and imprisonment of the Azizi
brothers, the majority of family members often gathered
together in her home to pray in earnest on behalf of the
brothers in detention. Their mother, who was confined to her
bed due to her condition, overheard all that was going on and
thus grew more aware of the gravity of the situation.

She would ask to know of the circumstances involving her
sons and was told in a general way that there had been some
recent difficulties and to pray for them as well. The elderly
mother had kept her silence and said nothing, but those around
her noticed tears welling in the corners of her eyes and
moistening her pillow in silent grief. After the Azizi
brothers endured interrogations for a brief period of time,
they were released. Their mother, who had kept silent for
three days, after seeing Iskandar again said, " Iskandar, is
that you? God be with you."

She then prayed quietly for her other children and, on the
dawn of the 24th of Day, 1358 A.H. (15 January 1980), the
mother of eleven children and grandmother of more than one
hundred grandchildren and great grandchildren, with complete
peace and silence, passed to the Abha Kingdom. The lamp of her
life was thus quenched in the midst of sorrow over her
children's condition.

Due to the threat of the Revolution and the dangers it
posed, her memorial service was not announced to the public.
Nevertheless, a large gathering of friends, including Moslems
as well as Baha'is, attended her memorial to pay their
respects.

We supplicate the threshold of God, and beseech the Ancient
Beauty ( Baha' u' l lah), to immerse the soul of this self-
sacrificing mother in the Ocean of His blessings.
