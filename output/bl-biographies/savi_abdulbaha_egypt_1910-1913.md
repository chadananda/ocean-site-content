‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Egypt
Early September 1910 – 5 December 1913

Julio Savi

Abstract

‘Abdu’l-Bahá discontinuously sojourned in Egypt from early
September 1910 to 5 December 1913. This paper is a concise
study of the historical and political background of this sojourn
and of its chronicle. Egyptian cities and towns visited by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá are briefly described as they were in those days.
Members of the Holy Family who visited Him in Egypt are
mentioned. The public opinion reaction and the press coverage
are succinctly outlined. Several important personages and
resident and visiting Bahá’ís who met Him are listed. A short
comment on possible meanings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence in
Egypt concludes the paper.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s travel in Egypt is announced by Shoghi
Effendi as follows:

> He, quietly and without any previous warning, on a
> September afternoon, of the year 1910, the year
> following that which witnessed the downfall of Sultan
> ‘Abdu’l-Óamid and the formal entombment of the
> Báb’s remains on Mt. Carmel, sailed for Egypt ...1

Historical and political background

This travel which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá decided to undertake to
Egypt, Europe and North America was made possible by an
important historical event, known as the Young Turk

322                                    Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

Revolution. The Ottoman Empire, whose part the Holy Land
was in those years, had always been ruled by an authoritarian
regime. In previous centuries this kind of government was
normal and none paid any attention. But after the American
Revolution (1763-1783), and especially the French Revolution
(1789-1799), libertarian ideas made their way in the Western
world producing the sundry insurrectional, bourgeois, liberal
and democratic movements of the nineteenth century.
Unavoidably the echoes of these risings also reached the
Ottoman Empire. And thus at the beginning of the twentieth
century an association was formed in that country known as the
Young Turks, inspired by Mazzini’s “Young Italy (Giovane
Italia)” (1831-1848). Historians define it as a coalition of
groups, quite different from one another, formed by dissident,
progressive, modernist Turkish citizens, opposed to the status
quo, who were united by the common wish to actuate a
constitutional reform of the Turkish absolute monarchy. In
1908 they arose in arms against the Sultan ‘Abdu’l-Óamíd II
(1842-1918), who reigned from 1876 to 1909, and his despotic
government. The first result of this military revolt was the
restoration of the constitution, on 24 July 1908. As a
consequence, all political and religious prisoners of the Empire
were set free. Among them there also was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who
was thus free to leave not only ‘Akká, but also the Holy Land,
where He had arrived in 1868.

As to Egypt, the first country that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá visited after
His departure from Haifa, in those days it was pervaded by
conflicting political movements. The country was only
nominally a part of the Ottoman Empire. In 1867 the Sultan
‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz recognized Egypt’s Governor, Ismáʿíl Páshá
(1830-1895), a grandson of Mehmet Ali (1769-1849), an
Albanian Pasha, a politician and a military leader, considered the
founding father of modern Egypt, as Khedive. Khedive, from
the Persian khidív or khadív, “lord, prince, sovereign,” is often
translated “viceroy.” In 1879 Ismá'íl was deposed and his title
passed to his son Tawfíq Páshá (1852-1892). In 1882 the British
army occupied Egypt, but the Khedive remained on the throne
and the country nominally remained under the Ottoman rule. At
the beginning of the twentieth century, Great Britain struggled
to increase its influence over the country’s affairs and more or

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ in Egypt                                      323

less covertly undermined the attempts by the young Khedive,
‘Abbás Óilmí II (1874-1944), who assumed the throne at the
death of his father Tawfíq Páshá in 1892, to innovate the
Egyptian administration. At the same time, an arising and
increasing national conscience kept alive the wish of many
Egyptians to achieve complete freedom. And thus there was
strife between those who saw the wellbeing of the country as an
actuation of the Western models and those who wanted to seek
the assistance of the tottering Ottoman Empire to achieve the
Muslim Union, preached by the Persian (or Afghan) theologian
Jamálu’d-Dín-i-Afghání (1838-39–1897), who came to be
considered as the greatest Muslim reformer of the nineteenth
century. Moreover, immediately before ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s arrival,
Egypt had been shaken by an umpteenth violent clash between
Copts and Muslims.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá arrived in Egypt and brought a wave of
spirituality and modernity to a country which, although it was
the most intellectually advanced nation in the Arabic world, in
the religious, political and literary perspectives, had
undoubtedly much to learn from such an innovator as the
Master.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s sojourn in Egypt

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s sojourn in Egypt lasted 23 months altogether,
in three different periods. The first time He remained in the
country eleven months, from early September 1910 to 11
August 1911, when He took off for Marseilles on the S.S.
Corsica. The second time He stayed on for four months, from
early December 1911 to 25 March 1912, when He sailed via
Naples bound to New York on the S.S. Cedric. The third and
last time He sojourned in Egypt for seven months, from 16
June 1913, when He arrived to Port Said from Marseilles on the
S.S. Himalaya, to 2 December 1913, when He boarded a Lloyd
Triestino boat bound to Haifa, where He arrived on 5
December. Ahmad Sohrab (1893–1958), who served as ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s secretary and interpreter from 1912 to 1919 and was
excommunicated by Shoghi Effendi in 1939, has left a detailed
account of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s sojourn in Egypt from 1 July to 30
September 1913. Sohrab, whose original name was A˙mad-i-

324                                     Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

Ißfahání, went to America in 1901-1902, when he was very
young, as Mírzá Abu’l-Fa∂l’s attendant. His diary, published
under the title of Abdu’l-Bahá in Egypt, by New York’s Sears
and London’s Rider in 1929, comprises a chronicle of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s activities during those months as well as translations of
His Tablets and talks.

A short chronicle of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s sojourn
in Egypt

The details of the Master’s departure from Haifa are
reported by the Bahá’í News of the Bahá’ís of the United States,
later called Star of the West, whose first issue had appeared on
21 March 1910. Bahá’í News publishes a part of a letter written
on 29 August 1910 by Sydney Sprague (1875-1943) to Isabella
Brittingham. Sprague became a Bahá’í in Paris in 1902ca. He was
one of the earliest Bahá’í pioneers and travel teachers, and went
as far as India and Burma. His book A Year With the Bahais in
India and Burma, in which he narrates his travels in the East,
was published in London in 1908. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá called him
Eskander. In 1910 he married a niece of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s wife,2
the daughter of Mírzá Asadu’lláh-i-Ißfahání, the man who had
been in charge of the conveyance of the remains of the Báb
from Iran to the Holy Land, and the sister of Amín Faríd
(1880ca.-1953), who accompanied the Master in His travels in
the West, and was excommunicated by the Master in 1914.3
Isabella Brittingham (1852-1924), one of the 19 Disciples of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, is considered as the most eminent among the early
American Bahá’í women.4 The letter said:

> I have a very big piece of news to tell you. Abdu’l-Bahá
> has left this Holy Spot for the first time in forty-two
> years, and has gone to Egypt. Think of the vast
> significance and importance of this step! ... Everyone
> was astounded to hear of Abdu’l-Bahá’s departure, for
> no one knew until the very last minute that he had any
> idea of leaving. The afternoon of the day he left, he
> came to Mirza Assad Ullah’s home to see us and sat
> with us awhile beside a new well that has just been
> finished and said that he had come to taste the water.

> We did not realize that it was a good-bye visit. Then he
> took a carriage and went up the hill to the Holy Tomb
> (of the Bab). That night, as usual, the believers gathered
> before the house of Abdu’l-Bahá to receive that
> blessing, which every day is ours, of being in his
> presence, but we waited in vain, for one of the sons-in-
> law came and told us that Abdu’l-Bahá had taken the
> Khedivial steamer to Port Said.5

It seems that even the Greatest Holy Leaf, His beloved sister,
was informed of this travel only by a Tablet He sent her while
He already was on the steamer bound to Egypt.6

Other details of this departure are described in another letter
published by the Bahá’í News in December 1910. The letter is
signed by Siyyid Asadu’lláh-i-Qumí, an old believer who, a
resident in the Holy Land since 1886, accompanied ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá in His travels to Europe and North America. The letter
says:

> You have asked for an account of Abdu’l-Bahá’s
> departure to the land of Egypt. Abdu’l-Bahá did not
> inform anyone that he was going to leave Haifa. The
> day he left he visited the Holy Tomb of the Báb on Mt.
> Carmel and when he came down from the mountain of
> the Lord, he went direct to the steamer. This was the
> first anyone knew about the matter. Within two days he
> summoned to his presence Mirza Noureddin7, Shougi
> Effendi, Khosro,8 and this servant. The only persons
> who accompanied Abdu’l-Bahá to Egypt were Mirza
> Moneer Zain9 and Abdul Hossein, one of the pilgrims
> who was leaving at that time. When Mirza Noureddin
> arrived in Port Said, his brother Mirza Moneer returned
> to Haifa.

> For nearly one month Abdu’l-Bahá remained in Port
> Said and the friends of God came from Cairo, in turn,
> to visit him. One day he called me to accompany him
> when taking a walk in the streets of the city. He said:
> “Do you realize now the meaning of my statement when
> I was telling the friends that there was a wisdom in my
326                                     Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

> indisposition?” I answered, “Yes, I do remember very
> well.” He continued, “Well, the wisdom was that I must
> always move according to the requirements of the
> Cause. Whatever the Cause requires for its
> promulgation, I will not delay in its accomplishment for
> one moment! Now, the Cause did require that I travel
> to these parts, and had I divulged my intention at that
> time, many difficulties would have arisen.”10

As soon as the Master left the Holy Land, Mírzá Mu˙ammad-
`Alí (1853ca.-1937) spread the rumor that the Master had fled
away because He feared new persecutions from the new Turkish
government. Mírzá Mu˙ammad-`Alí immediately told it to
‘Akká’s Metropolitan, who was among his friends. The
Metropolitan telegraphed to one of his men in Jaffa, who
boarded the same steamer on which the Master was, approached
the Master and dared to inquire about His identity directly
from Him. The same thing happened in Port Said.

After a one month’s sojourn in Port Said, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá again
boarded a steamer without mentioning His intentions to
anyone. Star of the West announced this event as follows:
“SPECIAL. Word has been received from Port Said that Abdul
Baha has sailed from that port on a steamer for an unknown
destination.”11 He intended to go to Europe. But it was very
soon evident that His health did not permit Him to undertake
such a journey. He disembarked in Alexandria, whence He left
only on 11 August 1911, bound to Marseilles.

A few details of this departure are recorded in the same letter
written by Siyyid Asadu’lláh-i-Qumí and published by the Bahá’í
News:

> The day that he left for Alexandria he did not mention
> the matter to anyone; nor did this servant know the
> time of his departure. However, when I heard that he
> had left, I hurried to the steamer and there met him
> with two pilgrims from Ishqabad. He said: “Tell the
> friends, how, under severe circumstances of bodily
> weakness, I have accepted the hardships of traveling to
> promote the Word of God, to spread the Cause of God
> and to diffuse the Fragrances of God! I have left behind
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ in Egypt                                            327

> friends, relatives and home for the sake of the Cause!”
> By this he meant that the believers of God must follow
> in his footsteps and illumine the East and the West with
> the lights of knowledge, peace and brotherhood.12

When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá disembarked in Alexandria, He
discovered that the climate was suitable for His health and
therefore He stopped there. After all those years of
imprisonment in an insalubrious place, His health was quite
poor. And thus He did what He Himself recommends to the
Bahá’ís:

> ... man must become evanescent in God. Must forget
> his own selfish conditions that he may thus arise to the
> station of sacrifice. It should be to such a degree that if
> he sleep, it should not be for pleasure, but to rest the
> body in order to do better, to speak better, to explain
> more beautifully, to serve the servants of God and to
> prove the truths.13

He put His body at rest, so that He could muster His
strength in view of the long travels He intended to undertake.
And thus it happened that the Egyptian city became His
headquarters during His prolonged sojourn in Egypt. In those
three years He repeatedly went back to that city, whose climate
enabled Him to regain the required energy, for facing His later
journeys, especially His long travel to North America.

Ali M. Yazdi (1899-1978), a believer born in Egypt who went
to the United States in 1921, who witnessed the Master’s arrival
in Alexandria in October 1910, describes this event in a book,
Blessings Beyond Measure, posthumously published by his wife
in 1988, as follows:

> A crowd gathered in front of the Hotel Victoria for
> His arrival. Suddenly there was a hush, a stillness, and I
> knew that He had come. I looked. There He was! Then
> He walked through the crowd — slowly, majestically,
> smiling radiantly as He greeted the bowed heads on each
> side. I could only get a vague impression of Him, as I
> could not get near Him. The sound of the wind and the
328                                      Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

> surf from the nearby shore drowned out His voice so
> that I could hardly hear Him. Nevertheless, I went away
> happy.

> A few days later a villa was rented for Him and His
> family not far from the Hotel Victoria. It was in the
> best residential section, next to the beautiful
> Mediterranean and the beaches. Like all the villas in that
> area, it had a garden with flowers and flowering shrubs.
> It was there that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá chose to receive a great
> variety of notables, public figures, clerics, aristocrats,
> and writers — as well as poor and despairing people.14

A detailed chronicle of those days, during which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
so frequently came and went, would take too long. We will
describe only a few episodes.

Hasan M. Balyuzi (1908-1980), a biographer of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
reports a fact that reveals the Master’s care in His relations with
the Muslims. Balyuzi remarks that

> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s sojourn in Alexandria coincided with the
> Muslim lunar month of Mu˙arram. This is the month
> that witnessed the martyrdom of Óusayn, the grandson
> of the Prophet Mu˙ammad and the third apostolic
> Imam of His Faith, together with many others of the
> House of the Prophet. That tragedy occurred on the
> tenth day of Mu˙arram, 61 A.H., which corresponded
> to October 10th A.D. 680. The Shí’ah world has
> mourned his martyrdom ever since.15

During that month Shi’ites arrange gatherings                     to
commemorate the sad event. Balyuzi narrates that

> Persians of Alexandria invited ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to their
> meeting. He went and was received with every mark of
> respect. He gave a robe to the reciter of the heart-
> rending story of Karbilá, rewarding him richly for his
> talent and devotion. He also left money with the hosts
> to hold a commemorative meeting on His behalf and to
> feed the poor.16
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ in Egypt                                            329

In those days, the organizers of the First Universal Race
Congress, which was held in London on 26-29 July 1911 and was
attended by more than 2000 people, invited ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to
deliver a speech during the Congress. On 29 May 1911 He
answered that His present circumstances prevented Him from
attending.17 At the beginning of May ‘Abdu’l-Bahá moved to
Cairo and settled in Zaytun, a district of the city. Balyuzi
informs us that during that sojourn, beside meeting several
important personages, on a Friday He visited the Shrine of
Siyyidah Zaynab, sometimes considered as Imam Óusayn’s
sister, and recited there the Friday prayer.18 The Star of the
West issue of 8 September 1911 records:

> Abdul Baha, after staying nearly three months in Cairo
> during which time he was interviewed by many
> prominent people returned again to Ramleh, the
> delightful suburb of Alexandria, on July 22nd. He was
> accompanied by Mirza Assadullah, Mirza Moneer,
> Mirza Mahmoud and Aga Khosro.19

The same issue of Star of the West also published an article
by Louis G. Gregory (1874-1951), which briefly describes
Gregory’s sojourn in Ramleh between 10 April and 4 May 1911.
Gregory also wrote a more detailed account of his pilgrimage in
a book entitled A Heavenly Vista: The Pilgrimage, published in
Washington in 1911. The article published by Star of the West
says:

> I am asked by the STAR OF THE WEST for
> impressions gathered during a recent pilgrimage to
> Abdu’l Baha at Ramleh and the Holy City. Now I can
> respond but briefly; but later I hope that a full account
> may be given to the friends of the Cause of all the
> valuable lessons received from the Perfect Man.

> It is the will of Abdul Baha that all the friends should be
> united and happy in the light of the Kingdom. On one
> occasion BAHAOLLAH said, “My Presence is happiness
> and peace. Hell is the hearts of those who deny and
> oppose.” Today the happiness and peace of the Glory of
> God (BAHÁ’U’LLÁH) are reflected in the clear Mirror

> of Abdul Baha. Thus by meeting him one meets all the
> Prophets and Manifestations of cycles and ages past. It
> is difficult for one to realize at the time, or for a long
> time afterwards, the true honor of such a meeting. To
> one who realizes even faintly who this Servant of God is
> and what powers he represents, such a meeting is high
> above all the honors of earth. But no soul can give
> adequate testimony of what Abdul Baha may be to any
> other soul. With mental and spiritual horizon more or
> less limited, each pilgrim discerns according to his
> capacity the Majesty and Power that radiate from the
> Center of God’s Covenant.

> At Ramleh Abbas Effendi20 might at times be seen
> walking about the streets. Ofttimes he would ride upon
> the electric tramway, making change and paying his fare
> in the most democratic fashion. His reception room
> was open to believers and non believers alike. Upon a
> visit to some unfortunates one day I asked if they knew
> him. “O yes,” they responded, “he has been in this
> house.” Thus in one way or another thousands of
> Persians had opportunity to see ABBAS Effendi; but
> among these how few perceived Abdul Baha Viewed
> with the outer eye, he scored about the medium height,
> with symmetrical features. His lineaments indicate
> meekness and gentleness, as well as power and strength.
> His color is about that of parchment. His hands are
> shapely, with the nails well manicured. His forehead is
> high and well rounded. His nose is slightly aquiline; his
> eyes light blue and penetrating; his hair is silvery, and
> long enough to touch the shoulders; his beard is white.
> His dress was the Oriental robes, graceful in their
> simplicity. On his head rested a light tar bush,
> surrounded by a white, turban. His voice is powerful,
> but capable of producing infinite pathos and
> tenderness. His carriage is erect and altogether so
> majestic and beautiful that it is passing strange that
> anyone seeing him would not be moved to say: “This
> truly is the King.”

> On the rational plane his wisdom is incomparable.
> During the time of my visit persons of culture were
> present from different parts of the world. But people
> of acquired learning are but as children to Abdul Baha.

They were reverent in their attitude toward him ....21

Another pen portrait of the Master in those days was written
by Ali M. Yazdi, who at that time was eleven years old. He
remembers that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s voice was “very resonant, very
beautiful.” Then he adds:

> He was straight as an arrow. His head was thrown back.
> His silver-gray hair fell in waves to His shoulders. His
> beard was white. His eyes were keen; His forehead,
> broad. He wore a white turban around an ivory felt
> cap. He looked at everyone, smiled and welcomed all
> with “Khushámadíd. Khushámadíd” (“Welcome. Wel-
> come”) ... When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke to me, I would
> look into His eyes — blue, smiling, and full of love.22

On 11 August 1911, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá boarded the S.S. Corsica
bound to Marseilles. He went back to Egypt in early December
1911\. Of this second sojourn of the Master in Egypt Balyuzi
only wrote: “‘Abdu’l-Bahá wintered in Egypt.”23 Neither does
Star of the West, a rich source of information on the Master’s
travels, report news about ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s sojourn in Egypt in
those months. On 9 April 1912 it simply writes:

> A report that Abdu’l-Bahá and suite sailed from
> Alexandria, Egypt, March 25th on the White Star Line
> S. S. “Cedric” due to arrive in New York City, April
> 10th, has been confirmed.24

Only in 1918 Star of the West informs us that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
celebrated Naw-Rúz 1912 at the Victoria Hotel with a dinner
attended by 85 friends. He delivered a speech on the meaning of
Naw Rúz published by the American journal.25

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s departure for America on 25 March 1912 is
described by both Ali M. Yazdi and Mahmúd-i-Zarqání
(1875ca.-1924), a Persian Bahá’í, a chronicler of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
travels in the West. In his youth Ma˙múd travelled and taught

the Faith throughout Iran. In 1903 he went to India, where he
sojourned for many years. Later on he went in pilgrimage to
Haifa, where he remained for a certain time and transcribed
many Tablets. From Haifa He accompanied the Master to
Europe and America. Yazdi writes:

> Again ‘Abdu’l-Bahá left us, this time for America. I will
> never forget the scene of His departure, as He came out
> of the house and turned to wave His last farewell to His
> disconsolate family looking down from the veranda
> above. They were greatly concerned about His safety
> and well-being. He was sixty-eight years old. He had
> suffered many hardships and gone through severe trials.
> He had been in prison for forty years of His life. And
> now He was undertaking a journey to a far-off country
> utterly different from any to which He was
> accustomed.

> But ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had made up His mind. And when He
> made up His mind, nothing could change Him. He
> strode out of the garden gate without looking back. He
> walked for several blocks near the shore to take the
> electric train to Alexandria, where He would board the
> ship that was to take Him to New York. He was
> followed by about thirty believers who walked silently
> behind Him. I was one of them.26

Elsewhere Yazdi mentions the S.S. Cedric, on which the
Master embarked bound to the United States: “It was a
beautiful ship, one of two that plied regularly between
Alexandria and New York, stopping only at Naples.27 Of His
departure from the port of Alexandria, Ma˙múd-i-Zarqání
writes:

> The ship left the port of Alexandria with a burst of
> steam and great fanfare. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s companions
> numbered six: Shoghi Effendi, Siyyid Asadu’lláh-i-
> Qumí, Dr Amínu’lláh Faríd,28 Mírzá Munír-i-Zayn, Áqá
> Khusraw and this servant.29

Ma˙múd tells that the Master was sad, because He had just
received the news that His third daughter, Rú˙á Khánum, was
seriously sick. He also tells that the physician on the ship was an
Italian and misidentified them as Turks. The doctor immediately
gave them trouble because of the health of Khusraw’s eyes. He
said that they were affected by trachoma. In Naples other
Italian doctors confirmed his diagnosis and said that the eyes of
Shoghi Effendi and Mírzá Munír-i-Zayn also were affected by
the same disease and that the American authorities would have
never permitted them to enter the U.S.A. Therefore the Master,
given also the fact that the same Dr Faríd agreed with the Italian
doctors, asked the three to disembark at Naples and to go back
to the Holy Land. Yazdi remembers that in Ramleh Shoghi
Effendi had been “in seventh heaven. He had heard so much
about America, and he longed to be with the Master as He
traveled throughout North America and gave the Message. He
looked forward with great anticipation to the experience ... He
was extremely happy.”30 Rú˙íyyih Rabbani (1910-2000), the wife
of the Guardian, says about this episode of the life of her
husband:

> One can well imagine what heart-break this brought to a
> boy of fifteen, setting out on the first great adventure
> of his life, how much more to Shoghi Effendi, so
> attached to his grandfather, so excited over the trip on

The story of this travel in North-America and later in Europe is
not our concern. In July 1913 Ahmad Sohrab, who came back

from the United States together with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, wrote to
Star of the West:

> On 17 June 1913 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá arrived at Port Said
> aboard the steamship Himalaya. From there he sent a
> telegram instructing many pilgrims to come to Port
> Said. As there was not enough room to receive them in
> the hotel in which he was staying, a tent was erected on
> the roof for the purpose.32

He was accompanied by Siyyid Asadu’lláh-i-Qumí, Mírzá `Alí-
Akbar-i-Nakhjavání, Mírzá Ma˙mud-i-Zarqání and Ahmad
Sohrab.33

‘Abdu’l-Bahá remained in Port Said from 17 June to 11 July
1913\. He left the town because of its heat and humidity and
went to Ismailia, where He stayed in the hotel of a certain Mr.
J. Bosta. His health did not improve. Therefore on 17 July He
went to Alexandria. Here He stayed for two weeks in Hotel
Victoria in Ramleh. Then He rented a villa close to Mazlúm
Páshá Station. Ahmad Sohrab describes a number of details of
that sojourn. On 13 August he describes one of the most
common occupations of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, writing Tablets to
believers and non-believers:

> When I returned from Alexandria in the afternoon I
> was told that the Master had asked for me. I went
> immediately to the garden. Seeing me standing near the
> door, he permitted me to enter and to take a seat. He
> was walking in the avenue fronting a most charming

> Shohgi [sic] Effendi was there also. For nearly three
> hours, the limpid stream of revelation flowed to irrigate
> the parched ground of hearts in distant climes! Just as
> the sun was sinking behind the western horizon, he
> revealed a most touching prayer. His voice was like the
> music of the spheres, now chanting in a clear rich voice,
> now in a low, sweet undertone. The effect made us
> forgetful of everything. The dusk of the evening, the
> murmur of the breeze through the roses and trees, the
> unbroken calmness of the atmosphere, the spiritual

> beauty of the presence of the Master, and then as we
> looked up, the twinkling stars all combined to weave
> around our hearts a garland of spiritual enchantment!
> We were in reality worshiping the glorious King of
> Kings in the holiest moment of our lives! The prayer
> was a supplication to the throne of the Almighty for the
> purification of souls and the spiritualization of hearts,
> — in order that men might sing the praises of their
> Lord, and cause the ringing cries of “Ya Baha El Abha”
> to ascend from their meeting places to the Supreme
> Concourse. As we left the garden, I carried with me that
> wonderful prayer of the Beloved! On the wings of Light
> it had ascended to the throne of the Almighty and had
> been accepted by the Ruler of Mankind.34

Sohrab’s diary also illustrates other aspects of the Master’s
daily life in those days. On 4 August Sohrab writes that early in
the morning he “was summoned by the Beloved” together with
other friends and thus he went to His house. When he arrived
there

> ... the door opened and we were bidden to the Master’s
> writing room. As we sat there we heard Shoghi Effendi
> chanting with pathos and sweetness. As he ended the
> prayer suddenly I heard the voice of the Master. I was
> on my feet. What marvelous depth of feeling! It causes
> the stones to dance with joy! He was teaching Shoghi
> Effendi how to chant and how to control his voice
> under various expressions ....35

On 18 September he writes:

> It was a hot day, but the rose-garden is always cool, the
> fresh breeze wafting. The master asked Shoghi Effendi
> to bring him a bottle of Evian water. Meanwhile an
> Arab, who is a laborer, came in and saluted him. The

> Bahai world will receive a rich and valuable treasure
> when her Diary is given out.36

On 30 September 1913 Ahmad Sohrab’s diary comes to a
conclusion. Balyuzi gives but a short description of those days.
He informs us that the Master did not feel good in Ramleh and
thus He moved for a few days to Abúqír. This may have
happened in November 1913. Since His health did not improve
and the friends in the Holy Land were begging Him to come
back, He decided to return to Haifa.37 Star of the West does
not give any information about the Master’s sojourn in Egypt
in those months. Only the issue of 19 January 1914 publishes a
letter written on 27 December 1913 by H. Imogene Hoagg
(1869-1945), an American believer that visited several times
Italy, to Charles Mason Remey (1874-1974).38 This letter
describes the Master’s arrival in Haifa. Ali M. Yazdi writes that
on 2 December 1913 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá left Alexandria and returned
to the Holy Land.39 He arrived in Haifa on 5 December. Of His
presence in Egypt we have no photograph. Indeed, as Balyuzi
remarks, after the Master’s earliest photographs taken in
Adrianople in 1867 when He was a young man, “there were none
until He reached London in 1911.”40

Egyptian cities and towns visited by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá

The first Egyptian town visited by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was Port
Said. He sojourned there when He arrived in the country,
during September and October 1910. He was again in Port Said
from 17 June 1913, when He arrived on the S.S. Himalaya back
from His long trip in North America and Europe, to 11 July of
the same year, when He moved to Ismailia. The place where He
spent more time was Alexandria, precisely the suburb of

Ramleh. He arrived there in October 1910 and remained until
May 1911, when He went to Cairo. He returned on 22 July 1911
and moved away bound to Europe on 11 August 1911. He came
back from Europe in early December 1911 and left on 25 March
1912 bound to North America via Naples. Finally He sojourned
in Ramleh from 17 July 1913 to 2 December of the same year,
except a short period in November that He spent in Abúqír.41
He also spent three months in Cairo, in the suburb of Zaytun,
from May 1911 to 22 July of the same year, a week in Ismailia,
from 11 to 17 July 1913, and a short time in Manßúra.42 Ahmad
Sohrab has written graphic descriptions of some of the Egyptian
towns that hosted ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

Port Said had become a town only after the opening of the
Suez Canal on 17 November 1869. Sohrab writes about it:

> Forty years ago there were only a handful of dingy
> hovels with half-naked Arabs. There was no trade, there
> were no houses, and no communication existed with the
> outside world. Almost all the area on which the present
> up-to-date city with its 60,000 busy inhabitants is built,
> is land reclaimed from the sea. When the Suez Canal
> joined the two mighty oceans together, Port Said
> became an international port, and from that date the
magical     progress     of    the     city   continued

uninterruptedly.

In 1910, when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá arrived there, Port Said was an
international center, inhabited not only by Egyptians, but also
by Europeans of different nationalities. Sohrab describes a feast
for the French Day of Independence:

> The European part of Port Said is decorated with
> thousands of Japanese lanterns, the French flag is seen
> everywhere, and everybody seems to enter into the
> spirit of celebration on this National Feast of the
> Republic of France. After sunset the principal avenues,
> the French Consulate, the Banks, firms and buildings
> are lighted up by electricity. The street in which the
> Eastern Exchange, Continental and Casino Palace
> Hotels are built, is a riot of music promenaders, Arabs,

> Greeks, Italians, English, German, and French.
> Everybody is out to have a good time and to see the
> sights. The avenue from one end to the other is wired,
> and a roof is constructed of Japanese lanterns. The
> trees also bear such luminous fruits.44

Sohrab also describes a Catholic procession in the town:

> To-day the French inhabitants had a gorgeous religious
> procession which started from their church. All the
> streets through which it passed were adorned with flags,
> bunting and Japanese lanterns. The priests were dressed
> in their pompous surplices of red, gold and silver. There
> were long lines of young girls dressed as angels, also a
> company of choir boys. The procession was brought to
> an end by a large statue of the Virgin Mary, holding the
> child, Jesus, in her arms. Of course thousands of Arabs
> left their work to gaze at this very spectacular sight of
> what they called “idol worship,” and not understanding
> the sacredness of these symbols, they poked fun and
> laughed in their sleeves. How sad is the ignorance of
> humanity!45

As to Alexandria, Sohrab writes:

> Alexandria to all intents and purposes is like a
> progressive American city. Its tall buildings, its large
> department stores, its clean avenues, its double-decked
> electric cars, its delightful parks, its electrically lighted
> boulevards and streets, its fine promenades around the
> seaport, are all signs of a wonderful prosperous spirit.
> As I passed along the streets it seemed as though I was
> walking on an avenue in New York, and I wondered at
> the magical transformations which had taken place since
> this city was burned to the ground during the Arabi
> [sic] revolution thirty-one years ago. The inhabitants of
> all nations, Greeks, Italians, French, Jews, English,
> Arabs, Persians, live here and associate with one another
> in perfect harmony.46

As a matter of fact ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sojourned in Ramleh, about
which Sohrab writes:

> Ramleh is a modern Egyptian town with all the
> conveniences of western civilization. It is a summer
> resort for the most important European officials in the
> service of the Egyptian Government, and also for the
> native Pashas. There are lovely parks, all kinds of hotels
> and splendid houses. We have a nice furnished
> apartment about two hundred yards from the residence
> of the Beloved.47

When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá arrived in Alexandria, He stayed at the
New Victoria Hotel (later Summer Palace Hotel). Sohrab
describes it as follows:

> From my room I see the great clock of the New Victoria
> Hotel, wherein the Beloved stayed from time to time.
> The manager with much pride shows to the guests the
> various rooms occupied by the Master. He knows
> something about the Cause, and recognizes the great
> honor and blessing bestowed upon him and his hotel.
> When the Master was here the last time, he gave two
> large feasts just before his departure for America.
> There are a few other hotels and houses in which the
> Beloved has lived periodically. The homes of the Pashas
> are really wonderful specimens of the best Renaissance
> architecture. They very much resemble the houses and
> villas I have seen at Nice. Wonderful palaces, furnished
> with a taste truly magnificent, and are enclosed within
> gardens, the beauty and charm of which rival the fairy-
> lands of the artists and the poets. These “villas” are
> surrounded by walls from two to four yards high. The
> principal avenues are macadamized and clean and the
> narrow streets are also very much like the garden paths
> of Nice. As one walks through them the perfume of the
> flowers is inhaled, the branches of the trees overhanging
> the walls give a cool, inviting shade and the climbing
> vines add to the charming verdancy. A man passing
> through the streets and observing the houses, sees all
> the windows tightly shut. The stranger may think that

> they are not inhabited, but on inquiring about this
> custom of closing the windows, he is politely informed
> that as the owner is Mohammedan, the blinds are
> drawn, so that no foreign eyes may gaze upon the dark
> beauties of the women.48

‘Abdu’l-Bahá also lived for three months, from May to 22

July 1911, in Cairo, in the district of Zaytun, recently become
famous for supposed Marian apparitions. Those apparitions of
lights were reportedly seen by thousands of people and
photographed.

In Ismailia the Master stayed from 11 to 17 July 1913, to
avoid the humid heat of Port Said. Sohrab describes it as
follows:

> There is a beautiful large park, lovely buildings, clean
> avenues and many electric lights. I was quite surprised
> at the size of the park with its big pine trees and
> flowers. We saw also the native quarter. The goats, the
> hens, the donkeys and the other animals live in the same
> room with the Arabs, making a peaceful family.49

As to Abúqír, a village on the Mediterranean Sea about 20

miles north-east of Alessandria, Europeans remember it for the
battle fought and won by Napoleon I in 1799 against the
Ottoman army. The Master stayed there only a few days. As to
Manßúra, it is a town located in the Nile delta region, on the
eastern bank of Damietta branch. Its name means the
victorious, in remembrance of a victory achieved by the
Egyptians against King Louis IX of France in 1249 during the
Seventh Crusade. Óájí Mírzá Óaydar-`Alí (1830ca.-1920),
known as the Angel of Carmel, who during his travels to teach
the Faith had spent ten years in the terrible prisons of Sudan,
lived there for many years since the time when Bahá’u’lláh was
confined in Adrianople (he may have gone there in 1866).
Sohrab’s diary that ends on 20 September 1913 does not
mention either Abúqír or Manßúra.

The Holy Family

Members of the Holy Family visited a few times their
Beloved during His stay in Egypt. As has been said, the Master
called Shoghi Effendi in September 1910. Then Shoghi Effendi
returned to the Holy Land to attend his school. In April 1911,
Shoghi Effendi was once more with his Grandfather, in Ramleh.
We learn this detail from Gregory, who writes in his diary:
“Before entering we met Shoghi and Rouhi, two beautiful boys,
the grandsons of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. These children of the Holy
household show great affection for pilgrims.”50 Shoghi Effendi
also was with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in March 1912 when He embarked
on S.S. Cedric bound to America and remained on board with
Him as far as Naples. On 1 August 1913 Sohrab writes:

> the Greatest Holy Leaf, Abdul Baha’s sister, his
> daughter,51 Shoghi Effendi, and five or six others ...
> arrived from Haifa. The Beloved came to see us, sat for
> one hour, drank a cup of coffee, and then left us to
> return to his house to see the newcomers ...52

‘Abdu’l-Bahá had sent the Greatest Holy Leaf to Egypt in
1892 after Bahá’u’lláh’s ascension, together with His eldest
daughter, Îíyá Khánum (d.1951), so that she could recover,
after the severe blow of her Father’s loss. In that period she was
a guest of Óájí Mírzá Óasan-i-Khurásání. During the Master’s
absence from Haifa she administered the affairs of the Cause in
the Holy Land. Shoghi Effendi writes in this regard:

> And when, in pursuance of God’s inscrutable Wisdom,
> the ban on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s confinement was lifted and
> the Plan which He, in the darkest hours of His
> confinement, had conceived materialized, He with
> unhesitating confidence, invested His trusted and
> honoured sister with the responsibility of attending to
> the multitudinous details arising out of His protracted
> absence from the Holy Land.53

Elsewhere he more concisely writes:

> At the time of His absence in the western world, she
> was His competent deputy, His representative and
> vicegerent, with none to equal her.54

The Master’s daughters also visited their Father during His
sojourn in Egypt. For example, on 24 July 1913 Sohrab informs
us that ˇúbá Khánum (1880ca.-1959), the Master’s second
daughter, was in Ramleh with her Father55 and on 19 July 1913
he writes that Rú˙á Khánum, His third daughter, was coming to
Egypt.56 On 5 September Sohrab writes:

> Yesterday the Master’s daughter57 left for Cairo with
> Basheer,58 for a short stay. To-day Shoghi Effendi
> joined his mother with Haji Niaz.59 In the afternoon
> four Bahais arrived from Cairo.60

Baharieh Rouhani Ma’ani, a biographer of the women of the
Holy Family, hypothesizes that Munírih Khánum (1847-1938),
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s wife, also was among the members of the
family61 who, in Rú˙íyyih Rabbani’s words,

> hastened to His presence there [in Egypt], among them
> Shoghi Effendi, who joined Him about six weeks after
> His arrival ... arriving in the company of the Greatest
> Holy Leaf and others on 1 August in Ramleh, where
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had once again rented a villa.62

Like her sister in law, Munírih Khánum also had already been in
Egypt for health reasons, first in 1898ca. and then at the
beginning of the twentieth century.63 Finally, members of His
family were with Him in Ramleh when He left for New York.64

Although this person is not a member of the Holy Family, we
mention here the meeting between the Master and one of His
cousins on His Father’s side. On 1 July 1913 Sohrab writes:

> To-day two pilgrims arrived, Mirza Fazlollah, the son
> of the oldest brother of Baha-Ullah from Persia, and a
> young Bahai from Damascus. Upon hearing of the
> arrival of the son of his uncle, Abdul Baha called him
> into his presence and showered much love upon him. I
> was not there to witness the scene and to hear his

> words. But Ali Akbar [Nakhjavání] told me that the
> Master spoke about his childhood days. Things that I
> should like to have heard.65

The public opinion

When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá arrived in Egypt, Egyptians knew very
little about Him and the Bahá’í Faith. They knew only what had
been reported by such authoritative, but prejudiced, sources, as
officers of the Iranian government, which had banished
Bahá’u’lláh from His own country, or Ottoman officers, who
had condemned Bahá’u’lláh to a perpetual exile in the prison-
city of ‘Akká. As a matter of fact, Egyptians had heard only
calumnies about the Faith. As soon as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá arrived in
Egypt, He was immediately able to prove that those rumors
were wrong. Indeed, such was His personal charm, that He won
the esteem and friendship of all the major personages of the
country, whom He repeatedly met during mutual cordial visits.
He met “clerics, aristocrats, administrators, parliamentarians,
men of letters, journalists and publicists, Arabs, Turks and
Persians, who sought His presence. The poor and the deprived
also had access to Him and went away happy.”66 During His stay
in Egypt ‘Abdu’l-Bahá received many guests, but He never
delivered a public talk. However, as a blog on His travels in the
West remarks, “the little the Egyptian press published about
Him or about His talks given in other countries was ... rich
enough to be considered by historians and writers as a public
proclamation of the Bahá’í Faith, which in those days was
referred to also as the Bábí Faith.”67

Siyyid Asadu’lláh wrote to Star of the West in this regard:

> Also, distinguished editors of Arabic and Persian
> newspapers, such as Moaid [Mu’ayyad] and Tchehre
> Nema [Chihrih Nama], have talked with him and
> afterward wrote and published columns of praise and
> commendation on his Teachings and greatness. Thus the
> newspapers have given great publicity to the
> Movement. In regard to the Moaid [Mu’ayyad] article,
> Abdul Baha says: “A clipping from the newspaper of

> Egypt and its editor well known throughout the world
> for his learning, is enclosed. Formerly, this person,
> through the instigation of some influential resident
> Persians, wrote many articles against this Cause and
> called the Bahais infidels. But when Abdul Baha arrived

> There is no doubt that this trip is fraught with

Century of Light remarks:

> To some extent the way had no doubt been paved by
> warm admiration for the Master on the part of Shaykh
> Mu˙ammad ‘Abduh, who had met Him on several
> occasions in Beirut and who subsequently became Mufti
> of Egypt and a leading figure at Al-Azhar University.69

Mu˙ammad Abdúh (1849-1905) was an Islamic liberal
reformer and teacher, initially the editor of the official gazette
of the Egyptian government, Al Waqa’i’ Al Misríyya (Egyptian
facts), which was founded in 1828, the first Egyptian
newspaper. Exiled from Egypt in 1882, when he went back to
his country, he was a teacher in the ancient al-Azhar University,
founded in 970ca. which took its name, “the luminous,” from a
title of Fatima, Mu˙ammad’s daughter, called az-zahra, the
brilliant. He also was Great Mufti of Egypt, the second highest
religious position in the country. He is remembered as one of
the greatest Egyptian thinkers and reformers. In the 1880s while
he was in exile in Beirut he met ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and was influenced
by His words, coming to think that Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings
could save Egyptian society from the ills by which it was

afflicted. Therefore he attempted a reform of the Shari’ah, but
his plans were frustrated by the opposition of the
conservatives.70

The press coverage

As soon as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá arrived in Egypt, the main
newspapers of the country immediately began to publish articles
on His visit. On 19 September 1910, Al-Ahram (The pyramids),
founded in 1875, then pro-French and today the most popular
Egyptian newspaper, published the news of the unexpected visit
to the country of the “leader of the Bábí Faith.” The article said:

> Abbas Effendi left His residence in the city of ‘Akká a
> few days ago for Port Said, an event that has
> precipitated His Persian followers residing in Egypt to
> hasten to that city to be blessed by visiting Him. This
> surprise visit has given rise to speculation and
> controversial claims between His opponents and
> supporters about its motive. The former have alleged
> He left ‘Akká out of fear of what may come upon Him
> from the new constitutional Turkish regime. His
> followers, strongly deny these uncorroborated
> allegations. In fact, He came to Egypt for health
> reasons because the air of Egypt is indicated as a cure
> for His asthmatic attacks caused by His long
> incarceration.71

Despite this article, a few unfriendly personages questioned
the opportunity of the visit of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Egypt. After
about a month, on 16 October, the editor of Al-Mu’ayyad (“the
victorious” or “the supporter”), a nationalist newspaper,
founded in 1889, very popular in those years, answered their
questions. This editor was the skillful Shaykh `Alí Yusif, who
had previously criticized the Bahá’ís and their faith, suggesting
to take firm measures against them. He met the Master in
Ramleh and after that meeting he wrote: “His Eminence Mirza
‘Abbas Effendi, the learned and erudite Head of the Bahá’ís in
‘Akká and the Centre of authority for Bahá’ís throughout the
world, has reached the shores of Alexandria.”72 At first, related

the writer, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stayed in the Victoria Hotel, but after
a few days moved to a rented house. Then he went on to
explain:

> He is a venerable person, dignified, possessed of
> profound knowledge, deeply versed in theology, master
> of the history of Islam, and of its denominations and
> developments ... whosoever has consorted with Him has
> seen in Him a man exceedingly well-informed, Whose
> speech is captivating, Who attracts minds and souls,
> dedicated to belief in the oneness of mankind ... His
> teaching and guidance revolve round the axis of
> relinquishing prejudices: religious, racial, patriotic.73

Shaykh Yusif said that he twice went to see ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and
during those interviews learned that His coming had absolutely
no political motive, for “he ‘does not interfere in political
matters;’ His ‘stay in Egypt is for health reasons.’” The news
report concluded with a warm reiteration of welcome to the
learned and wise Visitor, and wished Him a happy stay and
recovery of good health.74

Al-Muqa††am, a pro-British newspaper founded in 1888

which took its name from a chain of hills south-east of Cairo,
and which in those years was the most eminent among the
Egyptian newspapers, published on 28 November 1910 an
appreciative report. The nationalist semiweekly Wadía’n-Níl
(the Valley of the Nile), founded in 1867 and sometimes
considered as the first private newspaper in Egypt, did the same
and published many praises of the Master. Even the Persian
illustrated weekly journal Chihrih-Nama, published in Egypt
between 1904 and 1950, praised Him. Balyuzi writes in this
regard:

> Its editor, Mirza ‘Abdu’l-Mu˙ammad-i-Írání, the
> Mu’addibu’s-Sul†án [the Preceptor of the Sovereign],
> had in the past, in common with many of his
> countrymen resident in Egypt, displayed feelings far
> from friendly. Now he reported ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s travels
> with respect and admiration.75

On 19 January 1911 Al-Ahram spoke once more about the
Master. It wrote:

> His reverence Abbas Effendi, the head of the Bábí
> Faith, is still visiting and being visited, with much
> veneration, by senior officials and high ranking
> individuals. He is the son of Bahá’u’lláh, and His
> successor, and a descendant of a noble Persian lineage.
> Kindness and love to all regardless of social rank or
> religious affiliation are His distinguishing attributes for
> He looks at the unifying force latent in the humanity of
> all people and not at their diverse beliefs or worldly
> conditions.76

Balyuzi mentions a last article on the Master of the Egyptian
Gazette of 27 June 1913, entitled “‘Abdul Baha in Egypt.
Wonderful Scenes in Port Said. Eastern Bahais Assembled in
Force.”77 The article also said: “At Port Said the pilgrims have
erected a huge tent on the roof of a native hotel and there they
gather and sing with touching devotion.”78

Personages

Of the many personages that attained the presence of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Egypt, only the most important will be
mentioned. Easterners will be listed as first. In 1910-1911 in
Alexandria an old enemy of the Faith, Mírzá Mu˙ammad-Mihdí
Khán, the Za’imu’d-Dawlih [Chief of the State], a Persian
politician who had published in 1903 a critical history of the
Bábí Movement, called repeatedly on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and showed
great reverence towards Him. In Cairo, Shaykh Mu˙ammad
Bakhit, the Mufti of Egypt, and Shaykh Mu˙ammad Rishád, the
Imam of the Khedive, visited Him and He returned their visit.
In Cairo He met Jurji (Giorgio) Zaydan (1861-1914), an eminent
Lebanese, Christian writer, the editor of the journal Dar al-Hilal
(The Crescent), later transformed into a publishing house that
still exists today. Zaydan was proud of his Arabic background
and wrote a book entitled The Flying Mameluch, a popular work
of Arabic history.

The most important meeting in Cairo was that with the
Khedive, ‘Abbás Óilmí II (1874-1944), who showed a special
reverence towards the Master. Balyuzi says that the two
personages met twice. The organizer of those meetings was
‘Uthmán Páshá Murta∂á, the Khedive’s chamberlain, and
Balyuzi remarks that he

> was devoted to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ... A Tablet which
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá addressed to ‘Uthmán Páshá in October
> 1919 (five years after ‘Abbás Óilmí was deposed) is
> indicative of the stature of the man: he is called ‘Amír-
> al-wafa’ — the Prince of Fidelity.79

The Master met once more the Khedive in Ramleh in 1913. On
15 August 1913 Ahmad Sohrab writes in this regard:

> During our absence in the afternoon, Osman Pasha, one
> of the Ministers of the Khedive, called on the Master
> conveying the loving greetings of the Ruler of Egypt
> and his longing to meet him. The date was then fixed
> for the afternoon of August 17th. His Highness the
> Khedive is now staying in Alexandria. His summer
> resort is near Ramleh. He lives in one of his palaces
> fronting the sea called Raas-ottin [Ras at-Tín]. The
> Khedive is friendly to the Bahai Movement and has
> special regard for the Master. It may be that history will
> record that he is one of the few Oriental Rulers who has
> received Abdul Baha with due honor.80

On 17 August he records:

> This was an important date in the Bahai calendar
> because Abdul Baha and the ruler of Egypt met each
> other for the second or third time. Beyond this bare
> announcement I have no other information. The Master
> may give us, later, an account of the meeting, and thus
> in our imagination we may construct a picture, or he
> may not divulge any of the details. None of the
> believers were with him. For the present it is enough to
> know that on this day, between three and six p.m., the

> sovereign of Egypt had the honor and privilege of
> talking with Abdul Baha.81

On 4 September 1913 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had a visit from Prince
Mu˙ammad `Alí, (1875-1955), the Khedive’s brother and the
heir to the throne. The Prince had already attained the presence
of the Master, first in Egypt in 1912, then in New York on 22
July 1912,82 then again in Paris in 1913 and finally during the
Master’s travel to Egypt the Prince was with Him for four days,
on 12-16 June 1913. He admired so much ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that he
considered Him as “the most important man in our century.”83
And he loved Him so much that he called Him “‘Abbás Bábá’
which in Arabic means ‘Abbás Father or Father ‘Abbás.”84
Sohrab describes their meeting in Ramleh as follows:

> In the afternoon Prince Mohamad Ali, the brother of
> the Khedive, called on Abdul Baha. The Prince arrived
> in his automobile at the door of our house, and hearing
> that the Master lived close by in another one, said that
> he would walk to it. Mirza Moneer was about to go on
> ahead to notify Abdul Baha, when he appeared in his
> long, loose, cream-colored coat from the other side of
> the street. Thus, in the middle of the road, the Master
> and the Prince met, each offering to the other
> courtesies designated for the most distinguished men.
> Every one looking at this strange scene wondered, while
> trying to imagine what had brought a royal Prince of
> Egypt to the Threshold of Abbas Effendi. The Master
> was walking ahead and the Prince a few feet behind, and
> while they were talking in the most animated manner,
> they disappeared from our view.85

Ahmad Sohrab also describes the Egyptian Páshás’ admiration
for the Master, though words uttered by one of them:

> We have produced in the Orient a man such as Abbas
> Effendi, who alone visited Europe and America, and
> who through the sheer force of his personality and the
> wonderful soundness and brilliancy of his philosophy,
> captivated the pulpits and platforms, revolutionized the
> current of western thoughts, opened before your faces

> vistas of glorious ideals, and drew to his audiences
> thousands of men and women who were deeply
> attracted to his humane and divine wisdom, while the
> Press of the West from one end to another had but one
> tongue by which to praise his many virtues and to
> elucidate his system of religion and philosophy. Yes, we
> are proud of him. We honor him because he comes
> from the heart of the Orient. He represents us, he
> utters our ideals and longings. You have never sent us a
> man who could travel in the Orient and deliver lectures
> as Abbas Effendi has done in the West.86

In Egypt the Master also received Khájih Óasan Nizamí
(1879-1955), an Indian scholar and mystic of the Chistí Sufi
order, a prolific writer, an upholder of Islam in India, who later
translated the Seven Valleys into Urdu.87 Finally, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
met in Ramleh the well-known Egyptian writer ‘Abbás Ma˙múd
Al-‘Aqqad (1889-1964), the author of about a hundred books of
philosophy, religion and poetry, famous for his flourished
prose. In the years 1980s the Egyptian television produced a TV
series on his life, titled The Giant. ‘Aqqad has left a description
of that meeting titled “An hour with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.”88 Last but
not least, Sohrab’s diary records on 24 September 1913:

> Yesterday the new Persian Consul General arrived from
> Constantinople and the Master sent all the students to
> welcome him at the steamer and to-day, with Mirza Ali
> Akbar [Nakhjavání], he went to Alexandria to pay him
> a visit, in the hotel where he is staying for a few days
> before his departure for Jadda. In the course of
> conversation Abdul Baha pointed out to the Consul
> General the impartial attitude of the Bahais in recent
> developments in Persia and how they are the lovers of
> Peace and progress. The mission of the Bahai Cause is
> universal and not local; its principles are for all
> humanity; its objects are world-wide. The Bahais are the
> army of spiritual and intellectual advancements. Then
> he spoke a few words about the promotion of the Cause
> in America and Europe. The Consul General became
> very attracted, and made an engagement to come next
> day and call on the Master.89

As to the Westerners, we remember the English Wellesley
Tudor Pole (1884-1968) who visited the Master in Ramleh in the
second half of November 1910. Tudor Pole is remembered as a
writer, a philosopher, a mystic and a life-long lover of religious
experiences, mystic visions and spiritualism. He also is
remembered because, along with Winston Churchill, he was the
deviser of the silent minute, which the people of Britain
observed during the Second World War (1939-1945) every
evening at 9 pm. After that meeting he accepted the Faith, but
later on became estranged from it, when Shoghi Effendi began
to build its Administrative Order. During the First World War
Tudor Pole was a major of the British army. He learnt of the
perils hanging over the Master because of the hate of the
Turkish commander, Jamál Páshá, and urged the British military
authority to protect Him. In December 1910 he published his
interview with the Master on the journal Christian
Commonwealth (28 December 1910), later reprinted by Star of
the West.90 Star of the West also published a part of a letter
describing Tudor Pole’s meeting with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

> You may be interested in hearing of my recent visit to
> Abdu’l-Bahá at Ramleh, near Alexandria. I spent nine
> days at Alexandria and Cairo during the second half of
> November, 1910. Abdu’l-Bahá’s health had very greatly
> improved since his arrival from Port Said. He was
> looking strong and vigorous in every way. He spoke
> much of the work in America, to which he undoubtedly
> is giving considerable thought. He also spoke a good
> deal about the work that is going forward in different
> European centres as well as in London, and he expects
> great things from England during the coming year ... A
> Bahai paper is to be read at the Universal Races
> Congress in London next July.91

In Cairo ‘Abdu’l-Bahá met Ronald Storrs, in those days
Oriental Secretary of the British Agency and later knighted.
Storr had known ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in 1909 in the Holy Land. Now
in Egypt, in his own words, he “had the honour of looking after
him and of presenting him to Lord Kitchener.”92 Lord Horatio
Herbert Kitchener (1850-1916), was the British Agent and
Consul-General (de facto administrator) in Egypt. In 1898 he

had conquered Sudan and therefore he was known as Lord
Kitchener of Khartoum. Sir Storrs writes that Lord Kitchener
“was deeply impressed by his personality, as who could fail to
be?”93

Sometimes between 1910 and 1913 the Russian playwright
Isabella Grinevskaya (1864-1944) attained the presence of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. After that meeting, Grinevskaya accepted the
Faith, to which she remained faithful for the rest of her life,
keeping in touch with Eastern and Western Bahá’ís. She is
remembered for the many books she published, in which she
described the life of the Jews of the middle class and especially
the situation of young intellectual Jew women. She wrote a play
titled The Báb, which was performed in St. Petersburg in 1904
and in 1916-1917. The play was translated into French and
praised by Tolstoy. She also wrote an essay about her meeting
with the Master and a poem and play titled Bahá’u’lláh. This
play was never performed.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence was also attained by Rustum
Vambery, the son of the famous Arminius, the Jew Hungarian
intellectual (ca. 1832-1913) whom the Master met in Budapest
on 12 April 1912.94 Arminius Vambery was a traveler, an
orientalist and a polyglot. A number of scholars maintain that
the personage of Professor Van Helsing in Bram Stoker’s novel
Dracula (1897) was inspired by Vámbéry. As a matter of fact,
Chapter 23 of the novel mentions a “friend Arminius of Buda-
Pesth.”

Resident and visiting Bahá’ís

Among the many Bahá’ís who lived in Egypt in those days the
chronicles mention especially Mírzá Óasan Khurasání of
Alexandria, who in 1892 had the honor of hosting Bahíyyih
Khánum and Mohammed Yazdi (1848-1933), whom Gregory
describes as “an oriental gentleman of pleasing manners and
placid countenance.”95 The Bahá’í historian Graham Hassall also
mentions Óájí Mírzá Óaydar-`Alí.96 Among the Bahá’ís in Egypt
during the Master’s visits there also was a very distinguished
personage, Mírzá Abu’l-Fadl-i-Gulpáygání (1844-1914), known
for his broad culture and his deep studies of the Bahá’í Faith,

one of the 19 Apostles of Bahá’u’lláh. He went to Cairo in July
1895, and was a lecturer of al-Azhar University. Between 1901
and 1904 he traveled through Europa and North America, to
strengthen the new Bahá’ís. When the Master went to Egypt, the
Master often invited him at his presence. Ahmad Sohrab
repeatedly describes their meetings. Isabel Fraser also describes
his presence in Ramleh, where the Master had asked him to come
to enjoy his company.97

The chronicles also mention Shaykh Faraju’lláh Zakí al-Kurdí,
a Kurdish Bahá’í who lived in Cairo. He is the author of the
well-known compilation of prayers by Bahá’u’lláh in Persian and
Arabic, beside the Persian Hidden Words, Ad’iyih-’i Óa∂rat-i
Ma˙búb (Prayers of the Beloved). He also published the Kitáb-i-
Íqán, three volumes of Tablets by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, a collection of
talks delivered by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Europe and America and
other important Bahá’í texts. He translated into Arabic the
Tablet of Ishráqát and submitted his translation to the Master.
Shoghi Effendi writes in this regard:

> So great is the importance and so supreme is the
> authority of these assemblies that once ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
> after having himself and in his own handwriting
> corrected the translation made into Arabic of the
> Ishraqat (the Effulgences) by Sheikh Faraj, a Kurdish
> friend from Cairo, directed him in a Tablet to submit
> the above-named translation to the Spiritual Assembly
> of Cairo, that he may seek from them before
> publication their approval and consent.98

As to Westerners, as has been said, Louis Gregory, an
American negro who had accepted the faith in 1909 and the first
Hand of the Cause of his race, was invited by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and
stayed in Ramleh from 10 April to 4 May 1911. In his diary of
this pilgrimage he describes the house of the Master as “a
modest but comfortable-appearing house with a front garden.”
He lists the persons who were present during his first meeting
with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: “Tamaddun ul Molk and Nouraddin Zaine,
Persians, and Nevill G. Meakin and Miss Louisa A. M. Mathew
(afterwards Mrs. Louis G. Gregory), English.” In this booklet he
describes again the Person of the Master:

> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá appeared about the medium height, with a
> strong frame and symmetrical features. His face is
> deeply furrowed and His color about that of
> parchment. His carriage is erect and His entire form
> strikingly majestic and beautiful. His hands and nails
> are shapely and pure. His silver hair is long enough to
> touch the shoulders. The beard is snow white, the eyes
> light blue and penetrating, the nose slightly aquiline.
> The voice is powerful, but capable of infinite pathos,
> tenderness and sympathy. His dress was that of the
> Oriental gentleman of the highest classes, simple and
> neat and very graceful. The color of His apparel was
> light, the outer robe being made of alpaca. On His head
> rested a light fez, surrounded by a white turban. The
> meekness of the servant, the majesty of the king, are in
> His brow and form.

As to Louisa Matthew (1866-1956), she was an English
believer of a well-to-do family, graduated from Cambridge. She
had gone to Paris to continue her musical studies and there
accepted the Faith in the early twentieth century. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
introduced Louis G. Gregory to her in Ramleh in April 1911. On
27 September 1912 He Himself married the two. It was a happy
marriage, but filled with difficulties because of their different
races. The two told that, during their travels, they were often
obliged to stay at different hotels. Louisa devotedly served the
Faith for all her life especially in Central Europe (Sofia,
Bulgaria).

In those years also Edith MacKaye de Bons (1878-1959) lived
in Egypt. This American lady went to Paris to study voice.
There she met May Bolles Maxwell (1870-1940). Their meeting
took place on 1899 Christmas Day and Edith became the first
person who was brought to the Faith by May Bolles in the
French capital. Edith later moved to Sion, Switzerland, because
she had married Dr Joseph de Bons (1871–1959), a local dentist.
The de Bons lived in Egypt for a few years and in 1911 they had
the honor of attaining the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Ahmad
Sohrab writes in his diary of 29 July 1913:

> In the afternoon I called on the Beloved and in his
> presence found DeBons, a French Bahai dentist
> practicing in Cairo — now on his way to Switzerland to
> meet his wife. Abdul Baha is going to take him for a
> drive through Nozha Park, which is the National Park of
> Alexandria. I have heard much praise of it, but have not
> yet been there. They say it rivals any park in Europe or
> America. For nearly two hours Abdul Baha entertained
> the doctor driving through the park and speaking to
> him about his spiritual experiences in America.99

Sohrab’s diary also informs us of the arrival of other
believers come to Egypt to see ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. On 13 July 1913
Sohrab mentions Mrs. Jean Stannard, an English believer and a
travel teacher, who in 1921 translated the Hidden Words into
English, a translation highly appreciated by Shoghi Effendi. In
1925 she founded in Geneva the International Bahá’í Bureau,
later managed by Imogene Hoagg. The Bahá’í International
Community writes in this regard:

> The International Bahá’í Bureau served as a gathering
> place for Bahá’ís traveling to Geneva for the activities
> of the League of Nations and of other international
> organizations, and published an international magazine.100

In 1929 the International Bahá’í Bureau was recognized by
the League of Nations. Sohrab writes about Mrs. Stannard:

> Mrs. J. Stannard, an English Bahai, is back in Port Said
> and may stay with us for several days. I had a most
> pleasant conversation with her about the progress of
> the Cause in Germany and England. The Master may
> send her to India. She is a very active and energetic
> worker and no doubt will be able to spread the Bahai
> movement very effectively.101

On 24 July 1913 Lua Getsinger (1871-1916), the Herald of
the Covenant and one of the 19 Disciples of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
arrived in Egypt.102 Sohrab writes in this regard:

> This morning the Beloved sent for me. He was feeling
> well. Mrs. Getsinger was called into the room and the
> plan of her journey to India discussed. Since her arrival
> she has been living with Abdul Baha’s family which is
> presided over by the Greatest Holy Leaf!103

Sohrab informs us that the Master did not want Lua to go to
India alone and thus summoned Mrs. Isabel Fraser Chamberlain
(1871-1939), the compiler of a collection of talks delivered by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Europe, known as Abdu’l-Bahá on Divine
Philosophy, published in 1917 in Boston by the publisher The
Tudor Press. Sohrab’s diary of 18 September 1913 records:

> In the afternoon Abdul Baha passed by, followed by
> Shoghi Effendi. He called for me and I walked behind
> him in the rose-garden. A telegram sent to Port Said
> from the Master to Ahmad Yazdi: “Send Mrs. Fraser to
> Ramleh,” brought back the answer that she had left at
> one o’clock. He told me to go with Shoghi Effendi to
> the station and bring her home. We were expecting her
> for a few days. I was delighted to hear the news.104

In the same day Sohrab writes he went and fetch her at the
station together with Shoghi Effendi.

On 22 September Sohrab announced the arrival of Dr.

Edward Getsinger (1866-1935), Lua Getsinger’s husband, one of
the first pilgrims in December 1898, a faithful servant of the
Cause, who published the first collection of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Writings in English. Sohrab records many anecdotes of the
meeting of the Master with the Bahá’ís who hastened to Egypt
to see Him. We like to conclude this short note on those visits
of devoted pilgrims with a detail from Sohrab’s diary:

> One of the pilgrims — El Yahou, an old man — had
> brought with him from Cairo a bouquet of fragrant
> white flowers and six white fezes for the Master. He
> stayed with us last night and kept our party in a good
> humor until very late. In the morning he wanted the
> flowers and fezes to be taken to the Master, which I did
> with great pleasure. I knocked at the door, and the

> beloved opened it. He took the bundle out of my hand
> and told me that he would send for him in a few
> minutes.105

Meanings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence in Egypt

‘Abdu’l-Bahá may have chosen Egypt as the headquarters of
His travels in the West first of all because it was near enough to
the Holy Land to enable Him to see what the Covenant-Breakers
would do in His absence and, in case of extreme necessity, to
quickly go back home. In the meantime, the climate of Egypt,
much healthier than that of ‘Akká and Haifa, would have
alleviated the consequences of the numerous afflictions that
troubled His body, as for example His asthmatic attacks.
Moreover in Egypt there was a flourishing Bahá’í community
and the relations between that community and the Bahá’í
community in the Holy Land had always been very close.

The consequences of His presence in Egypt have been very
important. First of all, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá could personally deny,
through His wisdom and the mysterious charm emanating for
His Person, all the calumnies on the Bahá’í community and on
Himself, which external and internal enemies of the Faith had
spread through the country. The importance of the Master’s
sojourn in Egypt is explained by Century of Light as follows:

> An aspect of the Egyptian sojourn that deserves special
> attention was the opportunity it provided for the first
> public proclamation of the Faith’s message. The
> relatively cosmopolitan and liberal atmosphere
> prevailing in Cairo and Alexandria at the time opened a
> way for frank and searching discussions between the
> Master and prominent figures in the intellectual world
> of Sunni Islam. These included clerics, parliamentarians,
> administrators and aristocrats. Further, editors and
> journalists    from      influential     Arabic-language
> newspapers, whose information about the Cause had
> been coloured by prejudiced reports emanating from
> Persia and Constantinople, now had an opportunity to
> learn the facts of the situation for themselves.

Publications that had been openly hostile changed their

> tone. The editors of one such newspaper opened an
> article on the Master’s arrival by referring to “His
> Eminence Mírzá ‘Abbás Effendi, the learned and
> erudite Head of the Bahá’ís in ‘Akká and the Centre of
> authority for Bahá’ís throughout the world” and
> expressing appreciation of His visit to Alexandria. This
> and other articles paid particular tribute to ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá’s understanding of Islam and to the principles of
> unity and religious tolerance that lay at the heart of His
> teachings.106

Last but not least, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá met many important Western
personages, who later spoke about Him to their relatives and
friends in Europe, both through letters and personally during
their visit to their countries. Century of Light writes in this
regard:

> Despite the Master’s ill health that had caused it, the
> Egyptian interlude proved to be a great blessing.
> Western diplomats and officials were able to observe at
> first-hand the extraordinary success of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
> interaction with leading figures in a region of the Near
> East that was of lively interest in European circles.
> Accordingly, by the time the Master embarked for
> Marseilles on 11 August 1911, His fame had preceded
> Him.107

The Universal House of Justice summarizes the main aspects
of the presence of the Master in Egypt and in the West in the
triennium 1910-1913 as follows:

> Uncompromising in defence of the truth, yet infinitely
> gentle in manner, He brought the universal divine
> principles to bear on the exigencies of the age. To all
> without distinction — officials, scientists, workers,
> children, parents, exiles, activists, clerics, sceptics — He
> imparted love, wisdom, comfort, whatever the
> particular need. While elevating their souls, He
> challenged their assumptions, reoriented their
> perspectives, expanded their consciousness, and focused
> their energies. He demonstrated by word and deed such

> compassion and generosity that hearts were utterly
> transformed. No one was turned away.108
