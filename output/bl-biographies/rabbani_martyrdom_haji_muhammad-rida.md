The Báb

The facts of this incident are simple and well-known. In 1889, the Bahá’í
Faith came to public attention in ‘Ishqabad as the result of an appalling
crime that involved the taking of the life of a prominent, elderly Bahá’í
by two assassins who had been hired by a group of Muslims resentful of
the commercial success of Bahá’í businessmen in their city and the rapid
spread of the Faith in the region. The Russian authorities arrested the
murderers and those suspected of involvement in the crime and,
subsequent to an official military trial held in ‘Ishqabad, they sentenced
most of them to death or long incarceration in Siberia. The Bahá’ís
petitioned the Governor to spare the lives of the perpetrators. The plea
was submitted to Czar Alexander III, who asked the Senate to consult
on it. The Senate decided to honor the request of the Bahá’ís for
clemency and the Czar agreed. It was publicly announced that a
reduction in the sentences was granted at the request of the Bahá’ís.
From that time, the Bahá’í community won all the unfettered right to
practice their religion without restriction and under the government’s
protection.

The importance of this incident was profound. For the first time
in the history of the nascent Bahá’í community, persecutors of its
members had been publicly tried, found guilty and subjected to
punishment under the law. Further, for the first time, the independence
of the Faith from its Islamic roots had been clearly established and
proclaimed by governmental officials acting on behalf of the state.

While it appears that the incident of the martyrdom specifically,
and the success of the Bahá’ís in ‘Ishqabad more broadly, had been

1   Selections from the Writings of the Báb, p. 90

2 The Martyrdom of Hájí Muhammad-Ridá

anticipated by Bahá’u’lláh, it also appears that the actions of the Bahá’í
community of ‘Ishqabad in the course of events immediately after the
martyrdom, first in collaborating closely with the authorities towards
ascertaining the truth of occurrences, and then in their effective
presentation at the trial and their ensuing magnanimity in pleading on
behalf of the convicts, were a source of great joy to Bahá’u’lláh. In a
number of Tablets during the final years of His life, Bahá’u’lláh made
mention of this incident and praised the Bahá’ís for the manner in which
they had conducted themselves. He was also exceedingly pleased with
the government of Russia and the impartial attitude of her officials in
administering justice.

The purpose of this monograph is to bring a number of primary
source documents about this incident to the attention of English
language readers. It is hoped that a close study of these documents will
provide a basis for a more thorough analysis of this singularly important
chapter in the Bahá’í history.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá2

‘Ishqabad (literally, the “city of love”) is the capital of Turkmenistan, a
Persian term meaning, the land of the Turkmen. The country is located
in Central Asia and is also known as Turkmenia.

The Martyrdom of Hájí Muhammad-Ridá 5

The ancient history of Turkmenistan is largely unknown, but its
known history can be traced to the arrival of Indo-European Iranian
tribes circa 2000 BC. Because of the arid conditions of the region, early
tribes were nomadic or semi-nomadic.

The region’s recorded history begins with its conquest by the
Achaemenid Empire of ancient Persia, which divided the area into three
administrative units. The region was later subjugated to the armies of
Alexander, then to the Parni and Ephthalites.

The Parthians, who were fierce, nomadic warriors from the north
of what is now Iran, established the kingdom of Parthia, which covered
present-day Turkmenistan and Iran. The Parthian kings ruled from the
city of Nisa, founded by Arsaces I (reigned c. 250-211 BC). Modern
excavations have revealed substantial buildings, mausoleums and shrines,
and many inscribed documents and artifacts, often decorated with
Iranian figures or classical mythological scenes. ‘Ishqabad was built only
10 miles from Nisa.

The Parthian Kingdom succumbed in 224 AD to the Sassanids –
rulers of Persia. At the same time, several tribal groups, including the
Alans and the Huns, were moving into Turkmenistan from the east and
north. A branch of the Huns wrested control of southern Turkmenistan
from the Sassanian Empire in the 5th century.

During this early phase of history, the majority of the region’s
inhabitants were either Zoroastrian or Buddhist, and the region was
largely populated by tribes from the area of modern Iran.

Central Asia came under Arab rule after a series of invasions in the
late 7th and early 8th centuries. The region was incorporated into the
Islamic Caliphate, and after this conquest all the peoples of Central Asia
gradually converted to Islam. The city of Merv was occupied by
lieutenants of the third caliph Uthman, and designated as the capital of
Khurasan. Using this city as their base, the Arabs brought under
subjection Balkh, Bukhara, and Kashgaria, and penetrated into China as
far as the province Kan-suh early in the 8th century.

Merv once again came into the political spotlight in 748 AD, when
Abu-Muslim (d. 750) declared a new Abbasid dynasty. He set out from
this city to conquer Iran and Iraq and, established a new capital at
Baghdad.

In the latter part of the 8th century, Merv became the centre of
heretical propaganda preached by al-Muqanna, “The Veiled Prophet of
Khurasan”. In 874, Arab rule in Central Asia came to an end. During
this period, Merv, Samarqand and Bukhara were sites of great schools of
learning, producing renowned scholars, like the celebrated historian
Yaqut who studied in Merv.

The Oghuz brought the Turkic Turkmen language that came to
dominate the area. The Turkic period was a time of cultural fusion, as
Islamic traditions brought by the Arabs merged with local cultures from
the region of current Iran and then were further altered by Turkic
invaders and rulers such as the Seljuks.

In 1040, the Seljuk Turks defeated Sultan Masud of the Ghaznavi
dynasty and founded the Seljukid dynasty, with its capital at Nishapur. It
was about this time that Merv reached the zenith of her glory.

In 1157, the rule of Seljuks dynasty came to an end in the province
of Khurasan. The Turkic rulers of Khiva took control of the area of
Turkmenistan, under the title of Khawrazmhah.

In 1221, Central Asia suffered a disastrous invasion by Mongol
warriors, who swept across the region from their base in eastern Asia.
Under their commander, Genghis Khan, the Mongols conquered
Khawrazm and burned the city of Merv to the ground. The Mongol
leader ordered the massacre of Merv’s inhabitants as well as the
destruction of the province’s farms and irrigation systems. The Turkmen
who survived the invasion retreated northward to the plains of
Kazakhstan or eastward to the shores of the Caspian Sea.

Small, semi-independent states arose under the rule of the region’s
tribal chiefs later in 14th century. In the 1370s, the Mongol leader Timur
The Lame, a self-proclaimed descendant of Genghis Khan, conquered
Turkmen states once more and established the short lived Timurid
Empire, which collapsed after Timur’s death in 1405, when Turkmen
became independent once again.

The history of Turkmenistan from the 16th until the 19th century
was determined by relations among the states of Persia, Khiva, and

Bukhara, and more specifically by the tension between Persia, which had
adopted Shi‘a Islam and the Turkmen, who were Sunni. This tension
often resulted in armed conflicts. On a number of occasions thousands
of Shi‘as were seized as prisoners and sold as slaves in Bukhara,
Samarqand and other towns of Turkmenistan.

Popular epics such as Korogly and other oral traditions, took
shape during this period, which could be taken as the beginning of the
Turkmen national culture. The poets and thinkers of the time such as
Devlet Mehmed Azadi and Makhtumkuli became voices for an emerging
nation, calling for unity, brotherhood and peace among Turkmen tribes.
Makhtumkuli is venerated in Turkmenistan as the father of its national
literature.

In the 18th century, Turkmen tribes came into contact with the
Czarist Empire. After the suppression of the Bukhara and Khiva
emirates, the Russians decided to move into the region in order to
subdue the Turkmen slave trade and banditry. By 1844, they reached the
Aral Sea; Tashkent was captured in 1865; Samarqand in 1868; and Khiva
in 1873.

By the end of the 1870s, the Russians were ready to occupy lands
immediately to the north of Khurasan. Despite Iran’s protests, the
Russian General Lomakin fought a campaign against the Geok Teppe
Turkmen in 1879 but was held back. The Transcaspian Railway was
started from the shores of the Caspian in the same year in order to
secure Russian control over the region and provide a rapid military route
to the Afghan border. Russia sent forces to Turkmenistan under General
Mikhail Skobelev, and in 1881 fighting climaxed with the massacre of
7,000 Turkmen at the desert fortress of Geok Depe, near modern
‘Ishqabad. Another 8,000 were killed trying to flee across the desert.

The border with Iran was fixed by an agreement in 1881, and from
this the Russian province of Transcaspia came into being. About four
hundred miles from the Caspian Sea, the Russians built a new city to be
the capital of the new province of Transcaspia. The name of this city was
3 The name of this city is spelled in different ways, including: Ashkabad, Ashgabat
(the official English transliteration of modern Turkmenistan), Askabad, Aşgabat,

Soon ‘Ishqabad developed. In order to encouragement settlement
in the new town, the government granted land to anyone willing to build.
Initially the population was predominantly Turkmen; yet before long
many Iranians, Azeris, Russians, a few Afghanis and people of other
nationalities migrated to the region seeking security, prosperity and a
better life. The population of ‘Ishqabad expanded; by 1884 it was
estimated to be about 4,000 and five years later, by the time of Hájí
Muhammad-Ridá’s martyrdom, had reached over 10,000.

‘Ishqabad was adopted in this study.

Bahá’í Settlement in ‘Ishqabad

The first known Bahá’í contact with the region took place around 1875
by a prominent Bahá’í teacher, Ibn Asdaq. At the invitation of a
Turkmen chief, he had gone to the fortress of Karím-Virdí Ishán, where
the chief and twelve others, who were all Sunni Muslims, became
Bahá’ís. It is not known what became of them or if others of that group
embraced the Faith as well.

Shortly after that, in 1881, an affluent relative of the Báb, Hájí
Mírzá Hasan, better known by the title Afnán Kabír, traveled through
‘Ishqabad with his family on his way to visit Bahá’u’lláh in ‘Akká and
realized the potential of the area, which was just being developed by
Russia. He sent instructions to his son to proceed to the area and buy
land for him there.

In 1882, Hájí Muhammad-Kázim Isfaháni and his son
Muhammad-Ridá Arbáb, along with Hájí ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl Yazdí, who was
a son of Mullá Muhammad-‘Alí Yazdí, were the first Bahá’ís to settle in
In 1883-84, there was a general persecution of Bahá’ís throughout
Iran, particularly in the nearby province of Khurasan, and soon four of
those affected by these harassments in Sabzivar arrived and settled in
‘Ishqabad. On 3 April 1884, Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar Banná Yazdí, Ustád
Muhammad-Ridá Khurram-Sháhí (along with his family), and some
other Bahá’ís of Yazd departed for the newly-founded town in search of
a more comfortable life away from the harassments in Iran.

A steady stream of Bahá’ís, mostly builders, carpenters and
merchants who were equipped to capitalize on the opportunities of the
developing town, followed them and settled in the new city.

One of the prominent Bahá’ís, Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí Afnán
(a brother of Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Taqí Afnán, the Vakílu’d-Dawlih)
traveled from China to ‘Akka, where Bahá’u’lláh encouraged him to

4   ‘Azízu’lláh Sulaymání, Masábih Hidáyat, vol. 10, p. 178.

purchase land in ‘Ishqabad for building a Bahá’í-operated inn. In 1887 in
‘Ishqabad, he bought a parcel of land from a certain A‘zam, who was
from Kirmanshah, and some other properties. By December of that
year, Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí Afnán decided to build on this land a
public bath and a meeting room similar to the Mansion of Bahji. Shoghi
Effendi notes that about the same time, “assured of the good will of a
sympathetic government,” the community was enabled to “establish a
Bahá’í cemetery and to purchase property and erect thereon structures
that were to prove the precursors of the first Mashriqu’l-Adhkar of the
Bahá’í world.”5

By 1889, the number of Bahá’ís in ‘Ishqabad had reached about
four hundred. By then, the city had emerged as an important route for
commerce, and a number of Bahá’ís prospered by trading through that
region. In particular, the tea trade from India via Afghanistan and
Bukhara went through ‘Ishqabad.6 In July of 1889, the celebrated Bahá’í
scholar Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl Gulpaygání arrived, which greatly expanded the
community’s ability to share the teachings of the Faith with interested
parties, and his presence enhanced intellectual and educational activities
of the growing Bahá’í group.

5 Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p. 195.
6 Áqá Ja‘far Shírází, known as Hadioff, writes in his memoirs (n.d., n.p., manuscript
in private hands) that when one time he had gone to Haifa and was in the presence
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, he requested permission to build a pilgrim house near the Shrine
of the Báb. ‘Abdu’l-Baha was aware that Hadioff could not afford such an
undertaking by himself and, therefore, responded, “That is acceptable, but you must
return and enlist the support of Áqá Músá Naqioff.” The latter had been an affluent
believer at the time. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also instructed Hadioff to return by way of
Turkey. However, Hadioff asked if he could go by way of India, to which ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá consented. En route, Hadioff experienced a severe sea storm, and thought this
might have been why ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had told him to go by way of Turkey. In India
he purchased 500 cases of tea and took them to ‘Ishqabad. These cases filled several
warehouses and were difficult to store, but soon he learned that he could sell them
for six times more than he had paid for them. Therefore, he sold them for 600
manát and, since he was unsuccessful in gaining the cooperation of Naqioff (who
lost his vast fortune soon after and died penniless), proceeded to Haifa, where he
funded the construction of a pilgrim house.

It was at this juncture that an important event occurred which was
to be a turning point in the history of the community. On 8 September
1889, one of the prominent Bahá’ís, Hájí Muhammad-Ridá Isfahání, was
assassinated in broad daylight in the town’s bazaar.7 The perpetrators of
this crime were a group of Shí‘a immigrants who had been recruited by
their clerics and affluent Muslim merchants who considered the Bahá’ís
as significant business rivals. They also planned to kill some two dozen
other prominent Bahá’ís, maintaining that they were entitled to do this
under Islamic law. They hoped that in so doing they would instill fear in
the Bahá’ís and cause them to leave that region.

The fact that the government gave no credence to this line of
argument, brought the criminals to trial in November 1889, and
convicted them, was a shock to the Shí‘a community. The Bahá’ís were,
of course, jubilant, and Bahá’u’lláh commended the action of the Russian
government. It was the first time in the history of the Bahá’í Faith that
an attack on one of its members had been dealt with justly by the state.

The event had one other major consequence. During the trial, the
judges ordered the various religious communities to sit separately. This
was the first occasion on which many who had secretly been Bahá’ís
openly identified themselves with the Faith. It was also the first occasion
on which official recognition was given by any government body to the
Bahá’í Faith as a religion independent of Islam. During this period, the
learned Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl served as the Bahá’í spokesperson and lawyer.

The two murderers received the death sentence for their crime,
and several others who were involved in the murder were sentenced to
long imprisonment in Siberia. However, the Bahá’ís interceded on behalf
of the convicts to have their severe punishments somewhat mitigated. At
first, the Governor was reluctant to reduce the sentences but referred the
matter to Czar Alexander III, who in turn placed the matter before the
Senate for a decision. The Senate decided to accept the Bahá’í
intercession and reduced the sentences – a decision endorsed by the
Czar and communicated to the Governor of ‘Ishqabad.

7Not to be confused with the Hájí Muhammad-Ridá Isfahání who was martyred in
Tehran in the summer of 1852; see Hasan Balyuzi, Bahá’u’lláh: The King of Glory, p.
89, and Balyuzi, Eminent Bahá’ís in the Time of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 180.

Shoghi Effendi has summarized these events in these words in his
history of the first hundred years of the Faith:

> [I]n the city of ‘Ishqabad the newly established Shi‘ah
> community, envious of the rising prestige of the followers of
> Bahá’u’lláh who were living in their midst, instigated two
> ruffians to assault the seventy-year old Hájí Muhammad-
> Ridáy-i-Isfahání, whom, in broad day and in the midst of the
> bazaar, they stabbed in no less than thirty-two places,
> exposing his liver, lacerating his stomach and tearing open
> his breast. A military court dispatched by the Czar to
> ‘Ishqabad established, after prolonged investigation, the guilt
> of the Shi‘ahs, sentencing two to death and banishing six
> others – a sentence which neither Násiri’d-Dín Shah, nor
> the ‘ulamá of Tihran, of Mashhad and of Tabriz, who were
> appealed to, could mitigate, but which the representatives of
> the aggrieved community, through their magnanimous
> intercession which greatly surprised the Russian authorities,
> succeeded in having commuted to a lighter punishment.8

The conduct of the Bahá’ís during the trial and then in showing
mercy to their persecutors by pleading for the life of the murderers was
greatly pleasing to Bahá’u’lláh and drew from Him much praise:

> Although in recent years a number of the faithful have, in most of the
> cities of Persia, suffered themselves to be killed rather than kill, yet the
> hatred smoldering in certain hearts hath blazed more fiercely than
> before. For the victims of oppression to intercede in favor of their
> enemies is, in the estimation of rulers, a princely deed. Some must have
> certainly heard that this oppressed people have, in that city (‘Ishqabad),
> pleaded with the Governor on behalf of their murderers, and asked for
> the mitigation of their sentence. Take, then, good heed, ye who are men

Shortly later, again Bahá’u’lláh commented on the same theme in
the Lawh Dunyá [Tablet of the World]:

> Day and night this Wronged One yieldeth thanks and praise unto the
> Lord of men, for it is witnessed that the words of counsel and
> exhortation We uttered have proved effective and that this people hath
> evinced such character and conduct as are acceptable in Our sight. This

> high authorities in favour of their enemies.10

Also, in a Tablet in honor of Mullá Muhammad-Báqir Há’í Najaf-
Ábádí (1819-1916), the following is revealed by Bahá’u’lláh:

> He Who gazes from the Supreme Horizon!
> O thou who art gazing upon My Visage and art present before this
Throne!

Praise be to the Lord that in His path, virtuous and sanctified
> deeds have been manifested. In the land of ‘Ayn and Shín11, the fire of

> knights of the field of wisdom and exposition was martyred.12 Praise be
> unto God that after the flames of enmity, the light of pure justice was

Also, Bahá’ú’lláh in a Tablet for Ibn Dakhíl Marághi’í reveals the
following sentiments:

Years later, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was faced with an acute problem. There
were three Persian-language journals published in Cairo that were
antagonistic towards the Faith. In particular, the editor of Chihrih-Nama
newspaper, Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Muhammad Irání, titled the Mu’addibu’s-
Sultán, published harsh attacks against the Bahá’í Faith.16 In addition to
meeting this editor when He was in Egypt and helping him overcome his
negative attitude towards the Cause, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote him about the
incident in ‘Ishqabad to illustrate the character of Bahá’ís:

Respected and compassionate friend!

Your esteemed letter arrived and its essence was filled with

16 There were several periodicals in Egypt, particularly Chihrih-Nama (published

1904-50 as an illustrated newspaper), Hikmat and Parvarish, which called for freedom
and reform in Iran. These publications were important points of contact between
Arab and Iranian reformist thinkers in the years before and during the Iranian
Constitutional Revolution, and assisted with the development of constitutional
discourse among the Iranian community in exile.

A Brief Biography of
Hájí Muhammad-Ridá

Hájí Muhammad-Ridá was originally from the city of Isfahan, and had
developed a successful trading business in that city.20 He was an eloquent
man, and in the course of his daily routines endeavored to mention the
Bahá’í Faith to those he found receptive. As a result of these teaching
efforts, the opponents of the Faith constantly harassed him and
eventually brought about his imprisonment in 1294 AH [1877]. He was
joined in this incarceration by another Bahá’í, Mullá Kázim
Tálkhúnchih’í. Some time later, through the efforts of Mírzá
Muhammad-Hasan, later known as the Sultanu’sh-Shuhadá [the King of
Martyrs], he regained his liberty. While attempting to reestablish his
former business, the enemies caused him great difficulties in the hope of
frustrating his plans and urged the Governor, the infamous Mas‘úd
Mírzá, commonly known as the Zillu’s-Sultan, to imprison him once
more. However, before he could be seized, the Baha’is learned of these
plans and advised Hájí Muhammad-Ridá to leave town secretly.21

After leaving Isfahan, he traveled for a while and eventually went
to ‘Akká, where Bahá’u’lláh was living. This contact ignited a deep fire of
devotion in him, and he spontaneously implored Bahá’u’lláh to grant him
the opportunity for martyrdom. It is reported that in response
Bahá’u’lláh told him that it was not necessary, as many souls had already
sacrificed their lives in the path of the Faith. However, Hájí Muhammad-
Ridá was so enthralled with the experience of being in His presence that
he repeated his plea. This time Bahá’u’lláh remained silent and the Hájí
took it as a sign of His consent. Later he asked Bahá’u’lláh for advice as

20 Muhammad-‘Alí Faizi, Lá’lí Dirakhshán, p. 213, incorrectly states that he was from
Khurasan. The same error is reflected in Adib Taherzadeh, The Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh, vol. 4, p. 342.
21 Muhammad-‘Alí Faizi, Lá’lí Dirakhshán, p. 213.

to where to reside. Bahá’u’lláh suggested the newly-founded city of
Hájí Muhammad-Ridá established himself in ‘Ishqabad where he
lived for several years, where, unlike many other Bahá’ís of that town, he
openly professed his allegiance to the Faith and was always engaged in
teaching the Cause among the Muslim population.

On 1 July 1889, he received a Tablet from Bahá’u’lláh in which He
praised him for his devoted services and bestowed His blessings upon
him for his steadfastness and devotion. He further stated that a grievous
upheaval had occurred in the city of ‘Ishqabad and described it as the
attack of a serpent upon one who was the recipient of the Lord’s
bounties.

Although the identity of the believer who was to be the target of
the attack was not disclosed by Bahá’u’lláh, He prayed in this Tablet for
Hájí Muhammad-Ridá that God would give strength to his body and
assurance to his heart. This Tablet arrived at a time when Hájí
Muhammad-Ridá had invited all the Bahá’ís of ‘Ishqabad to a feast – a
community that by that time numbered around 400 members.

When it was read out to the gathering, Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl stated
that, although no upheaval had taken place so far in ‘Ishqabad, since
Bahá’u’lláh had used the past tense and had clearly indicated that one of
the believers had been struck down by the enemies, this martyrdom was
inevitable and would happen soon and that only one person would be
martyred. Hájí Muhammad-Ridá said to the gathered Bahá’ís that he
believed that he was the person whose martyrdom Bahá’u’lláh had
foretold in the Tablet.

Two months later this prophecy was fulfilled. Enraged by the
progress of the Faith and the commercial success of the Bahá’í
merchants in ‘Ishqabad, the Shí‘a community had been secretly planning
to assassinate a number of prominent Bahá’ís. Although the full extent
of their plan did not materialize, they succeeded in murdering Hájí
Muhammad-Ridá when two men, armed with daggers, attacked him in
the bazaar and stabbed him to death on the morning of 8 September
1889\. It is reported that he was stabbed over thirty times amid the
jubilation of a great number of people who had gathered to watch him

die. Some of the Bahá’ís attributed the prayer revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in
the Tablet he had received, which beseeched God to give strength to his
body, as an indication of the agonizing and tortuous way in which he was
to be martyred. The murderers were so bloodthirsty that they were seen
licking their daggers which were dripping with blood, until the Russian
police arrived and took them into custody.

Hájí Muhammad-Ridá was buried outside of the city. His memory
has been immortalized by Bahá’u’lláh through a moving Visitation
Tablet.22

22 More details about Hájí Muhammad-Ridá’s life can be gleaned from documents
contained in this monograph, particularly Documents 3 and 10. In addition,
Muhammad-‘Alí Faízí, Lá’lí Dirakhshán, pp. 213-17, provides a general outline of
this biography.

> The Founding of ‘Ishqabad and
> Gathering of Bahá’ís in Russia

[The following is a translation of a segment by Fádil Mázandarání, Táríkh
Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 5, pp 346-49, which describes how the city of ‘Ishqabad was
established, the early Bahá’ís settlers, and the process of development of the sizeable
Bahá’í community of later years. Translator.]

When the Russian government conquered Turkmenistan, they
decided to raise a town similar to those in the developed countries of the
West, with straight and geometrically-designed roads and large, tall
buildings, which would serve as a capital for their Eastern dominions, on
the spot where presently ‘Ishqabad [currently Ashgabat] is situated – a
location that was agreeable for a city. Therefore, they laid out a properly
engineered plan and announced that the government would cooperate
with whoever desired [to reside there] by granting him a parcel of land
easily and without any complications. From every direction, multitudes
of Iranians and Russians proceeded to that region and raised dwellings
and other buildings. In the hope of finding security and establishing a
community free to practice their beliefs, and also in anticipation of
finding a new place for commerce and trade, the long-suffering Bahá’ís
of Iran also proceeded towards that area.

At the beginning of 1299 AH [1881], Hájí Mírzá Hasan, the Afnán
Kabír, was proceeding from Yazd to ‘Akká [to visit Bahá’u’lláh] by way
of Russia. Upon reaching Marv, he heard about ‘Ishqabad and decided to
purchase properties in the new town. This resulted in Hájí ‘Abdu’l-
Husayn Yazdí going to ‘Ishqabad to acquire land for the former and for
himself.

In those days, the Caucasian Railroad had not been completed.

The aforementioned Hájí Mírzá Hasan [the Afnán Kabír] went from
Baku to Batum in forty days, and by way of Istanbul arrived at the Holy
Land and attained the Glorious Presence [of Bahá’u’lláh]. The Bahá’ís
considered this a good omen, took advantage of the opportunity and
pioneered to ‘Ishqabad, creating comfortable lives in the Russian realm,
freed from the persecution of the mullás and the authorities in Iran,
thereby establishing the Cause of Bahá in that region. From the Holy
Land, directives supporting and encouraging this initiative were received
as well.

The Afnáns of Yazd decided to send Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar [Banná
Yazdí] and Ustád Muhammad-Ridá Banná by way of Khurasan to
‘Ishqabad for the purpose of building homes, shops and caravansaries.
In the same year, namely, 1300 AH [1882], as detailed earlier, a general
persecution, harassment and discrimination against these people [the
Bahá’ís] took place throughout Iran, through the combined efforts of the
state, the ‘ulamá and the authorities. This resulted in the captivity of
Varqá in Yazd and his exile and imprisonment in Isfahan. Also, as noted
earlier, Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí Isfahání was prevented from staying in
Tehran, and was forced to proceed to Isfahan and Yazd. There he
consulted with the Afnáns and other eminent Bahá’ís of Yazd about
ways to free [Bahá’í] prisoners, and to generally alleviate the difficulties
of the friends in Iran. [Based on these discussions,] Áqá Siyyid Ahmad
Afnán decided that a number of Bahá’ís should appeal directly to the
Russian government, and complain of their harassment and
maltreatment by Násiri’d-Dín Sháh. As such, they asked Áqá Mírzá
Asadu’lláh Isfahání to come from Tehran for the purpose of
consultation. However, when they telegraphed Bahá’u’lláh and asked His
permission, they were sternly forbidden and so the aforementioned
Afnán decided against the planned undertaking.

Eventually, Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar [Banná Yazdí] and Ustád
Muhammad-Ridá arrived in ‘Ishqabad. After them, Hájí ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl
Yazdí, Áqá Muhammad-Ridá Isfahání and some others came as well.
They approached the authorities and asked for land to raise houses and
other buildings. They also raised a splendid trading house.

The new town was growing and expanding at an incredible rate as
people from every direction arrived, settled and established new homes
and businesses.

After two years the number of Bahá’ís had grown considerably
and they had constructed shops, residences and other buildings. In
particular, the Afnán Kabír, Áqá Siyyid Ahmad, Hájí Siyyid Mihdí24 and
Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí25, who all numbered among the Afnáns,
purchased many parcels of land.

Eventually, in the year 1305 AH [1887], in accordance with the
instruction sent by the Blessed Beauty [Bahá’u’lláh], the believers decided
to raise a Temple. At this time, Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Taqí, the
Vakílu’d-Dawlih of Russia, and his son, Hájí Mírzá Mahmúd, came to
‘Ishqabad from Yazd. For 600 manát26 he purchased a large tract of land
from a certain Turkmen by the name of A‘zam. They planted a tree and
at every dawn, with the utmost liberty – and in a way that they could
only have dreamt of in Iran – the Bahá’ís would gather at that site,
raising their voices in prayers and supplications. Soon that location
became known as the Land of A‘zam and became [the site of] the first
official Bahá’í Mashriqu’l-Adhkar in the world. The fame of ‘Ishqabad
thereby became widely known in Iran as the first provider [of a temple
site] for the Bahá’í Faith.

‘Ishqabad is the closest city in Russian Turkmenistan to [the
province of] Khurasan [in Iran]. It is located on the northern side of a
mountain range, which separates Khurasan from Turkmenistan. As will
be noted in subsequent sections, in a very short time, the Bahá’í pioneers
of ‘Ishqabad became renowned among the local population, particularly
among the Russians, the Christians and the Turkmen, for their
uprightness, piety, and trustworthiness in all their [business] transactions,
and were greatly cherished and esteemed by all. A number of them
settled and started businesses in Bukhara, Samarqand and other towns of
eastern Russian Turkmenistan and began to teach the Faith. Indeed,

Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl came to ‘Ishqabad and then to Samarqand for the
propagation of the Cause and to print its literature. With the support of
the Russian authorities, he decided to start a print-shop and a newspaper,
but was discouraged from doing so by the officials of the Faith in
Tihran. It was about then that Fádil Qá’iní arrived in ‘Ishqabad and after
a while settled in Bukhara for the purpose of teaching the Cause.

Document 2

Expansion of the Bahá’í Community

of ‘Ishqabad

[The following is a translation of Fádil Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol.
6, pages 993-1002. In this segment, the learned author describes the founding of the
city of ‘Ishqabad, and gives considerable detail about the early years of the Bahá’í
community in this city. Translator.]

As noted in an earlier section, in about 1298 A.H. [1880], the
Russian government gained control over the regions surrounding the
Caspian Sea and decided to establish and raise new cities, including
Tazih-Shahr, Qazil-Ardad, ‘Ishqabad and Divanih-Bagh, from the
seashore to the shores of the Jayhun [River]. ‘Ishqabad is situated in the
midst of that region, on the northern face of the mighty mountain range
that runs between that province and Khurasan, and near an ancient
village known as Ashkabad, and it serves as the capital of the territory. In
order to sell land and facilitate people’s [migration and] settlement,
authorities made certain that provisions and people from every direction
proceeded towards the town. They bought land, raised buildings and
dwelt there. Having no [other] haven of safety or security, Bahá’ís
proceeded to that area as well.

In 1299 A.H. [1881], Hájí ‘Abdu’l-Husayn Mi‘már [master-builder]
Yazdí went there [to ‘Ishqabad] and bought land for himself and Hájí
Mírzá Hasan, the Afnán Kabír. First [to arrive were] Áqá Muhammad-
Ridá, son of Hájí Muhammad-Kázim Isfahání, and Hájí ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl,
son of Áqá Muhammad-‘Alí Yazdí. As a result of persecution by the
enemies, years earlier they had left their native town and settled in
Sabzivar. Now, once more due to continued harassment, they left that

town as well and came to ‘Ishqabad, settle there and commenced trading
tea.

After a while, Hájí ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl returned to Sabzivar and, as
noted earlier, was confronted by the enemies, imprisoned by the
authorities in Mashhad and upon paying a fine was released. He returned
to ‘Ishqabad and once again established his residence there.

It was then that Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar Mi‘már Yazdí together with
Ustád Muhammad-Ridá Banná [builder] Khuramshádí-Yazdí came to
‘Ishqabad from Yazd for the purpose of procuring land and settling
there. This journey was subsequent to consultation between Hájí Mírzá
Haydar-‘Alí Isfahání and other believers, particularly, the Afnáns of Yazd
– a consultation the outcome of which was announced throughout the
Bahá’í community of Iran.

From Sabzivar, Hájí [‘Abdu’r-Rasúl] telegraphed Bahá’u’lláh and
received a [coded] cable that read, “Number one silk is not permitted.”
This text was sent from Sabzivar to him in Faran. Recognizing that this
cable forbade their journey, the two of them obediently came to
‘Ishqabad on 5 Jumádá’th-Thání 1301 AH [2 April 1884], and thereby
were spared the persecutions in Yazd. They purchased land and built a
caravansary, shops and homes for themselves and for the Afnáns and
were engaged actively in construction.

In 1302 AH [1884], Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím Ardabílí arrived and
settled [in ‘Ishqabad]. In the same year, Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar received a
Tablet in response to his supplication sent from ‘Ishqabad, in which it
was revealed, “Engaging in an occupation in the new realm is consistent with
wisdom and the Tongue of Consultation hath consented to it as well. Today, all must
arise with the utmost exertion to serve the Cause of God.”

Also, Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar [Banná Yazdí] and Ustád Muhammad-Ridá
[Isfahání] went to the Holy Land to attain the presence of Bahá’u’lláh. It
was about then that Mashhadí Yúsuf together with Mashhadí Ibráhím,
who were both of Milan, came to ‘Ishqabad, and in 1302 AH [1884] they
commenced a partnership in the trading business.

After pilgrimage to the Holy Land, Áqá Muhammad-Ja‘far Uskú’í
arrived in ‘Ishqabad in 1304 AH [1886] and established his residence
there. In the same year, Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar Dih-Bálá’í Yazdí arrived,

together with his two sons, Muhammad and Ridá. After a while they
returned to Iran, but once more returned and settled in ‘Ishqabad. Ustád
‘Alí-Asghar, the younger brother of Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar Mi‘már, arrived
with his family in the same year as well, and settled there. Áqá Ridá
Yazdí (Sa‘ádatí) also settled there, in the same year.

In 1305 AH [1887], upon conclusion of his pilgrimage to the
presence of Bahá’u’lláh, Hájí Muhammad-Ridá Isfahání (the martyr)
arrived. Mashhadí ‘Alí Yá-Hú and Mashhadí Muhammad-Qulí Urdúbádí,
who were among the Muslim residents of ‘Ishqabad, became believers in
the same year. Dhikr-‘Alí, son of Mashhadí ‘Abbás Mílání, also arrived in
1305 AH [1887]. After a while he returned to his native land to fetch his
family, and they all settled in ‘Ishqabad afterwards. Karbalá’í Hájí
Muhammad Kúrih-Pursizdárí in the same year became a believer in the
same town. Mashhadí Husayn Bábáioff Tabrízí started working in the
commercial office of Mashhadí Yúsuf Mílání, and converted to the Faith.

After being released from the state prison in Rasht, Mírzá Mihdí
Rashtí proceeded to the Holy Land for the pilgrimage and afterwards
came to ‘Ishqabad. Mullá Yúsuf-‘Alí and Áqá ‘Alí-Asghar, together with
his brother, Mashhadí ‘Alí, were also released from the Governor’s
captivity in Rasht and went to ‘Ishqabad and settled there permanently.

In 1306 AH [1888], Áqá ‘Alí-Akbar, son of Muhammad-Ja‘far and
a brother of Mashhadí Yúsuf Mílání, brought his paternal uncle’s family
to ‘Ishqabad, and soon his daughter married there. Mírzá Ja‘far Shírází
(Hadioff), who had a trading business with his father in ‘Ishqabad,
became a believer in the same year as well.

In 1305 AH [1887], Mashhadí ‘Alí Urúmiyyih became a Bahá’í.

Also in that year ‘Abdu’l-Husayn Khán Dínyár-Ábádí Hamadání arrived
in ‘Ishqabad and took a room with Hájí Muhammad-Ridá Isfahání.
Siyyid Kázim Yazdí left Yazd in favor of ‘Ishqabad in 1305 AH [1887]
due to intense persecution by ruffians. After a while he went home, but
soon returned again and settled permanently.

Mihrabán Púr-Bahrám, who after becoming a believer became
known as Khayru’lláh, was one of the Zoroastrians of Bahram-Abad, a
village in the vicinity of Kirman. In 1306 AH [1888], he fled the
harassment of his fanatical parents and relatives, and came to ‘Ishqabad.

He settled, married and formed a family. Because of the persecution
perpetrated by the enemies in Isfahan and Sabzivar, Ghulám-Husayn
Isfahání came to ‘Ishqabad and settled. Mullá ‘Alí, a believer from Darud
in [the province of] Khurasan, moved to ‘Ishqabad in 1306 AH [1888] to
avoid the enmity of foes.

Áqá Muhammad-Ja‘far, a brother of Hájí Muhammad-Kázim
Isfahání, arrived in ‘Ishqabad in 1306 A.H. [1888] and started a trading
business. In the same year, Áqá Muhammad-Husayn Uskú’í arrived and
settled. His paternal cousin, Karbalá’í Qásim, a son of Karbalá’í
Muhammad-Ja‘far, came and commenced business, but passed away
after only two years. The aforementioned Áqá Muhammad-Husayn was
sent to Shanghai by the Umíd Company, which will be discussed later,
and committed suicide there.

In the same year [1306 AH] Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl Gulpáygání arrived
[in ‘Ishqabad] and he also visited Bukhara and Samarqand to teach the
Cause and to write. In the latter city, he succeeded in teaching Dr.
‘Atáu’lláh Khán and Shír-Muhammad Khán, the Afghán. Áqá ‘Azízu’lláh
Jadhdháb, whose biography was presented as part of the events of
Khurasan, has penned the following in his autobiography:

> In 1304 AH [1886] I journeyed from Mashhad to Bukhara,
> and through my brother, Karbalá’í Muhammad-Husayn,
> who for several years had been a trusted representative of
> the Mashhad merchants in Bukhara and was well-known

> Qúshbagi Vazír-Amír, and some other noble personages,
> whom I befriended, and by observing their kindness and

> I submitted a supplication to the presence of Bahá’u’lláh,

> Fadl Gulpáygání, Áqá Mírzá Muhammad Qá’iní [Fádil], and
> Áqá Muhammad-Mustafa Baghdádí be sent to Bukhara.

One day a year later, while I was on pilgrimage in the

> “Your supplication was presented to His Immaculate

proceed to Bukhara.’”

Therefore, in 1306 AH [1888], the illustrious Mírzá
> Abú’l-Fadl came to ‘Ishqabad and Turkistan27. However, it
> was towards the latter part of 1308 AH28 that the illustrious
> Fádil Qá’iní came to ‘Ishqabad and, after a short stay, went
> to Bukhara.

In the year 1306 AH [1888], Mírzá Abú’l-Qásim Afnán came from
Yazd to manage the homes, shops and caravansary that had been
purchased by the other Afnáns, including Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Taqí,
Áqá Siyyid Mihdí, Áqá Siyyid Ahmad, and Áqá Siyyid ‘Alí. He stayed
until 1313 AH [1895] and then left. It was then that his brother, Áqá
Mírzá ‘Alí, came in his place.

Fleeing the enmity of foes and ruffians in Yazd, Ustád ‘Alí-‘Askar
Tirmih-Báf [silk-weaver] came to ‘Ishqabad towards the end of 1306
AH.29 His sons, Mírzá Mihdí, Husayn-‘Alí and Haydar-‘Alí, soon became
well known. His wife was Tútí-Bagum. They had daughters, including
Bíbí-Sakínih, who was a poetess and a teacher of the Cause, and who
was married to Áqá Siyyid Yúsuf Khavídakí.

Construction of the Mashriqu’l-Adhkar commenced in 1305 AH
[1887]. Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar Mi‘már (the martyr) has written the following in
his autobiography:30

27 Turkmenistan.
28 1308 AH corresponds to 17 August 1890 to 6 August 1891. Therefore, it must
have been in the summer of 1891 that Fádil Qá’iní arrived in ‘Ishqabad.
29 The last day of 1306 AH corresponded to 27 August 1889.
30 The present translator was unable to locate the exact same passage in Táríkh

‘Ishqabad by Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar Banná Yazdí. However, Yazdí appears to have written
a separate autobiography which is unavailable to this translator, and this passage
may well be recorded there.

> “Together with Ustád Muhammad-Ridá, we arrived in
> ‘Ishqabad in 1301 AH [1883]. After a year, we journeyed to
> the Holy Land and attained the sanctified presence of
> Bahá’u’lláh. After a period of stay there, partaking of the

> visit to Yazd. Eventually in 1304 AH [1886], I returned to
> ‘Ishqabad. We became engaged in constructing shops,
dwellings and other buildings.

It was during this period that a letter was received

> Kabír. Therein was stated, “When I was in the presence of

> Raise a building that would include a pool, a small
> bathhouse, and a second floor that would surround the
courtyard. Record all expenses and I will reimburse [them].”

His esteemed sons started searching for suitable land.

> purchased a parcel of land for 600 manát in the name of the
> Afnán [Kabír] from a certain A‘zam who was Iranian and
> who had recently procured that land from the government

Bahá’u’lláh.

In response a Tablet was received in my honor, which

thee.”

After beholding this blessed Tablet, I started

well.

About the same time, a second lot situated to the east

registered in the name of the former.

The title of a parcel of land that was in the name of

> belonged to his servant [Ustád] ‘Alí-Akbar [Banná Yazdí],

> was also registered in the name of Hájí Mírzá Mahmúd, son
of Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Taqí Afnán.

For several years, the garden of the Mashriqu’l-
> Adhkar consisted of the three aforementioned parcels and
> the building, of which half of the upper floor was
> unfinished. Also, it included a few more rooms and a terrace
> on the side of Ázádí Avenue, where some of the Bahá’í
> gatherings would be held.”

In short, the above-mentioned Bahá’ís were able to freely hold
meetings and raise their voices in worship and supplication in the
Mashriqu’l-Adhkar situated on the land purchased from A‘zam for 600
manát, and which had become known by the name of the Land of
A‘zam. They were known for their outstanding character and upright
conduct among the general population, particularly among the Russians,
the Christians and the Turkmen.

Hájí Muhammad-Ridá Isfahání had his residence on the upper
floor of an inn known as Saráy Rashtí, which belonged to the Afnán and
which was situated in the midst of the bazaar, surrounded by other
shops and houses of Iranians. Most other Bahá’ís also resided in the
same vicinity. They associated and mixed with the Iranian Shi‘i
population, and would even help to organize commemorations for the
martyrdom of Imam Husayn, and they would participate in those events
also. However, they taught the Faith diligently, particularly Hájí
Muhammad-Ridá who was fearless in his endeavors to propagate and
promote the Faith.

Numerous and frequent Bahá’í gatherings led by Áqá Mírzá Abú’l-
Fadl were held where many prominent citizens, whether Muslims,
Christians or others, would attend. He also intended to establish a print-
shop through the support of the Russian authorities.

One day at about this time, Hájí Muhammad-Ridá mounted a
picture behind the glass entrance of a photo-shop. This picture portrayed
him standing between two other believers. It showed him holding over
his chest a most exquisite, original calligraphy done in nast‘aliq style
which was written in ‘Akká, depicting the verse “Be with God”. The other

two believers in the picture were Áqá Muhammad-Rahím Isfahání, who
was holding up the calligraphy of “Thou called me, I hearkened unto Thee.
Thou summoned me, I hastened unto Thee” and Áqá Mírzá Mihdí Rashtí who
held over his chest the calligraphy of the verse “Elevate wisdom through Thy
Pen.” This picture provoked the fury of the Iranian antagonists and great
commotion ensued from seeing this photograph. They charged that of
the three men in the picture, one was claiming the station of the Divinity
while the other two those of the Prophethood and the Guardianship,
respectively. They took their complaint to the authorities and the masses
constantly spread in the streets and the city that “The Hájí claims
Godhood!”

The Governor immediately summoned the complainers, as well as
Mullá Muhammad Qádí [judge] Qarábághí. They also called in the Hájí
and his photograph. They asked him of the meaning of verses in the
picture and he explained and expatiated on their intent. [Mullá
Muhammad] Qádí confirmed his explanation. The Governor
admonished those who had brought forth complaints and dismissed the
Hájí.

On another occasion a few prominent Christians were meeting
with Áqá Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl in the residence of Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar Mi‘már
and discussing this Cause. Also in attendance were Mullá Ahmad Yazdí
and several Iranian Muslims, who were all silent while listening
attentively. Eventually, Mullá Ahmad was overcome with a rage of
jealously over the eloquence of Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl and rising from his
seat, said to the Christians, “Do not seek the truth in vain, as talking with
these people [Bahá’ís] will lead to naught save depravity and gloom!”
With that outburst, he and his followers walked out and commenced [a
campaign of] opposition and hostility [against the Bahá’ís].

Eventually on 11 Muharram 1307 AH31 the martyrdom of Hájí
Muhammad-Ridá was perpetrated. This led to the authorities’ sentencing
of the offenders and the subsequent intercession of the Bahá’ís [on
behalf of the convicts], which resulted in the nobility, goodness and
virtue of the people of Bahá being further spread amongst the

317 September 1889. However, as other documents cited in this monograph
demonstrate, Hájí Muhammad-Ridá’s martyrdom took place on 12 Muharram.

population. All of these were discussed in the section on the events of
1307 AH, and also in this volume under the segment for the martyred
Hájí.32

Day by day, other Bahá’ís of Iran transferred their residence there
[‘Ishqabad] and the number of believers, both men and women,
increased. Their institutions and gatherings expanded and were
strengthened. Since it was no longer possible to bury their deceased in
cemeteries belonging to others, soon [the Bahá’ís sent] a supplication to
the Governor, which resulted in a large parcel of land being granted for
the purpose of Bahá’í burial. This land was located outside the town, on
the north side, in close proximity to three other cemeteries belonging to
the Jewish, Christian and Muslim communities, and a wall was erected
around it. The first to be buried there were the elderly mother of
Mashhadí Husayn Babaioff Tabrízí and the small child of Áqá Mírzá
‘Abdu’l-Karím Ardabílí.

Among the Bahá’ís resident in ‘Ishqabad, one must mention
Mashhadí Rahím Kaffásh [shoemaker] Zanjání, Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí
Uskú’í, Mullá Ahmad and Mírzá Husayn who were the sons of Mullá
Ridá Mílání, ‘Abdu’l-Javád and Hájí ‘Abdu’r-Rahím who were the sons
of Áqá Muhammad-Sádiq, who in turn was a brother of Hájí
Muhammad-Kázim Isfahání. Mírzá Mahmúd Afnán stayed in ‘Ishqabad
for a short while and then proceeded to Bukhara, where he commenced
trading and raised a building in the newly constructed town of Darkakan.

At the beginning of 1309 AH [1891], Áqá Muhammad Qá’iní
[surnamed Fádil], Nabíl Akbar and his nephew, Áqá Shaykh
Muhammad-‘Alí, arrived in ‘Ishqabad. After a few months, Fádil went to
Bukhara, and soon became ill. When the news of the setting of the Sun
of the Abhá Beauty [Bahá’u’lláh] was received, the believers of the region
were overcome with grief and sadness. The Afnán and other believers
did not mention the news [of Bahá’u’lláh’s Ascension] to Fádil. Two
days later he took his flight to the next world.

Alexander Tumanski was one of the high-ranking artillery officers
in the Russian military and established ties of friendship with Mírzá

was a man of letters and had a deep interest in all things Eastern. With
the permission of his government, he journeyed to Iran and obtained a
great deal of information about the Cause. He also translated into
Russian the Kitáb-i Aqdas, the Hidden Words, and some other late Tablets,
and in accordance with his own understanding, provided some
interpretation and exposition. Additionally, he published parts of the

Remembering Hájí
Muhammad-Ridá Isfahání

By Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar Banná Yazdí

[Some time prior to his martyrdom in Summer of 1903 in Yazd, possibly around
1901, Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar Banná Yazdí wrote a detailed account of the early Bahá’í
settlers in ‘Ishqabad. This history, known as Táríkh ‘Ishqabad, provides biographies
of many individuals, within which are many communications from Bahá’u’lláh and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. This document has been published electronically at: http://www.h-
net.msu.edu/~bahai/arabic/vol4/banna/ashgabat.htm. The following translation is
an extract from Táríkh ‘Ishqabad, pp. 59-63.34 Translator.]

An extensive account of the honored Hájí Muhammad-Ridá, the martyr
and a native of Isfahan, has been given at a certain point in my
autobiographical volume and it will be [briefly] mentioned to bless and
sanctify this book.

After conversion to the exalted and eternal Cause, that honored
personage [Hájí Muhammad-Ridá] rose with great ardor and intensity [to
propagate the Faith], and began unreservedly to expound the truth of the
Cause of God with friends and foes. Soon [he discovered that] it was not
prudent for him to stay in one place. For a while, he journeyed through
Khurasan and Sabzivar, and every day the enemies [in that region]
perpetrated many abuses and outrages against him. Unable to stay in
Sabzivar, he went to Isfahan in order to visit his family, wife and kinfolk.

34Portions of this text are cited in Fádil Mazandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 5,
pp.           375-377,              published           at:          http://www.h-
net.msu.edu/~bahai/arabic/vol3/tzh5/5tzh.htm.

In that city, he started teaching anew. However, hypocrites and
men of enmity began machinations and harassment [against him]. In
those days, Siyyid Hasan Káshání, who was an embittered enemy of this
party [i.e. the Bahá’í Faith], was in Isfahan, and an evil-minded group had
circled around him. Each day, he ascended the pulpit and preached
hatred and prejudice, mentioning the honored Hájí [Muhammad-Ridá]
by name. Together with other mischief-makers, the aforementioned
Siyyid sought suppression [of the Bahá’ís] through appeal to the
Governor. The Zillu’s-Sultán ordered that the esteemed Hájí be seized,
but he managed to hide. The Governor’s men and the foes began to
search and inquire after him, and left instructions at the city’s gates [for
his seizure]. However, wearing a disguise, the honored Hájí secretly left
Isfahan. With the utmost difficulty and hardship, and through an
unfrequented route, he walked to Yazd.

He stayed with the illustrious Afnáns for a while, regaining his
strength. No matter how he searched, he did not find anyone turned to
God [i.e. a seeker]. Therefore, by way of Daru’s-Salám35 he advanced to
Wadíu’s-Salám36 – the resplendent city of ‘Akká – and attained his
highest desire.

For a while he dwelt under the shadow of the Blessed Tree, tasting
the choicest delicacies of the Abhá Paradise and savoring the most
luscious fruits of the exalted pavilions. He was showered and honored
with the endless bounties and the infinite mercies of the Governor of
Names. How blessed and how fortunate was he! The venerable Hájí
would relate:

> Repeatedly, I pleaded for martyrdom. However, each time
> He [Bahá’u’lláh] would respond, ‘We have suffered many
> martyrs.’ One last time though I implored Him. This time,
> He did not respond. I took that silence to be His consent to
> my request. I was thrilled. When the period of beholding

plane where souls wait between death and the Day of Resurrection) where the soul

> [i.e. pilgrimage] had come to an end and the days of union
> were concluded, and Bahá’u’lláh had granted permission for
> departure, I asked, ‘I will reside wherever You designate.’ He
> responded, ‘Settle in ‘Ishqabad till We see what transpires.’

He [Hájí Muhammad-Ridá] bid everyone farewell and proceeded
to Istanbul. He lived there for a few months in the shop belonging to
Muhammad-‘Alí Isfahání. From there he came to ‘Ishqabad, settling in
the Caravansary of Hasht, where we roomed together and he worked
through my assistant. This continued until the honored Áqá Siyyid
Ahmad [Afnán] arrived in ‘Ishqabad and placed all his special affairs in
the hands of the Hájí.

However, the Hájí was continuing in his old ways, perhaps even
more boldly, teaching the Faith to every interested party, and without the
least consideration to observing wisdom. He was a model of self-
abnegation and, moth-like, with great courage, he strove for self-
sacrifice.

On 2 Dhi’l-Qa‘dih 1306 AH [30 June 1889], an envelope was
received from the Holy Land in the name of this lowly one. It contained
six Tablets from the Ancient Beauty, exalted be His Most Great Name.37
One of the Tablets was addressed to this ephemeral servant, while
another was in the name of Hájí Muhammad-Ridá and the other four
were for four other believers. In the Tablet revealed for the Hájí
statements were made that indicated the martyrdom of the one of the
friends [was nigh]. The beginning of this Tablet was in Arabic, and the
remainder in Persian, except that it concluded in Arabic. In the other
book the entire Tablet is quoted.38 A portion pertaining to our theme is
quoted below. Exalted be His utterance:

> Myriad thanks unto the Desire of the Worlds, Who confirmed ye in
> service to the Cause. Blessed is the one who was not held back by the

> and spread thy grace. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Redeemer, the
Omnipotent, and the Powerful.

My Glory be upon thee, time after time, and again and again,
from the Ever-forgiving, the Compassionate.

This blessed Tablet arrived on a day when the honored Hájí
Muhammad-Ridá had invited the friends to a feast on the A‘zam Land.
This Sacred Tablet and the other five Tablets were recited in the
gathering of the believers. Everyone was thoroughly astonished, as no
event had occurred in ‘Ishqabad like the one for which Bahá’u’lláh was
urging patience and forbearance. In accord with his own understanding,
each person offered an explanation. The honored Áqá Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl
was present in that gathering and stated, “Of a certainty, a terrible and
strange event is to befall! The phrase ‘the serpent hath opened his mouth and,
alas, hath stung the dayspring of the Lord’s favors’ is a prophecy of the
martyrdom of one of the friends! To whom would the Beloved be
inclined and whom would He desire? And since this event will come to
pass with absolute certainty, it has been revealed in the past tense. We
must wait and see for the effect of the blessed utterance to be made
manifest.”

39Madínih ‘ushsháq, a play on words in a reference to ‘Ishqabad, which means the city
of love.

Similar intimations and anticipatory allusions to the same event
were included in other Tablets. For instance, the Tablet revealed for this
lowly one bore evidence of the same precious purpose, and since it is
brief, the entire blessed Text will be included herein. Blessed and exalted
is His utterance:

He is the Hearer, the All-Knowing, the Wise!

O ‘Alí before Akbar! Mention of thee hath been and continues
> to be made before the Most Great Horizon. Verily, thou hast been
> honored with a Tablet that shineth over the horizon of the daystar of
> the bounty of the Lord, the Merciful. Some time ago a mighty and holy
> Tablet revealed specially for that honored person, along with other
> Tablets, was sent. We beseech God not to withhold His servants from
> the ocean of understandings concealed in His verses, nor to deprive them
of the straight and perspicuous path.

Convey My greetings to the near ones and share with them glad
> tidings of the bounties and favors of the Lord. Say: Do not be saddened
> by the fire of sedition and hatred enkindled by the brutality of the
> servant’s heart. I swear by the effulgence of the Divine Visage which is
> manifest and evident over the Supreme Horizon, such occurrences have
> exalted and will continue to exalt the Word of God. Erelong, all will
disappear …

In consideration of the enshrined wisdom, all are forbidden from
speaking or discussing this matter revealed by the Lord of creation. …

In short, after the arrival of the aforementioned Tablets, it became
evident to the men of discernment that the chalice of trial was to flow
freely in the feast of the men of piety. To whom would the cupbearer of
decree bestow this cup of martyrdom? The honored Hájí [Muhammad-
Ridá] would say, [at this time] “Without a doubt, this chalice is brimful
for me, since this allusion is recorded in my Tablet.” He then would add
his recollection of the silence of the Ancient Beauty when he had
supplicated martyrdom. Unceasingly, the honored Hájí was wrapped in
the thought of when he would attain his wish.

Soon the month of Muharram 1307 AH40 arrived from behind the
horizon.

The moon of Muharram is a crescent over the horizon

Like a nail a downcast stains crimson.

The days of turmoil arrived and the men of mischief boiled the
blood of the fanaticism and prejudice of the people of intolerance and
imitation.

The Hájí had also completed his affairs, prepared a will on the
ninth of Muharram [5 September 1889] and stood ready to drink his fill
from the cup of sacrifice.

Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl’s Letter

9 September 1889

[The original text of this letter is dated 13 Muharram 1307 AH, corresponding to 9
September 1889, and is preserved at the Bahá’í International Archives. A typed
version was printed in Pazhuheshnameh, vol. 4, pp. 109-11, and it was this latter
version that was used for the present rendering. It is not known to whom this letter
was addressed. However, from internal evidences it appears that it was sent to Hájí
Mírzá Muhammad-Taqí Afnán, the Vakílu’d-Dawlih, who was the Russian
Consul in Yazd. Since this letter was written the day after Hájí Muhammad-Ridá’s
martyrdom, Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl’s outrage over this heinous crime and his urging of
appeal to higher authorities, including the Czar of Russia, is evident. Translator.]

In the Name of God, Who alone is the Sovereign, the Everlasting!
May my spirit be a sacrifice unto your favors!

The hand trembles, the pen hesitates, the heart is heavy, and
knowledge and meaning have fled from memory. I do not know what to
write and what to present. No land is left that has not been thoroughly
soaked by the sacred blood of the friends spilled through the
malfeasance of the mischief-makers. No realm is left whose atmosphere
has not become suffocating for the near-ones, by reason of the torments
and rancor of the tyrants.

For years the city of ‘Ishqabad was a place of residence, a haven of
safety and a sanctuary of comfort for the friends of God. About two
months ago, this servant arrived in this city in the company of some
gentlemen.41 I observed that most of the inhabitants of this town were

in company of some of the Afnáns, including Áqá Siyyid Ahmad. Therefore, by
Áqáyán [gentlemen], the Afnáns are intended. It should also be noted that in 19th

troublemakers, scoundrels, fugitives, and drifters from other regions
who, because of theft of people’s belongings, or embezzlement, or lack
of occupation, had not been able to remain in their [native] towns and of
necessity had fled to this city as refugees. And since they perceived this
region to be endowed with liberty, they have not withheld themselves
from any manner of crime or misdemeanor. Day and night, they arise to
annoy and molest intelligent beings.

I further observed that the only righteous42 Iranians living in this
city were the Bahá’ís, who were engaged, with serenity and honor, in
crafts, commerce and the development of this realm, in accordance with
their laws and beliefs.

Even though the governmental authorities and the prominent
functionaries of the Imperial Russian government – may God exalt the
standards of her majesty – have evinced no shortcomings in protecting
the order of the town and the safety of the friends, yet during these ten
days of ‘Ashurá the mischief-makers have been busy day and night with
discussing and preparing the means of disturbance.

Yesterday, 12 Muharram, two Tabrízís attacked the venerable Hájí
Muhammad-Ridá Isfahání – may my life be a sacrifice unto his sacred
blood – in the midst of the bazaar and in front of all the people, and, by
inflicting thirty-one fatal wounds with swords and daggers, they cut his
sanctified person into pieces.

After committing this crime, they tried to flee, but, through the
vigilance of the city’s police, were prevented to do so and were both
apprehended. Presently, they are in prison.

The Russian authorities gathered around the remains of the
illustrious martyr and placed saldat [soldiers] and guards at various spots
in the bazaar and in front of Bahá’í shops. Nonetheless, the entire city is
boiling with turmoil and the friends are in the height of anxiety.

and early 20th century Iran, the term Áqá [pl. Áqáyán] meant master. For instance,
rarely would this term be used in communications originating from the royal court,
and instead a more neutral jináb be preferred.

character of the Bahá’ís of ‘Ishqabad is intended.

From what has become evident, the instigators of these ruffians
are a group of merchants and shopkeepers, all affluent and wealthy, such
as, Mashhadí Samad Tabrízí, Mashhadí Ismá‘íl Tabrízí, Mullá Ahmad
Yazdí and Mihdí Kashí. The last two men were bankrupted in Yazd and
Kashan and fled to this town, where they have amassed a little capital
and each night they gather at a place to consult and to hatch their plots.

From what has been determined, the foes have taken oath to slay
twenty-five of the friends whom they have specified. They have deceived
the ignorant by saying, “These people [Bahá’ís] have enmity towards our
Chosen Ones and speak contemptuously of the Imams. You must not
withhold yourself from killing these people. Each of us will contribute a
thousand manát as your surety and will not allow you to be executed or
taken to Siberia. Even if you are taken [to Siberia], there should be no
concern as we will send money for your expenditures so that you live
comfortably and are able to escape from there.” In short, your excellency
is well aware how the ignorant rabble are deceived by such talks.

Since the late Hájí [Muhammad-Ridá] had come to this region on
behalf of the honored Áqá Siyyid Ahmad – may my spirit be a sacrifice
unto him – therefore, it is necessary for you to inform the venerable and
distinguished Minister Plenipotentiary [i.e. Ambassador] – may his life be
perpetually exalted – and indeed to submit the same before His Majesty
the Emperor as well43, since the authorities of the Russian government
as well as others know that the majority of the developments in this
realm are due to the gentlemen.44 And when such disruptions take place,
that is, when in the middle of the bazaar mischief-makers kill merchants,
then no assurance remains for any one. Such disturbances have not been
witnessed even in Iran.

In short, do not neglect or delay in this matter whatsoever. The
General, who is the Governor of ‘Ishqabad, has himself granted

43 The fact that Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl is asking the recipient of this letter to appeal to the
Russian Ambassador and the Czar is an indication that the letter was sent to the
Vakílu’d-Dawlih, since as a Russian Consul he could bring about such an
intervention.
44 By “gentlemen”, presumably the Afnán family of Yazd who provided much of

the initial Bahá’í investments in ‘Ishqabad is intended.

permission that should an Iranian cause agitation, then, as a lesson to all,
he should be executed. Therefore, it is timely that through whatever
means possible you secure this punishment and ensure its occurrence,
since many of these ignorant people [i.e. Iranian Shi‘as] are not afraid of
Siberia.

Since time is short and the postman is about to leave, there is no
opportunity for greater detail. Yesterday the city was immersed in
turmoil. I sent a telegraph which surely has arrived.

Kindly convey my greetings to the friends in that region. Destiny
has delayed the time when once again I shall attain the presence of the
friends in that region. There is no knowledge save the knowledge of
God, He to Whom belongs the Kingdoms of Revelation and Creation
and unto Whom all affairs return.

Beyond this, I have nothing more to offer. May the rays of victory
and the light of happiness perpetually radiate from the brow of your
illustrious self!

Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl’s Letter

16 September 1889

[It is not known to whom this letter was addressed. The original is dated 20
Muharram 1307 AH, corresponding to 16 September 1889, and a typed version
was published in Pazhuheshnameh, vol. 4, pp. 111-12. Translator.]

In the name of God, the High, the Most High!

> May my spirit be a sacrifice to your bounties!

After the occurrence of the illustrious martyrdom, two missives on
13 and …45 were submitted to your ever-bountiful presence. Of a
certainty, both have been presented before your honorable self.

Nothing new has occurred. Praised unto God, the friends are in
good health and are engaged in their occupations. The two murderers of
the illustrious martyr are in prison. From what has been said, each one is
incarcerated separately from the other in a dark and inhospitable cell.46
Three or four others who are known to be allies and accomplices of the
assassins are imprisoned as well. From what the Russians and Armenians
[Christians] report, the murderers will be executed. We shall see what the
Lord, exalted be His mention, has willed.

In truth, it is a source of wonder how the meekness of the
illustrious martyr has so profoundly attracted the hearts of the
distinguished Christian people to the friends of God. In the bazaars,
wave upon wave [of Christians] come to the friends and express their
sympathies and request that this servant meet with them for an hour, so
that they can investigate this mighty, bountiful, resplendent, glorious,
exalted and all-conquering Manifestation and have discussions. Day and

46   It appears that the accused were placed in solitary confinement.

night, this servant is either writing or, to a degree consistent with
wisdom, is meeting and conversing with seekers.

In truth, through the influence of the sacred blood of the
illustrious martyr, two things have transpired. Firstly, the meekness and
rationality of these people [i.e. Bahá’ís] have been established, which has
attracted the compassion of other citizens to the Cause of God.
Secondly, permission has been given for a house to be raised in God’s
Name. That is, in accordance with the blessed instruction [of
Bahá’u’lláh], a building has been erected which is near completion.
Presently it is known as the A‘zam Land.47 For some time though, the
friends had wondered through what means they could secure the
authorities’ permission [for its inauguration], so that it would not raise
the government’s suspicion, nor provoke the people’s anxiety.

One night this servant and the beloved of hearts, the honored Áqá
Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím Ardabílí, were in the presence of the General [A.
Kamaroff], and he inquired of me, “Do you [i.e. Bahá’ís] perform
obligatory prayers?”

> I responded affirmatively.
> “Where do you offer your obligatory prayer?” he asked.
> “In our homes,” I replied.

“Why do you not perform your obligatory prayer in a mosque or a
special temple?” he inquired further.

“Because of their religious teachings, these people [Bahá’ís]
endeavor greatly to ensure that people’s hearts are not made anxious or
overcome with worries. They will never consent to be a cause of distress
among the people.”

He stated, “No, of a certainty, you must build a temple. The
government will not be remiss in protecting you or in extinguishing the
fire of the enmity and hostility of the transgressors.”

The honored Áqá Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím said, “The land known as
the A‘zam Land, which is known to your Excellency, has a building
under construction. God – exalted be He – willing, when it is finished,
we will do as you have instructed.”

47This land was donated by Hájí Siyyid Muhammad-‘Alí Afnán. The first building
over it was commenced in 1887.

In short, praise be to God and His good-graces, through the
Almighty’s all-encompassing will, affairs are improving.

However, the infamous enemies are not neglectful. They have
raised funds and sent a person to Mashhad before the ‘ulamá and the
exalted Ruknu’d-Dawlih [the governor of Khurasan]. We shall see what
answer they give. It appears that they have appealed to the Ruknu’d-
Dawlih for him to intercede with the luminous government [of Russia]
to entrust this adjudication to Iran’s government. The authorities of the
Senneh province48 of ‘Ishqabad have also learned of these exchanges and
are aware.49 We shall see to what the divine will inclines and to what the
pregnant night gives birth.

This servant has written a missive for the illustrious Excellency
Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Taqí [the Vakílu’d-Dawlih], may my spirit be a
sacrifice unto him, and informed him of the details. I implored him that
since he owns many properties in this region and the illustrious martyr
supervised these properties on behalf of the venerable Siyyid Ahmad,
therefore wisdom dictates that, at a minimum, he [the Vakílu’d-Dawlih]
should write to the General, thanking him and pressing the point [by
having the murderers tried and punished]. And secondly, if your
excellent self considers it prudent, he should to write to the illustrious
[Russian] Minister Plenipotentiary [i.e. Ambassador] in Tehran, asking
him to send a letter to the General requesting protection of his [Hájí
Muhammad-Ridá’s] kinsmen.50

In short, act however your august self is inclined. Of a certainty,
you will arise to this matter to the highest possible degree since its
benefits will go to the Cause.

I beseech Almighty God that through His all-encompassing
bounties He will render your prosperous self, who always has stood

where they were assured of a favorable outcome.

revenge-killing by the associates of the imprisoned assassins.

exceptional brilliance and the standards of might and glory.

Kindly convey my greetings to the friends in that region,
particularly the true beloved, the esteemed Áqá Mírzá ‘Ali-Naqí, may my
spirit be a sacrifice unto him. I implore all for their prayers, and God
willing this will not be forgotten.

I should add nothing further. I have written so much that the pen
is now slow and the hand trembles.

Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl’s Letter

18 September 1889

[It is not known to whom this detailed report was addressed, though someone in
‘Akká, possibly one of Bahá’u’lláh’s secretaries, seems likely. A typed version of this
tract was published in Pazhuheshnameh, vol. 4, pp. 113-17. Translator.]

In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!

After praise and laudation upon the Object of the world and the
Point of adoration of the people, great is His grandeur and exalted is His
word, I offer: By reason of my erstwhile devotions, many times I have
wanted to submit a missive to the presence of your exalted self and
express my sincerity and renew our friendship, but the pressure of work
and the requirement of critical correspondence have prevented me.
However, in recent times, an envelope was received from Tehran, sent
by the beloved and venerable Áqá ‘Alí-Haydar – may the Glory of God
rest upon him. Therein was recorded that your beloved person had
mentioned me. Although there was no need for trial or test as this
servant knew your good self was adorned with the garment of fidelity
and imbued with the most excellent qualities, nevertheless, with the
utmost joy I loosened my tongue to praise and thank the Lord, and
considered it necessary and essential to submit a missive at the first
opportune moment. Meanwhile, the incident of the martyrdom of the
illustrious martyr, the honored Hájí Muhammad-Ridá Isfahání, occurred
and what little leisure time had been imagined was lost.

Even though one ought to raise his voice in greatest ecstasy and
utter a myriad acclamations that a sanctified person has been sacrificed at
the alter of divine love and that sacred blood has been shed in the path
of the Divine Beloved – exalted be His Name – nonetheless since my

heart was heavy and [the memory of] firm friendship [with the Hájí]
prevented serenity and patience, once again submission of a supplication
was delayed, as thoughts were overwhelmed by his meekness and how
the fire of sedition engulfed him.

Today, while in a state of sorrow and despondency, submerged
beneath waves of wonder and emotion, the thought of that beloved one
rose above my heart’s horizon and the vision of that illustrious
personage filled my mind.51 I considered the subsidence of the attack of
sorrow and the reduction of the intensity of mourning a time to write of
the present conditions to that personage, informing him of the events of
this land. I implore God, exalted is He, to perpetually adorn your
excellent self with rays of victory and confirmations, and that, once
again, this hapless one may be honored and gladdened by beholding your
countenance. Verily, He is Supreme over all things.

Recalling that beloved’s affections from the past, I beseech you
that, like last year, be kind and gracious by attaining, on my behalf, the
Most Holy, the Most Resplendent Presence [of Bahá’u’lláh] and with
expressions of humility and submissiveness submit that, “I do not know
what to offer. All the friends are gone and this unworthy one still
remains in this realm of absolute nothingness.”

I swear by His Beauty, the Most Holy, the Most Resplendent, that
there is no hope for life and no will for its duration and no wish for
reward at the end or at the beginning, save for His good-pleasure, His
affection and martyrdom in His path. I implore Him by the pure blood
shed in His path, and the eyes that wept through separation from Him,
and by His signs above the horizon of His dominions and the necks of
His servants humbled before Him, not to withhold from me that which I
have implored of Him. His mercy is my sole hope. Verily, He is the
Clement, the Gracious, the Bestower, the Merciful.52

Out of your graciousness, also convey the greetings of this servant
to the luminous presence of my master, the high, the great, the
resplendent, the illustrious Ghusnu’lláh Akbar, may my spirit and

51 Expressions beloved one and illustrious personage appear to be a reference to the
recipient of the letter.
52 This paragraph is in Arabic and appears to be a spontaneous prayer by the author.

essence be a sacrifice unto the dust beneath his feet.53 God willing, if
circumstances permit, I will directly write to his blessed presence. Alas!
When will the demand of writing, the opposition of these mischievous
people [Shi‘as], and other obstacles, come to an end! Only if divine
confirmations help bring about a relief.

And the incident of the illustrious martyr came to pass thus: Two
or three hours into the day on the 12th of the present month, which is
Muharram [8 September 1889], in the middle of the bazaar, two thugs
from Tabriz martyred that personage [Hájí Muhammad-Ridá], with their
knives and daggers inflicting thirty-one cuts. From what was learned, at
that time no evidence of weakness or anxiety was observed in him, and
he only uttered a few spiritual words and in the utmost submissiveness
and serenity hastened to the Exalted Paradise.

At that moment, the foes were exhibiting signs of joy and
happiness, congratulating one another. Governmental officials and a
physician came without delay, but, alas, it was too late. They arrested the
two murderers and took them into custody. That day, though the town
was filled with tumult and the adversaries with animosity, yet the friends
remained in their shops, clinging unto fortitude with patience and
composure.

On the morrow, evidence of mischief became even more
pronounced. News was received that the enemy had given permission
for twenty-four specified individuals [Bahá’ís] to be murdered. The
ignorant foes were emboldened with speeches such as: “These people
[Bahá’ís] have enmity towards the Chosen Ones and speak
contemptuously of our Imams. We must kill them all. This issue is not of
concern to the Russian government, as our protector is the Shah of

53 Ghusnu’lláh Akbar (lit. the Most Great Branch of God) was a title of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s half-brother, Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí, who at that time – two years prior to
Bahá’u’lláh’s Ascension – was broadly admired by Bahá’ís. Seven years after this
letter, when rumors of Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí’s defection began to reach Egypt
where Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl resided, he strongly protested against them and asked a
close companion, Mírzá Habíbu’lláh Afnán, to inquire of the details while on
pilgrimage. For details see, Afnán, Memories of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
Trans. Ahang Rabbani, Witnesses to Bábí and Bahá’í History, vol. 4, at
http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com/.

Iran.” They had further assured the ignorant, “We will not allow you to
be killed or sent to Siberia, nor will we withhold any expenditure for
you.” They had taken an oath over these promises.

In short, the matter became difficult. In the afternoon of the
second day, five armed men attacked the illustrious Áqá Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-
Karím Tájir [“merchant”] Ardabílí and the honored Áqá Mashhadí
Yúsuf Tájir Mílání. Moreover, they did not hold back in the streets and
bazaar from any manner of insult, abuse or insolence.

Therefore, at sunset on the day following the martyrdom, Áqá
Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím, Áqá Husayn-‘Alí Yazdí who is a brother of Áqá
Ahmad, Áqá Mashhadí Yúsuf, Áqá Mashhadí Ibráhím Mílání, Ustád ‘Alí-
Akbar Mi‘már [“master-builder”] Yazdí, Mashhadí Muhammad-Qulí
Urdúbádí, and this servant went to the judiciary of the government of
Imperial Russia. Early in the evening, the governor of Kharazm and
‘Ishqabad, who is a General in the Imperial Russian government and is
known as Kamaroff54, summoned me and Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím
[Ardabílí], while the others stayed outside.

After we entered and sat, I stated, “It has been about ten years
since individuals who have been identified and allied with this Name
[Bahá’í] began living in ‘Ishqabad and have been engaged in trade or
other occupations, serving the nation. During this period no instance of
ill-conduct or illegality has been observed from them. They have
associated with everyone and every group with love, friendship, truth,
sincerity, trust and integrity. Even though they have been a constant
target of the injuries, insults, abuses and cruelties of these people [i.e. the
Shi‘as], they have remained patient and have never retaliated, nor have
they been a cause of concern or wasted the authorities’ time. With
complete patience, resignation, sagacity, and moral rectitude they have
conducted themselves, while you have observed the enmity of the people

54 His name is often spelled Komarow in scholarly sources. He was the Governor-
General of Transcaspia until early 1890, when he was replaced by Kuropatkin. At
this time the province of Transcaspia was still under the supervision of the
Government of the Caucasus. Komaroff is described by Curzon as “a quiet and
unwarlike professor, who was happier when labeling his insects than when
reviewing his men.” (Persia and the Persian Question, Vol. 1, p. 83.)

– which is utterly baseless. You saw how they murdered Hájí
Muhammad-Ridá with the utmost cruelty and brutality. Nevertheless, we
did not petition you, since it was evident to us that the authorities of the
city of ‘Ishqabad would themselves strive to extinguish the fire of
sedition and prevent mischief. However, now the situation has surpassed
patience and serenity, since they plan to murder a group [of Bahá’ís]. We
fear that out of moral conduct and patience, we would be accused and
charged with inattention and carelessness before the authorities. We now
implore you to tell us what we should do.”

With the utmost affection, the General assured us, “In protecting
the city and its inhabitants from the mischief of Iranian thugs, that is, the
Shi‘a sect, the government will not be negligent. In particular, it will act
with justice in the matter of the murder of the late Hájí [Muhammad-
Ridá]. Do not be saddened or disheartened by the troubles that have
occurred. Such mischief will increase your prestige and diminish theirs.”
He further added, “Our plan is to discover and seize the masterminds of
this sedition and the instigators of these thugs.”

Much discussion took place regarding this issue and with his own
hand he wrote the name of several promoters of these troubles. He
inquired about the health of his excellency Áqá Siyyid Ahmad Afnán,
upon him be the Glory of God, and asked, “In which town does he live
now?” I submitted, “He is in Istanbul.”

During the remainder of the discussion that took place, he stated,
“Even though I am familiar with your beliefs and know that you will
never speak contemptuously of anyone, nay, are the well-wishers of all
the peoples of the world, and translations of your books are available to
us, nevertheless in order to complete the examination, I ask: What do
you say regarding His Holiness Muhammad and the Chosen Ones of
Islam? I inquire about this because the killers of the late Hájí claim that
he spoke derisively about the Prince of the Martyrs [Imam Husayn] and
the reason for murdering him was this.”

This servant responded, “Regarding the past and bygone eras,
these people [Bahá’ís] speak only approvingly; then how much more so
about the Messengers and Prophets [of Islam]. Indeed, by a law with
which the illustrious Inaugurator of this Cause has charged these people

[Bahá’ís], they are barred from speaking negatively about their enemies
and foes, how much less about past [religious] figures. And Your
Excellency is well aware of this.”

> He stated, “Indeed, it is true.”
> I submitted, “The reason for the truth of my statement is that if
we had spoken disapprovingly of the great figures of Islam, of course we
would have spoken such things even more readily before other people,
such as, Christians, Jews and others. Presently in ‘Ishqabad there are
over thirty Russians and Armenians [Christians] who have asked detailed
questions from this servant about His Holiness the Messenger
[Muhammad] and the Chosen Ones of Islam. I have said to them,
‘Regarding bygone eras, we can say nothing but most approvingly.
Proving or rejecting bygone [religious] figures is not our duty. We speak
only of today and the present Cause.’ Often it happens that because we
refuse to disprove the religion of Islam, they have become annoyed with
us. You can ask them the truth of this matter, thereby satisfying yourself
of the truth of our statement and of the method of these people
[Bahá’ís].”

He said, “It is true. I know of your beliefs and that you do not
speak negatively about anyone, nor desire bad for anyone. However, it is
possible that a person, at a time of great anger and rage, would allow his
tongue to utter foul words.”

I responded, “This did not occur either, because if it had been so,
then they would first have taken a complaint to the authorities. It is
evident that if the Shi‘a people had a reason to reject us, or had a proof
against our teachings, then they would not be in need of murder. Indeed,
a neutral government, like the Russian government, would have been
sufficient for them to fulfill their intention”.

The General was greatly pleased with this comment and once
again assured us of his steadfastness and support.

Among the discussions that took place, he asked, “Who has
educated you in such well-pleasing manner?”

In consideration of the fact that religious precedence was vital
before governments and also in observance of wisdom, I stated, “Our
conduct was like these Iranians that you see. We spoke harshly about all

people and considered them unclean. Forty-six years ago, a great Man
arose and altered our thinking.55”

> He asked, “What has your present chief taught you?”
> I submitted, “The pleasing manner and the rectitude of conduct
for which these people [Bahá’ís] are well-known are all due to His
teachings. His greatest bounty unto us is that He has changed our
ignorance to knowledge, treachery to trustworthiness, dishonesty to
truthfulness, and enmity to love. He has rescued us from all those things
that cause ruin and destruction.”

> He asked, “Do you [i.e. Bahá’ís] perform obligatory prayers?”
> I responded affirmatively.
> “Where do you offer your obligatory prayers?” he asked.
> “In our homes,” I replied.

“Why do you not worship in a mosque or a special temple?” he
inquired further.

“Because of their teachings, these people [Bahá’ís] endeavor
greatly to ensure men’s hearts are not made anxious, to create means of
tranquility, and to avoid disturbance, as you have observed. You also
have observed that despite all our acquiescence, how entrenched is the
Shi‘a enmity. Now if they were to observe the performance of new laws
[from Bahá’ís, such as, having a temple], then it is well evident how far
their hostility would reach.”

He stated, “No, of a certainty, you must build a temple for
yourselves. The government will not hold back from restraining the
ruffians.”

The honored Áqá Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím said, “A certain location
known as the A‘zam Land is under construction, but has not been
completed.”

> He said, “Very well.”
> In short, extensive discussions like these took place; it is not
possible to detail them in these pages. However, the main points were
the ones mentioned. The purpose of this servant behind this verbosity is
that all should be known in the Sacred Presence [of Bahá’u’lláh].

In short, after these discussions took place, we were dismissed.

55   A reference to the Báb, Who declared His mission in 1844.

From that very night, they added more night-guardsmen and great
emphasis was placed on the town’s security. The next day, they arrested
those who had attacked the friends in the bazaar and they are now
imprisoned. At the present, praise be to God, the city is safe and the foes
are subjugated. We shall see what happens next, since from what has
become evident, the Russians intend to discover the main instigators of
the murder of the late Hájí and it appears that this matter will end in a
tribunal.

Through the efficacy of the blood of the illustrious martyr, the
hearts of distinguished Christians have become inclined and attracted to
the friends, and because of the friends’ trustworthy conduct in this town,
the government wishes to protect and guard these people [Bahá’ís], for
during this period they have observed nothing but mischief from the
Shi‘as and only affection from the friends [Bahá’ís]. During this period,
Russian dignitaries, who are called in their own language afsar [officers],
have been frequently heard to say, “We pray unto God that all the
inhabitants of ‘Ishqabad become Bábís.” Still, the foes are most united
and their number is large. This nothingness [Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl] and the
friends beseech that beloved person that in the Blessed Presence [of
Bahá’u’lláh] he will implore that celestial bounties and favors be
vouchsafed to these wronged-ones, and divine triumph bestowed. The
eyes of the friends are fastened upon Him and none other. All affairs are
in His mighty hands. No object can ever impede His will. He is, verily,
the Mighty, the Powerful.

All the friends of this land beg you to be so kind as to mention
them in the Most Holy, the Most Resplendent, the Most Exalted
Presence [of Bahá’u’lláh] and to convey their expressions of obedience,
nothingness, and annihilation, beseeching the advent and outpouring of
divine bounties. The beloved and exalted Áqá Mírzá Abú’l-Qásim, the
venerated son of the esteemed Hájí Mírzá Áqá Afnán, the honored Áqá
Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím Tájir Ardabílí, who during these days has truly
sustained great difficulties and troubles, the esteemed Áqá Safí-‘Alí
Yazdí, the honored Mashhadí ‘Alí, the honored Áqá Yúsuf-‘Alí Rashtí,
and the brothers of the aforementioned Áqá Mashhadí ‘Alí, [namely,]

Áqá Mírzá Báqir and Áqá ‘Alí Asghar, each one requests that you
mention his name before the Blessed Presence [of Bahá’u’lláh].

God willing, exalted be He, you will mention in the Luminous
Presence [of Bahá’u’lláh] the beloved of my heart, the honored Ustád
‘Alí-Akbar Mi‘már Yazdí, who, from the very beginning of the city’s
development until now, has been engaged in its construction and
presently is the target of the foes’ attacks and attention. Also the
honored Áqá Siyyid Kázim Yazdí, who presently is in ‘Ishqabad serving
the honored Áqá Mírzá Abú’l-Qásim Afnán, pleads [to be mentioned to
Bahá’u’lláh]. In short, the longing hands of each and every one of these
helpless ones are upraised for the bounties of God, beseeching divine
mercy.

May the sprinklings of the cloud of God’s most excellent favors
perpetually rain upon that beloved personage.

Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl’s Letter

31 October 1889

[While the addressee of this letter is not known, it appears to be someone in ‘Akká,
as Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl expresses submissiveness before Bahá’u’lláh and asks for His
confirmations and bounties. The text is dated 6 Rabí‘u’l-Avval 1307 AH [31
October 1889], and a typed version was published in Pazhuheshnameh, vol. 4, pp.
117-19.Translator.]

In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious.

> May my spirit be a sacrifice unto your bounties!

God- exalted be He!- willing, may you perpetually receive
sustenance, under the shadow of God’s mercy, from the choicest fruits
of the Most Great Paradise, and attain the highest benefits of nearness to
and of beholding the Countenance [of Bahá’u’lláh], and be enveloped by
His special and bounteous rewards, through His favor, kindness and
benevolence.

Several weeks ago the True Helper granted the bounty of
submitting two missives to your presence, wherein the recent incidents
of ‘Ishqabad were reported. Since then, nothing new has occurred that
would be worthy of submission, save that two more instigators of the
mischief-makers have been arrested.

From that time until yesterday, the officials of the province have
been engaged most days in investigation and interrogation. Yesterday on
the street, I met the translator of the examiner, who is called Salischi in
their own language. He said that the examination file has been
completed, read to the prisoners and today was submitted to the General
who is the Governor of this region. We shall see what will appear next
through the all-conquering Divine Might. All affairs are in His mighty

hand and rulers’ and kings’ hearts pulsate through His will. Even though
on the night of our meeting the Governor of this realm had stated that
this matter will come to its conclusion slowly, nevertheless the
authorities’ considerable patience and deliberation has brought anxiety to
the hearts of the friends, causing them to think that perchance, because
of the length of time, opportune circumstances, the foes’ attentiveness
and instigators’ provocation, a new scheme would be carried out [by the
enemies] and once again the ruffians would launch an attack. This is
because until now the government has dealt harshly with our oppressors
who have suddenly become disenchanted and disheartened with
‘Ishqabad to the point that more than thirty of the rabble-rousers have
fled and appealed to Iran’s government. They have sent several
emissaries to Mashhad and Tehran and with the utmost ingenuity and
artifice they are seeking assistance. From Quchan news was received that
when the [Shi‘a] merchants telegraphed the Sultan [of Iran] and implored
him for support, they received a negative response. Two of the
prominent authorities of Mashhad have written to this ephemeral one
giving assurance that the government of Mashhad would not heed the
petition [of our enemies].

However, the eye of these servants is to God’s bounties and His
pervasive will. Our earnest supplication is that, beneath the shadow of
His favors and under the canopy of His compassion, He will protect His
servants from the assault of the creatures and save the friends from the
scheme of the foes.

I implore you, out of your liberal generosity, to express, on my
behalf, with the utmost humility and meekness, my obedience before the
luminous Threshold of the Desired One and the sanctified presence of
the Promised Beauty – lofty is His Grandeur, and all-encompassing and
all-pervasive is His Benevolence– and to beseech, from His Ocean of
forgiveness and clemency, for pardon and absolution for the wrongs and
faults of this helpless one. God, exalted be His Splendor, is aware of my
condition and testifies to the sins of this servant. I swear by His sacred
essence that I am deeply ashamed of myself, of the fewness of my deeds,
of the nearness of my demise and the immensity of my failings, and I am
embarrassed over these shortcomings. I take refuge unto His greatness

and cling to the rope of His bounty and supplicate Him and call unto
Him by all that hath been revealed through His Supreme Pen and take
comfort in His Most Gracious Favors.

Praise be unto Thee, O my Lord, and thanks be unto Thee, O my
Desire, for illuminating Thy straight path and manifesting Thy Mighty
Announcement unto me. Enable me to attain unto the Dawning-place of
Thy Revelation and the Source of Thy Command after all Thy servants
and Thy creation have turned their backs unto Thee. I implore Thee, O
Sovereign of all Eternal Dominions, by the murmur of Thy Supreme
Pen, and by the voice that calleth from the burning Fire in the verdant
Tree, and by the Ark that Thou hast destined for the people of Bahá, to
make my steps firm in Thy love, and to make me resigned to whatsoever
hath been ordained in Thy Revelation, and to assist me in [serving] Thy
Cause and [performing] all that hath been revealed in Thy Book. Thou
art Powerful and Omnipotent over all that Thou desireth and all things
are in Thy grasp. There is none other God save Thee, the Mighty, the
Omniscient, the Wise.56

The other matter is that an envelope in your exalted name sent by
the honored Mullá ‘Alí Bajistání57 from Mashhad was received and
therein was noted that he had written a description of the martyrs of
Khurasan, which is enclosed. God willing, exalted is He, you will grace
him with a response.

The venerable and honored Áqá Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím Tájír
Ardabílí conveys his greetings to your esteemed self. In truth, during
these days his honored person has arisen in such wise that he has won
the gratitude of all the friends. Similarly, the honored Áqá Mírzá Husayn
Mílání, who is a most affectionate youth and has attained the Blessed
Presence [of Bahá’u’lláh], requests that you kindly mention him to the
Blessed Presence, and perchance the divine bounties that surround all
the servants will be bestowed upon him too and his name be inscribed

servants.

Nothing further is left to submit. God willing, exalted be He, soon
you will respond to these missives, which would bring delight to the

you.

In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!

> May my spirit be a sacrifice unto your bounties!

[It is hoped that], God- exalted is He- willing, your blessed person
is perpetually enjoying the luscious fruits of nearness, and attaining the
heights of triumph and the peaks of independence.

I then present before you: Several missives have been submitted
before your ever-bountiful self and until now I have not had the honor
of receiving a reply to any of them. Nevertheless, I have decided to send
this page informing your illustrious self again of the occurrences in this
realm, perchance it will bring gladness to your noble heart and will honor
and exalt this servant.

The essence of recent happenings is that, after the conclusion of
the cross-examination of both sides, the esteemed Excellency General
[Kamaroff] telegraphed the Emperor [Alexander III] requesting
conclusion of the affair through a ruling by a Paladai Sud, that is, a
military court, which would issue a severe decision against the guilty. In
accordance with his request, a military Sud, who is a most dignified,
courageous and admirable military-man, and is styled Persitjil, arrived in
On Saturday, 2358 Rabí‘u’l-Avval [17 November 1889],
corresponding to 4 Nayabr of the Russian calendar, there was issued a

written summons to over sixty persons from both sides to attend the
trial [as witnesses] on Monday, in a building known as the Qulup. Among
these were fourteen Bahá’ís, six Christians, two Muslims who were
witnesses on behalf of the Bahá’ís, and the rest were among the foes and
their witnesses. The esteemed General ordered that eight translators in
Turkish and Persian languages be present as well – though none were to
be of the Shi‘a religion; rather were they to be either Christian or Sunni.

In short, a great tumult was evident in the city; all wondering what
would appear from behind of the hidden veil. All hearts trembled as to
who would be favored with the breeze of approval and who would
suffer the consequences of their deeds.

On Monday 24 [Rabí‘u’l-Avval, the same as 18 November 1889],
corresponding to the sixth day of the Russian month [of Nayabr],
phaetons proceeded towards the Qulup with rank upon rank of people
directing their steps in that direction. Confident of divine bounties and
certain of celestial favors, the Bahá’ís entered [the building] with radiant
faces and assured hearts.

The Qulup is an excellent, large building. In its middle is a hall that
can sit five-hundred people. On either sides of this hall are two rooms.
The hall’s platform is about one meter elevated. The Sud was seated in
the middle on this platform and on his right and left were situated four
other high-ranking military officers. On the right side the Parakerur
[prosecutor] and a clerk were seated, and, at the behest of the
government, they were to support and speak on behalf of the murdered.
On the left side were another person and his clerk, who were
representing the murderers and prisoners. Thus, the members of the
court were nine persons. Translators sat before the platform on the right.
The nine prisoners sat on the left. Russian dignitaries, military chiefs, and
Armenian [Christian] and Muslim merchants sat on stools, observing.
Certain distinguished and eminent Russian ladies were present at the
assembly as well.

At first, when we arrived at the Qulup building, all the claimants,
defendants and witnesses of both sides were told to take seats in the two
rooms on the right and left of the main hall. They placed guards in those
rooms and instructed that none was permitted to speak with another.

One by one, they were summoned [to the hall] and engaged in question
and answer. When each person’s examination was concluded, he was
seated in the general assembly [in the hall] in the presence of the Sud and
was not permitted to return to the original waiting room.

In such wise, examinations and cross-examinations continued
from morning until six hours into the night. However, every three hours,
five or six minutes [of recess] were granted for everyone to leave their
seats for rest. In the afternoon also a two and a half hour break was
given for everyone to return home, on the condition that they would
return at the beginning of the night.

Like this, on Monday, 24, and Tuesday, 25 [Rabí‘u’l-Avval, 19

November 1889], the interrogation of all parties continued from
morning until about the middle of the night. In consideration that
Wednesday, 26 [Rabí‘u’l-Avval], coincided with an anniversary for the
venerable Christians, the court was adjourned – but everyone was
ordered to return on Thursday.

We arrived at the Qulup on Thursday, 27 Rabí‘u’l-Avval [21

November 1889], corresponding to the ninth of the Russian month [of
Nayabr]. The hall was full of Russians, Armenians [Christians], and
Muslims – both Shi‘a and Sunni. In truth, it was a most impressive
gathering. Since examination of both sides had concluded, after the
arrival of the Sud on that day and his taking the bench, the Parakuvar rose
and, in a most eloquent manner, which is beyond any attempt by me to
describe, he established and proved the meekness of the illustrious
martyr and the truth of the Bahá’ís. When his speech was completed, his
counterpart on the opposing side, who was charged to support the
prisoners, rose to reject the proofs offered by the friends. In truth, he
rejected all of our testimonies, since we had no eyewitnesses as it is
evident that the foes’ discussions about the murder of the late Hájí
Muhammad-Ridá and other friends had taken place in their own secret
gatherings and the Shi‘a would not testify for us.

In short, the Almighty God assisted and the Parakuvar was inspired
in pleading the case of the friends. In sum, the exchanges between these
two individuals lasted for about three hours. At the end, the Parakuvar
stated, “The very lack of proof and absence of evidence of the Bábís is

considered evident proof by me. And by this reason, I ask the death
sentence for these six prisoners. A murder took place in broad daylight,
in midst of the bazaar; none came forward to assist the innocent victim;
the transport of his remains precipitated so much scorn and insult; no
one would dare bury the remains the next day, with the result that his
torn body had to be buried in the middle of the night – all of this
demonstrates the contempt and assault of the Shi‘as upon this hapless
wronged-one [Hájí Muhammad-Ridá].”

The discussions then concluded. The Sud and four other
government dignitaries who sat to either side of him then retired to a
private room and consulted for two hours. Afterwards, the Sud and other
associates returned and stood at the head of the hall, in front of the
assemblage. They had prepared a written order and it was read aloud.
The essence of it was this: Firstly, in regard to the nine criminals, it was
announced that two men named Ibráhím and Gaffár had been proven
not-guilty and were to be released forthwith. The friends [Bahá’ís] also
testified that they had had no involvement. The two murderers, Husayn-
Qulí and ‘Alí-Bábá, are to be hanged. Mullá Ahmad Yazdí, Mashhadí
Samad Tájir [merchant] Tabrízí, Jalíl Bayk Tabrízí and Mullá Mihdí
Rawdih-Khán Tabrízí are to be banished to Siberia for life-
imprisonment. A certain Asadu’lláh who had caused sedition in the
bazaar is sentenced to a year and four months imprisonment in

When the decision was read it was near sundown and the
gathering was concluded. The foes, defeated and dejected, and the
friends, triumphant and victorious, returned. Praise belongs to God, the
Lord of both worlds.

Yesterday a letter was seen that your excellent self had written to
the beloved and distinguished Áqá Mírzá Abdu’l-Karím regarding your
properties. Even though it is not a matter related to me, nevertheless,
God knows that for your own good, and for the protection of God’s
Cause, I submit: A situation is observed that greatly weakens the Cause
and brings sorrow to the friends. Your own illustrious self is well aware.
If you inquire the remedy of these matters from the honored Áqá Mírzá
Abdu’l-Karím, that is, entrust the properties solely unto him, you will

win mightily for yourself and God’s Cause. Otherwise, day by day,
unfortunate matters will appear. Of course, the decision resides with
your own self.

I beseech conveyance of my expressions of humility to my great
master, the illustrious Amín, may my spirit be a sacrifice unto him.

Tehran, though marked from an unnamed Bahá’í to a friend at Isfahan. “The native

I submit: The incident of the martyrdom of the illustrious, blessed
martyr, the late Hájí Muhammad-Ridá – may my spirit be a sacrifice unto
the dust of his resting-place – in the city of ‘Ishqabad and the justice
rendered in the course of the subsequence trial by the stalwart and
glorious Russian Government – may God prolong her sovereignty in the
west, the east, the north and the south – is deserving of being recorded
in history and worthy of discussion among the friends in all cities and
regions. Therefore, I thought it was imperative for me to describe these
events for the believers in the Darú’s-Saltanih of Isfahan in order that
you may read these pages at the friends’ gatherings, where all may raise
their supplicating voices in prayer so that the life, sovereignty, pomp and
glory of His Imperial Majesty Alexander III and the ministers of his all-
powerful nation may long endure.

The exalted Tablets which have been received recently from the
Holy Land make reference to this matter, the essence of which is this: In
gratitude for the protection which has always surrounded the Cause of
the Lord of Creation, this wronged community must never forget the
support and the fair treatment it has received from the glorious
government of Russia and should ceaselessly beseech from Almighty
God an increase in divine confirmations and blessings for her most
glorious Emperor [Czar] as well as her esteemed General [Kamaroff].

Indeed this was the first instance of justice and assistance that the
world afforded the [Bahá’í] community through the equity of this great
Monarch and renowned King [Czar], who blotted out the threat of an

inveterate enemy towards a handful of gentle people who have no other
champion save the sanctified and exalted God.

It is astonishing to recall that the land of Kharazm, which contains
Turkmenistan, with ‘Ishqabad [currently Ashgabat] raised within its
borders, is the same turbulent realm where every year at least a thousand
Iranian captives were put to the sword and the Shi‘i women and
daughters were subject to untold atrocities. And this was in addition to
the multitudes [of the Iranian Shi‘is], who, worse than Sudanese slaves,
were sold in Bukhara, Samarqand and Kiev, as well as other cities of
Turkmenistan. However, it is now nine years since through the might of
this illumined [Russian] government, [this region] has become a haven of
justice among the nations of the East, and the wolf and the sheep, and
the beast and the prey, lie down together in the same bed with the
utmost ease and comfort. Exalted is God, the Lord of Destiny!

[Meeting Hájí Muhammad-Ridá]
It was on 17 Dhi’l-Qa‘dih 1306 AH [15 July 1889] that, in the company
of the Afnán gentlemen, I arrived in ‘Ishqabad, and that was the first
time that I had the privilege of meeting the illustrious martyr [Hájí
Muhammad-Ridá]. I discovered in him the highest attainments of
perseverance, tenderness, morality, fidelity and sincerity. He treated kin
and strangers with true affection, and dealt with his friends and foes with
warmth and generosity. However, by reason of his fame and
steadfastness [in the Faith], he was constantly harassed and beleaguered
by the promoters of enmity and hate, and in the same way that you
observe in Iran, he too was falsely labeled and slandered. For instance,
he was referred to as “the Imam Ridá of the Bábís” and – I take refuge
unto God – they spread among the people that he harbored resentment
towards the Sanctified Prophets.

‘Ishqabad is now the gathering place of the ruffians of Tabriz who,
because of the policies and the skilled administration of Amír-Kabír, the
Amír-Nizám61 of Adharbayjan [province], have escaped here and are

taking advantage of the liberties offered by the glorious [Russian]
government.

In short, it had been over a year since a group of mischief-makers
had risen in opposition to that choice friend and were determined to slay
that essence of goodness. The leaders of this band and the original
promoters of this mischief were Mullá Ahmad Tájir [merchant] Yazdí,
Mihdí Tájir Kashání, Mullá Mihdí Rawdih-Khán [soothsayer] Tabrízí,
Mashhadí Samad Tabrízí, Mashhadí Jalíl Tabrízí, and a large number of
people from Iran and Caucasia.

It was in the latter part of Dhi’l-Hajjih62 when the illustrious
martyr requested this servant to draft a will for him, a request to which I
consented. A few days passed. One day we saw each other in the streets
and he inquired, “Why have you not prepared the will?” “What is the
haste?” I asked. “Time is short and affairs may fall into disarray,” he
responded.

Some days later, that is, on the first of Muharram [28 August
1889], he came to this servant’s house in the company of Áqá Ghulám-
Husayn, who was his close companion, trusted friend and business
partner, and also accompanied by Áqá Mírzá Mihdí Rashtí. In
accordance with his instructions, a will was prepared stating essentially:
“All my possessions in ‘Ishqabad, completely and in their entirety, I leave
to the illustrious and venerable Áqá Siyyid Ahmad Shírází63, who is of
the Afnán of the Sacred Lote-Tree.” He added verbally the details: “My
residence and its furniture in Isfahan belong to me and are bequeathed
to my surviving family members. All my books and papers in Isfahan,
whether Bahá’í or otherwise, must go to my brothers,” that is, his two
brothers who lived in Isfahan. He emphasized that everything he
possessed in ‘Ishqabad belonged to the esteemed Áqá Siyyid Ahmad, and
that he only served as a caretaker of these properties, and also collected
62 End of August 1889.
63 Siyyid Ahmad was a son of Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Hasan, known as the Afnán Kabír.
He was a devoted Bahá’í and for a while lived in Yazd and ‘Ishqabad, engaged in
commerce. For his fascinating biography see, Afnán, In the Land of Refuge: The Genesis

rent from them, and that the exalted personage [Siyyid Ahmad] paid for
the daily expenses of the illustrious martyr.

In short, this will was written in the presence of Áqá Ghulám-
Husayn and Áqá Mírzá Mihdí Tájir Rashtí.

[Muharram Commemorations]
Since the month of Muharram 1307 AH64 had arrived, the Iranians of
the city, in accordance with the customs of their native land, commenced
setting up takiyyih65 and organizing dastih66, zakhm-zaní67 and rawdih-
khání68. During those nights and days, [the Shi‘is] were observed by
foreigners to commit such unseemly acts, which truly are unworthy of
description or further mention. It was in the course of these gatherings
that they laid plans to slay the illustrious martyr. However, because of
the presence of the government soldiers, they were unable to carry out
their dreadful scheme during the ‘Ashúrá period.69 In this wise, the ten
days of ‘Ashúrá came to an end and the rawdih-khání gatherings were
concluded.

[The Martyrdom]
On the morning of 12 Muharram [8 September 1889], however, about
three hours into the morning, as the illustrious martyr was passing

67 In order to act out the injuries which had befallen the Imam and His companions,

a number of those in the Shi‘i mourning procession would cut themselves, often
quite severely, and with blood gushing out from their foreheads, or as they beat
their own bare backs with sharp knives, would continue the march – a horrendous
scene which greatly incites public sympathy.

through the bazaar, two of the Tabrizi thugs, one known as Husayn and
the other named ‘Alí-Akbar and referred to as ‘Alí-Bábá, in full view of
the public, surrounded and martyred Hájí Muhammad-Ridá with thirty-
one stabs, cutting him into pieces, making the earth crimson with the
noble blood of that essence of love, purity, faith and fidelity.

At the time of his martyrdom, over five hundred of the
shopkeepers were present who inwardly were of the same mind as the
murderers and outwardly cheered them and shouted expressions of
immense joy. Nevertheless, because of the alertness of the authorities,
the perpetrators were unable to escape and were seized immediately. The
city’s medical examiner as well as the senior security officers came at
once, but, alas, it was too late and his sanctified soul had winged its flight
to its heavenly habitation in the most exalted pavilion.

Even though the two villains were chained and made captive by
the hand of fate, and the city’s security forces were vigilant and watchful,
the fervor of the enemies and the uproar of the men of enmity was of
such intensity that not one of the friends dared to go near the sacred
remains lying on the ground. In this manner, until sometime after noon,
the remains of that hallowed being remained in the dust of the same
bazaar.

Eventually, in accordance with the instructions of Áqá
Muhammad-Ridá Arbáb70, Áqá Ghulám-Husayn asked Mashhadí ‘Alí-
Haydar Shírvání, who was renowned for his generosity, leadership and
ability, to help him rescue the remains, hoping that with Shírvání’s
presence no other incident would occur. The honored Mashhadí ‘Alí-
Haydar consented and came to the location, but no one else had the
courage to help, and whoever they approached for assistance refused.

At last, Mashhadí Muhammad-Qulí Urdúbádí, who was a pious
and righteous young man, came forth and lifted the remains over his
shoulders. He brought it to a caravansary belonging to Áqá Siyyid
Ahmad Afnán, and which had been in the custodianship of the
illustrious martyr. [In the process,] however, he had to sustain the
intense and unrelenting attack of the enemies, who spoke every manner

70Interesting recollections of Kazem Kazemzadeh, a son of Áqá Muhammad-Ridá
Arbáb, are captured in Document 18.

of insult and abuse. The foes then rushed forth and withheld not
themselves from any manner of mischief or perpetrating harm. Having
no other recourse, Áqá Ghulám-Husayn and Áqá Mashhadí ‘Alí-Haydar
closed the caravansary’s gate, but from the [adjacent] roofs, the foes
continued to bombard them with rocks and subject them to every
manner of violence, trying to prevent them from washing the blessed
body in preparation for burial. Under such conditions, the remains were
washed and, with the utmost difficulty and hardship, that pure jewel was
buried at midnight at a choice location outside the city of ‘Ishqabad.

[Plot for General Massacre of Bahá’ís]
The following day, the uproar of the enemies reached a new height.
News was received that they had laid plans for the killing of twenty-four
of the believers, who were considered leaders of the Bahá’í community
of ‘Ishqabad. For this purpose they had collected and spent a very large
sum of money in order to stir the naive people’s sense of [false] pride
with such nonsense as: “This matter concerns our Faith! We are Muslims
and Iranian citizens. This has nothing to do with the Russian
government for them to interfere!”

In short, on the afternoon of the second day, a group of Tabrizi
ruffians rushed to the middle of the bazaar, and with drawn weapons
attacked Áqá Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím Tájir Ardabílí, Mashhadí Yúsuf,
Mashhadí Ibráhím Tájir Mílání, Mashhadí Muhammad-Qulí Urdúbádí
and some others among the believers. However, as the friends were
vigilant, they were unable to inflict any injuries.

[Meeting General Kamaroff]
By then, the situation had become most difficult and perilous. Therefore,
that same day at sundown, together with the above-mentioned friends
and others of the believers, we went to the office of the distinguished
Kamaroff, who was a General in the esteemed Russian government and
the governor-general of the provinces of Kharazm and Marv. After our
arrival had been announced, while the rest of the friends stayed outside,

this servant and the honored Áqá Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím Ardabílí were led
into the General’s presence. When we entered his office, permission was
granted for us to sit. With the utmost gentleness and affection, he
inquired after our situation. Our translator was the honored Mírzá
Ahmad Bayk, who is a Sunni from Caucasia with pleasing manners. It
became evident that it had been reported to the General: “The slain
person – and I take refuge unto God! – had insulted the chosen ones of
Islam and on hearing this, the two murderers had been unable to restrain
their anger, had killed him in a fit of rage, and are now in prison.”

This servant stated: “It is now over eight or nine years that under
the protection of the glorious [Russian] government this [Bahá’í]
community has been engaged in commerce and labor in ‘Ishqabad.
During this period you have not heard any mention of wrongdoing or
misconduct committed by any of them. Even in the case of the
illustrious martyr, who was killed with the most evident brutality, we had
no intention of imposing on the favor of the authorities or of filing a
complaint. This was because of our awareness that the provincial
officials always endeavor to maintain order and provide contentment for
the people. However, now the situation has gone past the point of
patience and forbearance, because news has reached us that the Shi‘i sect
has arisen to slay a number of Bahá’ís. For a long time the Shi‘is have
insisted on their calumny that these people [i.e. Bahá’ís] do not believe in
God, nor in the Prophet [Muhammad] and have enmity towards the
Imams of Islam. However, since these accusations have become old in
Iran and the officials of the realm no longer heed such utter rubbish,
they have therefore decided to raise these slanders here in order to create
mischief.”

The General inquired, “Do you believe in the Chosen Ones of
Islam? Do you speak contemptuously of them?”

“We do not speak negatively of anyone,” this servant responded,
“and are disallowed from uttering the slightest insult or abuse even
towards our staunchest enemies, much less the eminent figures of
religions or those sent by the Lord of both worlds. And the truth of this
statement is in the fact – and I take refuge unto God! – that if we had
been derisive towards the chosen ones of Islam before the Muslims,

surely we would have spoken more readily and with greater courage of
such things in front of foreigners who disbelieve in the Immaculate
Figures of Islam. Your Excellency can inquire of the prominent Russians
or of the Christians in this region who have met and spoken with this
servant of the manner in which we refer to the past Prophets.”

The General responded, “Yes, I know that you never speak
disrespectfully of anyone. I have your books and I am not unfamiliar
with your convictions. However, it is possible that a person in the heat
of anger would speak contrary to one’s beliefs or traditions.”

“This did not occur either,” I stated, “since if the late Haji – and I
take refuge unto God! – had spoken an offensive word, then they should
have brought a complaint to the authorities who would have dealt with
him according to the law, and would have punished him appropriately.
In that event no one could have objected. However, since they decided
to murder him on their own, it proves that the perpetrators are lying and
had no justification for their deed.”

beyond the available space in this missive. With his own hand, he [the

Ahmad Bayk, he sent clear and strong instructions about the security of
the city and the friends to the Polkovnic71, who was responsible for the
city’s security and military. Subsequently, we left his office.

[Official Investigation]
When that evening had concluded and the morning sun had risen, the
thugs and the ruffians, who on the previous day had been intent on
killing the friends, fled the city. Three of them, however, were captured,
and these were: Asadu’lláh, Ibráhím and Ghaffár. The latter two men
[Ibráhím and Ghaffár] were, however, innocent and were apprehended
in error. When people learned of their imprisonment, fear seized the
enemies and security was restored throughout the city.

71   Colonel in the Russian military.

The officials of the Russian government embarked on an
investigation to discover the identity of the instigators of the mischief, as
it was evident to those endowed with understanding that two worthless
thugs could not by themselves have mustered the audacity to perpetrate
the murder of the illustrious martyr without the full backing of powerful
instigators. Therefore, an astute and competent native of Russia, who is
known in the language of this realm as the Sledovatel,72 was appointed to
the task of interrogating the associates of the murderers and others
suspected of instigating this incident. Thus he began to prosecute his
charge and investigate the matter.

As a preliminary to a better understanding of the [subsequent]
events, I should acquaint you with certain details. Prior to the arrival of
this ephemeral servant in ‘Ishqabad, there existed little fellowship or
friendship between the friends [Bahá’ís] and the Christians.73 However,
after the arrival of this servant in the region, the doors of association, of
gatherings and of discussions between the Russian and the Christian
scholars and myself were opened. At all times of day, the learned ones of
this region would come to the dwelling of this servant and discuss
religious and scientific topics. These discussions, however, never
exceeded such limits as to lead to the severing of ties of affection or the
darkening of the horizon of friendship. Therefore, following my arrival
in ‘Ishqabad, the teachings and principles of the Faith became widely
disseminated among the Christians; they completely recognized the
scholarly and intellectual attainments of the friends [Bahá’ís] and their
superior and excellent achievements. Strong bonds of sincerity and
brotherhood were established between them [i.e. the Christians and the
Bahá’ís], and they gained a thorough understanding of the profound
difference between the beliefs of the enemies [of the Faith] and those of
the friends [Bahá’ís], since distinguished Christian people associated and
dealt with both groups. From one side they witnessed naught save
knowledge, learning, righteousness, forbearance, affection and
friendship, and from the other side [Muslims] they observed nothing but
malice, hypocrisy, slander, lies and enmity.

72   Russian term for investigators of criminal cases.
73   Armenians, as opposed to the Russians, who were Russian Orthodox.

As such, when the martyrdom of the illustrious martyr [Hájí
Muhammad-Ridá] occurred, it deeply touched the hearts of these people,
and proved the wickedness of the enemies and the meekness of the
friends in a manner that is well nigh impossible to describe. Therefore,
they exerted their utmost in discovering the purpose of the opponents in
slaying the illustrious martyr and demonstrating their wicked intent
before the glorious [Russian] government’s authorities. [Towards this
end,] they confided sincerely to the Sledovatel and other eminent officials
whatever they had seen or heard.

In short, for nearly two months, interrogations and investigations
were conducted most days, resulting in the arrest and imprisonment of
Mullá Ahmad Tájir Yazdí, Mulla Mihdí Rawdih-Khán Tabrízí, Mashhadí
Samad Tabrízí and Mashhadí Jalíl Turk. When these men, who were the
masterminds and instigators of the martyrdom, were seized, profound
dread and dismay overcame the enemies, and anxiety and apprehension
shook them to the core of their existence.

Mihdí Tájir Káshí – the staunchest [of our] enemies bar none –
immediately fled. After him, whoever had been involved in the
martyrdom or had participated in the conspiracy also took to flight. In
all, over sixty or seventy of the enemies retreated in haste from
‘Ishqabad. In the holy city of Mashhad, Tihran and Tabriz they took the
hem of the garment of the Iranian officials and the ‘ulamá of those
regions. Those who remained in ‘Ishqabad fabricated false tales and
disseminated various fictitious rumors. Each day that the sun came up,
they would spread a new tale of the imminent arrival of such and such an
Amír or General from Tihran to arrest the Bábís and carry them off to
Tihran in chains. They hoped that these rumors would overwhelm the
friends with fear and lead them to leave ‘Ishqabad for other regions. In
every town of Adharbayjan and Khurasan, the ‘ulamá and the merchants
had united in their support of our enemies and the persecution of the
friends.

Indeed, during those days, the believers in ‘Ishqabad exhibited
such a degree of forbearance as to entitle them to every praise and
acclaim. This is because in order to frighten the friends, the enemies
conspired on such schemes that no other mind could fathom and were

so thoroughly united [in their opposition] that no recourse seemed
possible.

However, the friends placed their reliance solely on divine
confirmations and the bounties of the Almighty God, exalted be His
mention. The administration of justice by the Russian government and
the fact that His Majesty the King of Iran was ignoring the various false
petitions presented by the foes were sources of comfort and tranquility.
During those many days, from Quchan, sacred Mashhad and Tabriz,
merchants and other enemies telegraphed Tihran and spent a
considerable fortune promoting their own nefarious designs. However,
divine favors and heavenly decrees, which have invariably reduced the
oppressor and succored the meek, neutralized the schemes of the
enemies and brought to naught their campaigns of mischief. It is self-
evident and clear that truth, righteousness, charity and honesty will
always conquer and defeat oppression, enmity, lies, and malice.

In truth, the unfortunate people of Iran have acquired the same
manners and behavior that the ignorant ‘ulamá and unworthy leaders
have shown and instilled in them – indeed this is their great and mighty
adversary, and a potent sword severing the cords of their self-worth and
integrity. Forever they will be shamed and disgraced before the civilized
world and will be considered brutish savages in the eyes of enlightened
people.

[Preparation for the Trial]
In short, nearly two months after these arrests, when the investigations
on both sides had been completed and the details of the events had been
satisfactorily determined, the renowned General – may his glory and
resplendence be safeguarded – reported the details to [St.] Petersburg, to
the presence of His Majesty the exalted Emperor [Czar]. About the
middle of the last Rabí‘u’l-Avval74, His Majesty the Emperor issued a
royal command instructing the formation of the Voennyi Sud court,
which in the Russian language refers to a military court. Voennyi Sud,

74   Circa 9 November 1889.

which is also known as Polavoy Sud75, is the highest level of the [military]
judicial system in the Russian government. No one in the country, not
even the person of the monarch, can reject its ruling, reverse its decision,
or dismiss its proceedings. Moreover, this is the only Sud [court] with the
authority to issue a death sentence.

This is but one of the bounties of the His Majesty the Emperor
[Czar] and the illustrious General – may both be exalted with the
effulgence of glory and happiness – towards this community [Bahá’ís],
for if the case had been submitted to other courts, the deliberations
would have been prolonged and the impact on the enemies lessened and
it would have been the cause of much concern to the friends.

After the case was sent to the Voennyi Sud, a government official
by the title of Persetatil, who was among the most eminent military
commanders and a man of profound knowledge, nobility and
compassion, arrived in ‘Ishqabad. The news of his arrival quickly spread
throughout the city and every one [of our foes] began to wonder about
his own fate and what he could do to exonerate himself, with fear and
trepidation penetrating all hearts.

On Saturday, 22 Rabí‘u’l-Avval [16 November 1889], which
corresponded to 4 Nayabr by Russian reckoning, about one hundred and
fifty subpoenas were issued [by the court] in the name of the Bahá’ís and
non-Bahá’ís. The documents addressed to these individuals stated, “On
24 Rabí‘u’l-Avval, corresponding to 6th of the Russian month [of
Nayabr], you must present yourself at a building known as Qulup76 at 9 in
the morning, which is one hour after sunrise, for the trial of ‘Alí-Akbar
and eight others on the charge of the assassination of the late Hájí
Muhammad-Ridá.”

A great commotion overtook the city when the subpoenas –
known as yavasqih77 in Russian – were received, and they became the sole
topic of conversation. In addition to sending emissaries to various parts
of Iran and appealing to the royal court, the enemies sought the help of

prominent men of ‘Ishqabad, and the city’s wise men, day and night,
searched for remedies.

On the morning of the 24th, rank upon rank of the friends and
their foes, filled with hope and fear, some arriving in phaeton, proceeded
towards the Qulup courthouse. Relying on divine confirmation and filled
with assurance, the friends, with expectant faces, also directed their steps
[towards the courtroom]. When we arrived, the proceedings
commenced, as will be briefly outlined below, even though no
description can enable one to visualize and imagine the true state of what
transpired.

Description of the Sud Trial
The Qulup is one of the government buildings in ‘Ishqabad. In
appearance it is dissimilar from the governmental offices in Isfahan and
Iran. It has a large hall approximately in the middle of the building,
which served as the trial-room and which was about the same size as the
reception hall of the Chil-Sutún78 building in Isfahan. This hall can
accommodate about five hundred people and has a dais, which is raised
about a meter above the floor. In addition, there are three more rooms,
to the right, to the left and to the back of this platform respectively.

When we entered the hall, we saw that his honor the Persetatil of
the Sud was sitting at the center of the dais upon the seat [of justice] with
great ceremony and pomp. Sat next to him were four governmental
officials [judges], on his right and left. Before them was a table, at one
end of which a framed mirror was installed. The mirror had inscriptions
by three renowned Russian Emperors enjoining administration of justice
[in judicial proceedings], and on the frame there was a golden eagle,
which is the emblem of the Russian State.

On the right of the platform was the perokyror [prosecutor], a
government official who spoke on behalf of the deceased, and he was
joined by a clerk known as the sekretar79 [secretary]. On the left of the
platform was the zashtinik [defense attorney], who spoke on behalf of the

defendants, together with a sekretar. In total, nine members of the Sud
[court] and judiciary served in the court.80

Inside the courtroom, city officials, military officers and prominent
merchants of Russian, Muslim and Christian [Armenian] backgrounds
were seated, observing the proceedings.

In accordance with the instructions of the distinguished General,
Russian-Turkish and Russian-Persian translators, who were of the Sunni
religion, were present and sitting to the left. In front of all, the nine
[accused] criminals were sitting, and from behind, soldiers known in
their native [Russian] tongue as saldat, surrounded them. A Shi‘a qádí
[religious judge] was also present. Everyone observed complete silence.

[The Trial]
Upon arrival at the Qulup building, those who were involved in the trial,
from plaintiff to defendants, their witnesses, the friends and the non-
Bahá’ís, were asked to enter the room on the right side of the courtroom,
and guards were positioned so that no one would enter or exit without
permission, and so no one would speak with another.

First the Shi‘i qádí, following the instructions of the Sud [Judge of
the court], swore in the witnesses called in by the defendants in the name
of God and by the Sacred Qur’án, in accordance with Islamic law, so
they would not offer false testimony, and would show no bias due to
friendship or kinship, or speak anything save the truth. In the same
fashion, the Shi‘i qádí was himself sworn in by the illustrious Sud [Justice
of the court], so he too would not speak other than the truth nor would
give any testimony out of spite. Nevertheless, the testimony of the
majority of them, including the person of the Shi‘i qádí, was so remote
from equity and truth that everyone present endowed with a sense of

80Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl is referring to the panel of the judges, which consisted of a
Chief Justice and four associate justices, and two teams of prosecutors and defense,
each consisting of an attorney and a clerk.

justice, including the Justice of the court81 and the government officials
[judges], readily realized their hollowness.

The Armenians [Christians], who served as witnesses for the
friends, were sworn in by their priest, who was also present. After that,
the friends were summoned collectively and each was asked to state his
religion and testify that he was a follower of Bahá. The Justice of the
court inquired from the honored Áqá Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím Ardabílí,
“Who will serve as the Bahá’í mujtahid and the leading learned person?”
He asked this for the purpose of the swearing-in of the Bahá’ís.

The Mírzá responded, “We have no clergy, but have men of
learning and knowledge.” The Justice asked of them and Mírzá
introduced this servant.

The Justice then inquired of me, “In what manner do you take an
oath in your community?”

I responded, “We have no such practice and no such law has been
enjoined upon us. However, we abide by whatever the government
requires of us and with genuine happiness and contentment will follow
the commands of the authorities, and indeed consider them binding
upon us.”

He stated, “I now wish to establish a covenant with you and hold
you to it as a solemn and firm oath. Firstly, since I have heard that you
associate with all people and nations with the utmost sincerity, kindness
and brotherhood, and do not consider differences in religion a reason
for enmity and intolerance nor cause for departure from equity and
humanity, therefore, I ask that in your testimony you treat these
defendants the same way and do not utter untrue words about them.
Secondly, since taking an oath is not a common practice in your religion,
you must make sure that your witnesses speak no lie, because otherwise I
will sentence you to Siberia.”

81The author consistently refers to the hadrat Sud [hadrat is an Arabic/Persian term
meaning “honored”], which appears to be a reference to the court’s chief Judge.
This has been rendered as Justice of the court to distinguish him from the other four
associate Judges.

I responded, “God willing – and blessed and exalted be Him – we
will commit no such wrong, and will completely abide by your
instructions.”

He then inquired, “Are your people and the Shi‘i community
permitted to inter-marry, and do such marriages occur?”

I submitted, “Since complete separation has not occurred as yet,
inter-religious marriage may happen. In fact, there are cases where
someone is a Baha’i while his father is a Shi‘i, or vice versa. Or many
times it has been seen that out of two brothers, one is a Shi‘i and the
other a Bahá’í. The same can be seen among cousins and other kinsmen.
Therefore, we are commanded to associate, marry, and observe other
social interactions.”

Thereupon, the Justice of the court called on the Shi‘i cleric and
asked, “Do your people marry Christian girls? That is, in accordance
with religious laws?”

He responded positively. “Do they marry Jews?” Again, the
response was affirmative. “How about marrying fire-worshippers?”
Once more, he responded positively.

The Justice of the court realized that the Shi‘i was being frugal
with the truth.

After these discussions, they began to question the witnesses of
both sides, starting first with the Baha’i side.

That day, which was 24 Rabí‘u’l-Avval [18 November 1889],
corresponding to the Russian 6 Nayabr, the process of questioning and
trial continued from the morning till five hours into the night. Almost
every three hours, a five-minute recess was granted so people could exit
the building to rest, smoke, or refresh themselves before returning to the
proceedings. During the trial no one was permitted to speak or smoke in
the courtroom, and even the Justice of the court and the Judges followed
these rules. From two-and-a-half hours before sundown until sunset,
people were allowed to return to their homes, but had to come back at
dusk, at which time the court reconvened.

The second day of the trial, which was Tuesday, 25 Rabí‘u’l-Avval
[19 November 1889], corresponding to the Russian 7 Nayabr, continued
in the same manner as the day before. From the morning until the

middle of the night, the court proceedings were under way. This day was
devoted to taking testimony from the defense witnesses.

Once testimony was completed during these initial two days, on
Wednesday, 26 [Rabí‘u’l-Avval], corresponding to the Russian 8 Nayabr,
the court was adjourned due to a Russian national holiday.

[The Verdict]
On the morning of Thursday, 27 Rabí‘u’l-Avval, once more everyone
proceeded towards the Qulup. Hearts were trembling and spirits were
filled with trepidation, not knowing what fate awaited behind the shroud
of destiny, and in whose favor would the all-encompassing Divine Will
incline. That day marked the final day of proceedings, and the verdict
was to be pronounced on that occasion. Truly it was a stressful day, and
everyone’s behavior testified to his or her inner agitation. The size of the
audience was greater than on the two previous occasions. In fact, the
courtroom was exceedingly crowded, and the Justice of the court
instructed that no one else should be allowed to enter.

When the court came to order, the Justice of the court took his
seat. At first the perokyror rose, and with eloquent words and brilliant
deduction – which thoroughly astonished the Russians, the Turks and
the Iranians – spoke for over an hour, proving the guilt of the
defendants. When he had concluded, the zashtinik rose, and speaking for
nearly an hour and a half endeavored to dismiss the testimony of all the
Bahá’ís one by one. When his presentation came to an end, once more
the perokyror rose and demonstrated the errors of the defense’s
objections. In such wise these two great men debated before the Judges
until one hour past noon.

When these discussions were concluded, the Justice turned to the
defendants and said, “O prisoners! The perokyror has proven the guilt of
seven of you, and your responsibility in this crime is clear and well-
established. However, the guilt of one of you, namely, Asadu’lláh, is less
than the others. For the other six, he has requested the death penalty,
recommending you to be hanged to death [for your actions]. If you can

show cause why this punishment should be reduced, speak now,
perchance it would lessen your penalty.”

After the Justice spoke these words, the defendants requested
permission to change their translator to Yahyá Bayk Qarábághí, who
knew Persian, Russian and Turkish. The Justice consented. Yahyá Bayk,
who was present, came forth to assume his duty. Thereupon, the
defendants rose one by one and spoke in their own defense words that
most evidently were untrue.

When these appeals were completed, the Justice and the eminent
Judges who had sat on his side of the platform rose and retired to the
room behind the raised dais for the purpose of preparing documents
about the court’s decision. During this time, no one was permitted to
enter their room. For two hours, the Judges continued their private
deliberations, while everyone patiently awaited the outcome and
wondered what the Hand of the Almighty had in store for them: who
would be victorious and vindicated and who would be defeated and
humiliated. In truth, a most strange and astonishing mood governed the
people that day, as everyone knew that the court’s decision was, like a
divine decree, irreversible, and its implementation compulsory.

It was nearly sundown when the Justice of the court returned and
with utmost dignity and poise stood at his designated spot, with
everyone, whether learned, merchant, plaintiff or prosecutor, also
standing in silence. The Justice of the court then read aloud the decisions
that he had written in private, as the interpreter translated point by point.
The summary of the decision was:

> Regarding the case against the nine men who presently stand
> accused of the murder of Hájí Muhammad-Ridá Isfahání,
> after thorough examination and investigation it has been
> determined by the court that: Firstly, two of them, namely,
> Ibráhím and Ghaffár, are blameless and are hereby released.
> ‘Alí-Akbar, known as ‘Alí-Bábá Tabrízí, and Husayn Tabrízí
> are to be hanged to death for their part in the murder of the
> late Hájí. Mullá Mihdí Rawdih-Khán Tabrízí, who from the
> pulpit commanded [the Shi‘is] to curse and insult [the

> Bahá’ís], thereby inciting the people into tumult, is to be
> exiled and imprisoned for life in the farthest regions of
> Siberia. Mullá Ahmad Tájir Yazdí, Mashhadí Samad Tájir
> Tabrízí and Mashhadí Jalíl Tabrízí, who instigated the
> ruffians, are sentenced to fifteen years of qatur vajni rabut82 in
> Siberia. Asadu’lláh is sentenced to sixteen months of
> imprisonment, and afterwards he is to be deported from
Russia.

We hereby grant the distinguished General Kamaroff,
> the Governor-General of ‘Ishqabad and Turkmenistan, the
> authority to reduce these sentences.

Once the court’s decision was read and translated and the court
proceedings were concluded, the spectators were dismissed, some joyous
and some sad. Praise belongs to God, the Lord of both worlds.

The meaning of qatur vajni rabut is: In cases where a person is
found deserving of the death penalty, the esteemed Christian nation [of
Russia] has, out of compassion and the preference for avoiding capital
punishment, decided that the convict can instead be imprisoned [in
Siberia]. Because of the bitter cold [in that region], it is not possible to
farm or raise dairy animals in Siberia, but prisoners work in hard labor
camps in mines or other locations. However, due to its considerable
hardships and difficulties, the majority die under the most miserable
conditions, and perhaps only one in a thousand survive to complete his
sentence. Even then he is not permitted to return to his native town, and
must spend the rest of his days in the Siberian region, where he can work
and earn a living. Because of these conditions, the majority of those
found guilty prefer death to imprisonment in Siberia.

Effect of the Verdict
On the day that the verdict was announced, the hand of destiny
inscribed an astonishing event on the pages of history; the Author of the
divine decree manifested an amazing wonder from behind the shrouds
82   Vajni rabut means important jobs.

and delivered yet another bitter humiliation to the enemies. The details
are as follows: While the Judges were engaged in private deliberation and
none were yet aware what the final decision would be and which side
would be rendered victorious by all-conquering Providence, one of the
men present in the court, without thinking or observing the protocols of
the court, had rushed outside and had announced to an spectator outside
the Qulup building, “Mullá Ahmad and the other defendants have been
freed!” The recipients of this news also, without pausing to consider or
determine the veracity or falsehood of this remark, had in great haste,
which according to the well-known hadith, “Haste is the work of
Satan!”, and which is a characteristic of the people of hatred and
oppression, boarded a phaeton, and with great speed had reached the
bazaar, crying, “Glad tidings! Mullá Ahmad and others have been
liberated and are now free!”

On hearing this false news, a tremendous commotion had ensued,
much like the great uproar and tumult that occurred on the day of the
martyrdom of the illustrious martyr. People began to insult and mock the
Baha’i storekeepers, who were engaged in their work. They [Muslims]
brought three sheep to be sacrificed in front of the shops of Mashhadí
Samad, Mullá Ahmad and Mashhadí Jalíl, and butchers stood knife in
hand awaiting the arrival of the defendants to slaughter sheep as a
sacrifice. Meanwhile, they shouted every manner of insult at the friends
and constantly cursed them in the most cruel and abusive way. Rank
upon rank of people had gathered in the streets and squares, waiting to
welcome the prisoners.

It was then that all of a sudden, He Who decrees destiny and rules
with manifest might turned the page and with the conclusion of the
court’s proceedings, the correct verdict became known to the people.
Suddenly, all that joy turned into bitter sorrow, and their jubilation was
transformed into humiliation and shame. Sheep that had been brought
for sacrifice were quickly removed from the scene and everyone went
into hiding much like thieves fleeing the law.

During these events, unaware of all that was transpiring outside,
this servant was in the courtroom awaiting the Judges’ decision. When I
came out, I saw an emotional state in the believers, which remains

beyond any written description. During that one hour after the receipt of
the false news, in which they encountered the insults, abuse and
mistreatment of the enemies, the unreservedly helpless friends had
withstood such a calamity that they were hardly able to utter a word. In
fact, for one or two hours, they [Bahá’ís] did not believe what this
servant, or others who had been in the courthouse, reported to them,
until they heard it directly from the enemies and saw with their own eyes
how quickly they dispersed and sought a place to hide. “And thus
decreed their Lord, the Powerful, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the
Ancient.”

If one were to closely compare the ways that the Russian and the
Iranian governments administer justice and conduct trials, he would be
totally astonished by the difference. If such a murder had occurred in
Iran, where eminent merchants had arisen in support of either the
murderer or the victim, it is quite obvious what great sums would have
had to be spent on both sides and what large bribes would have been
received. Moreover, because of the persistent intercessions and
interference, it would have not been possible for the judge to arrive at a
just decision nor to maintain his impartiality. However, in the case of the
murder of the illustrious martyr [Hájí Muhammad-Ridá], the
governmental authorities in Russia did not accept a single coin from
anyone. In fact, due to their devotion to equity and justice, no one dared
to even mention the word “bribe” or to mediate on behalf of the
defendants.

On the other hand, the Shi‘i community spent a considerable
fortune and sustained great losses in filling the pockets of the ‘ulamá and
the influential men of Iran in the hope that, through their assistance, the
attention of the Russian government would be diverted from giving
them punishment for their savage and despicable deeds. However, the
all-conquering will of the Almighty God did not allow the bloodthirsty
oppressors, who had openly perpetrated such a heinous act, to find
respite under the blanket of safety and comfort. The integrity of the
officials of the Russian government – may God perpetually brighten
their days – prevented these ruffians from transforming the security and
justice of this region into the violence and oppression of another Iran.

[Bahá’í Mitigation]
Since at the conclusion of the court’s proceedings it was decreed in
writing and was announced in the courtroom that the distinguished
General Kamaroff – may God unceasingly enrich his days with glory and
good fortune – could reduce the punishment of the criminals, therefore,
Mullá Ahmad and other prisoners sent messages to their kinsmen,
begging and pleading, “Since the General has not yet signed the court
order, go to the Bábís and ask them to intercede with the General,
perchance he would reduce our sentence and the door of liberty may
open before us.”

Consequently, as emissaries, they sent Hájí Ridá, who was a
brother of Mullá Ahmad, and a number of other merchants, including
Ridá Bayk Akbar, a learned and distinguished man who for many years
had served the Russian government and had attained an exalted position,
and Yahyá Bayk Qarábághí, who was renowned in learning, sincerity,
problem-solving and prevention of misconduct, and Áqá Muhammad-
Ridá Arbáb Isfahání. These men came to this servant and to Áqá Mírzá
‘Abdu’l-Karím [Ardakání], and asked that we attain the presence of the
illustrious General and intercede on behalf of the prisoners.

The following day, this servant, Áqá Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím, Áqá
Ghulám-Husayn Isfahání and Áqá Mashhadí Yúsuf Mílání, went to the
General’s house. In the courtyard outside the Governor’s residence, we
met Hájí Ridá and some other Shi‘is who had gone to plead mitigation of
the sentence of the prisoners but who had not been admitted into the
[Governor’s] presence. After speaking with us, they thought it best to
join our group in order to gain an audience with the honored General
[Kamaroff].

Once our arrival was announced, permission was granted for us to
go in, and Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím spoke about the purpose of our visit.
Simultaneously, Javád Bayk translated his words into Russian. In
response, the General spoke, the essence of which is:

> The Shi‘i community has become a source of infamy for the
> Russian nation throughout the world, as it has been His
> Majesty the Emperor’s view that all religions are considered
the same.

You should be praised because, despite all the injuries
> perpetrated against you by the defendants, you have arisen
> to intercede on their behalf. Is it not true that if a Bábí had
> murdered a Shi‘i in ‘Ishqabad, in turn the Shi‘is would have
> killed every member of your community in Iran? I am well
> pleased with you. However, I cannot promise that I will
> reduce their punishment. But should I decide to reduce their
> sentence, I will keep in mind to advise you beforehand.

After that, once more Áqá Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím [Ardakání] rose to
plead intercession for the prisoners. For the second time, the General
spoke words close to his initial comments.

Hájí Ridá and other Shi‘is were present in this meeting and heard
what transpired. We departed [from the Governor’s house].

On the following day, it was rumored throughout the city that the
Siberian sentence of the prisoners had been reduced and also it was
noised that the two condemned men would be hanged on 4 Rabí‘u’th-
Thani [28 November 1889].

[Day of Punishment]
In accordance with the Governor’s instructions, two gallows were raised
near the royal prison and a hole, two or three meters deep, was dug
under them, where the bodies could fall. The murderers themselves were
forced to construct these gallows and the hole.

These events made people extremely nervous and gave to the
unruly ruffians an ever-present admonishment about [the observance of
the legal codes and] the importance of civilized ways.

When the sun of the morning of 4 Rabí‘u’th-Thání [28 November
1889] rose, everyone knew that it marked the day on which the two
condemned were to be hanged. An astonishing commotion and a great

tumult could be seen everywhere. Due to their ignorance and prejudice,
people [Muslims] were most agitated, but because of the power of the
authorities, they were unable to utter any objections. Signs of mischief
were evident on everyone’s face, betraying their inner anger and rage.

First, in accordance with the command of the [Russian]
authorities, Turkmen cavalry surrounded the execution field. Chief
military officers and prominent citizens were present by the [Governor’s]
instructions. A large multitude had also gathered to observe the event.
Since the compassionate Christian people disdain killing, and to the
extent possible even their military men avoid such an act, a Turkmen was
hired to place the ropes on the neck of the prisoners, sending them to
where they belonged. The Shi‘i qádí [cleric] was present so that the
prisoners could repent and utter the Islamic confession of faith.83 When
everything was ready, the two murderers were brought to the gallows.

In a state of mind that cannot be described, the [Shi‘i] qádí
received their repentance, and they uttered words of confession.
Thereupon, the aforementioned Turkmen [who served as the
executioner] had placed the ropes around their necks, when suddenly,
contrary to everyone’s expectation, the all-encompassing Hand of the
Almighty ordained otherwise. In short, at that point, the perokyror who
was present read aloud an official decree, which was immediately
translated. Its essence was this:

> Since the representatives of the Bábí community have
> interceded on behalf of the convicts before the distinguished
> General – may his days be perpetually filled with happiness
> and sovereignty – to mitigate the punishment of the
> offenders, consequently the esteemed General, as a means
> of expressing his good-pleasure, gratitude and admiration
> for these [Bahá’í] representatives, has commuted the death
> sentence of these two murderers, and forgiven their blood
> shedding. He has decided that these two are to be removed
> to Siberia for fifteen years of qatur vajni rabut sentence, and

83 It is an Islamic tradition that prior to death one should utter a specific formula,
testifying to the oneness of God and to the Prophethood of Muhammad.

> because of this mercy, may they eternally be thankful to the
> government.

When this decree was read to the population, every tongue spoke
in praise and gratitude of divine bestowal, and with the utmost cheer and
joy people returned home, while the prisoners were removed to their
cell.

In truth, this incident greatly enhanced the position of the friends
and increased their standing and prestige. From what some in the
audience have described, this intercession so profoundly touched the
eminent Russians and Christians [present on the field of execution] that
some were moved to tears, saying, “Consider the devotion of the Bábí
community to the qualities of forgiveness, leniency, compassion,
kindness and forbearance that they even interceded in behalf of those
who slay them, and in such wise show mercy towards the ruffians who
have spent days and nights plotting their murder!”

[Aftermath]
From the beginning of the incident of the martyrdom until now, divine
benediction and heavenly bounties have ceaselessly encompassed the
friends and the exalted and blessed Almighty has confirmed our every
step. Before the authorities of the Russian government, our truthfulness,
wisdom, honesty, integrity, charity towards all nations, and our
uprightness of conduct under all conditions have been demonstrated and
established.

The incident of the intercession was solely through the Divine will,
for it was the Almighty’s doing that the decree pardoning the prisoners
[from execution] was read in public at a time when a large multitude of
Russians, Christians and Muslims, including the Shi‘i qádí [cleric], was
present. This was a mighty bounty and a great blessing, which on one
hand provided the friends with an added measure of stature, and on the
other robbed the ignorant [Shi‘is] of the opportunity to claim, “The
freeing of these two murderers was a miracle of the Imam!” or devise
equally nonsensical reasons. However, if one wished to truly appreciate

the depth of the ignorance of these people [the Shi‘is], one should note
that even now they fabricate such ridiculous and absurd claims and have
further ruined their own reputation, nay, the reputation of all Iranians,
before the world community, and have proven their own folly and
stupidity.

During these days, joy and delight has surrounded the friends
from all directions, and the showers of divine bounty have continued to
fall on the believers with ever-greater profusion. On the other hand, we
are immensely elated, as the court proceedings have been concluded, and
the truth of our claim has been well-established before the officials of
the Russian government. We have unbounded joy and eternal gratitude
because Sacred Tablets and Divine Verses have been received
confirming the Almighty’s pleasure with our deeds and actions. In many
Tablets, Baha’u’llah has bestowed endless blessings upon the illustrious
martyr and has designated for him stations that are beyond the
comprehension of any of the inhabitants of the world and are exalted
above the conceptions of those occupying the highest heavenly
pavilions. Moreover, He has revealed His good-pleasure with the actions
of the believers in the course of these events. In particular, in one of the
Sanctified Tablets, in response to a sum that one of the friends had
contributed, permission was granted for that money to be used for the
beautification of the resting place of those sacred and hallowed remains,
which are located on a choice spot outside the town of ‘Ishqabad.
However, because of the bitter cold and snow, these improvements
cannot yet be carried out and must be delayed. God willing, when the
weather is more agreeable and the spring has arrived, and days and
nights are equal, they will be undertaken and completed.

A few days after the execution sentence of the two ruffians was
pardoned, a picture of six of them in the special uniform of Siberian
prisoners was taken, by the authorities’ command, as they were being
sent to Siberia by way of Badkubih. The day that they were removed for
Badkubih was yet another occasion for the enemies’ commotion and
remorse. From that day until now, which has been over a month, the
merchants and the Shi‘i leaders in Badkubih, sacred Mashhad, Tehran
and Tabriz are engaged in intrigue, hoping to rescue the prisoners from

banishment and to save them from their fate. We will see how the divine
decree unfolds and what is hidden behind the veil of destiny.

This is a summary of the events in the region pertaining to the
martyrdom of the illustrious martyr, which has been outlined most
succinctly out of my love for your good self [Mírzá Asadu’lláh Khán
Vazír Isfahání] and other friends of Isfahan.

This servant supplicates that the friends not forget him in their
prayers at their gatherings. On behalf of this ephemeral servant, convey
my heartfelt greetings to your esteemed father, distinguished brother, the
honored Áqá Mírzá Mihdí – may God prolong his days of delight – and
the other friends in Isfahan.

May your brow always shine with resplendent rays of glory,
grandeur and holiness.

The Martyrdom of
Hájí Muhammad-Ridá

By Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar Banná Yazdí
Táríkh ‘Ishqabad, pp. 65-83

[The following section is a continuation of the excerpt from Táríkh ‘Ishqabad that
was introduced earlier as Document 3. Most of this portion is also cited in Fádil
Mazandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 5, pp. 377-95. Translator.]

[The Martyrdom]
On 12 Muharram 1307 AH [8 September 1889] this lowly one and the
honored Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl were in the public bath of the illustrious
Afnáns. It was two hours before noon when the honored Áqá
Khayru’lláh came in and informed us that the ruffians had martyred the
honored Hájí Muhammad-Ridá in the middle of the bazaar. Quickly we
dressed and left the bath. When we came out, we saw that people like
crazy men were running in every direction in the streets and in the
bazaar, and each was crying a different thing. One was shouting, “They
killed the Imam Ridá of the Bábís!” The other was claiming, “He will be
resurrected in three days!” Yet others were uttering insults and
imprecations, while some were congratulating each other. Some were
saying, “We must finish off the others [Bahá’ís] as well!” The condition
of these ungodly people during such turbulences must be well evident –
particularly, the people of the bazaar who for the most part were
thoroughly corrupt.

The details of the martyrdom of Hájí Muhammad-Ridá are as
presented below.

The honored Hájí had gone to the bazaar [to purchase] several
bottles of quinine84 for shipment to Bukhara. He acquired them in the
bazaar and was returning home. He had reached the shops of which he
was the rent-collector when two Turkish ruffians, like bloodthirsty
wolves, suddenly rushed out from the nearby coffee-shop known as
Khán-Isfahání, which was always frequented by thugs and hoodlums.
With large daggers, they attacked that meek, self-sacrificing soul. From
right, left, front and back, they stabbed him repeatedly and fatally. The
people of the bazaar had gathered to watch and were most jubilant,
praising and complementing those two brave champions, because it was
the height of valor and courage for two young thirty-year-old men to
attack and overcome an unarmed seventy-year old man with no means
of self-protection!

The honored Hájí became unconscious and fell to ground, yielding
life to the One Who bestowed it and uttering “Now is the truth manifest (to
all).”85

With this martyrdom, he actualized the statement of the Blessed
Beauty, Who had revealed in a Tablet “Verily, the serpent opened his mouth
and, alas, stung the dayspring of the Lord’s favor”86, since its meaning was now
clear and manifest. And the realization of the blessed Words “I beseech
God to strengthen thy temple and assure thy heart”87, in his enduring of those
fatal wounds, was now established and evident. This is because they
stabbed him deeply thirty-two times, when one would have been
sufficient to slay a man. For instance, they cut wide open his sides in
such a way that his liver and spleen were exposed, and they cut his chest
and repeatedly slashed open his abdomen.

In short, it was clear that the allusion “strengthen thy temple and assure
thy heart”88 was an intimation of this event, and similarly the meaning of
the phrase “spread thy grace and illumine thy face”89 became evident to men
84 Ethyl carbonate of quinine.
86 See Document 3.
87 See Document 3.
88 See Document 3.
89 See Document 3. In the cited Tablet, the phrase is, “illumine thy face and spread thy

grace.”

endowed with discernment, because in a short time this news was spread
to all regions and this martyrdom was the cause of profound benefits.

At all events, immediately upon this occurrence, several policemen
arrived and stood over the corpse, preventing people from further
insolence. The two murderers also stood there with bloody daggers,
licking and savoring the blood from the blades. They began to leave, but
slowly and leisurely. ‘Alí Bayk Qadimoff, who was the chief of police in
those days, took after them, [seized them,] called a phaeton [carriage] and
placed both men into it, promising them freedom and liberty as he
himself boarded. They proceeded to the police station, and from there
the two were sent to the jailhouse.

[Removal and Burial of the Remains]
Meanwhile, more police officers were sent to the bazaar in order to
prevent the ignorant from committing mischief. However, a multitude
had surrounded the corpse, clamoring, applauding and shouting
unseemly expressions. No matter how the police tried to remove the
body from that spot, the throng of people and the ignoble deeds of the
ignorant and wicked masses barred them.

The honored Mashhadí ‘Alí-Haydar Shírvání came forth and by
threatening, intimidating and admonishing the people for their misdeeds,
succeeded in moving the body from that place and bringing it to
Caravansary Hasht, which was the residence of the illustrious martyr.
The gate of the caravansary was firmly shut, but from other directions
the people got onto the rooftop and continued to utter insults and
imprecations.

That sanctified corpse was shrouded and placed in a coffin.

However, they wondered when they could move the casket [for burial]
and indeed where could they bury it for it to be safe from the foes’ harm.
They resolved to move the remains at midnight and bury them at a
location far from the city.

That midnight, they carried out the coffin by carriage. In their
party was the honored Karbalá’í Hájí Muhammad Sabzivárí, two others
and four soldat [soldiers]. They came out of the city and, north of a mill,

on the way to Iran and near Chishmih [“pond”] ‘Azízu’lláh, dug a grave,
buried the body and removed all traces of interment. For a while, no one
save Karbalá’í Hájí Muhammad [Sabzivárí] knew of its location.

[Plot for the Massacre of Bahá’ís]
The day after the martyrdom, the friends gathered at a certain place and
consulted about the assassination of the honored Hájí, wondering what
would be the right course of action. Eventually, they decided
unanimously not to make a complaint to the Governor, as he was aware
of what had transpired and he would take action as prescribed by law.

However, the band of mischief-makers and the people of hate also
gathered and consulted, “Now that we have carried out this deed, we
must complete our purpose.” Some stated, “We must go out en masse90
and slay all those known to follow this Cause [Bahá’í].” Others specified
fourteen individuals [for killing]. Eventually, they selected three of the
friends that must certainly be murdered. This mission was entrusted to
three men who were inclined to the task.91 These men decided to carry
out their charge in the afternoon of the following day in the bazaar.

The following day, they arrived at the bazaar in the afternoon. The
three believers selected for slaying were the honored Áqá Mashhadí
Yúsuf Mílání, the honored Áqá Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím Ardabílí and this
lowly one, ‘Alí-Akbar Banná Yazdí. Most of the Bahá’ís were in the
bazaar at that time. When the three men saw the multitude of believers
and witnessed them to be united and unified, they were overcome with
fear, and discarded their plans.

[Appeal to Authorities]
When the believers learned of their [foes’] plans, once again they
gathered at a certain place and consulted. They resolved to prepare a
petition, describing the murder of the illustrious martyr, the events of the
subsequent day and to disclose the identity of the authors of this
90   Intent of the original text appears to be a mass revolt.
91   The original text can be read that the three would-be assassins had volunteered.

mischief, and to collectively present this to General Kamaroff. They
quickly wrote an extensive supplication and together went to the
residence of the honored General Kamaroff.

Those who were present that day, consulted and signed the
petition were as follows: Mashhadí Ibráhím; Áqá Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl
[Gulpáygání]; Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím [Ardabílí]; Áqá Mashhadí Yúsuf;
Mashhadí Ibráhím92; this lowly one, ‘Alí-Akbar; Áqá Hasan-‘Alí; [Áqá
‘Alí-Akbar] Arbáb; Mírzá Abu’l-Qásim; Mashhadí ‘Alí-Rashtí; Mírzá
Mihdí Rashtí; Mashhadí Muhammad-‘Alí; Mashhadí Husayn Tabrízí;
‘Alí-Akbar, son-in-law of Mashhadí Yusúf; Ustád Muhammad-Ridá; Áqá
Muhammad-Ja‘far Uskú’í; Mullá Yusúf-‘Alí Rashtí; Áqá ‘Alí-Asghar
Rashtí; Áqá Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí Uskú’í; and Áqá Mashhadí ‘Alí-Asghar
Hamzioff Mílání.93

It was two hours after the sundown when the General’s doorman
informed him [of our arrival]. He came immediately. The petition signed
by fifteen94 of the friends was presented to him in our community’s
name. Upon reading its contents, he expressed his sympathies and
kindness, and sought to reassure us. The Governor of the realm
immediately summoned the honored Naftanoff and instructed him to
position guards at the homes of the friends and to increase the number
of guardsmen in the streets and in the bazaar. He told us, “Be not
perturbed. All will be well.” Thereupon he dismissed us and we returned
home. The General95 also instructed the police to be vigilant for several
days and said to us, “Each of you should carry a concealed weapon.”96

92 Appears to be the same name mentioned earlier.
93 In the original text, p. 67, this paragraph is set apart from the main narrative and
appears to be a later addition by the author (since it is in the same hand). The names
have been difficult to read by the present translator and when a better copy of
Táríkh ‘Ishqabad is found the list presented in this translation may need to be revised.
This paragraph is offered as a footnote in Mazandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 5,
p. 381, apart from the main text.
94 As noted in the previous paragraph, the author gives the name of 20 believers.
95 The original text is hard to read and may be a reference to someone else.
96 This sentence is missing in Mazandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 5, p. 381.

[As instructed,] for a few days we carried weapons until we
became confident [of security], as the fury of the ruffians had subsided in
light of the splendor and might of the just Governor.

[The Investigations]
The distinguished General sent our petition to the Prokuror [prosecutor],
who in turn sent it to the investigator, who commenced inquiry and
examination. All those named in the petition, whether witnesses or
accused, were gradually summoned, questioned, and the interrogations
documented. For each person, a separate file was prepared.

For about two months this process of individual interrogation of
both sides continued. And while the investigation was unfolding,
gradually the mischief-makers were seized and imprisoned until all were
in custody. The investigator sent all the files to the Prokurur, who
determined what each person was to be charged with, and submitted his
conclusions to General Kamaroff. In turn, the General brought the
details to the attention of [St.] Petersburg with a request that a high-
ranking Sudja [judge] be named to conclude the confrontation and rule
on the matter.

A Voennyi Sud [military court] was appointed from Teflis to
investigate and decide on this case. The manner in which this Sud
operated was that it convened for no more than twenty-four hours
devoted to discussions. This time was spread over three days and nights,
each of eight hours duration. [After its deliberations,] none was
permitted to reject its decision or appeal elsewhere. “The matter would be
settled at once, and no respite would be granted them.”97

After a short while, the Sud and some other officials arrived in
‘Ishqabad. Their arrival filled the hearts of the companions of mischief
and the people of enmity with fear and trepidation. Anxiety and
perplexity also surrounded the friends, wondering what the outcome
would be.

Several days later a police officer gave this lowly one a povestka
[subpoena] and mentioned, “The police has given eighty such povestka to
97   Qur’an 6:8. The cited text is at some variance with the published Qur’an.

me to serve for this case to various Bábís, Muslims, Armenians
[Christians], Jews and Russians, whether a witness or otherwise,
instructing all to assemble tomorrow [morning] at nine o’clock in Voennyi
Qulup, in the presence of the Predsedatel Suda [Chief Justice]. Placing our
reliance in God, the following day we proceeded to the presence of the
Sud. However, our hearts trembled with anxiety, worrying that fear
should overcome us or perchance words be spoken contrary to the
dictates of wisdom. Otherwise, the friends were confident that the Army
of God had ever been and will ever be triumphant.

At the moment of leaving the house [in the morning] for the place
of the Sudja, this ephemeral servant opened the Qur’an, seeking
divination of the outcome. When I opened the Book of God the
following sacred verse adorned the top of the page:

> Most assuredly, We will give victory to Our messengers and to those
> who believe, both in this world and on the day the witnesses are
> summoned. On that day, the apologies of the disbelievers will not benefit
> them. They have incurred condemnation; they have incurred the worst
> destiny.98

I knew then that the divine victory was with us. And whoever was
present at that gathering [i.e. court] readily recognized that the meaning
of the Sacred Verse became manifest through the testimony of the
Muslims, the Christians, the Jews and the Bábís, through the begging and
the pleading of the evildoers who were trying to rescue themselves from
punishment for their crimes, through the disregard that was given to
their repentance and through the banishment99 that was eventually
determined and decreed for them.

98 Qur’an 40:51-52. The text cited in the narrative is at slight variance with the
standard printing of the Qur’an.
99 The original Sú’u’d-Dar literally means evil abode and is rarely used in modern

Persian. This phrase is also used at the end of the Qur’an 40:52, cited on the
previous page.

[The Trial]
In short, when I arrived at the Sud, I saw a gathering organized in the
utmost dignity and decorum. Several lanterns were hung from bayonets,
and more bayonets were used as wall decorations. On a platform in front
of the Qulup’s main hall was a large table with a red cloth spread over it.
The Predsedatel [Suda] was seated in the middle with four others at either
side of him. Moreover, on either side of the platform were two tables
facing each other. [Behind one table] on the right was sitting the Prokuror
[prosecutor] on a chair, representing the wronged one [Hájí Muhammad-
Ridá], and in front of him were stacks of deposition pages. Facing that
table was another [table] with someone appointed by the government to
speak on behalf of the villains, trying to prove, if possible, their
innocence. He also had copies of the deposition papers stacked in front
of him. Several other people were also standing in various corners and
by the walls, ensuring that no one spoke with others.

Most of the members of the Sud wore red attire. The infamous
criminals, that is, the evildoers100, were sitting in chains and fetters on the
floor on the left-hand side, near their attorney, looking gloomy.
Surrounding them like a mantle was a line of soldat [soldiers], like seraphs
of penalty and chastisement. Similarly, the Bábís sat on designated
benches on the side opposite to that of the villains. Also, each group of
witnesses was clustered in a separate place with several soldat ensuring
that they would not converse with one another. Whenever one of the
witnesses needed to visit the bathroom, two soldat would accompany him
and afterwards would return him [to his seat].

For the purpose of swearing in the witnesses, a qádí [i.e. religious
judge] was brought for the Muslims, a Christian pastor for the
Armenians [Christians], a Russian priest for the Russians and a rabbi for
the Jewish witnesses. Similarly, the honored Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl was asked
to swear in the Bábís and all stood ready in their designated spot. Three
hundred chairs were placed in the middle of the Qulup for the public to

100 Asháb shumál is literally, the companions of the left hand; see Qur’an 56:41.
However, the left in this context is associated with evil, harm and generally negative
characters. Elsewhere in this monograph, asháb shumál is rendered as men of
wickedness.

sit, and all around, to the fullest capacity, people of every kind were
standing to observe [the proceedings]. Some of the people had come
from such regions as Caucasia, Marv and Bukhara for this purpose. In
truth, it was a most amazing scene.

Six Russian interpreters, knowledgeable in Russian, Turkish and
Persian, were present, vigilant that none would mistranslate anything.

In short, the witnesses of each group took an oath in accordance
with their own tradition. They said to Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl, “You must also
swear in the Bábís.” Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl replied, “There is no such practice
in our religion. If a person is devout and righteous, without being
compelled to take an oath he will speak the truth. And if he is irreligious
or deceitful, then he will take an oath, but will lie.”

Subsequent to taking the oath, deliberations and examinations
commenced. First, one by one, the people of Bahá [Bahá’ís] were
summoned forth [to the witness box] and questioned. After each had
stated what he had presented to the interrogator [during the previous
interrogations], the Predsedatel [Suda] would then ask the offenders, who
were men of wickedness, “If you have a response to what this person
has said, state it now.” Occasionally, one of them [i.e. defendants] would
stand and speak some untruth. Then the Sudja [chief judge] would ask
the defense attorney, “If you have a response, state it as well.” At times
the defense attorney would remain silent and at other occasions would
stand and say a few words.

Thereupon, the Prokuror would stand and with his thoughtful
remarks, much like the serpent of Moses that would instantly swallow
the sorcerers’ rods,101 destroy their baseless arguments, which were
feeble like a spider’s web. Thereby he would establish the wrongness of
their deeds, their unseemly conduct and the unsavory character of the
people of rancor before every man and woman present [in the court].
For instance, he would state, “I am astonished at how callous and
heartless these people [Shi‘as] are that they surrounded an old man of
seventy years of age and slew him in this manner, while the rest of the
people stood around watching jubilantly, shouting triumphantly and

101   Exodus 7:11-12.

congratulating one another!” As he spoke, most of the Russian women
were crying bitterly.

In short, after the rebuttal of the prokuror, the predsedatel and the
four others who were to either side of him together with the prokuror and
the defense attorney would retire to an adjacent room, discuss what they
had heard, write their decision and return to the court. Then they would
summon another [witness], and thus it would continue.

I will describe the manner of questioning by describing how this
lowly one was asked for his testimony. First they called this lowly one by
name, “‘Alí-Akbar Baqiroff!” I stood and went before the Sud. My file
from the [previous] questioning was available in at least three copies: one
before the Sud, one before the prokuror and the last copy before the
[defense] attorney.

> He asked, “What is your name?”
> “‘Alí-Akbar Baqiroff.”
> “Where are you from?”
> “Yazd.”
> “Citizen of which country?”
> “I serve the King of Iran.”
> “How old are you?”
> “I am forty-nine years old.”
> “Are you married and do you have a family?”
> “Yes.”
> “What is your religion?”
> “Bahá’í.”
> “What is your [Holy] Book?”
> “The Bayán and the Mother of the Bayán.102”
> “Do you accept the Qur’an?”
> “Yes.”

The attorney of the people of the left [i.e. rancor] stood and said,
“He is lying, as he has previously stated that he does not accept the
Qur’an.”
102   Presumably a reference to the Kitáb-i Aqdas.

This lowly one stated:

> I have never spoken thus. The interrogator asked a question
> to which I responded and the text of that exchange is now
> before you gentlemen and I invite you to consider it. That is,
the discussions of this lowly one with the investigator was:

He asked of my religion and I responded that I was
Bahá’í.

He then inquired, “For what reason have you
accepted this religion?”

I responded, “Now is not an opportune time for such
> a discussion, but I will briefly mention that whatever other
> people, whether it be of the Jewish, the Christian, the
> Muslim, or others, consider as the proof of the truth of the
> Prophets of their own age, Who are the Manifestations of
> the divine names and attributes, which has caused them to
> turn unto these Prophets, we have seen a greater profusion
> and a mightier manifestation of that from the Primal Point
> [the Báb] and the Blessed Beauty [Bahá’u’lláh] and that is
> why we have come to believe. Furthermore, by the
> prophecies of the Sacred Scriptures of the past we can
> adduce proofs that the glad tidings of the appearance of this
> Sanctified Being, namely, His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh, Who has
> arisen to edify the whole of humanity, have been recorded in
> the Old and New Testaments and in all the other Scriptures
> of the past, and the time of His manifestation has been fixed
as well.’

He then inquired, ‘What about the Qur’an?’ I
> responded, ‘We do not produce proofs for the Christians
> based on the Qur’an; rather we adduce from the Torah and
> the Bible. We speak to the Muslims from the Qur’an and
> reason from it. We, the people of Bahá, desire that a
> gathering be organized where the ‘ulamá of each religion
> would assemble, and the ‘ulamá of this party [Bahá’í Faith]
> would be invited as well, where we could present and state

> with manifest clarity and lucidity our proofs and arguments
> about the truth of this Cause. That way the reality of this
Faith would be clear and obvious to the entire world.’

The interrogator wrote all these words, but the place
> where it is mentioned that we do not speak of the Qur’an to
> the Christians was not correctly rendered by the interpreter.

The Sud realized that there had been an error in the translation [of
my deposition], at which point I stated, “Today, the Torah, the Bible and
the Qur’an are the limit of people’s understanding. We believe in the
religion and the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.”

At the beginning it had been decreed that the court would be in
session for three days, eight hours each day. However, because a great
multitude was at hand, a fourth day was also added, to which three hours
in the morning and three hours of discussions, after two hours into the
night had already been added. The fourth day, however, [the court]
concluded before noon. Altogether, the sessions took twenty-one hours.

After the conclusion, the honored predsedatel announced, “This
work is completed. If the witnesses and the Bábís wish to leave, [the
Court] will not hinder them.” Together with the prokuror and other
members, he went into a secluded room to deliberate on the case.

After this announcement, some people left [the building and]
dispersed, and in their vain imaginings had stated, “The Bábís were all
condemned, and the prisoners were liberated and have been released!”
The impatient people had believed these and once again commenced
mischief, abuse and insult. They went by the homes of Mullá Ahmad,
Mashhadí Jalíl and Mashhadí Samad and had given the glad tidings, and
had readied sheep for sacrifice. Sherbet was also prepared. Everyone
anticipated the defendants’ imminent arrival. Two men had brought two
sheep onto the path so that when the prisoners were freed he would
sacrifice them [the sheep] before their feet.

Suddenly it then happened that the people, having heard the
court’s ruling, began to exit the Qulup in a manner that betrayed their
inner agitation and with faces flushed with agitation. They informed
others of the Sud’s decision and the poor people who had brought sheep

were deeply disappointed and, hiding the sheep under their ‘abá or
jackets, quickly dispersed with heads hung low in shame.

[The Verdict]
In short, the decision of the Sud was:

> The two murderers, ‘Alí-Akbar and ‘Alí-Bábá, are to be
> hanged. Asadu’lláh Ardabílí and another are to be
> imprisoned for two years in Badkubih. Mullá Ahmad, Mullá
> Mihdí, Mashhadí Samad and Mashhadí Jalíl are to be exiled
and imprisoned in Siberia for fourteen years.

This is the justice that has been decreed for them.

> However, if the honored General Kamaroff wishes to
reduce the sentence, he is permitted to do so.

Two others have been seized in error, since the
> illustrious Bábís have made no mention of them. As such
> they are free to leave.

God is my witness, what immense joy and elation overcame the
friends, and what sadness and grief resulted for the enemies! Complete
separation took place that day [between the Bahá’ís and the Muslims].
This occurred in the year 1307 AH [1889], and the number of that day of
separation was also three hundred and seven past one thousand. “Verily,
the Day of Sorting Out is a thing appointed.”103 On that day the truth of all the
blessed utterances that previously had been revealed in the Kitáb-i Aqdas
and the realization of which was eagerly anticipated by the servants,
stood manifest. Blessed and exalted be His utterance:

> O Land of Kha! We hear from thee the voices of heroes, raised in
> glorification of thy Lord, the All-Possessing, the Most Exalted. Blessed
> be the day in which the banners of the divine Names shall be upraised
> in the kingdom of creation in My Name, the All-Glorious. On that
> day the faithful shall rejoice in the victory of God, and the unbelievers
shall lament.

None must contend with those who wield authority over the
> people; leave unto them that which is theirs, and direct your attention to
> men’s hearts.104

Consider that this event took place in ‘Ishqabad which is part of
[the old] Khurasan and also of Kharazm105, and how justice was decreed
and none was able to protest against it, as it was revealed, “None must
contend with those who wield authority over the people.”

Further, the hoisting of the banners,106 which was the appearance
of those sanctified and steadfast souls, was most evident, as were the joy
of the faithful and the lament of the unbeliever. Not one blessed word
[of Bahá’u’lláh] remained that did not come to pass in fulfillment.
However, most people are steeped in ignorance and, much like the
people of the past [i.e. the tribe of Ad, who rejected the Prophet Húd],
they say, “Bring us what thou threatenest us with, if it so be that thou tellest the
truth!”107

[Intercession of Bahá’ís]
104 The Kitab-i Aqdas, verses K94 and K95.
105 All of this seems to have been anticipated by Bahá’u’lláh years earlier in His
prophetic statement in the Kitáb-i Aqdas, K94. Regarding that passage, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
has commented that it referred to the establishment of the Bahá’í community of
‘Ishqabad: “The Blessed Beauty had mentioned Khurasan, stating that this blessed
Cause would be propagated from there. Everyone thought that His sanctified intent
was Khurasan. However, through the bounties of the Blessed Beauty all were
directed towards ‘Ishqabad and everyone realized His intent was that city.
Afterwards, a Mashriqu’l-Adhkar was established in that location;” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
talk in Haifa on 14 February 1914, quoted in Fádil Mázandarání, Amr va Khalq, vol.
4, p. 434. See also, Amr va Khalq, vol. 4, pp. 434-34, for a talk of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in
Haifa on 29 June 1914.
106 A reference to the above-cited passage from the Kitáb-i Aqdas regarding, “Blessed

the day on which the banners of the divine Names shall be upraised in the kingdom of creation in
My Name, the All-Glorious.”
Two days after the court pronounced its decision, the relatives and
kinsmen of Mullá Ahmad, Mashhadí Jalíl and Mashhadí Samad came to
the friends and asked, “Since the Sud has given authority to the General
to reduce the sentences of the offenders, we implore you to go before
him and to intercede on their behalf. Perchance he would overlook their
crime or lessen their punishment.” The friends consulted and decided
that, in company of several of the family and kinsmen of the convicts,
they would visit the General and intercede on their behalf.

As such, several of us went before the General along with the
relatives of the offenders. We stated, “We have come for the purpose of
interceding and intervening, beseeching you, if possible, to pardon their
felony, or if that is not possible, to reduce their sentence. We are deeply
grateful and thankful to you. Our main purpose was that our meekness
and their oppression and acrimony be established. Praise belongs to
God, that out of the bounty of the glorious and just Russian
government, this came to pass. Furthermore, we have no will for
revenge or retribution.”

The honored General stated, “What you have just said
demonstrates the height of your humanity and charity. However, by the
civil law, and to protect the nation, it is imperative that they be punished.
The action of these men has ruined the Governor’s reputation and
invited castigation upon the authorities. Soon in all the newspapers it will
be published that in a certain location in the Russian realm certain
people have raised a tumult and, in broad daylight, in the middle of the
bazaar, have killed someone over a religious argument. This will be seen
as an indication of chaos and disorder in this nation and her institutions.
And that would be a disgrace for the government.”

We responded, “If it is possible. If not, you know best how to
administer your affairs.” Thereupon we left his presence. The relatives
also left disappointed.

[Iran’s Inability to Intervene]
Immediately thereafter, their leaders began to telegraph the ‘ulamá in
Tehran, Tabriz and Mashhad. In turn, the ‘ulamá collectively appealed to

the government [of Iran], pleading and requesting: “If the decision of the
Sudja is implemented, it would be a dishonor for the [Iranian] authorities
and nation, since for merely slaying a Bábí, several persons will be
harshly punished. What insolence is greater than this, that for killing a
Bábí – of whom five by five or ten by ten are killed or burned in Iran,
and we consider so doing to be a source of honor – such misery and
disgrace is brought upon the Muslims in this land of infidels. What
calamity, what adversity! O our world, O our religion! Islam is lost! How
the precious religion has become worthless and how the luminous nation
has become dark!”

The government responded [to the ‘ulamá], “The conduct of civil
laws in foreign countries is not subject to our intervention from outside.
Moreover, the person who was killed was our subject as well. Did that
helpless soul not have a wife and children? By whose permission or
behest did they carry out this act [of murder]? Was it by the
government’s leave or through a fatwá of the ‘ulamá? Of a certainty,
unilateral deeds will have such a result!”

Therefore, in a Tablet revealed after the martyrdom of Hájí
Muhammad-Ridá and addressed to the believers of ‘Ishqabad, it was
revealed, “they have neither a helper, nor a succorer”, because His Majesty
Násiri’d-Dín Shah also refused to support them [i.e. the convicts] or to
intercede on their behalf.

[Bahá’u’lláh’s Counsel]
At this point that blessed Tablet is cited. Glorified and mighty is His
utterance.

> O My loved-ones in that land! Ye are the keys to the portals of
> constancy amidst the people and the standard of guidance among the
> creatures. Through you the oneness of God’s essence and His sanctity
hath been established.

We counsel ye, O chosen ones of God, to wisdom and to that
which exalts thy station.

Blessed art thou and those who love thee wholly for the sake of
> the Cause of God, the Lord of earth and heaven, and the Lord of the
Most Exalted Throne.

Take heed lest ye be frightened by the tumult of the people who
> have cast justice behind them and clung to cruelty. Verily, they are in a
> severe chastisement, and they have neither a helper nor a succorer.
> Erelong will the winds of retribution surround them from every
direction.

Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the Avenger.

If this lowly one were to include all the Tablets revealed from the
heaven of Divine Will and Bounty regarding this incident, these pages
would not suffice, and the discussion would lead to prolixity.

Subsequent to the conclusion of the gathering of the Sudja and the
issuance of its verdict, this lowly one wrote all the details to the sacred
presence of the Beloved of the World [Bahá’u’lláh]. Several other friends
wrote as well. After a short while a package containing two Tablets in
honor of various believers was received. At the end of those Tablets, a
Visitation [Tablet] in the name of the honored martyred Hájí was
revealed as well. That sanctified Tablet was in honor of this ephemeral
servant and it is cited at this point. Exalted is His utterance and all-
encompassing are His bounties.

In His Name that is Omnipotent over all Names!

Verily the decreed time has arrived and the Revealer of verses
> has come from the Heaven of His Cause with a power that will not be
> weakened by the tyrannies of the evildoers, who have broken God’s
> Covenant and His Testament and who have slain God’s friends
> without the leave or authority of Him Who is the Sovereign over them.
> We testify that these are indeed the ones who have wrought mischief and
> corruption in the land after its betterment, and who have shown
> ingratitude towards the bounty of tranquility when indeed that
> tranquility and bounty were realized and spread abroad by virtue of the
> justice of the sovereign of that country and his power.

In such wise does this Wronged One voice His utterance as He

the night season.

O thou ‘Alí before Akbar! Upon thee be My Glory and loving

of piety.

O Pen! Call to remembrance the one who was martyred in the
Path of God!

And Say:
> May the first effulgence of light which has shone from the heaven

[The Day of Execution]
In short, no matter what effort they exerted towards regaining the
convicts’ liberty, it bore no fruit. For a while they were incarcerated in
‘Ishqabad’s prison, associating with those of their own character and
kind. Each day, they anticipated freedom and emancipation until it was

108 The Visitation Tablet is also cited in Muhammad-‘Alí Faízí, Lá’lí Dirakhshán, pp.
213-17
109 A slight modification of a rendering by Dr. Khazeh Fananapazir posted on

Tarjuman Internet discussion group in June 2007.

announced that on the following day the two murderers would be hung
and the others sent on their banishment to Siberia.

They erected gallows for the two condemned near the Governor’s
Ark [office]. Mounted soldiers were at hand and a company of soldat
[soldiers] and several cannons were readied too. These preparations were
made since some of the crass elements, who blindly consider religious
intolerance as their sacred duty, had stated, “If they try to send these
men to Siberia or hang anyone for slaying a Bábí, whose killing in our
religion is a compulsory duty, we will revolt and raise a jihád [holy war].
Even if we are slain, we will be considered martyrs.” This news had
reached the Governor. Therefore, he had ordered that everything that
was needed for security and public protection be readied.

People had gathered to observe the proceedings. The convicts
were brought out in chains and fetters. The two murderers were brought
by the gallows and compelled to ascend the structure beneath which a
hole was dug, so that after the execution their remains could be
deposited in that hole and covered. Each man was wearing a burial cloth.

[The Czar’s Ruling]
When they were about to place the nooses around their necks, the
honorable Prokuror, who was present, stated, “Wait.” He then pulled out
a piece of paper and read the proclamation in Russian and motioned the
translator to render it into Turkish and Persian.

The essence of his remark was: After several of us [i.e. Bahá’ís]
had gone before the General to intercede [for the attackers], he had sent
a telegram with all the details to the Great Emperor [Alexander III],
mentioning that the illustrious Bábís had come to intervene on behalf of
the convicts. His Majesty the Emperor had forwarded that
communication to the Senate110 with instructions to telegraph what they

110The original phrase is majlis shawr, which literally means “consultative assembly.”
However, Prof. Youli Ioannesyan (private communications, 26 September 2007) has
brought to my attention that it was only the Senate which functioned as the
Supreme Judicial Body and the highest institution which could reconsider a court
verdict.

thought best to General Kamaroff. The Senate had consulted and
decided that it was best that the intercession of the Bábís be accepted to
some degree, so that the opponents’ enmity would be reduced. They
resolved that the two men who were to be executed should not be killed,
but instead be sent for life-imprisonment to Siberia, and the other
convicts who had been given 14 years imprisonment have their
sentences reduced by half, that is, each be incarcerated for seven years.
The Emperor had signed this decree and telegraphed it to General
Kamaroff, who had kept it confidential.

On that day when a large multitude from every group and sect was
present, this background was conveyed in detail, emphasizing, “The
Great Emperor has issued such a decree solely at the request of the
Bábís for a reduction of the sentences; otherwise the original
punishment would have been carried out.”

[The Convicts’ End]
After hearing this proclamation, the two men who had been readied for
hanging, stated, “We do not consent to the intercession of the Bábís. Of
a certainty, death is preferred for us.”

They were joined with others who had their heads shaven and a
Russian hat placed inverted on their heads. They were put on board a
carriage, and with pomp, ceremony and much following brought to the
rail station where a special cabin was prepared for them. They boarded
and were sent on their banishment.

Two of them expired along the journey. The two murderers were
sent to a location from which no news or trace of them was ever heard.
Two more died shortly after arrival. Mullá Mihdí fled to Iran and after
six months died, and his soul returned to its original abode. Of all of
them, only Mullá Ahmad Yazdí remained as an example and a lesson to
anyone who had not seen others who had vanished, so they would see
him and be warned.

At all events, the aim of describing all these details was that the
men of insight and those endowed with wisdom would recognize the
meaning and purpose of the blessed verse, “Fain would they put out God’s

light with their mouths; but God only desireth to perfect His light, albeit the infidels
abhor it”111 stood evident and manifest.

This is because when they had gathered and consulted, the men of
enmity had stated, “As protectors of the perspicuous creed [Islam] and
the followers of the religion of the Prince of Messengers [Prophet
Muhammad], we must arise and exert effort to ensure that not one of
these people [Bahá’ís] remains resident in ‘Ishqabad. We must kill a few
of them and then the remaining ones will understand their situation and
will leave this region.” They unanimously thought this to be the best plan
and were united on this course. They selected two individuals for [to
carry out] the martyrdom of the honored Hájí and paid them two-
hundred manát. However, they were neglectful of the effect of the
blessed words, “God only desireth to perfect His light.” That is, God, despite
their lack of awareness, will manifest His light over the horizon of the
city of love [‘Ishqabad], brightening and illuminating the entire world
with its effulgence and rays.

As has been revealed in a Tablet addressed to this lowly one –
exalted be His grandeur and lofty be His might, “There is no will to oppose
His irrevocable decree, nor is there a hindrance to impede his injunction. Verily, he is
the All-Powerful, the Almighty, the Wise.” And this was one of the six Tablets
mentioned earlier that came in an envelope addressed to this ephemeral
one – among which was the Tablet for the honored martyr that
contained allusions to his martyrdom.

At any rate, in one of the Tablets it was revealed, “Say: Do not be
saddened by the fire of enmity and sedition that hath been enkindled through the
cruelty of the servants’ hearts. I swear by the effulgence of the Divine Visage which is
radiant and resplendent over the Supreme Horizon, such affairs exalt the Word of
God and so shall it forever remain.”

What has been shared should suffice the men of insight. However,
for those without discernment, no matter what is mentioned it would be
insufficient. For this reason it has been revealed, “if they saw every one of the

111   Qur’an 9:32. Translation from Shoghi Effendi, The Dawn-Breakers, p. 19.

signs, they will not believe in them.”112 And who is more truthful than God?
“And whose word can be truer than God’s?”113

[Bahá’u’lláh’s Reaction]
At any rate, if I were to cite all the Tablets in this regard that were
revealed before and after the martyrdom of the honored Hájí, then a
separate book would have to be prepared.

In the conclusion, this exalted and holy Tablet, which is evidence
of the bounty and favor [of Bahá’u’lláh] upon the everlasting
government of Russia – may God exalt her – is included. For centuries
and ages, the good mention of her name will endure in this blessed
Tablet and is also recorded in other Tablets as well.

> He is the Protector, the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent!
O Husayn! Upon thee rest My Glory!

I testify that thou hast attained unto that which was concealed

Lord of both worlds.

112  Qur’an 6:25. The complete verse is: Of them there are some who (pretend to) listen to
thee; but We have thrown veils on their hearts, so they understand it not, and deafness in their ears;
if they saw every one of the signs, they will not believe in them; in so much that when they come to
thee, they (but) dispute with thee; the Unbelievers say: "These are nothing but tales of the ancients."

114 With some slight variation, this Tablet also appears in Baron Victor Rosen,
Collections Scientifiques de l’Institut des Langues Orientales, Vol. VI, Manuscrits Arabes,

Numerous Tablets have been revealed by the Ancient Beauty
[Bahá’u’lláh] – may His mention be exalted – for the honored Hájí, the
martyr. Certain items from the Blessed Beauty were with that esteemed
personage as well.115 For instance, an ‘abá that the Blessed Beauty had
worn at one time over His shoulders was with him [Hájí Muhammad-
Ridá]. Some of these relics were in Isfahan in the care of his brother.

A daughter of the honored martyr also remained in Isfahan. Some
other holy relics he possessed were in the care of the honored Áqá Siyyid
Ahmad Afnán, while some others were with Áqá Ghulám-Husayn.

Moreover, Áqá Ghulám-Husayn also kept the clothes worn [by the
Hájí] at the time of his martyrdom, which were torn into pieces by the
knives and daggers that cut him. There were kept in the same blood-
soaked manner.

The Hájí used to say, “I have collected many precious items,
including calligraphy done in emeralds which I have kept in Isfahan. It is
more excellent than all other calligraphies by Dervish Muhammad, Mír
‘Imád or others.”

Tablet is missing the portion from “O Husayn” to “the bounty of God, the Lord of the
Most Mighty Throne.”
115 Similar to other religious traditions, many early Bahá’ís treasured items associated

with the Founders of the Faith or other important figures of Bábí and Bahá’í
history, and often considered such possessions means of attracting divine
benediction.

Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl’s Treatise – An Excerpt

25 February 1903

[While in the United States, Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl wrote a treatise outlining the history
of the Bahá’í community of ‘Ishqabad. This document was reprinted in
Pazhuheshnameh, vol. 4, pp. 122-26. The first portion of this treatise – offered in
translation below – focuses on the town’s geography, general history, and martyrdom of
Hájí Muhammad-Ridá. The second portion traces the construction and inauguration
of the city’s Mashriqu’l-Adhkar. Translator.]

In the Name of God, the Most Glorious!

There is a desert between Iran and the regions of Turkestan which
in the ancient times was called the Plain of Khavaran or the Plain of
Kharazm, and presently it is known as the Plain of Turkmenia. This
region is bounded on the east by the city of Bukhara and on the west by
Iran and on the south by Afghanistan and on the north by Bahr Khazar,
which the Europeans call the Caspian Sea or Qazvin.

The farms on this Plain are irrigated by three well known rivers.

The first is the River Jayhun116, that is, the River Amu, which is one of
the best known rivers in the east. It originates from the Bilurdagh
[Pamir] Mountains and reaches the Aral Sea. The average width of this
river is three miles. The second is the Murghab River with the famous
town of Marv located on her banks. The third is the Tejen River which
passes by the town of Tejen.

The Russian government built the [Trans-Caspian] rail system that
connects the Caspian Sea to Bukhara in 48 hours. In the southwest of
this region is a mountain which separates Iran’s province of Khurasan

116Jayhun is a derivative of Gihun, the biblical name for one of the four rivers of
the Garden of Eden.

from Russian dependencies in Turkmen, and the city of ‘Ishqabad is
situated on the foot of this mountain on the side of the city of Quchan,
which is a pasture for the Ekrad-Zafaranlu Tribe who are the bravest of
tribesmen in Khurasan and for a long time maintained the boarder of
Iran.

The town of ‘Ishqabad is a newly-built city. It was raised 22 years
ago and became the seat of the governor of the Russian government.
That is, after Skobelev, the brave Russian General, defeated the
Turkmen army after a year of battles near Kuk-Tappeh, most of the
region came under the control of the luminous Russian government.117
However, due to his excessive killings, the Great Emperor [Alexander
III] dismissed him from military command and installed in his place
117Mikhail Dmitrievich Skobelev (1843–82) was a Russian general famous for his
conquest of Central Asia and heroism during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78.
His second tour in Turkestan was in 1880-81 where he distinguished himself in
undoing disasters inflicted by the Tekke Turkmen, captured Geok-Tepe, and, after
much slaughter, reduced the Akhal-Tekke region to submission. He was advancing
on ‘Ishqabad and Kalat Nadiri when he was disavowed and recalled.

[General] Kamaroff, who was among the prominent figures of the
Russian government, a man known and respected for great dignity,
confidence, immense intellect and deep wisdom.

The aforementioned Kamaroff built a military compound in a
barren desert, which was an uncultivated plain, on the spot where the
city of ‘Ishqabad is situated. Without war or bloodshed, he brought the
rest of the Plain of Khavaran under the rule of the [Russian]
government, and part of the province, including the portion on the east
from the city of Marv to the Jayhun and south until the hard plateau of
the city of Balkh, where the Saruq and Salur tribes and their dairy
animals roam.

When this large territory was conquered by Russia and the
standard of security and justice was hoisted over it, merchants and
craftsmen from the cities of Khurasan and the regions of the Caucasus
came to that military fort [which became ‘Ishqabad] for work and
trading. As such, the doors of commerce and business, which had been
closed with Turkmen tribes for some four-hundred years, were
reopened. And finding immense opportunities, these merchants and
craftsmen began to build the city of ‘Ishqabad under the supervision of
Russian engineers.

The condition of the town of ‘Ishqabad, in terms of its stability,
spread, streets, stores, cultivated park and gardens, is similar to the city
of Washington. All the homes are built in the middle of adorned
orchards, trees and fragrant flower gardens. All the streets have special
trees planted on both sides and brooks with flowing water. Russian
sanitation workers and officials exert the utmost effort in keeping clean
all the roads and homes. Not for a minute are they negligent in
administering the affairs of the city, since it is situated at the crossroads
of four renowned countries and, from the perspective of commerce and
politics, it has a most evident importance. This is because on the east it
boarders Turan [Central Asia] and Turkistan, on west Khurasan and
other regions of Iran, on the south Balkh and Afghanistan, and on the
north the Caucasus and Tajikistan.

At the beginning of the formation of the city of ‘Ishqabad, when
merchants and craftsmen were coming to this town from diverse and far

away places, about twenty-two or three of the people of Bahá and
companions of the Crimson Ark also came from Khurasan, the city of
Yazd and other places, to engage in trading or their profession.

Though numerically fewer than other groups, with the utmost
honesty and trustworthiness, these individuals [Bahá’ís] exerted great
effort towards the development of the town, as they had been taught
through the commandments of the Supreme Pen [Bahá’u’lláh] to
observe good behavior, friendly association [with people of all religions],
integrity, and morality. Therefore, more than other groups, they received
the favor and esteem of the authorities of the Russian government, her
administrators and military chiefs, and won the trust of all Christian
people and denominations.

Since the majority of the inhabitants of ‘Ishqabad were Turks from
the Caucasus or thugs rejected from Adharbayjan, who ignorantly and
fanatically were entrenched in the Shi‘a creed and had innate enmity
towards the people of Bahá, this esteem [from the authorities] fueled the
fire of their hate and loathing.

Instigated by the Shi‘a merchants, before noon on 8 September
1889, corresponding to 12 Muharram 1307 AH, in full view of the
public, in the midst of ‘Ishqabad’s large bazaar, two Tabrízí hoodlums
martyred the late Hájí Muhammad-Ridá Isfahání with thirty-three
incisions from their daggers and knives. Since the martyred Hájí was well
known to Governor Kamaroff and other administrators and military
commanders for his dignity, tranquility, pleasant character and rectitude
of conduct and was martyred in a most heinous and brutal manner – the
details of which are extensive and are beyond the scope of this short
tract – this greatly increased the Russian government’s affection for the
Bahá’ís.118 In particular, during the subsequent trial, the officials of the
Russian government observed such serenity, composure, honesty,
truthfulness, clemency and peace in the friends of God [Bahá’ís] that
their hearts were greatly attracted and the fame of these people [Bahá’ís]
was spread among the regions of Russia, the Caucasus, and
Turkmenistan.

The original text refers to ummat Bahá’í. Ummat is an Islamic term indicating the

\[118\] 
body of believers or the nation of the faithful.

By accident, the author of this treatise lived in ‘Ishqabad at the
time, and represented [the Bahá’í community] at the trial along with the
honored Áqá Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím Ardabílí, who was one of the finest
Bahá’ís residing in ‘Ishqabad. This trial lasted about three months.119
Due to sympathies with their coreligionists, the prominent figures in Iran
all supported the murderers of the late Hájí Muhammad-Ridá.

At last this trial acquired such importance that in accordance with
the instructions of the late Alexander III [reign 1881-94], the late Great
Emperor of Imperial Russia, a military court, which in Russian is called
Voennyi Sudja and is uniquely empowered to issue death sentences, was
commissioned for this purpose from [St.] Petersburg.

Upon arrival in ‘Ishqabad, for three days and nights, this military
Sudja, whose members were all high-ranking Russian Generals, convened
and conducted the trial.

At the end, the veracity of the Bahá’ís was established as was the
guilt of seven prominent Shi‘as who in private had connived to murder
the late martyr [Hájí Muhammad-Ridá]. One of the convicts was of the
‘ulamá and had a pulpit. The court ruled that of these seven, two should
be executed by hanging and the other five sent to Siberia for life
imprisonment with hard labor.

After the ruling, the leaders of the Shi‘a appealed to the Bahá’ís,
who also deemed the execution of the foes to be most undesirable.
Therefore, this servant, the aforementioned honored Áqá Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-
Karím Ardabílí and two other merchant Bahá’ís went before Governor
Kamaroff, interceded on behalf of the convicts and in a most pleasant
manner implored that great man to reduce their punishment. This was
by reason of the fact that in the ruling it had been written that for three
days the illustrious Governor was permitted to reduce the sentences.

Fortunately, this intercession greatly increased the affection of the
authorities of the Russian government towards the Bahá’ís. It was also
approved in sanctified presence of the Beauty of the Cause [Bahá’u’lláh],
exalted is His Name, the Most Exalted, Who showered His bounties and
favors. In many Tablets, this pious act was mentioned, for never before

119Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl is referring to the period from the martyrdom, 8 September, to
the court’s decision on 21 November 1889.

had any [of the Bahá’í communities] interceded on behalf of its enemies
and saved from death those whose sole object was to slay Bahá’ís.

In short, in the manner that has been described, day by day the
credibility of the friends of God [Bahá’ís] rose in the eyes of the
prominent men of that realm, and their confidence and trust in all the
Bahá’ís was thoroughly confirmed.

> Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl:
> 28 December 1911

[Over two decades after Hájí Muhammad-Ridá’s martyrdom and the subsequent
trial, Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl briefly recalled that incident in his celebrated Burhán Lámi‘
[The Brilliant Proof].120 Even though this work was translated and published in
1912, a revised rendering of this section is included below. Translator.]

Numerous historical and tangible evidences can be furnished to
demonstrate and prove that it was the very powerful and mighty pen of
Bahá’u’lláh which protected from death His own enemies, such as Subh
Azal, Násiri’d-Dín Shah and certain great divines and clerics. Otherwise
[i.e. had it not been for the influence of Bahá’u’lláh’s pen], the Bábís
would not have allowed a single one of these people to escape alive.
Indeed, it was Bahá’u’lláh who, through the effect of sanctified, celestial
utterances – utterances even more refreshing than the zephyrs of the
morn wafting from the rose-garden and even more limpid than the
vernal rain which distils drop by drop from the fragrant rose-petals –
through these He so trained the friends that the people of the world
were amazed and astonished. For these possessors of heart and soul –
who astonished and bewildered the enemy as well as the warriors of
other nations by their valor, heroism, strength of heart, firmness and
resolution in the terrible battles of Nayriz, Zanjan and Mazandaran, and
three hundred and thirteen of whom resisted in battle [at the fort of
Shaykh Tabarsi] thousands of regular troops of the government during

many months – these were so trained in tenderness of heart and
gentleness of disposition through the luminous teachings of Bahá’u’lláh
that during the long years from the time of His arrival in Baghdad down
to the present day, they have shown forbearance and self-restraint
throughout many seminal events and have not committed that which
would disturb any soul or be contrary to the law of any government.
They were killed but they killed no one. They endured violent calamities
but their tongues were not loosened in complaint.

When the late Hájí Muhammad-Ridá Isfahání suffered martyrdom
in the city of Ishqábád in 1889 AD, the chief of police found the city in
great excitement and the Bahá’ís exposed to danger. He therefore
permitted the Bahá’ís to carry arms, but they did not do so, considering
death better than self-defense. The government then engaged in the trial
of those who had conspired and murdered the martyrs. After five
months’ of investigation, examining and hearing from both sides, a High
Justice of the Ministry of War, accompanied by an imposing body [of
judges and officials], arrived at ‘Ishqábád from [St.] Petersburg. An open
court, the account of whose proceedings would lead to prolixity, was
held. That court ordered that the two murderers be hanged and the
conspirators imprisoned for life in Siberia and subjected to hard labor.

Since the governor of the province had the right during the
subsequent three days to lessen this penalty, four of the Bahá’ís appeared
before him. This great man was Kamaroff, the victor of Merv and the
viceroy of the province. They interceded on behalf of the condemned
murderers. As the governor was greatly pleased with the excellent
conduct and good manners of the Bahá’ís, he accepted their intercession
and exercised his authority by changing the verdict of hanging into exile
and reducing the punishment of the others from hard labor to simple
confinement.

The incidents referred to are not based upon hearsay but are
recorded in the register of the government of ‘Ishqábád and in other
official papers.

Now, could such pure morality, kindness and gentleness, such
training and noble conduct be inculcated by one who had attempted
murder and who sought to poison his own brother? What then becomes

of the words of His Holiness Christ: “Ye shall know the tree by its
fruit”? And what becomes of the criterion embodied in the words:
“Thou makest righteous by Thy words and Thou judgest by Thy
sayings”?

Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl – Undated

[Fádil Mazandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 5, footnote on p. 386, cites an
undated passage attributed to Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl. While Mazandarání appears to
offer this as an extract from a document composed by Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl, a close
reading suggests the possibility that it is a summary prepared by Mazandarání based
on the writings of the great Mírzá. As such, the provenance of this document requires
further research. Translator.]

After the judge had heard the witnesses of both sides, the public
prosecutor rose and for almost three hours spoke in Russian, proving
the crime of the eight accused. He asked for the execution of six
prisoners and the banishment of the remaining ones. The response by
the attorney of the murderers bore no fruit, as the public prosecutor had
established their guilt.

Thereupon, the chief judge and the other four judges retired to a
separate room for consultation. They returned after an hour and a half
and read their decision as follows:

> ‘Alí-Husayn and ‘Alí-Bábá are to be hung. Mullá Ahmad
> Tájir Yazdí, Mashhadí Jalíl and Mashhadí Ahmad
> Adharbayjání are banished forthwith for imprisonment to
> Siberia with hard labor. Nasru’lláh is hereby banished to a
> nearby town for two and a half years [imprisonment]. Mullá
> Mihdí Tabrízí, the preacher and rawdih-khán,121 is to be
> banished for life to Siberia with hard labor, as he used his
> pulpit to curse and insult [the Bahá’ís] and ordered the
> murder of Hájí Muhammad-Ridá.

121A rawdih-khán is one who is a professional narrator of the events surrounding
the martyrdom of Husayn, the third Imam, at Karbala.

It is ordered that these decisions be put into effect in
> three days time, before which Governor Kamaroff is
> empowered to reduce or lessen the sentence of each convict.

During these three days, cannons were trained on the city, and
foot soldiers and cavalry were charged to guard all the roads and the
outskirts of the town.

When the opponents were disappointed from all their attempts [to
rescue the prisoners], they went to the believers expressing remorse,
shame and need. Therefore, Áqá Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl,122 Áqá Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-
Karím, Mashhadí Yúsuf Mílání, Áqá Husayn-‘Alí Tájir Yazdí and some
others, on behalf of the Bahá’í community, went before the Governor
and expressed their gratitude, and also interceded for the foes. They
pleaded to such a degree that he softened somewhat and expressed his
astonishment at the Cause of the Abhá Beauty and the pleasing conduct
of the Bahá’ís. He promised that he would exert efforts to bring about a
reduction of the convicts’ sentences – for the efforts of the Shah,
merchants and ‘ulamá had produced no result.

Therefore, on the appointed day [for the executions], the public
prosecutor read the Governor’s proclamation that, in accordance with
the request of the Bahá’ís, the sentences were to be reduced. This news
was printed in all the newspapers and the people of ‘Ishqabad expressed
their immense gratitude to the Bahá’ís and showed them respect.

122 One clue that this document may not have been composed by Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl
is that it is unlikely that he would have referred to himself by name.

A Report by the British Embassy

on 17 December 1889

[On 18 December 1889, Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, who was the British
Minister in Tehran (April 1888-November 1890), forwarded to London a
memorandum by (later Sir) Henry George Outram Bax Ironside, a British
Diplomat, on the martyrdom of Hájí Muhammad-Ridá and the subsequent events.
For this report, the British officers were relying on reports that reached Iran, almost
certainly through Shi‘ite channels. This report appears in Moojan Momen, The Bábí
and Bahá'í Religions 1844-1944 Some Contemporary Western Accounts, pp. 298-
99, and identified as “Memo by Bax Ironside 17 Dec. 1889, enclosed in Wolff to
Salisbury No. 235, 18 Dec. 1889: FO 60 502”. Translator.]

A Babi was murdered in the bazaar at Ashkabad during the month of
Moharram (August last) by some Persians of the Shiah sect. He was
stabbed in cold blood for scoffing at the Mohammadan religion and faith
in Islam.

The prisoners, nine in number, were tried in Ashkabad in the
Russian Court of Justice and, after a trial lasting several days, two of the
prisoners were sentenced to death, two were acquitted, one was
sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year at Ashkabad, and the
remaining four, all respectable Persian merchants, to fifteen years penal
servitude in Siberia.

These sentences were delivered in Ashkabad on the 21st
November and when known created intense excitement at Mashad and
other religious quarters. The Babis of Ashkabad gave cash presents
amounting to 6,000 roubles to the Russian officials and begged the latter

to protect them123: they stated that they could not live in Persia and
purposed taking refuge in the Russian Empire.

General Komaroff took their part and reported to the Russian
Government that if the sentences were not carried out he would be
unable to maintain order in Ashkabad and the Mohammadans would
commit murders daily.

On the news reaching the Russian Consul General at Mashad he
went at once to see Agha Sheikh Mohammad Taki, one of the most
influential of the Ulama, and he assured the Sheikh that he would get the
prisoners released and the sentences cancelled.

On December 1st M. de Velassow124 sent his translator to inform
the Sheikh that all the sentences had been cancelled. This statement has,
however, so far not been confirmed from any other quarters.

The Governor General of Khorassan, H.R.H. the Rukn-ud-
Dowleh, the Shah’s brother, the entire Ulama and all the religious party
at Mashad employed their united influence to obtain the remission of the
sentences and the Russian Legation was appealed to get them annulled, it
being pointed out that should they be carried out the Persians would, in
future, regard Russia as the foe of Islam and the friend of Babis,
renegades and of the Shah’s enemies in general.

On December 17th Mr Churchill had a conversation with the
Amin-us-Sultan, who said that the matter had been repeatedly discussed
with the Russian Legation, who asserted that they were powerless to
revoke a judgment already given by a law court; but that the Emperor
had the power of altering the death sentence to one of imprisonment for
life, and that the Persian Government should make any representations
they had to submit to His Imperial Majesty through the Persian Minister
at St Petersburgh.

The Persian Government, accordingly, had instructed its
representative at St Petersburgh to submit the matter to the Emperor
with the result that the death sentences have been commuted to

such offer or payment.

transportation to Siberia, and the other sentences to imprisonment of
lesser durations.

The Shah has directed his representative at St Petersburgh to
inform the Imperial Government that His Majesty is dissatisfied with
what has been done, as he considers transportation to Siberia is equal to
death.

Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl – Undated

[Fádil Mazandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 5, footnote on pp. 380-81, cites
the following summary of an oral report by Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl. While most of the
details provided in this report are available elsewhere in this monograph, it was
decided to include this report as it is one of only two instances (the other is in
Document 17) in which the identity of the presiding Chief Justice is given, which may
assist future archival research in Russia. Translator.]

Kamaroff, the Governor of Kharazm, said to the gathered Bahá’ís,
“During these seven years, I have thoroughly witnessed your well-
behaved manners. However, they have reported to me that you have
spoken contemptuously of the Imáms of their religion [Shi‘a Islam].”
The believers proved and established that they respect the Shí‘a Imáms.

At the Governor’s behest, they then submitted their petition
signed by nineteen believers. The Governor instructed the police chief,
Naftanoff, to place armed guards around our neighborhood and Bahá’í
shops and ensure the city was under security and protection, so that the
criminals and their instigators would not escape. That very night, four of
the mischief-makers were arrested.

In addition, it became known that three prominent Iranian
merchants and an accomplice, who was a rawdih-khán and a preacher,
had been the instigators of this sedition and had given the assassins
money and the promise of profit on real estate. Consequently, those four
were arrested and imprisoned as well.

It was at this time that an official investigation was initiated, and
the murderers and witnesses were questioned. The enemies sought every
means [to save themselves]. They even wrote to the Shah [of Iran] and
the ‘ulamá of Najaf. However, Kamaroff asked the Emperor to appoint
a high-ranking military judge. Therefore, Khaschnewski, who was a

deeply learned, perceptive, knowledgeable and wise man, and also the
chief of the military judiciary that in Russian is called the Suda, and who
had a high position serving as a prominent Russian military officer, was
appointed. He arrived with four other high-ranking judges. From all
directions, people came to observe, and Russian soldiers firmly
controlled the city.

A Report by Victor Rosen in 1891

[Baron Victor Romanovitch Rosen (1849-1908) was a distinguished academic,
Professor of Arabic at the Oriental Department of the Imperial Russian University
in St. Petersburg, and founder of the Russian Geographical Society. He translated
several collections of Bahá'í Writings into Russian, including publication in 1908 of
a large collection (185 pages) of Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh. He also prepared for
publication in the original Arabic and Persian a volume of Epistles by Bahá’u’lláh
and left detailed descriptions for many Bábí and Bahá’í manuscripts which at present
belong to the manuscript collection of the St. Petersburg Branch of the Institute of
Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Rosen also properly identified a
number of important Tablets, such as, Surih Muluk (The Surih of the Kings), as
revealed by Bahá’u’lláh. He encouraged his students A. G. Tumanski and others to
collect and study materials related to the Bábí and Bahá'í Faiths.

Using Rosen’s materials, after describing intense persecution of Bahá’ís in
Isfahan, Prof. Edward G. Browne notes the following in A Traveler’s Narrative, p.
411:

> An event which took place still more recently in the Russian dominions

Tumanski, who had, according to his own statements, first heard of the Bahá’ís
through an account in Reclus’s Universal Geography, which he had read while studying
for the entrance examination to the officer’s course in the military Oriental
Languages Training Section. But it was in the winter of 1889-90, when he read an
account of the martyrdom of Hájí Muhammad-Ridá in ‘Ishqabad and the manner in
which the Bahá’ís had intervened on behalf of the murderers that he determined to
investigate the religion more closely. The following summer, he asked special
permission to proceed to Transcaspia, and there met the Bahá’ís of ‘Ishqabad. He

Capitan Alexander Tumanski appears in A Traveler’s Narrative, p. 411-12 and is
cited below for ease of reference. Translator.]

At 7 a.m. on September 8th (August 27th, old style) 1889, two fanatical
Persian Shi‘ites, Mash-hadi ‘Alí Akbar and Mash-hadí Huseyn, threw
themselves, dagger in hand, on a certain Hájí Muhammad Rizá of
Isfahán, who was peaceably traversing one of the most frequented
streets of ‘Ishkábád, and inflicted on him 72 wounds, to which he
succumbed. Hájí Muhammad Rizá was one of the most respected of the
Bábís of ‘Ishkábád. The crime was perpetrated with such audacity that
neither the numerous witnesses of the occurrences, nor the constable
who was on the spot could save the victim of this odious attack. The
assassins yielded themselves up to the police without any resistance; they
were placed in a cab and conveyed to the prison. During the transit they
fell to licking up the blood which was dripping from their daggers. The
examination, conducted with much energy by the military tribunal, gave
as its result that Muhammad Rizá had fallen a victim to the religious
bigotry of the Shi‘ites. Fearful of Muhammad Rizá’s influence, the

names three Bahá’ís as having particularly helped him in his studies of the religion:
Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím-i-Ardibili (Asadov), Mírzá Yusif-i-Rashtí and Ustád ‘Ali-
Akbar.[83] In his later studies, Tumanski came into contact with the greatest of the
Bahá’í scholars, Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl-i-Gulpaygání, and was thus in a position to obtain
the most detailed and accurate information regarding the new religion. [83.
Tumanski, ‘Dva poslednikh’, pp. 314-16]”
126 This text is available at: http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/P-

T/R/Rosen/VolVI.htm

Shi‘ites of ‘Ishkábád, acting in accordance with the orders of Mullás who
had come expressly for this purpose from Khurásán, resolved to cut
short the Bábí propaganda by killing Hájí Muhammad Rizá. Knowing
well, however, that the crime would not remain unpunished, they left it
to chance to determine what persons should sacrifice themselves for the
Shi‘ite cause. Thus it was that the individuals named above became the
assassins of Muhammad Rizá, who had never injured them in any way.
The sentence of the tribunal was severe: ‘Alí Akbar and Huseyn, as well
as two of their confederates, were condemned to be hanged, but the
penalty of death was commuted by His Majesty the Emperor to hard
labor for life.

The sentence was hailed by the Bábís with an enthusiasm easy to
understand. It was the first time since the existence of the sect, i.e., for
nearly fifty years, that a crime committed on the person of an adherent
of the new religion had been punished with all the rigour of the law. The
impression produced on the chief of the sect, Behá [Bahá’u’lláh], appears
to have been equally profound. The two revelations which we shall submit
to the reader sufficiently prove this. They are also interesting from
another point of view: they are almost the only Bábí documents of which
we can understand all the meanings, all the allusions.127

127 Momen, The Bábí and Bahá'í Religions 1844-1944 Some Contemporary Western
Accounts, p. 297, notes: “In this account there is no mention of the fact that the
Bahá'ís astonished the Russian authorities by interceding for the murderers and
asking that the death penalty not be imposed. Tumanski, however, in an article[2]
published at about the same time as Rosen's work, refers to an account from
‘Ishqabad in the Journal Novoye Vremya which confirms this fact. Tumanski
himself arrived in ‘Ishqabad in June 1890, nine months after the event. [2.
Tumanski, ‘Dva poslednikh’, p. 315]

A Biography of Hájí Muhammad-Ridá

[Fádil Mazandarání offers a biography of Hájí Muhammad-Ridá which also
includes a synthesis of various accounts about his martyrdom.128 It is likely that
Mazandarání prepared this account in the 1930s or ‘40s. Translator.]

Among the renowned martyrs of Isfahan is Hájí Muhammad-Ridá, who
was a distinguished merchant. At the beginning of the disclosure of the
Cause of the Abhá Beauty, he attained faith, sincerity, fortitude and
perfection in teaching. His brothers, Áqá Mashhadí ‘Alí and Áqá
Muhammad-Taqí, became believers as well.

Uncontrollably and with great rapture, the Hájí would speak with
associates and strangers about of the truth of the wondrous Cause and
consequently gained fame as a Bábí and became a target of opposition
and attacks. Therefore, he was compelled to leave for Sabzivar and
remote regions of Khurasan, where he stayed for some time engaged in
commerce. After a while, he returned to his native town with
considerable capital and an expanded trade, and regained his residence.
He resolved to teach [the Faith] to his kinsmen and family, and with a
strong heart, deep-rooted faith, patience and fortitude, withstood the
hostility of the foes. This grew to the point that his aforementioned
brothers became concerned and anxious, and warned him. Time and
again, difficulties, imprisonments, financial impediments, insults and
humiliation were visited upon him.

In 1294 AH [1877], he was imprisoned with Mullá Kazim
Tálkhúnchih’í, whose account was given in the previous volume under
that year’s entry. Eventually he regained liberty through the efforts of the
Sultánu’sh-Shuhadá [the King of the Martyrs] and some other Bahá’ís.
128 Fádil Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 6, pp. 146-55, published at:
http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/arabic/vol3/tzh6/tzh6.htm

However, none of these occurrences had instilled the slightest fear or
caution in the Hájí. Nay, indeed they had propelled him to greater
heights of enthusiasm and activity in promotion of the Cause.

In 1302 AH [1884], in a teaching gathering that he regularly held in
his house on a specific day of the week, he introduced the wondrous
Cause to two men who were related to the Governor Zillu’s-Sultan and
some of the clerics. They reported what they had heard to the Governor
and the clergy, who commissioned a number of men to attack the Hájí’s
home [on the night of the fireside meeting] and to arrest him and any of
the believers who might be present there. However, the Hájí learned of
this plan and did not hold the planned meeting that night.

Several days later while passing through the street, the Hájí came
upon Hájí Siyyid Hasan, the preacher. The preacher spoke harshly to
him, “Why did you not greet me?” He responded, “According to Islamic
custom, a more distinguished person on a mount must first greet a lesser
person on foot.” The exchange continued for several minutes. The
preacher decided on [taking] revenge and [making] mischief and each
day, from his pulpit, he spoke contemptuously of the Abhá Cause and
the Hájí. The believers thought it best that the Hájí should secretly leave
the city.

The next day, uproar and tumult commenced. The Governor’s
men searched for the Hájí and instructed the city’s gatekeepers to seize
him. However, the Hájí, in disguise, managed to exit the city without
being molested. They seized, however, other believers: his brothers
[namely, Áqá Mashhadí ‘Alí and Áqá Muhammad-Taqí], Hájí ‘Abdu’l-
Husayn, Áqá ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd, Áqá Muhammad-Báqir, and Áqá Mírzá
Husayn, who was a son of Áqá Muhammad-Kázim ‘Abá-Báf. They were
severely beaten with sticks and smeared with a mixture of yogurt and
charcoal-dust, and in such a state they were paraded in the bazaar and
then compelled to leave the city. That night, however, they returned
home, though some were forced to migrate to other towns.

In the course of his escape, Hájí Muhammad-Ridá endured great
hardship. On foot, he fled from one mountain to the next. He has
related the following incident:

> The Zillu’s-Sultán had sent men after me in all directions,
> but they were unable to locate me. They took my brother to
> the Governor’s building where he was harshly beaten with
> sticks in an attempt to force him to divulge where I was
> hiding. However, he did not [give in]. This news reached me
> and caused tremendous sadness and sorrow. I decided to
return to the Governor’s office and surrender.

On the way, I mentioned this to a grocer as we stood
> by his shop’s entrance. Two of the Governor’s farrashes
> arrived and asked the grocer about me, but did not
> recognize me even as I was standing there. The grocer did
not betray me.

I left the shop and arrived at the Governor’s office. In
> the hall, the Farrash-Báshí was training the farrashes in how
> to locate and identity me. He was commissioning each to
> search in a different direction. I heard my brother’s screams
> from being battered by the sticks. I stood there and reflected

From Isfahan he went to Yazd and spent some time with the
Afnáns, where he recovered his health. Since it was the beginning of the
development of the town of ‘Ishqabad, some believers were migrating
and settling in that region. The Hájí entered into an agreement with the
Afnáns and proceeded in that direction [‘Ishqabad] to supervise and
collect rents on their properties.

From there [Yazd], he went to Baghdad and then to the Holy
Land, where he was in the Abhá Presence for a while. He received
instructions to return and settle in ‘Ishqabad, which he obeyed.

On the way back, he was in Istanbul for several months and then
arrived in ‘Ishqabad, where he established his residence. He lived with
Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar [Banná] Yazdí in Caravansary Hasht until Áqá Siyyid
Ahmad Afnán arrived and entrusted the management of his properties
to the Hájí.

Abiding by his old way, indeed even bolder, the Hájí continued to
teach the Abhá Cause. He would always tell the friends that in the Abhá
Presence he had implored the bounty of martyrdom. The first time he

Holy Book and two early manuscripts of this Book in the possession of the present
translator do not have this verse, which suggests that it was a later addition by
Bahá’u’lláh. It may well be that the first time that the injunction against the use of
opium was revealed was in the Tablet mentioned by Hájí Muhammad-Ridá.

had asked, [Bahá’u’lláh] had responded, “O honored Hájí, we have had
many martyrs.” But the second time he had asked, Bahá’u’lláh had
remained silent and the Hájí had understood this to be His consent. For
this, he was exceedingly happy.

Because of his pleasing manners, he was greatly esteemed by all
Russians, Armenians and Turks. However, an Iranian mullá [cleric] and
his followers had great enmity towards him.

Five days prior to Muharram [23 August 1889], he asked Áqá
Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl Gulpaygání to prepare a written will for him. In the
beginning of this will the following was recorded at the Hájí’s
instructions, “In consideration of the fact that the time for the
fulfillment of the glad-tidings of my martyrdom is nigh – and with the
utmost rapture I await that joy – I hereby record my will.”

At the beginning of the month of Muharram, he offered a venue
to the Iranian Shi‘as to observe the ta‘ziyih132 and contributed money
towards that commemoration. However, in the course of their
mourning, they plotted and schemed to murder him and other
prominent Bahá’ís. They selected and enticed two Adharbayjani thugs,
‘Alí Bábá and ‘Alí-Akbar, who would have the primary role in
committing this blood-shedding.

The day of ‘Ashurá [10 Muharram, corresponding to 6 September
1889] arrived and, without fear, the Hájí joined the procession of
mourners who were beating themselves with daggers and chains. Until
that year, this event had been observed with great emotion by Iranians in
‘Ishqabad, but after the martyrdom of Hájí Muhammad-Ridá, the
government completely banned this event, allowing the Shí‘as to only
gather in their takiyyih where they could observe the commemoration in
a manner of their choosing – and the government would always position
soldiers to keep this building under guard and to ensure that the
mourning did not spill outside.

132A form of Shi‘a pageant that is the theatrical expression of religious passion. It is
based on the Battle of Karbala and the martyrdom of Imam Husayn, and is
performed annually during the first 10 days of the month of Muharram.

That day of ‘Ashurá passed without any incident. Before noon on
the eleventh133 day, the two aforementioned men were seated in a
coffeehouse in the bazaar, armed and ready to carry out their charge.
The Hájí was carrying several bottles of quinine134 and proceeding
through the bazaar on his way home. When he reached the coffeehouse,
the men rushed out like bullets fired out of a pistol. They inflicted thirty-
two fatal injuries, to the point that his abdomen and sides were lacerated
wide open and his liver was exposed. No part of his body was without a
deep wound. Covered in blood, that wronged one fell to the ground.

The two murderers had begun to flee when ‘Alí-Bayk Qadímoff,
who was a policeman, seized them and with keen ingenuity managed to
board them on a carriage. He took them to the police-station where they
were imprisoned. Many soldiers were sent for security and to calm the
city. However, thugs and hoodlums had surrounded the remains of the
deceased, engaged in insulting and mischief-making, and utterly ignoring
the police. At this time, Mashhadí ‘Alí-Haydar Shírvání, who later was
inclined to the Cause, arrived. While the throng of onlookers had
gathered and a group of distinguished Russian ladies were crying and
sobbing over what had occurred, a physician arrived and examined the
injuries. He counted thirty-four cuts on the body. [Mashhadí ‘Alí-Haydar
Shírvání] admonished the thugs about the government’s punishment and
dispersed them from the corpse.

A white sheet was spread over the body which, for several hours,
continued to remain in the middle of the bazaar. Eventually, Siyyid
Shírází, who had a long beard and was the chief of the Shi‘as, came and
at the same time several Russian police arrived. He said “Even though
the murdered man is a Bahá’í, he is a native of our country. Help me so
we can remove him from the midst of the bazaar to a secure location.”
Therefore, several well-intentioned Muslims gathered. At the same time,
a group of ruffians surrounded the corpse to perpetrate heinous and
unseemly acts. Áqá Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím Ardabílí and Áqá Mashhadí

133  Hájí Muhammad-Ridá’s martyrdom took place on the 12 Muharram,
corresponding to 8 September 1889.
134 Ethyl carbonate of quinine.

Muhammad-Qulí Urdúbádí, who were of the believers, also learned [of
this martyrdom] and arrived.

The aforementioned Muhammad-Qulí [Urdúbádí] who was a
brave and courageous young man, lifted the bloodied and glorious
remains over his shoulder and proceeded to the shops owned by the
Afnán which also was the residence of Hájí Muhammad-Ridá. On his
way, he disregarded the insults, curses and insolence that the Shi‘a
continued to heap upon them. They closed the doors to the mischief-
makers, who had gathered in a large crowd and were throwing stones,
though they were eventually dispersed by the police.

In the middle of night, the believers washed and shrouded the
remains and placed them in a coffin. Karbalá’í Hájí Muhammad
Sabzivárí and his attendee, Hasp Khusraw-Kirví135, placed [the body] in a
carriage and conveyed it to a location three kilometers south of the city,
near Husayniyih ‘Azízu’lláh, known as Áb Barzangí, where it was buried.
All traces of burial were removed. For a while no one other than the
aforementioned Hájí [Muhammad Sabzivárí] knew of the grave’s
location. Later a tombstone was placed over the burial spot.

The next day, not satisfied with what they had wrought, the foes
became the authors of a greater mischief. Soon news was spread that
twenty-four prominent Bahá’ís were to be killed. They [the Shi‘as]
telegraphed the Shah who was on a European tour, “We have killed one
of the Bábís and enemies of the Shah.”

Frightful rumors were circulating in the city. Nonetheless, the
believers decided not to appeal to the Russian authorities, preferring to
leave the foes to God. However, the enemies attacked the shops and
trading offices of these people [Bahá’ís], and therefore, on the second
day after the Hájí’’s martyrdom, the believers were compelled to take a
complaint to the home of Kamaroff, the Governor of that region.

He greeted them with affection and stated, “During these seven
years of my residence in ‘Ishqabad, I have witnessed the refined manners
and qualities of your people [Bahá’ís]. However, they [Shí‘as] claim that
you have spoken contemptuously of the Imáms of their religion.” The
believers proved and established that they respect the Imáms even more
135   The present translator is uncertain that he has correctly read this name.

than any other [holy person] and that what had come to pass was only
through prejudice and religious enmity.

At the Governor’s behest, they then submitted their petition
signed by nineteen believers requesting protection [for the Bahá’ís] and
investigation of the incident. The Governor instructed the police chief,
Naftanoff, to place armed guards around the Bahá’í neighborhood and
shops, and to ensure that the city was enveloped in security and
protection, so that the thugs would not escape.

Four of the mischief-makers were arrested and incarcerated. The
believers were also summoned and questioned. It became known that
three prominent Iranian merchants and one of the ‘ulamá, who was a
rawdih-khán, were the instigators of this sedition and had given the
assassins money and the promise of profit on some real estate.
Consequently, those four were arrested and imprisoned.

By seeing these occurrences, the Iranians became anxious and
appealed to their leaders. Repeatedly they telegraphed and petitioned the
‘ulamá in Iran, clerics in Iraq and the Shah.

However, Kamaroff asked the Emperor [Alexander III] to appoint
a high-ranking military judge. Therefore, Khaschnewski, who was a
deeply learned, perceptive, knowledgeable, and wise man, and also the
chief of the military judiciary that in Russian is called the Suda, and who
had a high position serving as a prominent Russian military officer, was
appointed. He arrived with four other high-ranking judges. From all
directions, wave after wave of people came to ‘Ishqabad to observe the
trial, and soon the streets and roads were filled with spectators. Guards
and soldiers firmly surrounded the town and great fear overtook the city.
The Shí‘as, however, were confident of their supporters and with much
pride would encounter the believers.

On the first day after the arrival of the judges, a court was formed
where members of the court gathered, wearing special attire and carrying
out special customs. They summoned witnesses from each religion and
creed.

The Shí‘as had greatly endeavored to enlist Zhirinovskii, who was
‘Ishqabad’s official lawyer, to accept the defense of their case. They had
offered him four thousand manát, but he had rejected their request. He

went to the Bahá’ís and stated, “I will agree to represent you for free.”
He expressed his sympathies and assurances.

Similarly, the Shí‘as were confident in their situation to the point
that they even readied sheep to sacrifice when [they thought that] the
court had ruled in their favor by freeing their cleric and merchants.

In the court, their witnesses swore on the Qur’an about their
innocence and having had no role in the murder. Other witnesses stated
what they knew or had seen. The Bahá’í witnesses, who were Áqá Mírzá
‘Abdu’l-Karím Ardabílí and Áqá Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl Gulpaygání, stated,
“The Bahá’í Faith does not have a practice for swearing in [witnesses],
and insists that one speaks and testifies naught but the truth.”

When the witnesses had completed their testimonies, the public
prosecutor rose and spoke in Russian for about three hours, proving the
treachery and crime of the eight accused. The attorney for the Shí‘as
then spoke at length in their defense, but it bore no fruit.

Thereupon, the chief judge and the other four judges retired for
consultation and returned after an hour and a half with their decision.
They read to the court their verdict as such:

> ‘Alí-Akbar and ‘Alí-Bábá are to be hung. Mullá Ahmad Tájir
> Yazdí, Mashhadí Jalíl Khú’í, Mashhadí Samad Adharbayjání
> and Mullá Mihdí Tabrízí, the preacher and rawdih-khán who
> on the pulpit had cursed and insulted [the Bahá’ís] and
> issued a fatwa for their deaths, are to be banished for life to
> Siberia with hard labor and incarceration. Asadu’lláh and
> Nasru’lláh are to be banished to a nearby town for two and
> a half years [imprisonment].

The convicts were handed over to the attorney for the Bahá’ís.

The criminals and convicts were charged a total of twenty-thousand
manáts for expenses associated with the trial. The order was given that
after three days, the ruling of the court should be carried out. During
those three days, cannons were trained on the city of ‘Ishqabad, and
soldats, foot soldiers and cavalry filled all the roads and neighborhoods of
the city.

This news reached the Shí‘as in other regions. They rose to action
in every manner they could. In Mashhad, for three days the bazaar and
all the shops were closed and they telegraphed the Russian Consulate in
Tehran. The Shah also lent his support, but all to no avail. The [Muslim]
Persians in ‘Ishqabad found themselves utterly incapable to change the
course [of the decision]. Eventually they came to the Bahá’ís pleading
and imploring, expressing remorse and regret, begging forgiveness for
their misdeeds and beseeching aid and assistance. The friends accepted
[their plea] and went before the Governor to intercede [on behalf of the
prisoners].

He telegraphed the Emperor, and he in turn referred the matter to
the Senate, which decided that it was best to accept the intercession of
the Bahá’ís.

On the third day [after the trial], gallows were constructed. The
two murderers were brought out and compelled to dig their own graves
beneath the gallows while several thousand spectators, both mounted
and on foot, gathered for the hanging. The murderers were made to
stand on a stool, and mullás were readied to hear their confession of
faith.136

The public prosecutor read the Emperor’s order, which
proclaimed that the intercession of the Bahá’ís had been accepted and
that the decreed punishments had been reduced: those convicted of
murder were banished for life to Siberia, and the punishment of those
originally sentenced to life-imprisonment was halved.

They immediately brought leather uniforms and the seven men put
them on and, under guard, they were conveyed away. When they arrived
in Badkubih, the Iranians pleaded and implored their Consulate and gave
ten thousands manát for their release, but it was of no use. We wrote of
the details of this incident in the previous volume under the entry for
1307 AH [1889] based on the account of Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar Mi‘már Yazdí
(the martyr).137

136In Islam, the last rites include a standard formula for the confession of faith.
137As noted in Document 10, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 5, cites a section of the
narrative of Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar Banná, which is rendered as Document 10.

Regarding the remains of the martyred Hájí: as was mentioned
above, he was buried outside the city in the middle of the first night by
Karbalá’í Hájí Muhammad Sabzivárí, Hasp Khusraw-Karví and several
Russian soldiers. For some time, no one other than Karbalá’í Hájí
Muhammad knew of the grave’s location. After a while, in accordance
with the Abhá’s [Bahá’u’lláh’s] instruction, a burial tomb was raised and
protected by strong stones.

Not long thereafter, the opponents removed the stones and broke
into the tomb. When they were about to remove the corpse, several
Turkmen arrived which caused them to flee. The Turkmen reported the
incident to the believers. Consequently, Karbalá’í Hájí Muhammad,
Ustád ‘Alí-Asghar Yazdí, Áqá Ghulám-Husayn Isfahání, Hájí
Muhammad-Husayn Isfahání, Hájí Abú-Tálib Hamadání, Áqá Ridá
Yazdí, and several other [Bahá’ís] went and excavated the coffin. They
dug a new grave three meters deep, and with stones made a wall
completely surrounding the chamber, and then placed the coffin within
that chamber. Then they covered the coffin with a copious quantity of
rocks and limestone, filling [the grave] to the brim. Moreover, they
mounted a considerable number of granite stones over the grave to
ensure that it was completely fortified and that the foes could no longer
break into the tomb.

The blood-soaked clothing of the martyr [Hájí Muhammad-Ridá]
was removed at the time of the washing and shrouding of the remains
and was preserved by some of the Bahá’ís residing in the city of
‘Ishqabad as a precious memento and a source of blessing, and remains
protected to the present time.

A great many Tablets were revealed in his honor. A brother and a
daughter survived him after the martyrdom.

Recollections of ‘Ishqabad

[In 1882, Hájí Muhammad-Kázim Isfahání and his son, Áqá Muhammad-Ridá
Arbáb, were the first Bahá’ís to settle in ‘Ishqabad. Some time later, Arbáb formed a
family and his son, Kazem Kazemzadeh, went on to become a successful lawyer (often
taking on the defense of Bahá’ís of Iran, such as, serving as one of the Bahá’í lawyers

Mr. Kazemzadeh shared his recollections with Los Angeles Study Class, and a

Bahá’í community. Translator.]

The area of ‘Ishqabad was seized from Persia by Russia in 1881.

Before the Russian conquest, ‘Ishqabad was little more than a tent city of
some 500 dwellers on a windy plain. Czarist authorities decided to make
it the administrative center of Turkistan (now known as the Turkmen
Soviet Socialist Republic). They pushed through a railroad and ‘Ishqabad
138This summary was later augmented with two sets of editorial corrections, which
have been incorporated into the text. Also, transliterations have been brought in
conformity with the present monograph.

became an important administrative center in Southern Russia. Almost
overnight, ‘Ishqabad, a dusty, sleepy backwater, was transformed into a
boom town. Around 1884, a relative of the Báb named Siyyid Muhsin
Afnán139, a relative of the Báb, visited ‘Ishqabad and recognized its
potential. Not far from Iran’s northern frontier, it seemed an ideal place
for a Bahá’í community. Siyyid Muhsin traveled to ‘Akká and conferred
with Bahá’u’lláh about the possibility of sending Bahá’í pioneers to
‘Ishqabad. Bahá’u’lláh agreed and wrote a Tablet to Persia, urging Bahá’ís
to emigrate to ‘Ishqabad.140 About 200-300 believers, from all parts of
Persia, did so. It was not hard to recruit volunteers. Iran was in the
throes of one of its periodic persecutions of Bahá’ís. Bahá’ís began
moving to ‘Ishqabad, buying land, and beginning new lives as merchants
and tradesmen. As Mr. Kazemzadeh, who was born in ‘Ishqabad, put it
“in comparison to Persia, it was paradise.” By 1890, there were about
1000 Bahá’ís living in the ‘Ishqabad area.

They were not the only emigrants to this new land. Other Persians
– Muslims – also moved into ‘Ishqabad, often bringing their fanatical
hatred of the Bahá’ís along with their baggage. In September, 1889,
[Hájí] Muhammad-Ridá was murdered in the town’s bazaar in broad
daylight by two hired assassins. The czarist government moved quickly.
About a dozen Muslims were arrested as participants or accomplices to
the crime. The Czarist government sent in a military commission from
St. Petersburg (now Leningrad) to conduct the trial.

The trial itself had some curious aspects. The Muslims arrested
readily admitted having killed Muhammad-Ridá. They claimed he had
insulted the Imams, which provoked the wrath of the deeply religious
Islamic community.141 But underlying their statements was a confidence

139 Original 6 March notes incorrectly gave the name as Muhammad-Ridá, but this
was corrected in 11 April 1977 Los Angeles Study notes.
140 Los Angeles Study notes of 11 April 1977 offers the correction that it was Siyyid

Muhsin Afnán, and not Bahá’u’lláh, who wrote to Iran urging migration to
‘Ishqabad, although the writing of this communication was approved by Bahá’u’lláh.
141 In 19 March 1977 Los Angeles Study notes, further amplification has been

offered: “During the course of the trial, the Muslims accused of the murder justified
their actions on the grounds that [Hájí] Muhammad-Ridá was a Bahá’í and had
insulted the Imams, testifying on the assumption that they would not be convicted

borne of experience. In Persia, one could kill Bahá’ís with virtual
impunity and not fear punishment. Indeed, the Muslims were so certain
of acquittal that they began laying plans for a general massacre of the
Bahá’ís once the legal formalities were over. Meanwhile, the Bahá’ís
feared that, once again, they would be the victims of a religious pogrom.

This time would be different. The judge in the trial ordered his
courtroom segregated to separate the Bahá’ís from the Muslims. That
constituted the first official recognition that the Bahá’í Faith was not an
Islamic sect. As the prosecutor presented his case, he asked each of the
defendants if they had murdered or conspired to kill Muhammad-Ridá.
They all testified openly that they did. Summarizing his case to the court,
the prosecutor urged that the two assassins be hanged and the others
involved banished to Siberia for various prison terms. The Muslims were
stunned. The judge agreed to that sentence and ordered it carried out.

Upon learning of the verdict and sentence, the Persian and
Turkish governments attempted to intervene on behalf of the Muslim
defendants, but the czarist government rejected their pleas. Swallowing
their pride, leaders of the Muslim community approached the Bahá’ís
and asked them to intercede and seek lesser sentences. The Bahá’ís
agreed and asked the Russian governor of ‘Ishqabad to reduce the
punishment. The governor passed the request along to his superiors in
Tashkent. On the day the two assassins were to die on the gallows
erected in front of the local high school, government authorities
announced that, because of the intercession of the Bahá’ís, the two
murderers would not be hung. Instead they, along with the other
Muslims involved in Muhammad-Ridá’s slaying were banished to Siberia.

The trial and its result established for the first time ever that the
Bahá’ís had a right to exist free from persecution of the Muslims. By
successfully persuading the authorities to reduce the punishments for the
Muslims, the Bahá’í community gained an enormous amount of prestige.

The end of the trial signaled the beginning of the flowering of the
Bahá’í community in ‘Ishqabad. Developing land they had purchased
earlier, the Bahá’ís began to build elementary schools, one for boys and

of killing an infidel. There was never any doubt about who committed the act; the
only question at issue was the criminality of it.”

one for girls, as was the custom in those days, a Bahá’í library, a hostel
for visitors, an auditorium, and, in 1902 they undertook the construction
of the first Bahá’í House of Worship in the world. As evidence of the
growing prestige of the Faith, the Czar sent General Krupatkin142, the
governor-general of Turkistan, to represent the House of Romanov at
the laying of the foundation stone. Under ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s instructions, a
Bahá’í named Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Taqí, a cousin of the Báb, was
directed to personally oversee the erection of the Mashriqu’l-Adhkar.
Muhammad-Taqí dedicated his entire fortune to the project. The Bahá’ís
also established their own cemetery in ‘Ishqabad.143

At this same time, they created their own journal, called “Sun of
the East” and written in Persian. The Local Assembly had between 12
and 16 members who were elected for terms of about 5 years. Things
were going so well that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had to warn the ‘Ishqabad believers
not to make too much progress too swiftly lest it provoke problems for
the Bahá’ís in Persia. Meanwhile, construction of the House of Worship
progressed slowly. It was expensive and funding was always a problem as
was buying all the necessary building materials. In the end, it required
about 19 years to complete the work; the Temple was not completed
until 1922.

Although it was not immediately apparent, the bubble burst with
the Russian Revolution of 1917. At first it seemed as if the Bolshevik
takeover might work to the advantage of the Bahá’ís. Though the czarist
government had been tolerant of Bahá’í activities, it was cruel and
despotic. The Bolsheviks promised an end to the erratic tyranny of the
czarist regime. And it seemed as if even greater freedoms were within
reach. Up until the revolution, the Baha’is were forbidden [under the

142 Los Angeles Study notes of 19 March 1977 suggest that an alternative spelling is
Kuropotkin.
143 Los Angeles Study notes of 11 April 1977 adds: “Volkov, the Russian architect

of the House of Worship in ‘Ishqabad, (also spelled Volkoff), was given a Bahá’í
funeral when he died. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sent a Tablet praising the architect and saying
that by building a great edifice for Bahá’í on earth, he had constructed himself a
palace in heaven.”

law] to teach among the native Russian population.144 They could, and
did, convert Muslims, and import members of their own Faith. It was
illegal, under czarist law, for anyone born into an Eastern Orthodox
family, to convert to any non-Christian religion. After the first
Revolution broke out in February, 1917, the czarist rules vanished, and
Bahá’ís began teaching among Russians, Armenian and Caucasian
peoples. The Bolsheviks tolerated this and did not interfere. ‘Ishqabad
was thousands of miles away from the center of the revolution in
northern Russia.

When the fighting ended in victory for the Bolsheviks, the Bahá’ís
sent a delegation of believers to Moscow, the site chosen as the new
capitol of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The Bahá’ís assured
the members of the new government they could be trusted: loyalty to
government was a cardinal Bahá’í principal, they explained. The
Bolsheviks, busy consolidating their powers, listened and made no
objections. During the four year period from 1918 to 1922, Bahá’ís held
open public meetings with as many as 400 people in attendance to
proclaim the Faith. Local Assemblies flourished as far north as Moscow
and Leningrad. The Bolsheviks, knowing that Bahá’ís were routinely
persecuted in Persia, hoped to use the Faith as the cutting edge for their
revolutionary ideals, spreading these to India. Things began to go sour
when the Bahá’ís refused to allow themselves to be exploited as carriers
of Bolshevik ideology.

As the relations between the still-growing Bahá’í community in
Russia and the newly installed Communist started cooling, the Bahá’ís
sent a new delegation to Moscow. Mr. Kazemzadeh was a member of
that party. In a meeting with a government official, the Communist
bureaucrat candidly told the Bahá’ís he was not at all worried about
supplanting the influence of the Christians and Muslims in Russia. And
then he added, “Frankly, you are more dangerous than the others.”

144Los Angeles Study notes of 19 March 1977 provides the following explanation:
“Before its conquest in the 1880s, ‘Ishqabad was a Persian village. When the
Russians took over, many Russians and others moved in and built a large city. So,
technically, there was no native Russian population in the city of ‘Ishqabad.

In 1922, the official gazette of the new communist government
published an article in which it accused the Bahá’ís of turning the
thoughts of the Russian youth away from Bolshevik ideals and toward
their own religion. The Bahá’í efforts would have to be stopped, the
article stated. Bahá’í meetings in Moscow and Leningrad were broken up
by the police and believers arrested. In ‘Ishqabad, the recently finished
House of Worship was seized as state property and the Bahá’ís were
forced to sign a contract to rent it for their own use. The Bahá’í
community of ‘Ishqabad, now numbering about 2,000 strong, began to
feel the full weight of government repression.

During 1927 and 1928, the Russian Bahá’ís in Moscow were
arrested and imprisoned. There followed sporadic incidents of more
arrests, banishments to Siberia (reviving a czarist practice) and, in the
case of some Persian Bahá’ís exile back to their native land.

In 1933, the Bahá’ís of ‘Ishqabad were forced to sign a new, five-
year lease of the House of Worship. They were allowed to meet there
but, public teaching of the Faith was forbidden. Publication of “Sun of
the East” was barred and the printing press which produced it was
seized by police authorities.

In 1937, with the onset of the Stalinist purges, things grew much
worse. Thousands of Russians were rounded up and shipped off to
forced labor camps in the polar regions of Siberia. In ‘Ishqabad, 280
Bahá’ís were arrested and most were put on trains heading for Siberia.
The lucky ones were expelled back to Persia. A handful of Bahá’ís,
accused of being spies for England (a favorite denunciatory tactic during
Stalinist times) were executed.

Josef Stalin died in 1953, after a massive stroke. And although the
systematic oppression eased, the Bahá’í community of ‘Ishqabad was
broken. In 1938, the House of Worship was taken over by Soviet
authorities, who converted it into an art gallery. Ten years later it was
severely damaged in an earthquake and had to be demolished as a
structural hazard. A few Bahá’ís, released from concentration camps in
Siberia, trickled back to ‘Ishqabad. And, although the Communist
authorities allowed them to have meetings, public teaching remained
banned, nor was it permitted to re-form the Local Assembly.

Today, there still exists the remnant of a Bahá’í community in
Ishqabad, but it is cut off from contact with the Bahá’í world at large.
Under Soviet rule, the Bahá’ís were never persecuted as subversive to the
state, but were oppressed for the reason that they presented too strong
and too valid a competition for the atheistic ideals of the Communist
cause.

The history of the Bahá’í Faith in Russia has been strangely neglected by
the Bahá’ís of the West. While many accounts of Bahá’í history in Írán or
under Ottoman rule, in Europe and or America are available in English,
references to the history of the once large and prosperous Russian Bahá’í
community are few and scattered. Yet, some of the most signal events in
Bahá’í history took place in Southern Russia. It was here that the first
official recognition was extended to the Bahá’í Faith by any government.
It was here that the first Mashriqu’l-Adhkár was raised at the command
of Bahá’u’lláh Himself. It was here that, at one time, perhaps five percent
of the Bahá’ís of the world found refuge and developed the most
complete Bahá’í community which has ever existed.

This paper draws upon the few published materials available in
English and some Persian sources.145 However, it relies most heavily on
oral interviews conducted with Bahá’ís who lived in Russia. The paper
sketches the history of the Bahá’í Faith in ‘Ishqábád in Russian Turkistan
from the establishment of the Bahá’í community there until the Russian
Revolution.

The history of the Bahá’í Faith in ‘Ishqábád falls actually into four
major periods. The first extends from the arrival of the first Bahá’ís in
that city to the recognition of the Faith by the Russian government and
the social separation of the Bahá’í community from the Muslim
community. The second period begins at this point and lasts until the
Russian revolution. It witnessed the development of a strong,
independent, prosperous and closely-knit religious community which
became a major force in the city. The third period, from the revolution
to the eruption of the sever persecution against the Faith, can be
regarded as the “Golden Age” of the Bahá’ís of ‘Ishqábád. And the final
period saw the disruption of Bahá’í life, the arrest and deportation of
hundreds of believers, the flight of many more, and the reduction of the
Bahá’í community to a mere remnant. This paper limits itself to a sketch
of the first two of these periods.

The Establishment of the Russian Bahá’í Community
The Russian Bahá’í community was established during the lifetime of
Bahá’u’lláh. A large Bahá’í community emerged in ‘Ishqábád during this
time and a handful of believers established themselves in Samarqand and
Bukhárá as a result of the efforts and activities of “the erudite Fádil-i-
Qá’iní and the learned apologist Mírzá Abu’l-Fadl”.146 ‘Ishqábád was,
however, the first city in Russia to be opened to the Faith and it became
an important center of Bahá’í activities almost immediately.

In the early 1880’s, Russian administration was established in an
area of Turkistán which had previously been a part of the Persian
empire. ‘Ishqábád became the centre of Russian administration for the
area. The city lies on a plain just a few miles from the Elburz Mountains
which form a border between Russian and Persia. Tradition has it that
before the Russians established their control, ‘Ishqábád was a village of
about “500 tent dwellers”.147 However, the Russians began the
construction of a new city there, built on a European design, with long,
broad streets laid out on a grid plan. The new city attracted many
immigrants from Russia and from Írán. It lay on the path of the
Transcaspian Railway, which the Russians later constructed, and so
became a center of trade, as well as an important administrative centre.

The first Bahá’ís to settle in Ishqábád were refugees from the town
of Sabzivár in Khurásán.148 These Bahá’ís had earlier fled to Sabzivár
from as far away as Yazd and Isfáhán, to escape from persecutions in
these areas. Some of them were merchants. These men were generally
known as Bahá’ís and so had enemies in the town among the Muslims.

In about 1884 or 1885, persecutions broke out against the Bahá’ís
of Sabzivár. The homes of some of the Bahá’ís were viciously attacked
and looted. Three or four Bahá’í men were arrested, taken before the
local Muslim clergy, pronounced as apostates to Islám, and sentenced to
death. The Bahá’ís of Sabizvár appealed to the capital of the province,
Mashhad, and asked the governor for assistance. An order came that
those arrested were to be transported to Mashhad and imprisoned there.
Some enemies of the faith made plans to murder the prisoners in
Mashhad. But after lengthy negotiations, some Bahá’ís of the city were
able to satisfy the governor and secure the release of their Bahá’í
brothers.149

These Bahá’ís were now unable to return to Sabizivár and they
could not remain in Mashhad. They fled to nearby ‘Ishqábád. Their

families joined them in Russia sometime later. Among the first Bahá’ís to
reach ‘Ishqábád were ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl of Yazd150 and Aqá Muhammad-
Ridá-i-Arbáb-i-Isfáhání.151

Even before the first Bahá’ís came to live in ‘Ishqábád, Bahá’ís had
become involved in the life of the city. Hájí Mírzá Hasan, the Great
Afnán, passed through ‘Ishqábád in 1881 or 1882 on his way to the
presence of Bahá’u’lláh in ‘Akká. While in Russia, he decided to buy
property in ‘Ishqábád. Later, he wrote to his son, Siyyid Ahmad, who
was in Sabzivár and asked for him to arrange for the purchase of some
properties there. Mírzá Hasan realized, no doubt, that the new Russian
city offered excellent opportunities for investment. Soon other Bahá’ís
had followed his lead and invested in property there.152

The migration of large numbers of Bahá’ís to ‘Ishqábád, however,
was the result of the efforts of Siyyid Muhsin-i-Afnán. In about 1884,
this Afnán also traveled through Russia from Írán on his way to ‘Akká
where he made a pilgrimage to the presence of Bahá’u’lláh. He may have
actually passed through ‘Ishqábád on his journey. But, in any case, while
in Russia he learned of the opportunities offered by the new city which
was being constructed. He brought this news to ‘Akká.153

While on pilgrimage, Siyyid Muhsin suggested to Bahá’u’lláh that
Bahá’ís might immigrate to this city and stressed the new, strong Russian
authority there which could offer safety and protection to the friends,
the availability of work, the abundance of land, etc. Since this was a
period of severe persecution for Bahá’ís of Írán, the response to Siyyid
Muhsin’s suggestion was almost immediate. Within a short time, four or
five hundred Bahá’ís had settled in ‘Ishqábád from different parts of
Írán, but especially from Yazd and from Khurásán. By 1890, the number
of Bahá’ís had reached about 1,000.154

During these very early days of the Bahá’í Faith in ‘Ishqábád,
Shoghi Effendi writes in God Passes By that the community was able to
“… establish a Bahá’í cemetery and to purchase property and erect
thereon structures that were to prove the precursors of the first
Mashriqu’l-Adhkár of the Bahá’í world.”155 It was Hájí Mírzá
Muhammad-Taqíy-i-Afnán, the Vakílu’d-Dawlih (known also as Afnán-i-
A‘zam), who arranged for the purchase of a great deal of land in the city.
He informed Bahá’u’lláh of this fact and was instructed to use a part of
this land for the site of a Mashriqu’l-Adhkár.156

The land itself had a curious background. It belonged to an
Armenian by the name of A‘zam. This was an unusual name for a
Christian since A‘zam is an Arabic word meaning “Most Great” and
would usually be thought of as a Muslim name. In any case, the land was
well known among the people as “A‘zam’s Land”. These were the
properties which were to become the site of the first Bahá’í House of
Worship.157 The Bahá’ís continued to refer to the area as “Zamín-i-
A‘zam” (The Most Great Land) after its purchase.158

Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Taqí constructed a meeting hall and a
travelers’ hostel on this land at first. The meeting hall was regarded as a
Mashriqu’l-Adhkár by the early Bahá’ís of ‘Ishqábád since, at the time,
any place of prayer for Bahá’ís was called by this name.159 Here the
believers were able to hold meetings and practice their Faith with some
degree of freedom.

Bahá’ís were able to establish themselves easily in ‘Ishqábád with
money and skills which they brought with them from Írán. Naturally, a
great deal of construction was in progress in the new city. Since many of
the Bahá’ís were masons and construction workers, especially the Yazdís,
they could easily find work. Moreover, land was cheap and Bahá’ís were

158 Or, A‘zam’s land. Since Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Taqí was called Afnán-i-A‘zam,

159 Kazemzadeh, Interview April 4, 1977. [Lee]

able to purchase it and build their own homes.160 They also found it easy
to become successful in trade and became importers – principally of
Chinese green tea.161

Bahá’ís were not the only Persians attracted to ‘Ishqábád. The
development of the new city drew large numbers of other people from
Írán who left their country for a variety of reasons. Among them were a
number of lutís (hirelings or ruffians) who were forced to flee Írán for
political reasons and who attached themselves to the Shí‘ih clergy in the
city. Not surprising, many of the Persian Muslims carried their prejudice
and animosity against Bahá’ís with them to Russia and resented the rising
influence of the Bahá’í community.

‘Ishqábád was no haven of tolerance and freedom for Bahá’ís at
this time. Bahá’ís were still under a great deal of pressure and were
obliged to be cautious about revealing their religious identity. One
Bahá’í, Mullá ‘Alí, arrived in ‘Ishqábád in about 1888. He had come from
Mashhad in hopes of escaping the prejudice and persecution against
Bahá’ís which existed there. He recalled later that after his arrival he
regretted his move to ‘Ishqábád since he found that conditions were little
different there from what they had been in Mashhad.162

However, there were no violent incidents in the city and the
government was not hostile. Bahá’ís and Muslims lived together in the
city with little social distinction between them. Bahá’ís went about their
daily lives in a Muslim context.

It is interesting to note how rapidly ‘Ishqábád developed into an
important Bahá’í center. The combination of relative freedom and
economic opportunity attracted large numbers of believers. In July of
1889, Mírzá Abu’l-Fadl, one of the foremost Bahá’í scholars, came to the
city and assumed a position of leadership in the community. Other
Bahá’í scholars also appear to have come to ‘Ishqábád in its early days,163
and the city may have developed into a kind of intellectual centre for the

Faith. Abu’l-Fadl wanted to begin the publication of a Bahá’í magazine
there as early as 1890, but was unable to raise the necessary funds from
among the believers.

The Martyrdom of Muhammad-Ridá
It was not long before the large number, and rising prestige and
prosperity of the Bahá’ís in ‘Ishqábád attracted the notice of some
leaders of the Shí‘ih community, and their prejudice and envy caught
flame. Their plottings eventually led to the martyrdom of a prominent
believer, the official recognition of the Bahá’í community, and the
complete separation of Bahá’ís from the social life of their Muslim
countrymen in the city.

It was Hájí Muhammad-Ridáy-i-Ishfáhání who fell victim to the
hatred of the enemies of the Faith. He was a powerful and well-known
person in ‘Ishqábád since he acted as the agent and manager of Siyyid
Ahmad-i-Afnán, whose father, the Great Afnán, had placed him in
charge of his extensive properties in the city. Hájí Muhammad-Ridá was,
therefore, an important Bahá’í and was known among Muslims as the
“Imám Ridá of the Bábís”.164

Muhammad-Ridá was always very bold about identifying himself
as a Bahá’í in ‘Ishqábád. He was not careful about his speech and refused
to dissemble his beliefs. Before coming to ‘Ishqábád he had gone on
pilgrimage and attained the presence of Bahá’u’lláh in the Holy Land.
There he had begged to be allowed to become a martyr for the Faith. At
first, Bahá’u’lláh refused. Then Muhammad-Ridá related to friends that
he took this silence as a sign of acceptance and was quite happy.165

During his pilgrimage he also asked where he should go and
Bahá’u’lláh suggested that he proceed to ‘Ishqábád. He went there and
was later appointed by Siyyid Ahmad as his representative.166

Muhammad-Ridá’s murder was the result of the conspiracy of five
Shí‘ih Muslims: Mashhadí Jalíl-i-Tabrízí, Mashhadí Samad-i-Tabrízí,
165 Banná, Táríkh-i-‘Ishqábád. [Lee]
Mullá Ahmad Tájir-i-Yazdí, Mihdí Tájir-i-Káshání, and Mullá Mihdí
Rodih [Rawdih] Khán-i-Tabrízí. It seems that they began their plottings a
full year before the murder actually took place.167 Apparently they
intended to initiate a general persecution of Bahá’ís of ‘Ishqáb’ad. Their
precise motives are unclear, but their religious fanaticism may have been
reinforced by the anticipation of economic advantage. They were
certainly encouraged by the new wave of Bahá’í persecution which was
sweeping Írán.168

About seventy days before the martyrdom, six Tablets, addressed
to various believers in ‘Ishqábád, arrived from Bahá’u’lláh. Their themes
were all similar and they puzzled the friends very much. The Tablets all
enjoined patience on the believers and called them to resignation to the
Will of God.169

Muhammad-Ridá received one of these Tablets. In it, Bahá’u’lláh
alludes to the martyrdom of one of the believers. He praises God that
Muhammad-Ridá has been appointed as a servant of the Cause and
testifies that the affairs of the world will not keep him from the Cause.
He declares that God will recompense all deeds done on earth.
Bahá’u’lláh then states that some incident has occurred in ‘Ishqábád and
asks God to give His servant patience. He asks the blessings of God on
Muhammad-Ridá.170

Muhammad-Ridá openly asserted to his companions that the
Tablets must refer to his own martyrdom. He insists that Mírzá Abu’l-
Fadl, who had recently arrived in ‘Ishqábád in the company of Siyyid
Ahmad, should prepare his will and testament. He emphasized to Abu’l-
Fadl that time was short and there could be no delay in writing the
document.171

On the twelfth day of Muharram (the Muslim month of mourning
for the imams), in September 1889, at about 9:00 a.m.,172 the five
168 cf. Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, pp. 197-203. [Lee]
169 Banná, Táríkh-i-‘Ishqábád. [Lee]
conspirators “instigated two ruffians to assault the seventy-year old Hájí
Muhammad-Ridáy-i-Isfáhání, whom, in broad day in the midst of the
bazaar, they stabbed in no less than thirty-two places, exposing his liver,
lacerating his stomach and tearing open his breast.”173

The murder took place in the bazaar just outside of a tea-house
which stood opposite to some shops which Muhammad-Ridá managed
for the Afnán. A crowd of about 500 Muslims witnessed the deed and
clamoured their approval. The two lutí murderers, Husayn-i-Tabrízí and
‘Alí-Akbar-i-Tabrízí (known as ‘Alí Bábá), were immediately arrested, but
a great disturbance was raised in the city. Muhammad-Ridá’s body lay
exposed in the bazaar until late afternoon since no one dared approach it
in the midst of disorder. Finally, two Bahá’ís enlisted the aid of a
prominent Muslim friend, and braved a stone-throwing mob to carry the
body to the safety of one of the caravanserais of Siyyid Ahmad where
Muhammad-Ridá had lived. The burial was arranged with great secrecy
under cover of night.174

The next day, disturbances in the city continued. The Shí‘ihs told
the Russian authorities that Muhammad-Ridá had publicly cursed the
holy imams and that his assassins were deeply religious men who could
abide his insults no longer.175 They had willingly surrendered to the
authorities for their crime. It was claimed that this was purely a religious
matter, of no concern to Christians, and that, further, since all those
involved were Persian citizens, the Russian government should not
become involved.176

The Bahá’í community was in grave danger. Bands of lutís roamed
the bazaar, bent on the murder of other prominent Bahá’ís. Though they
were hesitant about approaching the authorities, on the evening of the
day after the murder, a group of Bahá’í men led by Mírzá Abu’l-Fadl and
Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím-i-Tájir-i-Ardíbílí went to the home of the governor

173 Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p. 212. [Lee]
175 Balyuzi, H.M., ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: The Centre of the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh, (Oxford:

George Ronald, 1971), p. 109. [Lee]
to ask for protection.177 Abu’l-Fadl presented the case for the Bahá’ís.
He argued successfully that the charges made against the martyred
Muhammad-Ridá were false, that Bahá’ís were law-abiding people, that
they believed in all of the prophets of God and wished to live in
harmony with the followers of all religions. He pointed out that Bahá’ís
also believed in and revered the Shí‘ih imams and so would not speak
disparagingly of them.178

The governor, General Komaroff, was convinced. He gave orders
to put down the disturbances in the city and offered government
protection to the Bahá’ís. The next day, three more people were arrested
for the murder and the disorders were ended. Investigations were
conducted and more people were arrested. Eventually, nine persons were
brought to trail, including four of the prominent conspirators.179

The arrest of so many prominent Shí‘ihs struck fear into the hearts
of the enemies of the Bahá’í Faith in ‘Ishqábád. All those who had any
role in the conspiracy to kill Muhammad-Ridá fled to Írán. Even some
people who had only spoken in favour of the murder were afraid that
they would be arrested and left the country. Some sixty or seventy
Muslims in all felt it wise to return to Írán. From Tihrán, Tabríz and
Mashhad, these persons made representations to the ‘ulamá in an effort
to influence the trail in ‘Ishqábád. The fact that so many chose to flee
when it became clear that the conspirators would be brought to justice
gives some idea of the scope of the anti-Bahá’í plotting which had taken
place.

General Komaroff was well disposed toward the Bahá’ís after the
initial meeting with Mírzá Abu’l-Fadl. He reported the incident to the
Tsar and a military commission was sent from St. Petersburg to conduct
the trail of the conspirators. This was considered a sign of favour to the
Bahá’ís since it ensured a speedy court-martial and thus meant that the
possibility of Muslims influencing the trial through bribes and other
means was minimized. No less than 150 persons in ‘Ishqábád received

subpoenas to testify before the commission. The whole city was agitated
by the case. It was the main topic of conversation everywhere.180

The trial began on November 6, 1890 [1889], and was completed
on November 9 of that year. Translations into Turkish and Persian were
provided since these were the principal languages of those involved. The
proceedings generally started in the morning and continued late into the
night on each day of the trial.181

The judge who conducted the trial required that the various
religious communities sit in separate places in the courtroom. The Bahá’í
Faith was afforded full recognition as an independent religion and the
Bahá’ís were seated apart from the Muslims who were present. This was
the first formal recognition extended by any government to the Bahá’í community. It
was also a day of separation between Bahá’ís and Muslims. As the
believers took their seats in a special section of the room, many Muslims
were amazed to discover that their friends were not seated with them,
but among the Bahá’ís. From this point forward, the Bahá’ís of
‘Ishqábád lived as a distinct social community.182

An interesting problem arose at the start of the trial. The
ecclesiastical leaders of each religious community were called upon to
place their followers under oath. Each religion had established customs
to accomplish this. The turn of the Bahá’ís came, and they were asked to
present their mujtahid (clergyman) to swear in the believers. Mírzá Abu’l-
Fadl spoke on behalf of the Bahá’ís and explained that the Bahá’í Faith
had no established method of placing believers under oath, for such a
thing was not covered in the Kitab-i-Aqdas. He offered to follow any
procedure which the judges might require. It was finally agreed that the
Bahá’ís would make a covenant with the court to respect its authority
and to speak the truth.183

On the last day of the trial, the crowds that packed the courtroom
became so great that the judges ordered all spectators out. Large
numbers of people waited outside, while the prosecution and defense

182 Kazemzadeh, Interview March 6, 1977. [Lee]

made their final arguments. The judges then retired and deliberated for
two hours.184

During this time, rumors circulated among the Muslim crowds
that the accused would all be found innocent and set free.185 This was a
cause of great rejoicing. A samovar was prepared and three sheep were
brought for sacrifice and feasting after the victory. Some people began to
openly curse the Bahá’ís in the streets. The believers observed these
events and were very much afraid. They knew that an acquittal would
open the door to a general massacre.186

Suddenly, the Bahá’ís outside could see that the samovar was
removed and the sheep led away. The verdict had been delivered. The
two ruffians who had carried out the murder of Muhammad-Ridá were
sentenced to death. Four others involved in the plot were exiled to
Siberia – one of these for life and the rest for fifteen years. One
defendant was found guilty of a lesser charge and was to serve sixteen
months in prison and then be deported to Írán. Two of the accused were
found to be innocent.187

The Bahá’ís of the city were astonished to learn of the verdicts.

Many would not believe the news until they heard the story from the

185  Mr. Kazemzadeh related the story (Interview March 6, 1977), which he heard
from his father, of how these rumors developed. Apparently, the prosecutor, during
his remarks on the last day of trial, turned to one of the defendants and asked,
“Why did you kill Muhammad-Ridá?” The defendant answered, “He was a Bábí,
and so we killed him.” He apparently did not realize the seriousness of this
statement since he was only familiar with conditions in Írán, where Bahá’ís could be
killed with impunity. The prosecutor said nothing and sat down.

The Muslims were delighted by the prosecutor’s reaction. Since he did not
protest the answer given, they believed that he was satisfied with it and had no
objection. Someone went out to inform the Muslims gathered outside of the good
news.

The prosecutor asked the same question of all the defendants and received
the same answer. He still made no objection. So, the Muslims were certain that the
accused would be set free. But later the prosecutor was able to ask for conviction on
the basis of the defendants’ own testimony. [Lee]
186 Kazemzadeh, Interview March 6, 1977. Mihrabkhání, Sharh-i-Ahval. [Lee]

Muslims themselves. They could not believe that the government had
provided them with the full protection of the law.188 It was the first time
in the history of the Faith that anyone had ever been brought to justice
for persecuting Bahá’ís.

When the Muslims realized that all of their efforts to influence the
outcome of the trial had failed, they went to the Bahá’ís themselves for
help. A delegation presented itself to Áqá Muhammad-Ridá-i-Arbáb-i-
Isfáhání and asked that the Bahá’ís approach the authorities with a plea
for clemency so that the harsh sentences might be reduced. The Bahá’ís
agreed to do this. The same group of Bahá’ís who had first gone to the
governor’s house to ask for protection now returned to ask for leniency
for their persecutors.189

General Komaroff [Kamaroff] was surprised and impressed by
this display of magnanimity on the part of the Bahá’í community.
However, he would not be swayed and would promise the Bahá’ís
nothing. He pointed out that the Muslims had planned a general
massacre of Bahá’ís in the city and that the judgment was a fair one.190

On the day of the execution, after the gallows had been prepared,
and just minutes before the murderers were to be hanged, it was
announced that their sentences had been commuted to fifteen years
banishment to Siberia because of the intercession of the Bahá’ís. One of
the convicts protested this change, saying that he did not want to receive
any mercy from the hands of the Bahá’ís.191

Bahá’u’lláh was pleased that the Bahá’ís of ‘Ishqábád would plead
for mercy for their enemies and He praised this act very much. In Epistle

The verdict of the trial of the murderers of Muhammad-Ridá
opened a new era in the history of the Bahá’ís in ‘Ishqábád. Russia
became the only country in the world to extend full recognition to the
Bahá’í Faith and offer its followers complete protection from
persecution. The city became a refuge for Bahá’ís seeking freedom and
opportunity outside of Írán, and the Bahá’í community grew rapidly in
size and prestige.193

Appendix 1

Biography of the Principle

Eyewitness-Authors

Of the historical documents presented in this monograph, twelve of
them are eyewitness accounts by Ustád ‘Alí Akbar Banná Yazdí and
Mírza Abú’l-Fadl, who both lived in ‘Ishqabad at the time of the incident
of Hájí Muhammad-Ridá’s martyrdom and were closely aware of all the
details, particularly the events subsequent to this martyrdom. In order
for the reader to become better acquainted with these authors, a brief
biography of each is offered in this appendix.

Ustád ‘Alí Akbar Banná Yazdí
Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar Banná was born and raised in Yazd and worked as a
master-builder for the city’s affluent, particularly the Governor. After
becoming a Bahá’í, he was particularly enthusiastic about teaching the
new Faith. In 1295 AH [1878], the Bahá’í teacher Nabíl Akbar was
traveling through Yazd and this roused the interest of a fanatical cleric,
who used the occasion to issue a fatwá condemning Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar to
death. Wishing to avoid unpleasant disturbances, the Governor advised
both prominent Bahá’ís to leave the city. They went to Isfahan, stayed a
few days in the home of Mírzá Muhammad-Hasan and Mírzá
Muhammad-Husayn, later immortalized by the titles “the King of
Martyrs” and “the Beloved of Martyrs”, respectively. Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar
then went to Tehran while Nabíl Akbar remained in Isfahan.

Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar stayed for nine months in the capital, succeeding
in introducing a number of individuals to the Faith. He then returned to
Yazd. On his return, his enemies began agitating the authorities against
him. The ‘ulamá again issued a fatwá for his death and gave it to the

Governor for execution. But his qualities and skills had endeared him to
the Governor, who extended his protection to him. However, Ustád
‘Alí-Akbar’s life was still in danger, because having failed to put him to
death officially, his enemies plotted assiduously to assassinate him. For
several years he was the target of many intrigues, but continued to teach
the Faith.

As his autobiography indicates, many incidents took place against
him during these years in Yazd. Eventually, after consultation with the
Afnáns, it was decided that Ustád ‘Ali-Akbar should go to ‘Ishqabad. He
arrived there in the year 1301 AH [1883].

As noted earlier, a few members of the Afnán family had taken
considerable interest in ‘Ishqabad. Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí Afnán
had purchased some properties in that city on the advice of his younger
brother Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Taqí, the Vakílu’d-Dawlih, who served
as the Russian Consul in Yazd.

For about two years Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar was engaged in building
shops, a caravanserai and houses for the Afnáns. He then received
permission from Bahá’u’lláh to go on pilgrimage to ‘Akká in 1303 AH
[1885]. It appears that it was at this time that the renowned Lawh
Tajalliyat was revealed in his honor.194 In this Tablet, Bahá’u’lláh
addresses him in the following words:

> We testify that thou hast set thy face towards God and traveled far
> until thou didst attain His presence and gavest ear unto the Voice of
> this Wronged One, Who hath been cast into prison through the
> misdeeds of those who have disbelieved in the signs and testimonies of
> God and have denied this heavenly grace through which the whole world
> hath been made to shine. Blessed be thy face, for it hath turned unto
> Him, and thine ear, for it hath heard His Voice, and thy tongue, for it
> hath celebrated the praise of God, the Lord of lords. We pray God to
> graciously aid thee to become a standard for the promotion of His

Aqdas, pp. 47-54.

> Cause and to enable thee to draw nigh unto Him at all times and
> under all conditions.195

On his return to ‘Ishqabad, Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí had
purchased a parcel of land from a certain Armenian by the name of
A‘zam, and construction of a two-storey building on the corner of the
land was commenced by Ustád ‘Alí Akbar. At Bahá’u’lláh’s direction,
this land was also set aside as a site for the future Mashriqu’l-Adhkar.

By then the Bahá’í community of ‘Ishqabad was growing in
influence and prestige. It was not much later that in September 1889, the
martyrdom of Hájí Muhammad-Ridá, who lived with Ustád ‘Alí Akbar,
took place.

Ustád ‘Ali-Akbar went on pilgrimage once more in 1311 AH
[1893] during the Ministry of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. It was on this occasion that
under the direction of ‘Abdu'l-Bahá, who conceived the plan for a nine-
sided building, he designed the main features of the House of Worship.
In his last Tablet to Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá confirms that this
design was drawn when Ustád was in the Holy Land, and asks him to
send a few copies to one of the Hands of the Cause in Iran. It was,
however, a Russian architect who planned and executed the details of the
construction; this began in 1902 when the foundation stone was laid in a
ceremony in the presence of the Czar’s representative General
Krupatkin, the Governor-General of Turkistan.

Ustad ‘Alí-Akbar took a leading role in this construction.

However, only six months had passed from the laying of the foundation
stone when he received a Tablet from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá urging him to go on
a visit to Yazd in the spring. He advised him not to hesitate or delay his
departure.

After twenty years of absence, he arrived in Yazd in the spring of
1903\. His arrival, however, once again created a stir among the fanatical
population who circulated rumors that he had returned to build a Bahá'í
Temple in that city. The people who lived in his neighborhood were
particularly angry, because over the years he had succeeded in converting
many individuals to the Faith.
195   Bahá’u’lláh, Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, p. 48.

In the meantime, one of the Hands of the Cause, Ibn Abhar, was
dispatched by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Yazd. Large gatherings were held where
Ibn Abhar spoke and encouraged the believers.

Shortly thereafter, a massive pogrom of the Bahá’í communities of
that region erupted. This was the severest persecution of Bahá’ís until
that date. Although it lasted only a few days, every Bahá’í found in the
region was put to death in the most heinous manner. Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar
was among those martyred. The first fatal shot was fired by one of his
close relatives. He fell to the ground and shouted, “Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá!”
Then crowds of people attacked, smashed his head with a pickaxe, tied a
rope to his feet and dragged his corpse through the city where hundreds
of people hurled stones at it and inflicted blows upon it. His disfigured
body was then lowered into a deep unused well on the outskirts of the
city in which the bodies of other martyrs had been deposited.

Although Ustád ‘Alí Akbar only had an elementary education, he is
the author of a remarkably cogent book on proofs, which remains
unpublished. Also around 1901 or 1902, he wrote a detailed account of
the early days of the Faith in ‘Ishqabad, portions of which are cited in
this monograph. His achievements in the teaching field were most
remarkable. He notes in his autobiography that 300 individuals had come
into the Faith as a direct result of his teaching efforts.

Twenty-seven Tablets were revealed in his honor by Bahá’u’lláh –
several of which are cited in this study – and many more by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá.

Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl
Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl Gulpáygání (1844-1914) was the preeminent Iranian
Bahá’í scholar and apologist of his generation, who also contributed
considerably to the advance of the Faith in Turkmenistan, Lebanon,
Egypt, and the United States, and was designated as one of the Apostles
of Bahá’u’lláh by Shoghi Effendi.

A trained seminarian, he became a Bahá’í after a series of
encounters with various promoters of the Faith. He soon faced
persecution, and after sustaining several years of harassment in Iran,

which included a period of imprisonment, Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl arrived in
‘Ishqabad from Mashhad on 15 July 1889. A short time later, on 8
September of the same year, the assassination of Hájí Muhammad-Ridá
Isfahání occurred. Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl immediately helped the Bahá’í
community to respond to this event and served as the learned
spokesman and the de facto lawyer for the Bahá’ís at the trial of the
assassins and their accomplices. This event established the independence
of the Bahá’í Faith from Islam both for the Russian government and for
the people of ‘Ishqabad, and was referred to in a number of Tablets by
Bahá’u’lláh. Moreover, in several Tablets, Bahá’u’lláh expressed His
strong approval of the manner in which Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl had conducted
himself and led the Bahá’í community of that town. For instance, the
following is recorded in a Tablet addressed to Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím
Ardabílí, a leading Bahá’í of ‘Ishqabad, revealed shortly after these
events:

> It is Our wish and desire to conclude this Tablet by remembering
> Abú’l-Fadl, upon him be My glory and loving providence. My Tongue
> and Pen bear witness to his purity, his service, his perseverance, and his
> presence at this very moment before the gate of the mercy of God, the
> Lord of the worlds. Glory be upon him and upon those who have
> attained unto justice and equity and observed what hast been prescribed
> unto them as bidden by Him who is the Ordainer, the All-Wise.196

As noted earlier, during the entire three months of investigation
and trial, Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl kept Bahá’u’lláh informed of the events
through letters that he wrote to various Bahá’ís in ‘Akká. One of the
Tablets revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in honor of the great Mírzá at that time
which touches on a number of critical themes is the following:

In the Name of the Incomparable, the Peerless God!

> The highest praise is due to them who have immersed themselves in the
> ocean of detachment—they who in the darkness of these times, before
> the cruelty of men, while plunged in sorrows and afflicted with anguish

> and setting their faces on the everlasting Sun. The veils of names have
> not failed to keep them back from the Possessor of all things. They have

> Verily, they are those servants who have quaffed My sealed Wine in
> My Name, the Self-Subsisting. In their estimation, all else but God
> hath been and wilt remain like unto a handful of dust. Names have

> and repudiate the Bayán have trembled! Glorified be His power,
magnified be His might! There is no other god but Him!

O thou who hast fixed thine eyes upon My horizon! O thou
> who hast upraised the banner of My triumph by virtue of thy wisdom
> and utterance! I testify that thou hast desired the betterment of the

> glorified be He—to reinforce and assist thee with the hosts of the seen
> and the unseen. Verily, He is the Friend of the doers of good. His
> mercy hath surpassed all things and His loving-kindness encompassed
> all. Blessed is every fair-minded person that hath judged His Cause
> fairly. Well is it with every just one who hath spoken equitably
concerning that which He hath manifested.

O Abú’l-Fadl! My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy be
> upon thee! That which hath transpired in that land is evident and
> clear. Glorified be the One Who hath protected His chosen ones from
> sedition, iniquity, and corrupt inclinations and commanded them to be
> righteous and God-fearing. Praised be God that they were killed in His
> path yet did not kill. At all times and under all conditions, enjoin the

new upheaval is stirred up and some new commotion doth appear.

{We cherish the hope that one of the kings of the earth will, for
the sake of God, arise for the triumph of this wronged, this oppressed

> Happy is the man that hearkeneth and observeth My counsel. Woe
unto him that faileth to fulfill My wish.}199

Forget such things, O Pen, and place Thy trust wholly in God,

> blood which hath been shed in the path of Thy love, to forgive those
> servants of Thine who have fulfilled their pledge to Thy Covenant and
> Testament and have confessed their belief in that which hath been sent
> down in Thy perspicuous Book. Praised be Thou, O Lord of the
> worlds!200

After these events, Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl remained for a time in that
city and tried to persuade the Bahá’ís to use their freedom there to
undertake various activities, especially the publication of a Bahá’í journal.

199 This passage has been translated by Shoghi Effendi and appears in Gleanings from
the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 207.
200 Provisional translation graciously contributed by Omid Ghaemmaghami.

Unfortunately, like most other great men, he was thinking ahead of the
rest of the community and it was not until 1922-23 that this was realized.

Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl’s aim in going to Turkmenistan had been to take
the Bahá’í Faith to more remote regions and, as such, after eight months
in ‘Ishqabad, he moved to Samarqand in February 1890.
