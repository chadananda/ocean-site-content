There were two strongly de5ned sides to
Horace Holley's personality, and part of the
spiritual triumph that was his before he
passed away, at the age of 73, was that these
two sides of his nature flowered into a third
creation, more bea~~tiful   and powerful than
either of the others had ever been. To under-
stand this process one must go bbac to the
forces that shaped his life. Not only did he
possess a briliiant, analytical mind, but at the
sametimehewas a dreamer, ideatist and mystic.
His strong personal bent was literature and
those of the BahB'is familiar tvith his books,
his letters, articles md speeches as a Brth$i,
are pabaps unaware of the fact that he was
a poet and had published between the ages
of twenty-one and thirty three volumes of
verse. His capacities and interests led him

Maude Elizabeth Todd Fisher was buried
high up on a hillside looking down ouer a
great green valley toward the Lobornbo
Mountains and the people she loved. The
African people call this vaIley Ezulweni, which,
Iike the word Ridvgn, means "paradise."

A srnaIl vial of attar-of-rose, a gift to her
from her beloved Guardian, was placed in
her hands.

Words were spoken in both the English and
African languages on that sunny July day
when the earthly remains of Maude Fisher
were laid to rest; words that told of the
happiness she had brought to the African
peoplc.

The ceremony was closed with a prayer of
Bahii'u'llah and these words spoken on behalf
of ail the African friends who loved her:

"Tsama2a hantle, 'M'a rona kdofeela. Re
fl rata hahob." ("Go well, nlother of 11s all.

ha\re people come to a home for the purpose
of promulgating any religion other than the
religion of the country. Again Kenneth's
lips were sealed to teach the Faith without
restraints. During three years he began to
look inward; he went to his beloved books;
he established pdtwns of prayer-campaigns;
he sought understmding. His eloquence, his
intellectual cleverness, his lightning-Iike
thought processes and his trenlendous knowl-
edge of the teachings-all seemed useless.
Tn short, during these times he began to
become a growing spirit. It was also during
this period that a pilgrimage was inade to
the World Center at Haifa, and to meet the
bejoved Guardian---a never-to-be-forgotten
event. Also during these years Kenneth was
accepted as a Fellow of the Royal Society of
Arts and the Royal Geographic Society.

That Salvador Torcno was guided and

from the many letters received from the
Guardian. Oiie letter written to him, dated
July 1, 1941, reads:

By 2937 conditions in Germany had
worsened and were pasticulaxiy ominous for
the Baha'is. Their books and funds had been
seized by the Government, and their nleetings

friends during this period was constant; one
never knew from day to day what new tcst

fear was "r-ather for those Gicnds who, due
lo their insufficient reaiization of the divine
power that inysteriousIy operates in the Faith,
are prone to Iook at such deve'loyments as
coilstituting the death knell of the Cause,"
whereas, in reality, he continued, "Trials and
tribulations, as BalzB'u'IlAh says, are the
oil that feeds the lamp of the Came and are
indeed blessings in disguise." During this
time the Guardian was directiag Mr. Greevea's
