## Mortensen, Fred

### by [Justin Penoyer](https://bahai-library.com/author/Justin+Penoyer)

2007


                                                                                                        1

        Born February 7th, 1887 at Fort Dodge, Iowa, Fred Mortensen was the third son of

an impoverished immigrant family. His parents, James and Johanna, had arrived from

Denmark just a few years prior with the hope that James would find better work as a

violinist. Sadly, this never came to fruition, and James was unable to provide adequate

support for his family of thirteen children.1 Falling prey to the bottle, he gradually

became a drunk, and, little by little, stopped coming home.2

        By 1893, nearly six hundred banks and fifteen thousand businesses had failed due

to one of the worst economic depressions in American history. It was during this period

that the Mortensen family relocated to Minneapolis, Minnesota. Abandoned by their

father, the Mortensen brothers quit school in order to provide for their family. Even at a

very young age they managed to cope with what was available—stealing food or digging

through garbage cans behind restaurants. In time Fred and his two older brothers found

work with the Minneapolis Star newspaper. Initially hired as menial labor, Fred soon

became a mailer. However, he resented this position, and by the age of ten left the

Minneapolis Star for the streets.3

        After a short time roaming the neighborhood, the Mortensen brothers soon found

their way into a local gang. Lacking the valuable guidance of a father figure, Fred began

to depend on his fellows for social acceptance. Yet while his peers were important, he felt

naturally their better. He had an innate sense of superiority, a feeling that he could easily

best those around him. Fred was unafraid to speak his mind, and possessed the physical

stature to back his words. Years spent on the streets made him hard and ruthless; he

became a confident, determined, and natural leader, claiming “. . . fighting was a real

pleasure, as welcome as a meal . . .”4

        Fred and his companions spent their days engaged in all manner of reckless

activity. They would often roam the streets looking for trouble, and broke the law

whenever the chance presented itself. He writes, “every day in every way I became

tougher and tougher. And breaking a grocer’s window to steal his fruit or what-not was,

as I thought, a great joke.”5

        In addition to such general mayhem, Fred and his friends spent many days in the

saloon, drinking heavily and brawling. He later recalled, “the great evil that did so much

to make us hard, was the saloon with its attendant evils.” In fact, Fred says, he came to

enjoy brawling—an undertaking to which he found himself well suited. He and his

friends found great pleasure in terrorizing the local populous, especially the Russian

immigrants and Jewish businessmen:6 “Making the Jews feel that they were back in

Russia was lots of fun. I can’t begin to tell you how we enjoyed persecuting them,

stealing their wine, breaking their windows, in fact doing everything but setting fire to

their homes.”7

         Despite his mother’s objections and efforts to teach him a better path, Fred

continued increasingly toward a thug-like lifestyle. He later recalled: “My dear mother

had done everything in her power to make me a good boy. I have the deepest love for her

  Anti-Semitism was strongly displayed in all avenues of American culture at this time. Additionally, Anti-
Semitic plots were causing great controversy in military and government sectors. Record numbers of
immigrants were entering the United States. at this time from Russia and the Balkans. Russians were often
viewed as associated with anarchism, which came under heavy attack after the assassination of President
McKinley in 1901 by Russian anarchist Leon Czolgosz.

  Fred Mortenson. “When a Soul Meets the Master,” originally published March, 1924 in the Baha’i
newsletter Star of the West, now out of print.
                                                                                            3

and my heart has often been sad when thinking of how she must have worried for my

safety as well as my future well-being.”8 Though but seventeen, Fred had become an

intolerant, aggressive, even violent youth.

        In 1904, Fred, his brothers, and other gang members decided to rob a local train.

During the heist, Fred’s younger brother stole a large bag of mail. While his brother was

doing so, Fred spotted a number of police approaching them, scattering the gang.

Concerned that his younger brother was too small to carry the bag and run from the

police, Fred took the bag and ran. While this spared his brother, it made him the target:

“. . . in my haste to get away from them I leaped over a thirty-five foot wall, breaking my

leg, to escape the bullets whizzing around about.”9 He was then taken to jail, where a

prison doctor improperly set his broken leg. As a result, Fred was left with a permanent

limp, the broken leg a bit shorter than the other.10

        The following months were spent in jail, recovering from his injury. It was during

his incarceration that Fred’s life was changed irrevocably. Appointed to defend him was

Albert Hall, an established lawyer well known for his willingness to defend the poor. Hall

was also, by this time, a well-known and respected Baha’i—later appointed to the Baha’i

Temple Unity and President of the Executive Board. Besides handling Fred’s case, Hall

spent many nights speaking to Fred about the Baha’i faith—an independent world

religion devoted to building unity among all people. Fred would later recall:

        Albert Hall told me, hour after hour, about the great love of Abdu’l-Baha

        for all His children and that He was here to help us show that love for our

        fellowmen. Honestly, I often wondered then what Mr. Hall meant when he

                                                                                              4

        talked so much about love—God’s love, Baha’u’llah’s love, Abdu’l-

        Baha’s love, love for the Covenant, love for us, from us to God, to His

        Prophets, etc. I was bewildered.11

        Because Fred could not read at this time, Hall gave him a dictionary to use in

order to read a Baha’i book also provided by Hall. With the aid of these new books, Fred

taught himself how to read. For reasons even he did not completely understand at the

time, Fred’s experience in jail had a profound impact. However, as soon as he was able to

walk, Fred decided it was time to leave. While in jail, he lured a guard close enough to

his cell to take him by the neck, strangle him to unconsciousness, and take the keys. 12

        Fred spent the next four years as a fugitive. He fled first to California, where he

worked for the Oakland paper. After experiencing the great earthquake of 1906—

undoubtedly shaken by the ordeal—Fred decided the Midwest was a far safer region.

He then toured the Dakotas, moving from town to town, occasionally finding

employment with local papers.13 It was during this time that Fred rediscovered the book

given to him by Albert Hall. Yet unlike four years prior—and somewhat mysteriously

to Fred—his mind became fixated upon the words of Abdu’l-Baha. Though faced with

possible arrest, in 1910 he returned to Minneapolis to visit Hall—a district attorney—to

learn more about the Baha’i faith: “I returned to become more bewildered, so I thought;

and I wondered why.”14

        Fred was in regular communication with Albert Hall who, despite his status as an

attorney, did not turn him in to the police. This, combined with Fred’s surprise at a

complete lack of attention given by the authorities, gave the impression that he need no

longer fear prosecution for his jailbreak. No longer a fugitive, Fred moved to

Minneapolis. In 1912, Fred heard of Abdu’l-Baha’s visit to Green Acre,15 and rumor that

he might return to Palestine, failing to come West: “I heard rumor that he might go back

home and not come west, and immediately determined to go see him. I wasn’t going to

miss meeting Abdu’l-Baha after waiting so long to see him.”16

           Such a marked new interest in religion, especially an eastern religion, by a rogue

and thief such as Fred raises a number of questions. What is the Baha'i faith? Where are

its roots and what was its place in early twentieth-century American society? Was it a

passing fad of the time, sparked by popular interest in Orientalism and

transcendentalism? Fred was not a spiritual man, yet his exposure to the Baha'i faith

changed him completely—why? In light of this dramatic change, a brief history of that

religion is necessary in order to appreciate its influence on him.

           The Baha'i teachings were set forth in the mid-nineteenth century by Baha'u'llah,

meaning "the Glory of God." Born Mirza Husayn-' Ali, an Iranian nobleman, Baha'u'llah

abandoned a life of affluence and prestige in favor of service to humanity. Known for his

charity and wisdom, he was called "Father of the Poor" and spent his days providing

comfort to the needy.

           In 1844, word reached Baha'u'llah of a new religion—the Babi faith. Siyyid 'Ali

Muhammad, or the Bab ("the Gate") announced that he was the new divine Messenger

promised by Muhammad. The Bab prepared his followers for another Manifestation of

God who was to come after him and unite all humanity. When Baha'u'llah learned of the

     “When a Soul Meets the Master.”
                                                                                                      6

Bab's message, he became a Babi and began to champion the new faith. The Babis faced

intense persecution by Muslim authorities and thousands gave their lives as a result of

their beliefs. This included the Bab, who was executed by firing squad in 1850.17

        Though his family lineage saved him from outright execution, Baha'u'llah

suffered four months of imprisonment in an infamous underground dungeon known as

the Siyah-Chal, or "Black Pit." Bound together under the weight of heavy chains, in

awful conditions, fellow Babis were daily sent to the executioner. It was under these

conditions that Baha'u'llah witnessed a breathtaking vision: a "Maid of Heaven"

appeared, announcing Baha'u'llah's station as God's newest Manifestation. Like the dove

that appeared to Jesus Christ and the angel Gabriel's visitation to Muhammad, this vision

marked the beginning of Baha'u'llah's revelation.18

        Baha'u'llah's message was one of universal peace and brotherhood, and, even

more revolutionary for the time, that all religions were a part of the progressive One

Religion of God, systematically revealed by each Messiah. Baha'u'llah declared that this

new revelation from God provided the spiritual foundations for the imminent

globalization of humanity. Baha'u'llah's revelation included eleven tenets to which all

Baha'is must adhere:19



        1. The Oneness of God: The Universe and all creation therein have been created

by God and are moving toward God. He is Unknowable, Omnipotent, Omniscient, All-

Perfect, Supremely Good, and Supremely Loving.

        2. The Oneness of Humanity: Humanity is the apogee of Creation, the highest

form of life: "Ye are the Fruits of One Tree, and the Leaves of One Branch. Deal ye one

with another with the utmost love and harmony, with friendliness and fellowship. . . . So

powerful is the Light of Unity that it can illumine the whole Earth.”20

        3. The Oneness of Religion: Baha'u'llah declared that humanity is undergoing a

collective maturation process similar to that of individual humans. At each stage of

development, God sends a new Messenger to teach humanity. This has been the same

Holy Spirit manifested in each new Age, a concept known as “progressive revelation.”

Since the essence of each revelation is the same, all religions belong to the same Religion

of God: "Many Lanterns, One Light. Love the Light, not the Lantern.”21

        4. Independent Investigation of Truth: Baha'is believe that one of the main

sources of conflict today is the fact that many people blindly and uncritically follow

various traditions, movements, and opinions, leading to fanaticism. The critical search for

truth enables an individual to know why he or she adheres to any given ideology or

doctrine: "Being One, Truth cannot be divided, and the differences that appear to exist

among the many nations only result from their attachment to prejudice. If only men

would seek out truth, they would find themselves united.”22

        5. The Spiritual Foundations of Society: If individuals remain greedy, immature,

selfish, and unspiritual, even the most perfect economic scheme will not work. A

satisfactory solution to the world's present economic calamity lies in a profound change

in hearts and minds, which only religion can produce. As humanity's fundamental nature

is spiritual, there can be no lasting solution to any human problem that does not take this

into account.

           6. Equality of Men and Women: Women have all the intellectual abilities of men,

which will be more clearly evident as humanity matures. Women have not yet fully

realized their potential for historically they have been denied educational and social

opportunities. As greater feminine influence shapes humanity across nations, there will

be an elimination of war, resulting in permanent peace.

           7. The Compatibility between Science and Faith: As Truth is but One Truth, it is

impossible to find something scientifically false and religiously true. Religion and

Science are “the wings upon which the intelligence of humanity can soar into the heights,

with which the human soul can progress. Should man try to fly upon the wing of religion

alone he would quickly fall into the quagmire of superstition, while on the other hand,

with the wing of science alone he would quickly fall into the despairing slough of

materialism. Either alone makes no progress.”23

           8. Elimination of the Extremes of Wealth and Poverty: An imbalance in economic

conditions is a gross injustice to humanity and an obstacle to the establishment of unity.

This does not imply that all individuals should receive the same income. There are

natural differences in human needs and capacities, and some categories of service to

society, which merit greater recompense than others. However, limits on minimum

welfare standards as well as maximum income levels must be established.

           9. Establishment of a Universal Auxiliary Language: The multiplicity of

languages in the current world is a major impediment toward world unity. It simply

prevents the free flow of information and prevents an individual from obtaining a

universal perspective on world events. The tendency of a group or nation to be attached

to its language can result in ethnocentricity. This invariably leads to conflict.

         10. Establishment of a Universal Education: As education is absolutely necessary

in establishing one's search for truth, and preventing the evils that result from ignorance,

the world community must provide education to all. A universal education also prevents

“half-education,” wherein fundamentalists teach doctrines of hatred and prejudice.

         11. Abandoning Prejudice and Superstition: Prejudice and superstition are beliefs

that result from strong emotional attachment and the lack of investigation of truth,

keeping oneself engulfed in unawareness. Any prejudice—be it racial, economic, social,

or linguistic—will prevent humanity from attaining unity, which is essential to world

peace.

         Baha’u’llah named his son Abdu’l-Baha, the “Most Pure Branch,” the sole

interpreter of his writings. He was seen as living in perfect accordance with the revelation

of Baha’u’llah, and served as the ideal standard toward which all Baha’is should aspire.

         Despite rampant persecutions, Baha'u'llah's influence spread quickly. The

movement Baha'u'llah began in 1853 soon found its way to America. In 1893, Reverend

George A. Ford, a Syrian missionary, made the first public mention of the Baha'i faith in

the West at the World's Parliament of Religions in New York. In 1894, Syrian professor

Dr. Ibrahim Khayru’llah arrived in Chicago, Illinois. Educated in ancient religions, Dr.

Khayru’llah became aware of the Baha'i faith while living in Syria. He possessed a

number of Baha'u'llah's writings, however incomplete, which he took with him to
                                                                                                           10

Chicago. There, Dr. Khayru'llah began to speak of Baha’u’llah in the hope of finding new

believers. He soon found a welcome audience.24

         America was then ripe with a passion for the new and the mystical. The Victorian

paradigm—though reaching its twilight—was still active: great interest in Japonisme,

science and philanthropy,25 wealthy elitism, and a foul view of the “underclass” seen as

lesser creatures. This was the age of the industrial empires of Carnegie, Vanderbilt, and

Rockefeller; the industrial revolution—with its attendant child labor, deadly work

conditions, monopolies, and union battles—was in full swing.

         Yet others, whose stories are rarely told, pressed for progress, equality, and a

return to religious purism–a so-called “renaissance” sweeping America. This renaissance

encompassed a number of intellectual, social, and religious movements initiated by a

generation of educated youth who had become disenchanted with the institutions of their

day. American scholars were preoccupied with issues concerning the relation among

religion, society, and science; and many wanted to move toward a social advancement

based on sound moral, scientific, and economic truths. There also existed a desire among

many Christian organizations to return to an "old Christianity," one of love, social

service, brotherhood, care of the poor, and the search for truth.26

         These intellectual and religious movements were a part of a generation influenced


24
   Hatcher, pp. 44-46.
25
   Japonisme: a late-Victorian interest in the Orient, which often included Japan, Egypt, North Africa,
Persia, and China. The Victorian mind-set often used science to support a bigoted view of the “underclass”
as filthy, childlike, and excessively sexual, and lacking respect for property. For much of this time period,
there was rampant poverty in America, at times reaching 40 percent.
The research of Darwin, thirty years prior, had created a large Victorian interest in philanthropy; often used
to support racism, justify segregation, and racial purity.

by transcendentalism, which created within them an active spirit, revolutionary attitude,

and desire to prove themselves. They tended to overlook evil and focus on the good, to

refute the established doctrines of their time, and to seek new areas of truth for new and

fresh beginnings in a search for their role in life and nature. This search gave rise to,

among other features, a surge in "new age" interests such as eastern mysticism and

various occult topics.27

        In her 1892 essay, "The Subjective Necessity of Social Settlements," Jane

Addams, founder of the Hull House in Chicago, shared her view of the nature of these

movements. Influenced by the Settlement movement underway in England, a great

number of young, educated people were seeking the means to change what they saw as

great social maladjustments of their day, such as the over-accumulation of resources by

the rich, the destitution of the poor, and the lack of progress toward racial equality. They

were a new generation, she said, one that longed for a means to establish universal

brotherhood and unity: "toward that which makes us all alike, rather than that which

makes us different." What they sought was a tangible, and lasting, expression of

democracy—one based on universal morality and sympathy.28

        However, many had become frustrated. Though sincere in emotion, they felt they

lacked direction and a means to such ends: "These longings are the physical complement

of the Intimations of Immortality, on which no ode has yet been written. To portray these

would be the work of a poet, and it is hazardous for any but a poet to attempt it."29 Those

of stronger character, she stated, became involved in the Christian humanitarian

movement. "This is a turning," she says, "this renaissance of the early Christian

humanitarianism, going on in America, in Chicago, if you please.”30

        Living in Chicago at this time was an insurance salesman, Thorton Chase, later

considered to be the first Western Baha'i. A few years before, Chase became a follower

of the eighteenth-century mystic Emanuel Swedenborg. Swedenborg had spoken of a

"new era" of Christianity similar to the Christian humanitarian movement underway in

America. During his research into ancient religions, Chase was told by a friend of a "God

who walked upon the Earth.”31 Chase wanted to meet the person who made such a bold

statement, and was introduced to a Syrian professor who had recently arrived in

Chicago—Dr. Khayru'llah. During the course of their studies together, he learned of what

Dr. Khayru'llah called the "Baha'i movement of the Orient," or the Baha'i faith. Chase

became enthralled with the writings of Baha'u'llah, which he shared with enthusiastic

friends. Together, Mr. Chase said, he and four others formally accepted the message of

Baha'u'llah, marking the first foothold of the Baha'i faith in America.32

        Dr. Khayru'llah also introduced the Baha'i faith to another native of Chicago, Lua

Moore, known later as Lua Getsinger, in 1897. Getsinger later became one of the most

important figures of the early American Baha'i community due to her great missionary

zeal and pure heart. Abdu’l-Baha gave her the name "Banner of the Cause" as a response

to her work, and Shoghi Effendi, Abdu’l-Baha's grandson, later named her "The Mother

Teacher of the West." She can be directly credited with planting the seeds of many Baha'i

communities across the nation. In early 1898, Getsinger arrived in San Francisco. She

soon attracted the attention of wealthy socialite Phoebe Hearst, wife of George Hearst

and mother to William Randolph Hearst. Hearst was well educated, and by this time

already well known for her humanitarian efforts and pure Christian heart. She met with

Getsinger on several occasions, during which Hearst's butler Robert Turner was also

present. Turner would later become the first African American Baha'i.33

         Hearst was deeply moved by Baha'u'llah's message, the essence of which almost

certainly appealed to her both as a humanitarian and a woman. She was known for her

active personality, as well as her love for travel. Not surprisingly, in 1898, Hearst

organized the first pilgrimage of Western Baha’is to Palestine. Together with Robert

Turner, Dr. Khayru'llah, Lua Getsinger, as well as several members of Hearst's family

(who later became the first Baha'is in Europe), she undertook a pilgrimage to the prison

city of 'Acca to see Abdu’l-Baha, who had been imprisoned there for nearly forty years.34

         This proved to be a significant event, for it was then that Abdu’l-Baha became

fully aware of the growing Baha'i community in America. The pilgrimage established

communication between Abdu’l-Baha and the new converts in America, which enabled

him to guide and bless their progress into the Baha'i faith.35

         Partially as a result of a rift caused by Dr. Khayru'llah,36 in 1900 Abdu’l-Baha

sent the first authorized Baha'i teachers to America in order to properly educate new

converts there. These teachers included Mirza Asadu'llah, Mirza Hasan-i-Khurasani, and

Mirza Abu'l- Fadl. Dr. Abu'l-Fadl had held one of the most honored positions in Persia

   Dr. Khayru'llah, after a pilgrimage to meet Baha'u'llah in 1898, was told by Abdu’l-Baha that he needed
to further research and contemplate the writings of Baha'u'llah, which Dr. Khayru'llah refused to do. Instead
he attempted to establish himself in the West as the sole interpreter of the Baha'u'llah's writings, which
caused a great deal of turmoil for the early Baha'is of America. His attempt, however, failed entirely.

until his conversion: that of the President of the Royal College of Teheran. Forced to give

up his position after his declaration of his belief in Baha'u'llah, he had recently been

released after spending three years in one of Persia's worse dungeons. Mirza Asadu'llah

and Mirza Hasan-i-Khurasani were well loved by Abdu’l-Baha, and he felt they were

most capable adherents and teachers of the Baha'i faith.37

           Chase stressed the education that these teachers had provided. Some, who had

previously confused the Baha'i faith with the occult, lost their trust in the new faith.

Others, through the instruction of these teachers, confirmed their belief. Yet as a net

result, these men were instrumental in presenting an accurate message of the Baha'i faith

to America.38

           By 1909, through the efforts of such people as Thorton Chase and Lua Getsinger,

Baha'i communities emerged in and around the cities of Chicago, San Francisco, and

New York. Chicago remained a leading center of Baha'i activity in the United States; and

representative of the great zealousness typical of the era, in 1903 eleven Chicago Baha'is

petitioned Abdu’l-Baha for permission to build a Baha'i temple in the West. This was

accepted, and in 1906, eight hundred Baha'is from across the nation signed another

petition supporting temple construction in Chicago. Corrine True delivered this petition

to Abdu’l-Baha in 1907, and Abdu’l-Baha subsequently entrusted True with his

instructions. Later that year, the Chicago Baha'i Assembly became the first Baha'i

community to gain legal status, and in early 1908 the first plot of land for the future

temple was purchased. From this point onward, the construction of a temple became the

central concern of Baha'is nationwide, thereby marking a first step toward developing a

unified American Baha'i community.39

        Many of those Baha'is who traveled to California and New York first learned of

the Baha'i faith in Chicago, and took with them the great zeal of the community members

there. Chicago certainly became the focal point of the Midwest, which resulted in the

establishment of Baha'i communities across Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Ohio, and

Minnesota.40

        California also became the home of a number of Baha'is during this period. The

community was centered in San Francisco, largely the result of enthused and determined

Baha'is such as Phoebe Hearst and Robert Turner. There were also many so-called “old-

timers” in this area that had traveled there from Chicago, not least of whom was Thorton

Chase. His position with the Mutual Life Insurance Society allowed him to travel

extensively, and much to the chagrin of his employers, he spent more time speaking on

the Baha'i faith than he did selling insurance. Most assuredly, he planted the seeds of the

Baha’i faith in every city that provided an audience.41

        New York City represented the eastern center of the Baha'i community in

America, and held an active Baha'i population. Involved in the rising Baha’i movement

was Paul and Mary Ida Haney. Paul and Mary were certainly a part of their generation.

Both were educated and raised in spiritual households, yet both never fully accepted any

one faith wholeheartedly. This was particularly difficult for Paul, who was the son of

Reverend Richard Haney, a famous Methodist minister and one of the founders of

Northwestern University in Evanston. Together, the Haneys spent seven years exploring

different faith and philosophical based systems, exploring sects and even Christian

Science. This ended in 1900, for while staying at a hotel in Chicago, they were

introduced to the Baha'i faith by friends of Thorton Chase. Finally, they had found what

they believed they had been searching for. Shortly after declaring their acceptance of

Baha'u'llah they moved to New York, where they became active members of the

community.42

          In 1907, the first Baha'i Convention of America was held in Chicago. The

convention consisted of thirty-nine delegates from thirty-six cities across the nation. The

intention of the convention was clear: to create a means of establishing an active Western

Baha'i community. This centered upon three key goals: unity, a practical means of

reaching all Baha'is, and galvanization. A major aspect of this was the creation of the

Baha'i Temple Unity, an executive board entrusted with the establishment and

construction of the future Baha'i temple, which was of primary concern for most Baha'is

at the time.43

          In the convention's pursuit of a practical means of reaching all Baha'is nationwide,

the Baha’i News, a monthly newspaper, was established in 1909 and based in Chicago.

This newspaper was sent to both individual members and to local Spiritual Assemblies

(local Baha'i communities). Not only did this provide a sense of community among

American Baha'is, but it provided vital access for all Baha'is to the guidance of Abdu’l-

Baha. The Baha'is of the Middle East and the United States engaged in regular

communication through the Baha'i News, which allowed questions to be posed to Abdu’l-

Baha and his subsequent reply to be shared with all. Much guidance and resolution

resulted from this communication.44

           In order to galvanize the American Baha'i community, it was decided that there

should exist a means of providing Baha'i scripture to all. What resulted was the Baha'i

Publishing Society, established in 1911. Also based in Chicago, the society produced

Baha'i writings and books, many available for the first time. This was vital in that it

provided everyone with a comprehensive source of Baha'i scripture.45

           In just over fifteen years, the Baha'i faith spread from Chicago to Boston,

Honolulu to New York, Los Angeles to Akron, and Denver to Kenosha. The rapid

expansion of the Baha'i faith is testament both to the message of Baha'u'llah and to the

social circumstances that provided fertile ground for its acceptance. Reflecting on the

tenets established by Baha'u'llah and the social movements of the time, it is clearer why

early Baha'is might have found the Baha'i faith appealing. Evidently, many early Baha’is

were well educated, financially advantaged, or popular socialites. And it is this very

distinction that made Fred Mortenson unique among them.

           Referred to as "the most important institution of its kind in the world" by the

Guardian of the Baha'i faith, Green Acre, Maine, occupies a unique place in Baha’i

history. Built originally as the Eliot Hotel in 1890, it received its name from poet John

Greenleaf Whittier, a personal friend of the Farmer family. Sarah Jane Farmer, a partner

in the hotel, was the daughter of prominent transcendentalist and inventor Moses Gerrish

Farmer and philanthropist Hannah Shapleigh Farmer.46

        While listening to a lecture in Boston, Sarah realized how much more receptive

the heart and mind would be if the body were in a healthy and beautiful environment. She

attended the Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893, and returned with a conviction

to establish Green Acre as a universal platform for the comparative study of religions. A

quotation from Baha'u'llah appeared in the Green Acre program in 1899. And from 1900

to1909, Green Acre provided a center for the development of the early Baha'i

community.47

        Determined to meet Abdu’l-Baha, Fred Mortensen set out from Minneapolis,

Minnesota, to go to Green Acre, Maine. Gathering what little finances he had, he boarded

the train for Cleveland, Ohio. He lacked the funds to travel the entire distance to Maine;

in addition Fred was attracted by a printers’ convention being held in Cleveland.48 He

initially planned on staying a few days, but soon grew restless.

        Despite his enthusiasm, Fred was anxious about meeting Abdu’l-Baha. After all,

who was he, a poor man with dubious history, to meet one such as Abdu’l-Baha? Yet the

night before he left Cleveland, Fred had a dream:

        I was Abdu’l-Baha’s guest; that I sat there at a long table, and many others

        were there, too, and of how He walked up and down telling stories,

        emphasizing with His hands. This, later, was fulfilled and He looked just

        as I saw Him in Cleveland.49

Because his funds were low, Fred had to “hobo” his way to Green Acre. Trains ran, at

this time, on coal power; coated with soot and grime, they were filthy outside the

   “When a Soul Meets the Master.” The ‘fulfillment’ occurred later during the week Fred spent with
Abdu’l-Baha in Malden, Massachusetts.
                                                                                            19

travelers’ compartments. This was not only most unpleasant, but also dangerous and

exhausting. “Riding the rods,” as it was known, Fred hopped a coal train on the Nickel

Plate Railway from Cleveland to Buffalo, New York. He arrived around midnight, where

he then jumped a train headed for Boston, arriving around nine the next morning. Boston

was his last link to Abdu’l-Baha:

           … [as] I crawled off from the top of one of its passenger trains at

           Portsmouth, New Hampshire, I was exceedingly happy. A boat ride, a

           street-car ride, and there I was, at the Gate of Paradise. My heart beating

           double-time, I stepped onto the soil of that to-be-famous center tired, dirty,

           and wondering, but happy.50

Indeed, the reader can imagine Fred’s terrible state: unwashed, covered in coal soot, and

smelling like a railcar. Given the background of most early Baha’is, it is easy to

understand why Fred, looking quite literally like a shabby bum, was given such a cool

reception. In fact, he had a hard time finding anyone who would speak to him.51

           Fred had been given a letter of introduction by Albert Hall to Alfred Lunt, a friend

of Hall’s. But Fred, given such a chill reception, was unable to find someone to give him

directions. Undeterred, he decided to knock on the door of the hotel. It is not difficult to

imagine the shock the two women who answered felt when they saw Fred. Fortunately

for him Mrs. Kinney, another well-known early Baha’i, and her friend Barbara Fitting

were a bit more receptive than those he had previously met. Despite the protests of the

men in the house, they allowed him to wash up and offered him a bed for the night.

Though they told Fred he would be unable to meet Abdu’l-Baha the next day, as his

schedule was full, he might be able to see him before he left for Malden, Massachusetts.52

        The next morning, Fred was directed to the building where Abdu’l-Baha was

greeting visitors. Though he was told Abdu’l-Baha would not be able to meet him, Fred

still wrote his name on the appointment ledger, off to the side, at the very bottom. Just

after, he spotted Abdu’l-Baha:

        Being one of the last arrivals, I was looking around, to make myself

        comfortable, when someone exclaimed, ‘Here He comes, now.’ . . . After

        greeting several others and when about to go to His room, He suddenly

        turned to me and said in a gruff voice (at least I thought so) ‘sit down,’”53

        As Fred sat waiting, the first guest to be called was a doctor who had written a

book on love. After what seemed to him but a moment, Fred was summoned to meet with

Abdu’l-Baha. He recalled, “Why, I nearly wilted. I wasn’t ready. I hadn’t expected to be

called until the very last thing. I had to go, and it was a strange feeling in my heart and

wondering⎯wondering what would happen next.”54

        After inquiring into Fred’s health, Abdu’l-Baha asked him about his trip to Green

Acre, a question Fred sought to avoid, “I dropped my gaze to the floor–and again He put

this question. I lifted my eyes to His eyes and His were as two . . . sparkling jewels,

which seemed to look into my very depths. I knew He knew and I must tell. . .”55 After

Fred spoke of his train ride from Minneapolis to Green Acre, Abdu’l-Baha’s demeanor

suddenly changed, as if “a wondrous light seemed to pour out. It was the light of love and

I felt relieved and very much happier. He gave me much fruit, and kissed the dirty hat I

wore, which had become soiled on my trip to see Him.”56

        Fred often spoke of the great amount of fruit Abdu’l-Baha gave him during their

conversation. As soon as he finished one piece, he was given another. He would later say

he had never eaten so much fruit in one day. Interestingly, the day before Fred’s arrival at

Green Acre, Abdu’l-Baha asked one of his interpreters to buy a basket of fruit, as he was

expecting a special guest to arrive the next day.57

        Their meeting concluded; Fred most likely returned to the hotel for the night,

undoubtedly moved by his experience. The following day, as Abdu’l-Baha prepared to

leave for Malden, Massachusetts, those Baha’is still at Green Acre gathered to say their

farewells. Fred was among them, waiting to wave to Abdu’l-Baha as his entourage

passed by. He could never have expected what happened next. As Abdu’l-Baha’s car

passed by him, it suddenly stopped, and much to Fred’s surprise Abdu’l-Baha invited him

to spend the week with him in Malden.58

        Unfortunately, what transpired between them during this time is unknown. What

is known, however, is that Abdu’l-Baha and Fred became close friends for the remainder

of their lives. Abdu’l-Baha often referred to Fred as “my son.”59 Such an appellation was

very rare for Abdu’l-Baha to make. They met again briefly a few weeks later, when

Abdu’l-Baha, on his way to Chicago, requested a detour to Minneapolis. This was

unusual in that there was only a small Baha’i community there at the time. Fred, Albert

Hall, and Abdu’l-Baha spent the day together⎯the last time they would meet in person.60

        The events leading up to and culminating in the meeting between Fred and

Abdu’l-Baha are remarkable, even inspirational. Yet Fred’s story was far from over, for

he became a very different person after his time together with Abdu’l-Baha. Fred later

recollected his experience:

        These events are engraved upon the tablet of my heart and I love every

        moment of them. The words of Baha’u’llah are my food, my drink, and

        my life. I have no other aim than to be of service to His Pathway and to be

        obedient to His Covenant.61

        Sadly, jealousy arose among certain members of Baha’i community as a

consequence of the bond shared by Fred and Abdu’l-Baha. This first began in Green

Acre. Referred to as a “filthy, horrid man,”62 Fred—though last to arrive—was given

audience to see Abdu’l-Baha ahead of eminent members of the community. To

compound the matter, Abdu’l-Baha kissed Fred’s sullied hat⎯a rare show of affection to

anyone, let alone a bum. Abdu’l-Baha further aggravated the issue by stopping his car, in

front of the assembled community, and inviting Fred to spend a week with him as a

personal guest. Those who strove to fall into good graces with Abdu’l-Baha were

mortified by his actions. Their jealousy only intensified when Abdu’l-Baha referred to

Fred as a son; later, these sentiments resulted in Fred’s near-expulsion from the early

Baha’i community.63

        A year after their time together, Fred received a letter from Abdu’l-Baha that

included yet another prophecy: “That trip of thine from Minneapolis to Green Acre will

never be forgotten. Its mention will be recorded eternally in books and works of history.”

Thirty-two years later, Abdu’l-Baha’s grandson, the Guardian of the Baha’i faith,

included Fred’s story in God Passes By.64

        Fred’s life underwent a drastic change in direction after meeting Abdu’l-Baha. He

firmly believed that the power of Baha’u’llah’s message had created within him a new

spirit, one devoted to the service of the Baha’i faith. He gave up his bad habits for he now

lived and breathed the Baha’i faith. For the remainder of his years, he became a solid

citizen, and dedicated his life to teaching the word of Baha’u’llah and to the Baha’i

community.65

        Given sufficient funds to travel home by Abdu’l-Baha, Fred returned to

Minneapolis for a short duration, working for the local paper. Yet he soon grew restless,

and felt a call to action.

        Focused on the Baha’i faith, Fred utilized his natural gifts of leadership,

conviction, and action in teaching the message of Baha’u’llah. He decided to go to

Atlanta, Georgia, in 1913 in the hope that he could combat the racial injustices there by

teaching the Baha’i faith. Once again working for the local paper, Fred used his position

to publish many articles about the Baha’i faith. He was also very active in organizing

Baha’i teaching events, and often brought in guest speakers, such as Lewis Gregory, an

active and well-known African American Baha’i. Later, in his book To Move the World,

Lewis stated that because Fred kept him so busy, he dubbed him “Frederick the Great.”

Though Fred taught himself how to read and write, he felt he was not properly qualified

to give public orations on the Baha’i faith.66

         Shortly after the outbreak of World War I, but before U.S. involvement, the

American Baha’i community wanted to send money to Abdu’l-Baha. They were

concerned that he would be left without funds to engage in the many humanitarian

activities for which he was known.67 The Baha’i Temple Unity organized the collection

process, and sent word to Abdu’l-Baha for permission to send a dignitary with the funds.

Abdu’l-Baha responded that he feared such a journey would be impossible because of the

war, though he would allow it. However, he refused the member selected by the Temple

Unity to deliver the funds, and demanded that if funds were to be sent, it must be Fred

who made the delivery. The Temple Unity grudgingly agreed, though they thought this

was the biggest mistake Abdu’l-Baha had ever made: that he, unlike they, simply did not

understand what “these people” were like. Their jealousy toward Fred intensified, for this

was the first and only known instance that Abdu’l-Baha made such a special request.68

         In 1916, Fred boarded a ship for England, where he would then journey to

Palestine. However, much to his disappointment, Fred’s ship never completed its journey;

it was stopped by a German U-boat and searched for weapons. The ship’s captain was

told that if any ammunitions were found, the ship would be sunk. Finding none, they

were ordered back home with the message that any ship found carrying munitions would

be destroyed. A short time later, a U-boat torpedoed the Lusitania.

   While Abdu’l-Baha was visiting America, he purchased a large amount of grain seed, which he took
home with him to Palestine. Fearing the outbreak of a great war, Abdu’l-Baha used the seed to plant large
amounts of wheat, rice, and corn on his estate. During World War I, the large amount of grain reserves fed
the population of Palestine, which spared thousands from certain starvation. In recognition of his services,
Abdu’l-Baha was knighted by the British government.

         Fred spent the following years teaching throughout the United States. He spent a

number of years in Montana, where he experienced great success. Fred published a

number of articles in various newspapers across the state, particularly in Helena and

Butte. In one instance, he felt obliged to correct an article printed in the Montana Record

Herald, which gave credit for the conception of the League of Nations to an unspecified

king of France. Encouraged by friends in Helena, he wrote a letter to the paper in which

he clearly stated that Baha’u’llah, founder of the Baha’i faith, had revealed the basic

principles of the League at least fifty years before it was established; furthermore, these

same principles were explained by his son Abdu’l-Baha in a book titled The Secret of the

Divine Civilization, written in 1875.69 A few years later, Fred wrote an essay titled “The

Three Great Lights,” in which he eloquently described the nature of progressive

revelation. This essay was published in the March 1925 edition of the Star of the West.

         In late 1922, in a late-night diner, Fred met his future wife Kathryn May Rubeck.

Kathryn was a cashier at the time, and was struggling to provide for her newborn son,

Charles, who was under threat of a forced adoption by Kathryn’s mother. The two

became fond of each other, and some time later Fred proposed.70

         Fred considered himself very fortunate, for he always assumed he would never

have children. Of the seven surviving Mortensen children, only one had a child, other

than Fred.71 During their time together, Abdu’l-Baha told Fred that he would have “four

blessings.” Fred later understood what this meant, for he and Kathryn promptly had four

children: Ethel was born in 1923, Fred in 1924, Kathryn in 1925, and Ray, born in

Chicago, in 1927. 72

           In 1925, an earthquake destroyed their home in Helena, Montana. They decided to

move to Chicago, both to be closer to Fred’s mother, living there at the time, as well as to

be closer to the Baha’i Temple. Fred, still very much involved in the Baha’i community,

diverted his attention to the upbringing of his children. Though he worked nights at the

Chicago Tribune, and often arrived home around 3 a.m., he was very involved with his

family. Every night he went over his children’s homework, and he made sure they were

well fed and properly clothed.

           In addition to their school studies, he was very involved in their sports activities

and other interests; and, most important, he taught them the words of Baha’u’llah,

stressing the importance of love in all facets of society. His children all became dedicated

Baha’is. His daughter, Kathryn, remembers him as “a standard of fatherhood,” whom she

viewed as a saint. Fred’s wife Kathryn, though not the educator of the household, was

also a loving parent. Though it was several years before she became a Baha’i, she later

became very active in race relations in Chicago. 73

           Besides raising his family and teaching the Baha’i faith, Fred also enjoyed many

physical recreational activities. He enjoyed boxing, a remnant of his youth, and became

an exceptional exhibitionist boxer despite his limp; he even made some money from this

activity. He was also very active in the local YMCA, was an excellent swimmer and

skater, and enjoyed baseball and handball. In addition to sporting activities, Fred was also

very involved in forming unions. Recollecting his experience with child labor, he

adamantly fought for age limitations, minimum wage, and safer working conditions. His

work toward this end often put him in direct physical danger from anti-unionists.74

         By the end of 1946, at the end of World War II, Fred determined that, his children

now grown, it was time for him to continue his missionary work. He desired to travel to

Germany. Fred believed that the Germans needed the word of Baha’u’llah, and that when

they took to an ideal it was whole-heartedly.75 He wrote to Shoghi Effendi76 for

permission, but was told his work would be better suited for Austria than Germany.

         However, shortly before his departure, Fred became seriously ill. A few months

later, on June 13th, at 6:10 p.m., Fred passed away as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage.

Despite his illness, Fred spent his last moments teaching the faith of Baha’u’llah. His

daughter, Kathryn, writes: “. . . on the very eve before his death he spent his last time

teaching the Faith of Baha’u’llah. His devotion cannot be measured in mere words.

Abdu’l-Baha truly named him well when he said, ‘My Son.’”77

         Upon hearing of Fred’s death, Shoghi Effendi sent a cable to his family: “Grieve

passing beloved Fred. Welcome assured in Abha Kingdom by Master. Praying progress

his soul. His name is forever inscribed Baha’i history.” Fred was buried in Cedar Park

Cemetery in Chicago. As he requested, his autobiographical account “When a Soul Meets

the Master,” was read at the memorial services.78

        Fred Mortensen’s background was that of a rogue and thief. Fred was not an

advantaged person, and as such would not be a likely candidate to understand, let alone

embrace, a new religion. He lived his beliefs without benefit of wealth or education,

much like his mentor, Abdu’l-Baha. He was so moved by his exposure to Baha’i

teachings that the direction of his life changed instantly. The facts suggest a

metamorphosis on a level other than scholarly.

        Fred’s story is well known in Baha’i history. The documentation is the result of

his example of faith in action, not of his material accomplishments. Fred perceived a truth

more impressive than that of his grinding poverty, more real than his material needs, and

more important than his immediate gratification. He is an example of one who learned

that material things are transient, while inspiration and faith survive. Such is the power of

faith to change a life.
