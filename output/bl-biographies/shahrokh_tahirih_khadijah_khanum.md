303 '
Tahirih was born in 1817, the same year that Baha'u'llah was born.

Her given name was Fatimih, but she was rarely called by that name.
She was called Ummay-Salmay. Later she was called Zarrin-Taj which
means the Golden Crown. As we see in the course of history, when
she corresponded with Siyyid Kazim, he addressed her as Qurratu'l-
Ayn which means 'Solace of the Eye.' Later in Badasht, Baha'u'llah
bestowed upon her the title of Tahirih which meansthe 'Pure One.'

Abdu'l-Baha placed her station in the level of Sarah, the Virgin
Mary and Fatimih. Western literature called her the Persian Joan
of Arc, a prodigy of science as well as beauty.

Professor Edward G. Browne, the orientalist from England, said
the appearance of a heroine such as Tahirih in that time in Iran
was not only a prodigy, but rather a miracle, and if the Babi Faith
did not have any other claim to greatness, producing a heroine
like Tahirih would have been sufficient. The mother of the
president of Austria said, "I shall do for the women of Austria
what Tahirih gave her life to do for the women of Persia."

She was born in the city of Qazvin which took pride in that it
had more than one hundred of the most learned clergy within its
gates. She was born to a very wealthy and learned family. Her
father, Haji Mulla Salih, was not only a very high-positioned
clergyman, but also was very wealthy. As a matter of fact, he

gave to her as a gift a village which she called Behjat-Abad which
means the abode of happiness. The father had one older brother,
Mulla Muhammad-Taqi. We shall refer to him as Taqi. He was a bitter
enemy of Siyyid Kazim and -      - Ahmad, the two luminaries who

Shaykh
came before the appearance of the Bab. He was also an enemy of
the Bab. The father had one younger brother whose name was Mulla

Ali who was very friendly toward Tahirih and later he became a
Babi.
At age thirteen, the parents married her to her cousin, the son
of Mulla Taqi. The husband's name was Mulla Muhammad. As you
know, the marriages in that culture were pre-arranged, and cousins
would marry each other. She had three children from that marriage,
two sons and one daughter. None of them became Babis or believers.
After her martyrdom, all of them ran away from the house because
the father was ill-treating them. The daughter at the age of
twenty-two died, one year after the martyrdom of Tahirih.

Tahiriah received her education through attending the courses given
by her father and her uncle. Many times in lectures, attended
by about two hundred students, she would be attending, but being
female she would sit behind curtains. It was not unusual for her
to voice her disagreement with her father or her uncle by bringing
convincing proofs. Soon she became known among the students as
a very learned person. As a matter of fact, her older brother,
who later succeeded the father, said that the boys of the family
never dared to talk when Tahirih was present because she could
easily discover their mistakes and would make them realize their
weakness.    They   preferred silence in her presence.           She
out-distanced her brothers in progress, but being a woman she was
not given any degree and had no place in the ecclesiastic hierarchy.
So many times her father stated how he wished she were a boy who
could succeed him and bring more prestige to the family.

One day in the library of her cousin she discovered some books
written by -    - Ahmad and Siyyid Kazim. After reading a few

Shaykh
pages she became highly interested in these books and asked the
cousin if she could borrow them to take them home for studying.
The cousin, of course, refused to do so and he said that these
books were written by very progressive thinkers, -   - Ahmad and

Shaykh
Siyyid Kazim whose doctrines and tenets are highly opposed by her

father and uncle. Their doctrines being, one, that the resurrection
is not that of rising of the body, but spiritual in nature; the
second doctrine, that the Promised One, the Qa'im, would be born
of a mother, and he would not be coming out of one thousand years
of hiding as Muslims believed and expected. And also that the
appearance of the Qa'im was near. The third doctrine was that
God shall continue to send educators to mankind. This was somewhat
different from what Muslims believed; that Muhammad was the Seal
of the Prophets and after Him no other Messenger of God would
appear. Well, after arguing with the cousin, she won and he gave
her the book.

Even though she was married, she spent most of her time at home.
She was very close to her mother, and would spend long hours in
her father's library. When her father noticed that she was reading
the writings of -    - Ahmad and Siyyid Kazim they had many heated

Shaykh
arguments and he raised violent objection toward her doing this.

She started a correspondence with Siyyid Kazim, but, as we know,
- - Ahmad was no longer living at that time. The first letter
she wrote to Siyyid Kazim was when he was teaching in Karbila,
the holy city of Islam, which has the largest theological schools.
She wrote a letter of apology and supported the cause and the
thoughts of -     - Ahmad, the previous teacher. Siyyid Kazim
replied to her, addressing her, "Ya Qurratu ' 1-Ayn-i-Va Ruhu l-
Fu'adi." That means '0 Solace of My Eyes and the Joy of My Heart. '
From then on she was called Qurratu'l-Ayn because that was the
name that Siyyid Kazim called her in the letter.             Their
correspondence was done through her Uncle Ali. At that time women
were quite restricted.

As the opposition of the father and the uncle became more, she
pretended that she was going to Karbila and Najaf, the two holy
cities, for pilgrimage. This was quite pleasing to the family.
They thought she would become more religious and would start to
forget about her thoughts on the doctrines of -      - Ahmad and
Siyyid Kazim. With the help of her Uncle Ali, she and her sister,
Marzieh, and Uncle Ali went to Karbila. Unfortunately, she arrived
ten days too late. Siyyid Kazim had already died on December 31,
1843, the year before the Declaration of the Bab. So she became
the guest of Siyyid Kazim's wife and stayed with her for the next

three years. She joined the company of those students of Siyyid
Kazim who remained. The rest had dispersed to find the Qa'im.

Soon she became known in Karbila for her knowledge and ability
to debate and convince even the best of the clergy. She had the
whole library in her head and quoted pages of books without mistake
to support her reasons. She was eagerly expecting the coming of
the Promised One, but, being a woman, she had restrictions on
traveling. She prayed and meditated constantly until one night
in a dream she saw a young Siyyid,wearing a black cloak and green
turban, appearing in heaven. This means he was suspended in the
air, reciting certain verses, one of which she wrote down in her
book. She woke up exhilarated and wrote the verse down.

As soon as she heard about the intended departure of her sister
Marzieh's husband, Muhammad-'Ali, from Karbila to go in search
of the Qa'im, she sent a message to him. The message said she
was sure that he would meet the Promised One in the course of his
journey. She said, "When you meet Him,on my behalf tell him, 'The
effulgence of Thy face flashed forth, and the rays of Thy visage
arose high; then speak the word, Am I not your Lord?     Thou art,
thou art', we will all reply." She also gave him a sealed letter
to deliver to the Qa'im.     Muhammad-'Ali eventually met the Bab
in airaz, and when the Bab received her letter and heard the
poetry, He accepted her as a Letter of the Living. She was the
only woman, the seventeenth Letter of the Living, right before
the last one, Quddus. This was about August in 1844.

Not long after she heard about having been accepted, Mulla Ali-
i-Bastami, the fourth Letter of the Living, arrived in Karbila.
He was the first Babi who was martyred. She saw a copy of
Ahsanu'l-Qisas (The Best of Stories) which is also known as
Qayyumu'l-Asma, or the commentary on Surih of Joseph. It has one
hundred eleven chapters, the first of which was revealed to Mulla
Husayn on the night of the Declaration of the Bab.  To her intense
delight, she discovered that the same verse that she had heard
in her dream was in that manuscript.     Later she translated into
Persian the whole Qayyumu'l-Asma which was in Arabic.     Now with
her immovable conviction and bewitching eloquence, she began to
teach the new Faith.    She converted the wife of Siyyid Kazim.
Her active teaching caused a turmoil, but the shock came when she

was found to not put on her mourning attire at the beginning of
the mourning month of Muharram which coincides with the martyrdom
of Imam Husayn, but instead, with her sister, put on festive attire,
and celebrated the birth of the Bab which is the first day of that
month.

Now she has been in Karbila for three years when a delegation of
Shi'ih, Sunni, Christian and Jewish came and tried to dissuade
her from speaking the new Message in the center of Islam, but her
reasoning and force of argument confounded them. So they complained
to the authorities in Karbila who for three months put her house
under surveillance, so that no one could come or go until they
could hear what to do from the governor in Ba&dad.     When no word
came, she told the authorities that she and a few companions would
leave for Ba&dad.    This coincided with the time when the Bab was
instructing the believers to go towards Khurasan. She was stoned
as she left Karbila. Among her companions were the mother and
sister of Mulla Husayn.

In Ba&dad  she was the guest of the grandfather of Dr. Zia Baadadi,
who in the early 20th century, was a great Baha'i teacher in
Chicago. She lectured from behind the curtain. Soon her students
from Karbila moved there and added to her audience. Here she
challenged the clergy, through the governor, to come for a public
debate about their questions of her ideas.     Of course, they knew
better and did not accept, but became upset and asked the governor
to transfer her and the other ladies to the house of the Mufti
(the canon) of Baadad. This was in 1847.

She spent three months there. The Mufti soon was captivated.
He saw a dream that the Shi'ih ulama came to the Shrine of Imam
Husayn and opened the          so the body was visible. When they
wanted to take it out, the Mufti threw himself on it. He asked
Tahirih to interpret this dream.     He told her that he shared her
belief, but was afraid of the sword of the Sultan. It was there
where Dr. Lutfullah Hakim's grandfather, a physician to Muhammad
Shah, was on pilgrimage, and heard about Tahirih's lectures and
with curiosity attended a few lectures, accepted its truth and
taught large number of Jews in Persia.

Tahirih fasted frequently in those days.    One day a message came

from the capital (Istanbul) that Tahirih was free, but must leave
the country. She was about thirty years old. With about thirty
people, Arab and Persian believers, she left Ba&dad    for Ganiqayn
which is at the border of Persia. Dr. Ba&dadils     grandfather paid
for all of their expenses and accompanied her.      Upon their entry
back to Iran, in the small town of Karand, her eloquence and charm
impressed the chiefs of that area who offered to place 12,000 armed
men under her command to follow her wherever she went. She blessed
them and said to stay at their homes.             The people were
Aliyu'llahis, a sect of Islam who equate Ali with God. Five years
later, in the heart of winter, when Baha'u'llah was on His way
to exile in Ba&dad, He received a very warm hospitality there.
In the next city of Kermanshah,   she had an enthusiastic reception
and interview with princes, ulama, and government officials. She
had the Bab's commentary of the Surih of Kawthar, which had been
revealed by the Bab for Vahid, translated and read in public.
The governor and his family became believers. She challenged the
chief clergy to debate. People became anxious about it which upset
the clergy even more. He could not directly agitate the people
to kill her because of his fear of the governor, but he sent a
message to Tahirih's father asking him to send relatives to remove
her. Four ruffians from her hometown came, and with the help of
a local officer attacked her companion's place, beat the people
and looted their property. The governor caught them and restored
the property. In the town of Sahnih she and her companions stayed
two days in that village. Here, chiefs of tribes went in advance,
and welcomed her and her companions.

In the city of Hamadan, she stayed two months. Again, the governor
and notables came and visited her. However, one of the leading
ulama became very opposed to her, but again his hands were tied
because of fear of the governor. Upon hearing of his evil attitude,
she sent him a long letter explaining the Faith of the Bab.     She
sent it with a believer who arrived when this clergy had other
clergymen at his house discussing how to handle Tahirih. The
messenger was like a red flag to a bull.    They fell upon him and
beat him until he was unconscious. When his body was returned
to Tahirih, she was with a few princesses who feared her grief
over this, but were astonished at her composure. She went to him
and said, "Mulla Ibrahim, peace upon you that you have suffered

in the path of your beloved." He opened his eyes, and asked what
he could do next. It was not too long after this, that he shed
his blood in the path of the Bab.

Tahirih was planning to go to Tehran to try to meet Muhammad Shah,
and tell him about the teachings of the Bab, but under instruction
from her father, her two brothers arrived in Hamadan to welcome
her back to Qazvin, urging her to return home. This trip took
one week and was in very bad weather.     She reluctantly consented,
but told most of the companions to return to their homes. With
her were her sister's husband, the Letter of the Living, and a
young man engaged to her daughter, Mulla Ibrahim, and -   - Salih.

Now back in Qazvin, she went to her father's home and the two Babis
stayed in a caravanserai. The first night of her arrival, there
was a family council of the father, Uncle Taqi, and her husband.
After a heated argument and the men insulting everything and
everyone she believed in, Uncle Taqi, in a rage, struck her several
times. She said the fatal words, "0 uncle, I see your mouth fill
with blood." The next day her husband sent a few ladies to ask
her to go to his house.    She said, "It has been three years since
our separation. Had you shown any interest and followed me to
Karbila, surely I could have awakened you. I have cast you out
of my life forever." Her father tried to reconcile them but got
nowhere. A few weeks later, he divorced her.

During the first few days, she used to go to her sister's home
who was a believer.      There, Tahirih would meet the wives of
prominent people who were anxious to savor every word. Her brother-
in-law, the Letter of the Living, was later martyred at the fortress
of -   - Tabarsi.

At this time a man from Ziraz, an admirer of -        - Ahmad and
Siyyid Kazim, was passing through Qazvin.      He was not a Babi,
but was on his way to the fortress of Mah-Ku to investigate the
faith of the Bab. This was in the latter part of 1847. When he
arrived, he saw in the marketplace that a man, barefoot, with his
turban tied around his neck, was being dragged while onlookers
were pelting and cursing him. He inquired about his guilt and
was told that he publicly praised -    - Ahmad and Siyyid Kazim,
and that the clergy, Tahirih's uncle Taqi, pronounced him a heretic

and decreed his expulsion from town. In his amazement, he went
to Taqi's school, and found Taqi openly insulting the memory of
- - Ahmad and Siyyid Kazim. He wanted to punch him in the mouth
in front of everyone, but kept his peace and instead went and bought
a dagger and waited for the right opportunity.

Learning that Taqi was the ham-~u4ih who led the mass prayer on
Friday, and usually went at dawn to the mosque to say his private
prayer, he went on Thursday night, and hid in the mosque. At dawn
when Taqi came and prayed, he stabbed him in the mouth and vitals
and escaped. As soon as Taqi's son saw his father dead, with blood
in his mouth, Tahirih became the prime suspect masterminding the
assassination. Many Babis were arrested, but Tahirih's father
would not let them take her out of his house. Upon the insistence
of her ex-husband, she and her maid were taken for interrogation.
She denied having had any part in it. To put psychological pressure
on her, branding with hot irons was ordered, and they pushed the
hands of her maid under a sliding door for branding. Tahirih felt
desperate so she faced Mah-Ku and implored the Bab. All of a
sudden, shouts were heard that the assassin was found. The man
from Ziraz, seeing so many innocent people being arrested, made
a deal with authorities that they should release all the innocent
if with proof he would give them the murderer. When they promised,
he said it was himself, and explained the whole story. This
admission was in front of the judge and the ex-husband, the son
of Taqi, who did not accept the story.        The murderer said, "I
hid the dagger under a certain bridge." When it was found, they
arrested him, but did not keep their promise to release the rest.

He and four Babis were sent to Tehran.       -   - Salih, the Arab
companion, was martyred upon arrival in Tehran. He was the first
to shed his blood on Persian soil; 20,000 followed.              When
Baha'u'llah heard about a few Babis in jail He visited them, and
gave them some money. Everyone heard about it. The murderer saw
that they did not keep their promise to release others, so at night
he escaped, and went to the home of Rida Khan-i-Sardar, a Babi
who was an officer in the Royal Army.    He stayed hidden, but later
went to Fort -     - Tabarsi and was martyred.

Shaykh                                Baha'u'llah was
accused by the ex-husband of Tahirih of helping the murderer to
escape, and was put in the same prison for a few days.       They did
not know that he was masterminding the rescue of Tahirih.

Through intrugues of the ex-husband, who now had replaced his father
as the Imam-Jum'ih (prayer leader), the three innocent Babis were
returned and martyred in Qazvin. This emboldened the ex-husband
who now was going after Tahirih herself. Tahirih, through her
intuition sensed the forthcoming rescue, wrote him a letter stating
the futility of his efforts, and declared, "My God will rescue
me from your clutches within nine days. If not, you can do with
me whatever you wish."    He was hesitant to show this letter to
others and to accept such a bold challenge, but some heard about
it.

The evening of the day when Taqi was murdered, a Babi, Muhammad
Hadi Farhadi, left Qazvin for Tehran and attained the presence
of Baha'u'llah, giving news of the events. Later he was summoned
by Baha'u'llah and instructed to return to Qazvin and rescue
Tahirih, as planned by Baha'u'llah.   He was given a sealed letter
from Baha'u'llah that he should deliver to Tahirih through his
wife gatun-Jan. She should go in disguise of a beggar and wait
at the entrance of Tahirih's house.    No one was allowed to enter
Tahirih's home. The letter was delivered, and shortly Tahirih came
out, and followed her to a carpenter's house which no one suspected
as her hiding place. At night when the city gates were closed,
they went over the wall and reached a slaughter house outside the
town where, under the direction of Baha'u'llah, an attendant with
three horses was ready. They did not take the usual road to Tehran
and eventually safely reached Baha'u'llah's home. This sudden
disappearance proved the supernatural power of the Faith, and her
older brother the same day acknowledged the truth of the Faith,
but did not follow it.

Tahirih, by the same intuition that caused her to recognize the
Bab, also recognized the station of Baha'u'llah.      For the next
five or six months she was the guest of Baha'u'llah. She was very
fond of Abdu'l-Baha, who was only four years old.      One day she
was with Abdu'l-Baha when the famous and erudite Vahid came to
visit her. He waited a long time and friends said, "Shouldn't
you leave the child and go and visit Vahid?"        She looked at
Abdu'l-Baha and said, "Shall I leave thee, the Protector of the
Cause, for seeing one of the followers of the Cause?" No one
understood her.    Abdu'l-Baha relates that once he was sitting
on Tahirih's lap while she was conversing with Vahid through a

curtain. Men and women in that culture visited with a curtain
separating them. Vahid was reciting and elaborating on some Islamic
traditions. She interrupted him by saying, "Oh Yahya! (which was
his given name.) Today is not the time for reciting the traditions.
Bring forth an act if you have the knowledge." And we saw how
valiantly he gave his life in the struggle of Nayriz.

Tahirih, who had never seen the Bab, wanted to go to Mah-Ku, but
Baha'u'llah advised her that it was impossible.     As we recall,
in the early part of April 1848 after spending Naw-Ruz with Mulla
Husayn, the Bab was transferred from Mah-Ku to mihriq.      It is
very possible that Mulla Husayn and Tahirih met in the house of
Baha'u'llah while Mulla Husayn was on his way to Mah-Ku, or on
his return when he again went through Tehran.

In about May or June 1848, Baha'u'llah advised Mirza Musa, His
brother, to take Tahirih secretly through the city gate as enemies
were still looking for her, and head for Eurasan where Quddus
and Mulla Husayn were. This was done successfully. After about
seven miles they reached an orchard at the foot of the mountains
with a vacant building. The caretaker accepted to let Tahirih
and her maid use it and guarded them.       Mirza Musa returned to
Baha'u'llah who said that a house was providentially prepared for
her reception. She stayed there seven days.

Baha'u'llah instructed Mirza Musa to make arrangements for His
own departure for Khurasan, and headed for %ah-rud   where Tahirih
joined Him. Both started for Badaht. Badasht was a summer resort
full of gardens for the nobility. Quddus joFned them there. Many
believers, at the bidding of the Bab, were at Badasht waiting to
join Baha'u'llah on His intended trip to ~ h u r a s a c Eighty-one
believers were the guests of Baha'u'llah, whorented three gardens
for Tahirih, Quddus, and Himself. That conference lasted twenty-
two days, and every day Baha'u'llah revealed a tablet. Also, He
conferred new titles on everyone, such as Tahirih, Quddus, and
for Himself, Baha.

Here was where Tahirih came out without the veil over her face,
with Quddus having his sword ready for the fatal blow, and poor
Abdu'l-Khaliq so shaken that he cut his own throat and left the
company with a few others. Tahirih's appearance was like a thunder-

bolt. She kept her serenity, and with an eloquent and matchless
speech said, "I am the 'Blast of the Trumpet. ' I am the 'Call of
the Bugle.'    I am the 'Word' which the Qa'im is to utter, the
Word which shall put to flight the chiefs a~ld nobles of the earth.
This day is the day on which the fetters of the past are burst
asunder." She concluded her speech with a verse from the Qur'an,
"Verily, amid gardens and rivers shall the pious dwell in the seat
of truth in the presence of the potent King.''       She glanced at
Baha'u'llah and Quddus, not clearly revealing Baha'u'llah.

The followers were divided between Quddus and Tahirih, the
eighteenth and seventeenth Letters of the Living, who on a few
occasions denounced each other, but Baha'u'llah masterly healed
the wound and brought reconciliation. Her insight was owed to
her months of staying close to Baha'u'llah.

On those days the Bab was brought from the prison-fortress of
Chihriq to Tabriz for examination, and for the first time He said
-
He was the Qa'im which meant the abrogation of Islamic laws and
traditions. The same purpose was achieved at a distance at Badaat
under the direction of Baha'u'llah.     You see, the Persian Bayan
was just completed by the Bab, and new laws revealed, so the old
were abrogated. When after the conference a few rigid followers
reported to the Bab about Tahirih's poor discretion in showing
her face, and not respecting the established Islamic traditions,
He replied, "What am I to say regarding her whom the Tongue of
Power and Glory names Tahirih (meaning the Pure One)?"

At the end of the conference, Quddus and Tahirih shared the same
howdah (a covered couch mounted on a pack-animal).     Baha'u'llah
and the rest of the companions all headed towards Niyala which
is near Mazindaran. In the early dawn they woke up by stones being
hurled at them. Most of the followers fled and joined Mulla Husayn
on the way to -      - Tabarsi. Baha'u'llah put His garment on
Quddus, and sent him to a safe place, and put the only other man
remaining, who had drawn his sword, to protect Tahirih.
Baha'u'llah negotiated with the inhabitants who gave them back
some of their looted property. Baha'u'llah and Tahirih headed
towards Nur, Baha'u'llah's hometown. The attack in Niyala occurred
in mid-July 1848, and, as we remember, it was about July 21 when
Mulla Husayn and two hundred two believers left Mashhad    heading
towards Manzindaran and ended in -   - Tabarsi.

for one of his low-life servants who had been demoted to the lowest
job. This evil-looking man came, and the Sardar made him drunk
and gave him the scarf. As this servant approached Tahirih he
quickly wrapped the scarf around her neck and killed her. Then,
as she requested, her body was lowered into a well and covered
with stones and dirt." The kalantar's wife stated, "Three days
later, as foretold by Tahirih, a woman came and took the package."

Nine years later the kalantar, by the order of the king, was
strangulated by twisting a rope around his neck, and his body was
hung in a thoroughfare for the public to view.       This was the
lamentation which Tahirih was alluding to when talking to the wife
of the kalantar - remember, she told her, "Do not weep. The time
of your lamentation has not yet come."

This was the power of intuition of Tahirih which enabled her not
only to recognize the Bab without ever seeing Him, but also to
recognize Baha'u'llah's   station well before His receiving His

- of Tehran.

Mission in the Siyah-Chal

In that stormy month of August in 1852, in the dead of night they
strangulated the beautiful and talented poetess of Qazvin and cast
her body, clad in a wedding dress, into a pit without a trace.
She was thirty-six years old. Her career was as dazzling as it
was brief, and as tragic as it was eventful. What other woman
except Tahirih in those days had the courage, erudition, and
eloquence to address and confound the ulama at the center of Islam
who ranked women slightly higher than animal, and considered them
not even having a soul.

At her final hours she told them, "You can kill me as soon as you
wish, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women." How true!
Unlike her fellow-disciples, her fame spread far and wide in the
capitals of western Europe. Her sacrifices and influence mean
more to women that of Joan of Arc. Her admirers are many throughout
the continents. They are eager to know more about her, memorize
her poetry, or set them to music, but more than all, to emulate
her. May the future historians do justice to her accomplishments
and influence.

Some of her poetry has been translated. Many of her heart-touching

odes are recited by her fanatic countrymen of today without knowing
who is the composer and not realizing that the Lord mentioned in
those lines signify no one else but Baha'u'llah. Indeed, the title
of Zarrin-Taj , or Crown of Gold, was below the station of this
immortal heroine whom history will remember as Tahirih, the title
conferred upon her by the Blessed Beauty.
Let us rejoice in that her longing for eternal reunion with the
object of her love, whom she never met in her lifetime, was finally
fulfilled.

three years old. When Khadijih Bagum matched the dream and what
was happening, she became quite elated. With the respect that
everyone in the family gave to the Bab, she felt quite proud of
her coming marriage.

Some two months later the marriage took place in Uncle Ali's house,
and the ceremony was officiated by the Imam-Jum'ih -   - Abu Turab,
who later we find was the hand of providence for the protection
of the Bab. This was about August of 1842, and they lived in the
Bab's own house with His mother and two black servants, Mubarak
and Fiddih. The great joy of those days was beyond words, but
not long after her marriage she had a frightening dream.

One night she saw in her dream a fearsome lion standing in their
courtyard, and she had her arms around the lion's neck.    The lion
dragged her two and a half times around the perimeter of the court-
yard when she woke up. Trembling with fright, she told the Bab
about her dream, and He told her it meant that their life together
would not last more than two and a half years, which made her quite
distressed, but He comforted her, and said she should accept any
adversity in the path of God.

Before long it was realized that she was pregnant, and when the
due date came, she had a very long and hard labor. When the Bab's
mother went to Him and said Khadijih Bagum was at the point of
death, He took a mirror that was close to Him and wrote a prayer
on it, and told His mother to hold the mirror in front of His wife.
That was done and the child was delivered, but the baby's life
was very short, possibly stillborn. The Bab's mother was quite
sad and angry. She told the Bab that if He had such powers, why
didn't He make any attempt to save the life of His son and spare
them so much grief.   He smiled and replied that He was not destined
to have any child. This made her even more upset, but He said
no more. The child was named Ahmad and in Qayyumu'l-Asma, the
Bab's mighty book, the Bab speaks of Ahmad and states that he is
in paradise with Fatimih. He was buried at the foot of a cypress
tree in Bibidukhtaran.

During those days the Bab did not have a definite occupation.
He did lots of writing, and any time company would come He would
cover His papers with a cloth.  At times He used to go to Uncle

Ali's trading house, and some afternoons He would go for a walk
in the fields outside the city and come home at sunset.

One day in the afternoon He came home earlier than usual, and said
that this night He had a particular task to attend, and asked that
the dinner be served earlier. Fiddih, the maid-servant, did so,
and after supper, He retired for the night. An hour later when
the house was quiet, He rose from His bed and left the room. This
event was sometime before His Declaration.

"At first it did not alarm me," she recounted, "but when it went
more than an hour, I became concerned and went to look for Him.
He was nowhere to be found." She continued, "I checked the house
door and it was locked from inside, and as I walked on the western
side of the courtyard I saw that the upper chamber was well-lighted.
This surprised me because He never went into that room at that
time of the night unless He had guests, and He would usually tell
me when a guest was expected. With great trepidation, I climbed
the steps and there I saw Him standing with His hands raised towards
heaven, and chanting prayers in the most melodious voice and tears
streaming from His eyes. His face was so luminous as if rays of
light were radiating from it. He looked so majestic. Fear seized
me, and I was transfixed on the spot, trembling uncontrollably.
I could not go forward or backward.      He made a gesture with His
hands for me to go back. I returned to my bed and could not fall
asleep, and in those short bouts of sleep, I would see that scene
in the upper chamber. I kept asking myself what grave event had
happpened to evoke tears and supplications of such intensity.
Then I heard the call of the muezzin for dawn prayer."
(1

As usual, breakfast was served in His mother's room, and I saw
Him going there. I went to that room, but His mother was not there.
As soon as I laid my eyes upon His face, the majesty of the night
before appeared to me and I began to tremble.       He asked me to
sit and gave me what was left of the tea in His cup.   His kindness
gave me strength and courage. He asked what was troubling me,
and I boldly told Him, 'It is the change in you. We grew up
together and have been married for nearly two years, and now I
see a different person in you. You have been transformed!' He
smiled and said, 'Although I did not wish for you to see me in
that state, God had ordained otherwise. He wished you to see me

and had not even a chance to say farewell. The mad governor who
had left the city to escape cholera, under pressure from the police
chief, gave his approval for the release of the Bab. The Bab left
for Isfahan, but they did not know it.

Khadijih  Bagum relates, "At that time we moved to Uncle Ali's
house, and hoped to hear some news about the Bab. The frustrated
governor sent attendants to our house to find Him, but we had no
idea of His whereabouts. Then the attendants went to arrest Mirza
Abul-Qasim, my brother, who was ill in bed, and carried him on
their shoulders to the governor's house.     After severe verbal
abuse and beating he was told to produce the Bab within two weeks
or pay a fine of 15,000 tumans, a substantial sum.   They brought
him back on their shoulders and dumped him on the hard ground of
the courtyard.

With the beating he received his eyes were swollen shut with severe
pain, and tears streamed from them constantly.       After fifteen
days the attendants came again and took him away to the governor's
house. While this evil man was demanding 15,000 tumans from him,
a letter came from the governor of Isfahan, Manuchihr m a n , stating
that the Bab was his honored guest, and no member of His family
should be abused or harrassed in any way.      Thereupon, the fine
was reduced to 1,500 tumans.

After the departure of the Bab for Isfahan, the family was in great
distress, and day-to-day expected new abuse, particularly by the
frustrated governor. If it was not verbal or physical, it was
psychological abuse. The people of Shiraz were warned by the criers
that if a single page of the writings of the Bab was found in their
possession they would be severely punished. In their panic to
escape the wrath of the merciless governor, people dashed to the
house of Mirza Abu'l-Qasim with bundles of writings of the Bab,
all written by His own hand, threw them into the courtyard, and
dashed away hoping no one had seen them with the incriminating
material. Siyyid Ali, the uncle of the Bab, advised the family
to wash away the ink and bury the paper.

What a deprivation for mankind! Don't you wish that you could
have even a single word in His own handwriting! I guess it had
to happen that way. You see, this was not the only time that large

number of the Bab's writings were destroyed. While in Mah-Ku He
revealed nine complete and separate commentaries on the whole Qur'an
which were sent to a believer in Tabriz for safekeeping, but their
whereabouts are not known. The Bab has comforted us by stating
in the Bayan that a thousand perusals of His book, the Bayan, does
not equal perusal of a single verse revealed by Baha'u'llah, and
we have 15,000 written documents of Baha'u'llah all preserved in
the Archives at the World Center.

Khadijih Bagum states that her brother, Siyyid Hasan, who later
became a Baha'i with the title of Afnan-i-Kabir from Baha'u'llah,
was in Isfahan but did not write a single line about the Bab.
At times he was hostile towards the Bab. A few times they received
a letter from the Bab, Himself. Months before His leaving for
Isfahan, the Bab had changed the title of His house to the name
of His mother and wife, and also gave the prayer of Remover of
Difficulties to His wife, so that any time she became grief-
stricken, she should chant it, and He would appear in her dream
and comfort her.

Later on Uncle Ali left for Yazd. His son, Javad, and the son
of another uncle of the Bab often came to visit and help Khadijih
Bagum and the mother of the Bab.    Then fragmentary             news
came that the Bab was transferred to Tehran, and then to the
mountains of AGirbayjan. The Bab's mother appealed to her brother,
Siyyid Ali who was a Babi, to do something about the Bab's hard-
ship. That is the time when he closed his business, left for the
prison-fortress of Bihriq where the Bab was kept, and ended in
Tehran where he met a martyr's death by being brutally beheaded.

The news of the martyrdom of Uncle Ali and later of the Bab in
1850 was kept from the women of the household.     Rumors of this
were severely denied by the men until Mirza Abu'l-Qasim, brother
of Khadijih Bagum, found it very difficult to stay in Shiraz so
he took Uncle Ali's eighteen-year-old and only son with him on
a pilgrimage to Mecca. On the way back Javad fell ill and died
in Jiddih. The uncle went alone to visit the shrines of Karbila

.

and Najaf It was more than a year after the martyrdom of the Bab
when Mirza Abu'l-Qasim returned home with the sad news of Javad's
death and of the martyrdom of Javad's father and the Bab. They
mourned for all three of them.

The mother of the Bab, who could no longer tolerate the grief and
particularly the tongue-lashing of a brother-in-law, took off for
Karbila. She was not a believer until Baha'u'llah, a decade later
from Ba&dad,   sent some believers who knew her to see her, and
she became a Baha'i before her death and recognized the station
of her Son.

Khadijih Bagum lived with her sister, the wife of Uncle Ali, who
needed more comforting having lost both her husband and only son
within one year. The news of the martyrdom of the Bab and Uncle

Ali were kept from the servant Fiddih. She was told they had
gone to Bombay for trading. When later Baha'u'llah ordered the
repair of the House of the Bab so -

Khadijih Bagum could go to live
there again, Fiddih was overjoyed, stating that the Master must
be on His way back as the reason for the house being repaired.

Years passed and in her story Khadijih Bagum stated, "My sister's
son, Aqa Mirza Aqa, whom I had-converted,  grew up and wrote for
me to Baha'u'llah in Ba&dad,   and I was honored with an answer
from the Blessed Beauty.     Then it happened that Nabil, the
historian, came to Shiraz, announcing that Baha'u'llah was the
One promised by the Tab. As soon as I heard this I experienced
the same feeling as I had in the upper room before the Bab's
Declaration.   I prostrated and offered my total submission and
dedication to Baha'u'llah."
I'

The years went by and a letter came from my brother in Isfahan
who now was a Baha'i.    Baha'u'llah gave him the title of Afnan-
i-Kabir.   The letter stated that -       - Salman, the celebrated
courier of Baha'u'llah who had come to Shiraz many times with
tablets and gifts from Baha'u'llah, was o n h i s way to Akka and
was also taking Munirih Khanum and her brother to attain the
presence of Baha'u'llah i n ~ k k a . On their way they stayed with
me for two weeks. My nephew, Ali, was also visiting. Those were
my happiest days since the Bab was taken from me."

Munirih -Khanum, who became the wife of Abdu'l-Baha, took three
requests from Khadijih Bagum to Baha'u'llah.      One was that the
Bab's house beyepaired so she could live there again. Second,
was to ask for the hand of Baha'u'llah's daughter, Furuqiyih Khanum,
in marriage for her nephew, Ali, and lastly, to have

to attain the presence of Baha'u'llah.     Baha'u'llah granted all
three of her wishes.

The nephew, Ali, had promised Badijih Bagum that if he was
accepted as Baha'u'llah's son-in-law he would take her with him
to Akka.   However, that fickle man made excuses and broke his
promise, going alone to Akka. This broke the heart of madijih
Bagum who knew that it had been her last chance to go to the
presence of Baha'u'llah.  She became ill and two months later on
September 15, 1882, passed away, forty years after her marriage
to the Bab. Her faithful maid, Fiddih, died two hours later.

Khadijih Bagum was honored by Baha'u'llah with a tablet in which
He stated that, because of her, all who died on the day of her
death were forgiven. She was buried that night within the Shrine
of Shah-Chiraq, an Islamic shrine, with the help of the caretaker
of that shrine who was a Baha'i.

Friends, the words tragic and sad fail to express the agonies
suffered by Khadijih Bagum. How grateful we shold be for her being
a part of our glorious history.       In that short span of their
marriage she brought joy and comfort to the Bab.       She converted
her nephew on whom Baha'u'llah conferred the title of Nuru'd-Din,
and later honored him with the Tablet of the World, or Lawh-i-Dunya.

Of her precious legacies, the greatest is Shoghi Effendi, being
the great-grandson of her illustrious brother, Mirza Abu'l-Qasim.
Also the late Hand of the Cause H. M. Balyuzi was a second cousin
of Shoghi Effendi, both Afnan from the same brother. How could
we end her story without appreciating the potent prayer, "Is there
any Remover of Difficulties  ..." which the Blessed Bab revealed
for her agonies, and now the world has the opportunity and bounty
to supplicate through it.
