Translator's Notes
Dr. Riaz Ghadimi, was a General of the Army, a doctor of
medicine, an indefatigable teacher of the Bahá’í Faith and one of
the most noted contemporary scholars and authors of the Faith
of Bahá’u’lláh. He wrote on Islam and Christianity and
produced a multitude of works on the Bahá’í Faith. His
monumental multi­volume Arabic/Persian dictionary, Riaz’u’l­
Lughát (Heaven of Words), is a unique accomplishment of great
value for future scholars and researchers in gaining a deeper
understanding of the meaning and application of various words
used in the Bahá’í scriptures.

On the night of 8 July 1984, Dr. Ghadimi delivered a two­
hour lecture on the subject of “The Báb, the King of the
Messengers” in Toronto, Canada. Hard copies of the
presentation were later sold to those interested in the audience
with all revenues going to the local Bahá’í Fund. In 1987 he
revised and expanded the work into a small book. Some 6 years
later, in 1993, he re­published the second revision of the work,
which is the basis of the present translation.

Alláh’u’Abhá
This treatise is not a book of history. It is the text of an
address about the greatness of the revelation of the Báb. Part 1
covers highlights of the events and themes related to the life of
the blessed Báb and also deals with the torment and suffering
that afflicted that holy Being and the companions of that
Manifestation of God. As well it describes the miserable and
ignominious fate of the perpetrators of such deeds. Part 2
discusses the preeminence of the religion of the Bayán, the
frequent and explicit references to the revelation of Bahá’u’lláh,
the martyrdom of the Bayán’s Author, as well as unnumbered
believers of that precious revelation, and the loving sacrifice of
the enormous power and influence of that supreme theophany
in the path of the Blessed Beauty, Bahá’u’lláh.

– Part 1 –

At the break of dawn from sorrows I was saved

In the dark night of the Soul, drank the elixir I craved
Ecstatic, my soul was radiant, bright,

Sanctified cup of my life, drunk I behaved
O, what exalted sunrise, what glorious night,

That holy night, to the New Life I was enslaved
From now on in the mirror, O what a sight

The mirror, glory of my soul, proclaimed and raved.1

Exactly one thousand years after the passing of Imam
Hasan Askari, the last Imam of the blessed line of the Lord of
the Age,2 the appointed time anticipated by the followers of
Islam, according to the prophecies of the Qur’an, reached its
consummation when in AD 1844 the blessed Báb proclaimed
His mission in Shiraz and transformed the “night” of the Islamic
tradition by the dawning effulgence of His revelation heralding
the promised emergence of the Sun of Singleness.3

The Báb was born on the first day of Muharram of 1235 AH
(20th October of AD 1819) in Shiraz. The place of His birth was
the upper floor of the home of the paternal uncle of His mother
and His wife’s father, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ‘Alí. His mother,
Fátimih Bagum (Bagum is a title which signifies respect, e.g.,
lady), had recognized the sublime station of her glorious Son
through the teaching efforts of the wife of Hájí ‘Abdu’l­Majíd4
and Hájí Siyyid Javád Karbala’í.5 She passed away in Karbala6 in
1300 A.H. (October of 1883) in the year 40 of the Bábí calendar.

Shahriari.

6   The holy city of Karbilá in Iraq is the site of the shrine of the martyred Imam

Husayn, considered the most tragic event of Muslim history by the Shiites.

She has been honored by the Most Exalted Pen with the title of
Khayr’un’Nisá.”7 His father, Muhammad Riḍá, had passed
away in 1243 A.H. (1827) when the Báb was 8 or 9 years old, and
thus He was placed under the supervision of His maternal uncle
‘Alí, who was later to receive the title of the Most Great Uncle.

We are all well acquainted with the story of the Báb’s early
childhood and youth, and how He manifested evidences of keen
intellect and supernatural wisdom at such a tender age. Hand of
the Cause Hasan Balyuzi recounts that on the opening day of
the class at Shaykh ‘Ábid’s “Maktab”8 when only 5 years old,
the Báb was assigned a seat between two twelve­year­old boys.
One of these, Muhammad Ibrahím, who later became a well­
known merchant, gives the following account of the events of
that first day:

> On that day, the Báb sat respectfully looking
> intently at the written text of the lesson in front
> of Him, and yet unlike other students who read
> the lesson out loud in unison, as was the
> custom, He chose not to participate. When
> asked of the reason of His refusal to take part in
> the general recitation, He was heard whispering
> this verse from the great Háfíz:

> Abuzz with Thy name is the kingdom of heaven
> What, I wonder has entrapped you in this earthly plane

> At another time, in a class on religious doctrine
> some of the older students asked an abstruse
> question which puzzled Shaykh ‘Ábid who
> promised to research the question with the
> Mujtahids9 and provide the authoritative
> response at a later date. At that moment the Báb
> broke His silence and offering incontrovertible

> proof and cogent argument resolved the issue,
> which caused amazement and wonder among
> all present. Shaykh ‘Ábid asked where He had
> gained such knowledge, and the Báb, reciting a
> single verse from Háfíz answered:

> He who is touched by God’s grace
> Can do what Christ did, whatever the case

> It has also been written that at times the Báb
> would arrive late for class or was absent
> altogether. The concerned Shaykh ‘Ábid would
> send a few students to inquire about Him. They
> would return and report that they found the
> Báb in a prayerful state and thus did not disturb

> asked of the reason that had kept Him. The Báb,

> He had been in the house of His Forefather and
> that He wished He would be like Him!
> Considering that the Báb was a Siyyid and a
> descendent of the house of the Prophet
> Muhammad, the significance of this statement
> can readily be understood.

Other such stories of various events associated with the life
of the Báb, as described by Shaykh ‘Ábid and His classmates,
abound but are too lengthy for this summary presentation.

The Báb attended the classes of Shaykh ‘Ábid for a period of
six or seven years until He was 11 or 12 years old. At the age of
15, He became an associate in the commercial activities of His
uncle Siyyid ‘Alí. He subsequently moved to Bushihr10 and
resided there for some six years. Like the stories of His youth,
those regarding His extraordinary qualities of honesty and
integrity in His commercial dealings as well as His state of utter
devotion, attraction, and rapture as he performed His prayers

10 A city in southern Iran.

are just as astonishing and remarkable, and have been recorded
in the annals of the Faith of God.

In the Dawn­breakers Nabíl writes:

> The Báb was mostly engaged as a merchant in
> Bushihr and despite the city’s intemperate
> climate and extreme heat He spent several
> hours a day on the roof top in a prayerful state.
> Although the sun’s rays were intense yet His
> heart was so consumed by the love of His
> Beloved that He would hardly notice the heat
> and would continue with His prayers and
> supplications. Utterly forgetful of the world and
> all that was therein He would spend the hours
> between the early dawn and daybreak and from
> noon to early evening in a state of prayerful
> communion. At all times His attention was
> directed towards the city of Tihran as He
> welcomed and greeted the bright orb of the
> rising sun in a state of indescribable joy and
> rapture, a mystical allusion to the Sun of Reality
> whose rays were to illumine the entire planet.

> Yet the ignorant public suspected that He was
> worshipping the sun oblivious of the fact that
> His outward attention to the physical sun was a
> sign of His devotion to the Sun of Divine
> Reality that was yet to be made manifest. Siyyid
> Javád Karbala’í recounted that: Once when I
> was on a journey to India I arrived in Bushihr
> and since I had an established acquaintance
> with Mírzá Siyyid ‘Alí I went to pay him a visit.
> I met the Báb at that time for the first time.
> Whenever we met signs of humility, kindliness

> am utterly powerless to describe in words that
> luminous visage and that heavenly demeanor.

All who knew Him, acknowledged the purity of

> His being, the sweetness of His mannerism and
> conduct, His truthfulness and piety.

> In the spring of 1841, the Báb made a journey to

Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the All­Bountiful.12

It must be noted that the “Afnán,” or the branches of the
Divine Lote Tree, who are kinsmen of the Báb, are related to
Him mostly through the two brothers of His wife, Abú’l­Qásim
and Siyyid Hasan, and a number through His three maternal
uncles, namely, Siyyid ‘Alí (the Most Great Uncle), Siyyid
Muhammad (the Great Uncle), and Siyyid Hasan­‘Alí (the
Lesser Uncle).

On the eve of the 5th day of Jamadi’u’l­Avval of the year
1260 A.H. (23 May 1844), the Báb, then only 25 years of age,
proclaimed His mission to Mullá Husayn Bushrúyih, a
comprehensive description of which can be found in chapter 3
of The Dawn­Breakers. The first encounter between the Báb and
Mullá Husayn took place in an area outside of the town limits of
Shiraz known as “Goad Khazinih,”13 where the Báb occasionally
visited for relaxation as well as for contemplation and
enjoyment of the surrounding’s natural beauty. On that day,
accompanied by Mullá Husayn, the Báb returned home where
He made His declaration. Mullá Husayn is the first to believe in
the Báb. His other titles are: the First, the First Arrival, the First
to believe, the Bábu’l­Báb, the Báb and Siyyid ‘Alí.

Prior to Mullá Husayn’s confession of belief, the wife of the
Báb was aware that her Husband was endowed with an exalted
station. She recounts that from His actions, conduct and
disposition she had realized that He was a person of noble and
high rank but she never imagined He might be the Promised
Qá‘im until the night of Mullá Husayn’s visit. After dinner she
was given permission to retire to her bedroom but she could
hear the Báb’s voice until dawn as He spoke with Mullá Husayn
or recited holy verses after which the historic event took place.

12 Nabíl Zarandí, The Dawn­Breakers: Nabíl's Narrative of the Early Days of the

Bahá'í Revelation, p. 77.
13 Literally the “Deep Pool”.

The wife of the Báb, as attested by the Blessed Beauty, is the
first woman to believe in Him. In 1299 AH (AD 1882) she passed
away in Shiraz. In a tablet of visitation revealed by Bahá’u’lláh
in her honor, He bestows upon her His blessings and adds that
all the people who departed this life on the day of her passing
received God’s mercy and forgiveness:

> I bear witness that on the night thou didst ascend to
> the Abhá Horizon and to the Sublime Companion
> and on the day that followed, God forgave the sins of
> every man or woman who had ascended, as a token
> of grace unto thee and as a bounty for thee, except
> those who had openly denied God and repudiated
> what God has revealed….

Following Mullá Husayn, gradually the other Letters of the
Living,14 separately and of their own volition, recognized the
station of the Báb and confessed their belief in Him. A list
published in a number of historical accounts showing the names
of the Letters of the Living and the order in which they came to
recognize the Báb’s station is inaccurate. The second individual
to believe in the Báb, according to Nabíl, was in fact not Mullá
Husayn’s brother, as is generally held, but Mullá ‘Alí Bastámí
who accepted the new revelation some 40 days after the
declaration of belief by Mullá Husayn. Mullá ‘Alí Bastámí was
the first of the Letters of the Living to set out, as instructed by
the Báb, on a proclamation journey to Najaf in order to acquaint
the greatest and the most renowned Shiite scholar, Shaykh
Muhammad Hassan Isfahaní, the author of “Jawáhiru’l­
Kalám,”15 with the message of the Báb. He first visited Karbala
and disseminated the glad tidings of the new revelation. He also
met Táhirih in that city and recounted to her the events
associated with the declaration of the Báb. He then traveled to
Najaf and attended one of Shaykh Muhammad Hassan’s classes
and informed him of the news of the Báb’s declaration and
handed him His tablet in which he was addressed by name.

14 Letters of the Living are the first eighteen individuals who became believers

in the Báb.
15 The Spirit of Words – An exposition of sacred canons in Islam.

This renowned Shiite scholar, then a resident of Najaf, had,
over the course of 30 years of study and research, authored the
well­known work, the “Jawáhiru’l­Kalám fi Sharh­i­Sharial’­
Islam”16 in several volumes. His fame had reached such heights
that he became known as “the author of the Jawáhir” and “Chief
of Scholars.” He died in 1266 AH (1849).

Mullá ‘Alí was judged to be an apostate and an atheist by
this very same luminary and was delivered to the Ottoman
authorities by his pupils and was subsequently transported to
the Baghdad prison in chains. After months of imprisonment, he
was dispatched to Istanbul, but after departing Mosul in a
manner yet undiscovered, he was martyred. Mullá ‘Alí is the
first martyr of the Faith of the Báb. In 1262 AH (1846 CE), on
Ottoman soil, he sacrificed his life for his Beloved.

Mírzá Muhammad ‘Alí Bárfurúshí known to history as
“Quddús”, “the Last Point”, “the Last to Believe” and “the
Name of God, the Last”, was a member of the Letters of the
Living who, without requiring any proof or evidence, accepted
the Faith at the very first moment he laid eyes upon the Báb. But
Táhirih, even without the benefit of attaining His presence,
declared her belief in a letter addressed to Him. She asked her
brother­in­law Muhammad ‘Alí Qazvíní, who at the time was
departing from Karbala for Shiraz, to recite the following verse
while delivering her letter into the hands of the Beloved of the
world:

The shining light of Thy face has dawned,

Why dost Thou withhold Thy call to sound?
“Am I not Thy God?” Thy call would imply,

“Yea Thou art, Yea Thou art,” will Thou hear our reply,

Of the eighteen Letters of the Living, six were from
Khurasan (Mullá Husayn, his brother Mullá Muhammad
Hasan, his nephew Mullá Muhammad­Báqir, Mullá ‘Alí
Bastámí, Mullá Khudábakhsh Qúchání and Mullá Hasan
Bajistání), five were from Azerbaijan (Mullá Mahmúd Khu’í,
Mullá Jalíl Úrumí, Mullá Ahmad Abdál Marághi’í, Mullá Báqir
Tabrízí and Mullá Yúsuf Ardabílí. Mullá Báqir enjoyed a longer
life than the other Letters of the Living and thus became known

16 Ibid.

as the “Letter of the Living”), three were from Qazvin (the
beloved Táhirih, Muhammad ‘Alí, her brother­in­law, Hádí the
son of Mullá ‘Abdu’l­Vahháb Qazvíní), two from Yazd (Siyyid
Husayn Yazdí and Mullá Muhammad Yazdí), one from
Mazindaran (Siyyid Muhammad ‘Alí Bárfurúshí titled Quddús),
and one from India (Sa‘íd Hindí).

Of these 18 individuals, 12 were martyred, nine of them in
the struggle at Tabarsi; they are: Mullá Husayn, Mullá
Muhammad Hasan, Mullá Muhammad Báqir, Mullá Yúsuf
Ardabílí, Mullá Jalíl Úrumí, Mullá Ahmad Abdál Marághi’í,
Mullá Mahmúd Khu’í, Mírzá Muhammad ‘Alí Qazvíní and
Quddús. Mullá ‘Alí Bastámí was martyred in Iraq, and two
others, Táhirih and Siyyid Husayn Yazdí, were martyred in
Tihran.

Having dispatched the Letters of the Living on various
teaching campaigns, in Sha bán ̀  of 1260 AH (September of 1844),
the Báb, accompanied by Quddús and His Ethiopian servant, set
out for Mecca and the very heart of the world of Islam, the
Ka‘ba, where He conveyed the announcement of His revelation,
in writing, to the Sherriff of Mecca17 and verbally and openly to
Mírzá Muhít Kirmání, the most pompous Shaykhí scholar of the
time. He then set out for Medina but abandoned the idea of
proceeding to Karbala and in Safar of 1261 AH (1845) returned
to Bushihr.

Prior to His arrival He sent Quddús ahead to Shiraz to
deliver the Báb’s “Khasá’il Sab‘ih” or the “Seven Qualifications”
to Mullá Sádiq Muqaddas Khurásání18 (who prior to accepting
the Faith of the Báb had earned the rank of Ijtihád or authority
to issue legal religious judgment) so that, when raising the call
of “Adhán” (Prayer) in the mosque, he may proclaim the news
of the new revelation to the people. He complied with the
directive, which led to his arrest as well as the arrest of Quddús

and Mullá ‘Alí Ardistání.19 Husayn Khán, Ajudán­Báshí, the
governor of Fars, determined the penalties and ordered the
punishment. Mullá Sádiq received many lashes; the beards of all
three were burned, and they were subsequently dragged
throughout the bazaars and streets amid the clamor and
taunting of the populace. After subjecting them to much
torment, they were expelled from the city.

The account of this event was printed in the Times of
London as a news feature a few months later. This may well be
the very first piece of news related to the new revelation
published in the West.

Prior to this event, on his arrival in Shiraz from Bushihr,
Quddús had been received by the Báb’s uncle Siyyid ‘Alí, and
while in his company had delineated to him, to the extent that
had come to pass, the details of the new Faith of God and
disclosed the station of the Báb, which had led to Siyyid ‘Alí’s
profession of belief. Five years later, in the episode of the “seven
martyrs of Tihran,”20 Siyyid ‘Alí was the very first of the group
to sacrifice his life in the path of the Báb.

20 The Seven Martyrs of Tihran is a famous and tragic event in the history of the

> believers were arrested of whom seven of the most prominent and

1.   The Most Great Uncle of the Báb, Áqá Siyyid ‘Alí – After his visit with

> the Báb in Chihríq prison, he returned to Tihran and while resident in
> the home of Mírzá Muhammad Bayk Chápárchi, was arrested by the
> authorities. The prime minister summoned him and ordered him to

3.   Hájí Mullá Ismá‘íl Farahání – was a highly regarded scholar and

> intellectual. A number of people offered to pay large sums for his life.

When asked to recant his Faith, he cried out:

On His return from Bushihr to Shiraz, the Báb presented
Himself to the officials of the governor of Fars province who
had been dispatched for His arrest, and as recorded in detail in
various historical accounts, He appeared before this governor of
Fars, Husayn Khán Iravání, and during the interview was
insulted and struck in the face. Through the efforts of Imam
Jum‘ih and sponsorship of His uncle, He was released.

Following this event, the most influential individual to
recognize the Báb was Siyyid Yahyá Dárábí, known to history as
Vahíd, who was the son of Siyyid Ja’far Kashfí, a Muslim
scholar of the highest rank. Vahíd, who was known to be able to
recite some 30,000 Islamic Hadith21 from memory, was entrusted
by Muhammad Sháh the mission of investigating the Faith of
the Báb. In three sessions he was so utterly overwhelmed and
mesmerized by the Báb that he declared his belief.

In the summer of the third year of the Báb’s declaration of
His mission, on the 21st day of Ramadan of 1262 AH (23rd
September of 1846), on the instructions of Husayn Khán, the

governor, who himself had been ordered to murder the Báb,
‘Abdu’l­Hamíd Khán, the chief of police, along with a number
of government agents, attacked the house of the Báb. They
climbed over the outer wall of the property, entered the house
expecting to arrest a large number of Bábís but found and
arrested only the Báb and His companion Siyyid Kázim
Zanjání.22 However, because of a sudden cholera epidemic in
the city and the hasty departure of Husayn Khán from Shiraz,
‘Abdu’l­Hamíd Khán whose own child had fallen ill with the
dreaded disease, ordered the release of the Báb conditional on
His leaving the city and pleaded with Him for the life of his
child.

Having informed the governor of Isfahan of His intention to
travel to that city, the following morning the Báb journeyed to
Isfahan and spent some 6 months in that city (forty days in the
house of Imam Jum’ih and four months in the Sun palace, the
property of Manúchihr Khán, the Mu ̀tamidu’d­Dawlih the
governor of Isfáhan). Manúchihr Khán’s forefathers had been
from Georgia23 and were Christians. His father ‘Abdu’l­Vahháb
Isfahaní, was a well­known poet and wrote under the pen­name
of “Nishát” (Joy). During the reign of Fath­‘Alí Sháh, Manúchihr
Khán had been the governor of Kirmanshah and Gilan, and
from 1257 AH (1841) he had been entrusted with the
administration of Isfahan, Luristan and Bakhtyari territories.

The stories related to his physical endurance, the strength of
his hands, his prudence in management of affairs, and his zeal
and courage are astonishing. His rank in the Faith of God is so
lofty that ‘Abdu’l­Bahá in a tablet of visitation revealed in his
honor refers to him as “Siyyidu’l­Vuzará,” (the Master
Statesman), Maliku’l­Umará, (the King of Rulers),
Shamsu’l­’Sudúr, (the Sun of Wisdom), Badru’l­Budúr, (the Full
Moon of all Moons), Amír­i­Iqlímu’l­Athír, (the Ruler of the

At the end of his Tablet of Visitation, ‘Abdu’l­Bahá writes:

The significant events of the Báb’s sojourn in Isfahan and
the works revealed in that city, such as “the commentary of the
Súrih of “Val‘Asr,” which was revealed at the request of the
Imám Jum’ih; the work “the proof of the exclusivity of
prophethood,” revealed at the request of Manúchihr Khán; as
well as the intense attraction of the people towards the Báb; the
report of these events to Mírzá Áqásí by the local clergy; the
issuance of their judgment for the murder of the Báb and other
events have been dealt with in detail in the first chapter of the
matchless work God Passes By and chapter ten of The Dawn­
Breakers and other books of history. And yet every event
associated with the life of that heavenly Being has given rise to
the manifestation of a dramatic and dazzling outcome.

One night the blessed Báb was a guest of Mírzá Ibráhím
Nahrí, the father of Sultán’ush­Shuhadá and Mahbub’ush­
Shuhadá,24 who were no more than ten or twelve years old, at
his home in Isfahan. Mírzá Ibrahím who was the principal
deputy of the Sultánu’l­Ulamá (the town’s chief cleric) confided
to Him that his brother Muhammad ‘Alí and his wife had been

24 The King and Beloved of Martyrs respectively

unable to have a child. The Báb placed some food in a plate so
that they may eat from it and remarked that according to the
divine Will they will achieve the desire of their hearts.
Subsequently, they became the parents of a daughter named
Fátimih, who years later became the wife of ‘Abdu’l­Bahá and
was subsequently honored by Bahá’u’lláh with the title of
Munírih.

Also in Isfahan at the instigation of Hájí Mírzá Áqásí there
was an attempt for issuance of a fatwá (a religious judgment) to
have the Báb murdered. However the prudent handling of the
situation by Manúchihr Khán preserved the Báb who was, as
seen by many witnesses, escorted out of the city of Isfahan and
later surreptitiously brought back to the city and housed in the
famed government house known as Qasr­i­Khurshíd (the sun
palace).

Manúchihr Khán had many extraordinary and detailed
plans for the triumph of the Cause. He wished to place his
enormous wealth at the Báb’s disposal and himself play the role
of an intermediary between Him and the Sháh and on the Báb’s
behalf ask for the hand of one of Sháh’s sisters in marriage. But
the Manifestation of God did not consent to his worldly plan
and disclosed to him his (Manúchihr Khán’s) fast approaching
death, which took place not long after. His nephew Gurgín
Khán immediately alerted Mírzá Áqásí of the Báb’s presence in
Isfahan, which subsequently led to His arrest and exile.

Under guard, the Báb was moved to Kashan. In that town,
on the Naw­Rúz of 1263 AH (AD 1847), the third new year since
His declaration and the fourth year of the Badi’ calendar, He
sojourned for two days and three nights in the home of Hájí
Mírzá Jání, who was later condemned to the dungeon of Tihran
along with the Blessed Beauty and was subsequently martyred.

The Báb was then taken to Zanjan via the villages of
Kinargird and Koulayn. In Zanjan, He stayed for a brief time in
the caravansary of Mírzá ‘Alí Muhammad Tabíb and was
subsequently moved to Tabriz. (Tabíb became a believer in the
Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, and some 20 years after the Báb’s stay at
his caravansary, in the presence of the governor and high­
ranking clergy, he was beheaded in a tub and achieved the
station of martyrdom in the path of God.

After a forty­day sojourn in Tabriz, the Báb was moved to
Máh­Kú. The Máh­Kú village and its prison were situated at the
summit of a mountain, which had but one entry or exit. The Báb
spent some nine months in that prison. At nights He was not
even allowed a lamp, and the cold was so intense that while
performing His ablutions for His prayers, the water would
freeze on His face.

Despite being Kurds and belonging to the Sunni branch of
Islam and thus avowed enemies of the Shiites, the governor and
the people of Máh­Kú nevertheless were so captivated and
enraptured by the Báb that in Jamádí of 1264 AH(April of 1848)
Hájí Mírzá Áqásí was forced to transfer the Báb from Máh­Kú to
Chihríq. In Máh­Kú due to ‘Alí Khán Kurd’s (the powerful ruler
of Máh­Kú) affection for the Báb, multitudes of believers
attained His presence. This included Mullá Husayn who
journeyed some 1,100 miles from Khurasan to attain His
presence in the Naw­Rúz of that year. Vahíd, too, was able, for a
second time, to gain admittance to that threshold. In that prison
the Persian and Arabic Bayán (the Mother Book of the Bábí
revelation) and the work “the seven proofs” along with nine
separate commentaries on the Qur’an and a great tablet
addressed to Muhammad Sháh and other tablets were revealed
and dispatched.

While imprisoned in Máh­Kú, other significant events also
occurred, including the incident in Qazvin whereby Mullá
Muhammad Taqí Baraqání was murdered by the hand of a
Shaykhí youth that resulted in the arrest and imprisonment of a
group of innocent Bábís and their subsequent dispatch to the
capital city. Another event was the first imprisonment of
Bahá’u’lláh in Tihran, which was carried out by order of Mírzá
Muhammad Shafí’, the Justice Minister, for Bahá’u’lláh’s having
given aid to the prisoners of Qazvin. Another major event was
the martyrdom in Tihran of Shaykh Sálih Karímí who counts as
the very first martyr of the Bábí cause in Iran. He had been one
of Táhirih’s followers and had been converted to the Cause of
the Báb by her. At the time of his martyrdom, unfazed by the
circumstances, he recited this verse:

To people I’ve left their religion and their world

Since I found you, O my Faith and my World

Other major events were the martyrdoms of Hájí
Asadu’lláh, Mullá Táhir Shírází, and Mullá Ibráhím Mahallátí in
Qazvin; the arrest and imprisonment of Táhirih in Qazvin; and
her subsequent release due to Bahá’u’lláh’s intervention.

To continue with the story, when Hájí Mírzá Áqásí
discovered the attraction of the people and governor of Máh­Kú
towards the Báb, he had Him transferred to the Chihríq Fort
near Salmás (Sháhpúr) on April 10, 1848 and placed Him in the
custody of Yahyá Khán the Kurd, who was the brother­in­law of
Muhammad Sháh and the uncle of Násiru’d­Dín Mírzá, the
crown prince. But before long Yahyá Khán became so enamored
by the Báb that he felt compelled to show the utmost
consideration and care during the entire period of His
imprisonment in Chihríq.

The Báb was imprisoned in Chihríq for a total of 27 months,
and yet, having captured the hearts and souls of the people, He
continued to counsel and guide them to the path of truth. The
attraction was such that the number of visitors who arrived to
visit the Báb exceeded the accommodating capacity of the
village. And although the inhabitants were of the Kurdish tribe
and belonged to the Sunni branch of Islam and were much more
fanatical than the people of Máh­Kú, yet the majority of them
were utterly captivated by the presence of the blessed Báb. In
that time a number of the believers attained His presence such
as Mírzá Assadulláh Khu’í, titled Dayyán, as well as the Báb’s
Most Great Uncle who had been like a father to Him and who
subsequent to this last visit was arrested in Tihran and became
the first of the seven lovers who sacrificed their lives in the path
of the Báb in Tihran.

During the Báb’s imprisonment in Chihríq the following
major events took place:

   After some three months, the Báb was moved from

> Chihríq to Tabriz on the direct order of Hájí Mírzá
> Áqásí, so that the ‘ulamá could, under his orders, select
> whatever expedient they deemed fit to quench the fire
> of His Cause and His Person. Fearing a major

> commotion in Khu’í, which was located along the
> normal route of the journey, the Báb was taken to Tabriz
> through the town of Urummiyih where in a show of
> great excitement throngs of people enthusiastically
> welcomed Him.
   The meeting for the examination and interrogation of

> the Báb before the ‘ulamá of Tabriz and in the presence
> of Násiru’d­Dín Mírzá, the crown prince, was convened
> in which the Báb openly declared His station as the
> Qá‘im, following which the ‘ulamá voted for His
> punishment. But the attendants refused to carry out the
> penalty, and thus Mírzá ‘Alí Asghar, the Shaykh’ul­
> Islám, took the Báb to his own house and there
> personally performed the punishment of bastinado on
> His feet.
   Another event is the journey of Mullá Husayn to

> Mashhad, which was followed by the arrival of Quddús
> in that city and the turmoil created by their teaching
> activities, the fame of Bayt­i­Bábyih (the Bábí house),
> the arrest of Hassan, Mullá Husayn’s man­servant, his
> subsequent liberation by the hand of the Bábís and the
> protest and cry of Yá Sáhib’uz­Zamán (O Possessor of
> the Day of Judgment) by the Muslims in Mashhad, all of
> which is recorded in detail in the latter part of chapter
> 14 and the beginning of chapter 16 of The Dawn­Breakers.
   And yet another major development was the

> assemblage of the Bábís at the conference at Badasht
> which was convened to announce the independence of
> the religion of Bayán and the beginning of the new
> world order. The conference took place in the summer
> of 1848 and lasted 22 days during which Quddús,
> Táhirih, and a group of some 80 believers were hosted
> by Bahá’u’lláh. Details of this significant event are
> recorded by the beloved Guardian in chapter 2 of his
> God Passes By, as well as by Nabíl Zarandí in chapter 16

of The Dawn­breakers.
   Also there took place, on 4 September 1848, the death of

> Muhammad Sháh, the flight of Hájí Mírzá Áqásí from
> the court and his seeking asylum, the start of reign of

> Násiru’d­Dín Mírzá, and the premiership of Mírzá Taqí
> Khán,25 the Amír Kabír (the Great ruler).

The struggle at Tabarsi also counts as a defining point in the
Bábí revelation. There, in accordance with the instructions of the
Báb, Mullá Husayn with 202 of his companions, hoisting aloft
the black standard, set out from Khurasan towards Mazandaran
and on 12 October 1848 arrived at the outskirts of the shrine of
Ahmad Tabaristání (Shaykh Tabarsi), who had been a
prominent Islamic religious scholar and innovator. The shrine is
located some 10 kilometers outside of the town of Barfurush
(present day Babul). Taking a defensive stance, they occupied
the shrine and constructed a number of walls and towers.
Having inspected the fortifications on His visit to the Fort,
Bahá’u’lláh caused the release of Quddús from his confinement
in Babul and helped him to join the defenders of Tabarsi, where
their number grew to some 313 souls. This number matched the
number of Muhammad’s companions in the battle of “Badr,”26
which according to the hadith (tradition) should be the same
number that would stand with the Qá‘im when He arises.

These companions demonstrated extraordinary valor in
defending themselves for seven months and frequently defeated
the government forces that were dispatched against them and
who were equipped with latest weaponry and heavy artillery.
In one of the major defensive attacks undertaken by the
companions, Mullá Husayn was martyred and the government
forces were totally annihilated. Finally, Mihdí Qulí Mírzá, an
uncle of the Sháh, affixed his seal on a copy of the holy Qur’an
and took an oath that if the companions abandon the struggle
no harm would come to any of them. But as they sat down to eat
they were attacked and to a man, martyred. Quddús was taken
to Babul and there according to the Fatwá of Sa‘ídu’l­‘Ulamá,
was torn to pieces in the Sabzih­Miydán. Nabíl writes that they
tortured him so savagely that the pen is powerless to depict.

25 Mírzá Taqí Khán was a man of great achievement and is considered, in

> Persian history, as one of the most astute statesmen to occupy the office of
> Prime Minister. He became the subject of the king’s ire and was murdered, by
> his order, while taking a bath in Fin, Kashan.
26 One of Muhammad’s battles with the idolaters

Bahá’u’lláh has commented that none who has born the torture
of martyrdom has suffered as Quddús did, not even Jesus.

Another event was the martyrdom of the “Seven Martyrs of
Tihran,” which took place some four months prior to the
martyrdom of the Báb. It ranks as one of the most astonishing
epics of self­sacrifice and ready surrender of life in the path of
the incomparable Beloved.

The conflict at Nayriz is yet another major event of this
period. The great Vahíd and his companions perforce found
refuge in the Fort of Khajou and there took defensive action and
defeated all the invading forces until Zaynu’l­‘Ábidin Khán, the
governor of Niyríz and the commander of the forces, resorted to
deception and fixing his seal on a copy of the Qur’an, took an
oath not to harm any of the prisoners. And in this way he
achieved his victory over the companions. Once victorious, he
tortured and killed the entire group and their entire families in
the most gruesome manner. Near the end of the conflict and
some ten days before the martyrdom of the Báb, on 18 Sha’abán
1266 AH (29 June 1850) Vahíd himself was martyred.

The conflict at Zanjan ranks as one of the most significant
events in Bábí history. Tens of thousands of army troops were
defeated repeatedly at the hands of the three thousand
companions of Hujjat27 who had taken refuge in the Fort of ‘Alí
Mardán Khán. This conflict continued for some six months after
the martyrdom of the Báb and eventually resulted in the
martyrdom of Hujjat and some 1,800 of his companions.

After 27 months in the Chihríq prison and under
instructions of Mírzá Taqí Khán, the Amír Kabír, the Báb was
moved to Tabriz where the judgment for His execution had
already been signed by the town’s clerical establishment. He
along with the immortal Anís (Mírzá Muhammad ‘Alí Zunúzí)
was brought to the field of martyrdom having been tied to a

27 Siyyid Muhammad ‘Alí Zanjání, immortalized as Hujjat, accepted the new

wall before the guns of the regiment of Sam Khán, the Christian,
and, as is recorded in various historical accounts, fired upon.

The bullets did not initially find their mark. After the Báb
had completed His instructions to His amanuensis, the
prisoners were again tied to the wall in such a way that Anís’
head rested on the Báb’s breast across from 750 troops of the
Nasseri regiment under the voluntary command of Áqa Ján
Bayk Khamsi‘í. The lover and his Beloved became the target of
750 bullets. The martyrdom of the Báb took place on 28
Sha’aban of 1266 AH (9 July 1850). At the time the Báb was 30
years and six months of age, and some six years and forty­four
days had passed from the date of His declaration.

The details of the martyrdom of the Báb, a reference to His
exalted rank, and the description of the effects of this significant
event can be found in chapter 4 of the Guardian’s matchless
work God Passes By and also in chapter 23 of Nabíl’s immortal
narrative.

The blessed Báb is known by some 40 different titles as have
appeared in various Bahá’í Writings or have become customary
terminologies among the believers some of which are:

> The Primal Point,
> The Point around which circle the spirits of all
> Prophets
> The Herald to the Most Great Abhá Luminary
> The Point of the Bayán
> The Unique Herald
> The Morning of Truth
> The Sea of Seas
> The Most Great Prophet
> The Most Great Remembrance of God
> The Promised Qá‘im
> The Essence of Essences
> The Most Exalted Father
> The Father
> The Spirit of Spirits
> The Most Great Gate
> The Mention of God, the Most High
> The Unique mystery

> The King of the Kingdoms of Bounty and Grace
> The Morning of Truth
> The Point
> The Most Great Legislator

Regarding Anís, Bahá’u’lláh has written:

> We recall to mind at this point Muhammad before
> ‘Alí (Muhammad ‘Alí) whose flesh became
> amalgamate with the flesh of his Lord, and his blood
> with His blood and his remains with His remains
> and his bones with the bones of his Almighty and
> Merciful Lord. My exalted pen testifies that he
> achieved to a rank never before achieved by anyone
> and befell him what no ear has heard its like. Upon
> him be My glory and the glory of My Kingdom and
> My habitation and the glory of the denizens of the
> cities of justice and fairness.

The Fate of the Oppressors
Those of high rank who held positions of responsibility and
who rose against the Báb or His companions received terrible
punishment and met with inauspicious ends in this world.
Some of these are:

1.   The governor of Fars Husayn Khán Iravání, titled the

> Ájúdán Báshí or the Nizámu’d­Dawlih, imprisoned the
> Báb and ordered that He should be struck in the face. It
> was he, also, who ordered that Muqaddas receive a
> thousand lashes and that his beard and those of Quddús
> and Mullá ‘Alí Akbar Ardistání be burned and that they
> be haltered and paraded through the streets and
> bazaars. After four years as governor, he was suddenly
> dismissed from office and was pursued by the
> government. He finally found refuge at the embassies of
> foreign governments and in 1858 died in hiding in utter
> ignominy and misery. In Bahá’í Writings he is referred
> to as: the vicious Husayn and the Tyrant of the Land of
> Shín (Shín refers to Shiraz).

2.   Gurgín Khán, nephew of Manúchihr Khán, who

> informed Mírzá Áqásí of the Báb’s whereabouts and
> caused the arrest and exile of the Báb from Isfahan was
> struck by diphtheria, which led to his suffocation. His
> title is “the Hateful Gurgín.”
3.   Muhammad Sháh who approved the many early

> martyrdoms and the exile of the Báb to the mountains of
> Adhirbaijan was afflicted, at the age of 40, with a
> multitude of diseases that led to his early death in 1848

after enduring much pain and suffering.
4.   Mírzá Áqásí, prime minister of Muhammad Sháh, was

> uneducated and had been a scoundrel and a clown in
> Tabriz. His wit caused him great pain as once while
> traveling on foot following along the caravan that
> included the personal carriage of Nessá Bagum, the

Áqásí.

Hájí Mírzá Áqásí was the cause of the Báb’s exile to

> Minister.”
5.   Mírzá ‘Alí Asghar, Shaykhu’l­Islám30 of Tabriz was the

13. The people of Iran who in every hamlet and city

This was a summary of the highlights of the history of the
life of the blessed Báb and the fate of those who rebelled against
the Manifestation of God.

– Part 2 –
This presentation concerns three subject matters:

    First is delineation and presentation of evidence and

> proof regarding the supremacy of the station of the Bábí
> Revelation as compared to all the former Dispensations
> that have appeared in various periods in history. As
> Bahá’u’lláh clearly states, “His rank excelleth that of all
> the prophets and whose revelation transcendeth the
> comprehension and understanding of all their chosen
> ones.”34
    Second is showing that the most significant and

> momentous aim of the Bábí dispensation was to prepare
> the people to expect and welcome the Faith of
> Bahá’u’lláh and to declare their belief in the Abhá
> religion. Contrary to former times in which the glad­
> tidings of the future revelation were vaguely intimated,
> the Báb had explicitly and clearly referred to the event
> to follow, specifying name and date of appearance.
> How ironic that the people of darkness and the ignoble
> group who have raised Azal’s unworthy standard chose
> to overlook His clear and repeatedly emphatic warnings
> and have clung to the word “Mustagháth”35 ascribing to
> it interpretations contrary to the obviously intended
> counsels of the Bayán and creating what has been no
> more than the buzzing murmur of a fly. However, as
> the shameful clamor has since been silenced we will not
> consider it further. Here, it will suffice to quote a few of
> the relevant glad­tidings.
    Third is explaining the astonishing and incredible

> impact of the divine scriptures that flowed from this
> heavenly revelation and highlighting the fact that the
> beloved Báb sacrificed not only His own Being but also

34 Quoted from Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb­i­Íqán (Egypt), p. 189.
35 The word Mustagháth, meaning “he who is invoked for assistance” which

> appears in the Bayán, has a numerical value of 2001 in the Abjad numerology.
> Those who rejected Bahá’u’lláh argued that the coming of “Him who God
> shall make manifest” will take place in such a year. It was a puny argument
> the effect of which lasted for only a brief time, a misty fog which was
> dissipated under the brilliant sun of Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation.

> the entirety of His religion—His foremost disciples and
> His greatest champions as well as the very effect and
> influence that His scriptures had instilled in the hearts
> of the people of the world—in the path of Bahá’u’lláh.

 

In order to explain the first subject, that is, the superior
nature of the religion of the Báb, we must compare His Writings
that are the fruits of His innate knowledge with those of former
dispensations. Any such study clearly indicates that Báb’s
revealed scriptures which constitute the very core of His
religion and are divinely inspired and originate in the influences
of the Holy Spirit, are clearly beyond comparison with those of
today’s three established religions both in scope and substance.
The comparison is more apt since the scriptures of these Faiths,
unlike the religious systems practiced in the Far East, have not
been subject to variation, alteration or textual corruption.

In order to do this, we first have to take a cursory look at the
scriptures associated with the Authors of the three major
religions of antiquity.

In the Mosaic religion, the only trace and the sole written
document linked to the Author of that Faith is the Torah, which
contains 5 sections, namely:

   Genesis, which contains stories of the creation of the

universe and of man;
   Exodus, which describes the departure of the Israelites

from Egypt;
   Leviticus, which contains religious instructions and

> divine commandments as well as penal laws and rules
> of animal slaughter. Also included is the explanation of
> the station of the progeny of Leviticus who himself was
> the third son of Jacob, a line to which Moses also
> belongs;

   Numbers, which fixes the number of individual

> Israelites in the second year of Exodus from Egypt.

Other issues are also discussed here;
   Deuteronomy, which is a repetitious presentation of a

number of the commandments.

Torah is a Hebrew word meaning religion or training. Not
only is this book not written by Moses, but in fact the recording
of its various parts and its final compilation took place some
1,000 years after His time by Ezra (the Writer) with the aid of a
group of the learned and devoted faithful. Of course, the
Commandments of Torah had been recorded by the early
believers prior to and possibly in accordance with God’s Will
and were being kept in the “Ark of the Covenant,” which had
very likely been obliterated in the repeated destruction and
burning of Jerusalem, the story of which is quite extensive. In
studying the Torah you will note that it is replete with
narratives and sagas and interspersed throughout the books of
Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy one can also glean a few of
the divine commandments.

In the third volume of His “Makátíb” ‘Abdu’l­Bahá states:

> The main Torah comprises the Tablets that were
> revealed to Moses and includes the commandments.
> The rest which consists of stories and legends were
> added later and are not authentic.

The intent here is to show that in the Jewish religion no
work has survived from the pen of the Author of that religion
and what does exist are some of the commandments revealed
for the Jewish people as appropriate to the elementary state of
civilization prevalent at that time. Moreover, these
commandments may be gleaned from amidst hundreds of
strange stories and amazing legends describing the attack of
frogs, flies, mosquitoes, and locusts; the death of the first­born
child of both man and beast; the changing of water into blood;
the parting of the sea; delivery of the supply of water and bread
in the mornings and meat at nights other than Saturdays; and
hundreds of similar tales, which if not personally read can
hardly be imagined.

The remainder of the Old Testament comprises 34 books or
treatises or articles from the Jewish prophets. The Old
Testament prophets were 48 in number, the first of whom was
Joshua and the last was Malachi. They are generally referred to
as “Muh Nabí” which means 48 prophets (M = 40 and H = 8;
vowels have no numerical value). Four of these were Major
Prophets: Jeremiah, Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel. It has been
written that some of these treatises were not actually authored
by any of these prophets and that they were instead written by
devoted believers and produced in their memories or in their
names, and therefore the works are simply associated with
them.

For instance, some believe that the Book of Joshua was
possibly written by someone other than Joshua several centuries
after the event but that it contains the words of Joshua. Some
relate the Book of Judges to Ezra and some to Nehemiah and
others to Jeremiah. Some relate the production of the Book of
Glad Tidings to Jeremiah and others to Ezra and also the
compilation of the Book of Nehemiah is related to Ezra. The two
Books on Kings are linked to Jeremiah and Ezra, and the
compilation of the two Books of Esther and Job are linked to two
unknown individuals written in consolation of the Jews for their
suffering so many hardships and calamities in their bondage in
the land of Babel. Even some do not associate the entire 150
Songs of David to Him but some to Solomon and others to Asaf
the chief musician of Solomon. Sumerians believe solely in the
first seven Books, namely, the five main Books and the Books of
Joshua and Judges.





Evangel, which means glad­tidings, is also not penned by
Jesus and was written by four of the initial believers, about His
life in Hebraic and subsequently in Greek. These putative
authors are Matthew and John who were disciples and Luke
and Mark who belong to the early group of believers. Therefore,
we have four Evangels, which have been recorded and arranged
sometime in the second half of the first Christian century, the
details of which remain unclear.

These four accounts contain the stories related to the life of
Jesus and His teachings, counsels and commandments as
remembered by these four believers. The oldest copies of the
New Testament are works of compilation belonging to the 4th
or 5th centuries of the Christian era, such as the Sinaitic copy of
the St. Petersburg Museum, the Efraimieh copy that is kept in
the National Museum of Paris, the Vatican copy in the Vatican,
and the Alexandria copy of London. The Evangel recorded by
Luke is the most comprehensive and that of Mark is the
shortest. The three works written by Matthew, Luke, and Mark
are very similar and contain the account of the life and sayings
of Jesus. These are also called the “Synoptic Gospels.” John’s
version is somewhat different from others and contains
philosophic issues regarding the meaning of “the Word,” “Holy
Spirit,” and the divinity of Jesus.

The balance of the New Testament consists of 23 treatises or
books from Luke and John, and a number of other early
believers and disciples:

>    Book of Acts from Luke
>    Fourteen letters from Paul
>    One letter from Jacob
>    Two letters from Peter
>    Three letters from John
>    One letter from Judas
>    One Book of Revelations of John

And thus in Christianity as in Judaism no work was issued
from the pen of Jesus Himself and thus what we see in the
scriptures are stories about the life of Jesus as well as His
teachings and counsels as written by the early believers.





The Qur’an was not penned by Muhammad. The revelation
of verses, whether commandments or stories, took place as
prompted by circumstances and was instantly memorized by a
number of the believers or was written on tree leaves, stone
tablets, animal skin, flat pieces of wood, or large bones. Some 45

individuals have been identified as the recorders of revealed
scripture. The most famous memorizers of the Qur’an are ‘Alí,
Zayd­ibn­i­Thábit, ‘Uthmán­ibn­i­Áffán, ‘‘Abdu’lláh Mas‘úd,
Abú Músá Ash‘árí, Abú­Darda’, and Abi­ibn­i­Ka’b. However,
there were other scribes and memorizers, a number of whom
later lost their faith and abandoned the religion, i.e., ‘Abdu’lláh,
brother of ‘Uthmán.

The memorized versions of the Qur’an did not always agree
with the transcribed versions, and therefore Abú Bakr, the first
Caliph, instructed Zayd­ibn­i­Thábit to solicit the aid of a
number of knowledgeable believers of the Quraysh tribe and
the memorizers of the Qur’an and embark upon collection,
compilation, and eventual generation of a formalized version of
the Book. Having accomplished the task, Abú Bakr placed the
completed version of the Qur’an in the care of Hafsih, daughter
of Omar and the wife of the Prophet of God.

Years later, during the Caliphate of Uthmán­ibn­‘Affán, the
third Caliph, a wave of complaints and critical remarks from
rank and file believers began to be received, indicating their
deep concern that each tribe and each family group was reading
a Qur’an that was different in content from other Qur’ans. Thus
Uthmán ordered that four copies of the corrected version of the
Qur’an compiled by Zayd be prepared in the Quraysh style of
writing and dispatched to the major Islamic centers, and he
decreed that all other versions be destroyed. (Some Shiites
believe that ‘Alí also destroyed his own version although there
were significant differences between his copy and the final
Uthman version, in order to prevent the possibility of
dissension.)

The Holy Qur’an, so compiled and current among Muslims
today, has 114 Súrihs and some 6200 verses. The largest Súrih is
the Súrih of “Baqarih” or “Cow” and the smallest is the Súrih of
“Kawthar” the name of a fountain or a river in Paradise, which
contains only three verses.

The Qur’an was revealed over the course of some 23 years
to Muhammad, 13 years in Mecca and 10 years in Medina.
(Some verses were revealed outside of these two cities at the
sites of His battles with unbelievers). Some 82 of the Súrihs are
revealed in Mecca and 20 in Medina, yet there are major
disputes regarding the origin of each Súrih.

And so the Qur’an is also not from the pen of the Prophet
Muhammad, and the last collection of its verses, as well as their
phraseology and the order in which they appear in the Book,
happened some 15 years after the passing of the Prophet of God.
This included the compilation of the verses into Súrihs and
giving each Súrih a designation to simplify identification. This
was at a time when the Arabs had neither the punctuation
marks such as the “period” nor the proper transliteration
methodology and the use of applicable vowels in order to fix the
proper pronunciation of words, the absence of which could
dramatically change their meaning.36

At that time ‘Alí was aware of the significance of the vowels
of the Qur’an, since in the Arabic language changing vowels not
only can change a male noun to a female noun but also can alter
the meaning of phrases and sentences altogether. However, the
Arabs considered the addition of vowels to the Qur’an
objectionable, and only later in the history of Islam was this
view gradually moderated. It was not until the time of Hajjáj­
ibn­i­Yúsif that periods and vowels were incorporated.

The mention of the above facts does not imply nor should it
be considered as suggesting any skepticism or misgivings on the
part of the people of Bahá in their regard for the authenticity of
these sacred works. It is, however, an explanation of the method
of the compilation of their contents and the manner in which
they are linked to the divinely ordained Authors themselves.
Armed with this knowledge, we are now able to draw an
accurate comparison between these Works and the scripture of
the Bábí Faith.





The revealed Works of the Báb, which in terms of quantity
are several times the combined works of all the prophets who
have gone before Him, have all been issued from His own pen
or dictated to scribes in His presence and later reviewed and
sealed. The magnitude of these Verses and Works are such that

36 In Arabic the word “Mahram” which means confidant and “Mujrim” which

> means criminal look precisely alike on paper with the difference being the
> addition of a single period and changing in pronunciation of two vowels.

the Guardian in his God Passes By writes, “The revelation of the
Báb, in terms of the sheer size of His Works and the vastness
and eloquence of their significances as revealed from His pen is
unmatched in the annals of religion.”

In the Kitáb­i­Íqán, comparing the works of the Báb with all
existing sacred works, Bahá’u’lláh writes:

> The prophets ‘endowed with constancy’ whose
> loftiness and glory shine as the sun, were each
> honored with a Book which all have seen, and
> the verses of which have been duly ascertained.
> Whereas the verses which have rained from this
> Cloud of divine mercy have been so abundant
> that none has yet been able to estimate their
> number. A score of volumes are now available.
> How many have been plundered and have
> fallen into the hand of the enemy, the fate of
> which none knoweth.37

The Báb Himself while being interrogated in the presence
of the heir to the throne stated that within a space of two days
and two nights he revealed verses equivalent to the entirety of
the Qur’an , and in yet another passage He bears witness that
until His imprisonment in Máh­Kú the bulk of His revealed
works exceeded some 500,000 verses (Half a million verses in
three years compared to six thousand verses of the Qur’an in 23
years).

The names of some of the Báb’s works are:

1.   Commentary on the Súrih of Joseph, which according to

> Bahá’u’lláh is the Báb’s “first, mightiest and greatest
> book.”38 The Súrih of Joseph as revealed in the Qur’an
> has 111 verses. The Báb’s commentary contains 111
> Súrihs, which means one Súrih was specifically revealed
> and named by the Báb for each verse of the Qur’an. The
work contains a total of 9,300 verses.

The first Súrih, named Súratu’l­Mulk, (Súrih of
Dominion) was revealed by the Báb for Mullá Husayn

37 Bahá’u’lláh , The Kitáb­i­Iqán, p. 216.
38 Ibid., p. 231.

> Bushrúyih on the night of the 5th of Jamádí, the night of
> His declaration. Mullá Husayn later presented a
> number of the verses of this first Súrih to Bahá’u’lláh,
> which received His praise and acclamation. The balance
> of the work was revealed gradually over time.
> According to the beloved Guardian, this blessed and
> heavenly treatise was translated for the sake of the
> Persian friends through the exceptional literary genius
> of Táhirih. The other name of this formidable work is
> “Qayyúm­ul­Asmá” (Eternal Names), as Yúsuf (Joseph)
> in the Abjad Numerology is equivalent to the word
> “Qayyúm” or eternal. Here, by “Qayyúm,” the very
> Person of the Báb is intended. In a letter to His uncle the
> Báb writes:

> …and know thou that the number of Yúsuf, (156) is
> equivalent to “Qayyúm” and the intended reference
> is to the ‘Qá’im of the House of Muhammad’ and He
> is the Living and Self­subsistent. Therefore the first
> commentary at the dawn of His revelation concerned
> His own Name.…

The expression, ‘Ahsanu’l­Qisas’ or ‘the best story­
> teller’ (and not the best of stories since in the Súrih of
> Joseph in the Qur’an it is revealed that: “We tell you
> stories in the best manner”) also appears in the Qur’an
> in the Súrih of Yúsuf.
2.   The Arabic Bayán was revealed in Máh­Kú. This work

> is smaller than the Persian Bayán and is also referred to
> as “Kitábu’l­Jizá” (Book of Chastisement).
3.   The Persian Bayán was also revealed in Máh­Kú. This

> “Kull­i­Shay” or “all things,” the numeric value of which
> is 361 (the product of 19 x 19). In the Bayán each unity or

> references to the revelation of Bahá’u’lláh as well as His
> own martyrdom.
5.   The Commentary on the Súrih of Kawthar39 comprises

> some 2000 verses and was revealed for Vahíd in Shiraz. (In

> in Mecca and has only three verses.)
6.   The Commentary on the Súrih of “Val'Asr”40 is

> equivalent to one­third of the Qur’an and was revealed
> in Isfahan at the request of Muhammad, the
> Sultánu’l­’Ulamá, King of Divines. (This Súrih, 103rd in

39 Súrih of Kawthar in the Qur’an was revealed in Mecca and is the smallest

Súrih with only three verses.
40 The Súrih of “Val‘Asr” was also revealed in Mecca and also contains only

three verses

7.    The Commentary on the Al­Há is another of the

> important works of the Báb that concerns an account of
> His afflictions and suffering and the injustices of His

10.   The Letters Addressed to Muhammad Sháh are three

important and well­known works.
11.   The Letters Addressed to Sultán ‘Abdu’l­Majíd and

Najíb Páshá, governor of Baghdad.
12.   Letters Addressed to Hájí Mírzá Áqásí, including the

> censure and warning. This work was revealed after the
> Báb’s return from Tabriz to Chihríq.
13.   Letters addressed to each of the Iranian religious

> leaders in various cities and those in Najaf and
> Karbala. This includes two letters addressed to Shaykh
> Muhammad Hasan Isfahani who was a resident of

> appointed ‘Alí and sent him to you. Had you
> recognized him you would have prostrated yourself
> before him.”
14.   The Seven Qualifications introduces the seven traits

> and qualities of the Bábí Faith and is addressed to the

16. Risálih­i­Ithbát­i­Nabuvvat­i­Khassih (Treatise on

> Proof of the Exclusivity of Prophethood) is a proof of
> the prophethood of the Seal of the Prophets
> (Muhammad), which was revealed in response to an

> Manúchihr Khán himself was present.
17. Risálih­i­Dhahábiyyih (the Golden Treatise) was

> revelation.
18. Risálih­i­Sulúk (The Treatise on Spiritual Journey) which

> is one of the Báb’s early works was possibly revealed even
> prior to the passing of Siyyid Kázim Rashtí. It brings to
> light the requirements and conditions of the spiritual
> journey from self to God. In it, the Báb directly quotes
> from the writings of the Siyyid and ends the reference by
> imploring God to lengthen his life, which indicates that the
> work was revealed in Siyyid’s lifetime. The quotation
> reads:

> ….The main obstacle (on the spiritual journey) is
> heedlessness and disregard of the divine Providence
> —Verily this world and the next are but two
> conditions—if your focus is on God then you are in
> paradise and if you only look to yourself, then you
> are in hell. Understand the illusions, break the habits
> and customs, abandon lust, endure every disloyalty
> of the people, every reproach of the friend, every
> rebuke of the enemy and every censure of the spouse
> and child— then, as you have trodden the path of
> spiritual attainment you will have opened to your
> face the gates of God and have fulfilled your desire to
> enter the Ark of the Generous One….

19. Risálih–i­Ghiná (the Treatise on Singing) was revealed

> in Isfahan and is in response to Sultánu’l­Zákirín, the
> reciter of the tragedies of Karbala. He had inquired
> regarding the permissibility of singing of melodies. In
> response the Báb writes, “From what may be gleaned
> from the “ahádith” (Traditions) the impermissibility of
> voice (raised in song) is due to its misdirected effects by
> those with corrupt inclinations. Otherwise if it does not
> promote sinfulness and does not overstep the bounds of
> propriety, then no religious prohibition has been
> specified.” This treatise is quite lengthy.
20. Risálih­i­Fiqhiyyih (Treatise on Religious Law) ­ This

> treatise, according to Nicolas and as related by Hasan
> Balyuzi, was revealed by the Báb in His youth when He
> was engaged as a merchant in Bushihr.
21. Tablet of Visitation of Sháh ‘Abdu’l­‘Azím was

revealed on the Báb’s sojourn in the village of Kulayn.

> 22. Súrih Tawhíd (Súrih of Unity)
23. Sahífih A’mál­al­Sunnatih (the Treatise on Acts of

> together, they would be helpless to generate even a
> single chapter like it.”41
24. Sahifat’ul­‘Adliyyih or Risálih­i­‘Adliyyih (Treatise on

> Justice) is about the beginning and end of all things.
> This book is different from the “Tablet of Justice” since
> in Risálih­i­‘Adliyyih, the Báb applies the title of “Book
> of Justice” to the Commentary on the Súrih of Joseph.
> “Tablet of Justice,” a work by Bahá’u’lláh, is addressed
> to Muhammad Ridá Shahmírzádí who was a Bábí and a

> of Bahá’u’lláh and became a believer in His Revelation.
25. Sahífih­i­Baynu’l­Haramayn or Sahífatu’l­Haramayn

> (Treatise between the two Shrines) is a response to the

32.   Kitábu’l­Rúh (the Book of Spirit) consists of seven

> hundred súrihs and has been referred to, in the book
> itself by the Báb, as the greatest of Books. This Book was
> revealed during His sojourn in Mecca.
33.   The Tablet of the Hurúfát (Tablet of the Letters) was

> revealed in Chihríq in honor of Asadu’lláh Khu‘í, titled
> Dayyán. Dayyán, having read the Tablet, remarked that
> if the Báb had only revealed this one single Tablet, it
> would have been sufficient evidence of His
> prophethood. Bahá’u’lláh, while in the Most Great
> Prison in Akká revealed a Tablet delineating the many
> illusions and mysteries contained in this work.
34.   Tablet of the Hayákil (Tablet of the Temples) contains

> 19 Temples, each of which has eleven lines, and each
> line numerically adds up to one of God’s names.
35.   Various other letters, tablets, treatises and

> commentaries, expositions, prayers, and tablets of
> visitations, the names of which appear in such works as
> Asráru’l­Áthár (Mystery of the Revealed Works), i.e.,

> the Day of Áshurá, the Treatise on Resurrection, the
> treatise written in Isfahan for Mírzá Hasan the historian,
> exposition of the Súrih of Qadr, numerous prayers for

> the days of the week and the morning prayer,
> Ziyáratu’l­Hurúf (Visitation of Letters), Public
> Visitation, and separate tablets of visitation for the
> Shiite Imams and the high ranking martyrs of the Bábí
> revelation, and tens of epistles, expositions,
> commentaries, visitation tablets and prayers all of
> which are penned by that exalted divine Legislator
> Himself or are sealed and signed by Him.

The lofty rank that all of these precious books and treatises
which have issued from the pen of the Báb occupy remains as
yet undisclosed. Perhaps some day scholars with pure hearts
and sanctified souls who are knowledgeable in spiritual verities
and possessed of powerful pens will emerge from behind the
invisible veil of God’s Will and will prove able and worthy to
shed light on these miraculous Writings.

Our intention, here, however, was to highlight the
astonishing and unmatched vastness of His Writings in
comparison with scriptures of the past. What is significant is
that all of these works comprise verses revealed through divine
inspiration. There are neither hearsay tales recounted by other
individuals nor personal accounts by anyone of the sayings or
acts of the divine manifestation or any reference to past
historical events.



Significantly, the one thing that stands out conspicuously in
the entire range of the Báb’s Writings and which through
frequent mention and emphasis is forced to the forefront of His
revelation is His glad­tidings regarding the appearance, in the
person of Bahá’u’lláh, of “Him whom God shall make
manifest.” It was already noted before that the Báb’s
announcement regarding the appearance of Bahá’u’lláh,
contrary to the allusions made by the entire company of former
prophets, whether major or minor regarding similar events, was
not revealed in implicit or mystical language but rather in clear,
explicit and unequivocal terms. The words of emphasis are so

numerous that it astonishes the mind, since employment of such
lucid language for such a pronouncement is unprecedented.

Therefore, rather than continuing with any further
definition of the subject, certain verses of the Bayán and other
works of the Báb will be presented here so that you may become
aware and appreciate the degree of emphasis the Báb employs
in order to herald the appearance of the Abhá Beauty:

1.   “…the intent of the essence of this chapter is not the

> Bayán unless it draws attention directly towards ‘Him
> whom God Shall make Manifest’. ”
2.   “O People of the Bayán: Do not commit what the people

> of Furqán (the Qur’an) committed and do not hide
> yourselves from the Beloved for the ascent of the Bayán
> is towards Him and the joy of His kingdom.”
3.   “Bayán will not be well pleased with you until you have

believed in‘Him whom God shall Make Manifest’.”
4.   “O People of the Bayán, if you believe in ‘Him Whom

> God Shall Make Manifest’, it is you who will profit by
> acquiring the gift of faith, otherwise He is independent
> of all things. For example if we place numerous mirrors
> in front of the sun, its light is reflected in them which
> tell of its existence, whereas the sun remains free from
> any association with the mirrors in which it is
> reflected.”
5.   “He is like the Sun in the heavens; His verses are His

> light and the believers are like mirrors in which the Sun
> appears.”
6.   “The Manifestation of God in each Dispensation who

> reflects the eternal Will has been and is the Glory of
> God before whose glory ‘All Things’ will be considered
> as non­existent.”
7.   And regarding His hidden and open declarations in the

> years of 9 and 19, He writes: “In the year nine you will
> come to every blessing.”
8.   He writes: “In the year nine your thirst for meeting God

will be quenched.”
9.   In a blessed tablet to ‘Azím, the Báb writes: “Bide your

> time until nine years have elapsed from the Bayán, then
> say ‘Blessed is the Lord who is the best of all Creators’.”

10. He also saith: “From the start of the revelation until the

> number of ‘unity’, be watchful.” (In the religion of the
> Bayán each ‘unity’ is equivalent to the numeral 19.
> Nineteen years after the declaration of the Báb,
> Bahá’u’lláh made his open declaration during Ridván,
> and in the year 9, He made his secret declaration in the
> Black Pit in Tihran.)
11. He also saith: “The Lord of the day of Faith will appear

> at the end of ‘unity’ and beginning of Thamánín.”
> (Unity in the Abjad numerology is 19, and Thamánín in
> Arabic is 80 and Bahá’u’lláh’s declaration took place in
> 1280 AH (Ridván of 1863 CE).
12. Also regarding the nearness of the day of revelation of

> the Promised One and that whenever it takes place, all
> must obey, He saith: “Be watchful of the time of
> revelation so that not a moment should separate those
> who are believers in the Bayán from their acceptance of
> the new revelation.”
13. He also saith: “None knoweth the time of the revelation

> but God. Whenever it comes, all must submit to the
> Point of Truth and praise the Lord.”
14. He also saith: “If He appears at this moment, I would be

the first servant to prostrate (Myself before Him).”
15. Again laying emphasis on the point that belief in the

> Bayán should not prevent anyone from recognizing
> God’s own manifestation and turn from light to fire, He
> saith: “No paradise is greater for any soul than the time
> of God’s revelation when he should recognize Him,
> understand His verses, profess his belief and attain His
> presence which is the presence of God and soar in the
> heavenly ocean of His good pleasure.”
16. He also saith: “O People of Bayán, do not do what the

> people of Furqán (Qur’an) did so that you may not
> nullify the fruits of the faith you garnered while you
> expected the new revelation.”
17. In báb 7 of the second unity of the Persian Bayán, He

> again saith: “O People of the Bayán, have pity on
> yourselves and do not nullify the merit of your long
> wait for the day of resurrection as did the heedless ones
> of the Qur’an who took pride in Islám for 1270 years

> and yet on the day of gathering the fruits of their Faith
> which was the day of resurrection, the judgment of
> “unfaithful to Islam” was issued against them….” (The
> meaning of the day of Resurrection is the day of the
> appearance of the Tree of Reality, and the duration of
> the Resurrection is from the onset of the dawning of the
> new revelation until the setting of Its sun. By the term
> “Tree of Reality,” the person of the Divine
> Manifestation is intended.
18.   And again He saith: “The Bayán and all that is therein

> should not keep you from that essence of existence and
> the possessor of the seen and the unseen.”
19.   And again He saith: If all the believers in the Bayán,

> declare their belief in ‘Him whom God Shall Make
> Manifest’, none will remain in the fire and the judgment
> of disbelief will not be passed against anyone.”
20.   In a blessed missive addressed to Mullá Báqir Tabrízí,

> the Letter of the living, and in response to his question
> which had also been inquired by the great Vahíd for
> whom an explanation had been revealed, in a copy of
> the same response He writes: “You recognized God,
> then recognize the One that the Lord will manifest who
> is greater and more exalted than to be perceived by
> those who are subservient to Him or be identified by
> testimonies of His creatures and verily I am the first
> servant to believe in Him and His verses.”
21.   And in this very missive, He also saith: “If it becomes

> clear that on the day of His appearance you would not
> profess your belief in Him, verily I shall seize from you
> your avowal of faith in this Dispensation since you have
> not been born except for Him; even if I find that a
> Christian has professed belief in Him, I would consider
> him as the apple of my eye and a believer in this
> revelation without any evidence that might witness to
> his faith. Thus if that soul in the day of revelation
> becomes a believer in Him, his worlds will turn into
> light but if a believer (in Me) remains heedless in that
> day his worlds will turn into fire.”
22.   He also saith: “Beware, beware lest in the day of

revelation you remain heedless on account of the

> Bayán’s ‘unity’ (reference to the Letters of the Living
> and to the Báb himself), as this ‘unity’ is but His
> creation. Beware, beware that you do not remain veiled
> (from His truth) because of the words of the Bayán as
> these words are His words in the temple of His former
> revelation. He is the Sun of Truth and the very face of
> Oneness, the heavenly countenance, the divine essence
> and His eternal self.”
23.   He also adds in this missive: “...Perchance in eight

> years, in the day of His revelation, you would attain to
> the presence of God; and thus if you failed to attain His
> presence at the dawn of revelation, you may attain it at
> its consummation.”
24.   And again He saith: “If, on the day of His Revelation, all

> that are on earth bear Him allegiance, Mine inmost
> being will rejoice, inasmuch as all will have attained the
> summit of their existence, and will have been brought
> face to face with their Beloved, and will have
> recognized, to the fullest extent attainable in the world
> of being, the splendor of Him Who is the Desire of their
> hearts. If not, My soul will indeed be saddened. I truly
> have nurtured all things for this purpose. How, then,
> can anyone be veiled from Him? For this have I called
> upon God, and will continue to call upon Him. He,
> verily, is nigh, ready to answer.”
25.   And expressing the degree of His humility and that of

> His Faith before the threshold of Bahá’u’lláh and the
> Abhá religion, He saith: “For all that hath been exalted
> in the Bayán is but as a ring upon My hand, and I
> Myself am, verily, but a ring upon the hand of Him
> Whom God shall make manifest—glorified be His
> mention! He turneth it as He pleaseth, for whatsoever
> He pleaseth, and through whatsoever He pleaseth. He,
> verily, is the Help in Peril, the Most High.”
26.   And again He saith: “O congregation of the Bayán and
all who are therein!

Recognize ye the limits imposed upon you, for such a
> One as the Point of the Bayán Himself hath believed in
> Him Whom God shall make manifest, before all things

> were created. Therein, verily, do I glory before all who
> are in the kingdom of heaven and earth.”
27.   And again He saith: “Today Bayán is in the stage of a

> seed. The dawn of the appearance of ‘He Whom God
> Shall Make Manifest’ is the consummation of the
> Bayán’s duration.”
28.   In the fifteenth báb of the third unity of the Persian

> Bayán, He saith: “the Manifestation of God in every
> revelation that is purposed by the Original Will, has
> been and is Bahá’u’lláh, before whom ‘all things’ is
> considered as nothing….he who declares his belief in
> ‘He Whom God Shall Make Manifest’ and His
> principles has believed in God from the beginning that
> has no beginning and has emerged under the shadow of
> His good pleasure and has achieved the merit of His
> good pleasure in each and all of His revelations. And he
> who does not profess belief in Him, even though he
> might have believed and achieved His good pleasure in
> all His worlds, all would be considered null and void.”
29.   And again in the sixteenth báb of the second unity He

> saith: “I swear by ‘He Whom God Shall Make Manifest’
> where no other oath before God is greater, that if He
> appears and even a single one remains in the Bayán, all
> punishment will be his lot….”
30.   And again He saith: “I counsel the people of the Bayán

> that if at the time of appearance of ‘He Whom God Shall
> Make Manifest’, all achieved the paradise of His
> nearness and attained His supreme presence then joy be
> unto you, joy be unto you, joy be unto you….”
31.   And again He saith: “…the Bayán, from the beginning

> to the end, is a testament to all of His attributes and the
> storehouse of His fire and His light.”
32.   He also saith: “The whole of the Bayán is but a leaf of

the leaves of His paradise.”
33.   And He also saith: “If you attain to His revelation and

> remain obedient you would have demonstrated the
> fruits of the Bayán, otherwise you would not be worthy
> of mention before God.”
34.   And again He saith:”No proof for Him or before anyone

is greater than His own Being as all the verses and

> words emanate from the ocean of His generosity, the
> sea of His grace and the illuminating rays of His
> Sun….”
35.   And He also saith: “If you but recite one verse of the

> verses of ‘He Whom God Shall Make Manifest’, it
> would be more praiseworthy than transcribing the
> entirety of the Bayán as that one verse will lead to your
> salvation whereas the whole of the Bayán will not.”
36.   And He also saith: “If a soul hears and recites a single

> verse of His, it would be better than reciting the Bayán a
> thousand times.”
37.   And He also saith: “The one year seed of the upcoming

> revelation is more potent than the whole of what is in
> the Bayán.”
38.   And He also saith: “Well is it with him who will witness

> to the order of Bahá’u’lláh and gives thanks (for the
> bounty).”
39.   And He also saith: “The whole of religion is but His

> triumph and not the deeds that have been revealed in
> the Bayán.”
40.   In Súrih of Joseph He saith: “O Thou Remnant of God! I

> have sacrificed myself wholly for Thee; I have accepted
> curses for Thy sake, and have yearned for naught but
> martyrdom in the path of Thy love. Sufficient witness
> unto me is God, the Exalted, the Protector, the Ancient
> of Days.”

The Báb’s glad tidings regarding the revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh are so clear and so numerous that the Pen of the
Most High itself bears witness to them: “In no other age or era,
has a former religion made mention of the appearance of the
subsequent Faith with such clarity and in such detail.”

– Part 3 –
Now let us consider the power and impact of the divinely
inspired Words revealed in this heavenly dispensation.
Contrary to what we observe in former revelations—where
some of the early believers argued with their prophets and
others expressed objections and doubts, some while claiming
loyalty did not believe His words, and others while professing
belief, yet, would not show obedience—in this Faith the effect of
the revealed scripture was so extraordinary that the
commentary of the Súrih of Joseph so disturbed and
overwhelmed Mullá Husayn that when he asked permission to
retire from the presence of the Báb, he was told: “If you take
your leave now, whoever sees you would say that this youth
has gone insane”; the commentary of Súrih of Kawthar so
enraptured Vahíd that he had to be revived by rose water
sprinkled on his face; a few verses of the commentary of Súrih
of Joseph confirmed the great Hujjat and dispatched him and
three thousand of his cohorts to the field of martyrdom; a single
tablet so enchanted and enthralled the great Dayyán that he
traveled the entire distance to Chihríq to visit the Báb on foot;
the work, ‘the Exclusive Prophethood’ so completely
transformed and magnetized Manúchihr Khán that he became
totally enraptured with the blessed Báb, and Khasá’il­i­Sab‘ih
(the Seven Qualifications) inspired Mullá Sádiq, such that in the
prevailing circumstances of time and place, he publicly and
loudly chanted the revised call to prayer which included open
reference to the new theophany and as recorded in the non­
Bahá’í history books, these wondrous and divinely inspired
words sent thousands of the lovers of the blessed Báb, willingly
and joyfully to the field of martyrdom the like of which has not
been seen in history.

And yet after the martyrdom of the Báb and the declaration
of the Abhá Beauty, these same heavenly Writings, each verse of
which caused such transformation and attraction, such awe and
rapture and which produced such devotees whose unbounded
love and self­sacrifice guided them to the field of martyrdom
suddenly seemed to lose that miraculous effect as though the
Báb, along with His own being had sacrificed the very fruits of

His divine revelation, His revealed words, and their powerful
influence in the path of Bahá’u’lláh.

In elucidation of this point and demonstration of the degree
of the influence of the divine verses in this glorious dispensation
and so that the conditions and attitudes of the early believers at
the time of the appearance of the Báb are more fully
appreciated, a brief comparative evaluation is undertaken
below.

As per the text of the Old Testament, in the Book of Exodus
when Moses returned from Mount Sinai to His people, the
Israelites, He discovered that His followers had fashioned a
golden calf that had become the subject of their worship. And
thus, aided by the members of the House of Levi to which He
belonged, Moses, in one day, killed three thousand of the
believers.

“And all the Levites rallied to him. He said to them, ‘Thus
says the Lord, the God of Israel: Each of you put sword on
thigh, go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp,
and slay brother, neighbor, and kin.’ The Levites did as Moses
had bidden and some three thousand of the people fell that
day.” (Exodus 32: 27–29). This is a sample of the spiritual
maturity and devotion of the people who believed in Moses at
the time of appearance.

Jesus Christ, at the time of His martyrdom had some 150

believers of whom 12 were the disciples, Peter, Andrew, Simon,
James, Judas, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, John, and Thomas.
It was Judas who, despite Jesus’ knowledge of his intent,
revealed His hiding place for a few pieces of silver leading to
His arrest and crucifixion. The rest of the disciples at the time of
Jesus’ arrest and trial fled the area, and Peter who was the first
to believe in Him and whom Jesus had chosen as the foundation
upon which to build His church, on the night of the crucifixion,
denied Him three times and even took an oath that he did not
know Him and went so far as cursing His name. And it was not
until the second “crowing of the cock” that he remembered

Jesus’ remark that until that second “crowing of the cock” you
will have denied me three times. He then went out and wept.42

This too is an example of the faith and devotion of the early
Christian believers at the time of Jesus.

Regarding the believers in Muhammad and the unseemly
conduct of some of them against the prophet, though supported
by the Qur’an and the credible traditions of both Sunni and
Shia, I will withhold comments since if misunderstood it could
result in the martyrdom of a few other innocent friends or the
imprisonment of a group of blameless and obedient believers.
Otherwise reference, supported by historical evidence, may
easily be made of assorted cases of disobedience of a number of
the believers to the instructions of the Messenger of God, a few

There was immediate disagreement among the rank of the
believers. Some insisted that Muhammad should be given the
chance to write down such instructions that would prevent the
believers from being misguided in the future. Others did not see
the necessity for this and considered the Book of God as
complete and final. Witnessing the argument, Muhammad

43 M. H. Haykal, Life of Muhammad, translated by A. Payandeh, p. 458.

asked them to leave and added that it was not seemly to quarrel
in the presence of the Prophet of God.

After this event Ibn­i­‘Abbás felt that the Muslims, by
denying the Prophet the opportunity to write His last thoughts,
destroyed something very important, but Omar remained
adamant and contended that the verse in the Qur’an which says:
“We have verily not fallen short in revealing the Word is
adequate proof of the completeness of divine instructions.”44

But in the blessed revelation of the Primal Point (the Báb),
thousand of believers, with unbounded courage and in the path
of His love, sacrificed their lives in the field of martyrdom,
stories of whose heroic deeds are recorded in non­Bahá’í
accounts as well.

1.   Watson, the author of the History of the Qájár writes:

> “The Bábís confronted their destiny with fearless power

his life.…Then they martyred both sons of the Bábí.

He also writes that they suspended, upside down, a
> Bábí from the top of the city wall and as he approached
> death he was heard whispering: “O, my beloved, have I
gained Thy good pleasure?”

In God Passes By, the beloved Guardian quotes a

3.   “Renan writes: thousands came to the field of sacrifice,

4.   Browne writes: “A shining example of the power of

5.   Professor J. Darmushteter writes: “The Bábí Faith that

6.   Lord Curzon writes: “In the blood­stained pages of Bábí

7. Count de Gobineau writes: “I must admit that if I had

These and hundreds of similar events as testified by non­
Bahá’í sources bear witness to the greatness of the faith and
devotion of the Bábís and only a few were quoted here since

> Lovers’ secrets are better revealed
> By others’ chronicles of events and deeds

Otherwise, you beloved of God are all well aware of the
epic events of Tabarsi, Zanján, Niyríz, Yazd, Tihran and
Khurásán, Isfahan, and other cities of Iran. Praised be God, how
numerous the number of the lovers who danced to the field of
sacrifice and offered sweet pastry among the onlookers, how
many of them asked the executioner to let them be first, and

49 Imam Husayn was martyred in Karbala.

how many who tried to ease the executioner’s conscience of his
misgivings in committing such horrible acts, how many who
kissed the executioner’s hand and chanted songs of love, all of
whom as attested by Bahá’u’lláh gave their lives and yet did not
utter a single unseemly word. Their most sublime example was
Anís who in the field of sacrifice placed his head upon the
breast of His incomparable Beloved so that his head may receive
the volley of the bullets.

The best Beloved, the Primal Point and the exalted Lord, the
Báb who had sent thousands of God intoxicated lovers of His
beauty to the field of martyrdom, Himself led the field and
placed His breast before hundreds of bullets, and thus sacrificed
His blessed Self as well as the majestic power and influence of
the religion of Bayán, its most renowned and distinguished
believers, its elder cast, and His most eminent companions and
devotees, utterly and unreservedly, all in the path of the
Remnant of God, the Abhá Beauty, the Promised One of all
Faiths, the Desired One of all humankind, the Beloved of hearts
and Subject of love and devotion of all who are endowed with
the gift of faith, Bahá’u’lláh.

So all­embracing was this act of sacrifice that after the
revelation of Bahá’u’lláh and except for certain laws such as
sanctioning interest on money, limiting the size of dowry,
instituting the Right of God, the waiting period prior to divorce,
kindness to animals, proscription in carrying firearms,
prohibition of confessing of sin to any individual, banning of
ascending pulpits, prohibition of congregational prayer except
for the prayer for the dead, and others which now as part of the
Aqdas form the laws of the Bahá’í Faith, a religion known as the
Bábí Faith, ceased to exist. None remained from His devoted
followers and self­sacrificing believers, and no trace of the
supernatural influence of its divine teachings endured; all of
which vanished or reappeared in the supreme religion of
Bahá’u’lláh, except for its matchless history and grandeur, and
tale of its imperishable and heroic episodes which became
timeless and shone better and brighter than any other historical
spectacle; it was inscribed in the memory of the friends and
stored safe in the heart of its lovers and recorded in the works of
writers and documented in the books of historians.

The world of love found a new song and the lovers’
minstrel discovered a new melody. Sacrifice became the secret
of true life and evanescence lead to glory; the world of dust
became illumined and the God’s kingdoms shone brightly by
the heavenly light of so many pure souls….

This tale is unfinished. It is a story of love, eternal and
everlasting….what was recounted was merely a passing glance.
