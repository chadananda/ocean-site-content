ardor of the active BahL'i workers them-
selves.

"The Bahgis everywhere looked forward
to his coming, and prepared meetings for
him . . ." one of his contemporaries has
written.

The year 1907 marked the greatest expe-
rience in the formative years of his BahL'i
life. In April of that year Roy Wilhelm, ac-
companied by his mother, went on a pil-
grimage to attain the presence of 'Abdu'l-
BahL at 'AkkB in the Holy Land. The words
of welcome uttered by 'Abdu'l-BahL, as
translated into English, were written down
by Mr. Wilhelm immediately afterward and
quoted in a letter written to his fellow Ba-
hL'i teacher, Mrs. Mariam Haney: "Wel-
come! Very welcome! I have been waiting
for your coming. It is with God's help that
you have reached 'AkkL . . . You repre-
sent all the American believers . . . Thank
God that you came."

The following year Roy Wilhelm pre-
pared a.nd distributed a booklet recounting
his pilgrimage, which he entitled "Knock,
and it shall be ovened unto vou. (Matt.
7:7) ." On the fro& cover w a i reproduced                     Roy C. Wilhelm.

He brought them too a new understanding
of the Hands of the Cause and a clearer ap-

Fred had a deep affection for the friends
in India. He had been eagerly looking for-
ward to attending the New Delhi Confer-

Montreal at 9:30 A.M. on Monday, July 27,
1953, after a few days' illness.

The funeral service was conducted by the
Canadian National Spiritual Assembly in
Montreal on July 31. Burial was made, at
the Guardian's request, close to the grave of
Sutherland Maxwell, the first Canadian
Hand of the Cause. On August 23, the
Montreal Assembly arranged a memorial
service in the Maxwell Home which was
attended by members of the National As-

its spiritual source; in the region of the soul
through that purest evidence of faith which
the human spirit can manifest: an immedi-

and a life wholly devoted to Him.

"Saffa was so human," said a friend after
he passed from this life into that other
where his heart was centered. And perhaps
when we think of him now, we think first
of that endearing humanness of his-fiery
and rash and vigorous and with a rollicking
sense of humor. But, above and beyond his
temperament and character was his power
of love, caught directly from the heart of
'Abdu'l-BahL, on whom his heart was so
passionately fixed.

to assist in all these arrangements for

An outstanding event in the Bahi'i his-
tory of the West was the convoking of the
first "International Bah6'i Congress" in con-
junction with the Panama-Pacific Interna-
tional Exposition in the spring of 1915 in
San Francisco. Mrs. Cooper, her mother
and several other Bahi'is who formed the
executive committee of the Congress had
approached 'Abdu'l-BahL with their desire
to hold such a Congress during the Panama-
Pacific International Exposition, and
'Abdu'l-BahL had approved and selected the
BahL'i spealters who were men of note in
their professions and also Bahi'is of long
and eminent service. The Congress was held
April 19 through 25 and attracted large
audiences to hear the Bah6'i teachings on
peace.

ness, and let the village be used for intrigues
against the BahL'is.

It was on Tuesday night on the 26th of
August 1952 at 9 P.M. when he went there
as a kind father for their guidance that he
was met by a fanatical mob, and was put
to death in a most cruel way, thus adding his
name to the immortal list of martyrs who
have given their lives for the glory of the
Cause.

News of his death came as a shock to the
Bah6'i world. His funeral was attended both
by BahB'is and non-Bahb'is. Memorial serv-
ices, worthy of his station, were held by
Bahi'i communities. One service was spe-
cially held by the National Spiritual Assem-
bly of l r i n as instructed by the Guardian.
Many telegrams and consoling letters were
received from all over the world.

His body was interred at the north section
of the Bahb'i cemetery in Tihrin, and the
beloved Guardian gave instructions for his
tomb to be erected on his behalf.

In conclusion I quote the cablegram of
the Guardian on this grievous occasion:

FLORENCE BREED KHAN

Florence LhLnum was the daughter of a
prominent New England manufacturer,
Ffancis W. Breed. She was brought up on
the family estate in Lynn, Massachusetts.
Later she attended finishing schools in Bos-
ton and New York, traveled in Europe, and
made her social debut in Chicago at the
home of Mrs. Potter Palmer. Newspaper
accounts of the time described her popular-
ity and beauty.

Early tragedies, including her betrothal as
he lay on his deathbed, to the poet Philip
Henry Savage, and her father's loss of for-
tune, turned her mind toward serious things.
She began to study mysticism, dramatics
and art and it was in the course of these
studies that she met the lecturer and critic,
Mary Hanford Ford. About this time Mrs.
Ford visited Green Acre, Eliot, Maine,
where she attended classes conducted by
Mirzi Abu'l-Fad1 and Ali-Kuli Khan and
became a BahB'i.                                               Florence Breed Khan.

RahmAn Kulayni was born in the county
of Mamaqkn where he acquired his elemen-
tary education. He started as a tailor in the
same county and as he was very sociable
and kind soon his workshop became a cen-
ter for the gathering of the educated Bahi'i
and non-Bahi'i youth. Although he was not
more than 25, his vigilance and alertness
brought him into contact with the elder
men who welcomed him for his traits. He
often acted as an arbitrator in many dis-
putes brought to him by Bahi'is and non-
Bahi'is and always lent a hand in benevo-
lent affairs and religious ceremonies on the
mourning days of Muharram. In 1935 a Ba-
hi'i youth who had great appreciation for
the traits and virtues of Rahmkn Kulayni
took him to a Bahi'i meeting. Then he be-
came interested in associating more with the
Bahi'is. His ever-increasing interest in the
Faith was mostly due to the good conduct
of the BahB'is around him and not to the
authentic proofs or traditions of the Faith.

the auditorium was erected. "Pullman

into-single private rooms on the first floor

that proved inadequate to house the number
of believers and friends the second year.
Lou met this challenge by turning the im-
mense hayloft of the second barn into two
floors of rooms and by building several one-
room cabins in the trees near the main
house.

Before the first session Lou and Helen
Eggleston had written to Shoghi Effendi for
advice, and his suggestions and approval
of courses were their guide each year. The
National Assembly appointed a Program
Committee, but the Egglestons carried the
financial burden of maintenance and devel-
opment until 1948 when they deeded over
the school buildings and nine acres of the
property to the National Spiritual Assembly.

Housing and feeding those attending the
sessions became a full-time job. By the time
