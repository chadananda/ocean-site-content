Foreword

Some 90 youth from 25 countries, mainly European, participated
in the last of the three World Order courses given at Acuto
during the month of February 2006.

The purpose of this course was to consider the wide range of
the works of Shoghi Effendi, both in English and in Persian/
Arabic, and cast a panoramic and cursory glance over the
contents of each of his major writings. The beloved Guardian, in
the course of his blessed ministry, provided the friends and the
general public with a reliable survey of the significant and
historical Bahá’í events of the Heroic Age, an overview of the
stages enabling the current Administrative Order of the Faith to
become the nucleus and pattern of the future institutions of world
society, and a unique and authentic translation into English of the
fundamental Writings of the Founder of the Faith. Through the
power of his inspired pen Shoghi Effendi also succeeded in
carrying the Community of the Most Great Name from its
modest and rudimentary beginnings to a stage of development
enabling it to be a potent instrument, well-equipped to realize
and put into effect the exalted ideals which distinguish the
divine message of Bahá’u’lláh.

Introduction
Violette and I lived as adult Bahá’ís during the period of the
Guardianship. We had the privilege of being in Shoghi Effendi’s
presence, meeting him and listening to him in Haifa. We had the
joy of participating in his plans. I hope to be able to convey to
you something of the station of Shoghi Effendi, his personality,
the power of his pen, and the influence that he has had on the
Bahá’í community.

It is impossible to make any study of the writings of the Head
of a religion without arriving first at an understanding, however
inadequate, of the functions of the occupant of that office and the
scope of the authority conferred upon him. It is important to ap-
preciate that Shoghi Effendi’s entire literary output was devoted
to matters related to the Faith.

The Faith during the time of Shoghi Effendi was in its
infancy. I am sorry to say it, but we are still very immature.
Shoghi Effendi often referred to the immaturity of the Bahá’í
community. He was like a champion tennis player. He was the
champion of the the world and was faced with children who like
to play some tennis. He stood there and taught us how to hold the
racket and how to hit the ball. We thought he was another adult
Bahá’í, except that he was related to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Bahá’u’lláh
and the Báb through his lineage. We really did not know who he
was. In fact, Shoghi Effendi seems to have even concealed his
own true station.

The institution of the Guardianship was created by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá through the provisions of His Will and Testament. His half-
brother, Muḥammad-‘Alí, who was to succeed Him, had dis-
qualified himself by breaking the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh, thus
placing himself outside the pale of the Faith. This matter became

SHOGHI EFFENDI: THE RANGE AND POWER OF HIS PEN

clearly evident to the generality of the friends when ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá was asked what was then to be expected after His passing.
He replied: ‘As to the question ye have asked me, know verily
that this is a well-guarded secret. It is even as a gem concealed
within its shell. That it will be revealed is predestined. The time
will come when its light will appear, when its evidences will be
made manifest, and its secrets unraveled’ (WOB 150).

This secret was disclosed when the Will and Testament of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was read. The friends became aware that Shoghi
Effendi was to be the Successor, as he was ‘the Light that after
My passing shineth from the Dayspring of Divine Guidance’
(WTA 3). He is also referred to as ‘that primal branch’ (WTA
3), ‘the blest and sacred bough’ (WTA 3), ‘the sign of God, the
chosen branch, the guardian of the Cause of God, he unto whom
all . . . His loved ones must turn. He is the expounder of the
words of God’ (WTA 11).

‘Abdu’l-Bahá goes on to say, ‘The sacred and youthful
Branch [is] . . . under the care and protection of the Abhá
Beauty, [and] under the shelter and unerring guidance of His
Holiness, the Exalted One [the Báb] . . . Whoso obeyeth him not
. . . hath not obeyed God . . . Whoso disbelieveth in him hath
disbelieved in God; whoso deviateth, separateth himself and
turneth aside from him hath in truth deviated, separated himself
and turned aside from God’ (WTA 11). As a crowning statement
we read this ringing call: ‘Well is it with him that seeketh the
shelter of his shade that shadoweth all mankind’ (WTA 3). It
became clear therefore that such interpretations of the Writings
of Bahá’u’lláh as were given by the pen or at the instruction of
Shoghi Effendi, just like the interpretations written by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, were to be regarded as being as binding, in terms of their
validity, as Bahá’u’lláh’s sacred Text.

It is in this light that the Universal House of Justice chose to
include in the introductory paragraphs of its Constitution the
following statement: ‘The provenance, the authority, the duties,
the sphere of action of the Universal House of Justice all derive

\[2\] INTRODUCTION

from the revealed Word of Bahá’u’lláh which, together with the
interpretations and expositions of the Centre of the Covenant and
of the Guardian of the Cause – who, after ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, is the
sole authority in the interpretation of Bahá’í scripture – con-
stitute the binding terms of reference of the Universal House of
Justice and are its bedrock foundation’ (CUHJ 4). The Bahá’í
world has had thirty-nine years of Scripture revealed by
Bahá’u’lláh and a total of sixty-five years of inspired interpret-
ation by His two Authorized Interpreters.

It must be remembered that, with the passing of Shoghi
Effendi, authorized interpretation of Bahá’í scripture came to an
end. However, this does not mean that individual interpretations,
provided they are labelled as such, are forbidden. On the con-
trary, these are encouraged and regarded as a healthy exercise,
mentally and spiritually, in our continuous strivings to study our
teachings with a ‘searching eye’ (TB 157).

In this connection the Universal House of Justice has written:
‘A clear distinction is made in our Faith between authoritative
interpretation and the interpretation or understanding that each
individual arrives at for himself from his study of its teachings.
While the former is confined to the Guardian, the latter, accord-
ing to the guidance given to us by the Guardian himself, should
by no means be suppressed. In fact such individual interpretation
is considered the fruit of man’s rational power and conducive to
a better understanding of the teachings, provided that no disputes
or arguments arise among the friends and the individual himself
understands and makes it clear that his views are merely his own.
Individual interpretations continually change as one grows in
comprehension of the teachings. As Shoghi Effendi explained:
“. . . The more we read the Writings, the more truths we can find
in them and the more we will see that our previous notions were
erroneous”’ (MUHJ 88).

In the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh refers to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
in at least two verses. The first verse is well known: ‘When
the ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the Book of My

SHOGHI EFFENDI: THE RANGE AND POWER OF HIS PEN

Revelation is ended, turn your faces toward Him Whom God
hath purposed, Who hath branched from this Ancient Root’ (KA
¶121). In the Kitáb-i-‘Ahd, Bahá’u’lláh refers to this verse and
comments, ‘The object of this sacred verse is none other except
the Most Mighty Branch [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]’ (TB 221).

In the second verse we read the following concerning the
interpretation of Bahá’u’lláh’s own Writings: ‘When the Mystic
Dove will have winged its flight from its Sanctuary of Praise and
sought its far-off goal, its hidden habitation, refer ye whatsoever
ye understand not in the Book to Him Who hath branched from
this mighty Stock’ (KA ¶174). This verse of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
envisages a situation where a question is put to the Branch of the
Sacred Lote Tree for interpretation. The Branch – we can assume
that the Branch applies not only to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, but could be
applicable to Shoghi Effendi as well – would then interpret and
explain what was not clearly understood from the text of the
Holy Writ. The Guardianship, we could well say, was thus indir-
ectly anticipated in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.

One of the Bahá’ís, who later became a martyr, ‘Alí-
Muḥammad Varqá, (the grandfather of our present Hand of the
Cause, Dr Varqá) wrote to Bahá’u’lláh, saying that he under-
stood the first verse, but not the second. Bahá’u’lláh answered
him in a Tablet which exists at the Bahá’í World Centre.
Bahá’u’lláh did not say it meant only ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, nor did He
say that it referred to all of the future Branches. What He
actually stated was that He meant ‘two Branches’. What
Bahá’u’lláh had in mind was not something perpetual. For auth-
orized interpretation He had two Branches in mind. At that time,
everyone thought that the second Branch was Muḥammad-‘Alí
because he was the Greater Branch, while ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was
known as the Most Great Branch. However, after the passing of
Bahá’u’lláh, Muḥammad-‘Alí broke the Covenant. The mystery
is that Bahá’u’lláh included Muḥammad-‘Alí in the Kitáb-i-‘Ahd
as a successor to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Surely He knew what was to
become of him. Why did Bahá’u’lláh still put him in His Will?

\[4\] INTRODUCTION

The same question can be asked of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Why did He
mention successors to Shoghi Effendi if He knew that there
weren’t going to be any?

The wonderful thing is that Shoghi Effendi makes a
remarkable point in ‘The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh’. He
writes: ‘A study of the provisions of these sacred documents will
reveal the close relationship that exists between them, as well as
the identity of purpose and method which they inculcate’ (WOB
4). In other words, the method used by Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-
i-‘Ahd was also used by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Will and Testa-
ment. They used the same method. It was, we could well assume,
for the testing of the believers, in order to see who would stay
firm in the Covenant and who would waver. We could conclude
that they knew what was going to happen, yet they put such
stipulations in their Wills, quite probably, as I said, for the
purpose of testing the believers.

In The Priceless Pearl, written by Rúḥíyyih Khánum, we
read about the memoirs of Dr Falscheer, a German doctor in
Haifa. She was in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá when Shoghi
Effendi came into the room as a young boy. He went out after
paying his respects to his Grandfather, and then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
tells Dr Falscheer: ‘Before His ascension into eternal Light

the blessed Manifestation reminded me that I too – irrespective
of primogeniture or age – must observe among my sons and
grandsons whom God would indicate for His office’ (PP 12). It
becomes clear that Bahá’u’lláh knew that His second son,
Muḥammad-‘Alí, would not be faithful to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and
so He told the Master that He would have to choose another
Branch as His successor. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had no sons to appoint,
so He chose Shoghi Effendi, His grandson.

With reference to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Bahá’u’lláh has made
statements to unveil the station of the Most Great Branch. He
states, for example: ‘We pray God to illumine the world through
Thy knowledge and wisdom’ (WOB 135); ‘Render thanks
unto God . . . for . . . through Him every mouldering bone is

SHOGHI EFFENDI: THE RANGE AND POWER OF HIS PEN

quickened. Whoso turneth towards Him hath turned towards God
. . .’ (WOB 135).

Thus, we see that in addition to answering queries calling for
the interpretation of the Holy Writ, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was also
destined to illumine the world through His knowledge and wis-
dom. The same two aspects are also seen in the writings of
Shoghi Effendi. He would write in response to specific ques-
tions, as well as when he was moved to give his explanations of
the verities of the Faith, his analyses of the conditions in the
world, his description of the stages that the Faith and the world
must traverse in order to attain their respective states of maturity,
and his exposition of the vision of the future Bahá’í civilization.

It should be of interest to us that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá chose to
define His own function as ‘Interpreter’ of Bahá’u’lláh’s Writ-
ings. The word He used was ‘Mubayyín’. The function of a
Mubayyín is ‘tabyín’ (pronounced ‘tabyeen’) which means
interpretation. The two words ‘Interpreter’ and ‘Mubayyín’,
particularly in Persian/Arabic, have both a restrictive meaning
and a broad one. The restrictive sense is when the meaning of a
specific sacred text is disclosed in clearer terms, while the
broader application is when an unprompted exposition is made of
the implications of the revealed statements. It is highly note-
worthy that Shoghi Effendi, in translating the word ‘Mubayyín’,
uses two terms, namely ‘interpreter’ and ‘expounder’ (WTA 11).
‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote inspired treatises such as A Traveller’s
Narrative and The Secret of Divine Civilization without being
asked. They were unsolicited, as were all of the talks He gave
during His travels to the West. Shoghi Effendi also wrote, as just
stated, many things that were not in response to direct questions.

When a mandate or authority is assigned to an office or an
institution in the Cause, we must be sure that the capacity and
power to execute that mandate is also bestowed. In defining his
own function as a ‘Mubayyín’, the Guardian wrote: ‘[T]he
Guardian has been specifically endowed with such power as he
may need to reveal the purport and disclose the implications of

\[6\] INTRODUCTION

the utterances of Bahá’u’lláh and of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ (WOB 151).
He is, in fact, telling us that he could read the Mind of
Bahá’u’lláh and that of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

He has also added that such a power enables him ‘to take a
long, an uninterrupted view over a series of generations’ (WOB
148). In other words, Shoghi Effendi could see how the Faith
was going to advance and he could visualize how the world
would develop over a series of generations. God had given him
the power to do this. These are verities that Shoghi Effendi has
recorded in ‘The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh’. But he has almost
concealed them in such a way that the reader does not realize that
they are right there. This is why I mentioned that he seems to be
concealing his own true station.

Furthermore, in a letter dated 4 March 1948, written on his
behalf, in which Shoghi Effendi is commenting on the import-
ance of sending full reports of Bahá’í troublesome difficulties,
we read the following: ‘[H]e often senses a situation or condi-
tion without having any detailed knowledge of it’ (UD 449).
Does an ordinary person have this kind of perception? He,
nevertheless, has added that full reports must be sent anyway.

In Some Answered Questions, there is a chapter about
infallibility. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that there are two kinds, essential
infallibility and acquired or conferred infallibility. The possessor
of essential infallibility has the power of revelation, while the
possessor of conferred infallibility receives inspiration. He
explains this truth by using the Sun as an example. The Sun does
not have to acquire its light from another source; it has essential
light. The Moon, however, receives its light from the Sun; it has
conferred light. According to this metaphor, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is the
Moon, which receives light, or inspiration, from the Manifest-
ation of God. Shoghi Effendi would have been horrified if we
said that he was a second Moon. Bahá’u’lláh has given to
‘Abdu’l-Bahá the title of ‘Him round Whom all names revolve’
(TB 225). Therefore, Shoghi Effendi regarded himself as a
satellite, revolving around the Moon, the Centre of the Covenant.

SHOGHI EFFENDI: THE RANGE AND POWER OF HIS PEN

This satellite received light directly from the Sun, for it is written
in the Will and Testament that ‘The sacred and youthful branch,
the Guardian of the Cause of God, as well as the Universal
House of Justice to be universally elected and established, are
both under the care and protection of the Abhá Beauty, under the
shelter and unerring guidance of the Exalted One’ (WTA 11).
Accordingly, the Universal House of Justice is another, separate
satellite, receiving inspiration and guidance directly from the Sun
of this Dispensation.

Indeed, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Some Answered Questions, while
commenting on the nature of ‘acquired or conferred infallibility’,
succinctly points out that if God does not protect the vehicle
chosen for such infallibility it would be neither ‘fitting nor
worthy of God’ (SAQ 172). This means that it would be
unworthy of God, if He did not send His illumination, His
inspiration, His direction, His guidance to the individual or
institution which we are required to obey, be it ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
Shoghi Effendi or the Universal House of Justice.

The Cause will be the object of opposition and of attacks by
enemies of the Faith, both internally and externally, and we have
to know how to defend the Cause. We have to understand that
the foundation of the Cause is on very strong and firm grounds –
unassailably firm. And this is why ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that the
power of the Covenant is the axis, the pivot of the oneness of
mankind. The oneness of mankind is the principle that all
humanity is one and all the races are one. This concept has a
pivot. That pivot is the power of the Covenant. He puts the two
together, the Covenant and the oneness of humanity. In this
Cause the Covenant has a pivot and the pivotal centre today is
the Universal House of Justice. The reason why we know that
there will be unity in the world is because of the institution of the
Universal House of Justice, the focal centre of the Faith. This
centre is set on a firm foundation in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the Most
Holy Book, the Mother Book of the Bahá’í Revelation. No one
can ever change it. If the enemies of the Faith want to attack the

Covenant, they may try but they shall not succeed. It is strongly
and firmly grounded. It is the Instrument that will bring about the
final Most Great Peace and the Bahá’í World Civilization. The
more you think about it, the more you will understand it, the
more you will be able to defend it, and the greater will be your
services to the Cause in the future.

Outline of contents

The number of communications and/or titles authored by Shoghi
Effendi during his ministry consists of 11,345 items in English,
12,308 items in Persian/Arabic, and over 9,000 cabled messages,
making a grand total of more than 32,000 items. These figures
have been released by the World Centre and represent such items
as the Archives Office has in its possession. The numbers are
periodically revised as more items are found and sent to the
World Centre.

The above figures, particularly those in English, include such
titles as God Passes By, ‘The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh’ and
‘The Unfoldment of World Civilization’. These publications,
although they are lengthy, are counted as one item each. In con-
trast, a letter of encouragement to an individual believer of one
or two paragraphs is also reckoned as one item. As to his cables
– some are brief, others may run into a number of pages. This is
especially true when the postal service was uncertain and Shoghi
Effendi felt that a cabled message would be a safer and faster
method of communication. Items of correspondence from Shoghi
Effendi also include letters written on his behalf by his
secretaries.

As the table of Contents, indicates the present material covers
Shoghi Effendi’s pre-Guardianship period, his translations of
sacred and other texts, his own major works in English, his
writings in Persian and Arabic, some sundry comments and a
conclusion.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. How can we systematically and realistically increase our
love for Shoghi Effendi?

A. Two things are important: we should learn more about Shoghi
Effendi’s life. The best and most comprehensive book to read on
the subject is The Priceless Pearl, the gift of Rúḥíyyih Khánum
to the Bahá’í world. Every one of us should read this book and,
through it, get closer to the spirit of Shoghi Effendi. We should
also read Shoghi Effendi’s own writings. You should not
consider his writings as you would consider an article in the
newspaper. You read the paper and then you throw it away, but
his writings are something that should remain with you for your
entire life. There are many meanings and implications in the
writings of Shoghi Effendi. As we read them prayerfully, we try
to understand the intent of what he has written. We will thus get
closer to the spirit of Shoghi Effendi, and will love him ever
more.

Q. The statement of Bahá’u’lláh regarding the two Branches
in His Tablet to ‘Alí-Mu%ammad Varqá seems to provide
evidence that there will be no future Guardian after Shoghi
Effendi. In reading the letters of the Universal House of
Justice about this subject, I have not found any reference to
this Tablet. Is this the case and why? Was this reference
brought to the attention of Mason Remey when he was
consulting with the Custodians?

A. Neither the Hands of the Cause nor the House of Justice
found it necessary to refer to this particular Tablet. Everything
was very clear already. Mr Remey was probably not aware of
this Tablet.

\[10\] INTRODUCTION

Q. When considering the beloved Guardian as the central
pivot of the Covenant, would you consider him to be the
pivot of the Lesser Covenant or of the Greater Covenant?

A. According to Shoghi Effendi, the Greater Covenant is the
Covenant that each Manifestation makes with His followers that
there will be a future Manifestation and that they must recognize
Him. The Lesser Covenant is within each Dispensation. It is a
Covenant about loyalty to the Successor or Successors of the
Manifestation. When we talk about Shoghi Effendi or the
Universal House of Justice as central pivots of the Covenant, we
are referring to the Lesser Covenant.

Q. What are your feelings about the period from 1957 to
1963, between the Guardian’s passing and the election of the
first Universal House of Justice?

A. This was a difficult period. It was overshadowed by grief for
the loss of Shoghi Effendi. There were no doubts in the minds of
Bahá’ís that for the period in question the direction of the Faith
should be left to the Hands of the Cause. Nevertheless, there was
a feeling of loss. We had people at the helm who had been
appointed by Shoghi Effendi, yet there was a feeling that we had
lost the source of infallible guidance. The Hands were telling us
that they were not an infallible body. However, there was also a
positive side. There was a deep feeling throughout the whole
Bahá’í world that the only and best thing the friends could do
was to carry out the last wishes of Shoghi Effendi, and to show
their loyalty to him by making greater efforts to win the Ten
Year Crusade. The number of pioneers that left their homes after
the passing of Shoghi Effendi far surpassed the number that left
before it. His passing had released powerful energies within the
hearts of the friends. It may be that God had ordained for Shoghi

Effendi to die at the midway point of the Crusade in order to
create a new desire in the friends to make sacrifices for him.

The Hands wrote a letter to the Bahá’í world that clearly
stated that Shoghi Effendi had not appointed a successor as
Guardian and that he had not left a will. Every conscientious
believer thought very deeply about what would happen. There
were many questions and opinions but the friends had to put
them aside and wait for the Universal House of Justice. In 1958
the Hands wrote to the friends, ‘We call upon all the believers
. . . to desist from all further speculation on the future develop-
ment of the institutions of the Faith – speculation which can only
give rise to those very differences of interpretation forbidden by
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and against which they repea-
tedly warned us’ (MoC 101). They wanted us to remain united so
that we could carry out the Plan at hand.

Q. What exactly did you mean when you said that the
interpretations of the Guardian are binding in terms of their
validity?

A. They are interpretations by the authorized Interpreter and
Expounder of the Faith. They are binding on us and cannot be
disregarded, unlike, say, a pilgrim’s note or an interpretation by a
distinguished Bahá’í, which are not at all binding.

Q. Was Shoghi Effendi only infallible when he was
interpreting? Is it possible that statements he made about the
future will not be fulfilled? A fellow in my home community
believes that the answer to these questions is yes in both
cases. What do you think?

A. Nowhere in the Writings, does it say that Shoghi Effendi was
inspired, infallible and in receipt of divine guidance only when
he was interpreting. The contrary is true. Referring to the House
of Justice and the Guardian, it is written that ‘Whatsoever they

\[12\] INTRODUCTION

decide is of God’ (WTA 11). This is the opposite of limiting his
divine guidance to interpretation alone. He himself has written,
in ‘The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh’, that he has been given the
power to view developments over several generations. The idea
that Shoghi Effendi was only guided when he was interpreting,
or that the Universal House of Justice is only guided when it is
legislating, is wrong. We have to be 100 per cent sure that both
Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice are under the
protection of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. This is the reason why
this Faith is so well founded and firmly established. This is why
it is that this Faith that can establish the unity of the world and
the Most Great Peace and inaugurate the world civilization.

Q. Can you please comment on the infallibility of Shoghi
Effendi in relation to the letter written on his behalf to a
believer dated 17 October 1944, saying ‘The infallibility of the
Guardian is confined to matters which are related strictly to the
Cause and interpretation of the teachings; he is not an
infallible authority on other subjects, such as economics,
science, etc. When he feels that a certain thing is essential for
the protection of the Cause, even if it is something that affects a
person personally, he must be obeyed, but when he gives
advice, such as that he gave you in a previous letter about your
future, it is not binding; you are free to follow it or not as you
please’ (MUHJ 546, n.1)?

A. This letter makes a distinction between two points. Let us
suppose that the Guardian has told one of the friends that his
presence in a particular town or city is detrimental to the interests
of the Cause and that he instructs him to move somewhere else.
This is, in fact, what happened when the Guardian asked local
Bahá’ís in Haifa to settle somewhere else. An instruction of this
kind from the Guardian must be unquestionably obeyed, because
it was issued for the sake of the protection of the Cause.

Let us suppose, on the other hand, that an individual asked
for the Guardian’s advice on where he should pioneer to or what
subjects he should study at university. In such instances, the
advice he gave was not binding and the believer was free to
follow the advice or not.

Q. The Universal House of Justice clearly indicates that it is
not invested with the power of interpreting the Writings.
Why is it, then, that Bahá’ís write to the Supreme Institution
asking for interpretation?

A. Shoghi Effendi and the House of Justice have both written
clearly that authorized interpretation is the prerogative of the
Guardian, and authorized legislation is the exclusive right of the
Universal House of Justice. These are two specific fields,
interpretation and legislation. Shoghi Effendi adds ‘Neither can,
nor will ever, infringe upon the sacred and prescribed domain of
the other’ (WOB 150). What does that mean? This means that
we have been given a promise that the Guardian will never
infringe upon the right of the Universal House of Justice to
authorized legislation and that the Universal House of Justice
will never infringe upon the sacred domain of authorized
interpretation.

A legitimate question we may have in this regard concerns
the instructions that Shoghi Effendi gave us about the
Administrative Order. Was not that legislation? Was he
infringing upon the domain of the Universal House of Justice?
We must look carefully at what Shoghi Effendi has written. At
the beginning of his Guardianship, when he started giving us
instructions about how to form our Assemblies and so on, he
often wrote that his instructions should be followed pending the
election of the Universal House of Justice, which will review the
situation at that time. In other words, he was saying that as there
was no Universal House of Justice yet, and as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had
appointed him as the Head of that House, he will be guiding us in

\[14\] INTRODUCTION

administrative affairs for the time being. He was not infringing
upon the sacred domain of the House of Justice. The Universal
House of Justice itself has written that it will not provide us with
authorized interpretations, but in order to legislate, it has to know
what Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi have
already written. Before it legislates, it takes the sacred text of
Bahá’u’lláh, and its authorized interpretation, into consideration.
Of course, this process involves an element of elucidation. When
an Assembly asked Shoghi Effendi: ‘How will the Supreme
Tribunal be formed and operate?’ he replied that this would
require the elucidation of the Universal House of Justice. This
means that legislation is required, legislation which of necessity
must have at its heart an elucidation. The elucidation will be in
the form of legislation to determine the functions of the tribunal,
the manner in which it should be elected or selected, and how it
should operate. The legislation is not about what we should
believe, merely about what we must do. The Writings of
Bahá’u’lláh, and those of the Interpreters, form the basis of our
beliefs and inner convictions. In order to find out more about the
operation of the Administrative Order we must turn to the
Universal House of Justice. It will tell us what to do and how to
do it.

Extracts from Shoghi Effendi’s writings during

the pre-Guardianship period
At the time when Shoghi Effendi was just a child, he had the
longing that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would address a Tablet to him.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá acceded to the wish of His grandson, and wrote
him the following: ‘He is God! O My Shoghi, I have no time to
talk, leave me alone! You said “write” – I have written. What
else should be done? Now is not the time for you to read and
write, it is the time for jumping about and chanting “O My
God!”, therefore memorize the prayers of the Blessed Beauty
and chant them that I may hear them, because there is no time
for anything else’ (PP 8).

On another occasion, according to Rúḥíyyih Khánum,
‘Shoghi Effendi entered the Master’s room, took up His pen and
tried to write. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá drew him to His side, tapped him
gently on the shoulder and said, “Now is not the time to write,
now is the time to play, you’ll write a lot in the future”’ (PP 9).

When, in the summer of 1918, Shoghi Effendi graduated
from the American University in Beirut with a Bachelor of Arts
degree, a new chapter opened before him, and he witnessed the
fulfilment of his highest aspiration: that of serving ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
as His secretary. From that summer till the spring of 1920, he
placed himself at the service of his beloved Grandfather. As far
as we know, the first translation he made of one of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s Tablets was dated 12 December 1918. It is published in
Star of the West, Volume 10.

Shoghi Effendi’s work consisted of translating into Persian
letters sent from the West addressed to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and
writing down the answers ‘Abdu’l-Bahá dictated to him. Before
the answers were sent to the friends in the West, he would
translate them into English and attach his rendition to the original
Tablet. In addition, Shoghi Effendi maintained a personal
correspondence with some of his close friends and also kept a
diary in which he recorded important events at the World Centre,
news of Bahá’í developments elsewhere, as well as his own
thoughts and feelings about the Faith and the Holy Land. The
diary has not been published yet. It only covers the 18 months
during which he served as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s secretary. He never
kept a diary after he was appointed as Guardian. The entire copy
is in the International Archives, and we can hope that at some
appropriate time in the future it will be published, as may be
determined by the Universal House of Justice.

In order to give us a glimpse of the type of work in which he
was engaged, selections have been made from his translations of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablets, and extracts taken from a few of his
letters as well as from his diary. These are set out below.

Pacific Islands and thence via India back to the Holy Land.
(17 July 1919, RD 9/11/05)

The garden immediately surrounding the Beloved’s abode is
blooming with verdure and flowers. The grove as well as the
rose-garden have indeed turned into a delectable Paradise.
Over three thousand mandarines sparkle like unto fire from
among the leaves of young trees that bend under the weight
of their clusters of fruit. The alleys are adorned on each side
with rain-drenched roses of varied colors. The balustrade is
almost concealed from view so extensive and rich have
become the branches and the off-shoots of the ivy. The white
rose bushes seem indeed to be covered with spots and masses
of snow reflecting the lights of the sun so much as to dazzle
the eye. The fragrance that embalms the air, the freshness
that one encounters around himself, the sight of the trees that
seem from afar to be set on fire, the violets, modest yet
betraying by their scent their presence, the [j]asmine, lily and
rose all combine to make the rose garden a favourable place
on such a sunny afternoon as the one we had today, for the
Master to dictate the Tablets to His dear friends all over the
world. (16 January 1919, RD 9/11/05)

Just before sunset, I was ordered by the Beloved to walk up
to the Holy Tomb and offer a prayer of devotion and
thanksgiving on His behalf. I instantly put on my walking
boots, took hold of my cane and ascended the Holy Mount.
The wind that was violently blowing softened down to a pure
and fragrant breeze which heralded the approach of
springtime; the mighty, and I venture to add matchless, view
that was unfolded to my eyes as I ascended higher and higher
the green and verdant slopes of Carmel; the spirituality that
imbued the atmosphere; the stillness, save the distant roar of
the waves, that added greatly to the Majesty and the
imposing serenity of the surroundings; the beautiful sight of

\[24\] SHOGHI EFFENDI’S WRITINGS DURING THE PRE-GUARDIANSHIP PERIOD

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. The Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá before the passing of
Bahá’u’lláh are regarded as authoritative and binding on the
Bahá’ís. Was this because of the station conferred on
‘Abdu’l-Bahá by the Súriy-i-GhuAn and the Kitáb-i-Aqdas?
If so, why are the writings of Shoghi Effendi before the
passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá not regarded as binding, since the
station of Guardian was conferred on him by the Will and
Testament while he was still a very young child?

A. No, the reason why we regard all the writings of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá as authoritative is not because they were written after the
revelation of the Súriy-i-Ghuṣn or the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. These
Tablets recognized the high station that He always had. He wrote
on behalf of Bahá’u’lláh while in Baghdád, even before the
revelation of the Súriy-i-Ghuṣn. Basically, the reason why the
writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and of Shoghi Effendi are treated
differently is because they had different stations from each other.
Let us contrast the person, the soul, the reality of Shoghi Effendi
with that of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was the Mystery of
God. He shared certain qualities and powers that the
Manifestation of God had. His equal cannot be found anywhere
else in religious history. Take for example Islam. Imám ‘Alí was
the successor of Muḥammad. Shoghi Effendi tells us not to
compare the station of Imám ‘Alí with that of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
because His was even higher. Nor are we to compare Him to
Saint Peter. The Master was unique, as He was also the perfect
Exemplar. In contrast, Shoghi Effendi has written, ‘No Guardian
of the Faith, I feel it my solemn duty to place on record, can ever
claim to be the perfect exemplar of the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh
or the stainless mirror that reflects His light’ (WOB 151).
Shoghi Effendi used to sign his letters with ‘Your true brother’.
He wanted to say that he was with us, working together with us
in the divine vineyard. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also sometimes said that He

was working with the Bahá’ís as a co-worker. However, this was
to show us that He was the Servant of Bahá’u’lláh, not because
He was equal to us in any way. He was not known as ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá before the passing of Bahá’u’lláh. Until then, He was
known as the Most Great Branch. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (Servant of
Bahá) was the title that He Himself adopted after the passing of
Bahá’u’lláh. This was to refute the accusation of Muḥammad-
‘Alí that He had claimed to be a Prophet. When He signed His
letters to the West in English He would write ‘a-B-a’. He used
small letters for ‘Abdu’l and ‘Abbás, but He used a capital B for
Bahá.

Q. Did Shoghi Effendi contribute to translations prior to the
Guardianship, such as The Hidden Words published in Cairo
in 1921?

A. Whenever Shoghi Effendi contributed to a translation his
name usually appeared in the translation credits, even if he was
only one of the contributors. For example, in some Star of the
West volumes there are Tablets translated by a team, consisting
of Shoghi Effendi, Dr Zia Baghdadi and Dr Esslemont. Their
three names were printed in brackets at the end of the Tablets.
Shoghi Effendi, as far as I know, did not contribute to the
translation of The Hidden Words by Mrs Stannard, published in
Cairo in 1921.

\[26\] II
Works produced during the initial period of the

Guardian’s ministry
After the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Bahá’í world was waiting
with bated breath to witness not only the personality and
behaviour of His successor, but the style, tone and spirit of
Shoghi Effendi’s writings. At the time of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Ascension, the friends in the East had already seen evidences of
the mighty and inspired pen of the Most Great Branch, through
such dissertations as The Secret of Divine Civilization and A
Traveller’s Narrative. But Shoghi Effendi, because of both his
youthful age and the brief period of his literary output prior
to 1921, was, for the most part, not fully established as an
author in the eyes of the generality of the believers in the East
and West.

The letters of Shoghi Effendi immediately after he learned
about the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá have a quality of anguish as
well as hope about the future. It is clear that he was feeling his
way in the discharge of his new responsibilities. He would often
ask the friends to pray for him so that he would not fall short of
the standard of servitude expected of him by the beloved Master.

A. Early letters

In the letters written at the very outset of his ministry, Shoghi
Effendi invariably in his closing paragraphs makes mention of
the ‘Ladies of the Household’ of the Master, who joined him in
his greetings to the friends. As time went on, we see that in such

letters he only makes mention of the Greatest Holy Leaf. This
practice was, of course, also stopped, after her passing in 1932.

The first letter we have on record is one he wrote to a fellow
Bahá’í student in London, while he was still in that city and was
moving to stay with Dr Esslemont in his home. In this precious
letter he writes as follows:

> The terrible news has for some days so overwhelmed my
> body, my mind and my soul that I was laid for a couple of
> days in bed almost senseless, absent-minded and greatly
> agitated. Gradually His power revived me and breathed in
> me a confidence that I hope will henceforth guide me and
> inspire me in my humble work of service. The day had to
> come, but how sudden and unexpected. The fact however that
> His Cause has created so many and such beautiful souls all

The letter ends with the phrase: ‘With prayer and faith in His
Cause, I am your well-wisher in His service, Shoghi’ (PP 40–1).

The second statement we have from him is a message writ-
ten on 6 January 1922, conveying his greetings to a gathering
of Bahá’ís and notables of the City of Haifa, to commemorate

\[28\] THE INITIAL PERIOD OF THE GUARDIAN’S MINISTRY

the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. In this message we read the
following:

> The shock has been too sudden and grievous for my youthful
> age to enable me to be present at this gathering of the loved
> ones of beloved ‘Abdu’l-Bahá . . . I venture to hope that we
> his kindred and his family may by our deeds and words,
> prove worthy of the glorious example he has set before us
> and thereby earn your esteem and your affection. May His
> everlasting spirit be with us all and knit us together for
> evermore! (PP 47)

On 19 January 1922, he wrote his first letter to the Bahá’ís of
Persia. In it he made reference to the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, to
the sorrows this event had entailed, and to the need to work
together in promoting the Faith. Towards the end of this brief
letter he made a request of the friends, the gist of which is as
follows:

> My perpetual request of His [‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s] faithful friends
> is that they should pray that I will remain steadfast in my
> resolve [to execute the Master’s last wishes] so that, God
> grant, this weak and worthless plant may acquire such
> strength and worthiness as to enable it to bear fruit and, in
> this way, bring joy and gladness to the hearts of the friends.

(TAW, Vol. 1, 1)

This idea of a plant bearing fruit is a reference to a statement
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Will and Testament, in which He states:

> It is incumbent upon you to take the greatest care of Shoghi
> Effendi . . . that no dust of despondency and sorrow may
> stain his radiant nature, that day by day he may wax greater
> in happiness, in joy and spirituality, and may grow to become
even as a fruitful tree. (WTA 25)

To obtain further insight into the tenor and tone of the
Guardian’s letters during this initial period, a number of extracts
from his correspondence are reproduced below:

> Ours is the duty to strive by day and night to fulfill our own
> obligations and then trust in His Guidance and never failing
> Grace. Unity amongst the friends, selflessness in our labors
> in His Path, detachment from all worldly things, the greatest
> prudence and caution in every step we take, earnest endeavor
> to carry out only what is His Holy Will and Pleasure, the
> constant awareness of His Presence and of the example of
> His Life, the absolute shunning of whomsoever we feel to be
> an enemy of the Cause . . . these, and foremost among them is
> the need for unity, appear to me as our most vital duties,
> should we dedicate our lives for His service. (21 January
> 1922, BA 16)

give way and droop whenever I face my work . . . (6 February
1922, PP 43)

Your . . . letter reached me in the very midst of my sorrows,
my cares and afflictions . . . the pain, nay the anguish of His
bereavement is so overwhelming, the burden of responsibility
He has placed on my feeble and my youthful shoulders is so
overwhelming . . . I am enclosing for you personally the copy
of the dear Master’s Testament, you will read it and see what
He has undergone at the hands of His kindred . . . you will
also see what a great responsibility He has placed on me
which nothing short of the creative power of His word can
help me to face . . . (February 1922, PP 48)

Ah bitter remorse of having missed Him – in His Last Days –
on this earth, I shall take with me to the grave no matter what
I may do for Him in future, no matter to what extent my
studies in England will repay his wondrous love for me.
(February 1922, PP 31)

At this grave and momentous period through which the
Cause of God in conformity with the Divine Wisdom is
passing, it is the sacred duty of every one of us to endeavour
to realize the full significance of this Hour of Transition, and
then to make a supreme resolve to arise steadfastly for the
fulfilment of our sacred obligations. (5 March 1922, BA 17)

How keenly I feel at this challenging hour in the history of
the Cause the need for a firm and definite determination to
subordinate all our personal likings, our local interests, to
the interests and requirements of the Cause of God! Now is
the time to set aside, nay, to forget altogether, minor con-
siderations regarding our internal relationships, and to
present a solid united front to the world animated by no other

> desire but to serve and propagate His Cause. (5 March 1922,
> BA 18)

> Does not ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wish us, as He looks down upon us
> with loving expectation from His glorious Station, to
> obliterate as much as possible all traces of censure, of
> conflicting discussions, of cooling remarks, of petty
> unnecessary observations that impede the onward march of
> the Cause, that damp the zeal of the firm believer and detract
> from the sublimity of the Bahá’í Cause in the eyes of the
> inquirer? (5 March 1922, BA 19)

> This servant, after that grievous event and great calamity, the
> ascension of His Holiness ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the Abhá King-

> entangled in the troubles (created) by the enemies of the
> Cause of God, that I consider that my presence here, at such
> a time and in such an atmosphere, is not in accordance with
the fulfilment of my important and sacred duties.

For this reason, unable to do otherwise, I have left for a
> time the affairs of the Cause both at home and abroad, under
> the supervision of the Holy Family and the headship of the
> Greatest Holy Leaf until, by the Grace of God, having gained

Bahá’u’lláh. Now that happily I feel myself restored to
a position where I can take up with continuity and vigour
the threads of my manifold duties, the bitterness of every
disappointment felt time and again in the course of the past
weary months at my feeling of unpreparedness, have been
merged in the sweetness of the present hour when I real-
ise that spiritually and bodily I am better equipped
to shoulder the responsibilities of the Cause. (December
1922, PP 66)

True, my task is immense, my responsibilities grave and
manifold, but the assurance which the words of the all-
wise Master give me in my work is my shield and support in
the career which is now unfolding itself to my eyes. (20
December 1922, PP 67).

To have been unable, owing to unforeseen and unavoidable
circumstances, to correspond with you ever since you entered
upon your manifold and arduous duties is to me a cause of
deep regret and sad surprise . . . I am however assured and
sustained by the conviction, never dimmed in my mind, that
whatsoever comes to pass in the Cause of God, however
disquieting in its immediate effects, is fraught with infinite
Wisdom and tends ultimately to promote its interests in the
world. (23 December 1922, PP 67)

Are we to be carried away by the flood of hollow and
conflicting ideas, or are we to stand, unsubdued and
unblemished, upon the everlasting rock of God’s Divine
Instructions? . . . [A]re we to believe that whatever befalls us
is divinely ordained, and in no wise the result of our faint-
heartedness and negligence? (1923, PP 74).

[The Will of God is] at variance with the shadowy views, the
impotent doctrines, the crude theories, the idle imaginings,

> the fashionable conceptions of a transient and troublous
> age . . . (1923, PP 74)

> The time has come for the friends . . . to think not as to how
> they should serve the Cause, but how the Cause should be
> served. (1923, PP 74)

Amatu’l-Bahá Rúḥíyyih Khánum’s insight is penetrating
when she describes the quality of Shoghi Effendi’s letters during
the first two years of his ministry. She writes: ‘With the passing
of 1923 one could almost say that the winged Guardian emerged
from the chrysalis of youth, a new being; the wings may not yet
be fully stretched, but their beat gains steadily in sweep and
assurance as the years go by until, in the end, they truly cast a
shadow over all mankind’ (PP 73).

B. Translation of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament

Seventeen days after the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Shoghi
Effendi, accompanied by Lady Blomfield, arrived in the Holy
Land with a broken heart, a weary body and strained nerves. It
was in this condition that he had to assume the extraordinary
responsibility that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had placed on his shoulders. He
stayed in the same room that he had occupied during the ministry
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, which was adjoining the Master’s bedroom
where He passed away. We can well assume that one of his first
acts was to read the text of the Will and Testament. He
subsequently set himself the task of translating this remarkable
document into English. After a short while he had to transfer his
residence to the home of one of his aunts, which was adjacent to
the Master’s house, where he could have a quieter atmosphere in
which to work.

Here was this 24-year-old youth, who had to translate, for all
time, the provisions of a document which he later described as
one of the two ‘Charter[s] of a future world civilization’ (GPB

\[34\] THE INITIAL PERIOD OF THE GUARDIAN’S MINISTRY

328). While he was doing this seminal work, he also had to make
sure that photostatic copies of his Grandfather’s Will or reliable
transcripts were made and duly sent to different Bahá’í
communities throughout the East. Sentence by sentence, he had
to translate the story of the sufferings endured by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
the disloyalty and rebellion of His half-brother, Mírzá
Muḥammad-‘Alí, and the Master’s prediction of the frustration
of all his hopes and those of the people who followed him.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá also expressed in His last wishes a call to all the
friends to arise unitedly to disperse far and wide and to follow
the heroic example of the Disciples of Jesus Christ. In this self-
same document ‘Abdu’l-Bahá expresses His desire for
martyrdom, and utters His prayers for the repentance and
forgiveness of His enemies. On more practical matters, the
Master outlined the responsibilities and powers devolving on the
Guardian of the Faith, including his appointment of the Hands of
the Cause of God, and specified the scope of the duties and
functions of the Universal House of Justice, as well as stipulating
the method of the election of this Supreme Body.

Shoghi Effendi has given us the gist of the contents of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament in the following concise and
comprehensive summary:

> The Document establishing that Order [Administrative
> Order], the Charter of a future world civilization, which may
> be regarded in some of its features as supplementary to no
> less weighty a Book than the Kitáb-i-Aqdas; signed and
> sealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; entirely written with His own hand;
> its first section composed during one of the darkest periods of
> His incarceration in the prison-fortress of ‘Akká, proclaims,
> categorically and unequivocally, the fundamental beliefs of
> the followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh; reveals, in
> unmistakable language, the twofold character of the Mission
> of the Bab; discloses the full station of the Author of the
Bahá’í Revelation; asserts that ‘all others are servants unto

> Him and do His bidding’; stresses the importance of the
> Kitáb-i-Aqdas; establishes the institution of the Guardianship
> as a hereditary office and outlines its essential functions;
> provides the measures for the election of the International
> House of Justice, defines its scope and sets forth its
> relationship to that Institution; prescribes the obligations,
> and emphasizes the responsibilities, of the Hands of the
> Cause of God; and extolls the virtues of the indestructible
> Covenant established by Bahá’u’lláh. That Document,
> furthermore, lauds the courage and constancy of the
> supporters of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant; expatiates on the
> sufferings endured by its appointed Center; recalls the
> infamous conduct of Mírzá YaJyá and his failure to heed the
> warnings of the Báb; exposes, in a series of indictments, the
> perfidy and rebellion of Mírzá MuJammad-‘Alí, and the
> complicity of his son Shu‘á’u’lláh and of his brother Mírzá
> Badí‘u’lláh; reaffirms their excommunication, and predicts
> the frustration of all their hopes; summons the Afnán (the
> Báb’s kindred), the Hands of the Cause and the entire
> company of the followers of Bahá’u’lláh to arise unitedly to
> propagate His Faith, to disperse far and wide, to labor
> tirelessly and to follow the heroic example of the Apostles of
> Jesus Christ; warns them against the dangers of association
> with the Covenant-breakers, and bids them shield the Cause
> from the assaults of the insincere and the hypocrite; and
> counsels them to demonstrate by their conduct the
> universality of the Faith they have espoused, and vindicate its
> high principles. In that same Document its Author reveals the
> significance and purpose of the Kuqúq’u’lláh (Right of God),
> already instituted in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas; enjoins submission
> and fidelity towards all monarchs who are just; expresses
> His longing for martyrdom, and voices His prayers for
> the repentance as well as the forgiveness of His enemies.

(GPB 328)

\[36\] THE INITIAL PERIOD OF THE GUARDIAN’S MINISTRY

As the Covenant-breakers in North America falsely assumed
that the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in the West would be shaken and
weakened through the passing of the Centre of the Covenant, and
the friends, particularly in North America, were subjected to a
wave of tests and trials, Shoghi Effendi decided that he would
give them the translated text of the Will in two stages. Prior to
sending the complete version, he made some selections and
shared these with the communities in the West, to prepare the
friends for a fuller understanding of the document. This version
was soon followed by the entire text.

To the friends in both the East and the West, Shoghi Effendi
repeatedly pointed out that there were hidden implications and
mysteries deposited in the provisions of the Will that would be
disclosed gradually with the passage of time. The friends initially
could not see what mysteries Shoghi Effendi was referring to, as,
for the most part, they considered the document to be a
straightforward statement focusing on the appointment of Shoghi
Effendi as the Master’s successor, the imperative need for the
friends to rally around him, and to protect the Cause under his
direction and spread it abroad throughout all nations, so that vast
multitudes would enter the Faith of God.

In one of his letters commenting on the provisions of the
Will, the Guardian stated that it would take a hundred years for
the implications of the Will and Testament to be fully and
generally understood. He stated that the friends should ‘trust to
time, and the guidance of God’s Universal House of Justice, to
obtain a clearer and fuller understanding of [the Will’s]
provisions and implications . . .’ (23 February 1924, BA 62).

Although the explicit text of the Will and Testament of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá provides for two possibilities for the election and
operation of the Universal House of Justice, namely one with a
living Guardian as its Head, and one without his direct
participation, the Bahá’ís during Shoghi Effendi’s ministry
generally did not imagine that he would be the first and last
Guardian during this Dispensation. In this connection it must be

borne in mind that, in His Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh envisages
the termination of the line of ‘Branches’ (Aghṣán) to precede the
establishment of the House of Justice: ‘After Him [the
Manifestation], this authority shall pass to the AghMán, and after
them to the House of Justice – should it be established in the
world by then . . .’ (KA ¶42). Despite this provision in the Most
Holy Book, the idea that the twin institutions of the Guardianship
and the House of Justice had to literally coexist in order for the
House of Justice to discharge its duties persisted in the minds of
the believers. It was only after the passing of Shoghi Effendi that
the Universal House of Justice clarified this issue for the friends.

C. Preparing the text of The Passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

In addition to his strenuous work on the translation of his
Grandfather’s Will and Testament, Shoghi Effendi felt that the
Bahá’í world was waiting to receive details of the events that led
to the Master’s ascension. He therefore, with the help of Lady
Blomfield, compiled all the data that was available to him on this
subject. The document that was produced was entitled The
Passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and had a subtitle which read,
‘Compiled by Shoghi Effendi and Lady Blomfield’. It was first
published in England in 1922. Shoghi Effendi immediately sent a
copy of the English text to the Local Assembly of Tehran (there
was no National Spiritual Assembly at that time) and asked that
its contents be translated into Persian and disseminated among
the friends in the East.

The document is in the form of a letter dated 19 January
1922, and is signed ‘Sitarih Khánum (Lady Blomfield)’ and then
‘Shoghi’. (‘Sitarih’ in Persian means ‘star’. The full title is a
name that was given to Lady Blomfield by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to
express His appreciation for her services to the Cause.) This
letter, which consists of some 50 pages, gives details of what
transpired immediately before the Master’s passing. It also
quotes one of the prayers of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in a Tablet to the

\[38\] THE INITIAL PERIOD OF THE GUARDIAN’S MINISTRY

friends in America, in which He yearns to take His flight to the
Kingdom. The prayer is as follows:

> Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá! (O Thou the Glory of Glories) I have
> renounced the world and the people thereof, and am heart-
> broken and sorely afflicted because of the unfaithful. In the
> cage of this world, I flutter even as a frightened bird, and
yearn every day to take my flight unto Thy Kingdom.

Ya Bahá’u’l-Abhá! Make me to drink of the cup of
> sacrifice and set me free. Relieve me from these woes and
> trials, from these afflictions and troubles. Thou art He that
> aideth, that succoureth, that protecteth, that stretcheth forth
> the hand of help. (ACC 458)

The letter goes on to quote what the friends had heard from
‘Abdu’l-Bahá during the last weeks and days of His life, all of
which clearly indicates that He knew very well that the time of
His taking leave from this world of dust was drawing nigh. This
is followed by a description of the impressive procession of
notables of the country who participated in the funeral cortège,
including the High Commissioner of Palestine, the Governor of
Phoenicia, chief officials of the government, consuls of various
countries resident in Haifa, heads of different religious com-
munities, and a host of the heart-broken friends, in all about ten
thousand in number. The booklet contains an account of the
procession walking up from the Master’s house to the site of the
Shrine on Mount Carmel, and extracts of speeches delivered on
that memorable occasion.

It further cites a number of passages from reports in such
newspapers as The Morning Post, the New York World, and the
Times of India. Telegrams sent by His Britannic Majesty’s
Secretary of State, the Council of Ministers in Baghdád, the High
Commissioner for Egypt, the Commander-in-Chief of the
Egyptian Expeditionary Force, the Theosophical Society in
London, one of the renowned professors of the University of

Oxford, and Bahá’í communities throughout the world are
enumerated. An account is given of the memorial feast that was
held, in conformity with local customs, on the fortieth day after
the Master’s passing, at which over six hundred of the people of
Haifa, ‘Akká, and adjoining regions in Palestine and Syria
attended, and reference is made to the assemblage of over a
hundred poor and needy who were also fed on that day. The
letter finally describes the gathering in the large, central hall of
the Master’s house, where speeches were delivered in
appreciation of the work and life of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

The last section consists of extracts from the Will and
Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Turning from the text of the Will to
other Tablets revealed by the Master, the letter gives extracts
from a number of His writings which indicate the glorious
unfoldment of God’s Holy Cause, including two Tablets revealed
by Him in interpretation of Daniel’s prophecy about the 1335
days. In one of these Tablets, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá indicates that the
1335 days specifically refer to the lapse of a century from the
Declaration of Bahá’u’lláh’s Mission in Baghdád (i.e. 1963.) At
such a time, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá adds, ‘will the Teachings of God be
firmly established upon the earth, and the Divine Light shall
flood the world from the East even unto the West. Then, on this
day, will the faithful rejoice’ (PA 50).

The document ends with the prayer revealed by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá which is recited as the Tablet of Visitation in His Shrine.
Immediately prior to this Tablet is the quotation of these most
touching words of the Master:

> I am waiting, waiting, to hear the joyful tidings that the
> believers are the very embodiment of sincerity and
> truthfulness, the incarnation of love and amity, the living
> symbols of unity and concord. Will they not gladden my
> heart? Will they not satisfy my yearning? Will they not
> manifest my wish? Will they not fulfil my heart’s desire? Will

they not give ear to my call? I am waiting. I am patiently
waiting. (ACC 406)

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. You have said that the House of Justice receives guid-
ance from the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. Is it such that, when you
have the meeting, you feel something special, or is it
imperceptible?

A. This question has been put to me many times. And I am sure
it is a question asked to ex-members of the House of Justice,
wherever they may be. It is asked by pilgrims when they go to
Haifa and meet House members. Everyone wants to know what
happens in the meetings of the Universal House of Justice.
Firstly, the members of the Universal House of Justice work as
nine brothers. These brothers sincerely and deeply love one
another. There is a deep love binding them together and to the
Cause of God. The meaning of this love and this bond is that the
happiness of one is the happiness of all, and the distress of one is
the distress of all. When something happens which is a source
joy to one of the members, it becomes a source of joy for the
rest. If there is a source of sadness for an individual member,
again it is a source of sadness for the rest. This, I think, is
something that does not have to occur only in Haifa. It is
something that can occur and should occur everywhere in the
world, wherever we have consultative Bahá’í bodies, whether
they are Local Assemblies, National Assemblies, committees,
Counsellors etc. It is this spirit of love that you read about in the
writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, which have been compiled for us by
Shoghi Effendi and published in the book Bahá’í Administration.
One of the first prerequisites is love among the members.

Another very important condition, which has been laid down
by Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-í-Aqdas, is this: ‘They should
consider themselves as entering the Court of the presence of
God, the Exalted, the Most High, and as beholding Him Who is
the Unseen’. That means when the members enter the Council
Chamber they feel that they are sitting in the presence of

\[42\] THE INITIAL PERIOD OF THE GUARDIAN’S MINISTRY

Bahá’u’lláh. In the Kitáb-í-Aqdas, this applies to all the Houses
of Justice, wherever they may be. It is one of the important
requirements of Bahá’í consultation. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ has given us
other conditions. When we offer our views, we should have
purity of motive. What is purity of motive? That is, the members
should think to themselves, ‘Why am I here? I am here to serve
the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. I am here to promote and to protect
the interests of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. I am not here for
myself. I am here for Bahá’u’lláh. If I speak, I should be aware
Bahá’u’lláh is listening to me. When I speak I should speak for
Him, not for myself.’ This purity of motive is itself like a
magnet. It attracts divine confirmations, whether the consultation
is on the local, the national, the continental or international level.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written: ‘In short, whatsoever thing is
arranged in harmony and with love and purity of motive, its
result is light, and should the least trace of estrangement prevail
the result shall be darkness upon darkness . . . Should they
endeavor to fulfill these conditions the Grace of the Holy Spirit
shall be vouchsafed unto them, and that assembly shall become
the center of the Divine blessings, the hosts of Divine
confirmation shall come to their aid, and they shall day by day
receive a new effusion of Spirit’ (BA 22–3).

The difference between the Universal House of Justice and
every other kind of consultative body is that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has
written in His Will and Testament: ‘That which this body,
whether unanimously or by a majority doth carry, that is verily
the truth and the purpose of God Himself. Whoso doth deviate
therefrom is verily of them that love discord, hath shown forth
malice, and turned away from the Lord of the Covenant’ (WOB
149). Bahá’u’lláh Himself has given this promise: ‘God will
verily inspire them [members of the Universal House of Justice]
with whatsoever He willeth, and He verily is the Provider, the
Omniscient’ (WOB 149).

There is an explicit guarantee that God will protect the
decisions of the Universal House of Justice, whether they are

made by unanimous or majority vote. However, when it comes to
the National and Local Spiritual Assemblies, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has
said ‘should the least trace of estrangement prevail the result
shall be darkness upon darkness’ (BA 22). There is something
wonderful about this Faith that protects it from harm. It is unique
to Bahá’í consultation. A letter on behalf of Shoghi Effendi
explains it very well: ‘The Assembly may make a mistake, but, as
the Master pointed out, if the Community does not abide by its
decisions, or the individual Bahá’í, the result is worse, as it
undermines the very institution which must be strengthened in
order to uphold the principles and laws of the Faith. He tells us
God will right the wrongs done’ (CC Vol. II, 58). This does not
exist anywhere else, whether in previous religions or in secular
institutions. It means that if a decision is influenced by the ego,
the personal interests or the prejudices of the Assembly
members, God will make sure that this decision is corrected
eventually. How does He do this? Ever since I turned 21 years
old, I have been a member of Local Assemblies and then
National Assemblies. I have seen this thing happen so many
times in my own lifetime. If the decision taken during con-
sultation is the right one, it will usually be easy and joyful to
implement. But if the decision is a wrong one, the Assembly will
find it extremely difficult to implement. There will be all kinds
of problems. At the next meeting, these problems are discussed
and a new decision made. The Finger of God interferes to stop
the implementation of the wrong decision. This is, I think, what
is meant by ‘God will right the wrongs done’.

Q. ‘The Hands of the Cause of God must elect from their own
number nine persons that shall at all times be occupied in the
important services in the work of the guardian of the Cause of
God . . . and these, whether unanimously or by a majority vote,
must give their assent to the choice of the one whom the
guardian of the Cause of God hath chosen as his successor’
(WTA 12). Why didn’t the Guardian call upon the Hands of

\[44\] THE INITIAL PERIOD OF THE GUARDIAN’S MINISTRY

the Cause to create this body of nine? Was it because he
knew that he wasn’t going to have a successor?

A. The questioner has given the answer already. I think this is a
very good answer. Shoghi Effendi had appointed the Hands of
the Cause, but he never called on them to elect nine to come to
Haifa. He appointed four to be there as a nucleus to work with
him. There were 27 Hands of the Cause and they were to choose
nine from among themselves to come to Haifa. Among their
functions was to give their assent, by secret ballot, to the
Guardian’s choice of successor. He had no son himself and all
the other Branches (Aghṣán) had become Covenant-breakers.
The son of Jináb-i-Samandarí, a very dear Bahá’í, was in Haifa
in 1957, towards the very end of Shoghi Effendi’s life. He wrote
to me a letter after his pilgrimage. He said that towards the end
of his pilgrimage, Shoghi Effendi had turned to him and told
him: ‘Look! There are no more Aghṣáns!’ After Shoghi Effendi
passed away we realized that by ‘There are no more Aghṣáns’,
he must have meant that there was no one he could appoint as his
successor, because the successor had to be a Ghuṣn (Branch).

Q. What was the prophecy of Daniel and why did Shoghi
Effendi refer to it so often in his writings?

A. The verse in the book of Daniel is as follows: ‘Blessed is he
who waits, and comes to the one thousand three hundred and
thirty-five days’ (Dan. 12: 12). Many of the biblical scholars
could not understand the meaning of this verse. When ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá was asked about the prophecy of Daniel, He provided an
explanation. He said that the beginning of the 1335 days should
be the year when the Prophet Muḥammad left Mecca and went to
Medina. Hijrah means the flight of Muḥammad from Mecca. He
started His mission in the year 610 AD. For 12 years He was in
Mecca, after which, in 622 He left Mecca, escaped from the
persecutions and went to Medina, an adjoining city. He resided

there from 622 until 630. Then, for the last two years He returned
to Mecca. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is telling us to start counting the 1335
days from the date of the Hijrah, of the flight of Muḥammad
from Mecca to Medina, which was the beginning of the Muslim
calendar. The Islamic calendar uses AH (after Hijrah) in contrast
to the Christian AD (Anno Domini). In the Bible references are
made to days, but these are interpreted as years. The year 622
plus 1335 equals 1957. This was the year when Shoghi Effendi
passed away, at the midpoint of the Ten Year Crusade.

The Declaration of Bahá’u’lláh was in Baghdád in 1963.

‘The “hundred lunar years,” destined to immediately precede
that blissful consummation (1335 days), announced by Daniel in
that same chapter, had commenced’ (GPB 151). A hundred lunar
years is equal to 97 solar years. Ninety-seven plus 1863 equals
1960\. In other letters, Shoghi Effendi interpreted the century as
100 solar years. One hundred plus 1863 equals 1963. When
Shoghi Effendi passed away in 1957, it was the midway point of
the Ten Year Crusade. In the course of 1960, the International
Bahá’i Council was elected by all the National Spiritual
Assemblies of the world, the first global election in religious
history. In April 1961 the first elected International Bahá’i
Council was formed. In 1963 a second election took place, this
time for the Universal House of Justice itself. In his letters,
Shoghi Effendi is referring to this date, 1963, as the fulfilment of
the prophecy of Daniel, which coincided with the election of the
Universal House of Justice. This was based on the following
statement made by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: ‘Now concerning the verses in
Daniel . . . these days must be reckoned as solar . . . years. For
according to this calculation a century will have elapsed from
the Dawn of the Sun of Truth, then will the teachings of God be
firmly established upon the earth, and the Divine Light shall
flood the world from the East even unto the West. Then, on this
day, will the faithful rejoice’ (MUHJ 738). That is what Shoghi
Effendi was referring to when he wrote about Daniel’s prophecy.
It was only after his passing that the Bahá’ís realized that the

\[46\] THE INITIAL PERIOD OF THE GUARDIAN’S MINISTRY

source of the rejoicing and celebration at the fulfilment of the
prophecy would be the election of the Universal House of Justice
in 1963.

Q. Soon after his appointment as Guardian, Shoghi Effendi
summoned many prominent believers to the World Centre to
consult on the formation of the Universal House of Justice.
What happened at that meeting? If he knew that he was not
going to form the House of Justice, what was the purpose of
the meeting?

A. Rúḥíyyih Khánum wrote a wonderful message on the
occasion of the twenty-fifth year of the Guardianship, in 1946.
The title of this wonderful message is ‘Twenty-five years of the
Guardianship’. In this message, Rúḥíyyih Khánum explains that
after the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in 1921, the older believers as
well as his own family were urging the Guardian to establish the
Universal House of Justice. They were telling him that he was
young, very much alone, and in need of help. They also urged
him to appoint Hands of the Cause, so that they, as well as the
Universal House of Justice, would be able to help him. Rúḥíyyih
Khánum explains that Shoghi Effendi knew very well that this
was not possible. Firstly, the time had not come for the
appointment of Hands. Shoghi Effendi waited 30 years before he
formally appointed any Hands to help him. Secondly, Shoghi
Effendi explained that the Universal House of Justice was like a
dome. It could not be suspended in mid-air. He had to lay the
foundations of the Administrative Order, and then he had to erect
the pillars to support the dome. However, because the idea of
establishing the House of Justice and the appointment of Hands
was prevalent at the time, in his wisdom, he decided to invite
some of the veteran believers to consult with him. They did not
come, as far as I know, all at once, to sit down together and
consult. They came at different times. They were Mr Mountfort
Mills from the United States, Mr Hippolyte Dreyfus from France

and Mr Fáḍil-i-Mázindarání from Iran. He spoke to them, asked
their opinion and in turn must have provided his own opinion. He
later explained that it was too early for the election of the
Universal House of Justice. This is my understanding of these
very important events of that time.

Q. The Guardian has written that we should shun
whomsoever we feel to be an enemy of the Cause? How are
we to decide who is an enemy of the Cause. Aren’t we
supposed to associate with all people with love and kindness?

A. It is important to observe that there are two types of enemies
of the Cause: those from within and those from without. An
enemy of the Cause from without could be a government, an
organization or an individual who is not a Bahá’í. For example,
you could certainly say that the government of Iran has been an
enemy of the Cause for several decades. These enemies try to
obstruct the growth of the Faith. There will be many more such
enemies in the future, as the Faith becomes stronger.

Then there are Covenant-breakers, who are internal enemies
of the Faith. These Covenant-breakers are identified by the Head
of the Faith, which then asks us not to have association with
them. Nobody has the authority to call someone a Covenant-
breaker except the Head of the Faith. When the Head of the Faith
has come to the conclusion that an individual should be re-
garded as a Covenant-breaker, it informs directly the National
Assemblies or the Boards of Counsellors. We are asked in the
Writings to pray for them, so that they may realize their mistakes
and come back to the Faith. However, we should not associate
with them because they will eventually poison our hearts. This is
the clear instruction that we have in the Writings. Every effort
would have been made to help them, before they were declared
Covenant-breakers.

If you know somebody who is antagonistic and inimical
towards the Faith, we should leave them alone and not associate

\[48\] THE INITIAL PERIOD OF THE GUARDIAN’S MINISTRY

with them. Unfortunately, it has happened in the past that
external enemies of the Faith have used spies. They would send
in young people, whom they would pay, to come and mix with
the Bahá’ís, to pretend that they wanted to become Bahá’ís, and
then to join the community. Subsequently, they would take all
the information about where the meetings were held and go back
to their own society to feed the information for fresh attacks.
This has happened and will continue to happen. This is why
Shoghi Effendi warns the National and Local Assemblies to be
very careful. He could see that opposition would come, wave
after wave. As the Faith becomes stronger, these waves of
persecution will become higher and mightier, but the Faith will
be strong enough to withstand these onslaughts, and eventually
these waves will die out, while the ship of the Cause will
continue to sail.

Q. ‘Gradually His power revived me and breathed in me a
confidence that I hope will henceforth guide me and inspire me
in my humble work of service’ (PP 40). Did Shoghi Effendi
write this before or after reading the Will and Testament?

A. The above extract is from a letter written by Shoghi Effendi
while he was still in London. My understanding is that while
Shoghi Effendi was still in London the cable from the Greatest
Holy Leaf arrived saying that Shoghi Effendi was the Guardian
of the Bahá’í Faith and Head of the Universal House of Justice.
This was the cable that the Greatest Holy Leaf sent all over the
world. Thus, he must have read that message and known that he
was to be the Guardian. However, he did not know the exact
nature of the contents of the Will. He had to arrive in the Holy
Land, before He could read it for himself.

Q. What was Shoghi Effendi’s relationship to the Greatest
Holy Leaf? How did it influence him?

A. If, soon after the passing of the Master, there was anybody
who really understood Shoghi Effendi, it was the Greatest Holy
Leaf. She was conscious of what a mystery he was. She was
aware of the potentialities God had endowed him with. I have
often said that Shoghi Effendi’s physical parents were Mírzá
Hádí and Ḍíyá’íyyih Khánum, the daughter of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, but
that his true father was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and his true mother was the
Greatest Holy Leaf. They loved this child so much, for they
knew who he really was.

I can still vividly recall the Greatest Holy Leaf in the
presence of Shoghi Effendi. Though she was no less than the
daughter of Bahá’u’lláh and the sister of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, she
showed the utmost respect in the presence of Shoghi Effendi,
who was only in his twenties at the time. If she was ill and lying
feverish in bed, and he entered the room, she made an extreme
effort to sit up in her bed. Such was the degree of reverence she,
who truly knew him, had for him.

One must bear in mind that when Shoghi Effendi took on the
role of Guardian, at the age of 24, there were very illustrious
Bahá’ís in the East and in the West who had distinguished
themselves during the days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. There was even a
Hand of the Cause living in Iran, who had been appointed by
Bahá’u’lláh. Shoghi Effendi’s early letters show an interesting
pattern. His humility is combined with his gradual yet decisive
assertion of the needs of the Faith and the duty of the Bahá’ís.
The situation was very different from the time after the ascension
of Bahá’u’lláh. All of the friends were aware that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
would succeed Him. They were conscious of the references made
to the Master in the Súriy-i-Ghuṣn and the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.

Q. ‘The time has come for the friends . . . to think not as to how
they should serve the Cause, but how the Cause should be
served’ (1923, PP 74). Could you please elaborate on what the
Guardian was conveying here?

\[50\] THE INITIAL PERIOD OF THE GUARDIAN’S MINISTRY

A. Although this quote is only two lines long, in my view, it
stands out remarkably from among the writings of the Guardian.
It was written in 1923, when he was about 26 years old. My
understanding of it is this: don’t make yourself the centre of the
universe. Those of us who think about how we can serve the
Cause could easily make our own well-being our number one
priority. If we make the well-being of the Cause our number one
priority then we will think about what the Cause needs us to do
for it. Shoghi Effendi suggests the time has come for the friends
to start to think in this way, because we are now living in the
Formative Age and the Cause has many needs.

In this connection, I would like to share with you an episode
I observed when I was about 14 or 15. A big cat came near a hen
surrounded by little chicks. The mother hen became furious and
attacked the cat, conscious that its intention was to catch one of
the chicks. The cat could have also attacked the hen, yet she
risked her own life for the sake of the chicks. That’s when I
asked myself: ‘If the hen is willing to risk her life for the chicks,
should I not do the same for the Cause of God, the most precious
thing on earth?’ And I think this relates to this sentence by
Shoghi Effendi. We should put the Cause first in our lives; it is
the most precious thing we have from God on earth today. The
sentiment is similar to the attitude of a mother towards her baby.
Everything comes after the baby, even her own life. Shoghi
Effendi is telling us to make the Cause of God the centre of our
lives; we shouldn’t expect the Cause of God to revolve around
us, we should revolve around the Cause.

Translations
A. Role of Mr George Townshend

The Guardian used the editorial services of a few friends whose
grasp of the English language he appreciated. ‘Shoghi Effendi’,
Rúḥíyyih Khánum writes, ‘was tolerant and practical in his
approach to his own work. For years he sent his translations and
manuscripts to George Townshend, whose command and know-
ledge of English he greatly admired’ (PP 204).

George Townshend was an Episcopalian minister of Anglo-
Irish background. He became a Bahá’í in 1921. From 1926
onwards he lent his editing services to Shoghi Effendi,
collaborating on such works as The Dawn-Breakers and God
Passes By, as well as making suggestions on the draft
translations of The Hidden Words, The Kitáb-i-Iqán, Gleanings
from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, Prayers and Meditations, and
Epistle to the Son of the Wolf. He finally renounced his orders in
1947, and in 1951 was appointed to the rank of Hand of the
Cause.

The working relationship between the Guardian and Mr
Townshend began when, in February of 1926, George wrote a
letter to Shoghi Effendi offering his editorial services on the
translation of the Hidden Words: ‘I have been told that you
invited Miss Rosenberg to Haifa to help in translating work . . . I
am encouraged by this to offer now my services, such as they
are, in this kind of work. Having myself no knowledge of Persian
and being a clergyman resident in Ireland, my help can not be

TRANSLATIONS

anything better than advice as to English idiom and grammatical
structure’ (GT 55–6).

The Guardian immediately wrote back expressing his
appreciation for the offer, and included with his letter the first
part of his translation of the Hidden Words. Later, after
Townshend’s corrections had been received, Shoghi Effendi
wrote to him in a personal note: ‘Miss Rosenberg and myself (I
wish you were with us also!) have carefully altered the text in the
light of your suggestions and I trust that it [the Hidden Words]
will soon be published in London’ (GT 58).

Shoghi Effendi continued to ask Townshend for ‘final
touches’ to his literary output for a total of 18 years. The
Guardian was particularly reliant on George’s assistance when
the pressures of his other commitments prevented him from
giving the fine-tuning of the manuscript all the time he would
have wished. A letter to Townshend written on Shoghi Effendi’s
behalf by his secretary, dated 29 December 1943, explains this
situation: ‘Had he had more time at his disposal he could have,
naturally, devoted more of it to putting the finishing touches on
his manuscript . . . [U]nfortunately . . . the work of the Cause is
so great and so pressing that he lacks the advantages enjoyed by
most authors of being able to devote themselves whole-heartedly
and single-mindedly to their task’ (GT 70–1).

In his book on the life of George Townshend, David Hofman
elaborates on this relationship: ‘The collaboration between the
Guardian and George on this great work [God Passes By]
followed the normal pattern already established between them
. . . Their modus operandi was for the Guardian to send the first
typewritten pages of the work in hand, with a description of it
and his request for George’s services’ (GT 69–70).

Despite the value he placed on such editorial input, the final
decision regarding the form and content of the work always
rested with Shoghi Effendi. Hofman underlines this fact:
‘However much he turned to George for advice on syntax,
“englishing”, polishing and refining of style, idiomatic usage and

the like, he [the Guardian] was the final arbiter who decided
whether to adopt, reject or amend any or all of George’s editorial
suggestions’ (GT 81).

B. Translations of Sacred Texts – listed chronologically

1\. The Hidden Words

Shoghi Effendi described Bahá’u’lláh’s Hidden Words as an
‘outstanding contribution . . . to the world’s religious literature’
occupying a ‘position of unsurpassed pre-eminence among the
ethical Writings of the Author of the Bahá’í Dispensation’, a
‘collection of gem-like utterances . . . with which Bahá’u’lláh
was inspired, as He paced, wrapped in His meditations, the
banks of the Tigris’, and a ‘dynamic spiritual leaven cast into the
life of the world for the reorientation of the minds of men, the
edification of their souls and the rectification of their conduct’
(GPB 140).

The book was revealed about 1858, ‘partly in Persian, partly
in Arabic, . . . originally designated the “Hidden Book of
FáOimih,” and . . . identified by its Author with the Book of that
same name, believed by Shí’ah Islám to be in the possession of
the promised Qá’im, and to consist of words of consolation
addressed by the angel Gabriel, at God’s command, to FáOimih,
and dictated to the Imám ‘Alí, for the sole purpose of comforting
her in her hour of bitter anguish after the death of her illustrious
Father’ (GPB 140). In one of His Tablets, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá exhorts
the friends not only to read this book, but to act in accordance
with its precepts. In another Tablet He points out that if
Bahá’u’lláh had revealed only the Hidden Words, and nothing
else, it would be adequate guidance for the human race. He even
urged the friends to memorize passages from the book.

There is little question why the Guardian would choose this
work to be the first of the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh to be
translated by him for the benefit of the friends in the West. Even

\[54\] TRANSLATIONS

while he was in Oxford, he tried his hand at translating portions
of the Hidden Words. One of the British friends, Ethel
Rosenberg, served Shoghi Effendi in a secretarial capacity soon
after the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The Guardian consulted with
her regarding his translation, and invited suggestions for the
improvement of the English text. As earlier stated, when George
Townshend heard of Ethel Rosenberg’s contribution, he offered
his own services in this field of activity and the offer was warmly
welcomed by Shoghi Effendi. This is why, when The Hidden
Words was first published in 1927, the frontispiece stated
‘translated by Shoghi Effendi, with the assistance of some
English friends’. Some years passed, and the Publishing Trust
thought that the latter part of the phrase was no longer
appropriate, so they suggested to Shoghi Effendi to remove it. He
approved this and it has been omitted from later editions.

This remarkable collection opens with a brief introduction by
Bahá’u’lláh Himself, in which He describes the Hidden Words as
‘the inner essence’ of what was previously ‘revealed unto the
Prophets of old’. Part one of the book consists of 71 stanzas
originally revealed in Arabic, while the second part, translated
from the Persian, consists of 82 stanzas, followed by a closing
paragraph. In this ending, Bahá’u’lláh declares that with this
book ‘the favor is complete, the argument fulfilled, the proof
manifest and the evidence established’. It is sometimes said that
the Hidden Words is only a statement of Bahá’u’lláh about ethics
and morality, but it is much more. The roots of the social
teaching are there as well.

A Bahá’í author, in evaluating the English rendering of the
Hidden Words by Shoghi Effendi, has written that it provides ‘a
clear, understandable, and beautiful text, [in] . . . a proper style of
English befitting scripture that . . . evoke[s] in the reader the
attitude of reverence and respect reserved for a religious text’
(VSE 134).

There is an excellent résumé of the contents of the Hidden
Words in the Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá’í Faith:

> In it [the Hidden Words] Bahá’u’lláh assures the reader of
> God’s love. God has made human beings noble, and they
> should cleanse their hearts so that they might find the divine
> light within themselves. The human heart is God’s home and
> the human spirit his place of revelation. This is their natural
> station, but human beings busy themselves with the world
> (‘that which perisheth’), and thus lose sight of their true
> natures. Instead, they should commune with God and free
> themselves from the ‘prison’ of self and the ‘fetters’ of
> worldly attachments. They should bring themselves to ac-
> count each day; sorrow only at their separation from God; not
> fear death; follow divine law; submit themselves to God;
> accept trials for God’s sake; ready themselves for martyr-
> dom; neither fear abasement nor rejoice in prosperity; not
> vaunt themselves over the poor (who are God’s trust), but
> rather bestow God’s wealth upon them; not breathe the sins
> of others, nor exalt themselves over others, nor commit
> iniquity; eschew covetousness, envy and malice; be forbear-
> ing with others; avoid fellowship with the ungodly; distin-
> guish themselves by their deeds; plant only ‘the rose of love’
> in the garden of the heart; and work to support themselves.
> They should know that a ‘new garden’ had appeared,
> inhabited by heavenly beings. They should seek to learn the
> mysteries of its love and wisdom. God is always close to
> them, but they heedlessly ignore him. They should seize their
> chance before the ‘fleeting moment’ of their lives is ended.

\[56\] TRANSLATIONS

2\. The Kitáb-i-Íqán

Shoghi Effendi describes this work in the following words: ‘A
model of Persian prose, of a style at once original, chaste and
vigorous, and remarkably lucid, both cogent in argument and
matchless in its irresistible eloquence, this Book, setting forth in
outline the Grand Redemptive Scheme of God, [the Kitáb-i-Íqán]
occupies a position unequalled by any work in the entire range
of Bahá’í literature, except the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh’s
Most Holy Book’ (GPB 138–9). The Guardian also refers to the
book as a ‘unique repository of inestimable treasures’,
possessing an ‘unsurpassed pre-eminence among the doctrinal’
Writings of Bahá’u’lláh (GPB 139).

Shoghi Effendi’s English translation of this work was first
published in 1931. The great Bahá’í Persian scholar, Mírzá
Abu’l-Faḍl, used to say that as a non-believer, after reading the
Íqán, he could not fully grasp the greatness of this work.
However, when he began rereading it, with the eye of faith, he
could discover infinite pearls of wisdom concealed within the
shells of the revealed words. While ostensibly demonstrating to
the eldest uncle of the Báb, in reply to his specific questions, the
truth and validity of the Báb’s spiritual station as the Promised
One of Islam, Bahá’u’lláh also implicitly discloses in this book
or Tablet His own station, at a time when He would soon openly
declare His divine Mission. Upon receiving the Tablet, the uncle
of the Báb was very impressed, but he did not immediately
become a follower of the Faith. Some time later he did, however,
become a very devoted Bahá’í.

In a letter to an individual believer, written on his behalf,
Shoghi Effendi states that in the Íqán, ‘Bahá’u’lláh gives the
keynote and explains some of the outstanding passages [of the
scriptures of the past] hoping that the friends will continue to
study the Sacred Books by themselves and unfold the mysteries
found therein’ (CC Vol. I, 212). In another letter, also written on
his behalf, he explains that ‘The friends, and particularly those

who wish to become competent and useful teachers, should
indeed consider it to be their first duty to acquaint themselves, as
thoroughly as they can, with each and every detail contained in
this Holy Book [the Kitáb-i-Íqán], so that they may be able to
present the Message in a befitting manner. It is the Guardian’s
hope, therefore, that those among the believers who have thus far
and for some reason or another, failed to make a serious study of
this important work will be stimulated to do so, and will as a
result deepen their comprehension of the essentials of the Faith’
(Letter dated 7 August 1934).

A concise and authoritative précis of the contents of this
outstanding work of Bahá’u’lláh is found in God Passes By. The
Guardian writes:

> Within a compass of two hundred pages it proclaims
> unequivocally the existence and oneness of a personal God,
> unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation,
> eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty; asserts the
> relativity of religious truth and the continuity of Divine
> Revelation; affirms the unity of the Prophets, the universality
> of their Message, the identity of their fundamental teachings,
> the sanctity of their scriptures, and the twofold character of
> their stations; denounces the blindness and perversity of the
> divines and doctors of every age; cites and elucidates the
> allegorical passages of the New Testament, the abstruse
> verses of the Qur’án, and the cryptic MuJammadan tradi-

> doubts and animosities that have sundered and kept apart the

(GPB 139)

3\. Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh

This impressive compilation of the fundamental teachings of the
Author of our Faith comprises 165 selections and was first
published in 1935. The Bahá’í world cannot adequately thank the
beloved Guardian for this inestimable gift of translating vital and
significant portions of the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh.

The title was chosen by Shoghi Effendi himself. In a letter
written on his behalf, he points out that his purpose was to pro-
vide ‘to the believers a befitting and authoritative rendering of
the fundamental teachings of the Cause regarding God, soul,
creation, the nature of Divine Manifestations and similar sub-
jects’ (GT 74). When Queen Marie of Romania read the book,
given to her through Martha Root, she expressed her gratitude to
Shoghi Effendi for this ‘wonderful book, every word of which is
precious to me, and doubly so in this time of anxiety and unrest’
(PP 219). Martha Root has also reported that the Queen had told

her, regarding the contents of the Gleanings, that ‘even doubters
would find a powerful strength in it, if they would read it alone,
and would give their souls time to expand’ (PP 219).

In a letter to the American National Assembly dated 13 May
1935, the Guardian gives a list of the subjects incorporated in the
translations to facilitate the preparation of an index. The list is as
follows:

> •   Unity of Prophets
> •   Power of the Word of God
> •   Reference to the next Manifestation
> •   Nature of Divinity
> •   Unity of God
> •   Power and influence of the Cause
> •   Justice and the Bahá’í Teachings
> •   Personality and station of Bahá’u’lláh
> •   Phenomenon of sleep and the worlds of God
> •   Prophets as Divine physicians
> •   The maturity of the world and the Bahá’í Faith
> •   Refutations of attacks on the Cause
> •   The doctrine of atonement
> •   Isaiah’s prophecy
> •   Obedience to kings and governments
•   The passing of the old world order and the birth of the

new one

4\. Prayers and Meditations

One of the distinctions of the Bahá’í Faith is that it has hundreds
of prayers revealed by its Founder, and a similar number by the
Centre of the Covenant, in addition to the prayers revealed by the
Báb, which are sprinkled throughout His Writings. This volume,
consisting of 339 pages and comprising 184 supplications of
various categories revealed by the pen of the Author of the Faith,
was published in English in 1938, under the title Prayers and
Meditations – a designation chosen by Shoghi Effendi himself.

When Shoghi Effendi sent his manuscript to George
Townshend for his input, Townshend was so overwhelmed by
the volume, and the uniqueness and beauty of these devotional
Writings that he wrote back to the Guardian: ‘It is very wonder-
ful. Nothing like it in the world’ (GT 76). Shoghi Effendi’s
former professor at the American University of Beirut wrote:
‘The translation of deep and poetic thoughts, such as those in the
Prayers and Meditations, requires an enormous amount of hard
work . . . I have told you before how much I marvel when I see
the quality of English that you use’ (PP 219).

Most of the prayers in this volume were originally revealed
by Bahá’u’lláh in Arabic, and perhaps a score or so were written
in Persian. They can be roughly divided into four categories:
first, those revealed for special occasions, such as the Obligatory
Prayers, the Prayer for the Dead, prayers for Riḍván and Naw-
Rúz, for the Fast, and for the Intercalary Days. A second
category consists of prayers suitable for reading on anniversaries
related to Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb, including the Tablet of
Visitation. The greatest number of prayers falls into the third
category, including prayers for the morning, when travelling, for
children, for protection, guidance, thanksgiving, praise of God’s
gifts, detachment, nearness to God, obedience, unity, stead-
fastness, assistance, forgiveness, and spiritual advancement. This
category also includes prayers for departed souls, for healing,
and for the victory of the Faith. The final category consists of

\[62\] TRANSLATIONS

pure meditations of Bahá’u’lláh, covering such subjects as His
contemplation of God’s bountiful grace, His own plight in the
hands of His opponents, and reflections on His evanescence in
the face of God’s compelling Will. This category of meditations
seems to be primarily meant for personal reflection. Some of
them are long; the longest one covers 22 pages.

Cases have been reported of people who felt they did not
have the capacity, or possibly willingness, to believe in the
existence of an All-Merciful God, who, after pondering the
contents of this volume, developed the inner sensitivity of
accepting the reality of a Divine Creator, and recognized the
need to turn humbly in supplication to Him, seeking guidance,
protection and assistance.

5\. Epistle to the Son of the Wolf

Revealed in 1891, this 181-page Tablet was Bahá’u’lláh’s last
major work. The ‘Wolf’ was a title given by Bahá’u’lláh to
Shaykh Muḥammad Báqir, who was responsible for the harass-
ment of Bábís and Bahá’ís in Iṣfahán, and particularly the killing
of two brothers in that city, the ‘King’ and ‘Beloved’ of martyrs.
The ‘son of the Wolf’, Shaykh Muḥammad Taqí, not only sup-
ported these tyrannical acts, but was often willing to participate
in the execution of his father’s oppressive religious decrees.

Shoghi Effendi, referring to the Epistle, states that in this
Tablet, which was the last outstanding Tablet revealed by Him,
Bahá’u’lláh ‘calls upon that rapacious priest to repent of his
acts, quotes some of the most characteristic and celebrated
passages of His own Writings, and adduces proofs establishing
the validity of His Cause’ (GPB 219). Rúḥíyyih Khánum
describes this Tablet as occupying ‘a special position of its own
in the literature of our Faith’ (PP 222). In one of his cables,
Shoghi Effendi expressed the hope that the study of this major
work of Bahá’u’lláh would ‘contribute further enlightenment
deeper understanding verities on which effective prosecution

teaching administrative undertakings ultimately depend’ (PP
221).

A summary of the contents of this Tablet is given in the
Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá’í Faith, as follows:
‘Bahá’u’lláh called on the shaykh to repent of his wrongdoing
and beseech God’s forgiveness; declared his own mission to be
God’s cause; summarized some of his own teachings and cited
passages from his own earlier works; noted the transforming
effect he had had on the Bábís (turning them away from sedition
to goodly deeds); called for protection for his followers from
religious persecution and martyrdom; presented biblical pro-
phecies fulfilled by his coming; [and] lamented the behaviour of
Ṣubḥ-i-Azal and his followers . . .’ (CEBF 133).

The receipt of the Epistle only inflamed the fury of the
shaykh. There is little doubt that the Manifestation of God would
have known what the reaction to His call would be, especially on
the part of such a despicable character. We can well assume that
Bahá’u’lláh’s intention may have been to provide for believers
and seekers alike an anthology of His major pronouncements
during His Ministry. One of the distinctive features of this Tablet
is that Bahá’u’lláh quotes passages from Writings He had
previously revealed, as indicated by the Guardian above.

The nature of revelation has been described by Bahá’u’lláh
in the Tablet of Wisdom, in which He says that whenever He
wishes to quote from what is revealed or written in the past, there
appears ‘before the face of thy Lord in the form of a tablet all
that which hath appeared in the world and is revealed in the
Holy Books and Scriptures’ (TB 149). It might not to be unwar-
ranted to infer that whenever He was quoting from previously
revealed Tablets, He would essentially rereveal them at the given
time. This conclusion would seem to be confirmed by the fact
that, in more than one case, a slight difference of wording, but
not of meaning, exists between the two versions of the text.
Shoghi Effendi, when rendering his translations, took notice of
these changes, and adjusted his own English text accordingly.

6\. Translated passages selected from the Writings of the Central
Figures of the Faith included in Shoghi Effendi’s letters and
other works

In ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablets, we sometimes come across quota-
tions of passages revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in support of subjects
the Master is addressing. This practice was followed by Shoghi
Effendi, and indeed raised to the level of a consummate skill. He
was wont to quote liberally from the Writings of the Central
Figures of the Faith whenever he felt that those passages would
either confirm or shed a new light on his theme.

Three of the Guardian’s major works have the distinction of
quoting profusely from the Writings: these are the Advent of
Divine Justice, The Promised Day is Come, and God Passes By.
Some of these passages had already been translated in previous
works, such as Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh.
However, quite a number were renderings shared with the friends
for the first time. Of this latter category we find the greatest
number in The Promised Day is Come. Of particular interest are
the quotations included by him towards the end of The Advent of
Divine Justice. These nine pages of citations consist of a series of
paragraphs, each of which treats a separate subject. Some of the
themes are as follows: the blessedness of individual services, the
importance of God’s mighty Day, the omnipotent power of
God’s Revelation, the heedlessness of the world and its godless
civilization, the adversities and oppositions ordained for the
Bahá’í community, the need to arise to teach, to scatter and to
proclaim the Faith of God, and the promise that a new race of
men would rise to ensure the victory of the Faith.

C. Comments on Shoghi Effendi’s genius in his translation
work

In Star of the West, Vol. 14, we read a note from the editor of
this periodical reminiscing about his pilgrimage in Haifa in 1919.

He writes, ‘When we were sitting in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá one evening in Haifa in the autumn of 1919, He spoke of
the need of a great Bahá’í translator, like Fitzgerald, whose
masterful translation made famous the poems of the Persian poet,
‘Umar Khayyám’ (SW Vol. 14, No. 8, 250).

There is an immature and indeed faulty conception in the
teachings promulgated by the churches in Christianity to the
effect that after the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, in the wake of the
Pentecostal episode, His disciples were suddenly blessed by the
gift of speaking in other tongues. According to the Bible,
‘tongues like as of fire’ (Acts 2: 3) came and sat on the heads of
these disciples, and when they came out of the meeting, they
found that they could speak in all tongues. It is the belief of some
of the churches that this gift allowed them to spread abroad the
teachings of Christ in many lands by enabling the disciples to
speak in the language of the local people. The metaphorical style
used in this passage has been, unfortunately, misunderstood.
Certainly what was meant by ‘tongue’ was the ability of the
Disciples to adapt their teaching to the degree of receptivity of
the people. It was the gift of wisdom in their utterance rather
than linguistic capacity which was intended. Webster’s dic-
tionary defines one of the meanings of the word ‘tongue’ as: ‘the
manner or quality of utterance, with respect to the sense of what
is expressed or the intention of the speaker’.

In this Dispensation, we see that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá needed a
translator to interpret the talks He delivered in the West. There
is, for instance, a little notebook on display in the International
Archives Building which includes words in English with their
phonetic pronunciation, as well as their meaning, written in
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s own hand. It is also known that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
was able to say a few simple sentences in English during His
Western tours, but as stated above, He needed an interpreter for
His major talks.

It is in this light that we have to understand the plan of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá not only to send Shoghi Effendi to school to learn

\[66\] TRANSLATIONS

languages other than his own, but eventually to send him to one
of the colleges of Oxford University to perfect his English.
During the period when he was in England, in personal letters to
some of his friends Shoghi Effendi made such comments as
these:

> I have been immersed in my studies – all having as an end a
> better ability in translating the words of Baha’u’llah and a
> fuller knowledge and better expression in expounding its
> principles. (The Chosen Highway, and SEO 77)

> I am engaged in this land, day and night, in perfecting my-
> self in the art of translation . . . I do not have a moment’s
> rest. Thank God that to some extent at least the results are
> good. (PP 37)

> God be praised, I am in good health and full of hope and
> trying to the best of my ability to equip myself for those
> things I shall require in my future service to the Cause. My
> hope is that I may speedily acquire the best that this country
> and this society have to offer and then return to my home and
> recast the truths of the Faith in a new form, and thus serve the
> Holy Threshold. (PP 37)

These quotations indicate the degree of importance Shoghi
Effendi attached to his studies in Oxford. Nevertheless, in his
initial efforts at translation he depended a great deal on such of
his English friends as Lady Blomfield and Ethel Rosenberg to
assist him.

As we have already indicated, his earliest translation work
was his rendering of the full text of the Will and Testament of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá into English. Likewise, we have seen that in
drafting The Passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, he found it necessary to
translate several passages from the Master’s utterances. It should
be remembered that even during this early period Shoghi Effendi

was fully aware of the intention of the Authors whose Writings
he was interpreting. For example in his rendering of the text of
the Will and Testament, we find the following sentence: ‘[The
Ḥuqúq] is to be offered through the guardian of the Cause of
God, that it may be expended for . . .’ (WTA 15).

In the original Persian, the word translated here as ‘through’
is ‘raji’-bi’, which normally means ‘reverts to’. However, in the
context of the Master’s Will, Shoghi Effendi chose to translate
this term as ‘through’, possibly with the intention of drawing the
attention of the friends to the fact that he, as Guardian, was
merely the vehicle through which this fixed offering was to be
dispensed at that particular time.

While Shoghi Effendi was in London, he tried his hand at
translating the writings of Bahá’u’lláh, rendering passages from
the Hidden Words, various Tablets and Bahá’u’lláh’s letters to
the kings and rulers. He would send his translations to deepened
and well-seasoned British Bahá’ís, or to one or two of his
professors, for their input on the quality of his work.

However, when he returned to the Holy Land after ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s passing, as stated above, he found that his first duty was
to translate into English the full text of the Master’s Will and
Testament. One can well imagine how difficult and challenging
this task must have been, as he was so deeply afflicted by the
loss of his Grandfather. The modesty of Shoghi Effendi is
immediately apparent when the reader notices that throughout
the Will, ‘guardian’ is spelled with a small ‘g’, and likewise, the
word ‘branch’, when applied to himself, is lower-cased. This
modesty must have been combined with his wisdom in not
giving the impression to the friends in the West that he was in
any way claiming the same station as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. However,
13 years later, when he was writing ‘The Dispensation of
Bahá’u’lláh’, and it was necessary to quote from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
Will, we see that passages referring to himself as ‘Guardian’ or
‘Branch’ are capitalized – perhaps because he must have felt that

\[68\] TRANSLATIONS

the friends in the West had by then understood the exalted
position of the Office he was occupying.

In The Priceless Pearl, Rúḥíyyih Khánum relates that Shoghi
Effendi told her, in reference to his position as Head of the
Universal House of Justice, that although he had substituted the
milder term of ‘member for life’ in his rendering of the Master’s
Will, the exact translation would have been ‘irremovable’. We
can never confidently assume we know what Shoghi Effendi’s
motivation was, as it could have been a combination, again, of
both modesty and wisdom (PP 203–4).

A set of prayers which the friends in the East read on the
occasion of memorial gatherings, known as ‘the Exalted Words’
(Kalimát-i-‘Áliyát), revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in both Arabic and
Persian, should be mentioned in this discussion. The arrangement
of these prayers is such that the text is revealed first in Arabic,
followed by a rendition by Bahá’u’lláh Himself in the Persian
tongue. The series is revealed in this way, in pairs, first in
Arabic, then in Persian. Bahá’u’lláh, however, does not content
Himself with a simple translation: the tone of the prayers is
equally elevated and exalted in both languages. We may assume
that Shoghi Effendi could have been inspired to follow the
example of Bahá’u’lláh, except that he was now translating from
an oriental language, with its particular imagery, into a western
tongue.

In his prefatory note to the text of his translation of the Kitáb-
i-Íqán, we read the following two sentences:

> This is one more attempt to introduce to the West, in lang-
> uage however inadequate, this book of unsurpassed pre-
> eminence among the writings of the Author of the Bahá’í
> Revelation. The hope is that it may assist others in their
> efforts to approach what must always be regarded as the
> unattainable goal – a befitting rendering of Bahá’u’lláh’s
> matchless utterance. (KI vii)

Shoghi Effendi is not saying that the original is clear and his
translation is not. He is saying that he will never be able, and no
one will ever be able, to approach that matchless excellence
which is the utterance of Bahá’u’lláh. The original has that
special quality. The quotation has nothing to do with the clarity
of his translation, it is about the majesty of Bahá’u’lláh’s style.

One of my associates, who is himself a scholar and expert
translator, once wrote me the following comment on the quality
of Shoghi Effendi’s translations:

> [H]is translations set a new standard of excellence in the field
> which was not only relatively speaking better than anything
> that had gone before it, but which stood on its own merits
> side by side with the finest scriptural expressions in the
> English language, far transcending any rendering that had yet
> been made of the Muslim scriptures. So eloquent, natural
> and stirring was the language, so beautiful the thoughts
> expressed, so memorable and poignant the turns of phrase, so
> vivid and powerful the imagery, that it was possible for the
> English reader temporarily to forget [it] was something not
> originally revealed in his own tongue. (MH 30/5/96)

Unlike all other translators of Bahá’í scripture before him,
Shoghi Effendi, in his capacity as Interpreter or Expounder of the
Writings, had the unique capacity, during his ministry, not only
to translate but actually to unveil before our eyes the Author’s
full intention in writing the text. It is because of this
consideration that Shoghi Effendi invariably advised National
Assemblies in non-English-speaking lands to use his translations
as a basis for their renderings in other languages. In order to
grasp the implications of this basic fact a few examples are given
below:

1\. In Persian and Arabic, short vowels are not included in the
regular alphabet. Thus a word could be read in more than one

\[70\] TRANSLATIONS

way, and the sense would be deduced from the context of the
sentence. Two such words in the Arabic are ‘uqáb’ and ‘iqáb’. In
some previous translations of the Persian Hidden Words, the
translators assumed that the intention of Bahá’u’lláh was ‘uqáb’,
meaning ‘eagle’. Shoghi Effendi’s translation indicates that
Bahá’u’lláh had in mind ‘iqáb’, meaning ‘retribution’. Thus we
read in Persian Hidden Words, No. 63: ‘O YE PEOPLES OF
THE WORLD! Know, verily, that an unforeseen calamity is
following you, and that grievous retribution awaiteth you.’ The
early translations referred to a dangerous ‘eagle’ pursuing the
people of the world.

2\. In the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the text about the ‘Order’ of
Bahá’u’lláh, when read word for word, reads as follows: ‘Order
has been upset by reason of this most great order, and
arrangement of things has been changed because of this new way
– a way that the people of the world have not yet seen.’ The
friends in the East, and indeed the scholars among them,
understood this verse to refer to the style and format of the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas, as being different or distinct from the order of
verses revealed in past religious scriptures. When, in 1934,
Shoghi Effendi produced his translation, it was clear that the
‘order of things’ was a reference to ‘mankind’s ordered life’, and
that the ‘new order’ was Bahá’u’lláh’s new World Order. Thus
we could read, ‘The world’s equilibrium hath been upset through
the vibrating influence of this most great, this new World Order.
Mankind’s ordered life hath be revolutionized through the
agency of this unique, this wondrous System – the like of which
mortal eyes have never witnessed’ (KA ¶181).

3\. On page 168 of Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh,
there is a passage the original of which is in the Persian
language. If translated word for word, it would read something
like this: ‘The beginning and the end, as well as stillness and
motion, is manifest. In this day the beginning is seen in the end,

and motion has arisen from stillness.’ Many of the friends in
Persia had great difficulty in comprehending Bahá’u’lláh’s
intention, and different understandings developed among them,
until Shoghi Effendi’s translation appeared in Gleanings: ‘He
Who is both the Beginning and the End, He Who is both Stillness
and Motion, is now manifest before your eyes. Behold how, in
this Day, the Beginning is reflected in the End, how out of
Stillness, Motion hath been engendered’ (Gls LXXXV).

4\. In the paragraph immediately preceding the penultimate
paragraph of the Tablet of Aḥmad, we read: ‘Learn well this
Tablet, O AJmad. Chant it during thy days . . . God hath
ordained for the one who chants it . . .’ and in the penultimate
paragraph, we read: ‘Should one who is in affliction or grief read
this Tablet . . .’. In the paragraph before the penultimate one,
Bahá’u’lláh twice exhorts Aḥmad to ‘chant’ the Tablet, whereas
in the penultimate paragraph, the exhortation is to ‘read’ the
Tablet. For the average Persian or Arabic reader, the two ‘chants’
and the final ‘read’ are all derivatives of the root ‘to read’.
However, Shoghi Effendi as Interpreter chose to translate the
first occurrences of this derivative as an act of chanting. It is
interesting that the two ‘chants’ occur in the paragraph where
reference is made to the ‘reward of a hundred martyrs and a
service in both worlds’, whereas the word ‘read’ is in connection
with someone who is in affliction or grief. Could it be that
chanting calls for a form of ecstatic transport and an inner sense
of rapture, which would be closer to the state of surrendering our
will to the Will of God?

5\. In Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 340,
reference is made to the ‘lesser’ and ‘greater worlds’: ‘The All-
Merciful hath conferred upon man the faculty of vision . . . Some
have described him as the “lesser world,” when, in reality, he
should be regarded as the “greater world.”’ In Prayers and
Meditations, on p. 49, we find another reference to the two

\[72\] TRANSLATIONS

worlds, but in this case ‘Lesser’, ‘Greater’ and indeed ‘Worlds’
are all capitalized: ‘Wishing to reveal Thyself, Thou didst call
into being the Greater and Lesser Worlds, and didst choose Man
above all Thy creatures, and didst make Him a sign of both of
these worlds . . .’.

We are bound to infer that the capitalization used by Shoghi
Effendi carries the essential element of interpretation. It is useful
to remember that in the Guardian’s translations, he always
employs upper case to denote God and His Manifestations.
However, in other situations, such as when he is referring to the
human race, he uses lower case. There is no system of capital-
ization in either Persian or Arabic. This is something peculiar to
many of the western languages, including English. Even the
French have some reservation about using too many capitals.
They don’t use them often. But in English it is not so! In the
Authorized translation of the Bible the translators have made
much use of capitalization. This is the nature of the language.
When Shoghi Effendi was translating into English, he used all
the tools of the language. Then, into this frame, which consists of
the grammatical regulations and the syntactical regulations, he
pours in his interpretation. Sometimes it is majuscule, sometimes
it is minuscule, and thus we have the benefit of his interpretation.
A foolish person or a foolish publisher would say ‘Oh, there is a
mistake here. Obviously capitalization should always be used.’
Then they would probably check with some Persian Bahá’í or
non-Bahá’í or an Arab and they would see that it is the same
word! This is why the manuscripts of Shoghi Effendi’s trans-
lations are precious! In the Archives Building is kept everything
which he wrote, whether by hand or using his typewriter. They
are preserved there, so that they remain intact. There we can
verify that there is capitalization in one case and not in another.

The original word used by Bahá’u’lláh in both the passage
from Gleanings and that from Prayers and Meditations is
‘insan’, which means ‘man’. The Guardian understood the
statement in Gleanings to refer to man as a member of the human

race, whereas from the context of the original in Prayers and
Meditations he concluded that the word ‘insan’ was a reference
to the Manifestation of God (Gls CLX and PM XXXVIII).
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in Some Answered Questions, clarifies the
distinction between these two stations in the following words:

> [T]his terrestrial globe at one time did not exist, and at its
> beginning man did not appear upon it. But from the
> beginning which has no beginning, to the end which has no
> end, a Perfect Manifestation always exists. This Man of
> Whom we speak is not every man; we mean the Perfect Man.

(SAQ 196)

It would be helpful to compare extracts from two early
translations by others of the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, in order
appreciate the degree of excellence that characterized Shoghi
Effendi’s renditions:

1\. An English translation of the Hidden Words was published
by the Cairo Bahá’í Assembly in 1921, just prior to the passing
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The translation was made by Mrs J. Stannard,
and was considered in the West as being the best rendition thus
far of this major work of the Blessed Beauty. The translation of
Arabic Hidden Word number 3 reads: ‘O Son of Man! In my
ancient and eternal Being, knew I my love in thee, therefore did I
create thee, and laid on thee My Image, and revealed to thee My
Beauty.’ Shoghi Effendi’s rendering of this stanza is as follows:
‘O SON OF MAN! Veiled in My immemorial being and in the
ancient eternity of My essence, I knew My love for thee;
therefore I created thee, have engraved on thee Mine image and
revealed to thee My beauty’ (HW Arabic, No. 3).

2\. At a time when E.G. Browne was still well-disposed
towards the Faith, he translated the Tablet of Bahá’u’lláh to
Náṣiri’d-Dín Sháh. We set out below the rendition this well-

\[74\] TRANSLATIONS

known English scholar, who had studied both Persian and Arabic
thoroughly, made of this Tablet, and Shoghi Effendi’s translation
of the same passage.

E.G. Browne’s version reads: ‘O King, verily I was as (any)
one amongst mankind, slumbering upon my couch. The gales of
the All-Glorious passed by me, and taught me the knowledge of
what has been . . . This is a leaf which the breezes of the Will of
thy Lord, the Mighty, the Extolled, have stirred. Can it be still
when the rushing winds blow? No, by the Lord of the Names and
Attributes! Rather do they move it as they list (for) Being
belongeth not to Non-entity in presence of the Eternal . . . O
King, look with the gaze of justice upon thy servant; then
decide according to the right concerning what hath befallen
him’ (TN 395).

Shoghi Effendi’s translation is as follows: ‘O King! I was but
a man like others, asleep upon My couch, when lo, the breezes of
the All-Glorious were wafted over Me, and taught Me the
knowledge of all that hath been . . . This is but a leaf which the
winds of the will of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Praised, have
stirred. Can it be still when the tempestuous winds are blowing?
Nay, by Him Who is the Lord of all Names and Attributes! They
move it as they list. The evanescent is as nothing before Him
Who is the Ever-Abiding . . . Look upon this Youth, O King, with
the eyes of justice; judge thou, then, with truth concerning what
hath befallen Him’ (SLH 98).

The friends all over the world, and more particularly through-
out the English-speaking West, should be grateful to the Blessed
Beauty that through the operation of His All-Compelling Will,
He provided for His ‘sacred and youthful branch’ the ‘primal
branch of the Divine and Sacred Lote-Tree’ to be not only the
Head of His Faith after ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, but also the peerless
translator and interpreter of the Holy Writ (WTA 11 and 3).

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. If knowledge is a light that God casts into the heart of
whomsoever He willeth, and we know that the Manifestation
has not undertaken any schooling, why is the gift of language
not conferred upon these suns and their moons?

A. I don’t know. But it is important to remember that ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá was not a Manifestation of God. Bahá’u’lláh was a
Manifestation of God. One of Their powers of the Manifestations
of God is that They are ‘omniscient at will’ (UD 449). This
means that They know whatever They want, whenever They
want. Bahá’u’lláh has written: ‘Thou knowest full well that We
perused not the books which men possess and We acquired not
the learning current amongst them, and yet whenever We desire
to quote the sayings of the learned and of the wise, presently
there will appear before the face of thy Lord in the form of a
tablet all that which hath appeared in the world and is revealed
in the Holy Books and Scriptures’ (TB 149). That is one of the
qualities of all the Manifestations of God, not only Bahá’u’lláh.
A Manifestation of God, Bahá’u’lláh says, can do anything. He
has the power given by God to do anything. Remember the story
of the messenger sent by the divines to meet Bahá’u’lláh in
Baghdád. The messenger asked Bahá’u’lláh to vindicate the high
station that the people attributed to Him. He told the messenger,
‘Go thou to the people, and tell them: “Ask whatsoever ye
please. Powerful is He to do what He willeth. Nothing
whatsoever, be it of the past or of the future, can frustrate His
Will.” Say: “O ye congregation of the divines! Choose any
matter ye desire, and ask your Lord, the God of Mercy, to reveal
it unto you. If He fulfil your wish, by virtue of His sovereignty,
believe ye then in Him, and be not of those that reject His truth”’
(Gls LXVII). What a statement to make! They could have said
that they wanted Him to speak in all the languages of the world!

\[76\] TRANSLATIONS

Q. You said that the meaning of the Apostles speaking in
tongues has been misunderstood by many Christians. Where
is the reference for this interpretation?

A. This explanation, as I recall, was taken from one of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s table talks that were published in Star of the West. The
article is a written version of an oral statement of the Master.
Beyond this, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written that ‘shining stars’ will
arise in the Bahá’í Faith who will ‘speak in every tongue’. It is
clear what He intended to say (Sels 252, 251).

Q. Before the first translations of the Guardian, except for
The Hidden Words published in Cairo, were any of the
Writings of Bahá’u’lláh available to the friends of the West?

A. In addition to The Hidden Words as is mentioned here, there
was the Kitáb-i-Iqán, which was translated by ‘Alí Qúlí Khán
into English. In the days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá there were many
prayers revealed by Bahá’u’lláh that were translated into
English. They were not published as a prayer book as such, but
were found in the early volumes of Star of the West. A number of
Tablets, including the Tablet of Visitation and Tablet of Carmel,
for example, were translated and published. But they were all
sprinkled in various volumes of Star of the West.

Q. The friends in the West had heard ‘Abdu’l-Bahá say
wonderful things about the Hidden Words, and they had
been translated previous to Shoghi Effendi’s edition. Were
the friends in the East equally aware of this station of the
Hidden Words?

A. Many of them would have been aware, but not all, because
not all the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Bahá’u’lláh were
available to the friends everywhere. There were no publishing

trusts in those days. The first publication of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Writings was made in 1890 in India. The Writings of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá were circulated written in longhand, but not printed until
towards the end of the Master’s life. They would be available in
various kinds of photographic prints so that the friends would be
able to read them.

In the West, similar things took place. If someone received a
letter or a translation in the West, he would sit down and put four
or five carbons in his typewriter and make copies so that he
could distribute it to his friends and tell them to make even more
copies. This was how the Tablets were available to the friends.

Q. According to Shi’ih belief, there are other books in the
possession of the Imáms, as well as the Hidden Book of
FáIimih. Is there anything mentioned in the Bahá’í writings
concerning these books?

A. I have not seen any myself. I have not read every single
Tablet of Bahá’u’lláh, but in the ones that I have read, I have
found no reference to books in the possession of the Imáms, such
as the Hidden Words.

Q. The Hidden Book of FáIimih is said ‘to consist of words of
consolation addressed by the angel Gabriel, at God’s
command, to Fá*imih, and dictated to the ‘Imam ‘Alí, for the
sole purpose of comforting her in her hour of bitter anguish
after the death of her illustrious Father’ (GPB 140). Where is
the association between the Book of FáIimih and the Hidden
Words, since the latter consists of a code of ethical
behaviour? How does this correlate with words of
consolation? Is it our limited capacity that prevents us from
understanding the connection?

A. Actually, there are some very clear references to death in the
Hidden Words. Take, for example, the well-known verse, ‘O

\[78\] TRANSLATIONS

SON OF THE SUPREME! I have made death a messenger of joy
to thee. Wherefore dost thou grieve? I made the light to shed on
thee its splendor. Why dost thou veil thyself therefrom?’ (HW
No. 32, Arabic) Could this not be seen as a consolation to
someone in grief? There are also many passages that refer to
death in an indirect way.

However, the really important aspect of this book is that it
contains all the eternal and heavenly principles of life. This
would have lifted Fáṭimih to a higher level of realization and
faith. It would have raised her thinking to the station of maturity,
by enhancing her values and enriching her spiritual insights. In
this way, it is an indirect consolation to the heart of somebody
who is grieving.

Q. Several passages in Gleanings deal with the subject of the
transmutation of metals and the Divine Elixir. I find these
very difficult to understand, probably because I am
unfamiliar with the ancient art of alchemy. What is the
meaning of these statements?

A. It is possible that the statements have a spiritual meaning as
well as a physical one. The Divine Elixir is a reference to the
Word of God, which can transmute the copper of our souls into
gold. The Word of God can transmute the copper of the majority
of humanity into gold too, bringing about the Golden Age of the
Cause. God has this power, the Faith has this power. Thus, trans-
mutation is sometimes clearly referred to in a spiritual sense. As
Bahá’u’lláh states: ‘These few have been endued with the Divine
Elixir that can, alone, transmute into purest gold the dross of the
world, and have been empowered to administer the infallible
remedy for all the ills that afflict the children of men’ (Gls XCII).

However, it is also true that metal can be transmuted. Copper
can become gold, and, in fact, gold can become copper. This
type of transmutation is done through the bombardment of the
atom with subatomic particles, which is an extremely expensive

process. Therefore, it is still cheaper to produce gold by mining
than by atomic bombardment. I don’t think Bahá’u’lláh was
referring to atomic bombardment. He was talking about alchemy.
He meant that there is a real elixir which can be applied to baser
metals to transform them into gold.

Bahá’u’lláh has given us three signs for the maturity of the
world. These three signs are mentioned in the annotations of The
Kitáb-i-Aqdas. One is the adoption of a universal language. The
second is the time when the rulers will not be willing to assume
leadership. The third is the discovery of a radical approach to the
transmutation of elements. Bahá’u’lláh received many letters
from Bahá’ís who wanted to know how to change copper into
gold! He did not give direct answers and He used a veiled
language. I can assure you that if you read them you’d not under-
stand! If a compilation were made of all He wrote about alchemy
it would be the size of the Kitáb-i-Íqán. I myself have read and
reread them. Bahá’u’lláh says that He has used a veiled language
so that robbers and thieves will not abuse this knowledge. When
humanity is mature, Bahá’u’lláh will remove the veil.

It is just like what Shoghi Effendi said about the Will and
Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: ‘To attempt to estimate its full
value, and grasp its exact significance after so short a time since
its inception would be premature and presumptuous on our part.
We must trust to time, and the guidance of God’s Universal
House of Justice, to obtain a clearer and fuller understanding of
its provisions and implications’ (BA 62). For many years,
nobody understood much about the Aghṣán and the matter of
succession. After the passing of Shoghi Effendi, the Universal
House of Justice was able to clarify the matter for us. They wrote
three long letters about it. The first is called ‘The Guardianship’,
the second ‘Election and Infallibility of the Universal House of
Justice’, and the third ‘The Guardianship and the Universal
House of Justice’. These letters can be found in a thick book
called Messages from the Universal House of Justice 1963–1986.
They lifted the veil for all of us to see.

\[80\] TRANSLATIONS

Q. Sometimes, for example in the Epistle to the Son of the
Wolf, Bahá’u’lláh Himself reveals a Tablet a second time.
Why is it that He sometimes changed a word or two? Is it
because He did not remember the original word and so He
put in a new word instead, or He was not satisfied with the
original?

A. We have to understand this very clearly. When Bahá’u’lláh
rerevealed His Tablets, some were repeated exactly as before,
while in the case of those that were altered, the degree of change
varied from case to case. One Tablet He rerevealed was a very
outstanding Tablet, the Súriy-i-Haykal. He wrote it in the early
years of His ministry, addressing the Bábí community at that
time. Later, when He wanted it to be part of His major works, He
rerevealed it and made some major changes to it. The essence of
it, maybe 90 to 95 per cent, remained the same. However, He
deliberately changed parts of it, so that instead of addressing the
Bábí community, it now addressed all the peoples of the world.

In other cases, such as in the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf,
there are minor changes, often just one word. Look at how
careful Shoghi Effendi was in his translation. He did not just
reuse the translation of the Tablet he had included previously, for
example, in Gleanings. He checked word by word to make sure
that what he translated was exactly what was rerevealed.

Why did Bahá’u’lláh change one word here or another word
there? I do not know. Who knows the mind of Bahá’u’lláh?
What I wanted to show you was the loyalty, the faithfulness, the
carefulness of Shoghi Effendi in his translation work. We will
never be able to understand fully the mind of Bahá’u’lláh. It is
impossible. He said that whenever He wanted something of the
past it would come before Him in the form of a Tablet and He
would just read it, whether it was His own Writings or the
writings of anybody who came before Him. If He decided to
change a word, perhaps it was for the sake of the recipient of the
Epistle to the Son of the Wolf.

Q. Could you please elaborate on the significance of the word
‘chant’ used in the Tablet of A%mad? Does this mean that we
should always try to chant the Tablet, even if we are reading
it in a language other than Arabic or Persian?

A. The word ‘chant’ that Shoghi Effendi has used here is, in my
opinion, an expression of ecstasy, of rapture, of spiritual
upliftment and exhilaration. This is my understanding. It does
not necessarily mean that if you are reading it in a language other
than Arabic you should burst into singing it. Far from it! I think
there is an inner meaning. When we read this Tablet, it should be
with a sense of spiritual excitement, ecstasy, rapture, happiness
and joy. All the martyrs, when they went to their field of
martyrdom, did so with great joy. They did it for the sake of
Bahá’u’lláh, as an act of love. This is the point, not that you
should suddenly burst into singing that particular paragraph or
that you should chant the entire Tablet. Basically, when we read
it we should be in that condition of spiritual attunement to the
music of the Kingdom. This is when you surrender your will to
the Will of God. When you read the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh
about the meaning of martyrdom, He says that there are two
types of martyrdom, physical martyrdom and spiritual
martyrdom. Physical martyrdom is very clear. Spiritual
martyrdom, He says, is when you submit, surrender, and you
subordinate your will to the Will of God. This attitude of
detachment – from your own wishes, from your own will, from
your own preferences, in favour of the Will of God, whatever
may be His good-pleasure, is what represents true spiritual
martyrdom. If you are able to surrender your will to the Will of
God, you have attained the condition of supreme martyrdom.
You are then detached and you are happy about your
detachment. You are freeing your soul from the attachments of
this world and you are happy.

\[82\] TRANSLATIONS

On the subject of chanting, Shoghi Effendi has written that
Persian, Arabic and Hebrew lend themselves to chanting. Other
languages do not quite lend themselves. Some do, and I am of
the opinion that Italian is one of them; but not all.

In English there is a tendency to put the accent of a word, if it
is more than one syllable, at the beginning. If the word has only
one syllable, obviously the accent is on it. Once it becomes two
syllables, there is a tendency in English to put the accent on the
first syllable, not on the second. There are other languages, such
as Persian, Arabic and Hebrew, that put the accent on the second
and not on the first. If there are three syllables, there is a
tendency in English again to push the accent towards the
beginning. It is either on the first or the second syllable. But in
Persian, for example, the accent is often on the final syllable.

Q. Who translated most of the prayers in our prayer books?

A. I think most, if not all, of the prayers of Bahá’u’lláh that you
find in the prayer books were translated by Shoghi Effendi.
However, when it comes to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, it is mixed. Some of
them are translations by Shoghi Effendi, some are translations by
others. These have been checked with the original texts from
‘Abdu’l-Bahá that are at the World Centre and they were
considered to be acceptable. Regarding the prayers of the Báb,
except for the ‘Remover of Difficulties’ and perhaps one other
short one, they were translated by the World Centre under the
authority of the Universal House of Justice.

Q. Who is the author of A Concise Encyclopaedia of the
Bahá’í Faith?

A. Dr Peter Smith.

Q. You said that Professor Browne made some translations
of Bahá’u’lláh’s writings at a time when he was still well

disposed towards the Faith. What does this mean? Was there
a time that he was not well disposed towards the Faith?

A. There was a time when he was very well disposed. In the
beginning, when he first travelled to Iran, he was truly unbiased,
and he wrote A Year among the Persians at that time. He came to
Iran in order to investigate. He didn’t take any particular side,
neither the side of Azal, nor that of Bahá’u’lláh, nor that of
anyone else. Through his investigations he met with many
Bahá’ís, and there was even some praise of them in his book.
Gradually, as he learned more about the Faith, he decided to
travel to the Holy Land to meet Bahá’u’lláh. He was graciously
granted interviews with the Blessed Beauty, and he was the only
Western scholar to ever meet Him personally. It was a great
honour conferred upon Professor Browne. He had four inter-
views with Bahá’u’lláh, by which time he was deeply impressed
by His personality, and the strength, power and authority he
sensed in Him.

While he was there, he also met ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for the first
time, and he wrote about Him too, saying how impressed he was
by this son of the Blessed Beauty! When leaving he took two
manuscripts with him. One was the Tablet of Bahá’u’lláh to
Náṣiri’d-Dín Sháh. This Tablet has an attachment, which is
another Tablet of Bahá’u’lláh concerning the meaning of true
victory. Browne translated both of them. The second manuscript
was A Traveller’s Narrative.

Some time after leaving ‘Akká, he went to Cyprus and met
Ṣubḥ-i-Azal and other Azalís. Gradually those people confused
him, as they had changed the history books that had been written
by early Bábís. They made him believe that what they had forged
was a true history of the life of the Báb and the teachings of the
Báb. Professor Browne seemed to be siding now with Ṣubḥ-i-
Azal. We do not know whether he was truly convinced of the
truth of what they told him, because maybe he had other motives.
We will never know the mind of this man. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá does

\[84\] TRANSLATIONS

write in one of His Tablets that he had political motives as well,
which were added to whatever influence the Azalís had. Their
manoeuvrings turned him away from the Faith. Yet he kept up a
correspondence with the Bahá’ís, including ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Him-
self, who would reply and who met him during His visits to
England. While Shoghi Effendi was in Oxford, he was hoping to
meet Professor Browne, but this never happened.

Q. Why did Bahá’u’lláh use a term such as ‘choice wine’ as
an analogy for His Writings and for His laws?

A. Alcohol and wine are symbols for intoxication. In this
context, however, spiritual intoxication is intended. Shoghi
Effendi has described the early believers and martyrs as ‘God-
intoxicated heroes’. There is another analogy in the writings
about the fragrance of the rose. Now, in some countries they do
not have roses. My wife, Violette, tells a story that she heard
from Rúḥíyyih Khánum about a pilgrim who had come from
Alaska. This is a place where apparently roses do not exist and
this pilgrim did not know what Bahá’u’lláh meant when He
talked about the fragrance of the rose. Shoghi Effendi gave a
little bottle of attar of rose to the pilgrim on the last day of
pilgrimage. He said, ‘Take this and show it to the local Bahá’í
friends in Alaska so they know at least what a rose smells like.’

Q. Could possible translations in the future be made of texts
that Shoghi Effendi has already translated? Is that
recommended?

A. In a prefatory note to his translation of the Kitáb-i-Iqán,
Shoghi Effendi made the following statement: ‘This is one more
attempt to introduce to the West, in language however
inadequate, this book of unsurpassed preeminence among the
writings of the Author of the Bahá’í Revelation. The hope is that
it may assist others in their efforts to approach what must always

be regarded as the unattainable goal – a befitting rendering of
Bahá’u’lláh’s matchless utterance’ (KI vii). I think that this
means that it is impossible to convey the exact beauty and
majesty of Bahá’u’lláh’s original words. However, it is highly
improbable that Shoghi Effendi’s translations would ever be
discarded. Shoghi Effendi was not only a translator. When he
was translating, he was interpreting. There are many things that
are not clear in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh. You might read it in
the original and you wouldn’t know what it really means. Shoghi
Effendi’s translation is an exposition of the real meaning
deposited in the words.

Q. How exactly was the Kitáb-i-Aqdas translated?

A. There is a clear reference in the writings of Shoghi Effendi
that a translation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas would be made in the
future. He himself translated numerous passages from the Kitáb-
i-Aqdas, totalling about one-third of the Book. However, he
included them in Gleanings without specifying their source.
When Bahá’u’lláh quotes Himself, as in the Epistle to the Son of
the Wolf, He occasionally quotes from the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, so the
Guardian also translated those passages. When he wrote The
Promised Day Is Come and needed to quote the Tablets and
Writings of Bahá’u’lláh addressed to different kings, some of
these passages were in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, so he translated them
as well. When all of these translations are put together, as
previously mentioned, about one-third of the Book is translated
by the Guardian himself. In addition to that, he prepared copious
notes for the book that was published in 1973 by the Universal
House of Justice under the title of A Synopsis and Codification of
the Laws and Ordinances of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. These notes were
handed over to the Universal House of Justice after his passing
by Rúḥíyyih Khánum. Few final touches were needed, so the
House of Justice appointed a special committee for this purpose.

\[86\] TRANSLATIONS

Shoghi Effendi had said that when the time came for the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas to be translated it would have to be accompanied
by copious notes, to give the background explaining some of the
references made by Bahá’u’lláh. Thus, the House of Justice
appointed a special committee that consisted of most of its
members at that time who had greater experience to help in this
important project. It took many years of work. The committee
had the assistance not only of individual Bahá’ís at the World
Centre who were helpful to it, as well as the Research Depart-
ment, but also some well-known scholars of the Faith in different
parts of the world who were contacted for their opinions about
various ways of translating specific passages. They had to gather
all of this material and produce this translation, which was then
discussed in full during the plenary sessions of the House of
Justice itself, with full membership. The draft was presented to
the House of Justice itself and in its meetings everything was
reread and rediscussed. Thus, it took many years to produce.

Q. Who put the questions to Bahá’u’lláh that we find
answered in ‘Questions and Answers’ included in the Kitáb-
i-Aqdas?

A. Shoghi Effendi refers to ‘Questions and Answers’ as an annex
to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. They were put together by one of the
scholars of our Faith in the days of Bahá’u’lláh named Zaynu’l-
Muqarrabín. He was transcribing the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh,
and lived in Mosul for a long time, until Bahá’u’lláh asked him
to come to the World Centre, where he eventually passed away.
He himself put numerous questions to Bahá’u’lláh. However,
there were other believers asking questions as well. He gathered
all of the questions and answers and added them to the
compilation. Thus, it was not, as some may be misguided to
believe, that somebody asked Bahá’u’lláh for an interview to put
all these questions to Him at once. It was done gradually, by
Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín gathering the Tablets, understanding what

the question was, putting them together and arranging them in
some logical order. The order was also set by Zaynu’l-
Muqarrabín. Shoghi Effendi said that it should be considered as
an annex to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. The published English text
consists of the Book itself, some passages from other writings of
Bahá’u’lláh revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, which He said
should be considered as part of the Book, followed by ‘Questions
and Answers’, the synopsis and codification, and lastly the
annotations. The notes took a long time too, information having
to be gleaned from other Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, Tablets of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and letters of Shoghi Effendi that explained
specific issues.

Q. Is the Kitáb-i-Aqdas somewhat incomplete because it does
not cover many of the issues of society that would require
legislation?

A. There is an article by a non-Bahá’í scholar about the wisdom
of the way in which the Kitáb-i-Aqdas is written. The wisdom is
that although it is a book of laws, it doesn’t provide reams of
detail. Instead, Bahá’u’lláh provided for the creation of a legis-
lative body, the Universal House of Justice, to fill in the gaps
with secondary laws, which could themselves be changed by the
House of Justice to suit the conditions of the times.

The basic, essential laws that are given in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
will never be changed by the House of Justice because they are
binding. However, there are matters that need supplementary
legislation. For example the law on engagement. This has not
been universally applied yet, just as the law of Ḥuqúq’u’lláh was
only applicable to the East for many years. The law on engage-
ment basically states that the period of engagement should not
exceed 95 days. This law needs supplementary legislation. When
does the period of 95 days begin? Is parental consent necessary?
What about announcement of the engagement? What happens if
a couple cannot, for certain reasons, get married until after 95

\[88\] TRANSLATIONS

days? In the East, such questions have been asked of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, of Shoghi Effendi and of the House of Justice. Certain
answers have been given, but these must all be codified and any
gaps must be filled in before it is made into a universally
applicable law. The same thing applies to the treatment of
thieves and arsonists. There are so many aspects of these laws
that have to be determined, and this can only be done when there
is a Bahá’í state, when the laws of the Aqdas pertaining to theft,
arson, murder, and other such laws, could be implemented. I
think the establishment of a Bahá’í state lies in the distant future.
When the time comes, the Universal House of Justice will have
to look at the condition of the Bahá’í community as a whole,
review all the relevant laws of Bahá’u’lláh, study perhaps the
laws of other religions on the subject, and even the laws in
secular governments. Consider the sentence: ‘Should anyone
intentionally destroy a house by fire, him also shall ye burn’ (KA
¶62). How should the word ‘house’ be defined? Is it a house with
people living in it? Is it an empty house? Does it have furniture?
Is it a warehouse? Is it a small house or an apartment? Are there
extenuating circumstances? Likewise regarding the punishment
for theft. How should the culprit be branded? In the case of a
murder, under what circumstances will life imprisonment be
used? Such issues are briefly dealt with in the notes at the end of
The Kitáb-i-Aqdas.

Q. The translations of the beloved Guardian serve as a basis
for further translations, particularly into other western
languages. To what degree is or should the original Persian
or Arabic text be consulted or taken into consideration for
these second translations?

A. This could be very useful. Shoghi Effendi is not telling us not
to read the original Persian or Arabic, but that the final,
translated text ought to be based on what he himself has
translated, as that is much clearer. In fact, there are certain

languages, like Urdu, with many Persian and Arabic words, and
the translators into such languages do not have to go to the
English, but can translate directly from the Arabic or the Persian
of Bahá’u’lláh.

Q. George Townshend became a Bahá’í in 1921, but only left
the Church years later. What was the Guardian’s response to
this and how can we learn from this example in dealing with
friends who are still strongly attached to the Church?

A. We should not remain or become registered as members of
other religious groups, such as churches. However, there is a
difference between the instructions of Shoghi Effendi regarding
non-membership in religious communities and non-membership
in political parties. When it was about religious communities,
Shoghi Effendi used to give such advice as this: ‘Such questions
as the withdrawal from Church membership . . . should not be
thrust upon the newcomer, but explained to him gradually, so
that he himself may be convinced of the truth underlying these
ordinances of the Cause’ (LG 68). With political parties, it was
different. If you were a member of a political party you simply
had to find your way to leave immediately.

Although we may not be allowed to have membership in
other religious communities, we can still go to any church, be
it Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, or anything else. Rúḥíyyih
Khánum, whenever travelling, used to go to the houses of wor-
ship of other religions. She used to pray there, because they too
are buildings raised to the glory of God. Again, with political
parties, it is different. You should not only avoid membership
of the party, but you should not go to their meetings, to offer
your opinions in their discussions. With religions there is some
flexibility. All such matters are for the National Spiritual
Assembly to decide.

In the case of George Townshend there was no National
Assembly, but he was such an important figure that it was after

\[90\] TRANSLATIONS

consultation with the Guardian that he finally submitted his
resignation from the Church. He was over 70 years old when he
renounced his orders. It cost him his house and his pension,
because both had been provided by the church. Shoghi Effendi
then took care of this dear man who was helping him in the
translation work and he made special financial arrangements for
Mr Townshend.

Q. Why has the Bayán not been fully translated yet?

A. There are two Bayáns: the Persian Bayán and the Arabic
Bayán. These have been already translated into French by
A.L.M. Nicolas. Nicolas was the French consul in Tabríz at the
time of the martyrdom of the Báb. He heard about the Báb and
the Faith and became extremely interested. He did not become a
Bábí, but he was enamoured by the life of the Báb and His
teachings. He translated the entire Persian Bayán, which was
published in Paris in three volumes, with his own footnotes. He
also translated the Arabic Bayán. They were formerly available,
but now they have gone out of print. If you went to some of the
old libraries in Paris, you would probably find some copies of
them. There may be copies available in cyberspace. In any case,
it was published and Shoghi Effendi includes some quotations of
Nicolas’s translations in the footnotes to The Dawn-Breakers.

The laws of the Bayán are not applicable to us today. They
were abrogated by Bahá’u’lláh. That is why there is no urgent or
acute need for an authoritative translation. These two Books are
available in French for anyone who wants to read them in the
West.

IV
The Dawn-Breakers
Background

Amatu’l-Bahá Rúḥíyyih Khánum describes The Dawn-Breakers,
Nabíl’s chronicle, as ‘a classic among epic narratives in the
English tongue’ (PP 215). The author was Muḥammad Zarandí,
who wrote his narrative in Persian. Bahá’u’lláh gave him the title
of ‘Nabíl-i-A‘`am’, which means ‘the most great Nabíl’. Nabíl,
in both Persian and Arabic, means ‘noble’, or ‘excellent’, and
according to the Abjad reckoning, the two words Muḥammad
and Nabíl have equivalent numerical values. Zarand is a town in
one of the outlying districts of Tehran. Nabíl was on a visit in a
nearby locality in Rubat-Karim when he heard for the first time
that a merchant in Shiraz had declared Himself as the Promised
One of Islam. He soon pursued his interest in the new Faith by
contacting those who were among the most prominent believers
of the Báb, and became a Bábí around the year 1847. During that
period he met Bahá’u’lláh twice, once in Kirmánsháh, and once
in Tehran.

After the Báb’s martyrdom, Nabíl specially undertook a visit
to Baghdád, and it was there that he caught a glimpse of the true
station of Bahá’u’lláh. He decided to devote the rest of his life
to serving and promoting the interests of the Bahá’í Faith. He
was also a poet, and endowed with a powerful pen as well as
a retentive memory. He composed many poems in praise
of Bahá’u’lláh. Shoghi Effendi called him the ‘Poet-Laureate’
of the Blessed Beauty (GPB 130). When Shoghi Effendi was

THE DAWN-BREAKERS

drawing up a list of outstanding believers to be named as
‘Apostles of Bahá’u’lláh’, he included Nabíl.

Nabíl travelled a great deal, and many of his journeys were
undertaken at the behest of Bahá’u’lláh. During his extensive
travels he met eminent Bábís and Bahá’ís and made copious
notes of what he had heard from them regarding significant
episodes in the history of the Faith. He later met the faithful
brother of Bahá’u’lláh, Mírzá Músá, who provided him with
important details related to Bábí and Bahá’í history. His close
friends often encouraged him to write his memoirs, but he
refused to do so. He finally agreed that he would proceed with
such a project only if Bahá’u’lláh would give His permission.
The matter was presented to Bahá’u’lláh through His amanu-
ensis, and the suggestion was highly approved by the Blessed
Beauty. In two Tablets addressed to Nabíl, Bahá’u’lláh gave him
clear instructions about the narrative he was to set in writing. He
was advised neither to overstate nor understate, neither to expand
the description of events nor reduce their importance (Athar,
Vol. 4, 184–5; 193–4). According to one of the Persian scholars,
he was also told, possibly orally, that he should be strictly factual
and his narrative should be free from doubtful reports and
assumptions (NZ 54).

Nabíl started writing his history in the year 1887–8 and it
took him a year and a half to complete (NZ 57). In the preface to
The Dawn-Breakers, Nabíl states that what he has recorded is ‘a
description of the episodes I myself have witnessed, as well as
those that have been reported to me by trustworthy and
recognised informants, specifying in every case their names and
standing’ (DB lxiii). According to a statement made by the
Research Department at the World Centre, the following process
for submission of his work to Bahá’u’lláh is described: ‘Nabíl
composed the draft pages of his history without any extensive re-
editing or corrections and submitted them in quires to Mírzá Áqá
Ján. Upon their return to Nabíl, ten months after the submission
of the final quire, with corrections to be made (how these

corrections were indicated is not explained), Nabíl made the
requested corrections to the text of the draft manuscript as well
as adding an appendix containing further material from the
Baghdad period which had been omitted’ (RD 9/11/05).

As stated by the Research Department, corrections had to be
made to his original draft. What was available to the beloved
Guardian was only the original uncorrected draft. In God Passes
By, Shoghi Effendi points out that Muḥammad-‘Alí and his
family ‘carried off, by a ruse, the two satchels containing
[Bahá’u’lláh’s] most precious documents’ (GPB 249) immedi-
ately after the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh. Among the stolen
documents, according to a Tablet revealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, was
the text of the corrected version of Nabíl’s narrative. If this
revised version is ever found and acquired by the World Centre,
then, obviously, experts will have to look at the document to see
if anything has been changed or any word corrupted or inter-
polated, or anything of that nature. In such an event, the House
of Justice may decide what needs to be done. We cannot be sure
that the revised version will ever be recovered.

It must be remembered that, apart from A Traveller’s
Narrative, the friends did not have in their possession a detailed
account of the heroic exploits that characterized the lives of the
early believers of the Báb’s Dispensation. In a cable dated
1 November 1931 to the National Assembly of the United States
and Canada, Shoghi Effendi describes the contents of Nabíl’s
work as a ‘varied rich and authentic material [which] constitutes
most effective weapon to meet challenge of a critical hour’
(RD 9/11/05). In view of the need to make this material available
to the friends, and as the final corrected text was not in his hands,
he set himself the task of editing the original draft in the spirit of
the instructions given by Bahá’u’lláh to Nabíl. This is why, in
the final published work, the Guardian clearly states that the
book was ‘translated from the original Persian and edited by
Shoghi Effendi’.

\[94\] THE DAWN-BREAKERS

In explaining what he had to accomplish, Shoghi Effendi, in
a letter dated 15 November 1932, wrote to the friends in Iran the
following: ‘Before translating the Narrative, the text had to be
edited and corrected, and this task was undertaken by me
personally. Exaggerations and overstatements were eliminated.
The text as it stands will serve as a standard when future
histories of the Faith will be written.’ Furthermore, the original
document was a continuous and uninterrupted narrative, and
Shoghi Effendi, in order to make it more readable for Western
audiences, found it necessary to break the text down into
chapters and subheadings (RD 9/11/05). When sending his
manuscript to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United
States and Canada, his secretary wrote on his behalf: ‘the
translation of Nabíl’s Narrative and the reading of the books
(quoted in the footnotes) and arrangement of the notes have
taken a great deal of time and have entailed a considerable
amount of labour and effort. The work he is sending you is the
result of eight months of continuous labour and he hopes that the
efforts exerted will prove of service to the Cause in this critical
time’. (RD 9/11/05)

Contents of the book

As stated earlier, Mr Townshend collaborated with the beloved
Guardian in supplying the final touches to some of Shoghi
Effendi’s writings. One of the manuscripts that Mr Townshend
was asked to examine carefully was The Dawn-Breakers. In fact,
as happened later in the case of God Passes By, Shoghi Effendi
asked for input from Mr Townshend for the title of his book and
adopted the suggestion his Irish correspondent gave him. How-
ever, Shoghi Effendi was not satisfied with just The Dawn-
Breakers as a title. He felt he needed a subtitle, and added
‘Nabíl’s Narrative of the Early Days of the Bahá’í Revelation’. It
is interesting that although the book deals solely with the nine
years of the Báb’s Ministry, the subtitle still refers to the ‘Bahá’í

Revelation’, indicating that the Báb’s Ministry was not only
under the shadow of Bahá’u’lláh, but was inextricable from the
all-embracing Bahá’í Revelation.

It is not stated anywhere in The Dawn-Breakers that it is
Volume I of II. However, in volumes of The Bahá’í World,
Shoghi Effendi himself makes references to The Dawn-Breakers
as Volume I of Nabíl’s Narrative. It was the original intention of
the Guardian to produce a second volume, which would cover
the history of the Faith during the 39 years of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Ministry. However, he did not have the time to undertake this
project, and as, some 12 years later, he published God Passes By,
which included material from Nabíl’s Narrative, he must have
thought it unnecessary to produce the projected second volume
of The Dawn-Breakers. Shoghi Effendi included almost every-
thing that was in the rest of the manuscript of Nabíl in God
Passes By. Those of us who have had the opportunity of looking
at the original work of Nabíl know that the section which deals
with the Ministry of Bahá’u’lláh is quite brief. This was perhaps
because the life of Bahá’u’lláh was contemporaneous with
Nabíl’s own life and it is very natural for people to think that
things that happen in their own lifetime are not historical and, as
a result, they don’t make a record of them.

The book is dedicated to the Greatest Holy Leaf in the
following words: ‘To the Greatest Holy Leaf, the Last Survivor
of a Glorious and Heroic Age, I Dedicate This Work in Token of
a Great Debt of Gratitude and Love’.

Apart from the Table of Contents and the List of Illustrations,
the book begins with facsimiles of the Báb’s autographed Tablets
addressed to each of the eighteen Letters of the Living. The nine-
teenth is addressed to Himself, and the twentieth to Bahá’u’lláh,
the Promised One of the Bayán, ‘Him Whom God shall make
manifest’. This is followed by an Introduction of 14 pages that
Mr Townshend wrote at the behest of the Guardian and along
guidelines specifically given by Shoghi Effendi. Mr Townshend
requested that his name not appear as author of the Introduction

\[96\] THE DAWN-BREAKERS

because of the sensitive relationship that he had at that time with
his Church. Shoghi Effendi accepted this request, and refers to
him in his Acknowledgements as ‘an English correspondent’
whom he thanks for his help in the preparation of the
Introduction. Shoghi Effendi added passages from the Kitáb-i-
Íqán into the Introduction, together with extracts from Lord
Curzon’s Persia and the Persian Question, Volume 1. He also
included a statement made by E.G. Browne about features of
Shi’ah Islam, which appears in the Professor’s translation of A
Traveller’s Narrative. This is followed by a chart made out in
Shoghi Effendi’s handwriting of the ‘Genealogy of the Báb,
showing connections with Bahá’u’lláh’s descendants’.

Shoghi Effendi divided the material into two parts. Part I he
named ‘Pre-Revelation days’, and part II ‘The Revelation of the
Báb’. The first section deals briefly with the missions of Shaykh
Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í, and of Siyyid Ká`im-i-Rashtí. The second part
consists of the rest of the book, and covers the entire scope of the
life of the Báb, including His travels, Writings, the Declaration
of His Mission, the appointment of the Letters of the Living, His
pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, His successive stays in Shiraz,
in Iṣfahán, in Káshán, and ultimately in the two prison-fortresses
of Máh-Kú and Chihríq, His examination by the ulamas of
Tabriz, and finally the circumstances leading to His martyrdom.
Interspersed in his account of the Báb’s activities, Nabíl relates
Mullá Ḥusayn’s journey to Tehran to meet Bahá’u’lláh, his
subsequent journey to Khurásán, and then to Mázindarán.

Regarding Bahá’u’lláh, we read of His early journey to
Mázindarán, His participation in the conference of Badasht, His
journey to Karbilá, and His imprisonment in the Síyáh-Chál,
followed by His release and banishment to Baghdád. In his
chronicle Nabíl deals at length with the upheavals in Mázin-
darán, in Nayríz and in Zanján, together with an account of the
execution of the Seven Martyrs of Tehran. In the course of his
story he describes in great detail incidents related to the lives of

Quddús and of Ṭáhirih. He ends his book with an account of the
attempt on the Shah’s life and its consequences.

The section at the end of the book, which he titles as
‘Epilogue’, is a 17-page statement in which Shoghi Effendi gives
an overview of the Báb’s Ministry, praises the heroes it pro-
duced, and comments on the apathy of Náṣiri’d-Dín Sháh and his
hopes of uprooting the Faith. The Guardian further makes the
point that in the very act of banishing Bahá’u’lláh from His
native land, the Sháh was but an instrument in the execution of
God’s design. He goes on to say that little did Nabíl himself
imagine that, some 40 years after writing his narrative, the Cause
of Bahá’u’lláh and its fair name would have encircled the globe.

Footnotes and Bibliography

The book in its published form has some 700 pages and 200
illustrations. One third of the publication consists of footnotes,
numbering in total 646. Of these, two-thirds are in English and
one-third are in French. Approximately half are more elaborate
footnotes, a number of which are over 100 lines in length.

He calls his bibliography ‘Works consulted by the trans-
lator’. In this list we find 11 works by Bahá’u’lláh, the Báb and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and 39 works authored by others. The number of
titles of works in English is 21, works in French are 10 in
number, and there are 8 works written in Persian and/or Arabic,
making a grand total of 50 titles.

What others have said about Nabíl’s Narrative, and what Shoghi
Effendi himself stated regarding the book

Rúḥíyyih Khánum writes: ‘Although ostensibly a translation
from the original Persian, Shoghi Effendi may be said to have
recreated it in English, his translation being comparable to Fitz-
gerald’s rendering of Omar Khayyam’s Rubaiyat which gave the

\[98\] THE DAWN-BREAKERS

world a poem in a foreign language that in many ways far
exceeded the merits of the original’ (PP 215).

She further cites a well-known scholar and humanitarian,
who described it as ‘a classic and a standard for all time to come’
(PP 215), and quotes from a letter written by one of Shoghi
Effendi’s old professors: ‘The quality of the English and the
delightful ease of reading the translation are extraordinary . . .
The force of the book is very great, because the translation is so
scientific . . .’ (PP 216).

A well-known orientalist wrote to Shoghi Effendi, saying:
‘The Dawn-Breakers is really one of the most beautiful books I
have seen for many years . . . as for your English style, it really
could not be bettered’ (PP 216).

One of my own associates has written: ‘The eternal drama of
the Báb and His disciples, as he gives it to us through the
winding labyrinthine stories within stories echoed by Nabíl, rises
from the pre-dawn darkness of its beginnings, soars into the
blazing azure of an incandescent zenith only to plummet in pain
and splendour to its heart-breaking end. There never was a more
thrilling nor a more tragic trajectory than this, nor a tale more
eternal and immortal, either. He has not only translated and
interpreted Nabíl, but re-invented the literature of East and West
in the Dawn-Breakers” (BN 1).

As to his own evaluation of the contents of the book, we read
the following in a cable dated 20 June 1932 to the National
Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada:

> FEEL IMPELLED APPEAL ENTIRE BODY AMERICAN
> BELIEVERS HENCEFORTH REGARD NABÍL’S SOUL-
> STIRRING NARRATIVE AS ESSENTIAL ADJUNCT TO
> RECONSTRUCTED TEACHING PROGRAM, AS UN-
> CHALLENGEABLE TEXTBOOK IN THEIR SUMMER

> PILGRIMAGE BAHÁ’U’LLÁH’S NATIVE LAND AND AS
> UNFAILING INSTRUMENT TO ALLAY DISTRESS AND
> RESIST ATTACKS OF CRITICAL DISILLUSIONED
> HUMANITY. (TDH 3)

Furthermore, in letters addressed to individual believers,
written on his behalf by his secretaries, he repeatedly
commended the study of The Dawn-Breakers to the friends.
Extracts from four of these letters are as follows:

> The history of a people is always a source of inspiration to its
> future generations. Nabíl’s Narrative will operate in the
> same manner, and remain forever a stimulus to the Bahá’ís.

(16 December 1932)

> Shoghi Effendi found great pleasure and spiritual upliftment
> while working on the translation of Nabíl’s Narrative. The
> life of those who figure in it is so stirring that everyone who
> reads those accounts is bound to be affected and impelled to
> follow their footsteps of sacrifice in the path of Faith. The
> Guardian believes, therefore, that it should be studied by the
> friends, especially the youth who need some inspiration to
> carry them through these troubled days. (11 March 1933)

> The Guardian sincerely hopes and prays that the study of The
> Dawn-Breakers will inspire the friends to greater activity
> and more exerted energy in serving the Cause and spreading
> its message in that town. The life of those heroes of the Faith
> should teach us what true sacrifice is, and to what extent we
> should forego our personal and worldly interests while en-
> deavouring to carry the divine message to the four corners of
> the earth. (16 April 1933, LDG Vol. II, 22)

\[100\] THE DAWN-BREAKERS

Extracts

\[102\] THE DAWN-BREAKERS

Prophet? Arise in His name, put your trust wholly in Him,
and be assured of ultimate victory.’ (DB 93–4)

And yet who knows what achievements, greater than any that
the past and the present have witnessed, may not still be in
store for those into whose hands so precious a heritage has
been entrusted? . . . Who knows but that triumphs, unsur-
passed in splendour, are not in store for the mass of
Bahá’u’lláh’s toiling followers? Surely, we stand too near
the colossal edifice His hand has reared to be able, at the
present stage of the evolution of His Revelation, to claim to
be able even to conceive the full measure of its promised
glory. Its past history, stained by the blood of countless
martyrs, may well inspire us with the thought that, whatever
may yet befall this Cause, however formidable the forces that
may still assail it, however numerous the reverses it will
inevitably suffer, its onward march can never be stayed, and
that it will continue to advance until the very last promise,
enshrined within the words of Bahá’u’lláh, shall have been
completely redeemed. (DB 667–8)

Q. In Nabíl’s Narrative, Mullá Jusayn says that he seemed to
be the voice of the angel Gabriel personified. Does it mean
that he felt Gabriel spoke through him?

A. I will give you my personal opinion. Gabriel was a messen-
ger, an angel of God that according to the Prophet Muḥammad
gave Him the inspiration. He is also mentioned in the Old Testa-
ment as one of the angels. Mullá Ḥusayn, the first to believe in
the Báb, felt that, now that he had received the Message of the
Báb, he was to proclaim it to the world, just like the angel
Gabriel proclaimed the Message to Muḥammad. Mullá Ḥusayn
became a vehicle for the proclamation of the Cause of God.

Q. Shoghi Effendi speaks about The Dawn-Breakers as a
book of inspiration. Why is it that the history of the earliest
believers was needed most, above all other works that could
have been translated at that time?

A. Shoghi Effendi felt that the West needed a history of the early
believers of the Heroic Age. The first part of the Heroic Age,
meaning the nine years of the Ministry of the Báb, is so full of
stories about how the early believers arose and sacrificed
themselves, gave their all and offered everything they had for the
sake of the Báb. This spirit of dedication and of self-sacrifice,
Shoghi Effendi felt, needed to be instilled in the hearts of the
friends in the West. He wanted them to be the descendants of the
Dawn-Breakers. He wanted them to carry the same spirit.

Remember that he was trying to raise the foundations of the
Administrative Order. He chose the United States to be its
Cradle. However, he did not want the community to become too
involved, at the cost of ignoring the spirit of the Faith, with the
gritty details of administration, although these are, of course,
important. Yet, he wanted them to understand the meaning of

\[104\] THE DAWN-BREAKERS

love and dedication to the Cause, the spirit of devotion and of
detachment. In order to have this spirit, he felt that the friends in
the West needed an authentic, reliable history of the early days of
the Faith, so that they knew who their spiritual ancestors were.
Mullá Ḥusayn, Quddús and Ṭáhirih are our spiritual ancestors.
Let us learn from them, follow them, and try to be like them.

Q. Quddús was endowed with special and divine powers.
Káhirih as well occupies a very high rank in the Faith. What
was the nature of their tense dispute at Badasht?

A. This whole episode in Badasht has been treated in Nabíl’s
Narrative and Shoghi Effendi had to translate what Nabíl had
written about the subject. But when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was writing A
Traveller’s Narrative, which has been translated by Browne, He
pointed out that this confrontation was pre-arranged by Bahá-
’u’lláh with Ṭáhirih and with Quddús, in order to gradually
educate the people and help them to understand the principles of
the New Day. We should not consider this incident in Badasht as
something that was a real dispute between Quddús and Ṭáhirih.

Q. Why were some of the footnotes to The Dawn-Breakers
published in French?

A. In the bibliography of works consulted by Shoghi Effendi for
his translation of The Dawn-Breakers there are several books by
French authors. If the books had been in any other language, I
think he would have translated into English the quoted passages
before including them. However, he did not feel that a translation
from French was necessary because it is a language that is
usually accepted and learned by scholars. Especially at that time,
most English-speaking scholars would have studied French too.
For those people who do not speak French, a supplementary
booklet has been published that contains an English translation
of all the French footnotes.

It is interesting to note that in all of his other writings,
including his translations, Shoghi Effendi never used footnotes.
Even God Passes By has no footnotes. The only other footnote
he ever wrote was in The Kitáb-i-Iqán. He wrote a footnote to
say that the word ‘oppression’ used in the text represented a
translation from a Greek word.

Q. Regarding what others have said about Nabíl’s Narrative,
who stated that it reinvented the literature of East and West?

That was Bahíyyíh Nakhjávání. She explains what she meant as
follows: ‘Those of you who have read this wonderful book, One
Thousand and One Nights: do you remember how this work is
constructed? You start with a story, you meet three characters, in
the middle of this story of three characters, one of the characters
says, “and by the way, something happened to me too . . .’ and
he starts telling you his story. You go from story one to story
two. The character tells you his story, and in the middle of his
story you meet a fourth, a fifth and a sixth character, somebody
who is weeping inconsolably. “What is the matter with you?”
“Ah” he says “you don’t know what was happened to me. I have
to tell you my story . . .” So suddenly you are into story number
three. It is like a Russian doll. You go from one story, to another
story inside that story and so on. This is a classic oriental
technique for story telling. It is a story that breeds another story,
which breeds another story. It is a never-ending story. And if you
think about the shape of that, it is very circular. There is one
story, and another story, and another story, and another story.
There is just no end. It does not actually have a linear form. Now
in the west, in our tradition of literature and drama, we have a
very linear concept of stories. All of these things go back to our
religious heritage. This is a fascinating subject for anyone of you
who wants to analyze how it is that religion has influenced
literature, art, drama etc. In the west, which was so much
dominated by the Judeo-Christian framework of religion, you see

\[106\] THE DAWN-BREAKERS

that so much of our arts, in terms of drama and literature, have a
linear form. They have a beginning, they reach a climax, and
they arrive at a resolution. It is exactly the story of the “creation”
of the world with Adam, in terms of Christians’ concept anyway,
the “redemption” of the world when Christ came, and the final
“resurrection” at the end of time. That is that ark shape. It is an
ark which you find reflected over and over again, from the
Greeks all the way up to the present day. It is constructed in
time. We have the sense of the before, the now and the after. We
have a sense of beginning, middle and end. What Shoghi Effendi
has done in the “Dawn Breakers”, is that he has taken this
rambling narrative of Nabíl, where he is telling a story about
someone, what he has eye witnessed, and in the middle of that
story he introduces somebody else who says: “And he told me
that when he was [in] such and such a town he had spoken to so
and so who told him another story which has happened.” Russian
doll within Russian doll. Going from one story to another story.
Who was that person? Was that Muḥammad ‘Alí, or mulláh so
and so? You just do not know who they all are. It does not really
matter. Of course some scholars have clearly set up who all these
people are, but what really matters is that you are seeing a story
evolving from one person to another. Like a seamless and
unending line and it seems too like a mushroom. It spawns. You
will start one story and before you have really finished it, you go
into another story. You have not even finished that one story
before you have to read the new one because it is so interesting.
As you read this new one, it goes to another one. But then you
want to get back to number one. It is extraordinary. He has taken
this heritage and he has done something new with it. He has
turned it into a linear story. Just take a look at the passages, the
major portions of the Dawn Breakers. He begins with the section
of the pre-Bábí period with Shaykh Aḥmad and Siyyid Kázim.
Then he goes to the declaration of the Báb. Then he goes to the
pilgrimage of the Báb to Mecca. He goes on and he goes on, and
then he reaches the climax, the tragic climax of the martyrdom of

the Báb, and then he reaches the end. There is even an epilogue.
He has created a line. He has created a tragic drama that reaches
its high point and comes to its low point. He has done something
quite remarkable, because he has married the eastern style of
narrative with the western style of literary heritage.’

Q. Shoghi Effendi in a cable said that Nabíl’s Narrative is
an indispensable preliminary to future pilgrimage to
Bahá’u’lláh’s native land. What does this mean?

A. Obviously what he means is that in the future there will
certainly be pilgrimages to the holy and historic Bahá’í sites in
Iran. For example, the House of the Báb in Shiraz, where He
declared His mission: It has been demolished but it will certainly
be rebuilt. Bahá’u’lláh made it a place of pilgrimage for the
whole Bahá’í world. There is also the Síyáh-Chál, where
Bahá’u’lláh received the intimation of His revelation, the house
where Bahá’u’lláh resided and where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was born,
the hamlet where the conference of Badasht took place, the
burial site of Badí‘, the burial place of Ṭáhirih, the house of
Vaḥíd, the house of Ḥujjat. All these places are sacred and
historical sites. In one of his statistical booklets Shoghi Effendi
has given us a list of over a whole page of names of sacred and
historic sites in Iran. Unfortunately the government confiscated
all these properties under the new regime. But since it is God’s
will that there will be pilgrimages to Iran, we can be sure that the
Bahá’í community will recover all of these sites. When the day
comes for pilgrims to go to Iran, they will have Nabíl’s Narrative
to familiarize them with what happened in each place.

Q. When the manuscript of Nabíl’s Narrative was sent to the
National Spiritual Assembly of the United States how much
time elapsed before it was first published?

\[108\] THE DAWN-BREAKERS

A. Shoghi Effendi spent a lot of time writing about how it should
be published. He was extremely explicit about what the cover
should be like, how the photographs should be displayed, in what
order the letters to the Letters of the Living should be arranged,
and so on. All these particulars were described in his letters to
the Publishing Trust of the American National Assembly. It took
some time for them to carry out his instructions. He finished
translating it in 1931, but it was not published for about ten
months, until 1932.

Q. Ten thousand people witnessed the martyrdom of the Báb.
Many reports have been written about this event, including
some that are in discordance with the one recounted in
Nabíl’s Narrative. Do the majority of these reports indicate
that Nabíl’s statements were correct? Did Shoghi Effendi
take into consideration other versions of the story when
translating it?

A. I think Shoghi Effendi read every account that was available
to him in Persian, Arabic, English and French, and, I think, if
any of these accounts were not biased and deliberately inimical,
he included them in the footnotes of Nabíl’s Narrative. What
he did not and could not include were the reports of the Iranian
government about the martyrdom, because he didn’t have access
to them. It will be left for future scholars to discover these things.
I think that, as far as the major events of the martyrdom
are concerned, we already know what happened. Bahá’u’lláh
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá have referred innumerable times to the martyr-
dom of the Báb. Shoghi Effendi has said that it was a miracle
that the Báb was not killed by the gunfire of the Armenian
regiment.

It is very interesting that the Báb seemed to have
foreknowledge of what was going to happen. He told the police
official ‘Not until I have said to him all those things that I wish
to say can any earthly power silence Me’ (GPB 52). And before

the regiment fired the first volley of bullets, the Báb said nothing
to the crowd. The second time, however, when He knew that
they were to be His last words, He said to them, ‘The day will
come when you will have recognized Me; that day I shall have
ceased to be with you’ (GPB 53).

Q. The Dawn-Breakers was originally written by Nabíl, but
was recreated by Shoghi Effendi. Does the book have the
same validity as works written by Shoghi Effendi, such as
God Passes By?

A. With regard to specific times and dates and places, it may
happen that in the future documents will be found that show that
some of these details in Nabíl’s narrative are not completely
accurate. For example, a document may be found that a certain
event, which Nabíl writes happened on a Wednesday, actually
happened on a Thursday. That would be just a technical detail.

However, I do not think that the overall flow of events is
going to change. Bahá’u’lláh warned Nabíl to adhere to the facts
that he had heard, without embellishment or reduction. That is
why Shoghi Effendi calls the book a narrative, not a history.
Nabíl narrated the stories he had collected from the believers
who lived through those years. I don’t see how these first-hand
accounts can be challenged. In the future, if authentic documents
are found, perhaps they could be added to the narrative as
footnotes. Such issues will certainly be decided by the Universal
House of Justice.

Q. What about the rest of Nabíl’s Narrative? Will it ever be
finished? Is it being worked on at this time? How can
changes be made without having access to Bahá’u’lláh’s
correction? How did Shoghi Effendi know which corrections
needed to be made if the original corrections by Bahá’u’lláh
were not available?

\[110\] THE DAWN-BREAKERS

A. When Nabíl began to make his own notes about the history of
the Faith, some of his friends, particularly the brother of
Bahá’u’lláh, Mírzá Músá, and Mírzá Aqá Ján, who was the
amanuensis of Bahá’u’lláh, asked him why he did not start
writing a full account of the history of the Faith. As I stated
earlier, he replied that he would not write anything unless
Bahá’u’lláh wished him to. They reported this to Bahá’u’lláh.
Bahá’u’lláh said that he should write, but gave him instructions
in two Tablets. The two Tablets have been published. He told
him not to overstate or understate the facts. He told him not to
elaborate on the stories he had heard, nor to whittle down the
parts of the story that he didn’t like. Nabíl produced a manuscript
and presented it to Bahá’u’lláh. Nabíl had not satisfactorily
followed His instructions, so He returned the manuscript to him
and instructed him to make some corrections. What we do not
know at this time is how the instructions about the corrections
were conveyed to Nabíl. However, Bahá’u’lláh had made it clear
that His instructions had not been followed. Nabíl had to rewrite
his narrative and present it to Bahá’u’lláh again. Bahá’u’lláh kept
this version among His papers. We assume that He accepted this
revised text.

I have already explained that after the ascension of
Bahá’u’lláh, Covenant-breakers stole papers from the room of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. They stole two cases of papers that Bahá’u’lláh
had given to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. They literally did this at a time when
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was not in His room and was washing the body of
Bahá’u’lláh. Those documents are probably still in the
possession of the descendants of the Covenant-breakers. We do
not know if we will ever recover them. Even if we did, they may
not be reliable. Muḥammad-‘Alí is known to have corrupted
texts. His brother, Badí‘u’lláh, wrote a confession that mentioned
that he had seen his brother corrupt texts. In my own personal
opinion, even if they were found, I don’t think we could trust
them. However, the final decision, as I stated, rests with the
House of Justice.

At the time when Shoghi Effendi produced Nabíl’s
Narrative, the Covenant-breakers spread a rumour among their
Arab friends that Shoghi Effendi had fabricated the entire thing
and that only they possessed Nabíl’s narrative. Apart from that
claim, as stated earlier, we also have a Tablet from ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, in which He states that the revised edition of Nabíl’s
narrative was among the documents stolen by the Covenant-
breakers.

When Shoghi Effendi set out to translate Nabíl, he had the
instructions of Bahá’u’lláh before him, and we can be sure that
he tried his best to remove anything that he felt was overstated or
based on assumption. He gave us everything that he thought was
authentic, and in conformity with the spirit of Bahá’u’lláh’s
wishes.

Q. The role of a traditional storyteller sees him or her taking
the story and reworking it in his or her own interpretation
and flavour. How do you see the storyteller’s tool of artistic
licence in the light of Bahá’u’lláh’s clear instruction to Nabíl,
to neither overstate nor understate, neither expand the
description of events nor reduce their importance? What
advice regarding artistic licence or individual artistic
interpretation would you give to a contemporary storyteller
who wished to retell stories from Bahá’í history?

A. If this Bahá’í storyteller wants to recount the events of any
part of Bahá’í history, he should not add fiction to fact. Adhering
to the facts is very important. To add a feeling or an emotion, in
the form of a question maybe, in order to bring to the attention of
the reader a certain point, is entirely acceptable. But if the writer
wants to add additional details, or to change them, then he should
not write a history. He should write a novel. If the author makes
it clear that he is writing a fictional story, then he can state
whatever he wants and can add in little details to fill any gaps he
may find.

\[112\] V
God Passes By
Background

God Passes By is, in the words of its author, ‘a survey of the
outstanding events of the century that has seen this Spirit [the
Bahá’í Faith] burst forth upon the world . . .’ (GPB xii). It was
the one book Shoghi Effendi wrote in his lifetime that was
neither directly addressed to the Bahá’ís, expounding on subjects
related to the Faith, nor a translation of an existing text in Arabic
or Persian. With characteristic precision the Guardian refrained
from referring to his ‘survey’ as a ‘detailed history’ of the first
hundred years of the Bahá’í Era. He was content to call it ‘a
review of the salient features of [the Faith’s] birth and rise, as
well as of the initial stages in the establishment of its
administrative institutions’ (GPB xiii).

In his Introduction to the work, George Townshend describes
it as ‘a history of our times written on an unfamiliar theme – a
history filled with love and happiness and vision and strength,
telling of triumphs gained and wider triumphs yet to come . . .’.
‘The theme on its human side’, he writes, ‘is that of Love and
Struggle and Death. It tells of men and women like ourselves,
adventuring all they had and all they were for sheer love’s sake,
of desolated homes, of breaking hearts, of bereavement and exile
and suffering and indomitable purpose’ (GPB iii).

The book was published in 1944 to commemorate the first
centenary of the Bahá’í Faith. To give an idea of the monumental
nature of the task Shoghi Effendi undertook in preparing his

‘survey’, one has only to consider certain basic statistics. The
work consists of 412 pages in all, including quotations from
sacred scripture, scholarly treatises and other sources. Of these,
41 pages are quotations covering an entire page or more.
Scattered throughout the rest of the book we find about 47 pages
worth of further citations, bringing the total of pages where
Shoghi Effendi is quoting other sources to over 85. Rúḥíyyih
Khánum, in The Priceless Pearl, gives us a glimpse of Shoghi
Effendi’s meticulous research and overall vision for the book:

> The method of Shoghi Effendi in writing God Passes By was
> to sit down for a year and read every book of the Bahá’í
> Writings in Persian and English, and every book written
> about the Faith by Bahá’ís, whether in manuscript form or
> published, and everything written by non-Bahá’ís that
> contained significant references to it. I think in all, this must
> have covered the equivalent of at least two hundred books.
> As he read he made notes and compiled and marshalled his
> facts. Anyone who has ever tackled a work of an historical
> nature knows how much research is involved, how often one
> has to decide, in the light of relevant material, between this
> date given in one place and that date given in another, how
> backbreaking the whole work is . . . When all the ingredients
> of his book had been assembled Shoghi Effendi commenced
> weaving them into the fabric of his picture of the significance
> of the first century of the Bahá’í Dispensation. It was not his
> purpose, he said, to write a detailed history of those hundred
> years, but rather to review the salient features of the birth and
> rise of the Faith, the establishment of its administrative
> institutions, and the series of crises which had propelled it
> forward in a mysterious manner, through the release of the
> Divine power within it, from victory to victory. He revealed
> to us the panorama of events which, he wrote, ‘the revolution
> of a hundred years . . . has unrolled before our eyes’ and
> lifted the curtain on the opening acts of what he asserted was

\[114\] GOD PASSES BY

> one ‘indivisible, stupendous and sublime drama, whose
> mystery no intellect can fathom, whose climax no eye can
> even dimly perceive, whose conclusion no mind can
> adequately foreshadow’. (PP 223)

It was the Guardian’s intention to present the Bahá’í world
with a valuable gift at the anniversary of the Declaration of the
Báb: the first comprehensive look at the events marking the
emergence of the Faith from its humble beginnings in Persia to
its status as a truly world-embracing religion. His purpose, he
insisted, was not ‘to ignore . . . the swift interweaving of seeming
reverses with evident victories, out of which the hand of an
inscrutable Providence has chosen to form the pattern of the
Faith from its earliest days . . .’ (GPB xiii), but to reveal the
process of ‘crisis and victory’ that characterized the fortunes of
the Bahá’í Faith throughout its history and which would continue
to shape its progress in the future. ‘[T]he history of the first
hundred years of [the Faith’s] evolution’, he explains in his
Foreword to the book, ‘resolves itself into a series of internal
and external crises . . . devastating in their immediate effects, but
each mysteriously releasing a corresponding measure of divine
power, lending thereby a fresh impulse to its unfoldment . . .’
(GPB xiii).

The conditions under which he laboured to produce God
Passes By reflect this very pattern of triumph and reversal. The
book was written while he was under great strain from factors
both within and without the Bahá’í world. This was a time when
the Nazi regime was carrying out the mass extermination of
Jews, Gypsies and other populations across Europe; when its
armies were engaged on both the Western and Russian fronts, as
well as in North Africa; when Japan and America had both
joined in the hostilities, turning the Second World War into a
planet-wide conflict. It was also a period of great personal loss
for Shoghi Effendi due to the activities of Covenant-breakers
within his own family.

Rúḥíyyih Khánum paints a picture of these circumstances in
The Priceless Pearl: ‘Shoghi Effendi, already crushed and
overburdened from the weight of twenty years of Guardianship,
when the tides of World War II threatened to sweep over the
Holy Land and engulf him and the World Centre of the Faith in
one catastrophic flow, during a period when his home was
convulsed by the repercussions of Covenant-breaking now
affecting his own family, set himself the task of appraising for all
time the significance of the events of the first century of the
Bahá’í Era’ (PP 224).

She further writes in her diary: ‘As Shoghi Effendi sat
working on God Passes By, two army fighter planes in practice
flight touched wings, lost control and crashed, one coming down
over the roof of our house so low I thought it would sheer
through the ceiling of Shoghi Effendi’s room. It landed and burst
into flames not 100 yards away at the foot of the street’ (PP 162).
And again, concerning the activities of Covenant-breakers in
Haifa at that time, she noted, ‘They [the Master’s family] have
gone a long way to crushing every ounce of spirit out of the
Guardian’ (PP 161). ‘On rare occasions’, she recalls, ‘it was my
misfortune . . . to see him weep as if his heart would break – so
great was his agony, so overwhelming the pressures that bore
down upon him!’ (PP 224).

The work of writing involved in such a major project was of
course itself burdensome to Shoghi Effendi. ‘How many hun-
dreds of hours’, Rúḥíyyih Khánum tells us, ‘Shoghi Effendi
spent on reading his sources and compiling his notes, how many
days and months in painstakingly writing out in long hand – and
often rewriting – the majestic procession of his chapters, how
many more wearisome days he sat at his small portable type-
writer, hammering away with a few fingers, sometimes ten hours
on end, as he typed the final copy of his work! And how many
more hours we spent late into the night, when the daily typing
was over, seated side by side at his big table in his bedroom,
each with three copies of the typescript before us, proof-reading,

\[116\] GOD PASSES BY

making corrections, putting in by hand the thousands of accents
on transliterated words which Shoghi Effendi would read aloud,
until his eyes were bloodshot and blurred, his back and arms stiff
with exhaustion, as we worked on to finish the entire chapter or
part of a chapter he had typed that day. It had to be done. There
was no possibility of working at a slower pace. He was racing
against time to present the Bahá’ís of the West with this
inimitable gift on the occasion of the one hundredth anniversary
of the inception of their Faith. In spite of the fact that he mailed
off to America the corrected manuscript in instalments, con-
ditions in the United States delayed publication and the book was
not off the press until the middle of November 1944’ (PP 223–4).

Due to the pressures in his life at the time of writing God
Passes By, the Guardian was unable to fine-tune the text to the
extent he would have desired. He made use once more of the
services of George Townshend, sending the manuscript in instal-
ments to his friend with the request that he make editorial correc-
tions and suggestions. David Hofman describes the conditions of
their collaboration: ‘It [God Passes By] was undertaken during
difficult times – the darkest days of the Second World War –
when communications were far from regular, normal help was
unobtainable and both men were under great strain’ (GT 70).

In addition to making editorial suggestions, Mr Townshend
was asked to write an Introduction to the book. Hofman
observes: ‘Having read every line of the Guardian’s monumental
work, having gloried in it, wept over it, lived with it from
February 1943 to February 1944, offered his editorial “sugges-
tions, criticisms or corrections” as he deemed necessary, he
wrote with a full heart and flowing pen’ (GT 69).

Shoghi Effendi also requested Mr Townshend’s input on the
choice of a title. It took Mr Townshend some time to come up
with an appropriate idea. After letters and two cables from the
Guardian, he finally cabled back three words: quite simply, ‘God
Passes By’. He received an immediate answer: ‘DELIGHTED
TITLE. EAGERLY AWAITING LETTER’ (GT 69).

Townshend makes the following comments on the range and
impact of Shoghi Effendi’s centenary history: ‘whatever it holds
of darkest tragedy it leaves mankind at its close not facing a grim
inhospitable future but marching out from the shadows on the
high road of an inevitable destiny towards the opened gates of
the Promised City of Eternal Peace’ (GPB iii). In an undated
letter to the Guardian he notes that ‘Hitherto our information on
the history of the Faith has been piece-meal, and uncertain on
many points. Now an even light covers it all’ (GT 72).

We are left with an enduring legacy, a vision of the first
hundred years of Bahá’í history that is both far-reaching in its
scope and concise in its execution. Rúḥíyyih Khánum further
describes it as ‘the most brilliant and wondrous tale of a century
that has ever been told’, and ‘a “Mother” of future histories’ (PP
222). ‘A book like God Passes By’, she observes, ‘is a veritable
essence of essences; from this single hundred-year history, fifty
books could easily be written and none of them would be
superficial or lacking in material, so rich is the source provided
by the Guardian, so condensed his treatment of it’ (PP 196).

Summary

Shoghi Effendi divided the book into four periods, focusing the
first three respectively on the Ministries of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The fourth section deals with the start of the
Formative Age. He then added a short epilogue, entitled
‘Retrospect and Prospect’, in which he gives an overview of the
main highlights of the first century of Bahá’í history. Each
section is summarized separately below.

1\. The Ministry of the Báb

In his treatment of the Báb’s Ministry, Shoghi Effendi describes
the impact of that short and dramatic period on the lives of those
professing the Bábí Faith and on the public consciousness and

\[118\] GOD PASSES BY

political climate of Persia. He outlines the chief events between
the Declaration of the Báb in 1844 and His martyrdom in 1850,
and the resulting aftermath that led to Bahá’u’lláh’s incarceration
in the Síyáh-Chál. He summarizes the chief episodes related to
the lives of outstanding Bábí disciples, extols their heroism and
character, and places their achievements in the context of the
relentless opposition and bloody persecution visited on them by
the civil and ecclesiastical authorities of the nation.

He begins with an account of the Declaration of the Báb and
the enrolment of the Letters of the Living, the Báb’s arrest after
His pilgrimage to Mecca, and His subsequent imprisonment. He
describes the conference of Badasht and the intervention of
Bahá’u’lláh in that famous gathering. He then addresses the all-
important subject of the Báb’s Writings during His captivity in
Azerbaijan, including the composition of the Bayán, the reve-
lation of the laws and ordinances of the Bábí Dispensation, and
the references to ‘Him Whom God shall make manifest’. He
explains the opposition of the clergy to the new ideas promoted
by the Báb, their denunciation of His teachings and the resulting
martyrdoms in Mázindarán, Nayríz and Tehran.

He goes on to depict the events surrounding the execution of
the Báb, the parallels between His life and that of Jesus Christ,
and the tributes paid to His memory by writers in the West. He
portrays the circumstances attending the attack on Náṣiri’d-Dín
Sháh and the wave of imprisonment, torture and massacre that
was visited on the Bábí community as a result of that misguided
act. Lastly, he notes the role played by Bahá’u’lláh during the
Báb’s Ministry, and gives an account of the arrests and martyr-
doms of the remaining prominent disciples of the Báb, as well as
the eventual fate of the principal enemies of the Bábí Faith.

In order to capture some of Shoghi Effendi’s insights on this
vital period, some extracts follow:

> In sheer dramatic power, in the rapidity with which events of
momentous importance succeeded each other, in the

> holocaust which baptized its birth, in the miraculous
> circumstances attending the martyrdom of the One Who had
> ushered it in, in the potentialities with which it had been from
> the outset so thoroughly impregnated, in the forces to which
> it eventually gave birth, this nine-year period [the Ministry of
> the Báb] may well rank as unique in the whole range of
> man’s religious experience. (GPB 3)

> The heroes whose deeds shine upon the record of this fierce
> spiritual contest, involving at once people, clergy, monarch
> and government, were the Báb’s chosen disciples, the Letters
> of the Living, and their companions, the trail-breakers of the
> New Day, who to so much intrigue, ignorance, depravity,
> cruelty, superstition and cowardice opposed a spirit exalted,
> unquenchable and awe-inspiring, a knowledge surprisingly
> profound, an eloquence sweeping in its force, a piety un-
> excelled in fervor, a courage leonine in its fierceness, a self-
> abnegation saintly in its purity, a resolve granite-like in its
> firmness, a vision stupendous in its range, a veneration for
> the Prophet [Muḥammad] and His Imáms disconcerting to
> their adversaries, a power of persuasion alarming to their
> antagonists, a standard of faith and a code of conduct that
> challenged and revolutionized the lives of their countrymen.

(GPB 4–5)

2\. The Ministry of Bahá’u’lláh

In his overview of Bahá’u’lláh’s Ministry, Shoghi Effendi
focuses on the principal events marking the years of exile and
imprisonment that characterized the last half of Bahá’u’lláh’s
life, years that saw the open and far-reaching Declaration of His
Mission and the establishment of His Faith outside Persia. He
explores the influence and impact of Bahá’u’lláh’s behaviour and
Writings on the minds and hearts of those around Him, from the
body of His followers to the government officials and eminent

\[120\] GOD PASSES BY

intellectuals of His time. He addresses the nature and import of
the different Tablets comprising the vast body of Revealed Text
authored by the Founder of the Bahá’í Faith and draws particular
attention to the prophecies and religious traditions of the past that
found their final consummation in the appearance of Bahá’u’lláh.

He begins by depicting the events following the martyrdom
of the Báb, and the confusion and despair that assailed the
remaining adherents of the Bábí Faith. He recounts the first
intimations of Bahá’u’lláh’s Mission in the Síyáh-Chál, His exile
to Baghdád, and the transformative influence of His presence on
the people of that city, both within and without the Bábí
community. He explains the machinations of Bahá’u’lláh’s
enemies within the ranks of the clergy and the resulting edict
from the Sultan ordering His continued banishment, and gives an
account of the declaration of Bahá’u’lláh’s Mission on the eve of
His departure from Baghdád.

He further describes Bahá’u’lláh’s exile to Constantinople
and Adrianople, enumerating the Tablets to the Kings and Rulers
of the world which Bahá’u’lláh revealed during His stay in those
cities. He relates the attempts on the life of Bahá’u’lláh at the
instigation of His half-brother, Mírzá Yaḥyá, the consternation
and division this open antagonism produced in the Bahá’í
community, and the use that the enemies of the new-born Faith
made of this internal division to convince the Sultan to issue a
further edict banishing Bahá’u’lláh to ‘Akká. He gives a
description of Bahá’u’lláh’s incarceration in ‘the Most Great
Prison’, the gradual relaxation of the restrictions imposed upon
Him in succeeding years, and His final sojourn in the Mansion of
Bahjí. He summarizes the astounding volume of His Writings
during those last years, including the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the
Tablets which ‘supplemented’ the Most Holy Book, and explains
the range and import of these Writings. He describes the events
leading to His ascension, and finishes by chronicling instances of
‘divine judgement’ visited on the enemies of the Faith during
Bahá’u’lláh’s Ministry.

The following are extracts from this section:

> [T]he Revelation identified with Bahá’u’lláh abrogates
> unconditionally all the Dispensations gone before it, upholds
> uncompromisingly the eternal verities they enshrine,
> recognizes firmly and absolutely the Divine origin of their
> Authors, preserves inviolate the sanctity of their authentic
> Scriptures, disclaims any intention of lowering the status of
> their Founders or of abating the spiritual ideals they
> inculcate, clarifies and correlates their functions, reaffirms
> their common, their unchangeable and fundamental purpose,
> reconciles their seemingly divergent claims and doctrines,
> readily and gratefully recognizes their respective
> contributions to the gradual unfoldment of one Divine
> Revelation, unhesitatingly acknowledges itself to be but one
> link in the chain of continually progressive Revelations,
> supplements their teachings with such laws and ordinances
> as conform to the imperative needs, and are dictated by the
> growing receptivity, of a fast evolving and constantly
> changing society, and proclaims its readiness and ability to
> fuse and incorporate the contending sects and factions into
> which they have fallen into a universal Fellowship,
> functioning within the framework, and in accordance with
> the precepts, of a divinely conceived, a world-unifying, a
> world-redeeming Order. (GPB 100)

> The writings of Bahá’u’lláh during this [the ‘Akká] period,
> as we survey the vast field which they embrace, seem to
> fall into three distinct categories. The first comprises
> those writings which constitute the sequel to the proc-
> lamation of His Mission in Adrianople. The second
> includes the laws and ordinances of His Dispensation, which,
> for the most part, have been recorded in the Kitáb-i-
> Aqdas, His Most Holy Book. To the third must be assigned
> those Tablets which partly enunciate and partly reaffirm

\[122\] GOD PASSES BY

> the fundamental tenets and principles underlying that
> Dispensation. (GPB 205–6)

> With the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh draws to a close a period
> which, in many ways, is unparalleled in the world’s religious
> history. The first century of the Bahá’í Era had by now run
> half its course. An epoch, unsurpassed in its sublimity, its
> fecundity and duration by any previous Dispensation, and
> characterized, except for a short interval of three years, by
> half a century of continuous and progressive Revelation, had
> terminated. The Message proclaimed by the Báb had yielded
> its golden fruit . . . God’s newborn Faith, the cynosure of all
> past Dispensations, had been fully and unreservedly proc-
> laimed. The prophecies announcing its advent had been
> remarkably fulfilled. Its fundamental laws and cardinal
> principles, the warp and woof of the fabric of its future
> World Order, had been clearly enunciated . . . The Covenant
> designed to safeguard the unity and integrity of its world-
> embracing system had been irrevocably bequeathed to
> posterity. The promise of the unification of the whole human
> race, of the inauguration of the Most Great Peace, of the
> unfoldment of a world civilization, had been incontestably
> given . . . (GPB 223–4)

3\. The Ministry of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

In his outline of the Ministry of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi
deals with His function as Centre of Covenant and Head of the
Faith, the distinguishing features of His career, and the
revitalizing effect of His unerring guidance on the fortunes of the
Bahá’í community. He describes ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s character and
accomplishments, the arrival in the Holy Land of the first
pilgrims from the West, and the establishment of rudimentary
institutions of the Faith in various countries, under His tutelage.
He singles out two of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s seminal works, His Will

and Testament and the Tablets of the Divine Plan, for specific
mention. Finally, he relates numerous episodes recorded from the
life of the Master that exemplify the astounding influence He had
on those who met Him.

He first explains the significance of Bahá’u’lláh’s Book of
the Covenant, lists its salient features, and recapitulates the role
played by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá during the Ministry of His Father. He
gives an account of the defection of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s half-brother,
Muḥammad-‘Alí, and describes the shameful conduct of the
Covenant-breakers within His own family, machinations which
culminated in the summoning of two Commissions of Inquiry
into ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s activities by the Ottoman government. He
alludes to the impending judgement on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá based on
the report of the second Commission, His release from incarcer-
ation after the Young Turk revolution, and the final transference
of the remains of the Báb to a mausoleum specifically erected,
under His direction, on the slopes of Mount Carmel.

He further describes the early development of the Faith in the
West, depicting ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s travels to Europe and America.
He underlines the importance of these journeys, the impact that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence and Person had on His audiences, and
the ensuing advancement of the Faith in those countries. He
notes the continued persecution of the Bahá’í community in
Persia, describes the construction of the first Bahá’í House of
Worship in ‘Ishqábád and points out the effect of the First World
War on the conduct of administrative affairs in the Holy Land.
He mentions the recognition of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s services by the
British government after the war. Lastly, he recounts the passing
of the Master, reiterates the significance of His Ministry, and
relates the fate of His few surviving opponents.

Some extracts are given below:

> To direct and canalize these forces let loose by this Heaven-
> sent process, and to insure their harmonious and continuous
> operation after His ascension, an instrument divinely

\[124\] GOD PASSES BY

ordained, invested with indisputable authority, organically
linked with the Author of the Revelation Himself, was clearly
indispensable. That instrument Bahá’u’lláh had expressly
provided through the institution of the Covenant, an
institution which He had firmly established prior to His
ascension. (GPB 237–8)

During these travels [to Europe and America] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
displayed a vitality, a courage, a single-mindedness, a
consecration to the task He had set Himself to achieve that
excited the wonder and admiration of those who had the
privilege of observing at close hand His daily acts . . .
[C]areless alike of His comfort and His health; expending
every ounce of His energy day after day from dawn till late at
night; consistently refusing any gifts or contributions
towards the expenses of His travels; unfailing in His
solicitude for the sick, the sorrowful and the down-trodden;
uncompromising in His championship of the underprivileged
races and classes; bountiful as the rain in His generosity to
the poor; contemptuous of the attacks launched against Him
by vigilant and fanatical exponents of orthodoxy and
sectarianism; . . . unequivocal in His glorification of
Bahá’u’lláh at all times and within the sanctuaries of divers
sects and denominations; adamant in His refusal, on several
occasions, to curry the favor of people of title and wealth
both in England and in the United States; and last but not
least incomparable in the spontaneity, the genuineness and
warmth of His sympathy and loving-kindness shown to friend
and stranger alike, believer and unbeliever, rich and poor,
high and low, whom He met . . . He, the incarnation of every
Bahá’í virtue and the embodiment of every Bahá’í ideal,
continued . . . to trumpet to a world sunk in materialism and
already in the shadow of war, the healing, the God-given
truths enshrined in His Father’s Revelation. (GPB 282–3)

4\. The Inception of the Formative Age

In his survey of the period immediately following the Ascension
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi addresses the essential
elements of the Bahá’í Administrative Order, details its
uniqueness in the annals of religious history, and examines its
lawful basis in the Will and Testament of Abdu’l-Bahá. He
characterizes the Formative Age as a period of gradual develop-
ment, when the Faith and its institutions, through a process of
organic growth and alternate stages of crisis and victory, will lay
the foundations for the appearance of Bahá’u’lláh’s Golden Age.
He enumerates the achievements of individuals and communities
in the fields of teaching and administration, applauds the forma-
tion of Assemblies on a sound constitutional and legal basis, and
underlines the importance of the official recognition of the Faith.

He begins with an explanation of the nature of the
Administrative Order based on the provisions of the Will and
Testament of Abdu’l-Bahá. He then describes the attacks by
Covenant-breakers on that newly established Order after the
passing of Abdu’l-Bahá, and their inability to halt the steady
march of development of the institutions of the Faith. He
mentions the inauguration of the Mother Temple of the West,
listing endowments, publishing houses, summer schools and
other agencies associated with the nascent Bahá’í institutions. He
recalls the persecutions suffered by Bahá’í communities in
Russia, Germany and Persia, emphasizes the significance of an
edict issued by ecclesiastical authorities in Egypt formally
pronouncing the Faith an independent religion, and praises the
official recognition of Bahá’í institutions in the United States.

He further catalogues the accomplishments of individuals
and national communities in the field of teaching, making
particular reference to the services of Martha Root, and notes the
particular contribution of the American Bahá’ís to the spread of
the Faith across the world, executing the mandate of Abdu’l-
Bahá in His Tablets of the Divine Plan.

\[126\] GOD PASSES BY

Some extracts from this section are as follows:

The Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh had been instituted solely
through the direct operation of His Will and purpose. The
Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, on the other hand, may
be regarded as the offspring resulting from that mystic
intercourse between Him Who had generated the forces of a
God-given Faith and the One Who had been made its sole
Interpreter and was recognized as its perfect Exemplar. The
creative energies unleashed by the Originator of the Law of
God in this age gave birth, through their impact upon the
mind of Him Who had been chosen as its unerring
Expounder, to that Instrument, the vast implications of which
the present generation, even after the lapse of twenty-three
years, is still incapable of fully apprehending. (GPB 325)

The Administrative Order which this historic Document has
established, it should be noted, is, by virtue of its origin and
character, unique in the annals of the world’s religious
systems. No Prophet before Bahá’u’lláh, it can be confidently
asserted, not even MuJammad Whose Book clearly lays
down the laws and ordinances of the Islamic Dispensation,
has established, authoritatively and in writing, anything
comparable to the Administrative Order which the author-
ized Interpreter of Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings has instituted, an
Order which, by virtue of the administrative principles which
its Author has formulated, the institutions He has established,
and the right of interpretation with which He has invested its
Guardian, must and will, in a manner unparalleled in any
previous religion, safeguard from schism the Faith from
which it has sprung. Nor is the principle governing its
operation similar to that which underlies any system . . .
which the minds of men have devised for the government of
human institutions. Neither in theory nor in practice can the
Administrative Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh be said to

> conform to any type of democratic government, to any system
> of autocracy, to any purely aristocratic order, or to any of
> the various theocracies . . . which mankind has witnessed in
> the past. It incorporates within its structure certain elements
> which are to be found in each of the three recognized forms
> of secular government, is devoid of the defects which each of
> them inherently possesses, and blends the salutary truths
> which each undoubtedly contains without vitiating in any
> way the integrity of the Divine verities on which it is
> essentially founded. (GPB 326)

5\. Retrospect and Prospect

In his epilogue Shoghi Effendi reviews the major episodes
marking the history of the Faith in the hundred years since its
inception, and looks forward to aspects of its future develop-
ment. He characterizes the advancement of the Bahá’í Faith as ‘A
process, God-impelled, . . . mysterious in its workings, awful in
the retribution meted out to every one seeking to resist its opera-
tion, infinitely rich in its promise for the regeneration and re-
demption of human kind . . .’ (GPB 402). He notes that ‘Despite
the blows levelled’ at it, whether by ‘the wielders of temporal
and spiritual authority from without, or by black-hearted foes
from within’, the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh has gone from strength to
strength during the course of its first hundred years, and always
emerged whole and victorious from any crisis that assailed it.
‘Indeed its history’, he writes, ‘. . . resolve[s] itself into a series
of pulsations, of alternating crises and triumphs, leading it ever
nearer to its divinely appointed destiny’ (GPB 409).

Shoghi Effendi’s overarching understanding of the Faith’s
history and his far-reaching vision of its future may be glimpsed
in the few quotes provided below:

> The tribulations attending the progressive unfoldment of the
> Faith of Bahá’u’lláh have indeed been such as to exceed in

\[128\] GOD PASSES BY

gravity those from which the religions of the past have
suffered. Unlike those religions, however, these tribulations
have failed utterly to impair its unity, or to create, even temp-
orarily, a breach in the ranks of its adherents. It has not only
survived these ordeals, but has emerged, purified and inviol-
ate, endowed with greater capacity to face and surmount any
crisis which its resistless march may engender in the future.

Mighty indeed have been the tasks accomplished and the
victories achieved by this sorely-tried yet undefeatable Faith
within the space of a century! Its unfinished tasks, its future
victories, as it stands on the threshold of the second Bahá’í
century, are greater still. (GPB 410)

Whatever may befall this infant Faith of God in future
decades or in succeeding centuries, whatever the sorrows,
dangers and tribulations which the next stage in its world-
wide development may engender, from whatever quarter the
assaults to be launched by its present or future adversaries
may be unleashed against it, however great the reverses and
setbacks it may suffer, we, who have been privileged to
apprehend, to the degree our finite minds can fathom, the
significance of these marvelous phenomena associated with
its rise and establishment, can harbor no doubt that what it
has already achieved in the first hundred years of its life
provides sufficient guarantee that it will continue to forge
ahead, capturing loftier heights, tearing down every obstacle,
opening up new horizons and winning still mightier victories
until its glorious mission, stretching into the dim ranges of
time that lie ahead, is totally fulfilled. (GPB 412)

Q. ‘Neither in theory nor in practice can the Administrative
Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh be said to conform to any
type of democratic government, to any system of autocracy, to
any purely aristocratic order, or to any of the various
theocracies, whether Jewish, Christian or Islamic which
mankind has witnessed in the past’ (GPB 326). What does he
mean by ‘neither in theory nor in practice’?

A. Autocracy means rule by one; aristocracy means rule by a
group, a selected group; and democracy means rule by all the
people. Aristotle divided systems of government into these three
forms.

Shoghi Effendi says that the Administrative Order combines
certain wholesome, healthy and useful elements from each of
these three types of government. There is an autocratic element
in the Faith, which is the power of the Manifestation of God and
of the Interpreters of the Word of God. The democratic aspect is
that the reins of authority are held by elected bodies. In a modern
democracy, the government sometimes has to resort to a refer-
endum to allow it to make certain decisions. The electorate has
power over the government. The aristocratic element is that the
elected bodies are not responsible to the electorate. They are
responsible to their own consciences. They should feel they are
responsible to God because they believe in life after death.
Ultimately, they are the deputies of God, not of the people.

In his ‘Dispensation’ Shoghi Effendi has stated that the
Bahá’í Administrative Order has an ‘inclination to democratic
methods in the administration of its affairs’ (WOB 154). The
democratic element is very clearly that the people are free to
elect whomever they want. The elections for the Local and
National Assemblies are held annually. Those who are electing
can elect the same people each year or different people. They
have that choice; the voice of the majority prevails.

\[130\] GOD PASSES BY

The Administrative Order is not a pure democracy, nor a
pure aristocracy, nor a pure autocracy. It is a combination of
these three things together. Finally, there are additional Bahá’í
spiritual principles: the methods of election, voting and
consultation. These things make the Administrative Order an
entirely new creation, unlike anything else in the past. These are
not only theoretical principles, but the principles are practised.
And the Universal House of Justice is the ultimate safeguard, our
guarantee that it is ‘the last refuge of a tottering civilization’
(WOB 89).

Q. What were the commissions of inquiry into ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s activity and what did they find out?

A. There were two commissions of investigation or of inquiry.
The first one came in about 1901, and the second about 1907.
The first part of the Will was written at about the time when the
first commission was in ‘Akká, and the second part of the Will
was written at about the time the second commission was there.
These reports were all, unfortunately, against Abdu’l-Bahá. The
members of the commission came from Constantinople, at the
bidding of Sultan ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd. The members of the com-
missions were antagonistic towards ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. They were
influenced by the Covenant-breakers, who invited them to their
homes and gave them gifts, possibly bribed them, and tried to
instil in them hatred for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself
stayed away from the commission members. He did the exact
opposite to the Covenant-breakers. The Covenant-breakers found
some local people in ‘Akká, and induced them to go before the
commission and to give testimony against Abdu’l-Bahá. These
negative reports went to Constantinople. The result of the first
commission was that the incarceration of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was
renewed. Once again He had to be confined within the prison
walls of the city of ‘Akká.

The second commission was even worse. There was the
possibility that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would be either sentenced to death
or exiled to Libya. The Ottomans used to send prisoners to
Fezzan, near Tripoli in North Africa. The second report was even
more negative than the first, and it would have been very
dangerous if that report had reached Constantinople, but it never
did. The Young Turks arose against Sultan ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd, and
he was deposed from the throne.

Q. ‘Nor were the British authorities slow to express their
appreciation of the rôle which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had played in
allaying the burden of suffering that had oppressed the
inhabitants of the Holy Land during the dark days of that
distressing conflict’ (GPB 306). What did ‘Abdu’l-Bahá do
for the British?

A. There was not enough food for the British army during the
war against the Turkish forces in the Holy Land. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
had food in His storehouses, which He gave to the poor in ‘Akká.
He also gave them some of this wheat to feed the British army
after they gained control of the Holy Land. For these services the
British government considered that He should be granted a
knighthood.

Q. Shoghi Effendi has described the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh
during the ‘Akká period as follows: ‘The writings of
Bahá’u’lláh during this period, as we survey the vast field
which they embrace, seem to fall into three distinct categories.
The first comprises those writings which constitute the sequel
to the proclamation of His Mission in Adrianople’ (GPB 205).
What are the Tablets which constitute this sequel?

A. The delivery of the Message of Bahá’u’lláh came in three
stages. The first stage began in the Siyáh-Chál of Tehran, when
He received the first intimations of His message. Stage two was

\[132\] GOD PASSES BY

the Declaration, and it occurred 10 years later, in the Najíbíyyih
garden outside Baghdád. It was there that Bahá’u’lláh lifted the
veils surrounding His station. His companions on that occasion
were the Bábís of Baghdád, and He clearly announced to them
that He was the Promised One of the Bayán. The third stage was
the Proclamation of His Mission. This Proclamation was initiated
in Constantinople. He had moved there from Baghdád at the
bidding of Sultan ‘Abdu’l-Azíz. After four months, the Sultan
issued an edict banishing Bahá’u’lláh and His companions to
Adrianople. Bahá’u’lláh responded to this by sending a
condemnatory Tablet. The Proclamation process evolved in
Adrianople. It emerged into the open with His Súriy-i-Mulúk
(Tablet to the Kings). It continued with His Tablets to individual
kings, rulers and religious leaders. The Proclamation to the
individual rulers started in 1867 in Adrianople and continued
until 1873, in ‘Akká. Bahá’u’lláh was banished to ‘Akká in
1868\. The Proclamation could be said to have ended there with
the revelation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.

VI
Outline of works published in English
A. Bahá’í Administration

Bahá’í Administration is the first compilation of Shoghi
Effendi’s English letters. It was first published in 1928, and after
two subsequent revisions, when additions were made to the text,
it was published in its current form in 1941. The first letter in this
volume is dated January 1922, and the last is dated July 1932,
thus a period of a little over 10 years is covered by the book.

In the 1922 letter to the friends in the United States men-
tioned above, Shoghi Effendi expresses his sorrow and the grief
of the Holy household at the passing of the Beloved Master,
describing it as a ‘shock . . . too terrible and sudden for us all to
recover from in so short a time’ (BA 15). After quoting several
passages from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá about the future
glory of the Cause, and drawing the attention of the friends to the
importance of the teaching work and unity in the community, he
specifically underlines the fact that, in accordance with ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s anticipation, ‘tests intellectual rather than physical’ were
ahead of them, and that these tests were designed to purify them
and to make them shine brighter than ever before (BA 16).

After the book was published in its last edition Shoghi
Effendi, in a letter written to a National Assembly on his behalf,
made the following comment about its importance:

> The Guardian would strongly urge each and every member
> of the National Spiritual Assembly to carefully peruse, and to

> quietly ponder upon the outer meaning and upon the inner
> spirit as well, of all his communications on the subject of the
> origin, nature and present-day functioning of the
> administrative order of the Faith. A compilation of these
> letters has been lately published in the States under the title
> ‘Bahá’í Administration’, and a complete knowledge of that
> book seems to be quite essential to the right handling of the
> administrative problems facing your National Spiritual
> Assembly at present . . . (CC Vol. I, 220–1)

In this book the duties of a National Assembly, the
responsibilities of a National Convention, and of Local Spiritual
Assemblies are outlined. The requirements of Bahá’í elections,
and the nature of Bahá’í consultation are explained. Shoghi
Effendi stresses over and over again the importance of engaging
in the teaching work, which should be the dominating passion of
every devoted believer, and underlines the implications of faith
in the Manifestation of God. He gives full details of the
persecution of the Bahá’ís in Iran and in Russia, and explains the
legal problems surrounding the ownership of Bahá’u’lláh’s
House in Baghdád. Other issues, such as the importance of
acquiring properties adjoining the Shrine of the Báb on Mount
Carmel, the need to adhere to a common system of trans-
literation, the importance of newsletters, of loyalty to govern-
ment, of contributions to the Fund, of summer schools, of Queen
Marie’s public announcements, and of the Mashriqu’l-Adhkár
and its dependencies are also covered.

The last letter in this compilation is his tribute to the Greatest
Holy Leaf, and expresses the extent to which her passing was a
loss. He wrote:

> Which of the blessings am I to recount, which in her unfailing
> solicitude she showered upon me, in the most critical and
> agitated hours of my life? To me, standing in so dire a need
> of the vitalizing grace of God, she was the living symbol of

\[136\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

> many an attribute I had learned to admire in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
> She was to me a continual reminder of His inspiring
> personality, of His calm resignation, of His munificence and
> magnanimity. To me she was an incarnation of His winsome
> graciousness, of His all-encompassing tenderness and love.

(BA 194)

Below are some further quotations from this valuable
compilation:

> Humanity, through suffering and turmoil, is swiftly moving
> on towards its destiny; if we be loiterers, if we fail to play our
> part surely others will be called upon to take up our task as
ministers to the crying needs of this afflicted world.

Not by the force of numbers, not by the mere exposition of
> a set of new and noble principles, not by an organized
> campaign of teaching – no matter how worldwide and
> elaborate in its character – not even by the staunchness of
> our faith or the exaltation of our enthusiasm, can we
> ultimately hope to vindicate in the eyes of a critical and
> sceptical age the supreme claim of the Abhá Revelation. One
> thing and only one thing will unfailingly and alone secure the
> undoubted triumph of this sacred Cause, namely, the extent
> to which our own inner life and private character mirror
> forth in their manifold aspects the splendor of those eternal
> principles proclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh. (BA 66)

> But let us all remember, in this connection, that prior to
> every conceivable measure destined to raise the efficiency of
> our administrative activities, more vital than any scheme
> which the most resourceful amongst us can devise, far above
> the most elaborate structure which the concerted efforts of
> organized Assemblies can hope to raise, is the realization
> down in the innermost heart of every true believer of the
regenerating power, the supreme necessity, the unfailing

> efficacy of the Message he bears. I assure you, dear friends,
> that nothing short of such an immovable conviction could
> have in days past enabled our beloved Cause to weather the
> blackest storms in its history. Naught else can today vitalize
> the manifold activities in which unnumbered disciples of the
> Faith are engaged; naught else can provide that driving
> force and sustaining power that are both so essential to the
> success of vast and enduring achievements. It is this spirit
> that above all else we should sedulously guard, and strive
> with all our might to fortify and exemplify in all our
> undertakings. (BA 111–12)

> Not by merely imitating the excesses and laxity of the extra-
> vagant age they live in; not by the idle neglect of the sacred
> responsibilities it is their privilege to shoulder; not by the
> silent compromise of the principles dearly cherished by
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; not by their fear of unpopularity or their
> dread of censure can they hope to rouse society from its
> spiritual lethargy, and serve as a model to a civilization the
> foundations of which the corrosion of prejudice has well-nigh
> undermined. By the sublimity of their principles, the warmth
> of their love, the spotless purity of their character, and the
> depth of their devoutness and piety, let them demonstrate to
> their fellow-countrymen the ennobling reality of a power that
> shall weld a disrupted world. (BA 131–2)

B. and C. ‘The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh’

During the year that saw the start of the Great Depression, two
very important letters, dated 27 February 1929 and 21 March
1930, treating similar themes, streamed from the pen of the
beloved Guardian. Shoghi Effendi felt it was time to explain to
the Bahá’ís of the West the sources and broad outlines of the
World Order of Bahá’u’lláh. He drew the attention of the friends
to the close relationship existing between the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and

\[138\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. These two documents,
authored respectively by the Founder of the Faith and the Centre
of its Covenant, in Shoghi Effendi’s estimation, constitute ‘the
chief depository wherein are enshrined those priceless elements
of that Divine Civilization, the establishment of which is the
primary mission of the Bahá’í Faith’ (WOB 3–4). He stated that
these two seminal works have the same purpose and adopt iden-
tical methods in the provisions related to successorship. They are
complementary, mutually confirm one another, and are ‘insepar-
able parts of one complete unit’ (WOB 4). Shoghi Effendi
clearly states that the Will and Testament ‘confirms, supple-
ments, and correlates the provisions of the Aqdas’ (WOB 19).

It is in the implications of the Bahá’í Covenant, its distinction
in having been incorporated into a written document, the explicit
character of its stipulations, and the binding effect of its terms,
that the Bahá’í Faith differs radically from all past religions. This
aspect of the Bahá’í Revelation ensures that there is always a
central authority ‘to apply the principles, promulgate the laws,
protect the institutions, adapt loyally and intelligently the Faith
to the requirements of progressive society, and consummate the
incorruptible inheritance which the Founders of the Faith have
bequeathed to the world’ (WOB 20). Thus the system revealed
by Bahá’u’lláh, Shoghi Effendi asserts, provides both ‘immut-
ability’ and ‘elasticity’. ‘The first preserves the identity of His
Faith, and guards the integrity of His law. The second enables it,
even as a living organism, to expand and adapt itself to the needs
and requirements of an ever-changing society’ (WOB 23).

Human society has embarked on a process of an ever-
advancing civilization. Every Revelation brings about a new
phase in the transformation ‘in the ways, thoughts and manners’
of humanity. In support of this theme, Shoghi Effendi quotes the
following words from the Kitáb-i-Íqán:

> Is not the object of every Revelation to effect a
transformation in the whole character of mankind, a

> transformation that shall manifest itself, both outwardly and
> inwardly, that shall affect both its inner life and external
> conditions? For if the character of mankind be not changed,
> the futility of God’s universal Manifestation would be
> apparent. (WOB 25)

A few passages are quoted below to give us further glimpses
of these two important letters of the Guardian:

> Bahá’u’lláh, we should readily recognize, has not only
> imbued mankind with a new and regenerating Spirit. He has
> not merely enunciated certain universal principles, or
> propounded a particular philosophy, however potent, sound
> and universal these may be. In addition to these He, as well
> as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá after Him, has, unlike the Dispensations of
> the past, clearly and specifically laid down a set of Laws,
> established definite institutions, and provided for the
> essentials of a Divine Economy. These are destined to be a
> pattern for future society, a supreme instrument for the
> establishment of the Most Great Peace, and the one agency
> for the unification of the world, and the proclamation of the
> reign of righteousness and justice upon the earth. (WOB 19)

> Leaders of religion, exponents of political theories, gover-
> nors of human institutions, who at present are witnessing
> with perplexity and dismay the bankruptcy of their ideas, and
> the disintegration of their handiwork, would do well to turn
> their gaze to the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, and to medi-
> tate upon the World Order which, lying enshrined in His
> teachings, is slowly and imperceptibly rising amid the welter
> and chaos of present-day civilization. They need have no
> doubt or anxiety regarding the nature, the origin or validity
> of the institutions which the adherents of the Faith are
> building up throughout the world. For these lie embedded in
> the teachings themselves, unadulterated and unobscured by

\[140\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

> unwarrantable inferences, or unauthorized interpretations of
His Word.

How pressing and sacred the responsibility that now
> weighs upon those who are already acquainted with these
> teachings! How glorious the task of those who are called
> upon to vindicate their truth, and demonstrate their
> practicability to an unbelieving world! Nothing short of an
> immovable conviction in their divine origin, and their
> uniqueness in the annals of religion; nothing short of an
> unwavering purpose to execute and apply them to the
> administrative machinery of the Cause, can be sufficient to
> establish their reality, and insure their success. How vast is
> the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh! How great the magnitude of
> His blessings showered upon humanity in this day! And yet,
> how poor, how inadequate our conception of their
> significance and glory! This generation stands too close to so
> colossal a Revelation to appreciate, in their full measure, the
> infinite possibilities of His Faith, the unprecedented
> character of His Cause, and the mysterious dispensations of
> His Providence. (WOB 24)

D. ‘The Goal of a New World Order’

‘The Goal of a New World Order’ was written in late 1931, on
the occasion of the tenth anniversary of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s passing,
and addressed to the Bahá’í community as a whole. In this letter
Shoghi Effendi explains that as the moral decline of humanity
had been so acute, no amount of diplomacy or statesmanship,
economic rejuvenation or mutual tolerance could form a
sustainable basis for its renewal. ‘Not even’, he states, ‘would the
very act of devising the machinery required for the political and
economic unification of the world . . . provide in itself the
antidote against the poison that is steadily undermining the vigor
of organized peoples and nations’ (WOB 34). The Guardian
reminds the Bahá’ís that it is only through worldwide and

unqualified acceptance of Bahá’u’lláh’s message that humanity
can hope to reverse this crippling, though inevitable, process of
‘internal disintegration’ (WOB 34).

Shoghi Effendi emphasizes that the ailing economies, social
degradation and political fallout of the post-war era were not, in
and of themselves, the fundamental cause of humanity’s
depraved state, but were simply a consequence of ‘the failure of
those in whose hands the immediate destinies of peoples and
nations have been committed, to adjust their system of economic
and political institutions to the imperative needs of a rapidly
evolving age’ (WOB 36). Economic and social upheaval,
escalating political tension and an overriding sense of misery on
a global scale were, rather, attributable to the inability, or indeed
the unwillingness, of world leaders to ‘reshape the machinery of
their respective governments according to those standards that
are implicit in Bahá’u’lláh’s supreme declaration of the Oneness
of Mankind’ (WOB 36).

The Guardian includes in his letter a series of extracts
from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that dem-
onstrate how imperative it is for humanity to curtail absolute
state sovereignty and replace it with an international executive,
legislature and judiciary. He explains how this form of ‘world
Super-State’, which would transmute ‘the fury of a capricious
and militant nationalism . . . into an abiding consciousness of
world citizenship’ (WOB 40–1), should be a counterpart to the
seemingly contradictory principle of ‘unity in diversity’. In
conveying this concept, Shoghi Effendi stresses that the imple-
mentation of world governance should not in any way homo-
genise existing domestic traditions and institutions or suppress
national history and ethnic heritage. The principle of unity in
diversity, he states, ‘repudiates excessive centralization on one
hand and disclaims all attempts at uniformity on the other’
(WOB 42).

Shoghi Effendi also clarifies that the Oneness of Mankind, as
the central tenet of the Bahá’í Faith, should not be confused with

\[142\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

a superficial or sanctimonious appeal for a ‘reawakening of the
spirit of brotherhood and good-will among men’ (WOB 43). On
the contrary, it necessitates a complete, and organic reworking of
the very parameters around which contemporary human society
is based. ‘It calls for . . . a world organically unified in all the
essential aspects of its life, its political machinery, its spiritual
aspiration, its trade and finance, its script and language, and yet
infinite in the diversity of the national characteristics of its
federated units’ (WOB 43).

As in some of his other letters, the Guardian draws a parallel
between the violence and conflict which eventually ‘welded’ the
fiercely independent, and hitherto irreconcilable, American states
into one nation, and the process of ‘mental’ and ‘physical agony’
(WOB 45) which humanity as a whole would have to overcome
on its path towards unification.

> That the forces of a world catastrophe can alone precipitate
> such a new phase of human thought is, alas, becoming
> increasingly apparent. That nothing short of the fire of a
> severe ordeal, unparalleled in its intensity, can fuse and weld
> the discordant entities that constitute the elements of present-
> day civilization, into the integral components of the world
> commonwealth of the future, is a truth which future events
> will increasingly demonstrate. (WOB 46)

Shoghi Effendi concludes by reaffirming the responsibility of
every individual believer to aid, ‘with undimmed vision and
unabated zeal’, the further propagation of the message of
Bahá’u’lláh (WOB 48). He also reminds the Bahá’ís that the
turmoil of the time, threatening as it may seem, is a requisite
stage in mankind’s maturation, and will in due course culminate
in lasting peace and worldwide harmony.

In a letter written on his behalf in January 1932, Shoghi
Effendi made the following comments about ‘The Goal of a New
World Order’:

> Concerning the general letter he has sent lately to the

> primary importance of the Cause among the existing
> religions of the world is that, whereas the others have no

> Movement is rich with the very spirit and teachings the world

Are we, the privileged custodians of a priceless Faith, called
upon to witness a cataclysmical change, politically as
fundamental and spiritually as beneficent as that which
precipitated the fall of the Roman Empire in the West? Might
it not happen – every vigilant adherent of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh might well pause to reflect – that out of this
world eruption there may stream forces of such spiritual
energy as shall recall, nay eclipse, the splendor of those
signs and wonders that accompanied the establishment of the
Faith of Jesus Christ? Might there not emerge out of the
agony of a shaken world a religious revival of such scope
and power as to even transcend the potency of those world-
directing forces with which the Religions of the Past have, at
fixed intervals and according to an inscrutable Wisdom,
revived the fortunes of declining ages and peoples? Might
not the bankruptcy of this present, this highly-vaunted
materialistic civilization, in itself clear away the choking
weeds that now hinder the unfoldment and future
efflorescence of God’s struggling Faith? (WOB 33)

The call of Bahá’u’lláh is primarily directed against all
forms of provincialism, all insularities and prejudices. If
long-cherished ideals and time-honored institutions, if
certain social assumptions and religious formulae have
ceased to promote the welfare of the generality of mankind,
if they no longer minister to the needs of a continually
evolving humanity, let them be swept away and relegated
to the limbo of obsolescent and forgotten doctrines. Why
should these, in a world subject to the immutable law
of change and decay, be exempt from the deterioration
that must needs overtake every human institution? For
legal standards, political and economic theories are
solely designed to safeguard the interests of humanity
as a whole, and not humanity to be crucified for the

> preservation of the integrity of any particular law or
> doctrine. (WOB 42)

> Let there be no mistake. The principle of the Oneness of
> Mankind – the pivot round which all the teachings of
> Bahá’u’lláh revolve – is no mere outburst of ignorant
> emtionalism or an expression of vague and pious hope. Its
> appeal is not to be merely identified with a reawakening of
> the spirit of brotherhood and good-will among men, nor does
> it aim solely at the fostering of harmonious cooperation
> among individual peoples and nations. Its implications are
> deeper, its claims greater than any which the Prophets of old
> were allowed to advance. Its message is applicable not only
> to the individual, but concerns itself primarily with the nature
> of those essential relationships that must bind all the states
> and nations as members of one human family. It does not
> constitute merely the enunciation of an ideal, but stands
> inseparably associated with an institution adequate to
> embody its truth, demonstrate its validity, and perpetuate its
> influence. It implies an organic change in the structure of
> present-day society, a change such as the world has not yet
> experienced. It constitutes a challenge, at once bold and
> universal, to outworn shibboleths of national creeds – creeds
> that have had their day and which must, in the ordinary
> course of events as shaped and controlled by Providence,
> give way to a new gospel, fundamentally different from, and
> infinitely superior to, what the world has already conceived.
> It calls for no less than the reconstruction and the demili-
> tarization of the whole civilized world – a world organically
> unified in all the essential aspects of its life, its political
> machinery, its spiritual aspiration, its trade and finance, its
> script and language, and yet infinite in the diversity of the
> national characteristics of its federated units. (WOB 42–3)

E. ‘The Golden Age of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh’

In this 17-page message addressed to the friends in the United
States and Canada, Shoghi Effendi begins by lauding the
propelling force of the Faith of God which has, 10 years after the
passing of the beloved Master, ‘in the face of tremendous
obstacles, maintained its unity, resisted the malignant onslaught
of its ill-wishers, silenced its calumniators [and] broadened the
basis of its far-flung administration . . .’ (WOB 51). The letter
goes on to pay warm tribute to the community of Bahá’ís in
North America, to their efforts in aiding the progress of the Faith
and in defence of its interests in the oppressed lands of the East.

In order to contrast Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation to other, man-
created, movements, Shoghi Effendi poses this question for
reflection: ‘Where else, if not in the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh,
can the unbiased student of comparative religion cite instances
of a claim as stupendous as that which the Author of that Faith
advanced, foes as relentless as those which He faced, a devotion
more sublime than that which He kindled, a life as eventful and
as enthralling as that which He led?’ (WOB 55). The Guardian
draws a parallel between the early beginnings of past religions
and the thrilling episodes which accompanied the birth and rise
of the Bahá’í Faith, and gives a highly illuminating statement
establishing the principle of the progressiveness and relativity of
religious truth, and the unity and complementarity of all divinely
revealed religions. He further, categorically, states the pre-
eminent character of the Báb’s Faith, and the fact that He was
not only a Forerunner to Bahá’u’lláh, but an independent
Manifestation of God in His own right.

The letter also deals with the importance and implications of
the principle of non-interference in political affairs, pointing out
that this in no way means that Bahá’ís are indifferent to the
interests of their own country or the concept of sane patriotism. It
is clear from this statement that the current circumstances in the
world demand that such an attitude of non-involvement in

political and party pursuits should be uppermost in the minds of
the friends. This of course does not entail avoidance of purely
administrative positions in government, or association with
movements that are humanitarian in their pursuits and in har-
mony with the Bahá’í principles. The concluding paragraphs of
the letter address the need to carry out to a successful conclusion
the great enterprise of completing the Wilmette temple.

Some passages from this document are set forth below:

> That the Cause associated with the name of Bahá’u’lláh
> feeds itself upon those hidden springs of celestial strength
> which no force of human personality, whatever its glamour,
> can replace; that its reliance is solely upon that mystic
> Source with which no worldly advantage, be it wealth, fame,
> or learning can compare; that it propagates itself by ways
> mysterious and utterly at variance with the standards
> accepted by the generality of mankind, will, if not already
> apparent, become increasingly manifest as it forges ahead
> towards fresh conquests in its struggle for the spiritual
regeneration of mankind.

Indeed, how could it, unsupported as it has ever been by
> the counsels and the resources of the wise, the rich, and the
> learned in the land of its birth, have succeeded in breaking
> asunder the shackles that weighed upon it at the hour of its
> birth, in emerging unscathed from the storms that agitated its
> infancy, had not its animating breath been quickened by that
> spirit which is born of God, and on which all success,
> wherever and however it be sought, must ultimately depend?

(WOB 51–2)

> Not by the material resources which the members of this
> infant community can now summon to their aid; not by the
> numerical strength of its present-day supporters; nor by any
> direct tangible benefits its votaries can as yet confer upon the
> multitude of the needy and the disconsolate among their

\[148\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

countrymen, should its potentialities be tested or its worth
determined. Nowhere but in the purity of its precepts, the
sublimity of its standards, the integrity of its laws, the
reasonableness of its claims, the comprehensiveness of its
scope, the universality of its program, the flexibility of its
institutions, the lives of its founders, the heroism of its
martyrs, and the transforming power of its influence, should
the unprejudiced observer seek to obtain the true criterion
that can enable him to fathom its mysteries or to estimate its
virtue. (WOB 54)

Let them refrain from associating themselves, whether by
word or by deed, with the political pursuits of their
respective nations, with the policies of their governments and
the schemes and programs of parties and factions. In such
controversies they should assign no blame, take no side,
further no design, and identify themselves with no system
prejudicial to the best interests of that worldwide Fellowship
which it is their aim to guard and foster. Let them beware
lest they allow themselves to become the tools of
unscrupulous politicians, or to be entrapped by the
treacherous devices of the plotters and the perfidious among
their countrymen. Let them so shape their lives and regulate
their conduct that no charge of secrecy, of fraud, of bribery
or of intimidation may, however ill-founded, be brought
against them. Let them rise above all particularism and
partisanship, above the vain disputes, the petty calculations,
the transient passions that agitate the face, and engage the
attention, of a changing world. It is their duty to strive to
distinguish, as clearly as they possibly can, and if needed
with the aid of their elected representatives, such posts and
functions as are either diplomatic or political from those that
are purely administrative in character, and which under no
circumstances are affected by the changes and chances that
political activities and party government, in every land, must

> necessarily involve. Let them affirm their unyielding
> determination to stand, firmly and unreservedly, for the way
> of Bahá’u’lláh, to avoid the entanglements and bickerings
> inseparable from the pursuits of the politician, and to become
> worthy agencies of that Divine Polity which incarnates God’s
> immutable Purpose for all men. (WOB 64–5)

F. This Decisive Hour

This compilation of 135 pages, comprising 107 letters and cables
of Shoghi Effendi, covers the period from 1932 to 1946. It is a
revised edition of the earlier, 1947, volume entitled Messages to
America. The cables are distinct from those published in the past
by the American community, in that they are reproduced without
the interpolations inserted in cables, as published in the earlier
volume.

In this volume, Shoghi Effendi announces the publication of
Nabíl’s Narrative, underlines its significance, and reminds the
American friends that they are the spiritual descendants of the
Dawn-Breakers. He refers to the American Bahá’í community as
the ‘champion-builders of the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh’, and
stresses the importance of contributing to the National Fund and
particularly to the Temple Fund. He also announces his marriage,
in March of 1937, to Amatu’l-Bahá Rúḥíyyih Khánum. In this
message he refers to the institution of the Guardianship as ‘the
head-cornerstone’ of the Administrative Order, and characterizes
it as being directly associated, through his marriage, to the
community of North America.

In April of 1937 he launches the American Bahá’í com-
munity on their First Seven Year Plan, and encourages them to
intensify their teaching work and their pioneering activities, on
the home front as well as in virgin territories of Central and
South America. Twice during this period, first in 1939 and then
in 1942, he requests the National Assembly of the United States
and Canada to deputize first nine, then five members of the

\[150\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

community to settle in goal areas of the Seven Year Plan.
Concurrent with the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939,
during the second year of the Plan, he announces the transfer of
the blessed remains of the Purest Branch and the mother of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Mount Carmel, thereby reinforcing the spiritual
potencies of that ‘consecrated Spot’. As the Seven Year Plan
draws to a close, he announces the preparations to be made for
the Centenary of the Declaration of the Báb, the need to multiply
the number of pioneers and to complete the exterior orna-
mentation of the Temple in Wilmette, and the importance of the
participation of Latin American believers in the Centenary
celebrations to be held under the shadow of the Mother Temple
of the West.

In 1944 he announces the completion of his chief literary
work, God Passes By. Also at this time, and with a heavy-laden
heart, he makes known to the friends the faithlessness of
members of his own family. Towards the end of the period
covered by the compilation, in a message dated April 1946 to the
National Convention, he inaugurates the start of the Second
Seven Year Plan and explains how its goals are related to the
spiritual conquest of the planet.

A few quotes from these messages are included below:

> The handling of this delicate and vital problem regarding
> non-participation by Bahá’ís of East and West in political
> affairs, calls for the utmost circumspection, tact, patience
> and vigilance, on the part of those whose function and
> privilege it is to guard, promote and administer the activities
> of a worldwide, ever-advancing Cause. The misgivings and
> apprehensions of individual Bahá’ís should be allayed and
> eventually completely dispelled. Any misconception of the
> sane and genuine patriotism that animates every Bahá’í
> heart, if it ever obscures or perplexes the minds of
> responsible government officials, should be instantly and
courageously dissipated. Any deliberate misrepresentation,

> by the enemies of the Cause of God of the aims, the tenets
> and methods of the administrators of the Faith of
> Bahá’u’lláh should be vigorously faced and its fallacy
> pitilessly exposed. The Cause, to which we belong, stands on
> the threshold of an era of unprecedented expansion. Its
> problems are many, divers and challenging. Our methods
> and ways of approach must likewise be characterized by
> unusual sagacity, consummate skill and wisdom. He will
> surely never fail us in meeting the needs of a critical hour.

(TDH 5)

> As I lift up my gaze beyond the strain and stresses which a
> struggling Faith must necessarily experience, and view the
> wider scene which the indomitable will of the American
> Bahá’í community is steadily unfolding, I cannot but marvel
> at the range which the driving force of their ceaseless labors

> faith has attained. The outposts of a Faith, already per-
> secuted in both Europe and Asia, are in the American
> continent steadily advancing, the visible symbols of its
> undoubted sovereignty are receiving fresh luster every day
> and its manifold institutions are driving their roots deeper
> and deeper into its soil. Blest and honored as none among its

> through the inscrutable dispensations of Divine Providence
> for a destiny which no mind can as yet imagine, such a
> community cannot for a moment afford to be content with or
> rest on the laurels it has so deservedly won. It must go on,
> continually go on, exploring fresh fields, scaling nobler
> heights, laying firmer foundations, shedding added splendor
> and achieving added renown in the service and for the glory
> of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. The Seven Year Plan, which it
> has sponsored and with which its destiny is so closely inter-
> woven, must at all costs be prosecuted with increasing force
> and added consecration. All should arise and participate.

\[152\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

Upon the measure of such a participation will no doubt
depend the welfare and progress of those distant com-
munities which are now battling for their emancipation. To
such a priceless privilege the inheritors of the shining grace
of Bahá’u’lláh cannot surely be indifferent. The American
believers must gird up the loins of endeavor and step into the
arena of service with such heroism as shall astound the
entire Bahá’í world. Let them be assured that my prayers will
continue to be offered on their behalf. (TDH 18–19)

[I]t must be clearly understood, nor can it be sufficiently
emphasized, that the conjunction of the resting-place of the
Greatest Holy Leaf with those of her brother and mother
incalculably reinforces the spiritual potencies of that con-
secrated Spot which, under the wings of the Báb’s
overshadowing Sepulcher, and in the vicinity of the future
Mashriqu’l-Adhkár which will be reared on its flank, is
destined to evolve into the focal center of those world-
shaking, world-embracing, world-directing administrative
institutions, ordained by Bahá’u’lláh and anticipated by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and which are to function in consonance with
the principles that govern the twin institutions of the
Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice. Then, and
then only, will this momentous prophecy which illuminates
the concluding passages of the Tablet of Carmel be fulfilled:
‘Erelong will God sail His Ark upon thee (Carmel), and will
manifest the people of Bahá who have been mentioned in the
Book of Names.’

To attempt to visualize, even in its barest outline, the
glory that must envelop these institutions, to essay even a
tentative and partial description of their character or the
manner of their operation, or to trace however inadequately
the course of events leading to their rise and eventual
establishment is far beyond my own capacity and power.
Suffice it to say that at this troubled stage in world history

> the association of these three incomparably precious souls
> who, next to the three Central Figures of our Faith, tower in
> rank above the vast multitude of the heroes, Letters, martyrs,
> hands, teachers and administrators of the Cause of
> Bahá’u’lláh, in such a potentially powerful spiritual and
> administrative Center, is in itself an event which will release
> forces that are bound to hasten the emergence in a land
> which, geographically, spiritually and administratively,
> constitutes the heart of the entire planet, of some of the
> brightest gems of that World Order now shaping in the womb
> of this travailing age. (TDH 46)

> Were anyone to imagine or expect that a Cause, comprising
> within its orbit so vast a portion of the globe, so turbulent in
> its history, so challenging in its claims, so diversified in the
> elements it has assimilated into its administrative structure,
> should at all times be immune to any divergence of opinion,
> or any defection on the part of its multitudinous followers,
> [it] would be sheer delusion, wholly unreasonable and un-
> warranted, even in the face of the unprecedented evidences of
> the miraculous power which its rise and progress have so

G. ‘America and the Most Great Peace’

In this 23-page letter, dated 21 April 1933, addressed to the
believers in the United States and Canada on the occasion of the
passage of 40 years after the first public reference to Bahá’u’lláh
and His Faith in the United States, Shoghi Effendi outlines the
distinctions achieved by the American Bahá’í community in
service to the Cause. He refers to them as a community which

has attained ‘an undisputed leadership among its sister
communities of East and West’ (WOB 72).

In this letter he recounts the attacks on the Faith, the ‘vilest
imputations’ hurled at its face, and the false assumption made by
its enemies that it was ‘an expiring creed’ (WOB 72). He recalls
that the Báb had been labelled by these opponents as a ‘perverted
apostate’ (WOB 72) and Bahá’u’lláh was denounced as ‘an
unscrupulous plotter and usurper’, while ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was
branded a ‘stirrer of mischief and a notorious exponent of
expediency and fraud’ (WOB 73). The principle of the oneness
of the human race has been referred to by these same detractors
as ‘a shallow attempt at uniformity’, the supernatural forces
animating the Faith condemned as ‘a vain belief in magic’ and its
teachings on universal peace as ‘a mere utopia’ (WOB 73). They
have hailed the efforts of the Covenant-breakers as ‘invading
forces of schism’ which would lead the Faith to complete ‘ruin’
(WOB 73).

It is God’s design, Shoghi Effendi further points out, that the
centre of Bahá’í activity should gravitate ‘away from its cradle to
the shores of the American continent’, from East to West (WOB
74). He then draws a parallel to the rise of Christianity in the
East and the manner in which, at its appointed time, the
‘standard-bearers of the Cause of Jesus Christ’ succeeded in
establishing ‘His worldwide dominion on the ruins’ of the
Roman Empire (WOB 74). The spread of the Faith from Iran to
the West was one of the most outstanding aims adopted by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá for His Ministry. Shoghi Effendi describes the
infinite love which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá showered, incessantly but
wisely, on the American friends, culminating in His choice to
address the Tablets of the Divine Plan specifically to the North
American Bahá’í community.

He then reviews the developments of the Faith during each of
the four decades since its appearance in North America. He lauds
the influence exerted by the early Western pilgrims to the Holy
Land, and the manner in which the Faith struck its roots in

\[156\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

American soil. The passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, he points out,
released ‘potent energies’ which crystallized in the system of
Bahá’í Administration. After referring to Covenant-breakers and
their vicious onslaughts on the Faith, he assures the friends that
‘these notorious exponents of corruption and heresy’ succeed ‘in
protruding for a time their ugly features only to sink, as rapidly
as they had risen, into the mire of an ignominious end’ (WOB
90).

Shoghi Effendi then lavishly extols the American Bahá’í
community for its success in formulating the legal instruments to
incorporate the National Assembly, in transferring national
endowments into its name, in succouring its Egyptian brethren,
in intervening on behalf of its fellow workers in the Soviet
Republics, and in extending its support for its harassed brethren
in Persia. He particularly praises the efforts of such members of
the community as Mountfort Mills for his defence of the right of
the Bahá’ís to the ownership of the House of Bahá’u’lláh in
Baghdád, and Martha Root for her confirmed teaching work and
particularly her success in obtaining from royalty repeated
testimonies to the power of God’s Holy Faith. He also mentions
the courageous efforts of Keith Ransom-Kehler to obtain for the
Persian Bahá’í community a greater measure of freedom and
recognition, and finally the band of American women pioneers
who scattered throughout the continents to raise the standard of
the Faith in different countries.

He ends this stirring message with these questions, which he
puts to the American Bahá’í community:

> Will it be America, will it be one of the countries of Europe,
> who will arise to assume the leadership essential to the
> shaping of the destinies of this troubled age? Will America
> allow any of her sister communities in East or West to
> achieve such ascendancy as shall deprive her of that spiritual
> primacy with which she has been invested and which she has
thus far so nobly retained? Will she not rather contribute, by

> a still further revelation of those inherent powers that motiv-
> ate her life, to enhance the priceless heritage which the love
and wisdom of a departed Master have conferred upon her?

Her past has been a testimony to the inexhaustible vitality
of her faith. May not her future confirm it? (WOB 94)

A few more quotes from the letter follow:

> Contrast the sad plight of the nations of the earth, and in
> particular this great Republic of the West, with the rising
> fortunes of that handful of its citizens [the Bahá’ís], whose
> mission, if they be faithful to their trust, is to heal its wounds,
> restore its confidence and revive its shattered hopes.
> Contrast the dreadful convulsions, the internecine conflicts,
> the petty disputes, the outworn controversies, the intermin-
> able revolutions that agitate the masses, with the calm new
> light of Peace and of Truth which envelops, guides and
> sustains those valiant inheritors of the law and love of
> Bahá’u’lláh. Compare the disintegrating institutions, the dis-
> credited statesmanship, the exploded theories, the appalling
> degradation, the follies and furies, the shifts, shams and com-
> promises that characterize the present age, with the steady
> consolidation, the holy discipline, the unity and cohesiveness,
> the assured conviction, the uncompromising loyalty, the
> heroic self-sacrifice that constitute the hallmark of these
> faithful stewards and harbingers of the golden age of the
> Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. (WOB 79)

> The passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, so sudden in the circumstances
> which caused it, so dramatic in its consequences, could
> neither impede the operation of such a dynamic force nor
> obscure its purpose. Those fervid appeals, embodied in the
> Will and Testament of a departed Master, could not but
> confirm its aim, define its character and reinforce the
> promise of its ultimate success.

\[158\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

Out of the pangs of anguish which His bereaved
followers have suffered, amid the heat and dust which the
attacks launched by a sleepless enemy had precipitated, the
Administration of Bahá’u’lláh’s invincible Faith was born.
The potent energies released through the ascension of the
Center of His Covenant crystallized into this supreme, this
infallible Organ for the accomplishment of a Divine Purpose.
The Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá unveiled its
character, reaffirmed its basis, supplemented its principles,
asserted its indispensability, and enumerated its chief
institutions. With that self-same spontaneity which had
characterized her response to the Message proclaimed by
Bahá’u’lláh America had now arisen to espouse the cause of
the Administration which the Will and Testament of His Son
had unmistakably established. It was given to her, and to her
alone, in the turbulent years following the revelation of so
momentous a Document, to become the fearless champion of
that Administration, the pivot of its new-born institutions and
the leading promoter of its influence. To their Persian
brethren, who in the heroic age of the Faith had won the
crown of martyrdom, the American believers, forerunners of
its golden age, were now worthily succeeding, bearing in
their turn the palm of a hard-won victory. The unbroken
record of their illustrious deeds had established beyond the
shadow of a doubt their preponderating share in shaping the
destinies of their Faith. In a world writhing with pain and
declining into chaos this community – the vanguard of the
liberating forces of Bahá’u’lláh – succeeded in the years
following ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s passing in raising high above the
institutions established by its sister communities in East and
West what may well constitute the chief pillar of that future
House – a House which posterity will regard as the last
refuge of a tottering civilization. (WOB 89)

H. ‘The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh’

‘The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh’ is one of the major works of
Shoghi Effendi, written at a time when both Communism and
Fascism were spreading their influence across Europe. In this
work, 60 pages in length, Shoghi Effendi gives us the basic and
doctrinal verities of the Faith, which lie at its very core. In a
letter of 10 January 1935 to an individual believer, the Guardian
points out that his ‘Dispensation’ constitutes an ‘invaluable
supplement’ to Bahá’u’lláh’s Book of the Covenant, and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament (LDG Vol. 1, 65). It is
worthy of note that Shoghi Effendi states that the Will and
Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá itself ‘supplements’ (WOB 19) the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas in matters related to the World Order.

Of such importance is ‘The Dispensation’ that Rúḥíyyih
Khánum, in The Priceless Pearl, relates that Shoghi Effendi had
remarked more than once that he ‘considered he had said all he
had to say, in many ways, in the Dispensation’ (PP 213). To
many pilgrims, including Hands of the Cause, he stated that his
‘Dispensation’ should be regarded as his will and testament.

At the very outset of the document, Shoghi Effendi states that
he intends in this letter to ‘lay special stress . . . upon certain
truths which lie at the basis of our Faith and the integrity of
which it is our first duty to safeguard. These verities, if valiantly
upheld and properly assimilated, will, I am convinced, power-
fully reinforce the vigor of our spiritual life, and greatly assist in
counteracting the machinations of an implacable and vigilant
enemy’ (WOB 99–100).

The purpose of this remarkable document is for the believers
to attain to a clear understanding of the unique stations of
Bahá’u’lláh, the Báb and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He describes these three
Figures in the following paragraph:

> Dominating the entire range of this fascinating spectacle [the
> mysterious workings of God’s Revelation] towers the

\[160\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

> incomparable figure of Bahá’u’lláh, transcendental in His
> majesty, serene, awe-inspiring, unapproachably glorious.
> Allied, though subordinate in rank, and invested with the
> authority of presiding with Him over the destinies of this
> supreme Dispensation, there shines upon this mental picture
> the youthful glory of the Báb, infinite in His tenderness,
> irresistible in His charm, unsurpassed in His heroism,
> matchless in the dramatic circumstances of His short yet
> eventful life. And finally there emerges, though on a plane of
> its own and in a category entirely apart from the one
> occupied by the twin Figures that preceded Him, the vibrant,
> the magnetic personality of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, reflecting to a
> degree that no man, however exalted his station, can hope to
> rival, the glory and power with which They who are the
> Manifestations of God are alone endowed. (WOB 97–8)

The first section of this letter is the citation of several
excerpts from the Writings of the Central Figures of the Faith, to
disclose to the reader ‘the sublimity of this unique Cycle in the
world’s religious history’ (WOB 112). In explaining the station
of Bahá’u’lláh, Shoghi Effendi makes it very clear that the
Manifestation of God and the divinity attributed to Him should
not be confused with the idea of divine incarnation in the person
of the Manifestation. Shoghi Effendi categorically states:

> [T]hat invisible yet rational God Who, however much we
> extol the divinity of His Manifestations on earth, can in no
> wise incarnate His infinite, His unknowable, His
> incorruptible and all-embracing Reality in the concrete and
> limited frame of a mortal being. Indeed, the God Who could
> so incarnate His own reality would, in the light of the
> teachings of Bahá’u’lláh, cease immediately to be God.

(WOB 112)

This belief, he maintains, ‘should never be obscured, and [its]
integrity . . . no one of His followers should allow to be
compromised’ (WOB 114).

The last part of the section dealing with Bahá’u’lláh quotes
from the Writings to indicate the oneness that unites all Divine
Revelations, their continuity and progressiveness, and the fact
that Bahá’u’lláh, despite the vast range of His Dispensation,
‘repudiates the claim to be regarded as the final revelation of
God’s will and purpose for mankind’ (WOB 115).

The next section considers the station of the Báb. Shoghi
Effendi writes: ‘Indeed the greatness of the Báb consists
primarily, not in His being the divinely-appointed Forerunner of
so transcendent a Revelation, but rather in His having been
invested with the powers inherent in the inaugurator of a
separate religious Dispensation, and in His wielding, to a degree
unrivalled by the Messengers gone before Him, the scepter of
independent Prophethood’ (WOB 123). This forthright statement
is substantiated by him with several quotations from the Writings
of Bahá’u’lláh, the Báb Himself, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

The third section discusses the distinctive station of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. Shoghi Effendi writes,

> It would be indeed difficult for us, who stand so close to such
> a tremendous figure and are drawn by the mysterious power
> of so magnetic a personality, to obtain a clear and exact
> understanding of the rôle and character of One Who, not
> only in the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh but in the entire field
> of religious history, fulfills a unique function . . . He towers,
> in conjunction with them [Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb], above
> the destinies of this infant Faith of God from a level to which
> no individual or body ministering to its needs after Him, and
> for no less a period than a full thousand years, can ever hope
> to rise. (WOB 131–2)

\[162\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

A series of quotations follows from the Writings of
Bahá’u’lláh to support his statement. He ends the section by
asserting that the belief of some early Western Bahá’ís to the
effect that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was the return of Christ, and that He
and Bahá’u’lláh possessed the same station and reality, was
completely erroneous. Such an identity applies indeed to the Báb
and Bahá’u’lláh Themselves.

The final section of the letter deals with the Administrative
Order and its twin institutions of the Guardianship and the
Universal House of Justice. In describing its significance, Shoghi
Effendi writes:

> This Administrative Order, as it expands and consolidates
> itself, will no doubt manifest the potentialities and reveal the
> full implications of this momentous Document [the Will and
> Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] – this most remarkable expres-
> sion of the Will of One of the most remarkable Figures of the
> Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh. It will, as its component parts,
> its organic institutions, begin to function with efficiency and
> vigor, assert its claim and demonstrate its capacity to be
> regarded not only as the nucleus but the very pattern of the
> New World Order destined to embrace in the fullness of time
> the whole of mankind. (WOB 144)

He further stresses the point that in the scripture of none of the
religions of the past ‘do we find any provisions establishing a
covenant, or providing for an administrative order, that can
compare in scope and authority with those that lie at the very
basis of the Bahá’í Dispensation’ (WOB 145).

This section goes on to explain the character and functions of
the twin pillars that support this administrative structure,
described by him as ‘two fundamental organs of the Will of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ (WOB 147) and clarifies the relationship between
the two. The final pages of this section deal with the similarities

and dissimilarities between this Administrative Order and the
theory and practice of other systems of governance in the world.

Further quotations are included below:

> Significant as are the origins of this mighty administrative
> structure, and however unique its features, the happenings
> that may be said to have heralded its birth and signalized the
> initial stage of its evolution seem no less remarkable. How
> striking, how edifying the contrast between the process of
> slow and steady consolidation that characterizes the growth
> of its infant strength and the devastating onrush of the forces
> of disintegration that are assailing the outworn institutions,
both religious and secular, of present-day society!

The vitality which the organic institutions of this great,
> this ever-expanding Order so strongly exhibit; the obstacles
> which the high courage, the undaunted resolution of its
> administrators have already surmounted; the fire of an
> unquenchable enthusiasm that glows with undiminished
> fervour in the hearts of its itinerant teachers; the heights of
> self-sacrifice which its champion-builders are now attaining;
> the breadth of vision, the confident hope, the creative joy, the

> are evidences of a power which a disillusioned and sadly
shaken society can ill afford to ignore.

I. ‘The Unfoldment of World Civilization’

In 1936, in the context of escalating political turmoil and dire
socio-economic conditions in Europe and America, Shoghi
Effendi addressed the Bahá’ís of the West. Although, he stated,
the signs of progress in the development of the New World
Order were evident to any ‘fair-minded observer’, he warned that
concurrent with that rise was the ‘downfall of those powers and
principalities that have either ignored or opposed’ the onward
march of the Faith (WOB 161). This process of ‘mystic, all-
pervasive’ change which the Guardian describes is twofold
(WOB 163–4). On one hand, it increasingly engenders oneness
and cohesion. On the other, it disrupts an already ailing world,
forcing mankind to abandon its ‘hollow and outworn institutions’
and its ‘obsolescent doctrines and beliefs’ (WOB 170). In further
elaborating on this simultaneous and paradoxical process of
integration and disintegration, Shoghi Effendi draws an inter-
esting parallel between the incremental evolution of global
government and society and the period of crisis preceding the
eventual foundation of the United States of America. He explains

that the ‘moral and social gloom’ which characterizes human-
ity’s state of collective adolescence would lead to its maturation
and prepare it for its inevitable unification (WOB 168). He also
emphasizes that this ‘coming of age’ would accord with the
existing operational structure and animating spirit of the
Administrative Order (WOB 163).

Shoghi Effendi attributed the fall of Shi’ah Islam and the
Qájár dynasty, and the receding power of the Sunni caliphs of
Constantinople, to the rampant rise of secularism in the East. He
explained that the sovereign leaders of these Faiths and Empires
were the authors of their own demise by attempting to obstruct
the advancement of the Faith, and by failing to heed Bahá-
’u’lláh’s warnings. In demonstrating this, the Guardian provides
examples of Bahá’u’lláh’s messages and describes the fate that
befell those who disregarded His Call. He parallels the plight of
Islam with that of Christianity, foretelling that ‘the forces of
irreligion, of a purely materialistic philosophy [and] of
unconcealed paganism’ (WOB 180) would trigger its downfall.
Unbridled industrialism had overcome the erstwhile ‘Christian’
world, and a concomitant rise in nationalism – inculcating in due
course the deification of the state – would unavoidably result in
‘a marked weakening of the Church and . . . a grave diminution
of its spiritual influence’ (WOB 182). The Guardian also points
to a widening gulf between liberal and fundamentalist denom-
inations within the Christian and Muslim Faiths as being a
contributory factor to the weakening of their influence.

The Guardian explains that the progressive decay of these
religions would result in a phase of decadence, perversion and
corruption in human conduct; and that political disarray and
economic strangulation, as well as the inefficacy of multilateral
governance structures on the global stage, were a direct con-
sequence of humanity’s morally retarded state. However, he
applauds efforts made by the League of Nations Member States
in attempting to develop a sufficiently forceful collective security
system, and quotes passages from Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings on the

\[166\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

subject. He also stresses that it is only through the regulation of
the use of force and the development of a commonly acceptable
international executive mechanism that ‘the oneness of the whole
body of nations will be made the ruling principle of international
life’ (WOB 193). The time of nation-building, he underlines, is at
an end, and the insistence on preserving absolute state
sovereignty is counterproductive to ‘the oneness and wholeness
of human relationships’ (WOB 202).

Shoghi Effendi concludes by emphasizing the non-sectarian,
‘rigidly non-partisan’ (WOB 198) and supranational nature of
the Faith. He explains that Bahá’u’lláh foresaw the inauguration
of a universal system of governance, and the establishment of a
world language, currency, script and system of measurement.

Some further quotes from this remarkable document are
given below:

> The Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, whose supreme mission is
> none other but the achievement of this organic and spiritual
> unity of the whole body of nations, should, if we be faithful to
> its implications, be regarded as signalizing through its
> advent the coming of age of the entire human race. It should
> be viewed not merely as yet another spiritual revival in the
> ever-changing fortunes of mankind, not only as a further
> stage in a chain of progressive Revelations, nor even as the
> culmination of one of a series of recurrent prophetic cycles,
> but rather as marking the last and highest stage in the
> stupendous evolution of man’s collective life on this planet.
> The emergence of a world community, the consciousness of
> world citizenship, the founding of a world civilization and
> culture – all of which must synchronize with the initial stages
> in the unfoldment of the Golden Age of the Bahá’í Era –
> should, by their very nature, be regarded, as far as this
> planetary life is concerned, as the furthermost limits in the
> organization of human society, though man, as an individual,

> will, nay must indeed as a result of such a consummation,
> continue indefinitely to progress and develop. (WOB 163)

> Deep as is the gloom that already encircles the world, the
> afflictive ordeals which that world is to suffer are still in
> preparation, nor can their blackness be as yet imagined. We
> stand on the threshold of an age whose convulsions proclaim
> alike the death-pangs of the old order and the birth-pangs of
> the new. (WOB 169)

> The recrudescence of religious intolerance, of racial animos-
> ity, and of patriotic arrogance; the increasing evidences of
> selfishness, of suspicion, of fear and of fraud; the spread of
> terrorism, of lawlessness, of drunkenness and of crime; the
> unquenchable thirst for, and the feverish pursuit after,
> earthly vanities, riches and pleasures; the weakening of
> family solidarity; the laxity in parental control; the lapse into
> luxurious indulgence; the irresponsible attitude towards
> marriage and the consequent rising tide of divorce; the
> degeneracy of art and music, the infection of literature, and
> the corruption of the press; the extension of the influence and
> activities of those ‘prophets of decadence’ who advocate
> companionate marriage, who preach the philosophy of

> to regard the procreation of children as the sacred and
> primary purpose of marriage, who denounce religion as an

> unfolding system – dissociating itself from such appellations

as Bábí sect, Asiatic cult, and offshoot of Shí’ih Islám, with
which the ignorant and the malicious were wont to describe
it, refusing to be labeled as a mere philosophy of life, or as
an eclectic code of ethical conduct, or even as a new
religion, the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh is now visibly succeeding
in demonstrating its claim and title to be regarded as a
World Religion, destined to attain, in the fullness of time, the
status of a world-embracing Commonwealth, which would be
at once the instrument and the guardian of the Most Great
Peace announced by its Author. (WOB 196)

How can a Faith, it should moreover be borne in mind,
whose divinely-ordained institutions have been established
within the jurisdiction of no less than forty different
countries, the policies and interests of whose governments
are continually clashing and growing more complex and
confused every day – how can such a Faith, by allowing its
adherents, whether individually or through its organized
councils, to meddle in political activities, succeed in
preserving the integrity of its teachings and in safeguarding
the unity of its followers? How can it insure the vigorous, the
uninterrupted and peaceful development of its expanding
institutions? How can a Faith, whose ramifications have
brought it into contact with mutually incompatible religious
systems, sects and confessions, be in a position, if it permits
its adherents to subscribe to obsolescent observances and
doctrines, to claim the unconditional allegiance of those
whom it is striving to incorporate into its divinely-appointed
system? How can it avoid the constant friction, the
misunderstandings and controversies which formal affili-
ation, as distinct from association, must inevitably engender?
(WOB 199)

The long ages of infancy and childhood, through which the
human race had to pass, have receded into the background.

> Humanity is now experiencing the commotions invariably
> associated with the most turbulent stage of its evolution, the
> stage of adolescence, when the impetuosity of youth and its
> vehemence reach their climax, and must gradually be
> superseded by the calmness, the wisdom, and the maturity
> that characterize the stage of manhood. Then will the human
> race reach that stature of ripeness which will enable it to
> acquire all the powers and capacities upon which its ultimate
> development must depend. (WOB 202)

> The unity of the human race, as envisaged by Bahá’u’lláh,
> implies the establishment of a world commonwealth in which
> all nations, races, creeds and classes are closely and
> permanently united, and in which the autonomy of its state
> members and the personal freedom and initiative of the
> individuals that comprise them are definitely and completely
> safeguarded. (WOB 203)

> A world federal system, ruling the whole earth and exercising
> unchallengeable authority over its unimaginably vast
> resources, blending and embodying the ideals of both the
> East and the West, liberated from the curse of war and its
> miseries, and bent on the exploitation of all the available
> sources of energy on the surface of the planet, a system in
> which Force is made the servant of Justice, whose life is
> sustained by its universal recognition of one God and by its
> allegiance to one common Revelation – such is the goal
> towards which humanity, impelled by the unifying forces of
> life, is moving. (WOB 204)

J. The Advent of Divine Justice

The Advent of Divine Justice reads like a 77-page poem. Written
in December 1938, at a time when Europe was showing signs of
profound unrest, which led less than a year later to the outbreak

\[170\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

of the Second World War, this letter, addressed to the Bahá’í
community of the United States and Canada, focuses on the
nature and scope of America’s divinely-ordained mission, and
states that ‘the impelling force of circumstances’ (ADJ 43) will
inevitably oblige it to overcome its various challenges and
execute the tasks which lie ahead. Shoghi Effendi meticulously
lists such characteristics as are imperative if Bahá’ís in North
America are to carry out its mission. Among them the Guardian
specifically mentions ‘a rectitude of conduct’ (ADJ 26), ‘an
abiding sense of undeviating justice’ (ADJ 23), adherence to ‘the
obligation of chastity and holiness’ (ADJ 29), and ‘a fraternity
freed from that cancerous growth of racial prejudice, which is
eating into the vitals of an already debilitated society’ (ADJ 23).

American society, Shoghi Effendi points out, is ‘immersed in
a sea of materialism, a prey to one of the most virulent and long-
standing forms of racial prejudice, and notorious for its political
corruption, lawlessness and laxity in moral standards’ (ADJ 19).
In fact, he emphasizes that it is not because of any ‘racial
superiority’, social capacity or spiritual distinction that America
was chosen as ‘champion-builders’ of the Administrative Order,
but because it was a nation stained by ‘political corruption and
. . . moral license’ (ADJ 17, 20, 20).

The letter also sets out the requirements of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
Divine Plan and the Seven Year Plan, mentioning in turn the
teaching requirements that are incumbent upon all believers and
the need for thorough intellectual familiarization with the
history, social principles and spiritual teachings of both the
Bahá’í Faith and its predecessor, Islam. The Guardian encour-
ages the American Bahá’ís to consider pioneering within the
Americas, and stresses the importance of ‘rearing’ (ADJ 63)
permanent local and national institutions within the US and
across the two continents. The importance of the participation of
Bahá’í youth in the execution of this mission is also underlined.
Youth, he states, ‘can contribute so decisively to the virility, the
purity, and the driving force of the life of the Bahá’í community,

and upon [them] must depend the future orientation of its
destiny, and the complete unfoldment of the potentialities with
which God has endowed it’ (ADJ 22).

Shoghi Effendi explained that the pervasive and intensifying
political turmoil of the late 1930s, in itself, presented an ideal
opportunity both for the spiritual growth of the Bahá’í com-
munity and for the wider dissemination of the message of
Bahá’u’lláh. ‘These recurrent crises’, he writes, ‘which, with
ominous frequency and resistless force, are afflicting an ever-
increasing portion of the human race must of necessity continue,
however impermanently, to exercise, in a certain measure, their
baleful influence upon a world community which has spread its
ramifications to the uttermost ends of the earth’ (ADJ 2).

Later he writes that ‘The opportunities which the turmoil of
the present age presents, with all the sorrows which it evokes,
the fears which it excites, the disillusionment which it produces,
the perplexities which it creates, the indignation which it
arouses, the revolt which it provokes, the grievances it
engenders, the spirit of restless search which it awakens, must, in
like manner, be exploited for the purpose of spreading far and
wide the knowledge of the redemptive power of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh, and for enlisting fresh recruits in the ever-swelling
army of His followers’ (ADJ 48). ‘[T]he synchronization of such
world-shaking crises’, he goes on to say, ‘with the progressive
unfoldment and fruition of their divinely appointed task is itself
the work of Providence . . . Such simultaneous processes of rise
and fall, of integration and of disintegration, of order and chaos,
with their continuous and reciprocal reactions on each other, are
but aspects of a greater Plan, one and indivisible, whose Source
is God, whose author is Bahá’u’lláh, the theater of whose
operations is the entire planet, and whose ultimate objectives
are the unity of the human race and the peace of all mankind’
(ADJ 72–3).

Much of what the Guardian was telling the American Bahá’í
Community in 1939 is distressingly applicable to the socio-

\[172\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

political context in which the world finds itself today. ‘The light
of religion is dimmed and moral authority is disintegrating,’
Shoghi Effendi writes. ‘The nations of the world have, for the
most part, fallen a prey to battling ideologies that threaten to
disrupt the very foundations of their dearly won political unity.
Agitated multitudes in these countries seethe with discontent, are
armed to the teeth, are stampeded with fear, and groan beneath
the yoke of tribulations engendered by political strife, racial
fanaticism, national hatreds, and religious animosities’ (ADJ
88). This, therefore, represents an ideal time for Bahá’í youth to
trigger change.

A few more excerpts from this precious and often-quoted
document are included below.

> A world, torn with conflicting passions, and perilously
> disintegrating from within, finds itself confronted, at so
> crucial an epoch in its history, by the rising fortunes of an
> infant Faith, a Faith that, at times, seems to be drawn into its

> its passions. In its very heart, within its cradle, at the seat of
> its first and venerable Temple, in one of its hitherto
> flourishing and potentially powerful centres, the as-yet
> unemancipated Faith of Bahá’u’lláh seems indeed to have
> retreated before the onrushing forces of violence and dis-
> order to which humanity is steadily falling a victim. The
> strongholds of such a Faith, one by one and day after day,
> are to outward seeming being successively isolated, as-
> saulted and captured. As the lights of liberty flicker and go

> as the fires of fanaticism flame with increasing fierceness in

> sion, and of complete emancipation, leading in turn to its
> being acknowledged as an independent Faith, enjoying the
> status of full equality with its sister religions, to be followed
> by its establishment and recognition as a State religion,
> which in turn must give way to its assumption of the rights
> and prerogatives associated with the Bahá’í state, func-
> tioning in the plenitude of its powers, a stage which must
> ultimately culminate in the emergence of the worldwide
> Bahá’í Commonwealth, animated wholly by the spirit, and
> operating solely in direct conformity with the laws and

eventually win over to its camp the most vociferous and
inveterate amongst its foes. (ADJ 42)

The field is indeed so immense, the period so critical, the
Cause so great, the workers so few, the time so short, the
privilege so priceless, that no follower of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh, worthy to bear His name, can afford a
moment’s hesitation. That God-born Force, irresistible in its
sweeping power, incalculable in its potency, unpredictable in
its course, mysterious in its workings, and awe-inspiring in
its manifestations – a Force which, as the Báb has written,
‘vibrates within the innermost being of all created things,’
and which, according to Bahá’u’lláh, has through its ‘vibrat-
ing influence,’ ‘upset the equilibrium of the world and revo-
lutionized its ordered life’ – such a Force, acting even as a
two-edged sword, is, under our very eyes, sundering, on the
one hand, the age-old ties which for centuries have held
together the fabric of civilized society, and is unloosing, on
the other, the bonds that still fetter the infant and as yet
unemancipated Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. (ADJ 46–7)

The opportunities which the turmoil of the present age
presents, with all the sorrows which it evokes, the fears
which it excites, the disillusionment which it produces, the
perplexities which it creates, the indignation which it
arouses, the revolt which it provokes, the grievances it
engenders, the spirit of restless search which it awakens,
must, in like manner, be exploited for the purpose of
spreading far and wide the knowledge of the redemptive
power of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, and for enlisting fresh
recruits in the ever-swelling army of His followers. So
precious an opportunity, so rare a conjunction of favorable
circumstances, may never again recur. Now is the time, the
appointed time, for the American believers, the vanguard of
the hosts of the Most Great Name, to proclaim, through the

> agencies and channels of a specially designed Administrative
> Order, their capacity and readiness to rescue a fallen and
> sore-tried generation, that has rebelled against its God and
> ignored His warnings, and to offer it that complete security
> which only the strongholds of their Faith can provide. (ADJ
> 48)

K. The Promised Day is Come

Written in 1941, in the early years of the Second World War, and
addressed to the Bahá’ís of the West, The Promised Day is Come
reminded believers that the ‘retributive calamity’ (PDC 183) that
had overcome humanity at that point in history was largely due
to its ignorance of the modern message of God. In order to
underline the importance of the Divine Call in this day, the
Guardian quotes extensive passages from the Writings of the
Central Figures of the Faith. The book comprises 130 pages.
Shoghi Effendi includes some 50 pages of direct quotations from
the Writings, of which more than half run to an entire page. The
rest are scattered throughout the body of the text.

As ever-escalating conflict gripped the world, Shoghi Effendi
reassured the Bahá’í community of the genesis, direction and
necessity of the ‘titanic upheaval’ mankind was experiencing
(PDC 5). Underpinning his message was the notion that fears for
the immediate future necessarily engendered hope for the distant
future and that, though the severity of the calamity seemed
overwhelming, it would inexorably result in worldwide accept-
ance of Bahá’u’lláh’s message. He writes: ‘It [the judgment of
God] is at once a visitation from God and a cleansing process
for all mankind. Its fires punish the perversity of the human race,
and weld its component parts into one organic, indivisible,
world-embracing community’ (PDC 5–6). Contrasting the
‘distressing’ darkness of the past with the ‘glorious’ radiance of
the future, the Guardian explains that the path towards human-
ity’s ultimate unification must, of necessity, comprise a stage of

\[176\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

adversity and discord (PDC 200–1). Although ‘the folly and
tumult of strife . . . blackened the annals of mankind’, this would
constitute a prerequisite for ‘worldwide reconciliation’ and a
lasting, universal peace (PDC 192).

He writes: ‘We are indeed living in an age which, if we
would correctly appraise it, should be regarded as one which is
witnessing a dual phenomenon. The first signalizes the death
pangs of an order, effete and godless, that has stubbornly
refused, despite the signs and portents of a century-old Reve-
lation, to attune its processes to the precepts and ideals which
that Heaven-sent Faith proffered it. The second proclaims the
birth pangs of an Order, divine and redemptive, that will
inevitably supplant the former, and within Whose administrative
structure an embryonic civilization, incomparable and world-
embracing, is imperceptibly maturing. The one is being rolled
up, and is crashing in oppression, bloodshed, and ruin. The
other opens up vistas of a justice, a unity, a peace, a culture,
such as no age has ever seen. The former has spent its force,
demonstrated its falsity and barrenness, lost irretrievably its
opportunity, and is hurrying to its doom. The latter, virile and
unconquerable, is plucking asunder its chains, and is vindicating
its title to be the one refuge within which a sore-tried humanity,
purged from its dross, can attain its destiny’ (PDC 27).

The document charts the history and evolution of the Bahá’í
Faith, and describes in detail the lives of the Báb and
Bahá’u’lláh. In surveying the nature of ‘the international scene’
(PDC 25) in the context of the early stages of Bahá’í history,
Shoghi Effendi also provides a detailed description of the
persecution and opposition that early believers faced in
nineteenth-century Iran.

A series of messages of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh are also
included in the text. They were originally addressed to those
despotic monarchs who were largely responsible for the wrongs
of society, and who were ‘glorying in the pomp and pageantry of
a kingship as yet scarcely restricted by constitutional limitations,

or entrenched within the strongholds of a seemingly inviolable
ecclesiastical power’ (PDC 30). The Guardian presents both a
comprehensive account of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh’s letters to
the sovereigns of the world, and an assessment of the degree of
success and consequences of those appeals in gaining support for
the nascent Faith. Some rulers, for example, brushed aside the
messages disdainfully. Others subjected individual adherents to
unthinkably cruel treatment. Shoghi Effendi describes how these
monarchs precipitated the crumbling of their respective dynasties
by failing to answer Bahá’u’lláh’s claim. One by one, he ex-
plains in impressive detail and in characteristically evocative
terms, how, when and why these autocratic regimes in both the
East and the West ultimately fell.

Shoghi Effendi was, however, wary that the teachings of
Bahá’u’lláh be misconstrued as being disparaging to the notion
of kingship and monarchy. On the contrary, the Guardian re-
minds Bahá’ís that ‘the principle of kingship is eulogized, the
rank and conduct of just and fair-minded kings is extolled, the
rise of monarchs, ruling with justice and even professing His
Faith, is envisaged, and the solemn duty to arise and ensure the
triumph of Bahá’í sovereigns is inculcated’ (PDC 117).

Shoghi Effendi draws a further parallel between the decay
of monarchical institutions and the declining influence of the
world’s spiritual leaders, and offers an extensive overview of
the various passages Bahá’u’lláh addressed collectively to those
leaders. The heads of the ecclesiastical orders, particularly in the
Muslim world, were the first who ‘hoisted the standard of revolt’
and ‘inflamed the ignorant and subservient masses against [the
Faith]’ (PDC 122). As with the monarchy, the Guardian revealed
that the ‘calamities that afflicted’ these ecclesiastical hierarchies
– Christian and Muslim alike – were foretold by Bahá’u’lláh’s
message (PDC 164).

> This great retributive calamity, for which the world’s su-
> preme leaders, both secular and religious, are to be regarded

\[178\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

> as primarily answerable, as testified by Bahá’u’lláh, should
> not, if we would correctly appraise it, be regarded solely as a
> punishment meted out by God to a world that has, for a
> hundred years, persisted in its refusal to embrace the truth of
> the redemptive Message proffered to it by the supreme
> Messenger of God in this day. It should be viewed also,
> though to a lesser degree, in the light of a divine retribution
> for the perversity of the human race in general, in casting
> itself adrift from those elementary principles which must, at
> all times, govern, and can alone safeguard, the life and
> progress of mankind. Humanity has, alas, with increasing
> insistence, preferred, instead of acknowledging and adoring
> the Spirit of God as embodied in His religion in this day, to
> worship those false idols, untruths and half-truths, which are
> obscuring its religions, corrupting its spiritual life, con-
> vulsing its political institutions, corroding its social fabric,
> and shattering its economic structure. (PDC 183–4)

In concluding, Shoghi Effendi emphasizes that it was not
Bahá’u’lláh’s intention to dismiss or belittle the teachings of
other Dispensations, but simply to impress upon His followers
the principle of the progressiveness and continuity of Divine
Revelation, and to convey the idea that these seemingly disparate
Revelations were, in fact, united by a shared purpose and by the
commonality of the fundamental values that they enshrine.

‘The world is, in truth, moving on towards its destiny’,
Shoghi Effendi explains. ‘The interdependence of the peoples
and nations of the earth, whatever the leaders of the divisive
forces of the world may say or do, is already an accomplished
fact. Its unity in the economic sphere is now understood and
recognized. The welfare of the part means the welfare of the
whole, and the distress of the part brings distress to the whole
. . . The fires lit by this great ordeal are the consequences of
men’s failure to recognize [the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh]’ (PDC
200–1).

A few further quotations from the book follow below:

> A tempest, unprecedented in its violence, unpredictable in its
> course, catastrophic in its immediate effects, unimaginably
> glorious in its ultimate consequences, is at present sweeping
> the face of the earth. Its driving power is remorselessly gain-
> ing in range and momentum. Its cleansing force, however
> much undetected, is increasing with every passing day.
> Humanity, gripped in the clutches of its devastating power, is
> smitten by the evidences of its resistless fury. It can neither
> perceive its origin, nor probe its significance, nor discern its
> outcome. Bewildered, agonized and helpless, it watches this
> great and mighty wind of God invading the remotest and
> fairest regions of the earth, rocking its foundations, derang-
> ing its equilibrium, sundering its nations, disrupting the
> homes of its peoples, wasting its cities, driving into exile its
> kings, pulling down its bulwarks, uprooting its institutions,
> dimming its light, and harrowing up the souls of its
> inhabitants. (PDC 1)

> Who is the ruler, may it not be confidently asked, whether of
> the East or of the West, who, at any time since the dawn of so
> transcendent a Revelation, has been prompted to raise his
> voice either in its praise or against those who persecuted it?
> Which people has, in the course of so long a captivity, felt
> urged to arise and stem the tide of such tribulations? Who is
> the sovereign, excepting a single woman, shining in solitary
> glory, who has, in however small a measure, felt impelled to

> the great ones of the earth was inclined to extend this infant
> Faith of God the benefit of his recognition or support? Which
> one of the multitudes of creeds, sects, races, parties and
> classes and of the highly diversified schools of human

\[180\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

the rising light of the Faith, to contemplate its unfolding
system, to ponder its hidden processes, to appraise its
weighty message, to acknowledge its regenerative power, to
embrace its salutary truth, or to proclaim its eternal verities?
Who among the worldly wise and the so-called men of insight
and wisdom can justly claim, after the lapse of nearly a cen-
tury, to have disinterestedly approached its theme, to have
considered impartially its claims, to have taken sufficient
pains to delve into its literature, to have assiduously striven
to separate facts from fiction, or to have accorded its cause
the treatment it merits? Where are the preeminent exponents,
whether of the arts or sciences, with the exception of a few
isolated cases, who have lifted a finger, or whispered a word
of commendation, in either the defense or the praise of a
Faith that has conferred upon the world so priceless a bene-
fit, that has suffered so long and so grievously, and which
enshrines within its shell so enthralling a promise for a world
so woefully battered, so manifestly bankrupt? (PDC 20–1)

God . . . does not only punish the wrongdoings of His
children. He chastises because He is just, and He chastens
because He loves. Having chastened them, He cannot, in His
great mercy, leave them to their fate. Indeed, by the very act
of chastening them He prepares them for the mission for
which He has created them . . .

God’s purpose is none other than to usher in, in ways He
alone can bring about, and the full significance of which He
alone can fathom, the Great, the Golden Age of a long-
divided, a long-afflicted humanity. Its present state, indeed
even its immediate future, is dark, distressingly dark. Its
distant future, however, is radiant, gloriously radiant – so
radiant that no eye can visualize it. (PDC 189–90)

Then [with the emergence of Bahá’u’lláh’s New World
Order] will the coming of age of the entire human race be

> proclaimed and celebrated by all the peoples and nations of
> the earth. Then will the banner of the Most Great Peace be
> hoisted. Then will the worldwide sovereignty of Bahá’u’lláh
> – the Establisher of the Kingdom of the Father foretold by
> the Son, and anticipated by the Prophets of God before Him
> and after Him – be recognized, acclaimed, and firmly estab-
> lished. Then will a world civilization be born, flourish, and
> perpetuate itself, a civilization with a fullness of life such as
> the world has never seen nor can as yet conceive. Then will
> the Everlasting Covenant be fulfilled in its completeness.
> Then will the promise enshrined in all the Books of God be
> redeemed, and all the prophecies uttered by the Prophets of
> old come to pass, and the vision of seers and poets be
> realized. Then will the planet, galvanized through the
> universal belief of its dwellers in one God, and their
> allegiance to one common Revelation, mirror, within the
> limitations imposed upon it, the effulgent glories of the
> sovereignty of Bahá’u’lláh, shining in the plenitude of its
> splendor in the Abhá Paradise, and be made the footstool of
> His Throne on high, and acclaimed as the earthly heaven,
> capable of fulfilling that ineffable destiny fixed for it, from
time immemorial, by the love and wisdom of its Creator.

Not ours, puny mortals that we are, to attempt, at so
> critical a stage in the long and checkered history of mankind,
> to arrive at a precise and satisfactory understanding of the
> steps which must successively lead a bleeding humanity,
> wretchedly oblivious of its God, and careless of Bahá’u’lláh,
> from its calvary to its ultimate resurrection. Not ours, the
> living witnesses of the all-subduing potency of His Faith, to

> the hammer of His Will, and through the fire of tribulation,
> upon the anvil of this travailing age, and in the particular

> to the loftiest summits of power and glory. (PDC 202–4)

L. Citadel of Faith

This 158-page compilation of messages addressed to the
National Spiritual Assembly of the United States was first
published after the Guardian’s death, in 1965. It includes 121
messages, some as letters, and others in cable form, sent over a
period of 10 years between 1947 and 1957. Thirty-nine are
cables sent on the occasion of the passing of outstanding
believers. Apart from these specific communications, the bulk of
Shoghi Effendi’s messages deal with the duties and respon-
sibilities facing the community of the Great Republic of the
West. The preface summarizes the content of the volume as a
description, in ‘challenging terms’, of the world mission of the
American Bahá’ís, ‘reminding them of their spiritual primacy as
the trustees and executors of the Divine Plan of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
and reinforcing that primacy with the mysterious power of
accomplishment inherent in his words of encouragement and
exhortation’ (CF v).

The longest letter is 34 pages in length, and was separately
published under the title of The Challenging Requirements of the
Present Hour. Six others are from 8 to 12 pages long. In these
messages Shoghi Effendi explains in great detail the needs and
challenges of the second Seven Year Plan, sees a parallel
between the processes propelling the American Bahá’í com-

munity and the American Republic itself, draws the attention of
the friends to the inevitability of tribulations, crises and trials,
impresses upon the friends the importance of supporting the
international and national funds, reminds them of the promises of
divine blessings as stated in the utterances of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
appeals to them to scale nobler heights of heroism, and finally
advises them to have a period of austerity, curtailing some of
their activities in order to divert contributions to the Temple
Fund. In this volume we read about the significance of the Shrine
of the Báb and the construction of its superstructure, and learn of
the disaffection of members of Shoghi Effendi’s family and their
passing out from under the shadow of the Cause. Emphasis is
laid on the continuous extension of the teaching work, the need
of Europe for a flow of devoted pioneers, and on the urgency of
supporting the teaching undertakings in Africa, while the friends
are reminded that priority should be given to the announced
goals and objectives of the Ten Year Crusade.

The Guardian underlines the fact that the American Bahá’í
community will face perils, trials and crises stemming from such
internal issues as racial prejudice, as well as conflicts on the
world scene. He relates the premeditated campaign of per-
secution against the Persian Bahá’ís, and portrays it as a blessing
in disguise, aiding the proclamation of the Faith worldwide. In
these pages we also read about the irreplaceable contribution of
the individual believer, and the need for personal consecration
and dedication to the pressing tasks facing the community.
Shoghi Effendi assures the friends that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ‘watchful
care and unfailing grace [will] continue to sustain them,
individually and collectively’ (CF 158).

Some more quotations from this important compilation are
included below:

> A continent [Europe], twice blessed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s suc-
> cessive visits to its shores, and the scene of His first public
> appearance in the West; which has been the cradle of a

\[184\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

civilization to some of whose beneficent features the pen of
Bahá’u’lláh has paid significant tribute; on whose soil both
the Greek and Roman civilizations were born and flourished;
which has contributed so richly to the unfoldment of
American civilization; the fountainhead of American culture;
the mother of Christendom, and the scene of the greatest
exploits of the followers of Jesus Christ; in some of whose
outlying territories have been won some of the most
resplendent victories which ushered in the Golden Age of
Islám; which sustained, in its very heart, the violent impact of
the onrushing hosts of that Faith, intent on the subjugation of
its cities, but which refused to bend the knee to its invaders,
and succeeded in the end in repulsing their assault – such a
continent is now experiencing, at the hands of the little as yet
unnoticed band of pioneers sent forth by the enviable, the
privileged, the dynamic American Bahá’í Community, the
first stirrings of that spiritual revolution which must
culminate, in the Golden Age that is as yet unborn, in the
permanent establishment of Bahá’u’lláh’s Order throughout
that continent. (CF 26–7)

Indeed if we would read aright the signs of the times, and
appraise correctly the significances of contemporaneous
events that are impelling forward both the American Bahá’í
Community and the nation of which it forms a part on the
road leading them to their ultimate destiny, we cannot fail to
perceive the workings of two simultaneous processes,
generated as far back as the concluding years of the Heroic
Age of our Faith, each clearly defined, each distinctly
separate, yet closely related and destined to culminate, in the
fullness of time, in a single glorious consummation.

One of these processes is associated with the mission of
the American Bahá’í Community, the other with the destiny
of the American nation. The one serves directly the interests
of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, the

> other promotes indirectly the institutions that are to be
> associated with the establishment of His World Order. The
> first process dates back to the revelation of those stupendous
> Tablets constituting the Charter of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine
> Plan. It was held in abeyance for well-nigh twenty years
> while the fabric of an indispensable Administrative Order,
> designed as a divinely appointed agency for the operation of
> that Plan, was being constructed. It registered its initial
> success with the triumphant conclusion of the first stage of its
> operation in the republics of the Western Hemisphere. It
> signalized the opening of the second phase of its development
> through the inauguration of the present teaching campaign in
> the European continent. It must pass into the third stage of its
> evolution with the initiation of the third Seven Year Plan,
> designed to culminate in the establishment of the structure of
> the Administrative Order in all the remaining sovereign
> states and chief dependencies of the globe. It must reach the
> end of the first epoch in its evolution with the fulfilment of the
> prophecy mentioned by Daniel in the last chapter of His
> Book, related to the year 1335, and associated by ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá with the world triumph of the Faith of His Father. It
> will be consummated through the emergence of the Bahá’í
> World Commonwealth in the Golden Age of the Bahá’í
Dispensation.

The other process dates back to the outbreak of the First
> World War that threw the great republic of the West into the
> vortex of the first stage of a world upheaval. It received its
> initial impetus through the formulation of President Wilson’s
> Fourteen Points, closely associating for the first time that
> republic with the fortunes of the Old World. It suffered its
> first setback through the dissociation of that republic from
> the newly born League of Nations which that president had
> labored to create. It acquired added momentum through the
> outbreak of the second World War, inflicting unprecedented
> suffering on that republic, and involving it still further in the

\[186\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

affairs of all the continents of the globe. It was further
reinforced through the declaration embodied in the Atlantic
Charter, as voiced by one of its chief progenitors, Franklin
D. Roosevelt. It assumed a definite outline through the birth
of the United Nations at the San Francisco Conference. It
acquired added significance through the choice of the City of
the Covenant itself as the seat of the newly born organiz-
ation, through the declaration recently made by the
American president related to his country’s commitments in
Greece and Turkey, as well as through the submission to the
General Assembly of the United Nations of the thorny and
challenging problem of the Holy Land, the spiritual as well
as the administrative center of the World Faith of Bahá-
’u’lláh. It must, however long and tortuous the way, lead,
through a series of victories and reverses, to the political
unification of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, to the
emergence of a world government and the establishment of
the Lesser Peace, as foretold by Bahá’u’lláh and
foreshadowed by the Prophet Isaiah. It must, in the end,
culminate in the unfurling of the banner of the Most Great
Peace, in the Golden Age of the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh.
(CF 31–3)

The champion builders of Bahá’u’lláh’s rising World Order
must scale nobler heights of heroism as humanity plunges
into greater depths of despair, degradation, dissension and
distress. Let them forge ahead into the future serenely
confident that the hour of their mightiest exertions and the
supreme opportunity for their greatest exploits must coincide
with the apocalyptic upheaval marking the lowest ebb in
mankind’s fast-declining fortunes. (CF 58)

As the threat of still more violent convulsions assailing a
travailing age increases, and the wings of yet another
conflict, destined to contribute a distinct, and perhaps a

> decisive, share to the birth of the new Order which must
> signalize the advent of the Lesser Peace, darken the
> international horizon, the eyes of the divers communities,
> comprising the body of the organized followers of
> Bahá’u’lláh throughout the Eastern Hemisphere, are being
> increasingly fixed upon the progressive unfoldment of the
> tasks which the executors of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Mandate have
> been summoned to undertake in the course of the second
> stage of their world-girdling mission. (CF 58)

> [N]othing short of the vitalizing influx of new blood [winning
> fresh recruits to the Faith] . . . can safeguard the prizes
[already won] . . .

This flow, moreover, will presage and hasten the advent
> of the day which, as prophesied by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, will
> witness the entry by troops of peoples of divers nations and
> races into the Bahá’í world – a day which, viewed in its
> proper perspective, will be the prelude to that long-awaited
> hour when a mass conversion on the part of these same
> nations and races, and as a direct result of a chain of events,
> momentous and possibly catastrophic in nature, and which
> cannot as yet be even dimly visualized, will suddenly revo-
> lutionize the fortunes of the Faith, derange the equilibrium of
> the world, and reinforce a thousandfold the numerical
> strength as well as the material power and the spiritual
> authority of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. (CF 117)

> The steady and alarming deterioration in the standard of
> morality as exemplified by the appalling increase of crime,
> by political corruption in ever widening and ever higher
> circles, by the loosening of the sacred ties of marriage, by the
> inordinate craving for pleasure and diversion, and by the
> marked and progressive slackening of parental control, is no
> doubt the most arresting and distressing aspect of the decline

\[188\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

that has set in, and can be clearly perceived, in the fortunes
of the entire nation. (CF 124)

Parallel with this, and pervading all departments of life – an
evil which the nation, and indeed all those within the
capitalist system, though to a lesser degree, share with that
state and its satellites regarded as the sworn enemies of that
system – is the crass materialism, which lays excessive and
ever-increasing emphasis on material well-being, forgetful of
those things of the spirit on which alone a sure and stable
foundation can be laid for human society. It is this same
cancerous materialism, born originally in Europe, carried to
excess in the North American continent, contaminating the
Asiatic peoples and nations, spreading its ominous tentacles
to the borders of Africa, and now invading its very heart,
which Bahá’u’lláh in unequivocal and emphatic language
denounced in His Writings, comparing it to a devouring
flame and regarding it as the chief factor in precipitating the
dire ordeals and world-shaking crises that must necessarily
involve the burning of cities and the spread of terror and
consternation in the hearts of men. Indeed a foretaste of the
devastation which this consuming fire will wreak upon the
world, and with which it will lay waste the cities of the
nations participating in this tragic world-engulfing contest,
has been afforded by the last World War, marking the second
stage in the global havoc which humanity, forgetful of its
God and heedless of the clear warnings uttered by His
appointed Messenger for this day, must, alas, inevitably
experience. It is this same all-pervasive, pernicious material-
ism against which the voice of the Center of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Covenant was raised, with pathetic persistence, from plat-
form and pulpit, in His addresses to the heedless multitudes,
which, on the morrow of His fateful visit to both Europe and
America, found themselves suddenly swept into the vortex of

> a tempest which in its range and severity was unsurpassed in
> the world’s history. (CF 124–5)

> No less serious is the stress and strain imposed on the fabric
> of American society through the fundamental and persistent
> neglect, by the governed and governors alike, of the supreme,
> the inescapable and urgent duty – so repeatedly and
> graphically represented and stressed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His
> arraignment of the basic weaknesses in the social fabric of
> the nation – of remedying, while there is yet time, through a
> revolutionary change in the concept and attitude of the
> average white American toward his Negro fellow citizen, a
> situation which, if allowed to drift, will, in the words of
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, cause the streets of American cities to run
> with blood, aggravating thereby the havoc which the fearful
> weapons of destruction, raining from the air, and amassed by
> a ruthless, a vigilant, a powerful and inveterate enemy, will
> wreak upon those same cities. (CF 126)

> This challenge [the requirements of the Ten Year Plan], so
> severe and insistent, and yet so glorious, faces no doubt
> primarily the individual believer on whom, in the last resort,
> depends the fate of the entire community. He it is who
> constitutes the warp and woof on which the quality and
> pattern of the whole fabric must depend. He it is who acts as
> one of the countless links in the mighty chain that now
> girdles the globe. He it is who serves as one of the multitude
> of bricks which support the structure and insure the stability
> of the administrative edifice now being raised in every part of
> the world. Without his support, at once whole-hearted,
> continuous and generous, every measure adopted, and every
> plan formulated, by the body which acts as the national
> representative of the community to which he belongs, is
> foredoomed to failure. The World Center of the Faith itself is

> Himself is impeded in His purpose if the proper instruments
> for the execution of His design are lacking. The sustaining
> strength of Bahá’u’lláh Himself, the Founder of the Faith,

M. Messages to the Bahá’í World (1950–1957)

This 175-page compilation contains 82 messages of the beloved
Guardian from 25 April 1950 till October 1957. The volume is
divided into two parts. From page 131 onwards, additional
messages have been included under the title ‘Supplementary
Collection’. Shoghi Effendi started his practice of sending one
major message to all the Bahá’í Conventions in April 1950. The
longer messages were sent after the inauguration of the Ten Year
Crusade in 1953, and progressed incrementally in length, from 7
pages in April 1954 to 19 pages in April 1957. At times he would
send a further brief message to some National Assemblies for
their Conventions, if he felt the need to bring certain specific
points to their attention in the areas under their jurisdiction.

A list of major subjects covered in these messages to the
Bahá’í world follows:

> •   Formation of the first International Bahá’í Council
•   Inception of the institution of the Hands of the Cause, in

> accordance with the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá, through the appointment of several contingents
> •   Acquisition of property on Mount Carmel and in Bahjí
> •   Review of the world progress of the Faith
•   Preparing the international Bahá’í community for a

> world-encircling plan, and the subsequent launching of
> the Ten Year Plan
•   The inauguration of the Holy Year, October 1952–
October 1953

•   Announcement of the convocation of four inter-

continental conferences
•   Establishment of a Roll of Honour for the Knights of

Bahá’u’lláh
•   Progress reports on the construction and completion of

the Shrine of the Báb
•   The opposition of Covenant-breakers and the eventual

frustration of their efforts
•   The initiation of the construction of the International

Archives Building
•   Data regarding the plans for the construction of the

Temples in Frankfurt, Kampala and Sydney
> •   Persecution of the Bahá’ís in Persia
> •   Victories won in Africa and the Pacific
•   Announcement of another series of five intercontinental

conferences at the midway point of the Ten Year Crusade
> •   Reopening the doors of pilgrimage in May 1951
> •   Messages to the five intercontinental conferences
•   The ten parts or stages of the social and spiritual

> evolution of mankind leading to the diffusion, penetration
> and suffusion of the light and warmth of God’s Reve-
> lation in human society
•   Future opposition to the Faith.

The messages in this volume, particularly those dated during
the last years and months of Shoghi Effendi’s life, represent his
last wishes to the friends, and voice his incessant and earnest call
on them to vigilantly protect the Cause, vigorously promote its
interests, and steadfastly, unitedly and selflessly maintain the
tempo and indeed increase the momentum of their endeavours in
the path of their love for the Blessed Beauty.

A few excerpts from these soul-stirring messages are
included below:

\[192\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

No matter how long the period that separates them from
ultimate victory; however arduous the task; however for-
midable the exertions demanded of them; however dark the
days which mankind, perplexed and sorely-tried, must, in its
hour of travail, traverse; however severe the tests with which
they who are to redeem its fortunes will be confronted;
however afflictive the darts which their present enemies, as
well as those whom Providence, will, through His mysterious
dispensations raise up from within or from without, may rain
upon them, however grievous the ordeal of temporary
separation from the heart and nerve-center of their Faith
which future unforeseeable disturbances may impose upon
them, I adjure them, by the precious blood that flowed in
such great profusion, by the lives of the unnumbered saints
and heroes who were immolated, by the supreme, the
glorious sacrifice of the Prophet-Herald of our Faith, by the
tribulations which its Founder, Himself, willingly underwent,
so that His Cause might live, His Order might redeem a
shattered world and its glory might suffuse the entire planet –
I adjure them, as this solemn hour draws nigh, to resolve
never to flinch, never to hesitate, never to relax, until each
and every objective in the Plans to be proclaimed, at a later
date, has been fully consummated. (MBW 38–9)

It is indeed my fervent and constant prayer that the members
of this firmly-knit, intensely alive, world-embracing Com-
munity, spurred on by the triple impulse generated through
the revelation of the Tablet of Carmel by Bahá’u’lláh and the
Will and Testament as well as the Tablets of the Divine Plan
bequeathed by the Center of His Covenant – the three
Charters which have set in motion three distinct processes,
the first operating in the Holy Land for the development of
the institutions of the Faith at its World Center and the other
two, throughout the rest of the Bahá’í world, for its
propagation and the establishment of its Administrative

\[194\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

sooner or later, afflict a society which, for the most part, and
for over a century, has turned a deaf ear to the Voice of
God’s Messenger in this day – a calamity which must purge
the human race of the dross of its age-long corruptions, and
weld its component parts into a firmly-knit world-embracing
Fellowship – a Fellowship destined, in the fullness of time, to
be incorporated in the framework, and to be galvanized by
the spiritualizing influences, of a mysteriously expanding,
divinely appointed Order, and to flower, in the course of
future Dispensations, into a Civilization, the like of which
mankind has, at no stage in its evolution, witnessed. (MBW
This present Crusade, on the threshold of which we now
stand, will, moreover, by virtue of the dynamic forces it will
release and its wide repercussions over the entire surface of
the globe, contribute effectually to the acceleration of yet
another process of tremendous significance which will carry
the steadily evolving Faith of Bahá’u’lláh through its present
stages of obscurity, of repression, of emancipation and of
recognition – stages one or another of which Bahá’í national
communities in various parts of the world now find
themselves in – to the stage of establishment, the stage at
which the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh will be recognized by the civil
authorities as the state religion, similar to that which
Christianity entered in the years following the death of the
Emperor Constantine, a stage which must later be followed
by the emergence of the Bahá’í state itself, functioning, in all
religious and civil matters, in strict accordance with the laws
and ordinances of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the Most Holy, the
Mother-Book of the Bahá’í Revelation, a stage which, in the
fullness of time, will culminate in the establishment of the
World Bahá’í Commonwealth, functioning in the plenitude of
its powers, and which will signalize the long-awaited advent
of the Christ-promised Kingdom of God on earth – the

N. Sundry compilations of letters to divers national
communities

1\. United Kingdom

This impressive volume of messages, letters and cables of the
Guardian to the Bahá’ís of the British Isles was first published in
1981 under the title of Unfolding Destiny. The title page,
however, gives a fuller designation: The Unfolding Destiny of the
British Bahá’í Community. This compilation runs to over 430
pages of communications dating from 1922 to 1957. The letters
have been arranged in six categories in the following order:

> •   From 1922 to 1944 (the early years)
> •   From 1944 to 1950 (covering the Six Year Plan)
> •   From 1950 to 1953 (the Africa Plan)
> •   From 1953 to 1957 (the Ten Year Crusade)
> •   Letters to Local Assemblies
> •   Excerpts from letters to individuals

These messages show the deep love that Shoghi Effendi
cherished in his heart for the British Bahá’í community. It was to

\[196\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

the United Kingdom that the Master sent his beloved grandson
for study at Oxford; it was there, during his time as a student at
Oxford, that Shoghi Effendi associated with the friends as a
member of their community – the only community of which he
was a member outside the World Centre; and it was in that
selfsame country that he heard about the passing of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, and learned of his appointment as Guardian of the Bahá’í
Faith. The messages abound with praises of the sterling qualities
of the British Bahá’ís and unfold the glorious destiny lying ahead
of them.

The first collective teaching undertaking in the United King-
dom was the Six Year Plan, which was executed and completed
with singular success. It was a Plan which was characterized by
Shoghi Effendi as a ‘signal victory’, which ‘shed lustre on the
opening years of the second Bahá’í century’. The second crown
won by the British Bahá’í community during Shoghi Effendi’s
lifetime was the formulation and execution of the Two Year
Africa Plan. The Guardian singled out the British National
Assembly to be the coordinating body of four other National
Assemblies, to open countries and establish the machinery of the
administration of the Faith in lands south of the Sahara. This plan
likewise ended with resounding success.

A few quotations from this wonderful compilation follow:

> I wish to congratulate in person the English believers, and
> particularly the members of the youth group, on their
> splendid achievements. The activities they have initiated, the
> perseverance, zeal and fidelity they have increasingly
> manifested, the plans they have conceived and the obstacles
> they have already overcome, rejoice my heart and arouse
> fresh hopes and expectations within me. I will continue to
> pray for their success. Rest assured and persevere. (17

October 1936, UD 110–1)

> The marvellous zeal, unity, understanding and devotion
> exemplified by the English believers in recent months,
> individually as well as through their concentrated efforts,
> constitute a landmark in the progressive development of the

> ciously to the principles of their Faith, spiritual as well as
> administrative, and resolve to endure every sacrifice and
> hardship, however severe, for the vindication, the consolid-
> ation and recognition of the Faith they profess and are now
> so admirably serving. (27 November 1938, UD 123 )

> The various and compelling evidences of the unquenchable
> enthusiasm, the unbreakable resolution and the inflexible
> purpose of the English believers, in these days of stress, of
> turmoil and danger, have cheered my heart and fortified
> me in the discharge of my arduous and multitudinous duties

> the Beloved whose Cause they are so valiantly serving, to
> bless, sustain, guide and protect them under all circum-
> stances, and aid them to establish firmly the institutions of
> His Faith throughout the length and breadth of their country.

(7 December 1939, UD 134–5)

conservative a people, within so short a time, under such
trying circumstances, and by so small a band of workers,
except with feelings compounded of envy, of admiration and
respect. Its sister-communities throughout the East, vener-
able by reason of their age, and the sacrifices they have
made, and fully aware of the long period of incubation this
community has undergone, recall, with feelings of delight,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s prediction, forecasting the germination, at
their appointed time, of the potent seeds His loving hands
have sown in the course of His twice-repeated visit to that
Island, and marvel at the rapidity with which its soil is now
manifesting the potentialities with which it has been en-
dowed. He Who blessed it with His footsteps, Who called into
being, and fostered the growth of, the community labouring
in that Island, hails, from His station on high, the exploits
which immortalise the small band of His present-day
consecrated and resolute followers, who are carrying on the
torch which He Himself had entrusted to their immediate
predecessors. Bahá’u’lláh Himself lauds the conspicuous
victories being won in His Name, in the dawning years of the
Second Bahá’í Century, at the very heart and centre of the
greatest Empire the world has ever seen, whose Sovereign
Monarch He Himself had addressed and whose deeds He,
with His Own pen, had commended. (9 April 1949, UD 226–
On the success of this enterprise [the Africa Plan 1951–3],
unprecedented in its scope, unique in its character and
immense in its spiritual potentialities, must depend the
initiation, at a later period in the Formative Age of the Faith,
of undertakings embracing within their range all National
Assemblies functioning throughout the Bahá’í World,
undertakings constituting in themselves a prelude to the
launching of world-wide enterprises destined to be embarked
upon, in future epochs of that same Age, by the Universal

> House of Justice, that will symbolise the unity and coordinate
and unify the activities of these National Assemblies.

Indeed the birth of this African enterprise, in the opening
> decade of the second Bahá’í century, coinciding as it does
> with the formation of the International Bahá’í Council,
> should be acclaimed as an event of peculiar significance in
> the evolution of our beloved Faith. Both events will, no
> doubt, be hailed by posterity as simultaneous and compelling
> evidences of the irresistible unfoldment of a divinely
> appointed Administrative Order and of the development, on
> an international scale, of its subsidiary agencies, heralding
> the establishment of the Supreme Legislative Body designed
> to crown the Administrative Edifice now being laboriously
> erected by the privileged builders of a Divine Order, whose
> features have been delineated by the Centre of the Covenant
> in His Will and Testament, whose fundamental laws have
> been revealed by the Founder of our Faith in His Kitáb-i-
> Aqdas, and Whose advent has been foreshadowed by the
> Herald of the Bahá’í Dispensation in the Bayán, His most
> weighty Book. (25 February 1951,UD 261)

> That they may ascend from height to height, go forward from
> victory to victory, is the fervent prayer of one who has
> invariably followed the course of their exploits with undim-
> inished confidence and admiration, who has cherished the
> brightest hopes for the ultimate attainment of their Mission,
> and whose love and esteem for them has correspondingly
> increased with every revelation of the capacities and

2\. Indian subcontinent

A compilation of the letters of Shoghi Effendi to the Indian
subcontinent was published in 1970 under the title of Dawn of a
New Day. It was revised and enlarged in 1995. The new edition
carries the title of Messages of Shoghi Effendi to the Indian
Subcontinent and consists of 580 letters and cables of the
Guardian to the Indian, Pakistani and Burmese Bahá’í
communities. These messages cover some 430 pages.

The Indian subcontinent was opened to the Faith during the
lifetime of Bahá’u’lláh, when He sent a well-known Persian
Bahá’í scholar, Jamál Effendi, to teach the Cause in India and
Burma. It is of interest that one of the Báb’s Letters of the Living
was also Indian in origin. During the Ministry of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
the Master showered the Bahá’ís in these lands with His all-
embracing love, and must have sent the friends over 700 Tablets.
Compared with other communities in the world, apart from
Persia, it may be said that by the time Shoghi Effendi assumed
the Headship of the Faith in 1921, one of its strongholds was the
Indian subcontinent.

The extracts which follow from Shoghi Effendi’s letters
clearly show the degree of joy and pride that he took in the

Indian Bahá’í community, and detail the responsibilities he laid
upon them for the future expansion of the Faith.

> You should concentrate your efforts at the present time on
> whatever will, in your opinion reinforce the basis, and extend
> the influence, of the administrative institutions and the
> teaching activities of the Faith. The Cause will, no doubt,
> surmount the obstacles that now hinder its growth, and will
> establish its ascendency in the fulness of time and at the
> appointed hour. We should persevere and never feel dis-
> heartened. (2 January 1934, MSI 109)

> The friends in India and Burma have made a splendid start.
> They have laid a firm foundation within the framework of the
> administrative order of our Faith. They have weathered
> manifold and distressing difficulties and successfully sur-
> mounted formidable obstacles. A new era is opening before
> them. I have no doubt that they will rise to the height of the
> occasion, and will prove themselves worthy of their high
> destiny. (22 November 1935, MSI 136)

> The progress of the teaching activities initiated by your
> Assembly is highly gratifying. Inflexible determination is
> required to carry it to a successful conclusion. The methods
> adopted by the American Bahá’í community, the zeal, the
> initiative, the efficiency, the fidelity with which they are
> prosecuting their enterprise should be exemplified by indi-
> viduals and Assemblies in India and Burma. The adminis-
> trative machinery which the American believers have erected
> and perfected has already had its counterpart in the
> institutions you have so nobly reared in recent years. Your
> teaching campaign, the supreme purpose for which this
> machinery has been fashioned, should likewise be modelled
> according to the plan which your sister community has

\[202\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

devised and is now developing so strenuously and
successfully. (7 November 1936, MSI 150)

I am delighted to learn of the work which is being steadily
and efficiently accomplished in so many spheres of Bahá’í
activity throughout India and Burma. My heart is filled with
gratitude as I witness the progress you have achieved, the
enterprises you have initiated, the method and measures you
have adopted, the plans you have conceived, and above all,
the spirit of exemplary loyalty and magnificent devotion that
impels you forward in the great mission you are destined to
fulfil. (28 February 1937, MSI 156)

Let them remember that a firm resolution on their part, an
absolute re-dedication of their resources, and an actual
attempt to translate into action their meritorious intentions,
coupled with perseverance in the discharge of their duties,
would suffice to ensure the success of the mission to which
they are now committed. The time is indeed ripe, and the
minds and hearts of the suffering multitudes are being
mysteriously prepared for the Great Message that can alone
redeem, exalt and regenerate a sore tried and bewildered
humanity. I will specially and fervently pray for the suc-
cess of any and every effort the dearly beloved friends in
India and Burma may arise to exert. (28 November 1940,
MSI 191–2)

The vastness of the field, the smallness of your numbers, the
indifference of the masses, must neither discourage nor appal
you. You should at all times fix your gaze on the promise of
Bahá’u’lláh, put your whole trust in His creative Word, re-
call the past and manifold evidences of His all-encompassing
and resistless power, and arise to become worthy and
exemplary recipients of His all-sustaining grace and
blessings. I appeal to every Indian and Burmese believer,

> however modest his position, however limited his knowledge,
> however restricted his means, to rise to the height of this
> great opportunity which if missed will not recur again. To
> disperse, to settle, to teach by word and deed, to persevere
> and sacrifice are the requirements of the present hour (29

June 1941, MSI 203).

> The manner in which the friends have arisen to promote
> the teaching work throughout their country merits the high-
> est praise. By their enthusiasm, their self-abnegation, the
> determination and vigour they display, they have lent a fresh
> impetus to the onward march of the Faith and the expan-
> sion of its institutions and the multiplication of its admin-
> istrative centres. The perils of the present hour, the reper-
> cussions of this tremendous world ordeal on their native
> land, must, in no wise, alarm or discourage them. Their
> purpose must never be deflected, their enthusiasm never
> dimmed, their vision never obscured, their exertions never
> discontinued. Adversity prepares the hearts of men, and
> paves the way for a wholehearted and general acceptance
> of the tenets and claims of our beloved Faith. Challenged
> by the obstacles in their path, encouraged by work already
> initiated, assured of the Divine Promise of Bahá’u’lláh, let
> them forge ahead until their goal is attained. (27 December
> 1941, MSI 211)

> Perseverance is the magnet that will, in these days, attract
> the promised blessings of the almighty Author of our beloved
> Faith. Unity and harmony constitute the basis on which the
> structure of these activities can securely rest. Self-sacrifice,
> audacity, undeviating adherence to the essentials of that
> Faith, will reinforce that structure and accelerate its rise.
> That the dear friends in India are increasingly demonstrating

satisfaction to me, and I will continue to supplicate our
Beloved to guide their steps, cheer their hearts, illumine
their understanding, and fulfil their highest and noblest
aspirations. He indeed is well-pleased with the record
of their past services, and will, if they redouble their
efforts, enable them to achieve a signal victory. (27 June
1942, MSI 220)

The call is urgent, the opportunities priceless, the need of the
waiting masses desperate, the machinery for the execution of
the Divine Purpose already erected and vigorously
functioning, the promise of signal victory clear and definite.
A higher degree of administrative efficiency; a closer
collaboration between the various elements constituting the
organic Bahá’í community; a greater measure of self-
sacrifice; a still more intensified exertion aiming at the
consolidation and preservation of the newly constituted
Assemblies and the rapid conversion of the existing groups
into full-fledged Assemblies; a systematic, sustained and
nation-wide endeavour for the purpose of disseminating the
literature of the Faith, increasing its volume and adding to
its diversity, and lastly a more audacious and convincing
presentation of its tenets to the masses of the people, these
constitute the primary tasks facing now the Indian believers.
(20 December 1944, MSI 254)

The hour is indeed propitious. The ordeals and tribulations
which the hungry, the dispossessed, the sick, as well as the
disillusioned and restless multitudes, are now experiencing,
offer the bearers of the Message of the Most Great Name, an
opportunity which may never again recur. There is no time to
lose. Every warrior in the ever-advancing army of Bahá-
’u’lláh must arise and participate in this holy crusade. The
rewards and prizes to be won are inestimable. However
circumscribed its resources, however small its numbers,

> however formidable the obstacles with which it is confronted,
> the entire community of the believers in India, Burma, and
> Pakistan, must arise as one man, and, pledging anew its
> fidelity to its Faith, prove itself fully worthy of the Cause it
> has espoused and the high mission it has undertaken. (24

October 1947, MSI 289)

> The Asiatic continent, the cradle of the principal religions of

3\. Germany and Austria

The National Spiritual Assembly of Germany published two
compilations, in 1982 and 1985 respectively, of letters of the
beloved Guardian to Bahá’í communities and to individual
believers in Germany and Austria. The first volume is in two
parts, from 1922 to 1939, when the Second World War broke
out, and from November 1945 to the end of Shoghi Effendi’s
ministry. A similar pattern is found in volume two of the com-
pilations. The reason for the gap from 1939 to 1945 is, of course,
due to the fact that the Nazi regime had officially banned the
Bahá’í Faith in both Germany and Austria, and all communi-
cations with the World Centre were cut off.

During the last 12 years of his ministry, Shoghi Effendi not
only inspired the scattered Bahá’ís in Germany to resume their
Bahá’í activities, but enabled them to re-form their National
Spiritual Assembly, embark on a teaching plan, and finally
become one of the twelve ‘generals’ of the Ten Year Crusade.
Two of the messages he sent were each nine pages long,
addressed to the National Assembly, and were written during the
Ten Year Plan. Letters to individual believers were shorter and
mostly consisted of encouragement to them in their teaching and
administrative endeavours.

Extracts from these compilations follow below:

> The time is sure to come and the signs are already apparent,
> when the various and distant members of this great world
> community will find their activities co-ordinated, their pur-
> pose unified, their efforts re-inforced and the effect of their
> combined efforts manifest throughout the world. May the
> Power of Bahá’u’lláh breathe the dynamic spirit of Life into
> the combined and systematized efforts of the friends the
> world over and revive through them the body of stricken

> humanity and give it the peace which it yearns for and which
> the world cannot give. (19 January 1923, LDG Vol. 1, 11–2)

> Why fear and sorrow? Have we not the express promise of
> the Master, uttered after the termination of the Great War,
> that Germany, now humbled and weakened, will no doubt be
> freed from its fetters and will develop, materially and
> spiritually, and shall one day emerge from this sad turmoil
> strong, united and prosperous, ready to take her place in the
> great Family of the advanced nations of the world? (16

February 1923, LDG Vol. 1, 12–13)

> Let us then take heart, and endeavour to deepen in spirit, to
> reinforce our numbers, so that, however depressing and
> distracting the conditions around us may be, we may per-
> severe, with clear vision, steadfast hope, and united effort to
> achieve the triumph of the Bahá’í Revelation throughout the
world.

I am eagerly awaiting the news you may wish to send me,
> for I thirst after the glad tidings of the progress of the Cause
> in your mighty and promising land. (31 December 1923,
> LDG Vol. 1, 18)

> I wish to add a few words in person and assure you of my
> keen and heartfelt appreciation of your high and painstaking
> endeavours for the spread and consolidation of the Faith in
> that land. The German believers have undergone tests of
> unprecedented severity. They have weathered the storm in a
> marvellous spirit and with fine and praiseworthy deter-
> mination. These tests were God-sent, and will serve to
> deepen the roots of the Faith in that promising country. (24

February 1932, LDG Vol. 1, 40–1)

> My heart rejoiced and my soul was refreshed at the receipt
> of your most welcome message, signed by so great a number

of ardent and youthful co-workers in a land so rich in
promise, so blessed by our Beloved, and so severely tried
by the vicissitudes of war. You are, I assure you, often in my
thoughts and prayers, and I cherish the brightest hopes for
your future work. You are, I feel confident, destined to
achieve memorable victories, both in your native land and
on the continent of Europe, and you should diligently
and unitedly prepare yourselves for this glorious task.
Persevere, redouble your efforts, and rest assured that the
Beloved will bless and sustain you always. (4 May 1946,
LDG Vol. 1, 106)

The immediate past, with all its confused issues and
unpleasant memories must be entirely forgotten, if the task
that lies ahead is to be efficiently prosecuted. Personal
animosities, suspicions, accusations, wounded pride, contro-
versial issues must all be laid aside. Members of assemblies,
national and local, must be the first to set a worthy example
to their fellow-believers. All thought and discussion must
henceforth centre around the measures required to stimulate
the growth of the Faith, to deepen and enrich the spiritual
life of its members, to familiarize them more intimately with
the character and workings of the Administrative Order, and
enable them to participate more actively in the prosecution of
the Plan to which they are committed. (30 June 1949, LDG
Vol. 1, 155–6)

I appeal to them, with all my heart, to close their ranks,
purge their hearts, broaden their vision, renew their deter-
mination, rededicate themselves to their glorious task, march
resolutely forward along the road traced for them by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, beat down every barrier obstructing their
path, and press on, confidently, unitedly and uncompromis-
ingly, until their goal is attained, and the first stage in the

> evolution of their collective task is brought to a victorious
> conclusion. (30 June 1949, LDG Vol. 1, 156)

> Time is running out. The work they [the German and Austrian
> Bahá’í communities] have to accomplish is immense,
> exacting, thrilling and inescapable. The hosts of the

> them a resounding victory, if they but keep their vision
> undimmed, if they refuse to faint or falter, if they persevere
> and remain faithful to both the spiritual and the
> administrative principles inculcated by their Faith. (30 May
> 1952, LDG Vol. 1, 186)

4\. Australasia

During the Ministry of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in response to the Tablets
of the Divine Plan, John Henry and Clara Hyde Dunn, Bahá’ís
residing in the United States, arrived in Australia, on 18 April
1920\. Three years later the first Bahá’í Local Assembly was
formed in Melbourne, Victoria under the tutelage of the beloved
Guardian. The National Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Australia
and New Zealand was formed in 1934, and in 1956 New Zealand

\[210\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

was able to establish its own independent National Assembly.
The collection of letters of Shoghi Effendi published in 1970
consists of 82 messages, all of which carried guidance,
encouragement, wise counsel, and assurance of prayers for the
growth of the community in these two significant outposts in the
Antipodes.

Extracts from these messages are included below:

> The detailed report of the activities of the national assembly
> – the furthermost pillar of the Universal House of Justice
> which the high endeavours of the believers of Australia and
> New-Zealand have reared – has filled my heart and soul with
> immense joy and gratitude. The Beloved is surely watching
> over and continually blessing your splendid accomplish-
> ments, the plans you have conceived, the methods you have
> devised, the efforts you are exerting, the services which you
> have rendered. I will continue to pray for the consolidation
> and uninterrupted expansion of your laudable activities in
> the service of so glorious and mighty a Cause. Never relax
> nor despair. The tender plant which your hands have raised
> and nurtured shall grow and will ultimately gather beneath
> its shadow the whole of that far-off and promising continent.

(26 September 1935, LAN 11)

> Effective measures, unprecedented in scope, should be care-
> fully and immediately devised, proclaimed to the believers,
> and, through sustained and organised effort, carried into
> effect. There is no time to lose. The masses, greatly tried by
> the calamities of the age, restless, disappointed, and eager to
> obtain real and complete relief in their hour of trial, hunger
> for the Message of the New Day, and will, if properly
> approached and appealed to, embrace the great verities it
> enshrines. (25 May 1946, LAN 62)

> The limited resources at the disposal of the prosecutors of the
> Plan, the vastness of the territory in which it must operate,
> the fewness of the numbers of those participating in its
> execution, offer a mighty challenge which no loyal follower
> of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh can either ignore or minimize.
> Indeed the greater the challenge, the more bountiful the
> blessings which will be vouchsafed from on high, and the
> richer the reward to be won by its triumphant executors. (11

May 1948, LAN 71)

> It is not for them, however, at the present stage of their
> evolution, to probe into the future, and seek to evaluate the
> range of their future achievements. They must concentrate
> every ounce of their energy, and focus their entire attention,
> on the tasks immediately ahead, resolved to work un-
> remittingly and unflinchingly until the goals of the present
Plan are achieved.

Whatever the situation that may develop in the years to
> come, however great the obstacles by which a nascent
> community may yet be faced, no matter how arduous the task
> now confronting its members, it must persevere until the
historic work is accomplished.

I will, from the depths of my heart, supplicate the Beloved
> to reinforce the noble exertions of this community, guide its
> steps, clarify its vision, deepen its understanding of the
> requirements of the present hour, and aid it to extend
> continually the scope of its meritorious achievements. (11

May 1948, LAN 72)

> Every outward thrust into new fields, every multiplication of
> Bahá’í institutions, must be paralleled by a deeper thrust of
> the roots which sustain the spiritual life of the community
> and ensure its sound development. From this vital, this ever-
> present need, attention must at no time be diverted; nor must
> it be, under any circumstances, neglected, or subordinated to

\[212\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

> the no less vital and urgent task of ensuring the outer
> expansion of Bahá’í administrative institutions. That this
> community, so alive, so devoted, so strikingly and rapidly
> developing, may maintain a proper balance between these
> two essential aspects of its development, and march forward
> with rapid strides and along sound lines toward the goal of
> the Plan it has adopted, is the ardent hope of my heart and
> my constant prayer. (30 December 1948, LAN 76)

5\. Canada

Canada was opened to the Faith in 1902 by Mrs May Maxwell,
and blessed by the footsteps of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 10 years later.
With its sister national community the United States, it was joint
recipient of the Tablets of the Divine Plan. Shoghi Effendi’s first
letter to the newly-formed Local Spiritual Assembly in Montreal,
dated 2 January 1923, reads: ‘Though its people be firmly
entrenched in their religious sectarianism and strongly attached
to their religious doctrines and traditions, yet who can doubt that
with courage and persistence, kindliness and wisdom, the all-
conquering words of Bahá’u’lláh can fail to break down all these
barriers of prejudice and religious exclusiveness and conquer
this long-standing stronghold of sectarian belief!’ (MC 5).

The first edition of messages to Canada was published in
1965, and had only 30 communications from the Guardian. An
enlarged edition appeared in 1999 and consists of 278 letters and
cables, running to 170 pages. The revised version is divided into
four sections as follows:

> •   From 1923 to 1937 (the early years)
> •   From 1937 to 1948 (first teaching plans)
•   From 1948 to 1953 (emergence as an independent

national community)
•   From 1953 to 1957 (Ten Year Crusade)

The Canadian National Spiritual Assembly was formed in
1948 and by 1953, when the Ten Year Crusade was launched,
had become one of the national pillars of the Administrative
Order. It was thus one of the ‘twelve generals’ of the Ten Year
Plan. The major messages of Shoghi Effendi to Canada were sent
between 1948 and 1957.

Passages from these important letters follow below:

> It behoves us, now that the signs of that glorious and
> promised Day are fast appearing, to arise, with utter
> selflessness, unity and determination, to promote and
> consolidate the Work which He has Himself established in
> the heart of that vast Dominion [Canada], and prove
> ourselves, by our wisdom, moderation, and constancy,
> worthy of the many bestowals He has showered upon us in
> the past. If we but follow in His Way, regard at all times the
> dignity of the Cause, guard sedulously its unity and vital
> principles, and exercise the utmost endeavour to keep its
> Spirit pure, effective and unobscured, then, and only then,
> can we hope to achieve the immediate spread and triumph of
> the Cause. (20 April 1923, MC 9)

> Obstacles, however formidable, will have to be determinedly
> surmounted. Any reverses that sooner or later may be
> suffered should be met with stoic fortitude, and speedily
> offset by victories in other fields. The glorious vision now
> unveiled to your eyes must never be dimmed. The
> illuminating promises enshrined in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablets
> should not be forgotten for a moment. The quality of the
> success already achieved by so small a number, over so
> extensive a field, in so brief a period, at so precarious an
> hour in the destinies of mankind, should spur on the elected
> representatives of this now fully fledged community to
> achieve in as short a period, over still more extensive an
> area, and despite a severer crisis than any as yet

\[214\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

encountered, victories more abiding in their merit and more
conspicuous in their brilliance than any as yet won in the
service and for the glory of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. (4
November 1948, MC 109–10)

As the operation of the Plan gathers momentum the members
of this community must evince a still greater measure of
solidarity, rise to higher levels of heroism, demonstrate a
greater capacity for collective achievement, and attract still
more abundant blessings on the varied enterprises on which
they have embarked. (19 June 1949, MC 114–15)

That this community will never relax in its high endeavours,
that the vision of its glorious mission will not be suffered to
be dimmed, that obstacles, however formidable, will neither
dampen its zeal or deflect it from its purpose, is my confident
hope and earnest prayer. He Who watches over its destinies,
from Whose pen testimonies so significant and soul thrilling
have flowed, will no doubt continue to direct its steps, to
shower upon it His loving bounties, to surround it with His
constant care, and to enable it to scale loftier heights on its
ascent towards the summit of its destiny.

With a heart brimful with gratitude for all that this
community has so far achieved, and throbbing with hope for
the future exploits that will distinguish its record of
stewardship to the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, I pray that by its
acts, this community will prove itself worthy of the trust
confided to its care, and the station to which it has been
called. (23 June 1950, MC 131)

It was a Canadian [Louis Bourgeois], of French extraction,
who through his vision and skill was instrumental in
conceiving the design, and delineating the features, of the
first Mashriqu’l-Adhkár of the West, marking the first
attempt, however rudimentary, to express the beauty which

> Bahá’í art will, in its plenitude, unfold to the eyes of the
> world. It was a Canadian woman [Marion Jack], one of the
> noblest in the ranks of Bahá’í pioneers, who alone and
> single-handed, forsook her home, settled among an alien
> people, braved with a leonine spirit the risks and dangers of
> the world conflict that raged around her, and who now, at an
> advanced age and suffering from infirmities, is still holding
> the Fort and is setting an example, worthy of emulation by all
> her fellow pioneers of both the East and the West. It was a
> member [Rúḥíyyih Khánum] of that same community who
> won the immortal distinction of being called upon to be my
> helpmate, my shield in warding off the darts of Covenant-
> breakers and my tireless collaborator in the arduous tasks I
> shoulder. It was a Canadian subject [May Maxwell], the
> spiritual mother of that same community, who, though fully
> aware of the risks of the voyage she was undertaking,
> journeyed as far as the capital of Argentina to serve a Cause
> that had honoured her so uniquely, and there laid down her
> life and won the everlasting crown of martyrdom. It was,
> moreover, a Canadian [William Sutherland Maxwell] who
> more recently achieved the immortal renown of designing the
> exquisite shell destined to envelop, preserve and embellish
> the holy and priceless structure enshrining the dust of the
> Beloved Founder of our Faith. (1 March 1951, MC 141–2)

> The opportunity given to this Community is precious,
> unutterably precious. The fate of this first historic Plan now
> hangs in the balance. The present chance, if lost, cannot be
> retrieved. The issues on which hinge the successful pro-
> secution of the Plan are so weighty that none can assess them
> at present. The needs of a sorely-stricken society, groping in
> its distress for God’s redemptive Message, are growing more
> acute with every passing hour. The Canadian Bahá’í
> Community, newly emerged as an independent member of the
> Bahá’í World Community, so richly blessed through its

\[216\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

elevation to the rank of a chosen prosecutor of a Divine Plan,
unique, in many respects, among its sister communities in
both Hemispheres in the manifold blessings bestowed upon
it, can neither afford to flinch for a moment or hesitate in the
discharge of its sacred duty. Every effort exerted by this
community, during these fate-laden months, every sacrifice
willingly endured by its members, will, if they but persevere,
be richly blessed by Him Who brought it into being, Who
nursed it through His love, Who conferred upon it so
distinguished a Mission, Who made such magnificent
promises regarding its future, and Who will continue to
sustain it through His unfailing, His abounding grace and
favour. (30 October 1951, MC 149)

Inspired by the example and the accomplishments of those of
its members who have distinguished themselves in the Holy
Land, on the European continent and in both the northern
and southern continents of the Western Hemisphere, this
community must forge on, with added determination, with
increasing dedication, with thanksgiving and redoubled zeal,
on the road leading it to a still more glorious destiny in the
years immediately ahead. That it may press forward, conquer
still greater heights, plumb greater depths of consecration,
spread wider and wider the fame of the Cause of God is the
cherished desire of my heart and the object of my constant
supplication. (8 June 1952, MC 160)

May this community march forward on its destined path with
renewed vigour, with undimmed vision, with complete unity,
with utter consecration, and be enabled to play an important
part in the execution of the great tasks ahead, and worthily
contribute to the prodigious efforts now being collectively
exerted by the followers of the Most Great Name, in every
continent of the globe, for the world-wide establishment and

> ultimate triumph of a long-persecuted, divinely impelled,
> world-redeeming Faith. (15 June 1954, MC 208)

> The duties incumbent upon this community, and particularly
> its elected national representatives, multiply with every
> passing day. Heavy is the burden they carry. Rich and
> immense are the possibilities stretching before them. Price-
> less are the rewards which a befitting discharge of their
> multiple responsibilities must bring in its wake. Boundless
> are the favours and bestowals which a loving and watchful
> Providence is ready to confer upon those who will arise to
> meet the challenge of the present hour. (26 June 1956, MC

> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s prophetic words regarding the future of its
> [Canada’s] homeland, spiritually as well as materially – the
> initial evidences of which are becoming more apparent every
> day, must not be lost sight of for a moment, however exacting
> and all-absorbing the strenuous task ahead, however
> complex the problems its prosecution involves, however
> burdensome the preoccupations which it must needs
> engender. (18 July 1957, MC 267)

6\. New Zealand

This compilation was published in 1982 under the title of
Arohanui. The literal meaning of this Maori word is ‘big love’
(or ‘much and great love’). In the introduction the National
Spiritual Assembly of New Zealand explains that the title also
implies ‘enfolding love’ or ‘that love which builds and carries
forward culture or civilization’.

The compilation consists of 79 letters and cables addressed to
individuals and institutions in New Zealand. These letters are set
out under the following categories:

\[218\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

•   Letters to individuals, June 1923 to April 1926
•   Letters to individuals, August 1926 to September 1933
•   Letters to individuals, June 1934 to January 1955
•   Letters to Bahá’í institutions, March 1926 to September

•   Cables to New Zealand, January 1949 to December 1953
•   Extracts on various subjects

Passages from these messages are included below:

Your letters are always a source of inspiring joy and
stimulating encouragement to me. You are destined to
achieve great things for our beloved Cause and my constant
prayer is that your vision may be clear, your purpose
unshaken, your zeal undiminished, your hopes undimmed.
Let not obstacles and disappointments, which are inevit-
able, dishearten you and whenever you are faced with trials
recall our Beloved’s innumerable sufferings. You certainly
occupy a warm and abiding place in my heart. (12 August
1926, AR 21)

When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says man breaks the laws of nature, He
means we shape nature to meet our own needs, as no animal
does. Animals adapt themselves to better fit in with and
benefit from their environment. But men both surmount and
change environment. Likewise when He says nature is devoid
of memory He means memory as we have it, not the strange
memory of inherited habits which animals so strikingly
possess. (Written on his behalf, 7 June 1946, AR 85)

May the outpourings of the Holy Spirit continue to energise
this small yet resolute forward marching, dedicated com-
munity, and may the outcome of the collective efforts of its
members contribute decisively to the triumphant consum-
mation of the World Crusade on which the entire body of the

> followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh have so confidently
> embarked. (4 April 1957, AR 72)

> All must participate, whether young or old, veterans as well
> as newly enrolled believers, all must contribute their share to
> the ultimate success of this mighty collective enterprise,
> however limited their means, however modest their abilities,
> however restricted the range of their previous experiences.

(27 June 1957, AR 74–5)

7\. Alaska

The National Spiritual Assembly of Alaska, which was formed at
Riḍván of the very year that Shoghi Effendi passed away,
published in 1976 a compilation of his letters to the friends in
Alaska. In the foreword to the book we read the following:
‘[T]his book represents more than a collection of letters from the
Guardian of the Cause of God. It shows his tender, loving hand
as his vision becomes translated into reality, from virgin territory
to teaching area, to pioneer post, to local institutions, to national
institutions. It is a view of the master craftsman, shaping a
sustained pillar of the Universal House of Justice’ (HE viii–ix).

The letters to individual believers are divided into two
sections, one dated 1939 to 1943, and the second 1946 to 1957.
The book also reproduces telegrams to pioneers and letters to
Bahá’í institutions. There are 80 communications from the
Guardian, and an additional 24 messages written on his behalf,
but not included under the section of letters to individuals.

Extracts from this compilation are given below:

> I am thrilled by the news you give me. How proud I feel of
> the spirit that so powerfully animates you. My prayers will, I
> assure you, accompany you on your great and historic
> adventure. Persevere no matter how great the obstacles in
> your way. Future generations will glorify your deed and

\[220\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

> emulate your example. The Concourse on high acclaims your
> resolve and will richly bless your endeavours. Be happy and
> confident. (HE 4)

> Your letter cheered and heartened me in the conduct of my
> arduous duties and responsibilities. I rejoice to learn of your
> high endeavours in that distant field, and I will specially pray
> with increasing fervour for your protection and success. How
> great your privilege, how laborious your task, how noble
> your mission! Do not feel disheartened. Persevere and be
> confident always. (HE 5)

> The endeavours which the highminded, youthful hearted,
> deeply consecrated members of this community will exert
> must be such as to excite the unqualified admiration of their
> fellow believers in Bahá’í communities in both Hemispheres.
> The sacrifices which must be made will, no doubt, if they rise
> to this occasion, merit the applause of the Concourse on high
> and draw forth a still fuller measure of the promised
blessings of the Author of the Divine Plan Himself.

That the members of this community may neither falter
> nor fail, that they may set an example worthy of emulation of
> their fellow-workers in all continents of the globe, that they
> may achieve such feats, in the course of the attainment of
> their high objectives, as shall eclipse the past achievements
> of their spiritual brethren in the North American continent
> and throughout Latin America, is the object of my constant
> prayer for them in the Holy Shrines as well as my heart’s
> most cherished desire. (HE 38)

8\. Japan

The first compilation of Shoghi Effendi’s messages to Japan was
published in 1974 under the title of Japan Will Turn Ablaze. It
was revised and enlarged in 1992. The revised version begins

with copies of Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Miss Agnes Alexander
as well as to Japanese Bahá’ís. This is followed by the major
portion of the book, which includes 103 letters and cables of the
Guardian, arranged in the following order:

> •   46 letters and cables to Miss Agnes Alexander
> •   11 letters and cables to the Bahá’ís of Japan
> •   2 letters and cables to institutions
•   5 letters and cables to the National Assembly of North-

East Asia, with its seat in Japan

These communications from the Guardian quite often remind
the friends of the promises given by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá of the
glorious services that are in store for Japanese believers and the
high standards of sustained, vigorous and dedicated effort
expected of them in promoting the interests of God’s Holy Faith.

Some extracts follow:

> Now if ever is the time for you and for us to show, by our
> unity, service, steadfastness and courage, the spirit that
> the Master has throughout His lifetime so laboriously, so
> persistently kindled in our hearts. Now is the time for us to
> prove ourselves worthy of His love for us, His trust in us
> and His hopes for us. Japan, He said, will turn ablaze. Let
> us not, in any way, whatsoever, retard the realization of
> His promise. Nay, let us hasten, through our service, coope-
> ration and efforts the advent of this glorious day. (26 January
> 1922, JTA 73)

> Your letters have gladdened my heart and fortified me in my
> task. I will continue to supplicate for you at His Shrine, that
> He may graciously assist you to make of those who are
> merely interested, active supporters of the Faith, recognizing
> fully the significance and station of Bahá’u’lláh, and who
> will form a nucleus of believers who will carry on the work,

\[222\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

loyally and effectively after you and in your absence. This is
my fervent prayer for you. (21 December 1928, JTA 59)

Your past and present services are engraved upon my heart.
The Beloved is well-pleased with your constancy, your zeal
and exemplary devotion. I am proud of the spirit that so
powerfully animates you in His service. I will continue to
pray for your success from the bottom of my heart. Rest
assured and persevere. (23 September 1935, JTA 64)

Bahá’u’lláh wrote, many, many years ago: ‘The vitality of
men’s belief in God is dying out in every land; nothing short
of His wholesome medicine can ever restore it. The corrosion
of ungodliness is eating into the vitals of human society; what
else but the Elixir of His potent Revelation can cleanse and
revive it?’

This is the ebb of the tide. The Bahá’ís know that the tide
will turn and come in, after mankind has suffered, with
mighty waves of faith and devotion. The people will enter the
Cause of God in troops, and the whole condition will change.
The Bahá’ís see this new condition which will take place, as
one on the mountain-top sees the first glimpse of the dawn,
before others are aware of it; and it is toward this that the
Bahá’ís must work. (Written on his behalf, 5 October 1953,
JTA 102)

. . . The emergence of a new Regional Spiritual Assembly in
the North Pacific Area [National Spiritual Assembly of North
East Asia, with its seat in Tokyo, Japan] . . . may be said to
have, at long last, established a spiritual axis, extending from
the Antipodes to the northern islands of the Pacific Ocean –
an axis whose northern and southern poles will act as power-
ful magnets, endowed with exceptional spiritual potency, and
towards which younger and less experienced communities
will tend for some time to gravitate. (19 July 1957, JTA 89)

> political forces which tend to keep them apart and foster
> racial and political antagonisms, the close and continued
> association of these communities . . . is a matter of vital and
> urgent importance, which should receive on the part of the
> elected representatives of their communities, a most earnest
> and prayerful consideration . . . (19 July 1957, JTA 89)

O. Letters written on behalf of the Guardian by his
secretaries

When mail was received by Shoghi Effendi, it was his practice to
open the letters himself, just in case the material submitted to
him was confidential. He would then decide whether to send the
answer over his own signature, or use one of his secretaries to
convey his thoughts on his behalf. This method was followed in
respect to both the East and the West.

The secretaries who served him in this capacity for the
correspondence from the West were as follows: Ethel Rosenberg,
Dr J.E. Esslemont, Rouhanguiz Rabbani (his sister), Ruhi Afnan,
‘Azízu’lláh Bahádur, Soheil Afnan, Hussein Rabbani (his
brother), Amatu’l-Bahá Rúḥíyyih Khánum, the Hands of the
Cause in the Holy Land, the International Bahá’í Council, and
Leroy Ioas. The secretaries for the East, writing most of the time
in Persian, and at times in Arabic, were as follows: Maḥmúd
Zarqání, ‘Azízu’lláh Bahádur, Núri’d-Dín Zayn, ‘Alí-Asghar
Qazvíní (only for correspondence with local believers and
neighbouring localities in Jordan) and Dr Lotfu’llah Hakim.

These secretaries were not all serving him at the same time;
their names have been given on a chronological basis as they

\[224\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

succeeded one another. The secretaries who served him for his
English correspondence were normally accessible to him in
person, but for the secretaries for the East, particularly in the
case of Mr Zayn, who lived at a distance from the Master’s
house, he would instead convey his instructions in writing.

When the instructions were given, the secretaries would for
the most part take notes, especially if the answer was not to be a
brief one. Drafts would then be made by the secretary concerned,
and the letter submitted to the Guardian for verification. If, in
any given case, the Guardian did not approve the drafted letter, it
would be sent back to the secretary with renewed instructions. If
he felt that the draft was acceptable, he would, in rare cases, send
it without any further additions, but in the majority of cases
would append a postscript followed by his signature.

He would normally also add a closing phrase to the letter. For
the East it was invariably ‘The servant of His Threshold’. When
he first used this expression, soon after the passing of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, it was clear from the context that the possessive pronoun,
‘His’, referred to the Master. After the phrase he would sign his
name, ‘Shoghi’. As to his correspondence with the West, various
forms were used in the early years, such as:

> Your sincere co-worker in His Cause
> Your brother and co-worker in His Cause
> Your brother and co-worker
> I am, as ever, you brother in His Service
> I am your devoted brother
> I am your brother and fellow-worker
> Your brother in His Service
> I am your brother and co-worker
> Your brother

Towards the end of 1923, he finally settled on ‘Your true
brother’, followed by his signature. In certain cases, when he felt
that the recipient, whether an institution or an individual, had

accomplished services that called for his special appreciation, the
final greeting would be, ‘Your true and grateful brother’.

In one of his letters, he assures the questioner of his close
examination of the letters written on his behalf prior to sending
them to their recipients: ‘Concerning letters from Haifa.
Whatever letters are sent in my behalf from Haifa are all read
and approved by me before mailing. There is no exception
whatever to this rule’ (PBA 87).

In the light of the above extract, it has become the policy of
the Archives Office to receive and preserve not only letters and
other communications composed by Shoghi Effendi himself, but
also all letters written on his behalf to the East and to the West.

\[226\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

Q. Will all people become Bahá’ís in the future?

A. There is no reference in the writings stating that every single
person will become Bahá’í, but at least half of them will.
Rúḥíyyih Khánum used to say that Shoghi Effendi was asked this
question quite often by pilgrims. He would answer by saying
that, in this Dispensation, the totality of the peoples of the world
will not become Bahá’ís, but the majority will.

Q. How can we explain sensitively to a seeker that the future
World Order will have international institutions, which will
govern the whole world in a just and fair way, but whose
members will be only Bahá’ís? How can we then explain that
the Faith accepts and embraces all religions?

A. In the writings of Shoghi Effendi about the future, there are
two different sets of global institutions that are described. One
set can be found in ‘The Goal of a New World Order’, the other
in ‘The Unfoldment of World Civilization’. In the former, he
describes the institutions as a world superstate. In the latter, he
describes the institutions of the Bahá’í World Commonwealth.

The world superstate will be a separate political system.

Parallel with this system, the Bahá’í Administrative Order will
also function. The two systems will not yet have merged. This
will be a perfected, a consolidated, and a spiritually oriented
system of the Lesser Peace. Subsequently, these two structures
will progress until they will both join together, forming the
Bahá’í World Commonwealth, which will usher in the Most
Great Peace.

In ‘The Goal of a New World Order’, Shoghi Effendi lists the
institutions that will exist at the time of the world superstate. He
writes ‘Such a state will have to include within its orbit an

International Executive adequate to enforce supreme and
unchallengeable authority on every recalcitrant member of the
commonwealth; a World Parliament whose members shall be
elected by the people in their respective countries and whose
election shall be confirmed by their respective governments; and
a Supreme Tribunal whose judgment will have a binding effect
even in such cases where the parties concerned did not volun-
tarily agree to submit their case to its consideration’ (WOB 40–
1). When you compare this to the list of institutions that will
exist during the Bahá’í World Commonwealth, we notice that,
although the executive, the legislative and judicial branches are
mentioned, their order has changed. He writes, ‘This common-
wealth must, as far as we can visualize it, consist of a world
legislature, whose members will, as the trustees of the whole of
mankind, ultimately control the entire resources of all the
component nations, and will enact such laws as shall be required
to regulate the life, satisfy the needs and adjust the relationships
of all races and peoples. A world executive, backed by an
international Force, will carry out the decisions arrived at, and
apply the laws enacted by, this world legislature, and will
safeguard the organic unity of the whole commonwealth. A world
tribunal will adjudicate and deliver its compulsory and final
verdict in all and any disputes that may arise between the
various elements constituting this universal system’ (WOB 203).
In this case, the legislative body is before the executive body.

We must be aware that the world superstate will not be a
Bahá’í system. There may be Bahá’ís involved in it, but its
operation, as far as we can visualize, will be inspired by the
Bahá’í system.

There is nothing in the writings to say that those who occupy
positions in all branches of the Commonwealth should be
Bahá’ís. The world legislature in the Bahá’í World Common-
wealth, however, will be the Universal House of Justice, which
Shoghi Effendi has called the ‘supreme organ of the Bahá’í
Commonwealth’, and its members must be Bahá’ís. This does

\[228\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

not necessarily apply to the other two branches. The members of
the executive and judicial branches may well be non-Bahá’ís.
The only strict requirement is that the members of the Universal
House of Justice must be Bahá’ís.

Q. Could you please clarify what was going to be the function
of the Bahá’í Court in the Holy Land that was to be
established as one of the objectives of the Ten Year Crusade?
Do you think that such a Court will be created in the future,
if conditions permit?

A. A short introduction is necessary to understand the question.
Shoghi Effendi, towards the end of 1950, appointed a body of
men and women to support him in his work. He named this
institution the International Bahá’í Council. He assigned the
members of the International Bahá’í Council such duties as
forging ties with the government of the newly emerged state of
Israel, helping him in the construction of the Báb’s Shrine, and
conducting negotiations with the civil authorities about the
possibility of Bahá’í laws of personal status being officially
recognized in the Holy Land. Shoghi Effendi explained that the
appointed International Bahá’í Council would pass through
several stages in its evolution. The appointed Council was to
become an appointed International Bahá’í Court. The appointed
Court would cease to exist, and then the Universal House of
Justice would be elected. That was his outline of its
development.

In 1953, as soon as he included the formation of a Bahá’í
Court in the goals of the Ten Year Crusade, Shoghi Effendi
immediately started working on it. He sent the members of the
appointed Council to Jerusalem, back and forth, to investigate
whether this was possible or not. The report was negative. The
Hands of the Cause of God have referred to this in a book called
The Ministry of the Custodians 1957–1963, compiled by
Rúḥíyyih Khánum. In their letter, the Hands of the Cause of God

wrote that Shoghi Effendi had indicated that this goal might not
be achieved, because the country was becoming secular and the
government was not in favour of giving further powers to
religious courts. The government intended to gradually phase out
the religious courts and replace them with secular civil courts.

The Hands of the Cause decided that they would have to
make arrangements for the election of the Universal House of
Justice in 1963, since Shoghi Effendi had clearly indicated this in
his writings. They came to the conclusion that the best way to
handle this was to have the appointed Council become an elected
Council and then to ask the elected Council to continue its
negotiations about the Court. Despite the fact that Shoghi Effendi
indicated that it was most unlikely for that goal of the Ten Year
Crusade to be fulfilled, they did not stop pursuing it.

To set up the election of the Council, the Hands of the Cause
of God issued a letter to all National Spiritual Assemblies stating
that it was not necessary to come to the Holy Land for the
election. Instead, the members of the National Spiritual Assem-
blies that were elected in 1960 were asked to send their ballots
by mail to the World Centre, for nine people, men or women, to
become members of the elected International Bahá’í Council.
They further stated that the Hands of the Cause should not be
considered for election as they were wholly occupied with the
Ten Year Crusade. The election took place and a new body was
created – the elected International Bahá’í Council. One of the
duties that the Hands of the Cause gave to this International
Bahá’í Council was to continue the work of investigating the
possibility of establishing a Bahá’í Court in the Holy Land. The
members had to bear in mind that Shoghi Effendi had repeatedly
said that we would have a religious court on one condition only:
it should have the same rights as the other religious courts, as the
Bahá’ís should have equal status with the Jews, the Christians
and the Muslims in the country. If we weren’t given equal status,
we wouldn’t accept. The members of the elected International
Council started going to Jerusalem. They must have gone about

\[230\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

20 times to meet with different ministers, the Prime Minister, and
the President. However, it was not possible to establish a Bahá’í
Court that would have equal rights with the others. Shoghi
Effendi had been correct in his anticipation of this outcome, and
so this goal remained unfulfilled. However, this does not mean
that we have given up. If at any time it would be possible to do
so, no doubt the Universal House of Justice will take action.

It is important to know that Shoghi Effendi made it clear to
the Hands of the Cause residing in the Holy Land that the antici-
pated Court, if it was established, would not have jurisdiction
over National Spiritual Assemblies. It would be a local institu-
tion just for Israel, concerned with the recognition of the Bahá’í
laws of personal status. It was called the International Court
because it was to be located at the World Centre of the Faith.

During the time when Israel was a British mandated territory,
Shoghi Effendi had won recognition from the authorities for the
Bahá’í marriage ceremony, and the government of Israel still
honours this recognition. There are other laws of personal status
which have not yet been recognized, such as the laws related to
divorce and inheritance. There is an excellent statement pub-
lished in The Bahá’í World, Volume XIII, which gives a full and
authoritative treatment of the question.

Q. What is the role of the nine Israel Branches of National
Spiritual Assemblies?

A. Shoghi Effendi wanted the Bahá’í properties and Shrines to
be held in the names of Bahá’í institutions rather than
individuals. He himself embodied an institution, the Guardian-
ship, but he didn’t want the properties to be held in his name.
Therefore, he would establish in Israel a society, with a secretary
and a chairman, which would be named as the Israel Branch of a
National Spiritual Assembly. He started this practice during the
British mandate, and at that time they were called Palestine
Branches. The very first body that was established as a branch in

Palestine was the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of
the United States and Canada – Palestine Branch. It had some
very simple by-laws, about five or six items, that the lawyer was
able to draw up for Shoghi Effendi. It had a chairman and a
secretary. The signed chairman was Shoghi Rabbani. The signed
secretary was his own secretary. It was accepted, and the
property was transferred to this particular society. When Israel
came into existence, it became the Israel Branch. Later, more
National Spiritual Assemblies were added and more properties
were registered in the names of these Branches.

The Universal House of Justice has continued the same
process and it is hoped that, in the future, more properties
belonging to the Bahá’í Community in Israel will be transferred
in the names of Branches of other National Spiritual Assemblies.
Indeed, Shoghi Effendi has written that, not only will the Bahá’í
properties of the World Centre be transferred to branches of
different National Spiritual Assemblies, but important Bahá’í
holy places throughout the world, particularly in Iran, will
eventually be transferred to these Branches. Take for example
the site of the martyrdom of the Báb. Instead of being registered
only in the name of the National Spiritual Assembly of Iran it
will become an international endowment and registered in the
name of maybe one or more Iranian Branches of different
National Spiritual Assemblies.

Q. Today the Universal House of Justice is the Head of the
Faith, and fulfils legislative, executive and judicial functions.
When the stage of the Bahá’í World Commonwealth is
attained, what will be the function of the Universal House of
Justice? What is it that will protect this unique Order from
degenerating into any form of despotism, oligarchy or
demagogy?

A. Today, not only the Universal House of Justice, but the
National Spiritual Assemblies and Spiritual Assemblies also

\[232\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

fulfil legislative, executive and judicial functions. However, this
will change in the future. Eventually, I think, at all levels, the
executive and judicial functions will be given to other
institutions. The Universal House of Justice will have to decide
how this should be done.

One day, when I was on pilgrimage, Shoghi Effendi was
talking about some similar subject. He drew my attention to a
statement made by Bahá’u’lláh that ‘All matters of State should
be referred to the House of Justice’ (TB 129).

The second part of the question deals with the promise that
Shoghi Effendi has given us in ‘The Dispensation of
Bahá’u’lláh’: ‘[T]his unique Order, however long it may endure
and however extensive its ramifications, cannot ever degenerate
into any form of despotism, of oligarchy, or of demagogy which
must sooner or later corrupt the machinery of all man-made and
essentially defective political institutions’ (WOB 154). The
guarantee is the Covenant. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was the Centre of the
Covenant. Shoghi Effendi was the Centre of the Cause, and
today the Focal Point of the Cause is the Universal House of
Justice. You will never find this term, the Centre of the Cov-
enant, applied by the Universal House of Justice to itself or even
to the Guardian. Other terms are used, such as Head of the Faith,
Central Institution of the Faith, Pivot of the Faith, Central Pivot
of the Faith, or Focal Point of the Covenant, but the term Centre
of the Covenant is reserved for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The Covenant of
God is the instrument that Bahá’ulláh has Himself created, not
only for the ministry of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, but for posterity. Shoghi
Effendi has written: ‘The Covenant designed to safeguard the
unity and integrity of its world-embracing system had been
irrevocably bequeathed to posterity’ (GPB 223). We are now
living under the shadow of the Covenant. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refers to
the period of His own ministry as the morning of the Covenant.
We are still situated in the early hours of the morning of the
Covenant. The Covenant is going to continue throughout the
Day, ‘the Day which shall not be followed by night’ (GPB 245).

This is the guarantee! The finger of God is on the Central
Institution of the Faith, which today is the Universal House of
Justice. The guarantee is our love for Bahá’u’lláh, our love for
the Covenant, and our conviction of its validity. It is the power of
the Covenant which protects the Bahá’í Administrative Order
from the degeneration suffered by all other institutions.

Q. ‘Will America allow any of her sister communities in East
or West to achieve such ascendancy as shall deprive her of that
spiritual primacy with which she has been invested and which
she has thus far so nobly retained?’ (WOB 94). Is this just
rhetoric? Do you think that Shoghi Effendi really considered
the possibility that one of the European communities would
surpass the United States? What about the other countries in
the world, such as India, Colombia, Iran, etc.?

A. My own personal feeling about this is that Shoghi Effendi was
endeavouring to stimulate the Bahá’ís of the United States to
fully assume the primacy that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had conferred upon
the American community. Just before this, he refers to the
destiny of America in these words: ‘Great indeed have been your
past and present achievements! Immeasurably greater are the
wonders which the future has in store for you!’ (WOB 94).

He is talking about the standard which, if ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
wishes are to be fulfilled, must be raised in America. It has not
yet been unfurled. I think he was pricking and nudging the
American Bahá’í community to wake up and assume its God-
given responsibilities. However, no one really knows what the
future has in store. It would be a great tragedy to the American
Bahá’í community if it fails in future years to assume the grave
responsibility laid upon it by the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. Let
us hope that the American Bahá’ís will continue to succeed in
their efforts.

\[234\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

Q. ‘To attempt to visualize, even in its barest outline, the glory
that must envelop these institutions, to essay even a tentative
and partial description of their character or the manner of
their operation, or to trace however inadequately the course of
events leading to their rise and eventual establishment is far
beyond my own capacity and power’ (TDH 46). Is this just
rhetoric? Are we to honestly believe that Shoghi Effendi, the
sign of God, didn’t have the power to tell us about these
things?

A. To fully understand this sentence one has to read the previous
paragraph. He says ‘these institutions’. Which institutions?
Certainly they are not the institutions of the current Admin-
istrative Order, nor are they institutions which we are to see
emerging over the next 100 or 200 years. Shoghi Effendi wrote
that the Guardianship enabled the Faith ‘to take a long, an
uninterrupted view over a series of generations’ (WOB 148).
Therefore, I do not think that these institutions lie within that
period of time that he could foresee. He was talking about the
institutions mentioned in the previous paragraph: ‘those world-
shaking, world-embracing, world-directing administrative insti-
tutions, ordained by Bahá’u’lláh and anticipated by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, and which are to function in consonance with the
principles that govern the twin institutions of the Guardianship
and the Universal House of Justice’ (TDH 46). In my opinion, he
was referring to the institutions of the Bahá’í World
Commonwealth. He was not speaking about the time of the
Lesser Peace, or of the Great Peace, but of the Most Great Peace.

During the Great Peace there will be, basically, a non-sacred
superstate. The institutions of the Faith will not yet have the
opportunity to exercise direct influence on the condition of the
world, but they will do it indirectly, through the inspiration they
will give to the superstate. During the Most Great Peace the
institutions of the Faith will effectively be world-shaking, world-
embracing and world-directing. This is when the words, ‘The

world’s equilibrium hath been upset through the vibrating
influence of this most great, this new World Order’ (KA ¶181)
will have become a reality. We are assured that a world
civilization is going to emerge, by virtue of the impact of ‘this
wondrous System – the like of which mortal eyes have never
witnessed’ (KA ¶181). Shoghi Effendi is telling us that even he
could not fully visualize the wonder and glory of that
civilization.

Q. Bahá’ís are allowed to vote in certain elections, for
example, those which do not require them to identify them-
selves with a political party. How should we view an election
where you cannot, technically, give your vote to an
individual, only to a political party? Would it make any
difference if each party had only one candidate (e.g. for
President), so that by voting for a particular party one is, in
effect, voting for a particular individual?

A. You are living in a world submerged in politics and
propaganda. It is vital for you to know the Bahá’í position on
politics. There is a text from Shoghi Effendi, which we must call
to mind: ‘Let them refrain from associating themselves, whether
by word or by deed, with the political pursuits of their respective
nations, with the policies of their governments and the schemes
and programs of parties and factions . . . I am firmly convinced,
their first and sacred obligation [is] to abstain from any word or
deed that might be construed as a violation of this vital
principle’ (WOB 64).

Whenever there is uncertainty about what you are permitted
to do in your particular country, it should be referred to your
National Spiritual Assembly. The National Spiritual Assembly
will deliberate on it. If it thinks that casting such a vote is
obviously not an act of political involvement, then it will give
you the green light. However, if there is some chance that such
an act would give the impression that the Bahá’ís had become

\[236\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

involved in politics, it would advise you accordingly. The final
word on the matter is that Bahá’ís should not only avoid
interfering in matters that are obviously political, but they should
also avoid activities that could be construed as political.

Q. Could you elaborate a little on the fall of Shi’ah Islam, of
the Qájár dynasty and of the Sunni Caliphs in
Constantinople, and on the rampant rise of secularism in the
East?

A. Obviously the situation in many countries in the world will
fluctuate. At the time when Shoghi Effendi was writing his
World Order letters and The Promised Day is Come, the Shah of
Iran was trying to suppress the clergy there. He wanted to follow
the example of Ataturk, who had declared that Turkey had
become a secular state, as it still is today. The Shah of Iran also
hoped to separate the church from the state. We see today,
however, that, far from being suppressed, the Shi’ih clergy have
now become the government in Iran. We must take into
consideration the fact that there will be fluctuations in the
situation of the country.

At the end of chapter 2 of God Passes By, Shoghi Effendi
describes this process, which began when Ṭáhíríh lifted her veil
at Badasht. ‘[T]his process of disintegration, associated with the
declining fortunes of a superannuated, though divinely revealed
Law, . . . is destined to culminate in the secularization of the
Muslim states, and in the universal recognition of the Law of
Bahá’u’lláh by all the nations, and its enthronement in the hearts
of all the peoples, of the Muslim world’ (GPB 34).

As I understand it, this means that whatever the current
situation might be in Iran and in the Muslim East, the long-term
development will be that secular states are destined eventually to
replace Islamic states.

Q. As I understand it, Mu%ammad established in Medina the
precedent of the modern state, with a triple separation of
powers: executive, legislative and judicial. Yet, we read in
many history books that the modern state has its origins in
the traditional monarchies of fifteenth-century Europe. What
is the relationship between the state, as conceived by
Mu%ammad, and the modern state?

A. Patriotism, as well as the concept of nationhood, has its origin
in the Islamic Dispensation. However, this is a vast subject, so I
will just give my own very limited understanding of it.

First of all, the state that was established by Muḥammad did
not have three branches, legislative, executive and judicial. The
first part of the period of the ministry of Muḥammad was in
Mecca. The situation was quite similar to the three years of the
ministry of Jesus Christ. From 610, when He declared His
Mission, to 622, Muḥammad and His followers were persecuted
and opposed. In 622, after 12 years of suffering, Muḥammad’s
enemies conceived a plot to assassinate Him. Therefore, He and
His followers took flight from Mecca and went to Medina, where
there were some people who were well disposed towards Islam.

During the first two years in Medina, Muḥammad, for the
first time, had some peace of mind. After the first two years,
there was an attack from the people of Mecca, from His own
tribe, the Quraysh. Muḥammad saw that if He did not now stand
before them and defend Himself as well as His own community,
they would all be assassinated. So, at such a time, he raised the
call of jihad, which is holy war. This war was purely defensive,
because they were being attacked. The first battle marked the
beginning of a six-year period of war between Mecca and
Medina. Eventually, the Islamic army won and entered into
Mecca. This was two years before the passing of Muḥammad.
During these two years, He tried to establish order in the land.
When the other tribes in Arabia saw that the powerful Quraysh
tribe had been defeated, they too accepted Islam. This is how

\[238\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

Arabia as a nation came into existence. ‘Love of one’s country is
an element of the Faith of God’ is a statement attributed to
Muḥammad in one of the well-recognized traditions. In other
words, patriotism is an element of religion. This was because,
under His rule, the whole of Arabia was united. He tried to
establish some form of government, but it certainly didn’t
involve the triple separation of powers. He appointed people to
act as governors in different parts of the country. They were His
representatives, and if there was any problem in one of the
localities, they could resolve it or appoint another person to do so
on their behalf.

It was because of this well-recognized tradition, ‘Love of
one’s country is an element of the Faith of God’, that Shoghi
Effendi was moved to write ‘The conception of nationality, the
attainment to the state of nationhood, may, therefore, be said to
be the distinguishing characteristics of the MuJammadan
Dispensation, in the course of which the nations and races of the
world, and particularly in Europe and America, were unified and
achieved political independence’ (PDC 196). Before Islam there
were, however, empires. Empire-building was and had been the
order of the day, and it flourished under the Persians, the Greeks
and Romans, then the Christian, Islamic and European empires,
and so on throughout past centuries. But empire-building has, in
this Age, come to a complete end. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá referred to unity
in freedom. The Universal House of Justice has shed some
illumination on this subject in Century of Light, ‘Among the
chief developments giving substance to it, the Master may well
have had in mind the dramatic extinction of colonialism and the
consequent rise of self-determination as a dominant feature of
national identity at century’s end’ (CL 129).

Q. Do you think that there will be crisis and victory in the
Golden Age?

A. I am not a prophet, so I don’t really know. However, I don’t
think there will be a chain of crises, as we know them today. It
will be victory after victory. The crises today involve persecution
and opposition to the Faith, such as banning the administration,
demolition of Holy Places, confiscating properties and assets,
martyrdom, imprisonment, ostracism etc. This sort of crisis will
not exist because the Faith will be the established religion of the
planet. There may, however, be other kinds of tests and trials that
we cannot possibly imagine now.

Q. Could you please tell us a little bit more about the
secretaries of the Guardian? How many of them remained
loyal?

A. I will start with the secretaries for the West. Ethel Rosenberg
remained firm to the very end. She was a British Bahá’í, who had
been taught the Faith by Mrs Maxwell. She was very devoted to
Shoghi Effendi and helped him in the work of revising his
translations in the early years of his Guardianship. She remained
firm to the very end. Dr Esslemont, likewise, remained firm in
the Covenant. He was posthumously appointed Hand of the
Cause of God. He wrote the book Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era
and he served for a time as Shoghi Effendi´s secretary.
Rouhangiz Rabbani, the sister of Shoghi Effendi, became a
Covenant-breaker with the rest of the family. Ruhi Afnan was a
cousin of Shoghi Effendi. The mother of Shoghi Effendi,
Ḍíyá’íyyih Khánum, had a sister, and that sister was the mother
of Ruhi Afnan. Ruhi Afnan and his mother both broke the
Covenant. ‘Azízu’lláh Bahádur was a Persian Bahá’í from Shiraz
and he was well versed in Persian literature. He had beautiful
handwriting. He also had studied at the American University of
Beirut and knew very good English, enabling him to serve as a
secretary for the West as well as a secretary of the East. He broke
the Covenant as well. Soheil Afnan was the brother of Ruhi
Afnan. He too broke the Covenant. Hussein Rabbani was Shoghi

\[240\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

Effendi’s brother. He broke the Covenant as well. Thank God,
this ended the line of the Covenant-breaker secretaries.

Then we had a new set of secretaries. Amatu’l-Bahá
Rúḥíyyih Khánum, whom you all know. The Hands of the Cause
in the Holy Land: there were four of them: Amatu’l-Bahá
Rúḥíyyih Khánum, Amelia Collins, Leroy Ioas and Charles
Mason Remey. Mason Remey later broke the Covenant, but the
body of the Hands did not break the Covenant. Shoghi Effendi
used this group of four Hands to convey his thoughts and his
instructions to the Hands of the Cause throughout the world, and
all four of them would sign the letters. The International Bahá’í
Council was also used by Shoghi Effendi as a vehicle to convey
his instructions to National Spiritual Assemblies and individual
believers, especially pioneers. That was an appointed institution
and Leroy Ioas was its Secretary-General. These letters would be
written on paper bearing the International Bahá’í Council
letterhead. Leroy Ioas also wrote letters on his own, not in his
capacity as Secretary-General of the International Bahá’í
Council, but as an assistant secretary to the Guardian. These
were written on paper bearing Shoghi Effendi’s letterhead.
Rúḥíyyih Khánum was the main English secretary of Shoghi
Effendi. She herself had an assistant typist, called Ethel Revell.

Now we come to the secretaries of the East. Maḥmúd
Zarghání was a wonderful Bahá’í, who remained firm and
constant till the very end. ‘Azízu’lláh Bahádur has already been
mentioned. Núri’d-Dín Zayn died in Beirut, and, thank God, he
was under the shadow of the Covenant. ‘Alí-Asghar Qazvíní was
a beautiful soul and Shoghi Effendi loved him very much. He
was living in the basement of the house of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in
Haifa. He was only used for correspondence with local believers
and neighbouring localities in Jordan. There was a community in
Jordan known as ‘Adasíyyih. They were Bahá’ís from Yazd who
had gone there in order to be farmers. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had bought
some land in that village and this land needed to be cultivated, so
He encouraged Bahá’ís from Yazd, who knew about farming, to

settle on this property in ‘Adasíyyih and to develop it. The
correspondence with ‘Adasíyyih was mostly through this dear
Bahá’í, ‘Alí-Asghar Qazvíní. Finally, Dr Lotfu’llah Hakim was
the secretary for the East on the International Bahá’í Council. He
remained firm in the Covenant and was elected to the first
Universal House of Justice.

Q. What did the Nazis do to the Bahá’ís in Germany and
Austria? What was their motivation for this?

A. The Nazi regime’s policy was to exterminate the Jews, and
there were quite a few Bahá’ís in Germany and Austria who
were of Jewish background. Furthermore, the principles of the
Faith, such as unity in diversity, were directly in opposition to
the fascist ideology of the Nazis. They couldn’t tolerate the
existence of an organization which so readily accepted people of
all races into its ranks. Hitler especially didn’t want Jews to
escape persecution by changing their religion, so he outlawed the
Bahá’í Faith. There had been a National Assembly for Germany
and Austria and it was forced to disband in 1939.

The Bahá’ís were prevented from having any form of activity
or meeting until the end of the war. It took a whole year, from
1945 to 1946, for the German Bahá’í community to be resuscit-
ated. Particular credit must go the American Bahá’í community
for the work it did in Germany after the war. As soon as the
community was back on its feet, Shoghi Effendi gave it a
teaching plan. The Bahá’ís really leaped back into action, moved
on, and won their goals.

Q. What is meant by the City of the Covenant?

A. The ‘City of the Covenant’ refers to New York, because, as
far as the West was concerned, it was in New York that ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá first declared His own station as the Centre of the

\[242\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

Covenant. The circumstances are described in Century of Light,
page 26.

Q. I can see the integrative process in the world today, for
example, the way in which the principles of Bahá’u’lláh are
gaining greater acceptance among all kinds of people. This is
speeding up day by day. However, the disintegrative process
doesn’t seem to be progressing. Did it not reach its peak
during the lifetime of the Guardian? Aren’t things a lot
better now than before, generally speaking?

A. The process of disintegration did not reach its nadir in the
years of the Guardianship. There has been a definite and obvious
recrudescence of religious prejudice. Fundamentalism is on the
rise. There are now more mullas than ever who preach a kind of
radical Islam. Fundamentalism can also be seen in the ranks of
Christianity, especially in North America.

This disintegration is not going to have a serious negative
effect on the integrative process. It will have mainly a positive
effect: the people of the world will become exasperated with
fundamentalism. When people become worn out and tired as
they see the disintegration of society, then they will lend an even
mightier effort to the integrative process.

This recrudescence of fundamentalism has been designed by
an All-Wise Providence in order to shake the world’s conscience,
to awaken the spirit of brotherhood, and to strengthen the spirit
of tolerance. Fundamentalism is a kind of religious irreligion
which, combined with the forces of materialism, secularism and
abandonment of the true spirit of religion, will create chaos and
confusion in the world, and will eventually turn people towards
the spiritual values, and eventually towards the Cause.

Q. ‘Nation-building has come to an end. The anarchy inherent
in state sovereignty is moving towards a climax. A world,
growing to maturity, must abandon this fetish, recognize the

oneness and wholeness of human relationships, and establish
once for all the machinery that can best incarnate this
fundamental principle of its life’ (WOB 202). The number of
nations in the world has rapidly increased since the time
Shoghi Effendi wrote this, especially in Eastern Europe and
Africa. Many other countries are on the verge of splitting up.
How should we view this process in the light of the above
quotation?

A. We must make a distinction between two totally different
processes. The first process is the creation of new independent
states due to the collapse of vast empires (e.g. British and French
empires) and the dismemberment of collective political unions
(e.g. the splitting up of the USSR). The second process is one
whereby independent nations try to strengthen their national
sovereignty and to become ever more independent of other
countries.

In my opinion, what Shoghi Effendi meant by nation-
building coming to an end was that it is no longer possible for
one nation to go it alone. It is no longer in harmony with the
spirit of the Age for one group of people to think that it can exist
within its own boundaries, ignoring the rest of the world. We are
now at the stage where it is imperative for the nations to become
united. Shoghi Effendi calls nationalism a fetish. We must
distinguish the spirit of nationalism from the spirit of patriotism.
Patriotism is love for one’s country. This will continue. The
future world civilization will be based on unity in diversity.
Everyone can still love their own culture and their own country.
That is natural. Shoghi Effendi has written, ‘Let there be no
misgivings as to the animating purpose of the world-wide Law of
Bahá’u’lláh . . . Its purpose is neither to stifle the flame of a sane
and intelligent patriotism in men’s hearts, nor to abolish the
system of national autonomy . . .’ (WOB 41). Nationalism, as
distinct from patriotism, is different, because it implies
neglecting the rest of the world, when national interests are at

\[244\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

stake, and even wishing one’s own country to prevail over
others. Shoghi Effendi says that this tendency towards national-
ism has come to an end. Universal solidarity is destined to take
the place of extreme national sovereignty.

Q. In The Promised Day is Come the Guardian explains the
high station of just kings and monarchs. Was he only
speaking about the hereditary kind of monarchs as there
were at that time, or could he also have meant presidents, as
we have today, or elected monarchs, for example?

A. There is nothing that I have read that gives a clear definition
of what Bahá’u’lláh had in mind when He wrote about kings.
However, He often used the phrase ‘kings and rulers’, so I think
that one could reasonably conclude that He was writing about
heads of state. Some heads of state are hereditary monarchs, but
nowadays many heads of state are elected presidents. This matter
certainly falls under the category of matters of state. ‘All matters
of State should be referred to the House of Justice’ (TB 129).

Q. ‘This judgment of God . . . is both a retributory calamity and
an act of holy and supreme discipline. It is at once a visitation
from God and a cleansing process for all mankind. Its fires
punish the perversity of the human race, and weld its
component parts into one organic, indivisible, world-embracing
community’ (PDC 5–6). Is the line of disintegration a part of
the Major Plan of God? Are the calamities the result of
mankind’s own behaviour? What is meant by the ‘judgment
of God’?

A. The line of disintegration is certainly a part of the Major Plan
of God, but we should not conclude that God likes to see all this
suffering. He looks at humanity and He sees the illnesses and
diseases afflicting it. As a Physician, He tells us that the con-

dition of this sick patient is going to deteriorate. His knowledge
of humanity’s waywardness doesn’t cause its waywardness.

As for the meaning of the judgment of God: God certainly
has not created the world and gone to sleep. He is watching over
the destiny of humanity and the fortunes of His own Faith. He
sees that the people of the world are not generally responding to
the Faith. He has sent to them His own Manifestation, and just
look at how they have treated Him and are treating His Faith!
Therefore, God designs a punishment for humanity because of
the behaviour of the human race. As Shoghi Effendi pointed out,
‘God . . . does not only punish the wrongdoings of His children.
He chastises because He is just, and He chastens because He
loves. Having chastened them, He cannot, in His great mercy,
leave them to their fate. Indeed, by the very act of chastening
them He prepares them for the mission for which He has created
them’ (PDC 189). In that sense, the punishment has a positive
effect. When a father or a mother punishes a child it is not
because of vengeance. Basically, it is because of love. It is to
help that child to realize its own mistake and not repeat it again.

Q. ‘Who is the sovereign, excepting a single woman, shining in
solitary glory, who has, in however small a measure, felt
impelled to respond to the poignant call of Bahá’u’lláh?’ (PDC
20–1). Who is the single woman mentioned in this quotation?

A. My understanding of this sentence is that it is a reference to
Queen Victoria.

Q. How can we understand the statement made by
Bahá’u’lláh, ‘In truth the station of this Revelation
transcendeth the station of whatever hath been manifested in
the past or will be made manifest in the future’ (TB 74–5).
Does this mean there will never again be a Revelation equal
to or higher than Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation?

\[246\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

A. This is a very good question. If someone were to ask you how
it is possible that Bahá’u’lláh has made such a statement you
should not be surprised. I will give you simply my own personal
understanding of it. He speaks about the past and about the
future. Let me deal firstly with the past. All the past revelations
throughout the Adamic Cycle appeared during the time when
humanity was passing through the different stages of infancy,
childhood and adolescence. It had not yet reached the stage of
maturity. However, Bahá’u’lláh has come at a time when
humanity has organically come to a point of social, spiritual, and
intellectual maturity. It is during the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh
that the world will be organically united for the very first time,
and a global civilization will start to emerge. In the course of
future Dispensations, this maturity will be refined and perfected.

In a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, it says ‘Future
Prophets will bring us new laws suitable to our state of
development and continue to educate us on this planet, but they
will be under the shadow of Bahá’u’lláh for five thousand
centuries’ (HE 71). All the Manifestations, in the Bahá’í Cycle,
will come under the shadow of Bahá’u’lláh. They will not go
beyond planetary unity, which represents its social maturity. It is
the unique glory of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation that it marks the
beginning of mankind’s unity and solidarity.

Q. You stated that only the Head of the Faith can identify
Covenant-breakers, but with the passing of the Guardian
there was on the one hand the International Bahá’í Council
and on the other the Hands of the Cause. Who was then the
official Head of the Cause and therefore who had the
authority to identify Mason Remey’s secession?

A. Shortly before his passing on 4 November 1957, Shoghi
Effendi wrote a letter to the entire Bahá’í World. In this letter,
dated October 1957, the beloved Guardian speaks of the Hands
of the Faith as ‘one of the cardinal and pivotal institutions’,

designates them as ‘the Chief Stewards of Bahá’u’lláh’s
embryonic World Commonwealth’, and describes their ‘dual
function of guarding over the security, and of insuring the
propagation’ of the Faith (MBW 127). This letter gave the
Hands of the Cause the authority to take temporary leadership
after his passing.

There is another reference that gives the Hands a special
responsibility in matters relating to the protection of the Faith. In
the Will and Testament, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written: ‘My object is
to show that the Hands of the Cause of God must be ever
watchful and so soon as they find anyone beginning to oppose
and protest against the guardian of the Cause of God, cast him
out from the congregation of the people of Bahá and in no wise
accept any excuse from him . . . Should any, within or without the
company of the Hands of the Cause of God disobey and seek
division, the wrath of God and His vengeance will be upon him’
(WTA 12–13). You can be sure that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in His
superhuman wisdom, could foresee the future and wished to
ensure the protection of the Cause by granting the body of the
Hands this authority.

We must also take into consideration this passage from the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas: ‘Endowments dedicated to charity revert to God,
the Revealer of Signs. None hath the right to dispose of them
without leave from Him Who is the Dawning-place of Revelation.
After Him, this authority shall pass to the AghMán, and after them
to the House of Justice – should it be established in the world by
then – that they may use these endowments for the benefit of the
Places which have been exalted in this Cause, and for
whatsoever hath been enjoined upon them by Him Who is the
God of might and power. Otherwise, the endowments shall revert
to the people of Bahá who speak not except by His leave and
judge not save in accordance with what God hath decreed in this
Tablet’ (KA ¶42). This passage clearly makes reference to a
situation where the line of Aghṣán has ended and the Universal
House of Justice has not yet been formed. In such a case,

\[248\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

Bahá’u’lláh orders that authority will then be vested in the
‘people of Bahá who speak not except by His leave’. This
description is particularly applicable to the Hands of the Cause.

We come now to the International Bahá’í Council. This was
the precursor of the Universal House of Justice. It had a very
specific function given to it by the Guardian. The International
Bahá’í Council was charged with the duty to improve the legal
standing of the Faith in the Holy Land, to forge ties with the
government, and to assist in the construction of the Shrine of the
Báb. The International Bahá’í Council was never called the Chief
Steward of Bahá’u’lláh’s embryonic World Commonwealth, nor
was it told to be watchful of Covenant-breakers as stated in the
Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. It was clear and obvious to
the friends that the Hands of the Cause would be the Head of the
Faith during the interregnum period.

Q. Regarding: ‘those world-shaking, world-embracing, world-
directing administrative institutions, ordained by Bahá’u’lláh
and anticipated by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and which are to function in
consonance with the principles that govern the twin institutions
of the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice’ (TDH
46). What are the principles that govern the Guardianship
and the Universal House of Justice?

A. First, let us consider the principles that govern the Guardian-
ship. Shoghi Effendi once said that the primary work of the
Guardian was to promote the teaching work. And, of course, the
protection of the Cause was another of his primary functions.
These functions have not come to an end with the end of the
Guardianship. These functions have been carried on by the
Auxiliary Board members for protection and for propagation and
by the Continental Counsellors. The Universal House of Justice
has ensured that these functions will continue into the future.

Now, let us look at the principles that govern the Universal
House of Justice. The first aspect is the election process. Shoghi

Effendi says that in the future there will be no changes in the
election process of the Universal House of Justice, because the
process is laid down by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. This calls for the process
to pass through three stages: (1) the election of delegates, (2) the
election of the National Spiritual Assembly by the delegates, and
(3) the election of the Universal House of Justice by the National
Assemblies. It is envisioned that, in the future, this election
process will not be changed. In addition, the law of Bahá’í
consultation will remain as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá envisaged it.

The National Assemblies will become legislative institutions,
while they will have within their orbit an executive body and a
judicial branch. The same will apply to Local Assemblies. Apart
from the spiritual principles which are at the core of the
Administrative Order, the main organizational difference bet-
ween the modern, secular system of government and that of the
Bahá’í system of administration is that in secular governments
the head of the executive branch is the president or prime
minister of the country. Shoghi Effendi has described the
institutions of the world superstate in this order: first comes the
international executive, second is the world parliament and third
is the supreme tribunal (WOB 40). The world superstate will not
be a Bahá’í system. Compare this list of institutions to one
Shoghi Effendi used to describe the future Bahá’í World
Commonwealth: First comes the world legislature; second is the
world executive, whose function is to carry out the decisions
arrived and apply the laws enacted by the World Legislature;
third is the world tribunal (WOB 202). In the Golden Age, when
this Bahá’í World Commonwealth comes into being, the
legislature will be the head of state, and by this I mean that the
legislature will be the highest centre of authority. This is one of
the main distinctions of the Bahá’í system of government.

Another distinction is that the world legislature (the Univer-
sal House of Justice) will be small enough to make the decision-
making process quick and easy. Whereas the members of modern
parliaments can number many hundreds of people, Bahá’u’lláh

\[250\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

has written, ‘The Lord hath ordained that in every city a House
of Justice be established wherein shall gather counselors to the
number of Bahá, and should it exceed this number it doth not
matter’ (KA ¶30) In His interpretation of this verse, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá has said that the number of members of the Universal
House of Justice could be 19. This is a decision that only the
Universal House of Justice can take.

This will enable all of the members to consult quickly. I have
attended meetings with 18 people: for example meetings between
the House of Justice and the International Teaching Centre, and
the consultation is quite manageable.

Q. What is a pantheistic mindset? Does the present worship
of industrial objects, such as cars, have anything to do with
it? What is an anthropomorphic conception of God?

A. This question is referring to the statement in ‘The
Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh’: ‘So crude and fantastic a theory of
Divine incarnation is as removed from, and incompatible with,
the essentials of Bahá’í belief as are the no less inadmissible
pantheistic and anthropomorphic conceptions of God’ (WOB
112). According to a pantheistic theory, the sum total of
everything is God, and God is the sum total of everything. It is
also associated with the worship of many gods and false idols.
An pantheistic concept of God is that God is in everything. For
example, He is in a flower. Therefore, if you smother a flower,
you are killing God. If you cook a vegetable, you are cooking
God. Anthropomorphism is associated with attributing human
characteristics to God. If we were to believe that God has a
human body, then we would be holding an anthropomorphic
conception of God. Both anthropomorphism and pantheism are
unacceptable to Bahá’ís.

According to the Bahá’í teachings, God cannot be incarnated
into a human body. We do not agree with those Christians who
insist that Jesus was an incarnation of God, or that He is God ‘in

the flesh’. Shoghi Effendi says that the God who incarnates His
unknowable Essence into a human body would immediately
cease to be God.

What then is the relationship between God and His creation?

In Some Answered Questions, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has explained that
the Manifestations of God were divine Appearances, like the
image of God reflected in a perfect mirror. The rest of the
creation is an emanation from God. He gives an example of
emanation: a book emanates from a writer. The book is not an
incarnation or a manifestation of the writer, but it is created
through his power and bears the marks of his influence. This
answer is very brief, so you will have to carefully study the
writings to develop your understanding.

\[252\] VII
Shoghi Effendi’s writings in Persian/Arabic
As stated in Chapter II, the first Persian letter of the beloved
Guardian to the friends in Iran was dated 19 January 1922. As
was indicated in the Introduction, the number of his letters in
Persian and Arabic came to 12,308 communications. The total
number of pages as published by the National Spiritual Assem-
bly of Iran, several years ago, comes to 3,336. Some of the letters
are up to three pages long, while the longest, an abridgement of
God Passes By, is 197 pages. The rest of the letters are some-
where in between these two extremes in length. Of these, 830 are
letters addressed to the communities in the East in general.

In order to describe the general subjects that the Guardian
addressed in these letters (apart from the letters to individual
believers in which their personal questions were discussed), a list
has been prepared under the following headings: the Universal
House of Justice; Local and National Spiritual Assemblies;
teaching and the advancement of the Cause; opposition to the
Faith; the importance of historical sites and relics; historic
developments; obligations of individual Bahá’ís; clarification of
certain laws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and issues related to the Most
Holy Book; as well as other miscellaneous matters.

Set forth below are English versions of certain selected
passages from Shoghi Effendi’s letters in Persian/Arabic. These
renditions fall into three categories: authorized translations,

\[262\] WRITINGS IN PERSIAN AND ARABIC

authorized provisional translations, and free renditions. The free
renditions should not be regarded in the same light as the other
two categories. They have been put together for the benefit of
this course, in order to give us, in however narrow a compass, an
idea of the quality of Shoghi Effendi’s style when addressing the
friends in the East. In all cases, a note has been added to indicate
the nature of the translation in question.

> 1. [‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s] eyes are now directed towards His

> addressing the people of Bahá in this world of dust, and
> conveying to them these exhortations:

‘O my loved ones. Be not grieved and disturbed. Be not

> this Faith and in thraldom at His Threshold. Exert your
utmost and vie ye with each other.

‘Be not saddened by My passing, nor afraid and unsettled
> by reason of the changes and chances of this world and its
> ever-checkered conditions. Do not waver in the Cause of
> God. Ye are His hosts. Ye are the people of Bahá who are to

> tenacity, and be adorned with goodly deeds and the
> ornaments of purity and rectitude of conduct before the eyes
of all men.

‘Arise to champion the Faith of God and lead this
> sombre, this afflicted and agitated world to the climax of
> eternal glory, under the shadow of the Cause of God, and the
canopy of divine Salvation.

‘O my beloved friends. O staunch ones who have arisen
to follow Me! Be not lax or negligent after Me, and do not

His Cause, who will win the day in His holy Name.

‘Strive ye, therefore, and exert your high endeavours. I

And after completing their mission, they will hasten to
reach the shores of the Holy Land, will be privileged to
circumambulate the Holy Shrines in a spirit of humility,
submissiveness and lowliness, will raise their voices to the
heavens in praise, in glorification and celebration of their
blessings, and will convincingly demonstrate to the entire
world the validity and majesty of this Mighty Cause.

This is a standing promise, unfailing, unchanging and
immutable, as decreed by God, as it is irrevocably recorded
in His preserved Tablet. (February 1927, free rendition)

3\. Be well assured that, as the enemies of the Cause of God
will strive to oppose the Faith, its flame will be intensified
and its warmth and brightness will increase. The erudite and
intellectuals, who are carefully watching the progress of this
Cause and are investigating its aims, will never be influenced
or waver in their resolve, as a result of false reports and
futile, unfounded and conflicting accounts originating from
that land. They will never give up their search after truth,
nay, indeed they will only be led to deepen their study and
examination of the purposes of our Faith, its teachings and
principles so that they become fully aware of the essence of
the Cause of God. They will, as circumstances may indicate
and as guided by our All-Knowing and All-Powerful Lord,
arise to defend the Faith of God and ensure its triumph. They
will overcome the hosts of vain fancies and imaginings, will
destroy and uproot the edifice of falsehood and untruth and
will demonstrate, with sound evidence before the eyes of the
world, the purity, loftiness, power and reality of God’s
invincible Cause. (August 1927, free rendition)

O people of the earth! Be well-assured, and give ye
assurance to every hesitant doubter that whatsoever has been
revealed by the Pen of the Most High will come to pass and
shall eventually be made manifest, as clear as the sun in its
midday glory. In this snow-white spot, as well as in other
lands, through the direct and celestial operation of the Will
of the One Who spread the earth and upraised the Heavens,
the fondest desires of His lovers will be realized and will
emerge from behind seventy thousand veils.

Then will the longing of the people of Bahá be
consummated fully, impeccably and to perfection. This is
what our Lord has promised us, both implicitly and openly,
and this is a pledge which will not prove untrue. Arise,
therefore, and tell the unbelieving world: ‘Die ye in your
wrath! Ere long shall the ensigns of God’s Holy Cause be
raised in every city, and shed its radiance upon all regions.’

6\. The Lord of Hosts, the King of The throne of divine
Majesty, is calling from His Exalted Realm during this
spiritual spring time, this RiZván period, the supporters of
His Most Great Name, and addresses them with these words:

‘O ye My ardent lovers! O ye who have arisen to help My
Cause! O ye bearers of My trust among My creatures.
Hearken unto My call. I am Ever-living in My Realm of
Glory! O My friends, be ye aware of My presence.

‘You were quickened for the triumph of My Cause. I
chose you for Mine Own Self. I singled you out that ye may
attain true understanding. I reared you for the exaltation of
My Word. I raised you up for the proclamation of My Sove-
reignty. I made you spiritual leaders among My servants, and
heirs of My heritage.

‘Be patient, O My lovers, I will unveil to your eyes My
> Signs, will strengthen you with My confirmations, and will

worlds.

‘Help Me on My earth, that I may render you victorious
> in My Kingdom – a Kingdom lofty, exalted, luminous,
wondrous and sublime.

‘O ye who are the treasuries of the hidden and heavenly

Salutations and peace be upon the Centre of God’s
Covenant, His Most Great Branch, His immutable and
glorious Mystery, the Gulf that branched out of His Ancient
Ocean, the Exemplar of His teachings, the Being round
Whom all names revolve, He Whom God has purposed, the
Apple of the eye of Bahá, His trust amongst His people, the
Interpreter of His Revelation, the Stronghold and Shield of
His Cause, the Promoter of His Law, the Repository of His
hidden secrets, the Expounder of the principles of His Order,
the Standard of His victory, and He Who attired His head
with the crown of thraldom in servitude to God’s Holy
Cause.

Joy and light be upon God’s Holy ones, His Chosen ones,
Successors and the Arch-Promoters of His Cause, His
Testimonies, His Witnesses, the Chief guides of His com-
munity – they who were appointed by the Messengers and the
Prophets to execute Their laws, to interpret Their utterances,
to consolidate the foundations of God’s Faith, to render it
victorious, to exalt His Name, to spread His message, to
demonstrate His might, to demand and establish the rights of
His Cause and to neutralize the evil designs of His enemies
and opponents.

Remembrances and praise be upon the people of Bahá,
they that hold aloft the banner of His Faith, and dwell in His
Crimson Ark, upon His kindred, the Leaves and Off-shoots of
the Tree of Holiness, the Letters of His Book, the Hands of
His Cause, the summoners of the people to His Call, they
who are firm in His Covenant, hold fast unto the Cord of His
love, long to shed their blood in His path, spread the divine
fragrances and are the builders of the foundations of His
New World Order – an Order which is the child of His Law
and the fruit of a Divine Covenant which is eminently
glorious, exalted, holy, unassailable and unique. (Naw-Rúz

verdant plants and illumined with bright lights, which is the
object of the admiration of the people of this region and a
source of joy and pride to the authorities in this land, will
subsequently be converted, as foreshadowed by the Centre of
the Covenant, into the Pathway of the Kings and Rulers of
the World.

These mighty embodiments of kingly power, humble
pilgrims to the Sanctuary of the Lord, will, upon their arrival
in the Holy Land, first proceed to the Plain of ‘Akká, there to
visit and circumambulate the Qiblih of the People of Bahá,
the Point around which circle in adoration the Concourse on
High. They will then make their way to this august and
venerated city, and climb the slopes of Mount Carmel. With
the utmost rapture, ardour and devotion, they will hasten
towards this Sacred Spot and, with reverence and sub-
missiveness, humility and lowliness, ascend these terraces to
approach the luminous precincts of the sanctified and holy
Shrine. Reaching the threshold of the Sanctuary of Grandeur,
they will cast their crowns upon the ground, prostrate
themselves to kiss its fragrant earth and, circling around its
hallowed arcade, call out ‘Here am I, here am I, O Thou
Who art the Exalted, the Most Exalted One!’ and recite in
tones of fervent supplication the perspicuous Verses of the
Tablet of Carmel.

Thereafter they will walk over the spacious lawns and
through the wondrous gardens of this sublime and holy spot,
this garden of the Exalted Paradise, will inhale its fragrant
scents and taste of its choice and luscious fruits. They will,
with tearful eyes and burning hearts, call to mind the pain
and suffering, each affliction and calamity, the duress,
imprisonment and martyrdom which befell that Wronged One
of the world, will behold, with their own eyes, on every hand
in this exalted Spot, the glory of Carmel and the evidences of
the compelling might and greatness, the invincibility, the all-
encompassing dominion of the Conqueror of the worlds, and

of Glory as the ‘Heaven of heavens’, and looks toward the
Qiblih of the people of Bahá, that Spot within the vale of
security and peace, the plain of ‘Akká, round which circle in
adoration the Concourse on high. To her right are the hills of
Galilee in which nestles the childhood home of the beautiful
Christ, and the locality by the banks of the Jordan River
where He Who is the Spirit (Jesus Christ) was called to
prophethood; and on her left, on the crest of Carmel, are to
be found the Cave of Elijah and the exalted Spot which was
blessed by the footsteps of the Most Holy Abhá Beauty and
was ennobled through the revelation of the Tablet of Carmel
from the treasury of the Pen of Glory. Behind her stand the
twin Mounts of Zion and Olives and the holy and ancient city
of Jerusalem, within whose walls lie the site of the martyr-
dom and the burial place of Jesus Christ, the seat of the
Throne of David, the glorious Temple of Solomon and the
Aqsa Mosque which ranks third among the shrines of the
Islamic world. Beyond these there rises Mount Sinai, the
cradle of the Jewish Faith, that Sacred Mount, the Paran of
light, that holy land where He Who conversed with God
(Moses) heard the Voice from the Blessed Tree. And further
beyond lies the Arabian Peninsula, the land of Hijaz, the
cradle of the MuJammadan Dispensation, with the two cities
of Batha and Yathrib, the noble Mecca and the bright
Medina, one enshrining the Qiblih of Islam and the other
the Resting-place of Him Who is the Lord of mankind
(MuJammad) – upon Him be countless salutations and
praise.

High, immeasurably high, is this Shrine, the lofty, the
most great, the most wondrous. Exalted, immeasurably
exalted, is this Resting-place, the fragrant, the pure, the
luminous, the transcendent. Glorified, immeasurably glori-
fied, is this Spot, the most august, the most holy, the most
blessed, the most sublime. (Naw-Rúz 1952, authorized

Six of the paragraphs reproduced above (1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7)
are labelled as ‘free renditions’. These renditions are neither
‘authorized’ nor ‘provisional’ translations. They have been pre-
pared purely for the benefit of the participants of the course, and
therefore should be regarded as paraphrases, and not as regular,
quotable texts.

On five occasions during his ministry, Shoghi Effendi
addressed simultaneous and parallel messages to East and West.
These occasions were the passing of the Greatest Holy Leaf; the
Centenary of the Declaration of the Báb and the birth of the
Bahá’í Revelation; as well as the launching of the Ten Year Plan,
with an outline of its goals; and finally, the completion of the
superstructure of the Shrine of the Báb. The details of these
messages have not been reproduced in this summary.

Interspersed in his letters there are 20 prayers written by him,
some in English and others in Arabic. Two of these have been
given in the extracts above (no. 4 is in Persian, and no. 8 is in
Arabic). The latter comes at the end of his abridgement of God
Passes By. The abridgement itself begins with a preamble (no. 7)
in which he offers praise and thanksgiving to Almighty God, to
the Blessed Beauty, the Báb, all God’s Messengers, ‘Abdu’l-

Bahá, the appointed successors of God’s Manifestations, and
finally the rank and file of the believers.

After the conquest of Persia by the armies of Arabia, soon
after the passing of the Prophet Muḥammad, Arabic words were
gradually assimilated into the Persian language. Just as in the
case of the English language, with the introduction of French and
Latin words after the Norman conquest, the Persian vocabulary
was infinitely broadened and enriched by the addition of Arabic.
Shoghi Effendi’s style in his Persian letters clearly illustrates the
importance of the introduction of Arabic words into the Persian
vocabulary. In fact, in the course of explaining the intricacies of
the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, and so as to better express his
deepest, inner sentiments, we find him introducing rarely used
but easily understood Arabic words and terms into his phrases.
His style is thus given an elegant and elevated tone, while still
being perfectly comprehensible to the average Eastern reader. By
this method, he was able to convey his inspired insights and
wisdom through a language that is at once clear, powerful and
exquisitely beautiful.

Several unbiased Persian scholars who, in the past, were
shown examples of Shoghi Effendi’s writing style by the
Bahá’ís, spontaneously averred that his Persian composition was
equal if not superior to that of immortal Persian authors such as
Sa’di. As to his original and graceful penmanship in Persian and
Arabic, the style of calligraphy he chose was both legible and
pleasing to the eye. Rúḥíyyih Khánum makes the following
comment in The Priceless Pearl:

> There are a number of styles of calligraphy in Persian and
> Arabic but his is a variation of ‘Shikastih Nasta‘líq’. It has a
> charm and originality, a grace and strength all its own. One
> should remember that calligraphy was the highest of the
> graphic arts in Islamic countries and beautiful writing was
> the distinction par excellence for the cultivated man to

It must be made absolutely clear that the Guardian made no
effort to copy the unique styles of each of the Central Figures of
the Faith. Not only in his style of calligraphy, but in so many
other ways, such as his dress, demeanour, in choosing never to
occupy seats that Bahá’u’lláh or ‘Abdu’l-Bahá used during their
lifetimes, and even in avoiding the particular greetings his
Predecessors employed when welcoming the pilgrims, Shoghi
Effendi wanted emphatically to show that his station was in no
way comparable to those before him, and that indeed he was
under their shadow.

Q. What were the predictions of A%mad-i-A%sá’í?

A. This question is about the references made by Shoghi Effendi
to the allusions made by Shaykh Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í in his writings
(CF 101). Bahá’u’lláh was born in Tehran on 12 November
1817\. That very night, according to Nabíl’s Narrative, Shaykh
Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í was staying in Tehran as a guest of the Shah. He
was requested by one of the princes to proceed to Kirmánsháh.
But the Shaykh was aware of the significance of what had
happened in Tehran. He didn’t want to leave but he resigned
himself to God’s will and left. Before he left, it is written, he
uttered a prayer that the Hidden Treasure Who had been born
would be cherished by the people of Tehran. This story shows
the intuition which the Shaykh had about the coming of the
Promised One. However, the prediction which is mentioned in
Citadel of Faith and in God Passes By is more important. In one
of his epistles to Siyyid Ká`im, Shaykh Aḥmad has written ‘The
mystery of this Cause must needs be made manifest, and the
secret of this Message must needs be divulged. I can say no
more. I can appoint no time. His Cause will be made known after
Kín (68)’ (GPB 92–3). In the original language, the final
sentence has the meaning ‘His Cause will be made know after a
while’. However, according to Abjad numerology, the word ‘hin’
has a numerical value of 68. Therefore, ‘after Hin’ refers to the
year 69. According to the Hijrah calendar, the next year 69
would be 1269 (1852–3). It was quite clear that Shaykh Aḥmad
was making the prediction that the Promised One would appear
in the year 1852–3. It was in this year that Bahá’u’lláh received
the first intimations of His Revelation, while lying in chains in
the Síyáh-Chál.

Another of the predictions of Shaykh Aḥmad is alluded to in
the verse of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas: ‘Behold, the “mystery of the
Great Reversal in the Sign of the Sovereign” hath now been

\[280\] WRITINGS IN PERSIAN AND ARABIC

made manifest’ (KA ¶157). In his writings, Shaykh Aḥmad had
said that at the time of the Promised One all things would be
reversed. It is just like what Christ has said ‘But many that are
first shall be last; and the last first’ (Mark 10: 31). It means that
those who are downtrodden will be raised to glory and vice
versa. In fact, the latter part of the verse in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
corroborates this interpretation: ‘How many the outwardly pious
who have turned away, and how many the wayward who have
drawn nigh . . .’ (KA ¶157) It is exactly what happened in every
Dispensation. But in the Bahá’í Dispensation, it is even more
dramatic than it was before, because now it is on a universal
level.

Q. What is the meaning of the ‘nine concentric circles’? Is
this a fulfilment of a prophecy or is it a symbol?

A. It is a symbol. The ‘nine concentric circles’ is a concept that
Shoghi Effendi developed himself, in his English and Persian
writings. In my opinion, Shoghi Effendi wanted to emphasize the
importance of the Shrine of the Báb. In another of his letters he
says something that seems extremely strange, that the Shrine of
the Báb is the cornerstone of the Universal House of Justice. It is
very clear that the most sacred spot on earth is not the Shrine of
the Báb; it is the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. Quite often Shoghi
Effendi explained that the Shrine of the Báb was under the
shadow of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. By this he implied that the
Universal House of Justice, the head cornerstone of which is the
Shrine of the Báb, and indeed all of the administrative institu-
tions, consisting of the entire series of buildings around the Arc,
all are under the shadow of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh.

Q. What does the Crimson Ark refer to in the Writings?

A. The Crimson Ark in the quotation refers to the Cause of God;
crimson, because we have had martyrs.

Q. ‘These mighty embodiments of kingly power, humble
pilgrims to the Sanctuary of the Lord, will, upon their arrival in
the Holy Land, first proceed to the Plain of ‘Akká, there to visit
and circumambulate the Qiblih of the People of Bahá . . .’
(Naw-Rúz 1952). When is this going to happen?

A. Nobody knows. However, I don’t think they are all going to
come together, at once. When the Bahá’í Faith becomes the
established religion in a country, the head of state, whether he is
a king, a president, or whatever, will also probably be a Bahá’í.
This process won’t happen all at once, but gradually, one at a
time. I don’t think the time will ever come when the House of
Justice will make it a goal of one of its plans to have a head of
state become a Bahá’í and come on pilgrimage. It is a prediction
based on the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

Q. Mount Carmel is ordained to be the spot for the
emergence of three central institutions of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh: the Báb’s Shrine, the Dayspring of Lights; the
Mashriqu’l-Adhkár, the Dawning Place of His praise; and
the World Administrative Seat of the Bahá’í world
community, the Pivotal Centre to which all much turn. Why
is so much weight given to Mount Carmel? Why isn’t the
Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh the spot for the emergence of these
institutions? Why is not the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh the centre
of the nine concentric circles?

A. First of all, Mount Carmel is specifically mentioned in the
Old Testament. Also, Isaiah refers to a mountain towards which
all the nations of the world will move, to which all the kings and
rulers of the earth will turn. Apart from Isaiah’s prophecy,
Bahá’u’lláh Himself came to this mountain and revealed the
Tablet of Carmel. That was on the head of the mountain, near the
Catholic monastery, where the Temple land is. The Tablet of
Carmel has been called the Charter for the development of the

\[282\] WRITINGS IN PERSIAN AND ARABIC

Faith at the World Centre. In it, Bahá’u’lláh foresees that the
remains of the Báb would be interred in that Mountain. In the
same Tablet, He ordained that the Administrative Centre of the
Faith should be on Mount Carmel.

Nevertheless, the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh is the Most Holy, the
Most Sacred Shrine on the planet. And, as I stated before, the
Shrine of the Báb and the World Administrative Centre are under
the shadow of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. Blessed are those who
are able to visit that Shrine. In this day we are permitted to enter
the Shrine – what a blessing this is! Do you think, when millions
and billions will become Bahá’ís, that it will be possible to enter
that Shrine or the Shrine of the Báb? They will have to satisfy
themselves with circumambulation, while visiting the Shrines
from outside. Such will be the majesty of the Faith in the future.

Q. Why did the International Bahá’í Council have women on
it, if the Guardian envisioned it as the precursor to the House
of Justice? Will future Manifestations of God change the
laws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and allow women to sit on the
Universal House of Justice?

A. The International Bahá’í Council was a very important
institution. Its members represented Shoghi Effendi on their
visits to Jerusalem. This institution had a representative of the
Guardian, a president, a vice-president, a member at large, a
secretary-general, a treasurer and two assistant secretaries, one
for the East and one for the West. It had its own letterhead.
Shoghi Effendi assigned the building at 10 Haparsim Street,
Haifa, to be the seat of the International Bahá’í Council and he
put an appropriate sign outside the door of the building.

However, the Council was not the Universal House of
Justice. As you know, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written, ‘The House of
Justice, however, according to the explicit text of the Law of
God, is confined to men; this for a wisdom of the Lord God’s,
which will ere long be made manifest as clearly as the sun at

high noon’ (Sels 79). According to the principle of the equality
of the sexes, Shoghi Effendi saw no reason why the membership
of the precursor to the House of Justice should be confined to
men.

It would be possible for future Manifestations of God to
allow the membership of the Universal House of Justice to
include women. Shoghi Effendi has written, in a letter to the
Bahá’ís of the East, that the next Manifestation of God will be
empowered to change the laws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and to
change the structure of the Administrative Order of the Faith. We
are not told what changes He will make, but He certainly will
have that authority.

Q. What is or was the Nawnahálán Company?

A. Nawnahálán is a Persian word which means ‘children’.
Shoghi Effendi refers to this company in God Passes By, but he
uses the name ‘the children’s Savings Bank’ (GPB 342). In Iran
it was referred to as the Nawnahálán Company. It was initiated
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He made the initial contribution that became
the basis on which to build this Savings Bank. Violette and I had
shares in this company. When we went to our children’s classes
we would have the opportunity to buy some little shares, and
gradually we would build them up. At the end of the year they
would give us dividends based on how much profit the Bank had
made. Often we would just use the dividends to buy more shares!
And if anyone wanted to get their money back, they could sell
the shares. It was no problem at all. When the children grew up
they would often withdraw the whole lot so that they could pay
for their education or for other purposes.

Unfortunately, after the revolution in Iran the entire company
was confiscated, along with all its shares. Those of us who still
had shares lost them all. Many other things were confiscated as
well, such as sacred and historic sites, local centres, even
cemeteries and a lot of personal assets. It is hoped that in the

\[284\] WRITINGS IN PERSIAN AND ARABIC

future all these things will be recovered. When the Bahá’ís have
their rights restored, they should be able to receive compensation
for what has been confiscated, including the assets of the
Nawnahálán Company.

Q. You have said that, in his Persian writings, Shoghi Effendi
described the Shrine of the Báb as the head cornerstone of
the Universal House of Justice. Why is not the Shrine of
Bahá’u’lláh the head cornerstone?

A. We have to refer in this case to the Tablet of Carmel. For a
long time, none of the Bahá’ís fully understood the meaning of
many of the references in this Tablet. We knew that it was very
important, because it was one of the few Tablets that ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and Shoghi Effendi often encouraged the friends to
memorize. It was not until towards the end of his life that Shoghi
Effendi began to explain its meaning. He said that the Tablet of
Carmel provides the Faith with two Centres; one spiritual and
one administrative. The spiritual centre is the Shrine of the Báb,
referred to as the ‘celestial Kaaba’. The administrative centre is
the Universal House of Justice and its administrative institutions.
The House of Justice is referred to as the ‘Ark’ that God will sail
upon Mount Carmel. ‘The people of Bahá’ (TB 4–5) mentioned
in the Tablet are the members of the Universal House of Justice.
Shoghi Effendi personally explained these things to the members
of the International Bahá’í Council. The Council then wrote a
letter to the Bahá’í world to spread the news of this inter-
pretation. The letter was fully approved by Shoghi Effendi and it
was published in The Bahá’í World, Vol. XII.

As for the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh; its station is even higher
than that of the Shrine of the Báb. As already stated, the Shrine
of the Báb and the administrative institutions on Mount Carmel
are all under the shadow of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. The Shrine
of Bahá’u’lláh is the most sacred spot on earth.

VIII
Shoghi Effendi’s style
A. Writing style in English

Amatu’l-Bahá Rúḥíyyih Khánum, in The Priceless Pearl, draws
our attention to the fact that: ‘Unlike so many people Shoghi
Effendi wrote what he meant and meant exactly what he wrote’
(PP 196). She further writes: ‘In an age when people play
football with words, kicking them right and left indiscriminately
with no respect for either their meaning or correct usage, the
style of Shoghi Effendi stands out in dazzling beauty . . . It is
impossible to eliminate any word from one of his sentences
without sacrificing part of the meaning, so concise, so pithy is
his style’ (PP 196). It is difficult to find such an appropriate
description of Shoghi Effendi’s style as has been so charmingly
identified by one who was not only his consort but his secretary
as well, and bore heroically the load of onerous duties that the
beloved Guardian placed on her shoulders.

It would be illuminating to read her other comments on this
subject:

\[288\] SHOGHI EFFENDI’S STYLE

From the beginning of my life with the Guardian until the
end, I was almost always present when he translated or wrote
his books, long letters and cables in English. There was
nothing unusual in this; he liked to have someone in the room
on these occasions to listen to what he was writing. His
method of composition was new and fascinating to me. He
wrote out loud, speaking the words as he put them down. I
think this habit in English was carried over from Persian . . . I
believe it is because of this that even his long and involved
sentences sound even more flowing and intelligible when
read aloud. The length of some of these sentences was at
times a cause of comment on my part; Shoghi Effendi would
raise his head and look at me, with those wonderful eyes
whose colour and expression changed so frequently, with a
hint of defiance and rebelliousness in them – but did not
shorten his sentence! I can recall only one occasion when he
admitted, ruefully, that it was a long sentence; but he still did
not change it. It said what he wanted it to as he wanted it to;
it was too bad it was so long. On the other hand he liked to
use a structure sometimes of very short sentences that
followed each other one after the other like the cracks of a
whip. He would call my attention to this variation in style,
pointing out how each method was effective, how the
combination of the two enriched the whole and achieved
different ends. (PP 197)

He was very fond of the device of alliteration, much used in
oriental languages but now no longer so common in English.
An excellent example of his use of this is provided by this
sentence reiterating words beginning with ‘p’ from one of his
cables: ‘Time pressing opportunity priceless potent aid
providentially promised unfailing.’ (PP 197–8)

Shoghi Effendi’s method of composition was like that of a
mosaic artist at work, who creates his picture with clearly

> defined and separate pieces; each word had its own place and
> if he struck a difficult sentence he would not change it
> around so as to accommodate a thought that grammatically
> could not fit into the sentence structure but would stick to it,
> sometimes literally for hours, until I at least was worn out by
> his verbal repetition of the phrase as he battled to subjugate it
> and fit it in the way he wished to, trying one piece of his
> mosaic after another, until he had solved his problem. I
> seldom remember his ever abandoning a sentence and
> starting over in a new form. (PP 198)

> The Guardian’s method of writing was interesting: he did not
> like large pieces of paper and usually wrote all his books and
> long communications on small lined pads. He did all his
> composition by hand; if the first draft was too written-over he
> sat down patiently and copied it all over. He typed, on a very
> small portable machine, by the two-finger method, all his
> own manuscripts, making any further changes as he went
> along. It is not surprising therefore that by this method he
> should have produced such highly polished works as we have
> from his pen. (PP 201–2)

One of my associates, for whose prowess in expressing
himself in elegant English I have high regard, wrote the
following about Shoghi Effendi’s style: ‘In most general terms it
may be said that the hallmark of the Guardian’s English is the
perfect blend it effects between a comprehensive knowledge of
the subject matter on the one hand, and a consummate mastery of
the language in which this is to be expressed on the other. Had
either of these been lacking, then it might truly be said that he
could not have achieved the level of excellence that he did . . .
[T]he writings of Shoghi Effendi . . . although they might appear
to some expansive, are in fact, considering the sheer vastness and
variety of the subjects dealt with, models of concision and
compression . . . [W]hat one surveys in looking at the writings of

\[290\] SHOGHI EFFENDI’S STYLE

Shoghi Effendi is not so much a particular style of English on a
par with many others; but rather the English language used to the
very height of its capacity, and with a level of mastery so
consummate as to constitute a testimony to the truth of this
Revelation.’

Comparing such writers as Gibbon, whose English style
Shoghi Effendi greatly admired, with that of the Guardian, my
correspondent further writes:

. . . [W]hereas the carefully wrought prose of the latter
> (Gibbon), for all its lapidary precision, is of a dry,
> sophisticated and slightly world-weary nature, that of the
> Guardian by contrast is brimful of vitality, enthusiasm, and
> redemptive affirmation . . . Intimately connected with the
> impalpably life-affirming, spiritual, and poetic qualities of
> the Guardian’s writings, is their immensely energizing,
> vitalizing and stimulating effect upon the reader, who,
> provided he approach them in the correct deferential and
> receptive spirit, cannot help but little by little feel his heart
> uplifted, his imagination fired, and even his pulse slightly
> quickened, as the sheer magnitude of the vision they unfold,
> imparted to some degree by every sentence, becomes
> apparent . . . (MH 4/12/05)

The longest letter Shoghi Effendi wrote during the first 11

years of his ministry was his tribute to his Great Aunt, the
Greatest Holy Leaf. It ran over nine pages of the compilation of
his letters published in 1933. The passing of the Greatest Holy
Leaf, as well as the ascension of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, were two events
that caused devastating grief to the heart of the beloved
Guardian. It is indeed more than coincidental, and perhaps
providential, that Shoghi Effendi was absent at the times of the
funerals of these two members of his family, who towered over
all the rest in rank and spirituality. Indeed, it could be said that

although the natural parents of Shoghi Effendi were present
throughout his childhood and beyond, his true spiritual parents
were ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Bahíyyih Khánum.

In 1921, when the Master passed away, Shoghi Effendi was
just embarking, at the youthful age of 24, on his mission as Head
of the Faith, and may have been understandably diffident in
expressing the full scope of his poignant sorrow. However, in
1932, when the Greatest Holy Leaf passed on, he allowed
himself full rein in the expression of his emotions, and freely
used the potency of his literary gift:

> How can my lonely pen, so utterly inadequate to glorify so
> exalted a station, so impotent to portray the experiences of so
> sublime a life, so disqualified to recount the blessings she
> showered upon me since my earliest childhood – how can
> such a pen repay the great debt of gratitude and love that I
> owe her whom I regarded as my chief sustainer, my most
> affectionate comforter, the joy and inspiration of my life? My
> grief is too immense, my remorse too profound, to be able to
> give full vent at this moment to the feelings that surge within
> me. (BA 187)

At the end of his letter he addresses a plea to the departed soul of
the Greatest Holy Leaf in these moving words:

> Dearly-beloved Greatest Holy Leaf! Through the mist of
> tears that fill my eyes I can clearly see, as I pen these lines,
> thy noble figure before me, and can recognize the serenity of
> thy kindly face. I can still gaze, though the shadow of the
> grave separate us, into thy blue, love-deep eyes, and can feel,
> in its calm intensity, the immense love thou didst bear for the
> Cause of thine Almighty Father, the attachment that bound
> thee to the most lowly and insignificant among its followers,
> the warm affection thou didst cherish for me in thine heart.

The memory of the ineffable beauty of thy smile shall ever

\[292\] SHOGHI EFFENDI’S STYLE

continue to cheer and hearten me in the thorny path I am
destined to pursue. The remembrance of the touch of thine
hand shall spur me on to follow steadfastly in thy way. The
sweet magic of thy voice shall remind me, when the hour of
adversity is at its darkest, to hold fast to the rope thou didst
seize so firmly all the days of thy life.

Bear thou this my message to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, thine exalted
and divinely-appointed Brother: If the Cause for which
Bahá’u’lláh toiled and labored, for which Thou didst suffer
years of agonizing sorrow, for the sake of which streams of
sacred blood have flowed, should, in the days to come,
encounter storms more severe than those it has already
weathered, do Thou continue to overshadow, with Thine all-
encompassing care and wisdom, Thy frail, Thy unworthy
appointed child.

Intercede, O noble and well-favoured scion of a heavenly
Father, for me no less than for the toiling masses of Thy
ardent lovers, who have sworn undying allegiance to Thy
memory, whose souls have been nourished by the energies of
Thy love, whose conduct has been moulded by the inspir-
ing example of Thy life, and whose imaginations are fired
by the imperishable evidences of Thy lively faith, Thy
unshakable constancy, Thy invincible heroism, Thy great
renunciation.

Whatever betide us, however distressing the vicissitudes
which the nascent Faith of God may yet experience, we
pledge ourselves, before the mercy-seat of thy glorious
Father, to hand on, unimpaired and undivided, to
generations yet unborn, the glory of that tradition of which
thou hast been its most brilliant exemplar.

In the innermost recesses of our hearts, O thou exalted
Leaf of the Abhá Paradise, we have reared for thee a shining
mansion that the hand of time can never undermine, a shrine
which shall frame eternally the matchless beauty of thy

> countenance, an altar whereon the fire of thy consuming love
> shall burn forever. (BA 194)

How can one remain insensible after reading such a soul-
stirring call! The American National Spiritual Assembly, having
received this letter, chose to produce a photocopied version of
the original in the handwriting of the beloved Guardian, so that
the friends everywhere would have access not only to a full
account of the life and work of one who was the heroine of the
Bahá’í Dispensation, but also to appreciate the degree of
heartbreak that afflicted Shoghi Effendi.

Before we end this section, a few minor points regarding
Shoghi Effendi’s writing style need to be addressed. It is often
forgotten that the titles used in the publication of the Guardian’s
letters were not always chosen by Shoghi Effendi himself. Most
of these titles were added by Horace Holley, who served as
Secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States
and Canada during the ministry of Shoghi Effendi. Holley also
inserted subtitles in the texts. Rúḥíyyih Khánum writes: ‘Horace
was a writer himself, and the titles he gave to the Guardian’s
communications not only served to identify them but dramatized
their message and captured the imagination’ (PP 205). She
further writes that Horace Holley, when inserting these titles,
picked up ‘phrases in the writing of the Guardian which were
most descriptive of the general subject’ (PP 205).

Another feature of the Guardian’s works (with the exception
of Nabíl’s Narrative) is the total absence of footnotes. He was
quite often quoting from Tablets revealed by the Central Figures
of the Faith, which had not yet been translated and published. It
is left to future scholars of the Faith to research these references
and, with the approval of the Universal House of Justice, add
them to the text. I have already commented on one footnote in
the Book of Certitude.

As to the cabled messages he sent to the Bahá’í world,
Rúḥíyyih Khánum has given us the following insight:

\[294\] SHOGHI EFFENDI’S STYLE

> Since the inception of his ministry Shoghi Effendi had
> increasingly used the medium of telegrams and cablegrams,
> not only because they saved time but because, as he
> explained to me, of their psychological effect; a cable
> conveys a sense of urgency and drama and is often a better
> way of driving home one’s point. Shoghi Effendi developed
> what one might call the language of cables to such a high
> degree that they became a literary accomplishment. Not
> infrequently he sent cables the length of letters. He thought in
> the abbreviated form when he wrote them. It was not a
> question of expressing a thought in the normal style of
> composition and then eliminating all the words that could be
> left out and still convey the meaning; from the beginning he
> did not think those words into his text at all and thus the style
> is very graphic, powerful and dramatic. (PP 225–6)

These cables were published in the American Bahá’í News,
and the National Office would insert words to make the text
more understandable to the readers. Quite often, when Shoghi
Effendi would read these inserted words, he would find that they
misrepresented his intention. He had to then write to the National
Assembly requesting them to make the necessary corrections,
which were subsequently published in the same bulletin. This
clearly shows his meticulous care in ensuring that his meaning
was conveyed correctly to the friends.

Another point regarding cables sent by him is that he
invariably omitted the closing greeting, and simply signed his
name. Sometimes he used his full name, Shoghi Rabbani,
possibly for security requirements during the war years.

B. Comparison of his English and Persian writings

In previous sections we dealt separately with Shoghi Effendi’s
writing styles in Persian/Arabic and in English. They are
certainly similar in their distinctiveness, their clarity, the elevated

character of their tone, their precision, systematic orderliness,
intellectual reasoning, exquisite beauty and fervency of appeal.
Shoghi Effendi has handed down to generations yet unborn a
matchless heritage of dissertations on the fundamental teachings
of the Faith, salient features of Bahá’í history, soul-entrancing
disclosures of the vision of Bahá’u’lláh about the destiny of His
Faith, and glimpses of the glory of the future Bahá’í World
Commonwealth.

There are unique concepts in the Guardian’s writings which
cannot readily be found in the Writings of the Founders of the
Faith, although the roots of his exposition can always be traced
back to the utterances of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. A few
of the startling subjects disclosed by the pen of Shoghi Effendi
are the following:

1\. The seven stages that national communities will experience

> as the Faith passes from obscurity to formal recognition,
> establishment and supremacy in their lands.

2\. The distinction between the Bahá’í Cycle and the Bahá’í

> Dispensation, the three Ages of that Dispensation, and the
> division of each Age into epochs, and epochs into phases.

3\. The need for every National Assembly to have a teaching and

> consolidation plan, and to adopt goals and objectives under
> the overall umbrella of the international plans formulated by
> the Head of the Faith.

4\. The concept of the nine concentric circles which surround the

> sacred dust of the Holy of Holies, namely the sanctified
> remains of the Blessed Báb. The first circle is the planet
> itself. The subsequent inner circles are the Holy Land, Mount
> Carmel, the properties owned by the Faith on that mountain,
> the gardens immediately adjacent to the Shrine, the domed

Regarding the tenor of the Guardian’s communications with
the East, several important points need to be remembered:

1\. The friends in the East were generally reared on the

> importance of the fulfilment of prophecies, the need to abide
> by the laws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, and the requirements of the
> teaching work. They were groomed to pursue these avenues
> and live the Bahá’í life in the hope that the Promised Dawn
> will break. They had very little experience in the conduct of
> their administrative affairs, because the institutions of the
> Faith in their countries were at a lamentably rudimentary
> stage. One of the main concerns of Shoghi Effendi therefore
> was to educate them in the administrative principles of the
> Faith, and in the creation and operation of both local and
> national institutions and their attendant agencies. In his
> letters he gave them the broad outline of the Bahá’í system of
> administration, but repeatedly called on them to follow the
model which was being carefully implemented in the West,

> more particularly in North America. He insisted that the
> Spiritual Assemblies have properly formulated constitutions
> and by-laws, and that these should follow the pattern that had
> been already established in America.

2\. In view of the persecution suffered by the friends in the East

> by reason of the constant incitements of the Muslim clergy
> and the abject indifference of the civil authorities, who
> refused to openly defend and protect the legitimate rights of
> the Bahá’ís, Shoghi Effendi had to counsel them to be firm
> and steadfast, even in the face of imprisonment, confiscation
> of properties, and martyrdom. He advised them to avoid
> becoming involved directly or indirectly, individually or
> institutionally, with any political activity, to obey in adminis-
> trative matters the regulations and restrictions imposed on
> them, to make efforts to obtain from the authorities gradual
> relaxation of these restrictions, and finally to place their trust
> in the promises of Bahá’u’lláh, Who anticipated not only the
> emancipation of the Faith but also its attainment to supreme
> glory in the land of its birth.

3\. While in the West, in view of the relative freedom enjoyed

> by individual citizens and minority groups, Shoghi Effendi
> had no reservation in writing to the friends about the vision
> of Bahá’u’lláh for the future World Order, he was deliber-
> ately cautious in unveiling this vision in great detail to the
> communities in the East. The first time he engaged in such
> expositions in Persian/Arabic was when he wrote his
> abridgement of God Passes By in 1944. It was then that he
> briefly expounded on the features of the Divine Order
> enshrined in the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh.

4\. In his letters to the West, Shoghi Effendi usually addressed

> the recipients in such phrases as, ‘To the beloved of the Lord
> and the handmaids of the Merciful, throughout . . .’. In his

\[298\] SHOGHI EFFENDI’S STYLE

> Persian letters however, he was more elaborate and
> descriptive of the condition of the Bahá’í communities in
> eastern lands. Included below are some free renditions of the
> way he addressed the friends in the East:

O ye the oppressed ones in the path of the Lord, who
> have remained steadfast in His Covenant and who are
> builders of the pillars of His luminous and excellent Order.

O burning torches of love and affection! I send you my
> salutations from this sacred, luminous and radiant Spot. Your
> loving memory is always on my mind, filled as I am with joy
> as I receive your glad tidings. I rejoice at the vastness of
> your services, remember you in my prayers, and seek for
> every one of you perpetual confirmations from the Kingdom
> of Lights.

5\. Another distinction is that in some of his letters, after such

> opening phrases as quoted above, he would begin with a
> preamble in which he would extol the Blessed Beauty, or the
> Master, or in general the Concourse on High. A typical
> example is the preamble to his abridgement of God Passes
> By in Persian. This appears in its free rendition form as
> extract no. 7 in our section dealing with Persian letters.

6\. In a few of his letters to the East, Shoghi Effendi felt free to

> directly invoke the Voice of Bahá’u’lláh or ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, as
> if they were addressing the friends at the very moment of his
> writing. Two free renditions of such passages appear under
> nos. 6 and 1 of the examples given in the Persian letters
> section.

7\. Yet another point is worthy of consideration. At times at the

> beginning of a letter to the East, and quite often at the end, he
would include an entreaty which was clearly not intended to

> become part of the regular repertory of Bahá’í prayers. He
> considered these more as supplications of his own, turning
> his heart to the Realms Above, referring to the state of the
> oppressed community of the Orient, and seeking divine
> assistance in the execution of the tasks ahead. Two such
> examples have been included in the list of provisional
> translations in the section on Persian letters.

Undoubtedly, in future years, the day will come when the
Universal House of Justice will make available to the friends in
the West authorized translations of Shoghi Effendi’s immortal
writings in the Persian and Arabic tongues.

\[300\] SHOGHI EFFENDI’S STYLE

Q. Why is it that, for over 80 years now, the writings of
Shoghi Effendi and of the Universal House of Justice have
conveyed a constant feeling of urgency? Is every day really a
critical moment in the life of the Faith?

A. That is a very good question! It signifies growth. The Faith is
a living organism. Every day, every moment counts. Every turn
of events is critical. It’s like when we have an infant, every day
in the life of this infant is critical. Just like Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and Shoghi Effendi, the Universal House of Justice looks at
the Faith as a living organism. They tell us that the time is
critical. They ask us to support matters that are very important at
every stage in the evolution of our Faith. The Faith is always
growing. It is not a dead or stagnant thing. It is a developing,
living organism. Every stage in its development is critical.

Q. Shoghi Effendi, when writing to the Bahá’ís of the East,
sometimes expresses thoughts in a form of prayer, or by
saying that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is now addressing the people of
Bahá. How should we consider these? Are these prayers?
Can we say that the Guardian wrote prayers?

A. Shoghi Effendi did not want the friends to consider what he
wrote, in the form of prayer, as prayers to be read on different
occasions or to be included in prayer books. He always described
what he had written in the form of prayer as a supplication: a
supplication rising from his own heart about the condition of the
community at that time, and asking Bahá’u’lláh for the removal
of difficulties, to help the Bahá’ís to arise and carry out the
wishes as expressed by Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. So, out of
respect for him. the House of Justice has decided that we should
not include these supplications in our prayer books at this time.

Regarding the second part of the question, I have given you
two examples in the material. In one, Shoghi Effendi transmits a
message from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the Bahá’ís, and in the second he
transmits a message from Bahá’u’lláh. This is something
peculiar to the writings of Shoghi Effendi addressed to the
friends in the East. He has not repeated this method of addressing
the friends in his letters to the West, with one exception. In ‘The
World Order of Bahá’u’lláh’, he communicates a message from
‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the friends. The way he expresses it is, ‘We can
dimly picture to ourselves the wishes that must have welled from
His eager heart as He bade His last farewell to that promising
country. An inscrutable Wisdom, we can well imagine Him
remark to His disciples on the eve of His departure, has, in His
infinite bounty . . .’ (WOB 86).

Q. ‘In the innermost recesses of our hearts, O thou exalted
Leaf of the Abhá Paradise, we have reared for thee a shining
mansion that the hand of time can never undermine, a shrine
which shall frame eternally the matchless beauty of thy
countenance, an altar whereon the fire of thy consuming love
shall burn forever’ (BA 194). Is this mansion purely symbolic,
or is it also a reference to the monument Shoghi Effendi built
over the resting-place of the Greatest Holy Leaf?

A. I think there is no question that it is a symbolic mansion
which we must have in our hearts for the Greatest Holy Leaf.

Q. The Guardian insisted that Spiritual Assemblies have a
constitution and by-laws. What does this mean for Local and
National Assemblies in this day?

A. When Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice
refer to the constitution of a National or Local Assembly, they
refer to a special document that exists. There is a model
document entitled ‘Declaration of Trust and By-laws of a

\[302\] SHOGHI EFFENDI’S STYLE

National Spiritual Assembly’. This document has been published
in The Bahá’í World, in volumes up to Vol. XX. After Vol. XX
the Universal House of Justice decided to bring out an annual
edition of The Bahá’í World, and these later volumes do not
contain that document. I think it first appeared in Vol. VI or VII.
It was the wish of Shoghi Effendi, and it is the current wish of
the Universal House of Justice, that every National Assembly
should adopt this document as its constitution. When a National
Assembly is seeking to become incorporated, the government, by
virtue of legal requirements of the country, may suggest some
changes to the constitution, but these changes are to be kept to an
absolute minimum.

There is another, much shorter, document called ‘By-laws of
a Local Spiritual Assembly’, which can also be found in those
same volumes of The Bahá’í World. Again, it is the hope of the
House of Justice that Local Assemblies, when incorporated, will
adhere to this model as closely as possible.

Q. You said that Shoghi Effendi invariably omitted the
closing greetings in his cables. Was this for financial reasons,
since every word had to be paid for?

A. I really don’t know why Shoghi Effendi did not include ‘Your
true brother’ or some other greeting at the end of his cables.
Cables are very expensive, so usually the sender would try to be
as brief as possible. That may well have been the reason, but we
can’t be sure.

In 1951 Shoghi Effendi reopened the doors to pilgrimage to
the World Centre, after the disturbances in Israel had lessened.
As soon as this message from the Guardian was announced, one
of the American Bahá’ís wrote him a letter in which he
expressed his longing to go on pilgrimage. Then he waited for
a reply. He left instructions at the post office of his town that if
anything was received by cable from Haifa, they should phone
him immediately and not wait to deliver the cable to his house.

About a week later he received a phone call informing him that
a cable had arrived from Haifa. While on the phone he said
that he had to go and get a pen and paper. So the official on the
other side waited. He went and got some paper, and when he
returned to the phone he said: ‘Yes, go ahead!’ and the clerk
replied: ‘Welcome. Shoghi.’ That was all! He had expected
a long message, but in cablese, briefness was Shoghi Effendi’s
practice.

Q. Why was Shoghi Effendi so reserved about writing to the
Persian believers about his vision of the future World Order
of Bahá’u’lláh?

A. Between 1921 and 1944, in his letters to the West, Shoghi
Effendi opened the eyes of the friends to the glory of
Bahá’u’lláh’s future World Order. However, he did not write
about this subject in his Persian and Arabic writings. It must be
said, a few of the friends in the East were quite aware of what he
was writing to the West. Shoghi Effendi encouraged the Iranian
Bahá’ís to learn English and to read his writings and to have
classes on them.

In my own personal opinion, I think he was waiting for the
conditions in the East to change. He wanted to wait until there
was greater enlightenment and liberality in the country. Between
1921 and 1944 there were many changes in Iran, and many more
people started to receive second level education, and even third
level, too. This brought the country out of its dark ages, if you
will. If he had started writing to them about the World Order in
1921, it would have probably been totally misinterpreted by the
Persian government. They would have accused the Bahá’ís of
trying to take over not only the government of Iran but the
government of the whole world! These misrepresentations would
have become ammunition for the enemies of the Faith.

In 1944 the Guardian decided that the time had come for him
to write something in Persian about the World Order. Then the

\[304\] SHOGHI EFFENDI’S STYLE

Bahá’ís in the East realized that they had totally misunderstood
that verse in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.

On this point, I should say that when Shoghi Effendi wrote
about the New World Order, he was not writing about politics.
He was talking about the spiritual and social evolution of
humanity. The Bahá’í Faith will not be spread through force, and
the New World Order will not be established through armed
rebellion. It will come about naturally, as a result of the maturity
of the human race, when the majority of the people in the world
would embrace the Faith. The way to hasten its arrival is to teach
the Faith. The Báb has written ‘The path to guidance is one of
love and compassion, not of force and coercion. This hath been
God’s method in the past, and shall continue to be in the future!’
(SWB 77). As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains this in Some Answered
Questions, Muḥammad never sanctioned offensive jihad. He
only allowed his followers to defend themselves against their
would-be attackers and murderers. After His death, the Muslims
themselves transformed defensive jihad into an offensive one.
Religion is not to be promoted with the sword. In the Qur’an it
says, ‘To you be your Way, and to me mine’ (109: 6) and ‘Let
there be no compulsion in Religion’ (2: 256).

IX
Miscellaneous
A. Brief statements introducing the Faith, its history, basic
principles and administrative structures

Shoghi Effendi wrote two statements during his ministry in
which he outlined the history and teachings of the Faith. The first
would have been produced in the early 1930s, and was written
possibly for the benefit of the British mandate authorities in
Palestine. It appears as a section immediately after the
Introduction to the 1955 edition of the compilation of Shoghi
Effendi’s writings entitled The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, on
page xi, and was called ‘The Bahá’í Faith – A Summary’. The
second statement was written in July 1947 in response to a
request made by the United Nations Special Committee on
Palestine. It was published by the Bahá’í Publishing Committee
in Wilmette, in October 1947, under the title, The Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh – A World Religion. There are many similarities
between the two statements, in such aspects as the treatment of
the principles of the Faith and a summary of its history. There
are, however, some distinctive features particular to each one .

The earlier statement begins with the following sentence:
‘The Revelation proclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh, His followers
believe, is divine in origin, all embracing in scope, broad in its
outlook, scientific in its method, humanitarian in its principles
and dynamic in the influence it exerts on the hearts and minds of
men’ (WOB xi).

In no previous writings do we find the statement that the
Faith is ‘scientific in its method’. It can well be assumed that
future scholars will research the point and develop this theme.

There are two other elements in the first paragraph that are
worthy of note. Emphasis is laid on the fact that ‘religious truth
is not absolute, but relative’. Furthermore, when referring to the
process of human evolution, we read the following sentence in
explanation of the consummation of that process:

> This final stage in this stupendous evolution, they [the
> Bahá’ís] assert, is not only necessary but inevitable, that it is
> gradually approaching, and that nothing short of the
> celestial potency with which a divinely ordained Message
> can claim to be endowed can succeed in establishing it.

(WOB xi)

A word of explanation might be useful regarding this
quotation. Some non-Bahá’í scholars have argued that if the
organic unity of mankind is inevitable, then we do not need a
divinely ordained Message to establish it. Two examples have
been given by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Tablets and talks which bear
on this point. Plants grow both in an abandoned field and in a
well-tended garden, but a gardener is needed to transform the
field into a garden! Likewise, a child develops its mental powers
organically, but an educator is needed to train and discipline that
development.

The second statement provides us with some highly revealing
features of the Faith. These are listed below:

1\. The social and material teachings of a religion are described

> as the ‘non-essential aspects’ of the doctrine promulgated by
> that Faith (FOB 2).

\[308\] MISCELLANEOUS

2\. The station of Bahá’u’lláh is uncompromisingly described as

> ‘the Promised One in the end of time’, and the advent of the
> ‘Day of Judgment’ (FOB 2).

3\. The aim of Bahá’u’lláh is stated as being ‘not to destroy, but

> to fulfill the Revelations of the past’, and ‘to reconcile rather
> than accentuate the divergences’ of the creeds in present-day
> society (FOB 2).

4\. The duty of investigating truth is not only the responsibility

> of humanity as a whole, but the ‘unfettered search after
> truth’ is a ‘primary duty’ of every member of the Bahá’í
> community (FOB 3).

5\. A description of the Administrative Order of the Faith is

> given, a feature which was not discussed in the previous
> statement.

6\. The Bahá’í Faith is referred to as ‘essentially supernatural,

> supranational, entirely non-political, non-partisan, and
> diametrically opposed to any policy or school of thought that
> seeks to exalt any particular race, class or nation’ (FOB 6).

7\. Yet another interesting point is the emphasis Shoghi Effendi

> places on the principle that Bahá’ís ‘subordinate every
> particular interest, be it personal, regional or national, to the
> over-riding interests of the generality of mankind’, by reason
> of the truth that ‘the advantage of the part is best to be
> reached by the advantage of the whole’ (FOB 7).

The statement ends with Shoghi Effendi quoting tributes
made by prominent world figures such as Queen Marie of
Romania, Leo Tolstoy, Revd T.K. Cheney, and the Master of
Balliol, Professor Benjamin Jowett, among others.

B. Statistical surveys

During his ministry Shoghi Effendi issued three statistical
surveys of the Bahá’í world community. The first was published
in 1944, consisted of 24 pages and was entitled A World Survey:
The Bahá’í Faith, 1844–1944. This was released on the occasion
of the Centenary of the Declaration of the Báb. The second
survey was dated 1950, consisted of 36 pages, and was published
under the title of The Bahá’í Faith, 1844–1950 – Information
Statistical and Comparative. The last survey was published
simultaneously in the United States and the United Kingdom in
1953, on the occasion of the Centenary of the birth of the Bahá’í
Revelation, and was entitled The Bahá’í Faith, 1844–1952 –
Information Statistical and Comparative, including supplement:
Ten Year International Bahá’í Teaching and Consolidation Plan
1953–1963.

This third survey consisted of a booklet of 74 pages, divided
into two parts. Part one covered some 50 pages, and dealt with
such subjects as: dates of historical significance; enumerations of
Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb’s best-known writings; names given to
the doors of the Shrine of the Báb; the fate of those who
persecuted Him and opposed the construction of His Shrine; the
Bahá’í Calendar; a list of significant events related to Bahá-
’u’lláh’s Proclamation of His Message; stages in Bahá’u’lláh’s
successive exiles; and cities visited by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the
course of His travels. Its contents also include data about
countries opened to the Faith; the languages in which Bahá’í
literature is translated and published; tribes and minority groups
represented in the community; names of the Hands of the Cause;
lists of National Assemblies and those which were incorporated;
principal Bahá’í historic sites in Iran; and names of prominent
personages who have paid tribute to the Faith.

Part two covers the objectives and goals of the Ten Year
Crusade. Under 23 headings, Shoghi Effendi tabulates these
goals by continent, and according to the responsibilities assigned

\[310\] MISCELLANEOUS

to each National Assembly. He gives alphabetical lists of
territories to be opened and languages into which Bahá’í
literature is to be translated, names the countries that need to be
consolidated and those National Assemblies responsible, and
further divides the goals in terms of National Assemblies to be
incorporated, temple sites to be purchased, national endowments
to be acquired and publishing trusts to be founded.

This precious volume also included a map that showed the
various goals, outlined in different colours for each category, and
indicating which National Assembly was responsible for which
task.

C. The Bahá’í World volumes

The idea of the publication of a Bahá’í Yearbook was a
suggestion made by Horace Holley in 1924. Shoghi Effendi
approved the proposal and considered it ‘extremely valuable and
timely’ (BA 74). He gave the responsibility of producing the first
yearbook to the National Assembly of America. From volumes II
to XII, Shoghi Effendi assumed the responsibility of producing
the publication himself, and also changed the title to The Bahá’í
World.

Rúḥíyyih Khánum, in The Priceless Pearl, gives us further
insights on the subject:

> Shoghi Effendi seized on this idea and from then on Horace
> became Shoghi Effendi’s primary instrument, as a gifted
> writer, and in his capacity as Secretary of the American
> National Spiritual Assembly, in making of The Bahá’í World
> the remarkable and unique book it became. (PP 209)

> What Shoghi Effendi himself thought of The Bahá’í World
> he put down in writing. As early as 1927, when only one
> volume had been published, he wrote to a non-Bahá’í: ‘I
would strongly advise you to procure a copy of the Bahá’í

> Year Book . . . which will give you a clear and authoritative
> statement of the purpose, the claim and the influence of the
> Faith.’ In a general letter addressed, in 1928, ‘To the beloved
> of the Lord and the hand-maids of the Merciful throughout
> the East and West’, and entirely devoted to the subject of The
> Bahá’í World, Shoghi Effendi informs them: ‘I have ever
> since its inception taken a keen and sustained interest in its
> development, have personally participated in the collection
> of its material, the arrangement of its contents, and the close
> scrutiny of whatever data it contains. I confidently and
> emphatically recommend it to every thoughtful and eager
> follower of the Faith, whether in the East or in the West . . .’.
> He wrote that its material is readable, attractive, compre-
> hensive and authoritative; its treatment of the fundamentals
> of the Cause concise and persuasive, and its illustrations
> thoroughly representative; it is unexcelled and unapproached
> by any other Bahá’í publication of its kind. This book Shoghi
> Effendi always visualized as being – indeed he designed it to
> be – eminently suitable for the public, for scholars, to place
> in libraries and as a means, as he put it, of ‘removing the
> malicious misrepresentations and unfortunate misunder-
> standings that have so long and so grievously clouded the
luminous Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.’

It was a book that he himself often gave as a gift to
> royalty, to statesmen, to professors, universities, newspaper
> editors and non-Bahá’ís in general, mailing it to them with
> his simple personal card ‘Shoghi Rabbani’ enclosed. The
> reaction of one of these – an American professor – conveys
> very clearly the impression the gift Shoghi Effendi had sent
> him produced: ‘Two copies of Bahá’í World have reached us
> . . . I cannot tell you how much I appreciate being able to
> study the book, which is exceedingly interesting and
> inspiring in every way . . . I congratulate you especially for
> developing the literature, and keeping alive such a whole-
> some spirit amongst the persons of many different groups

\[312\] MISCELLANEOUS

> who look to you for leadership.’ But perhaps the greatest
> tribute to the calibre of this publication, into which Shoghi
> Effendi poured throughout the years so much time and care,
> was that a proud Queen should write for it special tributes to
> the Faith and consent that these and her own photograph
> should appear as frontispieces in its various volumes. ‘No
> words’, Shoghi Effendi wrote to Martha Root in 1931, upon
> receiving from her one of Queen Marie’s specially written
> tributes, ‘can adequately express my pleasure at the receipt
> of your letter enclosing the precious appreciation which will
> constitute a valuable and outstanding contribution to the
> forthcoming issue of the Bahá’í World.’ (PP 211–12)

> He always deplored the fact that the material was not of a
> higher standard. It is due solely to his determination and
> perseverance that the Bahá’í World volumes are as brilliant
> and impressive as they are. (PP 210)

Partly because of the difficulty in obtaining adequate mater-
ial, and also because of his other preoccupations, Shoghi Effendi
found that he would have to cover two or more years in each of
the publications. He produced eleven volumes during his
ministry. Volume XIII of The Bahá’í World, which covered the
period of the Interregnum from the passing of Shoghi Effendi in
1957 to the end of the Ten Year Crusade, was produced by the
Hands of the Cause of God in the Holy Land. Thereafter, the
Universal House of Justice followed the same practice, and
issued seven more volumes covering the years from 1963 to
1992\. Subsequently, the House of Justice has found it possible to
publish the volumes on a yearly basis.

Q. What happened to the descendants of Queen Marie of
Romania? Was not her daughter also a Bahá’í? What is the
relationship of the family to the Faith now?

A. My wife, Violette, can deal with this question better than I.
Here is Violette: ‘The youngest daughter of Queen Marie,
Princess Ileana, was with her mother during the visits of Martha
Root and she was very attracted to the Faith. She never actually
said that she was a believer, unlike her mother. After the passing
of Queen Marie and all the political upheavals in Romania, when
the whole royal family left the country, Princess Ileana went to
the United States. While there, she actually converted to the
Catholic Faith and towards the end of her life she was a nun. She
lived in a convent and she was very much involved in that kind
of life, and then something very unusual happened. Shoghi
Effendi had told the Bahá’ís that whenever there were royalty or
heads of government, or important political people in the area,
the individual Bahá’ís should not contact them. Whatever contact
is made, he said, should be made through the administrative
bodies. Princess Ileana gave a talk at a conference in the US
about her mother. This is a story of many years ago, in the
lifetime of Shoghi Effendi. One of the Bahá’ís, a lady, was very
enthusiastic and she thought Princess Ileana should have said in
her talk that her mother was a Bahá’í. She got up in that
conference and raised her hand, and then said to the Princess that
there was evidence that her mother, Queen Marie, was a Bahá’í.
Princess Ileana was very upset in public, and she publicly
denounced this fact. When she wrote her biography of her
mother, her family and herself, she very specifically said that her
mother belonged to the Orthodox Church, or whatever was the
church of Romania. It was a very sad thing and there was no
reason why this would have come out in her book, had she not
been provoked by this Bahá’í in public.

\[314\] MISCELLANEOUS

‘The grandson of Queen Marie is now King Michael. He is
not officially the King of Romania, but if they wanted a king, he
would be the one. He is a very nice man. I remember, in 1996,
when Rúḥíyyih Khánum was in London, arrangements were
made for her to meet with King Michael and his wife, Queen
Ann, a very wonderful couple. They are not interested in
becoming Bahá’ís, but they are very fine individuals. They know
about the Faith, as does their daughter, Crown Princess
Margarita. She was in India one or two years ago. She was there
officially with a group and they went to visit the Temple. There
is a reception room next to the Temple in Delhi. When they took
her to see this place, Mr Fariborz Sahba himself was present, and
he took her around. There is a whole wall in that building of the
photographs of Queen Marie and her statements about the Faith.
This Princess Margarita was extremely impressed. She read and
she turned to Mr Sahba and said, “Yes, I recognize the hand-
writing of my great-grandmother”. They are quite aware of the
Faith but none of them is a Bahá’í.’

Q. What does the beloved Guardian mean when he states
that religious truth is relative, not absolute? What impact
should the statement have on our teaching work?

A. The fact that religious truth is relative means that it cannot be
absolute. It has to be suited to the conditions and the capacity of
the recipient of that truth. If that recipient is limited in his
understanding, the measure of truth given to him must also be
limited. It must be suited to the recipient’s requirements.

For example, children at elementary school learn about
arithmetic. It is simplified for the capacity of the children. There
is so much that the children are not and cannot be told, because
they would not understand. For example, they cannot learn about
the complicated algorithms that are used in modern technology.
A lot of that is arithmetic as well, but it is so complicated that we
cannot even do it easily on paper. We need computers to work

out these calculations. Therefore, we can say that arithmetic is a
relative truth. The level of understanding of the subject is not
absolute. We will always be able to learn more than what we
currently know. This is about scientific truth. Religious truth is
the same. It is adapted to our understanding.

The statements of Abraham about God are still true. He
compared God to the Sun. Even in Islam, the conception of God
is not as elaborate as it is in our Faith. Christ referred to God as
His Father and said that the Father was in Him. The choice of
this simple terminology was in conformity with the under-
standing of the people of the time. In addition, religious truth
involves the conception of the soul and the next world.
Muḥammad compared the next world to a garden. His words are
true, but they were adapted to the minds of the people of the
time. Bahá’u’lláh has explained the meaning of all these terms,
such as heaven, hell, the garden, the Sun etc. However, this is not
the end. Religious truth is still relative and the future Manifest-
ations of God will further develop these themes for humanity.

Q. What are the social and material teachings of a religion?

A. Shoghi Effendi has described the social and material teach-
ings of religion as non-essential. He employed the terminology
of essentials and non-essentials. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá used a different
terminology. He spoke about spiritual teachings and social
teachings. The meaning is very clear: the teachings of every
religion are comprised of two parts. The essential part has to do
with morality, with ethics, and with the eternal, immutable
principles of religion. The non-essential part includes instruc-
tions about material things and matters related to our daily lives,
e.g. inheritance, marriage, divorce, burial, as well as pray-ers,
fasting etc. The essentials are really the same in all religions but
the non-essential parts can change.

However, Shoghi Effendi mentions that there is a third part
of the teachings of every religion. The third part consists of the

\[316\] MISCELLANEOUS

man-made additions to the essential and non-essential parts of
religion. The essential part of the religion is not static, as each
Manifestation elaborates on that essential part. Each Manifest-
ation of God also makes amendments to the non-essential parts
of religion, as is required. The man-made additions to religion
are always set aside and disregarded.

We should use the concepts of essential, non-essential and
man-made rituals in order to teach the principle of religious unity
and progressive revelation. It is through this kind of explanation
that we can demonstrate that it is possible for all religions to be
in complete agreement. Tolerance of other religions is good, but
it is not enough. People must see the unity of religion.

Conclusion
When one reviews the panorama of Shoghi Effendi’s writings, in
English and in Persian/Arabic, one is bound to be overwhelmed
by the power, beauty and precision of the language he uses. As
we have seen in the above sections, his style changed over the
years and became more forceful, more impressive and more
majestic. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had envisaged in His Will and
Testament, the tender plant had become a mighty tree, and the
tree had yielded its fruit.

Shoghi Effendi himself never stated the broad lines of his
ministry in so many words. We might, however, identify some
compelling overall objectives in the literary work he produced so
profusely, so lovingly and so wisely over the years. Five of these
overriding themes appear to have occupied a central position in
his writings.

1\. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas foreshadows the formation of the

> Universal House of Justice at the end of the line of the
> Aghṣáns. From the very outset of his ministry the Guardian
> drew the attention of the friends to the shining goal of
> establishing, on a firm foundation, the Supreme Body of the
> Administrative Order. For this firm foundation to be
> achieved it was imperative that Local Assemblies be estab-
> lished in the true spirit and with the sound procedures of
> Bahá’í elections. These assemblies had to function harmon-
> iously and efficiently, in accordance with a set of clearly
> defined by-laws, and their consultation had to follow the
lofty principles enumerated by the Master in His Tablets.

In addition, National Assemblies had to be established in
conformity with the stipulations laid down in the Will and

\[318\] CONCLUSION

> Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, to be formed through well-
> ordered National Conventions, and function, like Local
> Assemblies, in accordance with national by-laws. They had,
> moreover, to organize and promote the teaching work, to
> provide means for the spiritual enrichment and development
> of the community, to establish national headquarters, acquire
> endowments, issue regular bulletins, and represent the Faith
> to those in authority in the country. These Assemblies were
> also meant to become effective instruments to execute the
> provisions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablets of the Divine Plan.
> Such preliminary steps Shoghi Effendi considered as
> essential for the eventual election of the Universal House of
> Justice, the future Pivot of the Covenant and Central
> Authority to which all must turn.

2\. Unfounded theories and even unwarranted assumptions were

> being made by the believers about each of the Central
> Figures of the Faith, as well as about himself as Guardian of
> the Cause. Administrative unity was not enough – it had to be
> combined with the greater concept of doctrinal unity. Thus,
> he had to define in clear terms the distinction between God,
> the Almighty Creator and Essence of Essences, and His
> Manifestations, who were the Perfect Mirrors of Divine
> Light. The unapproachable station of Bahá’u’lláh, the sing-
> ular position of the Báb in the Bahá’í Dispensation, and the
> unique rank occupied by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Mystery of God,
> had to be delineated. Likewise, the twin institutions of the
> Guardianship and the House of Justice, the distinctive
> features of the Administrative Order, and the relationship of
> that Order to the Author of the Faith and the Centre of its
> Covenant, had to be explicitly explained. Such must have
> been the motives that led Shoghi Effendi to write ‘The
> Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh’, which, as stated earlier, he
> regarded as a supplement to the Will and Testament of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

3\. He saw the need to provide the community with an authentic

> record of the historical events of the Ministries of the Báb
> and of Bahá’u’lláh, as well as the major developments of the
> first Bahá’í Century. This prompted him to produce first The
> Dawn Breakers and then God Passes By.

4\. Looking into the future, he had to outline the stages that the

> Bahá’í Administrative Order would traverse as it matured
> into the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, and eventually into the
> Bahá’í Commonwealth. These steps had to be described in
> the context of world developments, on the one hand, and on
> the other in line with the driving, mysterious force which
propelled the Cause of God on its divinely ordained course.

In conjunction with the overshadowing responsibility of
> individual teaching, Shoghi Effendi urged National Assem-
> blies to formulate collective teaching plans, and trained them
> to create agencies and instruments to implement the two
> necessary counterparts of community development, namely,
> expansion and consolidation. These national undertakings
> would prepare the Bahá’í world to engage in universal
> enterprises such as the Ten Year Crusade, aiming at the
> diffusion of the light of the Bahá’í Revelation throughout the
> planet, and the spread of its beneficial influence over all
> races, creeds and classes of humanity.

5\. Apart from these overriding considerations, he certainly had

> other concerns that he had to address. For example, he could
> not ignore the need to emphasize the moral aspect of Bahá’í
> life, and the obligation of adhering to norms of personal
> behaviour such as freedom from prejudice, rectitude of
> conduct, and attainment of excellence in all things. He also
> had to warn the Bahá’ís against affiliating themselves with
> political parties and interfering in political activities. Further-
> more, as the independence of the Faith was becoming

\[320\] CONCLUSION

> increasingly apparent, the followers of the Most Great Name
> had to disassociate themselves from the ecclesiastical orders
> of other religions. The Guardian encouraged the Bahá’ís to
> actively serve their countries by participating in adminis-
> trative (non-political) fields of government, as well as in
> community activities and benevolent pursuits. On the
> international level, he called on the friends to support
> humanitarian projects and other endeavours in harmony with
> the spirit of the Faith, and to aid efforts that would promote
> the general interests of the human race as it is impelled along
> the path to world solidarity and universal peace.

How perceptive was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who, when asked about
the ‘little child’ Isaiah had prophesised would ‘lead’ the faithful
to triumph (Isa. 11: 6), answered in a Tablet that that child was
indeed alive. The Tablet has been quoted by Amatu’l-Bahá in
The Priceless Pearl:

> O Maidservant of God! Verily, that child is born and is alive
> and from him will appear wondrous things that thou wilt
> hear of in the future. Thou shalt behold him endowed with
> the most perfect appearance, supreme capacity, absolute
> perfection, consummate power and unsurpassed might. His
> face will shine with a radiance that illumines all the horizons
> of the world; therefore forget this not as long as thou dost
> live inasmuch as ages and centuries will bear traces of him.

(PP 2)

We have seen the ‘supreme capacity’ of Shoghi Effendi’s
inspired pen, and the ‘consummate power and unsurpassed
might’ that he evinced through his immortal writings. Indeed, he
has shed his illumination on ‘all the horizons of the world’, and
future generations will witness how ‘ages and centuries’ have
borne ‘traces of him’.

Foreword

Some 90 youth from 25 countries, mainly European, participated
in the last of the three World Order courses given at Acuto
during the month of February 2006.

The purpose of this course was to consider the wide range of
the works of Shoghi Effendi, both in English and in Persian/
Arabic, and cast a panoramic and cursory glance over the
contents of each of his major writings. The beloved Guardian, in
the course of his blessed ministry, provided the friends and the
general public with a reliable survey of the significant and
historical Bahá’í events of the Heroic Age, an overview of the
stages enabling the current Administrative Order of the Faith to
become the nucleus and pattern of the future institutions of world
society, and a unique and authentic translation into English of the
fundamental Writings of the Founder of the Faith. Through the
power of his inspired pen Shoghi Effendi also succeeded in
carrying the Community of the Most Great Name from its
modest and rudimentary beginnings to a stage of development
enabling it to be a potent instrument, well-equipped to realize
and put into effect the exalted ideals which distinguish the
divine message of Bahá’u’lláh.

Introduction
Violette and I lived as adult Bahá’ís during the period of the
Guardianship. We had the privilege of being in Shoghi Effendi’s
presence, meeting him and listening to him in Haifa. We had the
joy of participating in his plans. I hope to be able to convey to
you something of the station of Shoghi Effendi, his personality,
the power of his pen, and the influence that he has had on the
Bahá’í community.

It is impossible to make any study of the writings of the Head
of a religion without arriving first at an understanding, however
inadequate, of the functions of the occupant of that office and the
scope of the authority conferred upon him. It is important to ap-
preciate that Shoghi Effendi’s entire literary output was devoted
to matters related to the Faith.

The Faith during the time of Shoghi Effendi was in its
infancy. I am sorry to say it, but we are still very immature.
Shoghi Effendi often referred to the immaturity of the Bahá’í
community. He was like a champion tennis player. He was the
champion of the the world and was faced with children who like
to play some tennis. He stood there and taught us how to hold the
racket and how to hit the ball. We thought he was another adult
Bahá’í, except that he was related to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Bahá’u’lláh
and the Báb through his lineage. We really did not know who he
was. In fact, Shoghi Effendi seems to have even concealed his
own true station.

The institution of the Guardianship was created by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá through the provisions of His Will and Testament. His half-
brother, Muḥammad-‘Alí, who was to succeed Him, had dis-
qualified himself by breaking the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh, thus
placing himself outside the pale of the Faith. This matter became

SHOGHI EFFENDI: THE RANGE AND POWER OF HIS PEN

clearly evident to the generality of the friends when ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá was asked what was then to be expected after His passing.
He replied: ‘As to the question ye have asked me, know verily
that this is a well-guarded secret. It is even as a gem concealed
within its shell. That it will be revealed is predestined. The time
will come when its light will appear, when its evidences will be
made manifest, and its secrets unraveled’ (WOB 150).

This secret was disclosed when the Will and Testament of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was read. The friends became aware that Shoghi
Effendi was to be the Successor, as he was ‘the Light that after
My passing shineth from the Dayspring of Divine Guidance’
(WTA 3). He is also referred to as ‘that primal branch’ (WTA
3), ‘the blest and sacred bough’ (WTA 3), ‘the sign of God, the
chosen branch, the guardian of the Cause of God, he unto whom
all . . . His loved ones must turn. He is the expounder of the
words of God’ (WTA 11).

‘Abdu’l-Bahá goes on to say, ‘The sacred and youthful
Branch [is] . . . under the care and protection of the Abhá
Beauty, [and] under the shelter and unerring guidance of His
Holiness, the Exalted One [the Báb] . . . Whoso obeyeth him not
. . . hath not obeyed God . . . Whoso disbelieveth in him hath
disbelieved in God; whoso deviateth, separateth himself and
turneth aside from him hath in truth deviated, separated himself
and turned aside from God’ (WTA 11). As a crowning statement
we read this ringing call: ‘Well is it with him that seeketh the
shelter of his shade that shadoweth all mankind’ (WTA 3). It
became clear therefore that such interpretations of the Writings
of Bahá’u’lláh as were given by the pen or at the instruction of
Shoghi Effendi, just like the interpretations written by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, were to be regarded as being as binding, in terms of their
validity, as Bahá’u’lláh’s sacred Text.

It is in this light that the Universal House of Justice chose to
include in the introductory paragraphs of its Constitution the
following statement: ‘The provenance, the authority, the duties,
the sphere of action of the Universal House of Justice all derive

\[2\] INTRODUCTION

from the revealed Word of Bahá’u’lláh which, together with the
interpretations and expositions of the Centre of the Covenant and
of the Guardian of the Cause – who, after ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, is the
sole authority in the interpretation of Bahá’í scripture – con-
stitute the binding terms of reference of the Universal House of
Justice and are its bedrock foundation’ (CUHJ 4). The Bahá’í
world has had thirty-nine years of Scripture revealed by
Bahá’u’lláh and a total of sixty-five years of inspired interpret-
ation by His two Authorized Interpreters.

It must be remembered that, with the passing of Shoghi
Effendi, authorized interpretation of Bahá’í scripture came to an
end. However, this does not mean that individual interpretations,
provided they are labelled as such, are forbidden. On the con-
trary, these are encouraged and regarded as a healthy exercise,
mentally and spiritually, in our continuous strivings to study our
teachings with a ‘searching eye’ (TB 157).

In this connection the Universal House of Justice has written:
‘A clear distinction is made in our Faith between authoritative
interpretation and the interpretation or understanding that each
individual arrives at for himself from his study of its teachings.
While the former is confined to the Guardian, the latter, accord-
ing to the guidance given to us by the Guardian himself, should
by no means be suppressed. In fact such individual interpretation
is considered the fruit of man’s rational power and conducive to
a better understanding of the teachings, provided that no disputes
or arguments arise among the friends and the individual himself
understands and makes it clear that his views are merely his own.
Individual interpretations continually change as one grows in
comprehension of the teachings. As Shoghi Effendi explained:
“. . . The more we read the Writings, the more truths we can find
in them and the more we will see that our previous notions were
erroneous”’ (MUHJ 88).

In the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh refers to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
in at least two verses. The first verse is well known: ‘When
the ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the Book of My

SHOGHI EFFENDI: THE RANGE AND POWER OF HIS PEN

Revelation is ended, turn your faces toward Him Whom God
hath purposed, Who hath branched from this Ancient Root’ (KA
¶121). In the Kitáb-i-‘Ahd, Bahá’u’lláh refers to this verse and
comments, ‘The object of this sacred verse is none other except
the Most Mighty Branch [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]’ (TB 221).

In the second verse we read the following concerning the
interpretation of Bahá’u’lláh’s own Writings: ‘When the Mystic
Dove will have winged its flight from its Sanctuary of Praise and
sought its far-off goal, its hidden habitation, refer ye whatsoever
ye understand not in the Book to Him Who hath branched from
this mighty Stock’ (KA ¶174). This verse of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
envisages a situation where a question is put to the Branch of the
Sacred Lote Tree for interpretation. The Branch – we can assume
that the Branch applies not only to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, but could be
applicable to Shoghi Effendi as well – would then interpret and
explain what was not clearly understood from the text of the
Holy Writ. The Guardianship, we could well say, was thus indir-
ectly anticipated in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.

One of the Bahá’ís, who later became a martyr, ‘Alí-
Muḥammad Varqá, (the grandfather of our present Hand of the
Cause, Dr Varqá) wrote to Bahá’u’lláh, saying that he under-
stood the first verse, but not the second. Bahá’u’lláh answered
him in a Tablet which exists at the Bahá’í World Centre.
Bahá’u’lláh did not say it meant only ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, nor did He
say that it referred to all of the future Branches. What He
actually stated was that He meant ‘two Branches’. What
Bahá’u’lláh had in mind was not something perpetual. For auth-
orized interpretation He had two Branches in mind. At that time,
everyone thought that the second Branch was Muḥammad-‘Alí
because he was the Greater Branch, while ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was
known as the Most Great Branch. However, after the passing of
Bahá’u’lláh, Muḥammad-‘Alí broke the Covenant. The mystery
is that Bahá’u’lláh included Muḥammad-‘Alí in the Kitáb-i-‘Ahd
as a successor to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Surely He knew what was to
become of him. Why did Bahá’u’lláh still put him in His Will?

\[4\] INTRODUCTION

The same question can be asked of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Why did He
mention successors to Shoghi Effendi if He knew that there
weren’t going to be any?

The wonderful thing is that Shoghi Effendi makes a
remarkable point in ‘The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh’. He
writes: ‘A study of the provisions of these sacred documents will
reveal the close relationship that exists between them, as well as
the identity of purpose and method which they inculcate’ (WOB
4). In other words, the method used by Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-
i-‘Ahd was also used by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Will and Testa-
ment. They used the same method. It was, we could well assume,
for the testing of the believers, in order to see who would stay
firm in the Covenant and who would waver. We could conclude
that they knew what was going to happen, yet they put such
stipulations in their Wills, quite probably, as I said, for the
purpose of testing the believers.

In The Priceless Pearl, written by Rúḥíyyih Khánum, we
read about the memoirs of Dr Falscheer, a German doctor in
Haifa. She was in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá when Shoghi
Effendi came into the room as a young boy. He went out after
paying his respects to his Grandfather, and then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
tells Dr Falscheer: ‘Before His ascension into eternal Light

the blessed Manifestation reminded me that I too – irrespective
of primogeniture or age – must observe among my sons and
grandsons whom God would indicate for His office’ (PP 12). It
becomes clear that Bahá’u’lláh knew that His second son,
Muḥammad-‘Alí, would not be faithful to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and
so He told the Master that He would have to choose another
Branch as His successor. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had no sons to appoint,
so He chose Shoghi Effendi, His grandson.

With reference to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Bahá’u’lláh has made
statements to unveil the station of the Most Great Branch. He
states, for example: ‘We pray God to illumine the world through
Thy knowledge and wisdom’ (WOB 135); ‘Render thanks
unto God . . . for . . . through Him every mouldering bone is

SHOGHI EFFENDI: THE RANGE AND POWER OF HIS PEN

quickened. Whoso turneth towards Him hath turned towards God
. . .’ (WOB 135).

Thus, we see that in addition to answering queries calling for
the interpretation of the Holy Writ, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was also
destined to illumine the world through His knowledge and wis-
dom. The same two aspects are also seen in the writings of
Shoghi Effendi. He would write in response to specific ques-
tions, as well as when he was moved to give his explanations of
the verities of the Faith, his analyses of the conditions in the
world, his description of the stages that the Faith and the world
must traverse in order to attain their respective states of maturity,
and his exposition of the vision of the future Bahá’í civilization.

It should be of interest to us that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá chose to
define His own function as ‘Interpreter’ of Bahá’u’lláh’s Writ-
ings. The word He used was ‘Mubayyín’. The function of a
Mubayyín is ‘tabyín’ (pronounced ‘tabyeen’) which means
interpretation. The two words ‘Interpreter’ and ‘Mubayyín’,
particularly in Persian/Arabic, have both a restrictive meaning
and a broad one. The restrictive sense is when the meaning of a
specific sacred text is disclosed in clearer terms, while the
broader application is when an unprompted exposition is made of
the implications of the revealed statements. It is highly note-
worthy that Shoghi Effendi, in translating the word ‘Mubayyín’,
uses two terms, namely ‘interpreter’ and ‘expounder’ (WTA 11).
‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote inspired treatises such as A Traveller’s
Narrative and The Secret of Divine Civilization without being
asked. They were unsolicited, as were all of the talks He gave
during His travels to the West. Shoghi Effendi also wrote, as just
stated, many things that were not in response to direct questions.

When a mandate or authority is assigned to an office or an
institution in the Cause, we must be sure that the capacity and
power to execute that mandate is also bestowed. In defining his
own function as a ‘Mubayyín’, the Guardian wrote: ‘[T]he
Guardian has been specifically endowed with such power as he
may need to reveal the purport and disclose the implications of

\[6\] INTRODUCTION

the utterances of Bahá’u’lláh and of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ (WOB 151).
He is, in fact, telling us that he could read the Mind of
Bahá’u’lláh and that of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

He has also added that such a power enables him ‘to take a
long, an uninterrupted view over a series of generations’ (WOB
148). In other words, Shoghi Effendi could see how the Faith
was going to advance and he could visualize how the world
would develop over a series of generations. God had given him
the power to do this. These are verities that Shoghi Effendi has
recorded in ‘The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh’. But he has almost
concealed them in such a way that the reader does not realize that
they are right there. This is why I mentioned that he seems to be
concealing his own true station.

Furthermore, in a letter dated 4 March 1948, written on his
behalf, in which Shoghi Effendi is commenting on the import-
ance of sending full reports of Bahá’í troublesome difficulties,
we read the following: ‘[H]e often senses a situation or condi-
tion without having any detailed knowledge of it’ (UD 449).
Does an ordinary person have this kind of perception? He,
nevertheless, has added that full reports must be sent anyway.

In Some Answered Questions, there is a chapter about
infallibility. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that there are two kinds, essential
infallibility and acquired or conferred infallibility. The possessor
of essential infallibility has the power of revelation, while the
possessor of conferred infallibility receives inspiration. He
explains this truth by using the Sun as an example. The Sun does
not have to acquire its light from another source; it has essential
light. The Moon, however, receives its light from the Sun; it has
conferred light. According to this metaphor, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is the
Moon, which receives light, or inspiration, from the Manifest-
ation of God. Shoghi Effendi would have been horrified if we
said that he was a second Moon. Bahá’u’lláh has given to
‘Abdu’l-Bahá the title of ‘Him round Whom all names revolve’
(TB 225). Therefore, Shoghi Effendi regarded himself as a
satellite, revolving around the Moon, the Centre of the Covenant.

SHOGHI EFFENDI: THE RANGE AND POWER OF HIS PEN

This satellite received light directly from the Sun, for it is written
in the Will and Testament that ‘The sacred and youthful branch,
the Guardian of the Cause of God, as well as the Universal
House of Justice to be universally elected and established, are
both under the care and protection of the Abhá Beauty, under the
shelter and unerring guidance of the Exalted One’ (WTA 11).
Accordingly, the Universal House of Justice is another, separate
satellite, receiving inspiration and guidance directly from the Sun
of this Dispensation.

Indeed, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Some Answered Questions, while
commenting on the nature of ‘acquired or conferred infallibility’,
succinctly points out that if God does not protect the vehicle
chosen for such infallibility it would be neither ‘fitting nor
worthy of God’ (SAQ 172). This means that it would be
unworthy of God, if He did not send His illumination, His
inspiration, His direction, His guidance to the individual or
institution which we are required to obey, be it ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
Shoghi Effendi or the Universal House of Justice.

The Cause will be the object of opposition and of attacks by
enemies of the Faith, both internally and externally, and we have
to know how to defend the Cause. We have to understand that
the foundation of the Cause is on very strong and firm grounds –
unassailably firm. And this is why ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that the
power of the Covenant is the axis, the pivot of the oneness of
mankind. The oneness of mankind is the principle that all
humanity is one and all the races are one. This concept has a
pivot. That pivot is the power of the Covenant. He puts the two
together, the Covenant and the oneness of humanity. In this
Cause the Covenant has a pivot and the pivotal centre today is
the Universal House of Justice. The reason why we know that
there will be unity in the world is because of the institution of the
Universal House of Justice, the focal centre of the Faith. This
centre is set on a firm foundation in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the Most
Holy Book, the Mother Book of the Bahá’í Revelation. No one
can ever change it. If the enemies of the Faith want to attack the

\[8\] INTRODUCTION

Covenant, they may try but they shall not succeed. It is strongly
and firmly grounded. It is the Instrument that will bring about the
final Most Great Peace and the Bahá’í World Civilization. The
more you think about it, the more you will understand it, the
more you will be able to defend it, and the greater will be your
services to the Cause in the future.

Outline of contents

The number of communications and/or titles authored by Shoghi
Effendi during his ministry consists of 11,345 items in English,
12,308 items in Persian/Arabic, and over 9,000 cabled messages,
making a grand total of more than 32,000 items. These figures
have been released by the World Centre and represent such items
as the Archives Office has in its possession. The numbers are
periodically revised as more items are found and sent to the
World Centre.

The above figures, particularly those in English, include such
titles as God Passes By, ‘The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh’ and
‘The Unfoldment of World Civilization’. These publications,
although they are lengthy, are counted as one item each. In con-
trast, a letter of encouragement to an individual believer of one
or two paragraphs is also reckoned as one item. As to his cables
– some are brief, others may run into a number of pages. This is
especially true when the postal service was uncertain and Shoghi
Effendi felt that a cabled message would be a safer and faster
method of communication. Items of correspondence from Shoghi
Effendi also include letters written on his behalf by his
secretaries.

As the table of Contents, indicates the present material covers
Shoghi Effendi’s pre-Guardianship period, his translations of
sacred and other texts, his own major works in English, his
writings in Persian and Arabic, some sundry comments and a
conclusion.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. How can we systematically and realistically increase our
love for Shoghi Effendi?

A. Two things are important: we should learn more about Shoghi
Effendi’s life. The best and most comprehensive book to read on
the subject is The Priceless Pearl, the gift of Rúḥíyyih Khánum
to the Bahá’í world. Every one of us should read this book and,
through it, get closer to the spirit of Shoghi Effendi. We should
also read Shoghi Effendi’s own writings. You should not
consider his writings as you would consider an article in the
newspaper. You read the paper and then you throw it away, but
his writings are something that should remain with you for your
entire life. There are many meanings and implications in the
writings of Shoghi Effendi. As we read them prayerfully, we try
to understand the intent of what he has written. We will thus get
closer to the spirit of Shoghi Effendi, and will love him ever
more.

Q. The statement of Bahá’u’lláh regarding the two Branches
in His Tablet to ‘Alí-Mu%ammad Varqá seems to provide
evidence that there will be no future Guardian after Shoghi
Effendi. In reading the letters of the Universal House of
Justice about this subject, I have not found any reference to
this Tablet. Is this the case and why? Was this reference
brought to the attention of Mason Remey when he was
consulting with the Custodians?

A. Neither the Hands of the Cause nor the House of Justice
found it necessary to refer to this particular Tablet. Everything
was very clear already. Mr Remey was probably not aware of
this Tablet.

\[10\] INTRODUCTION

Q. When considering the beloved Guardian as the central
pivot of the Covenant, would you consider him to be the
pivot of the Lesser Covenant or of the Greater Covenant?

A. According to Shoghi Effendi, the Greater Covenant is the
Covenant that each Manifestation makes with His followers that
there will be a future Manifestation and that they must recognize
Him. The Lesser Covenant is within each Dispensation. It is a
Covenant about loyalty to the Successor or Successors of the
Manifestation. When we talk about Shoghi Effendi or the
Universal House of Justice as central pivots of the Covenant, we
are referring to the Lesser Covenant.

Q. What are your feelings about the period from 1957 to
1963, between the Guardian’s passing and the election of the
first Universal House of Justice?

A. This was a difficult period. It was overshadowed by grief for
the loss of Shoghi Effendi. There were no doubts in the minds of
Bahá’ís that for the period in question the direction of the Faith
should be left to the Hands of the Cause. Nevertheless, there was
a feeling of loss. We had people at the helm who had been
appointed by Shoghi Effendi, yet there was a feeling that we had
lost the source of infallible guidance. The Hands were telling us
that they were not an infallible body. However, there was also a
positive side. There was a deep feeling throughout the whole
Bahá’í world that the only and best thing the friends could do
was to carry out the last wishes of Shoghi Effendi, and to show
their loyalty to him by making greater efforts to win the Ten
Year Crusade. The number of pioneers that left their homes after
the passing of Shoghi Effendi far surpassed the number that left
before it. His passing had released powerful energies within the
hearts of the friends. It may be that God had ordained for Shoghi

Effendi to die at the midway point of the Crusade in order to
create a new desire in the friends to make sacrifices for him.

The Hands wrote a letter to the Bahá’í world that clearly
stated that Shoghi Effendi had not appointed a successor as
Guardian and that he had not left a will. Every conscientious
believer thought very deeply about what would happen. There
were many questions and opinions but the friends had to put
them aside and wait for the Universal House of Justice. In 1958
the Hands wrote to the friends, ‘We call upon all the believers
. . . to desist from all further speculation on the future develop-
ment of the institutions of the Faith – speculation which can only
give rise to those very differences of interpretation forbidden by
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and against which they repea-
tedly warned us’ (MoC 101). They wanted us to remain united so
that we could carry out the Plan at hand.

Q. What exactly did you mean when you said that the
interpretations of the Guardian are binding in terms of their
validity?

A. They are interpretations by the authorized Interpreter and
Expounder of the Faith. They are binding on us and cannot be
disregarded, unlike, say, a pilgrim’s note or an interpretation by a
distinguished Bahá’í, which are not at all binding.

Q. Was Shoghi Effendi only infallible when he was
interpreting? Is it possible that statements he made about the
future will not be fulfilled? A fellow in my home community
believes that the answer to these questions is yes in both
cases. What do you think?

A. Nowhere in the Writings, does it say that Shoghi Effendi was
inspired, infallible and in receipt of divine guidance only when
he was interpreting. The contrary is true. Referring to the House
of Justice and the Guardian, it is written that ‘Whatsoever they

\[12\] INTRODUCTION

decide is of God’ (WTA 11). This is the opposite of limiting his
divine guidance to interpretation alone. He himself has written,
in ‘The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh’, that he has been given the
power to view developments over several generations. The idea
that Shoghi Effendi was only guided when he was interpreting,
or that the Universal House of Justice is only guided when it is
legislating, is wrong. We have to be 100 per cent sure that both
Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice are under the
protection of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. This is the reason why
this Faith is so well founded and firmly established. This is why
it is that this Faith that can establish the unity of the world and
the Most Great Peace and inaugurate the world civilization.

Q. Can you please comment on the infallibility of Shoghi
Effendi in relation to the letter written on his behalf to a
believer dated 17 October 1944, saying ‘The infallibility of the
Guardian is confined to matters which are related strictly to the
Cause and interpretation of the teachings; he is not an
infallible authority on other subjects, such as economics,
science, etc. When he feels that a certain thing is essential for
the protection of the Cause, even if it is something that affects a
person personally, he must be obeyed, but when he gives
advice, such as that he gave you in a previous letter about your
future, it is not binding; you are free to follow it or not as you
please’ (MUHJ 546, n.1)?

A. This letter makes a distinction between two points. Let us
suppose that the Guardian has told one of the friends that his
presence in a particular town or city is detrimental to the interests
of the Cause and that he instructs him to move somewhere else.
This is, in fact, what happened when the Guardian asked local
Bahá’ís in Haifa to settle somewhere else. An instruction of this
kind from the Guardian must be unquestionably obeyed, because
it was issued for the sake of the protection of the Cause.

Let us suppose, on the other hand, that an individual asked
for the Guardian’s advice on where he should pioneer to or what
subjects he should study at university. In such instances, the
advice he gave was not binding and the believer was free to
follow the advice or not.

Q. The Universal House of Justice clearly indicates that it is
not invested with the power of interpreting the Writings.
Why is it, then, that Bahá’ís write to the Supreme Institution
asking for interpretation?

A. Shoghi Effendi and the House of Justice have both written
clearly that authorized interpretation is the prerogative of the
Guardian, and authorized legislation is the exclusive right of the
Universal House of Justice. These are two specific fields,
interpretation and legislation. Shoghi Effendi adds ‘Neither can,
nor will ever, infringe upon the sacred and prescribed domain of
the other’ (WOB 150). What does that mean? This means that
we have been given a promise that the Guardian will never
infringe upon the right of the Universal House of Justice to
authorized legislation and that the Universal House of Justice
will never infringe upon the sacred domain of authorized
interpretation.

A legitimate question we may have in this regard concerns
the instructions that Shoghi Effendi gave us about the
Administrative Order. Was not that legislation? Was he
infringing upon the domain of the Universal House of Justice?
We must look carefully at what Shoghi Effendi has written. At
the beginning of his Guardianship, when he started giving us
instructions about how to form our Assemblies and so on, he
often wrote that his instructions should be followed pending the
election of the Universal House of Justice, which will review the
situation at that time. In other words, he was saying that as there
was no Universal House of Justice yet, and as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had
appointed him as the Head of that House, he will be guiding us in

\[14\] INTRODUCTION

administrative affairs for the time being. He was not infringing
upon the sacred domain of the House of Justice. The Universal
House of Justice itself has written that it will not provide us with
authorized interpretations, but in order to legislate, it has to know
what Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi have
already written. Before it legislates, it takes the sacred text of
Bahá’u’lláh, and its authorized interpretation, into consideration.
Of course, this process involves an element of elucidation. When
an Assembly asked Shoghi Effendi: ‘How will the Supreme
Tribunal be formed and operate?’ he replied that this would
require the elucidation of the Universal House of Justice. This
means that legislation is required, legislation which of necessity
must have at its heart an elucidation. The elucidation will be in
the form of legislation to determine the functions of the tribunal,
the manner in which it should be elected or selected, and how it
should operate. The legislation is not about what we should
believe, merely about what we must do. The Writings of
Bahá’u’lláh, and those of the Interpreters, form the basis of our
beliefs and inner convictions. In order to find out more about the
operation of the Administrative Order we must turn to the
Universal House of Justice. It will tell us what to do and how to
do it.

I
Extracts from Shoghi Effendi’s writings during

the pre-Guardianship period
At the time when Shoghi Effendi was just a child, he had the
longing that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would address a Tablet to him.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá acceded to the wish of His grandson, and wrote
him the following: ‘He is God! O My Shoghi, I have no time to
talk, leave me alone! You said “write” – I have written. What
else should be done? Now is not the time for you to read and
write, it is the time for jumping about and chanting “O My
God!”, therefore memorize the prayers of the Blessed Beauty
and chant them that I may hear them, because there is no time
for anything else’ (PP 8).

On another occasion, according to Rúḥíyyih Khánum,
‘Shoghi Effendi entered the Master’s room, took up His pen and
tried to write. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá drew him to His side, tapped him
gently on the shoulder and said, “Now is not the time to write,
now is the time to play, you’ll write a lot in the future”’ (PP 9).

When, in the summer of 1918, Shoghi Effendi graduated
from the American University in Beirut with a Bachelor of Arts
degree, a new chapter opened before him, and he witnessed the
fulfilment of his highest aspiration: that of serving ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
as His secretary. From that summer till the spring of 1920, he
placed himself at the service of his beloved Grandfather. As far
as we know, the first translation he made of one of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s Tablets was dated 12 December 1918. It is published in
Star of the West, Volume 10.

Shoghi Effendi’s work consisted of translating into Persian
letters sent from the West addressed to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and
writing down the answers ‘Abdu’l-Bahá dictated to him. Before
the answers were sent to the friends in the West, he would
translate them into English and attach his rendition to the original
Tablet. In addition, Shoghi Effendi maintained a personal
correspondence with some of his close friends and also kept a
diary in which he recorded important events at the World Centre,
news of Bahá’í developments elsewhere, as well as his own
thoughts and feelings about the Faith and the Holy Land. The
diary has not been published yet. It only covers the 18 months
during which he served as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s secretary. He never
kept a diary after he was appointed as Guardian. The entire copy
is in the International Archives, and we can hope that at some
appropriate time in the future it will be published, as may be
determined by the Universal House of Justice.

In order to give us a glimpse of the type of work in which he

Pacific Islands and thence via India back to the Holy Land.
(17 July 1919, RD 9/11/05)

The garden immediately surrounding the Beloved’s abode is
blooming with verdure and flowers. The grove as well as the
rose-garden have indeed turned into a delectable Paradise.
Over three thousand mandarines sparkle like unto fire from
among the leaves of young trees that bend under the weight
of their clusters of fruit. The alleys are adorned on each side
with rain-drenched roses of varied colors. The balustrade is
almost concealed from view so extensive and rich have
become the branches and the off-shoots of the ivy. The white
rose bushes seem indeed to be covered with spots and masses
of snow reflecting the lights of the sun so much as to dazzle
the eye. The fragrance that embalms the air, the freshness
that one encounters around himself, the sight of the trees that
seem from afar to be set on fire, the violets, modest yet
betraying by their scent their presence, the [j]asmine, lily and
rose all combine to make the rose garden a favourable place
on such a sunny afternoon as the one we had today, for the
Master to dictate the Tablets to His dear friends all over the
world. (16 January 1919, RD 9/11/05)

Just before sunset, I was ordered by the Beloved to walk up
to the Holy Tomb and offer a prayer of devotion and
thanksgiving on His behalf. I instantly put on my walking
boots, took hold of my cane and ascended the Holy Mount.
The wind that was violently blowing softened down to a pure
and fragrant breeze which heralded the approach of
springtime; the mighty, and I venture to add matchless, view
that was unfolded to my eyes as I ascended higher and higher
the green and verdant slopes of Carmel; the spirituality that
imbued the atmosphere; the stillness, save the distant roar of
the waves, that added greatly to the Majesty and the
imposing serenity of the surroundings; the beautiful sight of

> the blossoming almond trees that surround the Holy Tomb;
> the fragrant smell of the rain-drenched roses that reminded
> the pilgrim of his approach to the door of the Tomb; all made
> me forget my care, my concerns and my anxieties. The
> environment was elevating, the thought that amid such a
> scene, I was to offer a prayer on behalf of the Beloved
> thrilled and moved me from within and made me realise what
> an insignificant speck of dust did I figure at the foot of His
> Throne. I prayed the best I could and begged guidance,
> protection and capability from Him who had sent me to this
> hallowed Spot. (4 March 1919, RD 9/11/05)

\[24\] SHOGHI EFFENDI’S WRITINGS DURING THE PRE-GUARDIANSHIP PERIOD

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. The Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá before the passing of
Bahá’u’lláh are regarded as authoritative and binding on the
Bahá’ís. Was this because of the station conferred on
‘Abdu’l-Bahá by the Súriy-i-GhuAn and the Kitáb-i-Aqdas?
If so, why are the writings of Shoghi Effendi before the
passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá not regarded as binding, since the
station of Guardian was conferred on him by the Will and
Testament while he was still a very young child?

A. No, the reason why we regard all the writings of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá as authoritative is not because they were written after the
revelation of the Súriy-i-Ghuṣn or the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. These
Tablets recognized the high station that He always had. He wrote
on behalf of Bahá’u’lláh while in Baghdád, even before the
revelation of the Súriy-i-Ghuṣn. Basically, the reason why the
writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and of Shoghi Effendi are treated
differently is because they had different stations from each other.
Let us contrast the person, the soul, the reality of Shoghi Effendi
with that of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was the Mystery of
God. He shared certain qualities and powers that the
Manifestation of God had. His equal cannot be found anywhere
else in religious history. Take for example Islam. Imám ‘Alí was
the successor of Muḥammad. Shoghi Effendi tells us not to
compare the station of Imám ‘Alí with that of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
because His was even higher. Nor are we to compare Him to
Saint Peter. The Master was unique, as He was also the perfect
Exemplar. In contrast, Shoghi Effendi has written, ‘No Guardian
of the Faith, I feel it my solemn duty to place on record, can ever
claim to be the perfect exemplar of the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh
or the stainless mirror that reflects His light’ (WOB 151).
Shoghi Effendi used to sign his letters with ‘Your true brother’.
He wanted to say that he was with us, working together with us
in the divine vineyard. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also sometimes said that He

was working with the Bahá’ís as a co-worker. However, this was
to show us that He was the Servant of Bahá’u’lláh, not because
He was equal to us in any way. He was not known as ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá before the passing of Bahá’u’lláh. Until then, He was
known as the Most Great Branch. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (Servant of
Bahá) was the title that He Himself adopted after the passing of
Bahá’u’lláh. This was to refute the accusation of Muḥammad-
‘Alí that He had claimed to be a Prophet. When He signed His
letters to the West in English He would write ‘a-B-a’. He used
small letters for ‘Abdu’l and ‘Abbás, but He used a capital B for
Bahá.

Q. Did Shoghi Effendi contribute to translations prior to the
Guardianship, such as The Hidden Words published in Cairo
in 1921?

A. Whenever Shoghi Effendi contributed to a translation his
name usually appeared in the translation credits, even if he was
only one of the contributors. For example, in some Star of the
West volumes there are Tablets translated by a team, consisting
of Shoghi Effendi, Dr Zia Baghdadi and Dr Esslemont. Their
three names were printed in brackets at the end of the Tablets.
Shoghi Effendi, as far as I know, did not contribute to the
translation of The Hidden Words by Mrs Stannard, published in
Cairo in 1921.

\[26\] II
Works produced during the initial period of the

Guardian’s ministry
After the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Bahá’í world was waiting
with bated breath to witness not only the personality and
behaviour of His successor, but the style, tone and spirit of
Shoghi Effendi’s writings. At the time of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Ascension, the friends in the East had already seen evidences of
the mighty and inspired pen of the Most Great Branch, through
such dissertations as The Secret of Divine Civilization and A
Traveller’s Narrative. But Shoghi Effendi, because of both his
youthful age and the brief period of his literary output prior
to 1921, was, for the most part, not fully established as an
author in the eyes of the generality of the believers in the East
and West.

The letters of Shoghi Effendi immediately after he learned
about the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá have a quality of anguish as
well as hope about the future. It is clear that he was feeling his
way in the discharge of his new responsibilities. He would often
ask the friends to pray for him so that he would not fall short of
the standard of servitude expected of him by the beloved Master.

A. Early letters

In the letters written at the very outset of his ministry, Shoghi
Effendi invariably in his closing paragraphs makes mention of
the ‘Ladies of the Household’ of the Master, who joined him in
his greetings to the friends. As time went on, we see that in such

letters he only makes mention of the Greatest Holy Leaf. This
practice was, of course, also stopped, after her passing in 1932.

The first letter we have on record is one he wrote to a fellow
Bahá’í student in London, while he was still in that city and was
moving to stay with Dr Esslemont in his home. In this precious
letter he writes as follows:

> The terrible news has for some days so overwhelmed my
> body, my mind and my soul that I was laid for a couple of
> days in bed almost senseless, absent-minded and greatly
> agitated. Gradually His power revived me and breathed in
> me a confidence that I hope will henceforth guide me and
> inspire me in my humble work of service. The day had to
> come, but how sudden and unexpected. The fact however that
> His Cause has created so many and such beautiful souls all
> over the world is a sure guarantee that it will live and
> prosper and ere long will compass the world! I am
> immediately starting for Haifa to receive the instructions He
> has left and have now made a supreme determination to
> dedicate my life to His service and by His aid to carry out
His instructions all the days of my life.

. . . The stir which is now aroused in the Bahá’í world is
> an impetus to this Cause and will awaken every faithful soul
> to shoulder the responsibilities which the Master has now
placed upon every one of us.

The Holy Land will remain the focal centre of the Bahá’í
> world; a new era will now come upon it. The Master in His
> great vision has consolidated His work and His spirit assures
> me that its results will soon be made manifest.

The letter ends with the phrase: ‘With prayer and faith in His
Cause, I am your well-wisher in His service, Shoghi’ (PP 40–1).

The second statement we have from him is a message writ-
ten on 6 January 1922, conveying his greetings to a gathering
of Bahá’ís and notables of the City of Haifa, to commemorate

\[28\] THE INITIAL PERIOD OF THE GUARDIAN’S MINISTRY

the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. In this message we read the
following:

> The shock has been too sudden and grievous for my youthful
> age to enable me to be present at this gathering of the loved
> ones of beloved ‘Abdu’l-Bahá . . . I venture to hope that we
> his kindred and his family may by our deeds and words,
> prove worthy of the glorious example he has set before us
> and thereby earn your esteem and your affection. May His
> everlasting spirit be with us all and knit us together for
> evermore! (PP 47)

On 19 January 1922, he wrote his first letter to the Bahá’ís of
Persia. In it he made reference to the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, to
the sorrows this event had entailed, and to the need to work
together in promoting the Faith. Towards the end of this brief
letter he made a request of the friends, the gist of which is as
follows:

> My perpetual request of His [‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s] faithful friends
> is that they should pray that I will remain steadfast in my
> resolve [to execute the Master’s last wishes] so that, God
> grant, this weak and worthless plant may acquire such
> strength and worthiness as to enable it to bear fruit and, in
> this way, bring joy and gladness to the hearts of the friends.

(TAW, Vol. 1, 1)

This idea of a plant bearing fruit is a reference to a statement
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Will and Testament, in which He states:

> It is incumbent upon you to take the greatest care of Shoghi
> Effendi . . . that no dust of despondency and sorrow may
> stain his radiant nature, that day by day he may wax greater
> in happiness, in joy and spirituality, and may grow to become
even as a fruitful tree. (WTA 25)

To obtain further insight into the tenor and tone of the
Guardian’s letters during this initial period, a number of extracts
from his correspondence are reproduced below:

> Ours is the duty to strive by day and night to fulfill our own
> obligations and then trust in His Guidance and never failing
> Grace. Unity amongst the friends, selflessness in our labors
> in His Path, detachment from all worldly things, the greatest
> prudence and caution in every step we take, earnest endeavor
> to carry out only what is His Holy Will and Pleasure, the
> constant awareness of His Presence and of the example of
> His Life, the absolute shunning of whomsoever we feel to be
> an enemy of the Cause . . . these, and foremost among them is
> the need for unity, appear to me as our most vital duties,
> should we dedicate our lives for His service. (21 January
> 1922, BA 16)

> of strength, of confidence, of the Divine Spirit in my yearning

> know that He will not leave me to myself, I trust in His

of the dear Master’s Testament, you will read it and see what
He has undergone at the hands of His kindred . . . you will

help me to face . . . (February 1922, PP 48)

Ah bitter remorse of having missed Him – in His Last Days –
on this earth, I shall take with me to the grave no matter what
I may do for Him in future, no matter to what extent my
studies in England will repay his wondrous love for me.
(February 1922, PP 31)

At this grave and momentous period through which the
Cause of God in conformity with the Divine Wisdom is
passing, it is the sacred duty of every one of us to endeavour
to realize the full significance of this Hour of Transition, and
then to make a supreme resolve to arise steadfastly for the
fulfilment of our sacred obligations. (5 March 1922, BA 17)

How keenly I feel at this challenging hour in the history of
the Cause the need for a firm and definite determination to
subordinate all our personal likings, our local interests, to
the interests and requirements of the Cause of God! Now is
the time to set aside, nay, to forget altogether, minor con-
siderations regarding our internal relationships, and to
present a solid united front to the world animated by no other

Bahá’u’lláh. Now that happily I feel myself restored to
a position where I can take up with continuity and vigour
the threads of my manifold duties, the bitterness of every
disappointment felt time and again in the course of the past
weary months at my feeling of unpreparedness, have been
merged in the sweetness of the present hour when I real-
ise that spiritually and bodily I am better equipped
to shoulder the responsibilities of the Cause. (December
1922, PP 66)

True, my task is immense, my responsibilities grave and
manifold, but the assurance which the words of the all-
wise Master give me in my work is my shield and support in
the career which is now unfolding itself to my eyes. (20
December 1922, PP 67).

To have been unable, owing to unforeseen and unavoidable
circumstances, to correspond with you ever since you entered
upon your manifold and arduous duties is to me a cause of
deep regret and sad surprise . . . I am however assured and
sustained by the conviction, never dimmed in my mind, that
whatsoever comes to pass in the Cause of God, however
disquieting in its immediate effects, is fraught with infinite
Wisdom and tends ultimately to promote its interests in the
world. (23 December 1922, PP 67)

Are we to be carried away by the flood of hollow and
conflicting ideas, or are we to stand, unsubdued and
unblemished, upon the everlasting rock of God’s Divine
Instructions? . . . [A]re we to believe that whatever befalls us
is divinely ordained, and in no wise the result of our faint-
heartedness and negligence? (1923, PP 74).

[The Will of God is] at variance with the shadowy views, the
impotent doctrines, the crude theories, the idle imaginings,

> the fashionable conceptions of a transient and troublous
> age . . . (1923, PP 74)

> The time has come for the friends . . . to think not as to how
> they should serve the Cause, but how the Cause should be
> served. (1923, PP 74)

Amatu’l-Bahá Rúḥíyyih Khánum’s insight is penetrating
when she describes the quality of Shoghi Effendi’s letters during
the first two years of his ministry. She writes: ‘With the passing
of 1923 one could almost say that the winged Guardian emerged
from the chrysalis of youth, a new being; the wings may not yet
be fully stretched, but their beat gains steadily in sweep and
assurance as the years go by until, in the end, they truly cast a
shadow over all mankind’ (PP 73).

B. Translation of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament

Seventeen days after the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Shoghi
Effendi, accompanied by Lady Blomfield, arrived in the Holy
Land with a broken heart, a weary body and strained nerves. It
was in this condition that he had to assume the extraordinary
responsibility that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had placed on his shoulders. He
stayed in the same room that he had occupied during the ministry
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, which was adjoining the Master’s bedroom
where He passed away. We can well assume that one of his first
acts was to read the text of the Will and Testament. He
subsequently set himself the task of translating this remarkable
document into English. After a short while he had to transfer his
residence to the home of one of his aunts, which was adjacent to
the Master’s house, where he could have a quieter atmosphere in
which to work.

Here was this 24-year-old youth, who had to translate, for all
time, the provisions of a document which he later described as
one of the two ‘Charter[s] of a future world civilization’ (GPB

\[34\] THE INITIAL PERIOD OF THE GUARDIAN’S MINISTRY

328). While he was doing this seminal work, he also had to make
sure that photostatic copies of his Grandfather’s Will or reliable
transcripts were made and duly sent to different Bahá’í
communities throughout the East. Sentence by sentence, he had
to translate the story of the sufferings endured by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
the disloyalty and rebellion of His half-brother, Mírzá
Muḥammad-‘Alí, and the Master’s prediction of the frustration
of all his hopes and those of the people who followed him.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá also expressed in His last wishes a call to all the
friends to arise unitedly to disperse far and wide and to follow
the heroic example of the Disciples of Jesus Christ. In this self-
same document ‘Abdu’l-Bahá expresses His desire for
martyrdom, and utters His prayers for the repentance and
forgiveness of His enemies. On more practical matters, the
Master outlined the responsibilities and powers devolving on the
Guardian of the Faith, including his appointment of the Hands of
the Cause of God, and specified the scope of the duties and
functions of the Universal House of Justice, as well as stipulating
the method of the election of this Supreme Body.

Shoghi Effendi has given us the gist of the contents of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament in the following concise and
comprehensive summary:

> The Document establishing that Order [Administrative
> Order], the Charter of a future world civilization, which may
> be regarded in some of its features as supplementary to no
> less weighty a Book than the Kitáb-i-Aqdas; signed and
> sealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; entirely written with His own hand;
> its first section composed during one of the darkest periods of
> His incarceration in the prison-fortress of ‘Akká, proclaims,
> categorically and unequivocally, the fundamental beliefs of
> the followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh; reveals, in
> unmistakable language, the twofold character of the Mission
> of the Bab; discloses the full station of the Author of the
Bahá’í Revelation; asserts that ‘all others are servants unto

> Him and do His bidding’; stresses the importance of the
> Kitáb-i-Aqdas; establishes the institution of the Guardianship
> as a hereditary office and outlines its essential functions;
> provides the measures for the election of the International
> House of Justice, defines its scope and sets forth its
> relationship to that Institution; prescribes the obligations,

\[36\] THE INITIAL PERIOD OF THE GUARDIAN’S MINISTRY

As the Covenant-breakers in North America falsely assumed
that the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in the West would be shaken and
weakened through the passing of the Centre of the Covenant, and
the friends, particularly in North America, were subjected to a
wave of tests and trials, Shoghi Effendi decided that he would
give them the translated text of the Will in two stages. Prior to
sending the complete version, he made some selections and
shared these with the communities in the West, to prepare the
friends for a fuller understanding of the document. This version
was soon followed by the entire text.

To the friends in both the East and the West, Shoghi Effendi
repeatedly pointed out that there were hidden implications and
mysteries deposited in the provisions of the Will that would be
disclosed gradually with the passage of time. The friends initially
could not see what mysteries Shoghi Effendi was referring to, as,
for the most part, they considered the document to be a
straightforward statement focusing on the appointment of Shoghi
Effendi as the Master’s successor, the imperative need for the
friends to rally around him, and to protect the Cause under his
direction and spread it abroad throughout all nations, so that vast
multitudes would enter the Faith of God.

In one of his letters commenting on the provisions of the
Will, the Guardian stated that it would take a hundred years for
the implications of the Will and Testament to be fully and
generally understood. He stated that the friends should ‘trust to
time, and the guidance of God’s Universal House of Justice, to
obtain a clearer and fuller understanding of [the Will’s]
provisions and implications . . .’ (23 February 1924, BA 62).

Although the explicit text of the Will and Testament of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá provides for two possibilities for the election and
operation of the Universal House of Justice, namely one with a
living Guardian as its Head, and one without his direct
participation, the Bahá’ís during Shoghi Effendi’s ministry
generally did not imagine that he would be the first and last
Guardian during this Dispensation. In this connection it must be

borne in mind that, in His Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh envisages
the termination of the line of ‘Branches’ (Aghṣán) to precede the
establishment of the House of Justice: ‘After Him [the
Manifestation], this authority shall pass to the AghMán, and after
them to the House of Justice – should it be established in the
world by then . . .’ (KA ¶42). Despite this provision in the Most
Holy Book, the idea that the twin institutions of the Guardianship
and the House of Justice had to literally coexist in order for the
House of Justice to discharge its duties persisted in the minds of
the believers. It was only after the passing of Shoghi Effendi that
the Universal House of Justice clarified this issue for the friends.

C. Preparing the text of The Passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

In addition to his strenuous work on the translation of his
Grandfather’s Will and Testament, Shoghi Effendi felt that the
Bahá’í world was waiting to receive details of the events that led
to the Master’s ascension. He therefore, with the help of Lady
Blomfield, compiled all the data that was available to him on this
subject. The document that was produced was entitled The
Passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and had a subtitle which read,
‘Compiled by Shoghi Effendi and Lady Blomfield’. It was first
published in England in 1922. Shoghi Effendi immediately sent a
copy of the English text to the Local Assembly of Tehran (there
was no National Spiritual Assembly at that time) and asked that
its contents be translated into Persian and disseminated among
the friends in the East.

The document is in the form of a letter dated 19 January
1922, and is signed ‘Sitarih Khánum (Lady Blomfield)’ and then
‘Shoghi’. (‘Sitarih’ in Persian means ‘star’. The full title is a
name that was given to Lady Blomfield by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to
express His appreciation for her services to the Cause.) This
letter, which consists of some 50 pages, gives details of what
transpired immediately before the Master’s passing. It also
quotes one of the prayers of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in a Tablet to the

\[38\] THE INITIAL PERIOD OF THE GUARDIAN’S MINISTRY

friends in America, in which He yearns to take His flight to the
Kingdom. The prayer is as follows:

> Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá! (O Thou the Glory of Glories) I have
> renounced the world and the people thereof, and am heart-
> broken and sorely afflicted because of the unfaithful. In the
> cage of this world, I flutter even as a frightened bird, and
yearn every day to take my flight unto Thy Kingdom.

Ya Bahá’u’l-Abhá! Make me to drink of the cup of
> sacrifice and set me free. Relieve me from these woes and
> trials, from these afflictions and troubles. Thou art He that
> aideth, that succoureth, that protecteth, that stretcheth forth
> the hand of help. (ACC 458)

The letter goes on to quote what the friends had heard from
‘Abdu’l-Bahá during the last weeks and days of His life, all of
which clearly indicates that He knew very well that the time of
His taking leave from this world of dust was drawing nigh. This
is followed by a description of the impressive procession of
notables of the country who participated in the funeral cortège,
including the High Commissioner of Palestine, the Governor of
Phoenicia, chief officials of the government, consuls of various
countries resident in Haifa, heads of different religious com-
munities, and a host of the heart-broken friends, in all about ten
thousand in number. The booklet contains an account of the
procession walking up from the Master’s house to the site of the
Shrine on Mount Carmel, and extracts of speeches delivered on
that memorable occasion.

It further cites a number of passages from reports in such
newspapers as The Morning Post, the New York World, and the
Times of India. Telegrams sent by His Britannic Majesty’s
Secretary of State, the Council of Ministers in Baghdád, the High
Commissioner for Egypt, the Commander-in-Chief of the
Egyptian Expeditionary Force, the Theosophical Society in
London, one of the renowned professors of the University of

Oxford, and Bahá’í communities throughout the world are
enumerated. An account is given of the memorial feast that was
held, in conformity with local customs, on the fortieth day after
the Master’s passing, at which over six hundred of the people of
Haifa, ‘Akká, and adjoining regions in Palestine and Syria
attended, and reference is made to the assemblage of over a
hundred poor and needy who were also fed on that day. The
letter finally describes the gathering in the large, central hall of
the Master’s house, where speeches were delivered in
appreciation of the work and life of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

The last section consists of extracts from the Will and
Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Turning from the text of the Will to
other Tablets revealed by the Master, the letter gives extracts
from a number of His writings which indicate the glorious
unfoldment of God’s Holy Cause, including two Tablets revealed
by Him in interpretation of Daniel’s prophecy about the 1335
days. In one of these Tablets, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá indicates that the
1335 days specifically refer to the lapse of a century from the
Declaration of Bahá’u’lláh’s Mission in Baghdád (i.e. 1963.) At
such a time, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá adds, ‘will the Teachings of God be
firmly established upon the earth, and the Divine Light shall
flood the world from the East even unto the West. Then, on this
day, will the faithful rejoice’ (PA 50).

The document ends with the prayer revealed by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá which is recited as the Tablet of Visitation in His Shrine.
Immediately prior to this Tablet is the quotation of these most
touching words of the Master:

> I am waiting, waiting, to hear the joyful tidings that the
> believers are the very embodiment of sincerity and
> truthfulness, the incarnation of love and amity, the living
> symbols of unity and concord. Will they not gladden my
> heart? Will they not satisfy my yearning? Will they not
> manifest my wish? Will they not fulfil my heart’s desire? Will

they not give ear to my call? I am waiting. I am patiently
waiting. (ACC 406)

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. You have said that the House of Justice receives guid-
ance from the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. Is it such that, when you
have the meeting, you feel something special, or is it
imperceptible?

A. This question has been put to me many times. And I am sure
it is a question asked to ex-members of the House of Justice,
wherever they may be. It is asked by pilgrims when they go to
Haifa and meet House members. Everyone wants to know what
happens in the meetings of the Universal House of Justice.
Firstly, the members of the Universal House of Justice work as
nine brothers. These brothers sincerely and deeply love one
another. There is a deep love binding them together and to the
Cause of God. The meaning of this love and this bond is that the
happiness of one is the happiness of all, and the distress of one is
the distress of all. When something happens which is a source
joy to one of the members, it becomes a source of joy for the
rest. If there is a source of sadness for an individual member,
again it is a source of sadness for the rest. This, I think, is
something that does not have to occur only in Haifa. It is
something that can occur and should occur everywhere in the
world, wherever we have consultative Bahá’í bodies, whether
they are Local Assemblies, National Assemblies, committees,
Counsellors etc. It is this spirit of love that you read about in the
writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, which have been compiled for us by
Shoghi Effendi and published in the book Bahá’í Administration.
One of the first prerequisites is love among the members.

Another very important condition, which has been laid down
by Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-í-Aqdas, is this: ‘They should
consider themselves as entering the Court of the presence of
God, the Exalted, the Most High, and as beholding Him Who is
the Unseen’. That means when the members enter the Council
Chamber they feel that they are sitting in the presence of

\[42\] THE INITIAL PERIOD OF THE GUARDIAN’S MINISTRY

Bahá’u’lláh. In the Kitáb-í-Aqdas, this applies to all the Houses
of Justice, wherever they may be. It is one of the important
requirements of Bahá’í consultation. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ has given us
other conditions. When we offer our views, we should have
purity of motive. What is purity of motive? That is, the members
should think to themselves, ‘Why am I here? I am here to serve
the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. I am here to promote and to protect
the interests of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. I am not here for
myself. I am here for Bahá’u’lláh. If I speak, I should be aware
Bahá’u’lláh is listening to me. When I speak I should speak for
Him, not for myself.’ This purity of motive is itself like a
magnet. It attracts divine confirmations, whether the consultation
is on the local, the national, the continental or international level.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written: ‘In short, whatsoever thing is
arranged in harmony and with love and purity of motive, its
result is light, and should the least trace of estrangement prevail
the result shall be darkness upon darkness . . . Should they
endeavor to fulfill these conditions the Grace of the Holy Spirit
shall be vouchsafed unto them, and that assembly shall become
the center of the Divine blessings, the hosts of Divine
confirmation shall come to their aid, and they shall day by day
receive a new effusion of Spirit’ (BA 22–3).

The difference between the Universal House of Justice and
every other kind of consultative body is that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has
written in His Will and Testament: ‘That which this body,
whether unanimously or by a majority doth carry, that is verily
the truth and the purpose of God Himself. Whoso doth deviate
therefrom is verily of them that love discord, hath shown forth
malice, and turned away from the Lord of the Covenant’ (WOB
149). Bahá’u’lláh Himself has given this promise: ‘God will
verily inspire them [members of the Universal House of Justice]
with whatsoever He willeth, and He verily is the Provider, the
Omniscient’ (WOB 149).

There is an explicit guarantee that God will protect the
decisions of the Universal House of Justice, whether they are

made by unanimous or majority vote. However, when it comes to
the National and Local Spiritual Assemblies, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has
said ‘should the least trace of estrangement prevail the result
shall be darkness upon darkness’ (BA 22). There is something
wonderful about this Faith that protects it from harm. It is unique
to Bahá’í consultation. A letter on behalf of Shoghi Effendi
explains it very well: ‘The Assembly may make a mistake, but, as
the Master pointed out, if the Community does not abide by its
decisions, or the individual Bahá’í, the result is worse, as it
undermines the very institution which must be strengthened in
order to uphold the principles and laws of the Faith. He tells us
God will right the wrongs done’ (CC Vol. II, 58). This does not
exist anywhere else, whether in previous religions or in secular
institutions. It means that if a decision is influenced by the ego,
the personal interests or the prejudices of the Assembly
members, God will make sure that this decision is corrected
eventually. How does He do this? Ever since I turned 21 years
old, I have been a member of Local Assemblies and then
National Assemblies. I have seen this thing happen so many
times in my own lifetime. If the decision taken during con-
sultation is the right one, it will usually be easy and joyful to
implement. But if the decision is a wrong one, the Assembly will
find it extremely difficult to implement. There will be all kinds
of problems. At the next meeting, these problems are discussed
and a new decision made. The Finger of God interferes to stop
the implementation of the wrong decision. This is, I think, what
is meant by ‘God will right the wrongs done’.

Q. ‘The Hands of the Cause of God must elect from their own
number nine persons that shall at all times be occupied in the
important services in the work of the guardian of the Cause of
God . . . and these, whether unanimously or by a majority vote,
must give their assent to the choice of the one whom the
guardian of the Cause of God hath chosen as his successor’
(WTA 12). Why didn’t the Guardian call upon the Hands of

\[44\] THE INITIAL PERIOD OF THE GUARDIAN’S MINISTRY

the Cause to create this body of nine? Was it because he
knew that he wasn’t going to have a successor?

A. The questioner has given the answer already. I think this is a
very good answer. Shoghi Effendi had appointed the Hands of
the Cause, but he never called on them to elect nine to come to
Haifa. He appointed four to be there as a nucleus to work with
him. There were 27 Hands of the Cause and they were to choose
nine from among themselves to come to Haifa. Among their
functions was to give their assent, by secret ballot, to the
Guardian’s choice of successor. He had no son himself and all
the other Branches (Aghṣán) had become Covenant-breakers.
The son of Jináb-i-Samandarí, a very dear Bahá’í, was in Haifa
in 1957, towards the very end of Shoghi Effendi’s life. He wrote
to me a letter after his pilgrimage. He said that towards the end
of his pilgrimage, Shoghi Effendi had turned to him and told
him: ‘Look! There are no more Aghṣáns!’ After Shoghi Effendi
passed away we realized that by ‘There are no more Aghṣáns’,
he must have meant that there was no one he could appoint as his
successor, because the successor had to be a Ghuṣn (Branch).

Q. What was the prophecy of Daniel and why did Shoghi
Effendi refer to it so often in his writings?

A. The verse in the book of Daniel is as follows: ‘Blessed is he
who waits, and comes to the one thousand three hundred and
thirty-five days’ (Dan. 12: 12). Many of the biblical scholars
could not understand the meaning of this verse. When ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá was asked about the prophecy of Daniel, He provided an
explanation. He said that the beginning of the 1335 days should
be the year when the Prophet Muḥammad left Mecca and went to
Medina. Hijrah means the flight of Muḥammad from Mecca. He
started His mission in the year 610 AD. For 12 years He was in
Mecca, after which, in 622 He left Mecca, escaped from the
persecutions and went to Medina, an adjoining city. He resided

there from 622 until 630. Then, for the last two years He returned
to Mecca. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is telling us to start counting the 1335
days from the date of the Hijrah, of the flight of Muḥammad
from Mecca to Medina, which was the beginning of the Muslim
calendar. The Islamic calendar uses AH (after Hijrah) in contrast
to the Christian AD (Anno Domini). In the Bible references are
made to days, but these are interpreted as years. The year 622
plus 1335 equals 1957. This was the year when Shoghi Effendi
passed away, at the midpoint of the Ten Year Crusade.

The Declaration of Bahá’u’lláh was in Baghdád in 1963.

‘The “hundred lunar years,” destined to immediately precede
that blissful consummation (1335 days), announced by Daniel in
that same chapter, had commenced’ (GPB 151). A hundred lunar
years is equal to 97 solar years. Ninety-seven plus 1863 equals
1960\. In other letters, Shoghi Effendi interpreted the century as
100 solar years. One hundred plus 1863 equals 1963. When
Shoghi Effendi passed away in 1957, it was the midway point of
the Ten Year Crusade. In the course of 1960, the International
Bahá’i Council was elected by all the National Spiritual
Assemblies of the world, the first global election in religious
history. In April 1961 the first elected International Bahá’i
Council was formed. In 1963 a second election took place, this
time for the Universal House of Justice itself. In his letters,
Shoghi Effendi is referring to this date, 1963, as the fulfilment of
the prophecy of Daniel, which coincided with the election of the
Universal House of Justice. This was based on the following
statement made by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: ‘Now concerning the verses in
Daniel . . . these days must be reckoned as solar . . . years. For
according to this calculation a century will have elapsed from
the Dawn of the Sun of Truth, then will the teachings of God be
firmly established upon the earth, and the Divine Light shall
flood the world from the East even unto the West. Then, on this
day, will the faithful rejoice’ (MUHJ 738). That is what Shoghi
Effendi was referring to when he wrote about Daniel’s prophecy.
It was only after his passing that the Bahá’ís realized that the

\[46\] THE INITIAL PERIOD OF THE GUARDIAN’S MINISTRY

source of the rejoicing and celebration at the fulfilment of the
prophecy would be the election of the Universal House of Justice
in 1963.

Q. Soon after his appointment as Guardian, Shoghi Effendi
summoned many prominent believers to the World Centre to
consult on the formation of the Universal House of Justice.
What happened at that meeting? If he knew that he was not
going to form the House of Justice, what was the purpose of
the meeting?

A. Rúḥíyyih Khánum wrote a wonderful message on the
occasion of the twenty-fifth year of the Guardianship, in 1946.
The title of this wonderful message is ‘Twenty-five years of the
Guardianship’. In this message, Rúḥíyyih Khánum explains that
after the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in 1921, the older believers as
well as his own family were urging the Guardian to establish the
Universal House of Justice. They were telling him that he was
young, very much alone, and in need of help. They also urged
him to appoint Hands of the Cause, so that they, as well as the
Universal House of Justice, would be able to help him. Rúḥíyyih
Khánum explains that Shoghi Effendi knew very well that this
was not possible. Firstly, the time had not come for the
appointment of Hands. Shoghi Effendi waited 30 years before he
formally appointed any Hands to help him. Secondly, Shoghi
Effendi explained that the Universal House of Justice was like a
dome. It could not be suspended in mid-air. He had to lay the
foundations of the Administrative Order, and then he had to erect
the pillars to support the dome. However, because the idea of
establishing the House of Justice and the appointment of Hands
was prevalent at the time, in his wisdom, he decided to invite
some of the veteran believers to consult with him. They did not
come, as far as I know, all at once, to sit down together and
consult. They came at different times. They were Mr Mountfort
Mills from the United States, Mr Hippolyte Dreyfus from France

and Mr Fáḍil-i-Mázindarání from Iran. He spoke to them, asked
their opinion and in turn must have provided his own opinion. He
later explained that it was too early for the election of the
Universal House of Justice. This is my understanding of these
very important events of that time.

Q. The Guardian has written that we should shun
whomsoever we feel to be an enemy of the Cause? How are
we to decide who is an enemy of the Cause. Aren’t we
supposed to associate with all people with love and kindness?

A. It is important to observe that there are two types of enemies
of the Cause: those from within and those from without. An
enemy of the Cause from without could be a government, an
organization or an individual who is not a Bahá’í. For example,
you could certainly say that the government of Iran has been an
enemy of the Cause for several decades. These enemies try to
obstruct the growth of the Faith. There will be many more such
enemies in the future, as the Faith becomes stronger.

Then there are Covenant-breakers, who are internal enemies
of the Faith. These Covenant-breakers are identified by the Head
of the Faith, which then asks us not to have association with
them. Nobody has the authority to call someone a Covenant-
breaker except the Head of the Faith. When the Head of the Faith
has come to the conclusion that an individual should be re-
garded as a Covenant-breaker, it informs directly the National
Assemblies or the Boards of Counsellors. We are asked in the
Writings to pray for them, so that they may realize their mistakes
and come back to the Faith. However, we should not associate
with them because they will eventually poison our hearts. This is
the clear instruction that we have in the Writings. Every effort
would have been made to help them, before they were declared
Covenant-breakers.

If you know somebody who is antagonistic and inimical
towards the Faith, we should leave them alone and not associate

\[48\] THE INITIAL PERIOD OF THE GUARDIAN’S MINISTRY

with them. Unfortunately, it has happened in the past that
external enemies of the Faith have used spies. They would send
in young people, whom they would pay, to come and mix with
the Bahá’ís, to pretend that they wanted to become Bahá’ís, and
then to join the community. Subsequently, they would take all
the information about where the meetings were held and go back
to their own society to feed the information for fresh attacks.
This has happened and will continue to happen. This is why
Shoghi Effendi warns the National and Local Assemblies to be
very careful. He could see that opposition would come, wave
after wave. As the Faith becomes stronger, these waves of
persecution will become higher and mightier, but the Faith will
be strong enough to withstand these onslaughts, and eventually
these waves will die out, while the ship of the Cause will
continue to sail.

Q. ‘Gradually His power revived me and breathed in me a
confidence that I hope will henceforth guide me and inspire me
in my humble work of service’ (PP 40). Did Shoghi Effendi
write this before or after reading the Will and Testament?

A. The above extract is from a letter written by Shoghi Effendi
while he was still in London. My understanding is that while
Shoghi Effendi was still in London the cable from the Greatest
Holy Leaf arrived saying that Shoghi Effendi was the Guardian
of the Bahá’í Faith and Head of the Universal House of Justice.
This was the cable that the Greatest Holy Leaf sent all over the
world. Thus, he must have read that message and known that he
was to be the Guardian. However, he did not know the exact
nature of the contents of the Will. He had to arrive in the Holy
Land, before He could read it for himself.

Q. What was Shoghi Effendi’s relationship to the Greatest
Holy Leaf? How did it influence him?

A. If, soon after the passing of the Master, there was anybody
who really understood Shoghi Effendi, it was the Greatest Holy
Leaf. She was conscious of what a mystery he was. She was
aware of the potentialities God had endowed him with. I have
often said that Shoghi Effendi’s physical parents were Mírzá
Hádí and Ḍíyá’íyyih Khánum, the daughter of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, but
that his true father was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and his true mother was the
Greatest Holy Leaf. They loved this child so much, for they
knew who he really was.

I can still vividly recall the Greatest Holy Leaf in the
presence of Shoghi Effendi. Though she was no less than the
daughter of Bahá’u’lláh and the sister of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, she
showed the utmost respect in the presence of Shoghi Effendi,
who was only in his twenties at the time. If she was ill and lying
feverish in bed, and he entered the room, she made an extreme
effort to sit up in her bed. Such was the degree of reverence she,
who truly knew him, had for him.

One must bear in mind that when Shoghi Effendi took on the
role of Guardian, at the age of 24, there were very illustrious
Bahá’ís in the East and in the West who had distinguished
themselves during the days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. There was even a
Hand of the Cause living in Iran, who had been appointed by
Bahá’u’lláh. Shoghi Effendi’s early letters show an interesting
pattern. His humility is combined with his gradual yet decisive
assertion of the needs of the Faith and the duty of the Bahá’ís.
The situation was very different from the time after the ascension
of Bahá’u’lláh. All of the friends were aware that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
would succeed Him. They were conscious of the references made
to the Master in the Súriy-i-Ghuṣn and the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.

Q. ‘The time has come for the friends . . . to think not as to how
they should serve the Cause, but how the Cause should be
served’ (1923, PP 74). Could you please elaborate on what the
Guardian was conveying here?

\[50\] THE INITIAL PERIOD OF THE GUARDIAN’S MINISTRY

A. Although this quote is only two lines long, in my view, it
stands out remarkably from among the writings of the Guardian.
It was written in 1923, when he was about 26 years old. My
understanding of it is this: don’t make yourself the centre of the
universe. Those of us who think about how we can serve the
Cause could easily make our own well-being our number one
priority. If we make the well-being of the Cause our number one
priority then we will think about what the Cause needs us to do
for it. Shoghi Effendi suggests the time has come for the friends
to start to think in this way, because we are now living in the
Formative Age and the Cause has many needs.

In this connection, I would like to share with you an episode
I observed when I was about 14 or 15. A big cat came near a hen
surrounded by little chicks. The mother hen became furious and
attacked the cat, conscious that its intention was to catch one of
the chicks. The cat could have also attacked the hen, yet she
risked her own life for the sake of the chicks. That’s when I
asked myself: ‘If the hen is willing to risk her life for the chicks,
should I not do the same for the Cause of God, the most precious
thing on earth?’ And I think this relates to this sentence by
Shoghi Effendi. We should put the Cause first in our lives; it is
the most precious thing we have from God on earth today. The
sentiment is similar to the attitude of a mother towards her baby.
Everything comes after the baby, even her own life. Shoghi
Effendi is telling us to make the Cause of God the centre of our
lives; we shouldn’t expect the Cause of God to revolve around
us, we should revolve around the Cause.

Translations
A. Role of Mr George Townshend

The Guardian used the editorial services of a few friends whose
grasp of the English language he appreciated. ‘Shoghi Effendi’,
Rúḥíyyih Khánum writes, ‘was tolerant and practical in his
approach to his own work. For years he sent his translations and
manuscripts to George Townshend, whose command and know-
ledge of English he greatly admired’ (PP 204).

George Townshend was an Episcopalian minister of Anglo-
Irish background. He became a Bahá’í in 1921. From 1926
onwards he lent his editing services to Shoghi Effendi,
collaborating on such works as The Dawn-Breakers and God
Passes By, as well as making suggestions on the draft
translations of The Hidden Words, The Kitáb-i-Iqán, Gleanings
from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, Prayers and Meditations, and
Epistle to the Son of the Wolf. He finally renounced his orders in
1947, and in 1951 was appointed to the rank of Hand of the
Cause.

The working relationship between the Guardian and Mr
Townshend began when, in February of 1926, George wrote a
letter to Shoghi Effendi offering his editorial services on the
translation of the Hidden Words: ‘I have been told that you
invited Miss Rosenberg to Haifa to help in translating work . . . I
am encouraged by this to offer now my services, such as they
are, in this kind of work. Having myself no knowledge of Persian
and being a clergyman resident in Ireland, my help can not be

anything better than advice as to English idiom and grammatical
structure’ (GT 55–6).

The Guardian immediately wrote back expressing his
appreciation for the offer, and included with his letter the first
part of his translation of the Hidden Words. Later, after
Townshend’s corrections had been received, Shoghi Effendi
wrote to him in a personal note: ‘Miss Rosenberg and myself (I
wish you were with us also!) have carefully altered the text in the
light of your suggestions and I trust that it [the Hidden Words]
will soon be published in London’ (GT 58).

Shoghi Effendi continued to ask Townshend for ‘final
touches’ to his literary output for a total of 18 years. The
Guardian was particularly reliant on George’s assistance when
the pressures of his other commitments prevented him from
giving the fine-tuning of the manuscript all the time he would
have wished. A letter to Townshend written on Shoghi Effendi’s
behalf by his secretary, dated 29 December 1943, explains this
situation: ‘Had he had more time at his disposal he could have,
naturally, devoted more of it to putting the finishing touches on
his manuscript . . . [U]nfortunately . . . the work of the Cause is
so great and so pressing that he lacks the advantages enjoyed by
most authors of being able to devote themselves whole-heartedly
and single-mindedly to their task’ (GT 70–1).

In his book on the life of George Townshend, David Hofman
elaborates on this relationship: ‘The collaboration between the
Guardian and George on this great work [God Passes By]
followed the normal pattern already established between them
. . . Their modus operandi was for the Guardian to send the first
typewritten pages of the work in hand, with a description of it
and his request for George’s services’ (GT 69–70).

Despite the value he placed on such editorial input, the final
decision regarding the form and content of the work always
rested with Shoghi Effendi. Hofman underlines this fact:
‘However much he turned to George for advice on syntax,
“englishing”, polishing and refining of style, idiomatic usage and

the like, he [the Guardian] was the final arbiter who decided
whether to adopt, reject or amend any or all of George’s editorial
suggestions’ (GT 81).

B. Translations of Sacred Texts – listed chronologically

1\. The Hidden Words

Shoghi Effendi described Bahá’u’lláh’s Hidden Words as an
‘outstanding contribution . . . to the world’s religious literature’
occupying a ‘position of unsurpassed pre-eminence among the
ethical Writings of the Author of the Bahá’í Dispensation’, a
‘collection of gem-like utterances . . . with which Bahá’u’lláh
was inspired, as He paced, wrapped in His meditations, the
banks of the Tigris’, and a ‘dynamic spiritual leaven cast into the
life of the world for the reorientation of the minds of men, the
edification of their souls and the rectification of their conduct’
(GPB 140).

The book was revealed about 1858, ‘partly in Persian, partly
in Arabic, . . . originally designated the “Hidden Book of
FáOimih,” and . . . identified by its Author with the Book of that
same name, believed by Shí’ah Islám to be in the possession of
the promised Qá’im, and to consist of words of consolation
addressed by the angel Gabriel, at God’s command, to FáOimih,
and dictated to the Imám ‘Alí, for the sole purpose of comforting
her in her hour of bitter anguish after the death of her illustrious
Father’ (GPB 140). In one of His Tablets, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá exhorts
the friends not only to read this book, but to act in accordance
with its precepts. In another Tablet He points out that if
Bahá’u’lláh had revealed only the Hidden Words, and nothing
else, it would be adequate guidance for the human race. He even
urged the friends to memorize passages from the book.

There is little question why the Guardian would choose this
work to be the first of the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh to be
translated by him for the benefit of the friends in the West. Even

\[54\] TRANSLATIONS

while he was in Oxford, he tried his hand at translating portions
of the Hidden Words. One of the British friends, Ethel
Rosenberg, served Shoghi Effendi in a secretarial capacity soon
after the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The Guardian consulted with
her regarding his translation, and invited suggestions for the
improvement of the English text. As earlier stated, when George
Townshend heard of Ethel Rosenberg’s contribution, he offered
his own services in this field of activity and the offer was warmly
welcomed by Shoghi Effendi. This is why, when The Hidden
Words was first published in 1927, the frontispiece stated
‘translated by Shoghi Effendi, with the assistance of some
English friends’. Some years passed, and the Publishing Trust
thought that the latter part of the phrase was no longer
appropriate, so they suggested to Shoghi Effendi to remove it. He
approved this and it has been omitted from later editions.

This remarkable collection opens with a brief introduction by
Bahá’u’lláh Himself, in which He describes the Hidden Words as
‘the inner essence’ of what was previously ‘revealed unto the
Prophets of old’. Part one of the book consists of 71 stanzas
originally revealed in Arabic, while the second part, translated
from the Persian, consists of 82 stanzas, followed by a closing
paragraph. In this ending, Bahá’u’lláh declares that with this
book ‘the favor is complete, the argument fulfilled, the proof
manifest and the evidence established’. It is sometimes said that
the Hidden Words is only a statement of Bahá’u’lláh about ethics
and morality, but it is much more. The roots of the social
teaching are there as well.

A Bahá’í author, in evaluating the English rendering of the
Hidden Words by Shoghi Effendi, has written that it provides ‘a
clear, understandable, and beautiful text, [in] . . . a proper style of
English befitting scripture that . . . evoke[s] in the reader the
attitude of reverence and respect reserved for a religious text’
(VSE 134).

There is an excellent résumé of the contents of the Hidden
Words in the Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá’í Faith:

> In it [the Hidden Words] Bahá’u’lláh assures the reader of
> God’s love. God has made human beings noble, and they
> should cleanse their hearts so that they might find the divine
> light within themselves. The human heart is God’s home and
> the human spirit his place of revelation. This is their natural
> station, but human beings busy themselves with the world
> (‘that which perisheth’), and thus lose sight of their true
> natures. Instead, they should commune with God and free
> themselves from the ‘prison’ of self and the ‘fetters’ of
> worldly attachments. They should bring themselves to ac-
> count each day; sorrow only at their separation from God; not
> fear death; follow divine law; submit themselves to God;
> accept trials for God’s sake; ready themselves for martyr-
> dom; neither fear abasement nor rejoice in prosperity; not
> vaunt themselves over the poor (who are God’s trust), but
> rather bestow God’s wealth upon them; not breathe the sins
> of others, nor exalt themselves over others, nor commit
> iniquity; eschew covetousness, envy and malice; be forbear-
> ing with others; avoid fellowship with the ungodly; distin-
> guish themselves by their deeds; plant only ‘the rose of love’
> in the garden of the heart; and work to support themselves.
> They should know that a ‘new garden’ had appeared,
> inhabited by heavenly beings. They should seek to learn the
> mysteries of its love and wisdom. God is always close to
> them, but they heedlessly ignore him. They should seize their
> chance before the ‘fleeting moment’ of their lives is ended.

2\. The Kitáb-i-Íqán

Shoghi Effendi describes this work in the following words: ‘A
model of Persian prose, of a style at once original, chaste and
vigorous, and remarkably lucid, both cogent in argument and
matchless in its irresistible eloquence, this Book, setting forth in
outline the Grand Redemptive Scheme of God, [the Kitáb-i-Íqán]
occupies a position unequalled by any work in the entire range
of Bahá’í literature, except the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh’s
Most Holy Book’ (GPB 138–9). The Guardian also refers to the
book as a ‘unique repository of inestimable treasures’,
possessing an ‘unsurpassed pre-eminence among the doctrinal’
Writings of Bahá’u’lláh (GPB 139).

Shoghi Effendi’s English translation of this work was first
published in 1931. The great Bahá’í Persian scholar, Mírzá
Abu’l-Faḍl, used to say that as a non-believer, after reading the
Íqán, he could not fully grasp the greatness of this work.
However, when he began rereading it, with the eye of faith, he
could discover infinite pearls of wisdom concealed within the
shells of the revealed words. While ostensibly demonstrating to
the eldest uncle of the Báb, in reply to his specific questions, the
truth and validity of the Báb’s spiritual station as the Promised
One of Islam, Bahá’u’lláh also implicitly discloses in this book
or Tablet His own station, at a time when He would soon openly
declare His divine Mission. Upon receiving the Tablet, the uncle
of the Báb was very impressed, but he did not immediately
become a follower of the Faith. Some time later he did, however,
become a very devoted Bahá’í.

In a letter to an individual believer, written on his behalf,
Shoghi Effendi states that in the Íqán, ‘Bahá’u’lláh gives the
keynote and explains some of the outstanding passages [of the
scriptures of the past] hoping that the friends will continue to
study the Sacred Books by themselves and unfold the mysteries
found therein’ (CC Vol. I, 212). In another letter, also written on
his behalf, he explains that ‘The friends, and particularly those

who wish to become competent and useful teachers, should
indeed consider it to be their first duty to acquaint themselves, as
thoroughly as they can, with each and every detail contained in
this Holy Book [the Kitáb-i-Íqán], so that they may be able to
present the Message in a befitting manner. It is the Guardian’s
hope, therefore, that those among the believers who have thus far
and for some reason or another, failed to make a serious study of
this important work will be stimulated to do so, and will as a
result deepen their comprehension of the essentials of the Faith’
(Letter dated 7 August 1934).

A concise and authoritative précis of the contents of this
outstanding work of Bahá’u’lláh is found in God Passes By. The
Guardian writes:

> Within a compass of two hundred pages it proclaims
> unequivocally the existence and oneness of a personal God,
> unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation,
> eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty; asserts the
> relativity of religious truth and the continuity of Divine
> Revelation; affirms the unity of the Prophets, the universality
> of their Message, the identity of their fundamental teachings,
> the sanctity of their scriptures, and the twofold character of
> their stations; denounces the blindness and perversity of the
> divines and doctors of every age; cites and elucidates the
> allegorical passages of the New Testament, the abstruse
> verses of the Qur’án, and the cryptic MuJammadan tradi-
> tions which have bred those age-long misunderstandings,
> doubts and animosities that have sundered and kept apart the
> followers of the world’s leading religious systems; enumer-
> ates the essential prerequisites for the attainment by every
> true seeker of the object of his quest; demonstrates the

(GPB 139)

3\. Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh

This impressive compilation of the fundamental teachings of the
Author of our Faith comprises 165 selections and was first
published in 1935. The Bahá’í world cannot adequately thank the
beloved Guardian for this inestimable gift of translating vital and
significant portions of the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh.

The title was chosen by Shoghi Effendi himself. In a letter
written on his behalf, he points out that his purpose was to pro-
vide ‘to the believers a befitting and authoritative rendering of
the fundamental teachings of the Cause regarding God, soul,
creation, the nature of Divine Manifestations and similar sub-
jects’ (GT 74). When Queen Marie of Romania read the book,
given to her through Martha Root, she expressed her gratitude to
Shoghi Effendi for this ‘wonderful book, every word of which is
precious to me, and doubly so in this time of anxiety and unrest’
(PP 219). Martha Root has also reported that the Queen had told

her, regarding the contents of the Gleanings, that ‘even doubters
would find a powerful strength in it, if they would read it alone,
and would give their souls time to expand’ (PP 219).

In a letter to the American National Assembly dated 13 May
1935, the Guardian gives a list of the subjects incorporated in the
translations to facilitate the preparation of an index. The list is as
follows:

> •   Unity of Prophets
> •   Power of the Word of God
> •   Reference to the next Manifestation
> •   Nature of Divinity
> •   Unity of God
> •   Power and influence of the Cause
> •   Justice and the Bahá’í Teachings
> •   Personality and station of Bahá’u’lláh

4\. Prayers and Meditations

One of the distinctions of the Bahá’í Faith is that it has hundreds
of prayers revealed by its Founder, and a similar number by the
Centre of the Covenant, in addition to the prayers revealed by the
Báb, which are sprinkled throughout His Writings. This volume,
consisting of 339 pages and comprising 184 supplications of
various categories revealed by the pen of the Author of the Faith,
was published in English in 1938, under the title Prayers and
Meditations – a designation chosen by Shoghi Effendi himself.

When Shoghi Effendi sent his manuscript to George
Townshend for his input, Townshend was so overwhelmed by
the volume, and the uniqueness and beauty of these devotional
Writings that he wrote back to the Guardian: ‘It is very wonder-
ful. Nothing like it in the world’ (GT 76). Shoghi Effendi’s
former professor at the American University of Beirut wrote:
‘The translation of deep and poetic thoughts, such as those in the
Prayers and Meditations, requires an enormous amount of hard
work . . . I have told you before how much I marvel when I see
the quality of English that you use’ (PP 219).

Most of the prayers in this volume were originally revealed
by Bahá’u’lláh in Arabic, and perhaps a score or so were written
in Persian. They can be roughly divided into four categories:
first, those revealed for special occasions, such as the Obligatory
Prayers, the Prayer for the Dead, prayers for Riḍván and Naw-
Rúz, for the Fast, and for the Intercalary Days. A second
category consists of prayers suitable for reading on anniversaries
related to Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb, including the Tablet of
Visitation. The greatest number of prayers falls into the third
category, including prayers for the morning, when travelling, for
children, for protection, guidance, thanksgiving, praise of God’s
gifts, detachment, nearness to God, obedience, unity, stead-
fastness, assistance, forgiveness, and spiritual advancement. This
category also includes prayers for departed souls, for healing,
and for the victory of the Faith. The final category consists of

\[62\] TRANSLATIONS

pure meditations of Bahá’u’lláh, covering such subjects as His
contemplation of God’s bountiful grace, His own plight in the
hands of His opponents, and reflections on His evanescence in
the face of God’s compelling Will. This category of meditations
seems to be primarily meant for personal reflection. Some of
them are long; the longest one covers 22 pages.

Cases have been reported of people who felt they did not
have the capacity, or possibly willingness, to believe in the
existence of an All-Merciful God, who, after pondering the
contents of this volume, developed the inner sensitivity of
accepting the reality of a Divine Creator, and recognized the
need to turn humbly in supplication to Him, seeking guidance,
protection and assistance.

5\. Epistle to the Son of the Wolf

Revealed in 1891, this 181-page Tablet was Bahá’u’lláh’s last
major work. The ‘Wolf’ was a title given by Bahá’u’lláh to
Shaykh Muḥammad Báqir, who was responsible for the harass-
ment of Bábís and Bahá’ís in Iṣfahán, and particularly the killing
of two brothers in that city, the ‘King’ and ‘Beloved’ of martyrs.
The ‘son of the Wolf’, Shaykh Muḥammad Taqí, not only sup-
ported these tyrannical acts, but was often willing to participate
in the execution of his father’s oppressive religious decrees.

Shoghi Effendi, referring to the Epistle, states that in this
Tablet, which was the last outstanding Tablet revealed by Him,
Bahá’u’lláh ‘calls upon that rapacious priest to repent of his
acts, quotes some of the most characteristic and celebrated
passages of His own Writings, and adduces proofs establishing
the validity of His Cause’ (GPB 219). Rúḥíyyih Khánum
describes this Tablet as occupying ‘a special position of its own
in the literature of our Faith’ (PP 222). In one of his cables,
Shoghi Effendi expressed the hope that the study of this major
work of Bahá’u’lláh would ‘contribute further enlightenment
deeper understanding verities on which effective prosecution

teaching administrative undertakings ultimately depend’ (PP
221).

A summary of the contents of this Tablet is given in the
Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá’í Faith, as follows:
‘Bahá’u’lláh called on the shaykh to repent of his wrongdoing
and beseech God’s forgiveness; declared his own mission to be
God’s cause; summarized some of his own teachings and cited
passages from his own earlier works; noted the transforming
effect he had had on the Bábís (turning them away from sedition
to goodly deeds); called for protection for his followers from
religious persecution and martyrdom; presented biblical pro-
phecies fulfilled by his coming; [and] lamented the behaviour of
Ṣubḥ-i-Azal and his followers . . .’ (CEBF 133).

The receipt of the Epistle only inflamed the fury of the
shaykh. There is little doubt that the Manifestation of God would
have known what the reaction to His call would be, especially on
the part of such a despicable character. We can well assume that
Bahá’u’lláh’s intention may have been to provide for believers
and seekers alike an anthology of His major pronouncements
during His Ministry. One of the distinctive features of this Tablet
is that Bahá’u’lláh quotes passages from Writings He had
previously revealed, as indicated by the Guardian above.

The nature of revelation has been described by Bahá’u’lláh
in the Tablet of Wisdom, in which He says that whenever He
wishes to quote from what is revealed or written in the past, there
appears ‘before the face of thy Lord in the form of a tablet all
that which hath appeared in the world and is revealed in the
Holy Books and Scriptures’ (TB 149). It might not to be unwar-
ranted to infer that whenever He was quoting from previously
revealed Tablets, He would essentially rereveal them at the given
time. This conclusion would seem to be confirmed by the fact
that, in more than one case, a slight difference of wording, but
not of meaning, exists between the two versions of the text.
Shoghi Effendi, when rendering his translations, took notice of
these changes, and adjusted his own English text accordingly.

6\. Translated passages selected from the Writings of the Central
Figures of the Faith included in Shoghi Effendi’s letters and
other works

In ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablets, we sometimes come across quota-
tions of passages revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in support of subjects
the Master is addressing. This practice was followed by Shoghi
Effendi, and indeed raised to the level of a consummate skill. He
was wont to quote liberally from the Writings of the Central
Figures of the Faith whenever he felt that those passages would
either confirm or shed a new light on his theme.

Three of the Guardian’s major works have the distinction of
quoting profusely from the Writings: these are the Advent of
Divine Justice, The Promised Day is Come, and God Passes By.
Some of these passages had already been translated in previous
works, such as Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh.
However, quite a number were renderings shared with the friends
for the first time. Of this latter category we find the greatest
number in The Promised Day is Come. Of particular interest are
the quotations included by him towards the end of The Advent of
Divine Justice. These nine pages of citations consist of a series of
paragraphs, each of which treats a separate subject. Some of the
themes are as follows: the blessedness of individual services, the
importance of God’s mighty Day, the omnipotent power of
God’s Revelation, the heedlessness of the world and its godless
civilization, the adversities and oppositions ordained for the
Bahá’í community, the need to arise to teach, to scatter and to
proclaim the Faith of God, and the promise that a new race of
men would rise to ensure the victory of the Faith.

C. Comments on Shoghi Effendi’s genius in his translation
work

In Star of the West, Vol. 14, we read a note from the editor of
this periodical reminiscing about his pilgrimage in Haifa in 1919.

He writes, ‘When we were sitting in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá one evening in Haifa in the autumn of 1919, He spoke of
the need of a great Bahá’í translator, like Fitzgerald, whose
masterful translation made famous the poems of the Persian poet,
‘Umar Khayyám’ (SW Vol. 14, No. 8, 250).

There is an immature and indeed faulty conception in the
teachings promulgated by the churches in Christianity to the
effect that after the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, in the wake of the
Pentecostal episode, His disciples were suddenly blessed by the
gift of speaking in other tongues. According to the Bible,
‘tongues like as of fire’ (Acts 2: 3) came and sat on the heads of
these disciples, and when they came out of the meeting, they
found that they could speak in all tongues. It is the belief of some
of the churches that this gift allowed them to spread abroad the
teachings of Christ in many lands by enabling the disciples to
speak in the language of the local people. The metaphorical style
used in this passage has been, unfortunately, misunderstood.
Certainly what was meant by ‘tongue’ was the ability of the
Disciples to adapt their teaching to the degree of receptivity of
the people. It was the gift of wisdom in their utterance rather
than linguistic capacity which was intended. Webster’s dic-
tionary defines one of the meanings of the word ‘tongue’ as: ‘the
manner or quality of utterance, with respect to the sense of what
is expressed or the intention of the speaker’.

In this Dispensation, we see that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá needed a
translator to interpret the talks He delivered in the West. There
is, for instance, a little notebook on display in the International
Archives Building which includes words in English with their
phonetic pronunciation, as well as their meaning, written in
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s own hand. It is also known that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
was able to say a few simple sentences in English during His
Western tours, but as stated above, He needed an interpreter for
His major talks.

It is in this light that we have to understand the plan of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá not only to send Shoghi Effendi to school to learn

\[66\] TRANSLATIONS

languages other than his own, but eventually to send him to one
of the colleges of Oxford University to perfect his English.
During the period when he was in England, in personal letters to
some of his friends Shoghi Effendi made such comments as
these:

> I have been immersed in my studies – all having as an end a
> better ability in translating the words of Baha’u’llah and a
> fuller knowledge and better expression in expounding its
> principles. (The Chosen Highway, and SEO 77)

> I am engaged in this land, day and night, in perfecting my-
> self in the art of translation . . . I do not have a moment’s
> rest. Thank God that to some extent at least the results are
> good. (PP 37)

> God be praised, I am in good health and full of hope and
> trying to the best of my ability to equip myself for those
> things I shall require in my future service to the Cause. My
> hope is that I may speedily acquire the best that this country
> and this society have to offer and then return to my home and
> recast the truths of the Faith in a new form, and thus serve the
> Holy Threshold. (PP 37)

These quotations indicate the degree of importance Shoghi
Effendi attached to his studies in Oxford. Nevertheless, in his
initial efforts at translation he depended a great deal on such of
his English friends as Lady Blomfield and Ethel Rosenberg to
assist him.

As we have already indicated, his earliest translation work
was his rendering of the full text of the Will and Testament of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá into English. Likewise, we have seen that in
drafting The Passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, he found it necessary to
translate several passages from the Master’s utterances. It should
be remembered that even during this early period Shoghi Effendi

was fully aware of the intention of the Authors whose Writings
he was interpreting. For example in his rendering of the text of
the Will and Testament, we find the following sentence: ‘[The
Ḥuqúq] is to be offered through the guardian of the Cause of
God, that it may be expended for . . .’ (WTA 15).

In the original Persian, the word translated here as ‘through’
is ‘raji’-bi’, which normally means ‘reverts to’. However, in the
context of the Master’s Will, Shoghi Effendi chose to translate
this term as ‘through’, possibly with the intention of drawing the
attention of the friends to the fact that he, as Guardian, was
merely the vehicle through which this fixed offering was to be
dispensed at that particular time.

While Shoghi Effendi was in London, he tried his hand at
translating the writings of Bahá’u’lláh, rendering passages from
the Hidden Words, various Tablets and Bahá’u’lláh’s letters to
the kings and rulers. He would send his translations to deepened
and well-seasoned British Bahá’ís, or to one or two of his
professors, for their input on the quality of his work.

However, when he returned to the Holy Land after ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s passing, as stated above, he found that his first duty was
to translate into English the full text of the Master’s Will and
Testament. One can well imagine how difficult and challenging
this task must have been, as he was so deeply afflicted by the
loss of his Grandfather. The modesty of Shoghi Effendi is
immediately apparent when the reader notices that throughout
the Will, ‘guardian’ is spelled with a small ‘g’, and likewise, the
word ‘branch’, when applied to himself, is lower-cased. This
modesty must have been combined with his wisdom in not
giving the impression to the friends in the West that he was in
any way claiming the same station as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. However,
13 years later, when he was writing ‘The Dispensation of
Bahá’u’lláh’, and it was necessary to quote from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
Will, we see that passages referring to himself as ‘Guardian’ or
‘Branch’ are capitalized – perhaps because he must have felt that

\[68\] TRANSLATIONS

the friends in the West had by then understood the exalted
position of the Office he was occupying.

In The Priceless Pearl, Rúḥíyyih Khánum relates that Shoghi
Effendi told her, in reference to his position as Head of the
Universal House of Justice, that although he had substituted the
milder term of ‘member for life’ in his rendering of the Master’s
Will, the exact translation would have been ‘irremovable’. We
can never confidently assume we know what Shoghi Effendi’s
motivation was, as it could have been a combination, again, of
both modesty and wisdom (PP 203–4).

A set of prayers which the friends in the East read on the
occasion of memorial gatherings, known as ‘the Exalted Words’
(Kalimát-i-‘Áliyát), revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in both Arabic and
Persian, should be mentioned in this discussion. The arrangement
of these prayers is such that the text is revealed first in Arabic,
followed by a rendition by Bahá’u’lláh Himself in the Persian
tongue. The series is revealed in this way, in pairs, first in
Arabic, then in Persian. Bahá’u’lláh, however, does not content
Himself with a simple translation: the tone of the prayers is
equally elevated and exalted in both languages. We may assume
that Shoghi Effendi could have been inspired to follow the
example of Bahá’u’lláh, except that he was now translating from
an oriental language, with its particular imagery, into a western
tongue.

In his prefatory note to the text of his translation of the Kitáb-
i-Íqán, we read the following two sentences:

> This is one more attempt to introduce to the West, in lang-
> uage however inadequate, this book of unsurpassed pre-
> eminence among the writings of the Author of the Bahá’í
> Revelation. The hope is that it may assist others in their
> efforts to approach what must always be regarded as the
> unattainable goal – a befitting rendering of Bahá’u’lláh’s
> matchless utterance. (KI vii)

Shoghi Effendi is not saying that the original is clear and his
translation is not. He is saying that he will never be able, and no
one will ever be able, to approach that matchless excellence
which is the utterance of Bahá’u’lláh. The original has that
special quality. The quotation has nothing to do with the clarity
of his translation, it is about the majesty of Bahá’u’lláh’s style.

One of my associates, who is himself a scholar and expert
translator, once wrote me the following comment on the quality
of Shoghi Effendi’s translations:

> [H]is translations set a new standard of excellence in the field
> which was not only relatively speaking better than anything
> that had gone before it, but which stood on its own merits
> side by side with the finest scriptural expressions in the
> English language, far transcending any rendering that had yet
> been made of the Muslim scriptures. So eloquent, natural
> and stirring was the language, so beautiful the thoughts
> expressed, so memorable and poignant the turns of phrase, so
> vivid and powerful the imagery, that it was possible for the
> English reader temporarily to forget [it] was something not
> originally revealed in his own tongue. (MH 30/5/96)

Unlike all other translators of Bahá’í scripture before him,
Shoghi Effendi, in his capacity as Interpreter or Expounder of the
Writings, had the unique capacity, during his ministry, not only
to translate but actually to unveil before our eyes the Author’s
full intention in writing the text. It is because of this
consideration that Shoghi Effendi invariably advised National
Assemblies in non-English-speaking lands to use his translations
as a basis for their renderings in other languages. In order to
grasp the implications of this basic fact a few examples are given
below:

1\. In Persian and Arabic, short vowels are not included in the
regular alphabet. Thus a word could be read in more than one

\[70\] TRANSLATIONS

way, and the sense would be deduced from the context of the
sentence. Two such words in the Arabic are ‘uqáb’ and ‘iqáb’. In
some previous translations of the Persian Hidden Words, the
translators assumed that the intention of Bahá’u’lláh was ‘uqáb’,
meaning ‘eagle’. Shoghi Effendi’s translation indicates that
Bahá’u’lláh had in mind ‘iqáb’, meaning ‘retribution’. Thus we
read in Persian Hidden Words, No. 63: ‘O YE PEOPLES OF
THE WORLD! Know, verily, that an unforeseen calamity is
following you, and that grievous retribution awaiteth you.’ The
early translations referred to a dangerous ‘eagle’ pursuing the
people of the world.

2\. In the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the text about the ‘Order’ of
Bahá’u’lláh, when read word for word, reads as follows: ‘Order
has been upset by reason of this most great order, and
arrangement of things has been changed because of this new way
– a way that the people of the world have not yet seen.’ The
friends in the East, and indeed the scholars among them,
understood this verse to refer to the style and format of the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas, as being different or distinct from the order of
verses revealed in past religious scriptures. When, in 1934,
Shoghi Effendi produced his translation, it was clear that the
‘order of things’ was a reference to ‘mankind’s ordered life’, and
that the ‘new order’ was Bahá’u’lláh’s new World Order. Thus
we could read, ‘The world’s equilibrium hath been upset through
the vibrating influence of this most great, this new World Order.
Mankind’s ordered life hath be revolutionized through the
agency of this unique, this wondrous System – the like of which
mortal eyes have never witnessed’ (KA ¶181).

3\. On page 168 of Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh,
there is a passage the original of which is in the Persian
language. If translated word for word, it would read something
like this: ‘The beginning and the end, as well as stillness and
motion, is manifest. In this day the beginning is seen in the end,

and motion has arisen from stillness.’ Many of the friends in
Persia had great difficulty in comprehending Bahá’u’lláh’s
intention, and different understandings developed among them,
until Shoghi Effendi’s translation appeared in Gleanings: ‘He
Who is both the Beginning and the End, He Who is both Stillness
and Motion, is now manifest before your eyes. Behold how, in
this Day, the Beginning is reflected in the End, how out of
Stillness, Motion hath been engendered’ (Gls LXXXV).

4\. In the paragraph immediately preceding the penultimate
paragraph of the Tablet of Aḥmad, we read: ‘Learn well this
Tablet, O AJmad. Chant it during thy days . . . God hath
ordained for the one who chants it . . .’ and in the penultimate
paragraph, we read: ‘Should one who is in affliction or grief read
this Tablet . . .’. In the paragraph before the penultimate one,
Bahá’u’lláh twice exhorts Aḥmad to ‘chant’ the Tablet, whereas
in the penultimate paragraph, the exhortation is to ‘read’ the
Tablet. For the average Persian or Arabic reader, the two ‘chants’
and the final ‘read’ are all derivatives of the root ‘to read’.
However, Shoghi Effendi as Interpreter chose to translate the
first occurrences of this derivative as an act of chanting. It is
interesting that the two ‘chants’ occur in the paragraph where
reference is made to the ‘reward of a hundred martyrs and a
service in both worlds’, whereas the word ‘read’ is in connection
with someone who is in affliction or grief. Could it be that
chanting calls for a form of ecstatic transport and an inner sense
of rapture, which would be closer to the state of surrendering our
will to the Will of God?

5\. In Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 340,
reference is made to the ‘lesser’ and ‘greater worlds’: ‘The All-
Merciful hath conferred upon man the faculty of vision . . . Some
have described him as the “lesser world,” when, in reality, he
should be regarded as the “greater world.”’ In Prayers and
Meditations, on p. 49, we find another reference to the two

\[72\] TRANSLATIONS

worlds, but in this case ‘Lesser’, ‘Greater’ and indeed ‘Worlds’
are all capitalized: ‘Wishing to reveal Thyself, Thou didst call
into being the Greater and Lesser Worlds, and didst choose Man
above all Thy creatures, and didst make Him a sign of both of
these worlds . . .’.

We are bound to infer that the capitalization used by Shoghi
Effendi carries the essential element of interpretation. It is useful
to remember that in the Guardian’s translations, he always
employs upper case to denote God and His Manifestations.
However, in other situations, such as when he is referring to the
human race, he uses lower case. There is no system of capital-
ization in either Persian or Arabic. This is something peculiar to
many of the western languages, including English. Even the
French have some reservation about using too many capitals.
They don’t use them often. But in English it is not so! In the
Authorized translation of the Bible the translators have made
much use of capitalization. This is the nature of the language.
When Shoghi Effendi was translating into English, he used all
the tools of the language. Then, into this frame, which consists of
the grammatical regulations and the syntactical regulations, he
pours in his interpretation. Sometimes it is majuscule, sometimes
it is minuscule, and thus we have the benefit of his interpretation.
A foolish person or a foolish publisher would say ‘Oh, there is a
mistake here. Obviously capitalization should always be used.’
Then they would probably check with some Persian Bahá’í or
non-Bahá’í or an Arab and they would see that it is the same
word! This is why the manuscripts of Shoghi Effendi’s trans-
lations are precious! In the Archives Building is kept everything
which he wrote, whether by hand or using his typewriter. They
are preserved there, so that they remain intact. There we can
verify that there is capitalization in one case and not in another.

The original word used by Bahá’u’lláh in both the passage
from Gleanings and that from Prayers and Meditations is
‘insan’, which means ‘man’. The Guardian understood the
statement in Gleanings to refer to man as a member of the human

race, whereas from the context of the original in Prayers and
Meditations he concluded that the word ‘insan’ was a reference
to the Manifestation of God (Gls CLX and PM XXXVIII).
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in Some Answered Questions, clarifies the
distinction between these two stations in the following words:

> [T]his terrestrial globe at one time did not exist, and at its
> beginning man did not appear upon it. But from the
> beginning which has no beginning, to the end which has no
> end, a Perfect Manifestation always exists. This Man of
> Whom we speak is not every man; we mean the Perfect Man.

(SAQ 196)

It would be helpful to compare extracts from two early
translations by others of the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, in order
appreciate the degree of excellence that characterized Shoghi
Effendi’s renditions:

1\. An English translation of the Hidden Words was published
by the Cairo Bahá’í Assembly in 1921, just prior to the passing
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The translation was made by Mrs J. Stannard,
and was considered in the West as being the best rendition thus
far of this major work of the Blessed Beauty. The translation of
Arabic Hidden Word number 3 reads: ‘O Son of Man! In my
ancient and eternal Being, knew I my love in thee, therefore did I
create thee, and laid on thee My Image, and revealed to thee My
Beauty.’ Shoghi Effendi’s rendering of this stanza is as follows:
‘O SON OF MAN! Veiled in My immemorial being and in the
ancient eternity of My essence, I knew My love for thee;
therefore I created thee, have engraved on thee Mine image and
revealed to thee My beauty’ (HW Arabic, No. 3).

2\. At a time when E.G. Browne was still well-disposed
towards the Faith, he translated the Tablet of Bahá’u’lláh to
Náṣiri’d-Dín Sháh. We set out below the rendition this well-

\[74\] TRANSLATIONS

known English scholar, who had studied both Persian and Arabic
thoroughly, made of this Tablet, and Shoghi Effendi’s translation
of the same passage.

E.G. Browne’s version reads: ‘O King, verily I was as (any)
one amongst mankind, slumbering upon my couch. The gales of
the All-Glorious passed by me, and taught me the knowledge of
what has been . . . This is a leaf which the breezes of the Will of
thy Lord, the Mighty, the Extolled, have stirred. Can it be still
when the rushing winds blow? No, by the Lord of the Names and
Attributes! Rather do they move it as they list (for) Being
belongeth not to Non-entity in presence of the Eternal . . . O
King, look with the gaze of justice upon thy servant; then
decide according to the right concerning what hath befallen
him’ (TN 395).

Shoghi Effendi’s translation is as follows: ‘O King! I was but
a man like others, asleep upon My couch, when lo, the breezes of
the All-Glorious were wafted over Me, and taught Me the
knowledge of all that hath been . . . This is but a leaf which the
winds of the will of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Praised, have
stirred. Can it be still when the tempestuous winds are blowing?
Nay, by Him Who is the Lord of all Names and Attributes! They
move it as they list. The evanescent is as nothing before Him
Who is the Ever-Abiding . . . Look upon this Youth, O King, with
the eyes of justice; judge thou, then, with truth concerning what
hath befallen Him’ (SLH 98).

The friends all over the world, and more particularly through-
out the English-speaking West, should be grateful to the Blessed
Beauty that through the operation of His All-Compelling Will,
He provided for His ‘sacred and youthful branch’ the ‘primal
branch of the Divine and Sacred Lote-Tree’ to be not only the
Head of His Faith after ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, but also the peerless
translator and interpreter of the Holy Writ (WTA 11 and 3).

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. If knowledge is a light that God casts into the heart of
whomsoever He willeth, and we know that the Manifestation
has not undertaken any schooling, why is the gift of language
not conferred upon these suns and their moons?

A. I don’t know. But it is important to remember that ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá was not a Manifestation of God. Bahá’u’lláh was a
Manifestation of God. One of Their powers of the Manifestations
of God is that They are ‘omniscient at will’ (UD 449). This
means that They know whatever They want, whenever They
want. Bahá’u’lláh has written: ‘Thou knowest full well that We
perused not the books which men possess and We acquired not
the learning current amongst them, and yet whenever We desire
to quote the sayings of the learned and of the wise, presently
there will appear before the face of thy Lord in the form of a
tablet all that which hath appeared in the world and is revealed
in the Holy Books and Scriptures’ (TB 149). That is one of the
qualities of all the Manifestations of God, not only Bahá’u’lláh.
A Manifestation of God, Bahá’u’lláh says, can do anything. He
has the power given by God to do anything. Remember the story
of the messenger sent by the divines to meet Bahá’u’lláh in
Baghdád. The messenger asked Bahá’u’lláh to vindicate the high
station that the people attributed to Him. He told the messenger,
‘Go thou to the people, and tell them: “Ask whatsoever ye
please. Powerful is He to do what He willeth. Nothing
whatsoever, be it of the past or of the future, can frustrate His
Will.” Say: “O ye congregation of the divines! Choose any
matter ye desire, and ask your Lord, the God of Mercy, to reveal
it unto you. If He fulfil your wish, by virtue of His sovereignty,
believe ye then in Him, and be not of those that reject His truth”’
(Gls LXVII). What a statement to make! They could have said
that they wanted Him to speak in all the languages of the world!

\[76\] TRANSLATIONS

Q. You said that the meaning of the Apostles speaking in
tongues has been misunderstood by many Christians. Where
is the reference for this interpretation?

A. This explanation, as I recall, was taken from one of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s table talks that were published in Star of the West. The
article is a written version of an oral statement of the Master.
Beyond this, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written that ‘shining stars’ will
arise in the Bahá’í Faith who will ‘speak in every tongue’. It is
clear what He intended to say (Sels 252, 251).

Q. Before the first translations of the Guardian, except for
The Hidden Words published in Cairo, were any of the
Writings of Bahá’u’lláh available to the friends of the West?

A. In addition to The Hidden Words as is mentioned here, there
was the Kitáb-i-Iqán, which was translated by ‘Alí Qúlí Khán
into English. In the days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá there were many
prayers revealed by Bahá’u’lláh that were translated into
English. They were not published as a prayer book as such, but
were found in the early volumes of Star of the West. A number of
Tablets, including the Tablet of Visitation and Tablet of Carmel,
for example, were translated and published. But they were all
sprinkled in various volumes of Star of the West.

Q. The friends in the West had heard ‘Abdu’l-Bahá say
wonderful things about the Hidden Words, and they had
been translated previous to Shoghi Effendi’s edition. Were
the friends in the East equally aware of this station of the
Hidden Words?

A. Many of them would have been aware, but not all, because
not all the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Bahá’u’lláh were
available to the friends everywhere. There were no publishing

trusts in those days. The first publication of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Writings was made in 1890 in India. The Writings of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá were circulated written in longhand, but not printed until
towards the end of the Master’s life. They would be available in
various kinds of photographic prints so that the friends would be
able to read them.

In the West, similar things took place. If someone received a
letter or a translation in the West, he would sit down and put four
or five carbons in his typewriter and make copies so that he
could distribute it to his friends and tell them to make even more
copies. This was how the Tablets were available to the friends.

Q. According to Shi’ih belief, there are other books in the
possession of the Imáms, as well as the Hidden Book of
FáIimih. Is there anything mentioned in the Bahá’í writings
concerning these books?

A. I have not seen any myself. I have not read every single
Tablet of Bahá’u’lláh, but in the ones that I have read, I have
found no reference to books in the possession of the Imáms, such
as the Hidden Words.

Q. The Hidden Book of FáIimih is said ‘to consist of words of
consolation addressed by the angel Gabriel, at God’s
command, to Fá*imih, and dictated to the ‘Imam ‘Alí, for the
sole purpose of comforting her in her hour of bitter anguish
after the death of her illustrious Father’ (GPB 140). Where is
the association between the Book of FáIimih and the Hidden
Words, since the latter consists of a code of ethical
behaviour? How does this correlate with words of
consolation? Is it our limited capacity that prevents us from
understanding the connection?

A. Actually, there are some very clear references to death in the
Hidden Words. Take, for example, the well-known verse, ‘O

\[78\] TRANSLATIONS

SON OF THE SUPREME! I have made death a messenger of joy
to thee. Wherefore dost thou grieve? I made the light to shed on
thee its splendor. Why dost thou veil thyself therefrom?’ (HW
No. 32, Arabic) Could this not be seen as a consolation to
someone in grief? There are also many passages that refer to
death in an indirect way.

However, the really important aspect of this book is that it
contains all the eternal and heavenly principles of life. This
would have lifted Fáṭimih to a higher level of realization and
faith. It would have raised her thinking to the station of maturity,
by enhancing her values and enriching her spiritual insights. In
this way, it is an indirect consolation to the heart of somebody
who is grieving.

Q. Several passages in Gleanings deal with the subject of the
transmutation of metals and the Divine Elixir. I find these
very difficult to understand, probably because I am
unfamiliar with the ancient art of alchemy. What is the
meaning of these statements?

A. It is possible that the statements have a spiritual meaning as
well as a physical one. The Divine Elixir is a reference to the
Word of God, which can transmute the copper of our souls into
gold. The Word of God can transmute the copper of the majority
of humanity into gold too, bringing about the Golden Age of the
Cause. God has this power, the Faith has this power. Thus, trans-
mutation is sometimes clearly referred to in a spiritual sense. As
Bahá’u’lláh states: ‘These few have been endued with the Divine
Elixir that can, alone, transmute into purest gold the dross of the
world, and have been empowered to administer the infallible
remedy for all the ills that afflict the children of men’ (Gls XCII).

However, it is also true that metal can be transmuted. Copper
can become gold, and, in fact, gold can become copper. This
type of transmutation is done through the bombardment of the
atom with subatomic particles, which is an extremely expensive

process. Therefore, it is still cheaper to produce gold by mining
than by atomic bombardment. I don’t think Bahá’u’lláh was
referring to atomic bombardment. He was talking about alchemy.
He meant that there is a real elixir which can be applied to baser
metals to transform them into gold.

Bahá’u’lláh has given us three signs for the maturity of the
world. These three signs are mentioned in the annotations of The
Kitáb-i-Aqdas. One is the adoption of a universal language. The
second is the time when the rulers will not be willing to assume
leadership. The third is the discovery of a radical approach to the
transmutation of elements. Bahá’u’lláh received many letters
from Bahá’ís who wanted to know how to change copper into
gold! He did not give direct answers and He used a veiled
language. I can assure you that if you read them you’d not under-
stand! If a compilation were made of all He wrote about alchemy
it would be the size of the Kitáb-i-Íqán. I myself have read and
reread them. Bahá’u’lláh says that He has used a veiled language
so that robbers and thieves will not abuse this knowledge. When
humanity is mature, Bahá’u’lláh will remove the veil.

It is just like what Shoghi Effendi said about the Will and
Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: ‘To attempt to estimate its full
value, and grasp its exact significance after so short a time since
its inception would be premature and presumptuous on our part.
We must trust to time, and the guidance of God’s Universal
House of Justice, to obtain a clearer and fuller understanding of
its provisions and implications’ (BA 62). For many years,
nobody understood much about the Aghṣán and the matter of
succession. After the passing of Shoghi Effendi, the Universal
House of Justice was able to clarify the matter for us. They wrote
three long letters about it. The first is called ‘The Guardianship’,
the second ‘Election and Infallibility of the Universal House of
Justice’, and the third ‘The Guardianship and the Universal
House of Justice’. These letters can be found in a thick book
called Messages from the Universal House of Justice 1963–1986.
They lifted the veil for all of us to see.

\[80\] TRANSLATIONS

Q. Sometimes, for example in the Epistle to the Son of the
Wolf, Bahá’u’lláh Himself reveals a Tablet a second time.
Why is it that He sometimes changed a word or two? Is it
because He did not remember the original word and so He
put in a new word instead, or He was not satisfied with the
original?

A. We have to understand this very clearly. When Bahá’u’lláh
rerevealed His Tablets, some were repeated exactly as before,
while in the case of those that were altered, the degree of change
varied from case to case. One Tablet He rerevealed was a very
outstanding Tablet, the Súriy-i-Haykal. He wrote it in the early
years of His ministry, addressing the Bábí community at that
time. Later, when He wanted it to be part of His major works, He
rerevealed it and made some major changes to it. The essence of
it, maybe 90 to 95 per cent, remained the same. However, He
deliberately changed parts of it, so that instead of addressing the
Bábí community, it now addressed all the peoples of the world.

In other cases, such as in the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf,
there are minor changes, often just one word. Look at how
careful Shoghi Effendi was in his translation. He did not just
reuse the translation of the Tablet he had included previously, for
example, in Gleanings. He checked word by word to make sure
that what he translated was exactly what was rerevealed.

Why did Bahá’u’lláh change one word here or another word
there? I do not know. Who knows the mind of Bahá’u’lláh?
What I wanted to show you was the loyalty, the faithfulness, the
carefulness of Shoghi Effendi in his translation work. We will
never be able to understand fully the mind of Bahá’u’lláh. It is
impossible. He said that whenever He wanted something of the
past it would come before Him in the form of a Tablet and He
would just read it, whether it was His own Writings or the
writings of anybody who came before Him. If He decided to
change a word, perhaps it was for the sake of the recipient of the
Epistle to the Son of the Wolf.

Q. Could you please elaborate on the significance of the word
‘chant’ used in the Tablet of A%mad? Does this mean that we
should always try to chant the Tablet, even if we are reading
it in a language other than Arabic or Persian?

A. The word ‘chant’ that Shoghi Effendi has used here is, in my
opinion, an expression of ecstasy, of rapture, of spiritual
upliftment and exhilaration. This is my understanding. It does
not necessarily mean that if you are reading it in a language other
than Arabic you should burst into singing it. Far from it! I think
there is an inner meaning. When we read this Tablet, it should be
with a sense of spiritual excitement, ecstasy, rapture, happiness
and joy. All the martyrs, when they went to their field of
martyrdom, did so with great joy. They did it for the sake of
Bahá’u’lláh, as an act of love. This is the point, not that you
should suddenly burst into singing that particular paragraph or
that you should chant the entire Tablet. Basically, when we read
it we should be in that condition of spiritual attunement to the
music of the Kingdom. This is when you surrender your will to
the Will of God. When you read the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh
about the meaning of martyrdom, He says that there are two
types of martyrdom, physical martyrdom and spiritual
martyrdom. Physical martyrdom is very clear. Spiritual
martyrdom, He says, is when you submit, surrender, and you
subordinate your will to the Will of God. This attitude of
detachment – from your own wishes, from your own will, from
your own preferences, in favour of the Will of God, whatever
may be His good-pleasure, is what represents true spiritual
martyrdom. If you are able to surrender your will to the Will of
God, you have attained the condition of supreme martyrdom.
You are then detached and you are happy about your
detachment. You are freeing your soul from the attachments of
this world and you are happy.

\[82\] TRANSLATIONS

On the subject of chanting, Shoghi Effendi has written that
Persian, Arabic and Hebrew lend themselves to chanting. Other
languages do not quite lend themselves. Some do, and I am of
the opinion that Italian is one of them; but not all.

In English there is a tendency to put the accent of a word, if it
is more than one syllable, at the beginning. If the word has only
one syllable, obviously the accent is on it. Once it becomes two
syllables, there is a tendency in English to put the accent on the
first syllable, not on the second. There are other languages, such
as Persian, Arabic and Hebrew, that put the accent on the second
and not on the first. If there are three syllables, there is a
tendency in English again to push the accent towards the
beginning. It is either on the first or the second syllable. But in
Persian, for example, the accent is often on the final syllable.

Q. Who translated most of the prayers in our prayer books?

A. I think most, if not all, of the prayers of Bahá’u’lláh that you
find in the prayer books were translated by Shoghi Effendi.
However, when it comes to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, it is mixed. Some of
them are translations by Shoghi Effendi, some are translations by
others. These have been checked with the original texts from
‘Abdu’l-Bahá that are at the World Centre and they were
considered to be acceptable. Regarding the prayers of the Báb,
except for the ‘Remover of Difficulties’ and perhaps one other
short one, they were translated by the World Centre under the
authority of the Universal House of Justice.

Q. Who is the author of A Concise Encyclopaedia of the
Bahá’í Faith?

A. Dr Peter Smith.

Q. You said that Professor Browne made some translations
of Bahá’u’lláh’s writings at a time when he was still well

disposed towards the Faith. What does this mean? Was there
a time that he was not well disposed towards the Faith?

A. There was a time when he was very well disposed. In the
beginning, when he first travelled to Iran, he was truly unbiased,
and he wrote A Year among the Persians at that time. He came to
Iran in order to investigate. He didn’t take any particular side,
neither the side of Azal, nor that of Bahá’u’lláh, nor that of
anyone else. Through his investigations he met with many
Bahá’ís, and there was even some praise of them in his book.
Gradually, as he learned more about the Faith, he decided to
travel to the Holy Land to meet Bahá’u’lláh. He was graciously
granted interviews with the Blessed Beauty, and he was the only
Western scholar to ever meet Him personally. It was a great
honour conferred upon Professor Browne. He had four inter-
views with Bahá’u’lláh, by which time he was deeply impressed
by His personality, and the strength, power and authority he
sensed in Him.

While he was there, he also met ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for the first
time, and he wrote about Him too, saying how impressed he was
by this son of the Blessed Beauty! When leaving he took two
manuscripts with him. One was the Tablet of Bahá’u’lláh to
Náṣiri’d-Dín Sháh. This Tablet has an attachment, which is
another Tablet of Bahá’u’lláh concerning the meaning of true
victory. Browne translated both of them. The second manuscript
was A Traveller’s Narrative.

Some time after leaving ‘Akká, he went to Cyprus and met
Ṣubḥ-i-Azal and other Azalís. Gradually those people confused
him, as they had changed the history books that had been written
by early Bábís. They made him believe that what they had forged
was a true history of the life of the Báb and the teachings of the
Báb. Professor Browne seemed to be siding now with Ṣubḥ-i-
Azal. We do not know whether he was truly convinced of the
truth of what they told him, because maybe he had other motives.
We will never know the mind of this man. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá does

\[84\] TRANSLATIONS

write in one of His Tablets that he had political motives as well,
which were added to whatever influence the Azalís had. Their
manoeuvrings turned him away from the Faith. Yet he kept up a
correspondence with the Bahá’ís, including ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Him-
self, who would reply and who met him during His visits to
England. While Shoghi Effendi was in Oxford, he was hoping to
meet Professor Browne, but this never happened.

Q. Why did Bahá’u’lláh use a term such as ‘choice wine’ as
an analogy for His Writings and for His laws?

A. Alcohol and wine are symbols for intoxication. In this
context, however, spiritual intoxication is intended. Shoghi
Effendi has described the early believers and martyrs as ‘God-
intoxicated heroes’. There is another analogy in the writings
about the fragrance of the rose. Now, in some countries they do
not have roses. My wife, Violette, tells a story that she heard
from Rúḥíyyih Khánum about a pilgrim who had come from
Alaska. This is a place where apparently roses do not exist and
this pilgrim did not know what Bahá’u’lláh meant when He
talked about the fragrance of the rose. Shoghi Effendi gave a
little bottle of attar of rose to the pilgrim on the last day of
pilgrimage. He said, ‘Take this and show it to the local Bahá’í
friends in Alaska so they know at least what a rose smells like.’

Q. Could possible translations in the future be made of texts
that Shoghi Effendi has already translated? Is that
recommended?

A. In a prefatory note to his translation of the Kitáb-i-Iqán,
Shoghi Effendi made the following statement: ‘This is one more
attempt to introduce to the West, in language however
inadequate, this book of unsurpassed preeminence among the
writings of the Author of the Bahá’í Revelation. The hope is that
it may assist others in their efforts to approach what must always

be regarded as the unattainable goal – a befitting rendering of
Bahá’u’lláh’s matchless utterance’ (KI vii). I think that this
means that it is impossible to convey the exact beauty and
majesty of Bahá’u’lláh’s original words. However, it is highly
improbable that Shoghi Effendi’s translations would ever be
discarded. Shoghi Effendi was not only a translator. When he
was translating, he was interpreting. There are many things that
are not clear in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh. You might read it in
the original and you wouldn’t know what it really means. Shoghi
Effendi’s translation is an exposition of the real meaning
deposited in the words.

Q. How exactly was the Kitáb-i-Aqdas translated?

A. There is a clear reference in the writings of Shoghi Effendi
that a translation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas would be made in the
future. He himself translated numerous passages from the Kitáb-
i-Aqdas, totalling about one-third of the Book. However, he
included them in Gleanings without specifying their source.
When Bahá’u’lláh quotes Himself, as in the Epistle to the Son of
the Wolf, He occasionally quotes from the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, so the
Guardian also translated those passages. When he wrote The
Promised Day Is Come and needed to quote the Tablets and
Writings of Bahá’u’lláh addressed to different kings, some of
these passages were in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, so he translated them
as well. When all of these translations are put together, as
previously mentioned, about one-third of the Book is translated
by the Guardian himself. In addition to that, he prepared copious
notes for the book that was published in 1973 by the Universal
House of Justice under the title of A Synopsis and Codification of
the Laws and Ordinances of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. These notes were
handed over to the Universal House of Justice after his passing
by Rúḥíyyih Khánum. Few final touches were needed, so the
House of Justice appointed a special committee for this purpose.

\[86\] TRANSLATIONS

Shoghi Effendi had said that when the time came for the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas to be translated it would have to be accompanied
by copious notes, to give the background explaining some of the
references made by Bahá’u’lláh. Thus, the House of Justice
appointed a special committee that consisted of most of its
members at that time who had greater experience to help in this
important project. It took many years of work. The committee
had the assistance not only of individual Bahá’ís at the World
Centre who were helpful to it, as well as the Research Depart-
ment, but also some well-known scholars of the Faith in different
parts of the world who were contacted for their opinions about
various ways of translating specific passages. They had to gather
all of this material and produce this translation, which was then
discussed in full during the plenary sessions of the House of
Justice itself, with full membership. The draft was presented to
the House of Justice itself and in its meetings everything was
reread and rediscussed. Thus, it took many years to produce.

Q. Who put the questions to Bahá’u’lláh that we find
answered in ‘Questions and Answers’ included in the Kitáb-
i-Aqdas?

A. Shoghi Effendi refers to ‘Questions and Answers’ as an annex
to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. They were put together by one of the
scholars of our Faith in the days of Bahá’u’lláh named Zaynu’l-
Muqarrabín. He was transcribing the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh,
and lived in Mosul for a long time, until Bahá’u’lláh asked him
to come to the World Centre, where he eventually passed away.
He himself put numerous questions to Bahá’u’lláh. However,
there were other believers asking questions as well. He gathered
all of the questions and answers and added them to the
compilation. Thus, it was not, as some may be misguided to
believe, that somebody asked Bahá’u’lláh for an interview to put
all these questions to Him at once. It was done gradually, by
Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín gathering the Tablets, understanding what

the question was, putting them together and arranging them in
some logical order. The order was also set by Zaynu’l-
Muqarrabín. Shoghi Effendi said that it should be considered as
an annex to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. The published English text
consists of the Book itself, some passages from other writings of
Bahá’u’lláh revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, which He said
should be considered as part of the Book, followed by ‘Questions
and Answers’, the synopsis and codification, and lastly the
annotations. The notes took a long time too, information having
to be gleaned from other Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, Tablets of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and letters of Shoghi Effendi that explained
specific issues.

Q. Is the Kitáb-i-Aqdas somewhat incomplete because it does
not cover many of the issues of society that would require
legislation?

A. There is an article by a non-Bahá’í scholar about the wisdom
of the way in which the Kitáb-i-Aqdas is written. The wisdom is
that although it is a book of laws, it doesn’t provide reams of
detail. Instead, Bahá’u’lláh provided for the creation of a legis-
lative body, the Universal House of Justice, to fill in the gaps
with secondary laws, which could themselves be changed by the
House of Justice to suit the conditions of the times.

The basic, essential laws that are given in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
will never be changed by the House of Justice because they are
binding. However, there are matters that need supplementary
legislation. For example the law on engagement. This has not
been universally applied yet, just as the law of Ḥuqúq’u’lláh was
only applicable to the East for many years. The law on engage-
ment basically states that the period of engagement should not
exceed 95 days. This law needs supplementary legislation. When
does the period of 95 days begin? Is parental consent necessary?
What about announcement of the engagement? What happens if
a couple cannot, for certain reasons, get married until after 95

\[88\] TRANSLATIONS

days? In the East, such questions have been asked of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, of Shoghi Effendi and of the House of Justice. Certain
answers have been given, but these must all be codified and any
gaps must be filled in before it is made into a universally
applicable law. The same thing applies to the treatment of
thieves and arsonists. There are so many aspects of these laws
that have to be determined, and this can only be done when there
is a Bahá’í state, when the laws of the Aqdas pertaining to theft,
arson, murder, and other such laws, could be implemented. I
think the establishment of a Bahá’í state lies in the distant future.
When the time comes, the Universal House of Justice will have
to look at the condition of the Bahá’í community as a whole,
review all the relevant laws of Bahá’u’lláh, study perhaps the
laws of other religions on the subject, and even the laws in
secular governments. Consider the sentence: ‘Should anyone
intentionally destroy a house by fire, him also shall ye burn’ (KA
¶62). How should the word ‘house’ be defined? Is it a house with
people living in it? Is it an empty house? Does it have furniture?
Is it a warehouse? Is it a small house or an apartment? Are there
extenuating circumstances? Likewise regarding the punishment
for theft. How should the culprit be branded? In the case of a
murder, under what circumstances will life imprisonment be
used? Such issues are briefly dealt with in the notes at the end of
The Kitáb-i-Aqdas.

Q. The translations of the beloved Guardian serve as a basis
for further translations, particularly into other western
languages. To what degree is or should the original Persian
or Arabic text be consulted or taken into consideration for
these second translations?

A. This could be very useful. Shoghi Effendi is not telling us not
to read the original Persian or Arabic, but that the final,
translated text ought to be based on what he himself has
translated, as that is much clearer. In fact, there are certain

languages, like Urdu, with many Persian and Arabic words, and
the translators into such languages do not have to go to the
English, but can translate directly from the Arabic or the Persian
of Bahá’u’lláh.

Q. George Townshend became a Bahá’í in 1921, but only left
the Church years later. What was the Guardian’s response to
this and how can we learn from this example in dealing with
friends who are still strongly attached to the Church?

A. We should not remain or become registered as members of
other religious groups, such as churches. However, there is a
difference between the instructions of Shoghi Effendi regarding
non-membership in religious communities and non-membership
in political parties. When it was about religious communities,
Shoghi Effendi used to give such advice as this: ‘Such questions
as the withdrawal from Church membership . . . should not be
thrust upon the newcomer, but explained to him gradually, so
that he himself may be convinced of the truth underlying these
ordinances of the Cause’ (LG 68). With political parties, it was
different. If you were a member of a political party you simply
had to find your way to leave immediately.

Although we may not be allowed to have membership in
other religious communities, we can still go to any church, be
it Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, or anything else. Rúḥíyyih
Khánum, whenever travelling, used to go to the houses of wor-
ship of other religions. She used to pray there, because they too
are buildings raised to the glory of God. Again, with political
parties, it is different. You should not only avoid membership
of the party, but you should not go to their meetings, to offer
your opinions in their discussions. With religions there is some
flexibility. All such matters are for the National Spiritual
Assembly to decide.

In the case of George Townshend there was no National
Assembly, but he was such an important figure that it was after

\[90\] TRANSLATIONS

consultation with the Guardian that he finally submitted his
resignation from the Church. He was over 70 years old when he
renounced his orders. It cost him his house and his pension,
because both had been provided by the church. Shoghi Effendi
then took care of this dear man who was helping him in the
translation work and he made special financial arrangements for
Mr Townshend.

Q. Why has the Bayán not been fully translated yet?

A. There are two Bayáns: the Persian Bayán and the Arabic
Bayán. These have been already translated into French by
A.L.M. Nicolas. Nicolas was the French consul in Tabríz at the
time of the martyrdom of the Báb. He heard about the Báb and
the Faith and became extremely interested. He did not become a
Bábí, but he was enamoured by the life of the Báb and His
teachings. He translated the entire Persian Bayán, which was
published in Paris in three volumes, with his own footnotes. He
also translated the Arabic Bayán. They were formerly available,
but now they have gone out of print. If you went to some of the
old libraries in Paris, you would probably find some copies of
them. There may be copies available in cyberspace. In any case,
it was published and Shoghi Effendi includes some quotations of
Nicolas’s translations in the footnotes to The Dawn-Breakers.

The laws of the Bayán are not applicable to us today. They
were abrogated by Bahá’u’lláh. That is why there is no urgent or
acute need for an authoritative translation. These two Books are
available in French for anyone who wants to read them in the
West.

IV
The Dawn-Breakers
Background

Amatu’l-Bahá Rúḥíyyih Khánum describes The Dawn-Breakers,
Nabíl’s chronicle, as ‘a classic among epic narratives in the
English tongue’ (PP 215). The author was Muḥammad Zarandí,
who wrote his narrative in Persian. Bahá’u’lláh gave him the title
of ‘Nabíl-i-A‘`am’, which means ‘the most great Nabíl’. Nabíl,
in both Persian and Arabic, means ‘noble’, or ‘excellent’, and
according to the Abjad reckoning, the two words Muḥammad
and Nabíl have equivalent numerical values. Zarand is a town in
one of the outlying districts of Tehran. Nabíl was on a visit in a
nearby locality in Rubat-Karim when he heard for the first time
that a merchant in Shiraz had declared Himself as the Promised
One of Islam. He soon pursued his interest in the new Faith by
contacting those who were among the most prominent believers
of the Báb, and became a Bábí around the year 1847. During that
period he met Bahá’u’lláh twice, once in Kirmánsháh, and once
in Tehran.

After the Báb’s martyrdom, Nabíl specially undertook a visit
to Baghdád, and it was there that he caught a glimpse of the true
station of Bahá’u’lláh. He decided to devote the rest of his life
to serving and promoting the interests of the Bahá’í Faith. He
was also a poet, and endowed with a powerful pen as well as
a retentive memory. He composed many poems in praise
of Bahá’u’lláh. Shoghi Effendi called him the ‘Poet-Laureate’
of the Blessed Beauty (GPB 130). When Shoghi Effendi was

THE DAWN-BREAKERS

drawing up a list of outstanding believers to be named as
‘Apostles of Bahá’u’lláh’, he included Nabíl.

Nabíl travelled a great deal, and many of his journeys were
undertaken at the behest of Bahá’u’lláh. During his extensive
travels he met eminent Bábís and Bahá’ís and made copious
notes of what he had heard from them regarding significant
episodes in the history of the Faith. He later met the faithful
brother of Bahá’u’lláh, Mírzá Músá, who provided him with
important details related to Bábí and Bahá’í history. His close
friends often encouraged him to write his memoirs, but he
refused to do so. He finally agreed that he would proceed with
such a project only if Bahá’u’lláh would give His permission.
The matter was presented to Bahá’u’lláh through His amanu-
ensis, and the suggestion was highly approved by the Blessed
Beauty. In two Tablets addressed to Nabíl, Bahá’u’lláh gave him
clear instructions about the narrative he was to set in writing. He
was advised neither to overstate nor understate, neither to expand
the description of events nor reduce their importance (Athar,
Vol. 4, 184–5; 193–4). According to one of the Persian scholars,
he was also told, possibly orally, that he should be strictly factual
and his narrative should be free from doubtful reports and
assumptions (NZ 54).

Nabíl started writing his history in the year 1887–8 and it
took him a year and a half to complete (NZ 57). In the preface to
The Dawn-Breakers, Nabíl states that what he has recorded is ‘a
description of the episodes I myself have witnessed, as well as
those that have been reported to me by trustworthy and
recognised informants, specifying in every case their names and
standing’ (DB lxiii). According to a statement made by the
Research Department at the World Centre, the following process
for submission of his work to Bahá’u’lláh is described: ‘Nabíl
composed the draft pages of his history without any extensive re-
editing or corrections and submitted them in quires to Mírzá Áqá
Ján. Upon their return to Nabíl, ten months after the submission
of the final quire, with corrections to be made (how these

corrections were indicated is not explained), Nabíl made the
requested corrections to the text of the draft manuscript as well
as adding an appendix containing further material from the
Baghdad period which had been omitted’ (RD 9/11/05).

As stated by the Research Department, corrections had to be
made to his original draft. What was available to the beloved
Guardian was only the original uncorrected draft. In God Passes
By, Shoghi Effendi points out that Muḥammad-‘Alí and his
family ‘carried off, by a ruse, the two satchels containing
[Bahá’u’lláh’s] most precious documents’ (GPB 249) immedi-
ately after the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh. Among the stolen
documents, according to a Tablet revealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, was
the text of the corrected version of Nabíl’s narrative. If this
revised version is ever found and acquired by the World Centre,
then, obviously, experts will have to look at the document to see
if anything has been changed or any word corrupted or inter-
polated, or anything of that nature. In such an event, the House
of Justice may decide what needs to be done. We cannot be sure
that the revised version will ever be recovered.

It must be remembered that, apart from A Traveller’s
Narrative, the friends did not have in their possession a detailed
account of the heroic exploits that characterized the lives of the
early believers of the Báb’s Dispensation. In a cable dated
1 November 1931 to the National Assembly of the United States
and Canada, Shoghi Effendi describes the contents of Nabíl’s
work as a ‘varied rich and authentic material [which] constitutes
most effective weapon to meet challenge of a critical hour’
(RD 9/11/05). In view of the need to make this material available
to the friends, and as the final corrected text was not in his hands,
he set himself the task of editing the original draft in the spirit of
the instructions given by Bahá’u’lláh to Nabíl. This is why, in
the final published work, the Guardian clearly states that the
book was ‘translated from the original Persian and edited by
Shoghi Effendi’.

\[94\] THE DAWN-BREAKERS

In explaining what he had to accomplish, Shoghi Effendi, in
a letter dated 15 November 1932, wrote to the friends in Iran the
following: ‘Before translating the Narrative, the text had to be
edited and corrected, and this task was undertaken by me
personally. Exaggerations and overstatements were eliminated.
The text as it stands will serve as a standard when future
histories of the Faith will be written.’ Furthermore, the original
document was a continuous and uninterrupted narrative, and
Shoghi Effendi, in order to make it more readable for Western
audiences, found it necessary to break the text down into
chapters and subheadings (RD 9/11/05). When sending his
manuscript to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United
States and Canada, his secretary wrote on his behalf: ‘the
translation of Nabíl’s Narrative and the reading of the books
(quoted in the footnotes) and arrangement of the notes have
taken a great deal of time and have entailed a considerable
amount of labour and effort. The work he is sending you is the
result of eight months of continuous labour and he hopes that the
efforts exerted will prove of service to the Cause in this critical
time’. (RD 9/11/05)

Contents of the book

As stated earlier, Mr Townshend collaborated with the beloved
Guardian in supplying the final touches to some of Shoghi
Effendi’s writings. One of the manuscripts that Mr Townshend
was asked to examine carefully was The Dawn-Breakers. In fact,
as happened later in the case of God Passes By, Shoghi Effendi
asked for input from Mr Townshend for the title of his book and
adopted the suggestion his Irish correspondent gave him. How-
ever, Shoghi Effendi was not satisfied with just The Dawn-
Breakers as a title. He felt he needed a subtitle, and added
‘Nabíl’s Narrative of the Early Days of the Bahá’í Revelation’. It
is interesting that although the book deals solely with the nine
years of the Báb’s Ministry, the subtitle still refers to the ‘Bahá’í

Revelation’, indicating that the Báb’s Ministry was not only
under the shadow of Bahá’u’lláh, but was inextricable from the
all-embracing Bahá’í Revelation.

It is not stated anywhere in The Dawn-Breakers that it is
Volume I of II. However, in volumes of The Bahá’í World,
Shoghi Effendi himself makes references to The Dawn-Breakers
as Volume I of Nabíl’s Narrative. It was the original intention of
the Guardian to produce a second volume, which would cover
the history of the Faith during the 39 years of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Ministry. However, he did not have the time to undertake this
project, and as, some 12 years later, he published God Passes By,
which included material from Nabíl’s Narrative, he must have
thought it unnecessary to produce the projected second volume
of The Dawn-Breakers. Shoghi Effendi included almost every-
thing that was in the rest of the manuscript of Nabíl in God
Passes By. Those of us who have had the opportunity of looking
at the original work of Nabíl know that the section which deals
with the Ministry of Bahá’u’lláh is quite brief. This was perhaps
because the life of Bahá’u’lláh was contemporaneous with
Nabíl’s own life and it is very natural for people to think that
things that happen in their own lifetime are not historical and, as
a result, they don’t make a record of them.

The book is dedicated to the Greatest Holy Leaf in the
following words: ‘To the Greatest Holy Leaf, the Last Survivor
of a Glorious and Heroic Age, I Dedicate This Work in Token of
a Great Debt of Gratitude and Love’.

Apart from the Table of Contents and the List of Illustrations,
the book begins with facsimiles of the Báb’s autographed Tablets
addressed to each of the eighteen Letters of the Living. The nine-
teenth is addressed to Himself, and the twentieth to Bahá’u’lláh,
the Promised One of the Bayán, ‘Him Whom God shall make
manifest’. This is followed by an Introduction of 14 pages that
Mr Townshend wrote at the behest of the Guardian and along
guidelines specifically given by Shoghi Effendi. Mr Townshend
requested that his name not appear as author of the Introduction

\[96\] THE DAWN-BREAKERS

because of the sensitive relationship that he had at that time with
his Church. Shoghi Effendi accepted this request, and refers to
him in his Acknowledgements as ‘an English correspondent’
whom he thanks for his help in the preparation of the
Introduction. Shoghi Effendi added passages from the Kitáb-i-
Íqán into the Introduction, together with extracts from Lord
Curzon’s Persia and the Persian Question, Volume 1. He also
included a statement made by E.G. Browne about features of
Shi’ah Islam, which appears in the Professor’s translation of A
Traveller’s Narrative. This is followed by a chart made out in
Shoghi Effendi’s handwriting of the ‘Genealogy of the Báb,
showing connections with Bahá’u’lláh’s descendants’.

Shoghi Effendi divided the material into two parts. Part I he
named ‘Pre-Revelation days’, and part II ‘The Revelation of the
Báb’. The first section deals briefly with the missions of Shaykh
Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í, and of Siyyid Ká`im-i-Rashtí. The second part
consists of the rest of the book, and covers the entire scope of the
life of the Báb, including His travels, Writings, the Declaration
of His Mission, the appointment of the Letters of the Living, His
pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, His successive stays in Shiraz,
in Iṣfahán, in Káshán, and ultimately in the two prison-fortresses
of Máh-Kú and Chihríq, His examination by the ulamas of
Tabriz, and finally the circumstances leading to His martyrdom.
Interspersed in his account of the Báb’s activities, Nabíl relates
Mullá Ḥusayn’s journey to Tehran to meet Bahá’u’lláh, his
subsequent journey to Khurásán, and then to Mázindarán.

Regarding Bahá’u’lláh, we read of His early journey to
Mázindarán, His participation in the conference of Badasht, His
journey to Karbilá, and His imprisonment in the Síyáh-Chál,
followed by His release and banishment to Baghdád. In his
chronicle Nabíl deals at length with the upheavals in Mázin-
darán, in Nayríz and in Zanján, together with an account of the
execution of the Seven Martyrs of Tehran. In the course of his
story he describes in great detail incidents related to the lives of

Quddús and of Ṭáhirih. He ends his book with an account of the
attempt on the Shah’s life and its consequences.

The section at the end of the book, which he titles as
‘Epilogue’, is a 17-page statement in which Shoghi Effendi gives
an overview of the Báb’s Ministry, praises the heroes it pro-
duced, and comments on the apathy of Náṣiri’d-Dín Sháh and his
hopes of uprooting the Faith. The Guardian further makes the
point that in the very act of banishing Bahá’u’lláh from His
native land, the Sháh was but an instrument in the execution of
God’s design. He goes on to say that little did Nabíl himself
imagine that, some 40 years after writing his narrative, the Cause
of Bahá’u’lláh and its fair name would have encircled the globe.

Footnotes and Bibliography

The book in its published form has some 700 pages and 200
illustrations. One third of the publication consists of footnotes,
numbering in total 646. Of these, two-thirds are in English and
one-third are in French. Approximately half are more elaborate
footnotes, a number of which are over 100 lines in length.

He calls his bibliography ‘Works consulted by the trans-
lator’. In this list we find 11 works by Bahá’u’lláh, the Báb and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and 39 works authored by others. The number of
titles of works in English is 21, works in French are 10 in
number, and there are 8 works written in Persian and/or Arabic,
making a grand total of 50 titles.

What others have said about Nabíl’s Narrative, and what Shoghi
Effendi himself stated regarding the book

Rúḥíyyih Khánum writes: ‘Although ostensibly a translation
from the original Persian, Shoghi Effendi may be said to have
recreated it in English, his translation being comparable to Fitz-
gerald’s rendering of Omar Khayyam’s Rubaiyat which gave the

\[98\] THE DAWN-BREAKERS

world a poem in a foreign language that in many ways far
exceeded the merits of the original’ (PP 215).

She further cites a well-known scholar and humanitarian,
who described it as ‘a classic and a standard for all time to come’
(PP 215), and quotes from a letter written by one of Shoghi
Effendi’s old professors: ‘The quality of the English and the
delightful ease of reading the translation are extraordinary . . .
The force of the book is very great, because the translation is so
scientific . . .’ (PP 216).

A well-known orientalist wrote to Shoghi Effendi, saying:
‘The Dawn-Breakers is really one of the most beautiful books I
have seen for many years . . . as for your English style, it really
could not be bettered’ (PP 216).

One of my own associates has written: ‘The eternal drama of
the Báb and His disciples, as he gives it to us through the
winding labyrinthine stories within stories echoed by Nabíl, rises
from the pre-dawn darkness of its beginnings, soars into the
blazing azure of an incandescent zenith only to plummet in pain
and splendour to its heart-breaking end. There never was a more
thrilling nor a more tragic trajectory than this, nor a tale more
eternal and immortal, either. He has not only translated and
interpreted Nabíl, but re-invented the literature of East and West
in the Dawn-Breakers” (BN 1).

As to his own evaluation of the contents of the book, we read
the following in a cable dated 20 June 1932 to the National
Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada:

> FEEL IMPELLED APPEAL ENTIRE BODY AMERICAN
> BELIEVERS HENCEFORTH REGARD NABÍL’S SOUL-
> STIRRING NARRATIVE AS ESSENTIAL ADJUNCT TO

> PILGRIMAGE BAHÁ’U’LLÁH’S NATIVE LAND AND AS
> UNFAILING INSTRUMENT TO ALLAY DISTRESS AND
> RESIST ATTACKS OF CRITICAL DISILLUSIONED
> HUMANITY. (TDH 3)

Furthermore, in letters addressed to individual believers,
written on his behalf by his secretaries, he repeatedly
commended the study of The Dawn-Breakers to the friends.
Extracts from four of these letters are as follows:

> The history of a people is always a source of inspiration to its
> future generations. Nabíl’s Narrative will operate in the
> same manner, and remain forever a stimulus to the Bahá’ís.

(16 December 1932)

Prophet? Arise in His name, put your trust wholly in Him,
and be assured of ultimate victory.’ (DB 93–4)

And yet who knows what achievements, greater than any that
the past and the present have witnessed, may not still be in
store for those into whose hands so precious a heritage has
been entrusted? . . . Who knows but that triumphs, unsur-
passed in splendour, are not in store for the mass of
Bahá’u’lláh’s toiling followers? Surely, we stand too near
the colossal edifice His hand has reared to be able, at the
present stage of the evolution of His Revelation, to claim to
be able even to conceive the full measure of its promised
glory. Its past history, stained by the blood of countless
martyrs, may well inspire us with the thought that, whatever
may yet befall this Cause, however formidable the forces that
may still assail it, however numerous the reverses it will
inevitably suffer, its onward march can never be stayed, and
that it will continue to advance until the very last promise,
enshrined within the words of Bahá’u’lláh, shall have been
completely redeemed. (DB 667–8)

Q. In Nabíl’s Narrative, Mullá Jusayn says that he seemed to
be the voice of the angel Gabriel personified. Does it mean
that he felt Gabriel spoke through him?

A. I will give you my personal opinion. Gabriel was a messen-
ger, an angel of God that according to the Prophet Muḥammad
gave Him the inspiration. He is also mentioned in the Old Testa-
ment as one of the angels. Mullá Ḥusayn, the first to believe in
the Báb, felt that, now that he had received the Message of the
Báb, he was to proclaim it to the world, just like the angel
Gabriel proclaimed the Message to Muḥammad. Mullá Ḥusayn
became a vehicle for the proclamation of the Cause of God.

Q. Shoghi Effendi speaks about The Dawn-Breakers as a
book of inspiration. Why is it that the history of the earliest
believers was needed most, above all other works that could
have been translated at that time?

A. Shoghi Effendi felt that the West needed a history of the early
believers of the Heroic Age. The first part of the Heroic Age,
meaning the nine years of the Ministry of the Báb, is so full of
stories about how the early believers arose and sacrificed
themselves, gave their all and offered everything they had for the
sake of the Báb. This spirit of dedication and of self-sacrifice,
Shoghi Effendi felt, needed to be instilled in the hearts of the
friends in the West. He wanted them to be the descendants of the
Dawn-Breakers. He wanted them to carry the same spirit.

Remember that he was trying to raise the foundations of the
Administrative Order. He chose the United States to be its
Cradle. However, he did not want the community to become too
involved, at the cost of ignoring the spirit of the Faith, with the
gritty details of administration, although these are, of course,
important. Yet, he wanted them to understand the meaning of

\[104\] THE DAWN-BREAKERS

love and dedication to the Cause, the spirit of devotion and of
detachment. In order to have this spirit, he felt that the friends in
the West needed an authentic, reliable history of the early days of
the Faith, so that they knew who their spiritual ancestors were.
Mullá Ḥusayn, Quddús and Ṭáhirih are our spiritual ancestors.
Let us learn from them, follow them, and try to be like them.

Q. Quddús was endowed with special and divine powers.
Káhirih as well occupies a very high rank in the Faith. What
was the nature of their tense dispute at Badasht?

A. This whole episode in Badasht has been treated in Nabíl’s
Narrative and Shoghi Effendi had to translate what Nabíl had
written about the subject. But when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was writing A
Traveller’s Narrative, which has been translated by Browne, He
pointed out that this confrontation was pre-arranged by Bahá-
’u’lláh with Ṭáhirih and with Quddús, in order to gradually
educate the people and help them to understand the principles of
the New Day. We should not consider this incident in Badasht as
something that was a real dispute between Quddús and Ṭáhirih.

Q. Why were some of the footnotes to The Dawn-Breakers
published in French?

A. In the bibliography of works consulted by Shoghi Effendi for
his translation of The Dawn-Breakers there are several books by
French authors. If the books had been in any other language, I
think he would have translated into English the quoted passages
before including them. However, he did not feel that a translation
from French was necessary because it is a language that is
usually accepted and learned by scholars. Especially at that time,
most English-speaking scholars would have studied French too.
For those people who do not speak French, a supplementary
booklet has been published that contains an English translation
of all the French footnotes.

It is interesting to note that in all of his other writings,
including his translations, Shoghi Effendi never used footnotes.
Even God Passes By has no footnotes. The only other footnote
he ever wrote was in The Kitáb-i-Iqán. He wrote a footnote to
say that the word ‘oppression’ used in the text represented a
translation from a Greek word.

Q. Regarding what others have said about Nabíl’s Narrative,
who stated that it reinvented the literature of East and West?

That was Bahíyyíh Nakhjávání. She explains what she meant as
follows: ‘Those of you who have read this wonderful book, One
Thousand and One Nights: do you remember how this work is
constructed? You start with a story, you meet three characters, in
the middle of this story of three characters, one of the characters
says, “and by the way, something happened to me too . . .’ and
he starts telling you his story. You go from story one to story
two. The character tells you his story, and in the middle of his
story you meet a fourth, a fifth and a sixth character, somebody
who is weeping inconsolably. “What is the matter with you?”
“Ah” he says “you don’t know what was happened to me. I have
to tell you my story . . .” So suddenly you are into story number
three. It is like a Russian doll. You go from one story, to another
story inside that story and so on. This is a classic oriental
technique for story telling. It is a story that breeds another story,
which breeds another story. It is a never-ending story. And if you
think about the shape of that, it is very circular. There is one
story, and another story, and another story, and another story.
There is just no end. It does not actually have a linear form. Now
in the west, in our tradition of literature and drama, we have a
very linear concept of stories. All of these things go back to our
religious heritage. This is a fascinating subject for anyone of you
who wants to analyze how it is that religion has influenced
literature, art, drama etc. In the west, which was so much
dominated by the Judeo-Christian framework of religion, you see

\[106\] THE DAWN-BREAKERS

that so much of our arts, in terms of drama and literature, have a
linear form. They have a beginning, they reach a climax, and
they arrive at a resolution. It is exactly the story of the “creation”
of the world with Adam, in terms of Christians’ concept anyway,
the “redemption” of the world when Christ came, and the final
“resurrection” at the end of time. That is that ark shape. It is an
ark which you find reflected over and over again, from the
Greeks all the way up to the present day. It is constructed in
time. We have the sense of the before, the now and the after. We
have a sense of beginning, middle and end. What Shoghi Effendi
has done in the “Dawn Breakers”, is that he has taken this
rambling narrative of Nabíl, where he is telling a story about
someone, what he has eye witnessed, and in the middle of that
story he introduces somebody else who says: “And he told me
that when he was [in] such and such a town he had spoken to so
and so who told him another story which has happened.” Russian
doll within Russian doll. Going from one story to another story.
Who was that person? Was that Muḥammad ‘Alí, or mulláh so
and so? You just do not know who they all are. It does not really
matter. Of course some scholars have clearly set up who all these
people are, but what really matters is that you are seeing a story
evolving from one person to another. Like a seamless and
unending line and it seems too like a mushroom. It spawns. You
will start one story and before you have really finished it, you go
into another story. You have not even finished that one story
before you have to read the new one because it is so interesting.
As you read this new one, it goes to another one. But then you
want to get back to number one. It is extraordinary. He has taken
this heritage and he has done something new with it. He has
turned it into a linear story. Just take a look at the passages, the
major portions of the Dawn Breakers. He begins with the section
of the pre-Bábí period with Shaykh Aḥmad and Siyyid Kázim.
Then he goes to the declaration of the Báb. Then he goes to the
pilgrimage of the Báb to Mecca. He goes on and he goes on, and
then he reaches the climax, the tragic climax of the martyrdom of

the Báb, and then he reaches the end. There is even an epilogue.
He has created a line. He has created a tragic drama that reaches
its high point and comes to its low point. He has done something
quite remarkable, because he has married the eastern style of
narrative with the western style of literary heritage.’

Q. Shoghi Effendi in a cable said that Nabíl’s Narrative is
an indispensable preliminary to future pilgrimage to
Bahá’u’lláh’s native land. What does this mean?

A. Obviously what he means is that in the future there will
certainly be pilgrimages to the holy and historic Bahá’í sites in
Iran. For example, the House of the Báb in Shiraz, where He
declared His mission: It has been demolished but it will certainly
be rebuilt. Bahá’u’lláh made it a place of pilgrimage for the
whole Bahá’í world. There is also the Síyáh-Chál, where
Bahá’u’lláh received the intimation of His revelation, the house
where Bahá’u’lláh resided and where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was born,
the hamlet where the conference of Badasht took place, the
burial site of Badí‘, the burial place of Ṭáhirih, the house of
Vaḥíd, the house of Ḥujjat. All these places are sacred and
historical sites. In one of his statistical booklets Shoghi Effendi
has given us a list of over a whole page of names of sacred and
historic sites in Iran. Unfortunately the government confiscated
all these properties under the new regime. But since it is God’s
will that there will be pilgrimages to Iran, we can be sure that the
Bahá’í community will recover all of these sites. When the day
comes for pilgrims to go to Iran, they will have Nabíl’s Narrative
to familiarize them with what happened in each place.

Q. When the manuscript of Nabíl’s Narrative was sent to the
National Spiritual Assembly of the United States how much
time elapsed before it was first published?

\[108\] THE DAWN-BREAKERS

A. Shoghi Effendi spent a lot of time writing about how it should
be published. He was extremely explicit about what the cover
should be like, how the photographs should be displayed, in what
order the letters to the Letters of the Living should be arranged,
and so on. All these particulars were described in his letters to
the Publishing Trust of the American National Assembly. It took
some time for them to carry out his instructions. He finished
translating it in 1931, but it was not published for about ten
months, until 1932.

Q. Ten thousand people witnessed the martyrdom of the Báb.
Many reports have been written about this event, including
some that are in discordance with the one recounted in
Nabíl’s Narrative. Do the majority of these reports indicate
that Nabíl’s statements were correct? Did Shoghi Effendi
take into consideration other versions of the story when
translating it?

A. I think Shoghi Effendi read every account that was available
to him in Persian, Arabic, English and French, and, I think, if
any of these accounts were not biased and deliberately inimical,
he included them in the footnotes of Nabíl’s Narrative. What
he did not and could not include were the reports of the Iranian
government about the martyrdom, because he didn’t have access
to them. It will be left for future scholars to discover these things.
I think that, as far as the major events of the martyrdom
are concerned, we already know what happened. Bahá’u’lláh
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá have referred innumerable times to the martyr-
dom of the Báb. Shoghi Effendi has said that it was a miracle
that the Báb was not killed by the gunfire of the Armenian
regiment.

It is very interesting that the Báb seemed to have
foreknowledge of what was going to happen. He told the police
official ‘Not until I have said to him all those things that I wish
to say can any earthly power silence Me’ (GPB 52). And before

the regiment fired the first volley of bullets, the Báb said nothing
to the crowd. The second time, however, when He knew that
they were to be His last words, He said to them, ‘The day will
come when you will have recognized Me; that day I shall have
ceased to be with you’ (GPB 53).

Q. The Dawn-Breakers was originally written by Nabíl, but
was recreated by Shoghi Effendi. Does the book have the
same validity as works written by Shoghi Effendi, such as
God Passes By?

A. With regard to specific times and dates and places, it may
happen that in the future documents will be found that show that
some of these details in Nabíl’s narrative are not completely
accurate. For example, a document may be found that a certain
event, which Nabíl writes happened on a Wednesday, actually
happened on a Thursday. That would be just a technical detail.

However, I do not think that the overall flow of events is
going to change. Bahá’u’lláh warned Nabíl to adhere to the facts
that he had heard, without embellishment or reduction. That is
why Shoghi Effendi calls the book a narrative, not a history.
Nabíl narrated the stories he had collected from the believers
who lived through those years. I don’t see how these first-hand
accounts can be challenged. In the future, if authentic documents
are found, perhaps they could be added to the narrative as
footnotes. Such issues will certainly be decided by the Universal
House of Justice.

Q. What about the rest of Nabíl’s Narrative? Will it ever be
finished? Is it being worked on at this time? How can
changes be made without having access to Bahá’u’lláh’s
correction? How did Shoghi Effendi know which corrections
needed to be made if the original corrections by Bahá’u’lláh
were not available?

\[110\] THE DAWN-BREAKERS

A. When Nabíl began to make his own notes about the history of
the Faith, some of his friends, particularly the brother of
Bahá’u’lláh, Mírzá Músá, and Mírzá Aqá Ján, who was the
amanuensis of Bahá’u’lláh, asked him why he did not start
writing a full account of the history of the Faith. As I stated
earlier, he replied that he would not write anything unless
Bahá’u’lláh wished him to. They reported this to Bahá’u’lláh.
Bahá’u’lláh said that he should write, but gave him instructions
in two Tablets. The two Tablets have been published. He told
him not to overstate or understate the facts. He told him not to
elaborate on the stories he had heard, nor to whittle down the
parts of the story that he didn’t like. Nabíl produced a manuscript
and presented it to Bahá’u’lláh. Nabíl had not satisfactorily
followed His instructions, so He returned the manuscript to him
and instructed him to make some corrections. What we do not
know at this time is how the instructions about the corrections
were conveyed to Nabíl. However, Bahá’u’lláh had made it clear
that His instructions had not been followed. Nabíl had to rewrite
his narrative and present it to Bahá’u’lláh again. Bahá’u’lláh kept
this version among His papers. We assume that He accepted this
revised text.

I have already explained that after the ascension of
Bahá’u’lláh, Covenant-breakers stole papers from the room of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. They stole two cases of papers that Bahá’u’lláh
had given to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. They literally did this at a time when
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was not in His room and was washing the body of
Bahá’u’lláh. Those documents are probably still in the
possession of the descendants of the Covenant-breakers. We do
not know if we will ever recover them. Even if we did, they may
not be reliable. Muḥammad-‘Alí is known to have corrupted
texts. His brother, Badí‘u’lláh, wrote a confession that mentioned
that he had seen his brother corrupt texts. In my own personal
opinion, even if they were found, I don’t think we could trust
them. However, the final decision, as I stated, rests with the
House of Justice.

At the time when Shoghi Effendi produced Nabíl’s
Narrative, the Covenant-breakers spread a rumour among their
Arab friends that Shoghi Effendi had fabricated the entire thing
and that only they possessed Nabíl’s narrative. Apart from that
claim, as stated earlier, we also have a Tablet from ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, in which He states that the revised edition of Nabíl’s
narrative was among the documents stolen by the Covenant-
breakers.

When Shoghi Effendi set out to translate Nabíl, he had the
instructions of Bahá’u’lláh before him, and we can be sure that
he tried his best to remove anything that he felt was overstated or
based on assumption. He gave us everything that he thought was
authentic, and in conformity with the spirit of Bahá’u’lláh’s
wishes.

Q. The role of a traditional storyteller sees him or her taking
the story and reworking it in his or her own interpretation
and flavour. How do you see the storyteller’s tool of artistic
licence in the light of Bahá’u’lláh’s clear instruction to Nabíl,
to neither overstate nor understate, neither expand the
description of events nor reduce their importance? What
advice regarding artistic licence or individual artistic
interpretation would you give to a contemporary storyteller
who wished to retell stories from Bahá’í history?

A. If this Bahá’í storyteller wants to recount the events of any
part of Bahá’í history, he should not add fiction to fact. Adhering
to the facts is very important. To add a feeling or an emotion, in
the form of a question maybe, in order to bring to the attention of
the reader a certain point, is entirely acceptable. But if the writer
wants to add additional details, or to change them, then he should
not write a history. He should write a novel. If the author makes
it clear that he is writing a fictional story, then he can state
whatever he wants and can add in little details to fill any gaps he
may find.

\[112\] V
God Passes By
Background

God Passes By is, in the words of its author, ‘a survey of the
outstanding events of the century that has seen this Spirit [the
Bahá’í Faith] burst forth upon the world . . .’ (GPB xii). It was
the one book Shoghi Effendi wrote in his lifetime that was
neither directly addressed to the Bahá’ís, expounding on subjects
related to the Faith, nor a translation of an existing text in Arabic
or Persian. With characteristic precision the Guardian refrained
from referring to his ‘survey’ as a ‘detailed history’ of the first
hundred years of the Bahá’í Era. He was content to call it ‘a
review of the salient features of [the Faith’s] birth and rise, as
well as of the initial stages in the establishment of its
administrative institutions’ (GPB xiii).

In his Introduction to the work, George Townshend describes
it as ‘a history of our times written on an unfamiliar theme – a
history filled with love and happiness and vision and strength,
telling of triumphs gained and wider triumphs yet to come . . .’.
‘The theme on its human side’, he writes, ‘is that of Love and
Struggle and Death. It tells of men and women like ourselves,
adventuring all they had and all they were for sheer love’s sake,
of desolated homes, of breaking hearts, of bereavement and exile
and suffering and indomitable purpose’ (GPB iii).

The book was published in 1944 to commemorate the first
centenary of the Bahá’í Faith. To give an idea of the monumental
nature of the task Shoghi Effendi undertook in preparing his

‘survey’, one has only to consider certain basic statistics. The
work consists of 412 pages in all, including quotations from
sacred scripture, scholarly treatises and other sources. Of these,
41 pages are quotations covering an entire page or more.
Scattered throughout the rest of the book we find about 47 pages
worth of further citations, bringing the total of pages where
Shoghi Effendi is quoting other sources to over 85. Rúḥíyyih
Khánum, in The Priceless Pearl, gives us a glimpse of Shoghi
Effendi’s meticulous research and overall vision for the book:

> The method of Shoghi Effendi in writing God Passes By was
> to sit down for a year and read every book of the Bahá’í
> Writings in Persian and English, and every book written
> about the Faith by Bahá’ís, whether in manuscript form or
> published, and everything written by non-Bahá’ís that
> contained significant references to it. I think in all, this must
> have covered the equivalent of at least two hundred books.
> As he read he made notes and compiled and marshalled his
> facts. Anyone who has ever tackled a work of an historical
> nature knows how much research is involved, how often one
> has to decide, in the light of relevant material, between this
> date given in one place and that date given in another, how
> backbreaking the whole work is . . . When all the ingredients
> of his book had been assembled Shoghi Effendi commenced
> weaving them into the fabric of his picture of the significance
> of the first century of the Bahá’í Dispensation. It was not his
> purpose, he said, to write a detailed history of those hundred
> years, but rather to review the salient features of the birth and
> rise of the Faith, the establishment of its administrative
> institutions, and the series of crises which had propelled it
> forward in a mysterious manner, through the release of the
> Divine power within it, from victory to victory. He revealed
> to us the panorama of events which, he wrote, ‘the revolution
> of a hundred years . . . has unrolled before our eyes’ and
> lifted the curtain on the opening acts of what he asserted was

\[114\] GOD PASSES BY

> one ‘indivisible, stupendous and sublime drama, whose
> mystery no intellect can fathom, whose climax no eye can
> even dimly perceive, whose conclusion no mind can
> adequately foreshadow’. (PP 223)

It was the Guardian’s intention to present the Bahá’í world
with a valuable gift at the anniversary of the Declaration of the
Báb: the first comprehensive look at the events marking the
emergence of the Faith from its humble beginnings in Persia to
its status as a truly world-embracing religion. His purpose, he
insisted, was not ‘to ignore . . . the swift interweaving of seeming
reverses with evident victories, out of which the hand of an
inscrutable Providence has chosen to form the pattern of the
Faith from its earliest days . . .’ (GPB xiii), but to reveal the
process of ‘crisis and victory’ that characterized the fortunes of
the Bahá’í Faith throughout its history and which would continue
to shape its progress in the future. ‘[T]he history of the first
hundred years of [the Faith’s] evolution’, he explains in his
Foreword to the book, ‘resolves itself into a series of internal
and external crises . . . devastating in their immediate effects, but
each mysteriously releasing a corresponding measure of divine
power, lending thereby a fresh impulse to its unfoldment . . .’
(GPB xiii).

The conditions under which he laboured to produce God
Passes By reflect this very pattern of triumph and reversal. The
book was written while he was under great strain from factors
both within and without the Bahá’í world. This was a time when
the Nazi regime was carrying out the mass extermination of
Jews, Gypsies and other populations across Europe; when its
armies were engaged on both the Western and Russian fronts, as
well as in North Africa; when Japan and America had both
joined in the hostilities, turning the Second World War into a
planet-wide conflict. It was also a period of great personal loss
for Shoghi Effendi due to the activities of Covenant-breakers
within his own family.

Rúḥíyyih Khánum paints a picture of these circumstances in
The Priceless Pearl: ‘Shoghi Effendi, already crushed and
overburdened from the weight of twenty years of Guardianship,
when the tides of World War II threatened to sweep over the
Holy Land and engulf him and the World Centre of the Faith in
one catastrophic flow, during a period when his home was
convulsed by the repercussions of Covenant-breaking now
affecting his own family, set himself the task of appraising for all
time the significance of the events of the first century of the
Bahá’í Era’ (PP 224).

She further writes in her diary: ‘As Shoghi Effendi sat
working on God Passes By, two army fighter planes in practice
flight touched wings, lost control and crashed, one coming down
over the roof of our house so low I thought it would sheer
through the ceiling of Shoghi Effendi’s room. It landed and burst
into flames not 100 yards away at the foot of the street’ (PP 162).
And again, concerning the activities of Covenant-breakers in
Haifa at that time, she noted, ‘They [the Master’s family] have
gone a long way to crushing every ounce of spirit out of the
Guardian’ (PP 161). ‘On rare occasions’, she recalls, ‘it was my
misfortune . . . to see him weep as if his heart would break – so
great was his agony, so overwhelming the pressures that bore
down upon him!’ (PP 224).

The work of writing involved in such a major project was of
course itself burdensome to Shoghi Effendi. ‘How many hun-
dreds of hours’, Rúḥíyyih Khánum tells us, ‘Shoghi Effendi
spent on reading his sources and compiling his notes, how many
days and months in painstakingly writing out in long hand – and
often rewriting – the majestic procession of his chapters, how
many more wearisome days he sat at his small portable type-
writer, hammering away with a few fingers, sometimes ten hours
on end, as he typed the final copy of his work! And how many
more hours we spent late into the night, when the daily typing
was over, seated side by side at his big table in his bedroom,
each with three copies of the typescript before us, proof-reading,

making corrections, putting in by hand the thousands of accents
on transliterated words which Shoghi Effendi would read aloud,
until his eyes were bloodshot and blurred, his back and arms stiff
with exhaustion, as we worked on to finish the entire chapter or
part of a chapter he had typed that day. It had to be done. There
was no possibility of working at a slower pace. He was racing
against time to present the Bahá’ís of the West with this
inimitable gift on the occasion of the one hundredth anniversary
of the inception of their Faith. In spite of the fact that he mailed
off to America the corrected manuscript in instalments, con-
ditions in the United States delayed publication and the book was
not off the press until the middle of November 1944’ (PP 223–4).

Due to the pressures in his life at the time of writing God
Passes By, the Guardian was unable to fine-tune the text to the
extent he would have desired. He made use once more of the
services of George Townshend, sending the manuscript in instal-
ments to his friend with the request that he make editorial correc-
tions and suggestions. David Hofman describes the conditions of
their collaboration: ‘It [God Passes By] was undertaken during
difficult times – the darkest days of the Second World War –
when communications were far from regular, normal help was
unobtainable and both men were under great strain’ (GT 70).

In addition to making editorial suggestions, Mr Townshend
was asked to write an Introduction to the book. Hofman
observes: ‘Having read every line of the Guardian’s monumental
work, having gloried in it, wept over it, lived with it from
February 1943 to February 1944, offered his editorial “sugges-
tions, criticisms or corrections” as he deemed necessary, he
wrote with a full heart and flowing pen’ (GT 69).

Shoghi Effendi also requested Mr Townshend’s input on the
choice of a title. It took Mr Townshend some time to come up
with an appropriate idea. After letters and two cables from the
Guardian, he finally cabled back three words: quite simply, ‘God
Passes By’. He received an immediate answer: ‘DELIGHTED
TITLE. EAGERLY AWAITING LETTER’ (GT 69).

Townshend makes the following comments on the range and
impact of Shoghi Effendi’s centenary history: ‘whatever it holds
of darkest tragedy it leaves mankind at its close not facing a grim
inhospitable future but marching out from the shadows on the
high road of an inevitable destiny towards the opened gates of
the Promised City of Eternal Peace’ (GPB iii). In an undated
letter to the Guardian he notes that ‘Hitherto our information on
the history of the Faith has been piece-meal, and uncertain on
many points. Now an even light covers it all’ (GT 72).

We are left with an enduring legacy, a vision of the first
hundred years of Bahá’í history that is both far-reaching in its
scope and concise in its execution. Rúḥíyyih Khánum further
describes it as ‘the most brilliant and wondrous tale of a century
that has ever been told’, and ‘a “Mother” of future histories’ (PP
222). ‘A book like God Passes By’, she observes, ‘is a veritable
essence of essences; from this single hundred-year history, fifty
books could easily be written and none of them would be
superficial or lacking in material, so rich is the source provided
by the Guardian, so condensed his treatment of it’ (PP 196).

Summary

Shoghi Effendi divided the book into four periods, focusing the
first three respectively on the Ministries of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The fourth section deals with the start of the
Formative Age. He then added a short epilogue, entitled
‘Retrospect and Prospect’, in which he gives an overview of the
main highlights of the first century of Bahá’í history. Each
section is summarized separately below.

1\. The Ministry of the Báb

In his treatment of the Báb’s Ministry, Shoghi Effendi describes
the impact of that short and dramatic period on the lives of those
professing the Bábí Faith and on the public consciousness and

\[118\] GOD PASSES BY

political climate of Persia. He outlines the chief events between
the Declaration of the Báb in 1844 and His martyrdom in 1850,
and the resulting aftermath that led to Bahá’u’lláh’s incarceration
in the Síyáh-Chál. He summarizes the chief episodes related to
the lives of outstanding Bábí disciples, extols their heroism and
character, and places their achievements in the context of the
relentless opposition and bloody persecution visited on them by
the civil and ecclesiastical authorities of the nation.

He begins with an account of the Declaration of the Báb and
the enrolment of the Letters of the Living, the Báb’s arrest after
His pilgrimage to Mecca, and His subsequent imprisonment. He
describes the conference of Badasht and the intervention of
Bahá’u’lláh in that famous gathering. He then addresses the all-
important subject of the Báb’s Writings during His captivity in
Azerbaijan, including the composition of the Bayán, the reve-
lation of the laws and ordinances of the Bábí Dispensation, and
the references to ‘Him Whom God shall make manifest’. He
explains the opposition of the clergy to the new ideas promoted
by the Báb, their denunciation of His teachings and the resulting
martyrdoms in Mázindarán, Nayríz and Tehran.

He goes on to depict the events surrounding the execution of
the Báb, the parallels between His life and that of Jesus Christ,
and the tributes paid to His memory by writers in the West. He
portrays the circumstances attending the attack on Náṣiri’d-Dín
Sháh and the wave of imprisonment, torture and massacre that
was visited on the Bábí community as a result of that misguided
act. Lastly, he notes the role played by Bahá’u’lláh during the
Báb’s Ministry, and gives an account of the arrests and martyr-
doms of the remaining prominent disciples of the Báb, as well as
the eventual fate of the principal enemies of the Bábí Faith.

In order to capture some of Shoghi Effendi’s insights on this
vital period, some extracts follow:

> In sheer dramatic power, in the rapidity with which events of
momentous importance succeeded each other, in the

> holocaust which baptized its birth, in the miraculous
> circumstances attending the martyrdom of the One Who had
> ushered it in, in the potentialities with which it had been from
> the outset so thoroughly impregnated, in the forces to which
> it eventually gave birth, this nine-year period [the Ministry of
> the Báb] may well rank as unique in the whole range of
> man’s religious experience. (GPB 3)

> The heroes whose deeds shine upon the record of this fierce
> spiritual contest, involving at once people, clergy, monarch
> and government, were the Báb’s chosen disciples, the Letters
> of the Living, and their companions, the trail-breakers of the
> New Day, who to so much intrigue, ignorance, depravity,
> cruelty, superstition and cowardice opposed a spirit exalted,
> unquenchable and awe-inspiring, a knowledge surprisingly
> profound, an eloquence sweeping in its force, a piety un-
> excelled in fervor, a courage leonine in its fierceness, a self-
> abnegation saintly in its purity, a resolve granite-like in its
> firmness, a vision stupendous in its range, a veneration for
> the Prophet [Muḥammad] and His Imáms disconcerting to
> their adversaries, a power of persuasion alarming to their
> antagonists, a standard of faith and a code of conduct that
> challenged and revolutionized the lives of their countrymen.

(GPB 4–5)

2\. The Ministry of Bahá’u’lláh

In his overview of Bahá’u’lláh’s Ministry, Shoghi Effendi
focuses on the principal events marking the years of exile and
imprisonment that characterized the last half of Bahá’u’lláh’s
life, years that saw the open and far-reaching Declaration of His
Mission and the establishment of His Faith outside Persia. He
explores the influence and impact of Bahá’u’lláh’s behaviour and
Writings on the minds and hearts of those around Him, from the
body of His followers to the government officials and eminent

\[120\] GOD PASSES BY

intellectuals of His time. He addresses the nature and import of
the different Tablets comprising the vast body of Revealed Text
authored by the Founder of the Bahá’í Faith and draws particular
attention to the prophecies and religious traditions of the past that
found their final consummation in the appearance of Bahá’u’lláh.

He begins by depicting the events following the martyrdom
of the Báb, and the confusion and despair that assailed the
remaining adherents of the Bábí Faith. He recounts the first
intimations of Bahá’u’lláh’s Mission in the Síyáh-Chál, His exile
to Baghdád, and the transformative influence of His presence on
the people of that city, both within and without the Bábí
community. He explains the machinations of Bahá’u’lláh’s
enemies within the ranks of the clergy and the resulting edict
from the Sultan ordering His continued banishment, and gives an
account of the declaration of Bahá’u’lláh’s Mission on the eve of
His departure from Baghdád.

He further describes Bahá’u’lláh’s exile to Constantinople
and Adrianople, enumerating the Tablets to the Kings and Rulers
of the world which Bahá’u’lláh revealed during His stay in those
cities. He relates the attempts on the life of Bahá’u’lláh at the
instigation of His half-brother, Mírzá Yaḥyá, the consternation
and division this open antagonism produced in the Bahá’í
community, and the use that the enemies of the new-born Faith
made of this internal division to convince the Sultan to issue a
further edict banishing Bahá’u’lláh to ‘Akká. He gives a
description of Bahá’u’lláh’s incarceration in ‘the Most Great
Prison’, the gradual relaxation of the restrictions imposed upon
Him in succeeding years, and His final sojourn in the Mansion of
Bahjí. He summarizes the astounding volume of His Writings
during those last years, including the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the
Tablets which ‘supplemented’ the Most Holy Book, and explains
the range and import of these Writings. He describes the events
leading to His ascension, and finishes by chronicling instances of
‘divine judgement’ visited on the enemies of the Faith during
Bahá’u’lláh’s Ministry.

The following are extracts from this section:

> [T]he Revelation identified with Bahá’u’lláh abrogates
> unconditionally all the Dispensations gone before it, upholds
> uncompromisingly the eternal verities they enshrine,
> recognizes firmly and absolutely the Divine origin of their
> Authors, preserves inviolate the sanctity of their authentic
> Scriptures, disclaims any intention of lowering the status of
> their Founders or of abating the spiritual ideals they
> inculcate, clarifies and correlates their functions, reaffirms
> their common, their unchangeable and fundamental purpose,
> reconciles their seemingly divergent claims and doctrines,
> readily and gratefully recognizes their respective
> contributions to the gradual unfoldment of one Divine
> Revelation, unhesitatingly acknowledges itself to be but one
> link in the chain of continually progressive Revelations,
> supplements their teachings with such laws and ordinances
> as conform to the imperative needs, and are dictated by the
> growing receptivity, of a fast evolving and constantly
> changing society, and proclaims its readiness and ability to
> fuse and incorporate the contending sects and factions into
> which they have fallen into a universal Fellowship,
> functioning within the framework, and in accordance with
> the precepts, of a divinely conceived, a world-unifying, a
> world-redeeming Order. (GPB 100)

> The writings of Bahá’u’lláh during this [the ‘Akká] period,
> as we survey the vast field which they embrace, seem to
> fall into three distinct categories. The first comprises
> those writings which constitute the sequel to the proc-
> lamation of His Mission in Adrianople. The second
> includes the laws and ordinances of His Dispensation, which,
> for the most part, have been recorded in the Kitáb-i-
> Aqdas, His Most Holy Book. To the third must be assigned
> those Tablets which partly enunciate and partly reaffirm

\[122\] GOD PASSES BY

> the fundamental tenets and principles underlying that
> Dispensation. (GPB 205–6)

> With the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh draws to a close a period
> which, in many ways, is unparalleled in the world’s religious
> history. The first century of the Bahá’í Era had by now run
> half its course. An epoch, unsurpassed in its sublimity, its
> fecundity and duration by any previous Dispensation, and
> characterized, except for a short interval of three years, by
> half a century of continuous and progressive Revelation, had
> terminated. The Message proclaimed by the Báb had yielded
> its golden fruit . . . God’s newborn Faith, the cynosure of all
> past Dispensations, had been fully and unreservedly proc-
> laimed. The prophecies announcing its advent had been
> remarkably fulfilled. Its fundamental laws and cardinal
> principles, the warp and woof of the fabric of its future
> World Order, had been clearly enunciated . . . The Covenant
> designed to safeguard the unity and integrity of its world-
> embracing system had been irrevocably bequeathed to
> posterity. The promise of the unification of the whole human
> race, of the inauguration of the Most Great Peace, of the
> unfoldment of a world civilization, had been incontestably
> given . . . (GPB 223–4)

3\. The Ministry of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

In his outline of the Ministry of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi
deals with His function as Centre of Covenant and Head of the
Faith, the distinguishing features of His career, and the
revitalizing effect of His unerring guidance on the fortunes of the
Bahá’í community. He describes ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s character and
accomplishments, the arrival in the Holy Land of the first
pilgrims from the West, and the establishment of rudimentary
institutions of the Faith in various countries, under His tutelage.
He singles out two of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s seminal works, His Will

and Testament and the Tablets of the Divine Plan, for specific
mention. Finally, he relates numerous episodes recorded from the
life of the Master that exemplify the astounding influence He had
on those who met Him.

He first explains the significance of Bahá’u’lláh’s Book of
the Covenant, lists its salient features, and recapitulates the role
played by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá during the Ministry of His Father. He
gives an account of the defection of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s half-brother,
Muḥammad-‘Alí, and describes the shameful conduct of the
Covenant-breakers within His own family, machinations which
culminated in the summoning of two Commissions of Inquiry
into ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s activities by the Ottoman government. He
alludes to the impending judgement on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá based on
the report of the second Commission, His release from incarcer-
ation after the Young Turk revolution, and the final transference
of the remains of the Báb to a mausoleum specifically erected,
under His direction, on the slopes of Mount Carmel.

He further describes the early development of the Faith in the
West, depicting ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s travels to Europe and America.
He underlines the importance of these journeys, the impact that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence and Person had on His audiences, and
the ensuing advancement of the Faith in those countries. He
notes the continued persecution of the Bahá’í community in
Persia, describes the construction of the first Bahá’í House of
Worship in ‘Ishqábád and points out the effect of the First World
War on the conduct of administrative affairs in the Holy Land.
He mentions the recognition of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s services by the
British government after the war. Lastly, he recounts the passing
of the Master, reiterates the significance of His Ministry, and
relates the fate of His few surviving opponents.

Some extracts are given below:

> To direct and canalize these forces let loose by this Heaven-
> sent process, and to insure their harmonious and continuous
> operation after His ascension, an instrument divinely

\[124\] GOD PASSES BY

ordained, invested with indisputable authority, organically
linked with the Author of the Revelation Himself, was clearly
indispensable. That instrument Bahá’u’lláh had expressly
provided through the institution of the Covenant, an
institution which He had firmly established prior to His
ascension. (GPB 237–8)

During these travels [to Europe and America] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
displayed a vitality, a courage, a single-mindedness, a
consecration to the task He had set Himself to achieve that
excited the wonder and admiration of those who had the
privilege of observing at close hand His daily acts . . .
[C]areless alike of His comfort and His health; expending
every ounce of His energy day after day from dawn till late at
night; consistently refusing any gifts or contributions
towards the expenses of His travels; unfailing in His
solicitude for the sick, the sorrowful and the down-trodden;
uncompromising in His championship of the underprivileged
races and classes; bountiful as the rain in His generosity to
the poor; contemptuous of the attacks launched against Him
by vigilant and fanatical exponents of orthodoxy and
sectarianism; . . . unequivocal in His glorification of
Bahá’u’lláh at all times and within the sanctuaries of divers
sects and denominations; adamant in His refusal, on several
occasions, to curry the favor of people of title and wealth
both in England and in the United States; and last but not
least incomparable in the spontaneity, the genuineness and
warmth of His sympathy and loving-kindness shown to friend
and stranger alike, believer and unbeliever, rich and poor,
high and low, whom He met . . . He, the incarnation of every
Bahá’í virtue and the embodiment of every Bahá’í ideal,
continued . . . to trumpet to a world sunk in materialism and
already in the shadow of war, the healing, the God-given
truths enshrined in His Father’s Revelation. (GPB 282–3)

4\. The Inception of the Formative Age

In his survey of the period immediately following the Ascension
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi addresses the essential
elements of the Bahá’í Administrative Order, details its
uniqueness in the annals of religious history, and examines its
lawful basis in the Will and Testament of Abdu’l-Bahá. He
characterizes the Formative Age as a period of gradual develop-
ment, when the Faith and its institutions, through a process of
organic growth and alternate stages of crisis and victory, will lay
the foundations for the appearance of Bahá’u’lláh’s Golden Age.
He enumerates the achievements of individuals and communities
in the fields of teaching and administration, applauds the forma-
tion of Assemblies on a sound constitutional and legal basis, and
underlines the importance of the official recognition of the Faith.

He begins with an explanation of the nature of the
Administrative Order based on the provisions of the Will and
Testament of Abdu’l-Bahá. He then describes the attacks by
Covenant-breakers on that newly established Order after the
passing of Abdu’l-Bahá, and their inability to halt the steady
march of development of the institutions of the Faith. He
mentions the inauguration of the Mother Temple of the West,
listing endowments, publishing houses, summer schools and
other agencies associated with the nascent Bahá’í institutions. He
recalls the persecutions suffered by Bahá’í communities in
Russia, Germany and Persia, emphasizes the significance of an
edict issued by ecclesiastical authorities in Egypt formally
pronouncing the Faith an independent religion, and praises the
official recognition of Bahá’í institutions in the United States.

He further catalogues the accomplishments of individuals
and national communities in the field of teaching, making
particular reference to the services of Martha Root, and notes the
particular contribution of the American Bahá’ís to the spread of
the Faith across the world, executing the mandate of Abdu’l-
Bahá in His Tablets of the Divine Plan.

\[126\] GOD PASSES BY

Some extracts from this section are as follows:

The Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh had been instituted solely
through the direct operation of His Will and purpose. The
Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, on the other hand, may
be regarded as the offspring resulting from that mystic
intercourse between Him Who had generated the forces of a
God-given Faith and the One Who had been made its sole
Interpreter and was recognized as its perfect Exemplar. The
creative energies unleashed by the Originator of the Law of
God in this age gave birth, through their impact upon the
mind of Him Who had been chosen as its unerring
Expounder, to that Instrument, the vast implications of which
the present generation, even after the lapse of twenty-three
years, is still incapable of fully apprehending. (GPB 325)

The Administrative Order which this historic Document has
established, it should be noted, is, by virtue of its origin and
character, unique in the annals of the world’s religious
systems. No Prophet before Bahá’u’lláh, it can be confidently
asserted, not even MuJammad Whose Book clearly lays
down the laws and ordinances of the Islamic Dispensation,
has established, authoritatively and in writing, anything
comparable to the Administrative Order which the author-
ized Interpreter of Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings has instituted, an
Order which, by virtue of the administrative principles which
its Author has formulated, the institutions He has established,
and the right of interpretation with which He has invested its
Guardian, must and will, in a manner unparalleled in any
previous religion, safeguard from schism the Faith from
which it has sprung. Nor is the principle governing its
operation similar to that which underlies any system . . .
which the minds of men have devised for the government of
human institutions. Neither in theory nor in practice can the
Administrative Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh be said to

> conform to any type of democratic government, to any system
> of autocracy, to any purely aristocratic order, or to any of
> the various theocracies . . . which mankind has witnessed in
> the past. It incorporates within its structure certain elements
> which are to be found in each of the three recognized forms
> of secular government, is devoid of the defects which each of
> them inherently possesses, and blends the salutary truths
> which each undoubtedly contains without vitiating in any
> way the integrity of the Divine verities on which it is
> essentially founded. (GPB 326)

5\. Retrospect and Prospect

In his epilogue Shoghi Effendi reviews the major episodes
marking the history of the Faith in the hundred years since its
inception, and looks forward to aspects of its future develop-
ment. He characterizes the advancement of the Bahá’í Faith as ‘A
process, God-impelled, . . . mysterious in its workings, awful in
the retribution meted out to every one seeking to resist its opera-
tion, infinitely rich in its promise for the regeneration and re-
demption of human kind . . .’ (GPB 402). He notes that ‘Despite
the blows levelled’ at it, whether by ‘the wielders of temporal
and spiritual authority from without, or by black-hearted foes
from within’, the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh has gone from strength to
strength during the course of its first hundred years, and always
emerged whole and victorious from any crisis that assailed it.
‘Indeed its history’, he writes, ‘. . . resolve[s] itself into a series
of pulsations, of alternating crises and triumphs, leading it ever
nearer to its divinely appointed destiny’ (GPB 409).

Shoghi Effendi’s overarching understanding of the Faith’s
history and his far-reaching vision of its future may be glimpsed
in the few quotes provided below:

> The tribulations attending the progressive unfoldment of the
> Faith of Bahá’u’lláh have indeed been such as to exceed in

\[128\] GOD PASSES BY

gravity those from which the religions of the past have
suffered. Unlike those religions, however, these tribulations
have failed utterly to impair its unity, or to create, even temp-
orarily, a breach in the ranks of its adherents. It has not only
survived these ordeals, but has emerged, purified and inviol-
ate, endowed with greater capacity to face and surmount any
crisis which its resistless march may engender in the future.

Mighty indeed have been the tasks accomplished and the
victories achieved by this sorely-tried yet undefeatable Faith
within the space of a century! Its unfinished tasks, its future
victories, as it stands on the threshold of the second Bahá’í
century, are greater still. (GPB 410)

Whatever may befall this infant Faith of God in future
decades or in succeeding centuries, whatever the sorrows,
dangers and tribulations which the next stage in its world-
wide development may engender, from whatever quarter the
assaults to be launched by its present or future adversaries
may be unleashed against it, however great the reverses and
setbacks it may suffer, we, who have been privileged to
apprehend, to the degree our finite minds can fathom, the
significance of these marvelous phenomena associated with
its rise and establishment, can harbor no doubt that what it
has already achieved in the first hundred years of its life
provides sufficient guarantee that it will continue to forge
ahead, capturing loftier heights, tearing down every obstacle,
opening up new horizons and winning still mightier victories
until its glorious mission, stretching into the dim ranges of
time that lie ahead, is totally fulfilled. (GPB 412)

Q. ‘Neither in theory nor in practice can the Administrative
Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh be said to conform to any
type of democratic government, to any system of autocracy, to
any purely aristocratic order, or to any of the various
theocracies, whether Jewish, Christian or Islamic which
mankind has witnessed in the past’ (GPB 326). What does he
mean by ‘neither in theory nor in practice’?

A. Autocracy means rule by one; aristocracy means rule by a
group, a selected group; and democracy means rule by all the
people. Aristotle divided systems of government into these three
forms.

Shoghi Effendi says that the Administrative Order combines
certain wholesome, healthy and useful elements from each of
these three types of government. There is an autocratic element
in the Faith, which is the power of the Manifestation of God and
of the Interpreters of the Word of God. The democratic aspect is
that the reins of authority are held by elected bodies. In a modern
democracy, the government sometimes has to resort to a refer-
endum to allow it to make certain decisions. The electorate has
power over the government. The aristocratic element is that the
elected bodies are not responsible to the electorate. They are
responsible to their own consciences. They should feel they are
responsible to God because they believe in life after death.
Ultimately, they are the deputies of God, not of the people.

In his ‘Dispensation’ Shoghi Effendi has stated that the
Bahá’í Administrative Order has an ‘inclination to democratic
methods in the administration of its affairs’ (WOB 154). The
democratic element is very clearly that the people are free to
elect whomever they want. The elections for the Local and
National Assemblies are held annually. Those who are electing
can elect the same people each year or different people. They
have that choice; the voice of the majority prevails.

\[130\] GOD PASSES BY

The Administrative Order is not a pure democracy, nor a
pure aristocracy, nor a pure autocracy. It is a combination of
these three things together. Finally, there are additional Bahá’í
spiritual principles: the methods of election, voting and
consultation. These things make the Administrative Order an
entirely new creation, unlike anything else in the past. These are
not only theoretical principles, but the principles are practised.
And the Universal House of Justice is the ultimate safeguard, our
guarantee that it is ‘the last refuge of a tottering civilization’
(WOB 89).

Q. What were the commissions of inquiry into ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s activity and what did they find out?

A. There were two commissions of investigation or of inquiry.
The first one came in about 1901, and the second about 1907.
The first part of the Will was written at about the time when the
first commission was in ‘Akká, and the second part of the Will
was written at about the time the second commission was there.
These reports were all, unfortunately, against Abdu’l-Bahá. The
members of the commission came from Constantinople, at the
bidding of Sultan ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd. The members of the com-
missions were antagonistic towards ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. They were
influenced by the Covenant-breakers, who invited them to their
homes and gave them gifts, possibly bribed them, and tried to
instil in them hatred for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself
stayed away from the commission members. He did the exact
opposite to the Covenant-breakers. The Covenant-breakers found
some local people in ‘Akká, and induced them to go before the
commission and to give testimony against Abdu’l-Bahá. These
negative reports went to Constantinople. The result of the first
commission was that the incarceration of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was
renewed. Once again He had to be confined within the prison
walls of the city of ‘Akká.

The second commission was even worse. There was the
possibility that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would be either sentenced to death
or exiled to Libya. The Ottomans used to send prisoners to
Fezzan, near Tripoli in North Africa. The second report was even
more negative than the first, and it would have been very
dangerous if that report had reached Constantinople, but it never
did. The Young Turks arose against Sultan ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd, and
he was deposed from the throne.

Q. ‘Nor were the British authorities slow to express their
appreciation of the rôle which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had played in
allaying the burden of suffering that had oppressed the
inhabitants of the Holy Land during the dark days of that
distressing conflict’ (GPB 306). What did ‘Abdu’l-Bahá do
for the British?

A. There was not enough food for the British army during the
war against the Turkish forces in the Holy Land. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
had food in His storehouses, which He gave to the poor in ‘Akká.
He also gave them some of this wheat to feed the British army
after they gained control of the Holy Land. For these services the
British government considered that He should be granted a
knighthood.

Q. Shoghi Effendi has described the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh
during the ‘Akká period as follows: ‘The writings of
Bahá’u’lláh during this period, as we survey the vast field
which they embrace, seem to fall into three distinct categories.
The first comprises those writings which constitute the sequel
to the proclamation of His Mission in Adrianople’ (GPB 205).
What are the Tablets which constitute this sequel?

A. The delivery of the Message of Bahá’u’lláh came in three
stages. The first stage began in the Siyáh-Chál of Tehran, when
He received the first intimations of His message. Stage two was

\[132\] GOD PASSES BY

the Declaration, and it occurred 10 years later, in the Najíbíyyih
garden outside Baghdád. It was there that Bahá’u’lláh lifted the
veils surrounding His station. His companions on that occasion
were the Bábís of Baghdád, and He clearly announced to them
that He was the Promised One of the Bayán. The third stage was
the Proclamation of His Mission. This Proclamation was initiated
in Constantinople. He had moved there from Baghdád at the
bidding of Sultan ‘Abdu’l-Azíz. After four months, the Sultan
issued an edict banishing Bahá’u’lláh and His companions to
Adrianople. Bahá’u’lláh responded to this by sending a
condemnatory Tablet. The Proclamation process evolved in
Adrianople. It emerged into the open with His Súriy-i-Mulúk
(Tablet to the Kings). It continued with His Tablets to individual
kings, rulers and religious leaders. The Proclamation to the
individual rulers started in 1867 in Adrianople and continued
until 1873, in ‘Akká. Bahá’u’lláh was banished to ‘Akká in
1868\. The Proclamation could be said to have ended there with
the revelation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.

Outline of works published in English
A. Bahá’í Administration

Bahá’í Administration is the first compilation of Shoghi
Effendi’s English letters. It was first published in 1928, and after
two subsequent revisions, when additions were made to the text,
it was published in its current form in 1941. The first letter in this
volume is dated January 1922, and the last is dated July 1932,
thus a period of a little over 10 years is covered by the book.

In the 1922 letter to the friends in the United States men-
tioned above, Shoghi Effendi expresses his sorrow and the grief
of the Holy household at the passing of the Beloved Master,
describing it as a ‘shock . . . too terrible and sudden for us all to
recover from in so short a time’ (BA 15). After quoting several
passages from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá about the future
glory of the Cause, and drawing the attention of the friends to the
importance of the teaching work and unity in the community, he
specifically underlines the fact that, in accordance with ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s anticipation, ‘tests intellectual rather than physical’ were
ahead of them, and that these tests were designed to purify them
and to make them shine brighter than ever before (BA 16).

After the book was published in its last edition Shoghi
Effendi, in a letter written to a National Assembly on his behalf,
made the following comment about its importance:

> The Guardian would strongly urge each and every member
> of the National Spiritual Assembly to carefully peruse, and to

> quietly ponder upon the outer meaning and upon the inner
> spirit as well, of all his communications on the subject of the
> origin, nature and present-day functioning of the
> administrative order of the Faith. A compilation of these
> letters has been lately published in the States under the title
> ‘Bahá’í Administration’, and a complete knowledge of that
> book seems to be quite essential to the right handling of the
> administrative problems facing your National Spiritual
> Assembly at present . . . (CC Vol. I, 220–1)

In this book the duties of a National Assembly, the
responsibilities of a National Convention, and of Local Spiritual
Assemblies are outlined. The requirements of Bahá’í elections,
and the nature of Bahá’í consultation are explained. Shoghi
Effendi stresses over and over again the importance of engaging
in the teaching work, which should be the dominating passion of
every devoted believer, and underlines the implications of faith
in the Manifestation of God. He gives full details of the
persecution of the Bahá’ís in Iran and in Russia, and explains the
legal problems surrounding the ownership of Bahá’u’lláh’s
House in Baghdád. Other issues, such as the importance of
acquiring properties adjoining the Shrine of the Báb on Mount
Carmel, the need to adhere to a common system of trans-
literation, the importance of newsletters, of loyalty to govern-
ment, of contributions to the Fund, of summer schools, of Queen
Marie’s public announcements, and of the Mashriqu’l-Adhkár
and its dependencies are also covered.

The last letter in this compilation is his tribute to the Greatest
Holy Leaf, and expresses the extent to which her passing was a
loss. He wrote:

> Which of the blessings am I to recount, which in her unfailing
> solicitude she showered upon me, in the most critical and
> agitated hours of my life? To me, standing in so dire a need
> of the vitalizing grace of God, she was the living symbol of

\[136\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

> many an attribute I had learned to admire in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
> She was to me a continual reminder of His inspiring
> personality, of His calm resignation, of His munificence and
> magnanimity. To me she was an incarnation of His winsome
> graciousness, of His all-encompassing tenderness and love.

(BA 194)

Below are some further quotations from this valuable
compilation:

> Humanity, through suffering and turmoil, is swiftly moving
> on towards its destiny; if we be loiterers, if we fail to play our
> part surely others will be called upon to take up our task as
ministers to the crying needs of this afflicted world.

Not by the force of numbers, not by the mere exposition of
> a set of new and noble principles, not by an organized
> campaign of teaching – no matter how worldwide and
> elaborate in its character – not even by the staunchness of
> our faith or the exaltation of our enthusiasm, can we
> ultimately hope to vindicate in the eyes of a critical and
> sceptical age the supreme claim of the Abhá Revelation. One
> thing and only one thing will unfailingly and alone secure the
> undoubted triumph of this sacred Cause, namely, the extent
> to which our own inner life and private character mirror
> forth in their manifold aspects the splendor of those eternal
> principles proclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh. (BA 66)

> But let us all remember, in this connection, that prior to
> every conceivable measure destined to raise the efficiency of
> our administrative activities, more vital than any scheme
> which the most resourceful amongst us can devise, far above
> the most elaborate structure which the concerted efforts of
> organized Assemblies can hope to raise, is the realization
> down in the innermost heart of every true believer of the
regenerating power, the supreme necessity, the unfailing

> efficacy of the Message he bears. I assure you, dear friends,
> that nothing short of such an immovable conviction could
> have in days past enabled our beloved Cause to weather the
> blackest storms in its history. Naught else can today vitalize
> the manifold activities in which unnumbered disciples of the
> Faith are engaged; naught else can provide that driving
> force and sustaining power that are both so essential to the
> success of vast and enduring achievements. It is this spirit
> that above all else we should sedulously guard, and strive
> with all our might to fortify and exemplify in all our
> undertakings. (BA 111–12)

> Not by merely imitating the excesses and laxity of the extra-
> vagant age they live in; not by the idle neglect of the sacred
> responsibilities it is their privilege to shoulder; not by the
> silent compromise of the principles dearly cherished by
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; not by their fear of unpopularity or their
> dread of censure can they hope to rouse society from its
> spiritual lethargy, and serve as a model to a civilization the
> foundations of which the corrosion of prejudice has well-nigh
> undermined. By the sublimity of their principles, the warmth
> of their love, the spotless purity of their character, and the
> depth of their devoutness and piety, let them demonstrate to
> their fellow-countrymen the ennobling reality of a power that
> shall weld a disrupted world. (BA 131–2)

B. and C. ‘The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh’

During the year that saw the start of the Great Depression, two
very important letters, dated 27 February 1929 and 21 March
1930, treating similar themes, streamed from the pen of the
beloved Guardian. Shoghi Effendi felt it was time to explain to
the Bahá’ís of the West the sources and broad outlines of the
World Order of Bahá’u’lláh. He drew the attention of the friends
to the close relationship existing between the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and

\[138\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. These two documents,
authored respectively by the Founder of the Faith and the Centre
of its Covenant, in Shoghi Effendi’s estimation, constitute ‘the
chief depository wherein are enshrined those priceless elements
of that Divine Civilization, the establishment of which is the
primary mission of the Bahá’í Faith’ (WOB 3–4). He stated that
these two seminal works have the same purpose and adopt iden-
tical methods in the provisions related to successorship. They are
complementary, mutually confirm one another, and are ‘insepar-
able parts of one complete unit’ (WOB 4). Shoghi Effendi
clearly states that the Will and Testament ‘confirms, supple-
ments, and correlates the provisions of the Aqdas’ (WOB 19).

It is in the implications of the Bahá’í Covenant, its distinction
in having been incorporated into a written document, the explicit
character of its stipulations, and the binding effect of its terms,
that the Bahá’í Faith differs radically from all past religions. This
aspect of the Bahá’í Revelation ensures that there is always a
central authority ‘to apply the principles, promulgate the laws,
protect the institutions, adapt loyally and intelligently the Faith
to the requirements of progressive society, and consummate the
incorruptible inheritance which the Founders of the Faith have
bequeathed to the world’ (WOB 20). Thus the system revealed
by Bahá’u’lláh, Shoghi Effendi asserts, provides both ‘immut-
ability’ and ‘elasticity’. ‘The first preserves the identity of His
Faith, and guards the integrity of His law. The second enables it,
even as a living organism, to expand and adapt itself to the needs
and requirements of an ever-changing society’ (WOB 23).

Human society has embarked on a process of an ever-
advancing civilization. Every Revelation brings about a new
phase in the transformation ‘in the ways, thoughts and manners’
of humanity. In support of this theme, Shoghi Effendi quotes the
following words from the Kitáb-i-Íqán:

> Is not the object of every Revelation to effect a
transformation in the whole character of mankind, a

> transformation that shall manifest itself, both outwardly and
> inwardly, that shall affect both its inner life and external
> conditions? For if the character of mankind be not changed,
> the futility of God’s universal Manifestation would be
> apparent. (WOB 25)

A few passages are quoted below to give us further glimpses
of these two important letters of the Guardian:

> Bahá’u’lláh, we should readily recognize, has not only
> imbued mankind with a new and regenerating Spirit. He has
> not merely enunciated certain universal principles, or
> propounded a particular philosophy, however potent, sound
> and universal these may be. In addition to these He, as well
> as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá after Him, has, unlike the Dispensations of
> the past, clearly and specifically laid down a set of Laws,
> established definite institutions, and provided for the
> essentials of a Divine Economy. These are destined to be a
> pattern for future society, a supreme instrument for the
> establishment of the Most Great Peace, and the one agency
> for the unification of the world, and the proclamation of the
> reign of righteousness and justice upon the earth. (WOB 19)

> Leaders of religion, exponents of political theories, gover-
> nors of human institutions, who at present are witnessing
> with perplexity and dismay the bankruptcy of their ideas, and
> the disintegration of their handiwork, would do well to turn
> their gaze to the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, and to medi-
> tate upon the World Order which, lying enshrined in His
> teachings, is slowly and imperceptibly rising amid the welter
> and chaos of present-day civilization. They need have no
> doubt or anxiety regarding the nature, the origin or validity
> of the institutions which the adherents of the Faith are
> building up throughout the world. For these lie embedded in
> the teachings themselves, unadulterated and unobscured by

\[140\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

> unwarrantable inferences, or unauthorized interpretations of
His Word.

How pressing and sacred the responsibility that now
> weighs upon those who are already acquainted with these
> teachings! How glorious the task of those who are called
> upon to vindicate their truth, and demonstrate their
> practicability to an unbelieving world! Nothing short of an
> immovable conviction in their divine origin, and their
> uniqueness in the annals of religion; nothing short of an
> unwavering purpose to execute and apply them to the
> administrative machinery of the Cause, can be sufficient to
> establish their reality, and insure their success. How vast is
> the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh! How great the magnitude of
> His blessings showered upon humanity in this day! And yet,
> how poor, how inadequate our conception of their
> significance and glory! This generation stands too close to so
> colossal a Revelation to appreciate, in their full measure, the
> infinite possibilities of His Faith, the unprecedented
> character of His Cause, and the mysterious dispensations of
> His Providence. (WOB 24)

D. ‘The Goal of a New World Order’

‘The Goal of a New World Order’ was written in late 1931, on
the occasion of the tenth anniversary of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s passing,
and addressed to the Bahá’í community as a whole. In this letter
Shoghi Effendi explains that as the moral decline of humanity
had been so acute, no amount of diplomacy or statesmanship,
economic rejuvenation or mutual tolerance could form a
sustainable basis for its renewal. ‘Not even’, he states, ‘would the
very act of devising the machinery required for the political and
economic unification of the world . . . provide in itself the
antidote against the poison that is steadily undermining the vigor
of organized peoples and nations’ (WOB 34). The Guardian
reminds the Bahá’ís that it is only through worldwide and

unqualified acceptance of Bahá’u’lláh’s message that humanity
can hope to reverse this crippling, though inevitable, process of
‘internal disintegration’ (WOB 34).

Shoghi Effendi emphasizes that the ailing economies, social
degradation and political fallout of the post-war era were not, in
and of themselves, the fundamental cause of humanity’s
depraved state, but were simply a consequence of ‘the failure of
those in whose hands the immediate destinies of peoples and
nations have been committed, to adjust their system of economic
and political institutions to the imperative needs of a rapidly
evolving age’ (WOB 36). Economic and social upheaval,
escalating political tension and an overriding sense of misery on
a global scale were, rather, attributable to the inability, or indeed
the unwillingness, of world leaders to ‘reshape the machinery of
their respective governments according to those standards that
are implicit in Bahá’u’lláh’s supreme declaration of the Oneness
of Mankind’ (WOB 36).

The Guardian includes in his letter a series of extracts
from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that dem-
onstrate how imperative it is for humanity to curtail absolute
state sovereignty and replace it with an international executive,
legislature and judiciary. He explains how this form of ‘world
Super-State’, which would transmute ‘the fury of a capricious
and militant nationalism . . . into an abiding consciousness of
world citizenship’ (WOB 40–1), should be a counterpart to the
seemingly contradictory principle of ‘unity in diversity’. In
conveying this concept, Shoghi Effendi stresses that the imple-
mentation of world governance should not in any way homo-
genise existing domestic traditions and institutions or suppress
national history and ethnic heritage. The principle of unity in
diversity, he states, ‘repudiates excessive centralization on one
hand and disclaims all attempts at uniformity on the other’
(WOB 42).

Shoghi Effendi also clarifies that the Oneness of Mankind, as
the central tenet of the Bahá’í Faith, should not be confused with

\[142\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

a superficial or sanctimonious appeal for a ‘reawakening of the
spirit of brotherhood and good-will among men’ (WOB 43). On
the contrary, it necessitates a complete, and organic reworking of
the very parameters around which contemporary human society
is based. ‘It calls for . . . a world organically unified in all the
essential aspects of its life, its political machinery, its spiritual
aspiration, its trade and finance, its script and language, and yet
infinite in the diversity of the national characteristics of its
federated units’ (WOB 43).

As in some of his other letters, the Guardian draws a parallel
between the violence and conflict which eventually ‘welded’ the
fiercely independent, and hitherto irreconcilable, American states
into one nation, and the process of ‘mental’ and ‘physical agony’
(WOB 45) which humanity as a whole would have to overcome
on its path towards unification.

> That the forces of a world catastrophe can alone precipitate
> such a new phase of human thought is, alas, becoming
> increasingly apparent. That nothing short of the fire of a
> severe ordeal, unparalleled in its intensity, can fuse and weld
> the discordant entities that constitute the elements of present-
> day civilization, into the integral components of the world
> commonwealth of the future, is a truth which future events
> will increasingly demonstrate. (WOB 46)

Shoghi Effendi concludes by reaffirming the responsibility of
every individual believer to aid, ‘with undimmed vision and
unabated zeal’, the further propagation of the message of
Bahá’u’lláh (WOB 48). He also reminds the Bahá’ís that the
turmoil of the time, threatening as it may seem, is a requisite
stage in mankind’s maturation, and will in due course culminate
in lasting peace and worldwide harmony.

In a letter written on his behalf in January 1932, Shoghi
Effendi made the following comments about ‘The Goal of a New
World Order’:

> Concerning the general letter he has sent lately to the
> Western friends, to which you refer . . . Shoghi Effendi thinks
> that the friends should spread the message it conveys to the
> public. It should undoubtedly be done in a very judicious way
> lest the people think that we have entered the arena of
> politics with rather drastic programmes of reform. But we
> should at the same time show the lead that the teachings take
> towards the realization of the international ideal. The
> primary importance of the Cause among the existing
> religions of the world is that, whereas the others have no
> coherent programme upon which they are united, the
> Movement is rich with the very spirit and teachings the world
> needs for solving its present international problems. It is a
> wonderful chance for the Cause to absorb the interest of the
> intelligent elements in the public. (SWSE 5)

Extracts from this illuminating document follow below:

> Ten years of unceasing turmoil, so laden with anguish, so
> fraught with incalculable consequences to the future of
> civilization, have brought the world to the verge of a
> calamity too awful to contemplate. Sad indeed is the con-
> trast between the manifestations of confident enthusiasm in
> which the Plenipotentiaries at Versailles so freely indulged
> and the cry of unconcealed distress which victors and
> vanquished alike are now raising in the hour of bitter
> delusion. (WOB 30)

> Never indeed have there been such widespread and basic
> upheavals, whether in the social, economic or political
> spheres of human activity as those now going on in different
> parts of the world. Never have there been so many and varied
> sources of danger as those that now threaten the structure of
> society. (WOB 32)

\[144\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

Are we, the privileged custodians of a priceless Faith, called
upon to witness a cataclysmical change, politically as
fundamental and spiritually as beneficent as that which
precipitated the fall of the Roman Empire in the West? Might
it not happen – every vigilant adherent of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh might well pause to reflect – that out of this
world eruption there may stream forces of such spiritual
energy as shall recall, nay eclipse, the splendor of those
signs and wonders that accompanied the establishment of the
Faith of Jesus Christ? Might there not emerge out of the
agony of a shaken world a religious revival of such scope
and power as to even transcend the potency of those world-
directing forces with which the Religions of the Past have, at
fixed intervals and according to an inscrutable Wisdom,
revived the fortunes of declining ages and peoples? Might
not the bankruptcy of this present, this highly-vaunted
materialistic civilization, in itself clear away the choking
weeds that now hinder the unfoldment and future
efflorescence of God’s struggling Faith? (WOB 33)

The call of Bahá’u’lláh is primarily directed against all
forms of provincialism, all insularities and prejudices. If
long-cherished ideals and time-honored institutions, if
certain social assumptions and religious formulae have
ceased to promote the welfare of the generality of mankind,
if they no longer minister to the needs of a continually
evolving humanity, let them be swept away and relegated
to the limbo of obsolescent and forgotten doctrines. Why
should these, in a world subject to the immutable law
of change and decay, be exempt from the deterioration
that must needs overtake every human institution? For
legal standards, political and economic theories are
solely designed to safeguard the interests of humanity
as a whole, and not humanity to be crucified for the

> preservation of the integrity of any particular law or
> doctrine. (WOB 42)

> Let there be no mistake. The principle of the Oneness of
> Mankind – the pivot round which all the teachings of
> Bahá’u’lláh revolve – is no mere outburst of ignorant
> emtionalism or an expression of vague and pious hope. Its
> appeal is not to be merely identified with a reawakening of
> the spirit of brotherhood and good-will among men, nor does
> it aim solely at the fostering of harmonious cooperation
> among individual peoples and nations. Its implications are
> deeper, its claims greater than any which the Prophets of old
> were allowed to advance. Its message is applicable not only
> to the individual, but concerns itself primarily with the nature
> of those essential relationships that must bind all the states
> and nations as members of one human family. It does not
> constitute merely the enunciation of an ideal, but stands
> inseparably associated with an institution adequate to
> embody its truth, demonstrate its validity, and perpetuate its
> influence. It implies an organic change in the structure of
> present-day society, a change such as the world has not yet
> experienced. It constitutes a challenge, at once bold and
> universal, to outworn shibboleths of national creeds – creeds
> that have had their day and which must, in the ordinary
> course of events as shaped and controlled by Providence,
> give way to a new gospel, fundamentally different from, and
> infinitely superior to, what the world has already conceived.
> It calls for no less than the reconstruction and the demili-
> tarization of the whole civilized world – a world organically
> unified in all the essential aspects of its life, its political
> machinery, its spiritual aspiration, its trade and finance, its
> script and language, and yet infinite in the diversity of the
> national characteristics of its federated units. (WOB 42–3)

E. ‘The Golden Age of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh’

In this 17-page message addressed to the friends in the United
States and Canada, Shoghi Effendi begins by lauding the
propelling force of the Faith of God which has, 10 years after the
passing of the beloved Master, ‘in the face of tremendous
obstacles, maintained its unity, resisted the malignant onslaught
of its ill-wishers, silenced its calumniators [and] broadened the
basis of its far-flung administration . . .’ (WOB 51). The letter
goes on to pay warm tribute to the community of Bahá’ís in
North America, to their efforts in aiding the progress of the Faith
and in defence of its interests in the oppressed lands of the East.

In order to contrast Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation to other, man-
created, movements, Shoghi Effendi poses this question for
reflection: ‘Where else, if not in the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh,
can the unbiased student of comparative religion cite instances
of a claim as stupendous as that which the Author of that Faith
advanced, foes as relentless as those which He faced, a devotion
more sublime than that which He kindled, a life as eventful and
as enthralling as that which He led?’ (WOB 55). The Guardian
draws a parallel between the early beginnings of past religions
and the thrilling episodes which accompanied the birth and rise
of the Bahá’í Faith, and gives a highly illuminating statement
establishing the principle of the progressiveness and relativity of
religious truth, and the unity and complementarity of all divinely
revealed religions. He further, categorically, states the pre-
eminent character of the Báb’s Faith, and the fact that He was
not only a Forerunner to Bahá’u’lláh, but an independent
Manifestation of God in His own right.

The letter also deals with the importance and implications of
the principle of non-interference in political affairs, pointing out
that this in no way means that Bahá’ís are indifferent to the
interests of their own country or the concept of sane patriotism. It
is clear from this statement that the current circumstances in the
world demand that such an attitude of non-involvement in

political and party pursuits should be uppermost in the minds of
the friends. This of course does not entail avoidance of purely
administrative positions in government, or association with
movements that are humanitarian in their pursuits and in har-
mony with the Bahá’í principles. The concluding paragraphs of
the letter address the need to carry out to a successful conclusion
the great enterprise of completing the Wilmette temple.

Some passages from this document are set forth below:

> That the Cause associated with the name of Bahá’u’lláh
> feeds itself upon those hidden springs of celestial strength
> which no force of human personality, whatever its glamour,
> can replace; that its reliance is solely upon that mystic
> Source with which no worldly advantage, be it wealth, fame,
> or learning can compare; that it propagates itself by ways
> mysterious and utterly at variance with the standards
> accepted by the generality of mankind, will, if not already
> apparent, become increasingly manifest as it forges ahead
> towards fresh conquests in its struggle for the spiritual
regeneration of mankind.

Indeed, how could it, unsupported as it has ever been by
> the counsels and the resources of the wise, the rich, and the
> learned in the land of its birth, have succeeded in breaking
> asunder the shackles that weighed upon it at the hour of its
> birth, in emerging unscathed from the storms that agitated its
> infancy, had not its animating breath been quickened by that
> spirit which is born of God, and on which all success,
> wherever and however it be sought, must ultimately depend?

(WOB 51–2)

> Not by the material resources which the members of this
> infant community can now summon to their aid; not by the
> numerical strength of its present-day supporters; nor by any
> direct tangible benefits its votaries can as yet confer upon the
> multitude of the needy and the disconsolate among their

\[148\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

countrymen, should its potentialities be tested or its worth
determined. Nowhere but in the purity of its precepts, the
sublimity of its standards, the integrity of its laws, the
reasonableness of its claims, the comprehensiveness of its
scope, the universality of its program, the flexibility of its
institutions, the lives of its founders, the heroism of its
martyrs, and the transforming power of its influence, should
the unprejudiced observer seek to obtain the true criterion
that can enable him to fathom its mysteries or to estimate its
virtue. (WOB 54)

Let them refrain from associating themselves, whether by
word or by deed, with the political pursuits of their
respective nations, with the policies of their governments and
the schemes and programs of parties and factions. In such
controversies they should assign no blame, take no side,
further no design, and identify themselves with no system
prejudicial to the best interests of that worldwide Fellowship
which it is their aim to guard and foster. Let them beware
lest they allow themselves to become the tools of
unscrupulous politicians, or to be entrapped by the
treacherous devices of the plotters and the perfidious among
their countrymen. Let them so shape their lives and regulate
their conduct that no charge of secrecy, of fraud, of bribery
or of intimidation may, however ill-founded, be brought
against them. Let them rise above all particularism and
partisanship, above the vain disputes, the petty calculations,
the transient passions that agitate the face, and engage the
attention, of a changing world. It is their duty to strive to
distinguish, as clearly as they possibly can, and if needed
with the aid of their elected representatives, such posts and
functions as are either diplomatic or political from those that
are purely administrative in character, and which under no
circumstances are affected by the changes and chances that
political activities and party government, in every land, must

> necessarily involve. Let them affirm their unyielding
> determination to stand, firmly and unreservedly, for the way
> of Bahá’u’lláh, to avoid the entanglements and bickerings
> inseparable from the pursuits of the politician, and to become
> worthy agencies of that Divine Polity which incarnates God’s
> immutable Purpose for all men. (WOB 64–5)

F. This Decisive Hour

This compilation of 135 pages, comprising 107 letters and cables
of Shoghi Effendi, covers the period from 1932 to 1946. It is a
revised edition of the earlier, 1947, volume entitled Messages to
America. The cables are distinct from those published in the past
by the American community, in that they are reproduced without
the interpolations inserted in cables, as published in the earlier
volume.

In this volume, Shoghi Effendi announces the publication of
Nabíl’s Narrative, underlines its significance, and reminds the
American friends that they are the spiritual descendants of the
Dawn-Breakers. He refers to the American Bahá’í community as
the ‘champion-builders of the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh’, and
stresses the importance of contributing to the National Fund and
particularly to the Temple Fund. He also announces his marriage,
in March of 1937, to Amatu’l-Bahá Rúḥíyyih Khánum. In this
message he refers to the institution of the Guardianship as ‘the
head-cornerstone’ of the Administrative Order, and characterizes
it as being directly associated, through his marriage, to the
community of North America.

In April of 1937 he launches the American Bahá’í com-
munity on their First Seven Year Plan, and encourages them to
intensify their teaching work and their pioneering activities, on
the home front as well as in virgin territories of Central and
South America. Twice during this period, first in 1939 and then
in 1942, he requests the National Assembly of the United States
and Canada to deputize first nine, then five members of the

\[150\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

community to settle in goal areas of the Seven Year Plan.
Concurrent with the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939,
during the second year of the Plan, he announces the transfer of
the blessed remains of the Purest Branch and the mother of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Mount Carmel, thereby reinforcing the spiritual
potencies of that ‘consecrated Spot’. As the Seven Year Plan
draws to a close, he announces the preparations to be made for
the Centenary of the Declaration of the Báb, the need to multiply
the number of pioneers and to complete the exterior orna-
mentation of the Temple in Wilmette, and the importance of the
participation of Latin American believers in the Centenary
celebrations to be held under the shadow of the Mother Temple
of the West.

In 1944 he announces the completion of his chief literary
work, God Passes By. Also at this time, and with a heavy-laden
heart, he makes known to the friends the faithlessness of
members of his own family. Towards the end of the period
covered by the compilation, in a message dated April 1946 to the
National Convention, he inaugurates the start of the Second
Seven Year Plan and explains how its goals are related to the
spiritual conquest of the planet.

A few quotes from these messages are included below:

> The handling of this delicate and vital problem regarding
> non-participation by Bahá’ís of East and West in political
> affairs, calls for the utmost circumspection, tact, patience
> and vigilance, on the part of those whose function and
> privilege it is to guard, promote and administer the activities
> of a worldwide, ever-advancing Cause. The misgivings and

Upon the measure of such a participation will no doubt
depend the welfare and progress of those distant com-
munities which are now battling for their emancipation. To
such a priceless privilege the inheritors of the shining grace
of Bahá’u’lláh cannot surely be indifferent. The American
believers must gird up the loins of endeavor and step into the
arena of service with such heroism as shall astound the
entire Bahá’í world. Let them be assured that my prayers will
continue to be offered on their behalf. (TDH 18–19)

[I]t must be clearly understood, nor can it be sufficiently
emphasized, that the conjunction of the resting-place of the
Greatest Holy Leaf with those of her brother and mother
incalculably reinforces the spiritual potencies of that con-
secrated Spot which, under the wings of the Báb’s
overshadowing Sepulcher, and in the vicinity of the future
Mashriqu’l-Adhkár which will be reared on its flank, is
destined to evolve into the focal center of those world-
shaking, world-embracing, world-directing administrative
institutions, ordained by Bahá’u’lláh and anticipated by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and which are to function in consonance with
the principles that govern the twin institutions of the
Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice. Then, and
then only, will this momentous prophecy which illuminates
the concluding passages of the Tablet of Carmel be fulfilled:
‘Erelong will God sail His Ark upon thee (Carmel), and will
manifest the people of Bahá who have been mentioned in the
Book of Names.’

To attempt to visualize, even in its barest outline, the
glory that must envelop these institutions, to essay even a
tentative and partial description of their character or the
manner of their operation, or to trace however inadequately
the course of events leading to their rise and eventual
establishment is far beyond my own capacity and power.

G. ‘America and the Most Great Peace’

In this 23-page letter, dated 21 April 1933, addressed to the
believers in the United States and Canada on the occasion of the
passage of 40 years after the first public reference to Bahá’u’lláh
and His Faith in the United States, Shoghi Effendi outlines the
distinctions achieved by the American Bahá’í community in
service to the Cause. He refers to them as a community which

has attained ‘an undisputed leadership among its sister
communities of East and West’ (WOB 72).

In this letter he recounts the attacks on the Faith, the ‘vilest
imputations’ hurled at its face, and the false assumption made by
its enemies that it was ‘an expiring creed’ (WOB 72). He recalls
that the Báb had been labelled by these opponents as a ‘perverted
apostate’ (WOB 72) and Bahá’u’lláh was denounced as ‘an
unscrupulous plotter and usurper’, while ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was
branded a ‘stirrer of mischief and a notorious exponent of
expediency and fraud’ (WOB 73). The principle of the oneness
of the human race has been referred to by these same detractors
as ‘a shallow attempt at uniformity’, the supernatural forces
animating the Faith condemned as ‘a vain belief in magic’ and its
teachings on universal peace as ‘a mere utopia’ (WOB 73). They
have hailed the efforts of the Covenant-breakers as ‘invading
forces of schism’ which would lead the Faith to complete ‘ruin’
(WOB 73).

It is God’s design, Shoghi Effendi further points out, that the
centre of Bahá’í activity should gravitate ‘away from its cradle to
the shores of the American continent’, from East to West (WOB
74). He then draws a parallel to the rise of Christianity in the
East and the manner in which, at its appointed time, the
‘standard-bearers of the Cause of Jesus Christ’ succeeded in
establishing ‘His worldwide dominion on the ruins’ of the
Roman Empire (WOB 74). The spread of the Faith from Iran to
the West was one of the most outstanding aims adopted by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá for His Ministry. Shoghi Effendi describes the
infinite love which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá showered, incessantly but
wisely, on the American friends, culminating in His choice to
address the Tablets of the Divine Plan specifically to the North
American Bahá’í community.

He then reviews the developments of the Faith during each of
the four decades since its appearance in North America. He lauds
the influence exerted by the early Western pilgrims to the Holy
Land, and the manner in which the Faith struck its roots in

\[156\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

American soil. The passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, he points out,
released ‘potent energies’ which crystallized in the system of
Bahá’í Administration. After referring to Covenant-breakers and
their vicious onslaughts on the Faith, he assures the friends that
‘these notorious exponents of corruption and heresy’ succeed ‘in
protruding for a time their ugly features only to sink, as rapidly
as they had risen, into the mire of an ignominious end’ (WOB
90).

Shoghi Effendi then lavishly extols the American Bahá’í
community for its success in formulating the legal instruments to
incorporate the National Assembly, in transferring national
endowments into its name, in succouring its Egyptian brethren,
in intervening on behalf of its fellow workers in the Soviet
Republics, and in extending its support for its harassed brethren
in Persia. He particularly praises the efforts of such members of
the community as Mountfort Mills for his defence of the right of
the Bahá’ís to the ownership of the House of Bahá’u’lláh in
Baghdád, and Martha Root for her confirmed teaching work and
particularly her success in obtaining from royalty repeated
testimonies to the power of God’s Holy Faith. He also mentions
the courageous efforts of Keith Ransom-Kehler to obtain for the
Persian Bahá’í community a greater measure of freedom and
recognition, and finally the band of American women pioneers
who scattered throughout the continents to raise the standard of
the Faith in different countries.

He ends this stirring message with these questions, which he
puts to the American Bahá’í community:

> Will it be America, will it be one of the countries of Europe,
> who will arise to assume the leadership essential to the
> shaping of the destinies of this troubled age? Will America
> allow any of her sister communities in East or West to
> achieve such ascendancy as shall deprive her of that spiritual
> primacy with which she has been invested and which she has
thus far so nobly retained? Will she not rather contribute, by

> a still further revelation of those inherent powers that motiv-
> ate her life, to enhance the priceless heritage which the love
and wisdom of a departed Master have conferred upon her?

Her past has been a testimony to the inexhaustible vitality
of her faith. May not her future confirm it? (WOB 94)

A few more quotes from the letter follow:

> Contrast the sad plight of the nations of the earth, and in
> particular this great Republic of the West, with the rising
> fortunes of that handful of its citizens [the Bahá’ís], whose
> mission, if they be faithful to their trust, is to heal its wounds,
> restore its confidence and revive its shattered hopes.
> Contrast the dreadful convulsions, the internecine conflicts,
> the petty disputes, the outworn controversies, the intermin-
> able revolutions that agitate the masses, with the calm new
> light of Peace and of Truth which envelops, guides and
> sustains those valiant inheritors of the law and love of
> Bahá’u’lláh. Compare the disintegrating institutions, the dis-
> credited statesmanship, the exploded theories, the appalling
> degradation, the follies and furies, the shifts, shams and com-
> promises that characterize the present age, with the steady
> consolidation, the holy discipline, the unity and cohesiveness,
> the assured conviction, the uncompromising loyalty, the
> heroic self-sacrifice that constitute the hallmark of these
> faithful stewards and harbingers of the golden age of the
> Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. (WOB 79)

> The passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, so sudden in the circumstances
> which caused it, so dramatic in its consequences, could
> neither impede the operation of such a dynamic force nor
> obscure its purpose. Those fervid appeals, embodied in the
> Will and Testament of a departed Master, could not but
> confirm its aim, define its character and reinforce the
> promise of its ultimate success.

\[158\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

Out of the pangs of anguish which His bereaved
followers have suffered, amid the heat and dust which the
attacks launched by a sleepless enemy had precipitated, the
Administration of Bahá’u’lláh’s invincible Faith was born.
The potent energies released through the ascension of the
Center of His Covenant crystallized into this supreme, this
infallible Organ for the accomplishment of a Divine Purpose.
The Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá unveiled its
character, reaffirmed its basis, supplemented its principles,
asserted its indispensability, and enumerated its chief
institutions. With that self-same spontaneity which had
characterized her response to the Message proclaimed by
Bahá’u’lláh America had now arisen to espouse the cause of
the Administration which the Will and Testament of His Son
had unmistakably established. It was given to her, and to her
alone, in the turbulent years following the revelation of so
momentous a Document, to become the fearless champion of
that Administration, the pivot of its new-born institutions and
the leading promoter of its influence. To their Persian
brethren, who in the heroic age of the Faith had won the
crown of martyrdom, the American believers, forerunners of
its golden age, were now worthily succeeding, bearing in
their turn the palm of a hard-won victory. The unbroken
record of their illustrious deeds had established beyond the
shadow of a doubt their preponderating share in shaping the
destinies of their Faith. In a world writhing with pain and
declining into chaos this community – the vanguard of the
liberating forces of Bahá’u’lláh – succeeded in the years
following ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s passing in raising high above the
institutions established by its sister communities in East and
West what may well constitute the chief pillar of that future
House – a House which posterity will regard as the last
refuge of a tottering civilization. (WOB 89)

H. ‘The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh’

‘The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh’ is one of the major works of
Shoghi Effendi, written at a time when both Communism and
Fascism were spreading their influence across Europe. In this
work, 60 pages in length, Shoghi Effendi gives us the basic and
doctrinal verities of the Faith, which lie at its very core. In a
letter of 10 January 1935 to an individual believer, the Guardian
points out that his ‘Dispensation’ constitutes an ‘invaluable
supplement’ to Bahá’u’lláh’s Book of the Covenant, and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament (LDG Vol. 1, 65). It is
worthy of note that Shoghi Effendi states that the Will and
Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá itself ‘supplements’ (WOB 19) the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas in matters related to the World Order.

Of such importance is ‘The Dispensation’ that Rúḥíyyih
Khánum, in The Priceless Pearl, relates that Shoghi Effendi had
remarked more than once that he ‘considered he had said all he
had to say, in many ways, in the Dispensation’ (PP 213). To
many pilgrims, including Hands of the Cause, he stated that his
‘Dispensation’ should be regarded as his will and testament.

At the very outset of the document, Shoghi Effendi states that
he intends in this letter to ‘lay special stress . . . upon certain
truths which lie at the basis of our Faith and the integrity of
which it is our first duty to safeguard. These verities, if valiantly
upheld and properly assimilated, will, I am convinced, power-
fully reinforce the vigor of our spiritual life, and greatly assist in
counteracting the machinations of an implacable and vigilant
enemy’ (WOB 99–100).

The purpose of this remarkable document is for the believers
to attain to a clear understanding of the unique stations of
Bahá’u’lláh, the Báb and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He describes these three
Figures in the following paragraph:

> Dominating the entire range of this fascinating spectacle [the
> mysterious workings of God’s Revelation] towers the

\[160\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

> incomparable figure of Bahá’u’lláh, transcendental in His
> majesty, serene, awe-inspiring, unapproachably glorious.
> Allied, though subordinate in rank, and invested with the
> authority of presiding with Him over the destinies of this
> supreme Dispensation, there shines upon this mental picture
> the youthful glory of the Báb, infinite in His tenderness,
> irresistible in His charm, unsurpassed in His heroism,
> matchless in the dramatic circumstances of His short yet
> eventful life. And finally there emerges, though on a plane of
> its own and in a category entirely apart from the one
> occupied by the twin Figures that preceded Him, the vibrant,
> the magnetic personality of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, reflecting to a
> degree that no man, however exalted his station, can hope to
> rival, the glory and power with which They who are the
> Manifestations of God are alone endowed. (WOB 97–8)

The first section of this letter is the citation of several
excerpts from the Writings of the Central Figures of the Faith, to
disclose to the reader ‘the sublimity of this unique Cycle in the
world’s religious history’ (WOB 112). In explaining the station
of Bahá’u’lláh, Shoghi Effendi makes it very clear that the
Manifestation of God and the divinity attributed to Him should
not be confused with the idea of divine incarnation in the person
of the Manifestation. Shoghi Effendi categorically states:

> [T]hat invisible yet rational God Who, however much we
> extol the divinity of His Manifestations on earth, can in no
> wise incarnate His infinite, His unknowable, His
> incorruptible and all-embracing Reality in the concrete and
> limited frame of a mortal being. Indeed, the God Who could
> so incarnate His own reality would, in the light of the
> teachings of Bahá’u’lláh, cease immediately to be God.

(WOB 112)

This belief, he maintains, ‘should never be obscured, and [its]
integrity . . . no one of His followers should allow to be
compromised’ (WOB 114).

The last part of the section dealing with Bahá’u’lláh quotes
from the Writings to indicate the oneness that unites all Divine
Revelations, their continuity and progressiveness, and the fact
that Bahá’u’lláh, despite the vast range of His Dispensation,
‘repudiates the claim to be regarded as the final revelation of
God’s will and purpose for mankind’ (WOB 115).

The next section considers the station of the Báb. Shoghi
Effendi writes: ‘Indeed the greatness of the Báb consists
primarily, not in His being the divinely-appointed Forerunner of
so transcendent a Revelation, but rather in His having been
invested with the powers inherent in the inaugurator of a
separate religious Dispensation, and in His wielding, to a degree
unrivalled by the Messengers gone before Him, the scepter of
independent Prophethood’ (WOB 123). This forthright statement
is substantiated by him with several quotations from the Writings
of Bahá’u’lláh, the Báb Himself, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

The third section discusses the distinctive station of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. Shoghi Effendi writes,

> It would be indeed difficult for us, who stand so close to such
> a tremendous figure and are drawn by the mysterious power
> of so magnetic a personality, to obtain a clear and exact
> understanding of the rôle and character of One Who, not
> only in the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh but in the entire field
> of religious history, fulfills a unique function . . . He towers,
> in conjunction with them [Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb], above
> the destinies of this infant Faith of God from a level to which
> no individual or body ministering to its needs after Him, and
> for no less a period than a full thousand years, can ever hope
> to rise. (WOB 131–2)

\[162\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

A series of quotations follows from the Writings of
Bahá’u’lláh to support his statement. He ends the section by
asserting that the belief of some early Western Bahá’ís to the
effect that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was the return of Christ, and that He
and Bahá’u’lláh possessed the same station and reality, was
completely erroneous. Such an identity applies indeed to the Báb
and Bahá’u’lláh Themselves.

The final section of the letter deals with the Administrative
Order and its twin institutions of the Guardianship and the
Universal House of Justice. In describing its significance, Shoghi
Effendi writes:

> This Administrative Order, as it expands and consolidates
> itself, will no doubt manifest the potentialities and reveal the
> full implications of this momentous Document [the Will and
> Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] – this most remarkable expres-
> sion of the Will of One of the most remarkable Figures of the
> Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh. It will, as its component parts,
> its organic institutions, begin to function with efficiency and
> vigor, assert its claim and demonstrate its capacity to be
> regarded not only as the nucleus but the very pattern of the
> New World Order destined to embrace in the fullness of time
> the whole of mankind. (WOB 144)

He further stresses the point that in the scripture of none of the
religions of the past ‘do we find any provisions establishing a
covenant, or providing for an administrative order, that can
compare in scope and authority with those that lie at the very
basis of the Bahá’í Dispensation’ (WOB 145).

This section goes on to explain the character and functions of
the twin pillars that support this administrative structure,
described by him as ‘two fundamental organs of the Will of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ (WOB 147) and clarifies the relationship between
the two. The final pages of this section deal with the similarities

and dissimilarities between this Administrative Order and the
theory and practice of other systems of governance in the world.

Further quotations are included below:

> Significant as are the origins of this mighty administrative
> structure, and however unique its features, the happenings
> that may be said to have heralded its birth and signalized the
> initial stage of its evolution seem no less remarkable. How
> striking, how edifying the contrast between the process of
> slow and steady consolidation that characterizes the growth
> of its infant strength and the devastating onrush of the forces
> of disintegration that are assailing the outworn institutions,
both religious and secular, of present-day society!

The vitality which the organic institutions of this great,

> the breadth of vision, the confident hope, the creative joy, the

I. ‘The Unfoldment of World Civilization’

In 1936, in the context of escalating political turmoil and dire
socio-economic conditions in Europe and America, Shoghi
Effendi addressed the Bahá’ís of the West. Although, he stated,
the signs of progress in the development of the New World
Order were evident to any ‘fair-minded observer’, he warned that
concurrent with that rise was the ‘downfall of those powers and
principalities that have either ignored or opposed’ the onward
march of the Faith (WOB 161). This process of ‘mystic, all-
pervasive’ change which the Guardian describes is twofold
(WOB 163–4). On one hand, it increasingly engenders oneness
and cohesion. On the other, it disrupts an already ailing world,
forcing mankind to abandon its ‘hollow and outworn institutions’
and its ‘obsolescent doctrines and beliefs’ (WOB 170). In further
elaborating on this simultaneous and paradoxical process of
integration and disintegration, Shoghi Effendi draws an inter-
esting parallel between the incremental evolution of global
government and society and the period of crisis preceding the
eventual foundation of the United States of America. He explains

that the ‘moral and social gloom’ which characterizes human-
ity’s state of collective adolescence would lead to its maturation
and prepare it for its inevitable unification (WOB 168). He also
emphasizes that this ‘coming of age’ would accord with the
existing operational structure and animating spirit of the
Administrative Order (WOB 163).

Shoghi Effendi attributed the fall of Shi’ah Islam and the
Qájár dynasty, and the receding power of the Sunni caliphs of
Constantinople, to the rampant rise of secularism in the East. He
explained that the sovereign leaders of these Faiths and Empires
were the authors of their own demise by attempting to obstruct
the advancement of the Faith, and by failing to heed Bahá-
’u’lláh’s warnings. In demonstrating this, the Guardian provides
examples of Bahá’u’lláh’s messages and describes the fate that
befell those who disregarded His Call. He parallels the plight of
Islam with that of Christianity, foretelling that ‘the forces of
irreligion, of a purely materialistic philosophy [and] of
unconcealed paganism’ (WOB 180) would trigger its downfall.
Unbridled industrialism had overcome the erstwhile ‘Christian’
world, and a concomitant rise in nationalism – inculcating in due
course the deification of the state – would unavoidably result in
‘a marked weakening of the Church and . . . a grave diminution
of its spiritual influence’ (WOB 182). The Guardian also points
to a widening gulf between liberal and fundamentalist denom-
inations within the Christian and Muslim Faiths as being a
contributory factor to the weakening of their influence.

The Guardian explains that the progressive decay of these
religions would result in a phase of decadence, perversion and
corruption in human conduct; and that political disarray and
economic strangulation, as well as the inefficacy of multilateral
governance structures on the global stage, were a direct con-
sequence of humanity’s morally retarded state. However, he
applauds efforts made by the League of Nations Member States
in attempting to develop a sufficiently forceful collective security
system, and quotes passages from Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings on the

\[166\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

subject. He also stresses that it is only through the regulation of
the use of force and the development of a commonly acceptable
international executive mechanism that ‘the oneness of the whole
body of nations will be made the ruling principle of international
life’ (WOB 193). The time of nation-building, he underlines, is at
an end, and the insistence on preserving absolute state
sovereignty is counterproductive to ‘the oneness and wholeness
of human relationships’ (WOB 202).

Shoghi Effendi concludes by emphasizing the non-sectarian,
‘rigidly non-partisan’ (WOB 198) and supranational nature of
the Faith. He explains that Bahá’u’lláh foresaw the inauguration
of a universal system of governance, and the establishment of a
world language, currency, script and system of measurement.

Some further quotes from this remarkable document are
given below:

as Bábí sect, Asiatic cult, and offshoot of Shí’ih Islám, with
which the ignorant and the malicious were wont to describe
it, refusing to be labeled as a mere philosophy of life, or as
an eclectic code of ethical conduct, or even as a new
religion, the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh is now visibly succeeding
in demonstrating its claim and title to be regarded as a
World Religion, destined to attain, in the fullness of time, the
status of a world-embracing Commonwealth, which would be
at once the instrument and the guardian of the Most Great
Peace announced by its Author. (WOB 196)

How can a Faith, it should moreover be borne in mind,
whose divinely-ordained institutions have been established
within the jurisdiction of no less than forty different
countries, the policies and interests of whose governments
are continually clashing and growing more complex and
confused every day – how can such a Faith, by allowing its
adherents, whether individually or through its organized
councils, to meddle in political activities, succeed in
preserving the integrity of its teachings and in safeguarding
the unity of its followers? How can it insure the vigorous, the
uninterrupted and peaceful development of its expanding
institutions? How can a Faith, whose ramifications have
brought it into contact with mutually incompatible religious
systems, sects and confessions, be in a position, if it permits
its adherents to subscribe to obsolescent observances and
doctrines, to claim the unconditional allegiance of those
whom it is striving to incorporate into its divinely-appointed
system? How can it avoid the constant friction, the
misunderstandings and controversies which formal affili-
ation, as distinct from association, must inevitably engender?
(WOB 199)

The long ages of infancy and childhood, through which the
human race had to pass, have receded into the background.

> associated with the most turbulent stage of its evolution, the
> stage of adolescence, when the impetuosity of youth and its

J. The Advent of Divine Justice

The Advent of Divine Justice reads like a 77-page poem. Written
in December 1938, at a time when Europe was showing signs of
profound unrest, which led less than a year later to the outbreak

\[170\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

of the Second World War, this letter, addressed to the Bahá’í
community of the United States and Canada, focuses on the
nature and scope of America’s divinely-ordained mission, and
states that ‘the impelling force of circumstances’ (ADJ 43) will
inevitably oblige it to overcome its various challenges and
execute the tasks which lie ahead. Shoghi Effendi meticulously
lists such characteristics as are imperative if Bahá’ís in North
America are to carry out its mission. Among them the Guardian
specifically mentions ‘a rectitude of conduct’ (ADJ 26), ‘an
abiding sense of undeviating justice’ (ADJ 23), adherence to ‘the
obligation of chastity and holiness’ (ADJ 29), and ‘a fraternity
freed from that cancerous growth of racial prejudice, which is
eating into the vitals of an already debilitated society’ (ADJ 23).

American society, Shoghi Effendi points out, is ‘immersed in
a sea of materialism, a prey to one of the most virulent and long-
standing forms of racial prejudice, and notorious for its political
corruption, lawlessness and laxity in moral standards’ (ADJ 19).
In fact, he emphasizes that it is not because of any ‘racial
superiority’, social capacity or spiritual distinction that America
was chosen as ‘champion-builders’ of the Administrative Order,
but because it was a nation stained by ‘political corruption and
. . . moral license’ (ADJ 17, 20, 20).

The letter also sets out the requirements of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
Divine Plan and the Seven Year Plan, mentioning in turn the
teaching requirements that are incumbent upon all believers and
the need for thorough intellectual familiarization with the
history, social principles and spiritual teachings of both the
Bahá’í Faith and its predecessor, Islam. The Guardian encour-
ages the American Bahá’ís to consider pioneering within the
Americas, and stresses the importance of ‘rearing’ (ADJ 63)
permanent local and national institutions within the US and
across the two continents. The importance of the participation of
Bahá’í youth in the execution of this mission is also underlined.
Youth, he states, ‘can contribute so decisively to the virility, the
purity, and the driving force of the life of the Bahá’í community,

and upon [them] must depend the future orientation of its
destiny, and the complete unfoldment of the potentialities with
which God has endowed it’ (ADJ 22).

Shoghi Effendi explained that the pervasive and intensifying
political turmoil of the late 1930s, in itself, presented an ideal
opportunity both for the spiritual growth of the Bahá’í com-
munity and for the wider dissemination of the message of
Bahá’u’lláh. ‘These recurrent crises’, he writes, ‘which, with
ominous frequency and resistless force, are afflicting an ever-
increasing portion of the human race must of necessity continue,
however impermanently, to exercise, in a certain measure, their
baleful influence upon a world community which has spread its
ramifications to the uttermost ends of the earth’ (ADJ 2).

Later he writes that ‘The opportunities which the turmoil of
the present age presents, with all the sorrows which it evokes,
the fears which it excites, the disillusionment which it produces,
the perplexities which it creates, the indignation which it
arouses, the revolt which it provokes, the grievances it
engenders, the spirit of restless search which it awakens, must, in
like manner, be exploited for the purpose of spreading far and
wide the knowledge of the redemptive power of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh, and for enlisting fresh recruits in the ever-swelling
army of His followers’ (ADJ 48). ‘[T]he synchronization of such
world-shaking crises’, he goes on to say, ‘with the progressive
unfoldment and fruition of their divinely appointed task is itself
the work of Providence . . . Such simultaneous processes of rise
and fall, of integration and of disintegration, of order and chaos,
with their continuous and reciprocal reactions on each other, are
but aspects of a greater Plan, one and indivisible, whose Source
is God, whose author is Bahá’u’lláh, the theater of whose
operations is the entire planet, and whose ultimate objectives
are the unity of the human race and the peace of all mankind’
(ADJ 72–3).

Much of what the Guardian was telling the American Bahá’í
Community in 1939 is distressingly applicable to the socio-

\[172\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

political context in which the world finds itself today. ‘The light
of religion is dimmed and moral authority is disintegrating,’
Shoghi Effendi writes. ‘The nations of the world have, for the
most part, fallen a prey to battling ideologies that threaten to
disrupt the very foundations of their dearly won political unity.
Agitated multitudes in these countries seethe with discontent, are
armed to the teeth, are stampeded with fear, and groan beneath
the yoke of tribulations engendered by political strife, racial
fanaticism, national hatreds, and religious animosities’ (ADJ
88). This, therefore, represents an ideal time for Bahá’í youth to
trigger change.

A few more excerpts from this precious and often-quoted
document are included below.

> disintegrating from within, finds itself confronted, at so

> order to which humanity is steadily falling a victim. The
> strongholds of such a Faith, one by one and day after day,
> are to outward seeming being successively isolated, as-

> sion, and of complete emancipation, leading in turn to its
> being acknowledged as an independent Faith, enjoying the
> status of full equality with its sister religions, to be followed
> by its establishment and recognition as a State religion,
> which in turn must give way to its assumption of the rights
> and prerogatives associated with the Bahá’í state, func-
> tioning in the plenitude of its powers, a stage which must
> ultimately culminate in the emergence of the worldwide
> Bahá’í Commonwealth, animated wholly by the spirit, and
> operating solely in direct conformity with the laws and
> principles of Bahá’u’lláh. (ADJ 14–15)

> Let not, however, the invincible army of Bahá’u’lláh, who in

> nation with which the tongue of the slanderer may seek to

eventually win over to its camp the most vociferous and
inveterate amongst its foes. (ADJ 42)

The field is indeed so immense, the period so critical, the
Cause so great, the workers so few, the time so short, the
privilege so priceless, that no follower of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh, worthy to bear His name, can afford a
moment’s hesitation. That God-born Force, irresistible in its
sweeping power, incalculable in its potency, unpredictable in
its course, mysterious in its workings, and awe-inspiring in
its manifestations – a Force which, as the Báb has written,
‘vibrates within the innermost being of all created things,’
and which, according to Bahá’u’lláh, has through its ‘vibrat-
ing influence,’ ‘upset the equilibrium of the world and revo-
lutionized its ordered life’ – such a Force, acting even as a
two-edged sword, is, under our very eyes, sundering, on the
one hand, the age-old ties which for centuries have held
together the fabric of civilized society, and is unloosing, on
the other, the bonds that still fetter the infant and as yet
unemancipated Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. (ADJ 46–7)

The opportunities which the turmoil of the present age
presents, with all the sorrows which it evokes, the fears
which it excites, the disillusionment which it produces, the
perplexities which it creates, the indignation which it
arouses, the revolt which it provokes, the grievances it
engenders, the spirit of restless search which it awakens,
must, in like manner, be exploited for the purpose of
spreading far and wide the knowledge of the redemptive
power of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, and for enlisting fresh
recruits in the ever-swelling army of His followers. So
precious an opportunity, so rare a conjunction of favorable
circumstances, may never again recur. Now is the time, the
appointed time, for the American believers, the vanguard of
the hosts of the Most Great Name, to proclaim, through the

> agencies and channels of a specially designed Administrative
> Order, their capacity and readiness to rescue a fallen and
> sore-tried generation, that has rebelled against its God and
> ignored His warnings, and to offer it that complete security
> which only the strongholds of their Faith can provide. (ADJ

K. The Promised Day is Come

Written in 1941, in the early years of the Second World War, and
addressed to the Bahá’ís of the West, The Promised Day is Come
reminded believers that the ‘retributive calamity’ (PDC 183) that
had overcome humanity at that point in history was largely due
to its ignorance of the modern message of God. In order to
underline the importance of the Divine Call in this day, the
Guardian quotes extensive passages from the Writings of the
Central Figures of the Faith. The book comprises 130 pages.
Shoghi Effendi includes some 50 pages of direct quotations from
the Writings, of which more than half run to an entire page. The
rest are scattered throughout the body of the text.

As ever-escalating conflict gripped the world, Shoghi Effendi
reassured the Bahá’í community of the genesis, direction and
necessity of the ‘titanic upheaval’ mankind was experiencing
(PDC 5). Underpinning his message was the notion that fears for
the immediate future necessarily engendered hope for the distant
future and that, though the severity of the calamity seemed
overwhelming, it would inexorably result in worldwide accept-
ance of Bahá’u’lláh’s message. He writes: ‘It [the judgment of
God] is at once a visitation from God and a cleansing process
for all mankind. Its fires punish the perversity of the human race,
and weld its component parts into one organic, indivisible,
world-embracing community’ (PDC 5–6). Contrasting the
‘distressing’ darkness of the past with the ‘glorious’ radiance of
the future, the Guardian explains that the path towards human-
ity’s ultimate unification must, of necessity, comprise a stage of

\[176\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

adversity and discord (PDC 200–1). Although ‘the folly and
tumult of strife . . . blackened the annals of mankind’, this would
constitute a prerequisite for ‘worldwide reconciliation’ and a
lasting, universal peace (PDC 192).

He writes: ‘We are indeed living in an age which, if we
would correctly appraise it, should be regarded as one which is
witnessing a dual phenomenon. The first signalizes the death
pangs of an order, effete and godless, that has stubbornly
refused, despite the signs and portents of a century-old Reve-
lation, to attune its processes to the precepts and ideals which
that Heaven-sent Faith proffered it. The second proclaims the
birth pangs of an Order, divine and redemptive, that will
inevitably supplant the former, and within Whose administrative
structure an embryonic civilization, incomparable and world-
embracing, is imperceptibly maturing. The one is being rolled
up, and is crashing in oppression, bloodshed, and ruin. The
other opens up vistas of a justice, a unity, a peace, a culture,
such as no age has ever seen. The former has spent its force,
demonstrated its falsity and barrenness, lost irretrievably its
opportunity, and is hurrying to its doom. The latter, virile and
unconquerable, is plucking asunder its chains, and is vindicating
its title to be the one refuge within which a sore-tried humanity,
purged from its dross, can attain its destiny’ (PDC 27).

The document charts the history and evolution of the Bahá’í
Faith, and describes in detail the lives of the Báb and
Bahá’u’lláh. In surveying the nature of ‘the international scene’
(PDC 25) in the context of the early stages of Bahá’í history,
Shoghi Effendi also provides a detailed description of the
persecution and opposition that early believers faced in
nineteenth-century Iran.

A series of messages of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh are also
included in the text. They were originally addressed to those
despotic monarchs who were largely responsible for the wrongs
of society, and who were ‘glorying in the pomp and pageantry of
a kingship as yet scarcely restricted by constitutional limitations,

or entrenched within the strongholds of a seemingly inviolable
ecclesiastical power’ (PDC 30). The Guardian presents both a
comprehensive account of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh’s letters to
the sovereigns of the world, and an assessment of the degree of
success and consequences of those appeals in gaining support for
the nascent Faith. Some rulers, for example, brushed aside the
messages disdainfully. Others subjected individual adherents to
unthinkably cruel treatment. Shoghi Effendi describes how these
monarchs precipitated the crumbling of their respective dynasties
by failing to answer Bahá’u’lláh’s claim. One by one, he ex-
plains in impressive detail and in characteristically evocative
terms, how, when and why these autocratic regimes in both the
East and the West ultimately fell.

Shoghi Effendi was, however, wary that the teachings of
Bahá’u’lláh be misconstrued as being disparaging to the notion
of kingship and monarchy. On the contrary, the Guardian re-
minds Bahá’ís that ‘the principle of kingship is eulogized, the
rank and conduct of just and fair-minded kings is extolled, the
rise of monarchs, ruling with justice and even professing His
Faith, is envisaged, and the solemn duty to arise and ensure the
triumph of Bahá’í sovereigns is inculcated’ (PDC 117).

Shoghi Effendi draws a further parallel between the decay
of monarchical institutions and the declining influence of the
world’s spiritual leaders, and offers an extensive overview of
the various passages Bahá’u’lláh addressed collectively to those
leaders. The heads of the ecclesiastical orders, particularly in the
Muslim world, were the first who ‘hoisted the standard of revolt’
and ‘inflamed the ignorant and subservient masses against [the
Faith]’ (PDC 122). As with the monarchy, the Guardian revealed
that the ‘calamities that afflicted’ these ecclesiastical hierarchies
– Christian and Muslim alike – were foretold by Bahá’u’lláh’s
message (PDC 164).

> This great retributive calamity, for which the world’s su-
> preme leaders, both secular and religious, are to be regarded

\[178\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

> as primarily answerable, as testified by Bahá’u’lláh, should
> not, if we would correctly appraise it, be regarded solely as a
> punishment meted out by God to a world that has, for a
> hundred years, persisted in its refusal to embrace the truth of
> the redemptive Message proffered to it by the supreme
> Messenger of God in this day. It should be viewed also,
> though to a lesser degree, in the light of a divine retribution
> for the perversity of the human race in general, in casting
> itself adrift from those elementary principles which must, at
> all times, govern, and can alone safeguard, the life and
> progress of mankind. Humanity has, alas, with increasing
> insistence, preferred, instead of acknowledging and adoring
> the Spirit of God as embodied in His religion in this day, to
> worship those false idols, untruths and half-truths, which are
> obscuring its religions, corrupting its spiritual life, con-
> vulsing its political institutions, corroding its social fabric,
> and shattering its economic structure. (PDC 183–4)

In concluding, Shoghi Effendi emphasizes that it was not
Bahá’u’lláh’s intention to dismiss or belittle the teachings of
other Dispensations, but simply to impress upon His followers
the principle of the progressiveness and continuity of Divine
Revelation, and to convey the idea that these seemingly disparate
Revelations were, in fact, united by a shared purpose and by the
commonality of the fundamental values that they enshrine.

‘The world is, in truth, moving on towards its destiny’,
Shoghi Effendi explains. ‘The interdependence of the peoples
and nations of the earth, whatever the leaders of the divisive
forces of the world may say or do, is already an accomplished
fact. Its unity in the economic sphere is now understood and
recognized. The welfare of the part means the welfare of the
whole, and the distress of the part brings distress to the whole
. . . The fires lit by this great ordeal are the consequences of
men’s failure to recognize [the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh]’ (PDC
200–1).

A few further quotations from the book follow below:

> A tempest, unprecedented in its violence, unpredictable in its
> course, catastrophic in its immediate effects, unimaginably
> glorious in its ultimate consequences, is at present sweeping
> the face of the earth. Its driving power is remorselessly gain-

> much undetected, is increasing with every passing day.
> Humanity, gripped in the clutches of its devastating power, is
> smitten by the evidences of its resistless fury. It can neither
> perceive its origin, nor probe its significance, nor discern its
> outcome. Bewildered, agonized and helpless, it watches this
> great and mighty wind of God invading the remotest and
> fairest regions of the earth, rocking its foundations, derang-
> ing its equilibrium, sundering its nations, disrupting the
> homes of its peoples, wasting its cities, driving into exile its

> dimming its light, and harrowing up the souls of its
> inhabitants. (PDC 1)

> Who is the ruler, may it not be confidently asked, whether of

\[180\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

the rising light of the Faith, to contemplate its unfolding
system, to ponder its hidden processes, to appraise its
weighty message, to acknowledge its regenerative power, to
embrace its salutary truth, or to proclaim its eternal verities?
Who among the worldly wise and the so-called men of insight
and wisdom can justly claim, after the lapse of nearly a cen-
tury, to have disinterestedly approached its theme, to have
considered impartially its claims, to have taken sufficient
pains to delve into its literature, to have assiduously striven
to separate facts from fiction, or to have accorded its cause
the treatment it merits? Where are the preeminent exponents,
whether of the arts or sciences, with the exception of a few
isolated cases, who have lifted a finger, or whispered a word
of commendation, in either the defense or the praise of a
Faith that has conferred upon the world so priceless a bene-
fit, that has suffered so long and so grievously, and which
enshrines within its shell so enthralling a promise for a world
so woefully battered, so manifestly bankrupt? (PDC 20–1)

God . . . does not only punish the wrongdoings of His
children. He chastises because He is just, and He chastens
because He loves. Having chastened them, He cannot, in His
great mercy, leave them to their fate. Indeed, by the very act
of chastening them He prepares them for the mission for
which He has created them . . .

God’s purpose is none other than to usher in, in ways He
alone can bring about, and the full significance of which He
alone can fathom, the Great, the Golden Age of a long-
divided, a long-afflicted humanity. Its present state, indeed
even its immediate future, is dark, distressingly dark. Its
distant future, however, is radiant, gloriously radiant – so
radiant that no eye can visualize it. (PDC 189–90)

L. Citadel of Faith

This 158-page compilation of messages addressed to the
National Spiritual Assembly of the United States was first
published after the Guardian’s death, in 1965. It includes 121
messages, some as letters, and others in cable form, sent over a
period of 10 years between 1947 and 1957. Thirty-nine are
cables sent on the occasion of the passing of outstanding
believers. Apart from these specific communications, the bulk of
Shoghi Effendi’s messages deal with the duties and respon-
sibilities facing the community of the Great Republic of the
West. The preface summarizes the content of the volume as a
description, in ‘challenging terms’, of the world mission of the
American Bahá’ís, ‘reminding them of their spiritual primacy as
the trustees and executors of the Divine Plan of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
and reinforcing that primacy with the mysterious power of
accomplishment inherent in his words of encouragement and
exhortation’ (CF v).

The longest letter is 34 pages in length, and was separately
published under the title of The Challenging Requirements of the
Present Hour. Six others are from 8 to 12 pages long. In these
messages Shoghi Effendi explains in great detail the needs and
challenges of the second Seven Year Plan, sees a parallel
between the processes propelling the American Bahá’í com-

munity and the American Republic itself, draws the attention of
the friends to the inevitability of tribulations, crises and trials,
impresses upon the friends the importance of supporting the
international and national funds, reminds them of the promises of
divine blessings as stated in the utterances of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
appeals to them to scale nobler heights of heroism, and finally
advises them to have a period of austerity, curtailing some of
their activities in order to divert contributions to the Temple
Fund. In this volume we read about the significance of the Shrine
of the Báb and the construction of its superstructure, and learn of
the disaffection of members of Shoghi Effendi’s family and their
passing out from under the shadow of the Cause. Emphasis is
laid on the continuous extension of the teaching work, the need
of Europe for a flow of devoted pioneers, and on the urgency of
supporting the teaching undertakings in Africa, while the friends
are reminded that priority should be given to the announced
goals and objectives of the Ten Year Crusade.

The Guardian underlines the fact that the American Bahá’í
community will face perils, trials and crises stemming from such
internal issues as racial prejudice, as well as conflicts on the
world scene. He relates the premeditated campaign of per-
secution against the Persian Bahá’ís, and portrays it as a blessing
in disguise, aiding the proclamation of the Faith worldwide. In
these pages we also read about the irreplaceable contribution of
the individual believer, and the need for personal consecration
and dedication to the pressing tasks facing the community.
Shoghi Effendi assures the friends that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ‘watchful
care and unfailing grace [will] continue to sustain them,
individually and collectively’ (CF 158).

Some more quotations from this important compilation are
included below:

> A continent [Europe], twice blessed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s suc-
> cessive visits to its shores, and the scene of His first public

\[184\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

civilization to some of whose beneficent features the pen of
Bahá’u’lláh has paid significant tribute; on whose soil both
the Greek and Roman civilizations were born and flourished;
which has contributed so richly to the unfoldment of
American civilization; the fountainhead of American culture;
the mother of Christendom, and the scene of the greatest
exploits of the followers of Jesus Christ; in some of whose
outlying territories have been won some of the most
resplendent victories which ushered in the Golden Age of
Islám; which sustained, in its very heart, the violent impact of
the onrushing hosts of that Faith, intent on the subjugation of
its cities, but which refused to bend the knee to its invaders,
and succeeded in the end in repulsing their assault – such a
continent is now experiencing, at the hands of the little as yet
unnoticed band of pioneers sent forth by the enviable, the
privileged, the dynamic American Bahá’í Community, the
first stirrings of that spiritual revolution which must
culminate, in the Golden Age that is as yet unborn, in the
permanent establishment of Bahá’u’lláh’s Order throughout
that continent. (CF 26–7)

Indeed if we would read aright the signs of the times, and
appraise correctly the significances of contemporaneous
events that are impelling forward both the American Bahá’í
Community and the nation of which it forms a part on the
road leading them to their ultimate destiny, we cannot fail to
perceive the workings of two simultaneous processes,
generated as far back as the concluding years of the Heroic
Age of our Faith, each clearly defined, each distinctly
separate, yet closely related and destined to culminate, in the
fullness of time, in a single glorious consummation.

One of these processes is associated with the mission of
the American Bahá’í Community, the other with the destiny
of the American nation. The one serves directly the interests
of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, the

> other promotes indirectly the institutions that are to be
> associated with the establishment of His World Order. The
> first process dates back to the revelation of those stupendous
> Tablets constituting the Charter of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine
> Plan. It was held in abeyance for well-nigh twenty years
> while the fabric of an indispensable Administrative Order,
> designed as a divinely appointed agency for the operation of
> that Plan, was being constructed. It registered its initial
> success with the triumphant conclusion of the first stage of its
> operation in the republics of the Western Hemisphere. It
> signalized the opening of the second phase of its development
> through the inauguration of the present teaching campaign in
> the European continent. It must pass into the third stage of its
> evolution with the initiation of the third Seven Year Plan,
> designed to culminate in the establishment of the structure of
> the Administrative Order in all the remaining sovereign
> states and chief dependencies of the globe. It must reach the
> end of the first epoch in its evolution with the fulfilment of the
> prophecy mentioned by Daniel in the last chapter of His
> Book, related to the year 1335, and associated by ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá with the world triumph of the Faith of His Father. It
> will be consummated through the emergence of the Bahá’í
> World Commonwealth in the Golden Age of the Bahá’í
Dispensation.

The other process dates back to the outbreak of the First
> World War that threw the great republic of the West into the
> vortex of the first stage of a world upheaval. It received its
> initial impetus through the formulation of President Wilson’s
> Fourteen Points, closely associating for the first time that
> republic with the fortunes of the Old World. It suffered its
> first setback through the dissociation of that republic from
> the newly born League of Nations which that president had
> labored to create. It acquired added momentum through the
> outbreak of the second World War, inflicting unprecedented
> suffering on that republic, and involving it still further in the

\[186\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

affairs of all the continents of the globe. It was further
reinforced through the declaration embodied in the Atlantic
Charter, as voiced by one of its chief progenitors, Franklin
D. Roosevelt. It assumed a definite outline through the birth
of the United Nations at the San Francisco Conference. It
acquired added significance through the choice of the City of
the Covenant itself as the seat of the newly born organiz-
ation, through the declaration recently made by the
American president related to his country’s commitments in
Greece and Turkey, as well as through the submission to the
General Assembly of the United Nations of the thorny and
challenging problem of the Holy Land, the spiritual as well
as the administrative center of the World Faith of Bahá-
’u’lláh. It must, however long and tortuous the way, lead,
through a series of victories and reverses, to the political
unification of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, to the
emergence of a world government and the establishment of
the Lesser Peace, as foretold by Bahá’u’lláh and
foreshadowed by the Prophet Isaiah. It must, in the end,
culminate in the unfurling of the banner of the Most Great
Peace, in the Golden Age of the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh.
(CF 31–3)

The champion builders of Bahá’u’lláh’s rising World Order
must scale nobler heights of heroism as humanity plunges
into greater depths of despair, degradation, dissension and
distress. Let them forge ahead into the future serenely
confident that the hour of their mightiest exertions and the
supreme opportunity for their greatest exploits must coincide
with the apocalyptic upheaval marking the lowest ebb in
mankind’s fast-declining fortunes. (CF 58)

As the threat of still more violent convulsions assailing a
travailing age increases, and the wings of yet another
conflict, destined to contribute a distinct, and perhaps a

> decisive, share to the birth of the new Order which must
> signalize the advent of the Lesser Peace, darken the
> international horizon, the eyes of the divers communities,
> comprising the body of the organized followers of
> Bahá’u’lláh throughout the Eastern Hemisphere, are being
> increasingly fixed upon the progressive unfoldment of the
> tasks which the executors of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Mandate have
> been summoned to undertake in the course of the second
> stage of their world-girdling mission. (CF 58)

> [N]othing short of the vitalizing influx of new blood [winning
> fresh recruits to the Faith] . . . can safeguard the prizes
[already won] . . .

This flow, moreover, will presage and hasten the advent
> of the day which, as prophesied by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, will
> witness the entry by troops of peoples of divers nations and
> races into the Bahá’í world – a day which, viewed in its
> proper perspective, will be the prelude to that long-awaited
> hour when a mass conversion on the part of these same
> nations and races, and as a direct result of a chain of events,
> momentous and possibly catastrophic in nature, and which
> cannot as yet be even dimly visualized, will suddenly revo-
> lutionize the fortunes of the Faith, derange the equilibrium of
> the world, and reinforce a thousandfold the numerical
> strength as well as the material power and the spiritual
> authority of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. (CF 117)

> The steady and alarming deterioration in the standard of
> morality as exemplified by the appalling increase of crime,
> by political corruption in ever widening and ever higher
> circles, by the loosening of the sacred ties of marriage, by the
> inordinate craving for pleasure and diversion, and by the
> marked and progressive slackening of parental control, is no
> doubt the most arresting and distressing aspect of the decline

\[188\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

that has set in, and can be clearly perceived, in the fortunes
of the entire nation. (CF 124)

Parallel with this, and pervading all departments of life – an
evil which the nation, and indeed all those within the
capitalist system, though to a lesser degree, share with that
state and its satellites regarded as the sworn enemies of that
system – is the crass materialism, which lays excessive and
ever-increasing emphasis on material well-being, forgetful of
those things of the spirit on which alone a sure and stable
foundation can be laid for human society. It is this same
cancerous materialism, born originally in Europe, carried to
excess in the North American continent, contaminating the
Asiatic peoples and nations, spreading its ominous tentacles
to the borders of Africa, and now invading its very heart,
which Bahá’u’lláh in unequivocal and emphatic language
denounced in His Writings, comparing it to a devouring
flame and regarding it as the chief factor in precipitating the
dire ordeals and world-shaking crises that must necessarily
involve the burning of cities and the spread of terror and
consternation in the hearts of men. Indeed a foretaste of the
devastation which this consuming fire will wreak upon the
world, and with which it will lay waste the cities of the
nations participating in this tragic world-engulfing contest,
has been afforded by the last World War, marking the second
stage in the global havoc which humanity, forgetful of its
God and heedless of the clear warnings uttered by His
appointed Messenger for this day, must, alas, inevitably
experience. It is this same all-pervasive, pernicious material-
ism against which the voice of the Center of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Covenant was raised, with pathetic persistence, from plat-
form and pulpit, in His addresses to the heedless multitudes,
which, on the morrow of His fateful visit to both Europe and
America, found themselves suddenly swept into the vortex of

> a tempest which in its range and severity was unsurpassed in
> the world’s history. (CF 124–5)

> No less serious is the stress and strain imposed on the fabric
> of American society through the fundamental and persistent
> neglect, by the governed and governors alike, of the supreme,
> the inescapable and urgent duty – so repeatedly and
> graphically represented and stressed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His
> arraignment of the basic weaknesses in the social fabric of
> the nation – of remedying, while there is yet time, through a
> revolutionary change in the concept and attitude of the
> average white American toward his Negro fellow citizen, a
> situation which, if allowed to drift, will, in the words of
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, cause the streets of American cities to run
> with blood, aggravating thereby the havoc which the fearful
> weapons of destruction, raining from the air, and amassed by
> a ruthless, a vigilant, a powerful and inveterate enemy, will
> wreak upon those same cities. (CF 126)

> This challenge [the requirements of the Ten Year Plan], so
> severe and insistent, and yet so glorious, faces no doubt
> primarily the individual believer on whom, in the last resort,
> depends the fate of the entire community. He it is who
> constitutes the warp and woof on which the quality and
> pattern of the whole fabric must depend. He it is who acts as
> one of the countless links in the mighty chain that now

M. Messages to the Bahá’í World (1950–1957)

This 175-page compilation contains 82 messages of the beloved
Guardian from 25 April 1950 till October 1957. The volume is
divided into two parts. From page 131 onwards, additional
messages have been included under the title ‘Supplementary
Collection’. Shoghi Effendi started his practice of sending one
major message to all the Bahá’í Conventions in April 1950. The
longer messages were sent after the inauguration of the Ten Year
Crusade in 1953, and progressed incrementally in length, from 7
pages in April 1954 to 19 pages in April 1957. At times he would
send a further brief message to some National Assemblies for
their Conventions, if he felt the need to bring certain specific
points to their attention in the areas under their jurisdiction.

A list of major subjects covered in these messages to the
Bahá’í world follows:

> •   Formation of the first International Bahá’í Council
•   Inception of the institution of the Hands of the Cause, in

> accordance with the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá, through the appointment of several contingents
> •   Acquisition of property on Mount Carmel and in Bahjí
> •   Review of the world progress of the Faith
•   Preparing the international Bahá’í community for a

> world-encircling plan, and the subsequent launching of
> the Ten Year Plan
•   The inauguration of the Holy Year, October 1952–
October 1953

•   Announcement of the convocation of four inter-

continental conferences
•   Establishment of a Roll of Honour for the Knights of

Bahá’u’lláh
•   Progress reports on the construction and completion of

the Shrine of the Báb
•   The opposition of Covenant-breakers and the eventual

frustration of their efforts
•   The initiation of the construction of the International

Archives Building
•   Data regarding the plans for the construction of the

Temples in Frankfurt, Kampala and Sydney
> •   Persecution of the Bahá’ís in Persia
> •   Victories won in Africa and the Pacific
•   Announcement of another series of five intercontinental

conferences at the midway point of the Ten Year Crusade
> •   Reopening the doors of pilgrimage in May 1951
> •   Messages to the five intercontinental conferences
•   The ten parts or stages of the social and spiritual

> evolution of mankind leading to the diffusion, penetration
> and suffusion of the light and warmth of God’s Reve-
> lation in human society
•   Future opposition to the Faith.

The messages in this volume, particularly those dated during
the last years and months of Shoghi Effendi’s life, represent his
last wishes to the friends, and voice his incessant and earnest call
on them to vigilantly protect the Cause, vigorously promote its
interests, and steadfastly, unitedly and selflessly maintain the
tempo and indeed increase the momentum of their endeavours in
the path of their love for the Blessed Beauty.

A few excerpts from these soul-stirring messages are
included below:

\[192\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

No matter how long the period that separates them from
ultimate victory; however arduous the task; however for-
midable the exertions demanded of them; however dark the
days which mankind, perplexed and sorely-tried, must, in its
hour of travail, traverse; however severe the tests with which
they who are to redeem its fortunes will be confronted;
however afflictive the darts which their present enemies, as
well as those whom Providence, will, through His mysterious
dispensations raise up from within or from without, may rain
upon them, however grievous the ordeal of temporary
separation from the heart and nerve-center of their Faith
which future unforeseeable disturbances may impose upon
them, I adjure them, by the precious blood that flowed in
such great profusion, by the lives of the unnumbered saints
and heroes who were immolated, by the supreme, the
glorious sacrifice of the Prophet-Herald of our Faith, by the
tribulations which its Founder, Himself, willingly underwent,
so that His Cause might live, His Order might redeem a
shattered world and its glory might suffuse the entire planet –
I adjure them, as this solemn hour draws nigh, to resolve
never to flinch, never to hesitate, never to relax, until each
and every objective in the Plans to be proclaimed, at a later
date, has been fully consummated. (MBW 38–9)

It is indeed my fervent and constant prayer that the members
of this firmly-knit, intensely alive, world-embracing Com-
munity, spurred on by the triple impulse generated through
the revelation of the Tablet of Carmel by Bahá’u’lláh and the
Will and Testament as well as the Tablets of the Divine Plan
bequeathed by the Center of His Covenant – the three
Charters which have set in motion three distinct processes,
the first operating in the Holy Land for the development of
the institutions of the Faith at its World Center and the other
two, throughout the rest of the Bahá’í world, for its
propagation and the establishment of its Administrative

> Order – may advance from strength to strength and victory to
> victory. May they hasten, by their present exertions, the
> advent of that blissful consummation when the shackles
> hampering the growth of their beloved Faith will have been
> finally burst asunder, when its independent status will have
> been officially and universally recognized, when it will have
> ascended the throne and wielded the scepter of spiritual and
> temporal authority, when the brightness of its glory will have
> illuminated the whole earth, and its dominion will have been
> established over the entire planet. (MBW 84–5)

> Against the background of these afflictive disturbances – the
> turmoil and tribulations of a travailing age – we may well
> ponder the portentous prophecies uttered well-nigh fourscore
> years ago, by the Author of our Faith, as well as the dire
> predictions made by Him Who is the unerring Interpreter of
> His teachings, all foreshadowing a universal commotion, of a
> scope and intensity unparalleled in the annals of mankind.

(MBW 103)

> The violent derangement of the world’s equilibrium; the
> trembling that will seize the limbs of mankind; the radical
> transformation of human society; the rolling up of the
> present-day Order; the fundamental changes affecting the
> structure of government; the weakening of the pillars of
> religion; the rise of dictatorships; the spread of tyranny; the
> fall of monarchies; the decline of ecclesiastical institutions;
> the increase of anarchy and chaos; the extension and con-
> solidation of the Movement of the Left; the fanning into flame
> of the smouldering fire of racial strife; the development of
> infernal engines of war; the burning of cities; the
> contamination of the atmosphere of the earth – these stand
> out as the signs and portents that must either herald or
> accompany the retributive calamity which, as decreed by
> Him Who is the Judge and Redeemer of mankind, must,

\[194\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

sooner or later, afflict a society which, for the most part, and
for over a century, has turned a deaf ear to the Voice of
God’s Messenger in this day – a calamity which must purge
the human race of the dross of its age-long corruptions, and
weld its component parts into a firmly-knit world-embracing
Fellowship – a Fellowship destined, in the fullness of time, to
be incorporated in the framework, and to be galvanized by
the spiritualizing influences, of a mysteriously expanding,
divinely appointed Order, and to flower, in the course of
future Dispensations, into a Civilization, the like of which
mankind has, at no stage in its evolution, witnessed. (MBW
This present Crusade, on the threshold of which we now
stand, will, moreover, by virtue of the dynamic forces it will
release and its wide repercussions over the entire surface of
the globe, contribute effectually to the acceleration of yet
another process of tremendous significance which will carry
the steadily evolving Faith of Bahá’u’lláh through its present
stages of obscurity, of repression, of emancipation and of
recognition – stages one or another of which Bahá’í national
communities in various parts of the world now find
themselves in – to the stage of establishment, the stage at
which the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh will be recognized by the civil
authorities as the state religion, similar to that which
Christianity entered in the years following the death of the
Emperor Constantine, a stage which must later be followed
by the emergence of the Bahá’í state itself, functioning, in all
religious and civil matters, in strict accordance with the laws
and ordinances of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the Most Holy, the
Mother-Book of the Bahá’í Revelation, a stage which, in the
fullness of time, will culminate in the establishment of the
World Bahá’í Commonwealth, functioning in the plenitude of
its powers, and which will signalize the long-awaited advent
of the Christ-promised Kingdom of God on earth – the

> Kingdom of Bahá’u’lláh – mirroring however faintly upon
this humble handful of dust the glories of the Abhá Kingdom.

This final and crowning stage in the evolution of the plan
> wrought by God Himself for humanity will, in turn, prove to
> be the signal for the birth of a world civilization, incom-
> parable in its range, its character and potency, in the history
> of mankind – a civilization which posterity will, with one
> voice, acclaim as the fairest fruit of the Golden Age of the
> Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh, and whose rich harvest will be
> garnered during future dispensations destined to succeed one
> another in the course of the five thousand century Bahá’í
> Cycle. (MBW 155)

N. Sundry compilations of letters to divers national
communities

1\. United Kingdom

This impressive volume of messages, letters and cables of the
Guardian to the Bahá’ís of the British Isles was first published in
1981 under the title of Unfolding Destiny. The title page,
however, gives a fuller designation: The Unfolding Destiny of the
British Bahá’í Community. This compilation runs to over 430
pages of communications dating from 1922 to 1957. The letters
have been arranged in six categories in the following order:

> •   From 1922 to 1944 (the early years)
> •   From 1944 to 1950 (covering the Six Year Plan)
> •   From 1950 to 1953 (the Africa Plan)
> •   From 1953 to 1957 (the Ten Year Crusade)
> •   Letters to Local Assemblies
> •   Excerpts from letters to individuals

These messages show the deep love that Shoghi Effendi
cherished in his heart for the British Bahá’í community. It was to

\[196\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

the United Kingdom that the Master sent his beloved grandson
for study at Oxford; it was there, during his time as a student at
Oxford, that Shoghi Effendi associated with the friends as a
member of their community – the only community of which he
was a member outside the World Centre; and it was in that
selfsame country that he heard about the passing of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, and learned of his appointment as Guardian of the Bahá’í
Faith. The messages abound with praises of the sterling qualities
of the British Bahá’ís and unfold the glorious destiny lying ahead
of them.

The first collective teaching undertaking in the United King-
dom was the Six Year Plan, which was executed and completed
with singular success. It was a Plan which was characterized by
Shoghi Effendi as a ‘signal victory’, which ‘shed lustre on the
opening years of the second Bahá’í century’. The second crown
won by the British Bahá’í community during Shoghi Effendi’s
lifetime was the formulation and execution of the Two Year
Africa Plan. The Guardian singled out the British National
Assembly to be the coordinating body of four other National
Assemblies, to open countries and establish the machinery of the
administration of the Faith in lands south of the Sahara. This plan
likewise ended with resounding success.

A few quotations from this wonderful compilation follow:

> I wish to congratulate in person the English believers, and
> particularly the members of the youth group, on their
> splendid achievements. The activities they have initiated, the
> perseverance, zeal and fidelity they have increasingly
> manifested, the plans they have conceived and the obstacles
> they have already overcome, rejoice my heart and arouse
> fresh hopes and expectations within me. I will continue to
> pray for their success. Rest assured and persevere. (17

October 1936, UD 110–1)

> The marvellous zeal, unity, understanding and devotion
> exemplified by the English believers in recent months,
> individually as well as through their concentrated efforts,
> constitute a landmark in the progressive development of the
> Faith in that land. They who have risen to the height of their
> present opportunities stand at the threshold of unprecedented
> achievements. They must labour continually, exercise the
> utmost vigilance, proclaim courageously, and cling tena-
> ciously to the principles of their Faith, spiritual as well as
> administrative, and resolve to endure every sacrifice and
> hardship, however severe, for the vindication, the consolid-
> ation and recognition of the Faith they profess and are now
> so admirably serving. (27 November 1938, UD 123 )

> The various and compelling evidences of the unquenchable
> enthusiasm, the unbreakable resolution and the inflexible
> purpose of the English believers, in these days of stress, of
> turmoil and danger, have cheered my heart and fortified
> me in the discharge of my arduous and multitudinous duties
> and responsibilities. I feel truly proud of them all, and will,
> with increasing gratitude and redoubled fervour, supplicate
> the Beloved whose Cause they are so valiantly serving, to
> bless, sustain, guide and protect them under all circum-
> stances, and aid them to establish firmly the institutions of
> His Faith throughout the length and breadth of their country.

(7 December 1939, UD 134–5)

> The Bahá’í world, in its entirety, is struck with amazement at

conservative a people, within so short a time, under such
trying circumstances, and by so small a band of workers,
except with feelings compounded of envy, of admiration and
respect. Its sister-communities throughout the East, vener-
able by reason of their age, and the sacrifices they have
made, and fully aware of the long period of incubation this
community has undergone, recall, with feelings of delight,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s prediction, forecasting the germination, at
their appointed time, of the potent seeds His loving hands
have sown in the course of His twice-repeated visit to that
Island, and marvel at the rapidity with which its soil is now
manifesting the potentialities with which it has been en-
dowed. He Who blessed it with His footsteps, Who called into
being, and fostered the growth of, the community labouring
in that Island, hails, from His station on high, the exploits
which immortalise the small band of His present-day
consecrated and resolute followers, who are carrying on the
torch which He Himself had entrusted to their immediate
predecessors. Bahá’u’lláh Himself lauds the conspicuous
victories being won in His Name, in the dawning years of the
Second Bahá’í Century, at the very heart and centre of the
greatest Empire the world has ever seen, whose Sovereign
Monarch He Himself had addressed and whose deeds He,
with His Own pen, had commended. (9 April 1949, UD 226–
On the success of this enterprise [the Africa Plan 1951–3],
unprecedented in its scope, unique in its character and
immense in its spiritual potentialities, must depend the
initiation, at a later period in the Formative Age of the Faith,
of undertakings embracing within their range all National
Assemblies functioning throughout the Bahá’í World,
undertakings constituting in themselves a prelude to the
launching of world-wide enterprises destined to be embarked
upon, in future epochs of that same Age, by the Universal

> House of Justice, that will symbolise the unity and coordinate
and unify the activities of these National Assemblies.

Indeed the birth of this African enterprise, in the opening
> decade of the second Bahá’í century, coinciding as it does
> with the formation of the International Bahá’í Council,
> should be acclaimed as an event of peculiar significance in
> the evolution of our beloved Faith. Both events will, no
> doubt, be hailed by posterity as simultaneous and compelling
> evidences of the irresistible unfoldment of a divinely
> appointed Administrative Order and of the development, on
> an international scale, of its subsidiary agencies, heralding
> the establishment of the Supreme Legislative Body designed
> to crown the Administrative Edifice now being laboriously
> erected by the privileged builders of a Divine Order, whose
> features have been delineated by the Centre of the Covenant
> in His Will and Testament, whose fundamental laws have
> been revealed by the Founder of our Faith in His Kitáb-i-
> Aqdas, and Whose advent has been foreshadowed by the
> Herald of the Bahá’í Dispensation in the Bayán, His most
> weighty Book. (25 February 1951,UD 261)

> That they may ascend from height to height, go forward from

> and whose love and esteem for them has correspondingly
> increased with every revelation of the capacities and
> energies with which they have discharged, and are constantly
> discharging, their Mission. (17 June 1954, UD 340)

2\. Indian subcontinent

A compilation of the letters of Shoghi Effendi to the Indian
subcontinent was published in 1970 under the title of Dawn of a
New Day. It was revised and enlarged in 1995. The new edition
carries the title of Messages of Shoghi Effendi to the Indian
Subcontinent and consists of 580 letters and cables of the
Guardian to the Indian, Pakistani and Burmese Bahá’í
communities. These messages cover some 430 pages.

The Indian subcontinent was opened to the Faith during the
lifetime of Bahá’u’lláh, when He sent a well-known Persian
Bahá’í scholar, Jamál Effendi, to teach the Cause in India and
Burma. It is of interest that one of the Báb’s Letters of the Living
was also Indian in origin. During the Ministry of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
the Master showered the Bahá’ís in these lands with His all-
embracing love, and must have sent the friends over 700 Tablets.
Compared with other communities in the world, apart from
Persia, it may be said that by the time Shoghi Effendi assumed
the Headship of the Faith in 1921, one of its strongholds was the
Indian subcontinent.

The extracts which follow from Shoghi Effendi’s letters
clearly show the degree of joy and pride that he took in the

Indian Bahá’í community, and detail the responsibilities he laid
upon them for the future expansion of the Faith.

> You should concentrate your efforts at the present time on
> whatever will, in your opinion reinforce the basis, and extend
> the influence, of the administrative institutions and the
> teaching activities of the Faith. The Cause will, no doubt,
> surmount the obstacles that now hinder its growth, and will
> establish its ascendency in the fulness of time and at the
> appointed hour. We should persevere and never feel dis-
> heartened. (2 January 1934, MSI 109)

> The friends in India and Burma have made a splendid start.
> They have laid a firm foundation within the framework of the
> administrative order of our Faith. They have weathered
> manifold and distressing difficulties and successfully sur-
> mounted formidable obstacles. A new era is opening before
> them. I have no doubt that they will rise to the height of the
> occasion, and will prove themselves worthy of their high
> destiny. (22 November 1935, MSI 136)

> The progress of the teaching activities initiated by your
> Assembly is highly gratifying. Inflexible determination is
> required to carry it to a successful conclusion. The methods
> adopted by the American Bahá’í community, the zeal, the
> initiative, the efficiency, the fidelity with which they are
> prosecuting their enterprise should be exemplified by indi-
> viduals and Assemblies in India and Burma. The adminis-
> trative machinery which the American believers have erected
> and perfected has already had its counterpart in the
> institutions you have so nobly reared in recent years. Your
> teaching campaign, the supreme purpose for which this
> machinery has been fashioned, should likewise be modelled
> according to the plan which your sister community has

devised and is now developing so strenuously and
successfully. (7 November 1936, MSI 150)

I am delighted to learn of the work which is being steadily
and efficiently accomplished in so many spheres of Bahá’í
activity throughout India and Burma. My heart is filled with
gratitude as I witness the progress you have achieved, the
enterprises you have initiated, the method and measures you
have adopted, the plans you have conceived, and above all,
the spirit of exemplary loyalty and magnificent devotion that
impels you forward in the great mission you are destined to
fulfil. (28 February 1937, MSI 156)

Let them remember that a firm resolution on their part, an
absolute re-dedication of their resources, and an actual
attempt to translate into action their meritorious intentions,
coupled with perseverance in the discharge of their duties,
would suffice to ensure the success of the mission to which
they are now committed. The time is indeed ripe, and the
minds and hearts of the suffering multitudes are being
mysteriously prepared for the Great Message that can alone
redeem, exalt and regenerate a sore tried and bewildered
humanity. I will specially and fervently pray for the suc-
cess of any and every effort the dearly beloved friends in
India and Burma may arise to exert. (28 November 1940,
MSI 191–2)

The vastness of the field, the smallness of your numbers, the
indifference of the masses, must neither discourage nor appal
you. You should at all times fix your gaze on the promise of
Bahá’u’lláh, put your whole trust in His creative Word, re-
call the past and manifold evidences of His all-encompassing
and resistless power, and arise to become worthy and
exemplary recipients of His all-sustaining grace and
blessings. I appeal to every Indian and Burmese believer,

> however modest his position, however limited his knowledge,
> however restricted his means, to rise to the height of this
> great opportunity which if missed will not recur again. To
> disperse, to settle, to teach by word and deed, to persevere
> and sacrifice are the requirements of the present hour (29

June 1941, MSI 203).

> The manner in which the friends have arisen to promote
> the teaching work throughout their country merits the high-
> est praise. By their enthusiasm, their self-abnegation, the
> determination and vigour they display, they have lent a fresh
> impetus to the onward march of the Faith and the expan-
> sion of its institutions and the multiplication of its admin-
> istrative centres. The perils of the present hour, the reper-
> cussions of this tremendous world ordeal on their native
> land, must, in no wise, alarm or discourage them. Their
> purpose must never be deflected, their enthusiasm never
> dimmed, their vision never obscured, their exertions never
> discontinued. Adversity prepares the hearts of men, and
> paves the way for a wholehearted and general acceptance
> of the tenets and claims of our beloved Faith. Challenged
> by the obstacles in their path, encouraged by work already
> initiated, assured of the Divine Promise of Bahá’u’lláh, let
> them forge ahead until their goal is attained. (27 December
> 1941, MSI 211)

> Perseverance is the magnet that will, in these days, attract
> the promised blessings of the almighty Author of our beloved
> Faith. Unity and harmony constitute the basis on which the
> structure of these activities can securely rest. Self-sacrifice,
> audacity, undeviating adherence to the essentials of that

satisfaction to me, and I will continue to supplicate our
Beloved to guide their steps, cheer their hearts, illumine
their understanding, and fulfil their highest and noblest
aspirations. He indeed is well-pleased with the record
of their past services, and will, if they redouble their
efforts, enable them to achieve a signal victory. (27 June
1942, MSI 220)

The call is urgent, the opportunities priceless, the need of the
waiting masses desperate, the machinery for the execution of
the Divine Purpose already erected and vigorously
functioning, the promise of signal victory clear and definite.
A higher degree of administrative efficiency; a closer
collaboration between the various elements constituting the
organic Bahá’í community; a greater measure of self-
sacrifice; a still more intensified exertion aiming at the
consolidation and preservation of the newly constituted
Assemblies and the rapid conversion of the existing groups
into full-fledged Assemblies; a systematic, sustained and
nation-wide endeavour for the purpose of disseminating the
literature of the Faith, increasing its volume and adding to
its diversity, and lastly a more audacious and convincing
presentation of its tenets to the masses of the people, these
constitute the primary tasks facing now the Indian believers.
(20 December 1944, MSI 254)

The hour is indeed propitious. The ordeals and tribulations
which the hungry, the dispossessed, the sick, as well as the
disillusioned and restless multitudes, are now experiencing,
offer the bearers of the Message of the Most Great Name, an
opportunity which may never again recur. There is no time to
lose. Every warrior in the ever-advancing army of Bahá-
’u’lláh must arise and participate in this holy crusade. The
rewards and prizes to be won are inestimable. However
circumscribed its resources, however small its numbers,

> however formidable the obstacles with which it is confronted,
> the entire community of the believers in India, Burma, and
> Pakistan, must arise as one man, and, pledging anew its
> fidelity to its Faith, prove itself fully worthy of the Cause it
> has espoused and the high mission it has undertaken. (24

October 1947, MSI 289)

> The Asiatic continent, the cradle of the principal religions of
> mankind; the home of so many of the oldest and mightiest

3\. Germany and Austria

The National Spiritual Assembly of Germany published two
compilations, in 1982 and 1985 respectively, of letters of the
beloved Guardian to Bahá’í communities and to individual
believers in Germany and Austria. The first volume is in two
parts, from 1922 to 1939, when the Second World War broke
out, and from November 1945 to the end of Shoghi Effendi’s
ministry. A similar pattern is found in volume two of the com-
pilations. The reason for the gap from 1939 to 1945 is, of course,
due to the fact that the Nazi regime had officially banned the
Bahá’í Faith in both Germany and Austria, and all communi-
cations with the World Centre were cut off.

During the last 12 years of his ministry, Shoghi Effendi not
only inspired the scattered Bahá’ís in Germany to resume their
Bahá’í activities, but enabled them to re-form their National
Spiritual Assembly, embark on a teaching plan, and finally
become one of the twelve ‘generals’ of the Ten Year Crusade.
Two of the messages he sent were each nine pages long,
addressed to the National Assembly, and were written during the
Ten Year Plan. Letters to individual believers were shorter and
mostly consisted of encouragement to them in their teaching and
administrative endeavours.

Extracts from these compilations follow below:

> The time is sure to come and the signs are already apparent,
> when the various and distant members of this great world
> community will find their activities co-ordinated, their pur-
> pose unified, their efforts re-inforced and the effect of their
> combined efforts manifest throughout the world. May the
> Power of Bahá’u’lláh breathe the dynamic spirit of Life into
> the combined and systematized efforts of the friends the
> world over and revive through them the body of stricken

> humanity and give it the peace which it yearns for and which
> the world cannot give. (19 January 1923, LDG Vol. 1, 11–2)

> Why fear and sorrow? Have we not the express promise of
> the Master, uttered after the termination of the Great War,
> that Germany, now humbled and weakened, will no doubt be
> freed from its fetters and will develop, materially and
> spiritually, and shall one day emerge from this sad turmoil
> strong, united and prosperous, ready to take her place in the
> great Family of the advanced nations of the world? (16

February 1923, LDG Vol. 1, 12–13)

> Let us then take heart, and endeavour to deepen in spirit, to
> reinforce our numbers, so that, however depressing and
> distracting the conditions around us may be, we may per-
> severe, with clear vision, steadfast hope, and united effort to
> achieve the triumph of the Bahá’í Revelation throughout the
world.

I am eagerly awaiting the news you may wish to send me,
> for I thirst after the glad tidings of the progress of the Cause
> in your mighty and promising land. (31 December 1923,
> LDG Vol. 1, 18)

> I wish to add a few words in person and assure you of my
> keen and heartfelt appreciation of your high and painstaking
> endeavours for the spread and consolidation of the Faith in
> that land. The German believers have undergone tests of
> unprecedented severity. They have weathered the storm in a
> marvellous spirit and with fine and praiseworthy deter-
> mination. These tests were God-sent, and will serve to
> deepen the roots of the Faith in that promising country. (24

February 1932, LDG Vol. 1, 40–1)

> My heart rejoiced and my soul was refreshed at the receipt
> of your most welcome message, signed by so great a number

\[208\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

of ardent and youthful co-workers in a land so rich in
promise, so blessed by our Beloved, and so severely tried
by the vicissitudes of war. You are, I assure you, often in my
thoughts and prayers, and I cherish the brightest hopes for
your future work. You are, I feel confident, destined to
achieve memorable victories, both in your native land and
on the continent of Europe, and you should diligently
and unitedly prepare yourselves for this glorious task.
Persevere, redouble your efforts, and rest assured that the
Beloved will bless and sustain you always. (4 May 1946,
LDG Vol. 1, 106)

The immediate past, with all its confused issues and
unpleasant memories must be entirely forgotten, if the task
that lies ahead is to be efficiently prosecuted. Personal
animosities, suspicions, accusations, wounded pride, contro-
versial issues must all be laid aside. Members of assemblies,
national and local, must be the first to set a worthy example
to their fellow-believers. All thought and discussion must
henceforth centre around the measures required to stimulate
the growth of the Faith, to deepen and enrich the spiritual
life of its members, to familiarize them more intimately with
the character and workings of the Administrative Order, and
enable them to participate more actively in the prosecution of
the Plan to which they are committed. (30 June 1949, LDG
Vol. 1, 155–6)

I appeal to them, with all my heart, to close their ranks,
purge their hearts, broaden their vision, renew their deter-
mination, rededicate themselves to their glorious task, march
resolutely forward along the road traced for them by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, beat down every barrier obstructing their
path, and press on, confidently, unitedly and uncompromis-
ingly, until their goal is attained, and the first stage in the

> evolution of their collective task is brought to a victorious
> conclusion. (30 June 1949, LDG Vol. 1, 156)

> Time is running out. The work they [the German and Austrian
> Bahá’í communities] have to accomplish is immense,
> exacting, thrilling and inescapable. The hosts of the
> Concourse on high will surely lead them onward and assure
> them a resounding victory, if they but keep their vision
> undimmed, if they refuse to faint or falter, if they persevere
> and remain faithful to both the spiritual and the
> administrative principles inculcated by their Faith. (30 May
> 1952, LDG Vol. 1, 186)

> Theirs is a responsibility which, at this historic and crucial
> stage in the evolution of their precious and beloved Faith,
> they can neither minimize nor neglect. Theirs is a God-sent
> opportunity to demonstrate, at this grave hour through which
> the overwhelming majority of their brethren are passing, the
> incorruptible character of their faith, the indomitable spirit
> which animates them, the sublimity of the principles which
> motivate their action, providing thereby an abiding and
> sorely needed consolation to the victims of the brutal, the
> wide spread and repeated persecutions engulfing so many of
> their co-religionists in the cradle of their Faith. (2 August
> 1955, LDG Vol. 1, 240)

4\. Australasia

During the Ministry of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in response to the Tablets
of the Divine Plan, John Henry and Clara Hyde Dunn, Bahá’ís
residing in the United States, arrived in Australia, on 18 April
1920\. Three years later the first Bahá’í Local Assembly was
formed in Melbourne, Victoria under the tutelage of the beloved
Guardian. The National Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Australia
and New Zealand was formed in 1934, and in 1956 New Zealand

\[210\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

was able to establish its own independent National Assembly.
The collection of letters of Shoghi Effendi published in 1970
consists of 82 messages, all of which carried guidance,
encouragement, wise counsel, and assurance of prayers for the
growth of the community in these two significant outposts in the
Antipodes.

Extracts from these messages are included below:

> The detailed report of the activities of the national assembly
> – the furthermost pillar of the Universal House of Justice
> which the high endeavours of the believers of Australia and
> New-Zealand have reared – has filled my heart and soul with
> immense joy and gratitude. The Beloved is surely watching
> over and continually blessing your splendid accomplish-
> ments, the plans you have conceived, the methods you have
> devised, the efforts you are exerting, the services which you
> have rendered. I will continue to pray for the consolidation
> and uninterrupted expansion of your laudable activities in
> the service of so glorious and mighty a Cause. Never relax
> nor despair. The tender plant which your hands have raised
> and nurtured shall grow and will ultimately gather beneath
> its shadow the whole of that far-off and promising continent.

(26 September 1935, LAN 11)

> Effective measures, unprecedented in scope, should be care-
> fully and immediately devised, proclaimed to the believers,
> and, through sustained and organised effort, carried into
> effect. There is no time to lose. The masses, greatly tried by
> the calamities of the age, restless, disappointed, and eager to
> obtain real and complete relief in their hour of trial, hunger
> for the Message of the New Day, and will, if properly
> approached and appealed to, embrace the great verities it
> enshrines. (25 May 1946, LAN 62)

> The limited resources at the disposal of the prosecutors of the
> Plan, the vastness of the territory in which it must operate,
> the fewness of the numbers of those participating in its
> execution, offer a mighty challenge which no loyal follower
> of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh can either ignore or minimize.
> Indeed the greater the challenge, the more bountiful the
> blessings which will be vouchsafed from on high, and the
> richer the reward to be won by its triumphant executors. (11

May 1948, LAN 71)

> It is not for them, however, at the present stage of their
> evolution, to probe into the future, and seek to evaluate the
> range of their future achievements. They must concentrate
> every ounce of their energy, and focus their entire attention,
> on the tasks immediately ahead, resolved to work un-
> remittingly and unflinchingly until the goals of the present
Plan are achieved.

Whatever the situation that may develop in the years to
> come, however great the obstacles by which a nascent
> community may yet be faced, no matter how arduous the task
> now confronting its members, it must persevere until the
historic work is accomplished.

I will, from the depths of my heart, supplicate the Beloved
> to reinforce the noble exertions of this community, guide its
> steps, clarify its vision, deepen its understanding of the
> requirements of the present hour, and aid it to extend
> continually the scope of its meritorious achievements. (11

May 1948, LAN 72)

> Every outward thrust into new fields, every multiplication of
> Bahá’í institutions, must be paralleled by a deeper thrust of
> the roots which sustain the spiritual life of the community

5\. Canada

Canada was opened to the Faith in 1902 by Mrs May Maxwell,
and blessed by the footsteps of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 10 years later.
With its sister national community the United States, it was joint
recipient of the Tablets of the Divine Plan. Shoghi Effendi’s first
letter to the newly-formed Local Spiritual Assembly in Montreal,
dated 2 January 1923, reads: ‘Though its people be firmly
entrenched in their religious sectarianism and strongly attached
to their religious doctrines and traditions, yet who can doubt that
with courage and persistence, kindliness and wisdom, the all-
conquering words of Bahá’u’lláh can fail to break down all these
barriers of prejudice and religious exclusiveness and conquer
this long-standing stronghold of sectarian belief!’ (MC 5).

The first edition of messages to Canada was published in
1965, and had only 30 communications from the Guardian. An
enlarged edition appeared in 1999 and consists of 278 letters and
cables, running to 170 pages. The revised version is divided into
four sections as follows:

> •   From 1923 to 1937 (the early years)
> •   From 1937 to 1948 (first teaching plans)
•   From 1948 to 1953 (emergence as an independent

national community)
•   From 1953 to 1957 (Ten Year Crusade)

The Canadian National Spiritual Assembly was formed in
1948 and by 1953, when the Ten Year Crusade was launched,
had become one of the national pillars of the Administrative
Order. It was thus one of the ‘twelve generals’ of the Ten Year
Plan. The major messages of Shoghi Effendi to Canada were sent
between 1948 and 1957.

Passages from these important letters follow below:

> It behoves us, now that the signs of that glorious and
> promised Day are fast appearing, to arise, with utter
> selflessness, unity and determination, to promote and
> consolidate the Work which He has Himself established in
> the heart of that vast Dominion [Canada], and prove
> ourselves, by our wisdom, moderation, and constancy,
> worthy of the many bestowals He has showered upon us in
> the past. If we but follow in His Way, regard at all times the
> dignity of the Cause, guard sedulously its unity and vital
> principles, and exercise the utmost endeavour to keep its
> Spirit pure, effective and unobscured, then, and only then,
> can we hope to achieve the immediate spread and triumph of
> the Cause. (20 April 1923, MC 9)

> Obstacles, however formidable, will have to be determinedly
> surmounted. Any reverses that sooner or later may be
> suffered should be met with stoic fortitude, and speedily
> offset by victories in other fields. The glorious vision now
> unveiled to your eyes must never be dimmed. The
> illuminating promises enshrined in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablets
> should not be forgotten for a moment. The quality of the
> success already achieved by so small a number, over so
> extensive a field, in so brief a period, at so precarious an
> hour in the destinies of mankind, should spur on the elected
> representatives of this now fully fledged community to
> achieve in as short a period, over still more extensive an
> area, and despite a severer crisis than any as yet

\[214\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

encountered, victories more abiding in their merit and more
conspicuous in their brilliance than any as yet won in the
service and for the glory of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. (4
November 1948, MC 109–10)

As the operation of the Plan gathers momentum the members
of this community must evince a still greater measure of
solidarity, rise to higher levels of heroism, demonstrate a
greater capacity for collective achievement, and attract still
more abundant blessings on the varied enterprises on which
they have embarked. (19 June 1949, MC 114–15)

That this community will never relax in its high endeavours,
that the vision of its glorious mission will not be suffered to
be dimmed, that obstacles, however formidable, will neither
dampen its zeal or deflect it from its purpose, is my confident
hope and earnest prayer. He Who watches over its destinies,
from Whose pen testimonies so significant and soul thrilling
have flowed, will no doubt continue to direct its steps, to
shower upon it His loving bounties, to surround it with His
constant care, and to enable it to scale loftier heights on its
ascent towards the summit of its destiny.

With a heart brimful with gratitude for all that this
community has so far achieved, and throbbing with hope for
the future exploits that will distinguish its record of
stewardship to the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, I pray that by its
acts, this community will prove itself worthy of the trust
confided to its care, and the station to which it has been
called. (23 June 1950, MC 131)

It was a Canadian [Louis Bourgeois], of French extraction,
who through his vision and skill was instrumental in
conceiving the design, and delineating the features, of the
first Mashriqu’l-Adhkár of the West, marking the first
attempt, however rudimentary, to express the beauty which

> Bahá’í art will, in its plenitude, unfold to the eyes of the
> world. It was a Canadian woman [Marion Jack], one of the
> noblest in the ranks of Bahá’í pioneers, who alone and
> single-handed, forsook her home, settled among an alien
> people, braved with a leonine spirit the risks and dangers of
> the world conflict that raged around her, and who now, at an
> advanced age and suffering from infirmities, is still holding
> the Fort and is setting an example, worthy of emulation by all
> her fellow pioneers of both the East and the West. It was a
> member [Rúḥíyyih Khánum] of that same community who
> won the immortal distinction of being called upon to be my
> helpmate, my shield in warding off the darts of Covenant-
> breakers and my tireless collaborator in the arduous tasks I
> shoulder. It was a Canadian subject [May Maxwell], the
> spiritual mother of that same community, who, though fully
> aware of the risks of the voyage she was undertaking,
> journeyed as far as the capital of Argentina to serve a Cause
> that had honoured her so uniquely, and there laid down her
> life and won the everlasting crown of martyrdom. It was,
> moreover, a Canadian [William Sutherland Maxwell] who
> more recently achieved the immortal renown of designing the
> exquisite shell destined to envelop, preserve and embellish
> the holy and priceless structure enshrining the dust of the
> Beloved Founder of our Faith. (1 March 1951, MC 141–2)

> The opportunity given to this Community is precious,
> unutterably precious. The fate of this first historic Plan now
> hangs in the balance. The present chance, if lost, cannot be
> retrieved. The issues on which hinge the successful pro-
> secution of the Plan are so weighty that none can assess them

> its distress for God’s redemptive Message, are growing more
> acute with every passing hour. The Canadian Bahá’í
> Community, newly emerged as an independent member of the
> Bahá’í World Community, so richly blessed through its

\[216\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

elevation to the rank of a chosen prosecutor of a Divine Plan,
unique, in many respects, among its sister communities in
both Hemispheres in the manifold blessings bestowed upon
it, can neither afford to flinch for a moment or hesitate in the
discharge of its sacred duty. Every effort exerted by this
community, during these fate-laden months, every sacrifice
willingly endured by its members, will, if they but persevere,
be richly blessed by Him Who brought it into being, Who
nursed it through His love, Who conferred upon it so
distinguished a Mission, Who made such magnificent
promises regarding its future, and Who will continue to
sustain it through His unfailing, His abounding grace and
favour. (30 October 1951, MC 149)

Inspired by the example and the accomplishments of those of
its members who have distinguished themselves in the Holy
Land, on the European continent and in both the northern
and southern continents of the Western Hemisphere, this
community must forge on, with added determination, with
increasing dedication, with thanksgiving and redoubled zeal,
on the road leading it to a still more glorious destiny in the
years immediately ahead. That it may press forward, conquer
still greater heights, plumb greater depths of consecration,
spread wider and wider the fame of the Cause of God is the
cherished desire of my heart and the object of my constant
supplication. (8 June 1952, MC 160)

May this community march forward on its destined path with
renewed vigour, with undimmed vision, with complete unity,
with utter consecration, and be enabled to play an important
part in the execution of the great tasks ahead, and worthily
contribute to the prodigious efforts now being collectively
exerted by the followers of the Most Great Name, in every
continent of the globe, for the world-wide establishment and

> ultimate triumph of a long-persecuted, divinely impelled,
> world-redeeming Faith. (15 June 1954, MC 208)

> The duties incumbent upon this community, and particularly

6\. New Zealand

This compilation was published in 1982 under the title of
Arohanui. The literal meaning of this Maori word is ‘big love’
(or ‘much and great love’). In the introduction the National
Spiritual Assembly of New Zealand explains that the title also
implies ‘enfolding love’ or ‘that love which builds and carries
forward culture or civilization’.

The compilation consists of 79 letters and cables addressed to
individuals and institutions in New Zealand. These letters are set
out under the following categories:

\[218\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

•   Letters to individuals, June 1923 to April 1926
•   Letters to individuals, August 1926 to September 1933
•   Letters to individuals, June 1934 to January 1955
•   Letters to Bahá’í institutions, March 1926 to September

•   Cables to New Zealand, January 1949 to December 1953
•   Extracts on various subjects

Passages from these messages are included below:

Your letters are always a source of inspiring joy and
stimulating encouragement to me. You are destined to
achieve great things for our beloved Cause and my constant
prayer is that your vision may be clear, your purpose
unshaken, your zeal undiminished, your hopes undimmed.
Let not obstacles and disappointments, which are inevit-
able, dishearten you and whenever you are faced with trials
recall our Beloved’s innumerable sufferings. You certainly
occupy a warm and abiding place in my heart. (12 August
1926, AR 21)

When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says man breaks the laws of nature, He
means we shape nature to meet our own needs, as no animal
does. Animals adapt themselves to better fit in with and
benefit from their environment. But men both surmount and
change environment. Likewise when He says nature is devoid
of memory He means memory as we have it, not the strange
memory of inherited habits which animals so strikingly
possess. (Written on his behalf, 7 June 1946, AR 85)

May the outpourings of the Holy Spirit continue to energise
this small yet resolute forward marching, dedicated com-
munity, and may the outcome of the collective efforts of its
members contribute decisively to the triumphant consum-
mation of the World Crusade on which the entire body of the

> followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh have so confidently
> embarked. (4 April 1957, AR 72)

> All must participate, whether young or old, veterans as well
> as newly enrolled believers, all must contribute their share to
> the ultimate success of this mighty collective enterprise,
> however limited their means, however modest their abilities,
> however restricted the range of their previous experiences.

(27 June 1957, AR 74–5)

7\. Alaska

The National Spiritual Assembly of Alaska, which was formed at
Riḍván of the very year that Shoghi Effendi passed away,
published in 1976 a compilation of his letters to the friends in
Alaska. In the foreword to the book we read the following:
‘[T]his book represents more than a collection of letters from the
Guardian of the Cause of God. It shows his tender, loving hand
as his vision becomes translated into reality, from virgin territory
to teaching area, to pioneer post, to local institutions, to national
institutions. It is a view of the master craftsman, shaping a
sustained pillar of the Universal House of Justice’ (HE viii–ix).

The letters to individual believers are divided into two
sections, one dated 1939 to 1943, and the second 1946 to 1957.
The book also reproduces telegrams to pioneers and letters to
Bahá’í institutions. There are 80 communications from the
Guardian, and an additional 24 messages written on his behalf,
but not included under the section of letters to individuals.

Extracts from this compilation are given below:

> I am thrilled by the news you give me. How proud I feel of
> the spirit that so powerfully animates you. My prayers will, I
> assure you, accompany you on your great and historic
> adventure. Persevere no matter how great the obstacles in

> resolve and will richly bless your endeavours. Be happy and
> confident. (HE 4)

> Your letter cheered and heartened me in the conduct of my
> arduous duties and responsibilities. I rejoice to learn of your
> high endeavours in that distant field, and I will specially pray
> with increasing fervour for your protection and success. How

> most cherished desire. (HE 38)

8\. Japan

The first compilation of Shoghi Effendi’s messages to Japan was
published in 1974 under the title of Japan Will Turn Ablaze. It
was revised and enlarged in 1992. The revised version begins

with copies of Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Miss Agnes Alexander
as well as to Japanese Bahá’ís. This is followed by the major
portion of the book, which includes 103 letters and cables of the
Guardian, arranged in the following order:

> •   46 letters and cables to Miss Agnes Alexander
> •   11 letters and cables to the Bahá’ís of Japan
> •   2 letters and cables to institutions
•   5 letters and cables to the National Assembly of North-

East Asia, with its seat in Japan

These communications from the Guardian quite often remind
the friends of the promises given by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá of the
glorious services that are in store for Japanese believers and the
high standards of sustained, vigorous and dedicated effort
expected of them in promoting the interests of God’s Holy Faith.

Some extracts follow:

> Now if ever is the time for you and for us to show, by our
> unity, service, steadfastness and courage, the spirit that
> the Master has throughout His lifetime so laboriously, so
> persistently kindled in our hearts. Now is the time for us to
> prove ourselves worthy of His love for us, His trust in us
> and His hopes for us. Japan, He said, will turn ablaze. Let
> us not, in any way, whatsoever, retard the realization of
> His promise. Nay, let us hasten, through our service, coope-
> ration and efforts the advent of this glorious day. (26 January
> 1922, JTA 73)

> Your letters have gladdened my heart and fortified me in my
> task. I will continue to supplicate for you at His Shrine, that
> He may graciously assist you to make of those who are
> merely interested, active supporters of the Faith, recognizing
> fully the significance and station of Bahá’u’lláh, and who
> will form a nucleus of believers who will carry on the work,

\[222\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

loyally and effectively after you and in your absence. This is
my fervent prayer for you. (21 December 1928, JTA 59)

Your past and present services are engraved upon my heart.
The Beloved is well-pleased with your constancy, your zeal
and exemplary devotion. I am proud of the spirit that so
powerfully animates you in His service. I will continue to
pray for your success from the bottom of my heart. Rest
assured and persevere. (23 September 1935, JTA 64)

Bahá’u’lláh wrote, many, many years ago: ‘The vitality of
men’s belief in God is dying out in every land; nothing short
of His wholesome medicine can ever restore it. The corrosion
of ungodliness is eating into the vitals of human society; what
else but the Elixir of His potent Revelation can cleanse and
revive it?’

This is the ebb of the tide. The Bahá’ís know that the tide
will turn and come in, after mankind has suffered, with
mighty waves of faith and devotion. The people will enter the
Cause of God in troops, and the whole condition will change.
The Bahá’ís see this new condition which will take place, as
one on the mountain-top sees the first glimpse of the dawn,
before others are aware of it; and it is toward this that the
Bahá’ís must work. (Written on his behalf, 5 October 1953,
JTA 102)

. . . The emergence of a new Regional Spiritual Assembly in
the North Pacific Area [National Spiritual Assembly of North
East Asia, with its seat in Tokyo, Japan] . . . may be said to
have, at long last, established a spiritual axis, extending from
the Antipodes to the northern islands of the Pacific Ocean –
an axis whose northern and southern poles will act as power-
ful magnets, endowed with exceptional spiritual potency, and
towards which younger and less experienced communities
will tend for some time to gravitate. (19 July 1957, JTA 89)

> racial and political antagonisms, the close and continued
> association of these communities . . . is a matter of vital and
> urgent importance, which should receive on the part of the
> elected representatives of their communities, a most earnest
> and prayerful consideration . . . (19 July 1957, JTA 89)

O. Letters written on behalf of the Guardian by his
secretaries

When mail was received by Shoghi Effendi, it was his practice to
open the letters himself, just in case the material submitted to
him was confidential. He would then decide whether to send the
answer over his own signature, or use one of his secretaries to
convey his thoughts on his behalf. This method was followed in
respect to both the East and the West.

The secretaries who served him in this capacity for the
correspondence from the West were as follows: Ethel Rosenberg,
Dr J.E. Esslemont, Rouhanguiz Rabbani (his sister), Ruhi Afnan,
‘Azízu’lláh Bahádur, Soheil Afnan, Hussein Rabbani (his
brother), Amatu’l-Bahá Rúḥíyyih Khánum, the Hands of the
Cause in the Holy Land, the International Bahá’í Council, and
Leroy Ioas. The secretaries for the East, writing most of the time
in Persian, and at times in Arabic, were as follows: Maḥmúd
Zarqání, ‘Azízu’lláh Bahádur, Núri’d-Dín Zayn, ‘Alí-Asghar
Qazvíní (only for correspondence with local believers and
neighbouring localities in Jordan) and Dr Lotfu’llah Hakim.

These secretaries were not all serving him at the same time;
their names have been given on a chronological basis as they

\[224\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

succeeded one another. The secretaries who served him for his
English correspondence were normally accessible to him in
person, but for the secretaries for the East, particularly in the
case of Mr Zayn, who lived at a distance from the Master’s
house, he would instead convey his instructions in writing.

When the instructions were given, the secretaries would for
the most part take notes, especially if the answer was not to be a
brief one. Drafts would then be made by the secretary concerned,
and the letter submitted to the Guardian for verification. If, in
any given case, the Guardian did not approve the drafted letter, it
would be sent back to the secretary with renewed instructions. If
he felt that the draft was acceptable, he would, in rare cases, send
it without any further additions, but in the majority of cases
would append a postscript followed by his signature.

He would normally also add a closing phrase to the letter. For
the East it was invariably ‘The servant of His Threshold’. When
he first used this expression, soon after the passing of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, it was clear from the context that the possessive pronoun,
‘His’, referred to the Master. After the phrase he would sign his
name, ‘Shoghi’. As to his correspondence with the West, various
forms were used in the early years, such as:

> Your sincere co-worker in His Cause
> Your brother and co-worker in His Cause
> Your brother and co-worker
> I am, as ever, you brother in His Service
> I am your devoted brother
> I am your brother and fellow-worker
> Your brother in His Service
> I am your brother and co-worker
> Your brother

Towards the end of 1923, he finally settled on ‘Your true
brother’, followed by his signature. In certain cases, when he felt
that the recipient, whether an institution or an individual, had

accomplished services that called for his special appreciation, the
final greeting would be, ‘Your true and grateful brother’.

In one of his letters, he assures the questioner of his close
examination of the letters written on his behalf prior to sending
them to their recipients: ‘Concerning letters from Haifa.
Whatever letters are sent in my behalf from Haifa are all read
and approved by me before mailing. There is no exception
whatever to this rule’ (PBA 87).

In the light of the above extract, it has become the policy of
the Archives Office to receive and preserve not only letters and
other communications composed by Shoghi Effendi himself, but
also all letters written on his behalf to the East and to the West.

Q. Will all people become Bahá’ís in the future?

A. There is no reference in the writings stating that every single
person will become Bahá’í, but at least half of them will.
Rúḥíyyih Khánum used to say that Shoghi Effendi was asked this
question quite often by pilgrims. He would answer by saying
that, in this Dispensation, the totality of the peoples of the world
will not become Bahá’ís, but the majority will.

Q. How can we explain sensitively to a seeker that the future
World Order will have international institutions, which will
govern the whole world in a just and fair way, but whose
members will be only Bahá’ís? How can we then explain that
the Faith accepts and embraces all religions?

A. In the writings of Shoghi Effendi about the future, there are
two different sets of global institutions that are described. One
set can be found in ‘The Goal of a New World Order’, the other
in ‘The Unfoldment of World Civilization’. In the former, he
describes the institutions as a world superstate. In the latter, he
describes the institutions of the Bahá’í World Commonwealth.

The world superstate will be a separate political system.

Parallel with this system, the Bahá’í Administrative Order will
also function. The two systems will not yet have merged. This
will be a perfected, a consolidated, and a spiritually oriented
system of the Lesser Peace. Subsequently, these two structures
will progress until they will both join together, forming the
Bahá’í World Commonwealth, which will usher in the Most
Great Peace.

In ‘The Goal of a New World Order’, Shoghi Effendi lists the
institutions that will exist at the time of the world superstate. He
writes ‘Such a state will have to include within its orbit an

International Executive adequate to enforce supreme and
unchallengeable authority on every recalcitrant member of the
commonwealth; a World Parliament whose members shall be
elected by the people in their respective countries and whose
election shall be confirmed by their respective governments; and
a Supreme Tribunal whose judgment will have a binding effect
even in such cases where the parties concerned did not volun-
tarily agree to submit their case to its consideration’ (WOB 40–
1). When you compare this to the list of institutions that will
exist during the Bahá’í World Commonwealth, we notice that,
although the executive, the legislative and judicial branches are
mentioned, their order has changed. He writes, ‘This common-
wealth must, as far as we can visualize it, consist of a world
legislature, whose members will, as the trustees of the whole of
mankind, ultimately control the entire resources of all the
component nations, and will enact such laws as shall be required
to regulate the life, satisfy the needs and adjust the relationships
of all races and peoples. A world executive, backed by an
international Force, will carry out the decisions arrived at, and
apply the laws enacted by, this world legislature, and will
safeguard the organic unity of the whole commonwealth. A world
tribunal will adjudicate and deliver its compulsory and final
verdict in all and any disputes that may arise between the
various elements constituting this universal system’ (WOB 203).
In this case, the legislative body is before the executive body.

We must be aware that the world superstate will not be a
Bahá’í system. There may be Bahá’ís involved in it, but its
operation, as far as we can visualize, will be inspired by the
Bahá’í system.

There is nothing in the writings to say that those who occupy
positions in all branches of the Commonwealth should be
Bahá’ís. The world legislature in the Bahá’í World Common-
wealth, however, will be the Universal House of Justice, which
Shoghi Effendi has called the ‘supreme organ of the Bahá’í
Commonwealth’, and its members must be Bahá’ís. This does

\[228\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

not necessarily apply to the other two branches. The members of
the executive and judicial branches may well be non-Bahá’ís.
The only strict requirement is that the members of the Universal
House of Justice must be Bahá’ís.

Q. Could you please clarify what was going to be the function
of the Bahá’í Court in the Holy Land that was to be
established as one of the objectives of the Ten Year Crusade?
Do you think that such a Court will be created in the future,
if conditions permit?

A. A short introduction is necessary to understand the question.
Shoghi Effendi, towards the end of 1950, appointed a body of
men and women to support him in his work. He named this
institution the International Bahá’í Council. He assigned the
members of the International Bahá’í Council such duties as
forging ties with the government of the newly emerged state of
Israel, helping him in the construction of the Báb’s Shrine, and
conducting negotiations with the civil authorities about the
possibility of Bahá’í laws of personal status being officially
recognized in the Holy Land. Shoghi Effendi explained that the
appointed International Bahá’í Council would pass through
several stages in its evolution. The appointed Council was to
become an appointed International Bahá’í Court. The appointed
Court would cease to exist, and then the Universal House of
Justice would be elected. That was his outline of its
development.

In 1953, as soon as he included the formation of a Bahá’í
Court in the goals of the Ten Year Crusade, Shoghi Effendi
immediately started working on it. He sent the members of the
appointed Council to Jerusalem, back and forth, to investigate
whether this was possible or not. The report was negative. The
Hands of the Cause of God have referred to this in a book called
The Ministry of the Custodians 1957–1963, compiled by
Rúḥíyyih Khánum. In their letter, the Hands of the Cause of God

wrote that Shoghi Effendi had indicated that this goal might not
be achieved, because the country was becoming secular and the
government was not in favour of giving further powers to
religious courts. The government intended to gradually phase out
the religious courts and replace them with secular civil courts.

The Hands of the Cause decided that they would have to
make arrangements for the election of the Universal House of
Justice in 1963, since Shoghi Effendi had clearly indicated this in
his writings. They came to the conclusion that the best way to
handle this was to have the appointed Council become an elected
Council and then to ask the elected Council to continue its
negotiations about the Court. Despite the fact that Shoghi Effendi
indicated that it was most unlikely for that goal of the Ten Year
Crusade to be fulfilled, they did not stop pursuing it.

To set up the election of the Council, the Hands of the Cause
of God issued a letter to all National Spiritual Assemblies stating
that it was not necessary to come to the Holy Land for the
election. Instead, the members of the National Spiritual Assem-
blies that were elected in 1960 were asked to send their ballots
by mail to the World Centre, for nine people, men or women, to
become members of the elected International Bahá’í Council.
They further stated that the Hands of the Cause should not be
considered for election as they were wholly occupied with the
Ten Year Crusade. The election took place and a new body was
created – the elected International Bahá’í Council. One of the
duties that the Hands of the Cause gave to this International
Bahá’í Council was to continue the work of investigating the
possibility of establishing a Bahá’í Court in the Holy Land. The
members had to bear in mind that Shoghi Effendi had repeatedly
said that we would have a religious court on one condition only:
it should have the same rights as the other religious courts, as the
Bahá’ís should have equal status with the Jews, the Christians
and the Muslims in the country. If we weren’t given equal status,
we wouldn’t accept. The members of the elected International
Council started going to Jerusalem. They must have gone about

\[230\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

20 times to meet with different ministers, the Prime Minister, and
the President. However, it was not possible to establish a Bahá’í
Court that would have equal rights with the others. Shoghi
Effendi had been correct in his anticipation of this outcome, and
so this goal remained unfulfilled. However, this does not mean
that we have given up. If at any time it would be possible to do
so, no doubt the Universal House of Justice will take action.

It is important to know that Shoghi Effendi made it clear to
the Hands of the Cause residing in the Holy Land that the antici-
pated Court, if it was established, would not have jurisdiction
over National Spiritual Assemblies. It would be a local institu-
tion just for Israel, concerned with the recognition of the Bahá’í
laws of personal status. It was called the International Court
because it was to be located at the World Centre of the Faith.

During the time when Israel was a British mandated territory,
Shoghi Effendi had won recognition from the authorities for the
Bahá’í marriage ceremony, and the government of Israel still
honours this recognition. There are other laws of personal status
which have not yet been recognized, such as the laws related to
divorce and inheritance. There is an excellent statement pub-
lished in The Bahá’í World, Volume XIII, which gives a full and
authoritative treatment of the question.

Q. What is the role of the nine Israel Branches of National
Spiritual Assemblies?

A. Shoghi Effendi wanted the Bahá’í properties and Shrines to
be held in the names of Bahá’í institutions rather than
individuals. He himself embodied an institution, the Guardian-
ship, but he didn’t want the properties to be held in his name.
Therefore, he would establish in Israel a society, with a secretary
and a chairman, which would be named as the Israel Branch of a
National Spiritual Assembly. He started this practice during the
British mandate, and at that time they were called Palestine
Branches. The very first body that was established as a branch in

Palestine was the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of
the United States and Canada – Palestine Branch. It had some
very simple by-laws, about five or six items, that the lawyer was
able to draw up for Shoghi Effendi. It had a chairman and a
secretary. The signed chairman was Shoghi Rabbani. The signed
secretary was his own secretary. It was accepted, and the
property was transferred to this particular society. When Israel
came into existence, it became the Israel Branch. Later, more
National Spiritual Assemblies were added and more properties
were registered in the names of these Branches.

The Universal House of Justice has continued the same
process and it is hoped that, in the future, more properties
belonging to the Bahá’í Community in Israel will be transferred
in the names of Branches of other National Spiritual Assemblies.
Indeed, Shoghi Effendi has written that, not only will the Bahá’í
properties of the World Centre be transferred to branches of
different National Spiritual Assemblies, but important Bahá’í
holy places throughout the world, particularly in Iran, will
eventually be transferred to these Branches. Take for example
the site of the martyrdom of the Báb. Instead of being registered
only in the name of the National Spiritual Assembly of Iran it
will become an international endowment and registered in the
name of maybe one or more Iranian Branches of different
National Spiritual Assemblies.

Q. Today the Universal House of Justice is the Head of the
Faith, and fulfils legislative, executive and judicial functions.
When the stage of the Bahá’í World Commonwealth is
attained, what will be the function of the Universal House of
Justice? What is it that will protect this unique Order from
degenerating into any form of despotism, oligarchy or
demagogy?

A. Today, not only the Universal House of Justice, but the
National Spiritual Assemblies and Spiritual Assemblies also

\[232\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

fulfil legislative, executive and judicial functions. However, this
will change in the future. Eventually, I think, at all levels, the
executive and judicial functions will be given to other
institutions. The Universal House of Justice will have to decide
how this should be done.

One day, when I was on pilgrimage, Shoghi Effendi was
talking about some similar subject. He drew my attention to a
statement made by Bahá’u’lláh that ‘All matters of State should
be referred to the House of Justice’ (TB 129).

The second part of the question deals with the promise that
Shoghi Effendi has given us in ‘The Dispensation of
Bahá’u’lláh’: ‘[T]his unique Order, however long it may endure
and however extensive its ramifications, cannot ever degenerate
into any form of despotism, of oligarchy, or of demagogy which
must sooner or later corrupt the machinery of all man-made and
essentially defective political institutions’ (WOB 154). The
guarantee is the Covenant. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was the Centre of the
Covenant. Shoghi Effendi was the Centre of the Cause, and
today the Focal Point of the Cause is the Universal House of
Justice. You will never find this term, the Centre of the Cov-
enant, applied by the Universal House of Justice to itself or even
to the Guardian. Other terms are used, such as Head of the Faith,
Central Institution of the Faith, Pivot of the Faith, Central Pivot
of the Faith, or Focal Point of the Covenant, but the term Centre
of the Covenant is reserved for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The Covenant of
God is the instrument that Bahá’ulláh has Himself created, not
only for the ministry of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, but for posterity. Shoghi
Effendi has written: ‘The Covenant designed to safeguard the
unity and integrity of its world-embracing system had been
irrevocably bequeathed to posterity’ (GPB 223). We are now
living under the shadow of the Covenant. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refers to
the period of His own ministry as the morning of the Covenant.
We are still situated in the early hours of the morning of the
Covenant. The Covenant is going to continue throughout the
Day, ‘the Day which shall not be followed by night’ (GPB 245).

This is the guarantee! The finger of God is on the Central
Institution of the Faith, which today is the Universal House of
Justice. The guarantee is our love for Bahá’u’lláh, our love for
the Covenant, and our conviction of its validity. It is the power of
the Covenant which protects the Bahá’í Administrative Order
from the degeneration suffered by all other institutions.

Q. ‘Will America allow any of her sister communities in East
or West to achieve such ascendancy as shall deprive her of that
spiritual primacy with which she has been invested and which
she has thus far so nobly retained?’ (WOB 94). Is this just
rhetoric? Do you think that Shoghi Effendi really considered
the possibility that one of the European communities would
surpass the United States? What about the other countries in
the world, such as India, Colombia, Iran, etc.?

A. My own personal feeling about this is that Shoghi Effendi was
endeavouring to stimulate the Bahá’ís of the United States to
fully assume the primacy that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had conferred upon
the American community. Just before this, he refers to the
destiny of America in these words: ‘Great indeed have been your
past and present achievements! Immeasurably greater are the
wonders which the future has in store for you!’ (WOB 94).

He is talking about the standard which, if ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
wishes are to be fulfilled, must be raised in America. It has not
yet been unfurled. I think he was pricking and nudging the
American Bahá’í community to wake up and assume its God-
given responsibilities. However, no one really knows what the
future has in store. It would be a great tragedy to the American
Bahá’í community if it fails in future years to assume the grave
responsibility laid upon it by the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. Let
us hope that the American Bahá’ís will continue to succeed in
their efforts.

\[234\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

Q. ‘To attempt to visualize, even in its barest outline, the glory
that must envelop these institutions, to essay even a tentative
and partial description of their character or the manner of
their operation, or to trace however inadequately the course of
events leading to their rise and eventual establishment is far
beyond my own capacity and power’ (TDH 46). Is this just
rhetoric? Are we to honestly believe that Shoghi Effendi, the
sign of God, didn’t have the power to tell us about these
things?

A. To fully understand this sentence one has to read the previous
paragraph. He says ‘these institutions’. Which institutions?
Certainly they are not the institutions of the current Admin-
istrative Order, nor are they institutions which we are to see
emerging over the next 100 or 200 years. Shoghi Effendi wrote
that the Guardianship enabled the Faith ‘to take a long, an
uninterrupted view over a series of generations’ (WOB 148).
Therefore, I do not think that these institutions lie within that
period of time that he could foresee. He was talking about the
institutions mentioned in the previous paragraph: ‘those world-
shaking, world-embracing, world-directing administrative insti-
tutions, ordained by Bahá’u’lláh and anticipated by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, and which are to function in consonance with the
principles that govern the twin institutions of the Guardianship
and the Universal House of Justice’ (TDH 46). In my opinion, he
was referring to the institutions of the Bahá’í World
Commonwealth. He was not speaking about the time of the
Lesser Peace, or of the Great Peace, but of the Most Great Peace.

During the Great Peace there will be, basically, a non-sacred
superstate. The institutions of the Faith will not yet have the
opportunity to exercise direct influence on the condition of the
world, but they will do it indirectly, through the inspiration they
will give to the superstate. During the Most Great Peace the
institutions of the Faith will effectively be world-shaking, world-
embracing and world-directing. This is when the words, ‘The

world’s equilibrium hath been upset through the vibrating
influence of this most great, this new World Order’ (KA ¶181)
will have become a reality. We are assured that a world
civilization is going to emerge, by virtue of the impact of ‘this
wondrous System – the like of which mortal eyes have never
witnessed’ (KA ¶181). Shoghi Effendi is telling us that even he
could not fully visualize the wonder and glory of that
civilization.

Q. Bahá’ís are allowed to vote in certain elections, for
example, those which do not require them to identify them-
selves with a political party. How should we view an election
where you cannot, technically, give your vote to an
individual, only to a political party? Would it make any
difference if each party had only one candidate (e.g. for
President), so that by voting for a particular party one is, in
effect, voting for a particular individual?

A. You are living in a world submerged in politics and
propaganda. It is vital for you to know the Bahá’í position on
politics. There is a text from Shoghi Effendi, which we must call
to mind: ‘Let them refrain from associating themselves, whether
by word or by deed, with the political pursuits of their respective
nations, with the policies of their governments and the schemes
and programs of parties and factions . . . I am firmly convinced,
their first and sacred obligation [is] to abstain from any word or
deed that might be construed as a violation of this vital
principle’ (WOB 64).

Whenever there is uncertainty about what you are permitted
to do in your particular country, it should be referred to your
National Spiritual Assembly. The National Spiritual Assembly
will deliberate on it. If it thinks that casting such a vote is
obviously not an act of political involvement, then it will give
you the green light. However, if there is some chance that such
an act would give the impression that the Bahá’ís had become

\[236\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

involved in politics, it would advise you accordingly. The final
word on the matter is that Bahá’ís should not only avoid
interfering in matters that are obviously political, but they should
also avoid activities that could be construed as political.

Q. Could you elaborate a little on the fall of Shi’ah Islam, of
the Qájár dynasty and of the Sunni Caliphs in
Constantinople, and on the rampant rise of secularism in the
East?

A. Obviously the situation in many countries in the world will
fluctuate. At the time when Shoghi Effendi was writing his
World Order letters and The Promised Day is Come, the Shah of
Iran was trying to suppress the clergy there. He wanted to follow
the example of Ataturk, who had declared that Turkey had
become a secular state, as it still is today. The Shah of Iran also
hoped to separate the church from the state. We see today,
however, that, far from being suppressed, the Shi’ih clergy have
now become the government in Iran. We must take into
consideration the fact that there will be fluctuations in the
situation of the country.

At the end of chapter 2 of God Passes By, Shoghi Effendi
describes this process, which began when Ṭáhíríh lifted her veil
at Badasht. ‘[T]his process of disintegration, associated with the
declining fortunes of a superannuated, though divinely revealed
Law, . . . is destined to culminate in the secularization of the
Muslim states, and in the universal recognition of the Law of
Bahá’u’lláh by all the nations, and its enthronement in the hearts
of all the peoples, of the Muslim world’ (GPB 34).

As I understand it, this means that whatever the current
situation might be in Iran and in the Muslim East, the long-term
development will be that secular states are destined eventually to
replace Islamic states.

Q. As I understand it, Mu%ammad established in Medina the
precedent of the modern state, with a triple separation of
powers: executive, legislative and judicial. Yet, we read in
many history books that the modern state has its origins in
the traditional monarchies of fifteenth-century Europe. What
is the relationship between the state, as conceived by
Mu%ammad, and the modern state?

A. Patriotism, as well as the concept of nationhood, has its origin
in the Islamic Dispensation. However, this is a vast subject, so I
will just give my own very limited understanding of it.

First of all, the state that was established by Muḥammad did
not have three branches, legislative, executive and judicial. The
first part of the period of the ministry of Muḥammad was in
Mecca. The situation was quite similar to the three years of the
ministry of Jesus Christ. From 610, when He declared His
Mission, to 622, Muḥammad and His followers were persecuted
and opposed. In 622, after 12 years of suffering, Muḥammad’s
enemies conceived a plot to assassinate Him. Therefore, He and
His followers took flight from Mecca and went to Medina, where
there were some people who were well disposed towards Islam.

During the first two years in Medina, Muḥammad, for the
first time, had some peace of mind. After the first two years,
there was an attack from the people of Mecca, from His own
tribe, the Quraysh. Muḥammad saw that if He did not now stand
before them and defend Himself as well as His own community,
they would all be assassinated. So, at such a time, he raised the
call of jihad, which is holy war. This war was purely defensive,
because they were being attacked. The first battle marked the
beginning of a six-year period of war between Mecca and
Medina. Eventually, the Islamic army won and entered into
Mecca. This was two years before the passing of Muḥammad.
During these two years, He tried to establish order in the land.
When the other tribes in Arabia saw that the powerful Quraysh
tribe had been defeated, they too accepted Islam. This is how

\[238\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

Arabia as a nation came into existence. ‘Love of one’s country is
an element of the Faith of God’ is a statement attributed to
Muḥammad in one of the well-recognized traditions. In other
words, patriotism is an element of religion. This was because,
under His rule, the whole of Arabia was united. He tried to
establish some form of government, but it certainly didn’t
involve the triple separation of powers. He appointed people to
act as governors in different parts of the country. They were His
representatives, and if there was any problem in one of the
localities, they could resolve it or appoint another person to do so
on their behalf.

It was because of this well-recognized tradition, ‘Love of
one’s country is an element of the Faith of God’, that Shoghi
Effendi was moved to write ‘The conception of nationality, the
attainment to the state of nationhood, may, therefore, be said to
be the distinguishing characteristics of the MuJammadan
Dispensation, in the course of which the nations and races of the
world, and particularly in Europe and America, were unified and
achieved political independence’ (PDC 196). Before Islam there
were, however, empires. Empire-building was and had been the
order of the day, and it flourished under the Persians, the Greeks
and Romans, then the Christian, Islamic and European empires,
and so on throughout past centuries. But empire-building has, in
this Age, come to a complete end. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá referred to unity
in freedom. The Universal House of Justice has shed some
illumination on this subject in Century of Light, ‘Among the
chief developments giving substance to it, the Master may well
have had in mind the dramatic extinction of colonialism and the
consequent rise of self-determination as a dominant feature of
national identity at century’s end’ (CL 129).

Q. Do you think that there will be crisis and victory in the
Golden Age?

A. I am not a prophet, so I don’t really know. However, I don’t
think there will be a chain of crises, as we know them today. It
will be victory after victory. The crises today involve persecution
and opposition to the Faith, such as banning the administration,
demolition of Holy Places, confiscating properties and assets,
martyrdom, imprisonment, ostracism etc. This sort of crisis will
not exist because the Faith will be the established religion of the
planet. There may, however, be other kinds of tests and trials that
we cannot possibly imagine now.

Q. Could you please tell us a little bit more about the
secretaries of the Guardian? How many of them remained
loyal?

A. I will start with the secretaries for the West. Ethel Rosenberg
remained firm to the very end. She was a British Bahá’í, who had
been taught the Faith by Mrs Maxwell. She was very devoted to
Shoghi Effendi and helped him in the work of revising his
translations in the early years of his Guardianship. She remained
firm to the very end. Dr Esslemont, likewise, remained firm in
the Covenant. He was posthumously appointed Hand of the
Cause of God. He wrote the book Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era
and he served for a time as Shoghi Effendi´s secretary.
Rouhangiz Rabbani, the sister of Shoghi Effendi, became a
Covenant-breaker with the rest of the family. Ruhi Afnan was a
cousin of Shoghi Effendi. The mother of Shoghi Effendi,
Ḍíyá’íyyih Khánum, had a sister, and that sister was the mother
of Ruhi Afnan. Ruhi Afnan and his mother both broke the
Covenant. ‘Azízu’lláh Bahádur was a Persian Bahá’í from Shiraz
and he was well versed in Persian literature. He had beautiful
handwriting. He also had studied at the American University of
Beirut and knew very good English, enabling him to serve as a
secretary for the West as well as a secretary of the East. He broke
the Covenant as well. Soheil Afnan was the brother of Ruhi
Afnan. He too broke the Covenant. Hussein Rabbani was Shoghi

\[240\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

Effendi’s brother. He broke the Covenant as well. Thank God,
this ended the line of the Covenant-breaker secretaries.

Then we had a new set of secretaries. Amatu’l-Bahá
Rúḥíyyih Khánum, whom you all know. The Hands of the Cause
in the Holy Land: there were four of them: Amatu’l-Bahá
Rúḥíyyih Khánum, Amelia Collins, Leroy Ioas and Charles
Mason Remey. Mason Remey later broke the Covenant, but the
body of the Hands did not break the Covenant. Shoghi Effendi
used this group of four Hands to convey his thoughts and his
instructions to the Hands of the Cause throughout the world, and
all four of them would sign the letters. The International Bahá’í
Council was also used by Shoghi Effendi as a vehicle to convey
his instructions to National Spiritual Assemblies and individual
believers, especially pioneers. That was an appointed institution
and Leroy Ioas was its Secretary-General. These letters would be
written on paper bearing the International Bahá’í Council
letterhead. Leroy Ioas also wrote letters on his own, not in his
capacity as Secretary-General of the International Bahá’í
Council, but as an assistant secretary to the Guardian. These
were written on paper bearing Shoghi Effendi’s letterhead.
Rúḥíyyih Khánum was the main English secretary of Shoghi
Effendi. She herself had an assistant typist, called Ethel Revell.

Now we come to the secretaries of the East. Maḥmúd
Zarghání was a wonderful Bahá’í, who remained firm and
constant till the very end. ‘Azízu’lláh Bahádur has already been
mentioned. Núri’d-Dín Zayn died in Beirut, and, thank God, he
was under the shadow of the Covenant. ‘Alí-Asghar Qazvíní was
a beautiful soul and Shoghi Effendi loved him very much. He
was living in the basement of the house of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in
Haifa. He was only used for correspondence with local believers
and neighbouring localities in Jordan. There was a community in
Jordan known as ‘Adasíyyih. They were Bahá’ís from Yazd who
had gone there in order to be farmers. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had bought
some land in that village and this land needed to be cultivated, so
He encouraged Bahá’ís from Yazd, who knew about farming, to

settle on this property in ‘Adasíyyih and to develop it. The
correspondence with ‘Adasíyyih was mostly through this dear
Bahá’í, ‘Alí-Asghar Qazvíní. Finally, Dr Lotfu’llah Hakim was
the secretary for the East on the International Bahá’í Council. He
remained firm in the Covenant and was elected to the first
Universal House of Justice.

Q. What did the Nazis do to the Bahá’ís in Germany and
Austria? What was their motivation for this?

A. The Nazi regime’s policy was to exterminate the Jews, and
there were quite a few Bahá’ís in Germany and Austria who
were of Jewish background. Furthermore, the principles of the
Faith, such as unity in diversity, were directly in opposition to
the fascist ideology of the Nazis. They couldn’t tolerate the
existence of an organization which so readily accepted people of
all races into its ranks. Hitler especially didn’t want Jews to
escape persecution by changing their religion, so he outlawed the
Bahá’í Faith. There had been a National Assembly for Germany
and Austria and it was forced to disband in 1939.

The Bahá’ís were prevented from having any form of activity
or meeting until the end of the war. It took a whole year, from
1945 to 1946, for the German Bahá’í community to be resuscit-
ated. Particular credit must go the American Bahá’í community
for the work it did in Germany after the war. As soon as the
community was back on its feet, Shoghi Effendi gave it a
teaching plan. The Bahá’ís really leaped back into action, moved
on, and won their goals.

Q. What is meant by the City of the Covenant?

A. The ‘City of the Covenant’ refers to New York, because, as
far as the West was concerned, it was in New York that ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá first declared His own station as the Centre of the

\[242\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

Covenant. The circumstances are described in Century of Light,
page 26.

Q. I can see the integrative process in the world today, for
example, the way in which the principles of Bahá’u’lláh are
gaining greater acceptance among all kinds of people. This is
speeding up day by day. However, the disintegrative process
doesn’t seem to be progressing. Did it not reach its peak
during the lifetime of the Guardian? Aren’t things a lot
better now than before, generally speaking?

A. The process of disintegration did not reach its nadir in the
years of the Guardianship. There has been a definite and obvious
recrudescence of religious prejudice. Fundamentalism is on the
rise. There are now more mullas than ever who preach a kind of
radical Islam. Fundamentalism can also be seen in the ranks of
Christianity, especially in North America.

This disintegration is not going to have a serious negative
effect on the integrative process. It will have mainly a positive
effect: the people of the world will become exasperated with
fundamentalism. When people become worn out and tired as
they see the disintegration of society, then they will lend an even
mightier effort to the integrative process.

This recrudescence of fundamentalism has been designed by
an All-Wise Providence in order to shake the world’s conscience,
to awaken the spirit of brotherhood, and to strengthen the spirit
of tolerance. Fundamentalism is a kind of religious irreligion
which, combined with the forces of materialism, secularism and
abandonment of the true spirit of religion, will create chaos and
confusion in the world, and will eventually turn people towards
the spiritual values, and eventually towards the Cause.

Q. ‘Nation-building has come to an end. The anarchy inherent
in state sovereignty is moving towards a climax. A world,
growing to maturity, must abandon this fetish, recognize the

oneness and wholeness of human relationships, and establish
once for all the machinery that can best incarnate this
fundamental principle of its life’ (WOB 202). The number of
nations in the world has rapidly increased since the time
Shoghi Effendi wrote this, especially in Eastern Europe and
Africa. Many other countries are on the verge of splitting up.
How should we view this process in the light of the above
quotation?

A. We must make a distinction between two totally different
processes. The first process is the creation of new independent
states due to the collapse of vast empires (e.g. British and French
empires) and the dismemberment of collective political unions
(e.g. the splitting up of the USSR). The second process is one
whereby independent nations try to strengthen their national
sovereignty and to become ever more independent of other
countries.

In my opinion, what Shoghi Effendi meant by nation-
building coming to an end was that it is no longer possible for
one nation to go it alone. It is no longer in harmony with the
spirit of the Age for one group of people to think that it can exist
within its own boundaries, ignoring the rest of the world. We are
now at the stage where it is imperative for the nations to become
united. Shoghi Effendi calls nationalism a fetish. We must
distinguish the spirit of nationalism from the spirit of patriotism.
Patriotism is love for one’s country. This will continue. The
future world civilization will be based on unity in diversity.
Everyone can still love their own culture and their own country.
That is natural. Shoghi Effendi has written, ‘Let there be no
misgivings as to the animating purpose of the world-wide Law of
Bahá’u’lláh . . . Its purpose is neither to stifle the flame of a sane
and intelligent patriotism in men’s hearts, nor to abolish the
system of national autonomy . . .’ (WOB 41). Nationalism, as
distinct from patriotism, is different, because it implies
neglecting the rest of the world, when national interests are at

\[244\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

stake, and even wishing one’s own country to prevail over
others. Shoghi Effendi says that this tendency towards national-
ism has come to an end. Universal solidarity is destined to take
the place of extreme national sovereignty.

Q. In The Promised Day is Come the Guardian explains the
high station of just kings and monarchs. Was he only
speaking about the hereditary kind of monarchs as there
were at that time, or could he also have meant presidents, as
we have today, or elected monarchs, for example?

A. There is nothing that I have read that gives a clear definition
of what Bahá’u’lláh had in mind when He wrote about kings.
However, He often used the phrase ‘kings and rulers’, so I think
that one could reasonably conclude that He was writing about
heads of state. Some heads of state are hereditary monarchs, but
nowadays many heads of state are elected presidents. This matter
certainly falls under the category of matters of state. ‘All matters
of State should be referred to the House of Justice’ (TB 129).

Q. ‘This judgment of God . . . is both a retributory calamity and
an act of holy and supreme discipline. It is at once a visitation
from God and a cleansing process for all mankind. Its fires
punish the perversity of the human race, and weld its
component parts into one organic, indivisible, world-embracing
community’ (PDC 5–6). Is the line of disintegration a part of
the Major Plan of God? Are the calamities the result of
mankind’s own behaviour? What is meant by the ‘judgment
of God’?

A. The line of disintegration is certainly a part of the Major Plan
of God, but we should not conclude that God likes to see all this
suffering. He looks at humanity and He sees the illnesses and
diseases afflicting it. As a Physician, He tells us that the con-

dition of this sick patient is going to deteriorate. His knowledge
of humanity’s waywardness doesn’t cause its waywardness.

As for the meaning of the judgment of God: God certainly
has not created the world and gone to sleep. He is watching over
the destiny of humanity and the fortunes of His own Faith. He
sees that the people of the world are not generally responding to
the Faith. He has sent to them His own Manifestation, and just
look at how they have treated Him and are treating His Faith!
Therefore, God designs a punishment for humanity because of
the behaviour of the human race. As Shoghi Effendi pointed out,
‘God . . . does not only punish the wrongdoings of His children.
He chastises because He is just, and He chastens because He
loves. Having chastened them, He cannot, in His great mercy,
leave them to their fate. Indeed, by the very act of chastening
them He prepares them for the mission for which He has created
them’ (PDC 189). In that sense, the punishment has a positive
effect. When a father or a mother punishes a child it is not
because of vengeance. Basically, it is because of love. It is to
help that child to realize its own mistake and not repeat it again.

Q. ‘Who is the sovereign, excepting a single woman, shining in
solitary glory, who has, in however small a measure, felt
impelled to respond to the poignant call of Bahá’u’lláh?’ (PDC
20–1). Who is the single woman mentioned in this quotation?

A. My understanding of this sentence is that it is a reference to
Queen Victoria.

Q. How can we understand the statement made by
Bahá’u’lláh, ‘In truth the station of this Revelation
transcendeth the station of whatever hath been manifested in
the past or will be made manifest in the future’ (TB 74–5).
Does this mean there will never again be a Revelation equal
to or higher than Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation?

\[246\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

A. This is a very good question. If someone were to ask you how
it is possible that Bahá’u’lláh has made such a statement you
should not be surprised. I will give you simply my own personal
understanding of it. He speaks about the past and about the
future. Let me deal firstly with the past. All the past revelations
throughout the Adamic Cycle appeared during the time when
humanity was passing through the different stages of infancy,
childhood and adolescence. It had not yet reached the stage of
maturity. However, Bahá’u’lláh has come at a time when
humanity has organically come to a point of social, spiritual, and
intellectual maturity. It is during the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh
that the world will be organically united for the very first time,
and a global civilization will start to emerge. In the course of
future Dispensations, this maturity will be refined and perfected.

In a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, it says ‘Future
Prophets will bring us new laws suitable to our state of
development and continue to educate us on this planet, but they
will be under the shadow of Bahá’u’lláh for five thousand
centuries’ (HE 71). All the Manifestations, in the Bahá’í Cycle,
will come under the shadow of Bahá’u’lláh. They will not go
beyond planetary unity, which represents its social maturity. It is
the unique glory of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation that it marks the
beginning of mankind’s unity and solidarity.

Q. You stated that only the Head of the Faith can identify
Covenant-breakers, but with the passing of the Guardian
there was on the one hand the International Bahá’í Council
and on the other the Hands of the Cause. Who was then the
official Head of the Cause and therefore who had the
authority to identify Mason Remey’s secession?

A. Shortly before his passing on 4 November 1957, Shoghi
Effendi wrote a letter to the entire Bahá’í World. In this letter,
dated October 1957, the beloved Guardian speaks of the Hands
of the Faith as ‘one of the cardinal and pivotal institutions’,

designates them as ‘the Chief Stewards of Bahá’u’lláh’s
embryonic World Commonwealth’, and describes their ‘dual
function of guarding over the security, and of insuring the
propagation’ of the Faith (MBW 127). This letter gave the
Hands of the Cause the authority to take temporary leadership
after his passing.

There is another reference that gives the Hands a special
responsibility in matters relating to the protection of the Faith. In
the Will and Testament, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written: ‘My object is
to show that the Hands of the Cause of God must be ever
watchful and so soon as they find anyone beginning to oppose
and protest against the guardian of the Cause of God, cast him
out from the congregation of the people of Bahá and in no wise
accept any excuse from him . . . Should any, within or without the
company of the Hands of the Cause of God disobey and seek
division, the wrath of God and His vengeance will be upon him’
(WTA 12–13). You can be sure that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in His
superhuman wisdom, could foresee the future and wished to
ensure the protection of the Cause by granting the body of the
Hands this authority.

We must also take into consideration this passage from the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas: ‘Endowments dedicated to charity revert to God,
the Revealer of Signs. None hath the right to dispose of them
without leave from Him Who is the Dawning-place of Revelation.
After Him, this authority shall pass to the AghMán, and after them
to the House of Justice – should it be established in the world by
then – that they may use these endowments for the benefit of the
Places which have been exalted in this Cause, and for
whatsoever hath been enjoined upon them by Him Who is the
God of might and power. Otherwise, the endowments shall revert
to the people of Bahá who speak not except by His leave and
judge not save in accordance with what God hath decreed in this
Tablet’ (KA ¶42). This passage clearly makes reference to a
situation where the line of Aghṣán has ended and the Universal
House of Justice has not yet been formed. In such a case,

\[248\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

Bahá’u’lláh orders that authority will then be vested in the
‘people of Bahá who speak not except by His leave’. This
description is particularly applicable to the Hands of the Cause.

We come now to the International Bahá’í Council. This was
the precursor of the Universal House of Justice. It had a very
specific function given to it by the Guardian. The International
Bahá’í Council was charged with the duty to improve the legal
standing of the Faith in the Holy Land, to forge ties with the
government, and to assist in the construction of the Shrine of the
Báb. The International Bahá’í Council was never called the Chief
Steward of Bahá’u’lláh’s embryonic World Commonwealth, nor
was it told to be watchful of Covenant-breakers as stated in the
Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. It was clear and obvious to
the friends that the Hands of the Cause would be the Head of the
Faith during the interregnum period.

Q. Regarding: ‘those world-shaking, world-embracing, world-
directing administrative institutions, ordained by Bahá’u’lláh
and anticipated by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and which are to function in
consonance with the principles that govern the twin institutions
of the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice’ (TDH
46). What are the principles that govern the Guardianship
and the Universal House of Justice?

A. First, let us consider the principles that govern the Guardian-
ship. Shoghi Effendi once said that the primary work of the
Guardian was to promote the teaching work. And, of course, the
protection of the Cause was another of his primary functions.
These functions have not come to an end with the end of the
Guardianship. These functions have been carried on by the
Auxiliary Board members for protection and for propagation and
by the Continental Counsellors. The Universal House of Justice
has ensured that these functions will continue into the future.

Now, let us look at the principles that govern the Universal
House of Justice. The first aspect is the election process. Shoghi

Effendi says that in the future there will be no changes in the
election process of the Universal House of Justice, because the
process is laid down by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. This calls for the process
to pass through three stages: (1) the election of delegates, (2) the
election of the National Spiritual Assembly by the delegates, and
(3) the election of the Universal House of Justice by the National
Assemblies. It is envisioned that, in the future, this election
process will not be changed. In addition, the law of Bahá’í
consultation will remain as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá envisaged it.

The National Assemblies will become legislative institutions,
while they will have within their orbit an executive body and a
judicial branch. The same will apply to Local Assemblies. Apart
from the spiritual principles which are at the core of the
Administrative Order, the main organizational difference bet-
ween the modern, secular system of government and that of the
Bahá’í system of administration is that in secular governments
the head of the executive branch is the president or prime
minister of the country. Shoghi Effendi has described the
institutions of the world superstate in this order: first comes the
international executive, second is the world parliament and third
is the supreme tribunal (WOB 40). The world superstate will not
be a Bahá’í system. Compare this list of institutions to one
Shoghi Effendi used to describe the future Bahá’í World
Commonwealth: First comes the world legislature; second is the
world executive, whose function is to carry out the decisions
arrived and apply the laws enacted by the World Legislature;
third is the world tribunal (WOB 202). In the Golden Age, when
this Bahá’í World Commonwealth comes into being, the
legislature will be the head of state, and by this I mean that the
legislature will be the highest centre of authority. This is one of
the main distinctions of the Bahá’í system of government.

Another distinction is that the world legislature (the Univer-
sal House of Justice) will be small enough to make the decision-
making process quick and easy. Whereas the members of modern
parliaments can number many hundreds of people, Bahá’u’lláh

\[250\] OUTLINE OF WORKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH

has written, ‘The Lord hath ordained that in every city a House
of Justice be established wherein shall gather counselors to the
number of Bahá, and should it exceed this number it doth not
matter’ (KA ¶30) In His interpretation of this verse, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá has said that the number of members of the Universal
House of Justice could be 19. This is a decision that only the
Universal House of Justice can take.

This will enable all of the members to consult quickly. I have
attended meetings with 18 people: for example meetings between
the House of Justice and the International Teaching Centre, and
the consultation is quite manageable.

Q. What is a pantheistic mindset? Does the present worship
of industrial objects, such as cars, have anything to do with
it? What is an anthropomorphic conception of God?

A. This question is referring to the statement in ‘The
Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh’: ‘So crude and fantastic a theory of
Divine incarnation is as removed from, and incompatible with,
the essentials of Bahá’í belief as are the no less inadmissible
pantheistic and anthropomorphic conceptions of God’ (WOB
112). According to a pantheistic theory, the sum total of
everything is God, and God is the sum total of everything. It is
also associated with the worship of many gods and false idols.
An pantheistic concept of God is that God is in everything. For
example, He is in a flower. Therefore, if you smother a flower,
you are killing God. If you cook a vegetable, you are cooking
God. Anthropomorphism is associated with attributing human
characteristics to God. If we were to believe that God has a
human body, then we would be holding an anthropomorphic
conception of God. Both anthropomorphism and pantheism are
unacceptable to Bahá’ís.

According to the Bahá’í teachings, God cannot be incarnated
into a human body. We do not agree with those Christians who
insist that Jesus was an incarnation of God, or that He is God ‘in

the flesh’. Shoghi Effendi says that the God who incarnates His
unknowable Essence into a human body would immediately
cease to be God.

What then is the relationship between God and His creation?

In Some Answered Questions, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has explained that
the Manifestations of God were divine Appearances, like the
image of God reflected in a perfect mirror. The rest of the
creation is an emanation from God. He gives an example of
emanation: a book emanates from a writer. The book is not an
incarnation or a manifestation of the writer, but it is created
through his power and bears the marks of his influence. This
answer is very brief, so you will have to carefully study the
writings to develop your understanding.

\[252\] VII
Shoghi Effendi’s writings in Persian/Arabic
As stated in Chapter II, the first Persian letter of the beloved
Guardian to the friends in Iran was dated 19 January 1922. As
was indicated in the Introduction, the number of his letters in
Persian and Arabic came to 12,308 communications. The total
number of pages as published by the National Spiritual Assem-
bly of Iran, several years ago, comes to 3,336. Some of the letters
are up to three pages long, while the longest, an abridgement of
God Passes By, is 197 pages. The rest of the letters are some-
where in between these two extremes in length. Of these, 830 are
letters addressed to the communities in the East in general.

In order to describe the general subjects that the Guardian
addressed in these letters (apart from the letters to individual
believers in which their personal questions were discussed), a list
has been prepared under the following headings: the Universal
House of Justice; Local and National Spiritual Assemblies;
teaching and the advancement of the Cause; opposition to the
Faith; the importance of historical sites and relics; historic
developments; obligations of individual Bahá’ís; clarification of
certain laws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and issues related to the Most
Holy Book; as well as other miscellaneous matters.

Set forth below are English versions of certain selected
passages from Shoghi Effendi’s letters in Persian/Arabic. These
renditions fall into three categories: authorized translations,

\[262\] WRITINGS IN PERSIAN AND ARABIC

authorized provisional translations, and free renditions. The free
renditions should not be regarded in the same light as the other
two categories. They have been put together for the benefit of
this course, in order to give us, in however narrow a compass, an
idea of the quality of Shoghi Effendi’s style when addressing the
friends in the East. In all cases, a note has been added to indicate
the nature of the translation in question.

> 1. [‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s] eyes are now directed towards His
> grieved and afflicted ones. From His exalted station, He is
> addressing the people of Bahá in this world of dust, and
> conveying to them these exhortations:

‘O my loved ones. Be not grieved and disturbed. Be not
> listless, nor lose hope and feel distressed. I am with you. I am
> guarding you in the stronghold of My protection, and at
> every moment I send you a fresh measure of assistance and
> confirmation. Be ye faithful to His Cause, and like unto this
> Servant, be constant till your very last breath, in service to
> this Faith and in thraldom at His Threshold. Exert your
utmost and vie ye with each other.

‘Be not saddened by My passing, nor afraid and unsettled
> by reason of the changes and chances of this world and its
> ever-checkered conditions. Do not waver in the Cause of
> God. Ye are His hosts. Ye are the people of Bahá who are to
> face the storm of this ordeal, to evince meekness and
> tenacity, and be adorned with goodly deeds and the
> ornaments of purity and rectitude of conduct before the eyes
of all men.

‘Arise to champion the Faith of God and lead this
> sombre, this afflicted and agitated world to the climax of
> eternal glory, under the shadow of the Cause of God, and the
canopy of divine Salvation.

‘O my beloved friends. O staunch ones who have arisen
to follow Me! Be not lax or negligent after Me, and do not

> forfeit your precious chance, otherwise you will find
> yourselves in utter loss and disappointment, deprived of the
> supreme blessing of everlasting felicity. Do not think that
> stillness and silence on the part of any of the believers will
> lead to any harm. Nay, by God! God will raise up heroes for
His Cause, who will win the day in His holy Name.

‘Strive ye, therefore, and exert your high endeavours. I
> am with you, and in the sublime presence of the Exalted One
> and the Blessed Beauty, I will aid your efforts and guide your
> steps with a mighty confirmation. You should all arise in
> utmost unity and attain this exalted station. Otherwise you
> will not see Me, nor enter His sacred presence in the
> heavenly Realms. O beloved ones of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. This is
> what will impart joy and happiness to My heart in the Abhá
> Kingdom.’ (19 December 1923, free rendition)

> 2. O spiritual brothers and sisters! I call on you to reflect
> and immerse yourselves in the Sacred Texts. Some fifty years
> ago, there poured down as copious rain from the tongue of
> the Mighty Founder of our Faith, our Lord, the All-Knowing,
> the All-Informed, admonitory Tablets, stern warnings, joyful
> tidings, and wrathful apostrophes addressed to the Kings and
Rulers of the East and the West . . .

Ere long, when the appointed time has come, the Rulers
> and Presidents of the Republics of the world will step
> forward and follow the example of the active supporters and
> helpers of God’s Holy Cause. They will cast away their
> crowns upon the dust, will adorn their heads with the
> begemmed diadem of total, absolute and unconditional
> servitude, will join the front ranks of the leaders and
> proclaimers of His Cause and with their substance, their very
> souls, and with whatsoever their Lord has bestowed upon
> them, will engage in spreading the tidings of God’s Faith and
> ensuring its triumph.

\[264\] WRITINGS IN PERSIAN AND ARABIC

And after completing their mission, they will hasten to
reach the shores of the Holy Land, will be privileged to
circumambulate the Holy Shrines in a spirit of humility,
submissiveness and lowliness, will raise their voices to the
heavens in praise, in glorification and celebration of their
blessings, and will convincingly demonstrate to the entire
world the validity and majesty of this Mighty Cause.

This is a standing promise, unfailing, unchanging and
immutable, as decreed by God, as it is irrevocably recorded
in His preserved Tablet. (February 1927, free rendition)

3\. Be well assured that, as the enemies of the Cause of God
will strive to oppose the Faith, its flame will be intensified
and its warmth and brightness will increase. The erudite and
intellectuals, who are carefully watching the progress of this
Cause and are investigating its aims, will never be influenced
or waver in their resolve, as a result of false reports and
futile, unfounded and conflicting accounts originating from
that land. They will never give up their search after truth,
nay, indeed they will only be led to deepen their study and
examination of the purposes of our Faith, its teachings and
principles so that they become fully aware of the essence of
the Cause of God. They will, as circumstances may indicate
and as guided by our All-Knowing and All-Powerful Lord,
arise to defend the Faith of God and ensure its triumph. They
will overcome the hosts of vain fancies and imaginings, will
destroy and uproot the edifice of falsehood and untruth and
will demonstrate, with sound evidence before the eyes of the
world, the purity, loftiness, power and reality of God’s
invincible Cause. (August 1927, free rendition)

4\. He is God! O mighty Lord! Thou seest what hath befallen
Thy helpless lovers in this darkest of long nights; Thou
knowest how, in all these years of separation from Thy

> Beauty, the confidants of Thy mysteries have ever been
acquainted with burning grief.

O Powerful Master! Suffer not Thy wayfarers to be
> abased and brought low; succour this handful of feeble
> creatures with the potency of Thy might. Exalt Thy loved
> ones before the assemblage of man, and grant them strength.
> Allow those broken-winged beings to raise their heads and
> glory in the fulfilment of their hopes, that we in these brief
> days of life may gaze with our physical eyes on the elevation
> and exaltation of Thy Faith, and soar up to Thee with
gladdened souls and blissful hearts.

Thou knowest that, since Thy ascension, we seek no name
> or fame, that in this swiftly passing world we wish henceforth
no joy, no delight and no good fortune.

Then keep Thy word, and exhilarate once more the lives
> of these, Thy sick at heart. Bring light to our expectant eyes,
> balm to our stricken breasts. Lead Thou the caravans of the
> city of Thy love swiftly to their intended goal. Draw those
> who sorrow after Thee into the high court of reunion with
> Thee. For in this world below we ask for nothing but the
> triumph of Thy Cause. And within the precincts of Thy
boundless mercy we hope for nothing but Thy presence.

Thou art the Witness, the Haven, the Refuge; Thou art He
> Who rendereth victorious this band of the innocent.
> (November 1927, authorized provisional translation, RD
> 9/11/05)

> 5. O people of Bahá! Raise your call addressing the people of

> of the world! O perpetrators of tyranny and oppression!
> Know ye of a certainty that we, the people of Bahá, bought
> our Faith with our own blood, and have tasted the sweetness
> of sacrifice in the path of His love. We are living in the hope
> of attaining His Presence. We are detached from all else but
> Him. We will help and support His Cause to our very last

breath, and are contented and grateful in the face of trials
and tribulations.

O people of the earth! Be well-assured, and give ye
assurance to every hesitant doubter that whatsoever has been
revealed by the Pen of the Most High will come to pass and
shall eventually be made manifest, as clear as the sun in its
midday glory. In this snow-white spot, as well as in other
lands, through the direct and celestial operation of the Will
of the One Who spread the earth and upraised the Heavens,
the fondest desires of His lovers will be realized and will
emerge from behind seventy thousand veils.

Then will the longing of the people of Bahá be
consummated fully, impeccably and to perfection. This is
what our Lord has promised us, both implicitly and openly,
and this is a pledge which will not prove untrue. Arise,
therefore, and tell the unbelieving world: ‘Die ye in your
wrath! Ere long shall the ensigns of God’s Holy Cause be
raised in every city, and shed its radiance upon all regions.’
(November 1927, free rendition)

6\. The Lord of Hosts, the King of The throne of divine
Majesty, is calling from His Exalted Realm during this
spiritual spring time, this RiZván period, the supporters of
His Most Great Name, and addresses them with these words:

‘O ye My ardent lovers! O ye who have arisen to help My
Cause! O ye bearers of My trust among My creatures.
Hearken unto My call. I am Ever-living in My Realm of
Glory! O My friends, be ye aware of My presence.

‘You were quickened for the triumph of My Cause. I
chose you for Mine Own Self. I singled you out that ye may
attain true understanding. I reared you for the exaltation of
My Word. I raised you up for the proclamation of My Sove-
reignty. I made you spiritual leaders among My servants, and
heirs of My heritage.

‘Be patient, O My lovers, I will unveil to your eyes My
> Signs, will strengthen you with My confirmations, and will
> fulfil all that I have promised in My Tablets. I will aid you to
> subdue My enemies and will realize your aspirations through
> the potency of My Might and My Dominion over all the
worlds.

‘Help Me on My earth, that I may render you victorious
> in My Kingdom – a Kingdom lofty, exalted, luminous,
wondrous and sublime.

‘O ye who are the treasuries of the hidden and heavenly
> secrets enfolded in My Cause, the repositories of the
> matchless tokens of My wisdom, and the mysteries of My Law
> – a Law which has manifestly emerged from behind the veils,
> and whose light will shed its radiance upon all regions with a
> brilliance that past centuries have not witnessed. Then will
> the sanctified and angelic dwellers in the Concourse on High
> sing songs of glory and praise, and beyond them shall rejoice
> God’s Messengers and Prophets in the highest Heaven. Then
> shall ye clearly witness the gems and tokens that the hands of
> Our grace, wisdom and might had concealed from the eyes of
> men, in this bewildering, this challenging and irresistible
> Cause.’ (Riḍván 1933, free rendition)

> 7. Praise be to God, the One, the Single, the Eternal, the
> Ever-Abiding, the Supreme life-imparting Reality, the Being
> whose bounties embrace all things, He Who is the Invisible,
> Inaccessible, the Hidden Treasure, the Source of all grace,
> the Causer of Causes, He who has sent the Messengers, and
> set down the laws and commandments, Who has no peer or
> partner in His realm, no equal in the entire creation. All are

Salutations and peace be upon the Centre of God’s
Covenant, His Most Great Branch, His immutable and
glorious Mystery, the Gulf that branched out of His Ancient
Ocean, the Exemplar of His teachings, the Being round
Whom all names revolve, He Whom God has purposed, the
Apple of the eye of Bahá, His trust amongst His people, the
Interpreter of His Revelation, the Stronghold and Shield of
His Cause, the Promoter of His Law, the Repository of His
hidden secrets, the Expounder of the principles of His Order,
the Standard of His victory, and He Who attired His head
with the crown of thraldom in servitude to God’s Holy
Cause.

Joy and light be upon God’s Holy ones, His Chosen ones,
Successors and the Arch-Promoters of His Cause, His
Testimonies, His Witnesses, the Chief guides of His com-
munity – they who were appointed by the Messengers and the
Prophets to execute Their laws, to interpret Their utterances,
to consolidate the foundations of God’s Faith, to render it
victorious, to exalt His Name, to spread His message, to
demonstrate His might, to demand and establish the rights of
His Cause and to neutralize the evil designs of His enemies
and opponents.

Remembrances and praise be upon the people of Bahá,
they that hold aloft the banner of His Faith, and dwell in His
Crimson Ark, upon His kindred, the Leaves and Off-shoots of
the Tree of Holiness, the Letters of His Book, the Hands of
His Cause, the summoners of the people to His Call, they
who are firm in His Covenant, hold fast unto the Cord of His
love, long to shed their blood in His path, spread the divine
fragrances and are the builders of the foundations of His
New World Order – an Order which is the child of His Law
and the fruit of a Divine Covenant which is eminently
glorious, exalted, holy, unassailable and unique. (Naw-Rúz

verdant plants and illumined with bright lights, which is the
object of the admiration of the people of this region and a
source of joy and pride to the authorities in this land, will
subsequently be converted, as foreshadowed by the Centre of
the Covenant, into the Pathway of the Kings and Rulers of
the World.

These mighty embodiments of kingly power, humble
pilgrims to the Sanctuary of the Lord, will, upon their arrival
in the Holy Land, first proceed to the Plain of ‘Akká, there to
visit and circumambulate the Qiblih of the People of Bahá,
the Point around which circle in adoration the Concourse on
High. They will then make their way to this august and
venerated city, and climb the slopes of Mount Carmel. With
the utmost rapture, ardour and devotion, they will hasten
towards this Sacred Spot and, with reverence and sub-
missiveness, humility and lowliness, ascend these terraces to
approach the luminous precincts of the sanctified and holy
Shrine. Reaching the threshold of the Sanctuary of Grandeur,
they will cast their crowns upon the ground, prostrate
themselves to kiss its fragrant earth and, circling around its
hallowed arcade, call out ‘Here am I, here am I, O Thou
Who art the Exalted, the Most Exalted One!’ and recite in
tones of fervent supplication the perspicuous Verses of the
Tablet of Carmel.

Thereafter they will walk over the spacious lawns and
through the wondrous gardens of this sublime and holy spot,
this garden of the Exalted Paradise, will inhale its fragrant
scents and taste of its choice and luscious fruits. They will,
with tearful eyes and burning hearts, call to mind the pain
and suffering, each affliction and calamity, the duress,
imprisonment and martyrdom which befell that Wronged One
of the world, will behold, with their own eyes, on every hand
in this exalted Spot, the glory of Carmel and the evidences of
the compelling might and greatness, the invincibility, the all-
encompassing dominion of the Conqueror of the worlds, and

of Glory as the ‘Heaven of heavens’, and looks toward the
Qiblih of the people of Bahá, that Spot within the vale of
security and peace, the plain of ‘Akká, round which circle in
adoration the Concourse on high. To her right are the hills of
Galilee in which nestles the childhood home of the beautiful
Christ, and the locality by the banks of the Jordan River
where He Who is the Spirit (Jesus Christ) was called to
prophethood; and on her left, on the crest of Carmel, are to
be found the Cave of Elijah and the exalted Spot which was
blessed by the footsteps of the Most Holy Abhá Beauty and
was ennobled through the revelation of the Tablet of Carmel
from the treasury of the Pen of Glory. Behind her stand the
twin Mounts of Zion and Olives and the holy and ancient city
of Jerusalem, within whose walls lie the site of the martyr-
dom and the burial place of Jesus Christ, the seat of the
Throne of David, the glorious Temple of Solomon and the
Aqsa Mosque which ranks third among the shrines of the
Islamic world. Beyond these there rises Mount Sinai, the
cradle of the Jewish Faith, that Sacred Mount, the Paran of
light, that holy land where He Who conversed with God
(Moses) heard the Voice from the Blessed Tree. And further
beyond lies the Arabian Peninsula, the land of Hijaz, the
cradle of the MuJammadan Dispensation, with the two cities
of Batha and Yathrib, the noble Mecca and the bright
Medina, one enshrining the Qiblih of Islam and the other
the Resting-place of Him Who is the Lord of mankind
(MuJammad) – upon Him be countless salutations and
praise.

High, immeasurably high, is this Shrine, the lofty, the
most great, the most wondrous. Exalted, immeasurably
exalted, is this Resting-place, the fragrant, the pure, the
luminous, the transcendent. Glorified, immeasurably glori-
fied, is this Spot, the most august, the most holy, the most
blessed, the most sublime. (Naw-Rúz 1952, authorized

Six of the paragraphs reproduced above (1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7)
are labelled as ‘free renditions’. These renditions are neither

quotable texts.

On five occasions during his ministry, Shoghi Effendi
addressed simultaneous and parallel messages to East and West.
These occasions were the passing of the Greatest Holy Leaf; the
Centenary of the Declaration of the Báb and the birth of the
Bahá’í Revelation; as well as the launching of the Ten Year Plan,
with an outline of its goals; and finally, the completion of the
superstructure of the Shrine of the Báb. The details of these
messages have not been reproduced in this summary.

Interspersed in his letters there are 20 prayers written by him,
some in English and others in Arabic. Two of these have been
given in the extracts above (no. 4 is in Persian, and no. 8 is in
Arabic). The latter comes at the end of his abridgement of God
Passes By. The abridgement itself begins with a preamble (no. 7)
in which he offers praise and thanksgiving to Almighty God, to
the Blessed Beauty, the Báb, all God’s Messengers, ‘Abdu’l-

Bahá, the appointed successors of God’s Manifestations, and
finally the rank and file of the believers.

After the conquest of Persia by the armies of Arabia, soon
after the passing of the Prophet Muḥammad, Arabic words were
gradually assimilated into the Persian language. Just as in the
case of the English language, with the introduction of French and
Latin words after the Norman conquest, the Persian vocabulary
was infinitely broadened and enriched by the addition of Arabic.
Shoghi Effendi’s style in his Persian letters clearly illustrates the
importance of the introduction of Arabic words into the Persian
vocabulary. In fact, in the course of explaining the intricacies of
the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, and so as to better express his
deepest, inner sentiments, we find him introducing rarely used
but easily understood Arabic words and terms into his phrases.
His style is thus given an elegant and elevated tone, while still
being perfectly comprehensible to the average Eastern reader. By
this method, he was able to convey his inspired insights and
wisdom through a language that is at once clear, powerful and
exquisitely beautiful.

Several unbiased Persian scholars who, in the past, were
shown examples of Shoghi Effendi’s writing style by the
Bahá’ís, spontaneously averred that his Persian composition was
equal if not superior to that of immortal Persian authors such as
Sa’di. As to his original and graceful penmanship in Persian and
Arabic, the style of calligraphy he chose was both legible and
pleasing to the eye. Rúḥíyyih Khánum makes the following
comment in The Priceless Pearl:

> There are a number of styles of calligraphy in Persian and
> Arabic but his is a variation of ‘Shikastih Nasta‘líq’. It has a
> charm and originality, a grace and strength all its own. One
> should remember that calligraphy was the highest of the
> graphic arts in Islamic countries and beautiful writing was
> the distinction par excellence for the cultivated man to
> possess. The Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá all had wonder-

\[278\] WRITINGS IN PERSIAN AND ARABIC

> ful handwriting and Shoghi Effendi in this too proved
> himself worthy of his heritage (PP 202).

It must be made absolutely clear that the Guardian made no
effort to copy the unique styles of each of the Central Figures of
the Faith. Not only in his style of calligraphy, but in so many
other ways, such as his dress, demeanour, in choosing never to
occupy seats that Bahá’u’lláh or ‘Abdu’l-Bahá used during their
lifetimes, and even in avoiding the particular greetings his
Predecessors employed when welcoming the pilgrims, Shoghi
Effendi wanted emphatically to show that his station was in no
way comparable to those before him, and that indeed he was
under their shadow.

Q. What were the predictions of A%mad-i-A%sá’í?

A. This question is about the references made by Shoghi Effendi
to the allusions made by Shaykh Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í in his writings
(CF 101). Bahá’u’lláh was born in Tehran on 12 November
1817\. That very night, according to Nabíl’s Narrative, Shaykh
Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í was staying in Tehran as a guest of the Shah. He
was requested by one of the princes to proceed to Kirmánsháh.
But the Shaykh was aware of the significance of what had
happened in Tehran. He didn’t want to leave but he resigned
himself to God’s will and left. Before he left, it is written, he
uttered a prayer that the Hidden Treasure Who had been born
would be cherished by the people of Tehran. This story shows
the intuition which the Shaykh had about the coming of the
Promised One. However, the prediction which is mentioned in
Citadel of Faith and in God Passes By is more important. In one
of his epistles to Siyyid Ká`im, Shaykh Aḥmad has written ‘The
mystery of this Cause must needs be made manifest, and the
secret of this Message must needs be divulged. I can say no
more. I can appoint no time. His Cause will be made known after
Kín (68)’ (GPB 92–3). In the original language, the final
sentence has the meaning ‘His Cause will be made know after a
while’. However, according to Abjad numerology, the word ‘hin’
has a numerical value of 68. Therefore, ‘after Hin’ refers to the
year 69. According to the Hijrah calendar, the next year 69
would be 1269 (1852–3). It was quite clear that Shaykh Aḥmad
was making the prediction that the Promised One would appear
in the year 1852–3. It was in this year that Bahá’u’lláh received
the first intimations of His Revelation, while lying in chains in
the Síyáh-Chál.

Another of the predictions of Shaykh Aḥmad is alluded to in
the verse of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas: ‘Behold, the “mystery of the
Great Reversal in the Sign of the Sovereign” hath now been

\[280\] WRITINGS IN PERSIAN AND ARABIC

made manifest’ (KA ¶157). In his writings, Shaykh Aḥmad had
said that at the time of the Promised One all things would be
reversed. It is just like what Christ has said ‘But many that are
first shall be last; and the last first’ (Mark 10: 31). It means that
those who are downtrodden will be raised to glory and vice
versa. In fact, the latter part of the verse in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
corroborates this interpretation: ‘How many the outwardly pious
who have turned away, and how many the wayward who have
drawn nigh . . .’ (KA ¶157) It is exactly what happened in every
Dispensation. But in the Bahá’í Dispensation, it is even more
dramatic than it was before, because now it is on a universal
level.

Q. What is the meaning of the ‘nine concentric circles’? Is
this a fulfilment of a prophecy or is it a symbol?

A. It is a symbol. The ‘nine concentric circles’ is a concept that
Shoghi Effendi developed himself, in his English and Persian
writings. In my opinion, Shoghi Effendi wanted to emphasize the
importance of the Shrine of the Báb. In another of his letters he
says something that seems extremely strange, that the Shrine of
the Báb is the cornerstone of the Universal House of Justice. It is
very clear that the most sacred spot on earth is not the Shrine of
the Báb; it is the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. Quite often Shoghi
Effendi explained that the Shrine of the Báb was under the
shadow of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. By this he implied that the
Universal House of Justice, the head cornerstone of which is the
Shrine of the Báb, and indeed all of the administrative institu-
tions, consisting of the entire series of buildings around the Arc,
all are under the shadow of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh.

Q. What does the Crimson Ark refer to in the Writings?

A. The Crimson Ark in the quotation refers to the Cause of God;
crimson, because we have had martyrs.

Q. ‘These mighty embodiments of kingly power, humble
pilgrims to the Sanctuary of the Lord, will, upon their arrival in
the Holy Land, first proceed to the Plain of ‘Akká, there to visit
and circumambulate the Qiblih of the People of Bahá . . .’
(Naw-Rúz 1952). When is this going to happen?

A. Nobody knows. However, I don’t think they are all going to
come together, at once. When the Bahá’í Faith becomes the
established religion in a country, the head of state, whether he is
a king, a president, or whatever, will also probably be a Bahá’í.
This process won’t happen all at once, but gradually, one at a
time. I don’t think the time will ever come when the House of
Justice will make it a goal of one of its plans to have a head of
state become a Bahá’í and come on pilgrimage. It is a prediction
based on the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

Q. Mount Carmel is ordained to be the spot for the
emergence of three central institutions of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh: the Báb’s Shrine, the Dayspring of Lights; the
Mashriqu’l-Adhkár, the Dawning Place of His praise; and
the World Administrative Seat of the Bahá’í world
community, the Pivotal Centre to which all much turn. Why
is so much weight given to Mount Carmel? Why isn’t the
Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh the spot for the emergence of these
institutions? Why is not the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh the centre
of the nine concentric circles?

A. First of all, Mount Carmel is specifically mentioned in the
Old Testament. Also, Isaiah refers to a mountain towards which
all the nations of the world will move, to which all the kings and
rulers of the earth will turn. Apart from Isaiah’s prophecy,
Bahá’u’lláh Himself came to this mountain and revealed the
Tablet of Carmel. That was on the head of the mountain, near the
Catholic monastery, where the Temple land is. The Tablet of
Carmel has been called the Charter for the development of the

\[282\] WRITINGS IN PERSIAN AND ARABIC

Faith at the World Centre. In it, Bahá’u’lláh foresees that the
remains of the Báb would be interred in that Mountain. In the
same Tablet, He ordained that the Administrative Centre of the
Faith should be on Mount Carmel.

Nevertheless, the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh is the Most Holy, the
Most Sacred Shrine on the planet. And, as I stated before, the
Shrine of the Báb and the World Administrative Centre are under
the shadow of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. Blessed are those who
are able to visit that Shrine. In this day we are permitted to enter
the Shrine – what a blessing this is! Do you think, when millions
and billions will become Bahá’ís, that it will be possible to enter
that Shrine or the Shrine of the Báb? They will have to satisfy
themselves with circumambulation, while visiting the Shrines
from outside. Such will be the majesty of the Faith in the future.

Q. Why did the International Bahá’í Council have women on
it, if the Guardian envisioned it as the precursor to the House
of Justice? Will future Manifestations of God change the
laws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and allow women to sit on the
Universal House of Justice?

A. The International Bahá’í Council was a very important
institution. Its members represented Shoghi Effendi on their
visits to Jerusalem. This institution had a representative of the
Guardian, a president, a vice-president, a member at large, a
secretary-general, a treasurer and two assistant secretaries, one
for the East and one for the West. It had its own letterhead.
Shoghi Effendi assigned the building at 10 Haparsim Street,
Haifa, to be the seat of the International Bahá’í Council and he
put an appropriate sign outside the door of the building.

However, the Council was not the Universal House of
Justice. As you know, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written, ‘The House of
Justice, however, according to the explicit text of the Law of
God, is confined to men; this for a wisdom of the Lord God’s,
which will ere long be made manifest as clearly as the sun at

high noon’ (Sels 79). According to the principle of the equality
of the sexes, Shoghi Effendi saw no reason why the membership
of the precursor to the House of Justice should be confined to
men.

It would be possible for future Manifestations of God to
allow the membership of the Universal House of Justice to
include women. Shoghi Effendi has written, in a letter to the
Bahá’ís of the East, that the next Manifestation of God will be
empowered to change the laws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and to
change the structure of the Administrative Order of the Faith. We
are not told what changes He will make, but He certainly will
have that authority.

Q. What is or was the Nawnahálán Company?

A. Nawnahálán is a Persian word which means ‘children’.
Shoghi Effendi refers to this company in God Passes By, but he
uses the name ‘the children’s Savings Bank’ (GPB 342). In Iran
it was referred to as the Nawnahálán Company. It was initiated
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He made the initial contribution that became
the basis on which to build this Savings Bank. Violette and I had
shares in this company. When we went to our children’s classes
we would have the opportunity to buy some little shares, and
gradually we would build them up. At the end of the year they
would give us dividends based on how much profit the Bank had
made. Often we would just use the dividends to buy more shares!
And if anyone wanted to get their money back, they could sell
the shares. It was no problem at all. When the children grew up
they would often withdraw the whole lot so that they could pay
for their education or for other purposes.

Unfortunately, after the revolution in Iran the entire company
was confiscated, along with all its shares. Those of us who still
had shares lost them all. Many other things were confiscated as
well, such as sacred and historic sites, local centres, even
cemeteries and a lot of personal assets. It is hoped that in the

\[284\] WRITINGS IN PERSIAN AND ARABIC

future all these things will be recovered. When the Bahá’ís have
their rights restored, they should be able to receive compensation
for what has been confiscated, including the assets of the
Nawnahálán Company.

Q. You have said that, in his Persian writings, Shoghi Effendi
described the Shrine of the Báb as the head cornerstone of
the Universal House of Justice. Why is not the Shrine of
Bahá’u’lláh the head cornerstone?

A. We have to refer in this case to the Tablet of Carmel. For a
long time, none of the Bahá’ís fully understood the meaning of
many of the references in this Tablet. We knew that it was very
important, because it was one of the few Tablets that ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and Shoghi Effendi often encouraged the friends to
memorize. It was not until towards the end of his life that Shoghi
Effendi began to explain its meaning. He said that the Tablet of
Carmel provides the Faith with two Centres; one spiritual and
one administrative. The spiritual centre is the Shrine of the Báb,
referred to as the ‘celestial Kaaba’. The administrative centre is
the Universal House of Justice and its administrative institutions.
The House of Justice is referred to as the ‘Ark’ that God will sail
upon Mount Carmel. ‘The people of Bahá’ (TB 4–5) mentioned
in the Tablet are the members of the Universal House of Justice.
Shoghi Effendi personally explained these things to the members
of the International Bahá’í Council. The Council then wrote a
letter to the Bahá’í world to spread the news of this inter-
pretation. The letter was fully approved by Shoghi Effendi and it
was published in The Bahá’í World, Vol. XII.

As for the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh; its station is even higher
than that of the Shrine of the Báb. As already stated, the Shrine
of the Báb and the administrative institutions on Mount Carmel
are all under the shadow of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. The Shrine
of Bahá’u’lláh is the most sacred spot on earth.

VIII
Shoghi Effendi’s style
A. Writing style in English

Amatu’l-Bahá Rúḥíyyih Khánum, in The Priceless Pearl, draws
our attention to the fact that: ‘Unlike so many people Shoghi
Effendi wrote what he meant and meant exactly what he wrote’
(PP 196). She further writes: ‘In an age when people play
football with words, kicking them right and left indiscriminately
with no respect for either their meaning or correct usage, the
style of Shoghi Effendi stands out in dazzling beauty . . . It is
impossible to eliminate any word from one of his sentences
without sacrificing part of the meaning, so concise, so pithy is
his style’ (PP 196). It is difficult to find such an appropriate
description of Shoghi Effendi’s style as has been so charmingly
identified by one who was not only his consort but his secretary
as well, and bore heroically the load of onerous duties that the
beloved Guardian placed on her shoulders.

It would be illuminating to read her other comments on this
subject:

> It is really during the 1930’s that one sees a change manifest
> in Shoghi Effendi’s writings. With the rapier of his pen in
> hand he now stands forth revealed as a giant. Where before

\[288\] SHOGHI EFFENDI’S STYLE

From the beginning of my life with the Guardian until the
end, I was almost always present when he translated or wrote
his books, long letters and cables in English. There was
nothing unusual in this; he liked to have someone in the room
on these occasions to listen to what he was writing. His
method of composition was new and fascinating to me. He
wrote out loud, speaking the words as he put them down. I
think this habit in English was carried over from Persian . . . I
believe it is because of this that even his long and involved
sentences sound even more flowing and intelligible when
read aloud. The length of some of these sentences was at
times a cause of comment on my part; Shoghi Effendi would
raise his head and look at me, with those wonderful eyes
whose colour and expression changed so frequently, with a
hint of defiance and rebelliousness in them – but did not
shorten his sentence! I can recall only one occasion when he
admitted, ruefully, that it was a long sentence; but he still did
not change it. It said what he wanted it to as he wanted it to;
it was too bad it was so long. On the other hand he liked to
use a structure sometimes of very short sentences that
followed each other one after the other like the cracks of a
whip. He would call my attention to this variation in style,
pointing out how each method was effective, how the
combination of the two enriched the whole and achieved
different ends. (PP 197)

He was very fond of the device of alliteration, much used in
oriental languages but now no longer so common in English.
An excellent example of his use of this is provided by this
sentence reiterating words beginning with ‘p’ from one of his
cables: ‘Time pressing opportunity priceless potent aid
providentially promised unfailing.’ (PP 197–8)

Shoghi Effendi’s method of composition was like that of a
mosaic artist at work, who creates his picture with clearly

> defined and separate pieces; each word had its own place and
> if he struck a difficult sentence he would not change it
> around so as to accommodate a thought that grammatically
> could not fit into the sentence structure but would stick to it,
> sometimes literally for hours, until I at least was worn out by
> his verbal repetition of the phrase as he battled to subjugate it
> and fit it in the way he wished to, trying one piece of his
> mosaic after another, until he had solved his problem. I
> seldom remember his ever abandoning a sentence and
> starting over in a new form. (PP 198)

> The Guardian’s method of writing was interesting: he did not
> like large pieces of paper and usually wrote all his books and
> long communications on small lined pads. He did all his
> composition by hand; if the first draft was too written-over he
> sat down patiently and copied it all over. He typed, on a very
> small portable machine, by the two-finger method, all his
> own manuscripts, making any further changes as he went
> along. It is not surprising therefore that by this method he
> should have produced such highly polished works as we have
> from his pen. (PP 201–2)

One of my associates, for whose prowess in expressing
himself in elegant English I have high regard, wrote the
following about Shoghi Effendi’s style: ‘In most general terms it
may be said that the hallmark of the Guardian’s English is the
perfect blend it effects between a comprehensive knowledge of
the subject matter on the one hand, and a consummate mastery of
the language in which this is to be expressed on the other. Had
either of these been lacking, then it might truly be said that he
could not have achieved the level of excellence that he did . . .
[T]he writings of Shoghi Effendi . . . although they might appear
to some expansive, are in fact, considering the sheer vastness and
variety of the subjects dealt with, models of concision and
compression . . . [W]hat one surveys in looking at the writings of

\[290\] SHOGHI EFFENDI’S STYLE

Shoghi Effendi is not so much a particular style of English on a
par with many others; but rather the English language used to the
very height of its capacity, and with a level of mastery so
consummate as to constitute a testimony to the truth of this
Revelation.’

Comparing such writers as Gibbon, whose English style
Shoghi Effendi greatly admired, with that of the Guardian, my
correspondent further writes:

. . . [W]hereas the carefully wrought prose of the latter
> (Gibbon), for all its lapidary precision, is of a dry,
> sophisticated and slightly world-weary nature, that of the
> Guardian by contrast is brimful of vitality, enthusiasm, and
> redemptive affirmation . . . Intimately connected with the
> impalpably life-affirming, spiritual, and poetic qualities of
> the Guardian’s writings, is their immensely energizing,
> vitalizing and stimulating effect upon the reader, who,
> provided he approach them in the correct deferential and
> receptive spirit, cannot help but little by little feel his heart
> uplifted, his imagination fired, and even his pulse slightly
> quickened, as the sheer magnitude of the vision they unfold,
> imparted to some degree by every sentence, becomes
> apparent . . . (MH 4/12/05)

The longest letter Shoghi Effendi wrote during the first 11

years of his ministry was his tribute to his Great Aunt, the
Greatest Holy Leaf. It ran over nine pages of the compilation of
his letters published in 1933. The passing of the Greatest Holy
Leaf, as well as the ascension of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, were two events
that caused devastating grief to the heart of the beloved
Guardian. It is indeed more than coincidental, and perhaps
providential, that Shoghi Effendi was absent at the times of the
funerals of these two members of his family, who towered over
all the rest in rank and spirituality. Indeed, it could be said that

although the natural parents of Shoghi Effendi were present
throughout his childhood and beyond, his true spiritual parents
were ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Bahíyyih Khánum.

In 1921, when the Master passed away, Shoghi Effendi was
just embarking, at the youthful age of 24, on his mission as Head
of the Faith, and may have been understandably diffident in
expressing the full scope of his poignant sorrow. However, in
1932, when the Greatest Holy Leaf passed on, he allowed
himself full rein in the expression of his emotions, and freely
used the potency of his literary gift:

> How can my lonely pen, so utterly inadequate to glorify so
> exalted a station, so impotent to portray the experiences of so
> sublime a life, so disqualified to recount the blessings she
> showered upon me since my earliest childhood – how can
> such a pen repay the great debt of gratitude and love that I
> owe her whom I regarded as my chief sustainer, my most
> affectionate comforter, the joy and inspiration of my life? My
> grief is too immense, my remorse too profound, to be able to
> give full vent at this moment to the feelings that surge within
> me. (BA 187)

At the end of his letter he addresses a plea to the departed soul of
the Greatest Holy Leaf in these moving words:

> Dearly-beloved Greatest Holy Leaf! Through the mist of
> tears that fill my eyes I can clearly see, as I pen these lines,
> thy noble figure before me, and can recognize the serenity of
> thy kindly face. I can still gaze, though the shadow of the
> grave separate us, into thy blue, love-deep eyes, and can feel,
> in its calm intensity, the immense love thou didst bear for the
> Cause of thine Almighty Father, the attachment that bound
> thee to the most lowly and insignificant among its followers,
> the warm affection thou didst cherish for me in thine heart.

The memory of the ineffable beauty of thy smile shall ever

\[292\] SHOGHI EFFENDI’S STYLE

continue to cheer and hearten me in the thorny path I am
destined to pursue. The remembrance of the touch of thine
hand shall spur me on to follow steadfastly in thy way. The
sweet magic of thy voice shall remind me, when the hour of
adversity is at its darkest, to hold fast to the rope thou didst
seize so firmly all the days of thy life.

Bear thou this my message to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, thine exalted
and divinely-appointed Brother: If the Cause for which
Bahá’u’lláh toiled and labored, for which Thou didst suffer
years of agonizing sorrow, for the sake of which streams of
sacred blood have flowed, should, in the days to come,
encounter storms more severe than those it has already
weathered, do Thou continue to overshadow, with Thine all-
encompassing care and wisdom, Thy frail, Thy unworthy
appointed child.

Intercede, O noble and well-favoured scion of a heavenly
Father, for me no less than for the toiling masses of Thy
ardent lovers, who have sworn undying allegiance to Thy
memory, whose souls have been nourished by the energies of
Thy love, whose conduct has been moulded by the inspir-
ing example of Thy life, and whose imaginations are fired
by the imperishable evidences of Thy lively faith, Thy
unshakable constancy, Thy invincible heroism, Thy great
renunciation.

Whatever betide us, however distressing the vicissitudes
which the nascent Faith of God may yet experience, we
pledge ourselves, before the mercy-seat of thy glorious
Father, to hand on, unimpaired and undivided, to
generations yet unborn, the glory of that tradition of which
thou hast been its most brilliant exemplar.

In the innermost recesses of our hearts, O thou exalted
Leaf of the Abhá Paradise, we have reared for thee a shining
mansion that the hand of time can never undermine, a shrine
which shall frame eternally the matchless beauty of thy

> countenance, an altar whereon the fire of thy consuming love
> shall burn forever. (BA 194)

How can one remain insensible after reading such a soul-
stirring call! The American National Spiritual Assembly, having
received this letter, chose to produce a photocopied version of
the original in the handwriting of the beloved Guardian, so that
the friends everywhere would have access not only to a full
account of the life and work of one who was the heroine of the
Bahá’í Dispensation, but also to appreciate the degree of
heartbreak that afflicted Shoghi Effendi.

Before we end this section, a few minor points regarding
Shoghi Effendi’s writing style need to be addressed. It is often
forgotten that the titles used in the publication of the Guardian’s
letters were not always chosen by Shoghi Effendi himself. Most
of these titles were added by Horace Holley, who served as
Secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States
and Canada during the ministry of Shoghi Effendi. Holley also
inserted subtitles in the texts. Rúḥíyyih Khánum writes: ‘Horace
was a writer himself, and the titles he gave to the Guardian’s
communications not only served to identify them but dramatized
their message and captured the imagination’ (PP 205). She
further writes that Horace Holley, when inserting these titles,
picked up ‘phrases in the writing of the Guardian which were
most descriptive of the general subject’ (PP 205).

Another feature of the Guardian’s works (with the exception
of Nabíl’s Narrative) is the total absence of footnotes. He was
quite often quoting from Tablets revealed by the Central Figures
of the Faith, which had not yet been translated and published. It
is left to future scholars of the Faith to research these references
and, with the approval of the Universal House of Justice, add
them to the text. I have already commented on one footnote in
the Book of Certitude.

As to the cabled messages he sent to the Bahá’í world,
Rúḥíyyih Khánum has given us the following insight:

\[294\] SHOGHI EFFENDI’S STYLE

> Since the inception of his ministry Shoghi Effendi had
> increasingly used the medium of telegrams and cablegrams,
> not only because they saved time but because, as he
> explained to me, of their psychological effect; a cable
> conveys a sense of urgency and drama and is often a better
> way of driving home one’s point. Shoghi Effendi developed
> what one might call the language of cables to such a high
> degree that they became a literary accomplishment. Not
> infrequently he sent cables the length of letters. He thought in
> the abbreviated form when he wrote them. It was not a
> question of expressing a thought in the normal style of
> composition and then eliminating all the words that could be
> left out and still convey the meaning; from the beginning he
> did not think those words into his text at all and thus the style
> is very graphic, powerful and dramatic. (PP 225–6)

These cables were published in the American Bahá’í News,
and the National Office would insert words to make the text
more understandable to the readers. Quite often, when Shoghi
Effendi would read these inserted words, he would find that they
misrepresented his intention. He had to then write to the National
Assembly requesting them to make the necessary corrections,
which were subsequently published in the same bulletin. This
clearly shows his meticulous care in ensuring that his meaning
was conveyed correctly to the friends.

Another point regarding cables sent by him is that he
invariably omitted the closing greeting, and simply signed his
name. Sometimes he used his full name, Shoghi Rabbani,
possibly for security requirements during the war years.

B. Comparison of his English and Persian writings

In previous sections we dealt separately with Shoghi Effendi’s
writing styles in Persian/Arabic and in English. They are
certainly similar in their distinctiveness, their clarity, the elevated

character of their tone, their precision, systematic orderliness,
intellectual reasoning, exquisite beauty and fervency of appeal.
Shoghi Effendi has handed down to generations yet unborn a
matchless heritage of dissertations on the fundamental teachings
of the Faith, salient features of Bahá’í history, soul-entrancing
disclosures of the vision of Bahá’u’lláh about the destiny of His
Faith, and glimpses of the glory of the future Bahá’í World
Commonwealth.

There are unique concepts in the Guardian’s writings which
cannot readily be found in the Writings of the Founders of the
Faith, although the roots of his exposition can always be traced
back to the utterances of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. A few
of the startling subjects disclosed by the pen of Shoghi Effendi
are the following:

1\. The seven stages that national communities will experience

> as the Faith passes from obscurity to formal recognition,
> establishment and supremacy in their lands.

2\. The distinction between the Bahá’í Cycle and the Bahá’í

> Dispensation, the three Ages of that Dispensation, and the
> division of each Age into epochs, and epochs into phases.

3\. The need for every National Assembly to have a teaching and

> consolidation plan, and to adopt goals and objectives under
> the overall umbrella of the international plans formulated by
> the Head of the Faith.

4\. The concept of the nine concentric circles which surround the

> sacred dust of the Holy of Holies, namely the sanctified
> remains of the Blessed Báb. The first circle is the planet
> itself. The subsequent inner circles are the Holy Land, Mount
> Carmel, the properties owned by the Faith on that mountain,
> the gardens immediately adjacent to the Shrine, the domed
> superstructure, the six rooms built by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá during

\[296\] SHOGHI EFFENDI’S STYLE

> His Ministry, the vault wherein the casket has been
> deposited, and finally the casket itself.

5\. Despite the exalted station of the Shrine of the Báb, it is still

> under the shadow of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, the Most
> Holy Shrine.

6\. The characterization of the Báb as the fruit of the Adamic

> Cycle – a fruit which yielded its oil, and was subsequently
> ignited by Bahá’u’lláh in the lamp of His Revelation. This
> light is, under our very eyes, being diffused first to the major
> countries and islands of the world, then gradually to every
> spot on earth, enabling the warmth of Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings
> to penetrate, through the establishment of the administrative
> machinery of the Faith, into every land, and finally to suffuse
> the hearts of the population throughout the entire planet.

Regarding the tenor of the Guardian’s communications with
the East, several important points need to be remembered:

1\. The friends in the East were generally reared on the

> importance of the fulfilment of prophecies, the need to abide
> by the laws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, and the requirements of the
> teaching work. They were groomed to pursue these avenues
> and live the Bahá’í life in the hope that the Promised Dawn
> will break. They had very little experience in the conduct of
> their administrative affairs, because the institutions of the
> Faith in their countries were at a lamentably rudimentary
> stage. One of the main concerns of Shoghi Effendi therefore
> was to educate them in the administrative principles of the
> Faith, and in the creation and operation of both local and
> national institutions and their attendant agencies. In his
> letters he gave them the broad outline of the Bahá’í system of
> administration, but repeatedly called on them to follow the
model which was being carefully implemented in the West,

> more particularly in North America. He insisted that the
> Spiritual Assemblies have properly formulated constitutions
> and by-laws, and that these should follow the pattern that had
> been already established in America.

2\. In view of the persecution suffered by the friends in the East

> by reason of the constant incitements of the Muslim clergy
> and the abject indifference of the civil authorities, who
> refused to openly defend and protect the legitimate rights of
> the Bahá’ís, Shoghi Effendi had to counsel them to be firm
> and steadfast, even in the face of imprisonment, confiscation
> of properties, and martyrdom. He advised them to avoid
> becoming involved directly or indirectly, individually or
> institutionally, with any political activity, to obey in adminis-
> trative matters the regulations and restrictions imposed on
> them, to make efforts to obtain from the authorities gradual
> relaxation of these restrictions, and finally to place their trust
> in the promises of Bahá’u’lláh, Who anticipated not only the
> emancipation of the Faith but also its attainment to supreme
> glory in the land of its birth.

3\. While in the West, in view of the relative freedom enjoyed

> by individual citizens and minority groups, Shoghi Effendi
> had no reservation in writing to the friends about the vision
> of Bahá’u’lláh for the future World Order, he was deliber-
> ately cautious in unveiling this vision in great detail to the
> communities in the East. The first time he engaged in such
> expositions in Persian/Arabic was when he wrote his
> abridgement of God Passes By in 1944. It was then that he
> briefly expounded on the features of the Divine Order
> enshrined in the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh.

4\. In his letters to the West, Shoghi Effendi usually addressed

> the recipients in such phrases as, ‘To the beloved of the Lord
> and the handmaids of the Merciful, throughout . . .’. In his

\[298\] SHOGHI EFFENDI’S STYLE

> Persian letters however, he was more elaborate and
> descriptive of the condition of the Bahá’í communities in
> eastern lands. Included below are some free renditions of the
> way he addressed the friends in the East:

O ye the oppressed ones in the path of the Lord, who
> have remained steadfast in His Covenant and who are
> builders of the pillars of His luminous and excellent Order.

O burning torches of love and affection! I send you my
> salutations from this sacred, luminous and radiant Spot. Your
> loving memory is always on my mind, filled as I am with joy
> as I receive your glad tidings. I rejoice at the vastness of
> your services, remember you in my prayers, and seek for
> every one of you perpetual confirmations from the Kingdom
> of Lights.

5\. Another distinction is that in some of his letters, after such

> opening phrases as quoted above, he would begin with a
> preamble in which he would extol the Blessed Beauty, or the
> Master, or in general the Concourse on High. A typical
> example is the preamble to his abridgement of God Passes
> By in Persian. This appears in its free rendition form as
> extract no. 7 in our section dealing with Persian letters.

6\. In a few of his letters to the East, Shoghi Effendi felt free to

> directly invoke the Voice of Bahá’u’lláh or ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, as
> if they were addressing the friends at the very moment of his
> writing. Two free renditions of such passages appear under
> nos. 6 and 1 of the examples given in the Persian letters
> section.

7\. Yet another point is worthy of consideration. At times at the

> beginning of a letter to the East, and quite often at the end, he
would include an entreaty which was clearly not intended to

> become part of the regular repertory of Bahá’í prayers. He
> considered these more as supplications of his own, turning
> his heart to the Realms Above, referring to the state of the
> oppressed community of the Orient, and seeking divine
> assistance in the execution of the tasks ahead. Two such
> examples have been included in the list of provisional
> translations in the section on Persian letters.

Undoubtedly, in future years, the day will come when the
Universal House of Justice will make available to the friends in
the West authorized translations of Shoghi Effendi’s immortal
writings in the Persian and Arabic tongues.

\[300\] SHOGHI EFFENDI’S STYLE

Q. Why is it that, for over 80 years now, the writings of
Shoghi Effendi and of the Universal House of Justice have
conveyed a constant feeling of urgency? Is every day really a
critical moment in the life of the Faith?

A. That is a very good question! It signifies growth. The Faith is
a living organism. Every day, every moment counts. Every turn
of events is critical. It’s like when we have an infant, every day
in the life of this infant is critical. Just like Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and Shoghi Effendi, the Universal House of Justice looks at
the Faith as a living organism. They tell us that the time is
critical. They ask us to support matters that are very important at
every stage in the evolution of our Faith. The Faith is always
growing. It is not a dead or stagnant thing. It is a developing,
living organism. Every stage in its development is critical.

Q. Shoghi Effendi, when writing to the Bahá’ís of the East,
sometimes expresses thoughts in a form of prayer, or by
saying that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is now addressing the people of
Bahá. How should we consider these? Are these prayers?
Can we say that the Guardian wrote prayers?

A. Shoghi Effendi did not want the friends to consider what he
wrote, in the form of prayer, as prayers to be read on different
occasions or to be included in prayer books. He always described
what he had written in the form of prayer as a supplication: a
supplication rising from his own heart about the condition of the
community at that time, and asking Bahá’u’lláh for the removal
of difficulties, to help the Bahá’ís to arise and carry out the
wishes as expressed by Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. So, out of
respect for him. the House of Justice has decided that we should
not include these supplications in our prayer books at this time.

Regarding the second part of the question, I have given you
two examples in the material. In one, Shoghi Effendi transmits a
message from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the Bahá’ís, and in the second he
transmits a message from Bahá’u’lláh. This is something
peculiar to the writings of Shoghi Effendi addressed to the
friends in the East. He has not repeated this method of addressing
the friends in his letters to the West, with one exception. In ‘The
World Order of Bahá’u’lláh’, he communicates a message from
‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the friends. The way he expresses it is, ‘We can
dimly picture to ourselves the wishes that must have welled from
His eager heart as He bade His last farewell to that promising
country. An inscrutable Wisdom, we can well imagine Him
remark to His disciples on the eve of His departure, has, in His
infinite bounty . . .’ (WOB 86).

Q. ‘In the innermost recesses of our hearts, O thou exalted
Leaf of the Abhá Paradise, we have reared for thee a shining
mansion that the hand of time can never undermine, a shrine
which shall frame eternally the matchless beauty of thy
countenance, an altar whereon the fire of thy consuming love
shall burn forever’ (BA 194). Is this mansion purely symbolic,
or is it also a reference to the monument Shoghi Effendi built
over the resting-place of the Greatest Holy Leaf?

A. I think there is no question that it is a symbolic mansion
which we must have in our hearts for the Greatest Holy Leaf.

Q. The Guardian insisted that Spiritual Assemblies have a
constitution and by-laws. What does this mean for Local and
National Assemblies in this day?

A. When Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice
refer to the constitution of a National or Local Assembly, they
refer to a special document that exists. There is a model
document entitled ‘Declaration of Trust and By-laws of a

\[302\] SHOGHI EFFENDI’S STYLE

National Spiritual Assembly’. This document has been published
in The Bahá’í World, in volumes up to Vol. XX. After Vol. XX
the Universal House of Justice decided to bring out an annual
edition of The Bahá’í World, and these later volumes do not
contain that document. I think it first appeared in Vol. VI or VII.
It was the wish of Shoghi Effendi, and it is the current wish of
the Universal House of Justice, that every National Assembly
should adopt this document as its constitution. When a National
Assembly is seeking to become incorporated, the government, by
virtue of legal requirements of the country, may suggest some
changes to the constitution, but these changes are to be kept to an
absolute minimum.

There is another, much shorter, document called ‘By-laws of
a Local Spiritual Assembly’, which can also be found in those
same volumes of The Bahá’í World. Again, it is the hope of the
House of Justice that Local Assemblies, when incorporated, will
adhere to this model as closely as possible.

Q. You said that Shoghi Effendi invariably omitted the
closing greetings in his cables. Was this for financial reasons,
since every word had to be paid for?

A. I really don’t know why Shoghi Effendi did not include ‘Your
true brother’ or some other greeting at the end of his cables.
Cables are very expensive, so usually the sender would try to be
as brief as possible. That may well have been the reason, but we
can’t be sure.

In 1951 Shoghi Effendi reopened the doors to pilgrimage to
the World Centre, after the disturbances in Israel had lessened.
As soon as this message from the Guardian was announced, one
of the American Bahá’ís wrote him a letter in which he
expressed his longing to go on pilgrimage. Then he waited for
a reply. He left instructions at the post office of his town that if
anything was received by cable from Haifa, they should phone
him immediately and not wait to deliver the cable to his house.

About a week later he received a phone call informing him that
a cable had arrived from Haifa. While on the phone he said
that he had to go and get a pen and paper. So the official on the
other side waited. He went and got some paper, and when he
returned to the phone he said: ‘Yes, go ahead!’ and the clerk
replied: ‘Welcome. Shoghi.’ That was all! He had expected
a long message, but in cablese, briefness was Shoghi Effendi’s
practice.

Q. Why was Shoghi Effendi so reserved about writing to the
Persian believers about his vision of the future World Order
of Bahá’u’lláh?

A. Between 1921 and 1944, in his letters to the West, Shoghi
Effendi opened the eyes of the friends to the glory of
Bahá’u’lláh’s future World Order. However, he did not write
about this subject in his Persian and Arabic writings. It must be
said, a few of the friends in the East were quite aware of what he
was writing to the West. Shoghi Effendi encouraged the Iranian
Bahá’ís to learn English and to read his writings and to have
classes on them.

In my own personal opinion, I think he was waiting for the
conditions in the East to change. He wanted to wait until there
was greater enlightenment and liberality in the country. Between
1921 and 1944 there were many changes in Iran, and many more
people started to receive second level education, and even third
level, too. This brought the country out of its dark ages, if you
will. If he had started writing to them about the World Order in
1921, it would have probably been totally misinterpreted by the
Persian government. They would have accused the Bahá’ís of
trying to take over not only the government of Iran but the
government of the whole world! These misrepresentations would
have become ammunition for the enemies of the Faith.

In 1944 the Guardian decided that the time had come for him
to write something in Persian about the World Order. Then the

\[304\] SHOGHI EFFENDI’S STYLE

Bahá’ís in the East realized that they had totally misunderstood
that verse in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.

On this point, I should say that when Shoghi Effendi wrote
about the New World Order, he was not writing about politics.
He was talking about the spiritual and social evolution of
humanity. The Bahá’í Faith will not be spread through force, and
the New World Order will not be established through armed
rebellion. It will come about naturally, as a result of the maturity
of the human race, when the majority of the people in the world
would embrace the Faith. The way to hasten its arrival is to teach
the Faith. The Báb has written ‘The path to guidance is one of
love and compassion, not of force and coercion. This hath been
God’s method in the past, and shall continue to be in the future!’
(SWB 77). As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains this in Some Answered
Questions, Muḥammad never sanctioned offensive jihad. He
only allowed his followers to defend themselves against their
would-be attackers and murderers. After His death, the Muslims
themselves transformed defensive jihad into an offensive one.
Religion is not to be promoted with the sword. In the Qur’an it
says, ‘To you be your Way, and to me mine’ (109: 6) and ‘Let
there be no compulsion in Religion’ (2: 256).

IX
Miscellaneous
A. Brief statements introducing the Faith, its history, basic
principles and administrative structures

Shoghi Effendi wrote two statements during his ministry in
which he outlined the history and teachings of the Faith. The first
would have been produced in the early 1930s, and was written
possibly for the benefit of the British mandate authorities in
Palestine. It appears as a section immediately after the
Introduction to the 1955 edition of the compilation of Shoghi
Effendi’s writings entitled The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, on
page xi, and was called ‘The Bahá’í Faith – A Summary’. The
second statement was written in July 1947 in response to a
request made by the United Nations Special Committee on
Palestine. It was published by the Bahá’í Publishing Committee
in Wilmette, in October 1947, under the title, The Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh – A World Religion. There are many similarities
between the two statements, in such aspects as the treatment of
the principles of the Faith and a summary of its history. There
are, however, some distinctive features particular to each one .

The earlier statement begins with the following sentence:
‘The Revelation proclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh, His followers
believe, is divine in origin, all embracing in scope, broad in its
outlook, scientific in its method, humanitarian in its principles
and dynamic in the influence it exerts on the hearts and minds of
men’ (WOB xi).

In no previous writings do we find the statement that the
Faith is ‘scientific in its method’. It can well be assumed that
future scholars will research the point and develop this theme.

There are two other elements in the first paragraph that are
worthy of note. Emphasis is laid on the fact that ‘religious truth
is not absolute, but relative’. Furthermore, when referring to the
process of human evolution, we read the following sentence in
explanation of the consummation of that process:

> This final stage in this stupendous evolution, they [the
> Bahá’ís] assert, is not only necessary but inevitable, that it is
> gradually approaching, and that nothing short of the
> celestial potency with which a divinely ordained Message
> can claim to be endowed can succeed in establishing it.

(WOB xi)

A word of explanation might be useful regarding this
quotation. Some non-Bahá’í scholars have argued that if the
organic unity of mankind is inevitable, then we do not need a
divinely ordained Message to establish it. Two examples have
been given by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Tablets and talks which bear
on this point. Plants grow both in an abandoned field and in a
well-tended garden, but a gardener is needed to transform the
field into a garden! Likewise, a child develops its mental powers
organically, but an educator is needed to train and discipline that
development.

The second statement provides us with some highly revealing
features of the Faith. These are listed below:

1\. The social and material teachings of a religion are described

> as the ‘non-essential aspects’ of the doctrine promulgated by
> that Faith (FOB 2).

\[308\] MISCELLANEOUS

2\. The station of Bahá’u’lláh is uncompromisingly described as

> ‘the Promised One in the end of time’, and the advent of the
> ‘Day of Judgment’ (FOB 2).

3\. The aim of Bahá’u’lláh is stated as being ‘not to destroy, but

> to fulfill the Revelations of the past’, and ‘to reconcile rather
> than accentuate the divergences’ of the creeds in present-day
> society (FOB 2).

4\. The duty of investigating truth is not only the responsibility

> of humanity as a whole, but the ‘unfettered search after
> truth’ is a ‘primary duty’ of every member of the Bahá’í
> community (FOB 3).

5\. A description of the Administrative Order of the Faith is

> given, a feature which was not discussed in the previous
> statement.

6\. The Bahá’í Faith is referred to as ‘essentially supernatural,

> supranational, entirely non-political, non-partisan, and
> diametrically opposed to any policy or school of thought that
> seeks to exalt any particular race, class or nation’ (FOB 6).

7\. Yet another interesting point is the emphasis Shoghi Effendi

> places on the principle that Bahá’ís ‘subordinate every
> particular interest, be it personal, regional or national, to the
> over-riding interests of the generality of mankind’, by reason
> of the truth that ‘the advantage of the part is best to be
> reached by the advantage of the whole’ (FOB 7).

The statement ends with Shoghi Effendi quoting tributes
made by prominent world figures such as Queen Marie of
Romania, Leo Tolstoy, Revd T.K. Cheney, and the Master of
Balliol, Professor Benjamin Jowett, among others.

B. Statistical surveys

During his ministry Shoghi Effendi issued three statistical
surveys of the Bahá’í world community. The first was published
in 1944, consisted of 24 pages and was entitled A World Survey:
The Bahá’í Faith, 1844–1944. This was released on the occasion
of the Centenary of the Declaration of the Báb. The second
survey was dated 1950, consisted of 36 pages, and was published
under the title of The Bahá’í Faith, 1844–1950 – Information
Statistical and Comparative. The last survey was published
simultaneously in the United States and the United Kingdom in
1953, on the occasion of the Centenary of the birth of the Bahá’í
Revelation, and was entitled The Bahá’í Faith, 1844–1952 –
Information Statistical and Comparative, including supplement:
Ten Year International Bahá’í Teaching and Consolidation Plan
1953–1963.

This third survey consisted of a booklet of 74 pages, divided
into two parts. Part one covered some 50 pages, and dealt with
such subjects as: dates of historical significance; enumerations of
Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb’s best-known writings; names given to
the doors of the Shrine of the Báb; the fate of those who
persecuted Him and opposed the construction of His Shrine; the
Bahá’í Calendar; a list of significant events related to Bahá-
’u’lláh’s Proclamation of His Message; stages in Bahá’u’lláh’s
successive exiles; and cities visited by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the
course of His travels. Its contents also include data about
countries opened to the Faith; the languages in which Bahá’í
literature is translated and published; tribes and minority groups
represented in the community; names of the Hands of the Cause;
lists of National Assemblies and those which were incorporated;
principal Bahá’í historic sites in Iran; and names of prominent
personages who have paid tribute to the Faith.

Part two covers the objectives and goals of the Ten Year
Crusade. Under 23 headings, Shoghi Effendi tabulates these
goals by continent, and according to the responsibilities assigned

\[310\] MISCELLANEOUS

to each National Assembly. He gives alphabetical lists of
territories to be opened and languages into which Bahá’í
literature is to be translated, names the countries that need to be
consolidated and those National Assemblies responsible, and
further divides the goals in terms of National Assemblies to be
incorporated, temple sites to be purchased, national endowments
to be acquired and publishing trusts to be founded.

This precious volume also included a map that showed the
various goals, outlined in different colours for each category, and
indicating which National Assembly was responsible for which
task.

C. The Bahá’í World volumes

The idea of the publication of a Bahá’í Yearbook was a
suggestion made by Horace Holley in 1924. Shoghi Effendi
approved the proposal and considered it ‘extremely valuable and
timely’ (BA 74). He gave the responsibility of producing the first
yearbook to the National Assembly of America. From volumes II
to XII, Shoghi Effendi assumed the responsibility of producing
the publication himself, and also changed the title to The Bahá’í
World.

Rúḥíyyih Khánum, in The Priceless Pearl, gives us further
insights on the subject:

> Shoghi Effendi seized on this idea and from then on Horace
> became Shoghi Effendi’s primary instrument, as a gifted
> writer, and in his capacity as Secretary of the American
> National Spiritual Assembly, in making of The Bahá’í World
> the remarkable and unique book it became. (PP 209)

> What Shoghi Effendi himself thought of The Bahá’í World
> he put down in writing. As early as 1927, when only one
> volume had been published, he wrote to a non-Bahá’í: ‘I
would strongly advise you to procure a copy of the Bahá’í

> Year Book . . . which will give you a clear and authoritative
> statement of the purpose, the claim and the influence of the
> Faith.’ In a general letter addressed, in 1928, ‘To the beloved
> of the Lord and the hand-maids of the Merciful throughout
> the East and West’, and entirely devoted to the subject of The
> Bahá’í World, Shoghi Effendi informs them: ‘I have ever
> since its inception taken a keen and sustained interest in its
> development, have personally participated in the collection
> of its material, the arrangement of its contents, and the close
> scrutiny of whatever data it contains. I confidently and
> emphatically recommend it to every thoughtful and eager
> follower of the Faith, whether in the East or in the West . . .’.
> He wrote that its material is readable, attractive, compre-
> hensive and authoritative; its treatment of the fundamentals
> of the Cause concise and persuasive, and its illustrations
> thoroughly representative; it is unexcelled and unapproached
> by any other Bahá’í publication of its kind. This book Shoghi
> Effendi always visualized as being – indeed he designed it to
> be – eminently suitable for the public, for scholars, to place
> in libraries and as a means, as he put it, of ‘removing the
> malicious misrepresentations and unfortunate misunder-
> standings that have so long and so grievously clouded the
luminous Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.’

It was a book that he himself often gave as a gift to
> royalty, to statesmen, to professors, universities, newspaper
> editors and non-Bahá’ís in general, mailing it to them with
> his simple personal card ‘Shoghi Rabbani’ enclosed. The
> reaction of one of these – an American professor – conveys
> very clearly the impression the gift Shoghi Effendi had sent
> him produced: ‘Two copies of Bahá’í World have reached us
> . . . I cannot tell you how much I appreciate being able to
> study the book, which is exceedingly interesting and
> inspiring in every way . . . I congratulate you especially for
> developing the literature, and keeping alive such a whole-
> some spirit amongst the persons of many different groups

\[312\] MISCELLANEOUS

> who look to you for leadership.’ But perhaps the greatest
> tribute to the calibre of this publication, into which Shoghi
> Effendi poured throughout the years so much time and care,
> was that a proud Queen should write for it special tributes to
> the Faith and consent that these and her own photograph
> should appear as frontispieces in its various volumes. ‘No
> words’, Shoghi Effendi wrote to Martha Root in 1931, upon
> receiving from her one of Queen Marie’s specially written
> tributes, ‘can adequately express my pleasure at the receipt
> of your letter enclosing the precious appreciation which will
> constitute a valuable and outstanding contribution to the
> forthcoming issue of the Bahá’í World.’ (PP 211–12)

> He always deplored the fact that the material was not of a
> higher standard. It is due solely to his determination and
> perseverance that the Bahá’í World volumes are as brilliant
> and impressive as they are. (PP 210)

Partly because of the difficulty in obtaining adequate mater-
ial, and also because of his other preoccupations, Shoghi Effendi
found that he would have to cover two or more years in each of
the publications. He produced eleven volumes during his
ministry. Volume XIII of The Bahá’í World, which covered the
period of the Interregnum from the passing of Shoghi Effendi in
1957 to the end of the Ten Year Crusade, was produced by the
Hands of the Cause of God in the Holy Land. Thereafter, the
Universal House of Justice followed the same practice, and
issued seven more volumes covering the years from 1963 to
1992\. Subsequently, the House of Justice has found it possible to
publish the volumes on a yearly basis.

Q. What happened to the descendants of Queen Marie of
Romania? Was not her daughter also a Bahá’í? What is the
relationship of the family to the Faith now?

A. My wife, Violette, can deal with this question better than I.
Here is Violette: ‘The youngest daughter of Queen Marie,
Princess Ileana, was with her mother during the visits of Martha
Root and she was very attracted to the Faith. She never actually
said that she was a believer, unlike her mother. After the passing
of Queen Marie and all the political upheavals in Romania, when
the whole royal family left the country, Princess Ileana went to
the United States. While there, she actually converted to the
Catholic Faith and towards the end of her life she was a nun. She
lived in a convent and she was very much involved in that kind
of life, and then something very unusual happened. Shoghi
Effendi had told the Bahá’ís that whenever there were royalty or
heads of government, or important political people in the area,
the individual Bahá’ís should not contact them. Whatever contact
is made, he said, should be made through the administrative
bodies. Princess Ileana gave a talk at a conference in the US
about her mother. This is a story of many years ago, in the
lifetime of Shoghi Effendi. One of the Bahá’ís, a lady, was very
enthusiastic and she thought Princess Ileana should have said in
her talk that her mother was a Bahá’í. She got up in that
conference and raised her hand, and then said to the Princess that
there was evidence that her mother, Queen Marie, was a Bahá’í.
Princess Ileana was very upset in public, and she publicly
denounced this fact. When she wrote her biography of her
mother, her family and herself, she very specifically said that her
mother belonged to the Orthodox Church, or whatever was the
church of Romania. It was a very sad thing and there was no
reason why this would have come out in her book, had she not
been provoked by this Bahá’í in public.

\[314\] MISCELLANEOUS

‘The grandson of Queen Marie is now King Michael. He is
not officially the King of Romania, but if they wanted a king, he
would be the one. He is a very nice man. I remember, in 1996,
when Rúḥíyyih Khánum was in London, arrangements were
made for her to meet with King Michael and his wife, Queen
Ann, a very wonderful couple. They are not interested in
becoming Bahá’ís, but they are very fine individuals. They know
about the Faith, as does their daughter, Crown Princess
Margarita. She was in India one or two years ago. She was there
officially with a group and they went to visit the Temple. There
is a reception room next to the Temple in Delhi. When they took
her to see this place, Mr Fariborz Sahba himself was present, and
he took her around. There is a whole wall in that building of the
photographs of Queen Marie and her statements about the Faith.
This Princess Margarita was extremely impressed. She read and
she turned to Mr Sahba and said, “Yes, I recognize the hand-
writing of my great-grandmother”. They are quite aware of the
Faith but none of them is a Bahá’í.’

Q. What does the beloved Guardian mean when he states
that religious truth is relative, not absolute? What impact
should the statement have on our teaching work?

A. The fact that religious truth is relative means that it cannot be
absolute. It has to be suited to the conditions and the capacity of
the recipient of that truth. If that recipient is limited in his
understanding, the measure of truth given to him must also be
limited. It must be suited to the recipient’s requirements.

For example, children at elementary school learn about
arithmetic. It is simplified for the capacity of the children. There
is so much that the children are not and cannot be told, because
they would not understand. For example, they cannot learn about
the complicated algorithms that are used in modern technology.
A lot of that is arithmetic as well, but it is so complicated that we
cannot even do it easily on paper. We need computers to work

out these calculations. Therefore, we can say that arithmetic is a
relative truth. The level of understanding of the subject is not
absolute. We will always be able to learn more than what we
currently know. This is about scientific truth. Religious truth is
the same. It is adapted to our understanding.

The statements of Abraham about God are still true. He
compared God to the Sun. Even in Islam, the conception of God
is not as elaborate as it is in our Faith. Christ referred to God as
His Father and said that the Father was in Him. The choice of
this simple terminology was in conformity with the under-
standing of the people of the time. In addition, religious truth
involves the conception of the soul and the next world.
Muḥammad compared the next world to a garden. His words are
true, but they were adapted to the minds of the people of the
time. Bahá’u’lláh has explained the meaning of all these terms,
such as heaven, hell, the garden, the Sun etc. However, this is not
the end. Religious truth is still relative and the future Manifest-
ations of God will further develop these themes for humanity.

Q. What are the social and material teachings of a religion?

A. Shoghi Effendi has described the social and material teach-
ings of religion as non-essential. He employed the terminology
of essentials and non-essentials. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá used a different
terminology. He spoke about spiritual teachings and social
teachings. The meaning is very clear: the teachings of every
religion are comprised of two parts. The essential part has to do
with morality, with ethics, and with the eternal, immutable
principles of religion. The non-essential part includes instruc-
tions about material things and matters related to our daily lives,
e.g. inheritance, marriage, divorce, burial, as well as pray-ers,
fasting etc. The essentials are really the same in all religions but
the non-essential parts can change.

However, Shoghi Effendi mentions that there is a third part
of the teachings of every religion. The third part consists of the

\[316\] MISCELLANEOUS

man-made additions to the essential and non-essential parts of
religion. The essential part of the religion is not static, as each
Manifestation elaborates on that essential part. Each Manifest-
ation of God also makes amendments to the non-essential parts
of religion, as is required. The man-made additions to religion
are always set aside and disregarded.

We should use the concepts of essential, non-essential and
man-made rituals in order to teach the principle of religious unity
and progressive revelation. It is through this kind of explanation
that we can demonstrate that it is possible for all religions to be
in complete agreement. Tolerance of other religions is good, but
it is not enough. People must see the unity of religion.

Conclusion
When one reviews the panorama of Shoghi Effendi’s writings, in
English and in Persian/Arabic, one is bound to be overwhelmed
by the power, beauty and precision of the language he uses. As
we have seen in the above sections, his style changed over the
years and became more forceful, more impressive and more
majestic. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had envisaged in His Will and
Testament, the tender plant had become a mighty tree, and the
tree had yielded its fruit.

Shoghi Effendi himself never stated the broad lines of his
ministry in so many words. We might, however, identify some
compelling overall objectives in the literary work he produced so
profusely, so lovingly and so wisely over the years. Five of these
overriding themes appear to have occupied a central position in
his writings.

1\. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas foreshadows the formation of the

> Universal House of Justice at the end of the line of the
> Aghṣáns. From the very outset of his ministry the Guardian
> drew the attention of the friends to the shining goal of
> establishing, on a firm foundation, the Supreme Body of the
> Administrative Order. For this firm foundation to be
> achieved it was imperative that Local Assemblies be estab-
> lished in the true spirit and with the sound procedures of
> Bahá’í elections. These assemblies had to function harmon-
> iously and efficiently, in accordance with a set of clearly
> defined by-laws, and their consultation had to follow the
lofty principles enumerated by the Master in His Tablets.

In addition, National Assemblies had to be established in
conformity with the stipulations laid down in the Will and

\[318\] CONCLUSION

> Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, to be formed through well-
> ordered National Conventions, and function, like Local
> Assemblies, in accordance with national by-laws. They had,
> moreover, to organize and promote the teaching work, to
> provide means for the spiritual enrichment and development
> of the community, to establish national headquarters, acquire
> endowments, issue regular bulletins, and represent the Faith
> to those in authority in the country. These Assemblies were
> also meant to become effective instruments to execute the
> provisions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablets of the Divine Plan.
> Such preliminary steps Shoghi Effendi considered as
> essential for the eventual election of the Universal House of
> Justice, the future Pivot of the Covenant and Central
> Authority to which all must turn.

2\. Unfounded theories and even unwarranted assumptions were

> being made by the believers about each of the Central
> Figures of the Faith, as well as about himself as Guardian of
> the Cause. Administrative unity was not enough – it had to be
> combined with the greater concept of doctrinal unity. Thus,
> he had to define in clear terms the distinction between God,
> the Almighty Creator and Essence of Essences, and His
> Manifestations, who were the Perfect Mirrors of Divine
> Light. The unapproachable station of Bahá’u’lláh, the sing-
> ular position of the Báb in the Bahá’í Dispensation, and the
> unique rank occupied by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Mystery of God,
> had to be delineated. Likewise, the twin institutions of the
> Guardianship and the House of Justice, the distinctive
> features of the Administrative Order, and the relationship of
> that Order to the Author of the Faith and the Centre of its
> Covenant, had to be explicitly explained. Such must have
> been the motives that led Shoghi Effendi to write ‘The
> Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh’, which, as stated earlier, he
> regarded as a supplement to the Will and Testament of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

3\. He saw the need to provide the community with an authentic

> record of the historical events of the Ministries of the Báb
> and of Bahá’u’lláh, as well as the major developments of the
> first Bahá’í Century. This prompted him to produce first The
> Dawn Breakers and then God Passes By.

4\. Looking into the future, he had to outline the stages that the

> Bahá’í Administrative Order would traverse as it matured
> into the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, and eventually into the
> Bahá’í Commonwealth. These steps had to be described in
> the context of world developments, on the one hand, and on
> the other in line with the driving, mysterious force which
propelled the Cause of God on its divinely ordained course.

In conjunction with the overshadowing responsibility of
> individual teaching, Shoghi Effendi urged National Assem-
> blies to formulate collective teaching plans, and trained them
> to create agencies and instruments to implement the two
> necessary counterparts of community development, namely,
> expansion and consolidation. These national undertakings
> would prepare the Bahá’í world to engage in universal
> enterprises such as the Ten Year Crusade, aiming at the
> diffusion of the light of the Bahá’í Revelation throughout the
> planet, and the spread of its beneficial influence over all
> races, creeds and classes of humanity.

5\. Apart from these overriding considerations, he certainly had

> other concerns that he had to address. For example, he could
> not ignore the need to emphasize the moral aspect of Bahá’í
> life, and the obligation of adhering to norms of personal
> behaviour such as freedom from prejudice, rectitude of
> conduct, and attainment of excellence in all things. He also
> had to warn the Bahá’ís against affiliating themselves with
> political parties and interfering in political activities. Further-
> more, as the independence of the Faith was becoming

\[320\] CONCLUSION

> increasingly apparent, the followers of the Most Great Name
> had to disassociate themselves from the ecclesiastical orders
> of other religions. The Guardian encouraged the Bahá’ís to
> actively serve their countries by participating in adminis-
> trative (non-political) fields of government, as well as in
> community activities and benevolent pursuits. On the
> international level, he called on the friends to support
> humanitarian projects and other endeavours in harmony with
> the spirit of the Faith, and to aid efforts that would promote
> the general interests of the human race as it is impelled along
> the path to world solidarity and universal peace.

How perceptive was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who, when asked about
the ‘little child’ Isaiah had prophesised would ‘lead’ the faithful
to triumph (Isa. 11: 6), answered in a Tablet that that child was
indeed alive. The Tablet has been quoted by Amatu’l-Bahá in
The Priceless Pearl:

> O Maidservant of God! Verily, that child is born and is alive
> and from him will appear wondrous things that thou wilt
> hear of in the future. Thou shalt behold him endowed with
> the most perfect appearance, supreme capacity, absolute
> perfection, consummate power and unsurpassed might. His
> face will shine with a radiance that illumines all the horizons
> of the world; therefore forget this not as long as thou dost
> live inasmuch as ages and centuries will bear traces of him.

(PP 2)

We have seen the ‘supreme capacity’ of Shoghi Effendi’s
inspired pen, and the ‘consummate power and unsurpassed
might’ that he evinced through his immortal writings. Indeed, he
has shed his illumination on ‘all the horizons of the world’, and
future generations will witness how ‘ages and centuries’ have
borne ‘traces of him’.
