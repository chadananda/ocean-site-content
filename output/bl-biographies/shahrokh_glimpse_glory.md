A transcript of audio-cassette from series

WINDOWS TO THE PAST
by Darius K. Shahrokh, M.D.

To choose a few stories of the majestic life of Baha'u'llah is
not that easy. His eight years as a prominent Babi and then forty
years of His ministry were quite eventful. Having only forty-five
minutes, I decided to choose those stories which inspired me most,
and I hope to relay that spirit to you.

These are stories of some of the believers who were privileged
to live during the lifetime of Baha'u'llah and some were dazzled
by a glimpse of the Kingdom of Glory, and some, who with closeness
to Him, the flame of love was enkindled in their hearts with such
intensity that whoever came in contact with them could feel the
fire of love burning in their souls.

Before doing that, I like to tell you about the creation of that
light which was concealed within the Holy Being of Baha'u'llah.
But who dares to describe the creation of the Light of God or
Baha'u'llah.  The only people authorized to do so were Abdu'l-
Baha and the Guardian of the Faith, Shoghi Effendi. I will para-
phrase the matchless words of the Guardian in drawing the panorama
of the ''Evolution of the Majestic Process of Divine Revelation."
It is from his message of 1953 at the launching of the Ten Year
Crusade.

As you recall, 1953 was the first Holy Year, one hundred years
from Baha'u'llah's intimation in the Siyah-Chal about His mission.
The task of the Ten Year Crusade was given to only twelve National
Spiritual Assemblies, and, now, in forty years we see it has multi-
plied about fourteen times to one hundred sixty-five National
Spiritual Assemblies.

In that message, the Guardian states that at the dawn of Adamic
Cycle the tree of Divine Revelation was planted by the Hand of
Providence in the soil of Divine Will.      The whole Adamic Cycle
of six thousand years was to nurture the slow and steady growth
of this Tree through the light and heat of the prophets such as
Moses, Zoroaster, Jesus and Muhammad, and watered by the blood
of countless martyrs. The tree brought forth its branches, leaves,
blossoms and finally its fruit. The fruit was the Declaration
of the Bab in 1844 in -   Shiraz; a fruit which belongs neither to
the East nor to the West.

Then the grinding of the sacred seed of this fruit for six years
in the mill of adversities yielded its oil with the Martyrdom of
the Bab in 1850 in Tabriz. Soon, in the darkness of the Siyah-ma1
of Tehran in 1852, this oil was ignited by the Hand of Providence.
The light of God was enkindled.

This beautiful and dramatic explanation by the Guardian clearly
tells us that Baha'u'llah is the essence, the culmination and the
consummation of all the revelations of the past. He is not just
another prophet. He is the Lord of Hosts, the incarnation of the
Holy Spirit, and the Inaugurator of the Day of God.    Doesn't he
state in the medium obligatory prayer that He is the Speaker in
the Burning Bush on Sinai?

Baha'u'llah seldom responded positively to those who demanded a
miracle, but often showed a glimpse of His glory and might to those
who had recognized Him to strengthen their faith.       Let us walk
through time, and let your imagination take you away.         I will
take you there, and will show you such heights of delight which
will take your breath away and you might not wish to come back.

Let us start our stories alphabetically and begin with Ahmad, the
flame of fire and river of life eternal.    As you know, he lived
one hundred years. No, that makes too many stories and time is
limited so let us do it chronologically.

The first year in Baadad, right after Baha'u'llah's imprisonnment
in the Siyah-Chal and His dream when these exalted words were heard
on every side,'"Verily,  We render Thee victorious by Thyself and
by Thy Pen," He well-knew that His revelation would be like a down-

pour in springtime. No doubt about it. The first revelation after
His intimation was revealed while He was in the Siyah-aal. It
is called Rashh-i-'Ama which is in the form of a poem in Persian,
consisting ofnineteen lines. In every line, He praises the glory
of God of which He became the embodiment. He described the release
of spiritual energy and coming of the Day of God and the character,
power, and potentialities of His revelations to come in the next
forty years.

I like to tell you a little about the condition of the times of
His revelation.    For reference, I have used Volume I of -      The
Revelation of Baha'u'llah by Mr. Adib Taherzadeh, a member of the
Universal House of Justice. He writes, "The revelations which
came like a copious rain are unsurpassed in their beauty, richness
and eloquence. The Holy Book of Qur'an consists of six thousand,
three hundred verses revealed by Muhammad in twenty-three years.
In this Dispensation, within one hour, equal to one thousand verses
were revealed by Baha'u'llah, and as testified by Himself, were
the secretary capable of recording, in a single day and night He
could reveal equal to the Persian Bayan which the Bab rvealed within
one year, consisting of eight thousand verses. "

No wonder His scribe always had a large stack of paper, a bundle
of reed pens and not a regular ink pot, but a small bowl of ink.
Many times the speed of writing was so fast that the pen would
jump out of his hand, and the ink of the first letter was barely
dry before the whole paper was covered.   At times he had to beg
that he could not catch up and Baha'u'llah would repeat. His
shorthand was like a scribble and could only be deciphered by
himself and occasionally even he could not decipher it.   He had
to ask Baha'u'llah for help.

Now for the charged atmosphere of the time of revelation - only
some believers were given this privilege to stay for a short time.
One recounts that during the revelation everything in the room
became vibrant and luminous. The carpet, the floor, walls, the
ceiling pulsated with life. The air became perfumed and a special
glory, authority, and radiance emanated from Baha'u'llah.      The
transfiguration of His face was such that the believer was dazzled
by it and could not look at His countenance. The state of
excitement was so intense that for awhile the Blessed Beauty was
not able to eat.

He needed a secretary with the fastest shorthand who would stay
on the job for forty years and the most difficult qualification
-a person who would have the strength and stamina to withstand
the charged atmosphere of the time of revelation. How could He
hire a secretary with these qualifications and offer mainly
spiritual fringe benefits? Do you remember the Guardian's panorama?
The Tree of Divine Revelation was planted in the soil of Divine
Will, and we know when there is a will, there is a way, particularly
if it is the Divine Will. Well, He created His secretary.

Mirza Aqa Jan was a Babi youth from Kashan, Iran, who saw the Bab
in his dream and next day came across some writings of Baha'u'llah.
He was not from the learned class.     His job was to make soap and
sell it.    As soon as he learned about the whereabouts of
Baha'u'llah, he went and attained His presence in Karbila, a holy
city about fifty miles south of Ba&dad      where Baha'u'llah often
visited. Baha'u'llah was the guest of a believer who appointed
this youth to look after Baha'u'llah's comfort. Since it was summer
and hot, Mirza Aqa Jan states that Baha'u'llah used to have His
supper on the rooftop and sleep there which was customary and still
is. "So Baha'u' llah's brother, Muhammad-Quli , and I sprinkled water
on the roof, swept it and spread the carpets.       Soon Baha'u'llah
came and talked to us and had His supper and retired for the night.
After He fell asleep, I spread my own bedding and slept for a short
time. A few hours after midnight, way before dawn, I got up and
went at a little distance to say my prayer when I saw Him rising
and walking towards me.    He told me, 'You, too, are awake! ' Then
He began to chant and pace back and forth until dawn." He states,
"With every word He uttered, I saw thousands of seas surging before
my face and with every step He took, I saw thousands of worlds
of incomparable splendor being unveiled to my eyes." Yes, he saw
a glimpse of glory and had the distinction of being, after
Abdu'l-Baha, one of the first to recognize Baha'u'llah as the
Promised One of all religions, and became His attendant, companion
and secretary forty years. He was ever ready since revelation
could come to Baha'u'llah at any time. He called himlAbd-i-hazir,
or the ever-ready servant. He recognized Baha'u'llah ten years
before His Declaration, and he was told to conceal it which he
said was very difficult.         The treacherous half-brother of
Baha'u'llah, Mirza Yahya, sensed the change in him and became
agitated.

Now we can go to Ahmad, who used to call the tablet revealed in
his honor the Tablet of the Nightingale of Paradise, never imagining
that it would be known as the Tablet of Ahmad throughout the world
for years to come. It was revealed for the world, but he was the
honored recipient of it. Ahmad spent a number of years in Ba&dad
and resided near Baha'u'llah's house.       Later after Baha'u'llah
left Ba&dad,  Baha'u'llah sent him the Tablet of Ahmad from Adrian-
ople, and instructed him to travel throughout Persia and give the
glad tidings of Baha'u'llah's declaration and station to the Babis
and others. When he was asked by the believers to tell them about
the events during the years he spent near Baha'u'llah, he said
the events were numerous and exciting, mostly joyous but some were
sad. Then his eyes welled up with tears and he said, "One day
as we were walking behind Baha'u'llah, an officer came to Him and
said, 'One of your followers has been murdered and his body was
thrown by the river.'    The Ancient Beauty told the officer, 'He
was not murdered, but through seventy thousand veils of light to
an extent smaller than a needle's eye, We showed him the Glory
of God, and he could no longer bear the burden of this life and
he ended his own life; he was not murdered."'

This believer, to whom     Baha'u'llah gave the title of Dhabih, or
Sacrifice, was no less a   person than the erudite calligrapher Siyyid
Isma'il-i-Zavari'i, the    nobleman who converted Nabil, the writer
of The Dawn-Breakers.      This was the version related by Ahmad.

Let us go to the words of Nabil and see what did Isma'il experience
and how did the Kingdom of Glory look like. Isma'il was a dedicated
teacher. He became a Babi when he met the Bab in Isfahan, and
more than a decade later attained the presence of Baha'u'llah in
Ba&dad.    He was instructed by the Blessed Beauty to transcribe
the mighty book of the Bab, Qayyumu'l-Asma, in his beautiful
handwriting. Meanwhile, Nabil, who had been on teaching assignment
in Iran, had returned when Baha'u'llah advised him to help Isma'il
proofread the new transcription. Nabil states, "It took us eighteen
days to do it, and I knew that every night after midnight, Isma'il
would sweep the approaches to Baha'u'llah's house, using his green
turban and gather the dust in his cloak and release it in the Tigris
river. He did not wish anything unclean to touch the holy dust
where Baha'u'llah had walked."     So one day Nabil asked Isma'il,
'1

Tell me about your experience."   At first Isma'il was hesitant
but with the anxious look in Nabil's face, he could no longer
withhold this information from his spiritual son. His eyes filled
with tears as he related this story. "One day I was in the presence
of Baha'u'llah as a guest of a believer.     Baha'u'llah put fruit
and cookies in a plate and handed it to me when I begged Him for
spiritual sustenance and He said, 'It already has been given to
you.' From then on different doors of understanding were opened
to me and I entered a different world.      One evening when among
other believers I was in His presence, as usual, I was in my own
wonderment. He asked for a candle to peruse a paper and suddenly
it occurred to me, 'Is it possible that the visage, the sight of
which the Chosen Ones and Messengers of God have longed for, could
be unveiled in a human temple?' Baha'u'llah addressed me and said,
'Isma'il, look!' What I saw when I gazed upon His blessed face,
I cannot describe. It seemed like one hundred thousand sunlit
and shimmering seas billowing upon that face and I don't recall
what happened next."    Then Isma'il told Nabil, "Don't every ask
for this and be grateful for what He has given you.     Let us pray
for each other's happy ending."

Nabil writes that Isma'il continued his sweeping and then he came
to such a state of agony that he could not eat any longer. For
forty days he fasted and then on that final day before dawn, he
swept the approaches to Baha'u'llah's house for the last time,
and to check the crushing force of his love, he walked outside
the city gate, went by the river and laid down facing toward
Baha'u'llah's house and cut his throat with a razor.    He saw a
glimpse of Glory through seventy thousand veils of light to an
extent smaller than a needle's eye and was dazzled by it.    This
was that inner light which was concealed within the Holy Being
of Baha'u'llah. One wonders what were those shimmering and sunlit
seas. No one can fathom it. Is it possible that these shimmering
lights are the glowing souls of true believers plunged in the sea
of light in the world of mysteries?.

No one could guess that the writer of these events, the most great
Nabil, or Nabil-i-A'zam, more than three decades later would follow
in the footsteps of his teacher Isma'il.      Nabil was a shepherd
with a pure soul and constantly in search of truth.      He learned
about the Faith from Isma'il and became a Babi. He met Baha'u'llah
for the first time in 1850 in Tehran, the year of the martyrdom

of the Bab. You recall that before the martyrdom of the Bab, great
disciples such as the gentle and incomparable Quddus, indomitable
Mulla Husayn, and erudite Vahid were martyred, and then the
Martyrdom of the Bab was the final blow which left a community
quite confused and dispirited.       Nabil, like twenty-four other
Babis, had the delusion that he was the one whom God shall make
manifest, the station of Baha'u'llah.       So he disseminated his
writings and then he went to the presence of Baha'u'llah in Ba&dad.
Immediately, like most of the twenty-four people, he realized his
delusion and prostrated at the feet of Baha'u'llah and begged for
forgiveness. To show further his repentance, he shaved his beard,
which in those days was a symbol of man's dignity, and made a brush
of it and swept the entrance to Baha'u'llah's house with it.

He was a gifted poet and a fluent writer. So intense was his love
for Baha'u'llah that those who came in contact with him could feel
the fire of love burning in his soul.       He finished the history
to the point of the Ascension of Baha'u'llah about a century ago,
and Abdu'l-Baha chose him to compile selections from the writings
of Baha'u'llah which is known as the Tablet of Visitation.       No
longer could he stand the fire of separation from his Lord so he
quenched the fire by drowning himself in the sea. These two
moth-like lovers, who with uncontrollable urge threw themselves
into the flame of their love, and against His injunction ended
their own lives, were forgiven and honored by Baha'u'llah and

Abdu'l- Baha, and thus allowed to plunge into the sea of light
in the World of Mysteries in that Placeless World.

This Nabil reminds me of the other Nabil. Nabil means noble or
learned. Baha'u'llah called the historian Nabil-i-A'zam, or Most
Great Nabil, and the other one, Nabil-i-Akbar, Great Nabil. Both
are Apostles of Baha'u'llah, so designated by the Guardian. Nabil-
i-Akbar was the most learned man of his time, a prodigy among the
scholars. He is also known as Fadl-i-Qa'ini, means learned one
of Qain, a title from Baha'u'llah, Who also revealed the Tablet
of Wisdom, or Lawh-i-Hikmat, in his honor.      He was instrumental
in converting the great scholar, Mirza Abu'l-Fadl.   He was of such
erudition and eloquence that Haji Mirza Haydar- Ali states that
if he said water was hot and dry and fire was wet and cold, might
as well accept it and don't argue with him. With words he could
convince you.

He was secretly a Babi when he finished his extensive education
in theology schools in Najab, gaining the highest doctorate degree
in Islam which is ijtihad. He heard of Baha'u'llah as a Babi
nobleman who had been put in prison, whose property was confiscated,
and who was living in exile in Ba&dad.

He went to visit Baha'u'llah before returning to Iran. Baha'u'llah
treated him with honor and respect and hosted him at His own house.
By his own account, the humility and self-effacement of Baha'u'llah
misled him so he felt superior to Baha'u'llah in every aspect.
At gatherings Nabil-i-Akbar would occupy the seat of honor and
discuss various subjects without giving anyone else, including
Baha'u'llah, a chance to speak. One afternoon at a gathering
arranged by Baha'u'llah, as usual he sat in the seat of honor and
Baha'u'llah sat in the middle of believers and poured tea with
His own hand. A question was asked and Nabil found everyone quiet
so, as usual, he began to elaborate. Only occasionally Baha'u'llah
would add a sentence or two. After awhile, Baha'u'llah took over
the discussion and when Nabil-i-Akbar heard the outpourings of
His wondrous and overpowering words, he was dumbfounded and realized
his own weakness.

Nearly in a state of daze and fainting, he lost his sense of hearing
and only with his eyes could see that Baha'u'llah was still
speaking. He states that he felt so ashamed of his pride and taking
the seat of honor that he wished to run for the door, but like
a sparrow in the claws of a mighty falcon, he could not make a
move until Baha'u'llah's blessed lips stopped to move. Then he
dashed out, and, by his own account, hit his head three times
against the wall in repentance for his blindness. With this glimpse
of Baha'u'llah's might and power, Nabil became the embodiment of
certitude and served the Faith in Iran quite well. He died in
1892, the year of the Ascension of Baha'u'llah.          Abdu'l-Baha
gave him the title of Hand of the Cause, and stated, "That star,
Nabil, will shine forever from the horizon of abiding light."

We stayed in Ba&dad   too long, and if we stay any longer we might
get caught in the present-day turmoil. Let us go and meet other
believers in later times. How about Adrianople? No, I won't tell
you all the stories of those five years, but only one story of
the final year. You better brace yourself because it will tell

you about the most intense glimpse of Glory every recorded in
history.

It was towards the end of His stay in Adrianople when one day,
Baha'u'llah told the believers, "Today We wrote something to
Nasiri'd-Din Shah (king of Iran) but who will bell the cat?'' A
Persian sayingfor who will accept the daring task of delivering
His tablet to the Shah. Many seasoned veterans volunteered for
the distinction of delivering it even if it meant certain death.
But He said the messenger is not created yet.

At this time, Aqa Buzurg, the son of a survivor of the defense
of Fort Z a y k h Tabarsi, was about fifteen or sixteen years old.
He was a rebxlious and unruly lad whose father was not proud of
him and thought nothing would move him. He worried about his son.
They lived in Nishapur in northeast Iran a few thousand miles away
from Adrianople.

When Nabil, the historian, on assignment to travel throughout Iran
visited the father whom he knew, and read the poetries of Qasidiy-
i-Varqa'iyyih Baha'u'llah composed during the two years of seclusion
in Sulaymaniyyih about His own sufferings, the young lad's face
flushed and he began to cry loudly.     His father was quite amazed
and delighted and considered it like a spell cast by Nabil, but
only if he could see the Hand of Providence at work.       Within a
few months, the young lad with blessings of his father, left for
Ba&dad,   and found his way to Akka.      This was when Baha'u'llah
was confined in a cell in the barracks in Akka. He had no way
to inquire about Baha'u'llah without being recognized so he went
for prayer in a mosque where he saw a few Persians and he recognized

Abdu'l-Baha.   He handed a note to Abdu'l-Baha who made arrange-
ments for him to meet his Lord. You are watching the Will of
Baha'u'llah at work to create the messenger.

The seventeen-year-old    Aqa Buzurg had two audiences with
Baha'u'llah.   As you know, he is known as Badi, meaning new or
wonderful. Baha'u'llah praised Badi in many of His tablets. I
will paraphrase some of His words. In one place, He stated that
when He summoned Badi to His presence, He uttered but one word
which caused Badi's whole being to tremble and had it not been
for the divine protection, he would have swooned away. Then the
Hand of Power began to recreate him.

In another passage, He states that He took a handful of dust, mixed
it with the water of might and power, breathed into it a new spirit,
and adorned it with the name of Badi, and sent him out as a ball
of fire. He states that so great was the infusion of this might
that, single and alone, he could have conquered the world.
A spiritual giant was born.
And what did Badi do after his intense exposure to the Kingdom
of Glory? He became the embodiment of certitude and fortitude,
and with great joy carried the tablet close to his heart. For
four months with great joy he traversed the mountains and deserts
on foot. Every so often along the way he would go on the side
of the road and prostrate towards Akka and would say, "0 Lord,
what you have given me through your bounty, do not take away through
your justice. Give me strength to safeguard it."

With utmost bravery he delivered the tablet into the king's hands
and for three days withstood the tortures of branding and bastinado.
Do you think he cried out or implored for mercy when his flesh
sizzled with hot branding irons? No, never! The only sound heard
from him was that of laughter until his skull was crushed. He
laughed because the sea of light was only one step away and they
were melting the cage of his body to release his soul. That is
the state of ecstasy that all martyrs experience before martyrdom.

Wasn't it just nine years ago when eighteen-year-old Mona, so
intoxicated with the love of Baha'u'llah that in spite of severe
abuse and torture she refused to recant her faith, and with a smile
kissed the hangman's rope and placed the noose around her own tender
neck?

Mona's father, Yadu'llah Mahmudnizhad, that kind and gentle
Auxiliary Board member, also fell into the clutches of those blood-
thirsty descendants of the torture-mongers of Persia. He was so
badly beaten up that he could not be recognized.      On that final
and only visit the two had in the prison, he told her, "My beloved
daughter, do you remember when we used to move, how I always would
go first and prepare the house for you and the family. This time
also I will go first to the Abha Kingdom and will unroll the red
carpet for your grand entry." These blessed souls in that state
of ecstasy felt the presence of Baha'u'llah, and saw the sea of
light, and with great joy offered up their lives in His path.

--
Baha'u'llah called Badi, Fakhru'sh-Shuhada  (the pride of martyrs),
and also the Salt of My ~ablets. Haji Mirza Haydar- Ali, surnamed
by    Abdu'l-Baha as the Angel of Carmel, also had a glimpse of
the Kingdom of Revelation for which he finds no words or terms
adequate enough to describe.        However, he describes Badi's
experience and exposure to the Kingdom of Glory exceeding that
of others and resulting in an ecstasy which lasted throughout those
final four months of his mortal life.

Let us step outside the walled city of Akka and follow Baha'u'llah
to the Mansion of Mazra'ih. Here we have an over-zealous believer
who was somewhat demanding and had to be reminded. You see,
Baha'u'llah did not wish to perform, only through His bounty He
revealed His glory to the believers.

The twenty-three-year-old silver-tongued nightingale 'Ali-Muhammad-
i-Varqa, who eventually with his twelve-year-old son, Ruhu'llah,
drank the cup of martyrdom, attained the presence of Baha'u'llah
for the first time.       Though he had never seen Him before,
Baha'u'llah's face appeared familiar to him. He was losing sleep
trying to remember where he had seen Him before. A market place?
In a believer's gathering? He could get nowhere.           One day,
Baha'u'llah   told him, "Varqa, burn away the idols of vain
imaginings."   Suddenly he remembered his dream as a child. He
saw in his dream that he was playing in a garden with some dolls
when God arrived, and took the dolls and burned them in a fire.
When he woke up he told his parents about it, and they told him
firmly that no one could ever see God and he forgot all about it.
Yes, that was where he had seen Baha'u'llah!     Imagine, that time
Baha'u'llah was in Ba&dad    and chose that little boy and appeared
in his dream to make him an Apostle of Baha'u'llah and a Hand of
the Cause.

In a few days when at the presence of the Blessed Beauty and gazing
upon His countenance with adoration, a thought occurred to him
that he recognized Baha'u'llah as the Supreme Manifestation, and
how he wished that Baha'u'llah would show him a sign. Then a
sentence from the Qur'an came to his mind and he wished that
Baha'u'llah would mention it in the course of His conversation.
It didn't take too long before Baha'u'llah mentioned that verse.
Varqa became overjoyed, but he told himself, could this have been

a mere coincidence, when Baha'u'llah abruptly turned to him and
said, ''Inham kafi nabud? ," "Wasn ' t this sufficient enough proof
to you?'' Wow! He was dumbfounded. Shaken, but assured.
Baha'u'llah states in the soul-stirring Hidden Words revealed two
decades earlier: ''0 heedless ones! Think not the secrets of hearts
are hidden, nay, know ye of a certainty that in clear characters
they are engraved and are openly manifest in the holy Presence."
One wonders why some don't take heed. The next believer did not
take heed and he was zapped.
I told you that Baha'u'llah often showed a glimpse of His glory
and might to those who had recognized Him to strengthen their faith.
In Isfahan there was a believer, a prominent man who accepted
Baha'u'llah with his brain as the right prophet for today. He
was a new believer and tried hard to overcome his shortcomings,
like all of us, but had no success with his drinking habit, and
friends could smell alcohol on his breath. In defense, he would
state that his addiction was too dificult, and besides that, he
was harming no one, and he was too lowly a servant for Baha'u'llah
to be concerned about his privatge life. Then he had the bounty
of attaining the presence of Baha'u'llah.     One day when he was
among other believers and Baha'u'llah was pacing back and forth,
a thought occurred to him that it is true that Baha'u'llah is a
great Messenger of God, but he wondered what Baha'u'llah meant
when He stated, "I am the Sender of the Messengers and the Revealer
of the Books.''   He had not finished his thought when suddenly
Baha'u'llah walked to him, put His blessed hand on his shoulder,
and said, ''It is true, We are the Sender of the Messengers and
the Revealer of the heavenly ~ooks." (Stories of Baha'u'llah, by
Hand of the Cause A. A. Furutan, p. 74-5)

How do you like that for confirmation? Well, he was spellbound,
all right. He was zapped in his head with which he had accepted
Baha'u'llah.   Now, he became a true believer, and accepted Him
with his heart and every fiber of his being.      After his return
from pilgrimage believers could no longer smell alcohol on his
breath, and upon their inquiry he said, "If Baha'u'llah could read
my mind, He surely can see my actions." He is everywhere, omni-
present; and knows everything, omniscient.

Friends, what a bounty for those who had a glimpse of His glory
and might and lived during His days when a word, a smile, a look,
or His touch was enough to confirm and transform any believer,
and what a bounty for us to live in these glorious days, when
according to Abdu'l-Baha, the saints and holy ones of the past
ages yearned with tearful eyes to live in this day if even for
a moment. He calls this century the 'Century of Light.'

One century ago Baha'u'llah ascended. The lamp of His physical
being is no longer with us, but His light and spirit surround us.
To have recognized Him is not enough. We need to become true
believers. When we enlist in the army of light and adorn ourselves
with the name "Baha'i," we become a special spiritual entity like
a candle created from a tub of wax. The exaltation of the candle
comes only when it is enkindled; otherwise, it is just a piece
of wax sitting idle in one corner.       Our exaltation comes when
we turn to His writings, giving our total submission to His Covenant
and arise to serve His Cause. Then we attain the station of a
true believer, fulfilling the requirements specified by Abdu'l-
Baha. He states that the true believer is the one who says it
with the tongue, feels it in the heart, and shows it with action.
(Baha'i World, Volume VI, p. 483)

What a lofty station awaits a true believer.       I wish to end my
talk with these comforting words of Baha'u'llah.

Such is the station ordained for the true believer that
> if to an extent smaller than a needle's eye the glory
> of that station were to be unveiled to mankind, every
> beholder would be consumed away in his longing to attain
> it."

And then it follows with these confirming words of Baha'u'llah.

> "If the veil be lifted and the full glory of the station
> of those who have turned wholly towards God, and in their
love for Him have renounced with world, be manifest, the

.

> entire creation would be dumbfounded "

(World Order of Baha'u'llah, p. 108)
