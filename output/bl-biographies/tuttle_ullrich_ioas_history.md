## Part of the Baha'i History of the Family of Charles and Maria Ioas

> **Background:** I was a summer employee at the Bosch School in California 1978-1984. Early during that period - I think in 1979 - Monroe Ioas, a younger brother of the Hand of the Cause Leroy Ioas, during a visit to Bosch gave me this document prepared by himself and other members of the Ioas family. It is mentioned in the Foreword to Anita Ioas Carpenter's book _Leroy Ioas - Hand of the Cause of God_: "Many years ago two daughters of Charles and Maria Ioas, Marguerite Ullrich and Viola Tuttle, compiled their mother's memories of the experiences of the Ioas family with Abdu'l-Bahá in Chicago in 1912. This proved invaluable as family history. It was augmented in 1978 with help from the other three surviving siblings of Leroy Ioas: Monroe, Paul and Joseph." \[Brent Poirier, 2017\]

PROLOGUE

For a long time I have felt that someone should record the

/
exper iences of the Ioas   fa~ily   with ' Abdu'l-Baha, particularly since the
number of people who met Him during Hi s visit to America in 1912       i ~;   rapidly
decreasing, and the new Baha'is have little opportunity to t alk with anyone
who lived through those blessed days.       'Abdu'l-Bah:i said that He loved our
whole family from top to bottom, and Shoghi Effendi , the Guardian, said
that ours was the most important family in America .      This is repeated in
great humility and is explained as follows:

When Leroy was living in Haifa, someone in the family wrote
him concerning a statement that seemed to be going around about the Ioas
family , and he responded as follows:

"Shoghi Effendi's reference to our family in connection
with the Bolton family of Australia, was as follows:

"When the Boltons were here at dinner one night, they
> said how wonderful it was to be in the Holy Land and sitting
> with the Guardian at thE~ same time with the Io as' s from Ameri ca.
> The Guardian said that i n the Holy Land, the most important
> family in Australia was united wit h the most important family
> in America. He spoke then of the teaching work done by both
> families, and that is the importance , no other-- that they an~
> both families where all are active in the Faith, and accom-
> plishing .much for it . At another time the question came up of
> the wonderful work done by the Fozdars in India, and then later
> on, in pioneering. He spoke of them as the most important
> family in India. I think, although I am not sure, someone
> later brought up the matter, and he spoke of these three families
as being the most important in the countries where they reside, 111

The recording task seemed overwhelming, but my daughter
Florence .agreed to assist me .     We have accordingly recounted   brie~fly

some of the incidents with the various members of the family.

Margarite Ioas Ullrich

> '

On December 6, 1865, in Passau, Bavaria, twin girls were born to
Daniel and Rosa Werlein Reiser, one named Otillia and the other, Naria Bertha.
Hr. Reiser was killed in the Franco-Prussian War when the girls were three.       Hrs .
Reiser died when they were five, and Otillia was soon adopted by a Frenc:h countess.
Although the countess had promised not to take Otillia out of Germany, she soon
changed her mind and raised Otillia in Paris and elsewhere.

Maria went to Munich to live with her Aunt Theresa and Uncle Joseph
Nothaas and her older cousin, Nax.       This bright, brown-eyed little girl attended a
French kindergarten and learned to speak French and English as well as German .       It
is believed that Maria 1 s uncle was a type of steward to King Ludwig II .and had a
confidential pos ition with him.     When Ludwig was just a prince, Haria had been one
of his playmates.     Maria in later years related the event of her dancing as a young
girl the part of the wicked fairy in Sleeping Beauty in the palace before the King.

Maria was so lonely as a child that "when six years of age , she
would take all her dolls to bed with her, calling them her brothers and sisters ,
and often falling on the floor herself because her 'family ' took all the room !
She vowed then that when she grew up, she would have at least 12 children, so
none would ever be lonely."*

In 1880 the Nothaas came to visit America and brought Haria with
them .    She was 15 or 16 years old .   With the group was her cousin's college room-
mate, Karl Joas, who had just graduated from the University of Munich .

1,   In Hemoriam,.Baha'i World, Vol. XII, page 688.

Karl Joas (Charles Ioas) was born in Munich, Germany, on Narch 23,
1859.   Little is known of Karl's family except that he had one sister .       His uncle,

\
> Thomas Kommerzienvat, was one of th e twelve wealthiest men in Bavaria, owning
steamship lines, a brewery, and The Crown Jewelry Store.        This uncle left a sizable

inheritance to Karl , who sorely needed the money for his growing family, but he
would have had to return to Germany to live (the German government would not allow

,
> funds to be taken fror.1 the country), and this he would not do.      After World War I,
the legacy was gone.
I

When the trip to America was drawing to a close, and 'i>Ia1:ia 's aunt
> and uncle were about to return to Germany, Maria and Charles decided to Clarry and
> reo ain in America•    Although Mari:a had been reared a Catholic and Charles a Lutheran,
> they were married by a Methodist minister.       They wanted to start a new life in a
new country, as Charles frequently said "I am a citizen of the world. ff

Charles spoke seven languages and was a brilliant scholar .     He
> studied law with a judge in Kansas (who said that Charles was the most brilliant
> student he had ever had) and passed his Bar Examination at the age of 21, after
> which he practiced law.     He was also a Certified Public Accountant, and at one
> time worked with the Civil Service.      Later he was offered a Professorship at the
> University of Illinois, but declined because of his German accent, of which he
> was always conscious, although it was very slight.       }{aria had a profession too---
when the need arose, she set up her photography studio to help the family.

Charles' and Maria's travels were considerable in this country.
!

> They first lived in Russell, Kansas, where he studied law with the judge.         George,
> Arthur, and Rudolph were all born in the vicinity of Wichita, Kansas.         Pauline
> greeted the world in Willow Springs, Missour i.      The family also lived in Spring-
> field, Arkansas (near Little Rock) .     When Charles accepted a position i.n Chicago,
> Maria travelled on the train with their four little children, all under the age
of seven, to join him.   Their last six children were born in the Chicago area .

Actually, Naria's vow to have twelve children was fulfilled , as there we:ce two
more children who died either at birth or in early infancy .

During these years Otillia , Maria' s twin sis t er, was engaged to a
prominent and wealthy Austrian .     They were to honeymoon in America and visit Maria.
The sisters longed to see each other.      However, the valet of Otillia's fiance
found him in bed one morning several weeks before the wedding , dead of an apparent
heart attack.   In the following years, Otillia married a Parisian and had two
children.   She never came to America, and the sisters never met again.           Otillia
died at the age of 38.

Although Charles and Maria joined the Methodist church, they were
continually seeking something else to satisfy their spiritual needs.            Charles was
always buying books dealing with the interpretation of the Book of Revelation and
those which might help in his search fo r the return of Christ.

In 1896 two or three months before Leroy was born , Maria was sound
asleep, and a heavy pressure on her chest awakened her.      As she awoke and looked
up, a woman was leaning over her and had her two hands on Maria ' s chest.          She was
a beautiful woman , garbed like an angel, although Naria didn ' t see any wings.         As
she leaned over Maria , she said "I come again, I corae again , 11 and there were

little angels flying all around the room singing.      After she said        ! come again,"
everything gradually disappeared .    Haria was frightened and woke up Charles.

Maria dictated this story to one of her daughters in later years :

> "I was brought up a Catholic, but even as a chil d of ten years of age , I
> rebelled against certain things of the Catholic church ; for instance,
> telling of my inmost thought s ; in other wo rds , confessing, t o an entirely
> strange man . Yet I loved to go as a child in a big Catholic church. For
> inst ance, in the afternoon when no one else was in the church, I would
> love to go and just sit and meditate, as there was such a peace in t he
> church , so much so that I wished I could sit there all the time, but I
> made up my mind that when I could use my own will , I would never be a
> Catholic. I came to America, and we we r e married here by a l·Iethoclist
minister. Later we joined the Nethodist church , but I was never sat isf i ed .

"From the time I joined the ~ethodist church---for 17 years, I
prayed every day that I might find something that would satisfy me. It
seemed that every time I prayed for this light, a curtain hung before my eyes
and just behind the curtain was the thing for which I was seeking. So anxious
was I in my prayers and in my desire for this thing that oftentimes I would
try to push the curtain aside. When Father's !fother was still living,
probably at the age of 15 or 16, she would tell him that she would never
live to see Christ's return, but that he would. After being told t.his by
his mother, he also was always searching, reading, and looking for
Christ's return.

"In April, 1898, a friend invited us to some lectures which she
had attended. She seemed to be all aflame with the Message she received,
although she would not tell us anything about it, but just urged u~; to go
and hear for ourselves. Ny husband never cared for, as he called them,
'isms' and cults, but seeing her enthusiasm, he promised we would go to
hear Hr. Dealy, the gentleman who gave the lectures.

"The first lecture was on the soul, and Father was immediately
impressed with it . We both went again and again, and at the third or
fourth lesson, a prayer that Dr. Khayru'llah brought was given to each
one of us to use every day", and acertain line in that prayer 'And the
curtains were torn asunder and the faithful hurried to the lights of
their God, the Chosen One' seemed to be the direct answer to my prayer,
tearing asunder the curtain which was veiling me for so many years from
the things I was seeking. Altogether we attended 12 lectures consisting
of signs of the time, prophecies about the vineyard, etc. One les::ion
we were given prophecies to look up. The one in the Bible about Christ
preparing a feast and then no one came, and He told His disciples to
call them in from the highways and by-ways, I was the only one to decipher
correctly the meaning that people were being given the chance to accept
this truth, but were not accepting.

"It took nearly three months, one lesson a week to go through
the course. Mr. Dealy lived on the north side of the city, we on the
west side, one hour's ride on the street car, and as I was in a rather
delicate condition, it was difficult some of the evenings to go, but
the lessons were so in teres ting and the longing to know what the next         I
lesson would bring and the urge to go were irresistible, that we didn't
miss a lesson. And when at t he twelfth lesson Mr . Dealy told us that
God in His love and mercy for mankind had again manifested His Spirit
on earth in a human temple in Baha ' u'llah, there was a stillness in
t hat room---it seemed as if everyone's breath had stopped; it seemed
as if it was too much for our hearts to bear. I think we all forgot
that we were in Mr . Dealy's home . After a little while he told us
that Baha'u'llah had ascended to His Kingdom , but He left with us His
son, 'Abdu'l-Bah~, as the Exemplar of the Baha'i Faith.

"In the early days of this Faith, it was customary for the·
friends who accepted the Baha'i Teachings to write a supplication to
'Abdu '1-Baha, acknowledging this Truth and also asking for accepta.nce.
I asked Hr. Dealy if I might take a copy of the form letter home to
write to 'Abdu' 1-Baha", but he said I would have to write the lettE!r
at his house, so shortly before midnight [July 6, 1898}, my husband
and I wrote our letter to 'Abdu'l-Baha, and then went home, so tired,
but oh, so happy.

0ne of the most interesting and peculiar incidents in all this
> was that at the time I was going to these lessons, I was expecting a baby
> (our ninth child), and at the time, I was quite ill, and I would have to
> rest all day in oraer to attend the lecture that evening, Each evening
> Mr. Dealy would ask me if I thought I would be over for the next one. I
> always answered, 'If I am able, I certainly wd.11.' I was able to attend
> all the lessons, and at the last lesson about midnight, we wro te our
> letter to 'Abdu 'l-Baha, as was the custom, accepting this great Truth ,
> and then returned home. Later in the morning I was quite ill and called
> the doctor, and he informed me that he was sure my baby would not live
> when it came as it was turned around the wrong way . I felt dreadful
> about this, feeling badly all day. About 5 : 00 that night, I again called
> the doctor , and after looking at me, he said, 'Something wonderful has
> happened , and your baby \·Till be all right. It has turned around i ts elf,
> and it will now be a natural bi rth.' For a long time after this , the
baby (Margarite Hope) was called 'the Dealy baby .'

"Only those accepting the Truth in the class were we two and
> Hr . Hoffman. There were also classes on the south side consisting of
Hr. Jones and Hr. Chase.

"'Abdu' l-Karim told Mr. Khayru'llah , a Syrian , about the~
> teachings, and he brought them to America and started classes. Now,
> however , he has turned against 'Abdu'l-Baha, although he really did a
wonderful work bringing the Teachings over to America.

"I realized then that my prayers had been answered, and this was
what I had always been looking for, and so did Father."

The Charles Ioas family was very large.     There were twe l ve
children.      Two of ther.1 died in infancy .   The first one was Carl, but he did not
live .     Then George, Arthur, Rudolph , Esther who died at birth , Pauline, Viola,
Leroy, Margarite, Nonroe, Paul, and Joseph.

> Again in Maria ' s words:
> "I had to stay pretty close to home taking care of my family , but
> my husband would go to the meetings and tell us all about them. One
> evening he brought home a very small piece of an envelope (the first raail
> from Acea). The House of Spirituality had cut the envelope into small
> pieces and given each one of the friends who were at the meeting a piece---
> what a treasure! I still have our piece . How happy the friends were
> when one of them would receive a Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Baha and share
its contents with others .

Father had always been a Bible student , had read the Bible
> in Greek, and in the evenings we studied and took up prophecies, but
> what a difference in reading the Bible after we had the key and could

{
understand---such wonderful evenings. He started a class and the chil-
dren would sit and listen, and so they just grew up with this great Faith.i:

When I was young, I attended the Hethodist church .    As you know,
one of the first teachings of Baha'u'llah is to investigate religion for yourself.
And so when we were children, we attended the various churches in the town where
we lived, but at the same time we learned about the Laha' {Teachings at home.               I
can still see all of us sitting around our big dining room table listening to my
father explaining the Bible .         One verse in particular still rings in my ears :
:'llFor I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the        latt1~r   day upon
the earth. 11     ~<

In 1900 a tablet came to Father from 'Abdu!l-Baha:

To the honorable Hr. C. Ioas---
110    thou who hast advanced toward God!

By God, I rejoiced when reading thy letter which declares
> thy belief in the unity of God and thine acknowledgment of the appear-
> ance of the Kingdom of God . This is a matter whereby thy face shall
> brighten in the Supreme Concour se, and thy forehead shall sparkle
> among the people. Then know the worth of this gift, the lights of
> which shone forth unto all directions and indicate the attraction
> of th~ Concourse of El- Abha, the Host Glorious. Then be finn in
> this Cause, and thou wilt behold thyself in a lofty station , having
> all that is in earth under its shadow, because , this is verily that
> gift which is mentioned in the Gospel . 0 how good is this bounty in
> this day , when the commemor ation of the true God is published and
spread in all directions!
El-Baha be upon thee! 11

Star of the West, Vol . IX,pp.78-9

Father had the great bounty and honor of being on the f irs t
Spiritual Assembly, called the House of Spirituality, in Chicago, which was
formed in the year 1901.         He and Mr . Albert Windust were appointed in 1903
to compose the letter to 'Abdu'l-Baha asking permission to build a           Ma~~riqu'l-

.:                           After the first convention thls t ablet came from 'Abdu'l.-Baha;·

Through Dr. Fareed,
to the Secretaries of the .Convention
of Delegates from the Mashrek-el-Azkar,
Charles Ioas and Gertrude Buikema
Chicago.

HE IS GOD!
"O ye two candles of the Meeting of the Friends!

,
The conventions were held yearly, and work progressed as has been
detailed elsewhere .

Mother wanted 'Abdu'l-Baha to name her last baby, born in 1907. As
> the. mai.ls were   very slow, it was frequently six months to one year beforei a r eply
> wa·s received.     She wondered if He had even received her letter.              In the oeantime
> the sewing circle to which Hother belonged kept asking why the baby wasn't named.
> When he was quite a few months old and still wasn 't named, they said they were
> going to name him, so Mother said they could give him a second name , which they
did.    They selected the name of Clyde, the name of the town where we lived.

All the time Mother was waiting for the name from 'Abdu' 1-Baha,
> she was a little apprehensive, thinking that               ~n   all probability it would be a
> Persian name.      The people in the town liked the Ioas family, but they always
> spoke of us as the people with the queer religion .                 If the baby had a Persian
> name, they would surely think it was quee r.               Interestingly enough, the women of
> the Ladies' Aid Society always asked Hother to give the prayer at their meetings
because they loved the Baha ' i pray(?.rs.
The reply eventually came from ' Abdu 'l-Baha, and the first thing

which :Mother saw was,        11
Name thy dear baby Joseph . 11   The other boys all had             Charles 11

for a middle name, and Joseph later changed the name of "Clyde" to                        Charles. 11

The whole Tablet seemed to be an admonition forjche members of the
family to work for the Faith.              I quote it herewith:

Hother always wished that she might have a little flower whi ch
' Ab du ' 1-Bah~ had held in His hands .      m1en Mr . and Hrs . Agnew went to Acea in 1907,
Hother went to say good-bye.          She had planned to ask them to bring her a flower
which ' Abdu ' l-Ilah& had been holding, but on the streetcar going acros s t own, she
changed her mind.        How could she be so audacious as to ask for a flower!           She
felt that ' Ab du' l - Baha knew how s he wo uld treasure a flower from Him , and when
she was deserving of it, she would get one.                She didn 't know how, but she was
sure when s he was worthy, she would ge t one.              So she did not mention it to Nrs .
Agnew.

And then in 1912 our Beloved l·1as ter, ' Abdu ' 1-Baha, came. to Chicago.

Can we ever for get thos e heavenly days?          The f amily went many times to see Him ,
and these are a few incidents I would like to relate. ·
Mo ther tells this story:

The first day that ' Abdu 'l-Bah~ was in Chicago, I went with
> Monroe (one of my children), then a small boy, to the Plaza Hotel to
> see Him. ' Abdu'l-Baha was out , so we waited fo r Him all afternoon.
> We were in the hall when He came out of the elevator, and He g reE~ted
> us with much love , and then walked towa r d His room and said , •·come ,
> come,' beckoning to us as He spoke. I knew He was tired, and so
> hesitated to follow, but He again turned , and beckoning , said, 'Come ,
> come.' I said to one of the interpreters, ''Abd u'l- Bah~ is so t ired ,
> and it is enough that we have seen Him.' He replied, 'When 'Abdu '1-
> Baha says ' Come,' you ' d better come. ' And so we followed Him to His
> reception r oom. In a few minutes He came out of His room with some
> roses . He walked over to where I was sitting and handed me a ro:>e.
> Re lo oked at me with those eyes that could read one's very heart .
> There was no need of His telling me ,' This is the flower you have wished
> for many ye ars . ' He then gave Monroe, Hrs. Ge tsinger, and 1ir . Hil ls a
rose also. 11

One day at the home of a Baha'i in Ohio, where Mothe r was speaking,
> she told the story of 'Abdu ' l - Bah£ and the rose.     Hrs. Robinson, who was a poet,
> sent Mother this poem which she had composed.

BALLAD OF A FLOWER

by
Gertrude W. Robinson
You ask, What gift may you bring to me

From that far, eastern Shore
ffQere the dream of nations is cradled? What gift

From the Threshold of Beauty's door?
Ah - - - could you but bring me a little flower

That has grown in that far land
Where Carmel has known His Presence? A f lower

That drops from the Master's hand?
Yet no!  Love asks no gift save this:

To cherish the certitude
Of living faith that makes one staunch

Through every vicissitude.
Bring me no gift . The joys I have known

In the years <>f faith I have spent
Are the only blossoms I need, my friend.
With these I am more than content.

*   *     *    *    *    *
The years have passed. The Master is here.

From the far, far East. HE~ came
To bless a western w<>rld with the light

Of the Glory of God's fair Name !
He is here in our midst. He stops at the inn.

My heart, beat not:fso wild!
I shall hasten there to ~ee Him pass

I and my littl e child .
Here, my son, we shall take our stand .

He comes through the portal door!
Ah, heart, bow down --- He is passing near
1                          How can one ask for more?
But the servant pausE~S. He beckons, 11 Come ! "

Yet the Master bears the trace
Of weariness. I shall not go .

Enough to have seen His Face .
The 1'1 aster Himself is beckoning, "Come!"

While His eyes are searching mine,
And I cannot delay. I yield my will

And follow, as to a shrine.
Majestic, yet humble, the Haster walks

Through corridors to His room
And pauses in thought before a vase

Where varied clusters bloom .
He is choosing one --- He turns to me

How can I bear this hour?
In a holy hush, I hear His Voice,

"Beloved, here is your flower!"

We have the recent words of Honroe telling about that incident

/
when. he met 'Abdu'l-Baha:

"I went with Mother one afternoon to the Plaza Hotel to see
> ' Abdu ' l-Baha. He was out at the time so Mother and I waited in the hall.
> When He got off the elevator, He greeted Hother and kissed me on the
> forehead. Of course, I will always remember this as it made a profound
> impression on me. Naturally I wouldn't remember anything that was said---
> even people who were adults at the time mostly do not remember His :remarks,
> but rather impressions and words later published. It is hard to differ-
> entiate between memories and what we have learned from history and the
> written word. As you read the Bah£'{ Hagazine of Fall ' 71, you see ruost
> of the Baha'is of that time just remember impressions, not words. Hy
> greatest impression of Him is as of a Giant, pacing back and forth on
> the stage, admonishing and teaching mankind . We are and have been a

lucky family . 11

In talks throughout America Leroy has reported the following incident
of the first time he and Father went to see 'Abdu' 1-Bana"

"The first day ' Abdu 'l-13ah8: was in Chicago , He was staying at
> the Plaza Hotel on the north side of Chicago. My father and I, then a
> boy of 16 years of age, started out the morning the Bahais had the word
> that the !:-laster was going to receive the friends. We went to the Hotel
> on the elevated train, and as we got close to the north side , changed
> to go on the northside elevated. There were a number of other Baha'{s
> on the t rain, and we go t off and started to walk . Suddenly I said , ' We've
> got to hurry or we are going to miss the Master, ' and so we started to
> hurry along, and my father said to me, 'How do you know we are going to
> miss the Master? Do you know if He has an engagement that we are late
> for or anything, that He is going somewhere? ' I said, 'No, I don ' t,
but I know if we don't hurry, we will miss the Master. 1

"Then we entered the Plaza Hotel , and I said, 'Let's hurry,
> the Master is going out the other side . ' Nind you, I had never seen the
hotel and didn ' t know where it was and nothing about its construction.

I said, 'The Master . is going out the other side, let's hurry.' Hy
> father said , 'How do vou know He is going out, did you see Him down
> there?' I said, ' No.' He said, 'Did you see any Persians with thcair
> turbans and so on?' I said, 'No.' He said , 'Well , how do you know
> that the Naster is going out?' I said, ' He is going out the other
door, and I know it because I saw the light. '

"We hurried down and sure enough , there were two entranc.es,
> and we hurried down to the other one - out the other entrance, and the
> Master was just getting into the automobile to go to deliver His lecture
at the Hull House which you have read so many times.

"As we stood agains t the building while He was in there, He
> suddenly mot ioned to us to come - come up to the machine, and I recall
> as we stepped forward the power, the spiritual radiance,the light· -
> flashes that came emanating from His person were such that I was com-
> pletely overcome and overpowered and fainted . But after we approa·:hed
> gradually, and I came to, we approached and there wss this great light
> shining through Him and all you saw was a physical structure, outlining
> as it were a vehicle through which the powe r of the Spirit was flowing
> and flowing continuously, and I recalled as I walked up and finally
> took His hand, I felt it and f elt it to see if He was human like the
rest of ours. Well, that was a terrific experience ."

Another day Father and Leroy went to visit ' Abdu 'l-Baha and had
> another very interesting experience.   Again we quote from a talk that Leroy gave,
> this one at a farewell party given at the Bah.a '{ House of Worship in Wilme tte,
> Illinois, by the National Spiritual Assembly for the Leroy Ioas family on Saturday,
> March 8, 1952, on the eve of Leroy ' s departure to take up residence in Haifa (his
wife , Sylvia, was to follow at a later date):

"I recall another little instance which I shall tell, one
> experience I had on another visit to the Naster in the Plaza Hotel.
> We were going there, and I decided I would like to buy Him some flowers,
> so I went in a florist shop. I didn't have much money, but I bought Him
> a beautiful bouquet of white carnations. I am very partial to carnations,
> particularly white. I bought this big bouquet of white carnations, and
> after we approached the hotel and got into the raain floor, I said to my
> father, 'I am just not going to bring the i-Iaster these flowers . ' He
'I        said, 'Why not? I don 't understand you, the Master loves flowers.' I

> said, 'I know He does, but I am not going to bring them' So under
> pressure, he asked why , and I said, 'I come to the Mas ter offering Him
> my heart and I don't want Him to think that I am currying any favors.
> He knows the condition of a person's heart, and that is all I have to
> offer .' My father took the flowers and went upstairs, and he handed
> them to the Master, and the Master sat talking, feeling those flowers,
> smelling them, putting His face into them , and those of you who
> remember seeing the Haster and how He loved flowers, know how He would
> always bury His head right into them and smell the fragrance. With
> this, He gave this beautiful talk. I don 't know very much what it
was about because I was so fascinated with His person .

As often as I had the opportunity to be in the Master 1 s
> presence, I didn't know very much about what He talked at the time '
> because His person was so remarkable. Features, His features, His
> eyes were the most dynamic thing you ever saw. They were always
> changing color. They never were the same. Some time they were very
> patient, other times they were full of fire, and sometimes they were.
> full of vigor. I saw Him once when His eyes we re filled with the
> wrath of God, but His eyes were never the same. Once He turned His
> eyes on you and looked at you square in the face, you knew He had
read your very soul, even before it existed.

In any event, the Master gave this beautiful talk and after
> He finished, He stood up shaking hands with everyone, and to everyone
> He gave one of these white carnations . He shook hands with them and
> gave them a white carnation, shook hands with the next one and gave
> him a white carnation; shook hands with the next one and gave him a
> white carnation . These white carnations were ge tting to be very few,
> and I was standing behind 'Abdu' 1-Baha, and He had three or four le: ft ,
> and I thought, 'Gee, I wish He would turn around and shake hands with
> me before those are all gone.' Just as I thought that, He turned
> around and looked at me, and He had a beautiful red rose . He pulled
> this red rose off His coat and handed it to me . As He did so , some
> of the blood of His finger was cut on the pin, so that I have that
> red rose with the Master's blood on it . 11

Mo ther or Father or bo th went to the Plaza Hotel many times,
always taking along one or two of the children and sometimes a neighbor's child
(none of whom ever accepted the Faith).     I was just a girl of 13 when ' Abdu 'l-
Baha- was in Chicago, and I can remember distinctly the first time my mother took
me to a meeting where He was going to speak.     The pe.o ple were all waiting for Him
to arrive, and when He entered the room and came close to me , I wan ted to fall at
His feet, bu t instead I did what all t he others did , and that was to arise.

On one particular day Mother went, I went along.      There were
other children there that day , and 'Abdu'l-Bah~ called us all into His sitting

\
room and seated Himself on the divan.     We children grouped ourselves around His
knees, and lie covered us with His outstretched arms, His mantle falling over us
like t wo wings, shielding and protec ting us from all harm.    I was 13 at the time
and had been attending tne Nethodist Sunday School.     We used to sing a song that
impressed me very much .   I had thought how wonderful it would .be if such a thing

happened to me.     This song is what came to my r:iind as we knelt at 'Abdu' 1-Baha' s
feet, and I thought "it's really happening to me!"
"I think when I read that sweet story of old,

How when Jesus ~·1as here amongst men,
How Ha called little children as lambs to His fold;

I would like to have been with Him then.
I wish that His hands had been placed on my head,

That His arms had been thrown around me ,
And that I might have heard His kind words when He said,

'Let the little ones come unto He . "'

Not her said it reminded her of a quo tat ion from the       Bible~,
"Suffer the little children to come unto t·fe, and forbid them not , for of such
is the Kingdom of heaven ."     *

Paul has written r ecently:

Yes, I saw ' Abdu 'l-Bah8: . Two incidents stund out in my mind. One was
> at the Hotel Plaza. He were in a large room, and several other youngste rs
> and myself sat at His feet. As I reraer.iber, Ile, 'Abdu'l-Baha , was sitting
> on a chair and several youngsters including me,sat on the floor , about 2
> or 3 on each side of Hira. Am quite sure a picture was not taken . I don't
> remember what 'Abdu'l-Baha sa:id , if anything, but I always remember Ahmad
> Schrab as His interpreter. I can see ' Abdu ' l-Baha talking with Ahmad
> Schrab at His side . Schrab always seemed to frighten me a little .

> r:The other incident was in a quite large church. I was sitting up
> towards the front near the pulpit. I suppose the rest of the family
> was there also. The church was packed with people. Suddenly there
> was complete silence . Everyone stood up and 'Abdu'l-Baha came walking
> down the aisle with His interpreters. The awe and respect were so
> great , you could have heard a pin fall as He walked up on the platforn
> with the interpreters. I don't remember anything He said but that
> incident always stood out in my mind. The quietness that came over
> that huge throng of people was really something."

Mother was always concerned because she was so busy         raisi~ng    her
large family that she didn't have much time to teach, and besides , she didn't
think she was capable of teaching the Faith .           One day when in the presence of
' Abdu'l-Baha , she said, '" Abdu '.1-Baha, what can I do to serve the Faith?"             He
replied, "Teach , teach," and she replied,       11              " I can't teach . "

'Abdu'l-Baha,                       He
replied:      "The earth brings forth nothing of itself, but God causes the sun
to shine and rain to fall upon the earth , and it becomes fruitful, so you too
~'   Luke 18: 16

can teach. 11   Then He told her there are many ways of teaching the Faith, and one
way is to live the life.

On another occasion when Mother went to see 'Abdu'l-Baha one of
her grandchildrgn, a baby girl, was very sick, and they didn't know what was wrong
with her, and so she told 'Abdu'l-Baha about it.            He said to Mother, "The baby
will be healed! 11        And so she was.    The doctor finally discovered what was wrong
with the baby.       irnen the   baby~itter   had given her the bottle, she hadn't tried
the milk to ,s ee whether it was too hot.          It was, and it scalded the baby's
throat.    'Abdu'l-Bah~ named the baby Mariam.

One of the boys, Arthur, took his wife and daughter, Althea, to
a gathering where 'Abdu'l-Baha was.            During the course of the evening, 'Abdu'l-
Baha asked Eleanor if she were a Baha'i, and she said that she wasn't. 'Abdu'l-

/ ,.
Bah-a told her that she was a Baha'i, and from that moment on, Eleanor always

/
considered herself as a Bah~'{.             'Abdu'l-Baha took Althea on His knee and gave
her the name of Shireen (Sweet).            The family moved to California after t he birth
of their son, Arthur Jr., and has done much teaching.

In former years among the Baha ' i s the Ioas f ami ly was l ik•aned to
the seed of Abraham, and when Leroy was living in Haifa, someone in the family
wrote hi m about thi s .     He r esponded as follows :

"One day Father and I went to the Plaza Hote l to see t he

One day Mother promised to take J oseph with her to see ' Abdu ' l-
Bah, .     In later years, our sister, Viola, wrote as follows :

"No t her said t hat when ' Abdu ' l-Bah/ was here in Chicago,
> staying at the Plaza Hotel, she went a number of times to see Him, a.s
> He would spend most of His time talking with the believers . She said
> on one of the days she promised Joseph (whom ' Abdu'l-Bctha named) that

had been sewed .

"That night Joe was saying sadly that he would not be able
> to see 'Abdu'l-Bah~ the next day, but Mother comforted him by saying,
> 'Let 's wait and see . Haybe tomo rrow you will be much be t ter. ' This
proved to be t he case, so the next day they both;vent t o see ' Abdli ' 1-·Baha.

"They were sitting in one of the rooms of the hotel, along

Spiritual Assembly did not want Joseph's picture to appear.

"She ordered a dozen prints from Hiss Jones (one for each

5x7 11 ) .
Joe wrote recently:

"I feel that through my experience with 'Abdu'l- Baha and

Leroy speaks of the Temp le and the laying of its cornerstone in
the same talk he gave at the Temple on March 8, 1952 , as follows:

" I recall we used to come out here in the early days when
> the property was bought . Others who know the history will tell you more
> in detail that we used to come out here and enjoy this wonderful area .
> We used to come on to the grounds here and sit and pray, and we used
> to go down to the beach and swim. Finally when the Haster arrived,
the word came that He was coming to the Temple grounds.

"There was nothing here but a prairie with some trees on it,
and one thing or another, and a tent had been arranged for a meet ing
..        where He was to speak to the Baha ' is. We didn't understand, some of us

> at least, that He was going to lay a cornerstone at that time. I recall
> that we heard the lfaster was going to come off on t o the Temple grounds
> over here on the Linden Avenue side, and we were all kind of hovering
> around there in order to be there to meet liim. Suddenly the word ca;ne
> that He had arrived over on the Sheridan Avenue side , and He was walking
> across . We rushed to meet Him , and I recall there was a log tha t had
> fallen and was in His way, and I didn ' t see how the Haster could possibly
> get over that log, but Re just walked right for it. I rushed up and
tried .to move it , but it was about twice as heavy as I could even think

> of moving, and the way He stepped over that log was absolutely miraculous,
> just like it wasn't t here at all. As he walked around, there were very,
> very touching scenes . You have heard so much about Net t ie Tobin and the
> cornerstone which s he brought from the near north side and with great
> difficulty, and had this inspira tion to bring a stone and to bring it
> out here. You read that in the Baha 'i World , and you can read it in
many places, but one little story that you don't know .

"I remember when we were . all walki ng, t he Haster walked around
> the gr ounds, everyone walked behind Him, and some of the women were taking
> His robe and kissing it and others were trying t o get His hand and hold it,
> and so on, and so forth , and NettieTobin was walking right close up behind
> Him , and she had some shears, · and suddenly He stopped and He pushed His
> turban over on the side and some of Hi s locks fell down, and she stepped
> up with the shears and took a few of those locks. Then the Master put
> the turban back and put His hair underneath just like He had done it on
purpose for her .

A little later we gathered under t he tent for the laying of
> the cornerstone, and the Master gave a beautiful talk in which He described
> the method of the architecture , of the landscaping . After the ~faster
> delivered His talk, He sat right next to where the cornerstone is now
> placed . He called one after the other to come up and dig some soil from
various countries of t he world.

"I recall Lua Getsinger was there , Roy Wilhe:l:n was there, Dr.

> Bagdadi was there, mos t of the older Baha ' is whose names you know , if you
> don't know them personally, were there. They all took the shovel---a
> common ordinary spade . Finally it came time for the Master Himself to
> turn some soil for the entire world. Some of the believers stepped up
with a gold trowel---wanted Him to use a gold t rowel .

1 noticed, I was sitting-- -I just squeezed right up in front
> and sat right there on the ground right next to what was going on, so I
> could see everything , and the Master seemed to be displeased with this
> gold trowe l. He used it a l ittle bit and set it aside . It ·seemed fror.1
> what conversation went on in Persian that there was a little distress,
> then He called for the spade; and I thought, 'Goo dness gracious , 'Ab du' 1-
> Baha , with that delicate little foot of His , can't poss ibly press that
> spade into the groun<l ~because the others were working and pushing, and
> so on, and they couldn't do it . The Has t er had t he r.iost delicate
> features; and as He exposed His foot to put it on the spade, the spade
> j ust pushed right down and turned the soi l over. Then He called for
this famous cornerstone that Nettie Tobin had brought.

"After the meeting was over, one or two of us had an idea
that we would like to have some of that soil from that turning over and
..   laying of the corners tone. Young Charlie Greenleaf and I both went up

> and got a couple of handsful. Young Greenleaf got the idea that he
> would like to have the Master bless the soil, so he r an and caught the
> l-1as ter, and the lfas ter blessed the soil. You have seen the picture. I
got there just after the Mas ter had turned and l eft, and Char lie said

to me,'Wel l , you got here too late for the Master to bl ess your soil,
> so I will give you half of mine.' That half of mine is now in the

To elaborate a little further on this incident , I should like to
quote from "The Spell of the Temple , " by Allen B. McDaniel, pages 16-17 .

"11otionless, and in an attitude of waiting , the Master, as
> 'Abdu ' 1-Baha was called, stood looking into space . Suddenly He move!d,
> and, as the crowd made way, walked toward a path leading to the street.
> As the people turned around they saw with amazement a little ol d woman
> laboriously pulling a small child's express wagon up the incline . Before
> the onlookers could move , the Master had reached the wagon and guidE~d the
> little woman up the path to the spot where He had stood. With a smHe
> lighting up His face, He placed His hand on the head of the woman as i f
in blessing , and t hen lifted the building stone out of the wagon .

·~et t ie Tob in r el ated: ' I had heard that the Master was to be
> at the Temple site on Hay first, and I thought that He should have a
> suitable stone to mark the location of the Temple. So I went to a building
> under construction near my home, and seeing a pile of stones at a wall,
> I asked the builder if I could get a stone. He said , "Sure , help yourself ,
> these are rejected." So I went home, got an old, small baby carriage ,
> loaded the stone into it and wheeled it home. Early the next morning ,
> with the help of a Persian friend , I wheeled the carriage to the car line,
> and, against the protests of the conductor, we got the carriage onto the
> platform of the car. We made two changes and finally, after endless
> delays, we got the baby carriage to the corner of Central Street and
> Sheridan Road . Here, when we pushed the carriage over a broken payement,
> it collapsed. As we stood despairing of getting the stone to the Temple
> grounds in time, since the hour had passed for the service , two boys with
> an express wagon came along . The boys were quickly persuaded to lend
> their wagon for the transportation, and so we finally came to the grounds .
> Imagine my joy when the 1·'.:itone refused: by the builder" was received and
used by the Has ter. 111

We read in Ps alms 118:22   "The stone which the builders refused is
become the head stone of the corner . 11

Another time Hother and Joseph were privileged to be in the presence
of   1

Abdu'1-Baha was when He was leaving Chicago, and they went to the depot to say .
good-bye to 'Abdu'l-Baha .      I quote from Nother's words:

"I had taught Joseph , my youngest child, from the time he could
talk to say a short evening prayer, adding to it 'Dear 'Abdu' 1-Baha, help
..            oe to be a good boy and make me a good man. ' When 1 Abdu' 1-Baha left

> Chicago, we went to the depot to bid Him good-bye. We had little Joseph
> (whom 'Abdu'l-Baha had named when he was one year old) with us, and 'Abdu'l-
> Baha patted his cheek and said: ' He is a good boy, a very good boy; he will
> be a good man, a very good man . ' Who can say ' Ab du ' 1-Baha did not hear
Joseph ' s prayer? 11

Rudy, the third son, was living in New Jersey when         Abdu'l-Baha
visited America.     He was then 25 years of age.   These are copies of letters he
wrote home 1n that period.

"Thursday eve., June 20, 1912.
"Dear Father,

"Well, this has been a very wonderful day for me. I went down
> to the present home of the Master again about 4:30 this evening; the
> Master was out but came back about 5:10 and then talked with an Episcopal
preacher until about 5:30.

"I had told one of the Persians that I should be very thankful
> if I might have about a minute with the Master, When He was through with
> the minister, He came down stairs and passing out, He took my hand and
> beckoned me to go with Him, Ali Kuli Khan went also, and the Mast1ar led
> the way out into the park. We would walk for a while, and then He would
> lead the way to a bench, and we would sit down, and after sitting for a
> while , He would again get up and walk some more. I was very thankful that
> there happened to be a very refreshing breeze blowing, for 'Abdu' l·-Baha
> seemed to enjoy it very much . It does me so much good to see something
> that way that He enjoys---I am always so glad to hear Him laugh for as a
> general rule, it does seem to me He carries s uch a wonderfully sad face.
Don 't you think so?

"Do you know it was about 7:30 when we returned to His he>use
> and those at the house had gone out in front , having become anxious
over the Master's long abse-..ice.

"Now needless to say, I did not burden the Master with a lot
> of foolish questions; in fact, I had very little to say as I was pE~r­
> fectly contented to be in the Master's presence, and was grateful to
see Him have this little quiet and rest .

"I told the Master how happy He had made Mother at home
> through the love He had shown her and the children , and He replied He
loved our whole family from top to bottom.

"A little later I said you were working very hard for the
> Cause---that we were all praying for you and asked that He might confirm
> and pray for you . The Master rep lied 'Your father shall be assis ted and
> confirmed, ' 'I pray God that your father may be assisted and confirmed
to do his work to suit God's own good pleasure .'

"When we returned to the house, the Master told me to come
> in, which I did . Mr . Getsinger , Ameen, Ali Kuli Khan , and that lady
> that wears t he purple gown, also another young Persian were there. At
> 8:00 I got up to bid the Master good-bye, all the others arose; I shook
> each of their hands goodbye; asked Ali Kuli Khan to tell the Master how
thankful I was and then departed, a very happy boy.

"By t~e way, the lady in the purple gown wanted to be remem-
bered to you and Mother. What is her name?

"Tomorrow the Master will go to Montclair, N. J., for a few
> days and Monday He is going to give a Feast and I hope to have the
pleasure of being there.

"Hy He is so good---1 do hope and pray that His health will
> improve. He does look so worn out. I wish He could be persuaded to
> take a good rest, but He will work so hard. Occasionally some people
> would pass us and smile at the Oriental costume---how sad, and how
> little they appreciate what they are doing. How anybody can look at
that Face and not feel the deepest reverence is beyond me.
"Well I have written long .   Will close for this time.
"With love to all

"Orange, New Jersey

Dec. 8, 1912
"Dear Father,

"Of course you know that the Master left this country on.

> Thursday on the Steamer "Celtic" as mentioned in my letter to Mother
> written from the boat. I am mighty happy to have been fortunate enough
> to see the Master come into this country and also be there at His
> departure. I would like for you all to have been there for it was
surely wonderful.

1 reached the doc:k about 10 :00 a.m. and a very few minu:tes

> later the Master arrived and went into the steamer, and we followe:d
> Him into His apartments. Somebody gave Him a basket of fruit, and
> He distributed it among the early comers, and I was fortunate enough
to have received a large bunch of green grapes.

"He then led the way to the sitting room and by this time
.   a great crowd of the BelieVE!rs had gathered. Here He gave us His l::.st
exhortation, and I took notes of His talk.

"About fifteen minutes before leaving time the visitors
> were ordered off the boat, but how some of the Believers did linge:r and
wait until the last moment. The Master stood at the head of the stairs

and the Believers bid Him goodbye passing down stairs and off the boat.
I stood at the foot of the stairs and it was wonderful to see the e:motions
of some of the people at parting with the Haster. Nirza Ali Kuli Khan did
not go with Him , and when bidding Him goodbye he cried right out l:i.ke a
boy. It is surely grand the reverence with which Ali Kuli Khan looks at
the Naster and there is certainly a lesson for the Americans.

"The Persian Consul was on the boat to bid the Naster goodbye
and he arra.nged with the boat: management to see that the Naster would be
given special attention and not want for anything. I do hope that the
weather is favorable during His entire journey.
1 have sent home a photo taken at a banquet given 'Abdu'l-Ilaha

at the Great Northern Hotel. You will note the Persian Consul was also at
this banquet. He made a very nice talk praising the Haster very hj.ghly.
Mrs. Jones has been here with her little daughter for I guess the past
two or three weeks.
"Well I will close this time with love to all.

This briefly, then, is an account of the early days of the
Ioas family in relation to 'Abdu'l-Baha and the Faith.    It makes no
mention of the lectures Father gave, Mother's teaching children's
classes in Chicago along with my sister, or any other single service
rendered by them, their children, or , their grandchildren.

Collectively, they have taught and pioneered (three of them
being Knights of Baha'u'llah) in many parts of the United States and
Canada, Mexico, Cuba, Jamaica, Trinidad, South America, the Dutch West
Indies, Hawaii, Korea, Singapore, Vietnam, Italy, Monaco, France, the
Balearic Islands, and Spain.   They have given many lectures at the Baha'i
House of Worship in Wilmette and have guided there for many years.       They
have served on Local and National Spiritual Assemblies.       In addition to
extensive teaching and lecturing in the United States, Leroy, as a Hand
of the Cause of God and at the request of Shoghi Effendi, lived in Haifa
and took many trips to various parts of the world; i.e., Europe, Asia,
and Africa, as well as America.   (For published article about Leroy, see
THE BAHA'I WORLD, Volume XIV, 1963-1968, page 291).
We are most grateful to 'Abdu'l-Baha for His words in His
letter to Mother of December 15, 1908, in which He wrote:

> "I am ever thoughtful concerning that family and ask the Lord
> of the Kingdom to confirm your household more and more daily.
> Thus may it serve the Cause of God, move according to its will,
> spread the Divine fragrances, educate the children, give life
> to souls and prove the cause of illumination to the world of
humanity.
Upon thee be El-Baha-El-Abha."

I thank God continually that we had parents who had such
> great spiritual insight and also the determination to succeed in their
> quest for Truth .       In 1898 when they became Baha' is, they were re:ally
> ahead of their time.        Speaking of Father and Mother, Leroy said
> ''They     • were pioneers and advance guar ds in the cause of spiritual
> democracy • . . who loved the principles of the Heavenly Civil ization
when the world at large did not realize their dynamic power . 11

HOW IT HAPPENED THAT JOSEPH HAD HIS PICTURE TAKEN WITH 'ABDU 1 L-BAH.A IN 1912
Mother said that when 'Abdu'l-Baha was here in  Chicago, staying at
> the Plaza Hotel, she went a number of times to see Him as He would spend
> most of His time talking with the believers. She said on one of the days
> she promised Joseph that the next day she would take him along. Unfc::>r-
> tunately, the same day he fell and cut a gash in his forehead. It was
> necessary to call the doctor, who took several stitches in his head.
> (I remember i t well, because I held Joe still while the doctor took the
> stitches, which called for all my personal fortitudet) The doctor
> placed the white bandage on Joe's head and told Mother not to let Jo1a
> take it off and also that he should be careful not to jar the skin
which had been sewed.

That night Joe was saying sadly that he would not be able to seia
> 'Abdu'l-Baha the next day, but Mother conforted him by saying, "Let's
> wait and see. Maybe tomorrow you will be much better." This proved to
be the case, so the next day they both went to see 1 Ab du'l-Baha,

They were sitting in one of the rooms of the hotel , along with :some
> other people, waiting for 'Abdu'l-Baha to make His appearance. When He
> did so, a young woman with a camera rose quickly, went over to Mrs.
> Getsinger and requested her to ask 'Abdu 1 l-Baha i f He would allow he:r to
> take His picture with her little sister. He gave His permission, so the
> little girl sat down beside Him. He then motioned to Joseph, who wa:s
> sitting at the opposite side of the room, to come over. Mother said to
> Joe, "I think 'Abdu'l-Bana wants you to go to Him." So she brought him
> to 'Abdu 1 l-Bah~ and He placed him on His other side. Mother asked
> 'Abdu'l-Baha if she had not better take off the bandage from Joe's h1ead,
> but He said to leave it on. Joe remarked later, "I have a cloth on my
> head just like 'Abdu'l-Baha. The little girl's name was Rouhieh Jonias,
and a beautiful little girl she appears to be.

The elder Miss Jones had her tripod focussed to take in only ·
> 'Abdu'l-Baha and her sister, so she took that picture first and then
> explained that she did not believe it was focussed correctly to take
in three, She, therefore, asked for permission to take another one and

"

> adjusted her camera to take in the three. Later, the pie tu re appear1ed
> in the "Star of the West," without Joseph. Mother was a good friend of
> Gertrude Buikema, who was on the Spiritual Assembly at the time and .also
> she and Hr. Windust were the editors of the "Star." Therefore, she .asked
> Gertrude how it happened that Joe had been cut off of the picture.
> Gertrude said she had never seen a picture with Joe in it - that the only
> one which had beer. submitted to the Spiritual Assembly was the one with
> the little girl and 'Abdu'l-Bah~ alone, according to her knowledge.
> Mother felt satisfied, then, as she had been a little hurt, thinking
> possibly (for what reason she could not imagine) that perhaps the
Spiritual Assembly did not want Joseph's picture to appear.

She ordered a dozen prints from Miss Jones (one for each of our
family), and Miss Jones kindly gave her the enlargement (about S" x 7").
