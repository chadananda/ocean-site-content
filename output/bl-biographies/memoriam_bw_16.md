IN MEMORIAM

JOHN FERRABY

John Ferraby was born in Southsea, England,
on 9 January 1914 and grew up there. He was
educated at Malvern and at King's College,
Cambridge, to which he won a major scholar-
ship.

It was in 1941that he was told about the Faith
by a non-BahB'i. Wanting to know more, he
found Dr. Esslemont's book in a public library.
He was by then living in London, so he started
to look for the BahB'is there, but he had
difficulty in finding them because during the
blitz the Bahi'i Centre was empty most of the
time. However, finally he found someone and
after a couple of visits he wanted to be accepted
as a member of the community. Almost im-
mediately he began to work for the Faith,
becoming in less than a year a member of the
London Spiritual Asseinbly and of the National
Spiritual Assembly. In 1943 he married a fellow
member of the National Assembly, Dorothy
Cansdale.                                                              .7ohn Ferraby

in Belleville and Oshawa. His parents were poor
and at the age of twelve or thirteen Jim went to
work. He did not like school because he felt
discriminated against

-      and, as a result, achieved
little formal education; but he had a keen mind
and was quick to learn and he read avidly.
Although it did not show on the surface, he
sought, from early childhood, for something
that would enable him to feel equal to the rest of
humanity. He was puzzled by, but took comfort
in, his very earliest recollection: Jim was sitting
on a fence as a small boy watchinga train crossing
the landscape. A man clothed in flowing white
robes was on the train smiling and waving at the
child who, in confusion and delight, toppled
backwards. This childhood memory lingered
vividly. When he found the Faith of Baha'u'llah,
Jimrecognized the figure on the train as 'Abdu'l-
Bahi.

In 1930 Jim married Melba Whetung, a
beautiful Chippewa Indian from Curve Lake,
near Peterborough, Ontario. They established a
home in Detroit, Michigan where their two sons
were born, James Gordon in 1933 and Arthur
Edwin in 1934. Jim worked for Chrysler Corpo-                          .    .  .

Universal House of Justice
This remarkable tribute from the Universal
House of Justice is a striking testimony to the
indomitable spirit that animated the soul of
IAraqiyyih Dhabih whose passing plunged the
entire BahB'i community of Iran into profound
sorrow and deprived it of an outstanding
worker and faithful exemplar of the teachings
of Bahi'u'llah. Her life was a reflection to an
eminent degree of His exhortation that knowl-
edge and action must be wedded to each other.
The admiration expressed for her conduct by
both 'Abdu'l-Bahk and Shoghi Effendi attests
this truth.

varied. She served as a member of the National

committees, was elected to the Local Spiritual

time to travelling as a teacher of the Faith and
offered friendship and hospitality to believers

Mrs. Bare was killed in an automobile ac-

Another way in which my father spread the
Teachings was through his original poetry,
some of which he sent to the Holy Land. In a
postscript to a letter dated 6 August 1933 the
Guardian wrote: 'Your poem dedicated to
Nabil deeply touched me. I urge you to revise it
and put it into final form and send to me a copy
of it for inclusion in the next issue of The
Bahb'i World . . . I would also welcome any
other poems from your gifted pen on any
phase or episode recounted in Nabil's immortal
narrative. You are rendering the Cause unique
and notable services. Be happy and persevere
in your high endeavours.' The poem entitled
'Nabil' appeared in The Bahb'i World,vol. V , on
page 673. His poem entitled 'Zanjan' appeared
on page 674 of the same volume. Two poems
he composed in memory of Keith Ransom-
Kehler were acknowledged by the secretary of
Shoghi Effendi who wrote on 27 February 1934                       Philip A. Marangella
stating that the Guardian hoped that the poems
would enable both BahB'is and non-BahB'is to         of my heart, the Master's richest blessings. You

messages for transmittal to Persia. The Guard-

Mr. Toeg approximately fifty letters of en-

prayers and blessings. Mr. Toeg also served as
representative of the Huququ'llah fund for the
believers in 'fraq.

Mr. Toeg was involved in other spheres of
BahB'i activity, some of which are of great
historical importance. He was in the vanguard

exact date she visited the Holy Land is not
known, it occurred some time before 1930; she
remained there for a month at the request of the
beloved Guardian to be companion to Effie
Baker who was preparing to leave for Persia to
photograph the Bahi'i holy sites. Olga would
vividly describe her first meeting with the Great-
est Holy Leaf; she ran to her and flung herself
on the ground at the feet of Baha'iyyih Khanurn
'sobbing her heart out'.

The only record we have from those days is a
letter written on behalf of the beloved Guard-
ian, dated 12 July 1931, which refers to one she
had written to him exactly a month earlier. The
letter refers to Olga's 'last visit to the Holy
Shrines' and her subsequent visit to the BahB'is
in Leipzig and Berlin and the talks she gave
there. An interesting reference is made in this
letter to 'our zealous and competent BahB'i

SEYMOUR MALKIN

Seymour was born in Chicago, Illinois, on 19
June 1923. His mother, Leona Luber, was of
Romanian descent. His father, Jacob Malkin,
was born in Russia and came to the United
States while still in his teens, shortly before
World War I, to escape the religious per-
secutions of that time. Seymour was raised by
his father and paternal grandmother. His
grandmother was a devoted and saintly follower
of the Jewish Faith and to her Seymour attrib-
uted all his spiritual guidance during his child-
hood.

At the age of nineteen, Seymour enlisted in
the United States Air Force and served for three
years in the Philippines and Australia. His duties
were in radio and special services to uplift the
