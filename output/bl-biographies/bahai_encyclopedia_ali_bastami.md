In the course of his studies, Mullá ‘Alí learned about the Shaykhí movement of Shia Islam from Mullá
Ja‘far Kirmánsháhí, one of the Shaykhí ulama (religious scholars) of Mashhad. Mullá ‘Alí was
immediately attracted to the movement and soon entered into communication with its leader, Siyyid
Kázim Rashtí. Eventually, Mullá ‘Alí left his home and family to study under Siyyid Kázim in Karbala, an
important center of Shiite scholarship in Iraq and the seat of the Shaykhí movement.

After seven years Mullá ‘Alí’s father and other relatives, distressed by his long absence, went to Karbala
and obtained Siyyid Kázim’s approval for the eager scholar to return home. Mullá ‘Alí was unable to
settle down, however, and less than two years later had given up village life and returned to Karbala.

Mullá ‘Alí was among those who accompanied Siyyid Kázim Rashtí
on his last pilgrimage to Kázimayn and was in Karbala when
Siyyid Kázim died at the end of 1843.1 Because Siyyid Kázim had
not appointed a successor, his death caused a crisis in the
Shaykhí community. After several weeks of indecision, some of
the disciples, including Mullá Husayn Bushrú’í and Mullá ‘Alí,
retired to the mosque of Kufa for forty days of fasting and
prayer, a customary Shaykhí practice. They then decided to set
off in search of the new leader to whom Siyyid Kázim had
alluded.

Mullá ‘Alí reached Shiraz a short time after Mullá Husayn Bushrú’í
had recognized the Báb and become His first disciple. According
to the historian Nabíl in The Dawn-Breakers , Mullá ‘Alí, realizing
that Mullá Husayn had found the object of his search, retired to
fast and pray for guidance, during which time he was led to the
Báb by a vision. 2 The Báb gave Mullá ‘Alí the title "the Second

The Báb's letter to Mullá ‘Alí Bastámí, the second
Who Believed" (Thání Man Ámana) and named him one of                    Letter of the Living, in the Báb's own handwriting.

eighteen disciples or "Letters of the Living." The Báb, in His
Persian Bayán, identified Mullá ‘Alí, in allegorical language, as the return of the Imam Ali.3

The companions with whom Mullá ‘Alí had traveled to Shiraz (twelve, in Nabíl’s account) soon
recognized the Báb and were numbered among the Letters of the Living. 4 They spent a short period in
His company before He dispersed them, instructing them to disseminate His cause.

MISSION TO IRAQ
The Báb chose Mullá ‘Alí to announce the advent of the Mahdi (but not the Báb’s identity) in the shrine
cities of Najaf and Karbala in Iraq, where the most important Shiite clerics were based. According to
Nabíl, the Báb sent Mullá ‘Alí on his mission with words of encouragement that alluded to the difficulties
he would soon face: "You are the first to leave the House of God [Shiraz], and to suffer for His sake."5

Mullá ‘Alí set out according to the Bab’s special instructions. He went first to Bushehr, where he met
with the Báb’s uncle Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad, who years later accepted both the Báb and
Bahá’u’lláh. By the late summer of 1844, Mullá ‘Alí had arrived in Najaf, the site of the shrine of the
Imam Ali and a center of Shiite scholarship. There he delivered a message from the Báb to Shaykh
Muhammad Hasan Najafí, the foremost mujtahid (a preeminent Shiite scholar and doctor of Islamic law)
of the day. The message was abruptly rejected and Mullá ‘Alí expelled from the city.

> The Shiite ulama in Karbala had Mullá ‘Alí arrested and
> transferred to Baghdad. Najib Pasha, the governor of
Karbala (c.1932). Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs
Division, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA. Library of Congress     Baghdad, convened the most prominent of the Sunni and

Shiite ulama on 13 January 1845 to try Mullá ‘Alí.

Among those gathered were Shaykh Mahmúd al-Álúsí, the mufti (Muslim legal authority) of Baghdad;
nineteen other Sunni ulama; Shaykh Hasan ibn Káshifi’l-Ghitá’, the leading Shiite figure after Shaykh
Muhammad Hasan; Siyyid Muhammad Báqir Qazvíní, the foremost cleric in Karbala, who had been the
bitter enemy of Siyyid Kázim; Shaykh Hasan Gawhar, a leading Shaykhí; and five other Shiite ulama.

Accounts of the proceedings are confused and contradictory. However, the written verdict of the court is
extant. It reveals that the court examined a copy of the Báb’s first book, the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’, which
Mullá ‘Alí had brought with him, and grasped the fact that the author of the book—whose identity
remained unknown—was claiming divine revelation. The Sunni ulama unhesitatingly pronounced both
the author and the bearer of the book to be heretics and condemned them to death. The Shiite ulama
were more guarded in their verdicts, probably because the affair had been politicized into a Sunni
versus Shia and Turk versus Iranian issue, and refused to countenance more serious punishment than
banishment or imprisonment.

The events associated with Mullá ‘Alí in Najaf and Karbala and his trial in Baghdad are important for a
number of reasons. The commotion caused by Mullá ‘Alí and by the willingness of numbers of people to
accept his announcement of the coming of the Báb were in themselves remarkable, especially as the
Báb had asked that His identity not be revealed. The Báb’s message reached a level of public
awareness and controversy that was not seen elsewhere in the earliest years of the Báb’s ministry.

Furthermore, the events triggered by Mullá ‘Alí in Najaf, Karbala, and Baghdad mark the first clash with
the ulama of Islam in the evolution of the Bábí-Bahá’í religion. In the Kitáb-i-Aqdas    (Most Holy
Book), Bahá’u’lláh refers to Shaykh Muhammad Hasan’s rejection of the message brought by Mullá ‘Alí. 6
The verdict of the court set the pattern for later Muslim denunciations of the new religion. In addition,

the intense opposition Mullá ‘Alí met from both the religious and secular authorities in Iraq altered the
course of Bábí history in that it influenced the Báb’s plan to go to Karbala. He had originally announced
that He would proceed directly to Karbala after His pilgrimage to Mecca in December 1844 and had
asked that His followers gather there. Instead, He returned to Shiraz, where he was placed under house
arrest.

The affair of Mullá ‘Alí also had wider consequences in that it affected relations between Iran and the
Ottoman Empire. Concerned about maintaining the jurisdiction of the Iranian government over its
subjects in Iraq, Haji Mirza Aqasi, Iran’s prime minister, and Muhibb-‘Alí Khán, the governor of the
province of Kirmanshah, insisted on Mullá ‘Alí’s return to Iran. The foreign ambassadors in Istanbul
attempted to mediate.

Moreover, the affair is significant in Islamic history: the coming together of Sunni and Shiite ulama to
give a joint fatwa (judgment or sentence in Islamic law) was unprecedented in modern times. It also
marked the first occasion in which the Ottoman Empire had accorded the Shiite ulama official
recognition as a judicial authority.

IMPRISONMENT AND DEATH

dockyards outside Istanbul.

The Iranian government continued to press for Mullá ‘Alí’s extradition for punishment in Iran. After
some months the Ottoman authorities agreed and issued orders to release him from forced labor, only
to find, according to an Iranian report dated 4 December 1846, that he had died a few days earlier. He
was thus the first Bábí to die for his faith.
