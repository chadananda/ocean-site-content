The Conversion of the Great-Uncle of the Báb

By Ahang Rabbani
World Order, Spring 1999

ONE OF THE most significant figures in the nineteenth-century Iranian Bahá'í community was
Hájí Mírzá Sayyid Muhammad (1798-1876), known as Khál-i Ákbar (the greater uncle) because he
was the oldest maternal uncle of the Báb, the Prophet-Forerunner of the Bahá’í Faith. When Khál-i

Akbar’s nephew, Mírzá Sayyid ‘Alí-Muhammad of Shiraz, began His mission as a divine messenger in
1844, assuming the title of the Báb (the Gate), He announced His ministry gradually and in veiled
language to avoid immediate opposition from Iran's entrenched Islamic clerical establishment. Khál-i-
Akbar has long been portrayed in English-language histories of the Bábí Faith as not being a believer,
perhaps skeptical of his nephew's claims. But Khál-i Akbar’s private correspondence—only recently

published in Persian, some of which is first translated into English in this article—reveals him to be a
man with considerable sympathy toward the Báb, a man who recognized that his nephew was a
remarkable spiritual teacher. The correspondence also brings the reader into the private discussions of
the Báb's family, showing their affection for Him and each other, their desire to share news about His
movements, and their allegiance to His person.

In spite of that allegiance, however, Khál-i Akbar either did not immediately understand or accept
the notion that the Báb was a Manifestation of God. Such recognition was delayed until 1861, almost a
decade after his nephew's execution by firing squad in 1850. It was brought about by Mírzá Husayn-
'Alí (1817-92) known to the world as Bahá'u'lláh (the Glory of God), the Founder of the Bahá'í Faith.
During the opening days of January 1861 Khál-i Akbar visited Baghdad to discuss with Bahá'u'lláh his
concerns about the claim and station of the Báb and acceded to Bahá'u'lláh's request that he put his
questions in writing (which are translated into English below). In reply Bahá'u'lláh revealed a treatise
that He later called the Kitáb-i Íqán. Khál-i Akbar's private correspondence about the trip (also
translated into English below) provides valuable historical context for understanding Bahá'u'lláh's
second most significant work, as well as pinpointing the date of its revelation.

Bahá’u’lláh, Who had not yet announced His own claim to be a Manifestation of God. In 1866 Khál-i
Akbar came to understand and accept Bahá'u'lláh as a Manifestation of God, when Nabíl-i A'zam, a
historian of the Bábí and Bahá'í faiths, visited Shiraz and proclaimed Bahá'u'lláh's announcement to the
Bábís. The Báb's uncle (as the document translated below shows) quickly accepted Bahá’u’lláh as the
One prophesied by the Báb. His will and testament (also given in this article in translation)
demonstrates that Khál-i Akbar ended his earthly life as a devoted follower of Bahá’u’lláh.

> Khál-i Akbar's Earliest Associations with the Báb
> Khál-i Akbar's family were among the best-known and the most trustworthy merchants in the
province of Fárs. Khál-i Akbar's wife, Hájíyyih Bíbí Fátimih-Sáhib (a daughter of Hájí Muhammad-
Muhsin) also came from a prominent merchant family of ‘Abdu'l-Husayní, which traded in Shiraz and
Bushire and eventually had commercial interests that extended from India to Europe. Khál-i Akbar ran

the family office in Bushire, where he and the Báb were partners during the first four years in which
the Báb worked there as a merchant.

Although Khál-i Akbar had no indication that the Báb would later declare Himself to be an
independent Manifestation of God Whose purpose was to inaugurate a new religion and to prepare for
the coming of "He Whom God shall make manifest" [Bahá’u’lláh], he grew increasingly concerned
during those years about the Báb's preoccupation with religious matters, fearing that such proclivities
might cause problems for their prominent family.

Mírzá Habíb Afnán, the late custodian of the House of the Báb in Shiraz and a prominent member
of the Báb's family, reports that

> One day in Egypt during the time when [Mírzá] Abu'1-Fadl was occupied with writing the Kitáb-
> i Fará’id, we began talking about the Báb's early years, before His declaration, when He was
engaged in trading. Mírzá Abu'1-Fadl related the following to me:

"I myself heard the late Hájí Sayyid Javád-i Karbilá’i relate that, when the Báb was pursuing
> a career as a merchant in Bushire, because of Hájí Sayyid Javáďs friendship and close association
> with the uncles of the Báb, he used to stay with them whenever he visited either Shiraz or
> Bushire. One day Hájí Mírzá Sayyid Muhammad came to him with a request, 'Give some good
> counsel to my nephew. Tell him not to write or utter certain things that can only provoke the
> jealousy of certain people. These people cannot tolerate seeing a young merchant of little
> schooling showing such erudition and are, therefore, rendered envious and resentful.'"              5

Hájí Mírzá Muhammad was very insistent that Hájí Sayýid Javád should counsel the Báb [to
> desist from such activities]. Hájí Sayyid Javád, however, replied with these lines of verse: 'The

others similar to it, provoked Khál-i Akbar's concern.

visage.' He added: 'We are earthbound, and He is celestial. Our counsel is of no use to Him.'"      6

In the summer of 1844, after His stirring declaration on 23 May of His being a Manifestation of
God, the Báb instructed Mullah 'Alíy-i Bastámí, the second to believe in Him, to journey to Bushire
and to share the news of His proclamation with Khál-i Akbar. It appears that, in the course of this visit,
the Báb's uncle grew considerably in his understanding of his nephew's claim.       7

Khál-i Akbar's Letter to His Mother and Sister
A FEW months after Bastámí visited Khál-i Akbar, the Báb visited His uncle while traveling to
Mecca for His pilgrimage. On His return He again stayed with His uncle for some ten days, beginning
on 15 May 1845. By the second visit Khál-i Akbar had developed a deep sense of respect and devotion

toward the Báb, warmly welcoming Him into his home and showing genuine interest in his nephew's
claim. During the Báb's return visit, Khál-i Akbar sent a letter to his mother and to his sister, Fátimih
Bagum (the mother of the Báb):

> O the Best of the Protectors!
> To be conveyed to the illumined presence of the exalted lady, my mother, and to my sister, upon
them rest the contentment of God.

He is.
To your sanctified presence it is respectfully submitted that first may your eyes and mine, and
> indeed all eyes, be illumined that, praised be God, in utmost health and well-being, the honored
> Hájí [the Báb] has arrived, and at present I stand in His service. It is deemed prudent for Him to

> will return to that city. Your blessed self [Khál-i Akbar's mother] should be assured that He sent a

> addressed to my dear and honored sister and only noticed that there was a short letter addressed to
the sister of Áqá Mírzá Abu'1-Qásim, which was forwarded. Now that I have determined it was

meant separately for my sister, that one has been sent as well. Study them all.

Khál-i Akbar s letter clearly indicates the extent to which he had come to believe, in some
fashion, in his nephew’s Cause (amr). By urging his mother and his sister, the Báb's mother, to remain
firm in their belief of these claims as well, it can be inferred that at least some members of the Báb's
family had given their allegiance to Him and recognized Him as the instrument of a divine Cause,
though they still perceived His station as being within the scope of Islam.

> Khál-i Akbar's Letter to His Brother
> About the same time that Khál-i Akbar wrote to his mother and his sister, he sent another
dispatch to his second brother, Hájí Mírzá
Sayyid Ali, known as Khál-i A’zam (the most great uncle). From the content of this

communication it is evident that the Báb's claim had provoked considerable commotion. While many,
including some of the Báb's immediate family, were exerting pressure on Him to abandon His claims,
the letter provides evidence that Khál-i Akbar was by then a devoted follower of the Báb, though he
was yet unaware of the full magnitude of the Báb's revelation.

> ... a letter was received about the Cause of the honored Sayyid and my Master [the Báb], may His
station be exalted by the Almighty. Mírzá Abu'1-Qásim has written about it as well. Also, Hájí

losses.

My view, however, is that, if we were to consider the matter from the worldly point of view,

years I have forbidden unto Myself the revelation of verses. This, indeed, is the most grievous
punishment for those who have denied, and they will comprehend its effect only after they have been
left with no recourse. After My arrival in Shiraz, as had been My practice in the past, I will remain in
My house and will not associate with anyone and will not allow others to attain unto My presence. I
will have no dealings with anyone and will leave people to themselves. Meanwhile should anyone be
found who seeks the truth and be willing to embrace it, I shall designate one to answer his questions.
Once I decline to associate with others, others will not bother with Me as well. If it were not because of
My esteemed mother and grandmother, I would never return to Shiraz and single and alone would
establish My home in this very city [Bushire], or would go in a direction that none would know."

If our honored mother desires to visit the sacred city of Mashhad, she can proceed with you.

Accordingly, please arrange for her journey. And if by then the Hájí [the Báb] were to arrive [in
Shiraz], they would be together for a few days, and she would depart afterwards. In any case, may they
journey in peace.

In short, though they manifest His [the Báb's] wishes, the above utterances indicate His honored
Person's sadness over the event. God willing, once He has arrived in Shiraz, He would not associate
with anyone, and the same has been His practice while in this place. And should anyone ask of this
matter, the answer is the same, and it is incumbent upon him to show obedience and seek the
explanation of what he does not understand of His laws from the one designated by Him. He Himself
will not associate with anyone. The reason for designating another person is that, should people be
found who in sincerity would recognize Him and seek to understand [His Revelation], they would
make their inquires from this designate, who, otherwise, will not associate with anyone either. For five
years it will thus continue, until He decrees what will occur.

He [the Báb] states, "We have nothing to do with anyone, and you are to continue with your
business as before and fear no one. If you dislike My coming to Shiraz, I will not come." Thus His
affairs will unfold as described above.

However, about what you had written, "These writings are not proof," and your inquiry as to how
this servant attained certitude [in the Báb's claims], I respond that, besides the fact that these writings
are in themselves proof, consider how a Person like Him, Who is unschooled, now without consulting a
book or referring to any text, is able to lift the pen and reveal such mighty verses. Is this not a proof?
Moreover, your own self has written, and the esteemed mother of Hájí Abdu'l-Husayn wrote the same,
that through ascetic practices, He [the Báb] has attained spiritual advancement. Should one be the
recipient of divine favors and be blessed to receive such [heavenly] grace, surely God will protect Him
from satanic delusions. His honored person [the Báb] has written in many places, "If anyone is certain
in his own ways and denies My Cause, let him come forth and engage Me in mubáhilih." I take refuge

in God! How could One Who is so self-assured, be not of truth? If you claim that He suffers from
mental disturbance, I do not share your assess-

——————————————————
17\. Mubáhilih is the practice of opponents challenging one another to mutual cursing, expecting the truthful one

24        WORLD ORDER: SPRING 1999

ment, as how could it be that a person is unlettered while he is sane, but then when he is mentally
disturbed he becomes so erudite?

In short, that which must have been said has been repeatedly said. You know best how to act.

Convey my greetings to our mother and our sister and kindly tell them of my condition. For me, no
doubt remains. I have no proof, but my conscience directs me to see and perceive that this Cause is the
truth. What they [my mother and my sister] wish to believe is up to them. Further, they should be
aware that when the honored Hájí [the Báb] arrives in the city [of Shiraz], He will dismount and walk
to the house alone. Therefore, it is best not to inform the people, so that He may be left to Himself.
Until now it had been incumbent upon Him to obey the wishes [of the Báb's grandmother and mother],
but now it is the opposite, and they must strive to obey His every command. Under no circumstance
should they disobey Him.

I have no other matter to present to you. I have written a letter to Hájí ‘Abdu'l-Husayn, which you
will also see, and perchance some things said here will be repeated there as well. He requested the
appearance of some extraordinary event, such as revealing people's inner thoughts. Sanctified be God!
Repeatedly we have beheld that people [fortune tellers], for a couple of small coins, reveal other
people's thoughts, and that was nothing but Satanic deeds. But if one's heart does not attain certitude by
[His] knowledge and erudition, of what use is conveying such stories?         18

From Khál-i Akbar’s letter to his younger brother, Khál-i A'zam, it is clear that the Báb was
deeply affected by the lukewarm reception to His call. Although He had initially vowed to remain
silent for five years and to cease revealing verses, He later reversed this decision while in Shiraz and
continued to reveal many treatises, prayers, homilies, and books. It can readily be inferred that Khál-i
Akbar counted himself among the Báb's followers and was urging his younger brother to embrace the
new Message.   19

However, one must ponder what Khál-i Akbar understood about the Báb's claim and station in
May 1845. The uncles of the Báb were able to occupy their professions as merchants by receiving the
type of education—accounting and economics—and training readily available to the business class in
Iran in the middle of the nineteenth century. Their education also exposed them to widely known poetic
and literary works, particularly Hafez and Sadi. Khál-i Akbar himself was educated for a few years at
the same school in the Masjid-i Naw (the New Mosque) that, years later, the Báb would attend.
Although he had been given a rudimentary religious education (which consisted of reading the Koran
and a general history of Islam and its

basic jurisprudence), Khál-i Akbar did not receive the rigorous seminarian, education that many early
Bábí converts had mastered through devoting years to acquiring incredibly detailed learning. While it is
not clear, by the time Khál-i Akbar wrote the letters above, whether he had seen any of the writings of
the Báb, such as the Qayyúmu’1-Asmá' and the Commentary on the Surih of the Cow (which are filled
with subtle and complex allusions to the Báb's prophetic mission and employ very sophisticated
symbolism), in all probability, he would have been unable to discern their significance. One might
assert that the central claim of the Báb—-to Qá’imíyyat (Messiah-hood) and Prophethood—had
remained, therefore, essentially inaccessible to Khál-i Akbar. This assertion is further supported by two
important documents written by Khál-i Akbar s son, which clearly show that those who knew about the
Báb's claim generally thought Him to be simply a saintly figure, perhaps the gate to the Hidden Imám,
but no more. This misunderstanding stemmed from the inaccessibility of the Qayyúmu’1-Asmá', in
which the Báb advances a claim to be a Manifestation of God but in language decipherable only to
those with substantial training and Shaykhi background. While the possibility remains that the Báb may
have apprised His uncle of His mission orally, no such evidence is known. His instructing Quddús to
speak to Khál-i A'zam about His mission indicates that He did not wish to introduce it to His family
directly.

Two Documents Written by Khál-i Akbar s Son
Khál-i Akbar s eldest son, Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Taqí, known as Vakílu'd-Dawlih(the trustee of the
government), was born in 1830 and by 1845 had joined his father's trading business in Bushire,
occupying the former office of the Báb. He has written several important narratives, the first of which

to be considered here was composed in July 1906:

In J-2 [Jamádíy'th-Thání, a lunar month] A.H. 1324 [July 1906 C.E.]      21

The honored and revered Áqá Mírzá Álí-Akbaf-i Rafsanjání, who is numbered among the
foremost teachers of the Cause, has come to 'Ishqábád accompanied by Áqá Mírzá Tarázulláh Qazvíní,
the son of the illustrious Samandar, for the purpose of the Faith's propagation. The former has asked
that I write for him what I recall of the dawning of the Manifestation of the Báb and those kinsmen
who have been named the Afnán by the Ancient Beauty [Bahá'u'lláh]. Although because of the passage
of time, diminished memory, and advanced age, not all the details are recalled; however, to fulfill his
wish, the following is noted:

What this servant remembers of the decreed events is that before His declaration, the deeds,
manners, and associations of His Holiness [the Báb] differed from those of other people. In the
proximity of Shiraz's Masjid-i Naw, Masjid-i Fath [the Victory Mosque] and the Jewish neighborhood,
His exalted mother, who was an aunt to this servant [Vakílu'd-Dawlih], resided in the blessed house on
the Shamshírgarhá Street, situated between Masjid-i Naw, near the Fath Mosque and the Jewish quarter
of Shiraz—a house that is now the celestial Kaaba [Point of Adoration] of the Supreme Concourse.           22

presence of my exalted aunt. It was in A.H. 1260 [1844 C.E.], but I cannot be certain which month, that
one morning I attained the presence of the Báb. He was occupied with writing prayers. Melon was
placed before Him, and with the tip of a knife, He graciously offered me a piece. I ate it. He handed me
a page of a prayer, and, after I had read it, He asked, "What manner of supplication do you perceive
this to be?" I was familiar with the Sahífihy-yi Sajjádíyyih, recited each day of the week and, therefore,
replied, "It is similar to the prayer of Sahífih."  23

I remember that at that time the majority of mystics and ascetics of Shiraz were anticipating the
nearness of the Manifestation (Zuhúr). However, He had appeared but was concealed from all, except
from the believers and devotees from the Shaykhi faction, who upon the passing of the late Hájí Sayyid
Kázim had dispersed in search of Him. It was rumored that a certain Person had appeared, claiming to
be the representative of the imam (náyib-i imam), and His command forbidding the use of water pipes
was circulating among the populace. This servant asked Him [the Báb], "Is this true?" He replied, "Yes,
it is indeed so, and the use of water pipes is forbidden."

A few days later, He departed for Mecca and left us. My late father was in Bushire. In Bushire the
Báb had ordered the teaching of Shaykh Hasan of the 'Usfur family, the Imám jum'ih [chief imam] of
that city. Shaykh Hasan had neither accepted nor rejected His claim.         24

He boarded a sail boat, revealed a sermon, and then departed. In Muscat He won over the
allegiance of that city's imam and revealed homilies.

> Several important points in Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Taqí’s recollections should be emphasized:
> 1. Abrogation of the use of water pipe: Within the Shiite system of jurisprudence, it is solely the
mujtahid [Islamic legal scholar] who is authorized to pronounce on matters of personal law, and all
others must defer to him. Clearly, the Báb was not certified as a mujtahid. Therefore, the fact that He
had forbidden the use of such a commonly practiced habit as the water pipe illustrates that He had
assumed the right of law-giving. In an important way this pronouncement was tantamount to
innovation in matters of Islamic jurisprudence, signaling the abrogation of Shiite law.

2. The station of the Báb and how it was understood by his contemporaries: Even at the time of
the Báb's explicit claim to be a Manifestation of God in such early writings as the Qayyúmu'1-Asmá',
such statements could initially be deciphered only by those sufficiently trained. It is of interest that Hájí
Mírzá Muhammad-Taqí reports that the Báb was known at that time as the Representative of the Imám.
This suggests that the Báb had not yet chosen to divulge completely the full implications of His station.

3. The presence of Khál-i Akbar in Bushire when the Báb returned from pilgrimage: Hájí Mírzá
Muhammad-Taqi's recollections, written in 1906, clearly confirm that Khál-i Akbar was in Bushire
when the Báb returned from pilgrimage, providing further support to the

The following account by Khál-i Akbar s son was written some time after the one quoted above,
possibly in 1906, and provides further insight into the early days of the Báb and the reaction of Khál-i
Akbar to the events of that period:

hidden Tablet." The divines of the city had heard of this incident and gathered to issue a ruling against
these two Imám Jum'ihs—namely, the honored [Mullah Sádiq] Muqaddas and the honored Mullah
Muhammad-'Alí [Quddús]. These two esteemed personages were seized by the authorities and
subjected to punishment, including burning of their beards and expulsion from the city.

The officials were eager to seize the Representative of the Imám [the Báb]. When He returned
from Mecca, I was in Bushire. Day and night I would attain His august presence. All His time was
devoted to revelation of verses and prayers. One night it was the opportune moment for me to beseech
Him fervently and tearfully to pray on my behalf that I would have a good end. He responded, "Your
end is good."

During this period in Bushire, my late mother observed two or three miracles from Him. During
the days before His declaration, when He was engaged in trading in Bushire, He would frequently
come to the home of my late father and would shower him with His favors.

His demeanor was very different from that of others. I do not recall Him smiling. I do not recall
His exact utterances so that I could record them. In one of His tablets it is revealed: "All things will
perish, except His countenance." He also stated, "Our kinsmen have been reckoned among the 'Letters
of the Exalted.'" But not because they were deserving, nay, because of Our love for them." In the

course of the next Manifestation, this matter was asked of His [Bahá'u'lláh's] presence. He responded,
"By Afnán,' it is meant the kinsmen of the Primal Point, may the spirit of all be a sacrifice unto Him."        30

> Repressive Actions Following the Declaration of the Báb
> When Khál-i Akbar returned from Bushire to Shiraz in 1846, he fell under the cloud of suspicion
that had been cast over the members of the Báb's family. In fact, some time before his return and
shortly after the Báb's departure for Isfahan in 1846, the family felt the threat of the vengeful governor
and was compelled to destroy a large quantity of the Báb's writings. Mírzá Habíb Afnáns reports on
this matter are based on stories told to hirri by an eyewitness—Zahrá Bagum, the Báb's sister-in-law:

He [Husayn Khan, the governor of Fárs] further issued a command that henceforth should any
> piece of paper be found in that city bearing the Báb's handwriting or a verse revealed by Him, the
> members of that household would be punished by having their home demolished. Being a
> thoroughly ill-tempered person, he rounded up all the believers and devotees of His Holiness and,
> after administering severe beatings with sticks and causing them much injury, he extracted from
the victims whatever sum they could muster. . . .

After the governor's order was broadcast in the city, whoever had received such writings
> [revealed by the Báb] would bring them in bundles and deposit the packs in a long vestibule in
> the house of Hájí Mírzá Abul-Qásim. On one side of the courtyard all such writings were stacked

Báb was asked in what manner we were to dispose of those writings, and he replied, "These are

throw the water in the well of the courtyard."

We placed four large wash tubs on the ground of the courtyard, and,the four of us—that is, the

Khdl-i Akbar s Visit with Bahd'ulldh
The repressive environment following the Báb's declaration became more restrictive and arduous with
the passage of time. The real difficulty must have been, however, in trying to determine the exact
nature of the Báb's newly founded religion. It is likely that the Báb's uncle was never fully apprised of
the exact claims of the Báb, which included the abrogation of the Islamic precepts and anew mission
from God. Or, if he heard about the Báb's claims, the full implication of the evidence remained, by
virtue of his training, beyond his grasp. To understand the basis for this assertion one must consider a
number of events.

With the martyrdom of the Báb and the systematic persecution of the Báb's followers, the family
of the Báb and, indeed, the vast majority of the Bábí community was overcome with disillusion and
disappointment. By the late 1850s only one member of the Báb's family, His widow, Khadíjih Bagum,
remained firm in.her convictions about the Báb's mission. She kindled the faith of her nephew, the
young Áqá Mírzá Áqáy-i Núri'd-Dín, who, in turn, taught his parents about the Báb's claim. Afterward,
Núri'd-Dín began urging Khál-i Akbar to renew his commitment to the Bábí Faith by visiting
Bahá'u'lláh, the most prominent Bábí, Who was in Baghdad educating the remnant of the Bábí
community and winning new converts to the Cause. Núri'd-Dín's son, Mírzá Habib-i Afnán, reports the
following recollections spoken by his father:

At the beginning, when I broached the subject with Khál[-i Akbar], he would persistently
> refuse, and yet I would put forth more evidences and proofs [in support of the Báb's claim]. It
proceeded in such wise fór several meetings.

One day during our discussion, I was strenuously enumerating proofs, when, with
> amazement, Khál exclaimed, "Áqá Mírzá Áqá* are you saying that my nephew is the Qá'im of
> the house of Muhammad?" "And what if He is?" I responded. Thoroughly astounded, he said,
"That would be most extraordinary."

> To which I replied, "There is nothing strange about it!"
> After this comment, he became most reflective. Considering his condition, I smiled.

He asked, "Why do you smile?" At first I refused to answer and replied, "It might not be
polite on my part, and, therefore, it is best for me not to say."

However, he insisted, "Do not be reticent. Say what you are thinking."
"Since you wish," I responded, "I will comment. The objection, that you have raised is the

raised of old. He, too, exclaimed, Is it possible for my nephew to be the Messenger of God?'

> Yet it was.. Therefore, you must also exert yourself and investigate this matter. Know, assuredly,

> well able to have appointed your nephew as the Qá'im of the house of Muhammad. 'The Hand of
God is free.'"

Then the honored uncle responded, "The light of mine eye! What an irrefutable answer! There
is no further room for objection. What am I to do now?"

I said to him, "First, it is obligatory upon you to go on pilgrimage to the ‘Atabát [Shiite
> shrines in present-day Iraq] and there to visit your exalted sister—namely, the mother of the
> Báb—just as she, after the news of the martyrdom, proceeded to that land. Second, Íshán

After hearing these remarks, he responded, "Your words have penetrated my heart. I will do
as you say." 38

He wrote his [youngest] brother, Hájí Mírzá Hasan-'Alí, who was then a merchant in Yazd, of
> his intention to go to the 'Atabát and visit their sister and invited him to come to Shiraz so they
might journey together. On seeing this letter, the honored Hájí Mírzá Hasan-'Alí wrote, "I stand

will travel to the Atabát."

Therefore, Khál-i Akbar began to prepare for the journey and awaited the arrival of his

The actual sheets of paper on which Khál-i Akbar wrote the questions that he presented to
Bahá'u'lláh were found by Abu'l-Qasim Afnan, when he organized and classified the Afnán family
papers in the 1950s and 1960s. He gave a facsimile of the document to Muhammad-Ali Faizi, who
published it in Khándán-i Afnán. The following is a translation of Khál-i Akbar's questions, which

occasioned Bahá'u'lláh's revealing the Kitáb-i Íqán:

One: What previously was believed is that the promised resurrection will take place in
> another world. The raising of the dead, the Bridge, the reckoning of the deeds of all creatures, and
the reward or punishment of those deeds will také place in that world. However, if, [as the Bábís

from the threshold of God, are outwardly in a state of comfort and by reason of their

fathomed this subject fully, yet it is among the most important of matters to understand.

Two: From the inception of Islam until now it has been a belief of all the followers of the

traditions, prayers, and tablets of visitation have been revealed by the imams—that the Twelfth

Baha'u lláh describes Khál-i Akbar's visit in a tablet dated 27 Muharram A.H. 1306 [3 October
1888 C.E.], revealed in honor of Áqá Mírzá Abdu’l-Hamíd-i Shírází, a prominent Bahá'í in Fárs:

The Kitáb-i Íqán was revealed in Iraq especially for the honored Afnán, the illustrious Khál-i
> Akbar, upon him rest all My glory. The details are so: After he had attained the 'Atabát and
> completed his pilgrimage, he arrived in Baghdad. The exalted Hájí Sayyid Javád, upon him be the
> Glory of God, came into Our presence and said, "Two of the uncles of the Báb, may the spirit of
all be a sacrifice unto Him, at present have arrived in this city and soon will depart for Shiraz."

> We inquired, "Have you spoken with them about this Cause?"
> He responded negatively.

Upon hearing this response, We were saddened and said unto him, "Go and convey the
> greetings of this Wronged One to them and say further, 'Though We have not previously
> cherished meeting with others, We do desire meeting with you.'" The illustrious Javád completed
> the entrusted mission and that afternoon returned forthwith with the celebrated Khál-i Akbar, who
> was able to attain Our presence. We said unto him, "It is hard for this Wronged One to see that
> you and the other members of the Afnán family have remained deprived of the sacred Tree that
> has appeared and flourished amongst you." He responded, "There are certain considerations that
have prevented us from such acceptance."

We replied: "What are those things that have caused you to hold back from the Exalted
> Horizon and the recognition of the Sacred Tree? Present your questions." Another day he [Khál-i
> Akbar] returned, and, single and alone We met with him in the inner quarters of the house, and at
that time he spoke those questions that had prevented his recognition.

In Our presence answers [the Kitáb-i Íqán] were revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will.
That beloved and other friends of course know such details.

On another day he came into Our presence and said, "Ill-fated is the one who would peruse
this Book, and yet desist in his belief."  45

Fortunately, Khál-i Akbar's letter, dated 17 January 1861, to his son, Vakílu'd-Dawlih, and
written only a few days after Bahá'u'lláh revealed the Kitáb-i Íqán, has survived. Based on the letter's
date, it is possible to place the time of the revelation of the Kitáb-i Íqán in early January 1861:
O the best of the Protectors!

In the city of Yazd, Saráy-i Khán, please deliver this letter to my esteemed son, Hájí Mírzá
Muhammad-Taqí, the Shirazi merchant, may he ever be prosperous!              46

The loving light of mine eye, the one who is more precious to me than my soul [Khál-i
> Akbar's son], may God preserve you! I hope that you continue to live under the care of Almighty
> God and to be protected from all ills and wickedness and succeed in attaining your desired goals.
> If you wonder over our state, praised be God and His grace, on the night of the first of Rajab [12
> January 1861] we attained the threshold of the Shrines of the twin imams at Kázimayn, upon
> them be a thousand, thousand salutations and blessings. Your place was, indeed, empty. On your
> behalf we offered pilgrimage and prayers. God

5 Rajab A.H. 1277 [17 January 1861 C.E.]       48

The Kitab-i íqán, which Bahá'u'lláh revealed in the span of two days arid nights, was initially
known as the Risálih-yi Khálawíyyih [the Treatise for the Uncle]. Later Bahá'u'lláh changed the title to
the Kitáb-i íqán, or the Book of Certitude. Shoghi Effendi, in his history of the first one hundred years
of the Bahá'í Faith, describes Bahá'u'lláh's work as follows: "A model of Persian prose, of a style at
once original, chaste and vigorous, and remarkably lucid, both cogent in argument and matchless in its
irresistible eloquence, this Book, setting forth in outline the Grand Redemptive Scheme of God,
occupies a position unequaled by any work in the entire range of Bahá'í literature, except the Kitáb-i-
Aqdas, Bahá'u'lláh's Most Holy Book." The copy of the Íqán given to Khál-i Akbar was in the hand of
‘Abdu'1-Bahá, the son of Bahá'u'lláh. In a few margins Bahá’u’lláh had added comments or made
alterations. The Afnán family presented that copy to Shoghi Effendi; it now on display at the Bahá'í
International Archives Building in Haifa, Israel.   49

In weaving together several strands, it seems reasonable to conclude that the purpose of the
Kitáb-i íqán was not to convince Khál-i Akbar that the Báb was the originator of a "Cause," for Khál-i
Akbar had already accepted that He was the author of divinely inspired tablets, treatises, and homilies.
Rather, its goal was to disclose to the Báb's uncle the full station of the young Prophet, thereby
effecting Khál-i Akbar's complete conversion in which he would recognize the same power and
majesty that was manifested by all the Prophets of old.

After meeting Bahá'u'lláh, Khál-i Akbar proceeded to the Atabát and, after having met with his
sister, returned to Shiraz. There the Bábís came to meet him and to inquire about what had transpired in
Baghdad. Having met with Núri'd-Dín, a nephew of the Báb, Khál-i Akbar asked him also to enlighten
his sons about the true station of the Báb as an independent Manifestation of God. It continued in the
same manner for several years, and the Bábí community of Shiraz began to flourish once again.

Khál-i Akbar and the Bahá’í Faith
Eventually, in the fall of 1866, Nabíl-i A'zam, an itinerant teacher of the Faith, was instructed to
proclaim the new Cause of Bahá’u’lláh throughout the length and breadth of Iran. He came from
Baghdad by way of Ardistán to Shiraz and established his residence in the house of Núri'd-Dín. Before
anything else, as bidden by Bahá’u’lláh, Nabíl made a pilgrimage to the House of the Báb. Afterward,
the Bábís were informed and with great enthusiasm gathered around Nabíl. At first he spoke with great
circumspection. Mírzá Habíb Afnán, a son of Núri'd-Dín and a person knowledgeable about the early
days of the Bahá'í Faith in Shiraz, reports the following recollection of Núri'd-Dín:

One morning, Nabíl said to me, "Instruct all the believers to gather at a suitable location and
> to bring with them whatever writings they possess. You bring all the writings in your possession
> as well, as I wish to divide them into separate groups. I have a particular charge that I must
> announce and desire to leave Shiraz shordy as I must travel to other areas." Complying with
> Nabíl's request, I asked the friends to assemble in the home of Áqá Mírzá ‘Abdu'l-Karím [a
> prominent believer in Shiraz] and emphasized especially their bringing with them all the writings
> and tablets in their possession. At the appointed hour the friends gathered, bearing the tablets and
> sacred writings. After partaking of tea, Nabíl gathered all the writings and read each with great
> care. All the papers were separated into three groups and set apart each from the others. Having
> divided all the writings, Nabíl announced, "The first group includes the tablets of the Exalted One
> [the Báb]. The second group includes the writings of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'
> [Bahá’u’lláh], the very Person Whose advent was promised by the Primal Point [the Báb] to the
> concourse of the Bayán and made the acceptance or rejection of all that He had revealed in the
> Bayán dependent upon His good pleasure. With great clarity the Báb said, 'O people of the
> Bayán! The appearance of Him Whom God shall manifest is well nigh. Suffer not that the Bayán
> and all therein may deprive thee from His Manifestation.' 'The Bayán is like a leaf before Him.
> Were He to accept it, it is of His grace. And were He to reject it, it is a sign of His justice.' In
> another passage the time of His appearance has been fixed with precision: 'In the year nine, all
good will be realized.' He has now proclaimed His Cause and invites all people and the

> followers of the Bayán to His divine recognition. Whosoever accepts Him is considered of those
> that dwell in paradise. And whosoever rejects Him is of the people of fire and through fire they
> shall perish. The third group consists of the polemical writings, which are unworthy of
consideration." Nabíl then picked up the third group of papers and threw them into the stove

where a fire was burning.

Upon such pronouncements, a tumult was precipitated among the friends. For example,
> greatly agitated, the honored Khál-i Akbar, Hájí Mírzá Sayyid Muhammad, protested
> vociferously, "What manner of scheme is this? What sort of talk is this? Do you take faith to be
> like a weed; you cut it in the daytime, and it grows again during the night?" He went on in the
same vein.

It was then that I [intervened and] spoke calmly to Khál[-i Akbar], stating, "Assuredly, we
> must investigate and determine the actual veracity of such a mighty claim as this [the fulfillment
> of the promise of the Bayán]. It surely must rest on reality as none except the True One
> [Bahá'u'lláh]

has the temerity to advance such an assertion. Consider the time when the Báb was in Shiraz
> and proclaimed His divine mission. Was He not the Truth, and was He not sent by the exalted
> God to guide humankind? How was it, then, that all people rejected Him, vast multitudes rose in
> opposition to Him, and you yourself denied Him until you investigated, determined the truth of
> His claim, and drank from the chalice of assurance? Further, you hastened unto the Abode of
> Peace and there met His Holiness Ishán [Baha'u'-lláh], and the sublime book of Khálwíyyih [the
> Kitáb-i Íqán] was revealed specifically in honor of your good self. While in that city did you meet
> any person [worthy of such august claim] other than Ishán [Bahá’u’lláh]? Of a certainty, He,
> alone, is the essence of Truth. 'Beyond Truth, there is naught except waywardness.'"         52

After hearing such reasoning, the uncle of the Báb grew reflective and responded, "We must
investigate this matter thoroughly as the question of such a claim is not a trifling matter."

In this manner the disputation among the believers subsided on that day, and the honored
Nabíl was able to proceed toward Isfahan.

Afterward, the friends in Fárs, one and all, embraced the claim of Him Whom God will
> manifest—namely, the Blessed Beauty [Bahá'u'lláh]—and became firm and steadfast in their
allegiance unto Him. One question remains: In addition to the family's claim as reported above,

> is there any evidence from Khál-i Akbar himself to suggest that he actually believed in
> Bahá'u'lláh? And, if so, did he recognize Him as the one prophesied by the Báb? The answer can
be found in the final will and testament of the uncle of the Báb:

In the Name of God, the Glorious, the Most Glorious.
These few words are written as my will in the middle of Dhi'l-Qa'dih A.H. 1291 [circa 24
December 1874 C.E.]

First, I testify to the oneness and singleness of God. He is supreme and sanctified from having
> a partner. I further testify that the exalted and hallowed Person [the Báb] Who declared Himself
> in A.H. 1260 [1844 C.E.] is, indeed, of truth and manifested the glory and ascendancy of the
> Almighty God. Whatsoever He decreed in His religion and all that He revealed of the divine
> spiritual stations are all manifest truth, and whosoever obeyed Him is among those that were
> saved, and those that opposed Him, indeed, rank as the ones who perished. Today the one true
> religion of God is that which His Holiness [the Báb] ordained. And further, today, the master of
> the Faith and the propagator of this luminous community is the exalted and elevated Bahá
> [Bahá'u'lláh], may my spirit and the spirit of the world be a sacrifice unto Him. His Manifestation
> is the same as the Báb's Manifestation. Obedience unto Him is obedience unto God, and opposing
> Him is opposing God. Immersed in an ocean of sin, because of infirmities of self, this servant
> concealed his convictions from all, even from his children and kinsmen. But now I have
> committed them to paper so that after my passing they may become aware of their condition and
strive to understand the matter. God willing, they too will be numbered among those who believe.

I ask those who may come upon these pages, whether my children or kinsmen,

Khál-i Akbar, the great-uncle of the Báb, died in Shiraz in 1876 and, in accordance with his will
and testament, was buried where he wished. Bahá’u’lláh revealed a tablet of visitation in his honor,
which forever will immortalize his radiant memory.     56

Conclusion
Religious conversion is a process that often takes a lifetime of education and spiritualization. For Khál-
i Akbar, with all his advantages—being related to and a business partner of the Báb and having the
special privilege of meeting Bahá'u'lláh and of having a major work revealed in his honor—the process
was no less arduous and slow than that for anyone else who had not met the Twin Manifestations of the
Bahá'í era or who had lived in a different age. In the end, what proved beneficial for Khál-i Akbar was
his constancy of purpose in striving to learn the truth about the mission of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh and
the dedication with which he pursued this goal. His example in this regard will no doubt remain a
shining beacon for all who thirst for certitude.
