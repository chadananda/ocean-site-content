IN LOVING MEMORY OF

Hushmand Fatheazam
1924 — 2013

A dear and uncommon father who taught us that exploits of service can be
as much a way of life as they are the indelible marks of sublimity, and that
plain humanity can be as extravagant and fascinating as triumphs may tower
subdued and ineffable.

Foreword
The seven sessions of Irfan Colloquia in 2013 were partially devoted to the
jubilee celebration of the first election of the Universal House of Justice
in 1963. A historic part of `Irfán Colloquium programs in 2013 were the
presence of two members of the Universal House of Justice who had been
elected in 1963 and were still in this world. They were invited to address
the `Irfán Colloquia sessions and talk about their memories of that history
making event. They were Mr. Ali Nakhjavani and Mr. Houshmand Fatheazam.
Mr. Fatheazam was unable, due to his health condition, to personally attend
the colloquium and made his presentation through a video recording which
was screened in all sessions of the `Irfán Colloquium in that year. Mr. Nakh-
javani graced the `Irfán Colloquium sessions at the Acuto Center for Bahá’í
Studies in Italy and addressed those gatherings in both Persian and English.
His talks were video recorded and screened in other `Irfán colloquia
sessions in that year. These video recordings are precious documents on a
very important development in the history of the Bahá’í Faith.

In addition to those talks, Mr. Shahbaz Fatheazam, Mr. Houshmand
Fatheazam’s son, who had been an eye witness to those history making
developments, was invited to record his impressions of, and his thoughts
about that event, and the fifty years of functioning of the Universal House
of Justice as the supreme governing body and world center of the Bahá’í
community. The Last Refuge is Shahbaz Fatheazam’s narrative. `Irfán Col-
loquium Publications is pleased to present this narrative as an additional
document to the video recordings described above.

Preface
This paper celebrates fifty years of the establishment of the Universal

> House of Justice but it has not been specially commissioned. It is intended
> simply to commemorate what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has referred to as the day when
“the faithful rejoice”1, the election of the first historic Universal House of
Justice. There is the additional quandary that coinciding as this period does

> with my own personal life, any writing shall be suspect, not just by scholars
> who find my private perch from which to survey this exceptionally fecund
> period in modern Bahá’í history an invitation to a biased and an inevitably
> distorted angle of vision, but by others too who do not share my analytical
> introspection or feelings about these times. The argument is not so much
> about facts but about the experience of living through this period and
> feeling the immensity of the plans at work. Very few lucky enough to have
> witnessed that extraordinary moment will doubt that what is written here
> has been what most have felt but when one writes about one’s own time
> inevitably personal experience shapes the way we see events and even the
> way we assess the evidence — a very real danger whenever wondering eyes
> are fanned by ardor. For me, those 5 days in late April and early May, 1963, in
> Knightsbridge, London, where some 6,000 believers had gathered in Royal
> Albert Hall to greet the newly elected Universal House of Justice, is a part of
> the past which is still very much part of my present. I can still see the scene,
> as in a dream, the child of 7 peering over from one of the balconies, called

Shahbaz Fatheazam

boxes, at the scene below. The energy of this opening drama was palpable
even for a young lad who did not know why his father was standing, with
eight others, with his hands clasped and head bowed, before a cheering
multitude. For sure, a historian’s predicament and unease at the task of
deconstructing a spiritually charged, at times, seemingly mythical narrative
but, as fate would have it, my privileged, inalienable function to expose. I
cannot apologize for seeing through glasses ground by my father, an early
protagonist of this fascinating period of Bahá’í history but, as I am certain
I can never know what these early members of the supreme body of our
Faith thought privately, I am also certain that I have never been prevented
from learning what they said or wrote publicly. The various forms in which
such personal observations have occurred in the last fifty years may be
considered by the faithful as true, by some scholars useful, but never can
anyone ridicule as false. In the next few pages, we shall look backward over
the road at 10 Haparsim Street2 that led the Bahá’í community to where it
is now and the many questions that arose, were stilled and which persist
to this day regarding the many aspects of this divinely ordained, crowning
institution of the Bahá’í Faith. The problem of synthesis, however, of fitting
together the various manifestations of human thought and action, may, in
the end, have proved too challenging (fitter pens will do better on this
important task) and my attempt to address it may have failed lamentably,
but then only me to blame to have dared embark on this “perilous pleasure”
and justly to receive that very unhelpful advice given to the poor Irish
traveler inquiring about the way to Ballynahinch. He was told: “If I were you,
I wouldn’t start from here at all.”

The Last Refuge: Part 1

Introduction

> We begin with a brief, personal account. It recalls the events that trans-
> pired on my father’s final day at the Seat of the Universal House of Justice,
> significant not so much for the commotion of farewell, but for the thought
> uppermost in the mind of a man set to leave the stage. Mr. Peter Sjörström,
> at the World Centre since 2000 and working in the Secretariat for 12
> years, told me over dinner in Haifa once that as he accompanied both
> of my parents to the Council Chamber for their farewell with the House
> members (early in May of 2003)1 my father suddenly turns to him and says:
“You know, I have never met the Universal House of Justice before!” Peter

> said that these words stunned him and left him with an indelible impression.
> One simple, telling line but an ovation to an entire life’s learning. A feeling
> of unreality had possessed my father (or dispossessed him) for the sense
> of detachment was very strong, and one which broke the ego-self axis into
> pieces — the silent ego aware of a superior centre to which it was subor-
> dinate. But only in this way, perhaps, that my father could truly feel safe.2

My parents then emerged from the Chamber with a beautiful gift offered in
recognition of the many decades of service, a silver tray engraved with the
official seal of the World Centre above and etched with these simple words:

Shahbaz Fatheazam

> Hushmand and Shafiqih Fatheazam
> with heartfelt gratitude and abiding love
> The Universal House of Justice

Aside from the disarming simplicity of the souvenir, strangely, no date is
fixed on this inscription as if to imply that life’s temporal conjunctions, its
corruptible continuum of beginning, middle and end — do not matter as
much as the tree, its fruit and its essence that are left behind. This prelude
to our brief survey of the international governing body of the Bahá’í Faith
gives us a very special pre-disposition to a unique form of learning. When
my father uttered those final words there was no fear or confusion in his
mind. (These always act as barriers to understanding and response and
which often make worthless our intellectual facility). Here was proof that
mind and feeling need not be disjoined. My father made a return upon
himself. He had overcome intellectual discipline and had allowed the ac-
cumulated deposits of love to carry him and his wife Shafiqih inside the
Council Chamber. In this particular type of schooling, the clear perceptions
and decisiveness of adulthood are intertwined with the innocence and awe
of childhood. This is the vitality and health of the true intellectual, I believe,
one that clearly senses what is alien or destructive, what does not comport
with his or her moral vision, but matched with the humility needed for
self-awareness. And this is never possible if the ‘ceremony of innocence’ is
drowned. We may never be good teachers, my parents seem to say, but we
can always be diligent students — not just pupils who have grown older or
taller but active learners who have renounced the qualification of educator
to inherit the mantle of discipleship, but only after their fair share of testing
and questioning. (“Both teachers and learners go to sleep at their post, as
soon as there is no enemy in the field.”)3 In the dynamic and perpetual act
of (re)discovery and preservation, our inquiry is actually yielding (teaching)
useful knowledge, (re)search, and other massive constituents of intellect,
but all of these activities have, at its center, the enterprise of learning and
not a teacher’s training college. Father understood Goethe’s dictum that
one knows much only in the sense that one knows little.4 He also made

\[14\] The Last Refuge: Part 1

sure that the tree of knowledge did not rob him the fruit of life, eloquently
expressed in those few words on that emotionally charged morning in the
month of May.

> Such reading into the grammar of conduct of one man and his devotion
> to truth is clearly not to detract attention from the importance of meth-
> odology5 or to downplay the faculty of reasoning. Nor are we condemning
> the academic approach. Much less are we hinting at the other extreme,
> that personal belief alone is a balance by which all verities are assayed; or
> alerting the reader to the ironic danger of merging objectivity with what is

> mislead the reader in assuming that there is no scientific merit in choosing
> a genuinely incommensurable subject for which there is no comparable
> political or religious formula or sufficient grounds for impartiality (like
> Euclidean geometry) to fend off the assault of superstition. Controversy

‘acceptable’ objective — a putative pair and a moral dilemma which seems

> irresolvable even when we follow J.L Austin’s intelligent advice that when
> one member falls under suspicion, it is only wise to view the more inno-
> cent-seeking party suspiciously as well. The extreme rationalism of Leibniz
> and the extreme skepticism of Hume are to be avoided not just because
> one is indefensible and the other unsatisfactory but because knowledge
> is something in its perfection — timeless and ideal. We are forever in the
> danger of contrasting half-beliefs, albeit clearly and consistently, because
> reality is always more extensive than our current understanding of it. What
> is being proposed here is that no reasonable person can advance the
> claims of intellect without either acknowledging its perils and limitations
> or having only an imperfect grasp of intellect’s discipline. Intellect enjoys
> making distinctions and succumbs to definitions but these separate what
> it has belabored to distinguish and the parts are never rejoined leaving a
> deep void and a cognitive wound unhealed. Explanation can obscure truth
> and ideas may actually destroy it. Father was fond of saying that we suffer
> from an ‘illness of definition’. He mentioned this on several occasions. By

Shahbaz Fatheazam

this he meant that excessive analysis into the mysterious workings of God’s
Cause, like gazing directly into the sun, makes us blind. When we are struck
by this illness, we are harmed and afraid to experiment, to freely realize
our attempts to human plenitude in forming communities, in teaching the
Faith, in running Assemblies and so on. We wrongfully rely on palliative
definitions to encourage us to act but, in truth, we are moved to inaction
because there is no spontaneous innovation in applying the teachings. To
prostrate, fall freely to heavenly verses in praise of God or follow instantly
is as capricious as the arrogance of disbelief. Such opposite extremes are
the after-effects of the same illness, one resulting from the paralyzing mania
of never venturing beyond the invisible line of sterile obedience, the other
from stepping so far out that we develop a counterculture so strong as to
confuse the healthy intrusion of all that is foreign and new as debilitating
and life-threatening (as per the microscopic point of view) and which must
be fought at all costs. Short-sighted, hasty explanation, as much as the ar-
chitectonic, both, obscure truth and the emergence of ideas.6

While ideas develop as a system of thought and have been intellectually
worked out, these may actually denote a way of thinking and feeling which
is more emotional than rationalized and, paradoxically, such sentiments may
actually kill the peaceful conduct of ordinary life precisely because intellect
is rigid and allows no oversight. The practical arrangements needed for sus-
taining order always fall secondary to the formation of new ideas driven by
intellect — a common, universal ailment. As one nineteenth century student
of government famously warned: “Rigorous reasoning would not manage a
parish vestry, much less a great nation.”7

Intellect is not fixed but always relative to the culture, ideas, arts and
sciences, of the times. It needs aging before it is potable and safe and this
thought should make us prudent, and we are not just referring to young
minds but to all populations today that are ‘new’ in the sense that the history
of thought with its cemetery of formulas has taken away the traditional,

\[16\] The Last Refuge: Part 1

utilitarian role of ideology, the battleground of the intellectual.8 We must
not be allowed to be lured, or duped, by the blandishments of dogmas, of
the arts and sciences, and thusly make ourselves susceptible to the tempta-
tions of intellectualism with its inevitable incongruity and disease.9

A Bahá’í study (meaning one conducted by a Bahá’í rather than implying a
new scientific methodology for Bahá’í academics) is greatly assisted when
inspiration, that “influx of the human heart”10 rides on active participation
in Bahá’í affairs, in any capacity, at any level, independently of experience.
Not idle observation of an empirical nature but, quite literally, allowing
ourselves to be “… caught up in…the struggle of a very young community
to understand and express the ideals expounded in the teachings of its
founder”11 and “…show to the world a mature, responsible, fundamentally
assured and happy way of life, far removed from the passions, prejudices
and distractions of present day society.”12 Our conscious and, not seldom,
testing involvement in the work of the Bahá’í community is a pivotal point.
The act of service, the imprint of the true humanitarian enthusiast as the
American humanist Irving Babbit was prone to preach, strengthens our
understanding of Bahá’í society.13 It is within the domain of the actor, and
not just a supporting actor, where consistent corroboration of evidence
and information may be found to make any study and its conclusions less
prone to error and more acceptable to outsiders. But actors, one must add,
who comprehend their roles.14 The influence which such an analysis exerts
is greatly enhanced when the spiritual exposition intrinsic to it is done in a
language that epitomizes “…Bahá’u’lláh’s call for a style of communication
replete with tact, wisdom, fairness and integrity.”15 Such a desired outcome
is achieved, not through piety or a sub-intellectualized attitude for what
actually is, but by developing our true intellect through (a) obedience to
its limits, (b) broadening our platform of rationalization by being active
supporters involved in the new world community and (c) resisting to supine
religious conviction. All three combined to form the texture of a balanced
Bahá’í research because it ennobles us as human beings.16 At 79 years of
age (his age at the time of resignation), father personified this stance par

excellence and embodied the adage that intellect is the watcher and life
the participant, without considering too carefully how all his lessons were
to be applied in a temporal and mutable world below the moon.

There exists, however, a problem of a different order, namely, how to move
the information we have gathered into any form of conceptual framework.

The long tradition, especially in political science, of a comparative
approach17 confronts, in the idea of Bahá’u’lláh’s World Order, the formi-
dable proposition that there is no basis on which to test explanations or
theories. To put it candidly: “It would be utterly misleading to attempt a
comparison between this unique, this divinely-conceived Order and any
of the diverse systems which the minds of men, at various periods of
their history, have contrived for the government of human institutions”18
or, adding even greater perplexity to the student of politics: “…systems of
human polity, whether past or present, whether originating in the East or in
the West, offer no adequate criterion wherewith to estimate the potency
of its hidden virtues or to appraise the solidity of its foundations”.19 We can
try to systematically order empirical evidence and proceed scientifically
from description of this Order to its explanation and, eventually, prediction
as to how it may evolve but the unusually singular system of Bahá’í admin-
istration does not provide those universally recognized ‘facts’ of political
life from which to infer regularities across political systems or forms of gov-
ernment. What ‘fact’, may one reasonably ask, can be ascribed to the belief
that the origins of Bahá’í Administrative Order are “… those hidden springs
of celestial strength”20 or, that such a unique order relies “…solely upon that
mystic Source with which no worldly advantage… can compare…”?21 Critics
will say that such magnificent peroration just confirms that any and all
analysis is hopeless given the biased core of such a study and that religious
abstraction is not conducive to finding meaningful answers. This is a valid
objection especially when it is precisely at this first stage of theory building
— the formulation and description of the model — where it is important to
use words and concepts that are understood clearly, and in the same way,

\[18\] The Last Refuge: Part 1

by everyone. But the problem does not go away simply because the need
for just such a set of concepts is difficult to satisfy, difficult to understand,
and with a very unique and peculiar application not particularly helpful to
a study of this kind.

In trying to solve our dilemma we must ask the question: what exactly are we
to explain? A more refined concept of politics and society which develops
concepts that can ‘travel’ — i.e. are truly comparative across systems — and
can thus be related to the political process in various societies and to which
all people may easily connect? This clearly benefits research design but the
question is not just with method but with the substance itself, the ‘essential
institution’ of the Universal House of Justice, a very unique agency within
a very unique framework. Is analytical conclusion possible when we are
exhorted “to contemplate its administrative structure uninfluenced by
concepts from past ages…”?22

Barricaded by a model universe filled with deity of another realm, with
precepts composed ‘…with the tongue of power’ and ‘…written…with the
pen of might ’, we must quickly shift our logic of inquiry lest we are seen to
impair the validity of its results. And this must be done before comparativ-
ists start to elaborate their approach and begin investigating.

In a language written not to entertain nor to unhinge but to instruct, in no
controversial way, albeit with a deep cleavage of spirit, we are exhorted to
adopt a certain perspective which, in itself, has permanent appeal; namely,
that all good things, reason as well as revelation, nature as well as grace, the
commonwealth as well as the covenant, are equally, though diversely, of
God, ‘the Causer of Causes, and the Sustainer thereof’. Laws merely human,
if they are good, have all been copied out of the tables of that high everlast-
ing law which God made. Divine testimony and demonstrative reasoning
are kin. Words that surround us such as, “The Administrative Order… is, by
virtue of its origin and character, unique in the annals of the world’s religious
systems, ”23 or “…this Administrative Order is fundamentally different from

anything that any Prophet has previously established...”24 are not to be
picked like flowers and taken home but to be enjoyed where they grow.
Out of their rightful place, expressions can easily lose their meaning and
their essence becomes discolored, lost. In such an argumentative context,
explanatory primacy, then, should be our mental order and not the matter
or object of study. The focus must surely be on our belief proportioned
to evidence and not the evidence itself. Method is inseparable from spirit
and character. We must try and explain the Universal House of Justice in
terms of our spiritual understanding and not to break it into pieces to fit the
ornaments of puzzled minds, however sophisticated or time-tested.

Given that that there is no precedent in this ‘supreme institution’ of the
Bahá’í Faith, representing as it does a departure from past and existing
systems ‘both in origin and in concept’, any explanation offered cannot
provide for useful theory because the explanatory hypothesis requires not
only to explain the case on which it is being based, but also other cases
(governments or institutions) that fall into the same set. Such data simply
is not available. If the similarities that exist between the Bahá’í system
and other political structures are not congruent can differences, then, be
meaningful? What is the current predominant perception, we may ask, of
any particular political formula akin to the workings of Bahá’í Administra-
tive Order? If we cannot predict with certainty how the Universal House
of Justice is likely to evolve in the future then maybe we should redefine
study not on predictability but, at best, catalogue the major similarities and
differences. But, then, what are the essential components of comparison?
Is it government, societies, parties, policies, elections, et cetera?25

How any religious community evolves undoubtedly rests on its ability to
analyze its institutional set-up but in this particular instance, navigating on
such uncharted waters, our own analysis is confined by time and by the
extraordinary nature of the Bahá’í system, hence the need to shift our logic
of inquiry, a summons to which even the most tutored mind might incline to
heed.26 Such a change in mentality, far from being a distortion in our rational

\[20\] The Last Refuge: Part 1

attitude, or a mere impulsion which gives the appearance of logical or sci-
entific reasoning, may actually serve an important functional derivation in
the wider context of political thought. To quote one illustrious twentieth
century thinker of politics: “…when a political formula corresponds with
the mentality of the age and with the most widely shared sentiments of a
people, its utility is unquestionable.”27

Such incitement to a new form of reasoning is not to force historians or
political scientists to be more than a little credulous on the new conceptual
properties operating as causal factors in the political action of this unique
Order, revolutionary in its force yet evolutionary in the logic of its process28
but to permit, at the very least, that the near future be allowed to redress
the balance of our present incomprehension or imperfections in grasping
the full implications of Bahá’í Administration and to absolve any ingenuous
equivocation, at this early stage, between moral Bahá’í aspirations and its
practical consequences. More importantly, to avoid the unpleasant duty
of condemning history for having failed to realize the hopes and promises
which such an order may hold for mankind.

In a world today which, imaginatively and technologically, is seeing its com-
monwealth as possible and its interests as common, but resisting in that “our
single planetary globe is mocked by worlds of different understanding”29,
studying the Bahá’í model as a fresh frame of social relations definitely has
rationalist appeal although at odds with the dense facticity of political and
social practices in present day society and where discernment requires the
eye of faith. More importantly, we should inquire whether the Bahá’í model
is equipped to solve the terrible algebra of reconciling human fulfillment
with co-existence in vastly disparate societies? Yet even greater questions
are involved which the Bahá’í Faith addresses but which also have direct
implications for political theory as well: what is reasonable, for example,
for man to want and what should we really care about? How has the world
evolved and why is it the way it is? Have the traditions of understanding
politics accompanied the drastic changes we, as a species, have brought

into the world?30 How are we to achieve what we want and how to secure
it? Does any political theory contain the resources to show us how the
future can be made less grim?

These various propositions, entertainingly treated by political theorist
John Dunn in his book Western Political Theory in the Face of the Future
(1979), only provide the backdrop to the current study. But as interesting
as these propositions are and as complicated as the formation of a con-
ceptual framework has been shown to be we must forge ahead. We try
and show how a common will, not dissimilar to the doctrine of the general
will31, is formed for this particular central authority of the Bahá’í Faith, the
Universal House of Justice, to survive and how it remains vitally signifi-
cant in ensuring the welfare not just of the community it was created to
protect but “…to foster that which is conducive to the… advancement and
betterment of the world.”32 We shall also see how the outcome of a healthy
interaction between masses and leaders can be made to match, as closely
as possible, intended results without the politics which flows from intended
predicaments. But before looking at new history, we must see history itself
otherwise, as Tolstoy savagely said, we shall be acting “…like a deaf man
replying to questions which nobody puts to him.”33

\[28\] The Last Refuge: Part 1

Institutions, in their early years, as in the human child, are little indication
of their later personality. Methods and organization become more stable,
operations renewed, the process of maturation intensifies and stability
and change occur as identity and experience grow. But while maturation is
intrinsically determined and typically only moves forward, as in biological
growth, development, on the other hand, involves a myriad of skills and
milestones that may move forward but also may regress. Development of
a child, unlike maturation, involves (and sometimes depends on) significant
interactions with the environment and other people and inherent traits and
social influence, both, interact with equal importance to develop person-
ality. Similarly, the impact of the outside world on the development of the
Universal House of Justice cannot be underestimated. “And as the Bahá’í
Faith permeates the masses of the peoples of East and West, and its truth
is embraced by the majority of the peoples of a number of the Sovereign
States of the world, will the Universal House of Justice attain the plenitude
of its power, and exercise, as the supreme organ of the Bahá’í Common-
wealth, all the rights, the duties, and responsibilities incumbent upon the
world’s future super-state.”3

The environment, society, the interaction of people, both within institutions
and outside of them, by believer and disbeliever alike, have a powerful,
immeasurable effect on the personality of institutions. It is to this human
element we must now turn. We are not so bold as to vindicate Vico’s
proposition that one knows fully only what one has oneself made but our
effort must be seen as an attempt by an outsider leading to the door that
leads into the inside, and who tries not to fall over the imponderable gulf
between what has been made and constructed and what God has designed
and intended for this unique institution. To better understand our subject
is to understand the members of the House of Justice; after all, the plausi-
bility of Bahá’í administration rests upon the possibility of having exemplary
members and much of the function of institutions springs from the way they
are enacted. (“The strength and progress of the Bahá’í Community depend
upon the election of pure, faithful and active souls....”)4. Moreover, loyalty

and talent are important in organizing Bahá’í administration and in explain-
ing institutional coherence. Focusing on these lives, therefore, is entirely
relevant although the Bahá’í community is educated to know that there are
today no leaders in the sense of individual authority. The leader principle
cedes to the collegial principle as the bedrock of Bahá’í Administration.5

The most striking impression one has of the members of the Universal House
of Justice, the one that remains, is how human imperfection is preserved
and displayed on the public stage. No attempt is ever made here to boast
moral attributes or to imitate virtue. Affectations of sanctity, pretense
to mysticism, may be the favourite means of advertisement in the sham
spirituality of the medieval cloister or of modern creeds but in this unique
membership human virtue is compressed, not in the flourishing company
of ‘wit or worth’ but in another pair of attributes, of the vulnerable and
forgotten kind — humility and unconditional love, a love given freely and
forgivingly, ‘seventy times seven’.6

It is flaws, not hypocrisy, that triumph and rather than cast a shade on the
faith they profess, such shortcomings are the particular terms of endear-
ment of these men of the House of Justice. There is no pomp or special
robe to enhance ceremonial rank, no headdress to announce protocol, no
artificial redolence to flatter personal connection, no kissing of hands, no
booming sermon behind the pulpit, no ornamental embroidery to drape
ecclesiastical superintendency, no braying of canticles by rote.7 In their
presence, the air of mutual satisfaction is non-existent, no false estimates
of character to betray ambition, no vestige of supremacy. The legitimacy of
these members does not depend on their title of utility but on a position
advocated by God, resting on the permanent assurance of Bahá’u’lláh in
His Tablets that “God will verily inspire them with whatsoever He willeth…”.8
Such an agreeable mandate, such a working climate of assurance and
serenity never predisposes these, ‘the recipients of the Divine guidance’,
to intemperate enjoyment of tranquility much less, over-confidence in a
certain future ­— a future, alas, which they themselves acknowledged once

\[30\] The Last Refuge: Part 1

as ‘shrouded in mystery’.9 Of these men, these sons, we may say, swimming
‘in the same stream as Heaven above and Earth below‘, neither pragmatism

> nor the voice of oracles guide them but the authority of divine law and
> articles of faith. They are not public teachers of rhetoric but private pupils

> realities of the Kingdom…shall gradually be revealed and made manifest.”10
> Here exists a fascinating, daily, array of contrasts where the imperial

> the House of Justice were intense with a level of detail which stuns for its
> banality, as depicted in this entry of Ian Semple’s diary: “On 18th June, 1963,
> the House of Justice authorized the ordering of 40 bags of peat and ap-
> proximately 250 pounds of bone meal from Italy for the gardens.”)13 We see
> men, brethren, exercising cardinal duties in a supreme institution supplied

> similarity nor dissimilarity.14 Nine men, “as nine brothers…[who] deeply love

> feeling of joy and unity that [bind them] together”16.

A sequestered life, socially speaking, awaits these individuals after their
election, with no levity of discourse and all scrutiny and gaze: from every
eye they wish to hide, yet in every eye they dwell. Their human character,
however, mercifully preserves them to build the most pleasurable, the most
agreeable, the most useful and the most respectable of human qualifica-
tions. They teach us that by fulfilling the law, they are loosened from its
thunder and allowed to smile in its gentle rain revealing to those closest to
them that their deeds are the fruits of love and their love the fruits of faith.
We are harbored from their text-studying, their hard tasking, the weariness
of anxiety, the monotony of epistolary correspondence, the drudgery of
sundry, operational decision-making, the stocktaking of communities, and
all we are allowed to see in the functioning of this “great institution of the
planet”17 is a metaphor of dignity in prose, all the more striking for the human
toll borne in such sacrificial service making us to gasp, in one voice, “….how
valuable these nine members are in our eyes as Bahá’ís.”18 It would not be
wrong to say that these men lay their heads on stone, and sleep waking,
fixing “… their gaze by day and by night…”19 unable to flee the business
of the world or “…the heavy burden of work resting upon members…”.20
Self-sacrifice is their proper end. Our House of Justice is their home of
suffering. If we were to point to the one supreme difficulty affecting all
members it would be this: the mind, this engine of contemplation, is never
lulled to rest from the agitation of the world which distresses and tries
the power of concentration to the extreme, burdening them terribly with
ever-present, oppressive tasks. Their cry is compelling: ”Have pity on me,
have pity on me…because the hand of our Lord has touched me!”21

This unique office emancipates the members of the House from holding any
opinion of their own rectitude or from trading personifications of perfec-
tion or pitching penitence. This is because the repercussion of their solemn
obligation exercises them in the habits of humility, meekness, and patience
with nothing to show other than the visible proof that in God’s sight “the
deede is good because of the man and not the man because of his deede.”22
Theirs is not to “… justifie the wayes of God to men”23 but to pave the way of

and harmony among the members will always continue? In a sense it has
been a little like a love affair. The first incomparable days and months when
we were all overwhelmed and were bound together in an ecstatic affection,
ignorant though most of us were of one another’s natures, helplessly
relying on the guidance of God for what the future would reveal. Now, after
nearly four years [1967] we all know one another so much better, both our
virtues and capacities and our faults and shortcomings. The early rapture
only recurs from time to time, but its place has been taken by a profound
respect and love for one another — each one knowing the others and
knowing the others know him — yet for all our human frailties, for all our
bygone strongly held disagreements in consultations — no barrier has been
raised between any two of us. I can see, as I observe my fellow-members,
how they are growing in spiritual stature, understanding and breadth of
vision; and I know how I myself have grown and how I am even now aware
of so many faults of which I must rid myself. Time and again we stumble,
but each time we pick ourselves up and strive once more to be worthy of
the high calling which our fellow believers have thrust upon us. Now, thirty
years since I wrote those words, I can testify that the same spirit still exists,
and has persisted through all the vicissitudes and changes of membership
which those years have seen. ”29

“[A]n ethos of loving service’, we are always reminded, ‘pervades Bahá’í

institutional identity.”31

The idea of hierarchy, however, exists in the Bahá’í Faith and supports the
vision of order in the universe and within it objective degrees of value.
Some or even every form of being — transcendent, intelligible, and material
— have a particular position and an appropriate function, a great chain of
being with its own particular range of references.32 Bahá’u’lláh supports the

\[34\] The Last Refuge: Part 1

idea that the universe does not subsist by any other reason than because a
great order of difference conserves it:

“And amongst the realms of unity is the unity of rank and station. It redoun-

deth to the exaltation of the Cause, glorifying it among all peoples”.33

But hierarchy is not lordship nor is thearchy (the rule of God) mediated
through power or order, nor clerus or secular offices. Lower orders do not
come to union with God because some blessed with instant and intuitive
illumination reveal what is obscure to them. The medieval (defunct) idea
that multitudes should be so well arranged so that higher beings use in-
termediate beings to bring lower beings to union with God is non-existent.
In the Administrative Order conceived by Bahá’u’lláh, together with the
authority vested in elected corporate bodies (national, regional and local)
to make decisions, binding on the community is the spiritual, moral and
intellectual influence that the Administrative Order must exert on both the
lives of believers and the work of the Faith’s institutions. This influence
acquires a special character through the services performed by individuals
who are appointed to high rank and charged with functions relating to the
protection and propagation of the Faith.34 In practical terms, these duties
are now carried out by the Continental Counsellors who receive their
guidance from the International Teaching Centre, ‘an institution whose
mandate is global and which functions in close proximity to the Universal
House of Justice’. Those appointed or elected to institutions capable of
directing the thrust of efforts exerted by the generality of believers, be
these in the branches of the ‘learned’ or ‘rulers’, are always susceptible to
tests of character because of our very human temptation to venerate of-
ficeholders (or ourselves), at the risk of causing a deprivation displeasing to
Bahá’u’lláh Himself: “Ever since the seeking of preference and distinction
came into play, the world hath been laid waste. It hath become desolate.”35

It is our natural tendency as human beings to categorize people in certain
groupings with exaggerated significance in our imaginations. We tend to

think that Bahá’ís in official positions are fundamentally different. Personali-
ty and character differences not inevitably are associated with nominations
to Bahá’í administrative posts. This overly strong and natural tendency to
categorize people in certain occupations and positions is related to what
psychologists have dubbed ‘the fundamental attribution error’.36 While
this theory is developed in the study of professions (why some become
bankers, others teachers, still others artists and so on), it does not mitigate
the fact, nor lose argumentative force in our special context, that we tend
to attribute the behavior of others to personality differences far more
than warranted. Aside from distorting the true nature of the individual at
the centre of attention, such proclivity may actually engender a sense of
envy.37 Another conspicuous (more positive) and pervasive human impulse,
however, may be more pertinent and more germane to Bahá’í community —
after all, the decisive characteristic in Bahá’í administration is the essential
spirituality with which institutions are imbued (“…institutions…can become
really effective only when our inner spiritual life has been perfected and
transformed.”).38 There is an enormous literature in modern psychology
confirming the importance of self-esteem but in mature people the desire
for praise is transformed into a desire for praiseworthiness which cannot be
interpreted as self-adulation or egocentrism. Adam Smith, more commonly
associated with the impulse of self-interest for his free-market theories,
writes this surprising observation in his first book, The Theory of Moral
Sentiments (1759):

“The desire of the approbation and esteem of those we live with, which

> is of such importance to our happiness, cannot be fully and entirely
> contented but by rendering ourselves the just and proper objects of those
> sentiments, and by adjusting our own character and conduct according to
> those measures and rules by which esteem and approbation are naturally
> bestowed. We are pleased not only with praise, but with having done what
> is praiseworthy.”39

\[36\] The Last Refuge: Part 1

This desire for praise was one to which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded with
profuse readiness given His prodigious and varied correspondence marked
by intimacy, warmth, forbearance and, of course, praise, all exploited by His
sin-covering eye.40

There can only be one consequence when living in the holy and venerated
grounds of Haifa and Akka — that of a clear and gradual transmutation in
one’s acquired character, drawn frantically to others with similar holy breath.41

> We’ve no regards for words or language
> We look for spirit and behavior
> We see the heart and if that’s humble, ignore the words ….

Jalâl al-Din Rumi, Poem 29

These sacred hubs inevitably change our outlook on life and its expecta-
tions, if for no other reason than for geographically nesting in the bosom of
God since the beginning of time — a historical continuity which gives Haifa
its historical individuality and magical qualities:

“This mountain is a holy mountain: it has always been sanctified. The

> prophets have always loved it. Christ has trodden on its path; Elijah lived
> upon it. The wind is sweet on it, the flowers are many, the view is wonderful.
> When you come up the mountain many fragrances reach you; the pure air
> gladdens you; the beauty refreshes you. So the mind is made single, the
> thoughts are purified; the spirit turns to God.”42

This unique neighborhood with no bounds to its spiritual jurisdiction
threatens to bring the best in us, its giant, ionic pillars always reaching
to the sky, the sky representing the birds, flight yielding the all-important
auspices. Our ego is erased to release the consecrated self-similar in effect
to the transfigured souls who were sanctioned with the privilege of meeting
Bahá’u’lláh, `Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi in their day.43 Independent
of the individual’s function, high or low, formal or informal, institutional

> conversion with lasting effects, most especially humility in our intellectu-
> al endeavours. But this kind of humility can be a screen if we use it as a
> reason for not serving. A distinguished American Bahá’í reminds us that “…
> the dividing line is not how much we know — not how many books we have
> studied — but whether we passed from inaction to action, because we are
> pledged to serve, and ‘Abdu’l-Baha has pledged to serve us if we serve
> Him.”44 We are qualified to serve if we serve. The Bahá’í World Centre,

> metropolis of Acre and Haifa, is an inviting gravity of invisible energy which

Conclusion

The Last Refuge: Part 2

Authority Reviewed
On our most recent pilgrimage as a family (December 2009), we had the
privilege of visiting the Terraces on Mount Carmel. The exquisite detail in
every corner of this unique monument to landscape architecture is a feast
to the senses: footstone and flora intertwine with shaven marble and stone
balustrades bordered by tossing trees and bright flowerbeds year-long, en-
croached by the sound of running fountains continually purging their dross,
flanked by water ducts under the vigil of eagle statuettes. This blessed
mountainside of sight and sound has had earth removed and concrete
poured in equal volume (100.000 cubic metres each) from foot to crest a
kilometer long, but with no sense of vanquish or conquest from either soil
or mortar, explained not by their intrinsic materiality, but that both, equally,
earned their colors by lying low. Amram Mitzna, Mayor of Haifa at the time
of the inauguration of the terraces in May 22nd, 2001, writes: “The chiseled
and sculptured work coordinates with the colorful plants, creating beauty,
harmony and tranquility.”1 The trilogy — beauty, harmony, and tranquility
— conceptually banded together from time immemorial as ultimate values
breeding truth and virtue — virtue aiming at beauty and beauty at truth —
may well make up the psychic hierarchy necessary when approaching the
subject of authority.2 Men have always given greater priority to social or
political hierarchies and have articulated these as building blocks in historic
definitions of authority3 but in Haifa, with its particular canon of supernal

imagery and style, these seem to push us in another direction. Surround-
ed by forms of exquisite regularity and uniformity, by constructions that
excel in proportion and wrapped in graceful art — handiwork which,
while drawing attention to itself, nevertheless leaves the cardinal object
invariant and centered — teaches us symmetry. Might not all this portrayal
of beauty conveyed to the pilgrim lead us to ponder upon a broader ap-
plication of the concept of authority, one that applies to a law namable
by harmony and reflecting a deeper reality — an authority which is able
to tear away all impediments standing in the way of discovering what is
true and permanent in human beings?4 The reaction to symmetry goes
far beyond the mere assessment of beauty and harmony. It is about the
discovery of hidden and important truths. “Comprehending the universe
means understanding its symmetries.”5

Discovering the equivalent to a law in physics is an obvious application of
the symmetry principle. Laws in the social sciences, however, are a remote
copy and are only as valid as their underlying assumptions. Their applicabil-
ity to real-world phenomena can also be overrated. There exists so much
faith in certain notions, however, that it presses us to discover or create
an equivalent mathematical law for social theory.6 The idea of authority
has indeed been examined in this light of autonomy, most revealingly in
the social sciences and their prophets of the early nineteenth century to
the 1920s who sought to work out roles for authority consonant with the
autonomy of the social sciences and especially scientism, in the shape of
French positivism, identified by its founder, Auguste Comte (1798—1857).7
His solution was to assign spiritual authority priority in the direction of
social progress and with it, innovation; and political authority priority in
the maintenance of social order and to insist upon their mutual separation
and inviolability. The great pioneers of the new sociology recast authority
as categorically detached from its political connection with coercive power
but as social authorities with little relevance to modern society. Later, Emile
Durkheim (1858—1917) assigned authority to the declining repressive type
of archaic society where old people, the unique intermediary between the

\[52\] The Last Refuge: Part 2

present and the past, give authority its waning traditional status. Max Weber
ignored the anthropological principle of authority and taught us that the
religious and natural hierarchies such as the church and family, the social
roots of authority, were declining institutions and supported by inertia.
His inquiry gives the modern idea of authority the rational organization
of a highly integrated modern industrial society with impersonal rules and
faceless offices — Weber’s famous legal-rational authority, empowered by a
formalistic belief in the content of the law (legal) or natural law (rationality).
For him, obedience is not given to a specific individual leader — whether
traditional or charismatic — but to a set of uniform principles and rules.

After Weber, the contemporary intellectual approach to authority tended
to defend the familiar liberal ideas, including those of the democratic limits
upon and accountability of authority. Such radicalization was a post World
War II phenomenon which saw in totalitarianism the justification of coercive
power in authority but not just as a case of political abuse but as the key
to the ubiquity of oppressive authoritative power throughout society in
general.8 All kinds of authentic authority are denied — social stratifications
and its divisions into classes as represented by layers of subordination and
superordination, our natural capacities and acquired merit, the delegation
of rights, the authority of age and experience, the authority of the author,
both in terms of a special regard for founders and their foundations and
in terms of the viability of executing pre-determined agendas initiated by
them. These are denied not because they have been corrupted by their
association with power but because they are in themselves illegitimate
exercises of power. The functions of personal respect, social continuity and
individual well-being are better served by the untrammeled interaction of
absolutely free and equal individuals. “The only freedom which deserves
the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way’, said the most
celebrated of its champions9 disdaining the fact that such a perspective
lies at the very root of the ancient conflict between freedom and authority
and which brings us to the central question of politics, obedience, and its
corollary, coercion. ‘Why should I (or anyone) obey anyone else?’ ‘Why

should I not live as I like?’ ‘Must I obey?’ ‘If I disobey may I be coerced and if
so, by whom, and to what degree, and in the name of what or for the sake of
what?’ Law, we are told, is always a fetter, even if it protects us from being
bound in chains that are heavier than those of the law. And underneath
the political question ultimately lies the moral and religious one, namely,
individual freedom.10 It is here, amidst the battle lines drawn between the
cool head of science and positivism and the often distempered head of
religion that modern man’s political odyssey lies.

“A freeman’, said Hobbes, ‘is he that…is not hindered to do what he has a will

> to do.”11 This has been the classical definition of freedom as understood by
> most (English) political philosophers, namely, an area within which one may
> act unobstructed. What, precisely or conveniently, this area of non-inter-
> ference is represents the thorny topic of generations of thinkers of all hues
> across all areas of study, but it is to the original proposition that a caveat
> must be made. Firstly, the doctrine of freedom is comparatively modern.
> Individual liberty as a conscious political ideal was scarcely discussed in the
> ancient world or in the legal conceptions of Romans and Greeks, much less
> in the Jewish, Chinese or any other ancient civilization. So the domination
> of this ideal has been the exception rather than the rule, even in the recent
> history of the West. The present generation, we can say, is in an interesting
> stage in the history of the idea of authority, where the individual, more
> than government, has become the subject of discussion. Authority today
> has become more a question of relation among psychic elements and the
> degree to which we, as individuals, have internalized the social relations of
> authoritative power.12

A second problem associated with the prominence of liberty as a focus
of concern is that individual freedom is not everyone’s primary need —
freedom is not synonymous with the absence of frustrations of any kind.
The peasant needs clothes and shelter and medicine much before, and
more than, personal liberty.13 Of course, the minimum freedom he needs
today and the greater liberty he seeks tomorrow is identical to million-

\[54\] The Last Refuge: Part 2

aires. A third restriction is that evidence of history tends to show that
fiery individualism grows at least as often in severely disciplined, not ‘free’,
communities, such as the military or puritan religious denominations and
this can knock down the argument that liberty is a necessary condition for
the growth of human genius.14 Liberty is not incompatible with an autocrat-
ic form of government or the absence of self-government — there is no
necessary connection between individual liberty and democratic rule, or
variants of democracy. In mid-nineteenth century Europe, for example, the
approach to freedom was through an actual weakening of the structure of
authority, thus enhancing individual rights; in America, the same gain to in-
dividual rights and freedom is obtained through diversification of authority,
through one type of authority being held in check by another. Who governs
me is logically distinct from the question how far may I be interfered by
government. To quote Berlin: “Just as democracy may, in fact, deprive the
individual citizen of a great many liberties which he might have in some
other form of society, so it is perfectly conceivable that a liberal-minded
despot would allow his subjects a large measure of personal freedom.”15

The question that must be asked is this: is individual freedom, even in the
most liberal societies, the sole, or even dominant, criterion of social action?
After all, we compel children to be educated, we forbid killing, we agree
that cruel pleasures like hunting or perverse excitements are worse for
us than the amount of restraint needed to repress them. Is the debate
on the limits of authority or its locus — in whose hands authority should
be placed — so dominant as to preclude all other novel experiments in
living? Is the discussion of absence of public intervention (individual
freedom from external interference or, more precisely, a maximum degree
of non-interference compatible with the minimum demands of social life)
or presence of rule (freedom to pursue self-realization, self-determination,
collective self-direction by some public power or participation in govern-
ment)16 as fundamental to a peaceful society as the argumentation over
the centuries seems to suggest? If parts of humanity are unaccustomed
to freedom in small concerns how can these learn to use it in great affairs?

Such petition, of course, begs the question that our universal inquiry and
the choices inherent to it are precisely why liberty is so dear to us but also
why it cannot be unlimited. Respect for the principles of justice or shame
at gross inequality is as basic as the desire for liberty although freedom and
equality, as has been observed almost to the point of triteness, are strange
bedfellows and have a certain propensity to consume one another.17

A wider question, especially in the Bahá’í context, still remains: can we as
human beings ever receive enlightenment enough to tolerate or have faith
in a single criterion, proven to be such a deep source of satisfaction both
to the intellect and to the emotions? Is ordinary human knowledge enough
to construct belief in a final solution in the sense that all positive values in
which men have believed must, in the end, be compatible or even entail
one another, something in nature which binds liberty, equality, and frater-
nity together? Or better, are we capable of ridding ourselves the errors of
childhood long after having recognized the very truths needed to destroy
them, truths that have involved our moral, religious, intellectual, economic
and aesthetic values which are, in their turn, bound up with our conception
of man and of the basic demands of his nature?18

In discussing government or tradition in general, we find the development
of individuality an annoying, permanent feature. It destroys the idea that
politics can be shaped by rational understanding alone.19 Is the unfolding of
reason, the cultural passage from superstition to rational comprehension,
trusting enough as a weapon to reject political claims based on supposedly
sacred authority implied in Bahá’í polity?20 Let us examine the evidence.

That we are all individuals is a palpable biological fact and to be individual
is to be distinctive; to be an individual is not distinctive at all — it is simply
a common human fate. The danger lies in a particular brand of the indi-
vidual. “Being individual is an almost purely aesthetic category and on the
whole an affirmative one. Being an individualist is plainly a moral category
and veering strongly towards a negative one.”21 To be individualist, then,

\[56\] The Last Refuge: Part 2

goes beyond being individual and makes a vice out of necessity and is well
on the way towards clashing with the interests of others, even denying
any affective commitment of one human being towards another. There is
nothing inherently wrong with the fine cult of individuality which generates
respect for the efflorescence of human personality and creativity but this
same cult of individuality when turned into a self-subsistent politics of its
own (not unlike anarchism), is seen as ‘a tasteless exercise in vanity and
self-deception’ and which today’s world of financial capitalism fosters a
narrow egoist individualism at the expense of free, inventive and generous
individuality what Nisbet forewarned in his book Twilight of Authority (1975)
as individualism “which reveals itself less as achievement and enterprise
than as egoism and mere performance.” Where moral sufficiency in our way
of life grows weak, so too allegiance to reason, tolerance, even government
by consent; where the core of confidence around which our liberal values
manifest themselves melts down, so too hope in the availability of all men
of viable individual life, vocations and calling. “Barbarism,’ observes Ortega
y Gasset, ‘is an absence of standards to which appeal can be made.”22

It is interesting that John Locke, considered as the leading apologist of
liberal constitutionalism, predicates this particular feature of liberalism,
namely individualism, on an explicitly transcendental and extra-human
order of value, God. This is of some importance for a historical under-
standing of liberalism. God, the Creator, Locke says, determined the ends
of man, his creature; and all the values which we defend must be seen
as vehicles of God’s purpose for man. Government and society were con-
trivances devised for man through his own reason bestowed by God. As
such, government is to be seen as a subordinate practical convenience,
not a focus of value in itself. (Locke’s advice resembles the Bahá’í belief in
action where the believer is reminded never to confuse means with ends
or to allow the instrument to supersede the spirit. “Say: O servants! Let not
the means of order be made the cause of confusion and the instrument of
union an occasion for discord”)23. Reductive egoistic individualism, Locke
explains, is the ugly result of what the human condition becomes when

this extra-human authority is removed. “A dependent intelligent being,’ he
wrote, ‘is under the power and direction and dominion of him on whom he
depends and must be for the ends appointed him by that superior being. If
man were independent he could have no law but his own will, no end but
himself. He would be a god to himself and the satisfaction of his own will
the sole measure and end of all his actions.”24

What can democratic society, with their ‘shell institutions’25, say in reply
to the libertarian and, secondly, does the politics of pure individuality, in
itself, represent a viable political arrangement? We shall answer the second
part of the question first. To believe that there might come to be nothing
but purely private life is espousing fantasy. Individualism may be splendid
in its transcendence or in the vigour of its self-expression, but it suggests
History in the classic pose of the ostrich. A certain Left Hegelian author
summed up the politics of pure individuality in a memorable if derivative
apothegm: “the egoist…has nothing to say to the State except ‘Get out of
my sunshine’ “.26 Of course, individuals are society’s smallest units and such
consideration is hardly sufficient for treating them as a commanding focus
of value or to tolerate their idiosyncratic tastes and opinions.27 It is in the
nature of the liberal-democratic type of government28 to deny that there
is any objective science of society or of morals and that in the last resort
truth is a matter of individual conscience where all consciences are held, by
an act of faith, to be equal either in the sight of God or in the sight of man
but it is hard to see how individuals can make valid claims to a measure of
tolerance over and above what the majority of their society is inclined to
give them when individuals themselves are cultural arte-facts and social
products and the majority itself constantly changing. Liberal values today
still have their attractions but cannot enjoy their privileged relation to the
historical process indefinitely.

We have learnt, as a species, that the ideal of springs of cooperative
wealth flowing abundantly to touch the most distant human estuaries is
looking rather thin as a political program or philosophy.29 Defenders of

\[58\] The Last Refuge: Part 2

liberal democracy acknowledge that as we enter the second decade of the
twenty-first century intense ideological and institutional conflict need to be
resolved to prevent its suicide but that the main threat, some even say with
overstated artistry, is not from within but from forces outside its domain:

“…[L]iberal democracy in general…face[s] three serious opponents: radical

Islam, a rising autocratic China, and the forces of global governance.”30

In answer to the other half of the question, of what can democratic society
say in reply to the egoist, this has partly been explained in the preceding
discussion. Any truth held by the individual is fallible. Rulership, therefore,
will be conditional and temporary as the views to what is true and therefore
proper for government to act upon will change from time to time with
opinion fluctuating among the body of ‘people’.31 And when this opinion
is not unanimous it must be representative of and responsive to the
majority. But the majority must change (so too the minority) otherwise with
permanent minorities and permanent majorities serious problems arise
for the maintenance of the system. This deadlock is explained by Pareto’s
optimality where it is postulated that no individual in society can increase
his own satisfactions without thereby causing someone else to diminish
his. This causes pressure groups and political parties that are so disposed
to fear for the increased satisfaction of other groups to be obtained at its
own expense, and consequently resist the policies of these other groups
and strive desperately to preserve the status quo. But preserving the
status quo does not perpetuate a free and equal society. One can argue
whether this is stability or immobilism but there is no doubt that the same
groups playing the same roles and pursuing the same policies by the same
techniques on much the same sorts of occasion makes for a system insen-
sitive to the needs of an ever evolving society.32 The abolition of slavery in
America in the nineteenth century and enacting civil rights legislation in the
twentieth century are just two examples of how determined the effort to
political change, in fact, strengthened society.

But is there not in the idea of an ever-evolving society and its social inter-
dependence, the seeds of inequality and political instability? Can any in-
stitution be changed to reward the better side of human nature?33 Is there
a special guidance on how to realize our conceptions of civilization and
justice in economy, society or polity, in face of the palpable obstructions
to allow for the sacred community to be born and to operate peacefully, in
unity, and with desired ends not only agreed but secured — ‘the construc-
tion of a moral island in an amoral ocean’?34

Fashioning such a world pressed by the demands of history forces us to
seek, not the temporary comfort of utopia or the idyllic state, but the
full truth of a synoptic vision addressing a new relation with a new type
of authority and a new type of custodian of aspirations that are authenti-
cally universalist, practically international and untied to old structures of
domination considered impossible to dismantle.35 After all, a world without
social organization of some sort is simply unimaginable. But we cannot
dismiss liberal democracy as failure nor do Bahá’ís shun the concept of
liberty which democracy values.

> have suffered manifold afflictions, that ye might prosper and flourish”.36

In the Bahá’í Faith the relation between democracy and liberty is viewed
differently from the popular (ideal) nexus of elections (practice of
democracy) and the preservation of freedoms (liberty). While the Bahá’í
idea of government allows all adults (21 years of age and above) to actively
participate in the selection of its leaders, the protection of basic liberties
of speech, assembly, religion, and property can only be guaranteed by ap-

Our narrative thus far seems to suggest a passionate faith in the future,
an untroubled confidence in our power to mould it, especially if allied
to a capacity for realistic appraisal of its true contours, and a sensitive
awareness of the tendencies of a particular political and historical milieu.
While comforting and commendatory, this mood can quickly turn into
parody if our ability to hear the distant hoofbeat of the horse of history is
not followed by a superhuman effort to leap and catch the horseman by the

coat-tails, to paraphrase Berlin. Not the heralds of a bright and cloudless
civilization of the future, our generation must listen for this fateful sound
more eagerly than any other and be preoccupied with its own vivid world,
deciding to act and not to react. Our audience is not just immediate but
in centuries to come. Sensing the larger picture with ‘seismographical
accuracy’ and revealing hidden substrata is not something to be admired
as virtuosity but to heed as a warning to save the future; it is done by in-
terpreting the present with a vision from the not too distant past which
explains both historical change and that which promotes the peace and
tranquility of the world. But readers are too wounded and deceived in
always seeing any explanation only explaining away and every chorus line
only denying the given. But neither should disbelief or total skepticism be
considered a suitable inclination for even the least schooled and innocent
amongst us, forced to wander self-blinded. In the “worthy agencies of that
Divine Polity which incarnates God’s immutable Purpose for all men”41 the
Bahá’í proposal is not a rival type of knowledge nor mystical conservatism
but a belief in a single, serene vision, too indivisibly simple and remote from
normal intellectual processes to be assailable. Its mere possibility, however,
needs a fight, fought not with pitchforks or knives, or power or knowledge,
but, paradoxically, by resisting, by unburdening both intellectual infallibil-
ity and our sense of perpetual moral error. If we are poorly endowed to
reconcile, (or too honorable to leave unreconciled), the conflict of what
there is with what there ought to be, then a higher realm containing a per-
ception far above that of any human being — a greater realism — must be
independently sought. Why resist or turn our backs to the content of this
greater realism when our very innate faculty — the faith instinct — won’t let
God go away?42

The Last Refuge: Part 2

‘The Religious Danger’1
One of the most important founders of Sociology, Emile Durkheim
(1858–1917), was not wrong when he said that in the very origins of religion
is society. A religion may or may not have a belief in heaven or hell, may
or may not have gods in the ordinary sense, may or may not have rites,
ceremonies, priests or formal worship, but what religion always has is the
sense of the sacred community.2 Durkheim’s older contemporary thinker,
Karl Marx, similarly saw the utilitarian role that religious belief plays in
binding communities together. But both were wrong in seeing religion as
a product of material conditions of the groups that pertain to it. Religion
can never be explained simply by reference to prior material conditions.
Religious ideas have played an independent role in shaping political
outcomes.3 Its magic and its art as well as its doctrine and philosophy, have
played a central part in humanity’s major episodes, most especially in the
evolution, not just of society, but of the good society identified as one
which “gives freedom to all its citizens and encourages them to achieve
their full potential — physical, mental, and spiritual.”4 Religion has contrib-
uted the most to this noble concept, directly and indirectly, since earliest
times. In the religion of Abraham, for example, we see the idea and central
importance of a covenant where God guides man on condition that man
abides by His laws. Obedience comes to be seen not just as a duty but as
a right to receive — a novel calculus with implications not just for individ-

ual conduct but social advancement in general.5 Its twin secular version
reappears in Rousseau’s ‘Du contrat social ou Principes du droit politique’,
intact with the same suprahuman, indivisible, and inalienable qualities —the
idea of a higher, ‘General Will’ — and even given the status of the ‘voice
of God’. It similarly demands unqualified obedience of every individual,
the complete surrender to an omnipotent liberator who shall deliver, but
which Rousseau calls the state.6 The Covenant of Abraham was renewed by
Moses and restated in terms of specific teachings to be known as the Ten
Commandments, inspiring a vibrant civilization under the reigns of David
and Solomon and uniting the Israelites. Similarly, other world religions, like
Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism, (the last being
more a philosophy rather than religion and with the added deficiency of
emphasizing solely worldly matters) have to be credited for the brilliance
of their civilizations and for their continued hidden strength in man’s quest
for community, but a chronological narrative is not our objective here.7 It is
to show how much these religions contain the ethics necessary for a stable
society, how they have established important reforms and their impact on
the community of man comparable to Christianity or Islam.8 It is to these
two latter monotheistic faiths, however, that much attention is given as both
are profoundly oriented toward a communal character and their corporate
conceptions continually militating against the secular accentuated no less
by their strong focus on the strategy of nation-building as the only true and
real form of kinship, akin to ethnic nationalism in relation to the clan system.
Fukuyama, by focusing on Islam, for example, makes it clear that religion
should be taken seriously as a potential pathway not just to override lesser
loyalties, a perennial stumbling block to state-building, but harmonize the
three corner struggle between central authority, the elites and the masses.
Empires, he says, are more lasting when bearers of a salvationist creed. But
even these cannot resist disunity and disputed successions, as illustrated
by the Sunni-Shia split which resulted in lesser loyalties, such as the tribe,
to reassert themselves.

\[72\] The Last Refuge: Part 2

In the very visibility of ecclesiastical dominance, some might see both
Christianity and Islam, as too corporate, too communal, too repressive
of individual faith and reason.9 Such disconsolate elements in these rec-
ognized types of theocracy discredit the theocratic order (God governs
His people through a revealed Book and through legal institutions divinely
ordained and granting infallibility, viz. the Guardianship and the Universal
House of Justice, in the Bahá’í movement) but it is to degree we must turn.
The real safeguard lies in that the relationship between the Creator and
his subject is direct and unique and does not require the intercession of
a salvational institution. In this profound sense, the Bahá’í Faith can never
be seen to be repressive to individual faith or to be too corporate. Such
guarantee of the freedom and inviolability of an individual’s personal con-
victions reflects ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s call that conscience is ‘one of the private
possessions of the heart and the soul’ and that cannot be surrendered to
any institution, whether spiritual or secular.10 “From two ranks among men
power hath been seized: kings and ecclesiastics.”11 The abolition of priest-
hood removes both the corporate hold on the day-to-day affairs of the
community and, more importantly, the imminent risk of tearing the Faith
to pieces ‘by the conflicting opinions of scholars applying limited human
reasoning to divinely revealed truths.’

In addition to India and Christian Europe, Islamic Middle East is the other
world civilization in which a rule of law came into being, rooted and deeply
scriptural and codified from a very early point, not unlike Judaism; it is
divine in origin, exercising universal jurisdiction and the source of all truth
and justice. (In the case of Islam, those rules are not just the Holy Koran
but also the corpus of sunna and the hadith). The interpretation of these
rules is in many cases uncertain and has to be delegated to a special class
of priests — clergy of the Church or the ulama, or scholars. In both cases,
law comes not from political power but from God, who has dominion over
political authorities. Muhammad (570 a.C — 632 a.C) may have been a tribal
ruler in his lifetime but his command did not rest on political leadership so
much as in his role as the transmitter of the word of God. Bahá’ís do not

consider the Papacy or the Caliphate as divinely given systems of theocracy
but that, although man-made, are ‘partly derived from the teachings of
Christ and Muhammad.’ “The Bahá’í theocracy, on the contrary, is both
divinely ordained as a system and, of course, based on the teachings of the
Prophet Himself.”12

Political and religious authority were frequently united in Christian Europe
and in the Muslim world.13 There is no doubt, however, that law based on
religion has created the foundation for the modern rule of law and which
existed in medieval Europe, the Middle East, and India well before any of
these regions made a transition to modernity. Rulers in all of these societies
acknowledged that they had lived under a law that they themselves did
not create. The existence of a separate religious authority accustomed
rulers to the claim that they were not the ultimate source of the law and
success of resistance to these claims reasserted the primacy of law in the
eyes of the public, over and above legislation. The divine word itself was
law. Such resistance is made easier when a religious tradition gave law a
sanctity, autonomy, and coherence that it otherwise might not have. We
are using the term law in its widest meaning, as “an embodiment of a broad
social consensus regarding rules of justice.”14 This turns law to be prior to
legislation and, in various ages social consensus was expressed religiously
because religion played a greater role in people’s daily lives, especially
critical when the attitude is taken to connect politics, the activity behind
social consensus, to the human good — not only thinking together but also
a working together. But the communal, corporate, social and aesthetic
qualities of religion most under attack with the rise of modernity three
centuries before resurged, paradoxically, as celebrated themes to be
studied in the nineteenth century.

We began this section with two famous thinkers of the nineteenth century
not by coincidence but because of an irony ‘and fertile instruction in
the fact that this century — coming as it does hard on the heels of the
Protestant Reformation, the Age of Reason, the Enlightenment, and the

\[74\] The Last Refuge: Part 2

Revolution — should be one of the richest of all centuries in philosophical
and literary expressions of religious community.’15 The irony is clear. For
centuries, the tendencies of Western thought has been in the direction
of secularization, rationalization, ‘dechristianization decrees’, positivism,
democracy, and technology. Religion was contending for a final blow but
despite such confidence in high-minded wordly wisdom, evidence of
religious revival in the nineteenth century can be seen in many areas: phi-
losophy, sociology, literature, and theology.16 Nisbet observes that in this
period we are confronted with a diffusion of more sects and faiths within
Christianity than perhaps in any other, certainly after the Reformation. Such
a veritable ‘tidal wave of religious enthusiasm’ was not shared by all. Some
of the greatest and most influential remained as impervious as had any
philosophe in the century before: Jeremy Bentham, Karl Marx, Nietzche
and many other intellectual children of the Age of Reason. One Danish and
Protestant colleague, however, did not share their indifference or arrogant
derision (Marx referring to religion as ‘the opium of the people’ is a case
in point)17 and an agonizing state of personal crisis springing from his sense
of aloneness in the spiritual universe produced a powerful presentation
of the authority of the community of God. In his passionate Christian
Discourses (1848) Kierkegaard declares that religion alone can provide the
supporting pillars necessary for reasserting, at one and the same time, indi-
viduality and community. Interestingly, the terminology of community is not
found in Kierkegaard’s writings, neither is there any abundant reference
to community of any kind but his thought is relevant in that it emphasizes
the vital authoritarianism of religion and the presence of authority may be
considered one of the oldest and most visible manifestations of community.
There can be no community, he seems to say, without an internal authority
that binds the individual to itself and that provides him sanctuary from
the alienation and atomization of an age of crisis. But communities do not
naturally coalesce in some organic, non-negotiated way from their constit-
uent individuals or lesser communities. Different individuals and groups
have interest that may not always harmonize peaceably with those of
others. It must be recognized that no community can hold together without

the virtue of justice, the virtue that gives to others what is rightfully their
own. Aristotle, in his Politics, refers to justice as ‘the bond of men in states’
and the administration of justice the principle of order and foundation of
political society. The justice of the ruler or the law is to respect and to foster
the good of this public thing: the common good. And the common good at
which the laws of the political community should aim is the good regulated
according to divine justice. It is this meaning of the term justice that is
invested in the designation of the central governing body of the Order of
Bahá’u’lláh: “Among the powers and duties with which the Universal House
of Justice has been invested are… to foster that which is conducive to the
enlightenment and illumination of the souls of men and the advancement
and betterment of the world.”18 Membership in the political community will
naturally contribute to the individual’s good. Alternatively, laws may make
one a good citizen but not a good human being.

Political philosophy in the context of a religious community, the extension
of governance of humankind with its implicit tension between regnum (the
sphere of worldly administration) and sacerdotium (in its widest form as
representing the entire religious order), the influence of institutions, and
how certain features of Bahá’í teachings and Bahá’í administrative structure
envisaged provide the flexibility and assurance to these concerns within the
context of realism are all issues underlying religion in its relation to society,
and, more specifically, in relation to a wider, World Order. The idea of
global governance, in particular, is the prevailing orthodoxy and is becoming
increasingly the basis of government decisions, bilateral agreements, and
international treaties (viz. the Kyoto protocols or the treaty establishing the
International Criminal Court). If political communities (sovereign states) now
have a political superior (global political community) should religion too not
have a global appeal and a global reach? Given that religion is indispensable
to society as a mechanism of stability, as an integrating force, and as a body
of symbols of allegiance to the social bond, to echo Chateaubriand — are
there areas where religion does not, should not, intervene?

\[76\] The Last Refuge: Part 2

As religion begins to renew itself under the banner of Bahá’u’lláh, we see
that the ecumenical idea in history has been realized. Saint Augustine,
the first Western philosopher to conceive mankind as a single, unified
entity, possessing a history of its own, envisaged a total, unified, organis-
mic mankind with the various peoples — Hebrews, Greeks, Romans and
others in his day — as manifestations of ‘stages’ of development in the life
of mankind. The following brief passage from his City of God is perhaps the
most quoted in Western writing on the philosophy of history:

“The education of the human race, represented by the people of God, has

> advanced, like that of an individual, through certain epochs, or, as it were,
> ages, so that it might gradually rise from earthly to heavenly things, and
> from the visible to the invisible.”19

Bahá’ís readily relate to this idea of stages in mankind’s collective growth
and believe that the coming of age of the entire human race is a signal of
the organic and spiritual unity of the whole body of nations envisaged by
Bahá’u’lláh. This is to be viewed “…as marking the last and highest stage
in the stupendous evolution of man’s collective life on this planet. The
emergence of a world community, the consciousness of world citizenship,
the founding of a world civilization and culture …should…be regarded…, as
the furthermost limits in the organization of human society…”20 In this sense,
religion becomes indivisible from other types of authority and the fact
that there is no functional separation of religious and secular authority in
Bahá’u’lláh’s World Order and, consequently, no two parallel judicial estab-
lishments may come to exist, this makes the Universal House of Justice ‘the
supreme organ of the Bahá’í Commonwealth’ to exercise ‘all the rights, the
duties and responsibilities incumbent upon the world’s future superstate.’
The principle of unity in diversity, however, acting as pivot in world govern-
ment will devolve upon national and local bodies much responsibility, but
not with the unrestricted sovereignty which nation-states enjoy today.21

And the mission of Bahá’í institutions “does not comprise a series of specific

> population who accept a common organ of government’ — is its high degree

of compulsiveness and the motive behind why the modalities of power
have shifted so often to the other end of the power spectrum —coercion.
As a corollary, stable and effective exercise of government depends on
that which is derived from authority. As guidance of Bahá’í institutions is
seen as proceeding from persons who — no matter whether it is logical or
reasonable or justifiable by any objective criterion — are believed to be
persons with a moral right to issue it, then, for those to whom guidance is
given, there emerges a moral duty to obey it.29 This is the secret of Bahá’í
administration. The ‘esteem’ and ‘real affection’ which believers attach to
their legally elected representatives is the sentiment which holds together
the framework of this vast Administrative Order and itself the fruit of a
universal consciousness “…that the keynote of the Cause of God is not dic-
tatorial authority but humble fellowship, not arbitrary power, but the spirit
of frank and loving consultation. Nothing short of the spirit of a true Bahá’í
can hope to reconcile the principles of mercy and justice, of freedom and
submission, of the sanctity of the right of the individual and of self-surren-
der, of vigilance, discretion and prudence on the one hand, and fellowship,
candor, and courage on the other.”30

Authority in the Bahá’í Faith has a reservoir of public support which is in-
exhaustible. This is understandable predicated as it is upon what has been
termed the miranda and the credenda of power: the things that arouse
favorable emotional responses (‘miranda’ or things to be admired) and the
rationalizations that contain the reasons which oblige the intellect to give
assent (‘credenda’ or things to be believed).31 The human forces of admi-
ration and personal belief in the Bahá’í community act as lubricants in the
mechanics of administration and act as true antidotes to the ‘arid secu-
larization’ which may infect it if ‘divorced from the animating spirit of the
Cause.’ There are many aspects in Bahá’í institutional life that provide vivid
examples of this sway between the two alternating states of awareness —
the emotional appeal and the rational and legitimate features of an order
which allow a systematic explanation of why people should obey and give
assent to the continuance of authority. Here we shall mention two of the

\[80\] The Last Refuge: Part 2

most compelling: (1) the procedure of voting and the election process and;
(2) the conferred infallibility of the Universal House of Justice.32

Because of the absence of clergy in the Bahá’í Faith, Bahá’í communities are
governed by regularly elected representative institutions at local, regional
(in some areas), national, and international levels. For many students of
politics, the most surprising feature of Bahá’í elections is that they are
conducted without nominations, competitive campaigns, voting coalitions,
or parties. Bahá’í elections are governed by formal institutional rules and
informal norms that specifically prohibit such familiar features of the political
landscape. The question is why Bahá’í elections are governed by these rules
and norms. The answer lies in the distinctive values that are the foundation
for the rules and norms. Bahá’í Administration “…is the ideal instrument to
make spiritual laws function properly in the material affairs of this world”33.
This acknowledges the fact that the key to prosperity and stability is sound
government but that beyond the hidden institutional foundations of rights,
rule of law, and basic political order, a purified spirit must exist. Given that
the Spiritual Assembly is a ‘gift of God’34 within each community and the
Bahá’í community continually expands, administrators and decision-makers
are challenged to stretch mind and spirit to encompass new and evolving
requirements. This makes it absolutely necessary that ‘every one should
conscientiously take an active part in the election of these Assemblies’, and
makes of voting both a responsibility and an opportunity. This refers not
just to participating actively in Bahá’í elections but in elections as a whole
as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was wont to encourage: “…it is necessary that the citizens
shall take part in elections. This is a necessary matter and no excuse from it
is possible. My object in telling the believers that they should not interfere
in the affairs of government is this: that they should not make any trouble
and that they should not move against the opinion of the government, but
obedience to the laws…is necessary.”35 Bahá’ís are not invited to participate
in party politics but are exhorted to obey government and are strictly to
abstain “…from associating themselves, whether by word or deed, with
the political pursuits of their respective nations, with the policies of their

> governments and the schemes and programmes of parties and factions…”36
> Such platforms are divisive, corrupt, and inflaming — of little appeal to
> a new race of man convinced that conflicts are solved only by peaceful
> means (“Without such unity, rest and comfort, peace and universal recon-
> ciliation are unachievable”37). It can be argued that political parties have
> only developed in Western democracy because of an absence of social
> solidarity. Their absence is a boon for a serving community with no partisan
> weighting in the distribution of this service. Voting becomes an important
> part of Bahá’í community life and the adult Bahá’í must see himself as an
‘intelligent, well-informed and responsible elector’ because institutions

> matter, long recognized as such by economists and political scientists alike.
> For example, poor countries are poor not because they lack resources, but
> because they lack effective political institutions.38 Bahá’í Administrative
> Order, through its unifying and harmonizing functions, has been estab-
> lished precisely to make firm and strong “…the foundation of fairness and
> justice…that all regions of the world may become even as Paradise itself.”39
With this exhortation of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in mind, participating in building insti-

> tutional capacity through the very first formal acts of voting and elections,
> really becomes a spiritual privilege, much more significant than simply
> exercising civic pride, especially when knowing that “institutions invested

> ensuring its unfoldment along avenues productive and meritorious.”40 The
> conduct of Bahá’í elections, when properly studied and applied, portrays
> an aspect of an organic unity of the spiritual and the material necessary to
> the construction of a mature society in this new Age. “In no other system do
> individuals exercise such a breadth of freedom in the electoral process.”41

When politics no longer serves special interest groups, the nature of
political decision making must also be different. When power is needed to
order human affairs but the struggle for power threatens to destroy society,
a new process must exist to resolve this paradox. A searching modus
operandi which successfully addresses both dilemmas is Bahá’í consulta-
tion. In Bahá’í consultation we find a new method for searching out truth

“Virtually every problem which is blamed on a deficiency of structure is, in

> fact, traceable to a defect in the manner in which the individual believers

Notwithstanding its infallibility44 and the nature of its authority, the
Universal House of Justice neither eschews the principle of consultation
nor dismisses the inquiries of the believers with impatience or indifference
or permits a climate of intolerance. In the process of consultation the House
of Justice wants to be provided with facts when called upon to render a

decision and it may well change its decision when new facts emerge. “[The]
Universal House of Justice is not omniscient.”45 As to its compassion and
forbearance in attending the infinite petition or queries of the believers,
this letter gives a sample: “The friends should learn to radiantly accept such
decisions and if, as a result, at any given time a certain point of guidance is
unclear, they assuredly have the right to seek clarification or verification.”46
In the very early days of its existence, the newly established House, was in
constant consultation with the Hands of the Cause in the Holy Land and
from the tone of their earliest communication, a marked cordiality charac-
terized these meetings.

[Ministry of the Custodians, Page 428]

Consultation of the infallible Body with specialists, with the high and low,
continues to this day, even as it never ceases to explain and elucidate ‘all
important fundamental questions’. Set against this background, the absence
of an aura of omniscience is not only a reassuring and wonderful contrast
but a true reflection of the principle of balance and moderation evidenced
in the Faith of God. Somewhere between the two terms of justice and
mercy there are links uniting the two. The Universal House of Justice may
well be its official designation but mercy gives it its fullness. Mercy is not a
relaxation of justice but its exaltation. Its opposite is also true, restating C.S.
Lewis that ‘mercy, detached from justice, grows unmerciful.’

The World Order of Bahá’u’llah, of which the Administrative Order is its
‘nucleus’ and ‘pattern’, allows itself to adapt to changing conditions in the

world through the unfamiliar dichotomy of ‘immutability’ and ‘elasticity’
— the unity of doctrine and the unity of administration, respectively. Two

‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi, together with absolute prohibition against

> ministers. The first preserves the identity of His faith, and guards the integrity
> of His law. The second enables it, even as a living organism, to expand and
> adapt itself to the needs and requirements of an ever-changing society.”51

The conviction that Bahá’í institutions are important rests on the fact that in
their absence, spirit will dissipate: form must exist for spirit to continue to
operate. On the global level, the agency of the Universal House of Justice
has been ordained “… to ensure the continuity of that divinely-appointed
authority which flows from the Source of the Faith, to safeguard the unity
of its followers, and to maintain the integrity and flexibility of its teachings.”

This is encouraging as it offers the expectation that Bahá’í administrative

processes and structure will continue to evolve in response to exigencies.

All these institutions on all levels (international, national and local), ‘auxiliary
branches’ and ‘subordinate agencies’,53 these should not be misconstrued as
a division of social or political power or examples akin to distinct separate
branches or offices of state or government as implied by the constitution-
al theory of checks and balances. The traditional theory of checks and
balances spells out the idea that by distributing political functions among
different institutions of society and government freedom and justice are
preserved and no one person or group can hold all power. Power in the
Bahá’í community, as we have seen earlier (page 47), has an altogether
different meaning. So too with the concept of checks and balances which,
unlike the traditional sense of separating and spreading out power within
the state to promote justice, and this includes centralized versus decentral-
ized government, in the Bahá’í Faith the term checks and balances refers to
an altogether different dimension, namely that well balanced souls are as
important to freedom as a well-balanced constitution. This is the message

\[86\] The Last Refuge: Part 2

which comes out strongly when the phrase is used by the House of Justice
in its message to the US Bahá’í community in December 29th, 1988: “Thus
there exist in the system of Bahá’u’lláh checks and balances necessary to
the beneficial uses of this freedom in the onward development of society.”
[Individual Rights & Freedoms, paragraph 27]. A utilitarian and perfectionist
view, as it were, may now be appended to the traditional political question
of separation of powers. Social stability is not just a ‘mixed’ government but
also individuals that are spiritually balanced. Religion alone can play the role
of regulator between man the angel and man the beast — two distinct hu-
manities that any government must rule. In a democratic society, to counter
the materialistic tendencies natural to man, as much depends to be done
on behalf of the angel. Religion balances the imperatives and inclinations of
human nature and offers an alternative ideal to democratic society, the ideal
of human perfection (e.g. the love of God), a good in itself regardless of its
utility. “Love and harmony, purity of motive, humility and lowliness amongst
the friends, patience and long-suffering in difficulties — these inform the
attitude with which they proceed “with the utmost devotion, courtesy,
dignity, care and moderation to express their views…” [Individual Rights &
Freedoms, paragraph 28]. That very keen observer of the democratic soul,
himself living in the early years of the Bahá’í Era, Tocqueville, seeking to
protect democracy from its individualism and pettiness, was inspired to call
on religion for that check and balance which self-interest is powerless to
achieve: “The greatest advantage of religions is to inspire entirely opposite
instincts. There is no religion that does not place the object of the desires
of men above and beyond the good things of the earth, and that does
not naturally elevate his soul toward realms very superior to those of the
senses. Nor is there any religion that does not impose on each man some
duties toward the human species or in common with it, and that does not
in this way drag him, from time to time, out of contemplation of himself.”54

13\. It is of a remarkable coincidence that, although separated by six centuries, Christianity

> and Islam divide a common geology of culture: their founding berths in Palestine (modern
> Israel), and in the Arabian Peninsula, respectively, conjoin in the same region and their
> Prophet-Founders, Jesus of Nazareth (although born in Bethlehem) and Muhammad,
> born in Mecca, are Semite, (one Galilean and the other Arab), having had their beginnings
> through the prophet Abraham. In terms of eschatology, both give hope of a spiritual
> awakening: the Second Coming of Jesus and the coming of the Qa’im (the One who
> Arises) as expected by Shi’I Muslims, or the Mahdi (the Guided One) as expected by
> Sunni Muslims. The expectation of the coming of a new prophet, of course, also exists in
> Zoroastrianism and Buddhism, the former naming the figure as the Shah Bahram who will
> found a true universal religion which will unite mankind and Buddha proclaiming: “In due
> time another Buddha will arise in the world, a Holy One, a supremely enlightened one…a
> master of angels and mortals.” Quoted in John Huddleston, The Search for a Just Society,
> Oxford, George Ronald, 1989, p. 27. Interestingly, Hadith reference both the Mahdi and
> Isa (the Arabic name for Jesus Christ) simultaneously and the return of the Mahdi will
> coincide with the return of Christ both figures being ultimately inseparable according to

— Christianity facing hostility in secularism and subjectivism, the two epithets of the

16\. To Bahá’ís, such recrudescence in religious community and thought, can only coincide

with the birth of the Babi and Bahá’í religions in the first half of the nineteenth century.
“What is the cause of this sudden awakening throughout the world? Bahá’ís believe that it

Conclusion
“There has rarely been a crisis in which Hope and Peril have presented

themselves so vividly and so simultaneously upon the world scene.”1
These words ring bitingly true today where hope, as represented in the

> aborning era of a ‘modern’ Bahá’í World Community2, stands beside peril,
> that seething magma of ‘liquid modernity’3; where “pervading cynicism,
> emptiness, and negativity…subtly color our thoughts”4; where “consumer-
> ism acts to maintain the emotional reversal of work and family”5; where
> religion is feared as a “mental delusion [and] a great moral evil” (a partic-
> ularly astonishing declaration coming so early from an ex-Church Minister
> living in Georgean England)6; where political consciousness is no longer a
> synonym of civic virtue but symbolized by outrageous partisanship, where
> voter abstention (barely half of the US voting population has turned out
> to vote since 1996)7 is symptomatic of apathy fed by corruption and, even,
> mockery of the high position and sanctity of public office;8 where public
> street protests against both government and the financial establishment
> were front-page news in 2011, — the Movimento 15-M in Madrid, then with
> Occupy Wall Street in New York, along with Occupy Boston, Occupy Los
> Angeles, Occupy London, Occupy Melbourne, Occupy Rome and other
> variants; where religion is viewed “not just amoral, but positively immoral”9;
> where political debates have become the ultimate fighting championships
> of verbal combat with the sole objective of attacking faulty reason10 rather

than discovering truth (John S. Mill‘s famous ‘negative logic’); and still other
manifestations of leadership’s bloated and marred supremacy. But just
as hope cannot be prognostication nor should peril be regarded as con-
demnation. Extremes of Winston Churchill’s spectrum highlighted at the
beginning of this final section help form what the late John Rawls called
an “overlapping consensus” in which different groups of citizens accept the
same conclusions from either side and with quite different arguments.

Given the exigency of the times, to which some refer as misfortune in that
we are uncertain and without a compass, these diverse camps with their
different political hues are compelled to reconsider man’s progressive
movement, now divided and directionless and met with growing indiffer-
ence. This is the danger and contradiction of our age: it has been precisely
in the Bahá’í Era, that is during the last one hundred and seventy years,
where unprecedented democratization of political life and a tremendous
amount of political activity is everywhere apparent. But participation in
public affairs is regarded with indifference by a vast majority of the public.
The danger lies in that citizenship, so vital for social movement and for com-
pulsion to emerge, is weakened as a result. “The average citizen seems to
find the exercise of political rights burdensome, boring, and often lacking in
significance. To be a citizen does not appear an important role, nor political
participation an intrinsic good.”11 The Bahá’í Faith calls for a revival, not just
of citizenship, but of world citizenship, ‘a consciousness that can alone
provide an adequate basis for the organization of world unity.’ To bring this
to fruition, a system must exist to interact with the spiritual evolution of in-
dividuals, in accordance with spiritual principles and needs and, consonant
with the spirit of the age, a ‘planetized world’, to win the hearts and to
gain the world.12 Is such a charter comprehensive enough to confer all the
advantages of civilization, without inhibition or shrill or the leaden weight of
fideism? Or are these the ideals of a mythical sage-king?13 We leave these
questions for the reader to decide.

\[98\] The Last Refuge: Part 2

We discussed liberty and found the need for it to triumph but not at
the cost of individual independence or more atomized, private citizenry.
Excessive individualism in the end advocates serfdom. True freedom is a
freedom that limits itself and yet does not lose its hold on the universal as
embodied in the principles and laws of a divinely ordained central authority.
To lose hold of the universal is to cease to place checks upon our collective
appetite so necessary for the survival of true liberty. Combined hedonism
and egalitarianism has a destructive impact on the power of hierarchy
that is native and vital to the social bond. Moreover, to say that liberty
is individuality made normative ignores the fact that we are consciously
and unconsciously, wittingly or otherwise, always enlisted into situations
not of our own choice.14 We are also dependent on the effort of others to
bring us to the point of understanding the choices we are to make. The
core of individual liberty depends on the support of others. The nature of
society is such that we, dissenters or not, are compelled to contribute, to
participate, to accept perfectly reasonable goals. But as compelled as we
are to submit to impositions, these must not be unjust. The Universal House
of Justice exists to help us to emerge as free and rational persons in com-
munities protected by the religion of God and His divine law. The fact that
we are never born fully equipped to think and judge for ourselves, however,
does not mean that our relationship with the Centre of our Faith should
be characterized by total dependency or that that our intellectual space is
occupied circumscriptive. An important area of the application of laws has
been intentionally left to the conscience of each individual believer.15 We
are told that “[r]eligion… showereth imperishable benefits upon mankind.”16
The Universal House of Justice exists to safeguard this covenant. Might
not this suggest, then, that our rights are also predefined and therefore to
speak of them makes no sense? Does such institutional omnipresence in
the Bahá’í Faith make liberty insecure? Such a line of argument is clearly
flawed as our right to freedom of mind has been extolled in the Holy
Writings and can never be, therefore, the creature of central authority in
the formal institutional sense although as spiritual beings we can never flee
from dependency and from that infinite conductor, our conscience. We

also showed that society cannot prosper without stable institutions to elicit
the thought and efforts of its members and none of this is possible without
a community of trust and mutual respect. To accept authority as an enabler
rather than a hindrance, people must trust each other and trust requires
and engenders respect.

This study is irremediably incomplete: the range of fact is great, the fact
itself is almost an unspeakable — what is at issue is something which cannot
be put into words but which makes itself manifest, that moving nucleus
between a living relation of heaven above and earth below. And the changes
are too rapid, none the least being one’s own self altering in the interim.
Other studies on several omitted aspects must inevitably arise. But might
not further speculation on any future development of the institutions of
the Faith itself be counterproductive, a “...speculation which can only give
rise to those very differences of interpretation forbidden by Bahá’u’lláh
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and against which they repeatedly warned us”?17 An ad-
vertence, it seems, that we cannot be artists of conjecture while professing
to be servants of truth. (The Universal House of Justice gives us a profound
yet brief guidance on this matter and which we copy in full in the Appendix
to deepen our understanding further).

Unquestionably these last fifty years have been significant ones, anni
mirabili, a “… notable, perhaps heroic time for the Faith”18 and ‘in the erection
of the last unit crowning the structure of the embryonic World Order of
Baha’u’llah’ (the Universal House of Justice). While this episode may be
considered as fundamentally the most important part of our recent history,
it is but one stream in the auspicious Bahá’í work for the reconstruction
of human society in a world grown old and weary. (“Mundus senscit”—the
world grows old—was the phrase employed by Gregory of Tours in the 6th
century to describe the twilight of the Roman Empire). Concurrent with
this must surely be the streams of “the contribution to human advance-
ment…made by individual Bahá’ís in the pursuit of their daily work” and
the many “projects and institutions for human advancement launched and

\[100\] The Last Refuge: Part 2

> operated by Bahá’í Spiritual Assemblies as their resources grow and the
> range of their activities expands.”19 But it has been the destiny of these
> early epochs of the Formative Age to blazon the birth and functioning of the
> twin institutions of the Bahá’í Faith — the Guardianship and the Universal
> House of Justice. They must be catalogued and rewritten extensively,20 for
> the ‘psychic curvature’ is getting stronger by the day with attention, both
> within the Bahá’í community and outside of it, concentrating on the World
> Centre as never before — after all, the axis of mankind’s advancement is
> the Cause of God and the axis of the Cause of God is protected by the
> Universal House of Justice, “…the sole infallibly guided institution in the
> world to which all must turn…”.21 Only when we have the book can we un-
> derstand the story.22 One draft must succeed another to accompany these
> changes as “…all experience is an arch wherethro’/Gleams that untravell’d
> world, whose margin fades/For ever and for ever when I move.23 Nor should
> this survey should not be seen as poetic lore, with jotted conversations
“overheard in the dusk, from speakers far or hid, of which we get only a few

broken murmurs”.

It is an earnest appeal against the dour prognostications of civilizational
decay made by Spengler, Toynbee, and Voegelin which increasingly find
a large and eager audience. The vaunted idea of progress transforms
itself into heresy when matched with man’s innate capacity for pessimism.
Human loyalties uprooted from accustomed soil must now find a larger
purpose to fix them. The dusk of nations is dissipated by this renewed call
to the nations. “It is towards this goal —the goal of a new World Order,
Divine in origin, all-embracing in scope, equitable in principle, challenging
in its features —that a harassed humanity must strive.”24

vested in garments of light, leaving behind a life having forsaken their own,
relived in the ‘eternal city’25, a ‘legendary world framed within its own
conventions in which the characters, suffused with unnatural brightness,
perform with terrific responsiveness.’ The entire membership of the House

arose to escort them down the Concourse and to the ground floor of the
Seat, the moving spectacle of a new regiment exchanging duty with the old.
Nearer to the Eastern side-entrance of the building a large collection of
staff, foot guards, were waiting, chanting a parting refrain of Alláh’u’Abhá.
Here, stepping into the waiting car, ended two score years of unique
service at the Bahá’í World Centre, overbearing in its majesty, overwhelm-
ing in its demand of work, overburdened in daily supervisory functions, and
overarching in the manifold tasks that Divine Providence has vouchsafed to
this, the world’s crowning institution. On this last day, we see emotions of
a matchless moment where a company of equals bid adieu —a memorable
picture, to be sure, of plain humanity amongst the trappings of divinity. In
this final exchange there is no agony, just a poignant recognition of master
time marshalling the lives of nine honorable men, ‘the men of the House
of Justice’26 trustees of a timeless and peerless institution, founded “...to
ensure the continuity of that divinely —appointed authority which flows…”27

Many, like my parents, have proven to be archetypes which aid us in the
discovery of perpetual meaning in the lives and events surrounding the
early epochs of the Formative Age28 and give us a vivid interpretation
not just of service but of a special attitude to service which places faith
in authority before, but never excluding, rational understanding.29 Such
an unusual cognitive function cannot be pinned to spots on the brain like
towns on a map but involve a complicated web of circuits which interact
with the world not like fixed parts in a machine but like the instruments
in a symphony orchestra combining their tenor, volume, and resonance to
create a particular musical effect.

Father, by virtue of his unique position, completed a form of understanding
which we are to emulate, namely, to unite the reflective attitude with very
practical concerns — the former aiming to understand the significance of
service and the latter to form a reasonable conception of it. It is only with
this wisdom that we are able to see how a nascent institution, “a House
which posterity will regard as the last refuge of a tottering civilization”,30

\[102\] The Last Refuge: Part 2

successfully channels the vitality of the two agents at work — the divine and
the human. And for the human to work, one prized quality stands above the
rest, a duty placed on those who follow, a word ‘whispered privily’ in the
argot of the new man: ‘By the Lord! I found not from these idle claimants
the breeze of Faithfulness!’31

Letter of the House of Justice
Discussion of the Bahá’í Concept of Infallibility
Extract from a Letter Written on Behalf of the Universal House of Justice

In general, the House of Justice wishes to preserve the widest possible
latitude for the friends to explore the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh and to
share their individual understanding of the Teachings. Yet it must be
remembered that, with regard to deductions drawn from the Texts, the
Master clearly states:

> …the deductions and conclusions of individual learned men have no
> authority, unless they are endorsed by the House of Justice. The dif-
> ference is precisely this, that from the conclusions and endorsements
> of the body of the House of Justice whose members are elected by
> and known to the worldwide Bahá’í community, no differences will
> arise; whereas the conclusions of individual divines and scholars
would definitely lead to differences, and result in schism, division, and

dispersion. The oneness of the Word would be destroyed, the unity
> of the Faith would disappear, and the edifice of the Faith of God
> would be shaken.

The Universal House of Justice does not intend at this time to elaborate
further on previous explanations given of its duties and powers. That the
House of Justice itself does not find it necessary to do so should alert the
friends as to the unwisdom of their attempting to define so precisely its
sphere of action. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that, while there
are explicit passages in the authoritative texts that make reference to the
infallibility of the House of Justice in the enactment of legislation, the
argument that it is free from error only in this respect is untenable. Surely,
the many emphatic statements found in the Writings, such as the following
excerpt from the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, should suffice to
dismiss any claims of this kind:

> The sacred and youthful branch, the guardian of the Cause of God
> as well as the Universal House of Justice, to be universally elected
> and established, are both under the care and protection of the Abhá
> Beauty, under the shelter and unerring guidance of His Holiness, the
> Exalted One (may my life be offered up for them both). Whatsoever
> they decide is of God. Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth them,
> hath not obeyed God; whoso rebelleth against him and against them
> hath rebelled against God; whoso opposeth him hath opposed God;
> whoso contendeth with them hath contended with God….

Apart from the question of infallibility, there is the matter of authority. A letter
written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi states: “It is not for individual believers
to limit the sphere of the Guardian’s authority, or to judge when they have to
obey the Guardian and when they are free to reject his judgement. Such an
attitude would evidently lead to confusion and to schism.” In regard to the
Universal House of Justice, the same understanding applies.

Infallibility is a profound spiritual concept inherent in the Bahá’í Writings.
In meditating upon the relevant passages, the believers will naturally reach
their own understanding of the subject. Individual opinions, however,

\[112\] The Last Refuge: Part 5

should not be imposed on others, nor so promoted as to crystallize into
doctrines not found in the explicit Text. When exchanging views about

the Universal House of Justice—the body to which all things must be
referred—the friends should exercise care lest they go to extremes, by
either diminishing its station or assigning to it

exaggerated attributes. What better admonition to heed in a matter of this
nature than that given by the beloved Master, when some believers fell into
disagreement about His own station:

> These discussions will yield no result or benefit: we must set all such
> debates and controversies entirely aside—nay, we must consign
> them to oblivion and arise to accomplish that which is enjoined and
> required in this Day. These debates are mere words bereft of inner
> meaning; they are mere illusions and not reality.

> That which is true and real is this: that we become united and agreed
> in our purpose and arise to flood this darksome world with light, to
> banish enmity and foreignness from among the children of men, to
> perfume and revive the world

with the sanctified breezes of the character and conduct of the Abhá Beauty,
to cast the light of divine guidance upon East and West, to raise the taber-
nacle of the love of God and gather all people under its sheltering shadow,
to confer peace and composure upon every soul beneath the shade of the
blessed Tree, to show forth such love as to astonish the enemy, to turn
ravenous and bloodthirsty wolves into the gazelles of the meadows of the
love of God, to cause the oppressor to taste the sweet savour of meekness,
to teach them that kill the submission and acquiescence of those that suffer
themselves to be killed, to spread abroad the verses of the one true God,
to extol the virtues and perfections of the all-glorious Lord, to raise to the

highest heaven the cry of “O Thou the Glory of Glories!”, and to cause the
call of “The earth will shine with the light of her Lord!”1 to reach the ears of
the denizens of His Kingdom.

The House of Justice appeals to the friends not to become embroiled in the
kind of fruitless theological discussions that caused conflict and contention
in past dispensations, lest they lose sight of their responsibility to promul-
gate the oneness of humanity and of the role of the Covenant established
by Bahá’u’lláh in uniting minds, hearts, and souls.

Acknowledgements
This modest work has been judged by a perfect jury. In the several intervals
of revision and improvements, the learned heads of my anonymous
reviewers never shied away from admonishing a writing style which did not
go in the way it should for what it is, to whom it is intended and how the
content is meant to be used. The difficult co-existence of not entirely ef-
fortless concepts in an unspeakable setting lends to a narrative with neither
species nor genus. In the hands of a novice this can easily lead to destruc-
tion. Given that only the skilled can judge skillfulness, the reviewers took to
this vital care freely and lovingly, and always allowed me safe retreat. More
importantly they showed me that in the republic of letters there is no king
or pope but sound argument and good reason and, more importantly, given
the nature of the central theme, right words carefully chosen to convey to
the reader that obedience to conscience is as important as the argument
itself and this can only be achieved if we endeavor to follow such lights as
our spiritual forebears have lit us.

This has been a most valuable experience because it has been a spiritual
journey led by many luminaries. These wonderful figures taught me that
it is not enough to know but to preserve and edify knowledge in form, in
systematic research and writing. Over the two and a half years of the life of
this jubilee project, my masters were never far from this peccant and errant

breed of a writer. Lost deadlines or abstruse composition were never met
by indignation, a non-existent trait in these living portrayals of selflessness
and who have proven to be the perfect thesis advisers – longsuffering, sin
covering, and never over-tasked. My debt to these notables is immense.

The title of this paper was given to me by my late father, Mr. Hushmand
Fatheazam, and to whom this work is dedicated. Still on the title page, I
am grateful to my brother Shahab who suggested an additional qualifying
inscription which goes a long way to emphasize the point that the text is
a personal responsibility with insights that are not rules nor should these
ever be imposed as necessarily true but at best be considered helpful or
enlightening. I wish to thank Mr. Nicholas Semple for his gracious permis-
sion, on behalf of his family, to allow me access to his dear father’s personal
diary and from which several segments have been incorporated from those
priceless impressions of the early days of the House of Justice, of which Mr.
Ian Semple was its longest serving member. Throughout this writing there
has been a special one who has always guided me away from disorder - my
cherished wife Neda whose rules made perfect ease and freedom possible
to pursue the project to the end. And to you, dearest mother, who never
feared disorder to begin with for the apostle in you sees beauty and en-
chantment in everything, everywhere, even in the direst circumstances,
even now with your world fallen.
