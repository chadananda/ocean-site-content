Diary of a Cross-country Auto Trip

to and back from
the 1942 Bahá!í National Convention

by

Margaret Marie Rutledge

Foreword

Margaret Marie Rutledge (later Cavanaugh) was born in San
Francisco, California in 1914, and passed away in Monterey, California in
1996\. She grew up in Stockton, in California!s Central Valley, and in
Berkeley, in the San Francisco Bay Area, and remained in the Bay Area,
serving for decades on the Spiritual Assembly of Alameda. She was the
older sister of Barbara Rutledge Sims, a long-term pioneer to Japan and
compiler of the books Japan Will Turn Ablaze! and Traces that Remain
(available here: www.bahai-library.com/East-asia).

In 1942 Margaret wrote a travel diary of an auto trip she took from
April 25 to May 16 of that year with three then-residents of the Bay Area
to and back from the U.S.-Canada Bahá!í National Convention, held at the
House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois. Her fellow travelers were:

* Ramona Allen Bray (later Brown), author of Memories of Abduʼl-
Bahá: Recollections of the Early Days of the Baháʼís of California, and
pioneer;

* Marzieh Gail, renowned essayist, memoirist, historian, editor (a
number of volumes of The Baháʼí World), translator, pioneer; and

* Robert L. Gulick, Jr., writer and editor (The Baháʼí World, the
foreword to Ms. Gail!s translation, The Seven Valleys and the Four
Valleys), scholar, university administrator, pioneer. The car the travelers
rode in was Robert Gulick!s.

The travel diary came into the hands of the undersigned editor in
the early 2000s through the aforementioned Barbara Sims, his late
mother, who inherited it from her sister Margaret. The editor first read the
diary in the early 1980s during a visit by his mother to her sister!s home:
on that occasion the editor photocopied the diary and sent the copies to
Marzieh Gail and Robert Gulick, receiving an acknowledgment from both;
Ramona Allen Brown had passed away.

The diary is being made available publicly as it gives a snapshot
view—limited in scope, granted—of some of the Bahá!ís of the U.S.
community of another time, and a view also of “the road”, that
quintessentially American place. The account does not give much detail of
the National Convention at Wilmette or, for that matter, of each stop on
the road—a personal diary may be meant to evoke, rather than
thoroughly record, memories. Included, however, are mention of
numerous Bahá!ís the travelers met on the round-trip and of public

meetings the local Bahá!ís arranged for the travelers (indicating quite
detailed planning for the trip), photographs taken on the road and at the
Convention, and memorabilia of the Convention. Also remarked on in the
diary is the ubiquitous presence of mobilizing armed forces, the Second
World War having begun for the United States several months earlier.

Aunt Margaret seems to have already known some of the Bahá!ís
she met on the trip, probably because they had become acquainted at the
old Geyserville Bahá!í School in California, which pretty much all Bahá!ís
west of the Rockies (and many from points beyond) attended at one time
or another, and which Margaret attended regularly, living, as she did, a
couple of hours away by car, and her mother, Helen Burland Rutledge,
being a good friend of Louise Bosch. A number of Bahá!ís Margaret
mentions in the diary—Sylvia Ioas, Vivian Lisoto, Ali Yazdi, Laura Allen—
were residents at the time of the San Francisco Bay Area and thus
familiar to her. (Ali Yazdi and Laura Allen served on the L.S.A. of Berkeley
with Helen Rutledge.)

It is tempting to try to research and write editorial notes about the
many Bahá!ís who are mentioned herein—some names, such as Ali Kuli
Khan, the Trues, Amelia Collins, Sylvia Ioas, will be familiar to most Bahá!í
readers—but suffice it to point out the photograph on page 17 (PDF)
taken at the House of Worship showing Kathryn Frankland—the
indefatigable teacher of the Faith who was spiritual mother to the second
Japanese to become a Bahá!í, Saichiro Fujita, among many others—
standing with Masao Yamamoto, a son of the first Japanese to become a
Bahá!í, Kanichi Yamamoto. The large Yamamoto family—14 members
total—who lived in Berkeley (in the same community as Margaret), across
the bay from San Francisco, before the Second World War (1941-1945),
spent most of that war in what was called by the government a
“Relocation Center”—a euphemism for an internment camp; only Masao,
who (ironically enough) served in the U.S. armed forces, avoided that
fate. In the photo Masao is wearing a military uniform, and the diary refers
to a visit to his post just north of Chicago and also to a speech he gave to
the Convention. Ms. Frankland had taught children!s classes for the
Yamamoto and other kids in California many years earlier.

The auto travelers visited the Yamamoto family on their way home
to California from the Convention, and a photo in the diary of that visit
appears also in the aforementioned Traces that Remain on page 15. The
caption of the photo in Traces states it was taken at a “relocation camp” in

Parlier, a farm town in California!s Central Valley, where the family “were
obliged to live during WWII”, but that information is inaccurate. Parlier was
not the location of such a camp but was about 20 miles (just over 30
kilometers) from an “Assembly Center”—i.e., a detention and staging
facility—in Fresno (and another one a little farther away in Pinedale), from
which Japanese-Americans and Japanese nationals were transported to
camps further inland. The photo was taken while the Yamamotos were
biding time in or near Parlier before being sent on to camp.

According to records produced by the government!s War Relocation
Authority, “Final Accountability Rosters of Evacuees at Relocation Centers
1942-1946”, the Yamamotos were all sent to the Gila River Relocation
Center south of Phoenix, Arizona other than Masao, the serviceman, and
the two oldest sons Hiroshi and Shinji, who were not at Parlier but rather
at the Tanforan Assembly Center near San Francisco, whence they were
sent to the Topaz Relocation Center in Utah. Hiroshi was transferred from
Topaz to Gila River in January 1943, while Shinji—who is listed in records
as married, with a child born in camp—was released from Topaz in
February !44, having found employment in Madison, Wisconsin, where he
lived for the rest of his life. He seems to have been the only one among
the Yamamotos released from camp before war!s end.

The reader should be aware that Margaret Rutledge was a product
of a different age, and so she refers to African-Americans as “colored”
and “Negroes” and mentions matter-of-factly seeing “4 Greyhound buses
full of Japanese going north” who “look very comfortable”—when they
were very likely mostly Japanese-Americans and very likely being sent to
an Assembly Center before being forcibly interned in a Relocation Center,
or camp. She also records her encounter with the Yamamoto family in
California as if it were a picnic in the park, when they had already been
forced out of their home in Berkeley and were soon to be interned in
camp themselves. She was certainly aware of their circumstances but
allows her diary no irony and reflection. She further writes candidly about
places—e.g., “Neb[raska] very dull” (although she liked parts of it)—to an
extent that may hurt some readers! feelings (she also takes shots at a
couple of towns in her native California). That said, Aunt Margaret was a
gentle, sensitive soul, and the editor can confidently say, based on
personal familiarity, that she did not have discriminatory or prejudiced
views of people who were different—in ethnicity or socio-economic status
(or place of residence, for that matter)—from her, and that she would not
knowingly hurt anyoneʼs feelings.

The travel diary itself is in the form of ten pages of single-spaced
typescript placed in an album together with fourteen pages of pho‐
tographs, mailed postcards, and memorabilia of the trip. Most of the
photos of the travelers themselves were taken by Robert Gulick, although
it is uncertain which of the travelers carried cameras. It is not clear
whether Aunt Margaret typed up her account entirely during the trip or
afterward from handwritten notes. (She mentions in one entry doing some
typing.) For this PDF document the diary entries have been retyped by
the editor, with editorial interpolations placed in brackets [ ] and com‐
ments in footnotes. Text in parentheses is Margaretʼs. In the original
account none of the entries have paragraph breaks, but these have been
given by the editor to the longer entries. The title of the diary is
Margaretʼs; the sub-title is the editorʼs.

Some of the photos and most of the other material accompanying the
diary have not been scanned and included herein. The photos that are
included could not be removed from between the original album pages
and covering transparent sheets because they were stuck there, and thus
their scanning was not done under ideal circumstances. Photo-captions in
italics are by the editor.

Aunt Margaret inserted in her album a separate list of daily expenses
en route; these have been incorporated into each daily entry. Also in the
album were two pamphlets from the National Convention: one containing
information for Convention attendees and the other a notice about public
meetings at the House of Worship; these have been included in this
document as two appendices, which begin on page 40 (PDF). The
photograph on the title page of this document was not a part of the diary
but has been included as it shows the diarist formally posed and at
roughly the time (actually several years before) she took the trip.

Addendum: A third appendix was inserted in June 2017 containing
samples of Margaret's poetry, taken from a volume published a few years
before her passing. The poems do not form a part of the travel diary.

Diary of a Cross-country Auto Trip to and
back from the 1942 Bahá’í National Convention

Saturday, April 25 [1942] -- Away after much to-do
and losing of way to El Cerrito, only a half-hour
late. Much high spirits and running about in station
in Sacramento, where Bob [Gulick]’s mother took
train for Paradise.* Snow began about Auburn, in
remnants of great drifts, all melting, mostly dirty
— we found luscious drift and climbed it to take
picture. “Dust devil” shook car all over road near
Truckee. Lake at Norden just thawing out — blue ice
in the midst of snow and whitened trees. Crossed
Nevada line at 1:05 p.m. Reno, Wadsworth, Fernley
(an old white horse there looking sadly at the
river). Nevada hills colored like Siamese cats,
smoke and sand and a blue lake among salt marshes.
Springer’s Hot Springs — pool and cabins, lonely in
the desert. Pastel blue and pink hills, dotted like
Swiss with sagebrush. Ate in Winnemucca where we
gave Temple picture to an army chaplain’s wife and
admired slot machines and punchboards. Battle
Mountain, Elko. Slept there in lovely auto camp;
dared Bob to register as “Brigham Young and wives,
Salt Lake”, which became running gag of trip. Nevada
full of trains, which mooed like mastodons all
night. Bathroom window — an inside window — handy to
living room, very cozy.

Expenses: $1.50 ticket for dinner in Wilmette;
.45 dinner Winnemucca; .04 stamps, etc.; .13 gas,
God knows where.!
* Robert Gulick lived in El Cerrito and his parents in Paradise (the town).
" One dollar in 1942 translates to about 15 dollars in 2015.

Sunday, April 26 -- Gabriel Gulick aroused Nevada
with quotation from Omar [Khayyam] — “Awake! etc.”
Up at 5:30 — gruesome. Ice on windshield of car. Off
to beautiful, glass-fronted cafe for breakfast.
Friendly inebriate offered breakfast to all, waving
$50 bill under startled nose of Ramona [Allen Bray];
also offered to cash check for more. Waitress
without soul discouraged same. Moans. Love at first
fright. The nicest building in Nevada is a reform
school. Beyond Elko, the Ruby Mountains, laced with
snow — exquisite. Welcome, Wells, Wendover Nev.
(very sleepy). Crossed Utah state line at 8:45 a.m.,
lost an hour, so 9:45 a.m. Wendover Ut.: down the
hill to salt flats and refineries. Wide blue
sparkling ditches with white banks, growing into a
flood miles wide. Clear water with mountains
floating in it; horizon impossible to determine.
Cold-colored state, blue and white.

Salt Lake . . . [Mormon] temple towers like
fright-wig standing on end, Moroni in gold on spire,
Tabernacle a secretive tortoise, gold gull statues,
Brigham Young pointing proudly to bank. Clothes in
suitcases clammy with cold. Street arrangements
insane — NW and WN, etc. Bruce Johnson picked us up
and off to friends, as arranged by Bud Lamb*.
Delightful people with sandwiches. Meeting in
rehearsal hall moved to art gallery in basement —
Bob had to walk out on himself. Back to Loomis home
to change clothes, more food, and Mr. Loomis at
piano. Sang ourselves hoarse, left late. Lovely
colored girl, Mrs. Robson, and her mother may come
to Geyserville!. Loomises escorted us out of town
* Artemus Lamb, who later was a pioneer and Counsellor in Latin
America.

and many farewells; week-old assembly has our
complete blessing. Passed by convent: Marzieh
[Gail]’s comment: “Leave ’em lay where Jesus flang
’em!” Over Wyoming state line 6:30 p.m. Rolling
hills, mesas, snow. Evanston, soup in Green River,
night in Rock Springs: shower handily on top of
toilet, no doors just archways. Hilda from
Jugoslavia made us welcome and a drunk set up the
cot for us. Lonely, cold place; air like icy velvet.
Stars like mad.

Expenses: 1.00 lodging Elko; .15 breakfast Elko;
.25 gas Elko; .39 gas Wendover; .25 soup Green
River.

Wyoming. From left, Margaret Rutledge, Marzieh Gail,

Ramona Allen Bray, and Robert Gulick.

Monday, April 27 -- Gabriel plaintively, “It’s five-
thirty!”, cooked breakfast for once — no sugar.
Marzieh and I died. Cold clean air, good in the
lungs, very healthy. Buttes and snow. Discussed
Freud all over Wyoming, violently. Sheep and chuck-
wagons. Rawlins, Bob checked library in Hi School,
as County Library not open, placed “Security for a

Failing World”*; librarian knew G[eorge] Latimer as
boy. Also colored woman who probably went to school
with him was contacted. Washday in Wyoming — they
wear “Longies”. Medicine Bow, snowed last night,
road under construction, muck and mud, no road. Men
wearing helmets over ears, look like Martians. Fresh
snow on passing cars, snow heavy on fences and
bushes — clean cold wind, snow plastered up
telephone poles to the very top. Car got mudbath —
“snow devils” — snow blowing over road. Snow-plow
spit on us after stopping in courtesy — it started
up again too soon. Rock River banked in snow and
abandoned. 7,000 ft. altitude again! Late for lunch
in Laramie because of a blizzard. Where are the
people in these states?

Laramie, civilization again, black and dirty
after white landscapes. Girl gas-station att. in
coveralls got grease on herself, squealed in horror.
Picture of M & M with ice-caked car, snow on lawns.
After talking of hot-dogs for hours, got same at
Mrs. Fadner’s in Laramie, also oranges. All four of
us spoke to about 15 friends she had gathered for
meeting; I am official press-agent for Geyserville,
apparently. Off in a cold wind for Cheyenne. We were
caught with our pants on in Laramie — R. Gulick,
unquote; i.e., no time to change our slacks for
lunch. They offered to keep us all night, as usual.
As fond of Bud Lamb as we are. Sagebrush and sheep.
“Steak! Woolworth’s! Soup! Sinclair!”

Crossed Colorado state line by mistake at 2:40;
map consultation. Buffalo head mounted in state line
store — huge! Back 27 miles to Laramie — (Colo. has
red rocks and trees). Ran off to Woolworth’s for
vital needs but bought earrings, while Bob checked

Univ. library — they had books, and he talked to a
friendly student. Laramie has parking meters. “Your
Freudian slip is showing!” Off to Cheyenne again.
Car hung up on post over chasm, also station wagon
covered with icicles, stalled off road — in last
night’s blizzard? Snow plows still out and busy.
Waved red scarf at the streamliner “City of S.F.”*
while engineer waved and tooted at us and people
waved in the cars; Bob was sure he saw Vivian Lisoto
and we chased the train for miles, under subways and
over overpasses, round and round and caught it in
Cheyenne. Parked car and ran into station and down
platform like crazy; Vivian was on it and got out
looking dazed; lovely reunion in crowd of amused
people. More parking meters. Restaurant butter
stamped “Buy Defense Bonds” and “Keep ’Em Flying”.
First soldiers since Salt Lake. Separated for
dinner, Marzieh and Ramona snooting at the Plains
Hotel dining room; lovely Spanish leather and Indian
rugs. Met road-hog out of Cheyenne; Calif. license
plates. Nebraska state line 8 p.m. Sidney Neb.,
cabin 19. Talked some to lady in charge, asked if
other Baha’is were there. Nice cabin, but our door
to john wouldn’t open and Bob’s wouldn’t close. Bob
asked for flashlight to explore something — then
yells and furniture falling. We all looked —
horrible faces coming down in sky-light; mirror in
ceiling. Hysterics. Talked all night and took
sleeping pills.

Expenses: .69 lodging Rock Springs; .14

breakfast Rock Springs; .05 coke Rawlings; .15 candy
Colo. state line (mistake); .46 Woolworths Laramie
(turban and earrings); .75 dinner Cheyenne.

Tuesday, April 28 -- Gabriel shaving at foot of bed
in silence — no privacy nohow — about 4:45 a.m.
Groans and gags. “No spiking” in Neb.; swiped sign
at breakfast. Trains screaming across Wyoming and
Nebraska all day and night. Green country, but looks
like Livermore*. Tried to steal large iron eagle in
Brule, Neb. (found its daddy in Omaha later).
Ogallala — lady in pink night-gown shooing chickens.
California hussies in pants on Main St. Pretended to
hitch ride in our own car and popped eyes of
natives. Tumbleweed in streets and on highways.
Grain elevators and corn-cribs. Lost hour in North
Platte — looks like San Jose. Miles of hay-stacks.
Quiet cattle and sleepy farms, cyclone cellars like
bee-hives. More trains. Chased Challenger! and beat
it by a mile. No paint in Nebraska, little
farmhouses under every tree. Prairie fire — orange
smoke.

Kearney — tree-shaded lanes, college kids in
slacks, left pamphlet with gas station man who had
heard of the Faith from one of his daughters who are
schoolteachers in NY, Ill., Wyo., and Neb. First
clean rest-rooms since Calif. Railroad “jeep” car.
Neb. very dull. Looks too much like Napa Valley
without hills. Grand Island looks like St. Helena
without hills. Chased Challenger again to Central
City, but nobody we knew was on it. WAHOO — took
picture at station, mailed Ed‡ postcard, was
insulted by bums while doing so. They lean on the
mailbox and stare. Venice, population 30, has store
“The Merchant of Venice”. Platte River — bridge to
* Town in northern California. Here and there in the diary Margaret
compares what she sees on the road to what she knows in California.

‡ Edward Rutledge, Margaret!s eldest brother.

Waterloo is built over islands and 3 channels. Boy’s
Town has a diary farm, huge brick buildings, lovely
grounds; looked very attractive.*

Omaha — great city full of trees, under a cloud.

Rich sections delightful, but downtown looks like
the slums of S.F. Hideous and dirty. Finally found
Doreen Holliday and deputy sheriff husband,
wonderful Baha’i woman and sympathetic though non-
Baha’i [husband] Paul S. Wonderful Lincoln Zephyr —

Margaret wrote a number of postcards on the road. This card was sent
to one of her brothers, Edward, and was signed by all four travelers. (The front of

the card, probably a photo or illustration, was stuck to the album page.)
* Boy!s Town: according to Wikipedia an organization “dedicated to the
care, treatment, and education of at-risk children.”

went through stop-lights and everything. Took us to
bridge over Missouri River and into Iowa at 6:40
p.m. Council Bluffs other end of bridge. Several
verbal rounds with waitress, changing orders; bread
carted back and forth in hand. Iowa gal well able to
take care of herself — loud voice and all. “We’re
firing the cook, so don’t order the chicken!” People
looking at snow marks on car and at Calif. license
[plate]. Tired and silly as bed-bugs. And on into
Iowa. Nice parks and cemeteries. Rolling country,
patches of different crops close together, rich
earth. Hills and dips, gently rolling. Anita, Iowa —
all it needs is a S. Oakland. Iowa looks like
Concord, Calif. Des Moines snuck up on us. Man gave
us lovely directions two or three times; we kept
coming back.

Expenses: 1.00 lodging Sidney; .27 postcards
Sidney; .35 breakfast Sidney; .15 candy Ogallala;
.30 lunch Kearney; .08 toll bridge Omaha; .35 dinner
Council Bluffs; .18 Camels* Des Moines; .10 orange
juice Des Moines.

Wednesday, April 29 -- Cabin with lots of privacy
for a change; Gabriel did not wake us — 7:10 this
a.m.! Des Moines very green and nice. Ate at Hi-Ho,
where girl asked us if we were hitch-hikers or got
Bob from a travel agency. We said we were his wives.
“Woolworth’s!” “Go to Hell!” Censored. Iowa pretty
but dull. Motorists don’t signal at all. Grinnell
little old college town. Middle West all great old
trees and smokey brick. Rich dark earth under spring
plowing. Corn in dried spikes, then more green,
getting hot. Signs: town name or Please Slow Down!
Iowa City — Neb. and Ia. run to brick-paved streets,
* Cigarettes.

very bumpy. Sailors — real ones — studying at
college here. Promised picture of Temple to girl in
stand who had seen it — she had 5 brothers in the
war. Durant, Ia. — noon whistle blew when we were
under it, very loud, scared us silly — fire engine,
air raid, end of world, etc. — we pulled over to
curb in good order automatically, but shaky.

Soldiers with guns on bridge over Mississippi.

Illinois state line 12:30 p.m. More factory whistles
— awful! They don’t blow in Calif. any more — we
can’t take it. Came off bridge into Moline Ill.
Looks like east Oakland with smoke. Man named Dan
Oklock owns tavern there. CCC* camp in full blast
out of Sterling Ill., which is depressing dead town
awarded the Wilted Lily for decrepitude. Clouds of
bugs! They come there every summer — we left. Rock
River country like Russian R[iver] — lovely; but
towns in Ill. all look like Stockton — nyah! Black
Hawk statue 30 ft. high on hill overlooking river —
grey stone over low trees. Very dignified.

Into Wilmette — rich, beautiful suburb with
great gardens and trees — first sight of the Temple,
faint through the branches, the familiar outline
looking very unreal. It has no weight and no
dimensions, like music floating.! Sheridan Road is a
drive to be proud of — we are in good company in
that neighborhood. First person we met, Bud Lamb
coming out of Temple. Located boarding house —
nobody home, so we moved in. Dressed for race unity
dinner in Chicago; pressed for time, Bob wringing
hands in hall. Off to Chicago, looking for Loop;
* Civilian Conservation Corps.

Margaret writes to her mother, “It looks like this and it doesn!t—it!s music
floating and a dream in stone. . . . I almost cried when I saw it.”

asked group of men for “Elevent’ St.”, got involved
in half-hour discussion with gestures in any and all
directions. Were we looking for the Detective
Bureau? Chicago huge but looks like Oakland
exaggerated, except the elevated trains that go like
the devil on wheels. Dinner in great ballroom,
crowded — over 300 places. We were late so didn’t
have to wait for the main course. Speeches and
music, as usual. Back to nice bright twin-bed room,
Ramona upstairs, Bob across town. Drug-store people
had World Order* for sale and were quietly amused by
our all knowing each other and falling over each
other in delight. And so to bed, exhausted.

Expenses: 1.25 lodging Des Moines; .10 breakfast
Des Moines; .05 cone Iowa City; .31 lunch Sterling;
.18 Philip Morris! Sterling; .13 car wash Sterling;
.10 coke Wilmette.

Thursday, April 30 -- Gabriel elsewhere, got up
early anyway. Had to wear civilized clothing.
Devotions in the Temple at 9:00. Trees and
moderately cool wind outside — within, sweat-box,
clothes too heavy. Wilmette full of squirrels. 2
days ago, blizzard — what a change! Hottest April
day in Chicago since the weather bureau started. Met
everybody we ever knew and had no time to write
postcards. Lunch next to a gentleman from Washington
D.C. who looked like Hercule Poirot. Convention well
under way.

Expenses: .11 breakfast Wilmette; .25 lunch
Temple; .10 cokes; .30 postcards Temple; .41 dinner;
.10 coke.

(Daughter in the middle?)

Kathryn Frankland, renowned teacher of the Faith, and Masao Yamamoto, son
of Kanichi Yamamoto, the first Japanese Baháʼí. Masao was stationed at nearby
Fort Sheridan and spoke at the Convention. As a boy he attended Kathrynʼs
childrenʼs classes. The other 13 members of the Yamamoto family, all in
California, were soon to be sent to internment camps in Arizona and Utah.

Friday, May 1 -- I had lunch at True’s, sitting at
same table as Abdul-Baha used, heard stories of the
old days of the Faith from Dr. Khan and Marzieh’s
mother;* V[irginia] Orbison and Harriet Pettibone
also there. Election in the afternoon. Drove out to
Fort Sheridan with Ramona and George E., Vivian
Lisoto and Bob. Saw Masao Yamamoto, ate in fort
commissary. USO! and very nice, juke box, plants on
table, families and girl friends, etc. Got pass #9
at the gate. Way out, Ramona got a grin and a salute
from an officer — Femme Fatale. Hysterics. Thunder-
storm during Ridwan feast at the Temple. Ramona got
a lift to St. Charles to see relatives, so Vivian
stayed in her place. Marzieh got lost and wandered
in later.

Landlady appeared, proved friendly, Jewish,
voluble, wonderful cook; she made coffee and gave
Vivian and me cookies and conversation until Marzieh
came down and got her ear-plugs.

Expenses: .11 breakfast; .15 milkshake Fort
Sheridan; .50 rosewater Temple; .50 Tahirih book.

Saturday, May 2 -- Long talk with landlady,
sympathetic to Cause. Started Tahirih project.

lady had tried to get him to say “Now I lay me ...”*
Tommy said violently: “No! Lah-bah!”

made K[athryn] Frankland change her hat, because the
first one bobbled before her eyes and made her
dizzy. Up into Temple after. Bourgeois wanted the
interior finished in mother-of-pearl; two separate
domes with motor-room for dome search-light between.
Floor to be mosaic tile.‡ Off to Evanston in taxi

Malvina Hoffman’s wonderful Hall of Man, Unity of
Mankind group — 3 races holding up world.* Hayden
Planetarium on little peninsula in lake, black
little dome. Jade and jewels, chain armor and
crocodile skeletons, fighting elephants and Etruscan
breast-plates. Joliet Ill., guards with guns,
stonewalls, narrow barred windows. Dirty town. By-
passed Bloomington and Lincoln Ill. “Pig-hip”
sandwiches. Gas gets cheaper and cigarettes higher
all the way east. Speaking of language difficulty,
Marzieh: “Ramona can always point at their pocket-
books.” By-passed Springfield Ill. on beautiful wide
highway. Heard of Illinois cyclone on Saturday night
we just missed, as usual.

Over the father of waters, wide and black, on a
narrow high bridge, into St. Louis Missouri at 8:50
p.m. Looks like Chicago. Lost in several cemeteries
for some time, looking for cabins, drove into
decrepit tourist camp and discovered it was a
brothel. Bored madam quoted us high prices on cabins
to get rid of us; we finally got the drift and
drifted. Then sorry we hadn’t looked the place over
when we had the chance. Next one mentioned in our
guide pamphlet, much nicer. Recommended by Duncan
Hines — who recommended him!

Expenses: .25 pictures Abdul-Baha; .28 admission

evidently an important part of Aunt Margaret!s diet in those days. (She
indulged in neither in the days the editor knew her.)

from another cemetery. “See Missouri and die.” St.

Charles — escorted out of town by two tanks on the
highway. Country full of Missouri mules, brown and
white. More tanks on highway. Gently rolling and
green country, as usual, trees and farms. Turtles on
highway. Chick sales everywhere. Columbia Mo. —
Stephens College for Women and Univ. of Missouri.
Picked up old man who gave us directions and took
him downtown. Went to Stephens. Girls dress sloppy
and without sox — old tradition — some riding
breeches. Permission to put books in library. Got
lost out of town and politely asked cow the way back
to the highway: “Pardon us, madame . . .”; she shook
her head at us. Old farm-houses and ancient log
cabins — slave quarters? Sang spirituals all over
Missouri. Occasional sprinkles of rain. Missouri
River big and muddy at Boonville. Blackwater River
flooded almost over road. Ate decrepit candy all
over the state.

Kansas City — smoke and rain. Built on rolling
country. Snooty sphinxes on public building.
Missouri R. again. 4:15 p.m. crossed into Kansas
City Kan. Old towns and more cemeteries. Kansas just
like Missouri: rolling, green, and rain. West into
the sun. Soft warm green country. Topeka Kan. — not
bad. Parking meters. Went to see Mrs. Bertha
Campbell and out to dinner with her. Meeting at
Hotel Jayhawker; headline in Topeka Daily Capital:
“Baha’i Leaders through Topeka Today!” Nice little
crowd. Group of 6 Baha’is, 5 isolated. 27 people,
saw Ramona’s cousin afterward. Hospitality plus.

Expenses: 1.20 lodging St. Louis; .30 cigarettes
St. Louis (Mills); .15 breakfast St. Louis; .51
lunch Columbia; .13 earrings, etc. Columbia.

Wednesday, May 6 -- We hated to leave Topeka.

Beautiful breakfast with R’s cousin. More relatives
in Manhattan with new house we went through. Cavalry
at Fort Riley; we waved and they waved back. Fine-
looking negroes. Jeeps and motorcycles, white and
colored soldiers, all friendly. Junction City, Kan.
— many hoboes on road and hitch-hikers in last 4
states. Stopped for gas at “Deserted town”, asked
horrible old man for coffee; he leered and said
there wasn’t any. Wanted to get rid of us.
Bootlegger? Speculations. Cold wind. After Junction
City, Kansas is flat and dull. Corn looks like
Indian villages. Stately Model-Ts on road. Western
Kansas desolate and bare and brown.

Colorado state line 3:45 p.m. Gained hour at
Oakley Kan. Cheyenne Wells, Colo. — gave Temple
address to man in drug store (John Coane), who went
to meetings years ago in Denver and Washington, to
give librarian in town to inquire about books. First
snow out of Limon, Colo. A mile high, but warm.
Eastern Colorado bare and brown and blah. Pike’s
Peak rising white and gorgeous over a brown plain at
last. Colorado Springs, Colo. nice little town with
Spanish touches. Sailors — why? (This town has
already lost about 2,700 men to the armed forces;
practically no men left until something in the
defense line moved to town.) Clean, well-built
business section. Marzieh and I eloped for dinner in
a jernt; Bob and Ramona went to the hotel for
chicken and have groaned since.

Temerity Ranch — Ramona slept in a Haunted Bed
from Venice. Gold angels and beige lace. We decided
that Byron had slept in it, as he did in every bed
in Venice in his day. We were in a blue room with
thousands of books. Art treasures from all over the
world. Peach linen sheets and silk covers; fur bed-
spreads.

Expenses: 1.00 lodging Topeka; .46 lunch Ellis;
.05 coke Cheyenne Wells; .41 Colorado Springs.

Temerity Ranch, Pine Valley, Colorado. Loulie Albee Mathews (correct spelling),
author of Not Every Sea Hath Pearls, was a volunteer care-giver to wounded
soldiers in France during the First World War, and held meetings for Baháʼís and
seekers at her hotel suite in Paris during her stay in France—at some of which
meetings a young Shoghi Effendi spoke before he proceeded to England to
matriculate at the University of Oxford, and some of which a preteen Marzieh
Gail attended with her family (see her book Arches of the Years). Loulie was a
travel-teacher in Latin America among other places, and established a school for
Baháʼí teachers at Temerity Ranch.

Thursday, May 7 -- Luxurious breakfast with
revolving tray in middle of table. Fine nudes in
bathroom, white woolly rugs. Beautiful sunny weather
— heard of blizzard in Nebraska we would have gone
through coming the other way. Jenny on piano after
lunch. Then to town, Colo. Springs, and shopped all

over for clam-diggers, leg make-up, false eyelashes,
harlequin glasses. Nobody ever heard of them and we
gave up. Went to Garden of the Gods, through
sanitarium grounds where patients live in a series
of bee-hives. Red rock in amazing spires; birds
living in holes in the cliffs. Bought fire opals.
Bob followed us absentmindedly into place he
wouldn’t have been caught dead in. Manitou Springs —
soda water not bad. Will Rogers memorial on hill
looking like misplaced Coit Tower. Back to ranch for
dinner. Got nervous over our talks, but the meeting
was lovely. Beautiful negro girl concert pianist
played Debussy. Friend of Jessie Perry. My hands
shook so I went over and leaned on the table —
always informal. Ovaltine with Lulie and so to bed.

Expenses: .10 lemonade Colorado Springs; 3.37

fire opals Garden of the Gods.

Friday, May 8 -- Lulie hugged us goodbye and off to
town — leg make-up, girdles, slacks, etc. Finally
off for New Mexico; hot as blazes. Pueblo full of
monuments, green with trees. Old, old houses,
Toonerville trolleys*. Arkansas River muddy through
town, green, clear and still in the country beyond.
Then sagebrush desert. Snowy mountains lovely over
dry plain. Passed burned oil truck by side of road.
Rockies tremendous. Spanish Peaks glittering with
snow. Walsenburg, small and usual. Then more
mountains — I’m going to be homesick for western
Colorado; the name of one [mountain] translates in
Arabic as “The Proof of God” — we felt what the name
meant. Over 8,000 ft. high — snow down to road

cartoon of the day.
again.*

Fort Garland, Colo., bus stop, Marzieh gave
Message to old Indian, Frank Levato. Bob made cracks
about john, stood self in corner (military training
to improve marksmanship). Farther on, floods over
road. New Mexico line 3 p.m. — cheers! More and more
adobe, old and crumbling. Plaster lions on roof of
gas station at Costilla. Waved at Indians. Dust
devils on desert. Mud huts and Indians. Taos, broken
down, but some beautiful estates (Duane van Vechten
and Mabel Dodge Luhan) with barbed wire, “Keep Out”,
dogs, etc. Looked for D.H. Lawrence’s outhouse
painted with phoenix.!

Out to Taos pueblo on lousy road. Indian
children begged for pennies, adorable. Bob and
Marzieh talked to Indians, Ramona gave a girl her
perfume. Bought tomahawk, from one of the Luhans.
White leather boots, bright dresses. Marzieh gave a
baby a penny and he ran. Indian girl working service

herein as it appears faded, either because of deterioration or an incorrect
original exposure; however, the Wikipedia page “Spanish Peaks” has a
photo of the mountains that seems to have been taken from nearly the
same spot as the diary!s. Wikipedia states that one of the Spanish Peaks
is over 12,000 feet (about 3,800 meters) high; the other over 13,000 feet
(about 4,000 meters). Wikipedia also explains that the Ute Indians named
the peaks “Huajatolla” (transliterated Spanish style and pronounced Wa-

" Famed novelist D.H. Lawrence lived in Taos for a period in the 1920s

there by Mabel Dodge Luhan. Ms. Luhan gave a ranch to the Lawrences.

ranch in a shrine—which may have been an outhouse formerly (or at
least Ms. Luhan suggested so)—decorated with a phoenix design.

station. Men wearing colored sheet blankets over
heads, look like Arabs, not Indians. Smart Spanish
boy of 12 (Gilbert Luis De Vargas) picked us up and
showed us Kit Carson’s grave in old deserted
cemetery; second stone, as first one had been
chipped away by tourists. About seven small children
adopted Bob, clinging to his hands; Gilbert said to
him gravely: “You have many friends.” He took us to
the Luhan place, warned us of dogs and showed us a
corner of the famous outhouse, also the Church of
the Penitentes*, warning us again not to go too
close, as his sister had seen their ceremony the
month before. His uncle owned a restaurant in town,
but as he had never eaten there he would not go so
far as to recommend the food. Delightful,
intelligent boy; he wanted Marzieh’s address so he
could write to her. Seemed to take to the Baha’i
ideas. Spanish edition of Spencer Tracy at 12.!

Marzieh told Indians N.M. is like Persia. They
said “Where’s your pueblo?” She said “Thousands of
miles away” and everybody was happy. Rio Grande
gorge like miniature Grand Canyon; river at bottom
not big and but turbulent. Went out on ancient
suspension bridge to look at the current and got
dizzy. Bridge was rushing upstream. Sweet smell of
sagebrush in the air. No plumbing in New Mexico —
southern exposures everywhere. Tortilla Flat or

American Roman Catholic men active in northern and central New Mexico
and southern Colorado.”

Saroyan country.* Sheep-herders’ camp across Rio
Grande. Green Valley, neat farms, adobe. Sunset — a
purple “Spanish moss” formation hanging over red
clouds with gold fringes. Santa Fe, ate in Faith
Cafe — menu solid pepper — Bob put some in Marzieh’s
water and the war was on. Indians selling jewelry
and pottery in the restaurant; friendly, fine-
looking people. Sang off to Albuquerque in the dark.

Saturday, May 9 -- Went to see Dr. Lenore Morris and
her doctor husband who are Baha’is; were plied with
carrot juice. She told us we were first Baha’is to
visit Albuquerque in a year and a half. Full of
plans and have done a lot. She is president of
professional women’s club there, with fine prestige;
two grand people. Went back to service station and
Bob talked to attendant, Spanish boy — Lalo Chavez.
Marzieh tackled lady of Swedish appearance, very
somber, who proved to be of “I AM” extraction, with
gestures. We left. Out into desert; at every
historical marker, Marzieh: “Somebody ate somebody
here, no doubt.” Stopped at Ye Olde Wagon Wheel
(sic!), bought little drum. Hot now, beginnings of
cactus, yucca, etc. Dry and barren. Mesas against
the horizon. Ate at Vaughn, where I was
undercharged, then given too much change! Owner had
broken wrist from putting out drunk and Marzieh gave
his wife a healing prayer; 16 month old baby girl
and littlest thing I ever saw. Out into desert
again; wild flowers by road, blue, yellow and white.
* Reference to a John Steinbeck novel and author William Saroyan.

Picked up handsome hitch-hiker, Bill Brooks,
Vaughn to Roswell; he told us his family in Jal N.M.
killed 76 rattlers last year around their house — “a
poor year”. Irish and Navajo combination, 5 ft. 9
inches, 205 lbs., football player at Albuquerque (?)
college. We stopped for water at a lonesome gas
station and were greeted by a crazy howling dog who
gave us the creeps. No sign of life, sick fighting
cocks in the yard, forlorn wash on the line. We
started the windmill,* but it was broken; no gas in
the pumps, either. Material for gruesome story.
Finally raised suspicious woman in house — they had
no water either. We had thought somebody was dead
there. 30 coyotes hung on the fence skinned, in
running postures and every stage of decay, down to
skeletons.

Roswell, military institute, uniforms all over
town, nice town, too. We tried to buy Bill a coke,
but Irish and Indian stubbornness beat Bob’s Dutch,
so he bought us one. We took his address; swell kid.
I think he really liked us; we did him. Out of
Roswell, luscious black storm coming up with
streamers of rain in the distance. We had a flat
just as the rain began in huge warm drops. Sheet
lightning and thunder, birds flying low before it,
hot wind, horses in the fields galloping in panic in
all directions, tumbleweeds wild over the desert;
dust-storm in another direction. Bob trying to
change tire, Marzieh and me trying to steady the car
on the jack — it slipped with just me holding it.
Finally got back to Roswell, fixed tire and off
again. Storm short and fierce. We drove after it.
New Mexico full of choice cow-boys ogling us, and
good horses. Followed the Noisy River into Apache

country. Cow eating paper. People with lovely Texas
accents. Mescalero — Apache reservation, met mob of
Apache children, gave girls perfume, all pictures
and pamphlets. We thought they would love Artemus
Lamb. They giggled but listened. Dinner in Tularosa.
Very quiet place, people would not talk to us except
one strangled “Hello girls” at Marzieh and me from a
lonesome little soldier.

On to Alamagordo, where we luxuriated in lovely
bathroom until I happened to catch sight of a man’s
face just disappearing from the window. Not scared
somehow — walked to the door and said loudly to
Ramona and Marzieh, “There’s some guy looking in the
window here. Where did I pack my gun? It’s a good
thing my grandmother taught me how to shoot!” Loud
crash in underbrush as prowler lit off across
country; I wonder if he is still running. Gravel
crunched, a carnival caroused in the next lot, dogs
all over town were barking, plumbing was screaming
and we tried to sleep. Woke up Bob to tell him about
prowler and he was very unconcerned — still asleep.

Sunday, May 10 -- Gulick bearish, town lovely. Sign
on bank steps, “Please don’t sit here.” Adobe and
green trees. Out to White Sands — snowy dunes.
Lovely ranger with shoulders and smile. Rolled like
puppies, slid down dunes, took pictures. Sand pure
white and cool — gypsum. Went back to museum, bought
gypsum horse. Lovely cactus garden in bloom in front
* Cinnamon-flavored candy.

of it. Cactus out on desert looks like lances stuck
in a bull. Cattle guards, metal grills in road —
lovely on tires.

Texas line 11:40 a.m., flowers all over desert.

Brown mountains around green plain. El Paso. Fort
Bliss, veddy formal and uninviting — tent cities all
around. Lots of stone and brick buildings — pretty
town. Soldiers and their girls all over — no
unaccompanied women at all. Mexican border,
confusion. To avoid 4 examinations of all luggage,
had to leave car behind, then the official started
to read this diary, with expression of acute
distaste; begged me to leave it behind. We left all
papers in U.S.* Hot and dusty, and full of tourists;
Mexican men stare like anything. Lost Bob in garage,
ran gauntlet in street, then came back to find him
having his shoes shined! Bob and Marzieh shared a
taco fried in the street; a boy told them it was a
gordita. Gave the women a nickel and got 15 cents in
Mexican change! Had to pay 2 cents toll to walk over
on bridge. Baby chihuahuas in basket on street for
sale. Bull-fight going on, with band playing bad
movie music — bad band, too. “85 cents on sunny
side, $1.35 on shady side.” We didn’t. Went home to
Texas.

Off to Carlsbad Caverns. Brown, bare escarpments
over plain, looking dead. Salt flats. Then beetling
cliffs, with loose rocks threatening. N.M. again.
8:00 p.m. Whites City — bats swooping at dusk out of
caverns, over roofs of auto court, the biggest court
we ever saw, rows and rows over the hill. Frog in
shower, named him Archie, took shower anyway. He
watched. Moths like clouds, one trying to drown
himself in the bowl. Plaintive voice in twilight —
* The travelers crossed from El Paso to Ciudad Juarez.

“There are things coming up out of the drain . . .”
and so to bed. Gulick named himself today: “Guide,
foolosopher and friend” — Heil Gulick! Der Fuhrer
der Better.

Alam.; .08 tire fixed Alam.; .40 horse and drink
White Sands; .15 juice El Paso; .26 soup Whites City
N.M.; .30 cigarettes Whites City.

Monday, May 11 -- Up with frog, off for caverns.
Hot, naked country, full of vultures. Caverns
impossibly lovely, walked about 9 miles. Were told
to ask the guides any questions we wanted — all
Marzieh wanted to know was the telephone number of a
cute blond one. I didn’t blame her! Down to lunch,
200 of us, joined those who came in the elevator and
walked some more around the level caverns — double
file, people stretched out for a long way:
procession of damned souls wandering their way to
hell — Dante should have seen us. Rock of Ages —
darkness ceremony: lights out, complete black, then
record of chorus singing to hymn, then chamber by
chamber the lights came up.* Then back to lunchroom
and elevators; we elected to walk out, with about 35
others. Hardy souls. Ramona had decided not to go
down, but stayed and talked to ranger about Faith,
gave him pamphlet — day not wasted. Daylight looked
blue and funny to the rest of us. Hot as blazes
outside.

Off for El Paso over same road; Texas line 4:05

p.m. Long, dull, hot trip; dinner in El Paso with
soldiers and off north. N.M. again ad nauseam. 8:15
* The Rock of Ages is a natural formation within the Big Room, the largest
chamber in Carlsbad Caverns. In those days a “ceremony” was held
which included a light-show to the Christian hymn “Rock of Ages”.

p.m. Las Cruces, very nice. Farewell to the Rio
Grande — flat and quiet here. Deming N.M. —
beautiful auto camp with blue tile bathroom,
cheerful furniture, etc. Washed hair, dispossessing
10 states.

Expenses: .89 lodging Whites City; .26 breakfast
Whites C.; .15 cards and stamps Whites C.; 2.16
Carlsbad Caverns and lunch; .31 gas Whites C.; .35
dinner El Paso.

Tuesday, May 12 -- Out through desert. Tall yucca,
looking like plumes in a bull again. Lordsburg —
mostly a huge Moorish auto camp. Arizona state line
10:00 a.m. We think we will like this state. Duncan
— river and lovely green trees and fields, but
barren, fierce mountains. “Open range — look out for
cattle”. Border station — had to be inspected and
passed.* Saw owls and gila monsters and chipmunks,
bought Indian doll pin there. Safford very nice, had
to be dragged away as usual. Traces of snow on
* “Border station” here apparently refers to an inspection station at or
near the N.M.-Ariz. state line, not the U.S.-Mexico border.

mountains. San Carlos Reservoir huge, long and
green; rough, rolling country with sweet-smelling
sagebrush. First “coat-hanger” trees. Perfect mesas.

Coolidge Dam — ranger asked about cameras, guns,
made us drive slowly over bridge with windows shut;
guard with shotgun in the middle. Arizona hats don’t
blow off — curled brims. Lots of cactus, all kinds.

Margaret and Marzieh posing by a saguaro

cactus in the Sonoran Desert, Arizona.

Globe — fancy auto camps, little frame houses,
people just sitting. Ate in drug store and tried on
all perfumes. Miami very frontier and awful. Wound
up through Superstition Mountains — bare, hot, bad
and threatening with overhanging rocks; we got
really nervous. Just like their name. Mountains
balancing on a hair. Lots of coat-hangers, mostly
black-spotted with blight. Superior — factory with
smoke. Out into hills — landscape unbelievable,

coat-hangers and blooming cactus, rough and savage
hills. Took pictures. Zoo in desert (one of many),
mostly flies. An owl stared at us, we howled with
laughter, rest of zoo rose in uproar. We left with
cactus candy. Mesa Ariz. not bad. Tempe — beautiful
swimming pool making us jealous — much like
California along here. Beautiful 4-lane highway.
Phoenix very civilized. We like Arizona as we had
thought.

Called the Schoenys and were at once taken over
for the duration. Zahrl, 7, welcomed us in gold
satin trunks — his usual costume and very becoming.
Spent the night there; went out to Glendale after
dinner and saw Millie Collins and the friends there;
all 4 of us had to tell of the Convention and our
trip. Caswell Ellis much on hand and getting tall.
Anne Holley there for a week already, with job, and
there to stay.

Expenses: 1.13 lodging Deming; .15 breakfast
Deming; .05 coke border station Ariz.; .35 Indian
pin border station; .56 Woolworths Globe; .35 lunch
Globe; .20 cactus candy and lemonade Arizona desert
somewhere; .20 dinner Phoenix.

Wednesday, May 13 -- Constant drone of bombers night
and day. Scratch marks all over from adorable cat;
rabbit also household pet. Hugged the family goodbye
and away. Beautiful rich, green country; many palm
trees and citrus orchards. Back to rich desert with
yellow-blooming cactus and coat-hangers. Cool and
delightful on desert. Brother Noah’s for lunch —
floor show rather crude: “How did you know we were
from Salt Lake?” Looked like Walter Catlett* — dirty
mind. Into Yuma Desert — real dirt and brush desert.
* Character actor in Hollywood movies.

Yuma, not bad. Baggage inspection at border — took
it all out. 2:10 p.m. California state line. Indian
man and woman in wagon — her hair flowing, very
dark, classic features — longed for picture of her.
First sand desert. Mountains like brown jagged paper
cut out and pasted on the sky — Marzieh’s
description. Dunes in irregular waves. Canals
through the sand. Then Imperial Valley with lush
alfalfa, palms, citrus orchards like Arizona.

Calexico — neat and pretty, but hot. Firemen on
fire-truck racing down street, in shirt-sleeves and
hair blowing in the wind — no hats. Bob got Customs
courtesy at the border and they waved us over, while
we women gawked in admiration at him. Drove around
Mexicali and back; no tourists visible, nice clean
town; walked through a park while the Latin look
followed us. Were waved back over the border without
trouble — we are still staggered at his success and
are almost courteous to him. Trees, wide streets,
good buildings in Mexicali — took the bad taste of
Juarez out of our mouths. El Centro and away.
Incredible ranges of crumpled mountains, 3 deep.
Were held up by road workers hauling away a mountain
on the road, so got out and disrupted their work — I
almost got left there. Looking back on Imperial
Valley from Desert Coyote Mountain — great hazy
vista of rich color; forward, 4 or 5 ranges more out
into haze. Then down into a thick wooded valley,
more trees than we had seen in weeks — dense and
lovely, with great clumps of wild lilacs in bloom.
First fog of trip coming over hill ahead. Ate in
Ramona, and Ramona thought it awful. Tried to find
rooms there, but the dam workers had them all.
Opened door of Gospel Mission to see what the
moaning was about; a women came, and we left in a
hurry. Some very nice automobiles outside it. On to

Escondido, where we found a tourist home, not an
auto camp, and slept like logs.

Expenses: .30 lunch Brother Noah’s Ariz. desert;
.20 malt Yuma; .50 dinner Ramona.

Thursday, May 14 -- Cool morning, but not for long.
Orange groves — blossoms and fruit at the same time.
Valley Center — went to see Vera Scott on ranch in
Indian reservation. Very attractive woman, living
enthusiastic country life, building more house and
doing an incredible amount of work. Cow (Mary One-
horn) and calves, horses and cat, a hen raising a
duckling. Even the fence-posts are growing. House
full of antiques. Vista, Calif., next — orange
groves and geraniums. Oceanside — first view of
Pacific. San Juan Capistrano Mission looked nice, we
didn’t go in, but could see the gardens — town
capitalizing on swallows. Swallow gift shops, etc.
High old crumbling adobe walls, jewel plants and
geraniums. Laguna — lovely and theatrical. Looked
for Alais, were finally informed by police they had
left. Corona del Mar — great lagoon and boats.
Newport Bay. Then forests of oil derricks near Long
Beach — hundreds, rocker arms in motion. (Note: as
all of us speak French, the four of us usually speak
in it because it is so secretive, when we don’t want
each other to understand; Marzieh won a pair of ear-
rings about here.)*
* The meaning of Margaret!s note here is not clear—she might have
partly mistyped it or accidentally left something out. She may be trying to
say that the four travelers sometimes spoke among themselves in French
when they wanted privacy, and tried to stump one another with French
words or expressions the others didn!t know—which would explain
Marzieh Gail winning the earrings: considering her upbringing, it is likely
her French was the most fluent.

Farther on, smell of orange groves delirious.

Ate at Knott’s Berry Place, best meal of trip maybe,
then went through their ghost town and took
pictures; I found some goslings in a pond, and a
museum. Spent 2 hours there. Off through oil wells
again; hot like Hades. Pasadena, saw Charles and
Helen Bishop and their new house, very clean, fresh
and uncluttered. They and Joy Allen and we went out
to dinner, then Ramona and I went to stay with
V[irginia] Orbison in Glendale, Marzieh back with
Bishops, and Bob to his sister’s in L.A. “When will
we 4 meet again?”

Expenses: .94 lodging Escondido; .16 breakfast
Escon.; .27 gas Laguna; .95 lunch Knott’s Berry Farm
Buena Park; .30 dinner Pasadena.

Friday, May 15 -- Slept till 10:30, got up to find
Virginia had left long ago. Breakfast with Julie,
blonde cocker spaniel. Then Ramona went back to bed
with a book and I typed and sorted notes all day.
The lady who was to pick us up had her car
commandeered in the morning and we were stuck. But
we needed the rest. In the evening, the regional
teaching committee met there, and we sat in and
helped. Nothing silent about us!

Expenses: 1.00 lunch Glendale (V. Orbison); .26

cigarettes Glendale.

Saturday, May 16 -- Bob is telling everybody that if
we women had our way and stopped everywhere we
wanted to that the car would be pulling into Chicago
about now! I detect quiet bitterness — or is it
indulgence in a resigned way? Away, not too early.
In Glendale, 4 Greyhound buses full of Japanese
going north. Look very comfortable. Bakersfield —
everything labeled “the world’s finest”. More oil

wells — forests on horizon in 3 directions. More
hitch-hikers than ever. Delano, Earlimart, flat,
straight road forever. Pixley, Tulare — all the
towns look alike. World’s largest peach, apricot and
nectarine orchard, going on for miles. Goshen,
mirage in distant orchards — trees seem to be
floating in clear water.

Parlier, California. Left photo, standing, from left: Ramona Allen Bray, Kanichi
Yamamoto (the first Japanese to become a Baháʼí), Goro Yamamoto, Marzieh
Gail; kneeling, Fumiko Yamamoto, Margaret Rutledge. Michiaki Yamamoto was
accidentally cropped out of the original photo, but is partly visible in the right
photo with his sister and brother. The Yamamotos were soon to be sent to an
internment camp at the Gila River Indian Reservation in Arizona, where they
were confined for the duration of WWII. (The two eldest brothers, Hiroshi and
Shinji, were not at Parlier and were sent to a camp in Utah; the third eldest,
Masao, was serving in the armed forces.)

Parlier, looking for Yamamotos. 17 sets of
directions, finally got there. All growing up, 2

little girls darling. 5 puppies crawling all over
me, to my delight — sat in the dirt with clean
slacks, just to get them all in my lap. Then went
out to farm where Fumiko, Gorro and Mitchiaki work,
to see them, taking their father with us. The
irrigating water gave out temporarily, just in time
for them to have a visit with us; we took pictures
of them. They gave us a crate of asparagus and
refused to be paid for it. Fumi darling in jeans and
hickory shirt; getting calluses now, but thought
she’s die of the hard work at first. We got
ambitious and pulled a few weeds, too, just for fun.

Then into Fresno, where we got even with the
hospitable family by sending them a large box of
candy. Lots of soldiers, and me with the hiccups.
Over San Joaquin River — Madera, Chowchilla, Merced,
Turlock, Modesto, Manteca, Tracy, Livermore —
Oakland. But we can’t believe it is all over. Will
our compulsions get us up in the morning to go on? I
could stood it.

Expenses: .26 lunch Earlimart; .26 snack Fresno;
.70 candy for Yamamotos Fresno; .20 chili Livermore.
$19.21 payment for gas on credit card to Bob.

The Saga of Simon — Chorus
> Twenty-one nights on an auto-camp floor,
> We’d like to go back there and do it some more;
> Gulick and Rutledge and Gail and Bray,
> We’d like to be out on the road to stay.*
* These last lines are handwritten. In a postcard sent to her parents
during the trip, Margaret kiddingly refers to fellow-traveler Robert Gulick
as “Simon Legree”, the name of the slave-abusing villain of Uncle Tomʼs
Cabin; this might explain the title of the closing ditty. Given Margaret!s
fondness for music and literature, there may be other cultural references
at play (e.g., possibly a Broadway show). The travel diary ends here.

Appendix 1

Following is an information pamphlet distributed to the 1942 Bahá!í
National Convention attendees. It was included with the diary. The
pamphlet is folded in quarters, and thus has eight panels. The original
pamphlet measures about 4.25 x 5.5 in. (about 11 x 14 cm). Immediately
below is the scanned original front panel.

The second (left) and third (right) panels of the pamphlet. Unfortunately,
the scanned image did not fully fit onto this PDF page with the tools
immediately available to the editor, and so the third panel has been typed
in full below.

LUNCHROOM IN TEMPLE: Lunches will be served
immediately after the morning session every day,
Thursday thru Sunday. Cost, 25¢. Hot dinners will be
served Thursday and Saturday evenings, following the
afternoon session. Cost, 65¢.
IMPORTANT: Those wishing dinner should register at
the Information Bureau as soon as possible.
TEMPLE TOURS: Friday, 1:15 to 1:45 PM. Assemble

Appendix 2

Following is an information pamphlet on public meetings at the House of
Worship. It was included with the diary. Like the above pamphlet it is
folded in quarters, with eight panels, and its original size about 4.25 x 5.5
in. (11 x 14 cm). The second and back panels both have quotations from
the Writings, but the back is stuck to the album and its verses cannot be
read; the unfolding inside panels (4, 5, 6, 7) are blank. Immediately below
is the scanned original front panel.

The second panel. Unfortunately it did not scan well and cannot be read
clearly even when enlarged. Its content has been typed by the editor and
appears on the next page.

Excerpts From the

BAHA’I WRITINGS

“The world is one country, and mankind its
citizens.”

* * *
“The lovers of mankind, these are the superior men,
of whatever nation, creed or color they may be.”

* * *
“The religion of God is One Religion, and all the
prophets have taught it, but it is a living and
growing thing, not lifeless and unchanging.”

* * *
“That which the Lord hath ordained as the sovereign
remedy and the mightiest instrument for the healing
of all the world is the union of all its peoples in
one universal Cause, one common Faith.”

* * *
“The real treasury of man is knowledge. Knowledge is
the means of honor, prosperity, joy, gladness,
happiness and exultation.” “Universal education is a
universal law.” “To acquire education is encumbent
on all.”
“The gift of God to this enlightened age is the
knowledge of the oneness of mankind and the
fundamental oneness of religion . . . It is the hour
of unity of the sons of men and the drawing together
of all races and classes . . . For universality is
of God and all limitations are earthly.”

Appendix 3

Following are five of Margaretʼs poems, taken from Quintet in concert:

Grove, California, U.S.A. by Whys World Publications (now defunct).

> SONNET FOR CAPTIVITY
> Dote not on eyes and lips and voices sweet
> With youth to still the dreams in musicʼs grove --
> Dote not on flesh that all perfections move --
> On the most tender hands, devoted feet
> That ever an imperfect pathway beat.
> Old idol-worshippers have built this love
> Whose senses cry the atomʼs touch to prove
> The nearest thing to spirit mortals meet.
> Passion will die, poor heart, for all your tears
> And white hands turn to claws -- why say again
> What whispers through the purest songs of men
> And makes them sing the louder for their fears?
> O Soul! In this your folly takes its prize --
> Seeking immortal love in human eyes!

> SLAP
> Find your little place again
> And stay where you belong --
> Kings who ruled in Ithaca
> Are slaves in Babylon!

> THE DOVE COMES BACK
> Upon the tense warped deck of faith I stand,
> My eager eyes still straining for a sign
> Of the white prayer I loosed with trembling hand --
> Lord! Is that flying spray, or wings that shine?
EVOLUTION
Did a small sea-dwelling creature
One morning say to himself
“I will climb out on this rock
And stretch my legs”?
How did he know he had legs,
Mutated by patient ancestors?
How did he guess that his gills
Might be changed to breathe air?
And how could he trust there was air?
What terminal courage
Must help a small form
Lift to another world?
What infinite nosiness
Have we inherited?

PHOENIX
Out of the crucible, the fiery bird
Spreads its new-burning wings to a new sun
Lord, in the dazzling terror of Thy Word
Help man to do as this his dream has done!
Our wings are beating in the worldʼs mean dust,
Our plumage draggles from the claws of fear --
Oh, Merciful, more kind than Thou art just,
Thy purifying Flame again sings near!
Out of the crucible, the soul unblurred,
The love unselfed, the purpose turned a sun --
Lord, in the glorious terror of Thy Word
Help man to know Thy Will! Thy Will be done!

  Gulick and Three Women

Diary of a Cross-country Auto Trip

to and back from
the 1942 Bahá!í National Convention

by

Margaret Marie Rutledge

Foreword

Margaret Marie Rutledge (later Cavanaugh) was born in San
Francisco, California in 1914, and passed away in Monterey, California in
1996\. She grew up in Stockton, in California!s Central Valley, and in
Berkeley, in the San Francisco Bay Area, and remained in the Bay Area,
serving for decades on the Spiritual Assembly of Alameda. She was the
older sister of Barbara Rutledge Sims, a long-term pioneer to Japan and
compiler of the books Japan Will Turn Ablaze! and Traces that Remain
(available here: www.bahai-library.com/East-asia).

In 1942 Margaret wrote a travel diary of an auto trip she took from
April 25 to May 16 of that year with three then-residents of the Bay Area
to and back from the U.S.-Canada Bahá!í National Convention, held at the
House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois. Her fellow travelers were:

* Ramona Allen Bray (later Brown), author of Memories of Abduʼl-
Bahá: Recollections of the Early Days of the Baháʼís of California, and
pioneer;

* Marzieh Gail, renowned essayist, memoirist, historian, editor (a
number of volumes of The Baháʼí World), translator, pioneer; and

* Robert L. Gulick, Jr., writer and editor (The Baháʼí World, the
foreword to Ms. Gail!s translation, The Seven Valleys and the Four
Valleys), scholar, university administrator, pioneer. The car the travelers
rode in was Robert Gulick!s.

The travel diary came into the hands of the undersigned editor in
the early 2000s through the aforementioned Barbara Sims, his late
mother, who inherited it from her sister Margaret. The editor first read the
diary in the early 1980s during a visit by his mother to her sister!s home:
on that occasion the editor photocopied the diary and sent the copies to
Marzieh Gail and Robert Gulick, receiving an acknowledgment from both;
Ramona Allen Brown had passed away.

The diary is being made available publicly as it gives a snapshot
view—limited in scope, granted—of some of the Bahá!ís of the U.S.
community of another time, and a view also of “the road”, that
quintessentially American place. The account does not give much detail of
the National Convention at Wilmette or, for that matter, of each stop on
the road—a personal diary may be meant to evoke, rather than
thoroughly record, memories. Included, however, are mention of
numerous Bahá!ís the travelers met on the round-trip and of public

meetings the local Bahá!ís arranged for the travelers (indicating quite
detailed planning for the trip), photographs taken on the road and at the
Convention, and memorabilia of the Convention. Also remarked on in the
diary is the ubiquitous presence of mobilizing armed forces, the Second
World War having begun for the United States several months earlier.

Aunt Margaret seems to have already known some of the Bahá!ís
she met on the trip, probably because they had become acquainted at the
old Geyserville Bahá!í School in California, which pretty much all Bahá!ís
west of the Rockies (and many from points beyond) attended at one time
or another, and which Margaret attended regularly, living, as she did, a
couple of hours away by car, and her mother, Helen Burland Rutledge,
being a good friend of Louise Bosch. A number of Bahá!ís Margaret
mentions in the diary—Sylvia Ioas, Vivian Lisoto, Ali Yazdi, Laura Allen—
were residents at the time of the San Francisco Bay Area and thus
familiar to her. (Ali Yazdi and Laura Allen served on the L.S.A. of Berkeley
with Helen Rutledge.)

It is tempting to try to research and write editorial notes about the
many Bahá!ís who are mentioned herein—some names, such as Ali Kuli
Khan, the Trues, Amelia Collins, Sylvia Ioas, will be familiar to most Bahá!í
readers—but suffice it to point out the photograph on page 17 (PDF)
taken at the House of Worship showing Kathryn Frankland—the
indefatigable teacher of the Faith who was spiritual mother to the second
Japanese to become a Bahá!í, Saichiro Fujita, among many others—
standing with Masao Yamamoto, a son of the first Japanese to become a
Bahá!í, Kanichi Yamamoto. The large Yamamoto family—14 members
total—who lived in Berkeley (in the same community as Margaret), across
the bay from San Francisco, before the Second World War (1941-1945),
spent most of that war in what was called by the government a
“Relocation Center”—a euphemism for an internment camp; only Masao,
who (ironically enough) served in the U.S. armed forces, avoided that
fate. In the photo Masao is wearing a military uniform, and the diary refers
to a visit to his post just north of Chicago and also to a speech he gave to
the Convention. Ms. Frankland had taught children!s classes for the
Yamamoto and other kids in California many years earlier.

The auto travelers visited the Yamamoto family on their way home
to California from the Convention, and a photo in the diary of that visit
appears also in the aforementioned Traces that Remain on page 15. The
caption of the photo in Traces states it was taken at a “relocation camp” in

Parlier, a farm town in California!s Central Valley, where the family “were
obliged to live during WWII”, but that information is inaccurate. Parlier was
not the location of such a camp but was about 20 miles (just over 30
kilometers) from an “Assembly Center”—i.e., a detention and staging
facility—in Fresno (and another one a little farther away in Pinedale), from
which Japanese-Americans and Japanese nationals were transported to
camps further inland. The photo was taken while the Yamamotos were
biding time in or near Parlier before being sent on to camp.

According to records produced by the government!s War Relocation
Authority, “Final Accountability Rosters of Evacuees at Relocation Centers
1942-1946”, the Yamamotos were all sent to the Gila River Relocation
Center south of Phoenix, Arizona other than Masao, the serviceman, and
the two oldest sons Hiroshi and Shinji, who were not at Parlier but rather
at the Tanforan Assembly Center near San Francisco, whence they were
sent to the Topaz Relocation Center in Utah. Hiroshi was transferred from
Topaz to Gila River in January 1943, while Shinji—who is listed in records
as married, with a child born in camp—was released from Topaz in
February !44, having found employment in Madison, Wisconsin, where he
lived for the rest of his life. He seems to have been the only one among
the Yamamotos released from camp before war!s end.

The reader should be aware that Margaret Rutledge was a product
of a different age, and so she refers to African-Americans as “colored”
and “Negroes” and mentions matter-of-factly seeing “4 Greyhound buses
full of Japanese going north” who “look very comfortable”—when they
were very likely mostly Japanese-Americans and very likely being sent to
an Assembly Center before being forcibly interned in a Relocation Center,
or camp. She also records her encounter with the Yamamoto family in
California as if it were a picnic in the park, when they had already been
forced out of their home in Berkeley and were soon to be interned in
camp themselves. She was certainly aware of their circumstances but
allows her diary no irony and reflection. She further writes candidly about
places—e.g., “Neb[raska] very dull” (although she liked parts of it)—to an
extent that may hurt some readers! feelings (she also takes shots at a
couple of towns in her native California). That said, Aunt Margaret was a
gentle, sensitive soul, and the editor can confidently say, based on
personal familiarity, that she did not have discriminatory or prejudiced
views of people who were different—in ethnicity or socio-economic status
(or place of residence, for that matter)—from her, and that she would not
knowingly hurt anyoneʼs feelings.

The travel diary itself is in the form of ten pages of single-spaced
typescript placed in an album together with fourteen pages of pho‐
tographs, mailed postcards, and memorabilia of the trip. Most of the
photos of the travelers themselves were taken by Robert Gulick, although
it is uncertain which of the travelers carried cameras. It is not clear
whether Aunt Margaret typed up her account entirely during the trip or
afterward from handwritten notes. (She mentions in one entry doing some
typing.) For this PDF document the diary entries have been retyped by
the editor, with editorial interpolations placed in brackets [ ] and com‐
ments in footnotes. Text in parentheses is Margaretʼs. In the original
account none of the entries have paragraph breaks, but these have been
given by the editor to the longer entries. The title of the diary is
Margaretʼs; the sub-title is the editorʼs.

Some of the photos and most of the other material accompanying the
diary have not been scanned and included herein. The photos that are
included could not be removed from between the original album pages
and covering transparent sheets because they were stuck there, and thus
their scanning was not done under ideal circumstances. Photo-captions in
italics are by the editor.

Aunt Margaret inserted in her album a separate list of daily expenses
en route; these have been incorporated into each daily entry. Also in the
album were two pamphlets from the National Convention: one containing
information for Convention attendees and the other a notice about public
meetings at the House of Worship; these have been included in this
document as two appendices, which begin on page 40 (PDF). The
photograph on the title page of this document was not a part of the diary
but has been included as it shows the diarist formally posed and at
roughly the time (actually several years before) she took the trip.

> Sheridan A. Sims

Addendum: A third appendix was inserted in June 2017 containing
samples of Margaret's poetry, taken from a volume published a few years
before her passing. The poems do not form a part of the travel diary.

Diary of a Cross-country Auto Trip to and
back from the 1942 Bahá’í National Convention

Saturday, April 25 [1942] -- Away after much to-do
and losing of way to El Cerrito, only a half-hour
late. Much high spirits and running about in station
in Sacramento, where Bob [Gulick]’s mother took
train for Paradise.* Snow began about Auburn, in
remnants of great drifts, all melting, mostly dirty
— we found luscious drift and climbed it to take
picture. “Dust devil” shook car all over road near
Truckee. Lake at Norden just thawing out — blue ice
in the midst of snow and whitened trees. Crossed
Nevada line at 1:05 p.m. Reno, Wadsworth, Fernley
(an old white horse there looking sadly at the
river). Nevada hills colored like Siamese cats,
smoke and sand and a blue lake among salt marshes.
Springer’s Hot Springs — pool and cabins, lonely in
the desert. Pastel blue and pink hills, dotted like
Swiss with sagebrush. Ate in Winnemucca where we
gave Temple picture to an army chaplain’s wife and
admired slot machines and punchboards. Battle
Mountain, Elko. Slept there in lovely auto camp;
dared Bob to register as “Brigham Young and wives,
Salt Lake”, which became running gag of trip. Nevada
full of trains, which mooed like mastodons all
night. Bathroom window — an inside window — handy to
living room, very cozy.

Expenses: $1.50 ticket for dinner in Wilmette;
.45 dinner Winnemucca; .04 stamps, etc.; .13 gas,
God knows where.!
* Robert Gulick lived in El Cerrito and his parents in Paradise (the town).
" One dollar in 1942 translates to about 15 dollars in 2015.

Sunday, April 26 -- Gabriel Gulick aroused Nevada
with quotation from Omar [Khayyam] — “Awake! etc.”
Up at 5:30 — gruesome. Ice on windshield of car. Off
to beautiful, glass-fronted cafe for breakfast.
Friendly inebriate offered breakfast to all, waving
$50 bill under startled nose of Ramona [Allen Bray];
also offered to cash check for more. Waitress
without soul discouraged same. Moans. Love at first
fright. The nicest building in Nevada is a reform
school. Beyond Elko, the Ruby Mountains, laced with
snow — exquisite. Welcome, Wells, Wendover Nev.
(very sleepy). Crossed Utah state line at 8:45 a.m.,
lost an hour, so 9:45 a.m. Wendover Ut.: down the
hill to salt flats and refineries. Wide blue
sparkling ditches with white banks, growing into a
flood miles wide. Clear water with mountains
floating in it; horizon impossible to determine.
Cold-colored state, blue and white.

Salt Lake . . . [Mormon] temple towers like
fright-wig standing on end, Moroni in gold on spire,
Tabernacle a secretive tortoise, gold gull statues,
Brigham Young pointing proudly to bank. Clothes in
suitcases clammy with cold. Street arrangements
insane — NW and WN, etc. Bruce Johnson picked us up
and off to friends, as arranged by Bud Lamb*.
Delightful people with sandwiches. Meeting in
rehearsal hall moved to art gallery in basement —
Bob had to walk out on himself. Back to Loomis home
to change clothes, more food, and Mr. Loomis at
piano. Sang ourselves hoarse, left late. Lovely
colored girl, Mrs. Robson, and her mother may come
to Geyserville!. Loomises escorted us out of town
* Artemus Lamb, who later was a pioneer and Counsellor in Latin
America.
" Bahá!í School, in northern California.

and many farewells; week-old assembly has our
complete blessing. Passed by convent: Marzieh
[Gail]’s comment: “Leave ’em lay where Jesus flang
’em!” Over Wyoming state line 6:30 p.m. Rolling
hills, mesas, snow. Evanston, soup in Green River,
night in Rock Springs: shower handily on top of
toilet, no doors just archways. Hilda from
Jugoslavia made us welcome and a drunk set up the
cot for us. Lonely, cold place; air like icy velvet.
Stars like mad.

Expenses: 1.00 lodging Elko; .15 breakfast Elko;
.25 gas Elko; .39 gas Wendover; .25 soup Green
River.

Wyoming. From left, Margaret Rutledge, Marzieh Gail,

Ramona Allen Bray, and Robert Gulick.

Monday, April 27 -- Gabriel plaintively, “It’s five-
thirty!”, cooked breakfast for once — no sugar.
Marzieh and I died. Cold clean air, good in the
lungs, very healthy. Buttes and snow. Discussed
Freud all over Wyoming, violently. Sheep and chuck-
wagons. Rawlins, Bob checked library in Hi School,
as County Library not open, placed “Security for a

Failing World”*; librarian knew G[eorge] Latimer as
boy. Also colored woman who probably went to school
with him was contacted. Washday in Wyoming — they
wear “Longies”. Medicine Bow, snowed last night,
road under construction, muck and mud, no road. Men
wearing helmets over ears, look like Martians. Fresh
snow on passing cars, snow heavy on fences and
bushes — clean cold wind, snow plastered up
telephone poles to the very top. Car got mudbath —
“snow devils” — snow blowing over road. Snow-plow
spit on us after stopping in courtesy — it started
up again too soon. Rock River banked in snow and
abandoned. 7,000 ft. altitude again! Late for lunch
in Laramie because of a blizzard. Where are the
people in these states?

Laramie, civilization again, black and dirty
after white landscapes. Girl gas-station att. in
coveralls got grease on herself, squealed in horror.
Picture of M & M with ice-caked car, snow on lawns.
After talking of hot-dogs for hours, got same at
Mrs. Fadner’s in Laramie, also oranges. All four of
us spoke to about 15 friends she had gathered for
meeting; I am official press-agent for Geyserville,
apparently. Off in a cold wind for Cheyenne. We were
caught with our pants on in Laramie — R. Gulick,
unquote; i.e., no time to change our slacks for
lunch. They offered to keep us all night, as usual.
As fond of Bud Lamb as we are. Sagebrush and sheep.
“Steak! Woolworth’s! Soup! Sinclair!”

Crossed Colorado state line by mistake at 2:40;
map consultation. Buffalo head mounted in state line
store — huge! Back 27 miles to Laramie — (Colo. has
red rocks and trees). Ran off to Woolworth’s for
vital needs but bought earrings, while Bob checked
____________________

Univ. library — they had books, and he talked to a
friendly student. Laramie has parking meters. “Your
Freudian slip is showing!” Off to Cheyenne again.
Car hung up on post over chasm, also station wagon
covered with icicles, stalled off road — in last
night’s blizzard? Snow plows still out and busy.
Waved red scarf at the streamliner “City of S.F.”*
while engineer waved and tooted at us and people
waved in the cars; Bob was sure he saw Vivian Lisoto
and we chased the train for miles, under subways and
over overpasses, round and round and caught it in
Cheyenne. Parked car and ran into station and down
platform like crazy; Vivian was on it and got out
looking dazed; lovely reunion in crowd of amused
people. More parking meters. Restaurant butter
stamped “Buy Defense Bonds” and “Keep ’Em Flying”.
First soldiers since Salt Lake. Separated for
dinner, Marzieh and Ramona snooting at the Plains
Hotel dining room; lovely Spanish leather and Indian
rugs. Met road-hog out of Cheyenne; Calif. license
plates. Nebraska state line 8 p.m. Sidney Neb.,
cabin 19. Talked some to lady in charge, asked if
other Baha’is were there. Nice cabin, but our door
to john wouldn’t open and Bob’s wouldn’t close. Bob
asked for flashlight to explore something — then
yells and furniture falling. We all looked —
horrible faces coming down in sky-light; mirror in
ceiling. Hysterics. Talked all night and took
sleeping pills.

Expenses: .69 lodging Rock Springs; .14

breakfast Rock Springs; .05 coke Rawlings; .15 candy
Colo. state line (mistake); .46 Woolworths Laramie
(turban and earrings); .75 dinner Cheyenne.
* Electromotive train; see here: www.american-rails.com/city-of-san-
francisco.html.

Tuesday, April 28 -- Gabriel shaving at foot of bed
in silence — no privacy nohow — about 4:45 a.m.
Groans and gags. “No spiking” in Neb.; swiped sign
at breakfast. Trains screaming across Wyoming and
Nebraska all day and night. Green country, but looks
like Livermore*. Tried to steal large iron eagle in
Brule, Neb. (found its daddy in Omaha later).
Ogallala — lady in pink night-gown shooing chickens.
California hussies in pants on Main St. Pretended to
hitch ride in our own car and popped eyes of
natives. Tumbleweed in streets and on highways.
Grain elevators and corn-cribs. Lost hour in North
Platte — looks like San Jose. Miles of hay-stacks.
Quiet cattle and sleepy farms, cyclone cellars like
bee-hives. More trains. Chased Challenger! and beat
it by a mile. No paint in Nebraska, little
farmhouses under every tree. Prairie fire — orange
smoke.

Kearney — tree-shaded lanes, college kids in
slacks, left pamphlet with gas station man who had
heard of the Faith from one of his daughters who are
schoolteachers in NY, Ill., Wyo., and Neb. First
clean rest-rooms since Calif. Railroad “jeep” car.
Neb. very dull. Looks too much like Napa Valley
without hills. Grand Island looks like St. Helena
without hills. Chased Challenger again to Central
City, but nobody we knew was on it. WAHOO — took
picture at station, mailed Ed‡ postcard, was
insulted by bums while doing so. They lean on the
mailbox and stare. Venice, population 30, has store
“The Merchant of Venice”. Platte River — bridge to
* Town in northern California. Here and there in the diary Margaret
compares what she sees on the road to what she knows in California.
" Steam locomotive; see here: www.american-rails.com/challenger.html.
‡ Edward Rutledge, Margaret!s eldest brother.

Waterloo is built over islands and 3 channels. Boy’s
Town has a diary farm, huge brick buildings, lovely
grounds; looked very attractive.*

Omaha — great city full of trees, under a cloud.

Rich sections delightful, but downtown looks like
the slums of S.F. Hideous and dirty. Finally found
Doreen Holliday and deputy sheriff husband,
wonderful Baha’i woman and sympathetic though non-
Baha’i [husband] Paul S. Wonderful Lincoln Zephyr —

to one of her brothers, Edward, and was signed by all four travelers. (The front of

the card, probably a photo or illustration, was stuck to the album page.)

went through stop-lights and everything. Took us to
bridge over Missouri River and into Iowa at 6:40
p.m. Council Bluffs other end of bridge. Several
verbal rounds with waitress, changing orders; bread
carted back and forth in hand. Iowa gal well able to
take care of herself — loud voice and all. “We’re
firing the cook, so don’t order the chicken!” People
looking at snow marks on car and at Calif. license
[plate]. Tired and silly as bed-bugs. And on into
Iowa. Nice parks and cemeteries. Rolling country,
patches of different crops close together, rich
earth. Hills and dips, gently rolling. Anita, Iowa —
all it needs is a S. Oakland. Iowa looks like
Concord, Calif. Des Moines snuck up on us. Man gave
us lovely directions two or three times; we kept
coming back.

Wednesday, April 29 -- Cabin with lots of privacy
for a change; Gabriel did not wake us — 7:10 this
a.m.! Des Moines very green and nice. Ate at Hi-Ho,
where girl asked us if we were hitch-hikers or got
Bob from a travel agency. We said we were his wives.
“Woolworth’s!” “Go to Hell!” Censored. Iowa pretty
but dull. Motorists don’t signal at all. Grinnell
little old college town. Middle West all great old
trees and smokey brick. Rich dark earth under spring
plowing. Corn in dried spikes, then more green,
getting hot. Signs: town name or Please Slow Down!
Iowa City — Neb. and Ia. run to brick-paved streets,

very bumpy. Sailors — real ones — studying at
college here. Promised picture of Temple to girl in
stand who had seen it — she had 5 brothers in the
war. Durant, Ia. — noon whistle blew when we were
under it, very loud, scared us silly — fire engine,
air raid, end of world, etc. — we pulled over to
curb in good order automatically, but shaky.

Soldiers with guns on bridge over Mississippi.

Illinois state line 12:30 p.m. More factory whistles
— awful! They don’t blow in Calif. any more — we
can’t take it. Came off bridge into Moline Ill.
Looks like east Oakland with smoke. Man named Dan
Oklock owns tavern there. CCC* camp in full blast
out of Sterling Ill., which is depressing dead town
awarded the Wilted Lily for decrepitude. Clouds of
bugs! They come there every summer — we left. Rock
River country like Russian R[iver] — lovely; but
towns in Ill. all look like Stockton — nyah! Black
Hawk statue 30 ft. high on hill overlooking river —
grey stone over low trees. Very dignified.

Into Wilmette — rich, beautiful suburb with
great gardens and trees — first sight of the Temple,
faint through the branches, the familiar outline
looking very unreal. It has no weight and no
dimensions, like music floating.! Sheridan Road is a
drive to be proud of — we are in good company in
that neighborhood. First person we met, Bud Lamb
coming out of Temple. Located boarding house —
nobody home, so we moved in. Dressed for race unity
dinner in Chicago; pressed for time, Bob wringing
hands in hall. Off to Chicago, looking for Loop;

asked group of men for “Elevent’ St.”, got involved
in half-hour discussion with gestures in any and all
directions. Were we looking for the Detective
Bureau? Chicago huge but looks like Oakland
exaggerated, except the elevated trains that go like
the devil on wheels. Dinner in great ballroom,
crowded — over 300 places. We were late so didn’t
have to wait for the main course. Speeches and
music, as usual. Back to nice bright twin-bed room,
Ramona upstairs, Bob across town. Drug-store people
had World Order* for sale and were quietly amused by
our all knowing each other and falling over each
other in delight. And so to bed, exhausted.

Thursday, April 30 -- Gabriel elsewhere, got up
early anyway. Had to wear civilized clothing.
Devotions in the Temple at 9:00. Trees and
moderately cool wind outside — within, sweat-box,
clothes too heavy. Wilmette full of squirrels. 2
days ago, blizzard — what a change! Hottest April
day in Chicago since the weather bureau started. Met
everybody we ever knew and had no time to write
postcards. Lunch next to a gentleman from Washington
D.C. who looked like Hercule Poirot. Convention well

“Bud” in the diary. (Margaret beyond, on left.) Right, the family of Habib Sabet,
who was “one of Iranʼs major industrialists . . . founded more than 40
corporations and was involved in banking, television, business and industry . . .

her father.                         father of Marguerite Sears.

(Daughter in the middle?)

Kathryn Frankland, renowned teacher of the Faith, and Masao Yamamoto, son
of Kanichi Yamamoto, the first Japanese Baháʼí. Masao was stationed at nearby
Fort Sheridan and spoke at the Convention. As a boy he attended Kathrynʼs
childrenʼs classes. The other 13 members of the Yamamoto family, all in
California, were soon to be sent to internment camps in Arizona and Utah.

Friday, May 1 -- I had lunch at True’s, sitting at
same table as Abdul-Baha used, heard stories of the
old days of the Faith from Dr. Khan and Marzieh’s
mother;* V[irginia] Orbison and Harriet Pettibone
also there. Election in the afternoon. Drove out to
Fort Sheridan with Ramona and George E., Vivian
Lisoto and Bob. Saw Masao Yamamoto, ate in fort
commissary. USO! and very nice, juke box, plants on
table, families and girl friends, etc. Got pass #9
at the gate. Way out, Ramona got a grin and a salute
from an officer — Femme Fatale. Hysterics. Thunder-
storm during Ridwan feast at the Temple. Ramona got
a lift to St. Charles to see relatives, so Vivian
stayed in her place. Marzieh got lost and wandered
in later.

Landlady appeared, proved friendly, Jewish,
voluble, wonderful cook; she made coffee and gave
Vivian and me cookies and conversation until Marzieh
came down and got her ear-plugs.

Expenses: .11 breakfast; .15 milkshake Fort
Sheridan; .50 rosewater Temple; .50 Tahirih book.

Saturday, May 2 -- Long talk with landlady,
sympathetic to Cause. Started Tahirih project.

Tommy said violently: “No! Lah-bah!”

Expenses: .16 breakfast; .26 lunch; .26 dinner.

Sunday, May 3 -- Ali [Yazdi] made wonderful speech
at public meeting!; our landlady came. Laura Allen
made K[athryn] Frankland change her hat, because the
first one bobbled before her eyes and made her
dizzy. Up into Temple after. Bourgeois wanted the
interior finished in mother-of-pearl; two separate
domes with motor-room for dome search-light between.
Floor to be mosaic tile.‡ Off to Evanston in taxi
for dinner, as Bob missing; met Sylvia Ioas¶ in

Planetarium on little peninsula in lake, black

stonewalls, narrow barred windows. Dirty town. By-
passed Bloomington and Lincoln Ill. “Pig-hip”
sandwiches. Gas gets cheaper and cigarettes higher
all the way east. Speaking of language difficulty,
Marzieh: “Ramona can always point at their pocket-

highway. Heard of Illinois cyclone on Saturday night
we just missed, as usual.

Over the father of waters, wide and black, on a
narrow high bridge, into St. Louis Missouri at 8:50
p.m. Looks like Chicago. Lost in several cemeteries
for some time, looking for cabins, drove into
decrepit tourist camp and discovered it was a
brothel. Bored madam quoted us high prices on cabins
to get rid of us; we finally got the drift and
drifted. Then sorry we hadn’t looked the place over

from another cemetery. “See Missouri and die.” St.

Charles — escorted out of town by two tanks on the
highway. Country full of Missouri mules, brown and
white. More tanks on highway. Gently rolling and
green country, as usual, trees and farms. Turtles on
highway. Chick sales everywhere. Columbia Mo. —
Stephens College for Women and Univ. of Missouri.
Picked up old man who gave us directions and took
him downtown. Went to Stephens. Girls dress sloppy
and without sox — old tradition — some riding
breeches. Permission to put books in library. Got
lost out of town and politely asked cow the way back
to the highway: “Pardon us, madame . . .”; she shook
her head at us. Old farm-houses and ancient log
cabins — slave quarters? Sang spirituals all over
Missouri. Occasional sprinkles of rain. Missouri
River big and muddy at Boonville. Blackwater River
flooded almost over road. Ate decrepit candy all
over the state.

Kansas City — smoke and rain. Built on rolling
country. Snooty sphinxes on public building.
Missouri R. again. 4:15 p.m. crossed into Kansas
City Kan. Old towns and more cemeteries. Kansas just
like Missouri: rolling, green, and rain. West into
the sun. Soft warm green country. Topeka Kan. — not
bad. Parking meters. Went to see Mrs. Bertha
Campbell and out to dinner with her. Meeting at
Hotel Jayhawker; headline in Topeka Daily Capital:
“Baha’i Leaders through Topeka Today!” Nice little
crowd. Group of 6 Baha’is, 5 isolated. 27 people,
saw Ramona’s cousin afterward. Hospitality plus.

Expenses: 1.20 lodging St. Louis; .30 cigarettes
St. Louis (Mills); .15 breakfast St. Louis; .51
lunch Columbia; .13 earrings, etc. Columbia.

Wednesday, May 6 -- We hated to leave Topeka.

Beautiful breakfast with R’s cousin. More relatives
in Manhattan with new house we went through. Cavalry
at Fort Riley; we waved and they waved back. Fine-
looking negroes. Jeeps and motorcycles, white and
colored soldiers, all friendly. Junction City, Kan.
— many hoboes on road and hitch-hikers in last 4
states. Stopped for gas at “Deserted town”, asked
horrible old man for coffee; he leered and said
there wasn’t any. Wanted to get rid of us.
Bootlegger? Speculations. Cold wind. After Junction
City, Kansas is flat and dull. Corn looks like
Indian villages. Stately Model-Ts on road. Western
Kansas desolate and bare and brown.

Colorado state line 3:45 p.m. Gained hour at
Oakley Kan. Cheyenne Wells, Colo. — gave Temple
address to man in drug store (John Coane), who went
to meetings years ago in Denver and Washington, to
give librarian in town to inquire about books. First
snow out of Limon, Colo. A mile high, but warm.
Eastern Colorado bare and brown and blah. Pike’s
Peak rising white and gorgeous over a brown plain at
last. Colorado Springs, Colo. nice little town with
Spanish touches. Sailors — why? (This town has
already lost about 2,700 men to the armed forces;
practically no men left until something in the
defense line moved to town.) Clean, well-built
business section. Marzieh and I eloped for dinner in
a jernt; Bob and Ramona went to the hotel for
chicken and have groaned since.

Temerity Ranch — Ramona slept in a Haunted Bed
from Venice. Gold angels and beige lace. We decided
that Byron had slept in it, as he did in every bed
in Venice in his day. We were in a blue room with
thousands of books. Art treasures from all over the
world. Peach linen sheets and silk covers; fur bed-
spreads.

Expenses: 1.00 lodging Topeka; .46 lunch Ellis;
.05 coke Cheyenne Wells; .41 Colorado Springs.

Temerity Ranch, Pine Valley, Colorado. Loulie Albee Mathews (correct spelling),
author of Not Every Sea Hath Pearls, was a volunteer care-giver to wounded
soldiers in France during the First World War, and held meetings for Baháʼís and
seekers at her hotel suite in Paris during her stay in France—at some of which
meetings a young Shoghi Effendi spoke before he proceeded to England to
matriculate at the University of Oxford, and some of which a preteen Marzieh
Gail attended with her family (see her book Arches of the Years). Loulie was a
travel-teacher in Latin America among other places, and established a school for
Baháʼí teachers at Temerity Ranch.

Thursday, May 7 -- Luxurious breakfast with
revolving tray in middle of table. Fine nudes in
bathroom, white woolly rugs. Beautiful sunny weather
— heard of blizzard in Nebraska we would have gone
through coming the other way. Jenny on piano after
lunch. Then to town, Colo. Springs, and shopped all

over for clam-diggers, leg make-up, false eyelashes,
harlequin glasses. Nobody ever heard of them and we
gave up. Went to Garden of the Gods, through
sanitarium grounds where patients live in a series
of bee-hives. Red rock in amazing spires; birds
living in holes in the cliffs. Bought fire opals.
Bob followed us absentmindedly into place he
wouldn’t have been caught dead in. Manitou Springs —
soda water not bad. Will Rogers memorial on hill
looking like misplaced Coit Tower. Back to ranch for
dinner. Got nervous over our talks, but the meeting
was lovely. Beautiful negro girl concert pianist
played Debussy. Friend of Jessie Perry. My hands
shook so I went over and leaned on the table —
always informal. Ovaltine with Lulie and so to bed.

Expenses: .10 lemonade Colorado Springs; 3.37

fire opals Garden of the Gods.

Friday, May 8 -- Lulie hugged us goodbye and off to
town — leg make-up, girdles, slacks, etc. Finally
off for New Mexico; hot as blazes. Pueblo full of
monuments, green with trees. Old, old houses,
Toonerville trolleys*. Arkansas River muddy through
town, green, clear and still in the country beyond.
Then sagebrush desert. Snowy mountains lovely over
dry plain. Passed burned oil truck by side of road.
Rockies tremendous. Spanish Peaks glittering with
snow. Walsenburg, small and usual. Then more
mountains — I’m going to be homesick for western
Colorado; the name of one [mountain] translates in
Arabic as “The Proof of God” — we felt what the name
meant. Over 8,000 ft. high — snow down to road

Fort Garland, Colo., bus stop, Marzieh gave
Message to old Indian, Frank Levato. Bob made cracks
about john, stood self in corner (military training
to improve marksmanship). Farther on, floods over
road. New Mexico line 3 p.m. — cheers! More and more
adobe, old and crumbling. Plaster lions on roof of
gas station at Costilla. Waved at Indians. Dust
devils on desert. Mud huts and Indians. Taos, broken
down, but some beautiful estates (Duane van Vechten
and Mabel Dodge Luhan) with barbed wire, “Keep Out”,
dogs, etc. Looked for D.H. Lawrence’s outhouse
painted with phoenix.!

Out to Taos pueblo on lousy road. Indian
children begged for pennies, adorable. Bob and
Marzieh talked to Indians, Ramona gave a girl her
perfume. Bought tomahawk, from one of the Luhans.
White leather boots, bright dresses. Marzieh gave a
baby a penny and he ran. Indian girl working service

heads, look like Arabs, not Indians. Smart Spanish
boy of 12 (Gilbert Luis De Vargas) picked us up and
showed us Kit Carson’s grave in old deserted
cemetery; second stone, as first one had been
chipped away by tourists. About seven small children
adopted Bob, clinging to his hands; Gilbert said to
him gravely: “You have many friends.” He took us to
the Luhan place, warned us of dogs and showed us a
corner of the famous outhouse, also the Church of
the Penitentes*, warning us again not to go too
close, as his sister had seen their ceremony the
month before. His uncle owned a restaurant in town,
but as he had never eaten there he would not go so
far as to recommend the food. Delightful,
intelligent boy; he wanted Marzieh’s address so he
could write to her. Seemed to take to the Baha’i
ideas. Spanish edition of Spencer Tracy at 12.!

Marzieh told Indians N.M. is like Persia. They
said “Where’s your pueblo?” She said “Thousands of
miles away” and everybody was happy. Rio Grande
gorge like miniature Grand Canyon; river at bottom
not big and but turbulent. Went out on ancient
suspension bridge to look at the current and got
dizzy. Bridge was rushing upstream. Sweet smell of
sagebrush in the air. No plumbing in New Mexico —

Saroyan country.* Sheep-herders’ camp across Rio
Grande. Green Valley, neat farms, adobe. Sunset — a
purple “Spanish moss” formation hanging over red
clouds with gold fringes. Santa Fe, ate in Faith
Cafe — menu solid pepper — Bob put some in Marzieh’s
water and the war was on. Indians selling jewelry
and pottery in the restaurant; friendly, fine-

Saturday, May 9 -- Went to see Dr. Lenore Morris and
her doctor husband who are Baha’is; were plied with
carrot juice. She told us we were first Baha’is to
visit Albuquerque in a year and a half. Full of
plans and have done a lot. She is president of
professional women’s club there, with fine prestige;
two grand people. Went back to service station and
Bob talked to attendant, Spanish boy — Lalo Chavez.
Marzieh tackled lady of Swedish appearance, very
somber, who proved to be of “I AM” extraction, with
gestures. We left. Out into desert; at every
historical marker, Marzieh: “Somebody ate somebody
here, no doubt.” Stopped at Ye Olde Wagon Wheel
(sic!), bought little drum. Hot now, beginnings of
cactus, yucca, etc. Dry and barren. Mesas against
the horizon. Ate at Vaughn, where I was
undercharged, then given too much change! Owner had
broken wrist from putting out drunk and Marzieh gave
his wife a healing prayer; 16 month old baby girl
and littlest thing I ever saw. Out into desert
again; wild flowers by road, blue, yellow and white.

college. We stopped for water at a lonesome gas
station and were greeted by a crazy howling dog who
gave us the creeps. No sign of life, sick fighting
cocks in the yard, forlorn wash on the line. We
started the windmill,* but it was broken; no gas in
the pumps, either. Material for gruesome story.
Finally raised suspicious woman in house — they had
no water either. We had thought somebody was dead
there. 30 coyotes hung on the fence skinned, in
running postures and every stage of decay, down to
skeletons.

Roswell, military institute, uniforms all over
town, nice town, too. We tried to buy Bill a coke,
but Irish and Indian stubbornness beat Bob’s Dutch,
so he bought us one. We took his address; swell kid.
I think he really liked us; we did him. Out of
Roswell, luscious black storm coming up with
streamers of rain in the distance. We had a flat
just as the rain began in huge warm drops. Sheet
lightning and thunder, birds flying low before it,
hot wind, horses in the fields galloping in panic in
all directions, tumbleweeds wild over the desert;
dust-storm in another direction. Bob trying to
change tire, Marzieh and me trying to steady the car
on the jack — it slipped with just me holding it.
Finally got back to Roswell, fixed tire and off
again. Storm short and fierce. We drove after it.
New Mexico full of choice cow-boys ogling us, and
good horses. Followed the Noisy River into Apache

country. Cow eating paper. People with lovely Texas
accents. Mescalero — Apache reservation, met mob of
Apache children, gave girls perfume, all pictures
and pamphlets. We thought they would love Artemus
Lamb. They giggled but listened. Dinner in Tularosa.
Very quiet place, people would not talk to us except
one strangled “Hello girls” at Marzieh and me from a
lonesome little soldier.

On to Alamagordo, where we luxuriated in lovely
bathroom until I happened to catch sight of a man’s
face just disappearing from the window. Not scared
somehow — walked to the door and said loudly to
Ramona and Marzieh, “There’s some guy looking in the
window here. Where did I pack my gun? It’s a good
thing my grandmother taught me how to shoot!” Loud
crash in underbrush as prowler lit off across
country; I wonder if he is still running. Gravel
crunched, a carnival caroused in the next lot, dogs
all over town were barking, plumbing was screaming
and we tried to sleep. Woke up Bob to tell him about
prowler and he was very unconcerned — still asleep.

Sunday, May 10 -- Gulick bearish, town lovely. Sign
on bank steps, “Please don’t sit here.” Adobe and
green trees. Out to White Sands — snowy dunes.
Lovely ranger with shoulders and smile. Rolled like
puppies, slid down dunes, took pictures. Sand pure
white and cool — gypsum. Went back to museum, bought
gypsum horse. Lovely cactus garden in bloom in front

of it. Cactus out on desert looks like lances stuck
in a bull. Cattle guards, metal grills in road —
lovely on tires.

Texas line 11:40 a.m., flowers all over desert.

Brown mountains around green plain. El Paso. Fort
Bliss, veddy formal and uninviting — tent cities all
around. Lots of stone and brick buildings — pretty
town. Soldiers and their girls all over — no
unaccompanied women at all. Mexican border,
confusion. To avoid 4 examinations of all luggage,
had to leave car behind, then the official started
to read this diary, with expression of acute
distaste; begged me to leave it behind. We left all
papers in U.S.* Hot and dusty, and full of tourists;
Mexican men stare like anything. Lost Bob in garage,
ran gauntlet in street, then came back to find him
having his shoes shined! Bob and Marzieh shared a
taco fried in the street; a boy told them it was a
gordita. Gave the women a nickel and got 15 cents in
Mexican change! Had to pay 2 cents toll to walk over
on bridge. Baby chihuahuas in basket on street for
sale. Bull-fight going on, with band playing bad
movie music — bad band, too. “85 cents on sunny
side, $1.35 on shady side.” We didn’t. Went home to
Texas.

Off to Carlsbad Caverns. Brown, bare escarpments
over plain, looking dead. Salt flats. Then beetling
cliffs, with loose rocks threatening. N.M. again.
8:00 p.m. Whites City — bats swooping at dusk out of
caverns, over roofs of auto court, the biggest court
we ever saw, rows and rows over the hill. Frog in
shower, named him Archie, took shower anyway. He
watched. Moths like clouds, one trying to drown
himself in the bowl. Plaintive voice in twilight —

Monday, May 11 -- Up with frog, off for caverns.
Hot, naked country, full of vultures. Caverns
impossibly lovely, walked about 9 miles. Were told
to ask the guides any questions we wanted — all
Marzieh wanted to know was the telephone number of a
cute blond one. I didn’t blame her! Down to lunch,
200 of us, joined those who came in the elevator and
walked some more around the level caverns — double
file, people stretched out for a long way:
procession of damned souls wandering their way to
hell — Dante should have seen us. Rock of Ages —
darkness ceremony: lights out, complete black, then
record of chorus singing to hymn, then chamber by
chamber the lights came up.* Then back to lunchroom
and elevators; we elected to walk out, with about 35
others. Hardy souls. Ramona had decided not to go
down, but stayed and talked to ranger about Faith,
gave him pamphlet — day not wasted. Daylight looked
blue and funny to the rest of us. Hot as blazes
outside.

Off for El Paso over same road; Texas line 4:05

p.m. Long, dull, hot trip; dinner in El Paso with
soldiers and off north. N.M. again ad nauseam. 8:15
* The Rock of Ages is a natural formation within the Big Room, the largest
chamber in Carlsbad Caverns. In those days a “ceremony” was held
which included a light-show to the Christian hymn “Rock of Ages”.

p.m. Las Cruces, very nice. Farewell to the Rio
Grande — flat and quiet here. Deming N.M. —
beautiful auto camp with blue tile bathroom,
cheerful furniture, etc. Washed hair, dispossessing
10 states.

Expenses: .89 lodging Whites City; .26 breakfast
Whites C.; .15 cards and stamps Whites C.; 2.16
Carlsbad Caverns and lunch; .31 gas Whites C.; .35
dinner El Paso.

Tuesday, May 12 -- Out through desert. Tall yucca,
looking like plumes in a bull again. Lordsburg —
mostly a huge Moorish auto camp. Arizona state line
10:00 a.m. We think we will like this state. Duncan
— river and lovely green trees and fields, but
barren, fierce mountains. “Open range — look out for
cattle”. Border station — had to be inspected and
passed.* Saw owls and gila monsters and chipmunks,
bought Indian doll pin there. Safford very nice, had
to be dragged away as usual. Traces of snow on
* “Border station” here apparently refers to an inspection station at or
near the N.M.-Ariz. state line, not the U.S.-Mexico border.

mountains. San Carlos Reservoir huge, long and
green; rough, rolling country with sweet-smelling
sagebrush. First “coat-hanger” trees. Perfect mesas.

Coolidge Dam — ranger asked about cameras, guns,
made us drive slowly over bridge with windows shut;
guard with shotgun in the middle. Arizona hats don’t
blow off — curled brims. Lots of cactus, all kinds.

Margaret and Marzieh posing by a saguaro

cactus in the Sonoran Desert, Arizona.

Globe — fancy auto camps, little frame houses,
people just sitting. Ate in drug store and tried on
all perfumes. Miami very frontier and awful. Wound
up through Superstition Mountains — bare, hot, bad
and threatening with overhanging rocks; we got
really nervous. Just like their name. Mountains
balancing on a hair. Lots of coat-hangers, mostly
black-spotted with blight. Superior — factory with
smoke. Out into hills — landscape unbelievable,

coat-hangers and blooming cactus, rough and savage
hills. Took pictures. Zoo in desert (one of many),
mostly flies. An owl stared at us, we howled with
laughter, rest of zoo rose in uproar. We left with
cactus candy. Mesa Ariz. not bad. Tempe — beautiful
swimming pool making us jealous — much like
California along here. Beautiful 4-lane highway.
Phoenix very civilized. We like Arizona as we had
thought.

Called the Schoenys and were at once taken over
for the duration. Zahrl, 7, welcomed us in gold
satin trunks — his usual costume and very becoming.
Spent the night there; went out to Glendale after
dinner and saw Millie Collins and the friends there;
all 4 of us had to tell of the Convention and our
trip. Caswell Ellis much on hand and getting tall.
Anne Holley there for a week already, with job, and
there to stay.

Expenses: 1.13 lodging Deming; .15 breakfast
Deming; .05 coke border station Ariz.; .35 Indian
pin border station; .56 Woolworths Globe; .35 lunch
Globe; .20 cactus candy and lemonade Arizona desert
somewhere; .20 dinner Phoenix.

Wednesday, May 13 -- Constant drone of bombers night
and day. Scratch marks all over from adorable cat;
rabbit also household pet. Hugged the family goodbye
and away. Beautiful rich, green country; many palm
trees and citrus orchards. Back to rich desert with
yellow-blooming cactus and coat-hangers. Cool and
delightful on desert. Brother Noah’s for lunch —
floor show rather crude: “How did you know we were
from Salt Lake?” Looked like Walter Catlett* — dirty
mind. Into Yuma Desert — real dirt and brush desert.
* Character actor in Hollywood movies.

Yuma, not bad. Baggage inspection at border — took
it all out. 2:10 p.m. California state line. Indian
man and woman in wagon — her hair flowing, very
dark, classic features — longed for picture of her.
First sand desert. Mountains like brown jagged paper
cut out and pasted on the sky — Marzieh’s
description. Dunes in irregular waves. Canals
through the sand. Then Imperial Valley with lush
alfalfa, palms, citrus orchards like Arizona.

Calexico — neat and pretty, but hot. Firemen on
fire-truck racing down street, in shirt-sleeves and
hair blowing in the wind — no hats. Bob got Customs
courtesy at the border and they waved us over, while
we women gawked in admiration at him. Drove around
Mexicali and back; no tourists visible, nice clean
town; walked through a park while the Latin look
followed us. Were waved back over the border without
trouble — we are still staggered at his success and
are almost courteous to him. Trees, wide streets,
good buildings in Mexicali — took the bad taste of
Juarez out of our mouths. El Centro and away.
Incredible ranges of crumpled mountains, 3 deep.
Were held up by road workers hauling away a mountain
on the road, so got out and disrupted their work — I
almost got left there. Looking back on Imperial
Valley from Desert Coyote Mountain — great hazy
vista of rich color; forward, 4 or 5 ranges more out
into haze. Then down into a thick wooded valley,
more trees than we had seen in weeks — dense and
lovely, with great clumps of wild lilacs in bloom.
First fog of trip coming over hill ahead. Ate in
Ramona, and Ramona thought it awful. Tried to find
rooms there, but the dam workers had them all.
Opened door of Gospel Mission to see what the
moaning was about; a women came, and we left in a
hurry. Some very nice automobiles outside it. On to

Escondido, where we found a tourist home, not an
auto camp, and slept like logs.

Expenses: .30 lunch Brother Noah’s Ariz. desert;
.20 malt Yuma; .50 dinner Ramona.

Thursday, May 14 -- Cool morning, but not for long.
Orange groves — blossoms and fruit at the same time.
Valley Center — went to see Vera Scott on ranch in
Indian reservation. Very attractive woman, living
enthusiastic country life, building more house and
doing an incredible amount of work. Cow (Mary One-
horn) and calves, horses and cat, a hen raising a
duckling. Even the fence-posts are growing. House
full of antiques. Vista, Calif., next — orange
groves and geraniums. Oceanside — first view of
Pacific. San Juan Capistrano Mission looked nice, we
didn’t go in, but could see the gardens — town
capitalizing on swallows. Swallow gift shops, etc.
High old crumbling adobe walls, jewel plants and
geraniums. Laguna — lovely and theatrical. Looked
for Alais, were finally informed by police they had
left. Corona del Mar — great lagoon and boats.
Newport Bay. Then forests of oil derricks near Long
Beach — hundreds, rocker arms in motion. (Note: as
all of us speak French, the four of us usually speak
in it because it is so secretive, when we don’t want
each other to understand; Marzieh won a pair of ear-
rings about here.)*
* The meaning of Margaret!s note here is not clear—she might have
partly mistyped it or accidentally left something out. She may be trying to
say that the four travelers sometimes spoke among themselves in French
when they wanted privacy, and tried to stump one another with French
words or expressions the others didn!t know—which would explain
Marzieh Gail winning the earrings: considering her upbringing, it is likely
her French was the most fluent.

Farther on, smell of orange groves delirious.

Ate at Knott’s Berry Place, best meal of trip maybe,
then went through their ghost town and took
pictures; I found some goslings in a pond, and a
museum. Spent 2 hours there. Off through oil wells
again; hot like Hades. Pasadena, saw Charles and
Helen Bishop and their new house, very clean, fresh
and uncluttered. They and Joy Allen and we went out
to dinner, then Ramona and I went to stay with
V[irginia] Orbison in Glendale, Marzieh back with
Bishops, and Bob to his sister’s in L.A. “When will
we 4 meet again?”

Expenses: .94 lodging Escondido; .16 breakfast
Escon.; .27 gas Laguna; .95 lunch Knott’s Berry Farm
Buena Park; .30 dinner Pasadena.

Friday, May 15 -- Slept till 10:30, got up to find
Virginia had left long ago. Breakfast with Julie,
blonde cocker spaniel. Then Ramona went back to bed
with a book and I typed and sorted notes all day.
The lady who was to pick us up had her car
commandeered in the morning and we were stuck. But
we needed the rest. In the evening, the regional
teaching committee met there, and we sat in and
helped. Nothing silent about us!

Expenses: 1.00 lunch Glendale (V. Orbison); .26

cigarettes Glendale.

Saturday, May 16 -- Bob is telling everybody that if
we women had our way and stopped everywhere we
wanted to that the car would be pulling into Chicago
about now! I detect quiet bitterness — or is it
indulgence in a resigned way? Away, not too early.
In Glendale, 4 Greyhound buses full of Japanese
going north. Look very comfortable. Bakersfield —
everything labeled “the world’s finest”. More oil

wells — forests on horizon in 3 directions. More
hitch-hikers than ever. Delano, Earlimart, flat,
straight road forever. Pixley, Tulare — all the
towns look alike. World’s largest peach, apricot and
nectarine orchard, going on for miles. Goshen,
mirage in distant orchards — trees seem to be
floating in clear water.

Parlier, California. Left photo, standing, from left: Ramona Allen Bray, Kanichi
Yamamoto (the first Japanese to become a Baháʼí), Goro Yamamoto, Marzieh
Gail; kneeling, Fumiko Yamamoto, Margaret Rutledge. Michiaki Yamamoto was
accidentally cropped out of the original photo, but is partly visible in the right
photo with his sister and brother. The Yamamotos were soon to be sent to an
internment camp at the Gila River Indian Reservation in Arizona, where they
were confined for the duration of WWII. (The two eldest brothers, Hiroshi and
Shinji, were not at Parlier and were sent to a camp in Utah; the third eldest,
Masao, was serving in the armed forces.)

Parlier, looking for Yamamotos. 17 sets of
directions, finally got there. All growing up, 2

little girls darling. 5 puppies crawling all over
me, to my delight — sat in the dirt with clean
slacks, just to get them all in my lap. Then went
out to farm where Fumiko, Gorro and Mitchiaki work,
to see them, taking their father with us. The
irrigating water gave out temporarily, just in time
for them to have a visit with us; we took pictures
of them. They gave us a crate of asparagus and
refused to be paid for it. Fumi darling in jeans and
hickory shirt; getting calluses now, but thought
she’s die of the hard work at first. We got
ambitious and pulled a few weeds, too, just for fun.

Then into Fresno, where we got even with the
hospitable family by sending them a large box of
candy. Lots of soldiers, and me with the hiccups.
Over San Joaquin River — Madera, Chowchilla, Merced,
Turlock, Modesto, Manteca, Tracy, Livermore —
Oakland. But we can’t believe it is all over. Will
our compulsions get us up in the morning to go on? I
could stood it.

Expenses: .26 lunch Earlimart; .26 snack Fresno;
.70 candy for Yamamotos Fresno; .20 chili Livermore.
$19.21 payment for gas on credit card to Bob.

The Saga of Simon — Chorus
> Twenty-one nights on an auto-camp floor,
> We’d like to go back there and do it some more;
> Gulick and Rutledge and Gail and Bray,
> We’d like to be out on the road to stay.*
* These last lines are handwritten. In a postcard sent to her parents
during the trip, Margaret kiddingly refers to fellow-traveler Robert Gulick
as “Simon Legree”, the name of the slave-abusing villain of Uncle Tomʼs
Cabin; this might explain the title of the closing ditty. Given Margaret!s
fondness for music and literature, there may be other cultural references
at play (e.g., possibly a Broadway show). The travel diary ends here.

Appendix 1

Following is an information pamphlet distributed to the 1942 Bahá!í
National Convention attendees. It was included with the diary. The
pamphlet is folded in quarters, and thus has eight panels. The original
pamphlet measures about 4.25 x 5.5 in. (about 11 x 14 cm). Immediately
below is the scanned original front panel.

The second (left) and third (right) panels of the pamphlet. Unfortunately,
the scanned image did not fully fit onto this PDF page with the tools
immediately available to the editor, and so the third panel has been typed
in full below.

LUNCHROOM IN TEMPLE: Lunches will be served
immediately after the morning session every day,
Thursday thru Sunday. Cost, 25¢. Hot dinners will be
served Thursday and Saturday evenings, following the
afternoon session. Cost, 65¢.
IMPORTANT: Those wishing dinner should register at
the Information Bureau as soon as possible.
TEMPLE TOURS: Friday, 1:15 to 1:45 PM. Assemble
promptly in Reception Room at Information Bureau and
ask for Guides who will be provided.

(See inside)
Panels 4 through 7, i.e., the unfolding inside of the pamphlet. The image
has been divided over two PDF pages; just below is the upper half or so.

> Bottom half or so of the inside of the pamphlet.
The back panel and a slice of the front.

Appendix 2

Following is an information pamphlet on public meetings at the House of
Worship. It was included with the diary. Like the above pamphlet it is
folded in quarters, with eight panels, and its original size about 4.25 x 5.5
in. (11 x 14 cm). The second and back panels both have quotations from
the Writings, but the back is stuck to the album and its verses cannot be
read; the unfolding inside panels (4, 5, 6, 7) are blank. Immediately below
is the scanned original front panel.

The second panel. Unfortunately it did not scan well and cannot be read
clearly even when enlarged. Its content has been typed by the editor and
appears on the next page.

Excerpts From the

BAHA’I WRITINGS

“The world is one country, and mankind its
citizens.”

* * *
“The lovers of mankind, these are the superior men,
of whatever nation, creed or color they may be.”

* * *
“The religion of God is One Religion, and all the
prophets have taught it, but it is a living and
growing thing, not lifeless and unchanging.”

* * *
“That which the Lord hath ordained as the sovereign
remedy and the mightiest instrument for the healing
of all the world is the union of all its peoples in
one universal Cause, one common Faith.”

* * *
“The real treasury of man is knowledge. Knowledge is
the means of honor, prosperity, joy, gladness,
happiness and exultation.” “Universal education is a
universal law.” “To acquire education is encumbent
on all.”
“The gift of God to this enlightened age is the
knowledge of the oneness of mankind and the
fundamental oneness of religion . . . It is the hour
of unity of the sons of men and the drawing together
of all races and classes . . . For universality is
of God and all limitations are earthly.”

The third panel, which, like the second, cannot be read clearly. Its content
has been typed and appears on the next page.

Appendix 3

Following are five of Margaretʼs poems, taken from Quintet in concert:
anthology of Monterey Peninsula poets, published in 1993 in Pacific
Grove, California, U.S.A. by Whys World Publications (now defunct).

> SONNET FOR CAPTIVITY
> Dote not on eyes and lips and voices sweet
> With youth to still the dreams in musicʼs grove --
> Dote not on flesh that all perfections move --
> On the most tender hands, devoted feet
> That ever an imperfect pathway beat.
> Old idol-worshippers have built this love
> Whose senses cry the atomʼs touch to prove
> The nearest thing to spirit mortals meet.
> Passion will die, poor heart, for all your tears
> And white hands turn to claws -- why say again
> What whispers through the purest songs of men
> And makes them sing the louder for their fears?
> O Soul! In this your folly takes its prize --
> Seeking immortal love in human eyes!

> SLAP
> Find your little place again
> And stay where you belong --
> Kings who ruled in Ithaca
> Are slaves in Babylon!

> THE DOVE COMES BACK
> Upon the tense warped deck of faith I stand,
> My eager eyes still straining for a sign
> Of the white prayer I loosed with trembling hand --
> Lord! Is that flying spray, or wings that shine?
EVOLUTION
Did a small sea-dwelling creature
One morning say to himself
“I will climb out on this rock
And stretch my legs”?
How did he know he had legs,
Mutated by patient ancestors?
How did he guess that his gills
Might be changed to breathe air?
And how could he trust there was air?
What terminal courage
Must help a small form
Lift to another world?
What infinite nosiness
Have we inherited?

PHOENIX
Out of the crucible, the fiery bird
Spreads its new-burning wings to a new sun
Lord, in the dazzling terror of Thy Word
Help man to do as this his dream has done!
Our wings are beating in the worldʼs mean dust,
Our plumage draggles from the claws of fear --
Oh, Merciful, more kind than Thou art just,
Thy purifying Flame again sings near!
Out of the crucible, the soul unblurred,
The love unselfed, the purpose turned a sun --
Lord, in the glorious terror of Thy Word
Help man to know Thy Will! Thy Will be done!
