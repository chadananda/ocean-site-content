Introduction

Do you know what a Holy Day is? It is when something very special
happens, something that comes from God. Adam, Moses, Jesus,
Mu}:lammad, the Rib and Baha'u'llah came from God and when
They were born Their birthdays became Holy Days and remem-
bered by people who loved Them. When something very important
happens in the lifetime of a Messenger of God then that Day
becomes a Holy Day too.

The Baha'is have nine Holy Days which are especially important
and on these nine Days work is forbidden. Some of the Days are
happy, like when we remember the time Baha'u'llah was born, and
others are sad, like when the Bab was killed.

The first Day I would like to tell you about is different from the
rest: It is called Naw-Ruz which means New Year.

was new. It was Naw-Ruz, the first day of the New Year and the             good, called the Bab, Whom God had sent to the world to make

trousers! New shoes! He had never had shoes before and he sang as
he hurriedly pulled on his cloth es and ran out into th e sunlit gar-
den. Everything looked new. The sky was d eep blu e, and trees rich
green, the flowers bright reds and blues and yellows. Everything
sparkled and gleamed. Even the house. His mother and sisters had
scrubbed and swept the inside until everything was spotless, and his
father and older brothers had painted the outside a brilliant white.
The cool, clear pool in the middle of the garden was like a mirror
which reflected the world , and as Al)mad looked into the water he
thanked God for giving him such a beautiful world to live in.

Al)mad did not want to miss one minute of this first day of Spring
and quickly ate his breakfast of milk, bread and cheese before run-
ning outside again. Usually in Persia, which is where Al)mad lived,
when it was Naw-Ruz everyone visited each other, gave gifts of
food, held parties and had a very happy time. That was quite a long
time ago, but people still do the same things today, for Naw-Ruz is
a very happy and very special day.

were a few friends with him on that Day who knew about God's
New Message. Later they travelled all over Persia telling everyone
about it and when Al)mad heard he was very happy and knew that
God had answered his prayer.
There is something very special about the Baha'i Naw-Ruz. We

Birth of the Bah
remember about everything being new on that Day and we remem-
ber something else. The Bab said that God had chosen every Naw-
Ruz as His Very Own Day. That Naw-Ruz when Al)mad was a                                20th OCTOBER 1819

Ruz is God's Day. And it is one of the happiest Days of the year.    Long, long ago, when there were no cars or aeroplanes or television ,

One Messenger of Go<;l was born in India and He was called

And the people did not forget this Promise bu t told their children,

In another land called Arabia, Mu}:lammad was born. God sent
Him to tell the people an important message how a whole country
could live together without fighting and how we must always be fair
to each other. Mu}:lammad too gave that same Promise from God,
that something especially wonderful would happen one day, and
He told of two Great Ones Who were to come.

There were other Messengers of God Who came to other parts of
the world and they all gave the same Promise.

Now everyone knew about the Promise and was waiting to see
what would happen. Then one day about a hundred and fifty years
ago, some of them became very excited because they felt that the
long-awaited Day was very, very near.

Strange things began to happen. One day countless meteors
began shooting across the sky looking just like brightly-coloured
snowflakes. Some people were frightened, but others knew it was a
sign from God. Men began to discover things they had never under-
stood before- like how to send messages through the air from one
town to another.

In America some people sold their houses and went up on top of
a high hill because they though t the Great One promised by God
would come down out of the sky.

In Germany people left their homes and sailed to Haifa because
they knew that that was where they would find the Promised One.

In Persia many people began to search, travelling throughout the
land asking questions and praying to God to guide them.

There were two holy men in Persia who were like stars to the          night long nightingales sing. Many poems have been written about
other people. A star shines at night and lights up the sky and this is    Shiraz and the people who live there are happy and friendly.

Th e teach er took the Ba b back to His uncl e a nd told him to take
great care of Him for His knowledge came from God and was like
the knowledge of the Promised One. At first His uncle did not
understand and thought the Bab had been naughty at school by
talking too much, but he soon realised how very special His nephew

was.

Everyone who met the Bab marvelled at the wise things He said
and loved Him because He was always very fair, kind and gentle.

Part of the wonderful Promise of God had come true with the
Coming of the Bab, and the rest of that Promise came true with
the Coming of Baha'u'llah. And that is another story.                    Once upon a time, about a hundred and fifty years ago, two holy

"I am the Lamp                                            God had given these two holy men to do.

For forty years Shaykh Al)mad made the hearts of the people
which the Finger of God                                 ready, and after him Siyyid Ka?im carried on this important work.

When the forty days were over Mulla I:Iusayn travelled' to a town      which even Siyyid Ka~im r.ad not been able to explain. Siyyid

town of Shiniz woke up. They awoke to a new day which was the
beginning of the exciting story of the Bab and His followers.

Eighteen pure-hearted people found the Bab without anyone
telling them where He was. And after those first eighteen, thousands
more came to love and obey Him.

Martyrdom of the Bab
The Bab told of another Messenger of God Who would soon
come-One Whose Teachings would be even greater and more
wonderful than His. The name "Bab" m eans the Gate through
which we pass to the beautiful garden of the Teachings of
Baha'u'llah.

> I:Jusayn had loved Mu}:lammad very much and was very close to
God, but the people had not understood how great he was, and so

they killed him. As the secretary read the sad story the tears poured
down the face of the Bab and He knew that before long th e same
thing would happen to Him.

One d ay th e Bab was taken to a nearby town call d T a briz.
Th er th importa nt people of th e town asked Him : " Wh o 10 YO Ii

claim to be? " The Bab answered: "I am , I am, I am the Promised
One." Although they were waiting for the Promised One to come,
for Mu}:lammad had told them He would, they did not want to
believe it and sent Him back to the prison in the mountains.

In Tabriz was another prisoner. He was a boy called Anis. He
dearly loved the Bab and wished to be with Him, but his step-father
thought he had gone mad and locked him up in a room of the
house. Anis wept bitterly and could not be calmed. He began to
pray and the Bab came to him in a dream, smiling into his eyes and
saying that He had chosen Anis to be with Him when He was
martyred. To be martyred is a wonderful thing- it means to be
killed because you believe in God and in the next world you are
more happy than you have ever been in your life. When he heard
this Anis was filled with joy and peace and did not cry any more.

Before long an order came from the government saying that
the Bab (and anyone who believed in Him) was to be killed. He
was again taken from His prison and brought to Tabriz. As He was
being led through the crowded streets a young, bare-footed
boy rushed forward and fell at His feet. It was Anis. He too was
taken prisoner and with three others was locked in a cell with the
Bab.

That night the Bab was very happy. He knew that before long
He would be in Heaven, which is so wonderful that we call it the            nothing on earth could stop Him finishing What He wanted to say

After many years the Bab was buried on Mount Carmel. One            Mul).ammad. These Holy Messengers of God also gave a promise-

Some people know when a Messenger of God is born even with-

this story is about Baha'u'llah.
The Bdb                                In the land of Persia was a rich king who lived in a fin e palace.

Early one morning, on 12lh Nov mber rU 17, a I)a l) y l)(lY was
born to this good man and his wife.

At that very moment, in another part of Persia, a man all 'd

At the same time Shaykh A}:lmad was in the town of Tihran
~    where Baha'u'llah was born. Shaykh A}:lmad was a holy man sent

\[1\] Baha'u 'llah's father asked a wise man to tell him the meaning of
this dream and he was told that the sea was this world and
Baha'u'llah would become like a King of the whole world, loved

and obeyed by all people, even though at first many would try to
stop Him.

As Baha' u'llah grew older it was plain for everyone to see that H e
kn ew things no one else knew. He did not go to school but under-
slood more tha n any teacher. H e was very clever and wise. One day

And so Baha' u'llah quietly grew up, only a very few people
knowing that He was the Glory of God on earth, until the day came
when it was time for everyone to know.

Ridvan

•

2nd MAY 1863

Baha'u'llah was sent away from Baghdad a prisoner, yet people
were treating Him as though He were a King! And of course He
was- the King of the whole world . But those who were sending
Him away did not know that- they did not understand how won-
derful Baha'u'llah was and that God had sent Him to make the
world a good and happy place to live in.

Most people in Bag!!dad did not want Baha'u'llah to go, and
many cried that day . When Baha'u'llah left the Garden of Ri<;lvan
they gave Him a beautiful horse to ride on, and people crowded
round holding on to the stirrups and even kissing the horse's hoofs.
Many threw themselves down in front of the horse and did not
mind if they were hurt. They just could not bear the thought of
Baha'u'llah leaving them. Even the governor of the town, who had
been ordered to send Baha'u'llah away, was sorry and did not really
want to do it.

As Baha'u'll;ih with His Family and twenty-six of the Baha'is
travelled along, people came out of their houses to greet them,
waving banners and beating drums, and led the way through the
towns where men , women and children crowded on to roof-tops and
into streets waiting to see Baha'u'llah and His followers.

For one hundred and ten days they travelled through meadows,
woods and valleys, then across the sea to Constantinople.

Baha'u'llah had first told the friends that He was the Promised
One while He was in the Garden of Ri<;lvan, and it was while He
was in Constantinople that He first told a king. This was the king of"
Turkey to whose country Baha'u'llah had now been sent. This kin g
was not good, for he did many things th at were ruel a nd unfair.

After only four months this king sent Baha'u'llah away from
Constantinople. It was a morning in December, and the people
wept as they waved goodbye to the Holy Family setting out on
donkeys and in wagons on such a cold journey. Many animals had
died because of the cold, and when the Holy Family wanted water

to drink they had to light fires to melt the ice.

After twelve days they arrived in another town, which was called
Adrianople. It was here that Baha'u'llah wrote to all the kings of

of BahftJuJlldh
the world telling them about the wonderful new Message from God.
But they did not want to listen, so God punished them by taking
away their power, and nobody took any notice of them any more.

After this the story of Baha'u 'llah became very sad again, for He
was put in prison for many years. However, during the Twelve             When Baha'u'llah was in the Garden of Ri<;lvan in Ba~dad the

It was in this prison that the dearly ·loved youngest son of
B ahrP u) llah                     Baha'u 'llah died.

And yet this prison Baha'u'llah called "the Heaven of Heavens",

found himself bowing down as the Power of God shone from
Baha'u'llah.

A few days before He passed away from this world Baha'u'llah
asked His family and all the believers to come to His room and He
lovingly told them: "I am well pleased with you all." They had
suffered very much because they loved Baha'u'llah, for they had
been shut in cold prisons and been made fun of by the townspeople.
But they did not mind these things happening to them as long as

In 1908, after being a prisoner for forty years, Abdu 1- a a
was freed. One of the first things He did was to place the holy Body
of the Bab m a Shrine which He had built on Mount Carmel,

pray, bUl 'Abdu ' I-Baha was unabl l g . Afl rwards, wi ' 11 th e
fri nds r turn ed , they said how mu h H had been mis d a nd
'Abdu'l-Ba ha said: " But I was there, though my body wa abs nl,
my spirit was there." Even though we cannot see 'Abdu'l-Baha, we
know that H e is with us all the time.

That night two of 'Abdu'l-Baha's daughters stayed up to be with
Him . H e seemed quite well and very peaceful. But 'Abdu'l-Baha
had left this world and His Soul was with the Bab and Baha'u'llah
in the Abha Kingdom.

The coffin of 'Abdu'l-Baha was lovingly carried up the mountain
and laid to rest in the Shrine of the Bab, in a room next to the Holy
Tomb of the Manifestation of God .

Ten thousand people came to the Funeral and they wept because
'Abdu'l-Baha was no longer with them. Important people from the
government, the mayor and religious leaders, all came to say how
much they loved and respected 'Abdu'l-Baha. The boy-scouts came
and other children; the poor people came and the rich. Everyone
felt they had lost their Friend because 'Abdu'l-Baha had always
been there to help them, and they felt they had lost their Father
because H e had looked after them all.

But the world had not really lost 'Abdu'l-Baha because He had
told the Baha'is that His spirit would always be with them even
when His body was not. And when He left this world H e gave us a
beau tiful gift.

This gift was His Grandson Shoghi Effendi, whom 'Abdu'l-Baha
said was the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, and whatever the
Guardian told us to do was what God wanted us to do as well.

When the beloved Guardian died, the Universal House of Justice
was elected to look after us all. Baha'u'llah wrote a bout the
Universal House of Justice, 'Abdu'l-Baha explained how important
it is for us to obey it, and the Guardian worked all of his life so that
there were enough Baha'is in enough countries to elect it. Every fiv e
years the Baha'is of the world vote for nine men to be members of
the Universal House of Justice, and God guid es them so that they
can always tell us the right thing to do.

When we think how much 'Abdu'l-Baha gave us, how He helped
> us to understand the Teachings of Baha' u'llah, how H e showed us
> how to be true Baha'is and how H e made sure we were looked after
when H e left this world , we want so much to do something for Him .
And there is something. H e told us what we could do to mak Him
v ry happy:

...
" How my heart leaps with j oy when I hear the friends love each
other, always overlooking one another's small mistakes; and that
they are forgiving their enemies!"

(( Henceforward we shall

always be together) heart and
soul and spirit) pressing forward

in the work till all men
are gathered together under

the tent of the Kingdom) singing
the songs of peace.))

(Abdu) l-Bahd
