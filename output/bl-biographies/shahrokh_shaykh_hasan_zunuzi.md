> 'I
> The morning light had just broken when I found myself walking with him
through the streets of Karbila. We soon reached a house, at the door of which
stood a Youth, as if expectant to receive us. He wore a green turban and
His countenance revealed an expression of humility and kindliness which I
can never describe. He quietly approached us, extended His arms toward Siyyid
Kazim and lovingly embraced him. Speechless, with bowed head, Siyyid Kazim
received the many expressions of affection and esteem with which that Youth
greeted him. We were soon led by Him to the upper floor of that house, and
entered a chamber bedecked with flowers and redolent of the loftiest perfume.
He bade us to be seated. We knew not, however, what seats we actually
occupied, so overpowering was the sense of delight which seized us. We
observed a silver cup which had been placed in the center of the room, which
our youthful Host, soon after we were seated, filled to overflowing and handed
to Siyyid Kazim, saying this verse from the Qur'an, 'A drink of pure beverage
shall their Lord give them.'    Siyyid Kazim held the cup with both hands and
drank it. A feeling of reverent joy filled his being which he could not
suppress. I, too, was presented with a cupful of that beverage, though no
words were addressed to me. The above verse from the Qur'an was the only
thing spoken in that memorable gathering. Soon after, the Host arose and
accompanied us to the threshold of the house, and bade us farewell.

The -   - goes on to relate, "I was mute with wonder about His charm, His
bearing and His dignity. How great was my amazement when I saw my teacher
without any hesitation drink from that silver cup     ..."   We should realize
that in Islam, use of silver and gold utensils is forbidden.          The -   -
continues, "I could not explain the motive which could have induced the Siyyid
to manifest such profound reverence in the presence of that Youth which the
holiest shrine had failed to excite."

To make the rest of -   - Hasan's story better appreciated, you wish to
know that in the spring of 1841, about three years before His Declaration,
the Bab visited Karbila.    --

(The Bab, Balyuzi, p.41)

The &ay&    continues, "Three days later I saw that same Youth arrive and
take a seat in the midst of the company of the assembled disciples of Siyyid
Kazim. He sat close to the entrance and with modesty and dignity of bearing

listened         to    the     d i s c o u r s e of S i y y i d Kazim.     A s soon as S i y y i d ' s e y e s f e l l
upon t h a t Youth he d i s c o n t i n u e d h i s a d d r e s s and h e l d h i s peace.                    When one
of h i s d i s c i p l e s begged him t o resume what h e had l e f t u n f i n i s h e d , t h e t e a c h e r
replied,         'What more s h a l l I s a y ,       '    and a s he t u r n e d h i s f a c e towards t h e Bab,
he s a i d ,     'The t r u t h i s more m a n i f e s t t h a n t h e r a y of l i g h t t h a t h a s f a l l e n
upon t h a t l a p ! '     I immediately observed t h a t t h e r a y which t h e S i y y i d r e f e r r e d
t o had        f a l l e n on t h e l a p of t h e same Youth whom w e had r e c e n t l y v i s i t e d .
The d i s c i p l e asked f u r t h e r ,       'Why is i t t h a t you n e i t h e r r e v e a l H i s name nor
i d e n t i f y H i s person?'          To t h i s , S i y y i d r e p l i e d by p o i n t i n g w i t h h i s f i n g e r
t o h i s own t h r o a t , implying t h a t were he t o d i v u l g e H i s name, t h e y b o t h would
be p u t t o d e a t h i n s t a n t l y . I saw t h e S i y y i d a c t u a l l y p o i n t o u t w i t h h i s f i n g e r
t h e r a y of l i g h t on t h e l a p of                t h e Bab, and y e t none among u s apprehended
i t s meaning."

"I, f o r m y s e l f , became convinced t h a t t h e S i y y i d h i m s e l f c o u l d never be t h e
Promised One, b u t t h e mystery s u r r o u n d i n g t h a t Youth k e p t me perplexed and
anxious.         S e v e r a l times I v e n t u r e d       t o approach S i y y i d Kazim and s e e k from
him e l u c i d a t i o n of     t h i s mystery,           b u t e v e r y t i m e I approached him,              I was
overcome by a s e n s e of                awe which h i s p e r s o n a l i t y s o p o w e r f u l l y i n s p i r e d .
I watched t h e Youth s e v e r a l times as He s t o o d i n a t t i t u d e of p r a y e r a t t h e

w a s t h a t He w a s a merchant from a i r a z , and d i d n o t belong t o any of t h e
e c c l e s i a s t i c a l orders.     The memory of            t h a t Youth haunted m e u n t i l t h e day
when t h e c a l l of a Youth from -

S h i r a z p r o c l a i m i n g Himself t o be t h e Bab reached
my e a r s . "

According t o t h i s s t o r y i t a p p e a r s t h a t t h e Bab's m i s s i o n was a p p a r e n t t o
Himself and t o S i y y i d Kazim t h r e e years b e f o r e H i s D e c l a r a t i o n . It i s c o n t r a r y
t o a c o n c e p t t h a t a Messenger of God is a n o r d i n a r y person and suddenly God
bestows upon H i m a s p e c i a l m i s s i o n .

It is very probable that Mulla        Ali-i-Bastami, the fourth Letter of the
Living, who was appointed by the Bab to go to Iraq, was the first one to
break the news of the appearance of the Bab in Karbila, where a a y k Hasan
was living.     You might recall his name from the story about     Abdu'l-Vahhab,
the   glorious youth   from a i r a z , in   the talk entitled   "The Mystery   of
Martyrdom. l1

The -   - states, "When I heard that a Youth from a i r a z has claimed to
be the Bab, the thought instantly flashed through my mind that such a person
could be none other than the same Youth whom I had seen in Karbila." He
continues, "When later on I journeyed from Karbila to -

Shiraz, I found that
He had left for a pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. I met Him on His return
and endeavoured to remain in contact with Him."

During that period of more than a year which the Bab spent under house arrest,
-   - Hasan remained in -Shiraz until the Bab instructed His followers to
go to Isfahan. No doubt he witnessed how the blessed Imam Jum'ih, or chief
clergy, nullified the death sentence on the Bab which was signed by the
high-ranking clergy of -

Shiraz.

The -   - was there in -

Shaykh             Shiraz at the time of the conversion of Siyyid
Yahya-i-Darabi, later called Vahid by the Bab. As you recall, the king chose
Vahid because of his vast learning and sent him to Shiraz to investigate
the claim of the Bab; and, if possible, to subdue Him. What happened during
those three investigative meetings is as awesome today as was a century and
half ago.

To bring you up-to-date with history, the hostility of the prime minister
and the governor of a i r a z , deepened by the conversion of Vahid, increased
by the hour. The Bab, knowing the future, changed the title of His house
to the name of His mother and wife, and told His followers to proceed to
Isfahan. Therefore, the g a y m was no longer in E i r a z when the plot to kill
the Bab was averted by a sudden outbreak of deadly cholera. Because the Bab
healed the son of the chief police, He was not killed but expelled from a i r a z
and made to go to Isfahan. As you recall, He was not allowed time for a final
farewell to His mother and wife.     The final embrace with His guardian, Uncle

Ali,     was both h e a r t b r e a k i n g        and r e v e a l i n g .    The 27-year-old            Bab t o l d H i s
uncle      who     had     raised       Him     from        childhood,        "I w i l l see you a g a i n i n t h e
mountains of           A&irbayjan            when I w i l l send you t o t h e f i e l d of martyrdom,
and soon a f t e r , I w i l l j o i n you i n t h e Realm above." What a f o r e c a s t !

- Hasan, w h i l e r e s i d i n g i n I s f a h a n , w a s a w a i t i n g t o see what drama would
follow.      The Bab was w e l l - r e c e i v e d          by t h e governor of I s f a h a n , and f o r f o r t y
days was t h e honored g u e s t a t t h e home of t h e Imam Jumih, t h e c h i e f c l e r g y .
But     when     the     other      clergy f e l t the threat                  t o their       position,        the death

Nahri, who had two sons, ages 9 and 11. Many years later, as believers in
Baha'u'llah, the two sons were martyred and the titles of the King of Martyrs
and the Beloved of Martyrs were bestowed upon them by Baha'u'llah. The host,
Mulla Ibrahim, had a brother who was married, but childless.

While the Bab was eating dinner, the host, being close to Him, mentioned
the longing of his brother and sister-in-law to have a child. The Bab
responded to such a hope for intercession by putting a portion of food which
was on His plate onto another plate. Handing it to the host, He said, "Ask
your brother and his wife both to eat the food and their wish will be
fulfilled." Soon a baby was conceived, and at birth she was called Fatimih.
Twenty-six years later she became the wife of Abdu'l-Baha with the title
of Munirih -

Khanum. (Dawnbreakers, p. 208)

After the death of the governor, his mean and evil nephew became governor.
This nephew, against the written will of the governor, appropriated his
property which had been willed to the Bab, and reported the whereabouts of
the Bab to the king. The king ordered the transfer of the Bab, under disguise
and escorted by armed guards, to Tehran, where the king was eagerly hoping

-
to meet Him. Prior to the death of Manuchihr    -

Khan, the Bab had given His
writings to the three chosen followers to transcribe and later advised them
to tell all followers to go north to the cities of Kakan, Qum,and Tehran.
An interesting event occurred in the city of Kaaan which is beyond the scope
of this talk, but is mentioned in the history of the Bab.

--
(The Bab, Balyuzi, p. 116)

A week after Naw-Ruz of 1848, the Bab reached the fortress of Kinar-Gird
only 28 miles from Tehran. But the crafty and hostile prime minister, afraid
of   losing his position, prevented such a meeting with the king. Upon order
of    the prime minister, the Bab was taken to the prime minister's village
of   Kulayn. He stayed there for 20 days before the order came for His transfer
to   the fortress of Mah-ku.

S h a y B Hasan and three other followers who were on their   way going to Tehran
joined the Bab in Kulayn to care for Him. Also from Tehran came two other
Babis, one of whom brought a letter and presents from Baha'u'llah which gave

the Bab extreme joy.      During these three weeks, a remarkable incident
occurred to which Eay@   Hasan was a witness. The story was related to Nabil,
the historian, by Abdu'l-Karim, one of the four followers who had come to
attend the Bab.

Abdu'l-Karim states, "My companions and I were fast asleep in the vicinity
of the tent of the Bab when the trampling of horsemen suddenly awakened us.
We were soon informed that the tent of the Bab was vacant and that those
who had gone out to search for Him had failed to find Him. We heard the chief
of the guards scolding the guards, saying, 'Why are you disturbed? Isn't
His nobleness of soul sufficiently established in your eyes to convince you
that He will never for the sake of His own safety consent to involve others
in embarrassment.' To assure his men, the chief led his men on the road
towards Tehran. The followers also went along when, all of a sudden, by the
dim light of the early dawn, we saw in the distance the lonely figure of
the Bab. He was coming towards us from the direction of Tehran.    These were
His words addressed to the chief guard, 'Did you believe Me to have escaped?'
The chief answered, 'Far be it from me!   '   as he flung himself at the feet
of the Bab. To everyone, a look of confidence and serene majesty sat upon
the Bab's face, but no one dared to ask what had occurred."
Some of us may wonder if the Bab, being so close to Tehran where Baha'u'llah
resided, was visited by Him; however, Abdu'l-Baha has clearly stated that
the two never physically met. This does not rule out a spiritual meeting.

Let us go back three years about another spiritual meeting. When in -

Shiraz,
Quddus, the last Letter of the Living, by seeing        the back of the Bab,
recognized Him as the Promised One, to the perplexity of Mulla Husayn who
was not allowed to reveal the Bab's identity.       When the Bab was informed
about this, He said, "In the world of spirit, We have met."

Now a letter arrived from the king that the time was not right for a meeting,
and that the Bab should be taken to the prison fortress of Mah-ku in the
mountains of Agirbayjan. The prime minister had succeeded in his evil
machinations, but in a couple of years he lost his fortune, fame, was expelled
from Tehran, and died miserably in Karbila.       In the prison, the Bab was
allowed only two companions.   He chose two brothers who were of His lineage,

meaning Siyyids. One of the brothers, Siyyid Husayn from Yazd, was a Letter
of the Living.

Shayk Hasan was heartbroken when he saw his beloved Bab surrounded by guards
and disappear from his sight, but his faith never wavered. His assurance
were these words of Siyyid Kazim, his teacher of years ago, "Hasan, your
beginning, and Hasan, your end."     Here I wish to interject that when the
guards brought the Bab to Tabriz, the capital of the province of Akirbayjan,
their chief, Muhammad Big, grief-stricken, begged the Bab for forgiveness
as he felt he had failed to serve the Bab adequately and asked to be blessed.
The Bab promised that generations of followers would exalt and bless him,
and He counted Muhammad Big as one of His followers.       His son became a
believer in Baha'u'llah, and related to Mirza Abu'l-Fad1 how his father had
accepted the Bab. Nearly all the guards in charge of the Bab's transfer and
prison wardens were bent to the will of the Bab, captivated by His soul.

The events of that long trip, some miraculous in nature, are recounted under
the title, History of the Bab.    Now we find the Bab imprisoned in the harsh
fortress of Mah-ku.   The hearts of the citizens of the nearby village and
the warden were as hard as the stones in the walls.   Their hostility towards
the new prisoner had no bounds.

-   - Hasan, trodding along, arrived shortly after the Bab's arrival, but
there was a problem. To make matters worse for the followers of the Bab,
and enforce His strict isolation, the inhabitants of the village were warned
by the prison warden, Ali-Khan, that they should not show the least mercy
towards the Bab and His followers.     They did not have to go out of their
way to implement that order. There was inherent hatred towards the Bab because
the inhabitants were of the Sunni sect of Islam with severe animosity towards
the Shi'ites, particularly the Siyyids. Now you know why the evil prime
minister chose that prison. To top what you just learned about that village,
add the following information. That forsaken village was the birthplace of
the prime minister, and its inhabitants, being proud of their famous son,
were subservient to his wishes.

As soon as Ali-Ean, the warden, heard about a follower of the Bab, namely
-   - Hasan, arriving
Shaykh                  at the village, he gave strict orders of no visitation.
He went to the extreme of every night sending -   - outside the village
gate to find lodging elsewhere. The only shelter available to him was a mosque
outside the village on the side of the stony road.

Of the two brothers who had accompanied the Bab to Mah-ku, Siyyid Husayn,
one of the Letters of the Living, was His scribe and the other His attendant.
Every day the attendant would go to the village for provisions. %aye      Hasan
exchanged letters and messages through the attendant who was a link between
the Bab and His followers.

One day the Bab told His attendant that these secret contacts with -   -
Hasan were to end, and how He, Himself, would tell the warden, Ali-&an,
to permit visitors to come and go in peace.      It is fascinating to see how
a Messenger of God, imprisoned, will impose the Divine Will upon the unbending
and arrogant warden. The average prisoner would be risking his life by such
an assertion. You wish to know that the Bab and the two brothers in His
service were the only prisoners in that immense fortress.        Otherwise, it
was occupied by two guards and a few dogs.       Truly, a forsaken place near
the border of Russia. The two brothers and --

Shaykh Hasan who learned about
the Bab's intention had no doubt, but were grateful to become witnesses to
another historical event.

For those of you who have not heard the miraculous story it will be recounted.
The next day after the Bab had spoken those words, at the early hours of
the morning the inmates were startled by loud and incessant knocking at the
gate to the castle. Well, it was Ali-man who was shouting to be let in.
Quickly, a guard rushed to say that the warden wished to see the Bab
inunediately. The Bab's     scribe took the message to Him and the Bab gave
permission. The warden was visibly shaking. He threw himself at the feet
of the Bab, and begged to be relieved of his misery.      These were the words
of the arrogant Ali-Khan, "Deliver me from my perplexity.        I adjure You,
by the Prophet of God, Your illustrious ancestor, to dissipate my doubts,
for its weight has crushed my heart.     I was riding through the wilderness,
when at the hour of dawn, my eyes sudidenly beheld You standing by the side

of the river, engaged in offering Your prayer. I stood still and watched..      .

I was waiting for You to terminate Your devotions that I might approach and
rebuke You for having ventured to leave the castle without my permission.
I quietly approached You but in Your state of rapture, You remained wholly
unaware of my presence. I was suddenly seized with great fear and recoiled
at the thought of awakening You from Your ecstasy. I decided to leave You
and admonish the guards for their negligence. I soon found out that both
the outer and inner gates were closed. Then I was ushered into Your presence
and now find You, to my wonder, seated before me.'' (The Bab, Balyuzi, p.129)

The Bab answered and said, "What you have witnessed is true and undeniable.
You belittle this Revelation and have contemptuously disdained its Author.
God, the All-Merciful, desiring not to afflict you with His punishment, has
willed to reveal to your eyes the Truth."        All the arrogance of the warden
vanished. He was totally conquered.    In utmost humility, his next words were,

\[11\] A poor man, a -   - is yearning to attain Your presence.

Shaykh,                                          I pray that
You allow me to bring him to Your presence, and by this act,      I hope my evil
deeds be forgiven."

Now you imagine -   - Hasan1s situation. He still was in the mosque, possibly
having his usual breakfast of tea, bread and cheese, when the sound of
galloping horses stopped at the entrance.    Are they agents to expel him from
that territory, or kill him as a lesson to all future visitors?        Suddenly,
he heard the pounding of the long boots of the warden with the jingle of

- doing here at this time of day?
their spurs. What is Ali-Khan                                        His worries
increased until Ali-Khan approached him and said he, himself, would take
the -   - to see the Bab. Soon he found himself riding alongside of the
changed warden. That was the way the Bab implemented His wish.        The -   -
was ecstatic while in the presence of the Bab, or transcribing His writings,
but at times his thoughts took him back to Karbila where for the first time
he beheld the radiant face of that Youth, and now, what cruelty and atrocities
are showered upon Him.   Were will it all end?

Those close to the Bab had the privilege of being informed in advance.       You
remember, for instance, when He was forced out of airaz, He told His uncle
about the mountains of Adhirbayjan and the fate of both of them.        When in

Tabriz, before the Bab's exile to Mah-ku took place, one day His scribe asked
Him whether they will stay in that city or will be transferred to another
place. His answer was, "Have you forgotten the question you asked me in
Isfahan?" You see, this answer was given during the most peaceful days of
the Bab when no one could have guesssed the ominous future.            The Bab stated
then, "No less than nine months We shall remain confined in the Jabal-i-Basit
(referring   to   Mah-ku).      From   there   We   shall   be   transferred   to   the
Jabal-i-Shadid (referring to -

Chihriq)."        The Bab went on to clearly specify
the whereabouts of these two mountain-prisons.         The meaning of Jabal-i-Basit
is the "open mountain," and Jabal-i-Shadid

-      is the "grievous mountain. "

As the words of -   - Hasan bring to light many historical events, you will
see greater forecasts even two years in advance about the manner of His
martyrdom. (Dawnbreakers, p. 243) This foreknowledge is from the Divine Realm
with no access by us mortals.          a a y m Hasan recalls, "The voice of the Bab
as He dictated the teachings and principles of His Faith, could be clearly
heard by those who were dwelling at the foot of the mountain.            Mountain and
valley re-echoed the majesty of His voice which caused our hearts to vibrate
at their very depths."       (Dawnbreakers, p. 249)

Although the restrictions were removed from the followers attaining the Bab's
presence, no one except the two brothers were allowed to spend the night
in the fortress until towards the end when Mulla Husayn arrived.                    His
spectacular visit is beyond the scope of this talk, and is mentioned under
the title of "Mulla Husayn."

As the history unfolds, we learn that, as predicted by Himself, the Bab,
after nine months of captivity in Mah-ku fortress was transferred to another
mountain fortress called -

Chihriq.       Since the Bab spent nearly 27 months there,
events were many. The restrictions of this fortress were more severe than
Mah-ku. The sister of its harsh and unpredictable warden was married to the
king. The strictness soon gave way to the effect of the Bab on the warden
and removal of the restrictions.

The state of excitement of His followers was shattered by tragic events which
engulfed the band of His devoted followers. In that period only a few events

to which Kay&    Hasan was a witness will be recounted until the time when
the Bab asked the S h a y E to go to Karbila.    After the passage of almost three
months in the new prison, the order came for the transfer of the Bab to Tabriz
for a mockery of a trial and execution.     One of the factors that aggravated
the situation was the conversion of the prominent Dayyan whose father was
a friend of the prime minister.    After all, the health of the king was rapidly
deteriorating, and so was the status of the prime minister, who needed to
impress his friends and enemies.

- Hasan was a witness to two momentous events, one after the other.
As the order arrived for the transfer of the Bab to Tabriz for so-called
examination of His claims, gay&      Hasan also headed for Tabriz where he had
relatives with the same surname of Zunuzi.        We will meet the pride of that
family in a short time.    Upon receiving the order for transfer, the Bab sent
away those followers who had gathered around Bihriq.        Also, He commissioned
-   - Hasan to collect the Writings He had revealed in the two fortresses
and hand them to a certain believer in Tabriz.

The Bab arrived in Tabriz sometime in July 1848, and was brought before the
crown prince, who was only 17 years old, and had recently been given the
governorship of that province. A panel of prominent divines of Tabriz gathered
to examine the Bab in the presence of the crown prince.             gay&   Hasan,
standing with   other   people outside the hall, was able to follow the
conversation in that examination. An officer of the army brought the Bab
and introduced Him to that gathering.           The only empty seat was the one
reserved for the crown prince. Without slightest hesitation, the Bab, to
the surprise of everyone, occupied that seat. When He was asked by the
presiding divine, who was the tutor of the crown prince, "What is the message
which you have brought?" the Bab three times repeated, "I am, I am, the
Promised Qa'im whose name you have invoked for a thousand years and at whose
mention you have risen."

The voice of one of the hostile divines suddenly took -   - Hasan back to
Karbila more than a decade earlier.      This man had been a student of their
illustrious teacher, Siyyid Kazim. At that time, gay&           could not figure
out why Siyyid Kazim deplored that student's insincerity and perversity.

Now he understood that great teacher's foresight. m k -   h Hasan's agony had
no bounds when he heard that renegade call the Bab, "You wretched and immature
lad of -

Shiraz! You have already convulsed and subverted Iraq.            Do you now
wish to arouse a like turmoil in this province?"          The Bab answered, "I have
not come here on my own accord."           That evil man furiously retorted, "Hold
your peace, you perverse and contemptible follower of Satan."              The Bab,
addressing the presiding divine, said, "Your honor, I maintain what I already
have declared."

When abusive interrogations about Arabic grammar began, the Bab, the writer
of the mighty book, Qayyumull-Asma and other tablets all in Arabic, closed
the meeting by reciting a verse from the Qur'an, rose up from His seat without
properly being dismissed and walked out.           You realize two important rules
of etiquette were broken by the Bab, only 29 years old.          One of these rules
was taking the seat of the crown prince; and the other, leaving without being
excused. These acts of the Bab were a strong challenge to the well-established
government and religious hierarchies.          Corporal punishment by bastinado was
ordered, but the officer in charge of such punishment and his men refused
to carry out that order.             An Islamic divine carried out the punishment
himself, and      once   the   rod    aimed   for the Babls feet accidentally    or
purposefully hit His blessed face and caused injury.          Later, that clergyman
died after long suffering with paralysis.

A panel of three doctors, two Persian and one English, examined the Bab to
verify His sanity so He could be executed.         Dr. McCormick, the only Westerner
ever to see the Bab, writes, "Our report was of a nature to spare His life."
Further mention of Dr. McCormick is beyond the scope of this talk; however,
you could hear it in the talk under the title, "The History of the Bab.''

How could the generations to come, as well as the historians, ever adequately
thank great disciples such as -   - Hasan for their contributions making
our history alive with minute details.

The next event is an awe-inspiring and moving story.             Remember back when
the Bab, before leaving for that mock examination in Tabriz, instructed -   -
Hasan to gather all His writings and take them to Tabriz for safekeeping.
The -   - states, "During my

Shaykh                           stay   in Tabriz, I often visited Siyyid
Aliy-i-Zunuzi who was related to me, and frequently heard him deploring the
sad fate of his son. He bitterly complained that the son's behavior had
brought shame to him. I tried to calm the son's agitation, but in my daily
visits, I witnessed the tears which continuously flowed from his eyes."

-    Hasan goes on to state, "After the Bab left Tabriz for continuation
of his incarceration in -

Chihriq, I visited the son again.            His name was
Muhammad-'Aliy-i-Zunuzi.    To my surprise I found a joy and calm in him like
never before. His handsome face was illumined with a heavenly smile when
he approached to greet me."      Right there and then Muhammad-'Ali told -   -
Hasan, "The eyes of my Beloved have beheld this face, and these eyes have
gazed upon His face."      (Dawnbreakers, p. 307)   As we sat down, he said, "Let
me tell you the secret of my happiness."     -   - became

Shaykh           spellbound, realizing
that an extraordinary and miraculous event had taken place, capable of
changing agony to ecstasy. Before you hear his account, you need to know
that Muhammad-'Ali    was a devoted follower of the Bab, but his stepfather,
attempting to prevent him from seeing the Bab in Tabriz, went to the extreme
of locking him in the house.

The young Muhammad-'Ali recounted his experience to -

S h a y B Hasan, his elder
relative, with the following words, "Let me tell you the secret of my
happiness. After the Bab had been taken back to -

Chihriq, one day as I lay
confined in my cell, I turned my heart to Him and besought Him in these words,
'Thou beholdest, 0 my Best-Beloved, my captivity and helplessness, and knowest
how eagerly I yearn to look upon Thy face.       Dispel the gloom that oppresses
my heart with the light of Thy countenance.'        What tears of agonizing pain
I shed that hour! I was so overcome with emotion that I seemed to have lost
consciousness. Suddenly,I heard the voice of the Bab calling me.           He bade
me to arise. I beheld the majesty of His countenance as He appeared before
me. He smiled as He looked into my eyes. I rushed forward and flung myself
at His feet. He said, 'Rejoice! The hour is approaching when, in this very
city, I shall be suspended before the eyes of the multitude, and shall fall
a victim to the fire of the enemy.     I shall choose no one except you to share
with Me the cup of martyrdom.       Rest assured that this promise which I give
you shall be fulfilled."'     (The Bab, Balyzi, p. 153-154)

As we see in the course of history, two years later that promise was exactly
fulfilled. No doubt, when Zay&   Hasan, then residing in Karbila, heard of
the Bab's martyrdom together with a young follower, no one had to tell him
the youth's name.        With tearful eyes he recalled what Muhammad-'Ali     had
related to him two years earlier.

Now, let us go back to the last year of the Bab's incarceration in the
fortress of -

Chihriq. It is sad to realize that joyous         events, such as the
visit of his uncle, Ali, were soon followed        by heartbreaking tragedies.
The worst was the slaughter of the defenders at Fort -

Shay&         Tabarsi.   When
the news of the massacre reached the Bab, it stilled His pen for nine months,
and for nine days He refused to eat and drink.     Of course, when the massacre
occurred, &ay&      Hasan, under the instruction of the Bab, had already left
for Karbila to witness the last momentous event promised to Him by the Bab.

The following is -   - Hasan's words, describing the last days he spent
with the Bab, "I continued to be closely associated with Him until that great
encounter of -   - Tabarsi. When informed of that event, the Bab directed
all His companions to hasten to that spot and extend every assistance to
Quddus, His heroic and distinguished disciple.       One day He told me, 'But
for my incarceration in the fortress of Gihriq, it would have been incumbent
upon Me to lend My personal assistance to My beloved Quddus.        Participation
in that struggle is not enjoined upon you. "'      Listen to this touching but
awesome promise, "You should proceed to Karbila and should abide in that
holy city inasmuch as you are destined to behold, with your own eyes, the
beauteous countenance of the Promised Husayn."    (This is an Islamic reference
to the One to appear after the Qa'im; namely, Baha'u'llah.)

The Bab further stated, "As you gaze upon that radiant face, do also remember
Me.   Convey to Him the expression of My loving devotion."          Then the Bab
emphatically added, "Verily, I say, I have entrusted you with a great mission.
Beware lest your heart grow faint, lest you forget the glory with which I
have invested you   ."

- Hasan states, "Soon after, I journeyed to Karbila and lived, as bidden,
in that holy city. Fearing that my prolonged stay in that center of pilgrimage

might excite suspicion, I decided to marry       ...(and)   to earn my livelihood
as a scribe. What afflictions befell me at the hands of the Shaykis, those
who professed to be the followers of %ay&       Ahmad and yet failed   to recognize
theBab!    Mindful of the counsels of that beloved Youth, I patiently submitted
to the indignities inflicted upon me.        For two years I lived in that city.
Meanwhile, that holy       Youth was released from His earthly prison, and through
His martyrdom was delivered from the atrocious cruelties that had beset the
closing years of His life.        It was on October 5, 1851, while I was passing
by the   ...courtyard   of the shrine of Imam Husayn, my eyes, for the first time,
fell upon Baha'u'llah.      What shall I recount regarding the countenance which
I beheld! The beauty of that face, those exquisite features which no pen
or brush dare describe, His penetrating glance, His kindly face, the majesty
of His bearing, the sweetness of His smile, the luxuriance of His jet-black,
flowing locks, left an indelible impression upon my soul.          I was then an
old man, bowed with age. How lovingly He advanced towards me!           He took me
by the hand, and, in a tone which at once betrayed power and beauty, addressed
me in these words, 'This very day I have purposed to make you known as a
Babi throughout Karbila. "'

"Still holding my hand in His, He continued to converse with me.         He walked
with me all along the market street, and in the end He said, 'Praise be to
God that you have remained in Karbila, and have beheld with your own eyes
the countenance of the promised Husayn.' I recalled instantly the promise
which had been given me by the Bab. His words, which I had regarded as
referring to a remote future, I had not shared with any one. These words
of Baha'u'llah moved me to the depths of my being. I felt impelled to
proclaim to a heedless people, at that very moment and with all my soul and
power, the advent of the promised Husayn.        He bade me, however, to repress
my feelings and conceal my emotions. 'Not yet,' He whispered in my ear, 'the
appointed Hour is approaching. It has not yet struck.         Rest assured and be
patient.'"    (Dawnbreakers, p. 32-33)

At this point, a historical background is helpful.           About one year after
the martyrdom of the Bab in 1850, upon instruction of the prime minister,
Baha'u'llah   left Tehran for Karbila, a trip which lasted nearly nine months.
It was right after His return to Tehran that on suspicion of plotting the

attempt on the life of the young king in 1852, He was thrown into the Black
Pit in Tehran. He received His mission in that infested dungeon, but did
not publicly declare it until April of 1863, in Baghdad.

With this in mind, His following final words to -   - Hasan, will be more
meaningful to us as we realize that He had not yet been imprisoned and exiled.
These were His words about the future to the awestruck Shaykh Hasan, "...the
appointed Hour is approaching. It has not yet struck. Rest assured and be
patient." Further, He confided to -   - Hasan that He was destined to reveal
it at a later time in Baghdad.        (Dawnbreakers, p. 593)    Our Baha'i history
is so well-endowed with such breathtaking events!

The Eay&     states, "From that moment all my sorrows vanished.       My soul was
flooded with joy. In those days I was so poor      ...I hungered for food.    I felt
so   rich,   however,   that   all   the   treasures of   the earth melted...into
nothingness."   Indeed, from that day on, S&ay&       Hasan became revived by the
charm of His newly found Master, and his fulfilled life ended shortly after.
Do you remember the promise given to him many years earlier by the illustrious
teacher, Siyyid Kazim, "Rejoice that your beginning was Hasan, and your end
shall also be Hasan." He died a very happy and grateful man, and we are
indebted to him for his inspiring contributions to the history.              May his
life story enkindle the spark of confirmation in our hearts.
