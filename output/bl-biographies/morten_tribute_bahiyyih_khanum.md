> **Note:** Graham Hassall writes, "Bahiyyih Khanum, the Greatest Holy Leaf, the daughter of Bahá'u'lláh who had been such a support to Shoghi Effendi, died in July 1932. Her loss was deeply felt by him, and was no less a loss to Effie \[Baker\], who loved her so dearly. Forever after Effie kept with her Marjorie Morten's tribute to the Greatest Holy Leaf." Baker herself wrote, "I just love to read and read that beautiful pen-picture of Khanum written by Marjorie Morten. Marjorie just effaces herself and brings Khanum a living person before one's eyes. How Khanum loved dear Marjorie and Marjorie loved her" (from [_Ambassador at the Court: The Life and Photography of Effie Baker_](http://bahai-library.com/hassall_ambassador_court_baker)).

this two-fold blessing we had one day when
we were with her in Àkká and she lay ill of
fever, while all the house was filled with
hushed preparations for a wedding that
evening. Just before the simple ceremony she
sent for the young girl, -- hardly more than a
child, -- who came trembling and tearful. She
blessed her with a smile, touched her white
cotton dress and the veil and wreath of orange
flowers we had improvised for her in western
fashion, and said softly, “How very pretty!”
The little bride forgot her fears at that word of
approval and went to her marriage with a
blessing she was not yet able to understand.

Among the Persians a mother in admonishing

This tender expression she used generally to

had. The word mazlúm, which signifies
acceptance without complaint, has come to be

she made the best of things, but that she found
in everything, even in calamity itself, the
germs of enduring wisdom. She did not resist
the shocks and upheavals of life and she did
not run counter to obstacles. She was never

that complete acquiescence, that perfect
accord, which underlies faith itself.
