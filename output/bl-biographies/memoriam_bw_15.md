Mr. Kenny served as Senator from Los
Angeles County, as Attorney General for the
State of California, and as a Superior Court
Judge. The fact that her husband had a world-
wide circle of acquaintances presented Mrs.
Kenny with the opportunity to give the Message
of BahB'u'llBh to many of the leaders of the
United States as well as to those of foreign
governments. Especially did these oppor-
tunities come to her during the time of the
formation of the United Nations in San
Francisco when she was socially active among
statesmen of the world.

During and subsequent to this time Mrs.

Kenny found it difficult to serve the Faith
administratively and at the same time fulfil
her obligations as wife of the Attorney General.
In a letter written on his behalf by his secretary,
the Guardian wrote to her on March 13, 1944:
"He feels that as Mr. Kenny is evidently a man
of marked capacity . . . you are fully justified in

souls and from that night they became dedi-
cated servants of the Cause of BahB'u'llah. The
life of Harold Fitzner became the embodiment
of the prayer which requests assistance in
rendering "instant, exact and complete obe-
dience".

Harold and Florence married in 1931 and
their home became a magnetic centre drawing
large numbers of people to hear of the return of
the Spirit of Truth. In that home many of the
BahB'is of Australia had their first contact with
the Teachings. Mr. Fitzner worked tirelessly,
serving on the Spiritual Assembly of Adelaide,
on various committees and as a visiting teacher
to outlying centres. For some years he was
chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly of
Australia and New Zealand. He was an avid
student of the Writings, knew many prayers
and Tablets by heart, and once copied out in
longhand the entire text of Gleanings from the

Charley learned about BahB'u'llah.

At our fourth meeting, on May 22, Charley
and I went hunting. The day coincided with the
first day of pilgrimage for Beverly and our
eight year old daughter. Charley said, "Tell
me about it again, John." While he sat calmly
on a river bank whittling the end of a shell so
it would better fit his gun, I told him again
about BahB'u'llah. After confirming that he

believed what I had told him, I simply said,
"Then you are a BahB'i, Charley." Without
looking up from his whittling, he softly
answered, "I hope so, John."

This simple statement of faith signalled the
beginning of a dynamic phase in Indian
teaching in Alaska. Within ten weeks a Spiritual
Assembly was formed in Fort Yukon, largely
due to Charley's efforts. Shortly afterwards
he moved to Fairbanks. There his teaching
resulted in the Faith reaching both Nenana and                                 .J,

was matched by his hearty laughter, his love of
children, the songs he would sing and the stories
he would tell of the old days, of the crow, the
bear, the fly or the salmon. He loved to tease
and had a knack for giving his loved ones,
especially children, endearing though whimsical
Indian names that captured their personalities.

I last saw Charley the winter before he died.

He was over seventy then but his spirit and
enthusiasm were boundless still. As we sat in
the dim yellow kerosene light of his small
cabin where we had fist talked of BahB'u'llah
I think we both sensed that it was our last
meeting. He was planning to travel to the
village of Chalkyitsik because there was
someone there "who will join us". He had an
enrolment card and asked me to fill in the
address; he would take care of the rest.

Charley died on August 6, 1969. His Bahi'i
burial, the first in the area, was conducted with
quiet dignity that contrasted sharply with the
prevailing atmosphere of fear, opposition and
prejudice. The funeral was a momentous

Central and South America and intensify
teaching among the indigenous peoples of the
Americas in fulfilment of the mission entrusted
to them by 'Abdu'l-Baha in the Tablets of the

Divine Plan. Through the Kinneys, Pacora
accepted the Cause and immediately arose to
serve it, having imbibed from these early
believers who had been in the presence of
'Abdu'l-Baha a great love for the Master and
the Guardian. Although the exact date of his
acceptance is uncertain it is clear from a letter                Pacora Blue Mountain

close friend. Roy one day asked him, "How
would you like to go to Haifa?" Roy had sent
three lighting plants to the Holy Land and had
written to 'Abdu'l-Baha asking that Curtis,
whose hobby was electricity, be permitted to
install them.2 The Master replied by cable:

strongly that he must go at once, sold his pos-
sessions and with some financial help from his
father and Roy Wilhelm left almost immedi-

He arrived in the Holy Land in September,
1921, and stayed until April of the next year,
during which time he illumined the Shrine of
the Bab, the Mansion at Bahji and the home of
'Abdu'l-Baha, No. 7 Haparsim Street, Haifa.

Only a special event could take Rezsi away

One of the brightest moments of her last years
was the visit of the Hand of the Cause of God
Amatu'l-Baha Ruhiyyih a a n u m to Bolivia in
1967\. As Rezsi entered the National BahB'i
Institute in Cochabamba she was overwhelmed
at the large gathering of Bolivian friends and
pioneers and recalled her early efforts to teach
some of the first Bolivian believers. With tear-
filled eyes she repeated the Greatest Name over
and over again and expressed praise and
gratitude to BahB'u'llah. She returned to
Tarija and never left again to attend any other
Baha'i event in Bolivia.

the new all-Swiss National Assembly. She
served both bodies most conscientiously as
recording secretary over a period of many
years.

One of the high points of Elsa's life was her
pilgrimage to the BahB'i World Centre where,
for nine days, she was the guest of Shoghi
Effendi. She returned to her post spiritually
refreshed and took up her task with, if possible,
even greater dedication. As a member of the
National Spiritual Assembly of Switzerland,
Elsa returned to Haifa in April, 1963, to parti-
cipate in the election of the first Universal
House of Justice.

In the spring of 1968 Elsa accepted the invi-
tation to live indefinitely in the BahB'i Home for
the Aged in Wilmette, Illinois. Thus she re-
turned to the United States. But she soon found
that she could no longer adjust to American
life. Her heart was in Switzerland where she
had served for more than twenty years. In
June, 1969, she returned happily to Berne.

A legend in her lifetime, she will always be
remembered for her courage, her intelligence
and the breadth of her vision. She performed
a great service for the BahB'is of the world by
bringing an early recognition in the inter-

Baker, all of whom were working diligently to
promote the Cause.

In 1932 Mamie and Tony left Hawaii to
settle in San Francisco where they continued
teaching and lecturing on the Faith. In January,
1944, as part of the first Seven Year Plan, they
set out to pioneer in Canada, going first to
Prince Edward Island, and spending six months
touring in the Maritime Provinces. Well-
meaning friends in the United States attempted
to dissuade them, warning them that Canadians
were conservative and somewhat peculiar,
that their response would be apathetic and no
publicity would result from their tour. This was
enough to trigger Mamie's Irish indignation.
She replied that her mother was Canadian and
not "peculiar" and that Divine assistance was
vouchsafed to those who arose to serve.
Mamie's huge scrapbook of press clippings
attests the warmth of their reception in Canada
and the degree of publicity their visit inspired.

on the island, however, continued to worsen
and she was forced to leave her post perma-
nently at the end of 1964. That she left behind
a nucleus of four enrolled native believers to
carry on the work of the Cause is evidence of
her unquenchable spirit.

In spite of failing health and advanced age,
Mrs. Stamp worked actively for the Faith in
South Africa until 1966, serving on the Spiri-
tual Assembly of the Baha'is of Durban. On
June 21,1966, she returned to the United States,
where she spent her remaining years in Water-
bury, Connecticut, near her son and his family.

Elizabeth Stamp passed away as the result
of a heart attack on November 11, 1970, at the
age of eighty-three and is buried next to her
husband in Washington, Connecticut. Her
spirit of shining faith and of unyielding deter-
mination are worthy examples for all who, in
the present or future, aspire to serve this Cause
in the pioneering field.

returning to the United States for the first time
in six years.

For the next four years Josephine made her
home with her niece, Rhea Akemann (Wendt),
a Baha'i in Kokomo, Indiana. She continued
to serve Baha'u'llah and while she was in
Kokomo, a firm Local Spiritual Assembly was
formed. In 1967, with failing health, Josephine
chose to join her original teacher, Selma
Gustafson, in Dayton, Ohio, where she passed
away on January 7, 1971, leaving an unfor-
gettable record of service to the Cause of
BahB'u'llah.

All who knew Josephine Kruka loved her
warmth, her generous and loving spirit. In her
seventy-first year, reflecting on her services,
she wrote to a friend: "I enjoyed the work both
in Finland and Cuba-they were my happiest
years !"

In October, 1907, Habib came to the Holy
Land where he spent a month imbibing wisdom
from 'Abdu'l-Baha. Although he was planning
to proceed to the United States for further
study, at the suggestion of Hakim Harhn and
with the approval of the Master, Habib direc-
ted his steps to Beirut where he enrolled as a
medical student at the American University of
that city. During this period he had the bounty
of serving Shoghi Effendi and sought spiritual
knowledge from such outstanding scholars as
Mirza Haydar-'Ali and Mirza Abu'l-Fadl. He
was engaged in the service of the Baha'i friends
in corresponding with various communities, in
extending hospitality to visitors and pilgrims
and in receiving and despatching Tablets to
their ultimate destination. During the summers
he had the privilege of visiting 'Abdu'l-Baha in
the Holy Land and in catching glimpses of His
infinite wisdom and knowledge. In one of His

sonality and could be both comical and dis-
arming, he was able to present cogent proofs
of the validity of the Baha'i Message without
causing offence. He was well known as a teller
of humorous stories.

In 1969, Barere served as translator to Mr.

and Mrs. Russell Garcia, professional musi-
cians from the United States, who travelled
through the islands of the Pacific aboard their
trimaran delivering the Message through word
and song. Mrs. Garcia recalls: "Barere
Otiniera was a kind, happy and friendly fellow.
He sailed with us aboard Dawn-Breaker for
about a month. He not only helped with sailing,
which meant taking a three-hour watch at the
wheel twice a day, but his humorous ways
seemed to make the long days at sea pass
quickly."

Kotzebue. Bill's greatest happiness was felt
when he was teaching. His lifeline was the
Faith; he counted the days between the news-
letters and issues of Bahci'i News. And he was
truly thrilled when a letter would arrive proving
he was remembered and thought of by a
friend.

In his home, Bill taught by action. His love
for his family was shown by silent teaching;
he taught by his efforts to live the life. The
whole village learned by his deeds which far
outweighed any words that could be spoken.

On August 5, 1972, Bill was drowned in a
boating accident at sea. A small measure of
what this village felt for him was perhaps
reflected in the large numbers who attended
his funeral to pay their respects to a very dear
and much loved friend.

William Paul Coppock loved children, his
family, his friends and his people. He loved
fishing, boating and the sea. Most of all he
loved God, and to give the Message of the
Cause. If you needed help he was always close

Shelbyville, and attended Sewanee Military
Academy from 1917 till his graduation in 1919.
That September he entered the University of
the South at Sewanee, where he won three
medals for scholarship, receiving his B.A. in
1923\. After some months in a Shelbyville bank
he obtained a position with the National City

Nashville, he was one of the company's top
executives from 1926 to 1929, when he suffered
severe losses in the stock market crash. During

Supporting himself haphazardly as a sales-
man of what were then avant-garde products
(slant boards, yoghurt), Winston did not con-
cern himself much with the practical side of life,
but constantly taught, planned and travelled.
His car, crammed with BahB'i books to give
away (he favoured those of the Hand of the
Cause George Townshend), texts by Christian
leaders and the latest news magazines, was a
sort of bachelor's ambulating pied-a-terre.
Always an attraction, he was welcome every-
where. Crowds would gather, the local megia
came alive, new BahB'is appeared. His slight
southern accent was often affectionately re-
ferred to, as were such individualisms as his
offbeat diets, and the fact that, having studied
eye training with W. H. Bates, he never wore
glasses. Tall, elegant, in the old phrase "to the
manner born", he is best seen as he issued from
the WilmetteHouse of Worship in theColumbia

'I   WORLD

It was in New York City, when in her twen-
ties, that Marion met Mrs. Loulie Mathewsl
and first heard of the BahB'i Faith. Her accept-
ance of Baha'u'llah was instantaneous. From
that time until Loulie's death, these two beauti-
ful souls, very much alike in their complete
dedication to the Cause, their zeal and initia-
tive, planned and carried out several unique
and rewarding undertakings. One of these was
the highly successful Summer School at Mrs.
Mathews' "Temerity Ranch" in Pine Valley,
Colorado, established especially for the en-
couragement and deepening of pioneers for
Latin America.

By 1928 Marion had entered actively into
the national and administrative work of the
Faith, serving as secretary of the Publishing
Committee located in New York, and be-
coming, in effect, its business and production
manager. She also served as a member of the
National Teaching and the Inter-America
Committees.

In the publishing field, one of Mrs. Little's
first achievements was the production of The                                  Marion Little

The Hidden Words, No. 45 (Arabic)

Luis Montenegro was born in Choconta,
Colombia on April 23,1932. From the moment
he accepted the BahL'i Faith, in 1951, he was
a constant, sincere, firm and active worker.
He was a man of marked capacity and con-
scientiousness and had a high sense of respon-
sibility.

Mr. Montenegro participated energetically
in the activities of the Spiritual Assembly of

Bogota and later he was elected a delegate to
the sixth annual convention of the National
Spiritual Assembly of South America as it was
known in the period from 1951 to 1957. In
