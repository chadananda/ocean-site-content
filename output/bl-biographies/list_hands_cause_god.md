Hands of the Cause of God

Appointed by

Bahá’u’lláh
‘Abdu’l‐Bahá
Shoghi Effendi
‘ALI-AKBAR-I-SHAHMIRZADI (Hájí ÁKHÚND), (1842/3-1910) Hájí Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar-i-Shahmírzádí), Persian
HAND OF THE CAUSE. MÚLLÁ ‘ALÍ-AKBAR-I-SHAHMÍRZÁDÍ (aka Hájí Akhund) was born sometime between 1842
and 1843 in Shahmírzád, Persia (Iran). After reading the Kitáb-i-Iqán (The Book of Certitude)* he embraced the
Cause. He was imprisoned for the Faith at least five times. Bahá’u’lláh entrusted him with the sacred task of moving
and hiding the Remains of the Báb. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has testified: “The photograph of this blessed individual, together
with that of the great Amín, taken of them in their chains, will serve as an example to whoever has eyes to see. There
they sit, those two distinguished men, hung with chains, shackled, yet composed, acquiescent, undisturbed.” *** “This
honored man was successful in converting a multitude. For the sake of God he cast all caution aside, as he hastened
along the ways of love. He became as one frenzied, as a vagrant and one known to be mad.” He was appointed a
Hand of the Cause by Bahá’u’lláh. He died in Tihrán in 1910.

‘ALA’I, Shu’a’u’llah (1889-1984) Iranian HAND OF THE CAUSE. He was born in Tehran into a prominent family: his father
was set to become a cleric, but had converted to the Bahá’í Faith, subsequently becoming physician to the royal household. He
himself studied accountancy, after which he pursued a distinguished career in various fields of government service, becoming
chief controller of army finances (with the rank of general) . He was elected on to the Tehran Bahá’í assembly in 1913, and the
newly formed Iranian Bahá’í national assembly in 1934, often serving as its chairman. Shoghi Effendi appointed him as one of
the first group of Hands in 1952, and thereafter he travelled extensively, visiting Bahá’í communities in many parts of the world.
He left Iran in 1978, spending the last few years of his life in France and then Arizona. Harper 335-8.

ALEXANDER, Agnes Baldwin (1875-1971) American HAND OF THE CAUSE. Born into a Hawaiian Christian missionary
family, she became a Baha’i during a visit to Italy in 1900. She returned to Hawaii in December 1901 as the first Bahá’í on the
islands, becoming instrumental in the growth of a Baha’i community there. After the deaths of her parents she moved to the
American mainland, and then, at the request of ‘Abdu’l-Baha, moved to Japan. Reaching there in November 1914, she worked
with George AUGUR and his wife to establish a Bahá’í community, spending much of the rest of her life in the country. She was
also the first to present the Bahá’í teachings in Korea (1921). She was appointed a Hand on 27 March 1957. She died in Hawaii.

Effendi in 1925 and became a devoted Bahá’í. He was appointed a Hand of the Cause by Shoghi Effendi in October 1957, and
acted as one of the translators at the Conclaves of the Hands. Increasingly, health problems prevented him from travelling to visit
the Baha’is and he turned to scholarly research (see BABI AND BAHÁ’Í STUDIES). A string of books followed: detailed

graduated from Howard University with a degree in law. He became a Baha’i in Washington DC in 1909. Already an advocate of
racial equality, Gregory challenged de facto segregation in the local Baha’i community. In this he was supported by ‘Abdu’l-
Baha, who during his own visit to Washington DC (1912) deliberately sat Gregory next to him at a formal luncheon in clear
disregard of social convention. ‘Abdu’l-Baha also encouraged him to marry Louisa Mathew (1866-1956), a white Englishwoman,
this being the first black-white marriage in the American Baha’i community, and an act requiring considerable courage in the
social conditions of the time. Gregory undertook extensive travels to promote the Faith, particularly in the southern states. He
played a leading role in the advocacy of racial equality by the Baha’is, and for a number of years was the only black Baha’i on
the American national spiritual assembly. Shoghi Effendi posthumously named him as a HAND OF THE CAUSE. Louisa was
prominent in Baha’i teaching activities in the Balkans, BW12: 666-70; 13: 876-8; Harper 85-92.

particularly active in Baha’i child education and the Baha’i ESPERANTO movement, which he organized in Germany. He also
wrote a number of books on the Faith (in German) and translated Baha’i literature. After the banning of the Baha’i Faith by the
Nazi regime in May 1937 he suffered intermittent persecution, including the confiscation and destruction of much of his Baha’i
library and archives and a six-month period of imprisonment. In June 1945 he was able to start reorganizing the Baha’i

local assemblies. In 1957 Rabmatu’llah was elected onto the regional spiritual assembly, and in October named as one of the final
group of Hands by Shoghi Effendi. In 1958 the Muhajirs left Indonesia, subsequently travelling extensively throughout the
Baha’i world. Rabmatu’llah played a key role in inspiring several Baha’i communities to begin campaigns of ‘mass teaching’ to
establish Baha’i communities in the rural areas of the Third World. He also encouraged the establishment of Baha’i educational

Bahá designated him a Hand of the Cause of God. * Pronounced low-heh-heck-mat.

OLINGA, Enoch (1926-79) The only black African HAND OF THE CAUSE. Olinga was a Christian Ugandan of the Teso
tribe. He became a Baha’i in 1952 in Kampala, and shortly afterwards returned to his home district to teach the Faith. In 1953 he
was the first Baha’i PIONEER to British Cameroon, and was named as KNIGHT OF BAHA’U’LLAH for that territory. In 1956
he was elected as chairman of the newly formed Regional Spiritual Assembly for North-West Africa, and in 1957 became the
first of the new African Baha’is to make the pilgrimage to the BAHA’I WORLD CENTRE. Shoghi Effendi named him as
‘Father of Victories’ (Abu’l-Futuh) for his services to the Faith, and in October 1957 appointed him as a Hand of the Cause: at
thirty-one he was the youngest of those appointed. Extensive world-wide travels followed. He served as a rallying point for the
Ugandan Baha’is during the troubled 1977-9 period. He, his wife and three of hiis children were murdered on 16 September 1979
by unknown assailants. BW18: 618-35; Harper 462-72

RANSOM-KEHLER, Keith (1876-1933) Prominent American Baha’i. She became a Baha’i in 1921, and after the death of her
second husband in 1923 became increasingly active as a Baha’i speaker and teacher. In 1929 she travelled to the Caribbean, and
in 1930 began an extensive world tour to promote the Faith. Shoghi Effendi invited her to Haifa in 1932, and gave her a special
mission to go to Iran on behalf of the American national spiritual ASSEMBLY to petition the Shah to ease or lift the restrictions
on the Baha’is. She stayed in Iran for over a year, but her efforts were unavailing. Exhausted and in poor health she eventually
succumbed to smallpox, and was buried in Isfahan near to the graves of the KING AND BELOVED OF MARTYRS. Shoghi
Effendi named her posthumously as a HAND OF THE CAUSE, and as the first American to have the spiritual station of a
MARTYR. BW5: 23-7, 93, 389-410; Harper 99—109.

REMEY, Charles Mason (1874-1974) American HAND OF THE CAUSE and, finally, COVENANT-BREAKER. Remey was
the son of Admiral George Collier Remey. He became a Baha’i in Paris in 1899 and became one of the most travelled of the early
Western Baha’is, visiting Iran and Central Asia with another Baha’i in 1908 and, in 1909-10, completing the first round-the-
world tour of Baha’i communities. He also became prominent in the American Baha’i community as an author, public speaker
and administrator (BFA2: 151- 2, 289-95, 333-4, 348-512). He was appointed to the first INTERNATIONAL BAHA’I
COUNCIL by Shoghi Effendi in 1950, and named as a Hand in the following year. He designed the Houses of Worship in
Kampala and Sydney (see MASHRIQU’l-ADHKAR), as well as the future temple on Mount CARMEL. After the death of
Shoghi Effendi (1957) Remey joined his fellow Hands in the first conclave and their declaration that there was no designated
successor as Guardian. He was chosen as one of the Custodial Hands. He later came to believe that the GUARDIANSHIP had to
be continued, however, and that he himself was the second Guardian by dint of having been appointed president of the
International Council (itself the precursor of the Universal House: of Justice over which the Guardian would preside). He issued a
proclamation to this effect in April 1960, but only succeeded in gaining the support of a small number of Baha’is world-wide. He
and his followers were subsequently declared Covenant-breakers by me Hands, who reasoned that his claim was unsupported by
any formal appointment by Shoghi Effendi, and that according to ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s WILL AND TESTAMENT the line of
Guardians was confined to the male descendants of Baha’u’llah (AGHSAN). Harper 287-306; SBBR 130-1; TCB 385-91. 429-
32; UJH Ministry of the Custodians.
ROBARTS, John Aldham (1901-91) Canadian HAND OF THE CAUSE. He and his wife, Audrey, became Baha’is in 1938,
having first learned about the Faith from John’s aunt, Grace Ober. Their enormous dedication provided significant support for the
growth of the then still minuscule Canadian Baha’i community: teaching the Faith, helping to establish spiritual assemblies, and
serving on committees. In 1948 a separate Canadian national spiritual assembly was formed, with John as its chairman. In 1953
the Robartses and their two youngest children pioneered to Mafeking, then capital of Bechuanaland (modem Botswana),
subsequently moving to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), In 1956 John was elected onto the newly formed regional assembly
for South and West Africa, and in October 1957 was appointed as one of the final group of Hands. In 1966 the Robartses returned
to Canada. They continued to travel extensively, visiting Baha’is in various parts of the world, despite their advancing age and
John’s increasing frailty. Harper. 73-95.

Root, Martha Louise (1872-1939) Prominent American Baha’i itinerant teacher and writer. A journalist and former school
teacher, she became a Baha’i in Pittsburgh in 1909. In 1915 she made a lengthy visit to various Baha’i communities in Asia and
elsewhere, supporting herself by publishing articles in the United States. In 191 9, in response to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s appeal in the
TABLETS THE DIVINE PLAN, she began what was to become her life’s work with an extended visit to promote the Faith in
several countries of Latin America. Travelling from city to city she gave talks - often to Theosophist and Esperanto groups -
wrote articles for newspapers and magazines, put Baha’i books in libraries, and contacted government officials, educators and
others. Other lengthy tours followed: between 1923 and 1930 she visited the Far East, Australasia, Europe, the Middle East and
India. Then after a year in the United States and Canada she went again to Europe (1932-6) and then to East Asia, Ceylon, India
and Australasia (1937-9). She died in Honolulu on the return leg of her journey. Disregarding her own health and living much of

the time in poverty, she pushed herself to seize every opportunity to promote the Faith, making myriads of new contacts,
including her meetings with Queen MARIE of Romania. She was the first person to make a radio broadcast about the Baha’i
Faith (in Perth, Australia in 1924). In Europe she helped set up the INTERNATIONAL BAHA’I BUREAU, and enormously
expanded Baha’i links with the Esperanto movement. Shoghi Effendi posthumously named her HAND Of THE CAUSE and
