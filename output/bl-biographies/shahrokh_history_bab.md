HISTORY OF THE B ~ B
A transcript of audio-cassette from series

WINDOWS TO THE PAST
by Darius K. Shahrokh, M.D.

This very special window from these ageless Windows to the Past
will open to the exciting and tragic life of the BBb.
The history of the awescme life of the FAb is presented in story
form. To convey the spirit of the events, the long Persian names,
which have a tendency to overwhelm the Western audience, are
avoided. These names have been abbreviated or mentioned by their
relationship to the B&,      ora the individual's position. For
instance, &ji krza Siyyid Ali, the uncle who raised the BBb,
is at times referred to as "Uncle 'A~I,''       and 'Abdu'l-mid
~hh-i-D&ri&ih
-              as "the police chief."
Before I talk about His history, I like to give an introduction
by mentioning a few facts about Islb and the condition of Iran
in that period. The sources used for this presentation are God -
Passes E3y by the Guardian, The Dawn-Breakers by~abil-i-~arandi,
and The El& by Balyuzi.

> The Prophet-Founder of 1slh was warranad, who was followed by
> eleven IrGuns. After Mulymmad's death, the first ImZm was I m h
I

> Ali, who was his son-in-law. These eleven In-&ns succeeded lvlt$-~rnd
> for two hundred sixty years. Five years before the death of the
> last ImSm, supposedly a son was born, who, when his father died,
> presided over the funeral of his father and then disappeared and
> went to some underground passages in two mysterious cities called
~&ulq& and J&uls&.     According to the gi' ih sect of Islh, he

is still living and is expected to come out of hiding at the end
> of the. For about sixty-nine years he cmunicated with the
Muslims through emissaries called the Gates, or Abva, which is

the plural of the a.This period of sixty-nine years when four
of these Gates came is called the minor occultation. After the
fourth Gate died, he did not appoint another gate, and this period
of Islh is called the major occultation which means no
communication with the twelfth Im&n until the end of time.
This brief information about the Im&s oE the &I''ih sect of Islh
was given because the Bgb appeared among them, but by no means
one should conclude that the &id ites were the only people whose
scriptures prophecied His appearance. The Bahh'i belief, as
expounded by the Guardian in Gcd Passes By, pages 57 and 58, is
that the EAb was the &'im (meaning He Who ariseth) promised to
the hiâ€˜ ites, the ~ihdi (meaning One Who is guided) awaited by
the Sunni sect of Isl&n, the return of John the Baptist expected
by the Christians, the ir&idar-M     referred to in the Zoroastrian
scriptures, and the return of Elijah anticipated by the Jews.
The time that the B& appeared was one of the darkest periods in
the history of Iran. Here was a country morally corrupt and
intellectually bankrupt, having been ruled by greedy rulers and
inept prime ministers. It must be rare in history to find three
successive, kings, ~a~-(hli   s M , Mdpmmd Sh&,     and his son,
~asiriId-Din -,    put to deaG their highest ministers who brought
them to the throne. manunad         was the king in whose time the
B5.b appeared. Faa-'All Shkh, who reigned before Mmarrunad S M ,
is known to have had aboutyne thousand wives and two hundred sixty
children of whom one hundred ten survived the king. The Persian
proverb that says camels, fleas, and princes existed everywhere
in the country was very true.
About fifty years before the appearance of the B&, there were
two luminaries who were very spiritual and had deep knowledge of
Islam. These two were teaching in the holy cities of Karbila and
Najaf which are about fifty miles frcm &&dad.    They revolutionized
sane of the understanding of the Muslims with their doctrines.
One doctrine was that resurrection is not of physical form but
is of spiritual nature. Number two, the Promised One, or @'im,
or 'Ikelfth ImEm, would be born of a mother and would not be coming
from hiding after one thousand years. The third was very unusual
for Muslims of then and today, which was about continuity of coming
of Messengers of Gcd. Muslims believe Mulymnad is the Seal of
the Prophets and after Him no more Messengers of Gcd would appear.

These luminaries, Shaykh W d and Siyyid KEizim, stated that
> Muhammad was the sea?-ofthe Prophets, that means no more prophets
> coming to prophecy; however, this did not mean He was the Seal
> of the Messengers. God would continue to send Messengers for 1
> guidance of man. They expounded these three major doctrines to
> a large number of followers who were being prepared for the caning
of t h e w .

> The Ekb was born on October 20, 1819.    He was the son of a merchant
in. -

Shiraz, a southern city in Iran.           His given name was
> '~li-M&md, and He was a siyyid, meaning a descendant of the
> Prophet warnmad. His father died when He was quite young and
> He was raised by His uncle, Haj1 ~irzaSiyyid 'A~F, His mother Is
> brother. He had very little education but had innate knowledge.

By age fifteen, He joined His uncle in trading in Shir'az, and a
/r       later, He moved to the port city of ~ G i h rtojoin another

> uncle in trading.     When He was twenty-two, He made pilgrimage
> to the holy cities of Karbils and Najaf in Iraq which lasted about
> seven months. Soon after His return to His hometown of ~hiraz,
> He married KhadPjih Bagum. His marriage witnessed two traaies.
> One was thedeath of His newborn son, Alptad, and the other was
> His own abduction, never to see His wife and mother again.
As you recall, I told you that two teachers, -    - m d and Siyyid

Shaykh
> &zim, came before the Declaration of the B i b to prepare people
> for the coming of the Promised me. Their doctrines were not
> actually new doctrines. They were true understanding of 1slhic
> holy words. Before the last teacher, Siyyid KAzim, died, he told
> his students they should disperse and find the Promised One, or
> the Welfth Im&,    called by the hi' ih sect the Gtim. One of
> these students, Mulla Husayn, headed towards giraz, and the %b
> met him outside the city and invited him to cane to His house.
> Mull5 Husayn, not knowing the a,      thought He was another student
> of Siyyid Gzim. Mulla Husayn was about thirty-one years old and
> the B5b was twenty-five years old at that time.

> In the Ekb s house, after having tea, the B& asked him, "Who are
> you expecting to cane after your teacher?'' Mulla Husayn said,
> "NO one will teach us anymre and we are looking for q e Promised
> 6'im."   The E!& said, id your teacher give any signs about the
> Promised one?" Mulla Husayn said, "He told us the Promised One
> would be of medium height, He would be a descendant of the Prophet,
and free of any bodily defect, and so on." The l3& looked at him
and said with a vibrant voice, "Behold! All of these signs are
manifest in Me!" This startled Mulla Husayn who could not believe
his ears. Then the E3& asked, "Did he give any other signs about
the coming of the Promised One?" Mulla Husayn replied yes, but
he was not at liberty to say what they were.
You like to know that there is a chapter or skih in the ~ u r ' k ,
the Islhic Holy Book, which is called the Chapter of Joseph.
It is about the brothers betraying Joseph and his life history.
When Mulla Husayn asked the last teacher, Siyyid K&zim, to write
a cmentary about this chapter, Siyyid Gzim said, "This is beyond
me. The only one who will do it for you is the Promised ~ ' i m ,
and He will reveal the commentary without being asked.
While Mulls Husayn was recalling that experience, the El& looked
him in the eyes and said, "NOW is the time for Me to reveal the
cmentary on the Chapter of Joseph." You can imagine it was like
a thunderbolt striking Mulla Husayn. So the a,      unasked, started
to reveal the cmentary to this chapter of Qur'h. Mulla Husayn
states, " ~ etook pen and paper, and as He wrote the cmentary,
the manner, the rapidity of His writing was heightened by the gentle
intonation of His voice." Mulla Husayn, elated and exulted, was
beyond himself. That evening was the evening of the Declaration
of the Ehb, on May 22, 1844. He told Mulla Husayn, "This evening
will be celebrated in the future throughout the world." He also
said, "I am the B& (or the Gate) and you are the B&'ul-E&
(meaning the Gate to the Gate) , but you must keep your discovery
concealed until seventeen more people independently discover Me
and then I will give you your instructions."
It took about forty days before the second person discovered the
ESb by himself, and in about three months, the number eighteen
was completed. These first eighteen people who believed in the
Brib are called ~ d - i - ~ori the Letters of the Living. One was
a wanan called Wirih, and one was frcxn India. After their
completion, the B& gave them their assignments. He revealed a
tablet in honor of each of them before sending them away. He took
the last one, (~lddus,with Him to go for pilgrimage to Mec& in
fulfillment of 1 s l ~ cprophecy. He gave Mulla Husayn, the first
to accept Him, an unusual assignment which was to deliver a letter

t o a person i n Tehran, t h e c a p i t a l c i t y , without a c t u a l l y mentioning
any name. H e t o l d M u l l a Husayn, "Do not be grieved t h a t I have
not chosen t o take you with M e f o r pilgrimage. The c i t y you w i l l
be going t o w i l l become t h e envy of a l l of the holy cities of t h e
present t i m e . " That meant Isl5rt-L~ holy c i t y of Mec& and the l i k e .

The BAb and t h e l a s t Letter of t h e Living, @.~ddiis, did n o t start
their t r i p u n t i l the Ehb could hear t h a t Mulls Husayn had
successfully c a r r i e d o u t h i s mission. Mulla Husayn, a s instructed
by the Ehb, v i s i t e d I s f h and K5&5n, and then directed h i s s t e p s
toward Tehran, and t h e rest of t h e sixteen L e t t e r s of the Living
traveled throughout I r a n and neighboring countries t o spread the
glad t i d i n g s of the advent of t h e Promised G'im. M u l l a Husayn
had a s c r o l l t o d e l i v e r but no name o r address on it. After h i s
a r r i v a l i n Tehran, he lodged i n a school where t h e d i r e c t o r of
t h e school was t h e leading -          ~ha-

y k h l i n Tehran. The shaykhi
c m i t y was t h e followers of the two luminaries, shaykr~-d
and Siyyid Gzim. After meeting the d i r e c t o r and givTngXim t h e
great announcement of t h e coming of t h e Ehb with convincing proofs
and arguments, t h e d i r e c t o r not only refused every word Mulla Husayn
had t o say, but he a l s o accused Mulla Husayn of betraying h i s
teacher, Siyyid Kfizim. ~ u l l aHusayn t r i e d t o s t a y away frm t h e
school as much a s he could because the d i r e c t o r t o l d him t h a t he
had brought shame t o the name of t h e i r teacher with such outrageous
and unacceptable words about t h e coming of t h e Promised G'irn.

A student i n t h e school, who w a s very close t o t h e d i r e c t o r and
had a room next t o h i s , happened t o hear a l l of t h e i r conversation
and became very eager t o meet Mulla Husayn.                  Late one night he
s a t up u n t i l he heard Mull& Husayn r e t u r n t o h i s room. H e knocked
a t the door and Mull& Husayn greeted him. The student s a i d , "I
could not help but t o hear your discussion with t h e headmaster
and I was very surprised about h i s arrogance, refuting a l l of your
clear and convincing proofs."          Mull6 Husayn s a i d , "well, I d i d
not f i n d t h e headmaster receptive, but I am glad t o see a t least
one of h i s students blessed with a s p i r i t u a l eye."        Mull& Husayn
asked, "What is your name and where is your hame?" H e s a i d , "My
name is Mulla Muhammad-i-Mu'allim (means t e a c h e r ) , and I do hme-
tutoring of children. My hametown is NGr. " ~ u l l aHusayn, hearing
of N I ~ s,a i d , "What happened t o t h e sons of ~ i r z a~ u z u r g - i - ~ I k i
(the f a t h e r of Bah&'u8llhh)? Have any of them proven worthy of

his illustrious legacy?" The answer was, "Yes, one of his sons,
~irzaHusayn- 'All, has distinguished Himself by the very qualifica-
tions which characterized their father." Mulla Husayn's eyes opened
wide and he became all ears to hear more about ~irzaHusayn- 'Ali,
He asked the teacher, " ~ oyou visit their house often?" The answer
was yes. Mull& Husayn gave the scroll wrapped in a cloth to the
teacher and requested that he deliver it to drza Husayn- 'All at
the hour of dawn the next morning.
The next morning before sunrise the teacher went to Eah&'u'll&hls
house and was ushered into the presence of E?ahh'ulllkh by His
brother, drza ~usa. He handed over the scroll to M&za           MI^&,
who in turn gave it to &'ulll&h.         The scroll was a few pages
fram the first chapter of ~ a y y h 'u1-ASIC&

', the cmentary on the
Slirih of Joseph which the EW had revealed for Mulla Husayn.
E3ah&'u1ll& read parts of it aloud and turned to His brother and
said; "~usa,what have you to say? Verily, I say whoso believes
in the ~ur'&nand recognizes its divine origin, and yet hesitates,
though it be for a moment, to admit that these soul-stirring words
are endowed with the same generating power, has most assuredly
erred in his judgment and has strayed far from the path of justice."
Then He dismissed the teacher with the custamary gift of hard sugar
cone and tea for the messenger, Mulla Husayn, with expressions
of His appreciation and love.      The teacher stated, "I hastened
to Mulla Husayn and delivered to him the gift and the message.
With tears of joy, he stood up and took the gifts with bowed head
and fervently kissed it. Then he embraced me and kissed my eyes
which had beheld the person destined to receive that scroll. Mulla
Husayn told me not to breathe this event to any soul so no harm
would come to the nobleman, drza Husayn- 'Ali."
In a short time, Mulla Husayn left for a m a s k which was his
assignment from the  a,  and from there he wrote to the E6b about
the gracious response of the nobleman. This message brought great
joy to the     who told QuddGs, "NOW the Cause of God is in capable
hands and we could start our journey to Mec&. 'I You wish to know
that Mulla MuIymad-i-Mu'allim, the teacher from N~U, became a
believer and was martyred in the episode of say% ~abarsi.
It was in September of 1844 when the B&b, Quddfis, and the B5b1s
faithful FXhiopian servant, Mubkrak, left &irk for the port city

of Biishihr to take a sail boat for the port city of Jiddah in
~rabiaTThe ship, bearing m y pilgrims, left B6Sihr on 2nd of
October to meet a very stormy ocean. The storm, tossing the ship
in every direction, and later, shortage of drinking water, caused
severe alarm for the pilgrims, but to their surprise, day after
day, they watched the B&b, in serenity, was busy revealing verses
taken down by Quddus. Among the pilgrims was the brother of the
Im&n Jum'ih of giraz. Im&n Jum'ih was the leading clergy who
had officiated at the wedding of the B& and later proved to be
the protecting hand of providence, but his brother, A    b

was something else. Abu-~6shi.m was watching the Ekb and Q~ddGs
very closely, and, being jealous of the a ' s reverence, became
daily more arrogant and rude. He ill-treated all passengers but
his main target was the Ebb. The A r a b captain could no longer
tolerate his behavior so he gave order to his sailor to throw
AbG-Hkhim overboard. When the Ihb noticed that the sailors were
ready t o throw him into the sea, He hurled Kimself upon that
miserable man and begged the captain for forgiveness. The captain
could not believe his eyes because the     had been the main victim.
The Ekb told the captain that since people who behave in that manner
harm only their own souls, others should be tolerant and forgiving.
A new lesson for the captain and the rest of us.
That stormy trip took two months going around the Arabian peninsula.
On their travel from the port of Jiddah to Mecca, the R h rode
a camel, but Q~ddus refused to ride and walked all the way.        In
that year the pilgrimage, or l p j , was m j-i-Akbar, or the greatest
haj, because two dates coincided, and therefore the crowd was very
large,    Islknic tradition has it that the appearance of (lath
will be in the year of Haj-i-Akbar. In fulfillment of Islgmic
prophecy, in the middle of the overwhelming crowd, the B& stood
against the structure of Ka'bih, the cubical structure, held the
ring of its door and three times repeated, "I am the @ 'im whose
advent you have been awaiting." which fell on deaf ears. They
were by name Muslims, but did not understand 1slh.
He sailed back to the port city of Biishihr and arrived scmetime
before Naw-Rfiz in 1845. There He partz with Q~ddfiswith these
words, he hour of separation has struck, a separation which no
reunion will follow except in the Kingdcm of G d , in the presence
of the King of Glory."

Quddus left Bushihr with a letter Â£ran the Ehb to His uncle,
Siyyid 'Ali, w      soon after receiving the letter and hearing
convincing words of Q~ddGs,embraced the Cause of his Nephew Whom
he had raised. This uncle was the only relative, who during the
lifetime. of the a,    became a believer. The EGb's wife, madljih
Bagum, before His Declaration, recognized His station. Soon after
the arrival of Quddus in ~hiraz,a distinguished believer, Mulla
Sdiq, who was converted by-mlla Husayn, with his student arrived
in shiraz.    Because of their activities, they were arrested and
rnerc~lesslybeaten, Mu11a Sadiq receiving no less than one thousand
lashes on his bare back. They were sentenced by the governor to
lose their beards by setting fire to them. The next day, their
faces blackened, a hole was made in their noses and a string pulled
through. The executioner paraded them through the streets and
bazaars, collecting money from bystanders.          At times, the
executioner violently pulled on the string to hear them scream.
After his pockets were filled with money, he led them to the city
gate and expelled them. These three precious souls were the first
to suffer in the path of Gcd, opening the chapter of brutal tortures
and never-ending martyrdoms until the number swelled to twenty
thousand.
The F&b spent ~aw-Ihiz with His uncle, who did not recognize the
station of the &b until ten years later when throuah the
~it&b-i-iqh,or The Book of certitude, revealed by E!ah&';'ll&,
became a believer. Towards end of June, the BQb left Bii&ihr   for
shiraz where another act of the divine drama took place.
-
The vicious and depraved governor, Husayn K&n,         who already
tormented and expelled the three -1s       from ~hiraz,confiscated
the writings of the l3& and became furious by their contents which
were admonishments to the civic and religious leaders. When he
heard that the E?& was in Bkhihr, he decided to humiliate Him
so the people would realize thrfalsity of His claim and see that
He had no powers. He dispatched his most trusted officer and sent
him with a number of guards to arrest the E35b and bring Him as
a prisoner in chains to the city for everyone to see. The Lhb
had already left F3G&i$r   for ~ i r a z .The leader of guards, who
was of the 'Aliyulll5hi sect of Isl&n, which are known for being
tolerant, related this account. "Having gone more than midway
between Shirk and Ehishihr, we encountered a youth wearing a green

turban on horseback followed by His Ethiopian servant. As we
approached Him, He saluted us and inquired about our destination.
I tried to conceal it. He smilingly said, 'The governor has sent
you to arrest me. Here I am.' I was startled and could not believe
how anyone willingly would throw himself into the clutches of the
mean and furious governor. I tried to ignore Him. As I prepared
to leave, He approached me and said, 'I swear by God, that all
My life I have uttered no word but the truth and had no wish except
the welfare of my fellow men. I wish not to subject you and your
companions to the annoyance of searching for me. ' These words         1
moved me profoundly. I dismounted my horse and kissed His stirrups
and begged Him to grant my wish by escaping and not making me the
instrument of delivering Him into the hands of the ruthless and
despicable governor. I said, 'My companions are all honorable
and our lips are sealed. I pray that you take the sanctuary of
the shrine in Ma-ad.    ' Here was His response, 'May God reward
you for your noble intention. No one knows the mystery of My Cause.
No one can fathom its secrets. I will never turn my face away
frcm the decree of God. Until my last hour is at hand, none dare
assail Me and none can frustrate the plan of the Almighty. Here
I am. Deliver me into the hands of your master.        No one will
blame you.' I bowed my head in consent and carried out His desire."
What an awe-inspiring and moving incidence.      With majesty, in
front of His escort of guards, He entered the city.    A marvelous
sight for the multitude of bystanders to recognize Who was in
command.
The EL5b went straight to the seat of the government, and as soon
as the governor heard about His arrival, he summoned Him. He rudely
ordered the I35.b to sit in a chair at the center of the room across
from himself.      Other officials and clergy were also present.
He, angrily with abusive language, denounced Him, and after the
Bhb quoted frcm the ~ur'hn,he ordered an attendant to strike the
El& in the face so violently that His turban fell to the ground.

- &-Tura, the kind ~ - J u m ih
Shaykh
-                                       L strongly disapproved the
conduct of the governor and gently replaced the Fhb's turban and
invited Him to sit by his side.      After further questioning, the
BiIb was released upon demar?d of the governor for heavy bond which
was produced by Siyyid 'Mi, the & b l s uncle.      Uncle '~litook
the F&b to his own house, but later the Ihb went to His own home
under the custody of His uncle.

In this period, for the first time, the B& had a group of followers
around Him. The eighteen htters of the Living discovered the
EGb independently, and soon after their completion, they dispersed.
Now the E3& was back in ~hlraz,and, in spite of strong measures
of the governor, many @is       came into His presence, receiving
tablets and instructions. His hometown Saw the birth of the first
Ehbi community.

With the spread of the news of His claim, agitation of the clergy
heightened to the stage of issuing the death sentence which was
rejected by the hand of providence, gay&            Abb - Tur&b, the

.
~ - J u m ih
b   ~ - J u mih

' means the Friday prayer-leader which
also signifies the leading clergy.     With the clamor of the clergy
and the outcry of the ignorant, the Ir&m-Jum6ih felt obliged to
fulfill the pledge he had given during the first meeting where
the B& was abused and insulted by the governor. So he approached
Uncle 'All and invited the B& to the mosque on Friday, requesting
a statement from the BSb to ease the tension.
On that Friday, the large mosque, called Masjid-i-~akil,was crowded
beyond capacity. The courtyard, rooftops, and even minarets were
filled. After all, by the order of the governor and the divines,
the criers had invited all the people to witness the a ' s
renunciation of His claim. Who could afford to miss that event?
The      accompanied by His uncle, arrived. A sudden hush descended
upon the crowd as if you could hear a pin drop. The Im&n-JumLih
was seated on top of the twelve-step marble pulpit. He invited
the Bgb to climb the pulpit. The B&b went on the first step but
Indm-Jum 'ih invited Him to come higher so He climbed a couple more
steps. There He denied being a representative, emissary, or gate
to the Twelfth I&n.         You should realize that He did not deny
Who He was. Earlier I mentioned that according to S&'ites,     aÂ£ter
the Tbelfth I m h disappeared, he sent four gates or emissaries.
So the EAb denied being another gate to the Twelfth l i n h . He was
the Twelfth Im&n, or the i m Himself, and also a Gate to
Bah&'ulll&h. Following that pronouncement, which temporarily calmed
the crowd, He wished to stay for the prayer but the Im&n-Jum'ih
requested that it would be preferable if He offered His prayer
at hame with His family.        He was afraid that after the prayer,
the mob might harm the El&.

The message of the B5b was spreading fast, and with the event in
that mosque, the king, W W d &5h,          became interested to
investigate the Cause of the young Siyyid '~li-bk$mtmad,now only
twenty-six years old, a delicate man with gentle voice and fair
complexion.
While the curtain is opening to this momentous act of the drama,
and before the act unfolds, you should realize that it is one of
the acts which the Guardian refers to as "His influence exerted
on the most eminent among His countrymen." Muhammad         chose
Siyyid yay& Zr&r,      who was residing in ~ehran;to go to %Fr&z
to investigate the Cause of the Bhb because his erudition was
unmatched. He was known to have memorized no less than thirty
thousand traditions of 1slh. On the way to ~hiraz,he planned
the approach.     With his vast knowledge, he was confident that
he could easily overcome the J%b in argument and could induce Him
to retract His claim. He arrived in shlrsz as the guest of no
less a person than the governor himselfTwho felt honored hosting
such a distinguished agent of the king.
Three interviews with the B& were arranged to take place at His
uncle's hme. You can well imagine the temporary joy of the
governor and the excitement in his mansion, soon to be shattered.
Before the first,interview, an old friend of Siyyid ~ahyL,by
the title of '&im, meaning Great, who was a follower of the a,
told Siyyid ~&y&, "Be most considerate and respectful in your
visits or you might regret it the rest of your life."
At the first session the interview lasted about two hours. Siyyid
~ a h y sbrought out one abstruse point after another fran the Qxl&n,
traditions, and the work of the learned. The B& let him present
all of his points, and then one by one, gave brief but convincing
answers to each. This session excited both admiration and humility
in Siyyid ~+ys. In the course of the second interview, Siyyid
Yahyii, to his amazement, discovered that he had forgotten all
of his important questions, so he conversed about unrelated
subjects. To his surprise, he found that the B&b was answering
the questions he had mentarily forgotten. Arrogance had not
vanished yet. He told himself this might have been a mere
coincidence. But he was too agitated to collect his thoughts so
he asked to be excused. Don't you wish you could h~           what he

reported t o t h e governor, s o anxiously waiting f o r h i s conquest.

For the t h i r d and f i n a l interview, he resolved t h a t i n h i s h e a r t
he would request a commentary on Skiy-i-Kawthar, a chapter from
the Qur'Qn, without breathing a word.                   ~ h o u l r t h eEl& reveal it
without being asked i n a manner superior t o other c m e n t a r i e s ,
then he would accept t h e divine character of H i s Cause. H e himself
states, "As soon a s I w a s ushered i n t o H i s presence, a sense of
f e a r suddenly seized m e and my limbs began t o quiver.                  I had never
experienced t h e s l i g h t e s t t r a c e of timidity while i n the presence
of t h e king. I could hardly remain standing on my f e e t . The El&,
noticing my condition, came towards m e and helped m e t o be seated
next t o Him. The J%b s a i d , 'Ask whatever is your h e a r t ' s desire. '
I w a s speechless and powerless to respond.                   H e gazed a t m e and
said, 'should I reveal a comnentary on t h e chapter of Kawthar would
you recognize My Cause a s divine?' T e a r s flowed from my eyes a s
I heard Him u t t e r those words.              H e requested H i s uncle t o bring
h i s pen-case and sane paper.                The speed of H i s writing and t h e
s o f t and gentle murmur of H i s voice bewildered me.                     H e d i d not
pause u n t i l the whole commentary was finished.

For three nights Siyyid ~ & y a d i d not r e t u r n t o t h e governor's
house. H e stayed a s the guest of the BQb's uncle. As instructed
by the E&,   with the help of a s c r i b e , they transcribed and v e r i f i e d
every part of t h a t commentary and found it correct.             When he
returned t o t h e anxious but suspicious governor, he w a s impatiently
questioned about h i s possible conversion, t o which he replied,
"No one but God, Who alone can change t h e h e a r t s of men, is a b l e
t o captivate the h e a r t of Siyyid ~ & y a and whoever ensnares h i s
heart is of God. "

The W's conquest was t o t a l .                Siyyid YaQya became a devoted
follower w i t h t h e t i t l e of ~ a b i d ,meaning t h e Unique One, conferred
upon him by t h e B&b. The c u r t a i n f a l l s , but Siyyid y a y & , behind
the scenes, became one of the g r e a t e s t promoters of the Faith of
t h e B5.b u n t i l i n another v a l i a n t act i n ~ a y r i z , he offered up
h i s l i f e only t e n days before h i s Master, t o join H i m eternally.

How could t h e news of such a momentous conversion be kept from
the outspoken Huj j a t , an e r u d i t e and audacious divine of ~ a n j h .
Huj j a t , whose name was ~ u l l aM@mrunad- 'All, was a s eminent as

veid.      He, who had boldly condemned the whole ecclesiastic
hierarchy frm the four gates to the Twelfth ~ r tonthe humblest
mulla, had to investigate the Cause of the a.He sent Mulls
Iskandar, a trusted man to ~hiraz,who after investigation, return&
with writings of the EGh at a time when a number of divines were
in his lecture roan. As soon as he read same pages form the &Is
writings, he gathered and closed the books and said, "The season
of spring and wine has arrived." He began to s m n frm the
pulpit-top with his penetrating speech all of his followers to
embrace the Cause. He also offered up his life in the path of
his b r d with eighteen hundred companions in Zanjh six months
after the martyrdam of the B&.       id  and Hujjat are among the
brilliant stars of that period.
It is interesting to know that many eminent and uncorrupted divines
at the time of the B&b embraced His Cause, a Cause whose principles
were quite revolutionary in nature. The a ' s severe laws were
meant to undermine the foundations of ai'ih orthodoxy and to clear
the way for the coming of EM'&'u'llid~. As stated by Himself, His
laws were provisional and dependent on acceptance of Bah&'utll&
to Whan He was the Gate. As Muslims expected the Qa'im to appear
with a sword in his hand, the sword of the E&b was His Cause
separating good from evil, and as the Guardian stated, "to
administer a sudden and fatal blow to obsolete and corrupt
institutions."
While under house arrest the a was with His family, and the
believers had easy access to Him.    His mother did not becane a
believer, and sane time after the a ' s departure frcm -  ~hbrz,
she went to Karbils with the a ' s servant, Mdrak.           When
FWh'u'll&h was in Baadad, He sent a few believers who knew her
to visit her and give her the glad tidings.   She became a Baha '1
and thus recognized the station of the One to Whan she had given
birth.
The E&!  spent ~aw-F&z of 1846 in relative peace with His family,
but had foreknowledge of what was ahead. In that s m e r , -He
bequeathed His property jointly to His mother and wife and moved
to Uncle 'Ali's house, for another chapter in His ministry, another   I

breathtaking act,in this moving drama. The call for this curtain
is the Divine intervention.

After the conversion of Siyyid Y&Y&, or ~&ld, the king was heard
to say, "We have heard that our emissary, Siyyid ~&ya, has accepted
the Cause of the B&b. We can no longer ignore that Cause." The
crafty and notorious prime minister, so afraid for the security
of his own position in case of the conversion of the king, sent
an order to the governor of           to kill the El&. The assignment
was delegated by the governor to the police chief, who with his
men in the middle of the night by way of rooftop, entered Uncle
' A l i Is house and arrested the &b. Their instruction and intention
was to take the E& to the governor's house for the shameful act.
As soon as they reached the streets, they found the city in turmoil
with dead bodies being carried towards the city gate. Soon they
learned that the deadly disease of cholera had struck, and the
governor had left the city for safety.
The chief decided to take the B& to his own house when, to his
extreme dismay, he learned that his own son was on his deathbed.
He pleaded with the E&!  not to punish his son for his wrongdoing.
Now it was the hour of dawn, and the &b, in preparation for his
prayer, was performing His ablution. He gave the water from His
ablution to the chief for the son to drink. The police chief was
so overwhelmed with joy at his son's recovery that he sent a message
to the governor to release the B& before the whole province get
wiped out by the disease. The governor responded with his consent,
pending that the B&b itmediately leave the city.
What gratitude for His curing the young man! They did not have
the decency to let Him go hcme and say His final farewell to His
mother and wife. The I&,not wishing to alarm His wife and mother,
sent a message to His uncle to come and see Him. He broke the
news of His inunediate forced departure, and entrusted both His
mother and wife to the uncle's care with expressions of His love
and assurance.
That final farewell, that last embrace with His uncle who had raised
Him, was both overwhelming and revealing. He told His uncle, "I
will meet you again in the mountains of J!d&irb&yj&n    when I will
send you to obtain the crown of martyrdam. I, Myself, will follow
you with one of My loyal disciples and will join you in the realm
of eternity."     In that September of 1846, another chapter was
closed, and a page was turned to a more peaceful chapter.

The spot where He and His disciple were suspended before
the firing squad is marked with an 'x'.

As He directed His steps towards ~ s f a k , once the capital of the
~afavid dynasty, He wrote to the governor, ~aniic&ihr            who
was of Christian background, asking for shelter. Highly impressed
with the hand-delivered letter, he appointed the I&n-Jum4ihof
Isf*    to open his home to the Bgb. Imim-Jurn'ih sent his brother
and people close to him to go some distance in advance to welcome
the I3%, and he, himself, greeted the E&!     at the city gate. He
showed such dedication that instead of asking a servant, he,
himself, poured water on the &'s      hands.    Gatherings of people
of all ranks were held.    The people were so impressed by His words
and superhuman power that in one occasion people came to take
away the water He had used for ablution.         Maniiaihr &&I, the
governor, also paid a visit when he asked the W to write on the
specific station and mission of Maanmad.       Within two hours, He
wrote fifty pages, ending it with the appearance of the Qa'hto
be followed by return of I m h Husayn, which Bah5'u'llgh fulfilled.
The governor, in praise, testified to the superhuman power of the
El&,  and that no learning could match it.         What a difference
between two governors, the typical contrast of g o d and evil.
It is obvious that soon the jealousy of the clergy was aroused.
With reports regularly going to the prime minister, a letter of
reprimand came to the I r r b - Jum'ih for harboring the EL%.  As the
situation tensed up, the governor invited the I3% to his mansion
for a meeting when he decided to keep the      &.      This was forty
days after His arrival in 1sfahh. The divines carried their
hostility to the point of signing the Bgb's death sentence. This
Im&n-Jum'ih, unlike the one in ~hiraz,was somewhat timid and did
not agree with the death sentence because he found the          to be
without reason and judgment (meaning insane). But whatever his
reason, the danger was averted.
ManGchihr K h k became a perfect host to the E5.b Who spent four
peaczul Gths     in a special quarter of his mansion. To mislead
the clergy soon after the EAb went to his mansion, under pretext
of transferring the B& to Tehran with five hundred guards, he
had the EGb return in disguise to his mansion. The rumor was spread
that the E&!  had been executed in Tehran, but many believers, who
on the a ' s instruction had moved to ~sfahh,knew iiis whereabuts
and had access to Him.

The governor was among the very few in influence and wealth which
was estimated at forty million francs, translating into many billion
dollars of today. In spite of all that pomp, he waited in person
on the E5.b and served His meals. He was so devoted to the BSb
that he offered his imnense wealth to the E3&b as well as his army
so they could march to Tehran for a meeting with the king.
He hoped the king, who trusted him so much, would listen and
recognize the truth of the W ' s Cause so it could spread fast
in the country and beyond its borders. To this the B;ib replied,
"May God reward you for your noble intention which to Me is more
precious than the act itself. Your days and Mine are numbered
and too short to witness the realization of your hopes. The triumph
of this Cause will be acccmplished through the poor and lowly of
this land and their blood which will be shed. Of your earthly
life, there remains only three months and nine days."
Maniichihr K h i k died exactly when the E35b had predicted, and although
in h z wilrhe left everything to the El&, his nephew and successor
expropriated everything. MuQammad       m,        being informed of the
whereabouts of the %b, ordered His transfer in disguise to Tehran
for a meeting. In one source, it is mentioned that the El& had
offered to cure the king's uncontrollable and worsening gout.
No doubt, if this is true, the king was more than anxious to meet
the .&I     What did Mirza ~qhs:, the prime minister, think about
all of this?          Well, you need to listen to the rest of the story.
On the way to Tehran, an interesting incident occurred. There
is a city on the way called K&&h in which only two believers
were living; one mjl ~irzaJ&ni, and the other, the famous -dl
in whose honor later on BahS'u'll6h revealed the tablet of m d .
It was right before approaching that city when Mirza J&I~ dreamed
that the %b,      Whom he had never seen, on horseback with others,
was riding towards a certain gate when Mirza            approached the
a,   and   was  told  by the El&, "We will spend Naw-RGz  at your hame
and will be your guest for three days."             Prepare yourself.
Mkza Jcjllli woke up and knew that this was a true dream so he cleaned
the house aid prepared a roam and went by that gate which was called
the gate of '~ttgr. Late in the afternoon, he saw horsemen
approaching and soon discovered that they were guards, and the
Bab, exactly as seen in his dream, was among them.         He went to
kiss the stirrup on the horse of the Ehb, but the BAb prevented
him and told him the same words heard in his dream.

Muhammad Big, t h e chief guard, thought they were old friends and
had no objection t o l e t t h e E6b e n t e r t h e c i t y , but the rest of
t h e guards r e s i s t e d t h e idea, not wishing t o deviate from t h e i r
orders not t o enter any c i t y .         However, ~ a r r u n a d Big persuaded
them t o withdraw t h e i r objection.        ~ i r z a~ib-11i nvited the guards
a l s o t o spend t h e days a t h i s place, but t h e B5b said, "I alone
w i l l come t o your home."         What happened i n those three days and
Alpad seeing h i s Lord f o r the f i r s t time is beyond t h e scope of
t h i s talk.

Back on route, they bypassed Qum, an 1 s l h i c holy c i t y , and on
March 28, arrived a t t h e f o r t r e s s of K i d r - g i r d , only twenty-eight
m i l e s from Tehran. H e r e the a n t i c h r i s t of t h e B&bi isp pens at ion,
H,lji d r z & A ~ & S t~h e     , prime minister, intervened and sent an order
f o r their t r a n s f e r t o t h e v i l l a g e of Kulayn, which was h i s property.
H e t o l d them t o r a i s e h i s own t e n t f o r t h e E&.   It was a delightful
spot, p a r t i c u l a r l y a t t h a t t i m e of year, with orchards and streams.
Days passed without any instruction from Tehran. A few believers
joined t h e               there.      Two believers came from Tehran. Che had
a letter and presents from Bahalu'll&h f o r t h e F&b which brought
H i m g r e a t joy.

One night an unusual incident occurred. A believer recounts t h a t
he woke up with t h e sound of running horses.                   It was some time
a f t e r midnight.  Soon everyone was informed that t h e a ' s t e n t
was vacant. Mdymnad Big, t h e c h i e f , was heard t o scold h i s men
about t h e i r worry regarding H i s possible escape. They a l l began
t o go on t h e road towards Tehran, sane on f o o t and guards on horse-
back, when by the dim l i g h t of dawn they saw t h e d i s t a n t figure
of t h e B& walking towards them. H e t o l d t h e guards, id you
believe I had escaped?" d-                    Big flung himself on the a ' s
f e e t and said, " ~ a rbe it from me. " No one knows what transpired
that night.       The change i n the         a,      t h e serene majesty of H i s
radiant face, t h e power of H i s words, and a remarkable change i n
H i s speech l e f t a question i n everyone's mind, but no one dared
t o question Him.     Could it have been a s p i r i t u a l rendezvous with
Bah&'u'll&? 'Abdu'l-E&         s t a t e s t h a t the two never m e t physically.

Nearly three weeks had passed since t h e i r a r r i v a l when the E&                    I
wrote t o Mulpmad      asking f o r a meeting. But t h e wicked prime
minister had it a l l planned.      H e had unusual persuasive power

over the king. Being so afraid of losing his own position should
that meeting take place, he made the king answer the B& in the
follc".~?ingterms, "Since we are at the verge of departure from
Tehran, a beÂ£itting meeting is not possible. You go to &-KG
and rest there for a while and pray for our prosperity. We will
summon you upon our return." This was in April of 1 847 about three
years since His Declaration.
~ i r z sAq6si was not alone when he made his evil move. The depraved
and mad governor of ~hirsz,who witnessed the conquest of Siyyid
Yay&by the B&b and outbreak of cholera preventing him fram killing
the W, had a lot to say about the powers of the Bib. The B5b
was permitted to take two of His followers with Him.     He chose
two brothers from Yazd, one of whom was a Letter of the Living,
Siyyid Husayn, who became His scribe. The brother, Siyyid Hasan,
became the attendant.
On the road north, one stopping place was a village close to ~azvin,
the birthplace of Ehirih, the only wcrnan in the eighteen Letters
of the Living. Di His one night stay there, He wrote a letter
to the prime minister and the divines. Mull& Iskandar, the trusted
attendant of the audacious Hujjat, visited the Bib there and was
given a letter to be delivered to a fervent supporter of Siyyid
Gzim who was in Zanjh. In it, the l3h.b stated His station and
told him to arise and deliver Him from the hand of the oppressor.
That man received the letter but did not heed it. At that time
Hujjat was in Tehran under surveillance. The mcment he received
information about the content of the letter, he sent a message
to ~ a n j hfor the Bibis to march and rescue the  &.       A sizeable
number of %is      from Zanj&-I and @zvin reached the m ' s stopping
place, and when the guards were asleep, they informed the B& about
their intention, but the E6b told them that He would not run away
and stated, "The mountains of Addir&yj;n,     too, have their claims.I'
Before the end of his assignment, the chief of guards,
Muharrunad Big, became a believer in the Thb, and later his son became
a &ha 'i. Grief-stricken, he apologized and begged for forgiveness
for any shortcoming in his care.
As they were leaving the last stop in M h h , a small village before
~abriz,an incident happened quite worthy of mentioning. An old
woman brought a child whose head was covered with scabs. She was

trying to get to the Lhb, but the guards prevented her when the
E6b told them not to interfere. She came close and begged Him
to heal the child. He opened a handkerchief, laid it on the child's
head and repeated certain words. When the handkerchief was removed,
the child's head was healed. In that place two hundred people
became sincere believers. The Brib did it as a mercy to the child
and not as a miracle.     ~ah~'u'll&h stated that claiming miracles
as a proof of a Manifestation of God degrades His station.
Another time, as the journey to ~abriz was coming to an end,
possibly to show sane humor, the E5.b galloped His scrawny horse
so fast that the guards with much stronger horses could not catch
up with Him. They were overtaken with apprehension that at this
stage of travel He might escape. Then He stopped the horse and
when they reached Him, with a smile He told them that if He wished
to escape, no one could stop him.
His entry into ~abrizwas scmething to behold. The streets were
crded. Among this mass were a number of His followers who were
seeing Him for the first time. The cry of All&-u-Akbar, God is
the Greatest, echoed throughout the city, which alarmed the
officials. Soon criers warned the people against attempting to
see Him. He was kept there strictly secluded for forty days.
Another page is turned to a new chapter of His captivity.
The prime minister had it well planned.      The fortress of M&I-K~
to which He was transferred was the choicest prison as far as the
prime minister was concerned. It was as hot in s m e r as it was
cold in winter. It was on the side of the mountain with a massive
rock overhang so one could not see the sky above. That is where
the name W - K G comes from.         means moon and k6 means where
is, together means "where is the moon?''
There could not have been anywhere else in Iran less friendly.
The town at the foot of the mountain was the prime minister's
birthplace so its inhabitants were quite devoted to him and did
their best to please him. Add to this another factor. They were
of the ~unnisect of ~ s l h ,

a minority in Iran. They had animosity
towards the      ih sect, particularly those who were descendants
of the Imhs, which the E&b was, because they do not believe in
Imhs as true successors to -d.            To complete the package,

'dlKhAn, who was a Kurd, was the warden of the prison, very rough
and arrogant. Surely, with all of these factors plus its remote ,
location, the & b a s isolation would be total, and out of sight,
out of mind. Well! He was dead wrong.
Let the curtain rise to another captivating act in this drama.
This is another theater. The Guardian calls &&irb&yj&
the theater of agony and martyrdom.
that fortress in the picture, you can't believe that its occupants,
as stated by the a,
His solitary room did not have a door, neither was there a lighted '
lamp after dark. To tell you about winter, it is enough to know
that when He did ablution before saying His prayers, water froze
on His blessed face. What you are about to hear is one act of
many in that fortress. It happened two weeks after His arrival.
The warden was so mean and tough that he would not permit any
followers of the E!&b to stay in town even for one night. They
slept in a mosque outside the town.
ShayK Ijasan-i-~uniizl,arrived, he was treated like the rest of
-
the followers. The attendant of the a,

Shaykh
-   - Ijasan to the B i b .
these seceret contacts were to end and promised that He (the I%b)
will instruct ' A l l K&&n,
and go as they wished. They were quite astonished, knowing the
attitude and character of 'All
The a ' s attendant recounts that the next morning at dawnL they
were awakened by loud pounding on the castle door with 'Ali sh
shouting to the guards to open the door. Soon to our surprise,
one guard came and requested that the warden wished to see the
B5b. The warden was visibly shaking. He threw himself at the
feet of the EGb and begged to be relieved of his misery.

of me. I was suddenly seized with fear about interrupting your
prayer, so I decided to cane to the fortress to scold the guards
for their disobedience and neglect.    I found out that both doors
were locked and you are here. Maybe I have lost my mind. "
The E&b told him, "What you have witnessed is true. You belittled
this Cause and its Author.    God, through His mercy, has revealed
this to your eyes so to save you from punishment by recognizing
the power of His Cause." All the arrogance vanished. A humble

'Ali Kh&n was recreated. The first words he said were, "A poor
man i syearning to attain Your presence. He lives in a mosque
outside the town. I beg to be allowed to bring him to Your
presence." So Shaykh Hasan, as foretold by the B&, was brought
to His presence b y 'Al'1 -,       and the gates opened for all
believers, including Mull5 Husayn, who came on foot, traveling
hundreds of miles. He celebrated Naw-RGz of 1848 in the presence
of His Beloved.
The revelation of the Mother Book, the Persian Bay&, began in
that fortress and was canpleted in the early part of His captivity
in the fortress of Bihriq. As He revealed it, according to one
believer, His chanting echoed on the mountainside. What an enchant-
ment for the hostile inhabitants of the town of W-KG who now
showed utmost reverence towards the I%b. Their morning began by
gazing towards the fortress and receiving the W ' s blessing.
Presently, there is a copy of the Persian Bay* in the handwriting
of His scribe, the Letter of the Living, Siyyid Husayn, at the
Bah6'i International Archives in Haifa, Israel.

'~1iKhh's devotion was such that he begged the &!I         to honor him
by ma=ing    his daughter whom he had refused to give in marriage
to the crown prince. He even went to the extent of asking Mull&
Husayn, during his visit, to intercede on his behalf, but of no
avail. As if ' A l l *'s        devotion and the town people's reverence
towards the E!&,        regularly reported by the agents to the prime
minister, was not enough to boil him with rage, the ultimatum of
the Russian minister in Tehran topped it off. It is interesting
that Prince Dolgorukov, who four years later offered asylum in
Russia to Bah&'u'll&h upon His release fran the siy&h-~&l, now
showed alarm of his country about the flow of the people near the
border, where M & - ~ i i was located.

The desperate pr*     minister, his plans well frustrated, chose
the fortress Chihriq in another mountain and ordered the &b's
transfer. 'I'hi.happened shortly after Mulla Husayn 's visit and
nine months after the E&'s       imprisonment in the fortress of
M&-KG   which He had named ~abal-i-%sit or the Open Mountain.
The transfer took place in April of 1 848, a most memorable month
for the brigadier who was in charge of this transfer. It should
not surprise you that he became an overzealous believer in the
BSb. Now you can realize how the history was written. High and
low, f r m learned clergy to the ruthless wardens and guards, were
a11 captivated by the a,   embraced His Cause and first-hand related
the accounts of the period when the EGb was near them.
As in this theater of captivity and agony, the stage of martyrdom
gets closer, the beat of the drums get faster and louder. What
a moving history. Who could do justice to it. I feel unworthy
and incapable of relating such imnense happenings to you.
Shall we turn the page to another chapter? Don't even think of
feeling sad for the Biib. He knew the whole thing before it
occurred. He begged God to be accepted as a sacrifice in the path
of Baha'u811&h. The suffering was only for His human side when
He experienced His agonies. His spirit transcended them all.
Now He is handed over to yay5 &-i-Kurd,        the warden of the
fortress of ~lihriq. aihriq was called by Him ~abal-i-@did
or the Grievous Mountain. The warden was a Kurdish chieftain whose
sister was married to the king. He was harsh and unpredictable.
His loyalty was not in question, being an in-law to the, king.
Soon he was captivated by the same power that made 'Ali
spellbound. So many -is      came to the fortress that it was
inpssible to house them in town and they had their accdations
in another town.
The next three scenes are part of the act which boggles the mind
and drove the prime minister out of his mind.     There is a town
not too far f r m ~ i h r i qcalled guy.   Not too long after the
a ' s incarceration in gihriq, a number of prominent citizens
of Euy, fran divines to officials, became &is.    ~lrzahadu'l'&
was a proud man, high in the government.   He had a vast knowledge
and fluent pen as well as mastery of five languages which was
unusual in that area. He was quite hostile and loud when the %is

attempted to convert him. Then he had a dream which induced him
to write to the Ehb. Before he wrote the letter he concentrated
on two verses from the Qur'an, and wrote to the BQb that he had
certain things in his mind, and if the E&b could write him what
they were. The W answered in His own handwriting about his dream,
what it was about, as well as the two verses from the ~ ' h .
The exactness and precision of the answer brought him such
unshakeable certitude that he refused to ride a horse to climb
the steep mountain to attain the presence of the El&.    There he
gave the Edb his devoted allegiance.    His father was a personal
friend of the prime minister. Such zeal and fervor alarmed his
father who wrote to the prime minister. The &b gave the title
of ~ y y hwhich means the conqueror or the judge to drza
Asadulll& and later honored him with a tablet.
In another scene, a distinguished and holy-looking dervish arrived
on foot from India, the eastern neighbor of Iran. Many followers
of the a    honored and revered him. He said he was a naw& in
India (like a spiritual leader) when the B i b appeared in a vision
and told him #to leave everything behind and come on foot to meet
Him in Chihriq in the mountains of PlhirGyj&n. The BQb gave
him the title of Qahru1ll& and instructed him to go back on foot
to his native land. Well, this easily showed that the extent of
the &Is   spiritual powers went way beyond the borders of Iran.
All of the ordinary plans of the evil prime minister did not work
against this extraordi,nary ,Being, the B&b.     You see, when the
prime minister, @ji Mirzs Aqasi, is called the antichrist of the
E&bi Dispensation, it means he really knew who the B5b was, but
yet so proudly wished to show his own ascendancy. But as it was
decreed, every move he did accelerated his own downfall, materially
and spiritually. At this time one blow came after another to drzs
~ ~ a s i .The health of the king, only forty-three years old, was
rapidly deteriorating, and not being sure of his own standing,
the prime minister decided to put an end to the B& by official
examination by the divines in the presence of the seventeen-year-
old crown prince for the purpose of condemning the El& to execution.
The &b had been in the fortress of ai@riq only three months when
an order came for His transfer to Tabriz, the provincial capital;
but, by all means, the guards had to avoid the town of g u y where

He had many followers. Are you ready for the third scene of this
awe-+spiring      act?    It was decided to take Him through
u.&yyih,     a town near the lake by the same name. Here the governor
received the &b reverently, but his mischievous nature wished
to pose a test to his Guest. On Friday when the Fi5b decided to
go to the public bath, the governor ordered a particularly unruly
horse to be brought. Everyone who heard about this plan was present
to' watch what they expected to be an unsuccessful struggle of the
EGb to stay on the wild horse. Miraculously, the horse stood
quietly for the E&b to mount him and carried the Fi5b gently to
the bath. The governor was so ashamed that he walked on foot next
to the horse until the l3& asked him to return home.        After the
bath, people rushed to the bathhouse and took every drop of the
&Is     bath water as sacred water.
The governor's house became the focal place and had never seen
such a flow of people. It was there that an official artist wanted
just to see the  a,    but upon seeing the E6b posing, he felt that
the B;ib wished for His portrait to be drawn. The only portraits
of the       in black and white and later in water color are from
that incident.     How would you like to receive that news as the
prime minister?
It was in the summer of 1 848 when the BLib was brought to ~abriz
for interrogation. Before leaving the fortress, He told a believer
to collect all of His writings from the two fortresses and give
them to a believer in ~abrizfor safekeeping.     In this last scene
of *is act, you will witness a dramatic move in the history in
Tabriz, the provincial capital of Ad&ir&yjiin,    and in the same
summer hundreds of miles away in a resort place near Tehran called
Badasht. Yes, in that memorable year of 1848 so many things
happy&ed which is beyond the scope of this talk.
It was at the end of July when the        was brought to the seat
of the government at a meeting of the top divines of the province
in the presence of the crown prince, not yet at the meeting.
To intimidate the B&b in this mock trial, they had not placed a
chair for the &, expecting Him to stand while being questioned.
He went straight for the special chair reserved for the prince.
Soon after the prince arrived, upon questioning of the presiding
clergy, a public proclamation took place. He declared three times,

"I am the @'im for Whom you have waited one thousand years, and
you rise upon mention of His name."     Soon the clergy began their
foolish questioning about Arabic g r m r from the Revealer of
~aW;nu'l-Asma', containing one hundred ten chapters all in Arabic
and numerous other writings. Shortly after, to put an end to their
abuse, He got up and left without being officially dismissed.
Now they had to do something about it, or His ascendancy easily
would be established. A sentence of death was close, if the
physicians were to report that He was sane.       This was the time
that the only Westerner came in contact with the                   &.
Dr. McCodck, a Christian missionary from England, with two Persian
physicians, examined the E3&.   Their report was such to save His
life. Dr. McCormickls is the only pen portrait by a Westerner,
describing the B6b as a very mild and delicate-looking man, rather
small in stature and very fair for a Persian.       He also mentions
His melodious soft voice which he states "struck me much."
The verdict was to punish the El& by bastinado which the official
attendant refused to do, but a clergy volunteered for it. In the
process of striking His feet, one rod hit Him on the face which
caused injury and a physician had to be called. The EGb indicated
His desire for Dr. McCormick to treat him for a few days.
The clergy who inflicted the bastinado, in the same year, became
paralysed and died after enduring most excruciating pain.
The same summer under the direction of ~ ~ ' u ' l l ainh the conference
at Badasht, ~&irih, that irrpnortal heroine, declared the advent
of the New Day when she appeared without a veil. With leadership
of &'ulll&,      a clear separation was made from Islh. After
all, the B&'s    Faith was an independent religion, and its Holy
Book was just completed, abrogating all of the 1slhic laws.
The E6b was returned to the fortress of Chihriq on the first day
of August 1848. F'rm there, He wrote K&@iy-i-Qdriyyih,    or the
S m n of Wrath, to the prime minister which has hand-delivered
to him by Hujjat.
By this time the death. of m          d sh& was near, and the prime
minister had fallen.      manunad w-died        ,in September of 1848,
and in less than a year the despicable Ij$i drza ~ ~ a s ideposed ,
of his position and h ~ e n s ewealth, died in obscurity in Iraq.

The first page of the new chapter of the last two years in the
life of the El& is so connected to the last page that we can
recognize how these pages were written by the same Author, the
Divine Pen.
When the EGb was taken to ~abriz,there was a young man called
ML$wuM~-'M~ ~uniizi who wished so badly to see a glimpse of
the 6 b . However, the demonstration of his uncontrollable love
provoked his parents to the point that they locked him in his roam
during the days of the E& 's examination in Tabriz .     His relative,
- -
Shaykh  Ijasan-i-~uniizi, who   was  the one   '~1i KhAn took to the
presence of the rn in J!JI&-K~,    relates the follang, awe-inspiring
story. "Following the return of the l%b to Chihriq, I went to
visit my relatives in Tabriz when I noticed-such          a change in  ,
M&ammad-'All. He was happy and at peace. To my inquiry about Ii
such unusual change, the youth stated, 'One day as I was confined
in my room, I turned my heart to Him and implored Him to dispel / '

,
my gloam. What tears of agony that I shed that hour.          I was so j
overcome with emotion that I seemed to have lost consciousness.
Suddenly, I heard the voice of the           calling me.   He told me
to arise. He smiled as He looked into my eyes. I rushed forward
and flung myself at His feet when He said, "Rejoice, the hour is
approaching when in this very city, I shall be suspended before
the eyes of the multitude and shall fall a victim to the fire of       '
the enemy. I shall choose no one except you to share with me the
cup of martyrdom. Rest assured that this promise shall be
fulfilled." What a revealing page! Two years before His martyrdom t
in that vision, He told the youth how He would be martyred.            I
In those two years many events transpired. Of course, the flow
of His followers was uninterrupted, the most special was His Uncle
l

Ali to whom He had foretold their oncoming meeting as He was taken
from zlraz. The visit of the uncle who raised Him as a child
brought great joy to Him, but within a few months after the uncle's
visit towards June of 1849, the news of the massacre in S&aykh
~abarsi,including nine Letters of the Living, among them Mulz
Husayn and add& (the first and the last), brought Him unbearable
sorrow. You need to know that after his visit, the uncle went
to Tehran, and with six other &is,       was beheaded - the crown of
martyrdom that the B;ib had promised him.

The a ' s s c r i b e s t a t e s t h a t a f t e r the E&b received the news of
Shaykh
-      - ~ a b a r s i , the grief silenced H i s voice and s t i l l e d H i s pen.
For nine days H e refused t o meet w i t h anyone and would not touch
any food o r drink. Tears rained continually from H i s eyes. For
f i v e months H e languished. H e c m u n e d i n the privacy of H i s c e l l ,
and when I t r i e d t o j o t down the effusions of H i s sorrow a s they
poured f o r t h from H i s wounded heart, H e instructed m e t o destroy
them. You see t h i s was H i s human s i d e which lamented s o deeply.
With the death of M*ammad         Sh& i n 1848, t h e crown prince took
the throne a s N5siri1d- in                and h i s prime minister was the

This curtain rises t o t h e f i n a l a c t i n t h e g r e a t drama, such a s
history had never witnessed before. Conscious of H i s own end f a s t
approaching, t h e B& put a l l H i s writings, pen case, seals and
rings i n a box, and through a Letter of t h e Living, sent them t o
Baha1u'll&.        Included was a very f i n e l y written three hundred
s i x t y derivatives of the word Bahh i n t h e shape of a pentacle.
During the l a s t few months of H i s c a p t i v i t y i n t h a t f o r t r e s s , H e
revealed t h e Arabic ~ a y h .

Now is t h e midsummer of 1850, t o be exact, t h e f i r s t days of July.
Amir-Nizh s e n t t h e order t o t h e governor, m i h d r z d , t o transfer
the B6.b t o Tabriz which he did.           Then the second order came t o
execute t h e B& which W z i h d r z 6 refused t o do. ?tro years e a r l i e r
i n another province, Ijamzih Mhza had admired Mulla Husayn and
had given great consideration towards him.          H e absolutely refused
t o slay an innocent descendant of t h e prophet. Am&-Nizh assigned
h i s own brother, who was t h e messenger t o the governor, t o carry
out t h e task.

The W's green turban and sash which indicated H i s lineage were
removed by t h e attendants who took Him on foot from the house *e
governor had put a t H i s disposal t o t h e barracks. On the way t o

t h e barracks, a barefoot youth threw himself a t t h e f e e t of the
Ei&,   beseeching Him, "send me. not f r a n Thee, 0 Master, wherever
Thou goest s u f f e r m e t o follow Thee."   The B5b replied, "M&amnad-

'Ali, a r i s e and rest assured that you w i l l be w i t h Me. Tomorrow
you s h a l l witness what God has decreed."         A s you r e c a l l , t h i s
had been p r a i s e d t o him two years earlier i n a vision and f o r ~ t o l d
about four years earlier when H e s a i d H i s farewell t o Uncle 'Mi.

That night i n that room by the square of t h e barracks, t h e E&
w a s joyous.     H i s mission, i n s p i t e of t h e opposition and tyrannies,
was f u l l y accomplished, and t h e next day, to t h e utmost d e s i r e
of H i s heart, H e would be s a c r i f i c e d i n t h e path of 13aha'u111&.
H e t o l d His d i s c i p l e s on H i s last night on earth, t h a t H e preferred
t o meet H i s death a t the hand of a friend r a t h e r than a t t h e hand:
of t h e enemy which dumbfounded H i s d i s c i p l e s . Only M a m d - ' A l i
dared t o accept the t a s k as h i s companions t r i e d t o r e s t r a i n him.
The B5b s a i d , "This very youth who has r i s e n t o comply with My
wish w i l l , together with M e , s u f f e r martyrdom. H i m w i l l I choose
t o share with me its crown."                 Then H e added, "verily, -d-
'Ali w i l l be with U s i n paradise."            What a p r i c e l e s s bounty.

The sun h e s i t a t i n g l y arose t h a t infamous s m e r day, but by noon
covered its face t o t h e shameful crime c m i t t e d by men similar
t o t h a t day on Calvary centuries before. The E&I instructed H i s
s c r i b e and h i s brother t o recant t h e i r f a i t h t o be able t o r e l a t e
t h e f i n a l events and words f o r p o s t e r i t y . The s c r i b e , SiyyidHusayn-
i-Yazdi, l a t e r was martyred during t h e blood-bath of Tehran i n
1852, t h e year 13aha'u111& w a s put i n t h e siy&-Chal.                     As t h e E?&
was talking t o H i s scribe, the chief attendant came, pushing the
s c r i b e aside, and s a i d he had t o take t h e I3& f o r H i s death sentence
from the clergy. The E3& t o l d him, " ~ o tu n t i l I am finished, even
i f a l l t h e armaments of the world arise against M e , they would
be incapable t o d e t e r m e f r a n what I have t o do. I' The attendant
ignored H i s admonishment and took Him and the* youth f o r their
sentencing. This walk through the streets of Tabriz was i n contrast
t o H i s entry i n t o the c i t y three years earlier. A s they went from
house t o house, each clergy refused t o see t h e &b face-to-face
and had the death warrant signed and sealed, ready t o give t o t h e
attendant. The s t e p f a t h e r of the youth t r i e d t o persuade him t o
change h i s mind by bringing h i s young boy t o him but h i s resolve
remained unshaken.

While they were taken for their death sentence, the commander of
the Armenian regiment, S&n   m,     who had the assignment for the
execution, ordered his regiment of seven hundred fifty men to the
square, but felt more and more uneasy about the task.
On that July 9, 1850, close to noon, the F3&     and the youth were
returned to the square. S5m         could no longer resist the voice
of his conscience. The prisoner looked kind and compassionate
and, after all, He had not done any crime.      So he approached the
E&   and said, "I am a Christian and have nothing against you.
If your Cause is divine, enable me to free myself from the
obligation to shed your blood." To this, the &b replied, "~ollow
your instructions. If your intention is sincere, the Almighty
is surely able to relieve you from your perplexity."
The square and surrounding rooftops were packed with ten thousand
spectators. A nail was driven in the wall to which the I3& and
His disciple were suspended with ropes. At the youth's request,
his head was placed on the chest of his Master to shield it.
The soldiers were lined in three rows. The order was given.
One row fired after another. When the smoke of t$e musket guns
lifted, the E3& had disappeared and l4&md-'Ali was standing
by the wall under the nail, smiling and unconcerned. The onlookers
cried, "~iyyid-i-E!&  &c 'ib &ud. l1  "~iyyid-i-Bibhas gone fran
our sight." A frantic search followed. The E3& was found in the
same rocm He had spent His last night, finishing His earlier
interrupted conversation with His scribe. He told the chief
attendant, "Now I am finished. Carry on your duty." He remembered
the words of the EGb earlier, and terror-stricken, ran away and
resigned his post. S6.m  m,    also stunned, removed his men from
the square and refused to repeat it even if his refusal meant the
loss of his own life.
hqg J&-i-~amsih, a Muslim, volunteered to perform the shameful
act. As his regiment lined up for firing, they tied up the E?&
and the youth in the same manner on the same spot. The E?&
addressed the crowd with these final words, "0 wayward generation!
Had you believed in Me, every one of you would have followed the
example of this youth, who stood in rank above most of you, and
willingly would have sacrificed himself in My path. The day will
come when you will have recognized Me; that day, I shall have ceased
to be with you."

A t noon on July 9, 1850, seven hundred f i f t y b u l l e t s united t h e i r
two bodies but t h e face of the                     was untouched. The c u r t a i n

surrounding t h e c i t y with guards stationed,               Next morning t h e
Russian consul took an artist who made a drawing of the remains.
Sulaymh ~~, t h e prominent and f a i t h f u l d i s c i p l e who had a t t a i n e d

and through h i s help, t h e bodies were rescued under t h e eyes of
t h e guards and taken by Sulayrniin e n t o a s i l k factory of a
i n ilk. They were enshrouded and hidden under bales of s i l k ,
and t h e next day placed i n a wooden casket and carried away t o
