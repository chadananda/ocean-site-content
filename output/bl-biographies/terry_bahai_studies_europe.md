> **About:** In 1980-1981, Peter Terry spent several months in Europe, interviewing Bahá'í scholars and cataloging the Babi and Bahá'í literature in selected private and public Bahá'í archives and university and national libraries. Upon his return to the USA, he compiled his notes and self-published them in this document "Report on Bahá'í Studies in Europe". The book has not been updated or edited in any way since its original publication in 1981.
