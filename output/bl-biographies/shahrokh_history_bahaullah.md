HISTORY OF    BAHA   U'LL~H
A transcript of audio-cassette from series

WINDOWS TO THE PAST
By Darius K. Shahrokh, M.D.

Regardless how hard one tries, it will be impossible for any speaker
to portray and capture the true spirit of the majestic and yet
tragic events of the life of Bah5'ufll&h.

This presentation will approach the history of the life of
Bah6'u1ll2h from different angles, in hope of giving you a glimpse
of what actually transpired.     We have less than one minute to
talk about every year of His life which lasted seventy-five years,
forty years of which were His ministry.

Let us go back in time about one hundred fifty years, and review
a few events in Tehran and Ba&d&d         in the nineteenth century.
Tehran, as it is now, was the capital of Iran, known to Westerners
as Persia. Ba&d&d        is the provincial capital of Iraq. Iraq is
like a state or province of the great Ottman or Turkish Empire.
The year is 1839 and we are in Tehran. The king is the inept
Muhammad -

Shah who depends so much on his crafty and notorious prime
minister, ~ &i ~ji r z aA ~ G S ~ .
A prominent member of the court, ~irz; Buzurg, from Nur has died
and must be replaced. As is customary, his po5ition is ofzer~d
to his most qualified son. One of his sons, Mirza Husayn- Ali,
though only twenty-two years old, seems to excel not only in
knowledge and wisdom but also in character. Matter of fact, the
prime minister has watched Him first hand when He represented His
fathe; in a court( case. The prime ministerfs deputies pay a visit
to Mirza Husayn- ~ l i ,and offer him the position. Disappointed,
they return to the prime minister with negative response. The prime
minister is not quite pleased, and somewhat puzzled as to why anyone
in sane mind would refuse such a profitable position. He was heard

to tell his deputies, "I cannot understand Him. Leave Him to
Himself. He has greater aims in mind." Only if he had known who
this young nobleman really was.
About ten years later in a port town by the Caspian Sea called
Bandar Gaz, in a beautiful early fall afternoon, a big reception
is on its way in the honor of a well-known nobleman visiting that
town. There is a rumor that he has joined a new movement called
the ~ a b iFaith, but so what, there are so many sects of Isliim,
and this seems to be another sect. He still believes in Muhammad,
so it does not matter. It is His magnetic personality and charisma
which shines like a jewel and attracts every one. All dignitaries
are invited. Among them is a Russian officer. Russia, being a
strong neighboring country, has a tremendous authority and influence
over the government of Iran.
Before the reception begins, a messenger on horseback arrives from
Tehran, handing the urgent and shocking message to the mayor.
After reading it, with a pale face, the mayor looks at the
messenger, who states, "It is true. I am told that the king has
stated, 'I can no longer stand the activities of ~ i r z 6~usa~n-'~li.
He must be arrested wherever He may be, and brought to the capital
for execution. '" What is the mayor to do? Consulting with his
deputies, they decide that the nobleman will not run away. Might
as well not spoil the reception, and handcuff Him after the
reception is over. They see to it that after He enters the mansion,
the guards would prevent Him from leaving.      The reception starts
on time, and as usual, everyone praises each other, but carefully
worded praise for the nobleman. After all, they are all the king's
men.   The Russian officer, hearing the word from one of the
deputies, approaches the nobleman, telling Him the message for
His arrest, and offers his ship which is anchored at the port as
asylum. But to his utmost surprise, the nobleman declines his
offer, stating no need to worry, everything will be all right.
It doesn't make sense to the officer, why anyone should refuse
such a generous offer, and willingly walk into a death trap.

Well! Before the reception is over, another messenger arrives
with the news that Muhammad Shah had died, the prime minister gone
into hiding, and the capital is in turmoil. The reception ends
happily, and the order is not carried out. You see! It was not

the king who was tired of the nobleman, ~ i r z 6~usa~n-'Ali, but
it was God who was displeased with MuPammad 3 5 h and could not
stand him any longer. He and his prime minister had to go. They
already had caused the Bib, the fruit of the tree of Divine
Revelation, to be imprisoned, and then brought to Tabriz for
examination which was followed by bastinado.      In the process of
bastinado, we recall His blessed face was struck, and now they
were planning to destroy the future bearer of the Light of God.
About three years later, the heavy-handed new prime minister, ~ i r z i
~ a - ~hfin-i-~mir

~ i        ~abir,who brought the young king, ~gsiri'd- in-
Sh5h,
-      to the throne,  and already had executed the Bgb, now wishes
to control Mirza ~ u s a ~ n - ' ~ l ~ ' s

activities. He has witnessed how
a group of three hundred BGbis valiantly defended themselves for
seven months against the well-equipped royal army of ten to twenty
thousand men, much better equipped with arms.
He tells the nobleman, who is now about thirty-three or thirty-
four years old, "It was your leadership and intelligence that helped
so few a number of ~ 6 b i sin Shayg Tabarsi keep the strong royal
army frustrated for nearly seven mc?ths. It would be so helpful
to the country and please his majesty if you would use your talent
in the service of his majesty, and accept the post of ~ m i r~iv&n,
or the head of the court system, which is a prestigious position
with side benefits, which we know is extortion and bribes.       The
nobleman denies having anything to do with the defense at Fort
S h a y B ~abarsi, and gives the credit to selfless dedication of
-
the believers, and declines the offer.    Well, this prime minister
had the blood of the BAb on his hands, and within a year was deposed
by the king whom he had brought to the throne. His vein was opened
in the bath, and his life slowly oozed away.

Now it is four or five years later, and we are in Ba&d&d,     which
I told you is the provincial capital of Iraq, one of the provinces
of the powerful Turkish Empire. As background information, the
B5b was executed in 1850, and two years later, three deranged and
revengeful ~ A b iyouth tried to kill the young king, which failed.
The nobleman, with about thirty other prominent ~ 6 b ileaders, was
put into the underground dungeon called the siy6h-Ch&l, or the
Black Pit. Nearly all other prominent leaders were put to d$ath
with unspeakable brutality, but somehow the nobleman, Mirz6

~usa~n-'Ali, was found to be innocent from plotting the attempt
on the life of the king, and was freed, pending His immediate exile
to Ba&ddd,     His luxurious mansion had been ransacked, and all
of His properties confiscated by the government. To purchase very
inadequate provisions for the travel of the family in the dead
of winter over icy and snowbound mountain passes of western Iran,
His wife had plucked the jeweled buttons off some of her dresses
before the mob attacked their mansion.       She sold these to buy
the scant equipment for their travel. The nobleman was recovering
from typhoid fever, a deadly disease, and leech wounds on his ankles
from the ankle-deep muck of the dungeon.      Under severe hardship,
they arrived in Ba&ddd,    and the next act of this great drama is
a few years after their arrival.

If you wish to watch it closely, all men must wear turban and women,
the famous Gador, or veil, peeking with one eye.
The nobleman is settled in a house, although not a mansion, but
it has become the focal point of people from all walks of life,
from Persian princes in exile to Christian, Jewish, and Muslim
clergy or laymen. Material comfort is not there anymore. Matter
of fact, His household barely makes the ends meet.     If tea is
served, make sure you don't take too much sugar. It is expensive.
We are in His reception room filled with people, some regulars,
and some for the first time. You are among the first-timers, but
I have been here before. The outpouring of the nobleman's wondrous
words, illuminating any subject, has left everyone spellbound.
Of a few large-turbaned clergy, there is one who appears quite
restless, and has, something on his mind.   Who is he?    His name
is Mull5 Hasan-i-AmG, and is sent here by the doctors of Islhm
and clergy of the two holy cities of KarbilA and Najaf, the home
of the largest theological schools of IslAm about fifty miles from
Ba&d&d.   Are you with me or lost in wonderment?       Mull6 Hasan
is seated on the floor like the rest, but gradually inches his
way closer to the nobleman, and requests a private audience.

We are not permitted to be there anymore, but can hear the
conversation through the door. Mull6 Hasan, already being highly
impressed by the nobleman's eloquence and authority, humbly speaks
in a very low voice. We can't hear him so we put our ears to the

door. If your turban is in your way, push it to the side; they
can't see us. He states, "I represent the chief clergy from the
two holy cities. T4ey have sent me to state     ..."  Well! We know
all of that, but come on, cough out the message. "Well, They
acknowledge your superior knowledge and unmatched wisdom, even
though you have not had any formal schooling, but they cannot easily
acknowledge your Cause and accept it. Only if perchance you could
perform a miracle or two to satisfy them."
We wish we could see the look on the nobleman's face. Mulli Hasan's
face is seen through the keyhole. He is pale, quivering, and
looking at the nobleman's feet.   After a pause, the nobleman begins
to speak with such authority that it vibrates the building.       He
states, "It is not your right to ask such a thing.        It is for
God to test His people, and not for the people to test God." Now
His voice becomes merciful. "But since you asked it, we are willing
to perform a miracle pending on two conditions. One is that all
the clergy get together and agree on one miracle (listen to this)
regardless of what it may be." You see, this is an open offer.
"The second condition is that a letter should be written, signed
and sealed, that should I perform the miracle they choose, without
hesitation, they must accept and acknowledge the Cause for which
I stand; and, if not performed, I be condemned as an imposter.
The Cause of God cannot become a plaything of children, every day
someone asking for a certain performance."
Mull6 asks permission to be dismissed.     He kisses the nobleman's
knees and says, "I am satisfied." Make a guess about the clergys'
response. Not only could they not agree about one miracle, but
they became afraid of His power and backed off.
Mlrz& Husayn- (Ali, the nobleman from Ncr , was known to His followers
as JinBb-i-Bah5, meaning His Honor Bah5.         Bah; is the name He
adopted for Himself in the Conference of Badaat teq years earlier
when He conferred the title of ~ihirihon Qurratu'l-Ayn, and QuddGs

- the last Letter of the Living.

to Mull5 Muhammad-i-~iirfurfishi,
Jingb-i-Bah6 was quite reluctant to show the power and glory which
was concealed within Himself to those who wished to test Him, but
at times, showed a measure of it to those who believed in Him to
confirm and transform them.

While in Baeddd, one day as He was walking with a few followers
a few steps behind Him, an officer approached Him, and said, "one
of your followers has been murdered and his body has been thrown
by the river."   ~ingb-i-Bahsstated, "He was not murdered. Through
70,000 veils of light, to an extent smaller than a needle's eye,
We showed him the Glory of God, and he no longer could bear the
burdyn of this life. He ended his own life." This person was Siyyid
Ism5 il-zav&rili, whom Bah&'ulll&h honored with the title of -

~ habih,
or Sacrifice.
Who was MirzG ~usa~n-'~li,  the nobleman from NGr, also known as
Jingb-i-BahA? He was not an ordinary man, a mystic, nor a magician.
He was the embodiment of the Glory of God.           His name was
Bah6'ufll&h, meaning the Glory of God, the Supreme Manifestation,
the Inaugurator of the Day of God, and the Promised One of all
religions.

He was born on November 12, 1817, in Tehran to a noble and prominent
family from the town of NCr. As a baby, He never cried. The
stories of His childhood and youth testify to His having superior
and innate knowledge and wisdom.       At age eighteen, He married
hsiyih KhGnum, the daughter of another wealthy statesman.       When
twenty-tTo years old, His father, MirzA ~uzur~-i-~Gri,  passed away,
and his position as minister in the royal court was offered to
Him which He declined.

His family and Himself belonged to the ~hi'ih sect of IslAm, but
at age twenty-seven He accepted the claim of the B6b who claimed
to be the return of the Twelvth 1m6m, called the Qh'im, and also
being the Gate, or the BAb, to yet a greater Manifestation to come.
BahG'u'll5h1s ancestry goes to the last king, Yazdigird, from
S6ss5nian dynasty, and thus to Zoroaster, the prophet of ancient
Iran.

In the course of promoting the Faith of the Bgb, He was imprisoned
three times and bastinadoed once. The third imprisonment was in
the Black Pit, or the ~i~6h-C&&l, of Tehran along with thirty other
BGbis whose prison-mates were one hundred fifty of the worst
criminals. This was on August 15 of 1852, when He was arrested
on accusation of conspiracy to kill the king. Barehead and barefoot

A t a n o t h e r time i n a v i s i o n , He saw a Maiden of Heaven suspended

While He was proclaiming His Cause worldwide by addressing the
rulers and the ecclesiastics, the troublemakers did not rest until
one hot summer morning the soldiers surrounded His house, and no
one knew what was coming. Were all being sent back to Persia,
or drowned in the sea, or what?
When they were moyed under guard to the seaport in preparation
for final exile to ~ k k g ,~ah6'u'llhh revealed His well-known SGriy-

6 .

i-Ra'is (Ra'is means the chief), addressed to Ali-~a'&&, the prime
~Jnisterof the Turkish Empire. In it, Bahii'u'llGh severely rebuked

~l;-~;sh&, and forecast their downfall with Adrianople passing
out oftheir hands, and blood flowing everywhere which were all
fulfilled within eight years.

Another hot August day, similar to the day He was taken to the
siygh-ch&l, after having been shipped to Haifa,. He, His family
and f o ~ o w e r s ,a total of sixty-seven people, were put on a sail
boat towards 'Akk;, and His half-brother to Cyprus. To make it
more miserable, the government ordered a few of the followers of
each to go with the other. When one of Bah~'u'1l~h'sfollowers
heard that he should go to Cyprus with ~ i r z 6Yahya, he shouted
"Y6 Bahii'u'l-Abhii," and jumped in the sea to drown himself, but
was rescued and resuscitated enough to be sent to Cyprus. After
a few years, he escaped and joined the believers near Bah6'u111&h.
That August day was so windless that it took all day for that sail
boat to cross the bay. Without any shade and inadequate water,
the suffering, particularly that of children, needs no description.
Bahii1u'll6h was placed in a solitary cell behind bars, and the
rest, in crowded rooms. L ~bdu'l-~ahi,then twenty-f ive years old,
and seeing the crowded situation, chose to sleep in the morgue
room on a slab of cold stone.     What atrocities!   Soon sickness
of every kind struck, and some died. It was during that time when
a believer, badly ill, took his last breath, and the message of
death was taken to Baha'u'llfih. He brought him back to life by
advising His secretary to go and chant the healing prayer by his
death bed.

It was a couple months short of two years since His imprisonment
in the cell when a great tragedy happened.        It was the death of

Bah&'u'l16h1s twenty-two year old son, Mirzri Mihdi. While deep
in prayer, pacing on the rooftop, he fell through an open skylight.
Bah6'u1ll6h asked him what his wish was. He could have granted
any wish. However, Mirzi Mihdi begged that he could be accepted
as a sacrifice so the gates would open, and the believers could
attain the presence of their Lord.     His wish was granted.     In
a few months the government, needing the barracks for military
purposes, put the believers in various houses within the city under
house arrest. Bah&'ulllah was confined to the house of '~di
Khamma'r, also known as the house of 'Abbiid, where He revealed the
-
Kitgb-i-Aqdas in 1873, twenty years after His intimation in the

- and in the midpoint of His ministry.

siy6h-Ch61,

Soon the downfall and assassination of Sultan 4 Abdu'l-'Aziz
occurred, and the course of events eased the restrictions after       ,
spending nine years in the disease-ridden and desolate city of
'Akka, called by Him "the Most Great Prison."
The Mansion of Bahji, built by the wealthy '6di ~ a m m i roustide
the walled city of 'Akk6 by an oasis, was deserted because of out-    1
break of disease, and was rented for a nominal fee, and later
purchased. Bah&'u1116h's last thirteen years of ministry were
spent in the comfort of that mansion with its doors open to all
believers.

He ascended at the age of seventy-five on May 29, 1892, about a
century ago, and was laid to rest the same day in a building
adjacent to the Mansion.

Friends! This is the first time in the history of religion that
detailed, recorded history of the birth of a religion, and minute
accounts of the lives of its Authors is left for posterity. What
a bounty for us to have access to this knowledge.
Let us elaborate on three questions about Baha1u'll5h's response
to the hostile environment, kind gestures of the well-wishers,
and the impression of a curious Westerner.    The first question.

Was His life in danger? Yes, every minute of it. The incident
of Muhammad Esh's order for His arqest and execution was mentioned
earlier. His imprisonment in the Siy6h-Esl was for the intention
of killing Him. His arch-enemy was the venomous mother of the             '

young Z G h whose murder had been attempted. While in the siyiih-
-
Ch5l  His food was poisoned by her order, but was so obvious that
He did not- eat it.     During exile in ~a&da'h,   twice He escaped
an assassination attempt by a hired gunman.      The Persian consul
had hired this pr~fessi~naland fearless assassin, offering high
rewards. But to the gunman's own account, every time that he faced
Bahi'u'lliih, he became filled with awe and remorse, and could not
use the gun. Once was in the public bath when Bahafu'll6h was
alone, and the second time was on the street at a vantage point.
When in Ba&dgd,    a large number of fanatic Muslims, riled up by
the consul and clergy, wished to attack His house and kill Him
after dark. That afternoon, He walked with His servant to the
coffeehouse where the ruffians' leaders used to frequent.       As
He approached the coffeehouse, with vehemence He told His servant,
"Our life has been threatened. We have no fear. We are ready
for them. Here is our head." All who heard Him were struck dumb.
He stayed in the coffee shop until dark and walked home. No one
dared to touch him.
When in Adrianople, He was poisoned by His half-brother. He became
seriously ill with pain and high fever.      His condition was so
bad that Dr. shishmZn, who visited Him, called it hopeless and
terminal. In a few days the doctor became ill, and when
Bahii1u'l15h's secretary visited him, he stated that he wished to
offer his life as a ransom for the recovery of BahS'u'll5h. This
offer was accepted by BahA1u'llAh, so the doctor died and
Bahg'u'lliih recovered, but He was left with shaking hands. Dr.
--
~hishmAn really did not die. He became immortal in the history
of the Faith.

~ a h ~ ~ u ' l was

l ~ h the target of the wrath of three monarchs; two
kings of Persia and the powerful Sultan of Turkey. Their intent
was to destroy Him and crush His Cause.           All they did was to
fulfill the prophesies.         The disease-ridden and foul-aired 'Akk;
did not kill Him. The greatest volumes of His writings were
revealed during twenty-four years of His life in 'Akkg.

The second question; did He take asylum?     The incidence of the
reception in Bandar Gaz, and the Russian officer offering his ship
as asylum was mentioned earlier.

When t h e a t t e m p t on t h e l i f e of t h e G 6 h was made i n 1852,

event.

I
I will read only a very small portion of his impression when he
interviewed Bah5'u1ll5h in the Mansion of Bahji two years before
His Ascension.    "The face of Him on Whom I gazed I can never
forget, though I cannot describe it. Those piercing eyes seemed
to read one's very soul; power and authority sat on that ample
brow. No need to ask in whose presence I stood, as I bowed myself
before the One Who is the object of a devotion and love which kings
might envy and emperors sigh for in vain!''
Friends! This talk will be incomplete without a glance at
BahA'u'll~hfs writings. There are fifteen thousand documents at
the World Center, either written in His own handwriting, or by
His secretary, bearing His seal. Some of these are irj the size
of a book such as the KitGb-i-Aqdas and the Kitsb-i-Iqsn, some
in form of a short letter or tablets. What other religion can
claim such a bounty?

In Ba&dSd,  He revealed His mystical writings, such as The Four
Valleys and The Seven Valleys, spiritual and moral exhortations,
such as The Hidden Words, the interpretation of the prophecies
of the Holy Books, and proof of the station of the Bgb, titled
~itgb-i-i~hn,or The Book of Certitude.
In Adrianople and later in '~kkg, He addressed the kings, emperors
and the ecclesiastics, thus proclaiming His Faith worldwide. In
'~kk; in 1873, when half of His ministry was over, He revealed His
Most Holy Book, or the ~it&b-i-~~das  which addresses the following
four subjects: 1. The laws and ordinances; 2. The institution
of successorship; 3. The Universal House of Justice; 4. Prophecies
including the New World Order and the next Manifestation.

Following the Kithb-i-Aqdas, His major tablets such as 1&rGq6t
(Splendors) ; Bish5rGt (Glad Tidings) ;, ~ajalli~&t(Effulgences) ;
Tarszgt (ornaments); ~alimht-i-~erdawsi~ih(Words of Paradise);
Lawh-i-~a~~Gd  (Tablet of ~aq?;d);          Lawh-i-Aqdas (The Most Holy
Tablet);   and ~ a w h - i - ~ u n ~(Tablet

i      of the World) were written.

This group of Tablets are considered supplementary to the ~itgb-
i-Aqdas.    The Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, an anthology of
His writings and glance at His life, was written in 1891, one year
before His Ascension, the same year that the last Tablet, or the
Tablet of the World, was revealed. The Book of His Covenant,

appointing I ~bdu'l-Bah; as the Center of the Covenant, was opened
and read nine days after His Ascension.

I   '

> This was a brief account of the life of ~irz; Husayn ~li-i-~<ri,
> known as ~ah&'u'll&h, the Supreme Manifestation of God.

May I be forgiven for any shortcoming in this presentation.

The Bah5'i Dispensation is distinguished from all other dispensations
with its unique and matchless features, the greatest of which is
the unrivaled station of the Revelation of BahG'u1115h. All
Manifestations of the past appeared during various stages of the
evolution of man's collective life; namely, from the childhood period
of tribal life to the stage of youth or statehood. The last              I
Manifestation in the Adamic Cycle, the Seal of the Prophets, Muhammad,   I

stressed the significance of nationhood. The ~ahA'i Revelation,
as testified by the Guardian, should be viewed as marking the last
and the highest stage in the evolution of man's collective life on
this planet; or, in other words, the stage of maturity which comes
only once to mankind. The Golden Age of the Bahg'i Era should be
regarded, as far as this planetary life is concerned, as the
furthermost limits in the organization of human society.
The second glorious feature is the Twin Manifestations.     These two
Suns of Reality, being in essence as one, by release of spiritual
energies revolutionized and revitalized the life of mankind, to bring
about in fullness of time the Most Great Peace when the Kingdom of
God shall reign. One Manifestation, the ~a/b,or the Primal Point,
through the potency of Whom all things originated, and the Cycle
of Fulfillment was inaugurated. The other, BahA1u'l16h, the Supreme
Redeemer of mankind, Who is the Desire of the World and the King
of Kings, and whose reign will overshadow all Manifestations in the
next cycle of five thousand centuries.

The third indisputable feature is the fulfillment of the prophecy,
"The Day that shall not be followed by night." The Bgb states that           I

the 'Day' is the life of a prophet on this earth, and the night is
the period from His death to the time of the next Manifestation when
only luminaries will shine. In this Day of God, the light of
BahG'utll&h continues to shine through His Covenant in its sublime
resplendency, and is the source of unity of mankind.     This covenant
with its twin interpreters, 'Abdu'l-Bahh and Shoghi Effendi , succeeded
by the Universal House of Justice, is unparalleled in history.
'Abdu'l-~ahii, the Center of the Covenant, the Most Great Branch, has
a station above that of an ordinary man in position of successorship.
He possessed such powers that truly personified the title given to
Him by His Father, "The Mystery of God."
Shoghi Effendi, the only Guardian of the Faith, the last authorized
interpreter, the Sign of God on earth, was the most precious gift
and indeed a 'Priceless Pearl.' Shoghi Effendi states in The World
Order of Bah6'u111&h that the gulf that separated the station of
'Abdu'l-Bah5 from the station of Baha 'u1116h also exists between
himself and that of '~bdu'l-Bah6, but much wider.

The fourth feature is the existence of original texts of the sacred
writings, the like of which no religion can claim. In the most recent
dispensations of Islgm and Christianity, we find that only parts
of the Qur'gn were written during the lifetime of Muhammad, and the
rest within a few years after His passing. The Gospels were probably
written some forty to sixty years after the Ascension of Jesus.
This sharp contrast is manifested by the existence of more than
fifteen thousand documents written or dictated by ~ a h 'u

i 'll&h during
forty years of His ministry, and preserved in the Archives of the
Bahg'i Faith at the World Center.

The fifth unique feature is the divinely ordained administrative
system which is unlike man-made systems in Isl&rn and Christianity
which were subject to abuse of power and corruption.        This new
administrative order was originated by Bah~'u1116hmore than a century
ago, and presently is in its embryonic form.       It will safequard
mankind from all evils inherent in the past systems; and, being the
fruit of the Covenant of Bahh1u'll6h, guarantees the unity of mankind
and its survival.

Examination of the lives and the times of the Manifestations of the
past bring to light the sixth unique feature of this Faith.    Even
i n t h e h i s t o r y of t h e most r e c e n t r e l i g i o n s s u c h as I s l a m and

-
C h r i s t i a n i t y , t h e b i r t h d a t e of Muhammad and J e s u s are n o t known.
I n t h e B a h s ' i F a i t h we have d e t a i l e d r e c o r d e d h i s t o r y of t h e l i f e
o f t h e B&b and BahA'u'llGh which w i l l b e a r e l i e f t o t h e f u t u r e
religious historians.
