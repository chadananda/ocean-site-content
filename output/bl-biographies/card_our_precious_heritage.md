OUR PRECIOUS HERITAGE

This ~r i ef treatise on t he coming of the Bah~'{ Faith to ~ales is
but one min~ce facet of an almost unimaginably vase epic. In the
contemplation of this story one ma y see bu t a small reflection of a
process whi:h has its counterparts in many a thousand other locations,
in different lands, in diverse cultures among many nations scattered
throughout the length and breadth of this our planet .

As it is therefo r e but one, not very significant story typi fy ing
t he gradua l unfoldment of t he Divine Plan for the regeneration of
mankind it is essentia l that we should first look briefly at t ne ma tr ix
within which the story wil'l unfold .

Accounts of the beloved Guardian's painstaking building up of the
Administrative order, firstly in the United States and subsequentl y in
t he othe r cont inents, over a period of sixteen years have been
thrillingly portrayed in other volumes; notably in "Twenty f ive years
of the Cua~dia nshi p" by Ruhiyy i h llhanum. From he r book we learn chat
the above protracted labour of love vas but a prelude to the l aunching,
in 1937 , of America's first Seven Year Plan.

"I t vas the first joint ac t ivity on a large scale, nationally
organised and flowing into an internationa l field, t ha t t he fo l lowers
of Baha 'u' l lah had ever undertaken anywhere in the 1Jorld." anc in 1.·hich
he, '' .... l ed us seven years down that mighty pioneer trail which
" ould cove r No rth America, in to Alaska , down to Panama, all O''er Central
and Sou th America across the Andes and in to the West Indies . "

Inspired no doubt, by t he success of t ha t stupendous campa ign the
believt:1:; in Gt . Britain, at their Annual Convention in !944, resolvec
t o write t o the Guardian suggesting t hat they too s hould ha ve a plan.

Back came the earth- sha tteri ng cable; - ''Ad vise formation of
nineteen s piritual assemblies s pread over England , Wales , Scotland      a~d
Eire ."

It has been said that had the Baha' {s of England of tha: time
known what they were inviting they might have had second thou~hts; ( for
the five local assembl ies and t he vas e majority of believers then, were
all located in England . ) Truly a formidable tas k confronted chem, - in
six shor t year s to accomplish such an expansion; but it was th.a!
G~atdian's wish , it was part of ~ad's plan , it was no t only possible

but fore-ordained. So everybody - well, almost everybody - sat back
and waited for it to happen.

How often this pattern has been repeated during the course of
Baha'{ history. Mulla Husayn was but one of several of the disciples
of Siyyid Kazim but he was the one who said, - "Come then, let us seek
for the Promised One as our leader has bidden. When Abdu'l- Baha sent
the Vehicles of the Divine Plan to the believers in America, only Martha
Root and a few other valiant souls ar ose to fulfil the Divine Mandate.

Similar ly with Britain's first six year plan, everybody believed
in it, ell talked about it, but few arose - so that after 15 months, in
August 1945, the beloved Guardian wrote, "I grieve to learn of the slo"'
progress of the six year Plan which the English believers have so nobly
conceived .... '' And again in December of that year - ''I am anxiously
waiting for news of the progress .... "

Two years had come and gone, the third begun when the Guardian
wrote - "The activities of the English Baha'i community, in pursuance
of the Plan which in its scope and potentialities is wholly unprecedented
in the hi story of the Faith in the Br itish Isles are now approaching
a cr itical stage , and will, if not relentlessly expanded and consolidated
fall far short of their ultimate ob jective . They have now entered the
third year of their plan and the work that st ill remains unaccomplished
is considerable ..... "

A dire wa r ning indeed; but the seeds for future growth had al r eady
been planted and the first tender green shoots were beginning co break
through the barren earth and to turn towards the sun.

Let us consider briefly the standing of the Cause in our homeland
at that ti me . There had been f ive assemblies in England but of these
two had been disbanded. It had now been resolved that nine more towns
were to be chosen to achieve assemblies before th~ end of the third
year ; this constituted the first phase. A few 'pioneers' had arisen but
nothing like the 'flood' which would be essential if success was to be
assured.

Meanwhile, in October 1945, Marion Holley had come over from t he
Americas to marry David Hofman. Marion had had the bene fit of experience
in the prosecution of the U. S. Seven Year Plan, which, it will be
recalled - "l.1as the first joint activity ... nationally organised ...
ever undertaken anywhere in the world.'' The proving-ground, as it were,
for the world-wide campaigns which were to follow in the futur e.

Philip Hainsworth, on pilgrimage in Haifa, had spent six weeks
with the beloved Guardian. At Teaching Conference in 1946 and again in
1947, and during the annual conventions, these souls, together with a
few ochers of like mind, integrity and enthusiasm, from home and over-
seas alike ,* brought home to the British believers a more profound
appreciation of Shoghi Effendi, the Sign of God on ear th and inspired
them to turn to him with deeper trust and ready obedience.

At last the realisation dawned upon one and all that they were
the ones ~ho had to arise, and to serve, and to sacrifice in order to
win the 'goa ls ' set before them . So stupe~dous was the impact of the
resurgence of spirit that, before the close of the Six Year Plan, 60
per cent of the Baha'is of Gt. Britain had ar isen to pioneer; a record
never surpassed, before nor since anywhere in the Baha'i World.

Chapter One

Mrs Rose Jones had moved to Cardiff from London in 1942 follow i ng
her marriage . She came with the blessing of the London community and
so became (so far as is known) the first Baha'i to live in the Principal-
ity . Rose testifies, - "I first heard of the Faith when I was very
young attending children's classes •... our spirit ual leader was Mrs
Florence George (a ff ectionately known co one and all as 'Mother George')
an artist who lived in Chelsea . As we got older we were invited to the
adults so I went on from there and had the honour of meeting the very
early Baha '{s . I was t he only one who continued to att end and I thank
Baha'u'llah for the great bounty. Claire Gung (who later joined Rose
in Ca rdiff an~ v ho shared her home in Werfa St . Roath) had also attended
Mother George ' s classes .

Rose accepted Baha'u'llah at the age of 12 (the later age limit
of 15 had not been introduced at that time) in 1918/19. Two daughters
were born during her nine year residence in Cardiff, both of whom are
now (1985) pioneers overseas. Irene (Tafaaki) is head of the Nev Era

*      The ideal, for an author , would be to mention all names of none
at all. As the former is impossible and the latter too coldly
impersonal , I rely on the generosity, tolerance and forebearance of
of those concerned to understand, and to forgive .

School in Panchgani, India, and has recently written the lovely
children's book, 'Horse of the Moonlight'. Valerie pioneered to Africa
in 1968 and i s now in Botswana .

When Cardiff was chosen as the Goal town to open Wales to the
faith it was evident that pioneers would be essential . Joe Lee froo
Manchester was the first to try . Joe came to Cardiff and sought long
but unsuccessfully for acconunodation for his wife, Elsie, and their
growing young family. Regretfully he had to return to Manchester .

Now it is late 1946; nearly two years into t he Plan and problems
and set-backs were besetting the community, both nationally and locally .
It i s evid ent that the his tory of 'Wales' cannot be cons idered without
reference t o the national scene - the 'Mother' comnunities to '-'horn '-'e
owe ou r birth and sustenance. Indeed it is true co say that eleven
years were to elapse befor e Cardiff was able to support itself without
the influx of pioneers; but that is anticipating my story - so let us
re~urn to that eventful Teaching Conference as recorded in the Baha'i
Journal of March 1947 -

"The dynamic focus of this yea r s Teaching Conference January
4th-5th in Manchester, was the dedication to t he 25th Anniversary of
the Guardians hip . It was a t heme which was neve r out o f mind among
those present; it opened up new areas of thought and unders tanding
and · its quickening effect can s urely not be overestimated. More tha n
75 bel ievers from all parts of the British Isles part icipated in this
historic occasion .... the reports f r om goal towns and conununities (all
persona ll y represented except St . Ives) proving of great value and
stimulus."

Hugh McKinley reports, - "It was oncof the coldes t winters on r ecor d .
All heating had been cut off a s we huddled in Jeff Joseph's warehouse,
some on chairs and some on packing cases while Ho~r Kempton and Marion
Hofman brought Ruhiyyih Khanum's booklet on "25 years of the Guardian-
ship" to life . On the j ourney home there was no heating in the
railway carriage and Dorothy Ferr aby's hair froze to the window glass
as she s l ept.

From that Teaching Conference was sent the fol l owing cable , -
"Dedication to 25th Anniversary Guardianship, our rock of strength,
sou rce of guidance , raised teaching conference fr esh heights of vision,
endeavour . Conference gratefully, joyous ly, humbly of fers beloved
Gua ~ dian steadfast devotion.  Pledges service as never before . "

s

To this the Guardian cables his reply, - "Pr ofoundly moved
message . Greatly appreciate noble sent iments. Praying depths grateful
heart continued success magnificent collective effor ts. Deepest love -
Shogbi" And three weeks later the N.S . A. 11as able to cable Haifa, -
"JOYFULLY REPORT JOAN GIDDINGS OFFERS PIONEER CARDIFF."

But once again matters were not that simple . Joan's husband,
Br ian , not at that time a Baha'i, 11as away at sea. Joan was in need of
medical attention and had to decide 11hether to wait for her operation
or to pr oceed to Cardi ff and hope to obtain the necessary treatment
there. After much hes itation and delay the latter course proved to be
the only practical one . Brian gladly gave his consent to t he move a nd
decided to leave the merchant servi ce and seek alternative employment
in Cardiff on his return from sea .

On April 21st, Ridvan 1947, Joan, newl y ar r ived in the Capital,
met Rose · at her home a t 14, We r fa St. Roath and held there the first
ever meeting of resident Baha'{s in Wales . The first stage was
accomplished; the formation of a nucleus was declared and minuted.

It was necessary to r ecord this as the first meeting of 'resident'

Baha ' 1s fo r it was not in fact Cardiff's first Baha ' 1 meeting. That
had taken place, amazingly enough, 22years earl ier. Treasured among
the archives of the Cardiff Assembly is a news-cutting from the Western
Mail dated November 15th , 1925, which records that Martha Root
accompanied by Mrs Florence Schopflocher visited Cardi ff and there
addressed the Esper antist society, the Theosophical Socie ty and held
a reception in t he Park Hotel .

The report reads as follows, -
"Two women have been in Cardiff on a very interesting mission. They
are Miss Martha L. Root, a Pittsburg j ournalist and Mrs Flor ence
Schopflocher of Montreal. They met in England by accident, both being
independen tl y engaged in a World tour for the same purpose, and came
to Wales together for the weekend. Their purpose is the spread of the
knowledge of the Bah~ ' { religion. This i s a movement whi ch started in
Persia and has spread with marvellous effect .

Its twelve basic teachings are;- The oneness of mankind ,
independent investigation of truth, t he foundation of all religions is
one, r eli gion must be the cause of unity, religion must be in accord
with science and reason, equality between men and women, prejudice of
all kinds must be forgotten, universal peace , univer sal educati on,

spiritual solution of the economic problem, a universal language,
an international tribunal.

The adherents believe that their creed is the world-uniting
force .... These two women have, between them visited practically every
country in the world - moved to this voluntary mission by their profound
faith.

Those interested in this movement may obtain full information f rom Mr
J . C. Cr aven, 27 Derby St. Altrincham."

It is difficult if not impossible for us at the present stage of
the development of the Baha 'i cause in Great Bri tain, t o appreciate
f ully the extent of the sacrifices made and of the suffering endured by
these gallant early pioneers . It is recorded that one pioneer used to
spend every winter evening in the railway station waiting room because
hi s landlady would not allow him a fire in his bed-sitting room.
Brian Giddings tells us, - "In 1947 houses to rent were almost non-
existent and buying was extremely expensive (pro rata to wages) and to
get us into Cardiff, Joan had to take two rooms in a house in return
for looking a fter an old bed-ridden lady and her husband ; cooking ,
cleaning, etc., etc."

It was more than two years before they were able to move from
these rooms in Coplestone Rd, Llandaff, to Plasturton Avenue.

One can see that running a home, caring for two elderly people,
a husband and a small son left but little time for Baha'i activities .
Kevertheless, Joan put in a tremendous amount of dedicated work getting
: he Faith known and organised in Cardiff . Rose Jones also had her
very young family and her husband was a staunch catholic, ( l ittle if
anything is r ecorded about him but he must have been a very tolerant
person), yet one of the first resolutions (April 26th, 1947) was that
a percentage of the local Fund should be donated td the National
Assembly. Feasts were obse rved methodically and weekly Firesides
commenced as a prelude to their first , and later a series, of publ i c
meetings.

But hardly had they got themselves organised, with their sight s
set comfortably on Assembly status by 1950 when another bombshell
burst . That was confirmation from the secretary of the N.T.C., dated
May 30th 1947, - "Dear Bah~'i friend, as you know, the Guardian requi r es
a Sp'ritual Assembly in Cardiff by next April. Fred Stahler, the first
pioneer to arise t his year• will be coming to join you on Monday, 2nd
of June . "                • l.• e. 104 B.E.

The momentous events of these early months are briefly portrayed
in an article which appeared in the Baha ' { Journal No . 68 and , at the
risk of some repetition, it would be appropriate to quote an extract.

> On April 21st, 1947, resident Baha'{ Rose Jones welcomed Joan
> Giddings to Cardiff and the nucleus of a Baha'i community "'as
> formed . After devotional readings these two friends, both of
> whom had non- Baha 'i husbands, and young children to care for,
> solemnly dedicated themselves to "'ork for the cause of Baha ' u ' llah
> in l.'ales. We arranged to meet weekly and to hold Feasts on t he
> correct day. Meantime every endeavour was made to interest those
around us in the Faith and to bring them to Fireside meet i ngs.

We realised that it "'ould be slow, arduous work to make a

> magnitude of our task was increased, when, on ~ay 30th, we
> received news from the National Teaching Committee that Cardiff
> was to be a 'Goal' town and have an assembly by 1948."

On the 2nd of June, Fred Stah l er fr om Bir mingham , a young man in
his early twent i es, duly arrived and was lovingly welcomed by Rose and
Joan.

l!ugh and Violet. McKinley, mother and son , 3aha'is in the Torquay
area were an xious to move to where they could most profitably serve the
Cause - but again there were imped i me nts . Let us hear how 'difficulties
were removed' in Hugh's own words.

"Far away i n Devon ... Violet McKinley and her son Hugh were on
the fringe of the then unlimited area of the L.S.A . of Torqua y of wh i ch
Violet had been an early member at its founda tion before the wa r.
Working as horseman and tractor driver on the farm, Hugh had appeared
before an Objec t or ' s Tribunal at Bristol in 1943 and had been granted
non-combatant status provided he complied with the'Control of Engage-
ments Order' and remained in Ag r icultural work. In September 1946,
while on a motor cycle journey from Chudleigh to nearby Torquay, where
he was going to give a talk at t he Baha'i centre , Baha'u'llah ordained
fo r him a miraculous accident . Undoubtedly the prompt action of t he
National Youth Committee in session, cabling the Guardian fo r his
prayers at the shrines, helped to restore Hugh to life from Base
frac ture of the skull and facial paralysis .

Three months later , after his release from hospital, Hugh was
registered as a disabled person and freed to take employment anywhere .
It was decided by the N.T.C. that initially the McKinleys should move
into Torquay to augment their teaching plan . The magnet of greater
obligations in the pioneer field soo~ drov~ Violet and Hugh to seek
.    '

a more challenging goal and on the 27th of September 1947 (under the
direction and with the blessing of the N.T.C . ) they arrived in Cardiff,
asking for the 'bus to Llandaff and the 'Cow and Snuffers' public house,
near to which the Giddings rented their two room accommodation. - The
Cow and Snuffers is a centuries old pub which stood on the banks of the
old , but now obliterat ed, Glamorganshire canal and in what was then the
' tiny ' City of Llandaff . -

There they participated in a joyful 19 Day Feast and stayed for
two or three days finding their feet . Then they moved into the city,
into cheap hotels and commenced wearing out . shoe~leather· ...,alRing .the
surrounding s treets, knocking on every door, trying t o find furnished
rooms. It took nearly three weeks before two temporary rooms were found
and after two months they moved to Pontr.anna St . where they stayed for
a year .... " - - As an indica tion of the · lcbanging: td:mes', thei r l and-
lady at Pontcanna used to wash not only the step, garden path and
pavement, but also an apron of the road every week with hot soap and
water. -

Five resident Baha ' 1s, six months to go and four more still
required . Now the tempo of t he Teaching work accelerated. Dick Backwell
(July 22- 3) and Alma Gregor y (29th and 30th) were among those who
visited this little group to encourage, advise and inspire. Firesides
were arranged for t hem and though the atmosphere was one of confidence
and .Joy very few contacts came .

Then, on Oc to ber 14th 1947 , the long planned, eagerly awaited
First Public Meeting. To continue with Hugh's na r rative, (for we have
the inestimable benefit of the testimony of one who experienced these
early trials and triumphs;) -

''How are you? Are you well? Are you happy? These words
> of the Master's became the standard of Baha'i life in Cardiff for
> all the pioneers felt lonely, living in an unkn~~n land on t he
frontiers of the Faith's penetration. They called in to. make

,    these
> enquiries two or three times a week, just to 'see a Baha ' i face' and
> to exchange news of the day to day progress of the Six Year Plan . "

The first public meeting was held in the Park Hotel (where
Martha Root had held her reception twenty two years previously) - with
Philip Hainsworth as speaker.

All that day Fred end Hugh strode in the shopping centre and
mai n streets of Cardiff distributing a 1000 pink and blue handbills to

passers- by. Twelve enquirers came; a number were Theoso~hists; members
of the U.N.A., the International Club and others were brought to the
knowledge of the Faith."

One of the enquirers who signed the 'Visitor's Book' at that
meeting (a book which is still in our keeping) was e lovely Viennese
nurse, Suzanne Solomon . On March 18th of the following 7ear Suzanne
became a Baha'f. Cardiff's first declarant and the sixth member of the
Cardiff community.

Suzanne se, ved the Cause zealously for some ten years, and though
personal pr oblems sometimes intruded giving rise to many difficulties
which unhappil y led eventually to her withdrawal from the Faith, she
was, after all, Car diff's first conf i rmed ueliev er and as such must
have a place, an honoured place, in the Annals of t he Faith in wales .

Chapter    Two

It i s onl y possible to convey a rough idea of the increasing
volume of work undertaken by these five stalwart pioneers during these
mon ths of accelecating activi ty .

Joan Giddings, who had beP.n 'elected' Secre ta r y• to the initial
group of tvo in 1947 held that office until compelled tor !am1ly reasons
t o r e t urn to Bradford nine years later .

Correspondence vith the National Assembly , and vith the N.T. C.

in particul ar, with travel teachers and with othe r local Assemblies,
all mounted i n volume. Apart f r om t he organising of Feasts and
Firesides - sometimes twice weekly - and now public meetings, a
vigorous and sustained effort had been made from t he earl iest days to
secure a Baha ' i Centre. Every possible avenue was explored but always
premises proved unsuita ble or, more often , too expensi~e. (This
cher ished desire alas , remains unfulfilled to this day, 40 years l ater . )

* Except for about six months in 1954 when Dennis
secretary .

~cArthur   was

Many of the meetings were held in a rented room at 'Ty't Cymru'

> (the Welsh House) at 11, Gordon Road. Many receipts for this hire
> are extant; e . g., 'Received the sum of 7/6d , rent for room August 28th
> 48 .' I n that year the Annual Account lists, - to rent Ty'r Cymru,
£ 19/12/6 , rent for room; some 2S meetings in all. And of course there
was also the constant stream of inspired guidance coming through the
National Assembly from the beloved Guardian . Words of praise and
encouragement , admonition and warning, advice and exhortations.
Sometimes the guidance would come while the problems were still the
subject of consultation; such as when in May 1947 four localities had
to be selected for Assembly status by Ridvan next. From Baha'i Journal,
Aug '4 7 pp. 2

"The selection of towns for t his honour "as discussed throughout the

> community, as well as by Convention and more specifically by the
> National Teaching Committee . A directive from the Guardian settled
> the problem for us in a manner which none of us had visualised,
> but which we now see bears the unerring stamp of that guidance "hich
> we look for in our beloved Guardian.

He asks us to develop the nuclei established last year in Cardiff,
> Dublin, and Edinburgh into 'fully fledged assemblies ere the expiry
> of the present year.' Here then are three of our goals for the
> present year , and the N.S.A. has approved the committee's recommend-
> ~tion that Bristol be the fourth ... to complete the initial phase of
> the plan."

Five months after the receipt of the above mandate, Cardiff had
the honour of its own 'first' letter from the Guardian; dated Nov lst,
1947, it was sent in re ply to our report to him of the holding of our
first Public Meeting.

Dear and valued co-workers,

'
I "ish t o add a few words in person and assure everyone of
> you of my deep admiration of the spirit you manifest. The
> services you render and the determination with which you are
> initiating the great historic teaching enterprise in Wales .
> You are, I as sure you, often in my thoughts and I will suppl icate
> the Beloved to bless continually your high and meritorious
endeavours.

Your true and grateful brother,

Shoghi

Now :n England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales the signs of
increased activity were everywhere apparent . The first trickle of new
bel i evers were declaring their faith in BahA'u ' llah - some bein5 from
the newly opened territories. A national ly orga nised circuit of Travel
Teache rs "as i nstituted, visiting the communities and 'goal' to·.·ns at
least once every month; addressing fi~es ides and publ ic meetings,
encouraging, assisting and inspiring one and all. So much so t hat, in
contras t t o the cables of '45 and '46 quoted in Chapter One, the
Guardian wrote in October of 1947, -

Dear and valued   c~-worke rs,

A gigantic task , now beins so energetically and success-
> fully ca rr ied ou t by the conse:rated and firmly knit British
> Baha' i'. community , const itutes a glorious landmark in recen t
> Baha ' f history, and will, when viewed i n proper perspective,
> deserve to be regarded as one of the most ou tstanding enterprises
> l aun:hed by the followers of Bah~ 'u'l l ah in the open ing years of
> the second Baha'i century. Alike in its magnitude and significance
> th is momentous undertaking is unprecedented in the Anna l s of the
> Faith in t he British Isles, and deserves to rank as one of the
> mos t compelling evidences of the creative power of its Author,
> marking the rise and establ ishment of His institutio ns en the
> Eur opean continent .•.. "

Cardi ff was not the leas t of those favoured by these wo~d erf ul
Baha'i t eachers; the mere catalogue of their names appears l ike a page
from a BahA ' i Burke's peerage' .

The most frequently used venue for the publ ic mee tings vas the
Royal Hote l in Queen St., with t hree or four i n the Park Hotel and
one at least in Cardiff's City Hal l . It was ther e that the second
public meeting was held on November 18th. This was addressed by Hassa n
Sabri , (at the time living in Birminsham) .

On ~ovember 29th, May White at the Royal Hotel and also a t Gordon
Rd . From London , on December 16th , Mrs Mary Basil Hall . Mary ca~e
agai n on Jenuary 20th , 1948 - this t ime accompanied by Mr s Muriel
Mathews anc Debor ah Col eman . Deborah was the fir st ne" bel iever t o
declare in a goal town . - Dublin in Ei re had that honour .

May White paid her second visit to t he Royal on Februar y 11 th
and sha red the platform with Joan Giddings. She spoke to the title
"True Educat ion" . On t he 23rd , this time at the Angel Hotel ,

Internat ional Youth Day was celebrated. This took the form of a
Symposium : Winifred Knowles of the Theosophical Lodge and Brian
Giddings were guests on t he panel which included Joan Giddings , Muriel
Mathews, Arthur Cole and David Hofman.

Let us break at this juncture to record two events of ma jor
importance which took place about this time . A kindly disposed Welsh
clerg yma n, Mr Gwyn Daniels presented to the Cardiff Baha'is a
translation into Welsh of the ' Unity Prayer '. In her greatly appreciated
contribution to these reminiscences, Miss Beatrice Newman informs us
tha t this Welsh version has been recited in Haifa, at the Temples in
Frankfur t and Kamyal a, in Iceland, in the Orkneys, Shetlands and t he
Fair Isles ; in Tanzania and in Kenya, in Oslo, Malta, Cypr us and Jersey
as well as in all the Capitals and Major centres in t he British Isles .

The other great occasion came on March 18th when Mrs Suzanne
Solomon dec lared her belief in Baha'u'llah and was accepted by the
National Assembly. Suzanne first hea rd the Baha ' i message at a Firesid e
on Sept. 28th conducted by Ms Clara Weir of Los Angeles.

Our next visiting speaker , (March 12th and 13th) was much beloved
Hasan Balyuzi. On the 20th the platform was shared by David Hofman and
Hassan Sabri . Nine Baha'i friends and one visitor (there may well have
been others ) signed our visitors book at the Unity Feast to celebrate
Naw- Ruz. On April 2nd Olga Mills and Elsie Cranmer came to s hare thei r
experience, their love and their wisdom. Elsie Cranmer was ' standing
in ' for Lady Kathleen Hornell who deepl y regret ted being unable t o come
on t his occasion . The last meeting at the Royal Hotel before Ridvan
19~8 was held on April 12th and there was also a Fireside gathering at
Go rdon Rd . on the 16th presided over by Marion Hofman.

Some idea of the intensity of the teaching effort during these
past nine or ten months can be seen when one notes that in addi tion to
the sixteen hotel meeti ngs listed above, forty or more fireside and/
or deepening classes were held at Ty'r Cymru. Hany' of the speakers
at the listed meeti ngs were also able to attend the Fireside gatherings.

Such then was the spirit of love and devotion exemplified by
t his litt le group of five, each with the cares, responsibilities and
post-war restrictions of the time, which enabled them to sustai n so
high a level of organised activity. Such too was the spirit of self-
less service which inspired their helpers who came , many from far away ,
in the hope that somewhere, sometime, a 'wait ing soul' may by awakened
to the call of Baha'u'llah.

All of these meetings were widely advertised; regular notices
appeared in the l oca l Press; gradually the name Baha 'i was being
brought to the notice of the people of Wales. One of Cardiff ' s Baha'is .
Mrs Doreen Bartlett who declared in 1965 , tells us that she recalls
having seen these adverts 18 years before she at te nd ed her first Bahe ' {
meeting . We rea l ly do not know what impact our efforts have on the
general public .        There was an occasion a few years back when a
member of the Cardiff Assembly was sitting on a 'U . N.A. Sponsored'
committee organising a 'World Faith service of Prayer' . This member
was putting in a µlea for a Baha'i prayer to be included in the service.
One of the local Clergy objecting to this said , '' ... after all you are
only a lit tle minority group . I don't suppose there are a t housand
of you in Cardiff altogether." - "Well, no, not quite, " he replied.
(\.le were 12 at that time) " ... so t hat each one may become like unto
a r egiment, ?"

A very fi ne, indeed, an exciting account of the events of that
year, 104 B.E. appeared in the Saha' i Journal of September 1948 and it
will be 600d to read from the report which the Cardi ff friends
themselves submitt ed , summarising the c l osing stages of that year long

by the arrival , on Ma rch 29th, of Ate'u'llah Khochbine from Teheren,

The ninth believer was George Rowley, loaned to us by the Birmingham
L.S . A. for a long settlement project. RIDVAN 105 B.E. - April 21st
1948 - wi t nessed the Declaration of t he firs t Local Spirit ual Assembly
of the Baha'1s of Cardiff .

The cer tifica te of this, the fi rst Baha'1 Assembly in Wales,
bears the signature of : Mrs Rose Jones, Mrs Joan Giddings, Fred Stahler,
Mrs V, McKinley , Hugh McKinley, Mrs Suzanne Solomon, Ata'u'llah
Khochbine, Miss Claire Gung and George Rowley .

A l etter to t he Guardian, Shogi Ef fend i, was composed and in

Edinburgh .

Letters were sent to the National Assembly, to the National
Teaching Committee and the Assembly Development Committee . "

'
The five Assemblies i n Gt. Britain had , within the space of
four years, grown to fourteen. The four 'Goal towns' for 1947/48,
namely, Dublin, El:linburgh, Bristol end Cardiff had all been achieved .

Telegrams of congratulation were sent to the other three new
Assemblies and we received c ongratulator y wires from t he N.S.A., the
N.T.C., and from the London and Birmingham Baha'is. Letters were also
received from Dick Backwell , Isobel Locke and Dore Weekes (Bristol) .

Then, on Octobe r 17th, after some postal delay, t he Guar dian
re plied, -

"Dear and valued co-workers,

The formation of t he first Baha'i Spiritual Assembly in
> Wales is an event of great historical significance . I
> congratulate you on t his splendid ac hievement which , I trust wil l
> be a prelude to s till greater victories in the service of our
> Glorious Faith. I wil l supplicate on your behalf the bless ings
> of Baha ' u ' llah, that your work may prosper, your plans bear
> abundant fruit, and your hopes realised for t he propagat i on
> of t he Faith and the esta bl ishment of its nasce nt inst itu tio ns . "

That t hen may certainly be regarded as the end of a glorious
chapter, ' an even t of great· historical significance' in the beloved
Guardian's words; but it was only t he beginn i ng of the story. In his
cable to t he British Baha'1 community of April 25th t he Guard i an a f firms;
- "Sister communities East West ma rvel (at the) victory won (of) such
mag nit ude (in ) so short a time by community so sorely afflicted, so
smal l numerically, so circumscribed in resources yet so alive, so sound,
so resolute." At the same time he pleads; - "Urge val iant promoters
(of) so momentous a plan (to) guard against dissipation (of) resources
(and) relaxa tion of effort (and the) forfei t ure (of the) hard-won
prizes."

It soon became evident that in Wales at least the friends were
not going to rest on their laurels. The study classes were maintained
and t he mo nt hly pub l ic meetings held as before. Still the Teachers
came from far and wide . George Rowley would have to return to Birmingham
before many mon t hs were up ; Ata'u' l l ah to London before the end of the
year . So t he strengthening of the community was essential i f the
Assembly was to be maintained. To this end severa l 'ad hoc' comm± ttees
were appointed ; one for youth activities; one for advertising; one for
flowe r s and one for L. S. A. meetings and Feasts. As well as these, eve
members , Joan and Fred were on the new S.W.R .T.C . appoi nted by the N. S.A..
~o cover Wales and the West of England.

The half yearly report of 1948 mentions one very interest ing
> feat ure . The committee for L.S.A. 's and Feasts was to ensure that one
> person did not have more meetings at their home than another. This 11 . t
soon ceased to function " for we found t hat we had progressed beyond cHJ' 0 10
'-'here anybody minded whe r e, so long as it was convenient for the purpose."

The nex t meeting for the pu blic at the Royal Hote l was on· H~ y
15th and it was addressed by Mr Chas . Mason Remey. After this, on May
26th, the formerly postponed visit by Lady Kathleen Hornell. Three
more meetings were held in June, on the 11th, 14th and 30th , in addition
to a well attendej gathering at Ty'r Cymru on the 18th of June . Cardiff
also had the privilege and joy of welcoming during this, their fir st
'assembly' year, Hrs Dorothy Ferraby, Dick Backwell, Mrs Mehrangiz
Munsiff (for eight days), Ursula Newman, Peter Robinson fr om Bristol,
May White, and, from , Australia, Mrs Olive Routh; also David Hofman
and Prudence George . Some of these visitors came on twc or three
occasions. Another visitor from the Antipodes was Mrs Ethyl Dawe, a
member of th e N.S.A . of Australia and New Zealand.   We also had the
benefit of a week long visit by Constance Langdon-Davis.

But let it not be thought t ha t pub lic meetings and visiting
teachers 'w'ere the sum total of Baha'i activity . The ' Unity Prayer'

had al,eady been translated into Welsh and now the friends felt that a
Welsh pamphlet would be essential to reach the Welsh speaking populace .
Early in the year an effort was made to find a translator for the popular
yel101<1 pamphlet, "The Baha'i Faith ." There are i nnumerable references
both in t he L.S.A. Mi nutes and in the correspondence to t he gradual
progress of this projec t. By Apri l 22nd, it was reportej to be in
manuscript form; by Oct . 5th after all the requisite processes of
cross-translation and checking it was submitted to the Priory Press and
on January 28th 1SSO, five copies were despatched to the World Centre .
Our accompanying letter is worth quo ting in full for its historical
import i f for no other reason,-

Dear and beloved Guardian,

We are very happy to send you the first copies o f the Baha' t lI
> pamphlets in the Welsh . This was translated by a young man whose
> name we do not know, who was studying for the church , and has
> special qual ifications in Biblical Welsh. The printer assure s
> us that his compositors from Nor th and South Wales found it
> easy to unjerstand and a We lshman who knows of the Faith was
> very impressed by it and said that he had learned more of the
> Faith from it than he had from the English literature . He also
said that the prayer of Baha 'u' l lah was very beautiful in Welsh .

We fee l that t he appearance of t~is pamphlet vill open a new
> phase in the teaching work in Wales and wil l enable us to
> approach those '•ho are at present limited by the ardent national-
i stic move~ent here, in their ovn language .

Consciousness o f the Covenant and of the sustaini ng power
> in the Guardianship is our constant inspiration, and we learn
> wi th j oy of the progress of the work on the Shrine of the Bab.
> We pray that Baha ' u' llah may s ustain you in all the extra work
> that t his entails , and as k your prayers for the Welsh people
> that they may respond to t he Faith; and on our behalf that we
> may be assisted i n car rying it to t hem so that their s pir i t ual
> regeneration will fit them to take their rightful place in the
> World Order of Bah6' u' ll6h .

With deepest love and devotion,

The Local Spiritual Assembly .

Intimately interwoven with the recounting of the major even~s il ~e
t he stories of the Bahi 'i helpers and pioneers who made this epi c a
reali t y . From a statistical stand- point alone it is a remarkable story.
From a human stand-point it i s one .of coutage , determination, self-
sa crifi~e . love, devotion and selfless service which was to lead
eventually co the opening of the whole of Wal es to the Cause of
Bah6 ' u ' l lah .

Would tha t it were possible to do f ull justice to those gallant
workers to whom we, of the new Baha' i generation, owe such a de bt of
gratitude ; but tha t is a tas k beyond my ability and I can but endeavour
to tell something of their arrivals and departures and of the par es they
played a s the newly formed assembl y strove to achieve both stability and
maturity .

Wonderfully support ing these , our ever -welcome pioneers were
those prec ious souls who were attracted by the message and who declared
their faith in Baha 'u'llah, the Redeemer of mankind .

In the fifteen years at present under re view these newl y-won
souls numbered th irty. Of them five were youth under 21. Of the 25
adult declarants, two still r emain in Cardiff; seven have pioneered to
other goals ; eight have withdrawn; four have passed to the Abha Kingdom;
and the destinies of :the remaining. fou r are un recor ded . Of the youth
de clarant~ one remains a stal wa rt worker for the cause.

We have no way of knowi ng how these fi gures compare with those
of ot her areas, but , deeply though Ye may r egret the loss of those who ,
fo r wha t ever r eason, feel that they are una ble co continu e in the Faith,
tribute must be paid for the service each has rendered according to his
or her abilit y. Without them the assembly may ~ell have foundered and
the progress of the Cause set back, possibly for decades.

George Rowley, having given yeoman service to the Faith in
Cardiff, finally left us to return to Birmingham in July. After
functioning with eight members for four months his place was taken by
Wales' second declarant, Miss Elizabeth Gorvett on November 21st.

In December 1 48 with the return of Ata'o'llah to London . we were down
to eight again. The declaration of Dennis McArthur of Penarth, a young
man of 20, increased the numbers but not the assembly. At the close of
the first year, on the eve of Ridvan 1949, Fred Stahler made his second
pioneer move when he went to maintain the assembly in Bristol.

Cardiff's assembly was saved by the return of Charles Dunning
from Belfast - plus one other pioneer who, however , was unexpectedly
recalled to India even before the L.S.A. had met to elect its officers .

The City of Cardiff and the adjacent town of Penarth were
separated in those days by a large area of marshland, over half a mile
in parts . Today this area is largely developed. However, Penarth
retains its separa te identity and is now part of the dis trict of the
Vale of Glamorgan which has its own local assembly . In t he 1940 1 s and
19SO's assembly areas were less restricted than they are today and our
near and dear neighbours in the 'Vale' will be interested to know that
Dennis McArthur was the first Baha'i in their district. On reaching
the age of twenty one in July 1949 , he took his place on the Cardiff
L.S.A. Three months later, fired by the longing for greater service,
he achieved the distinction of becoming the very first of ' Cardiff's own'
pioneers when he moved to Blackpool, then striving to achieve its f irst
assembly.

Charles Dunning had also left Wales to go to his second pioneer-
ing post; that of opening the virgin territory of Sheffield. At Ridvan
1950 the assembly was maintained by Miss Siri Bischoff of Norway and
Miss Ruth Schar from Berne in Switzerland.

'·
The year 1950/51 witnessed even greater changes in t he Cardiff
community . In October we said a sad but fond farewell to two of our
founding members, Violet and Hugh McKinley. Hugh had been asked to
take over the secretaryship of the consolidation committee by the N.S.A.
and it became advisable for him to live in London. Two months later
Miss Gorvett had to return to Norway . In January 195 1 the third of our
found ing members left . Claire Gung set sail for Af rica to he r historic

pioneering pose.

Here we must digress briefly to relate to the national scene.

April 21st, 1960 had seen the glorious consumation of the British Baha'i
community's Six Year Plan - the election of no less than 24 assemblies.
The original five had been maintained plus the nineteen new L.S . A. s
called fo r by the Guardian. This plan was succeeded by the "Two Year
Afr ica Campaign", designed and destined to open that continent to the
Faith . Hugh's appointment t o the consolidation commi ttee was to relieve
Philip Ha insworth who was also preparing to go to Africa. In Nov ember
our beloved Claire wrote to inform the assembly that she had obtained
a post in Tanganyika and that she would be sailing on January 4th.

In five short months we had suffered the loss of no less than five of
our members and we were only saved from becoming inquorate by the
declaration of Mr Andrew McArthur, Dennis's father . He became a ]aha' i
in September and he took his place on t he assembly shortly after . The
re-es tablishment of the Spiritual Assembly of the Bah~'fs of Cardiff in
1951 reads like a fairy tale . Hassan Sabri had joined us in February,
to be joined later by Isobel locke on t he occasion of their marri age.
Dennis McArthur had already found a lovely Baha 'i bride in Blackpool
and they had now decided t o r eturn to Wales. Then, on March 26th we had
two more declarations . Thomas and Patricia Roberts of Grangetown,
Cardiff . Now we have eleven believers - but Bristol still needed two.
Though Hassan had only with great difficulty obtained accommodation for
himself and his bride , they wi llingly aba ndoned this to cross the
channel to Bristol, thus sa ving anot her assembly.

Four days after tha t truly memorable Ri9van came yet ano t her
occasion for r ejoicing. We can only i magine the excitement and joy in
every heart when Brian, Joan Gidding' s husband, became a Baha ' i .
And so the steady flow of pioneers continued; some to sta y for a few
shore weeks, some remaini ng to serve for month s - and on into yea rs.
This was the pat tern which held until 1959.

In that year Cardiff enrolled seven new believers and since
that day they have not only been self-supporting but Cardiff Baha'is
have in their turn pioneered; in Wales, to Gt . Britain and to lands
across the seas. (As an interesting 'footnote' to illustrate this ,
t here are today, in 1986 , seven Baha 'is residing in t he Western I s les ,
all of whom started their Bah6'! lives in the City which the Guardian
had desig nated 'The pivotal Centre for Wales .'

To return now to the teaching work we will go back to 1949 when,
on November 27th, Philip Hainsworth , on behalf of the N.T.C. came to

consult with the assembly. Many plans were considered, chief among
which was that we should now try to reach the suburbs. Eventually
meeting rooms wer e found in five districts. These were, - Maindy
Recreation Centre; Canton Community Centre; Rumney Memorial Hal~ Roath
Park Huts and the Clive Hall in Grangetown.

Posters were dis played outside of each Hall and hundreds of
postcard notices put into local shops. Visiting speakers, May White <iH<l
Prudence George came to help and in January, between the 12th and the
18th, a meeting was held in each of these cen tr es. Finally a reception
was held for enquirers at the Royal Hotel. The report sen t to the
National Teaching Committee thanked the visiting teachers and pr~sed
them for the excellent contact work achieved. This series of meetings
was followed up by five weekly stud y courses held on Friday evenings
from February 3rd to March 3rd .

It was during this mon th also that we had welcomed the two young
lady pioneers, Siri Bischoff, a Norwegian came to us from Oxford, Ruth
Schar, a newly declared Baha'i from Berne. The arrival of these two
radiant souls ensured that the assembly could be redeclared come Ridvan
of this vital year, 1950.

One cannot let this critical and highly charged last few weeks
of the Six Year Plan go without special mention. The final surge towards
victory following the N.T.C. 's ' Impassioned plea' to the entire community
of Ma·rch 27th .

There were 24 days left twenty-nine vacancies still to be filled .

The success of the plan to date and the immense effort to achieve these
really staggering results had fired the imagination of the entire Baha'i
world. Three National Assemblies had that weekend united in prayer for
our success. John Robarts, chairman of the N.S .A. of Canada, having
turned down teaching requests througtout his homeland in order to enjoy
U1ree weeks holiday save up his plans in order to spend the time in
helping us . From London he visited eight 'Centres'~ in England, Scotland
and Ireland in the space of ten days. Before he left Canada a young
lady had said to him, - " If they neec one more to 'get the Plan' wire me
and I will go." The N.S.A . of Canade cabled, - "Delighted privilege
participate through John Roberts in closing historic days your Six Year
Plan stop whole Canadian Bahe'{ community join their prayers for over-
whelming victory."

That the victory was achieved is now enshrined in the Annals
of the Cause of God in our Home land.

Chapter Four

In recalling these momentous days it is noc easy to know what
to include and what to omit . If all were recorded the story would net
only assume impossible proportions but it would become rather boring as
well; if anything is left out it could well be that important and
interesting items are sacrificed for lesser matters. Yet how often it
it is that the apparently 'little' things are the 'leaven' which enriches
the whole. Let us cite two such incidents, one from way, way back and
one much mo re recent.

One of our early con tacts from the very earliest days was Mrs
Mary Fuller, a war widow. Early in 1951 Rose Jones had to have an
operation on her arm; at the same time her young daughter, Irene, became
very ill . Mary became a constant visitor to the home, fetching and
cleaning, shopping and helping in every possible way until the emergency
was passed; a real friend in need . Mary was a faithful supporter of the
Cause for 17 years before she decided to declare. That was in 1966 .
She was over 80 "'hen she passed to the Abha Kingdom in 1982 and she is
buried in the Cardiff Western Cemetry in the Baha '{ plot which holds the
mortal remains of the Knight of Baha'u'llah, Charles Dunning and those
of another Bah~'{, Mrs tlise Ham. tlise was a friend for many years
standing of the Card family. Both tlise and Mary had served on the
Local Assembly . Shortly after this time Rose lost her husband. Being·
in poor health and with her two young daughters to bring up, she had,
very reluctantly to return to London. In September 1951, Cardiff's
first Baha'i and an L.S.A. member since its inception in 1948 was
welcomed 'home' by the London assembly - whose secretary at that time
was her forme r Cardiff co-worker, Hugh McKinley.

Our next story came in reply to the Author ' s appeal in the Baha'f
journal of March 1985 for recollections of 'the early days in Wales'.
An example, is it not, of one of the seeds which are left by the
'wayside' oftimes forgotten, yet destined to blossom in God's good tioe
into yet another '.fJower' for his garden. I thank the writer for
permission to include it.

> "I read your request for reminiscences of the early days in \./ales.

Very best wishes,

The twelve months from Ridvan 1950 to 1951 were regarded as a
breathing space during which Baha'is, after exhausting efforts of the
Six Year Plan, could consolidate their positions, marshall their fo r ces
take stock and generally prepare for the tasks which lay ahead of them.
The two year Africa campaign began officially in April 1951 but
preparations for this next stage in our development had been going on
long before this with the call for pioneers t o prepare for an even more
demanding challenge.

By March 1951 the Bulletin of the Africa committee reported,-
"We have already had contact wi th twenty-six believers desiring to
pioneer to Africa. Two have succeeded in arriving there, at least a
dozen or more have fully committed their hopes and efforts to finding
ways and means .•. ,,, and others are i n t he stage of consultation . The
fact that this great response to the Guardian's heartfelt call t o Af rica
has occurred before the 'formal' opening of the Britis h Two Year Plan ,
which commences next convention, gives bright promise for the unfoldment
of the Faith in this vas t continent."

·· The Africa Committee's faith was fully justified. At the outset
the National Assemblies of Gt. Britain , America and Egypt collaborated
and the story of that great campaign's progress will be t he subject of a
far mighti~r tome than this. That is, for obvious reasons, beyond the
scope or purpose, of this little volume; (though we do feel we have a
very intimate link through our very dear Claire). Let it suffice then
for the present to r ead again the Gua rdian' s cable to Convention of 1953.

> "Warmly congratulate assembled delegates Baha'f community British
> Isles celebrating most great Festival Holy Year on magnif i cent
> victories achieved African continent, exceeding highest hopes. Plan
> formulated two years ago , originally conceived (as a) mere prelude
> (to the) African campaign, assumed such proportions, yielded· such
> fruit, (es to) deserve (to) be regarded (as a) distinct stage campaign
launched British Baha' 1 community beyond bor ders homeland ..... "

Meanwhile consolida tion on the home front coulJ not be allowed
to suffer . This was emphasised again in the Guardian ' s message to
Teaching Conference of that year. "Appeal attendants Conference focus
attention fleeting months ahead consolidation home front constituting

vital phase second collective enterprise British Baha'i history."

In Cardiff this three year period followed the pattern which
had obtained duri ~g the previous five. Public meetings and Firesides
with visiting teachers and speakers; publicity through the press and
personal teaching continued . Each year at Election time the struggle to
ensure t hat, come the Most Great Festival, our numbers would be     .
sufficient for the Assembly to be maintained. Ridvan 1952 though was a
landmark. The first time for the assembly t o be elected and not declared
Elizabeth Gorvett had returned from London , Miss Evelyn Baxter moved in
to r eplac e Rose Jones, and, on April the lst the declaration of Jack
Gould brought our numbers at Ridvan up to ten.

When the Assembly was re-declared in 19S3 only two of the
original nine members remained. They were Mrs Brian Giddings and Mrs
Suzanne Solomon. In five years 27 Baha ' is had shared the honou r of
serving the Cause in Cardiff . This year, Ridvan 1953, saw the launching
by the Baha'{ world of the beloved Guardian's 'Ten Year Crusade'. There
were now twelve National Assemblies and these were called upon to conduct
this decade long campaign to take the message of Baha'u ' llah to the rest
of the world.

I nitially fourteen 'Goals' were set before the British Baha'is
as their contribution to the Plan. These included, among others, the
purchase of a National Haziratu'l-quds; the opening of eleven virgin
territories ranging from the Faroes in the North down to South West
Africa . Also to double the number of assem~lies in the British Isles
from twenty four to forty eight.

The time had now come for even greater emphasis to be placed on
the need for expansion throughout the principality .

We had had five years in which to establish a firm foundation in
Cardiff, but as yet the number of native believers was very few. Already
Newport t o the East, Pontypridd in the North and Swansea, 40 miles to
the West had been seriouly consider ed for extension teaching progra~~es
but the 'home base' was still subjec t to periodic fluc tuat ion between
numerical weakness and strength.

Many of our much loved and valued supporters, both from among
the newly won souls and those who had pioneered in to maintain the
stre ngth, had, for a variety of reasons, been compelled to leave us,some
to return to their former posts; others to pioneer to places where the
need was greater. Dennis, Penarth's first Baha'i, and his wife, Eileen,

left for a new li:e and a new field of service in Australia, that was in
1955\. Sadly, but inevitably, there were those who gave of their time,
their talents end their service for a while only to withdraw or to cease
from active participation. Six years of the Ten Year Crusade were to
pass - twelve years of the Cause in Wales - before the need for 'replace-
ments' finally came to an end.

Not only pioneers but still the flow of visiting speakers came to
help and inspire. In May 1953 Mr Eruch Munsiff presented a film of the
Holy Shrines to a gathering of twenty Baha'is and their friend s . Mr and
Mrs Stanley Bolton, ex-chai rman and secretary of the N.S.A. of

'A 11~t ralasia'. addressed a public meeting and a fi reside in August. In
September, also from the Antipodes, Hiss Marie Dunning presented a slide
show. In the following March a visit by Mr Nemat Sabour, Nemat was an
Iraqi Baha'i student studying in Swansea where he had done a great deal
of work in making the name ' Baha'i' known in that town. Dr Grossman
visited us in July '54, followed by Marion Hofman, Mrs Beale and Ruth
Moffat . Dan Jordan, studying music in Baliol College, Oxford, di vided
his spring vacation between Torq uay, Bristol and Cardiff. These are but
some of the well-known, greatly loved servants of God who helped to lay
the foundations of the Faith in Wales .

By Februa~y 1955, the Cardiff community was at its l owest ebb
ever, counting only four active believers. Mary Sabit rroved in to bring

the 'numbers up to five. Captain Brian Giddings retu rned home from sea .

Phyliis Lewis pioneered from Liverpool just before Ridvan and Dav id and
Marion Hofman left Oxford for Cardiff to enable the Assembly to be
re-established. Phylli s, unable to find work or accommodation, had to
ret urn to Liverpool but she wa s replaced by Dr Ernest Miller .
Dr Miller , now approaching his 70th bir t hda y, sold hi s ~ractice i n
Liverpool in order to pioneer to Cardiff. Even so , in the inte res t of
historical accuracy, it must be recorded tha t it was touch and go whe t her
the Cardiff Assembly would be maintained on tha t critical Ridvan of 1955 ,
for having lost our ninth member immediately after the declaration on
April 20th it was necessary to confer with the National Assembly, and
ult imately with the Guardian himself concerning our sta tus.
Significantly, the beloved Guardian cabled reply was adcressed to 'The
Cardif f Spiritual Assembly'.

From four believers in February to the recognition of the
Assembly by the N.S . A. in thei r letter of July 19 , Cardiff had come
through its most severe crisis and reached the turning po int f rom which
they s l owly but s~rely advanced towards complete stabi l ity and which
opened the way for the extens ive teaching programmes "'hich were
eventually to carry the message of Bah&'u'llih throughout the whole of

Wales.

In May 1956, Joan Giddings returned to Bradford with her husband
Brian, and after a short spell they pioneered once again, this ti~e to
Canterbury where the y became fou nding members of the Cathedral City's
first Spiri tual Assembly. Thus was sever ed the last link with the eigh:
original pioneers who opened Wales to the Faith. Brian, in his
reminiscences, reca l ls, -

> ''Looking back all those years it always seemed to me that Joan put
> in so much work and dedication into the Faith and yet somehow never
> saw t he positive results of her ;;ork."

Work and dedication and sacrifice there certainly was, and,
looking now from her home in the kingdom of Abha, - Joan passed away in
October '78 - those 'positive results' are such as "ould gladden any
heart.

It seems that the period fron 1956 to '58 marked a stage of
transition which may in some ways be likened to the passing from the
'Heroic Age' of the development in Wales, to the 'Formative Age'. Xo"'
the long hoped for, long dreamed of, process of expansion slowly began
to take shape . David and Marion Hofman and Dr Ernest Miller had been
in Cardiff since 1955. May 23rd '56 saw the declaration of David M.
Lewis . In August of that year Miss Barbara Simmonds joined us from
London . David and Barbara Married tvo years l ater, in 1958. Suzanne
Solomon, Jack Gould and other local declarants and later the Knight of
Baha'u'llah, Chas. Dunning, all helped to maintain the Assembly and its
activities during t hese crucial years.

In 1957 the National Assembly asked Cardiff to nominate a 'Goal
Town' for extension teaching. The town chosen was Pontypridd. Once
again the pattern which seems to be repeated so often, applied. The
first 'seeds' had been planted as far back as 1948 when Claire Gung
spent a week in the home of Mrs Newman, and her daughters Beatrice,
Mary and Florence in Cilfynydd. It used to be said, - "Wherever Claire
goes, her sewing machine goes too , " and this week in 1948 was again a
dress-making appointment. There the Ne;;'l11an family first heard the name
'Baha'! ' but they were Baptists, staunch and true; Beatrice being a
deaconess in their church . The idea of a new Revelation was intrig uing ,
but . .... .

In 1956, the Tidings were broJght once again to their notice.

Dr Miller had given a pamphl et to a fri end who was also a colleague of
Beatrice's and , seeing it in his possession, she said she would like to
read it, 'if he had finished with it'. The re- awakened interest led

her to get in touch once again with Claire (now at her pioneering post
in Africa) who put her in touch with Dr Miller. Consequently the
Newmans were invited to attend the Week-end School being held at
Porthcawl.

The Porthcawl Week-end School should have a chapter to itself.

Held at the Esplanade Hotel on the 10th and 11th of November 1956, it
was the first ever to be held in Wales. Planned over many months with
meticulous care and great enthusiasm it attracted supporters from far
and near. Baha'is from Sheffield and from Eccles in Lancashire attended,
the total being in excess of twenty five; few perhaps by todays standards,
but it was a start. To this school came Beatrice and she was astonished
to be greeted, and introduced by Mrs Hofman to the company assembled as

'the friend of Claire Gung' (not realising perhaps what a 'closely knit'

community the Baha'i World was). There did not seem to her to be
anything about the 'teachings', or a bout the BahA' {s themselves to 1.•hich
she could take exception; but surely it was not possible that any soul,
any prophet however greatly to be honoured, could take the place of her
beloved Jesus.

Following this school, this message was addressed His Eminence,
Shoghi Rabbani, Haifa, Israel.

With devoted love,

Cardiff Spiritual Assembly

In his reply the Guardian expressed his delight that the Faith
is progressing in Wa les and stated that he , "felt sure that the Welsh
people will not only respond to the message., .• but (will) contribute
to the Faith a distinctive share of their own .... " He hoped that there
would indeed be Welsh Summer Schools in the future. Baha ' is of t oday,
with memories of 'Har lech' and 'l.landrindod \.'ells' will appreciate t he
extent to which that hope has been fulfilled.

During the summer of 1957 Mrs Loise K. Sparro"' of the U. S. A.

spent several months 'planting the seeds' in Llangollen in North Wales
and some t~elve months prior to this, David Hofman, travelling in
connection with his publishing business met up with a young salesman
in a Se~to1.•n Hotel. He 1.•as Eric Kent, a member of the Pentecostal

Movement i n Caerphil ly and as eage r to spread the Gospel of Christ as
David was t o speak of 'His return'. They discussed their particular
views on religion at some length and on parting agreed to keep: i n' toucb.
David took his new- found fri end's addre ss - and promptly lost it.

In t he fo l l owing March, travelling by   train to visit an ·
exhibition David and Eric found themselves in       the same dining car and
this time resolved not to lose contact. Eric        became a visitor to the
Hofman home where he discussed the Faith with       Marion and where he met
the other Cardiff Baha'{s .

Meanwhile the customery pattern of programmes continued locall y
and similar events were now being organised in Pontypridd. A series
of public meetings were held with residen t and visiting speakers,
mainly at the Pon typridd Y.M.C.A., and when, to wards the end of 1957
the ' Christ and Baha'u'llah' Campaign took place one of the meetings
organised was held in Pontypridd's Coronation Hall. This Campaign
foll owed t he publication of the book by Hand of the Cause George
Townsend entitled "Christ and Baha'u'llah" . Five hund red invitation
cards were printed and dist ributed; 200 programmes produced;
advertisements were carried on the buses and also in the local papers.
Many of the invitations were sent to the clergy of various denominations
and several received a copy of the book . In addition an "Open letter
to the Christians" composed by Dr Miller was widely distributed and a
co py was submitte d t o the local Press.

Then anothe r milestone was reached in t he development of the
Faith in Wales when Eric Kent declared. Thus was opened another Welsh
town to t he Cause of God, Caerphilly , seven miles to the no rth of
Cardiff .

Chapter Five
I know not how I may befittingly portray the mind- numbing,
heart- shattering event which next overtook t he Baha'i World - so I
shall not t r y to do so .

On November 4th 1957, suddenly , unexpectedly but peacefully,
the Beloved Guardian passed away.

He who had unerringly led the believers for thirty six years
since the passing of the Master was no longer physically in our midst .

Shoul d any of the younger generation of Baha'is wish to glean,
in at least some small measure, an understanding of what this tragic
event meant to those who had learned to love, respect and to follov
their 'True Brother, Shoghi,' let them read - "The Passing of Shoghi
Effendi" by Amatu'l-Baha Ruhiyyih Khanum.

No"' the Beloved Guardian's l.'isdom and foresight became manifest
more clearly than ever before. The half- way stage of the Ten Year
Plan , that great Global Crusade, destined to culminate in the election
of our supreme body, The Universal House of Justice , had been reached
when its inaugurator and inspirer was taken from us. But the plans had
had been made, t he goals set and the end ordained. The Ins titution of
the Hands of the Cause had been established; the International Baha'i
Council appointed;*the Hands of the Cause had been designated in the
Guardian's last message to the Baha ' is as "the Chief Ste••ards of the
Embryonic \.lorld Common,,.·ealth of Baha ' u ' llah," and the crusade , - a s
though endowed with a momentum of its own, surged onward to its
triumphant conclusion - still beneath the guiding hand of Shoghi Effendi,
our Guardian.

Throughout 1958, with the willing co- operation and assistance
of Beatrice Newman the work in Pontypridd continued and in January 1959
she accepted the Lordship of Baha'u ' llah and declared herself a believer
- realising that this was no denial of her Lord but rather obedience
to His command.

Even then it had not dawned upon the friends in Cardiff that
their first objective had been achieved for it was noc until Miss
Ne~'Tllan was en route with others of the community to Teaching Conference
in Blackpool that the full significance of her declaration dawned upon
them; for they learned that Cilfynydd was actually within the
administrative Borough of Pontypridd. The cable co the Hands of the
Cause in the Holy Land from that Conference included the words, -
"Declaration opens Pontypridd. "

Those lovingly planted seeds, having taken root , now began to
flourish. In April Beatrice's sister, Mary became a Baha'i followed
in ~ay by Jack Tomlinson and Gethin Jones. Then a Regional Teaching

..   In 1961 this Council became an 'elected' body .

Committee was appoin ted for Wales, ( the previous R.T .C. having covere~
the whole South Western Region) . Its members were, - David and Bar~a~a
Lewis , Er ic Kent and Beatrice Newman .

In troducing t hemse lves to the friends in their Open Letter of
July 10 th they wrote, "We have t he Faith , the ,_.hole of \./ales - and
about seventeen believers. '' Though this 'history' of necessity
concent rates on the County of Glamorgan we must not forget that t he
Light had been kindled in other parts of \./ales as well. Jean and Arthur
Pitcher 'held t he fort' in Ta l-y-bont, 7 miles Sou th of Harlech,
(Arthur declared in 1961) . Rafi Mavaddat was in Bangor and for a "'hi le
there "'ere two other pionee rs '-'ith him. Abermrnan had a lone re present-
ative in Mrs Kelleher and there l.'ere two Baha'{ youth at school in
Dolgellau, Bahiyy ih Nakh javani and May Hofman. It may therefore be
sa id that through the functions and operation of this committee the
whole country of Wales was no"' the object of extension teaching from
the Pi votal cen tre and its t'-'O, newly fledged, Goal towns.

But first we '-'ill re- direct our attention to t he exciting events
in Pont ypr idd and i n South Wales general ly. Four months later Jack's
wife Nancy declared. This fo l lowed a visit made by Ali Nakhjavani as
reported in the Bahi ' i Jour nal NQ 141 of November 1959.

> "Ali visited Pont ypr idd for 12 days f r om 8th to 19th of Augus t. A

September 1st saw our fifth declaration since January, Mrs Nancy
Tomlinson , ( "'hich) gives us our first Baha'i family in Pontypridd."

This article in the Pontypridd Observer covered 28 column inches.

> It retated in detail many of the events recorded above together with
> personal detai ls of the members and it concluded lo'ith a comprehens ive
> (and a lmost accurate ) account of the birth of the Bahs'! Revelation
> and of its main tenets .

In April a One Day School had been held at Ogmore-by-sea: in
> Jul y a picnic at \.li g-fach. Paul Adams - on leave from his pioneer
post in Spitzbergen - attended the picnic and he a lso visited Cardiff

and Pontypridd. On October 17th a One Day School was held in
Caerphilly - a 'first' for that town. All in all 1959 was a year o~
unprecedented expansion for Wales, and its telli ng can be summar ised
in no better manner than by quoting, more or less verbatim , from the
Sews Letter issued by the W.R.T.C. in January 1960 , -

> " ..... in January 1959, Beatrice Newman became a Baha'i and now ,
> one year later, we are happy to repor t that hers was the first of

> "The One Day School in Caer philly was attended by nine people .. .

> 30th of September . ''

Carl and his wife, Joyce, had been fo llowers of the Theosophical
movement and it was a friend whom they had met there who told them
about the forthcoming Baha'i meeting of September 30th. There they
heard Hr David Hofman speak on "Thief in the night." A new book by
Hand of the Cause, Bill Sears which was about to be published .
Intrigued by this new Revelation and attracted by the sincer ity and
friendliness of the Baha'{s they met , t hey accepted the invitation to
attend Firesides at the home of the Lewis's. A second meeting, this

time addressed by Mrs Munsiff and, on the following week-end, the One
Day School in Caerphilly . There had been fireside meetings at the
Lewis's home every week for three years . In that period there had been
one new believer, Yvonne Williams; but now the rapid expansion previous-
ly referred to took on even greater momentum . In nine months from
October '59 to August '60, Cardiff doubled its numbers by declarations.
Joyce Card and Terry Delacey followed shortly after Carl. In March
Char les Stafford declared ; in June Dermod Knox and in August, Peter and
Gwyneth Hassan. This was the opportun ity for which David and Marion
had been waiting. From a community of five, only Syears previous l y
there was now a community of fourteen and at its meeting of September
23rd the Hofmans announced that they would be leaving for London prior
to teking up their new pioneering post in Watford.

It was naturally with a measure of regret that their departure
was accepted - but i t should always be remembered that Cardiff, and
Pontypridd also, had enjoyed the special privilege of close association
with three of the future members of the Universa l House of Justice. ~r
Ian Semple and Ali Nakhjavani as frequent visiting teachers, and David
(together with Marion) for their four and a half years of invaluable
and unst inting service.

Chapter Six

What other highlights illumined the year 1960 up to Ridvan
1960? In February Eric' s wife, Beatrice became a Bah~'{ and Caerphilly
headed for 'Group' status . In May Dorothy Gibson's declaration brought
Pontypridd's number up to seven. Also in May a well at tended Week-end
School in Bangor and we were grateful to the fri ends in Chester and
Liverpool for their constant support of t his goal town . Bangor is over
200 miles by road from Cardiff; narrow, twisting and often mountainous
roads for the most part . However, at Bangor's next Week-end School in
October a car load of friends from Cardiff and Pontypridd did make the
journey by car. The green and russet and gold of the Autumn foliage
that year , amidst the wild, Welsh hinterla nd was a memory never to be
forgotten; nor was the fact that twice an electrical fau lt all but set
the car on fire and that the return journe y on the Sunday night was
undertaken with virtually no lights. (The two policemen who stopped
us were very understanding.)

In Cardiff a Baha'f display at the Horticultural Show in
September was manned for three days by relays of friends from the three
centres and arising directly from this, another declaration; in March
Hrs Ruby Wo~lway became a member of our growing community.

Just four years after the first historic occasion another Week-
end School was held at the Esplanade Hotel in Porthcawl . Among the
invited speakers were John Morley of Reading, Marion Hofman and
Meherangiz. A wonderfu l time was enjoyed by all who were privileged to
be present.

In January Beatrice Ne\Jlllan was accorded the honour of represent-
ing Wales at the dedication of the Kampala Temple. The Baha'i Journal
reports; - "On January 14th the Mother Temple of Africa was dedicated
by Amatu'l-Baha Ruhiyyih Khanum and we are happy to be able to report
that Beatrice Ne ..man, David Hofman, James Robertson and Lisbeth Greeves
all attended, representing respectively Wales, England, Scotland and
Ireland." On her return Beatrice wrote a moving account of her visit
to Africa. Press reports covering the event appeared twice in the South
Wales Echo, in the Newport Argus and in the Pontypridd Observer. She
also recorded an interview vith the B.B.C ...•hich was broadcas~ on the
Welsh Home service on March 8th. Several invitations followed and
Beatrice gave talks to schools and to local organisations on ~e r visit
to Africa.
,

In March the Cardiff Assemb:y was able to repor t that
preparations for Incor·poration "'ere well under way and in Pontypridd.
Emily Eastgate, who had offered a three weeks 'teaching' visit agreed
to remain for three months. Walter Wilkins offered to become the ninth
member so that the Assembly in Pontypridd could be established at Ridvan .
Their pioneer offers however were not required; t he third Ne~man sister,
Flo', and Chris and Betty Seldon all declared that month , - together
with Miss Sally Thomas whose home '-'as in Tonyrefail. Four declarations
and now ten resid ent Bah~'is: Pontypridd elected its f irst Ass embly
and the pioneers were freed to move to towns where they were needed.
The Baha 'i Journal of June 1961 records, -

> "On April 21st not tive but six new local Spiritual Assemblies "·ere
!ormed, in Chester, Pontypridd, Watford, Wokingham and Canterbury
and l::psom.

Pontypridd is the first 'all native ' Assembly to be formed in the
> British Isles, it is composed eJtirely of Welsh believers and they
> had to have an election as they have a community of ten. They
> established another record too, for all this work has been done
without at any stage sending in o pioneer ... ·•

The account goes on to record :he other victory as a supre~e
moment i n the History of the Faith - that an Assembly has been formed
in Canterbury, t he · seat of the Primate of the Church of England.

In Se~ tember 1961 t he Nat iona l Assembly s uggested that 'Cardiff'

should undertake to wr ite a His tor y of the Faith in that tovn. A
sub- committee was appointed to consider ways and means and,
principally to sor t out t he Archive material. what a good thing
that no ' vital' plans depended on its complet i on. Ye~ '. the wr it er
was a member of that commit tee .) Well : it has onl y taken twenty
five years, and, of course, it embraces a little more than ju~t
'Cardiff's history as a result . (But I wonder how many other
good intentions have ' fallen by t he wayside ' ?)

The Spiritual Assembly of Pontypridd was ted no ti me in
organi sing functions themselves and on November 15/ 26th the:r fi rst
Week- end School was held at Glan- y-Mor in Barr y . All six sessions
were chaired by local believers and the speakers were, David Lewi s
and Eric Kent from 'home' and David and Marion Hofman and Adib
Taherzadeh from away. It was a wonderful ' fi rst' for a new , young
Assembly .

So 1961 draws to its close and now we enter the last 'calendar
year' of the Ten Year Crusade. In January Beatrice and Flo '
became the fir st Welsh Pilgrims to the World Centre. It i s of
interest to note that the first 'Iri sh' pil grim - at about the same
time - was Dermod Knox who, as will be remembered was a Cardiff
declarant .

Shortly after this Terry Delacey brought t o the Cardiff L.S .A.

an idea which was calculated to take the City and its environs by
storm . Let us , he proposed, ha ve 10 ,000 letters printed; an 'Open
Le tter to t he People of Wales ' , and distribute them in stracegic
areas door t o door . The idea was intrigui ng - but could it be done?
and at wha : financial cost? The propos ition was placed before the
National Assembly who involved the National Teaching Committee.
Conferences were held and every imeginable implication considered.
A new version of the letter was s ubmitted and consulted upo~ at
l eng th . Eventually everybody agreed on a shortened version of
Terry ' s original draft. But the N.S.A. in its wisdom asked, -
"Is it justifiable to spend some £:300 in one small area, ho ...ever
deserving, when England , Scotland anrl Ireland have equa l , if not
greater , need?"

Finally it 1.•as agreed that £250 would be allocated for a 'pilot

scheme' in Cardiff and dist rict and that the other three main centres
could then have similar campaigns, modified if necessary in the light
of experience gained. Cardiff, Pontypridd and Caerphilly were to be
covered , not by 10,000 but by 20,000 'open letters' . One sign ificant
decision of the planning committee was that the letters were to be
regarded as something more than mere 'hand-bills' and that each one
should be delivered in its own envelope addressed "An Open Letter to
the People of Wales". On the eve of the opening of t he campaign some
half a dozen volunteer youth from far and near, together with some of
the 'oldies' spent the best part of a long week-end at H Baha'i home
folding and enveloping t he letters. Some of the visiting helpers who
were free to remain stayed to assist with their distribution. The
followin~ is extracted from the Assemblies Annual Report for B. E. 119 .

"The year commenced with final preparations being made for the
Welsh campaign, designed to bring the Faith to the attention of the
people of South Wales, and organised by a special committee set up for
this purpose by the N.S .A. During the campaign which lasted from May
to September, 20,000 letters to the people of Wales were distributed
by hand by the friends themselves, and with the assis tance of Bah~'i
you th from farther afield. Ten thousa nd letters were distributed in
Cardi ff and S,000 each in Caerphilly and Pontypridd.

In Cardiff ninety 'buses carried posters in the week prior to
the campaign, thi rty shops displayed window cards during the first
month , some of which were rene1.•ed for a longer period . A Yeek' s
exhibition in the Temple of Peace and Health coincided with the opening
of the campaign in Cardiff. Advertisements in the loca l Press gave
good coverage, and although the papers were at first slow to respond in
accepting news of the campaign the South Wales Echo eventually printed
a long article and large photograph. Altogether four t een Public
Meetings were held in the area in May with follow-up meeLings in June
and July in each of the three centres concerned. Of these, a total of
seven public meetings were held in Cardiff.

In May, Hand of the Cause John Ferraby visited Cardiff speaking
at a public meeting and providing the excellent interview with the Press
which led to the article referred to above. On the 21st May a reception
was given for John at the Park Hotel to which the Lord Mayor and the
Lord Lieutenant for the county of Glamorgan, together with other
notables, had been invited . As we had comparatively little notice of
the plan the response was not as good as it might hav~ been, but at
least the local officials had now heard the name 'Baha'{'. The 'Bus
posters drew a response from the T.W.W. (Television Wales and the West)

programme, and, seeing the name 'Baha'{ had sent a camera unit to St.
David's to interview Bishop Richards i n Welsh. His answers t o questi on s
seemed to be based on his knowledge of the Faith gained in Per sia which
he had left in 1927 .

The T. W.\./, aut horities had previously said that they 1.·ould be
happy to give Heherangiz Hunsiff a fu rthe r interview in the programr.ie
'This Week ', linking t he interview with t he campai gn. This took place

on the 1st June and unfortunately they also presented the Bishop of
St. David's whose poor knowledge of the Faith, largely gained from its
enemies , tended to confuse the in terv iew . However, in s pite of thi s ,
Meherangiz prese nted the Faith in a way perhaps only she can do, making
a st riki ng contrast to the Bishop's negative att itude.

During th e campaign too, books were presented to the Newport
Publ ic Library. The campaign closed with an i nspi ring Weekend School
at ' Coleg'y' Fro', Rhoose, which was excellently attended and so set the
the Se<J l on the Campaign . "

An analysis of the impact made by this prolonged and concentrated
effort wa s made by the National Teaching Committee in thei r 'Home Fron t'
issue of August ' 62 . In this they chose the simile of seeds which fa ll
upon stony ground t o exemplify the appa re nt lack of response in the
City, wher ea s, i n the small er ur ban areas continued interest was
maintained. Their repor t continues -

"This lesson i s very evident in the Welsh Campaign where afte r
fourteen publ ic meet ings and wide- scale publicity .... ve r y li ttle
response to t he Message is to be seen, whereas in Pontypridd where
fewer meel ings were held with slightly less publ icity, contacts a re
coming forward, and there is excellent attendence at Firesides. Seeds
have been s ewn in plenty, a ided by tel evision where, fo r t he first t ime
in t he history of the Faith in thi s countr y , an Anglican Bishop appeared
with a Baha'i and discussed the Faith. This achievement alone ••• will
have widespread repercussions in other, more fru itful areas in Wal es.
It s hould be reali sed that these campaigns are of a very experimenta l
nature ; we are learning every da y; we wi l l ma ke many mistakes; but
eventually we hope that we may find the key to the pattern."

The art ic le goes on to outline the plans bei ng made for Scotland
which revolve around five principal centres ,- Glasgow, Motherwell ( t heir
crusade Goal) , Inverness, Aberdeen and finally Edinburgh.

During thes e and the following months a large number of new
Baha '{s were enrol led but it was si~nificant, and to us sur prising -

though none-the-less delightful, that they were all youth. They came
not only from the three main centres but one was from Newport where no
direct teaching had as yet taken place. There had been for a while a
Baha'{ resident in Newport, Mr R. Fitzpatrick, some ten years earlier ,
but it is to Miss Marion Evans the honour must be accorded as the first
Baha'{ to declare in Newport in the County of Gwent .

The above account is really inadequate to do justice to the
five-month-long intensive effort on the part of the South Welsh Baha'is,
continually and unstintingly supported by fellow-believers from near
and far to promote the spread of the message of Baha 'u' llah to the
peoples in their region. To do it full justice, to catalogue the l ong
hours spent in committee; the long journeys from far afield; the
voluminous reports and correspondence; the tendering of estimates and
finalised accounts; indeed, all the wor k that went on behind the scenes
in addition to the briefly out- lined account of the campaign itself -
would occupy space in this brief history somewhat out of proportion in
the context of the twenty five years or more which we are attempting to
cover. Let it suffice then to quote a 'surruning up' made by the National
Spiritual Assembly in their l etter of August 13th, openly addressed to
all who were concerned.

Dear Baha'i friends,

.    The National Assembly has been very pleased indeed with the
work which has been done in S. Wales during the campaign . Some events
stand out strikingly and are of historic importance - the interview on
T.W.W, television service of Mrs Meherangiz Munsiff and t he Bishop of
St. David' s is the most outstanding of these but equally important is
the determined and united effort made by all the f r iends in South Wales
to car ry the message to the Welsh people. This earnes t desire to bring
the Faith to the people gave birth to the campaign and there is no
doubt whate ver that that purpose has been achieved. Now that the
campaign i s entering its last stage, t he National Assembly sends to you
all a message of warm appreciation of your splendid efforts. A Spirit
has been generated in Wales which cannot help but bring great results,
and these may well come in the not too distant future ... We are deeply
indebted to the Hand of the Cause, Hasan Balyusi, for kindly directing
the propagation Board member, Marion Hofman, to the (forthcoming)
consultative meeting, and thus bringing to your deliberations the
bounties and blessings which flow through the institutions of the Hands .

The National Assembly assures you all of our deep gratitude for
your wonderful and sacrificial ef forts, and of our firm conviction that
the seeds sown in this first concerted Campaign in Europe will yield a

:, 7

The concluding paragraph of the Cardiff Assembly's Annual Report
for the year 119 B. E. records that Travel Teachers from Cardi f f, during
t hat year , visited Dublin, Cambridge, Salisbury, Mun'ford , Nor wich,
No r thampton, Exeter, Torquay, Hove, Brighton and Belfast . All of this,
in addition to their involvement with all the l ocal acti vity, which sa)'S
muc h for t he dedicat ion and spir it of serv ice which animated the Bah6'is
of Ct . Britain during the closing mcnths of the Guardian' s Ten Year
Global Crusade .

That Great Crusade was destined to culminate in the gathering of
Baha'is from all over t he world at a Great Congress in celebration of the
hundredth annive r sary of the Declaration of BahA'u'llah in the garden of
Ridvan, to~ether with , the glorious culmination and success ful conclusion
of t he C r u .~;ide it sel f. I r ecall that for a long while back it had becor.ie
the custom of Baha'fs, when parting for an uncertain length of time , to
bid 'Fa r ewell' with the words, - "See you in Baghdad" . Then came t he
news f rom the World Centre that, owing to the pol itical situa tion, for
the BahA'is to meet in Iraq would be inadvisable ; t he refore t he world
Congress, celebra ting The Most Great Jubilee would be held i n the Al bert
Ha l l in London . This was stupendous news for many, especially those in
Britain, for whom a visit to Baghdad would be difficult i f not impossible.

But there were six months or more to go and the laurels yet to be
won . Should you wish to have some i oea of the exciteme nt and tension of
t hese last few months refer back to the account of the closing stages of
the first Six Year Plan; but this time there were 48 Assemblies to be
wo n, not 24; and many other Goals to be achieved, one was the
Incorpo ration of the Car diff Assembly which was registered on the 14th
of March 1962 . Pontypridd, starting the year with ten Baha'is were
reduced to eight when a Baha' i fami ly moved out f rom the district.
Success had to be total; the old Assemblies must be mainta ined as 1.·ell as
the new ones established . A declaration in October brought thei r number
up to s t r ength again. Wales had achieved its goals and as a bonus both
Newport and Swansea were opened. Swansea by the transfe r in of Major
Eric and Mrs Mary Payne.

Thus   it   was in an atmosphere of great joy and eager anticipation

some 25 Baha'is from Wales set out on their journey to London and to the
Albert Hall; to such a gathering as the whole world had never seen before.
Baha'!s from every continent, from every land, from every race, from
every ethnic group, from Alaska to the Antipodes, f rom Japan across the
continents of the globe and back again to the Far East; all gathered
under one roof to give praise and thanks to Baha'u ' l l~ h, their Lord and
the Lord of the Age for the proclamation of the Kingdom of God on Earth.
To greet and to listen enthralled to the Hands of the Cause of God who
had so nobly assumed the burden placed upon them ~ith the passing of
their Beloved Guardian and who had led the Bah~'i World to this glorious
consumma tion. Final ly to meet t he newly elected members of our fi rs t
Universal House of Justice, that August Body, unique in this age-long
Adamic cycle; and to wonder at the Act of Providence which had ordained
that the first ever meeting in session of that Supreme Body (following
their inaugural meeting in Haifa), had been held in our own humble
Haziratu'l-quds.

Twenty of the believers from Wales assembled one afternoon for a
group photograph . They represented t he six centres in South Wales now
'opened' to t he Faith, toRether with dear Claire Gung, 'the Mother of
Africa', and one of Cardiff's own founding members . (Claire remained
at her pioneering post in Africa for thirty three years until her passing
to the Abha Kingdom in 1985.)

.. To tell the whole story of t hose never-to-be-forgotten six days
is naturally an impossibility . Each and every one will have his or her
own special memories; but the Welsh believers had one special joy which
was theirs alone, - for it was noted that on the very next night after
the congress closed, and the Baha'is of the world vent their several ways,
the Albert Hall was filled again when a thousand Welsh voices were raise~
to sing God's praise at 'Cyma nfa Ganu ', t heir Fest i val of song .

The Book of the Prophet Daniel , closes with the words, -
"Blessed is he that l.'aiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred
and five and thirty days. " "Then" wrote Abtlu'l-Baha, in interpretation
of this promise, - "Then, : on this' day·, wil'l the faithful rejoice . "
(Baha'u ' llah and the New Era).
That day had come.   That prophec y, at last fulfille d .

Chapter Seven

This 'sixteen year long history' to da te has been likened to the
"Heroic " and the "Formative" ages in the manner of the ir development .
\.le may ha'le a long way to go before we attain to the "Golden Age", but

> the next ten years may well be classified as the ' si lver' age, or, more
> precisel y to the 'qu ick-silver' age - for it was a period of
unpre ceden t ed mobility,

Activities beyond the confines of the County of Glamorgan had
been sporadic and disconnected . For a while there had been an i solated
believer in Aberdare and one in Neath. Baha'i students had attended
col lege in Swansea and in Bangor ; Hr and Hrs Pitcher had found a ret i re-
me nt home in Ta lybont and Dr Miller in Anglesey. But onl y in Bangor had
there been organised and sustained t eaching activity - supported by
f r i ends from fur ther afield .

The launching of the Nine Year Plan, t he first 'Plan' given to
the Baha'i \.lorld by our Universal House of Justice, and which l asted f rom
1964 to 1973, saw the linking of these formerly disconnected teaching
efforts into one intensive, centrally directed, universally supported
drive to s pr ead t he Good News of the coming of His Kingdom t hroughout
Wales. The choice of Swansea and of Aberystwyth as 'goal' towns in
add ition to Bangor, began the process of encircling the whole of t he
Princi palit y with beacons of light wh ich were destined in time to
illumine also the interior of this, our lovely country, - even as the
sacrificial services of the early pioneers had brought the knowl edge of
t he Love of God, in those now far off days, t o our little corner in the
Sou th East on the Borders of England .

There were at that time (be fore the Boundaries Commission changed
everything) twelve Counties in Wales . Of these five had resident Baha'1s.
The goals of the Nine Year Plan included the establishment of four new
Spiritual Assemblies (a 2007. expansion) and t he opening of each of the
seven remaining Counties . To hel p in the achievement of these goals the
N.S .A. ap pointed a Welsh Teaching Commit tee who se t to 1Jork to co-
ordinate the efforts and activities of the seve ral cen tres.

One of the fir st acts of this committee "'as to suggest to the
committ ee responsibl e for the Midlands area that they should adopt Bangor
(N. Wales) and that we in exchange would take over res ponsi bility for
Ne-.•port (Mon . ) - at that time an 'Engl i sh' to1.,n. This arrangement
having been amicably agreed the Cardi f f , Poncypridd and Caerphi lly
Ba h'' is the n set about the tas k of exten sion teaching; firstl y in Sewpo r t

and Swansea and also i n Aberyst wyth.

In their report to Convention at the end of the first year t he
W.T.C. stated - "The Committee held its first meeting on May 23rd and
considered the goals presented to it by the National Assembly . A
time-table for t he achievement of these goals was decided as follows .
The formation of the L.S.A. of Swansea, and the opening of the Count ies
of Brecknock and Carmarthen by Rid van 1966, the opening of the five
remaining Counties by Ridvan 1967 •.. the establishment of three L.S.A. s ,
.... by 1971 . The remaining two years of the Crusade t o be devoted to
consolidation . "

Slowly at fi rst, then with increasing momentum, t he score or so
souls from Mid-Glamorgan began their siege of t hese citadels. Sometimes
a single car-load, more often three or four would make the journey to
Aberystwyth or to Swansea to support a fires ide , a public meeting or a
week-end school or a one-da y school.

The first pioneers began to move in; Jeremy and Denyse Fox to
Swansea ; Derwent and Nora Maude to Aberystwyth; Dr and Mrs Firoozmand to
Newport to join Viv and Rita Bartlett: and after the pioneers, the first
declarations fol lowed .

Gradually the Faith was becomi ng establ ished . Swansea achieved
the distinction of being the first Assembly to be fo r med and they were
follo..,ed by Aber yst..,yth . No sooner 1•as the Assembly for med in $1.•ansea
than ._,e began to move sti l l further west t o Llanelli and though it "as a
journey of nearly 60 mi les each 'Way the Cardi ff fri ends, t oRether with
S.ansea, l aid siege to Llanelli and our four th L.S. A. goa l "·as no" before
us .

Thus history "a s re peating itself, but the stage "as no longer a
City of 250,000 inhabitan ts but a count ry of t'WO mi l l io n . The journeys
were no longer made on foot or by 'Tram ', but i n cars, coaches , min i -
buses or by train; its participants no longer a dozen or so ga l lan t
pioneers in an almost 'alien' land , but native believers "ho had answered
His call and whose sole desire was to t ake the news of the coming of
Baha'u'llah to their countrymen throughout the length and breadth of the
land . ~or should it be forgotten tha t at our Week- end schools in
part icula r, as wel l as on other occas i ons, we were always and amply
supported by f riends from Bristol and Bath, and Exeter and Torbay , and
even furth er afield.

Thus began the process which has continued until today and

I· l

doubtless will into the future when every County , then e very dist r ict
will have its own 'point of liaht'; ultimately perha ps e very town and
every village will be brought into the Administrative Order of
llaha' u ' lliih and have its O'-'n elected Local House o f Justice .

For the prese nt, the glorious culmi nation of the ~iost Great
Jubi l ee , toaether wi th the brief look at the decade whic h fo llowed !t,
will constitute a fitting c l imax '-'i t h which co bring to a close this
litt le story of t~e coming of the Faith to ~a le s .

It is a heritage of wh ich "e may not only be proud, but also
eternall y grate!u l . May it continue to inspire 'Ge ne r aticns of Baha'is'
who have not as yet awake ned to 'This Evident Light' to a ri se to serve
this cause with cr.e same s pir it of dedication, the sane er.thusiasm, ~he
s ame joy which enabled our Spiritual Forebears to ! o rsa ke the co~!or:
and security of thei r homes in o rder co bring to ~a les tht Glad T!~i~gs
of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah.
