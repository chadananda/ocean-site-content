Narayenrao Rangnath Shethji, better known as Vakil, was born in a well-known Hindu family in Nawsari. He learnt about the Bahá'í Faith from Mirzá Mahram. To him giving the Message of Bahá'u'lláh to others was an essential duty. He became a Bahá'í in 1909.

Mr. Vakil became a graduate in Law, of the Bombay University in 1911. He was an advocate of the Bombay High Court and one of the senior lawyers of Surat. People came from different towns and cities for his advice and benefited from his services. He was always fair towards his opponents.

The most important event in his life was his pilgrimage to the Holy Land where he met the Master, 'Abdu'l-Bahá. He said to Vakil "you will be eternally confirmed." He was elected chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of India and Burma in 1923. He always set aside a portion of his income for the Cause. He helped to deepen the understanding of his fellow believers or giving the Message to others. He passed away on 2nd May 1943.
