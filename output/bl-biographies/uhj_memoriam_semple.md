Ian Chalmers Semple (December 2, 1928–December 1, 2011) was
a member of the Universal House of Justice, the supreme govern-
ing body of the Bahá’í Faith, from 1963 to 2005. Mr. Semple was
a popular speaker and delivered any number of well-researched and
elucidating talks on key topics related to fundamental Bahá’í tenets
at various Bahá’í gatherings. He was a sincere supporter of the `Irfán
Colloquium and a valuable contributor to the Lights of `Irfán. The
texts of some of his talks are published in Books Six, Nine, Ten and
Twelve, of the Lights of `Irfán. In addition the texts of the following

Mr. Semple was born in New Barnet, England, U. K. He did his
national service in the British Army, during which period he earned
a commission in the Royal Corps of Signals. Mr. Semple studied at
Pembroke College, Oxford University, obtaining a BA degree in Ger-
man and French Languages and Literature in 1952, and an MA degree
in 1955. He subsequently studied accounting in the City of London,
qualifying as a Chartered Accountant in 1955, becoming a Fellow of
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.

In 1950, the last year of the British Bahá’í community’s Six Year
Plan, Mr. Semple embraced Bahá’í Faith and joined British Bahá’í
community and served as an active member of a number of the
National Committees for the next several years. In 1956 he was elected
to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the British Isles
and served as its secretary. In 1957 he was appointed as a member of
the Auxiliary Board in Europe with particular responsibility for the
north of England, Scotland, Norway and Sweden. In 1961 he was
elected to the International Bahá’í Council, and moved his residence
to Haifa. In 1963 he was elected to the Universal House of Justice
and served in that capacity until 2005. After retirement, Ian moved
to Bulle, Switzerland, where many members of his family live. He
is survived by his wife Louise, whom he married in 1963, two sons,
Michael and Nick, and a daughter, Jenny.

The sad news of the sudden passing of Mr. Ian Semple was announced
by the Universal House of Justice to the Bahá’ís of the world in the
following message:

MESSAGE:

Our hearts are laden with sorrow at the passing to the Abhá King-
dom of our dearly loved former colleague Ian C. Semple, staunch,
clear-sighted, outstanding servant of the Blessed Beauty. Having
embraced the Cause of God in the prime of his youth while at uni-
versity, he devoted his considerable energies, eloquent pen and keen
intellect to its protection and to the promotion of its vital interests
throughout the rest of his life. A distinguished record of six decades
of uninterrupted labour in the Divine Vineyard included service as a
member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the British Isles, of the
Auxiliary Board for Propagation in Europe and of the International
Bahá’í Council, and culminated in forty-two years of membership of
the Universal House of Justice from its establishment in 1963 until

2005\. The shining qualities of his being, his immense courtesy,
surpassing humility, purity of heart, irrepressible joy and unfailing
optimism—all born of an unshakeable faith in the Word of God
and its capacity to redeem humankind—endeared him to everyone
who had the privilege of knowing him.

We extend our loving sympathy to his beloved wife, Louise, to his dear
children, Michael, Nicholas and Jennifer, and to his grandchildren for
the loss they have sustained and pray for the bounties of God to
surround them. May Ian’s valiant soul receive a joyous welcome in
the celestial realms above and be richly rewarded for his fealty and his
exemplary dedication to duty. We call upon the friends everywhere
to hold memorial gatherings in his honour, including befitting com-
memorative services in the Houses of Worship throughout the world.

The Universal House of Justice
