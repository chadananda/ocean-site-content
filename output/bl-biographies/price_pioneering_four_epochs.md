## Pioneering Over Four Epochs: An Autobiographical Study: Poetry and essays

### by [Ron Price](https://bahai-library.com/author/Ron+Price)

1944-2013


> This autobiographical study begins at the start of the three teaching Plans in: 1937, 1946 and 1953 respectively and integrates a lifespan, 1944 to 2013, a life-narrative, into the context of the history of the Bahai community back to 1753, the year of the birth of this Faith's chief precursor Shaykh Ahmad. The author includes over 2000 references from the humanities and social sciences within the western intellectual tradition. His account goes through to the early years of this new millennium, the first six decades from the inception of the Kingdom of God on earth, 1953-2013.  
>   
> This author's work is much more than a blow-by-blow account of these years. He draws on many disciplines, on studies of autobiography and biography as well as a broad range of experience, to analyse his society, his Faith, his community and himself in those critical first eight decades of organized and systematic teaching Plans, 1937 to 2013. Readers will find here at Bahai Library Online the introductory sections, Parts 1, 2 and 3 of this epic 2600 page five volume 7th edition. These three Parts are an abridged, truncated, and necessarily provisional edition for BLO. This section, this post, contains the 8 prefaces to Part 1 and, as the title suggests, the work is a study of autobiography as a genre, an analysis of its process and its content, as much as if not more than, a study of Price's life, his society and his set of values, beliefs and attitudes—in a word—his religion.  
>   
> The Office of Review of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States has given him permission to post his work in this form on the internet. The 3rd edition of this document was originally posted at BLO in 2003 and it has been edited and revised many times. This 7th edition was posted here in celebration of the 50th anniversary just 21 months from now, in April 2013, of the first election of the Universal House of Justice back in 1963. An 8th edition of this memoiristic work is envisaged to be published on the internet in 2021 at the end of the first century of the Formative Age if, as the author points out, he lasts that long.

DEDICATION  
  
This book is dedicated to the Universal House of Justice in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary in April 2013 of its first election in April 1963 and to Alfred J. Cornfield, my grandfather, whose autobiography was an inspiration to the one found here.  
  
Caveats:  
  
1\. The document below is Part 1 of what is a necessary abridgement of a narrative work of 2600 pages; it has been truncated here to fit into the space provided for this document at Bahai Library Online. This document is both an outline and a curtailment of an epic-opus, an abbreviated, a compressed, a boiled down, a potted, a shorn, a mown, a more compact version of my larger epic-work. This abridgement of the 7th edition of my autobiography will include changes in the months ahead. When a significant number of changes are made an 8th edition will be brought out. I anticipate this 8th edition will be placed here at BLO in 2021, the end of the first century of the Formative Age of the Bahai Era. It is my hope, although I cannot guarantee, that this brief exposure here will give readers a taste, a desire, for more.  
  
2\. The inclusion of quotation marks, apostrophes and accents has often proved difficult as have the addition of footnotes. Hopefully this will be remedied at a later date.
