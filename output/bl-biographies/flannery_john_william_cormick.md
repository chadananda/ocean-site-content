  Adventures in Biographical Research: John and

William Cormick by Vincent Flannery
Abstract
Dr William Cormick, as far as is known, was the only person from a
European background to have personally met with the Báb. This paper
attempts to bring together details of his life from various sources.

Setting Out
On the borders of County Kilkenny and Tipperary in south-east
Ireland, at the ancient Ahenny monastery, in the north and south
of the site, stand two ringed High Crosses, symbols of that great
age of the island’s history when Irishmen travelled far and wide.
The crosses are considered to be the first of their kind, dating to
the Ninth Century. Although uniquely Irish, their visual references
draw from other cultures: elaborately carved geometric strapwork
ornament thought to have originated in Coptic Ethiopia as well as
figurative ornament in scenes that include the Garden of Eden,
which recent convincing research suggests to have been located in
north-west Iran and specifically in Tabríz.1 A special feature of the
North Cross is its unusual large conical capstone.

A curious local tale tells of a third, West Cross, which is said
to have been transported eastwards. As the story goes, it never
reached its destination as the ship sank early on in its voyage from
Waterford harbour. It is said this happened some 200 years ago.
Perhaps to be dismissed as just a local story, it is interesting none
the less to note that in 1800, a local man named John Cormick (of
Cussane, Tullaghought, County Kilkenny, a few miles from
Ahenny) did indeed go East, specifically to Madras, India as a
surgeon to Sir John Malcolm’s expedition to Persia and then via
Bushire to Tabríz in 1810. We do not have a date for the birth of
John Cormick, but we do know that he studied medicine in
London. At that time it would not have been uncommon for a man
of twenty to have completed his education, as will be seen from
accounts of the life of his son, William.

It was my luck in June 2000 to come across a reference to
John Cormick in an index for The Old Kilkenny Review, published
by the Kilkenny Archaeological Society in 1996, by simply entering
a search on the Internet using the terms ‘Cormick, Tabríz;’ I was

luckier still to obtain the last copy for sale and excited to find
therein a photograph of William Cormick. In the

Review, the author’s name, Mr John Landy, and his Galway

> address were listed. Later, in some
> nervousness, I telephoned him,
> stating my interest and conscious of
> the value of any information he may
> or not wish to share. I need not have
> worried; the Australian accent on the
> phone communicated warmth and an
> immediate invitation to visit. I went
> to see him two hours later and was
> treated with informal and polite
> friendliness by his wife and himself.
> At the time I arrived we sat together
> to watch the end of a television
> programme about a refugee to
> Ireland, a black artist and her work.

With such interests, I knew then that
I was in the right place.

The home was filled with Mrs Landy’s charming paintings
and many books, and in a back room, used as a study where he
spends much of his retirement hours, Mr Landy kindly began to
share with me the fruits of his own research. Being a distant
relative of John and William Cormick, he explained that his great
grandfather (also John Landy) was a first cousin of William’s, and
that members of his own branch of the family had moved to
Australia, whence he himself had returned to retire in Ireland. The
Cormick family came originally from County Kilkenny, where
they held land and property at Cussane, Tullaghought in the
south-west of that county, near Ahenny and Carrick-on-Suir in
County Tipperary. (The Landy family name comes from the
Norman de la Launde.) Six Landy brothers had leases from the
Ormonde estate. Ten sisters and three brothers emigrated to
Australia in the 1800s. Mr Landy had heard from a Cormick
relative that there were members of the family who had been in
Persia. Although little attention was paid to this by others in the
family, his father’s aunt, Bessie Cormick, encouraged him. He

therefore decided to do some research and managed to trace
photographs of both William and his Armenian wife, Tamar, and
had corresponded extensively with authors of books and British
record offices. Authors included Anthony Parsons, Ann K. S.
Lambton, Moojan Momen and Denis Wright.

He encouraged me greatly and generously shared all of his
information, including his copy of William’s photograph, which I
consequently scanned and edited. He told me that the photograph
was ‘amongst the effects of a late cousin of William’s.’ The
photograph of Tamar, William’s wife, he told me had been
mislaid. With his directions and encouragement, I travelled to
Tullaghought and took photographs of what I saw.

The remains of the Cormick home-place are still to be seen
near Tullaghought. A visit there banished ideas of a grand
residence, expected perhaps with some knowledge of the
distinguished histories of some of the family. Accessed from the
road by a lane-way bordered by dry limestone walls, one
approaches a square pillared gateway, the entrance to a central
courtyard with long outbuildings arranged around. Enough does
remain, however, to imagine the place as it once was, with fine
country stonework and some ancient shrubbery. Specific
directions had been given by a neighbour who lived in a smaller,
but similarly structured holding. The original Cormick dwelling
house no longer stands, although its position is clearly seen by its
remains. Tall oaks stand in the surrounding hedged fields, perhaps
once witnesses to the lives of generations of this family with their
remarkable story. I left in another direction through stubble fields
and by a lane-way dotted with fallen crab apples in the sunset of
one atmospheric All Souls’ Eve. In timeless countryside and in the
absence of the signs and intrusions of the Twenty-First Century, it
wasn’t difficult to imagine what it might have been like for a
young man to be leaving his home, seemingly forever. Did
William wonder about where his steps might be leading him and
about the destiny awaiting him that would be talked and written
about two hundred years later and beyond?

John Cormick
At exactly what age John Cormick left Ireland we don’t at present
know. We do know, however, that he was to study in England and

qualify as a doctor at the Royal College of Surgeons in London in
1800\. That a young Irish Catholic from a farming background
should find himself so well-placed for a future career may appear
at first surprising, but it seems that, from my talks with Mr Landy,
the family was well established with their Protestant neighbours.
In the area there was notable co-operation and even adoption of
Irish culture by the English ascendancy, some perhaps Catholic
and well-established in the area since Norman times. Also, other
notable Irish families from the region had managed to maintain
their Catholicism, perhaps because they served in British
Government agencies and forces, including the Sheil and Ryan
families of Waterford and Tipperary.

And so John Cormick went, after qualifying in London, to
Madras, India, first as an Assistant Surgeon in 1800 and then as a
Surgeon in 1807 with a British expeditionary force. He left India on
10 January 1810 with the ship Psyche to Bushire, with Major
General John Malcolm on his second mission to Persia, and from
there to Tabríz, where he was subsequently employed by the East
India Company and attached to the army and household of the
Crown Prince ‘Abbás Mírzá,2 who was a relatively enlightened
member of the Shah’s family, progressive in his thinking. John was
married to an Armenian Christian woman in 1812. Henry Martyn,
a Protestant minister, officiated. The name earliest associated with
Protestant missions in Persia is that of Henry Martyn, who came
from India to Shíráz in 1811.3 Later the Russians objected to the
British influence and when British connections to the court were
severed in 1815, John remained in Tabríz. In 1820 a son, William,
was born.

John found increasing favour with the Crown Prince, who
encouraged Western medicine, and he was appointed his chief
physician. He held this position alongside John McNeill after 1821
and became wealthy. (McNeill was appointed British envoy to the
Shah in August 1836, and later Justin Sheil of Bellevue, Waterford
in 1842.) Although considered by some to be a British spy,
reporting regularly to the British representative at the Shah’s court
in Tehran, he nevertheless was dedicated as a doctor and
companion to ‘Abbás Mírzá, and to his profession. He had a
treatise on smallpox translated into Persian in one of the first
books printed in Persia.4 He was twice decorated with the Order of

the Lion and the Sun, necessitating permission from King George
IV of England, second class in August 1825 and first class in 1828.
Armenians living in the border areas of north-western Persia
suffered greatly, and due to concerned British intervention, a
treaty was arranged for their well-being. The Armenian
population in the region was placed under the care of John
Cormick in 1830. When Cormick accompanied ‘Abbás Mírzá to
Khurasan in 1833, he contracted typhus and died in Mayamey. His
body was buried in the Armenian cemetery in Tabríz, where there
are now eleven Cormick graves.

William Cormick
John’s son, William, was to follow in his father’s footsteps in a
number of ways. William was born in Tabríz in 1820, eight years
after his parents had married. We know he had at least one sibling,
a brother.5 At the age of ten he was ‘sent by his father to study
medicine’6 in England. We have no details of where he was
educated, the one reference to study medicine being highly
unlikely at that age. So, did he travel further to attend school in
Ireland? Were there relatives in London? At a later date, an
address is given for him in London at 217 Albany Street, Regents
Park. When he was 13, while so far away from his home, William’s
father died in Persia. One wonders how his mother would have
fared in Tabríz in the years after her husband’s death. British
responsibility for the protection of Armenians lapsed after 1833
after John’s death, and resumed only temporarily in 1838 when
there was again a rupture in English-Persian relationships, after
which the role that doctors could play ‘as a medium of confidential
intercourse between the Mission and the Shah’ was lost in favour
of the French. In this context, it is interesting to see that later the
Persians complained that Justin Sheil, also of County Kilkenny and
envoy to the Shah since 1842, had made the Mission ‘a sanctuary ...
a refuge for discontented persons.’

Wherever William had his secondary education, the next
record is of his having qualified at age 20 in July 1840 at University
College London (MRCS) 1841 (LSA) and later (MD) at St Andrew’s
(1841). He practised medicine in London and Paris and returned to
Persia in 1844 and was appointed second physician to the British
Mission in Tehran. One writer states that William was summoned

back by the Shah. In 1846, like his father before him, he was
‘seconded as physician to the family of ‘Abbás Mírzá, and later to
the crown prince Názer-al-Dín Mírzá. When Názer-al-Dín Mírzá
was appointed Governor of Azerbaijan, William accompanied him
to Tabríz as his personal physician on 15 March 1847. At this time,
to William, his future career must have seemed assured, being not
yet thirty years of age, well-placed with the British agencies,
doctor to the future Shah. He had also returned to his family and
place of birth. But changes were to come.

Dr William Cormick and the Báb
By the year 1848, momentous events were unfolding in Europe, in
Persia and in the very heart of human existence, the import of
which could not then have been outwardly perceived by William,
although he was better placed than most to be aware at least of the
surface appearance of events. Neither could he realise that he
would be chosen, invited even, to a series of encounters that would
assure the perpetuation of his name through future centuries.
Hints there were, some of which he must have been aware of. On 1
and 19 November 1845, The Times of London published the first-
known printed references to a new religious movement in Persia,
concerning the arrest and torture of four of its followers, including
one Quddús, which had taken place in Shíráz the previous June.

At the very time William was moving from Tehran to Tabríz,
in March 1847, a Prisoner, the Founder of this new movement was,
under the Shah’s instructions, being escorted from Shíráz to meet
him in Tehran. The Prisoner, the Báb, had so convinced His captor,
Manuchír Khan, Governor-General of Isfáhán, of the truth of His
mission being the fulfilment of prophecies of Islám, that the
governor was moved to offer to Him all of his vast possessions in
order to also convince the Shah. The Báb had declined this offer.
Fearful of the effect the Báb would have on the Shah, the Prime
Minister diverted the route of the Prisoner towards the prison-
fortress of Máh-Kú, skirting Tehran and on towards Tabríz, where
He arrived in May or June, just weeks after Cormick’s own return
there. What news might have spread throughout Tabríz about this
Prisoner, whose guards and their chief had become so enthralled
by Him that they implored His blessings and begged His
forgiveness and pardon, as they handed Him over to the officials

of Názer-al-Dín Mírzá, to be imprisoned for 40 days in the citadel
of Tabríz, called the Ark?

> A tumultuous concourse of people had gathered to witness
> His entry into the city ... desirous of ascertaining the veracity
> of the wild reports that were current about Him ... the
> acclamations of the multitude resounded on every side ...
> Such was the clamour that a crier was ordered to warn the
> population of the danger that awaited those who ventured to
> seek His presence.7

How could Dr Cormick not have heard this and been aware of the
Báb’s presence nearby, even if restrictions were such that only two
people were subsequently allowed to visit Him?

Indeed, change was in the air, and not just in Persia.

Throughout Europe, revolution after revolution was shaking
established governments to the extent that the following year,
1848, became known as ‘the Year of Revolutions.’ In Ireland, since
1845, famine was ravaging the land through death and emigration.
Although on the periphery of Europe, the zeitgeist could not be
resisted even there. Only a few miles from William’s father’s
birthplace, in Carrick-on-Suir, County Waterford in the last week
of July 1848, crowds were gathering:

... a torrent of human beings, rushing through lanes and
> narrow streets, whirling in dizzy circles and tossing up its
> dark waves ... wild half-stifled, passionate, frantic, prayers of
> hope, ... scornful exulting defiance of death. It was the
> revolution, if we had accepted it.8

This same week in Tabríz, crowds, too, were gathering again – one
year since the Báb had been taken to be imprisoned in a more
remote outpost:

> The tales of the signs and wonders which the Báb’s
> unnumbered admirers had witnessed were soon transmitted
> from mouth to mouth, and gave rise to a wave of
> unprecedented enthusiasm which spread with bewildering
rapidity over the entire country.9

Tabríz, in particular, was in the throes of this ‘wildcat excitement’:

> The news of the impending arrival of the Báb had inflamed
> the imagination of its inhabitants and had kindled the
> fiercest animosity in the hearts of the ecclesiastical leaders of
> Adhirbayjan ... Such was the fervour of popular enthusiasm
> which that news had evoked that the authorities decided to
> house the Báb in a place outside the gates of the city. Only
> those whom He desired to meet were allowed the privilege
> of approaching Him ... 10

The Báb had returned to Tabríz. A tribunal was gathered for
a trial, of which the Báb took control, embarrassed the clergy, and
made a formal declaration of His mission. Presiding was the
young Crown Prince and alongside him, his tutor. In the course of
the trial, seemingly, reluctance on the part of a number of the
participants to endorse a death sentence caused Dr Cormick and
two Persian physicians to be called to carry out an examination on
the Prisoner to certify as to His state of mind. Years later, Dr
Cormick’s memories of the event were to be gathered and
compiled.11

> You ask me for some particulars of my interview with the
> founder of the sect known as Bábís. Nothing of any
> importance transpired in this interview, as the Báb was
> aware of my having been sent with two other Persian doctors
> to see whether he was of sane mind or merely a madman, to
> decide the question whether to put him to death or not. With
> this knowledge he was loth to answer any questions put to
> him. To all enquiries he merely regarded us with a mild look,
> chanting in a low melodious voice some hymns, I suppose.
> Two other Sayyids, his intimate friends, were also present,

> couple of government officials. He only once deigned to
> answer me, on my saying that I was not a Musulmán

that he had no doubt of all Europeans coming over to his

order of the Amír-i-Nizám Mírzá Taqí Khán.

On our report he merely got the bastinado, in which

He was very thankful for my attentions to him. He was a

> and very fair for a Persian, with a melodious soft voice,
> which struck me much. Being a Sayyid, he was dressed in the

It is very interesting to study carefully this unique record, for
it goes some way in revealing the effect that this meeting had on
Dr Cormick, and something of his own character. For example, it
opens with the words, ‘nothing of importance transpired,’ yet we
also have strong expressions such as ‘with a melodious soft voice,
which struck me much’ and ‘In fact his whole look and
deportment went far to dispose one in his favour.’ Did Cormick
really believe the Báb was not sane? Despite his report (note ‘at
that time’), there is nothing to be seen here that would have us

accept that the doctor really believed this. Unless there was a prior
arrangement to have this result, then we could conclude that the
doctors themselves wished to save the Báb. Other aspects are also
interesting, especially the fact that the Báb requested that William
should attend Him, which he did, and on a number of occasions.
We have seen above ‘Only those whom he desired to meet were
allowed the privilege of approaching Him.’ What are we to make
of this? The Báb was far beyond requiring favours of anyone, as is
obvious from declined offers to escape or save his own life. We see
also Dr Cormick’s desire to have a confidential conversation with
the Báb, this after the need for a psychological assessment had
passed. The attention to religious aspects in the record is also
interesting and it appears, if we regard his opening question about
considering adopting the new faith as a means to have the Báb
respond at that stage, William was keen to find out more and was
apparently impressed by what he heard. He gives us some details:
lack of fanaticism (a very interesting judgement, considering the
official report), toleration of other religions, and the freedom of
women. In this respect, perhaps, news was current in Tabríz that
just a few weeks earlier, sometime in the first two weeks of July,
the leading female follower of the new faith, the beautiful poet,
Táhirih, had removed her veil, dramatically announcing the birth
of a new Divine cycle, the break with Islam and also symbolically
declared the emancipation of women. (It is interesting to note that
thousands of miles away, on 20 July in North America at Seneca
Falls, a formal declaration of the rights of women was also
heard.12) The information that the Báb was wounded in the face, as
well as being bastinadoed, does not seem to be recorded
elsewhere. It should be noted that some of the information is not
first-hand, some of it being reported by ‘Armenian carpenters.’

Was William present as the Báb revealed His sacred
Scripture? His account is that he heard the Báb chanting. In Lady
Sheil’s later brief account of the Báb, attributed as information to
her from Dr Cormick, he also witnessed how the Báb ‘wrote
rapidly and well.’ Only one other Westerner, Mochenin, a Russian
student, is recorded as having been present to observe, from a
distance, as the Báb taught His doctrine to a huge crowd who
listened to ‘the new Qur’án’ at Chihríq.13

William’s life was to take a different course than what he
may have expected, and at the hands of one who was to be
instrumental in making fateful decisions regarding the life of the
Báb. Just two months after Dr Cormick’s meeting with the Báb, in
September 1848, Muhammad Shah died. On his death and the 17-
year-old Crown Prince’s accession to the throne, William went
with him to Tehran. Mírzá Taqi Khan, the Prime Minister, opposed
this, not wanting to be dependent on either Britain or Russia, and
so Dr Cormick was replaced by a French physician, Dr Cloquet.
William returned to Tabríz, his life in public service seemingly
ended. At 28 years of age, he opened an apothecary shop,
practised medicine, and was later to serve as a physician to the late
‘Abbás Mírzá’s family and become wealthy. Two years later, in
May 1850, Tabríz was yet again in upheaval:

> That day witnessed a tremendous commotion in the city of
> Tabríz. The great convulsion associated in the ideas of its
> inhabitants with the day of judgement seemed at last to have
> come upon them. Never had that city experienced a turmoil
> so fierce on the day the Báb was led to that place which was
> to be the scene of His martyrdom.14

Mírzá Taqih Khan, the Prime Minister, was shaken by events
that had involved the astoundingly successful self-defence of a few
of his Prisoner’s followers against the might of his armed forces.
Alarmed at the rapidly increasing emergence of more and more
adherents to the new faith all over Persia, despite strong advice to
the contrary, he demanded the immediate execution of the Báb.
Forty of the Christian Armenian soldiers of Tabríz were appointed
to guard Him. The subsequent execution of the Báb was
accompanied by such disturbing events as to affect even the
physical atmosphere of that city. An Armenian regiment under
Sam Khan, assigned to carry out the deed, dramatically, and
despite risk to their own lives, had refused to proceed. One
wonders on the reports coming to William, and their effect on him,
considering his personal encounter with the Báb, just a short time
previously. How much might he have actually witnessed?

There were a number of Irish people in Tabríz at some stage
in these momentous years: Sir Justin Sheil of Waterford, his wife

Lady Mary (née Woulfe) and their three children, who had with
them three Irish servants (recorded as having worshipped at an
Armenian service), a young man, Art McMurrough Kavanagh, of
Borris House, Carlow, who later became an MP, with his older
brother, Charles, and their tutor, Rev. David Wood. Of these
eleven people, there is no clear record of their having actually met
William, but it would be surprising had they not.

Not long afterwards, Burgess reports, in 1851, that William is
married to Tamar, an Armenian, ‘one of the most beautiful girls in
the country,’ in fact, a sister of Edward Burgess’s own wife, Anna.
He has an income of £1,000 per annum and is thinking of going to
London for the Great Exhibition in 1853. He says that William
wants to pursue medical study – ‘his passion’ – for one or two
years in London, even though this would reduce his income to
£200 per annum. Burgess, of a famous British merchant family,
had long lived in Tabríz, but had become virtually trapped in
Persia, deciding to honour his older brother Charles’s debts to the
government rather than leave. Having finally obtained permission
to visit England in 1855, he sadly died en route. He was survived
by his wife and daughter, Fanny, who at least once visited
England, staying with Edward’s father in London. With such close
family ties with William, their history is worth considering.

In August 1857 there were unsuccessful attempts by the
deputy-governor to dispossess William of his property in Tabríz.
This does not seem particularly aimed against him, but was
consistent with levels of injustice that prevailed at the time. In the
summer of 1861, he was in Salma in the company of a friend. Just
past forty, he was very near Chihríq where the Báb had, only a few
years previously, been imprisoned. Concerning the nature of
creative inspiration, the Báb had looked towards Salma from His
mountain-prison in Máh-Kú and had quoted Hafiz:

> He gazed towards the west and, as He saw the Araxes
> winding its course far away below Him, turned to Mullá
> Husayn and said: ‘That is the river, and this is the bank
> thereof, of which the poet Hafiz has thus written: ‘O zephyr,
> shouldst thou pass by the banks of the Araxes, implant a kiss
> on the earth of that valley and make fragrant thy breath.

Hail, a thousand times hail, to thee, O abode of Salma! How

dear is the voice of thy camel-drivers, how sweet the jingling
> of thy bells!’ Continuing His remarks, the Báb said: ‘It is the
> immediate influence of the Holy Spirit that causes words
> such as these to stream from the tongue of poets, the
> significance of which they themselves are oftentimes unable
> to apprehend.’ The Báb subsequently quoted this well-
> known tradition: ‘Treasures lie hidden beneath the throne of
> God; the key to those treasures is the tongue of poets.’15

Now in his private life, William was not to forget his
interview with the Báb. W.A. Shedd, from a family of American
missionaries, writing to The Moslem World in August 1914, says:

> I found the following memorandum among the papers of my
> father, the Rev. J. H. Shedd D.D. The record was made
> sometime between 1860 and l870, perhaps in 186l, when Dr
> Cormick spent the summer or part of it in Salma, where my
> father was then stationed, and, they saw a good deal of each
> other. Dr Cormick was an English physician, who for a
> number of years lived in Tabríz, having there a large medical
> practice and being much esteemed. The events referred to
> took place in Tabríz some time before the execution of the
> Báb in July, 1850, probably at the time of his first
> examination in Tabríz. Probably no other European had an
> interview with the Báb and certainly no other record of such
> an interview is extant.16

This account of the origin of Dr Cormick’s descriptions of the
event is a little confusing. On 1 March 1911, Dr Shedd had
previously written to Edward Granville Browne. Heading the
interview account, Prof. Browne writes that they are ‘Dr Cormick’s
accounts of his personal impressions of Mírzá ‘Alí-Muhammad the
Báb, extracted from letters written by him to the Rev. Benjamin
Labaree, dd.’ So, did Dr Cormick give the account directly to John
Shedd or to him through Rev. Labaree? Whatever the case,
compassion in this circle towards the Báb is revealed by W. Shedd
writing about the ‘period of his imprisonment and suffering.’17
Esteem for Dr Cormick is shown too by the description of ‘a
cultivated and impartial Western mind.’18

In October 1875, like his father, William receives the Order of
the Lion and the Sun. On 19 October 1876 he becomes a fellow of
the Royal College of Surgeons, and continues to promote Western
medicine. His photograph must have been taken around this time;
it shows two decorations, but we have records of only one.19

On 30 December 1877, almost 57 years of age, William
Cormick died. He was the last to be buried in the Armenian
Cemetery in Tabríz, where there are eleven other Cormick graves,
including those of his father and brother. Of his children, there is
but one account: of a son who was in Iran until the last decades of
the Nineteenth Century and who returned to England.20

At present there are no available records of contact between
any English members of the family and the Australian and Irish
relatives for these later years. Mr Landy provides an invaluable
link in this most interesting history. Once on a visit to his home, I
brought the postage stamp and the Haifa Municipality brochure of
the gardens surrounding the Shrine of the Báb on Mount Carmel.
Mr Landy appeared pleasantly surprised as he examined them and
my impression was that he realised then more clearly the
importance of his family’s history.

the ruins of the Iranian army on the Russian front. Suffering the
disgrace of his country, he saw in retreating soldiers and captured
armaments Qajar Iran’s backwardness and impotence. When he
returned from war, he began to agitate within the court for reform
of the monarchy and the nation. Tragically dying before his father,
‘Abbás Mírzá left his vision to the few enlightened minds within
the palace.

3\. Martyn was in Shíráz only about ten months but toiling amid
heat and dust in weakness of body and with many enemies about
him, he completed his Persian translation of the Psalms, begun in
India. A few months later he died alone at Tokat in Turkey on his
way home.

4. Fath ‘Alí Shah’s Crown Prince and Governor of Tabríz, ’Abbás
Mírzá, is a quintessential example of this trend towards the
espousal of European preventive health practices. Having been
cured of a venereal complaint, the Prince embraced the
recommendations of his English physician, Dr James Campbell,
and agreed to have his family vaccinated against smallpox.
Furthermore, he requested the permanent appointment of a British
physician to his service and undertook the sponsorship of Mírzá
Bába Afshar’s medical studies in London and Oxford in 1818.

It was ’Abbás Mírzá’s recognition of the significant life-
saving value of the smallpox vaccination, together with his quest
to preserve the health of his Nizam i Jadid [new army], that led to
the first steps in spreading the knowledge of the Jennerian method
of vaccination among Iranian physicians.

Accordingly, Dr John Cormick, who had succeeded Dr Jukes
as ’Abbás Mírzá’s personal physician, composed a treatise on
vaccination at the Crown Prince’s request so as to promote this
practice. The tract, entitled Risalah i abi-lah-kubi, was translated by
Mohammad `Ibn-i `Abd al-Sabur, and when published in 1829 was
among the first works to be printed in the newly established
printing press in Tabríz.

> The last two documents, which are in English, were kindly
> communicated to me by Mr W.A. Shedd, who wrote
concerning them as follows in a letter dated March 1, 1911:

> Dear Professor Browne,
> In going over papers of my father, I found something
> which I think may be of value from a historical point of
> view. I have no books here, nor are any accessible here, to
> be certain whether this bit of testimony (or rather these
> two bits) have been used or not. I think probably not, and
> I am sure that I can do nothing better than send them to
> you, with the wish that you may use them as you think
> best. Of the authenticity of the papers there can be no
> doubt.
> Yours very truly,
> W. A. Shedd.

> The first of these two documents is very valuable as giving
> the personal impression produced by the Báb, during the
> period of His imprisonment and suffering, on a cultivated
> and impartial Western mind. Very few Western Christians
> can have had the opportunity of seeing, still less of
> conversing with, the Báb, and I do not know of any other
> who has recorded his impressions.

19\. Of course, this might raise doubts as to whether the
photograph may have been of John. Photography would not have

been available in 1833, the first photograph in Iran is from 1842.

Perhaps he wore one decoration which had belonged to his father.
Also, Mr Landy assures me it is of William. On photography in
