> Rogers, Otto Donald, painter, sculptor (b at Kerrobert, Saskatchewan 19 Nov 1935). One of Canada's foremost contemporary practitioners of colour- field painting and assembled steel sculpture, Rogers was encouraged to pursue an artistic career by Wynona Mulcaster while attending Saskatoon Teachers' Coll (1952-53). He attended U of Wisconsin (1953- 59). He taught at U of Sask from 1959 to 1988, serving as chairman of the art department 1973-77.

> In 1960 Rogers adopted the BAHA'I FAITH. Since then he has lectured and written extensively on this religion, emphasizing its importance to his art. In 1988 Rogers moved to Haifa, Israel, to continue a strong leadership role in the Bahá'í faith. While recognizing the spiritual element in his art, some critics claim that the prairie environment has been equally important in his work.
