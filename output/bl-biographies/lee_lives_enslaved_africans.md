Africans were enslaved and brought to Iran in large numbers in the nineteenth century as part of
the Eastern slave trade. While there are no definite historical statistics on the number of slaves
exported from Africa to Iran, estimates among scholars for the Indian Ocean trade during the
nineteenth century vary between one and two million. Possibly two-thirds of these slaves were
women and girls. 1 In Iran, these Africans were almost always destined for residence in Iranian
households as servants, eunuchs, and concubines.

Little scholarship has been undertaken on the history of Africans in Iran. 2 There are
enormous gaps in our knowledge of slavery in Iran and of the influence of African people and

study of the history of Africans in the northwestern Indian Ocean.3 However, his pioneering call
for more research, for the most part, has not been taken up by other scholars. This paper is an
attempt to recover the individual lives of slaves in nineteenth-century Iran and to reconstruct at
least a part of their stories.

The Limited Value of Western Concepts

Scholars of Middle Eastern slavery have warned about the limited value of Western concepts and
legal distinctions between slavery and freedom when applied to the study of slaves in the Muslim
world.4 Such binary, legal concepts of slave vs. free presuppose a secular state that is able to
protect the lives and property of individuals who can claim its protection. Western notions are
based fundamentally on the notion of a free individual, conceived as male (unconsciously
perhaps, but the rights of women were limited), who enjoys personal autonomy, freedom of
movement, choice of employment, marriage, and association, whose safety and whose legal
rights are guaranteed by the state by virtue his citizenship. It is the guarantee of security of one’s
Niambi Cacchioli has also done work in this area: see, “Disputed Freedom: Fugitive Slaves, Asylum, and
Manumission in Iran (1851-1913),” UNESCO website (http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/files/
38508/12480962345Disputed_Freedom.pdf/Disputed%2BFreedom.pdf). Other useful discussions of slavery in Islam,
with brief references to Iran, include Joseph E. Harris, The African Presence in Asia: Consequences of the East
African Slave Trade (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1971) and Bernard Lewis, Race and Slavery in the
Middle East: An Historical Enquiry (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990). Also, Nahid Mozaffari, ed., Slavery
in Iran (forthcoming). Lee, The Baha’i Faith in Africa, also discusses slavery in Iran. See Chapter 2.

New Directions in Research,” Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East (formerly South Asia
Bulletin), Vol. 17 (1997) no. 2, pp. 62-81. Even Alpers’s article—while calling on evidence from Arabia and
India—was unable to discuss Iran as the site of African cultural influence, so little research had been done on the
subject at that time.

\[4\] Similar cautions are made for the study of slavery in Africa and Asia. See, Joseph C. Miller, “Introduction,” in
Women and Slavery, pp. 25-???; Gwyn Campbell, “Introduction: Slavery and Other Forms of Unfree Labour In the
Indian Ocean World,” in Structure of Slavery, pp. viii-xviii; Suzanne Miers, “Slavery: A Question of Definition,” in
Structure of Slavery, pp. 1-14.

person and property made by the modern state which, at least theoretically, releases a free person
from dependence on, or obedience to, powerful others and allows for free choices within the law.
Slaves, on the other hand, were excluded from such guarantees in modern Western societies and
were held as chattel property for life by their owners. They held no rights that the state needed to
respect (save perhaps the right to life itself) and lived in a relationship of total dependence on
their masters, the only relationship of theirs that the law would recognize. A slave then must
survive without the protection of law, family, or the state, reliant on and obedient to his master.

Such concepts of slave and free are of limited value when discussing societies that are not
constructed around the idea of rights, citizenship, or of a secular state, but rather built on
concepts or kinship, belonging, religious authority, and hierarchies of dependence. For Muslim
societies in the nineteenth century, personal security and identity could only be protected by ties
of kinship, household, community, or the protection of a powerful and wealthy patron. There
was no ideal of freedom for anyone from such relationships, with their implications of
dependence, obedience, and obligation, and any such freedom would have left an individual
isolated and vulnerable. This is particularly true of women who, whether slave or free, were
never regarded as autonomous agents, but always attached to a male patron (father, husband,
brother, master).5

This paper will attempt to illustrate some of the difficulties with the slave/free dichotomy
that is usually assumed. All enslaved persons in Iran, and for the most part all other persons,
necessarily were embedded in Muslim households and moved along a continuum of whatever

\[5\] For some slaves, even in twentieth-century Iran, liberation was seen as a form of punishment. For example, Fasah
Khanum, the slave wife of the late Haji ‘Ali Khan, complained that she and her 12-year-old child had been unjustly
expelled from her master’s house in 1905. (Behnaz A. Mirzai, “Emancipation and Its Legacy in Iran: An Overview,”
UNESCO Culture, The Slave Route, http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CLT/dialogue/pdf/
Emancipation%20Legacy%20Iran.pdf)

situation of power, respect, wealth, and independence they might be able to negotiate within
those households. All women tended to occupy positions outside of the public sphere and at the
margins of wealth and power, slave women most especially. They moved toward the center of
their households as they became mothers, bore the master’s children, and found acceptance
within families. In this sense, the distinction between slave and “free” was more permeable for a
female slave than for a male slave, since she might hope to be accepted as a valuable worker
within a household, become her master’s concubine, give birth to some of his heirs, and in
unusual cases become the wife of a powerful and wealthy patriarch. The most important
consideration for slave women may not have been their legal status as slaves, since no sharp
distinction in law or practice existed. Rather, their aim would have been to negotiate the most
respected position that they could achieve within the family that they found themselves attached
to. In fact, that would have been the goal of any woman, slave or free, in nineteenth-century
Iran.

Four Cases of Iranian Slavery

This paper will examine four cases of slave experience in Iran in an effort to demonstrate the
widely varying conditions of enslaved persons during the nineteenth century. First, Bahrazian
Khanum and Nur Sabbah Khanum, two sisters who found their freedom in 1892, but who in the
absence of protectors were quickly re-enslaved. Second, Haji Mubarak and Fezzeh Khanum,
servants of the middle-class merchant, Mirza ‘Ali-Muhammad of Shiraz, known as the Bab
(1819-1850), the founder of the Babi religion. The former an educated eunuch, who raised his
future master from the age of seven, and was entrusted with his master’s business affairs; the

latter a lifelong companion to the Prophet’s wife who became a holy figure in her own right.

Third, Khyzran Khanum and a young boy named Walladee, two slaves who fled to the British
agent in Lingeh in 1856, seeking freedom. And, fourth, Gulchihreh Khanum, captured and
enslaved as a child. She became a servant in a wealthy Iranian home and the beloved nanny of
the family’s children, but continued to protest her enslavement to the end of her life.

Case Number One: Sisters at Zubair

The lives of two Ethiopian sisters, Bahrazain Khanum and Nur Sabbah Khanum, illustrate the
dangers of “freedom” and the vulnerability of isolated individuals in the absence of a protector.
Recounted by the former when she fled for refuge to the British consulate in Bushihr in 1892,
their story is this:

> A person named Haji Ibrahim kidnapped me and took me along with pilgrims to Abu
> Rashid. There he sold me and my sister, Nur Sabbah, to Haji Abdullah, who died there.
> Both my sister and I then hired a camel and went to Zubair, where two persons called
> Rahim and Yusif appeared: the latter took my sister as his wife and deceived me and
> brought me to Bushire. They sold me . . . to Abdul Nabi through Aqa Reza Dallal. I
> work in the house of Abdul Nabi but am not properly looked after. I am beaten and get
> no clothes. I was originally free but have now been bought.6

Here we have rare access to the African voice in this testimony, mediated through the British
official and translated into English, of course. The interview is a bit stilted, was recorded for
legal purposes, and legal concerns are paramount. But the story of the sisters comes through.

\[6\] Quoted in Vanessa Martin, The Qajar Pact, p. 155. (Talbot to Lascelles, in No. 34, 13.2.1892, FO 248/543.)
Especially, the last sentence has the ring of authenticity: Bahrazain Khanum protests: “I was
originally free but have now been bought.”

Here we see the limitations of freedom in traditional Iranian society. After the
unexpected death of their master, Haji Abdollah, the two sisters were effectively “free,” in
Western terms. They clearly had access to their late master’s wealth and could hire
transportation to Zubair on their own initiative. But once there, they had no means of protecting
their wealth or freedom, and were even unable to maintain their family bond. There were no
state authorities to turn to. Nur Sabbah was “married” to Yosef with or without her consent.
Bahrazain was carried off to Bushihr and sold into slavery again. Finally, the only protector she
could turn to was the British consul.

Case Number Two: Slaves of the Prophet

Haji Mubarak and Fezzeh Khanum were the servants of Sayyid ‘Ali-Muhammad of Shiraz,
known as the Bab, the founder and prophet of the Babi movement in Iran.7 These two household
slaves offer a rare opportunity to not just glimpse enslaved Africans in Iran at a particular
moment in their lives, as with the sisters of Zubair, but to reconstruct fairly complete biographies
and to follow them over a number of years.

\[7\] This movement later developed into the Baha’i religion. There is a considerable literature on the Babi movement.

The best recent academic treatments are to be found in Abbas Amanat, Resurrection and Renewal: The Making of
the Babi Movement in Iran, 1844-1850 (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1989. Paperback Edition: Los
Angeles: Kalimat Press, 2005) and in Denis MacEoin, The Messiah of Shiraz (Leiden: Brill, 2009). The classic
Baha’i chronicle of the period is Nabíl-i A‘zam’s hagiographic The Dawn-Breakers: Nabíl’s Narrative of the Early
Days of the Bahá’i Revelation, trans. and ed. by Shoghi Effendi (Wilmette, Ill.: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1932). See
also, H. M. Balyuzi, The Báb: The Herald of the Day of Days (Oxford: George Ronald, 1973) and Peter Smith’s
sociological study, The Babi and Baha’i Religions: From messianic Shi’ism to a world religion (Cambridge
University Press, 1987). The early volumes of the Studies in the Bábí and Bahá’í Religions series (Los Angeles:
Kalimat Press, 1982- ), Anthony A. Lee, General Editor, are also useful.

HajiMubarak was purchased by the Bab in 1842, at the time of his marriage and two
years before the beginning of his religious mission, from HajiMírzá Abu’l-Qasim, a brother of
the Bab’s wife, Khadijeh Bagum (who was his cousin).8 Mubarak had been transported from
East Africa as a young child, bought from slave traders when he was five years old, and trained
for business and domestic service in the household of the Bab’s future brother-in-law. Of
course, he was raised as a Muslim. His education is said to have been “exemplary.” All sources
are silent on this issue, but because of the nature of Mubarak’s service in the household of the
Bab, and later in Karbala, as the attendant of the women of the household, it is likely that he was
a eunuch. He was literate and skilled at commerce. The Bab had known Mubarak since
childhood. After 1842, as he withdrew from business activities to pursue his religious mission,
the Bab assigned Mubarak (now newly owned) the task of settling his outstanding accounts and
winding up his business affairs in Shiraz.9 This suggests that Mubarak was literate in the
language and mathematics of traditional accounting (síyáq) and was entrusted with his master’s
confidential affairs.

Mubarak’s relationship with the Bab was extremely close. After the declaration of his
prophethood in 1844, and as he began to attract a following among all segments of Iranian
society, the Bab wrote almost continuously, producing volumes of treatises, prayers, and
commentaries that were to become the sacred scriptures of his new religion. In these writings,
the Bab mentions Mubarak in a number of places and praises him highly.10 The Bab’s father
died when he was one year old, and he was raised by his material uncle (within the extended

this book, unless otherwise noted.

\[9\] Ibid., p. 6.

\[10\] The information about the mention of Mubarak in the writings of the Bab is taken from Nader Saiedi, “Sultan-i
Habashi” in Payam-i Baha’i (France), May 2010, pp. 10-13, unless otherwise noted. Dr. Saiedi has been able to
read the entire corpus of the Bab’s writings housed in the International Baha’i Archives, Haifa, Israel.

family of his future wife).11 Yet he often prays for both his father and his mother in his
devotions. It is seldom that the Bab refers to his parents in these writings, asking for Divine
blessings, that he does not also mention Mubarak at the same time.12

In 1850 (1265 A.H.), shortly before his execution as a heretic, and while imprisoned in
Azerbaijan, the Bab wrote The Book of Thirty Prayers (Kitáb-i sí du’á) in celebration of his
approaching thirtieth birthday. The book takes the form of thirty long supplications addressed to
God, one for each of his years. But in the process, the prophet also reveals his own biography,
recounting the events of his life. In the seventh prayer of the book, the Bab writes: “O God!
You sent me when I was seven, someone who came to raise me, and his name was Mubarak.
God send blessings upon him.” In another place in the book, the Bab asks for God’s favor on his
father and his mother and on “the person who brought me up and taught me good character
(tarbiyat kard), and raised me,” again referring to Mubarak.13

So we learn that one of the duties that Mubarak had within the Bab’s uncle’s household
was to look after the young ‘Ali-Muhammad and train him in good manners. Clearly, Mubarak
became a father figure to the boy, and he includes him as a substitute father in his prayers and
writings. Beyond that, in the same book we find this passage: “O God! Because in those days
Mubarak made bows and arrows for me [to play with], send down upon him your mercies and
your bounties.”14 This is a touching tribute to the filial semtiments that the Bab had for his
African care-giver.15 During the period of his exile and imprisonment in the north of Iran (1846-

children normally played with bows and arrows as toys.

1850), in letters written to his mother, his wife, and his uncles, the Bab often mentions Mubarak,
and always praises him.

Some decades later, Taj al-Sultaneh (1884-1936), one of the daughters of Nasiru’l-Din Shah,
developed a similar emotional attachment to her African nanny. So much so that, in her
autobiography, she substitutes tender memories of that slave for memories of childhood with her
mother.16 The Bab seems to have done something similar with his memories of Mubarak,
substituting memories of a childhood with him for memories of his deceased father. We might
expect that other slaves who served as nannies and care-givers for Iranian children developed the
same sorts of parental relationships.

So, when the Bab purchased Mubarak from his wife’s family for the absurdly low price
of 14 tumans (about $28.00), the two were already intimately known to one another. No doubt,
Mubarak was more of a wedding present from the brother-in-law than anything else. Mubarak         17

served his new master and his family as a household servant, bookkeeper, and confidant. As
such he was associated with the events at the genesis of the Babi movement and participated in
those events fully. Still, he remained subordinate and invisible as a slave.

Between May 1844 and September 1846, when his master was finally arrested for his
religious heresies and was forced to leave Shiraz for the last time, Mubarak met and served all of
the first disciples of the movement; he carried secret verbal messages and written
correspondence between his master and these disciples. Mubarak was the Bab’s companion and

attendant (along with one other disciple) on the pilgrimage in 1844-1845, to Mecca, where the
new prophet publicly announced his claim to be the Qa’im (the Shi’ite messiah). There,
Mubarak performed all the rites of pilgrimage and became a haji.18

Mubarak was witness to the Bab’s nearly continuous dictation of sermons and religious
treatises during the pilgrimage; he was shocked when most of these writings were stolen and was
willing to defend them at the risk of his life. He was present when his master was arrested in
June 1845, and placed under house arrest in Shiraz. During the period of that confinement, he
served his master and was in charge of surreptitiously (and in defiance of government orders)
bringing followers to meet with him through a secret passage to the house. When the Bab finally
left for hiding in Isfahan, neither Mubarak nor the Prophet’s family ever saw him again.
Mubarak was entrusted with the care of the Bab’s wife and mother, both of whom remained at
home in Shiraz.19

After the Bab’s execution in 1850, his mother and grandmother eventually felt compelled
to move their residence from Shiraz to Karbala, in Iraq, to escape from the contempt and hostility
of their Muslim relatives. Mubarak accompanied them to their new home and died there, in

their service.21 To salvage their respectability after 1850, members of the Bab’s family
maintained in public that the Bab had not been executed, but rather was living in India,
administering the family’s trading affairs in that country. While serving the family in Karbala,
Mubarak helped to preserve this polite fiction by vowing to sweep the courtyard around the tomb

\[18\] It seems clear that he was never known by this title, however. Perhaps Mubarak’s status as a slave precluded the
use of such honorifics. In all of the sources, Mubarak is referred to only by his given name. More often, he is
referred to only as the Bab’s “Ethiopian servant” (gulam-i habashi). I have referred to him as Haji Mubarak in all of
my publications.

of the Imām Husayn in Karbala every day until his master’s “return.” He performed this pious
duty every morning until his death c. 1863.22

At the time of his marriage, the Bab also acquired a servant for his wife. Fezzeh
Khanum,23 an “Ethiopian” child was probably no more than seven years old at the time. I have
discussed the life of this African slave at length elsewhere.24 Suffice it to say here that Fezzeh
Khanum lived as the lifelong companion of the Bab’s wife. She shared in the dangers, the
isolation, and the difficulties of the family of the heretic prophet. Eventually, she became a holy
figure herself and an object of veneration for Babis, and later Baha’is.

I should note here that, at the time of his marriage, the Bab’s new household consisted of
himself, his wife, his mother, and two slaves: Haji Mubarak and Fezzeh Khanum. Two out of
five members of the new household were Africans. After the Bab’s arrest and departure from the
city, half of the household was African. Khadijeh Bagum’s close relationship with Fezzeh
Khanum represents the pairing of an African woman with her Iranian mistress over a period of
decades.

Sometime after her husband’s execution, Khadijeh Bagum’s home and person became a
center of pilgrimage for the persecuted Babis (and later Baha’is) of Iran. Streams of visitors

came to seek out her presence and regarded her as a holy person in her own right by virtue of her
direct relationship to the Prophet. In a Tablet (an open letter) to Khadijeh Bagum, Baha’u’llah
(the Baha’i prophet, who replaced the Bab as head of the movement) addresses her, saying: “It

publications.

behoveth everyone to venerate thee, glorify thee and through thee pay heed to the truth of God
and His Cause.” 26

Some of her pilgrim visitors, at least, remained in her home as house guests for extended
periods.27 Khadijeh Bagum would receive these visitors, act as guide to the holy house, and
recount her memories of her husband to her devoted listeners. Fezzeh Khanum remained the
only servant of the house; she would cook meals for and serve these guests. In addition, Fezzeh
Khanum—because of her close association with the Bab—inherited some of the Prophet’s
charisma. She also became an object of reverence and devotion for visiting pilgrims. These
pilgrims would bow to kiss her shoulder as an act of subordination and reverence.29 This is the

only case of the veneration of an African woman by Shi’ite Muslims (here, as Baha’is) that I am
aware of in Iranian history.

Khadijeh Bagum and Fezzeh Khanum both died of dysentery on the same day in 1882—
thirty-two years after the Bab’s execution. Fezzeh was 47 years old, her mistress was 60. They
were both interred in a shrine tomb, Shah-e Cheragh, in Shiraz, considered sacred to Shi’ite
Muslims. In a Tablet revealed posthumously in honor of Khadijeh Bagum, Baha’u’llah
recognizes her as a holy figure and also beatifies Fezzeh Khanum as well, without actually
naming her.30

Both Haji Mubarak and Fezzeh Khanum lived at the center of their master’s family. Because
of the unique circumstances that surrounded the establishment of a new religious movement by

their master, and the documentation that the Bab and others created around those events, we are
able to recover partial biographies of the lives of his slaves. We can actually learn a great deal
about them. This provides us with an extraordinary window on domestic slavery in nineteenth-
century Iran. The roles that the Bab’s slaves played within his family may not have been much
different than the roles of slaves in other merchant families. Enslaved men and women were
incorporated into family networks and found their places within them.

Unfortunately, there is no record of even one word spoken by either Fezzeh Khanum or Haji
Mubarak. All of our information about them is mediated through others. In all probability, their
voices are lost to history. They remain subaltern and silent. Though pious Baha’i histories
sometimes mention them, they steadfastly refuse to ascribe to them any significance beyond their
personal devotion to the Prophet. Despite their honored positions within the Bab’s family, they
are treated as non-persons; in fact, as slaves. But we should not assume as a consequence that
they had no inner life or no personal identity. This would be a serious mistake, as the story of
Gulchihreh Khanum demonstrates below. Historians must struggle to listen to the voices of
subaltern actors, even if those voices cannot be heard.31

Case Number Three: Seeking Refuge in Lengeh

Niambi Cacchioli has discussed two Africans previously unknown to history who were enslaved
by 1856, in Lengeh, a port town on the southern coast of Iran, west of Bandar Abbas, and an

important center of African slave trading.32 Khyzran Khanum, a young woman of about 22

years, and a 13-year-old boy named Walladee both sought protection from the British agent in
the town, Mulla Ahmad, an Iranian. He wrote their testimonies down for his employer.33

Khyzran Khanum and Walladee found themselves in different situations, however.

Khyzran had been born a slave in a town near Zanzibar in about 1834. She was a domestic slave
there until the age of 13, when she was freed upon the death of her master. Several years later,
both she and her sister were abducted on the streets of Zanzibar one evening by a slave trader as
they were returning home. They were hidden on board a dhow with twenty other captives and
carried to Ras al-Khaymah, on the Arabian Peninsula, where they were sold to individual buyers.
Khyzran was separated from her sister at this point and sold, along with Walladee and another
slave, to a dealer based in Lengeh. The three were smuggled into Iran. Khyzran was sold to a
resident of Lengeh, identified as Kammal and worked as a domestic servant in his house.
Khyzran explained that she was expected to remain indoors. She says: “Kammal insisted that I
was not to show myself outside the house because the English Agent would see me.”34 She did
not necessarily follow these instructions, however, since we find that she was able to make
contact with other slaves in Lengeh sometime later.

Within a short time, Kammal left to visit his native village. Khyzran Khanum claimed
that he simply abandoned her, though this seems unlikely. Perhaps he assumed that she could
rely on a network of African slaves in the town to sustain herself until he returned. Or perhaps,
his newly acquired slave simply took the opportunity to attempt to regain her freedom. But, in

\[33\] Found in IOR R/15/1/157, British Library. The details of the case, according to Cacchiolli, are found in the
statements given by the two slaves at the Basaidu freed slave depot and in correspondence between Mulla Ahmad
and th Persian Gulf Political Resident, Mr. Felix Jones.

any case, Khyzran sought out the consul of another slave woman in Lengeh who advised her
that: “Rather than attempting to locate my owner, I should go to Ahmed the Agent who would
save me, which he did.” Mulla Ahmad helped her to file a petition with the British Agency
claiming her freedom on the grounds that she had been abandoned by her owner after having
been illegally imported into Iran.

A few days later, while still in Lengeh, Khyzran ran into Walladee on the street. He told
her that he had been sold to another resident of the town. She informed him about Mulla Ahmad
and escorted him to the British agent’s house. There Ahmad filed a claim for emancipation on
behalf of Walladee also and arranged for the two fugitives to stay at the slave asylum at Basaidu.
The claims of illegal importation seemed sound since the stories of the two enslaved Africans
corroborated one another. They had clearly been imported that year.

These events actually demonstrate a remarkable understanding of recent laws and decrees
concerning the importation of slaves into Iran, which had only recently been taken effect, and of
the role that the British might play in securing the release of recent captives. In 1848, the British
government had pressured Muhammad Shah to issue a decree (firman) which forbade the
importation by sea of all African slaves. This order had little effect in reality, however, since the
shah died later that year, and the new Nasiru’l Din Shah did nothing to enforce it. Furthermore,
the new government insisted that the British had no authority to enforce the anti-slavery law on
Iranian territory. It was only in 1851, with the Anglo-Persian slave trade agreement, that the
British gained the concession that would allow them to search Iranian vessels, seize illegal
cargoes, and manumit any slaves found to have been brought into the country after that date.
Enforcement proved to be extremely difficult, however, and British efforts were intermittent and

usually ineffective. For the most part, slave traders could easily avoid what they regarded as
British meddling.35

It appears, however, that the slave communities in Iran, at least in the southern ports,
were very much aware of the new agreements with the British and were alive to take advantage
of them. In 1856, only five years after the concession, Khyzran was able to learn of the
possibility of British manumission on the streets of Lengeh from another slave woman. Her
informant seems to have understood that since she and Walladee had been imported very
recently (that is, after 1851), they were eligible. Khyzran claimed to have been abandoned by
her master; Walladee simply escaped. The former seems to have been more realistic about her
enslavement and had played the role assigned to her until her master left the city. She had, after
all been born a slave in Zanzibar. Walladee, at thirteen, probably hoped for a chance to return to
Africa.36

Cacchioli does not discuss Khyzran Khanum’s position as a slave or the reason for her
master’s departure. But it seems virtually certain that she had been purchased as a concubine, as
well as a household servant. Since Kammal was returning to his home village for a visit, it
appears that he did not want to have his relationship with Khyzran known to his relatives and
fellow villagers. Most especially, he may have left a wife at home and did not want to
complicate his domestic relationship.37 He does seem to be curiously confident, however, that
Khyzran would have no avenue of escape, despite his warnings to her about the British agent.

\[36\] This is suggested by research on runaway slaves in America. Slaves in the country for less than a year more often
ran away in an effort to return to Africa. See, for example, Gerald W. Mullin, Flight and Rebellion: Slave
Resistance in Eighteenth-Century Virginia (Oxford University Press, 1977).

\[37\] It seems likely to me that a man, at this time, who was wealthy enough to purchase a slave woman would have
already been married some time before.

Perhaps he did not regard the British as any real threat to his property, but only an unwanted
annoyance.

If so, he was correct. Some days after Walladee’s escape, the local shaykh at Lengeh
filed a vigorous complaint with the British Agency on behalf of the boy’s outraged master. The
latter claimed that Walladee was not a new import but had been in his service for two years. It
does not seem that he offered any evidence of this, however. Nonetheless, the shaykh demanded
the return of Walladee to his master and even threatened to use force, if necessary. Of course,
Kammal was out of town and there were no similar complaints from him, though we might
imagine that there would have been upon his return.

The local Agency found the situation rather prickly. Therefore, it was decided that the
Iranian Mulla Ahmad had never been authorized to assist fugitive slaves, although some British
officials stationed in Lengeh had done so. The Agency ordered the return of both Khyzran and
Walladee from Basaidu. The boy was to be immediately restored to his owner. Presumably,
Khyzran Khanum would be returned to Kammal, if and when he returned to town. In any case,
she could not rely on any assistance from the British. Mulla Ahmad lost his job for stepping out
of place.

Unfortunately, both Khyzran Khanum and Walladee disappear from the British records at
this point. It is unlikely that any other record of them will be found. However, we can still
reconstruct a small piece of their lives, the stories of their enslavement, and their efforts to gain
their freedom. These stories are not only valuable for their own sakes, but also demonstrate to us
something about the nature of slavery and freedom in nineteenth-century Iran. Although briefly
free, without a powerful protector within Iranian society, the two were enslaved once again.

Case Number Four: The Lifelong Protest of Gulchihreh Khanum

Abul-Qasim Afnan (1921-2004), a descendant of the Bab’s uncle and the author of Black
Pearls,38 his memoir of the African slaves associated with the early history of the Baha’i
religion, recounts the story of another African woman, Golchihreh Khanum. She was a slave in
the household of the children and grandchildren Bab’s uncle, in whose home Khadijeh Bagum
and Fezzeh Khanum had lived for a time. Afnan was one of the grandchildren. He recounts
fond memories of the African servants who remained in the home during his childhood.39

Gulchihreh was a woman of Ethiopian origin and had been captured and enslaved as a child,
just as Fezzeh Khanum had been. Afnan recounts his personal memories of her as a servant in
his parents’ home, and so captures her voice. She clearly acted as his nursemaid in his early
years. He writes:

> I remember Gulchihrih distinctly. She was a tall, slender woman with an attractive face.
> She was jolly, talkative and very fond of the water pipe. She came to the house of my
> father to care for my mother, and she lived with us for many years until her death.

Gulchihrih remembered her home and her childhood days in Africa. She would
> hold me on her lap and tell me about her life before she was taken as a slave. Not once
> was she able to finish her story without my breaking down and weeping for her. She
> would lovingly describe the wide, tree-lined avenues of her native town and the large
> home in which she lived.

\[38\] See Note 6. The story of Gulchihreh Khanum is taken from this source.

\[39\] Slavery was not formally outlawed in Iran until 1928. Both before and after that date, however, African servants
lived in a relationship of polite dependency on the families they were attached to. I assume that this was the case
with Gulchihreh within the Afnan family, since Baha’i religious law had forbidden slavery from 1873. (Baha’u’llah,
The Kitáb-i Aqdas, K72.)

She would say: “There was a brook running near our house where I would play
> with my brothers and sisters. Our parents warned us to beware of white men. One day,
> while playing with my friends, we spotted two camel riders approaching. As they drew
> near, the older children recognized who they were and fled. I could not keep up with
> them and was soon caught. One of them put a knife to my throat and threatened me. I
> dared not say a word. They took me away, and eventually I was shipped to Bushihr.”
> She would describe her father and mother, and aunts and uncles, and the love that existed
> among them. She remembered also that she had a newborn brother who was very dear to
> her.40

Such vivid memories of her childhood would seem to indicate that Gulchihrih Khanum, despite
her circumstances in Iran, was able to maintain an African identity for all of her life. She seems
to have found her place within the Afnan family, and she is remembered as a beloved caretaker
of the children. Nonetheless, she asserted her African identity every time she recounted the story
of her capture to the children of the family. At these same moments, she protested her
enslavement and the violence of the slave trade. Her repeated tellings of the story were certainly
intentional, and in this way she preserved her voice so that it could be heard by posterity.41

So, we may, perhaps, be allowed to substitute her voice for the voice of Fezzeh Khanum,
who served the same family a generation earlier and was also a child at the time of her capture in
Africa. It is likely then that Fezzeh Khanum also never forgot her origins or discarded her
African identity. Perhaps we can even hear the voices of Khyzran Khanum of Lengeh and her

preserve her voice for posterity through repeated tellings of the story of her capture to a child in her care, see Fatima

lost her sister echoed here in Gulchihrih Khanum’s lament for her lost family and country and
her subtle, yet stubborn, protest against the evils of slavery.

Conclusions

Together, these glimpses of the lives of enslaved Africans demonstrate that a history of African
slavery in Iran can be written—and not just written in the broad strokes of laws, treaties,
statistics, and government policies. The lives of individual slaves can be recovered and studied.
Such studies of the African actors in Iranian history will provide a new window on Iran’s past.
This window has the potential of yielding new insights into the nature of slavery and freedom in
Iran and other Muslim societies. These four case studies demonstrate that modern Western
notions of chattel slavery are of little use when studying slavery in these societies.

The fortunate sisters, Bahrazain Khanum and Nur Sabbah Khanum, were able to achieve
their freedom upon the unexpected death of their master, and they fell heir to his wealth. But
they found their new status worthless, even dangerous. They remained vulnerable to whoever
might come along to take advantage of them, and they were ultimately re-enslaved. Bahrazain
Khanum, at least, found herself in a worse position than before and fled to British protection.

Fezzeh Khanum was certainly a slave, but she achieved a permanent and respected position
within the family that adopted her. She lived at the center of her mistress’s world, alongside her
until her death. Haji Mubarak was blessed and honored almost as a father figure by his master.
He was entrusted with the care of master’s mother and grandmother. At the same time, both
servants remained non-persons in terms of their independent personal identities and were erased
from history as a consequence. Nonetheless, they seem to have accommodated themselves to

their positions within the Afnan family, as did Gulchihreh Khanum some time later. At least the
latter was able to preserve for us a trace of her own voice. Presumably, these three Africans
would represent the norm of nineteenth-century Iranian slavery: the norm of subordinate persons
embedded in extended families.

Khayzran Khanum and Walladee, on the other hand, are two more Africans found only in the
British records as fugitive slaves petitioning for assistance. Along with Bahrazain Khanum, they
represent the exception, rather than the rule for African slaves in Iran. These two refused, at
least a first, to be incorporated into the family networks of their masters and made an
unsuccessful bid for freedom. That such freedom would have been viable without a powerful
protector seems unlikely, however. As recent imports, they may not have understood this social
predicament.

Just how such complex relationships are to be conceptualized by historians raises difficult
problems for the study of all Middle Eastern slavery: problems that have not yet been resolved.
But it is clear that a simple binary concept of slave/free rooted in Western concepts of slavery
and freedom found within the legal frameworks of the nation-state is inadequate to account for
complexities of slave life in Iran.
