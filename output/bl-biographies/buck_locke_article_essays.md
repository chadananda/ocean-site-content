Alain Locke: Race Leader, Social Philosopher,
Bahá’í Pluralist

History remembers Alain Locke (1885–1954) as the first African-Ameri-
can Rhodes Scholar (1907); as the “Dean” of the Harlem Renaissance
(1919–34);1 and, increasingly (as archival sources yield their treasures),
as a Bahá’í race-amity leader who used his academic training in
philosophy to further race relations. The ³rst achievement is individual; the second
is “national” (particularly with respect to black nationalism); the third is national,
with international implications. Locke edited The New Negro, ³rst published in 1925
and acclaimed as the “³rst national book” of African Americans.2 One scholar writes
that “Only a few claims regarding the Harlem Renaissance are uncontested: that
The New Negro stands as the ‘keystone,’ the ‘revolutionary’ advertisement, and the
‘³rst national book’ of African America is one of them.”3 Locke is rightly recognized
as the “chief intellectual rival” of W. E. B. Du Bois, a Harvard-trained sociologist
and civil-rights leader.4 Indeed, Locke’s role is somewhat analogous to that of Martin
Luther King:5 Whereas King championed the civil rights of African Americans
through nonviolent civil disobedience, Locke did so through a process known as
“civil rights by copyright.”6 During the Jim Crow era (approximately 1883 to 1964),
when laws throughout the United States a²orded blacks no e²ective legal or political
recourse, Locke used the arts as a means for winning the respect of the white majority

and for calling to its attention the need for fully democratizing democracy and for
Americanizing America by extending full equality to all minorities.7

What history has largely forgotten about Locke is that he was a member of the
Bahá’í Faith, which he embraced in 1918—the same year he was awarded a doctorate
from Harvard University. Given the Bahá’í Faith’s commitment to eliminating racial
prejudice, it is time to begin appreciating the range of contributions Locke made,

between 1918 and 1954, to

termine. Ignoring that in-
·uence altogether is to discount the Bahá’í factor completely. Yet overstating the
Bahá’í in·uence may not be accurate either. Arguing synergy may be the most
equitable analysis.

One way to approach Locke’s place in history is to focus on speci³c places that
exerted the most profound in·uences on him. Harvard, Harlem, Haifa—place
names that represent Locke’s special involvement in philosophy, art, and religion—
are keys to understanding his life and thought. Harvard prepared Locke for distinc-
tion as the ³rst black Rhodes Scholar in 1907, and, in 1918, awarded him a doctorate,
securing his position as chair of the Department of Philosophy at Howard University
from 1927 until his retirement in 1953. Harlem was the Mecca of the Harlem
Renaissance, whereby Locke, as a spokesman for his race, revitalized racial solidarity
and fostered the group consciousness among African Americans that proved to be
a necessary precondition of the civil-rights movement of the 1960s. Haifa is the
World Center of the Bahá’í Faith, Locke’s adopted religion. Until recently Locke’s
membership in the Bahá’í Faith has been the least understood aspect of his life.
During the Jim Crow era, at a time when black people saw little possibility for
interracial harmony, this new religion o²ered hope through its “race-amity” e²orts,
which Locke was instrumental in organizing. These three spheres of Locke’s activi-
ties—the academy, the art world, and spiritual society—converge to create a com-
posite picture of him as an integrationist whose model was not assimilation but
rather “unity through diversity” (the title of one of his essays published in The Bahá’í
World in 1930).8

Early Life, 1885–1911
When asked, Locke would always say that he was born in 1886.9 But he was actually
born a year earlier in Philadelphia—on September 13, 1885.10 Although his birth
name was “Arthur,” his parents may have actually named him “Alan.”11 At the age
of sixteen Locke adopted the French spelling “Alain” (close to the American pro-
nunciation of “Allen”) and added a middle name, “LeRoy” (probably because he
was called “Roy” as a child).12 He was the only son of Pliny Locke and Mary
(Hawkins) Locke, who had been engaged for sixteen years before they married.13

8     World Order, 2005, Vol. 36, No. 3
A child of Northern Reconstruction and of privilege, the young boy led a somewhat
sheltered life and was given an enlightened upbringing and a private education. He
was raised as an Episcopal and during his youth became enamored with classical
Greek philosophy.14

Because in infancy Locke was stricken with rheumatic fever, which permanently
damaged his heart, he was predisposed to music and reading. He dealt with his
“rheumatic heart” by seeking “compensatory satisfactions” in books, piano, and
violin.15 Only six years old when his father died, Locke was sent by his mother to
an Ethical Culture School—a pioneering experimental program of pedagogy devised
by Friedrich Froebel (1782–1852), who had opened the ³rst kindergarten. By the
time Locke entered Philadelphia’s Central High School in 1898, he was already an
accomplished pianist and violinist. In 1902, after completing high school, Locke
prepared to continue a family tradition by becoming a teacher. He enrolled in the
Philadelphia School of Pedagogy for Men, graduating second in his class in 1904.16
During the same year he entered Harvard College with honors, one of a very few
African-American undergraduates.

During the “golden age of philosophy at Harvard,” Locke studied at a time when
Josiah Royce, William James, George Herbert Palmer, Hugo Münsterberg, and
Ralph Barton Perry were on the faculty. Elected to Phi Beta Kappa, Locke won,
in 1907, the Bowdoin Prize—Harvard’s most prestigious academic award—for an
essay entitled “The Literary
Heritage of Tennyson.”17 He also    LOCKE WON, IN 1907 , THE BOWDOIN PRIZE—

which had been established in
1904 by diamond magnate Cecil Rhodes. Locke completed his four-year under-
graduate program at Harvard in only three years, graduating magna cum laude with
a bachelor of arts degree in philosophy.18 Then he made history and headlines in
May 1907 as America’s ³rst—and only, until the 1960s—African-American Rhodes
Scholar. While his Rhodes Scholarship provided for study abroad at Oxford, it was
no guarantee of admission. In his Rhodes Scholarship interview, Locke stated that
one of his objectives for studying abroad, in addition to “‘the further education,’”
was seeing “‘the race problem from the outside.’” “‘I don’t want to run away from
it,’” he said, “‘but I do want to see it in perspective.’”19 Rejected by ³ve Oxford
colleges because of his race, he was ³nally admitted to Hertford College, where he
studied from 1907 to 1910.

To broaden his perspective and to see racism within its global context, Locke
joined the Oxford Cosmopolitan Club, whose members included students from
India, Norway, Russia, Scotland, South Africa, and other countries. One member,
Pa Ka Isaka Sime, eventually founded the African National Congress of South
Africa. Formed around 1905, the Cosmopolitan Club was possibly the ³rst such club
to be established at a European university. The Club grew in signi³cance when Locke
became involved in 1907, since he brought valuable knowledge about cosmopolitan
clubs in the United States.20

1907 and 1910. Because such clubs were new to European universities and because of Locke’s familiarity
with U.S. clubs, his presence brought life to the Oxford Cosmopolitan Club. Courtesy, Locke Papers,

But perhaps the most signi³cant in·uence on Locke at Oxford was his friendship
with fellow Harvard graduate Horace Kallen, a Sheldon traveling fellow, who also
matriculated at Oxford in 1907. During his senior year at Harvard, Locke had met
Kallen, a German-born Jew who was a graduate teaching assistant in George Santayana’s
course on Greek philosophy in which Locke had enrolled. Thus began a lifelong
friendship. Kallen recorded some valuable personal observations about Locke as a
young man. For example, he noted that Locke was “very sensitive, very easily hurt.”21
Moreover, Locke strenuously insisted that “‘I am a human being,’” that “‘We are
all alike Americans,’” and that his “‘color ought not to make any di²erence.’”22 Locke
corroborates his views in a letter he wrote to his mother, Mary Locke, shortly after
receiving his Rhodes Scholarship, insisting that “‘I am not a race problem. I am
Alain LeRoy Locke.’”23 In that era, unfortunately, color made an enormous di²erence.
The social reality of the ³rst decade of the twentieth century, and for many decades
thereafter, was that Locke’s self-image was a wish-image for his entire life, dying as
he did less than a month after the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1954 Brown v. Board of
Education decision.

Kallen has described a racial incident over a Thanksgiving Day dinner hosted at
the American Club at Oxford, a dinner to which Locke was not invited because
of some “gentlemen from Dixie who could not possibly associate with Negroes.”24
Elsewhere Kallen’s accounts are more blunt: “[W]e had a race problem because the
Rhodes Scholars from the South were bastards. So they had a Thanksgiving dinner
which I refused to attend because they refused to have Locke.”25 After inviting Locke

10      World Order, 2005, Vol. 36, No. 3

to tea in lieu of the Thanksgiving dinner, Kallen wrote that, “tho’ it is personally
repugnant to me to eat with him . . . but then, Locke is a Harvard man and as
such he has a de³nite claim on me.”26 Ironically, Kallen harbored some of the same
prejudices as the Southern Rhodes Scholars who shunned Locke—but not to the
same degree. “As you know, I have neither respect nor liking for his race,” Kallen
wrote in an earlier letter, “but individually they have to be taken, each on his own
merits and value, and if ever a Negro was worthy, this boy is.”27 Locke was deeply
wounded: “Now, the impact of that kind of experience left scars,” remarks Kallen.28
In fact, even before they left the United States for Oxford, these same Southern
Rhodes Scholars who refused to invite Locke to the Thanksgiving dinner had
“formally appealed to the Rhodes trustees to overturn Locke’s award”—but to no
avail.29

At Oxford, or possibly in an earlier conversation at Harvard, Locke asked Kallen,
“‘[W]hat di²erence does the di²erence [of race] make?’” “In arguing out those
questions,” Kallen recounted, “the phrase ‘cultural pluralism’ was born.”30 While
Kallen coined the term in an
historic conversation with            LOCKE DEVELOPED THE CONCEPT OF

cal framework for the better-
ment of African Americans and has recently been acknowledged as “the father of
multiculturalism.”31

Distancing himself from Kallen’s purist and separatist conceptions, Locke was
part of the cultural-pluralist movement that ·ourished between the 1920s and the
1940s. Indeed, during his time at Oxford he experienced a crucial transformation:
At entrance, Locke saw himself as a cultural cosmopolitan; on exit, he had resolved
to be a race leader, although he did not know how he would ful³ll that role. While
at Oxford, Locke founded the African Union Society and served as its secretary,
thereby greatly broadening his international contacts in Africa and the Caribbean,
which proved valuable in later life.

So acutely did the Thanksgiving Day dinner incident traumatize Locke that he
left Oxford without taking a degree and spent the 1910–11 academic year studying
Kant at the University of Berlin and touring Eastern Europe. During his stay in
Berlin, he studied the Austrian school of anthropology, known as philosophical
anthropology, under the tutelage of Franz Brentano, Alexius von Meinong, Chris-
tian Freiherr von Ehrenfels, Paul Natorp, and others. Locke much preferred Europe
to America. Indeed, there were moments when Locke resolved never to return to
the United States. Reluctantly, he did so in 1911, evidently in late April. However,
Locke intended to return to Oxford at a later date (when exchange rates had dropped
low enough) “to take the Oxford degree.”32

During the spring and summer of that year, Locke would taste ³rst-hand the
scarifying hatred of the racialized Deep South, an experience that would be a turning
point in his life. From March 1 to March 8,33 he accompanied famed black educator,
race leader, and organizer of black businesses Booker T. Washington, the most

World Order, 2005, Vol. 36, No. 3   11

powerful black man in America at the time, on a trip possibly to further Washington’s
mission of promoting economic self-reliance among African Americans. They trav-
eled through Florida, beginning in Pensacola, although there is evidence that their
travels together lasted two months.34

In addition to the time he spent traveling with Washington, Locke continued
to travel in the Deep South for six months, presumably through the summer of 1911.
There were moments when he feared for his life. As a direct result of his experience
with racism in the South, he resolved to promote the interests of African Ameri-
cans—and thereby of all Americans—using culture as a strategy. At Oxford, Locke
knew he was preparing himself to be a race leader. But he did not know in what
capacity he would lead. During this trip in the South, Locke began to see how he
could use culture to promote race pride and equality, for, unlike politics, culture
is a means of expressing and communicating the aspirations and genius of a people.

Later, in an unpublished autobiographical note, Locke re·ected on the circum-
stances that led to the momentous decision in his life and career:

> Returning home in 1911, I spent six months travelling in the South—my ³rst
> close-range view of the race problem—and there acquired my life-long avocational
> interest in encouraging and interpreting the artistic and cultural expression of
> Negro life, for I became deeply convinced of its e¹cacy as an internal instrument
> of group inspiration and morale and as an external weapon of recognition and
> prestige. . . . My connection with the literary and art movement, styled in 1925
> the “New Negro” renaissance, was thus a logical outcome of this artistic creed
> and viewpoint.35

Evidence suggests that Locke may have attended the First Universal Races Congress
held on July 26–29, 1911, at the University of London, for his later comments
indicate how deeply the Congress impressed him. In 1916, in the ³rst of ³ve historic
lectures on race relations delivered at Howard University, Locke spoke of the Con-
gress’ inspiring him to advance its social goals:

> Ladies and Gentlemen: Ever since the possibility of a comparative study of races
> dawned upon me at the Races Congress in London in 1911, I have had the courage
> of a very optimistic and steadfast belief that in the scienti³c approach to the race
> question, there was the possibility of a redemption for those false attitudes of
> mind which have, unfortunately, so complicated the idea and conception of race
> that there are a great many people who fancy that the best thing that can possibly
> be done, if possible at all, is to throw race out of the categories of human
> thinking.36

It is possible that Locke may have ³rst heard about the Bahá’í Faith during the
1911 Congress, for its overarching purpose was to promote greater rapport between
East and West, a corollary being the objective of countering the worldwide racism
of the era. While British Bahá’ís participated in the event, of far greater moment
was the invitation the organizers sent to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the son of the Founder of
the Bahá’í Faith, to speak before the Congress. Declining to do so because of
circumstances, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sent a message to be read in absentia to the conference
participants. In it, He said, in part:

This Congress is one of the greatest of events. It will be forever to the glory of

12     World Order, 2005, Vol. 36, No. 3

ALAIN LOCKE

> England that it was established at her capital. . . . Let Brotherhood be felt and
> seen among you; and carry ye its quickening power throughout the world. It is
> my prayer that the work of the Congress will bear great fruit.37

In addition to the reading of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s message, another occurrence indicates
that Locke may have heard about the Bahá’í Faith during the London Congress.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá in London includes a report containing a question put to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

One of the organizers of the Races Congress present spoke of the Western
> ideals of Bahá’u’lláh [1817–92, the Founder of the Bahá’í Faith] as di²ering from
> those of former prophets which were tinged with the ideas and civilization of
> the East. He then asked whether Bahá’u’lláh had made a special study of Western
writings, and founded his teachings in accordance with them.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá laughed heartily, and said that the books of Bahá’u’lláh, written
> and printed sixty years ago, contained the ideals now so familiar to the West,
> but, at that time, they had not been printed or thought of in the West.38

The report attests independently that information about the Bahá’í Faith was pre-
sented in at least two di²erent forms (‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s letter and His oral dismissal
of the imputation of the Western provenance of Bahá’u’lláh’s principles), presumably
in a single session. If Locke was present in the auditorium at that time, he surely
would have learned of the Bahá’í religion on that occasion.

Early Academic Career, 1912–18
On September 3, 1912, with the help of Booker T. Washington, Locke joined the
faculty of the Teachers College at Howard University.39 As an Assistant Professor
of the Teaching of English and Instructor in Philosophy and Education, Locke
taught literature, English, education, and ethics—and later, ethics and logic—at
Howard University, although he did
not have an opportunity to teach a                  ON SEPTEMBER 3, 1912,

study of race and race relations. His
rationale was that “a study of race contacts is the only scienti³c basis for the
comprehension of race relations.”40 But most of the white ministers on Howard
University’s Board of Trustees rejected his petition because they felt that contro-
versial subjects such as race had no place at a school whose mission was to educate
young, black professionals. Although there was some support for Locke’s proposed
lectures (from Dean Kelly Miller of the College of Arts and Sciences, Dean Lewis
Moore of the Teachers College, and Dr. William Sinclair, a member of the Board
of Trustees), according to Locke biographer Je²rey C. Stewart, Howard’s white
president in 1916, the Reverend S. M. Newman, “was particularly discouraging of
the idea that Negro or race studies should be developed at Howard.”41 However, in
1915 and 1916 the Howard chapter of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People (NAACP) and the Social Science Club sponsored a two-year
extension course of public lectures, which Locke called “Race Contacts and Inter-
Racial Relations: A Study in the Theory and Practice of Race.”42

World Order, 2005, Vol. 36, No. 3   13

In the lectures Locke deconstructed the pseudo-scienti³c view of race as “ethnic
³ctions” and reconstructed a social conception of race that represented a further
development of the thought of cultural anthropologist Franz Boas, the acknowl-
edged father of American anthropology, whom Locke considered a “major prophet

of democracy.” 43 Locke re-

Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson.44 In assessing the “contemporary relevance” of
these historic lectures, Stewart states that “No contemporary thinker has blended
together in one statement or theory the many diverse insights Locke o²ers in Race
Contacts.”45

During the 1916–17 academic year, Locke took a sabbatical from Howard University
to become the Austin Teaching Fellow at Harvard. During the sabbatical, Locke

reality; products of time, place and situation, and thus systems of timed history
rather than timeless eternity.”47 In anchoring philosophy in social reality, Locke
studied the determinative role of values in the human experience and developed a

14     World Order, 2005, Vol. 36, No. 3

typology of values. In his dissertation Locke recapitulated his “psychology of value-
types”: “We have therefore taken values classed, rather roughly and tentatively, as
Hedonic, Economic, Aesthetic, Ethical and Moral, Religious, and Logical, aiming
to discover in terms of the generic distinctions of a value-psychology their type-
unity, character, and speci³c di²erentiae with respect to other types.”48 Later, in
“Values and Imperatives,” Locke reduces his taxonomy to four types of values: (1)
Religious; (2) Ethical/Moral; (3) Aesthetic/Artistic; (4) Logical/Scienti³c.49

Conversion to the Bahá’í Faith and Early Bahá’í Activities, 1918–23
When Locke was awarded his doctorate from Harvard in 1918, he emerged as perhaps
the most exquisitely educated and erudite African American of his generation. The
year 1918 was another turning point in Locke’s life, for he found a spiritual home
in the Bahá’í Faith, a new world religion the central message of which is the unity
of the human race. Previous schol-
arship has failed to establish the WHEN LOCKE WAS AWARDED HIS DOCTORATE

mentary evidence was lacking for such
a date,50 and non-Bahá’í scholars had reached the same conclusion. In his Yale
doctoral dissertation on Locke, Stewart wrote that, “In the 1920s, Locke joined the
Bahai movement and formalized his separation from orthodox Christianity.”51 Stew-
ard cited as proof two letters in the Howard University archives from Locke to long-
time friend and patron Mrs. Charlotte Mason in 1932 and 1936; yet, on close
inspection, these letters include no mention of the Bahá’í Faith.52

But the National Bahá’í Archives has a Bahá’í Historical Record card that Locke
³lled out in 1935 when the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United
States and Canada, the national Bahá’í governing body of the two countries,
conducted a Bahá’í census, mailing the forms in triplicate to all Bahá’ís through their
Local Spiritual Assemblies (local Bahá’í governing bodies) and other channels.53
Under “Date of acceptance of the Bahá’í Faith,” Locke entered the year “1918.”54

Locke was one of seven black respondents from the Washington, D.C., Bahá’í
community to complete the card.55 In “Place of acceptance of Bahá’í Faith,” Locke
entered “Washington, D.C.” He personally completed and signed the card “Alain
Leroy Locke” (in the space designated, “19. Signature”). In a letter dated June 28,
1922, written shortly after the death of his mother, Locke states: “Mother’s feeling
toward the [Bahá’í’] cause, and the friends who exemplify it, was unusually receptive
and cordial for one who had reached conservative years,—it was her wish that I
identify myself more closely with it.” Locke honored her wish. At the end of the
letter, Locke speaks of the Bahá’í Faith as “this movement for human brotherhood.”56

Locke, as many American Bahá’ís had been doing for more than two decades,
undertook a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1923 (he went again in 1934).57 He

‘Abdu’l-Bahá to succeed Him as the Head of the Bahá’í Faith) as being “very good
and su¹cient.”58 The fact that Haifa and the Bahá’í shrines—not Bethlehem and
Jerusalem, centers of Christian pilgrimage—were his principal destinations attests
to the primacy of Locke’s religious identity as a Bahá’í rather than as a former
Episcopalian, as he was always designated in brief biographical notices of him
published during his lifetime.59

Contributions to Bahá’í Race Unity Efforts, 1921–30
In 1921, three years after becoming a Bahá’í, Locke began to be actively involved
in Bahá’í e²orts to promote the oneness of humankind, a central tenet of the Bahá’í
Faith. He took a leading role in the Bahá’ís’ “race-amity” initiatives sparked by the
bloody race riots during the “Red Summer” of 1919. He helped plan and execute

and also participated in the

with the second convention, which was held at the Central High School in Spring³eld,
Massachusetts, on December 5 and 6, 1921. A photograph of the event shows the
auditorium ³lled to capacity, with African Americans likely in the majority of those
attending.60

During his tenure on the Bahá’í race-amity committees from 1924 through 1930,
Locke made a number of signi³cant contributions. In 1929, while he was serving
on the National InterRacial [sic] Amity Committee for the 1929–30 Bahá’í year (his
sixth national committee appointment), the National Spiritual Assembly asked the
committee to draft a letter to U.S. First Lady Mrs. Herbert Hoover. She had held
a reception for the families of Congressmen, including the wife and daughter of
black Congressman Oscar De Priest, and was being severely criticized for it in
conservative sectors. The Committee’s annual report for that year notes that the

> along with a copy of the Bahá’í World. This letter commended Mrs. Hoover and
> her distinguished husband on their stand for peace and humanitarian service. It
> was pointed out that interracial amity is the basis of universal peace.61

The signi³cance of the letter to Mrs. Hoover lies in the fact that the committee
on which Locke served drafted, for the bene³t of the First Lady, a formal statement
of Bahá’í teachings on race relations. It is not known whether President Hoover
(1929–33) personally read the letter.

Role in the Harlem Renaissance
In 1925, seven years after he became a Bahá’í, two years after his ³rst Bahá’í
pilgrimage, and a year after he participated in the fourth Bahá’í race-amity confer-

16     World Order, 2005, Vol. 36, No. 3

ence, Locke was presented with an oppor-
tunity to further his determination to be
a race leader—this time in Harlem—by
using culture to foster race pride and race
unity. In 1924 Howard University had
granted him a sabbatical leave to collabo-
rate with the French Archaeological So-
ciety of Cairo, the highlight of his trip to
the Sudan and Egypt being the reopening
of the tomb of Tutankhamen in Luxor.
Locke was able to schedule his ³rst pil-
grimage to Haifa in conjunction with the
trip. The two trips had been some time
in the planning, for while he was in Berlin
(a favorite European summer destination
until the Nazi rise to power), a visa, dated
August 23, 1923, permitting him to travel
to “Egypt, Palestine & United Kingdom,”
was added to his 1922 passport.62 Locke
published a travel narrative of his visit to
Egypt called “Impressions of Luxor” (echo-
ing the title of his 1924 “Impressions of ALAIN LOCKE
Haifa”). The preface to the Egypt account the prime organizer and the acknowledged “Dean”
notes that Locke had “spent several months of the Harlem Renaissance, in 1925 published
in Europe, the Near East, Egypt, and the The New Negro: An Interpretation of Negro Life, a

landmark in black literature that was hailed as
Sudan, 1923–1924.”63                         “the ³rst national book” of African Americans.

When Locke returned from Egypt to Courtesy, Locke Papers/Moorland-Spingarn Re-

student strike had thrown the Howard
University campus into an upheaval. In June 1925, because of his support for an
equitable faculty pay scale and for student demands to end mandatory chapel and
ROTC, the University’s white president James Stanley Durkee ³red Locke.

Since he was no longer gainfully employed, Locke needed to ³nd a patron to
support his intellectual work. He found a benefactor in Charlotte R. Osgood Mason,
a wealthy white woman, who, through Locke, also became a patron to poet Langston
Hughes and novelist, folklorist, and anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston.64 For
thirteen years Mason ³nanced Locke’s annual trips to Europe, enabling him to begin
building his invaluable collection of African art, which he later bequeathed to
Howard University. Locke corresponded faithfully with Mason until her death in
1946\.

But Locke also needed a project. Hence he used what would become a year away
from Howard University to write and edit a work that would launch the Harlem
Renaissance. He had conceived it a year earlier when the editor of the Survey Graphic
asked him to produce an issue on New York City’s Harlem, an area with a large
concentration of African Americans. The special issue, Harlem, Mecca of the New

World Order, 2005, Vol. 36, No. 3    17

Negro, Locke recast as an anthology called The New Negro: An Interpretation of Negro
Life and published it in December 1925.65 A landmark in black literature, the book
was an instant success. Locke contributed ³ve essays: the “Foreword,” “The New
Negro,” “Negro Youth Speaks,” “The Negro Spirituals,” and “The Legacy of Ancestral
Arts.” The New Negro also featured ³ve white contributors, making this artistic tour
de force a genuinely interracial collaboration, with much support from white pa-
tronage (not without some strings attached, however).

The Harlem Renaissance—known also as the New Negro Movement, of which
Locke was both the prime organizer and spokesman—sought to advance freedom
and equality for blacks through art. The term “New Negro” dates back to A New
Negro for a New Century published in 1900 by Booker T. Washington, N. B. Wood,
and Fannie B. Williams.66 From 1925 onward, Locke engendered what was called
“race pride” among African Americans by fostering a new sense of the distinctiveness
of black culture and its enrichment of the American experience for all Americans,
thus giving concrete expression to the idea that had come to him during his travels
in the South in 1911. Not merely a great creative outburst during the Roaring
Twenties, the Harlem Renaissance was a highly self-conscious modern artistic
movement. In an unpublished report on race relations, Locke stated that the New
Negro Movement “deliberately aims at capitalizing race consciousness for group
inspiration and cultural development. But it has no political or separatist motives,
and is, in this one respect, di²erent from the nationalisms of other suppressed
minorities.”67

In its mythic and utopian sense, Harlem was the “race capital” and the largest
“Negro American” community in the world. The Harlem Renaissance, consequently,

presented itself as a micro-
THE HARLEM RENAISSANCE                        cosm or self-portraiture of

CULTURE TO AMERICA AND TO THE WORLD.             With its epic scope and lyric

depth, the movement was an
e²usion of art borne of the everyday African-American experience. The Harlem
Renaissance would establish Locke as the elder statesman of African-American art
in later life when his towering prestige wielded enormous authority.

In principle, Locke was an avowed supporter of Du Bois’ idea of a cultural elite
(the “Talented Tenth”) but di²ered from Du Bois’ insistence that art should serve
as propaganda.68 Even so, Locke hoped the Harlem Renaissance would provide “an
emancipating vision to America” and would advance “a new democracy in American
culture.” He spoke of a “race pride,” “race genius,” and the “race-gift.”69 “Race pride”
was to be cultivated through developing a distinctive culture, a hybrid of African
and African-American elements. For Locke, art ought to contribute to the improve-
ment of life—a pragmatist aesthetic principle sometimes called meliorism, or the
betterment of oppressed minorities. But the Harlem Renaissance was more of an
aristocratic than democratic approach to culture. Criticized by some African-Ameri-
can contemporaries, Locke himself came to regret the Harlem Renaissance’s excesses
of exhibitionism as well as its elitism. Its dazzling success was short-lived.

18     World Order, 2005, Vol. 36, No. 3

However, The New Negro did succeed in shaping a group identity and a collective
self-esteem among African Americans. This transformation—if not a formation—
of group consciousness was an absolutely necessary developmental stage that, three
decades later, made mass mobilization of African Americans under Martin Luther
King, Jr., far more possible. In his preface to the reissue of The New Negro anthology
in 1968, Robert Hayden (a well-known Bahá’í and America’s ³rst African-American
poet-laureate), echoes Locke’s vision of the Harlem Renaissance, which was rooted
in the transracial experience of America: “The Negro Renaissance was clearly an
expression of the Zeitgeist, and its writers and artists were open to the same in·uences
that their white counterparts were. What di²erentiated the New Negroes from other
American intellectuals was their race consciousness, their group awareness, their
sense of sharing a common purpose.”70

A little-known fact is that, shortly after The New Negro was published, Locke went
on an extended trip in the South, giving public lectures on the Bahá’í vision of race
unity. Speaking of Locke’s imminent departure for a lecture tour throughout the
Midwest and the Deep South, one Bahá’í described Locke’s deep commitment as
a Bahá’í:

In regard to Dr. Locke—he is at present in N.Y. but has written me saying
he “will keep his promise (to go South) in spite of many things”. . . .

The lecture opportunities Dr. Locke has must be the nucleus for his work for
> the Cause and of course he must proceed in perfect freedom. When he looked
> over the list of educators supplied by Mrs. [Keith Ransom-] Kehler, saying he
> knew about one third of them personally, he remarked smilingly[,] “How sur-
> prised they will be to know me as a Bahai”. His understanding of the way he
> will be at liberty to work coincided with my own idea of the best way to work—
> to meet his audiences upon their common ground and afterward convey the
Message which has moved his life. . . .

Dr. Locke does not attend Bahai meetings in Washington, but is deeply and
> truly a Bahai. It has been only by appealing to him in the most liberal spirit that
> I have been able to win his consent to do this work, and it is my hope that once
> under the Divine Protection of those having “arisen” he may go on to greater
> services.71

Between February 6 and sometime in March (or perhaps May) 1926, Locke spoke
in Cleveland and Cincinnati and at the Dunbar Forum at Oberlin College and at
Wilberforce University, all in Ohio; in Indianapolis, Indiana; and before “the best
Negro institutions in the Middle South and Northern Florida,” including the
Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute for Negro Girls and the Robert Hungerford
Normal and Industrial School near Orlando, Florida.72 Records indicate that Locke
spoke (albeit sporadically) at Bahá’í-sponsored events from 1921 through 1952—
a period of some thirty-one years. Locke’s last-known public talk (³reside) on the
Bahá’í Faith was given on March 23, 1952, in Toronto, Canada.

Locke’s return to Howard University was fostered by Du Bois. In a letter dated
May 5, 1927, he wrote to Howard administrator Jesse E. Moorland, lobbying for
Locke’s reinstatement: “Mr. Locke is by long odds the best trained man among the
younger American Negroes.”73 In June 1927 Howard University’s new African-

World Order, 2005, Vol. 36, No. 3   19

American president, Mordecai W. Johnson, reinstated Locke, although Locke did
not resume teaching there until June 1928, for during the 1927–28 academic year,
he was an exchange professor at Fisk University.

Locke was subsequently promoted to chair of Howard University’s Philosophy
Department. He is credited with having ³rst introduced into the university’s cur-
riculum the study of anthropology, philosophy, and aesthetics. A pioneer in the
Negro theater movement, and continuing to emphasize the role of culture in race
identity, Locke coedited in 1927 the ³rst African-American drama anthology, Plays
of Negro Life: A Source-Book of Native American Drama, which consisted of twenty
one-act plays and dramatic sketches—ten by white playwrights (including Eugene
O’Neill) and ten by black dramatists.74

Advisor for Translation of the Book of Certitude, 1930
The year 1930 found Locke serving the Bahá’í Faith as an editor. Shoghi E²endi
had begun to translate (from Persian and Arabic into English) the Kitáb-i-Íqán (the
Book of Certitude), the preeminent doctrinal work of Bahá’u’lláh. Recognizing
Locke’s literary abilities, Shoghi E²endi invited him to comment on his translation.75
In the Alain Locke Papers preserved in the Moorland–Spingarn Research Center at
Howard University are two letters to Locke, dated February 15 and July 5, 1930,
and written on behalf of Shoghi E²endi by his secretary at that time, Ruhi Afnan.
In the ³rst letter Ruhi Afnan told Locke that Shoghi E²endi was calling on him
as the person “best ³tted to render him [Shoghi E²endi] an assistance” in giving
critical feedback on the translation itself. Shoghi E²endi requested that Locke “go
over it [the translation] carefully, studying every sentence—its structure as well as
choice of words—and giving him [Shoghi E²endi] your [Locke’s] criticism as well
as constructive suggestions that would make it more lucid, English [sic] and forceful.”
Ruhi Afnan added: “Shoghi E²endi is fully aware of the many duties you have and
how pressing your time is, and had he known of an equally ³tting person he would
surely have saved you the trouble. Yet he ³nds himself to be compelled.”76 The ³rst
letter accompanied the ³rst half of the translation that Shoghi E²endi sent to Locke.
The second half of the Kitáb-i-Íqán was mailed later.

Locke did as Shoghi E²endi requested. In an undated letter, postmarked June
11, 1930, Locke wrote to Shoghi E²endi:

> As a whole the translation is a triumph of labor and insight into another language.
> It reads well and euphonically—and for so complicated a sentence structure is
> unusually clear. I know the need for full and literal translation, and therefore did
> not dare suggest certain cuts and shortening which would be desirable from the

Shoghi E²endi acknowledged Locke’s editorial assistance in a letter dated July
5, 1930, again written on his behalf: “Though they were not so many, he [Shoghi
E²endi] found the suggestions you gave most helpful.” Ruhi Afnan also reported
that “Shoghi E²endi has already incorporated your suggestions and sent his manu-
script to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada for
publication.”78 Shoghi E²endi, as was his frequent custom, added a postscript in
his own hand:
My dear co-worker:

I wish to add a few words expressing my deep appreciation of your valued
> suggestions in connexion with the translation of the Iqan. I wish also to express
> the hope that you may be able to lend increasing assistance to the work of the
> Cause, as I have always greatly admired your exceptional abilities and capacity
> to render distinguished services to the Faith. I grieve to hear of the weakness of
> your heart which I trust may through treatment be completely restored. I often
> remember you in my prayers and ever cherish the hope of welcoming you again
> in the Master’s home.
> Your true brother,
> Shoghi.79

Shoghi E²endi’s request for Locke’s editorial assistance and his gracious and
personal postscript to his July 5, 1930, letter further dispels doubts about Locke’s
commitment to the Bahá’í Faith or the depth of his convictions. Locke lived at a
time when it was considered
strange to be anything except a LOCKE OPTED FOR PRUDENCE,
Protestant or a Catholic, the two                 STUDIOUSLY AVOIDING REFERENCES TO THE

United States. To be a Bahá’í in
any public way was to risk one’s professional and social standing. Locke’s predica-
ment was by no means an isolated phenomenon. Under the pressure of religious
conformism within the sphere of American assimilationism, and in the absence of
religious pluralism as we know it today, all religious minorities faced the same
problem. Being a Jew during this period, for example, was to be an outsider. Thus
Locke opted for prudence, studiously avoiding references to the Bahá’í Faith in his
professional life, but nationalizing and internationalizing his Bahá’í principles in his
academic and scholarly works.

Yet three of Locke’s essays, in addition to the frequently reprinted “Impressions
of Haifa” written after his 1923 pilgrimage, were published in Bahá’í World volumes,
which were intended for the general public and civic and governmental leaders and
served as his public testimony of faith: “Unity through Diversity: A Bahá’í Prin-
ciple,” The Bahá’í World, Volume IV (1933); “The Orientation of Hope,” The Bahá’í
World, Volume V (1936); and “Lessons in World Crisis,” The Bahá’í World, Volume
IX (1945).80 But it was not until an article about the Bahá’í Faith called “Bahá’í
Faith: Only Church in World That Does Not Discriminate” appeared in the October

World Order, 2005, Vol. 36, No. 3   21

1952 issue of Ebony magazine that Locke’s Bahá’í identity was publicized in the
popular media. The article prominently featured Locke’s photograph together with
a caption, reading “Alain Locke, Howard professor, joined movement in 1915 [sic],
wrote for the Baha’i Magazine.”81

Locke and Adult Education
In 1936, under the auspices of the Associates in Negro Folk Education (ANFE),
Locke launched the Bronze Booklets on the History, Problems, and Cultural Contribu-
tions of the Negro series, written by such leading African-American scholars as

In 1943 Locke took a leave of absence from Howard University to serve as Inter-
American Exchange Professor to Haiti under the joint auspices of the American
Committee for Inter-American Artistic and Intellectual Relations and the Haitian
Ministry of Education. Toward the end of Locke’s stay, Haitian President Élie Lescot
personally decorated him with the National Order of Honor and Merit, grade of
Commandeur. While in Haiti, Locke wrote Le rôle du nègre dans la culture Américaine
[The Role of the Negro in American Culture], the nucleus of a grand project that

22     World Order, 2005, Vol. 36, No. 3

Locke believed would be his magnum opus.86 However, he was not able to ³nish
the project, which Margaret Just Butcher, daughter of Howard University colleague
and close friend Ernest E. Just, completed after Locke’s death and published in 1956
as The Negro in American Culture.87 Hence it is not considered to be one of Locke’s
authentic works.

In 1944 Locke became a charter member of the Conference on Science, Philoso-
phy and Religion, which published its annual proceedings. During the 1945–46
academic year, Locke was Visiting Professor at the University of Wisconsin, and
in 1947, Visiting Professor at the
New School for Social Research.            FOR THE 1946–47 TERM,

I do not recall his speaking from
notes.” After mentioning the fact that Locke was a Bahá’í, Singer noted that, “Dr.
Locke seemed somehow aloof, and my friends and I were pretty much in awe of
him.”88

For the 1946–47 term, Locke was elected president of the American Association
for Adult Education, the ³rst black president of a predominantly white organization.
His active role in the adult-education movement has already been established in the
nine-volume Bronze Booklet series.

Locke as a National Figure, 1930s–40s
Four instances will su¹ce to demonstrate Locke’s pro³le as a national ³gure. First,
Locke was an unpaid consultant to the CBS educational series “Americans All—
Immigrants All.” This twenty-six-week series highlighted a distinct ethnic group each
week and traced its history and contributions to America. On December 18, 1938,
“The Negro in The United States,” the sixth episode, was broadcast nationally on
CBS. Locke, working independently but in conjunction with Du Bois, revised and
ghost-wrote much of the script.89 Under the auspices of the Department of the
Interior, the series was distributed in transcription form for classroom use.

On December 20, 1940, Locke was invited to chair a concert, which was part
of a larger program commemorating “the seventy-³fth anniversary of the proclama-
tion of the thirteenth amendment [abolishing slavery] to the Constitution of the
United States.”90 Sponsored by the Music Division of the Library of Congress and
the Gertrude Clarke Whittall Foundation, the program featured a concert of tra-
ditional Negro folk music, performed by the Golden Gate Quartet and accompanied
by Joshua White on guitar and vocals. Locke gave a short opening lecture on “The
Negro Spiritual” and served as the event’s “time-keeper”—probably a euphemism
for master of ceremonies.91 Poet Sterling A. Brown introduced the blues and ballads,
with musicologist Alan Lomax commenting on the “reels” and work songs that the
quartet performed. Sound recordings of the concert were made in the Library of
Congress’ Coolidge Auditorium in Washington, D.C., and produced by the Music
Division and the Recording Laboratory of the Library of Congress.92

precisely the kind of question that would interest both a Bahá’í and the more
progressive members of the listening audience. Moderated by George V. Denny, Jr.,
the town meeting’s host, the show was broadcast nationally from the Howard
University campus in Washington, D.C. A transcript of the show was published
shortly afterward in the June issue of “Town Meeting: Bulletin of America’s Town
Meeting on the Air,” the program’s regular newsletter.93

Ever vigilant in terms of the need to translate the ideal into the real, Locke stressed
the pragmatic challenges that the quest for world unity faces:

> The fact is, the idealistic exponents of world unity and human brotherhood have
> throughout the ages and even today expected their ³gs to grow from thistles. We
> cannot expect to get international bread from sociological stone whether it be

> adamant of religious partisanship. . . . The question pivots, therefore, not on the
> desirability of world unity, but upon the more realistic issue of its practicability.”94

Locke’s observations are further evidence of his tireless e²orts to foster improved
race relations, whether within or outside the Bahá’í community.

24     World Order, 2005, Vol. 36, No. 3

Maturity as a Philosopher
Strangely enough, Locke did not publish a formal philosophical essay until he was
³fty. “Values and Imperatives” appeared in 1935. In fact, this was Locke’s only formal
philosophical work between The New Negro published in 1925 and 1947. Apart from
his doctoral dissertation in 1918, Locke published only four major articles in a
philosophy journal or anthology: “Values and Imperatives” (1935); “Pluralism and
Intellectual Democracy” (1942); “Cultural Relativism and Ideological Peace” (1944),
and “Pluralism and Ideological Peace” (1947).95

Bridging Harvard, Harlem, and Haifa
By Locke’s own admission, one of his objectives as a philosopher or cultural pluralist
was to “translate” Bahá’í principles e²ectively into secular values. Although he is
remembered primarily for being the spokesperson for the Harlem Renaissance, his
philosophical essays and his Bahá’í essays
contain obvious thematic resonances and LOCKE’S PRESCRIPTION FOR WORLD PEACE

his Bahá’í values. In an unpublished letter
to Shoghi E²endi in 1934, Locke spoke of the “factionalism of race” in America
and of his resolve to be “a modifying in·uence to radical sectionalism and to
increasing materialistic trends—and in this indirect way to serve the [Bahá’í] Cause
and help forward the universal principles.”96 In his 1933 essay “Unity through
Diversity: A Bahá’í Principle,” Locke e²ectively “translated” Bahá’í ideals “into more
secular terms” so that “a greater practical range will be opened up for the application
and ³nal vindication of the Bahá’í principles” in order to achieve “a positive mul-
tiplication of spiritual power.”97

In another e²ort to express his Bahá’í values in secular form, Locke forged a vital
link between American democracy and world democracy. In “Pluralism and Intel-
lectual Democracy,” presented at the Second Symposium Conference on Science,
Philosophy and Religion and published in 1942, Locke wrote that “The intellectual
core of the problems of peace . . . will be the discovery of the necessary common
denominators and the basic equivalences involved in a democratic world order or
democracy on a world scale.”98 In an unpublished Bahá’í essay, Locke wrote that
the “gospel for the Twentieth Century” and the prospect of “social salvation” must
³rst address the “fundamental problems of current America,” which are “materiality
and prejudice.” The sad irony is that America, which is “the land that is nearest
to material democracy” happens to be the land that “is furthest away from spiritual
democracy.”99 In the same essay, Locke quotes a prophecy by Bahá’u’lláh, recorded
by Cambridge University Orientalist Edward A. Browne, in an historic interview:

> That all nations shall become one in faith, and all men as brothers; that the bonds
> of a²ection and unity between the sons of men should be strengthened; that
> diversity of religion should cease, and di²erences of race be annulled. . . . These
> strifes and this bloodshed and discord must cease, and all men be as one kindred
> and family.”100

World Order, 2005, Vol. 36, No. 3   25

Bahá’u’lláh’s vision incorporates the three “basic corporate ideas” of nation, race, and
religion about which Locke writes in his 1944 paper “Moral Imperatives for World
Order.” In that brief but poignant essay, Alain Locke seems to echo and universalize
Bahá’u’lláh’s prophetic words in secular form: “The moral imperatives of a new world

order are an internationally

> tarian bigotry.”101 Of course,
> one cannot prove a direct
relationship between Locke‘s faith-based Bahá’í principles and his social philosophy.
But the resonances and the synergy are there, unmistakably—two facets of Locke’s
moral genius, which is panoramic in its global vision.

Other Achievements
Among his many other accomplishments, Locke served on the editorial board of
the American Scholar; was philosophy editor for the Key Reporter of Phi Beta Kappa;
and contributed regularly to various national magazines and journals, most notably
Opportunity (1929– 40) and Phylon (1947–53). He also wrote articles on Negro
culture and Harlem for the Encyclopaedia Britannica from 1940 through 1954. From
1948 through 1952, Locke taught concurrently at the City College of New York
and Howard University. In the 1951–52 academic year, Howard granted Locke a
leave of absence to produce The Negro in American Culture, conceived in Haiti but
left un³nished.

In June 1953 Locke retired from Howard University with the rank of professor
emeritus and with the university’s conferring an honorary degree of Doctor of
Humane Letters. On June 5, 1953, in his unpublished acceptance speech, Locke
said:

> In coming to Howard in 1912, I was fortunate, I think, in bringing a philosophy
> of the market place not of the cloister. For, however much a luxury philosophy
> may be in our general American culture, for a minority situation and a trained
> minority leadership, it is a crucial necessity. This, because free, independent and
> unimposed thinking is the root source of all other emancipations. . . . A minority
> is only safe and sound in terms of its social intelligence.102

In July 1953 Locke moved to New York. For most of his life he had sought
treatment for his rheumatic heart. Hence it was not a surprise when he died of heart
failure in Mount Sinai Hospital on June 9, 1954. On June 11 at Benta’s Funeral
Home in Harlem, Locke’s memorial was presided over by race-relations leader Dr.
Channing H. Tobias, with cremation following at Fresh Pond Crematory in Little
Village, Long Island.103

The brief notice that appeared in the Baha’i News in 1954 reported that “Quo-
tations from the Bahá’í Writings and Bahá’í Prayers were read at Dr. Locke’s fu-
neral.”104 Orations in honor of Locke were given by literary critic William Stanley

re·ecting on Locke’s legacy, “go beyond race; they belong to all humanity.” “He had
all but emancipated himself from the consciousness of color,” Karpman continued,
adding that “In his presence, one did not feel that he was speaking to a Negro or
to a particular human known as American, but to an urbane cosmopolitan.” Of
the di²erence he made in this world, Karpman said of Locke that “his in·uence
has penetrated millions of human souls”;

> He gave the Negro an individuality to a greater degree than the race had ever
> known before. He gave him reasons to dream, visions that could be attained; he
> gave him a sense of belonging, a cause to struggle for. More than anyone else,

Reflections
Alain Locke’s connections to Harvard,
Harlem, and Haifa shaped his roles as
race leader, social philosopher, and Bahá’í
pluralist. As a race leader, he ingeniously
enhanced race pride and race image
through the cultural diplomacy of Afri-
can-American arts. As a social philoso-
pher, he was a race-relations leader, both
then and now, with a concern for national
and international unity. “[T]here is the
possibility,” he said, “of a ³ne collabora-
tion spiritually between these two groups
[African Americans and whites] with their
complementary traits and qualities. They
have great spiritual need, the one of the
other, if they will so see it.”106 About Locke’s
social and spiritual signi³cance, Horace
Kallen said of his lifelong friend and
colleague: “What Booker T. Washington
had been to the Negro and the American
idea in the ³eld of material skills and ALAIN LOCKE
material achievement, Alain Locke was in An undated studio portrait made later in Locke’s

life. Courtesy, Locke Papers, Moorland-Spingarn
the ³eld of the spirit.”107 As a Bahá’í Research Center, Howard University.
pluralist, Locke advocated what he calls
“the salvation of democracy.” He wrote that “Bahá’í Principles and the leavening
of our national life with their power is to be regarded as the salvation of democracy.
In this way only can the ³ne professions of American ideals be realized.”108 In
promoting “racial democracy” as one component of his comprehensive model of
“world democracy”—what he would later refer to as a “new Americanism”—Locke
placed race relations in a global perspective.109

With respect to his Bahá’í identity, Locke chose a prudent course. He could be
a private Bahá’í at a public meeting, or a public Bahá’í at a private meeting, or a
Bahá’í known to the Bahá’ís but not to the rest of his audience, or somewhere in
between. He seems to have felt, considering the time in which he lived, that it was
better to be a circumspect Bahá’í in a position of prestige and in·uence than a vocal
Bahá’í who might command no audience and leave no public legacy. As a public
intellectual, Locke’s position as a race leader and a champion of democracy meant
that he needed to be universal in his ethos. Moreover, he felt that his public persona
and celebrity status depended on his remaining mainstream as one of the nation’s
foremost and most distinguished African Americans. To have come out too publicly

28       World Order, 2005, Vol. 36, No. 3

and too forthrightly as a Bahá’í would surely have a²ected his career adversely and
his position as a professor of philosophy at Howard University. Yet his entire adult
life bore eloquent witness to his tireless promotion of universal Bahá’í ideals. In the
twilight of his life, Ebony magazine, for a short time, thrust him into the national
limelight as a Bahá’í when it published an article about the Bahá’í Faith that
prominently featured his photograph.

Concurrently or singly, Locke thus ful³lled three distinct but overlapping roles.

As a race leader, a social philosopher, and a Bahá’í pluralist, Locke promoted racial
nationalism, cultural pluralism, and Bahá’í universalism. What is remarkable is how
adroitly he connects values with social issues. Equally remarkable is how he inter-
nationalizes the problem of race relations. With power and clarity, Locke has
synergized faith and philosophy to generate a secular perspective that universalizes
the Bahá’í social ideals of racial harmony and world unity.

7. Jim Crow laws, named after a pre-Civil War minstrel-show character, were late nineteenth-century
statutes passed by U.S. Southern (and other) states that created an American apartheid. Although
slavery had been abolished in 1863, in 1883 the Supreme Court declared the Civil Rights Act of 1875
unconstitutional, re·ecting the widespread white-supremacist attitudes of the day and e²ectively de-
molishing the foundations of post-Civil War Reconstruction. In 1896 the high court promulgated the
“separate but equal doctrine” in Plessy v. Ferguson, leading to a profusion of Jim Crow laws. By 1914,
every Southern state had established two separate societies—one white, one “colored.” Segregation was
enforced by the creation of separate facilities in virtually every sector of civil society—in schools,
streetcars, restaurants, health-care institutions, and cemeteries. In 1954 this racial caste system was
successfully challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka,
Kansas, which declared segregation in the public schools unconstitutional. The Jim Crow system was
³nally dismantled by civil-rights legislation enacted between 1964 and 1968. See Michael J. Klarman,

30. “Cultural pluralism” is the precursor of “multiculturalism,” which ³rst gained currency in the
1970s. Locke and Kallen, quoted in Sollors, “Critique of Pure Pluralism,” in Reconstructing American
Literary History 269, quoted in Posnock, Color and Culture 192. Elsewhere, however, Kallen places this
conversation at Harvard, rather than at Oxford: “As an expression in the American language ‘cultural
pluralism’ is about 50 years old. I used it ³rst around 1906 or 1907 when Alain Locke was in a section of
a class at Harvard where I served as assistant to Mr. George Santayana” (Horace M. Kallen, “Alain Locke
and Cultural Pluralism,” Journal of Philosophy 54 [Feb. 28, 1957] 119). Yet it was not until 1924 that
Kallen ³rst used the term in print, where his de³nition appears to be historical rather than prescriptive:
“The standpoint of these essays can be described brie·y as Cultural Pluralism. The outcome of the
observation they embody is the view that democracy is an essential prerequisite to culture, that culture
can be and sometimes is a ³ne ·owering of democracy, and that the history of the relation of the two in
the United States exhibits this fact” (Horace M. Kallen, Culture and Democracy in the United States [New
York: Boni and Liveright, 1924, reprinted, New Brunswick, NJ, USA: Transaction, 1977] 11). Hence,
while Kallen gets the credit for coining “cultural pluralism,” it was Locke who e²ectively democratized
the concept. In social fact, Locke’s notion of cultural pluralism was far more socially integrated than
Kallen’s paradigm of hyphenated identity, which can all too easily degenerate into ethnic ghettoism.
Locke’s social philosophy was arguably a greater formative in·uence in shaping the present-day notion
of multiculturalism than Kallen’s. For Locke, cultural pluralism was essentially an expansion of demo-
cracy, extending its egalitarian principles from individual rights to group rights.

Gregory and the Advancement of Racial Unity in America (Wilmette, IL, USA: Bahá’í Publishing Trust,
1982) 205 (“Table. Information about 99 black respondents among 1,1813 Bahá’ís surveyed, 1935–c.
1937, from Bahá’í Historical Record Cards in the National Bahá’í Archives, Wilmette, Illinois”), is
based on the personal data Locke provided on his Bahá’í Historical Record Card. But, since Morrison
was not researching Locke for her book, she did not point out the signi³cance for Locke studies of
Locke’s giving 1918 as the date on which he accepted the Bahá’í Faith.

57. As a spiritual obligation, Bahá’ís are strongly encouraged, ³nances permitting, to undertake a
pilgrimage to Bahá’í holy places (principally clustered in and around Haifa and Acre, Israel) at least once
in their lives. American Bahá’ís began making pilgrimages in 1898.

68. The term “Talented Tenth” was coined in 1896 by the Rev. Henry L. Morehouse, who
envisioned a class of erudite and upright African Americans emerging as a vanguard for the Black
community. The Talented Tenth was seen as the collective agent for social change. Du Bois gave the
theory prominence in 1903 when he published his classic manifesto “The Talented Tenth.” The theory
was simple yet profound: Cultivate the talents of the best and brightest African Americans, and they
will advance the interests of all black Americans. At the other end of the social spectrum was the
“submerged tenth”—an underclass of “criminals, prostitutes and loafers.” Later in life he re³ned his
theory. In August 1948 Du Bois delivered his “The Talented Tenth Memorial Address” at Wilberforce
University, in which he spoke of the “Guiding Hundredth,” which was his “new idea for a Talented
Tenth.” Locke basically supported this elitist theory of social betterment. See Locke, “The Role of the
Talented Tenth,” Howard University Record 12.7 (Dec. 1918): 15–18; and Buck, “Talented Tenth,”
Encyclopedia of African American History. See also Alain Locke, “Art or Propaganda?” Harlem 1 (Nov.
1928): 12—13, and Richard Keaveny, “Aesthetics and the Issue of Identity,” in Critical Pragmatism of

“Negro Youth Speaks,” in New Negro 47–53.

77. Locke, letter to Shoghi E²endi, undated (postmarked June 11, 1930), in Research Department,
Bahá’í World Centre, Memorandum to The Universal House of Justice, Dec. 26, 2001. A hendiadys
(“one by means of two”), also known as a “³gure of twinnes,” is the expression of an idea by the use of
two independent words connected by “and” (nice and warm) instead of a combination of an indepen-
dent word and its modi³er (nicely warm). See Gideon Burton, “Silva Rhetoricae” <http://
humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/H/hendiadys.htm>, and George Puttenham, The Arte of English
Poesie (1589) 148, q.v. “Endiadis, or the Figure of Twinnes” <http://eir.library.utoronto.ca/rpo/display/
displayrpose.cfm?prosenum=17&sub³le=puttenham_artofp_3.html>. In the Kitáb-i-Íqán, Bahá’u’lláh
typically constructs a doublet of one Arabic term and its Persian equivalent, resulting in a correspond-
ing hendiadys in Shoghi E²endi’s literal translation of each occurrence of twinned terms. Not knowing
Persian and Arabic, Locke would not have known this.

The Moon Maiden

White and lovely, still and wan,
She huddled and brooded as a swan.
A love-sick swan that hath her pool forsaken
For love of the moon, sore overtaken
With grief and madness for her chosen one.

A broken lyre with its broken strings
Lay there beside her, yet surely no one sings
Whose eyes are red with weeping, cheeks a·ame
With the conquering glow of lofty shame
That hopeless love and longing brings.

Yet though she grieved, she was so fair
With her blossoming cheeks and moonlit hair,
That had she fallen from the moon
She could not seem a greater, sweeter boon
Than she presented to me—standing there.

She glowed and looked afar, and then she smiled,—
Helpless, enraptured like an awestruck child
I sank before her. Did I swoon?
I only know that very, very soon
I was myself no longer, thus beguiled.

She beckoned. I followed at her will
To a place all gold and white, but deathly still
I had never seen the like before
A crystal palace with a magic door
With golden hinges and a silver sill.

Again I must have swooned, and from my side
The maiden must have ·ed, for someone cried,
He awakens, and I did awake.
Quick fevered and thirsting for her beauty’s sake,
So sad it was to waken, I had rather died.

ALAIN LOCKE, better known as the ³rst African-American Rhodes Scholar, the “Dean” of
the Harlem Renaissance, and a Bahá’í race-amity leader, was also a poet. “The Moon Maiden,”
which has never been published, is here transcribed (with editorial discretion in establishing the
text) from Locke’s handwritten manuscript. It is, according to World Order’s poetry editor, “a
³ne early twentieth-century poem,” “very graceful” and stemming “from a time when poetry
was very formal.” The poem is reprinted by permission from the Locke Papers/Moorland-Spingarn

Alain Locke in His Own Words: Three Essays

> Reading about the extraordinary life of Alain Locke provides one kind of
> introduction to an important twentieth-century philosopher, a race-unity leader,
> and the father of the Harlem Renaissance. Reading Locke’s own words provides

—THE EDITORS

> ALAIN LOCKE: THE GOSPEL FOR THE TWENTIETH CENTURY1
> “The Gospel for the Twentieth Century” (an untitled essay) dispels any doubts about
> the depth of Alain Locke’s convictions as a Bahá’í. In the opening sentence Locke de³nes
> the “gospel for the Twentieth Century” as the Bahá’í spiritual and practical principles
> needed to realize the unity of humankind. The Bahá’í content, for the most part, is
> indirect, showing the intuitive depth of Locke’s understanding of the Bahá’í scriptures
> and his ability to correlate them with his philosophical training. It is possible that Locke
> developed his concept of spiritual democracy, one of a number of iterations of democ-
racy that he explores in his published and unpublished works, from the Bahá’í scriptures.

Archival ³les give no hints about why Locke wrote the article. Three pieces of internal
> evidence suggest that it may tentatively be dated between 1923 and 1925. Locke refers
> to the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Maria Holzapfel, whose book Panideal appeared
> in 1923, and he quotes a passage from Bahá’u’lláh, the Founder of the Bahá’í Faith,
> included in John E. Esslemont’s Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era, also published in 1923.
> Less conclusive is a reference to “the New Negro.” Locke used the phrase as the title of
> his celebrated anthology The New Negro, published in November 1925. However, in
> 1900 Booker T. Washington and three colleagues also used the phrase in the title of their
book A New Negro for a New Century.
The essay showcases the clarity and lucidity of Locke’s prose in general.

ALAIN LOCKE IN HIS OWN WORDS

clashing ominous [n?]est of issues of the practical world of today, the issues of race,
sect, class and nationality, all have one basic spiritual origin, and for that reason,
we hope and believe one basic cure. Too long have we tried to patch these issues
up and balm them over; [sic] instead of going to the heart and seat of the trouble
in the limited and limiting conceptions of humanity which are alone, like a poi-
sonous virus circulating through our whole social system, responsible for them. A
change of condition will not remedy or more than temporarily ameliorate our chronic
social antagonisms; only a widespread almost universal change of social heart, a new
spirit of human attitudes, can achieve the social redemption that must eventually
come. The ³nest and most practical idea of Christianity, the idea of the millenium
[sic], of peace on earth, has been allowed to lapse as an illusion of the primitive
Christian mind, as a mystic’s mirage of another world. And as a consequence the
Brotherhood of Man, taken as a negligible corollary of the fatherhood of God, has
if anything in practical e²ect put the truth of its own basic proposition to doubtful
uncertainty. The redemption of society, social salvation, should have been sought
after ³rst, the pragmatic test and proof of the fatherhood of God is afterall [sic]
whether belief in it can realize the unity of mankind; and so the brotherhood of
man, as it has been inspirationally expressed, the “oneness of humanity,” must be
in our day realized or religion die out gradually into ever-increasing materiality. The
salvation we have sought after as individuals in an after-life and another sphere must
be striven for as the practical peace and unity of the human family here in this
[world]. In some very vital respects God will be rediscovered to our age if we succeed
in discovering the common denominator of humanity and living in terms of it and
valuing all things in accordance with it.

The world has not yet sounded the depths and realized the profundities of its
most moving contemporary ideal, or sensed the challenge of its most popular slogan.
Much has been accomplished in the name of Democracy, but Spiritual Democracy,
its largest and most inner meaning, is so below our common horizons. Only a few
from the elevation of some jutting human problem see it, and they too often as
through a tragic rift through which it appears more the solution of their particular
issue, the light for their particular valley than as the sun of a new universal day for
humanity at large. America, that has in an economic and material way labored
through to the most promising material elements of democracy, is spiritually very
far from the realization of her own organic [i]deal. One would despair except for
the knowledge from history that the solutions come out of the crater pots of the
deepest and most seething problems.

> The fundamental problems of current America are materiality and prejudice.

They seem to rise out of separate positions, but their common base is sel³shness.

They rest primarily not upon the economic and historical conditions in terms of
which they are so often explained and discussed, but upon false human values, a
blind ness [sic] of heart, an obstruction of social vision. And so we must say with
the acute actualities of America’s race problem and the acute potentialities of her
economic problem, the land that is nearest to material democracy is furthest away
from spiritual democracy, unless, as we have said, the heart of the solution is to
come out of the crux of the problem.

ALAIN LOCKE IN HIS OWN WORDS

Perhaps this is so. Practical philanthropy is welling up in rapidly increasing volume
out of the heart of the capitalist system; and even before the class issues have begun
perceptably [sic] to ameliorate, we witness at last a favorable trend to the most crucial
of all the American issues, the strained relations of the race question. New and
promising e²orts of race cooperation and help have sprung up within the last decade
from the very section where the issues are most acute; of course the Old South still
lingers both as an unfortunate social condition and state of mind. But essentially
a New South is breaking through; and it is interesting to note not in terms of the
old notion of help but of the new discovery of common interests, in other words
in terms of cooperation. The inter-racial commissions spreading their work of
common council through the better and more representative elements of the two
races in the South, the new movement for the equalisation [sic] of public school
expenditures, health and public welfare measures and activities that has signi³cantly
but only recently begun, the challenge of the great industrial migration of the Negro
away from the South,2 which has led to ameliorative measures to retain this eco-
nomically valuable but hitherto socially mis-valued group, and the increasing self-
esteem and direction of the New Negro himself which though it has, like the
assertive rise of suppressed minorities the world over today, the potentialities of clash
and rivalry and increasing sectarianism, holds nevertheless with the right social
attitude toward it the possibilities of ³ner mutual respect and reciprocity; all these
are hopeful signs out of a spiritually dark and threatening situation.

I have often thought that one of the great obstacles that has prevented the world
from realizing unity was the notion, especially characteristic of the West, that to
be one e²ectively we must all be alike, and that to be at peace we must all have
the same interests. But the increasing breaking-up of Western society may not be
the debacle of civilization which the Occidental materialistic uniformitarians have
imagined it to be, but rather the preparatory step that will force us to abandon this
false idea and adopt the true one, not of uniformity, but reciprocity, not of an
outward union of bodies and cultures, but of social heart and feeling. Once we rid
ourselves of the proprietary notion of civilization, we enter upon an era of spiritual
reciprocity.

This, I take it, is from the intellectual point of view the one great new idea and
ideal to be added in our day to our science and wrought into our practice of
education. Segments of it come from many quarters; none more promising, to
mention one signi³cant light, it seems than the philosophy of the Austrian Holzapfel,
with its professed basic principle of the “Pan-Ideal”, where universal values, the point
of view of all mankind is to be substituted for the narrowing and hopelessly
con·icting scales of value that race, class, nation and sect have made almost chronic
defects in our thinking.

ALAIN LOCKE IN HIS OWN WORDS

We must begin working out the new era courageously, but it must be a revolution
within the soul. How many external wars and revolutions it will make unnecessary,
if it is only possible! And we must begin heroically with the great apparent irreconcilables;
the East and the West, the black man and the self-arrogating Anglo-Saxon, for unless
these are reconciled, the salvation of society in this world cannot be. If the world
had believingly understood the full signi³cance of Him who taught it to pray and
hope “Thy Kingdom come on earth as it is in Heaven” who also said “In my Father’s
house are many mansions”, already we should be further toward the realization of
this great millenial [sic] vision. The word of God is still insistent, and more emphatic
as the human redemption delays and becomes more crucial, and we have what Dr.
Elsemont [Esslemont] rightly calls Baha’u’llah’s “one great trumpet-call to human-
ity”: “That all nations shall become one in faith, and all men as brothers; that the
bonds of a²ection and unity between the sons of men should be strengthened; that
diversity of religion should cease, and di²erences of race be annulled . . . These
strifes and this bloodshed and discord must cease, and all men be as one kindred
and family.[”]

Certainly the only peace an intelligent and loyal Negro can contemplate in the
situation of racial inequality and con·ict in the Southern United States is a peace
with justice, which in the long or short run must involve a radical revision of the
status quo. It would seem that also any far-sighted patriot or liberal cosmopolitan
would have complete agreement with this principle, not only from the idealistic
point of view of justice and consistency with professed democratic principles, but
from the pragmatic position that in no other way can the increasing demands of
the aggrieved minority be settled. In the so-called Black Belt, which is about 60
percent of the Southern area, the Negro population is only a numerical minority
by a small margin, and in certain speci³c areas is really a majority in numbers[,]
though not in economic resources or political power.5 The one thing to be agreed
upon by all schools of thought on the subject is, therefore, that a solution within
the status quo is out of the question. For that status quo rests upon political
disenfranchisement, economic exploitation, arbitrarily and legally de³ned bi-racial
life in separate schools, public conveyances, churches and other institutional orga-
nizations, and a social stigma of “inferiority” to bolster the social policy of “white
supremacy”.6 To observers not familiar with the situation in detail[,] it might be
graphically described as an internal colonial status, an ingrowing imperialism based
on color caste.

What then can we mean by talking of peace, if we go beyond mere pious aspir-
ations and unrealistic hopes? I think the ³rst realization of any practical importance
is the reckoning, unusual in the framework of traditional race prejudice, that the
white man and his civilization su²er greatly from the repression of the black
minority. If, as is coming to be increasingly recognized, the low standard of living,
the economic backwardness of the South and the retardation of progressive social
progress in this region are direct results and general consequences of Southern social,
economic and political policies based largely on the racial situation, the motives and

6. Locke is referring to late nineteenth-century statutes (known as Jim-Crow laws, named after a pre-

Ferguson, leading to a profusion of such laws. By 1914 every Southern state had established two separate
societies—one white, one “colored.”—Ed.

the reasons for social reconstruction become the common interest and involve the
common welfare of white and black alike.7 Against the partisan traditions of gen-
erations, this realization is rapidly coming to the fore in the progressive thinking
of the South. It is still a minority opinion, but it holds no doubt the one hope for
the future that might possibly avert race con·ict of serious proportions in the next
generation or half-generation. When President Roosevelt characterized the South,
as he recently did, as the “Nation’s No. 1 economic problem”, he was proposing
in a statesmanlike way a common denominator for social reconstruction. The earlier
“Reconstruction”[—]as it was called after the emancipation of the slaves[—]brought
neither real social reform nor social peace. It was pivoted on racial factionalism,
national sectionalism[,] with hatreds and prejudices between the North and the
South which had been the alignment of the Civil War, and the reconciliation of
these factors since 1900 over the new industrialization of the South was entirely at
the expense of the Negro’s interests and the political and economic rights of both
the Negroes and the poor whites. They eventually found themselves jointly involved
in a wage slavery as unskilled mill and factory labor or an agrarian serfdom as tenant
farmers or sharecroppers.

The contemporary sharecropper’s [sic ] revolt in the Southern Tenant Farmers’
Union, and the trends toward labor organization of the semi-skilled and uns[k]illed
workers, who include many Negroes, and the potentialities of political realignment
breaking the old-line Democratic closed primary, which was the chief mechanism
of Negro disenfranchisement[,] all point to issues of crucial and perhaps revolu-
tionary reform.8 But as involving a new division between progressives and conser-
vatives rather than on purely race lines[,] they forecast a lessening of the tension
along purely racial lines and the possible averting of mass race con·ict. Struggle there
will be in either case, but if the common interests of the common man, black and
white, become the pivot of reform e²ort, a progressive rather than a revolutionary
movement can be anticipated. In many instances, notably in the organization of
black and white workers together especially in the farmer-tenant unions, this solvent
of common interest has proved e²ective to overcome the traditional prejudice of
race.

In another country an analysis of this sort would really mean just a forecast of
class war taking the place of race war, but in America economic reconstruction is
already far enough along and has su¹cient mass momentum to warrant our thinking
of its extension without the necessity of revolution. If the cause of the Negro masses
can be hitched to this forward social movement[,] there is hope. The younger Negro

7. Called by W. E. B. Du Bois, an African-American socioloigist and civil-rights leader, “a glorious
failure,” Reconstruction (1865–77) granted civil rights and equalities to Southern blacks. But these
were systematically eroded by the courts, Southern white resistance, corrupt Northern “carpetbaggers,”
and Southern “scalawag” Reconstructionist administrators. Equal rights would not be restored until the
rise of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s—sometimes called the “Second Reconstruction”—
nearly a century later.—Ed.

leadership, aware of this, is striving to harness a rising race consciousness and
growing solidarity of the Negro group to such an alignment rather than the normally
separatist trends of “self-determination” and a policy of political and economic
separatism. The barriers of prejudice cause many eddies of purely racialist feeling,
but the larger vision of the more intelligent sections of Negro opinion is for common
action and progressivism[,] particularly on the political and economic fronts. Culturally
the major trends are still racialist and probably will remain so in this relatively non-
controversial ³eld.

The contemporary Western world is today one of unpredictable potentialities.

Certainly the tendencies of minority causes generally does [sic] not favor a prediction
of a peaceful solution of the American race problem. But the complete acculturation
of the Negro in American life and his lack of political ambitions beyond common
citizenship rights in the traditional framework of the American democracy do argue
for the possibility[,] at least with proper social and economic reform[,] of that peace
with justice of which we spoke. One thing is certain, under the structure of
American life[,] no large-scale improvement of the economic lot of the common
man is possible without proportional inclusion of the mass Negro. A wide di²erential
of living standards or of wage standards, even as wide as the present discrepancies,
will thwart the general progress and jeopardize basic reforms now under way, like
state responsibility for unemployment, social security[,] child labor reforms, wide-
scale unionization of labor, public supervision of health and the like, to which the
public policy in America is already seriously committed. We used to say that
Christianity and democracy were both at stake in the equitable solution of the race
question. They were; but they were abstract ideals that did not bleed when injured.
Now we think with more realistic logic, perhaps, that economic justice cannot stand
on one foot; and economic reconstruction is the dominant demand of the present-
day American scene.

Students of Talladega:

I am loathe to leave Talladega but I must, and before I go I must thank you for
a very stimulating time. I have learned some things and I hope you have.

And now, I should like to talk about something that we all take for granted—
these are things we know least about. The words most frequently used are words
understood least—Democracy is one of those words. Thinking Negroes, of course,
know much about what democracy is not, and have a more workable conception
of what democracy truly means than those who have just enough to be content with
or those to whom it is just a commonplace concept and way of life. Democracy,
of course, is one of the basic human ideals, but as an ideal of human association
it is something quite superior to any outward institution or any particular society;
therefore, not only is government too narrow to express democracy, but government
from time to time must grow to realize democracy.

It may be a little daring in the time we have at our disposal, but let us put on
seven-league boots and trace democracy—one of the great social concepts. Both in
concept and practice democracy began in Greece—in the Greek city[-]state. In its
day it was a great achievement, but in that day democracy was a concept of local
citizenship. Our nearest approach to it is the kind of fellowship we ³nd in college
fraternities and sororities in which the bonds are of “like-mindedness” excluding
others. The rim of the Greek concept of democracy was the barbarian: it was then
merely the principle of fraternity within a narrow, limited circle. There was a dignity
accorded to each member on the basis of membership in the group. It excluded
foreigners, slaves and women. This concept carried over into the Roman empire.

Christianity was responsible for the introduction of the next great revision in the
concept of democracy. We owe to Christianity one of the great basic ideals of
democracy—the ideal of the moral equality of human beings. The Christian ideal
of democracy was in its initial stages more democratic than it subsequently became.
It always held on to the essential ideal of moral equality of man within the limits
of organized Christianity—anybody else was a potential member only as he became
converted. Christianity was thus a crusading ideal in bringing humanity into wider
association. But the Christian church was a political institution and in making
compromises often failed in bringing about real human equality.

The third great step in democracy came from [P]rotestant lands and people who
evolved the ideal of political equality: (1) equality before the law, and (2) political
citizenship. This political democracy pivoted on individualism, and the freedom of
the individual in terms of what we know as the fundamental rights of man. It found
its best expression in the historic formula of “Liberty, equality and fraternity”. In
terms of this ideology our country’s government was founded. But for generations
after[,] many of the fundamentals of our democracy were pious objectives, not fully
expressed in practice. In the perspective of democracy’s long evolution, we must
regard our country’s history as a progressive process of democratization, not yet fully
achieved, but certainly progressing importantly in terms of the [T]hirteenth,
[F]ourteenth and [F]ifteenth amendments, and the amendment extending the right
of franchise to women. It is still imperfect.

The fourth crucial stage in the enlargement of democracy began, I think, with

46     World Order, 2005, Vol. 36, No. 3

the income tax amendment. Woodrow Wilson tried to put into operation an
extension of democracy which may well have been seriously hindered by World War
number one. The income tax amendment was an initial step in social democracy
as distinguished from the purely political,—a step toward economic equality through
the partial expropriation of surplus wealth for the bene³t of the commonwealth.10
In this country for many generations we thought we had economic equality. What
we really had was a frontier expansion which developed such surpluses and o²ered
such practical equality of opportunity as to give us the illusion of economic equality.
We later learned that we did not have economic democracy, and that in order to
have this, we must have guaranteed to all citizens certain minimal standards of living
and the right to earn a living. Faced with the crisis of unemployment, the New Deal
has been confronted with the problem of inaugurating some of these beginnings
of economic democracy and of constitutionally implementing a larger measure of
social justice. The whole program of what is now called [S]ocial [S]ecurity is directed
toward such objectives.

A ³fth phase of democracy, even if the preceding four are realized, still remains
to be achieved in order to have a fully balanced society. The present crisis forces
us to realize that without this also democracy may go into total eclipse. This ³fth
phase is the struggle for cultural democ-
racy, and rests on the concept of the right ONE OF OUR GREATEST PROBLEMS TODAY
of di²erence,—that is, the guarantee of                IS A REAL DEMOCRATIC RECIPROCITY
the rights of minorities. Again in colonial        FOR MINORITIES OF ALL SORTS,

same problems of the freedom of speech,
worship and conscience, but in a complex modern situation these things are even
more di¹cult to work out. One of our greatest problems then today is a real
democratic reciprocity for minorities of all sorts, both as over against the so-called
majority and among themselves. These contemporary problems of democracy can
be vividly sensed if we realize that the race question is at the very heart of this struggle
for cultural democracy. Its solution lies beyond even the realization of political and
economic democracy, although of course that solution can only be reached when
we no longer have extreme political inequality and extreme economic inequality.
Yet there still remains this di²erence. For example, the fact that a man cannot a²ord
to buy a decent house for his family involves the problem of economic inequality;
but, on the other hand, the man who through social prejudice is refused the purchase
of a house though he can a²ord to buy it confronts us with an example of cultural
inequality. So, of course, prejudice as well as economic barriers are obstacles still
in the way of true democratic living. If we look at it in this way we will get something
of a perspective that may give some understanding of what has to be done today

and the task which lies before our country. We should not be so satis³ed with what
little democracy we have that we neglect to enlarge it. Nor is democracy in practice
automatic when its legal basis is established. The vote to women, for example, has
not yet raised the standard in the use of the franchise, for women are not yet used
to voting and bringing pressure to bear.11 A machinery of enlarged participation is
the only way in which that democracy can be set up.

In closing I might say that the two problems of democracy today center ³rst in
the crusade for economic justice—economic equality of opportunity, and, second,
in the equally important crusade for cultural democracy or mutual respect for our
various group di²erences and a working reciprocity among our various minorities.
Both need to be incorporated in a just and tolerant cosmopolitan way of living
together; and that for our time is the crux of this age-old but ever-enlarging struggle
for and toward a truly democratic way of life.
