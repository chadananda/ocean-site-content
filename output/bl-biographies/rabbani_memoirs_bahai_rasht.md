Translator’s Foreword

Rasht is the seat of the Gilan province in the northern Iran occupying
the western half of the south Caspian littoral.

The genesis of the Bábí and Bahá’í Faiths in Rasht dates back to the Bábí
period when apparently a number of its inhabitants embraced the Báb’s
movement. By early 1850s, in the confused state following the Báb’s
martyrdom, the Bábí community fractured and various pockets of the Bábís
turned to different Bábí leaders for inspiration and guidance. It was around
1271 AH [1854] that one of the Rasht’s Bábís, a certain Karbalá’í Ibráhím
Samsár [“dealer of second-hand goods”] Rashtí twice went to Adharbayjan and
met Mírzá Asadu’lláh Dayyán, and became a staunch follower of him, a
sentiment which he shared with other Bábís of the region as well.1 At the
present, not much is known of these Dayyánís and they presumably
disappeared as a group.2

Around 1270 AH [1853], several Bábís migrated from Qazvin to the
nearby Lahijan, which was the major town of Gilan at that time. One of them,
Siyyid Javád, had been a Shaykhí in Qazvin – which had a robust Shaykhí-Bábí
community – and succeeded in converting a number of residents to the Báb’s
Faith. Siyyid Javád however threw his lot with Mírzá Yahyá Azal and tried to
keep his group of Bábís isolated from the other Bábís of Lahijan who had
become followers of Bahá’u’lláh. On an occasion when Siyyid Javád was away
in Qazvín, one of his associates, Mírzá ‘Alí Ashraf (known later as the poet
‘Andalíb), searched out the Bahá’ís and became convinced that Baha’u’llah was
the new Manifestation. Soon Mírzá ‘Alí Ashraf succeeded in converting Siyyid
Javád as well as the others Azalís.3

Some time earlier, Hájí Nasír Qazvíní, a well-known survivor of Shaykh
Tabarsí, and his family had settled in Rasht and commenced trading. Though
several of his family members were Bahá’ís and known in the city as such, no
one from Rasht had embraced the Faith.4 In 1870s in Lahijan, Mírza ‘Alí Ashraf
‘Andalíb was encouraged by the Qazvíní Bahá’ís of that town to migrate to
Rasht where he settled in Saráry Mírzá Bábá and began teaching the Faith.
Soon he was joined by Siyyid Javád Qazvíní, Áqá Muhammad Ismá‘íl and Áqá
Muhammad-Ibráhím Lahíjání, who had been taught by ‘Andalíb, and they
commenced informed the locals of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.

Through these efforts, a number of locals, including the following,
embraced the Cause: Mírzá Mihdí; Mírzá Báqir Bassár and his brothers, Mírzá
‘Alí and Áqá ‘Alí-Asghar and their families; Mullá Yúsuf-‘Alí and his brother,
Áqá Husayn, and their father, Mullá Muhammad5; Karbalá’í Qásim and his
brother, Áqá Ridá Zargar; Áqá Rasúl Qannád [“the confectioner”]; Áqá
Muhammad-Javád; and the Sádát Khams.6 By 1296 AH [1879] there were some

\[5\] Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 6, p. 923, notes that the newly-converted Mullá
Muhammad was 70 years old. In 1295 AH [1878], when the laws of the obligatory prayers
had not been promulgated, he inquired of his religious duties. He was given a collection of
prayers that he was to recite each day after reciting “Alláh’u’Abhá” ninety-five times.

\[6\] The five brothers, known as Sádát Khams – a title bestowed by Bahá’u’lláh – were
merchants and had obtained Russian citizenship with the surname Baqiroff. Two of the
brothers were able to negotiate a contract with the holder of the Imperial concession for the
surfaced road between Anzali and Tehran for the provision of traveler’s services along the
route - rest-houses, food, accommodation, and other necessities. Because of this, they
became very rich. After their conversion, they were to render important services to the Faith
of Bahá’u’lláh, particularly Siyyid Nasru’lláh who lived in Tehran and offered the major share
of the expenses of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s travels in Europe and America. Siyyid Ahmad, son of one
of these brothers, traveled to Europe, attended ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Paris and traveled with him

twenty Bahá’ís in that town and their number continued to gradually increase
and included Mírzá Áqá Hakím [“physician”] and Mírzá Ibráhím Jadíd and
some others. With great caution, they would come together at nights for Bahá’í
meetings.7

A widespread persecution of Bahá’ís erupted in 1300 AH [1882] which
greatly affected Bahá’í communities in several Iranian cities. In Rasht, eleven
Bahá’ís were imprisoned. Hájí Nasír and another believer died in prison.8

Rasht: 1889-1903

By
Mírzá Yahyá ‘Amídu’l-Atibbá Hamadání

Translated by Ahang Rabbani

In the Name of God, the Eternal, the Never-Ending!

Since in accordance with the instructions of Shoghi Effendi Rabbani, the
Guardian of God’s Cause, the friends of God are collecting information on
historical events of the Faith in all cities of Iran, this ephemeral servant, Mírzá
Yahyá ‘Amídu’l-Atibbá Hamadání, who, out of divine grace, for many years has
been under the shadow of this blessed Cause, and has in person witnessed
many events of Rasht, deemed it necessary to write such aspects of the Faith’s
history in this city that I have participated in. I compose these pages as a tribute
and means of remembrance of the righteous friends and undertake this writing
on Safar 1345 AH [August 1926]. I beseech the esteem reader to offer a prayer
of forgiveness and a supplication for divine confirmations upon my soul.

Arrival at Rasht
In 1307 AH [1889], I came to Rasht as a physician. Two other friends, who
were Bahá’ís from Hamadan also, accompanied me as well: Mírzá Áqá-Chí, the
son of Músá; and Mírzá Áqá Ján Ibráhím-Zádih. We arrived in Rasht on
Wednesday, 22 ‘A1 [16 November 1889]10 and took residence in Caravansary
Abú-Tálib, near Masjid Safá, across from Sardár Mansúr’s house.

At the time of our arrival in Rasht, the entire bazaar and all the shops
had been destroyed by fire, except a section of buildings that had remained safe
from fire and was across from the homes of authorities, which belonged to the
exalted Prince Kamran Mírzá, the famous Nayibu’s-Saltanih. After three days,
we met a certain Mírzá Ilyás Kalímí [“the Jew”] Isfahání. He was a dealer of
second-hand goods. Through him, we rented one of the above-mentioned
apartments and took our residence there, so that we would have time to learn

\[10\] Assuming by “‘A 1” the author means Rabí‘u’l-Avval, then according to calendars available
to the present translator, 22 Rabí‘u’l-Avval 1307 AH was on a Saturday.

the ways and customs of the people of Rasht before assuming our previous
professions.

Meeting Other Bahá’ís
After a month’s stay at that location, through the insistence of my travel
companions, we asked the aforementioned Mírzá Ilyás about Bahá’ís in that
area. Confidentially he introduced one of the believers named Áqá Mashhadí
Qásim Zargar [“the jeweler”], the son of Mashhadí Rafí‘ Zargar. With necessary
wisdom and caution, I located him and one early morning went to his shop on
the pretext of asking him to design an ink-vessel for my use. In this way I was
able to meet him in person.

Two days later, I went again and confidentially stated, “I am one of your
spiritual friends [i.e. a Bahá’í] and together with a few other friends have
recently arrived in Rasht. I came previously on the pretext of purchasing an
ink-vessel to meet you.” On hearing this however, a fear and apprehension
overcame him that is truly beyond description.

A week later, I went again to meet him and stated, “I am Jewish.”11 With
this, he gained utmost confidence and showed friendship and trust. Through
my insistence, he named several people and stated that they were among the
wronged friends [i.e. Bahá’ís] who keep their [religious] identity a secret,
emphasizing that meeting them must be done through utmost wisdom. The
friends he introduced included: Áqá Mírzá Áqá Hakím [“physician”], the son of
Dávúd Hakím; Áqá ‘Alí Arbáb Qazvíní, the son of Hájí Nasír the martyr; the
Sádát Khamsih [“the five siyyids”] who were: Áqá Siyyid Ridá, Áqá Siyyid
Mahmúd, Áqá Mír[zá] ‘Alí-Naqí, Áqá Siyyid Asadu’lláh12 known as the Barát-
Báz [“the financier”] and Áqá Siyyid Nasru’lláh.

He gave specific instructions for meeting Áqá Mírzá Áqá Hakím. As
such, one day I inquired of his residence and went to see him on the excuse of
being ill. After six days of associating, through the introduction of the
aforementioned Ustád Qásim Zargar, I expressed fraternity and my convictions
[to the Bahá’í Faith], but with utmost vehemence he refuted [the Faith].

However, I disregarded his heated denial and repudiation and the next
day went to see him. Again, he expressed similar sentiments of denying, but
with utmost affection and warmth, I proved that I was a friend of Áqá Mírzá
Áqá Ján Kalímí Hamadání. Once he had gained complete trust, he flung open
the gates of friendship and companionship.

\[11\] Early Iranian Bahá’ís often continued to identify themselves with their former religions, so
by this statement the author means he is a Bahá’í of Jewish descent.

\[12\] He is the recipient of an important tablet from Bahá’u’lláh known as Lawh Ittihad; text in,
Ad‘iyyah Hadrat Mahbub, Germany 1980, pp. 388-406.

Attending a Bahá’í Meeting
Two weeks later, he stated, “Today, an hour before dusk, come so we can go to
a certain place.” At the appointed hour, together with Áqá Mírzá Áqá Ján, I
went to his house so together we could proceed to the location he had in mind.
On seeing Áqá Mírzá Áqá Ján, he complained, “Only one of you may come
with me as it would not be possible for the two of you to accompany me.” As
such, Áqá Mírzá Áqá Ján returned to his house and with the utmost caution
and prudence, we proceeded to the intended destination. Along the way, at
times he would hide himself under the ‘abá so the passer-bys would not
recognize him or discover our intention. That distinguished personage was
wearing a silk turban known as Khalíl-Khání.

With utmost difficulty and struggles, by dusk we reached our destination,
which was the home of Áqá ‘Alí Arbáb, who was known in those days as ‘Alí
Bábí. It was there that we attained the presence of the honored Hájí Mírzá
Haydar-‘Alí and the esteemed [Shaykh Kázim] Samandar.13 After the customary
embracing and pleasantries, Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí gave an exposition of my
background and services to the gentlemen that were present. After this
introduction, everyone present had gained complete confidence and trust in
me. After tea was served, we spent the entire night, which was during the
spring season, to spiritual discourse and heavenly discussions, which are
beyond words to describe and can only be experienced by those who have
embarked on this divine journey. The whisper of prayers and the chant of
divine verses and the melody of celestial tablets revealed by the Birds of
Paradise enthralled our spirits and enchanted our hearts.

We spent the entire night in the presence of the friends and decided to
meet the following night so our association would be complete. At dawn, when
the light of day had not yet broken, in accordance with wisdom and prudence,
we bid our host farewell. Together with Áqá Mírzá Áqá Tabíb14, I left the
residence and after a while, we each took a separate route, and I followed a
guide to my residence. When I arrived, Áqá Mírzá Áqá Ján inquired of the
previous night’s occurrences and I shared with him all the details.

Four days later, Ustád Qásim Zargar, who was fashioning an ink-vessel
for me, came by with the promised object and stated, “Remain here at your
house until one hour into the night. At that time I will come and meet you and
together we will go to the home of Áqá Siyyid Ridá, who is of the Sadát
Khams.”

\[13\] Balyuzi notes, Samandar “was in Rasht for three months, and held a special class to teach
the Bayán;” Eminent Bahá'ís in the Time of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 212.

\[14\] Tabíb and Hakím are interchangeable, meaning a physician.

During that time, the Mushíru’s-Saltanih, who ruled as the governor on
behalf of the Nayibu’s-Saltanih, was dismissed from office and the exalted
Prince Mu’ayyadu’d-Dawlih, the son of the Hisámu’s-Saltanih – an uncle of
Nasiri’d-Din Shah – had become the governor of Rasht. With that, a little more
security for the Baha’is was afforded. Even though all meetings took place with
great wisdom and prudence, the difficulties and strains that had occurred after
the tragic martyrdom of Hájí Nasír during the governorship of ‘Abdu’lláh Khán
was no longer the case.15

At any rate, according to Ustád Qásim’s promise, it was one hour into
the night when we left for the residence of Áqá Siyyid Ridá. To observe
wisdom, at times we walked together and at other times separately, until
eventually we reached Áqá Siyyid Ridá’s home and on meeting the friends,
utmost joy, bliss and pleasure was attained. After tea, conversation
commenced. Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí instructed the gathering on how we should
interact and converse with public in accordance with the conditions of the
time. At the end, we recited holy verses and chanted prayers. That night was
spent in such a way with our friends. In the morning, we bid each other
farewell and left for our own abode.

Early Teaching Work
During that tense period, I had no fear or trepidation [in teaching the Cause]
and spoke about it with several citizens of Rasht with utmost wisdom, delicacy
and caution. It went thusly until 1309 AH [1892], when I became known as
being associated with this Sacred Faith [i.e. being known as a Bahá’í].

The gentlemen who in secret and without knowledge of each other met
and were engaged in teaching the Cause of God were: Áqá Mashhadí Báqir
‘Attár; Mullá Yusúf Rawdih-Khán; Mashhadí Husayn and his brother Mashhadí
‘Alí ‘Attár; the illustrious Bassár; Mashhadí Ismá‘íl; Áqá ‘Alí Arbáb; Áqá Mírzá
Áqá Hakím; Ustád Qásim Zargar; Áqá Ridá; and Áqá Naqí.

\[15\] Haji Nasir was first a Bábí and fought in Shaykh Tabarsi. He went on to render important
services and his martyrdom is lamented by Bahá’u’lláh: “Previous to these forty years
controversies and conflicts continually prevailed and agitated the servants of God. But since
then, aided by the hosts of wisdom, of utterance, of exhortations and understanding, they
have all seized and taken fast hold of the firm cord of patience and of the shining hem of
fortitude, in such wise that this wronged people endured steadfastly whatever befell them,
and committed everything unto God, and this notwithstanding that in Mazindaran and at
Rasht a great many have been most hideously tormented. Among them was his honor, Hájí
Nasír, who, unquestionably, was a brilliant light that shone forth above the horizon of
resignation. After he had suffered martyrdom, they plucked out his eyes and cut off his nose,
and inflicted on him such indignities that strangers wept and lamented, and secretly raised
funds to support his wife and children.” Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 71-72.

After 1309 AH [1892] when I became known in Rasht as a Bahá’í, due to
harassments of the nayibs and farrashes, who were the main instigators of
absolutism, I changed my residence which was originally across from the
government house to a location behind the church. After being thusly
separately from my beloved friends and being established behind the church in
apartments known as Khajih Arákil Masihí [“the Christian”], I announced the
site of my doctor’s office. Since at that time there were no sign-makers, I wrote
my name and title on a cardboard, hung it over the door and began practicing
medicine. During leisure times, I would associate with my spiritual friends and
the teachers of God’s Cause, and at times, I would take seekers to teaching
gatherings [i.e. firesides] or invite the seekers to my home.

Some time later, a number of the ‘ulamá of Rasht, who expressed
goodwill towards me but were harboring doubts as to whether I was a Jew or a
Muslim, invited me one day to profess my faith in Islam in order to gain
assurance about my convictions. I proved the validity of Islam in such way and
depth that no reservation remained for anyone.

The government at time [in Rasht] was with the exalted Prince the
Mu’ayyadu’d-Dawlih. He severely punished a number of ruffians and
troublemakers who were harassing the population of Rasht and would cause
difficulties for the friends of God as well. As such, the people were thoroughly
relieved and pleased. In every regard, the governor was considered towards the
people and their needs, particularly towards the much-wronged Bahá’í
community. Because of this attention by the just governor, the friends who
were under some strain and were harassed, gained some measure of ease and
tranquility. The teachers of the Cause were engaged, day and night, in spread of
the Faith and the diffusion of the divine fragrance. And due to my profession, I
was able to associate with certain prominent citizens and develop friendships
and after gaining confidence, would introduce them to the honored Bassár, the
teacher of God’s Cause. In proceeded along these lines until 1310 AH [1893].

Prominent Friends
After some time, I befriended one of the eminent authorities of Rasht,
brigadier-general Nusratu’lláh Tálish who was in charge of the garrison
protecting Anzalí boarder [with Russia]. He invited me to his estate situated at
Kirkán-Rúd, some four days’ journey from Rasht. At the same time that we
were departing, my spiritual friends [i.e. Baha’is] Áqá Mírzá Áqá-Chí also left
for Tabriz and Áqá Mírzá Áqá Ján for Anzalí.

I was in my office one day when a distinguished man entered and after
the customary pleasantries, he introduced himself. He was Hájí Mírzá
Muhammad-Husayn Shírází Barát-Báz [“the financier”], the Amínu’s-Sarih, and
was one of the partners of Hájí Amínu’l-Darb in Tehran. After some

exchanges, he stated that he wished to stay in Rasht and asked me to rent him a
suitable building for this purpose. He advanced some funds for this purpose as
well.

After three days, I found him a house that belonged to the deputy-chief
of the tribes around Rasht. He took his residence there. That distinguished
personage asked me to transfer my residence to one of the rooms of that house
so we could be together. In course of our association, it became clear that he
was a prominent merchant of Shiraz and was a Bahá’í. However, he observed
utmost caution and only in secret would meet with other Baha’is.

After my two spiritual friends [with whom I shared residence] had left
each for Tabriz and Anzalí, I was alone. Therefore, I sent a telegraph to
Hamadan requesting my brother, Mírzá Nabí, to come. He arrived three weeks
later and joined my practice of medicine.

Three months later, I left with brigadier-general Nusratu’lláh Khán for
his native town of Talish. My brother was entrusted to Áqá Mírzá
[Muhammad-]Husayn Amínu’s-Sarih. For five or six months, I was in Talish
sightseeing or engaged in practice of medicine.

I then returned to Rasht since the Cause was growing with the utmost
vigor there. With great enthusiasm and spirit, I embarked on propagating the
Faith and two individuals enrolled under the banner of the Cause. One was
Áqá Hasan, who was known as Arbáb Idárih-Chí Tihrání, and the other was
Áqá Muhammad-Ridá, the brother of Mashhadí Qásim Zargar.

Dervish Qalandar
In 1312 AH [1894], I left for Hamadan to renew ties of kinship and friendships
of the past. I was there for two months when a telegram was received from
brigadier-general Nusratu’lláh Khán inviting me to Talish. As I embarked on
preparation for the journey, I encounter a certain Hájí Qalandar Dervish who
was engaged in teaching the divine Cause. We became friends and when he had
completed his services to the Faith in Hamadan, he decided to leave for the
Holy Land by way of Rasht and Russia. Three days later, Dervish left and I left
shortly thereafter.

On the third day of journey, I arrived by dusk time at a Caravansary in
Ávih and once again saw Hájí Ghulám-Husayn Dervish, known as Hájí
Qalandar. After staying for one night in Ávih, together we left for Rasht. He
stayed for forty days at my house, which was behind the church. He wished to
rent a residence so he could stay longer in Rasht to serve the Cause of God and
his own profession. The house that was rented for this purpose was behind the
government house and belonged to Muhammad Khán, the governor’s
chamberlain. I too transferred my residence there. I resumed my practice of
medicine and Hájí Qalandar took a position in bazaar in the shop of Áqá Siyyid

Ridá Pútín-Dúz [“the boot-maker”] as an engraver. We were together for two
years.

On occasions, Hájí Qalandar, would recount the history of His Holiness
the Primal Point’s [i.e. the Báb’s] appearance from the beginning until the end
of the incident of martyrdoms of many of martyrs in Shiraz. He would talk
about the appearance [of the Báb], the conversion of Hájí [sic] Mullá
Muhammad-Husayn, the Bábu’l-Báb, until the departure of His Holiness the
Primal Point [the Báb] for Mecca.

Hájí Qalandar had studied medicine several times during his sojourn in
India, which had lasted 32 years and was spent in association with the ascetics.
He would teach his knowledge of medicine to my brother and I.

In short, I became thoroughly known throughout Rasht at that time. For
several reasons, Hájí Qalandar grew weary of his stay in Rasht and decided to
visit the Holy Land and pay homage to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. For this purpose, he left
Rasht for Badkubih.

Varqá and Ruhú’lláh
After Hájí Qalandar’s departure, in 1314 AH [1896] I changed my residence
and moved to a house belonging to the late Najaf-Qulí Áqá in the Hasan-Ábád
neighborhood. Early in my stay in the new residence, the illustrious teacher of
the Cause, Varqá, and his esteemed sons, Mírzá ‘Azízu’lláh and Rúhu’lláh –
who was in name Rúhu’lláh and in essence truly Rúhu’lláh16 – came to Rasht
from the Holy Land and from the presence of our divine Beloved. They
enkindled and enthralled everyone with the spirit of faith.

They spent their first night of stay in the home of Mírzá Murtidá-Qulí
Massáh17. The second night was spent at Áqá ‘Alí Arbáb’s house, and the third
night at the residence of this ephemeral servant, where the chant of prayers by
Rúhu’lláh enchanted and mesmerized every hearing soul. All the believers were
at their presence all three nights and immensely enjoyed their sweet and
awakened discourse.

Thereafter, they left for Zanjan where they stayed a while with Varqá’s
father-in-law, the honored Hájí Mírzá ‘Abdu’lláh. After some time though, the
fire of tribulations and persecutions raged in Zanjan and the enemies learned of
their stay and informed the governor of Zanjan. As a result, Varqá, Rúhu’lláh
and two other believers, namely, Hájí Imán and Áqá Mírzá Husayn were seized
and with tied hands and feet sent to Tehran.

Upon arrival in Tehran, the Sipahsálár, who later was titled the Atábak-
‘Azam, instructed these wronged ones to be imprisoned in the dungeon. After

they were in captivity for some time, the incident of assassination of Nasiri’d-
Dín Shah by the hand of Mírzá Ridá Kirmání in [the Shrine of] Sháh ‘Abdu’l-
‘Azím took place in 1314 AH [1896]. Pursuant to this, those two distinguished
personages, namely, Varqá and Rúhu’lláh, were brought out of dungeon and
made to drink from the cup of self-renunciation – and thus they hastened to
the Supreme Concourse and the Abhá Horizon.

Bahá’í Teachers in Rasht
In that same year, a number of teachers and propagators of the divine Cause
arrived in Rasht. They included: Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí; [Shaykh Kázim]
Samandar; Hájí Ghulám-Husayn Dervish Hamadání known as Dervish
Qalandar; Áqá Mírzá Ahmad Qazvíní; Áqá Ibn-Asdaq; Hájí Amín; and Áqá
Muhammad-‘Alí Khán Bahá’í. These were some of the sacred souls that came
to Rasht.

After 1314 AH [1896], the illustrious Ibn-Abhar came to Rasht and took
his residence in the home of Áqá ‘Alí Arbáb Qazvíní. All believers would come
and attain his presence and were overjoyed with his discourse.

First Spiritual Assembly in Rasht
A few days later, he invited the friends to elect the first consultative assembly,
which is known as the Spiritual Assembly. The believers, with utmost joy and
unity, participated in the election and chose the membership of the Spiritual
Assembly.

It was in that gathering that we learned Jamál [Burújirdí] had arrived in
Rasht and had taken his residence in the abode of Muhammad-‘Alí Qahvih-
Chí. The latter was one of the Bahá’ís and had a teahouse across from Siyyid
Abú-Ja‘far and his house was close to the office of Hájí Amínu’l-Darb. It was
agreed that several of the friends would ensure that he [Burújirdí] did not
associate with any of the friends. In those days, a certain Mihdí Káshí, who was
an engraver, was secretly in contact and aligned with Burújirdí. In short, after a
few days, we heard that Burújirdí had departed from Rasht.

Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí’s Visit
In 1319 AH [1901], the nightingale of divine orchard, Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí,
arrived in Rasht from Tehran on his way to the Holy Land.18 He took his abode
in the home of Áqá ‘Alí Arbáb Nasíroff.

\[18\] With the development transportation infrastructure in Russian territory, the ship from
Rasht to Baku became a common route for Bahá’í pilgrims to ‘Akká. Often prominent
Bahá’í figures traveled through Rasht and would stay there for some time.

Back in 1314 AH [1896], I had briefly discussed this mighty Cause with a
certain Muhammad-‘Alí Khán, the Mafákhiru’l-Mulk, who was from Isfahan.
However, we had agreed that whenever one of the accomplished teachers of
the Cause arrived, he would be introduced to him so a more thorough
conversation could take place. Therefore, at this time I informed the
Mafákhiru’l-Mulk and he met Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí in my home and for three
days and nights they held discussions. At the end, he was won over to the
Cause and drank his fill from the cup of certitude. He was so attracted and
enkindled that it remains indescribable.

The Mafákhir was a cotton merchant and entered into an agreement
with Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí to trade this commodity in the course of that year
and to split the profits, with the Hájí’s share being sent to the Holy Land. Their
discussions ended on that note.

In those days, a certain Siyyid ‘Abdu’l-Karím, who was from Kashan,
together with his family and kinfolks, arrived in Rasht. They took their
residence in my house. I commenced close association and friendship with him
and after some discussions about the Cause, he accepted the Bahá’í Faith.

One day, the Mafákhir gave his consent that the Siyyid [‘Abdu’l-Karím]
could come each day on behalf of Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí and examine the
merchant books. Siyyid Káshí [‘Abdu’l-Karím] remained true to his
commitment. Muhammad-‘Alí Khán Mafákhir, on the other hand, after some
trades amassed a considerable profit but did not fulfill his pledge and
consequently, God dealt with him justly too.

However, from the day of his belief until 1335 AH [1916], he
accumulated a vast fortune in Rasht and occasionally would render a service to
the Faith. Alas, that while confirmations was his lot when he became a believer,
disappoint was his fate when he left.

Bahá’í Teachers
After Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí had departed to attain the presence of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá in the Holy Land, the honored Bassár commenced teaching the Cause.
The names of teachers who would come to Rasht or resided in that town are
mentioned: Hájí Amín; Ibn-Asdaq, the Shahíd ibn Shahíd19; Áqá Mírzá Mihdí
Akhaván-Safá; Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím Khán, titled the Ibtiháju’l-Mulk; Ghulám-
‘Alí Khán, titled the Mudabbiru’l-Mamálik; Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí Khán
Tihrání; and Áqá Mírzá Áqá Hakím, the Sárimu’l-Atibbá.

Sympathetic Governor

\[19\] Lit, martyr son of martyr. Mullá Muqaddas Khurasaní was granted the station of martyr, as
was his son, without either one dying a martyr’s death.

At that time, the governor of Rasht was [Muhammad-Valí Khán] Amír-
Tunukábuní, the Nasru’s-Saltanih20, who later was given the rank of Sipah-Dár
[lieutenant general]. Because of the governor’s care, compassion, and concern,
the divine friends had become exceptionally enkindled and enflamed, exceeding
each other in activities and service to the Cause. The esteemed governor, who
was attracted to the Faith, was particularly protective of the believers. At all
times, reports of Bahá’í activities was presented to him and the believers, with
great audacity and without the need for dissimulation21, would undertake their
activities. The illustrious Sipah-Dár, too, would carefully conceal and protect
the community.

Teaching Christians
During that period, a Christian priest by the name of Monsieur Marcar, who
was of the Protestant denomination, accepted this mighty Cause, would
frequent the gatherings of the friends and with utmost vigor and enthusiasm
was teaching the God’s Faith. At the same time, Monsieur Schuler, a Protestant
priest who was a missionary from the United States to Iran, arrived in Rasht.
After a while, Monsieur Marcar befriended him and spoke to him of the Cause.
Further, Monsieur Marcar asked the Spiritual Assembly, “If you deem it
appropriate, a special gathering should be organized and Monsieur Schuler be
invited so a thorough discussion of the Faith can be undertaken.” On behalf of
the Assembly, the Ibtiháju’l-Mulk came to me and stated, “This gathering will
be in your house.”

On the night of 17 Rabí‘u’th-Thání 1318 AH [14 August 1900], about 28

of the Christians along with Monsieur Schuler came to my residence and
several teachers of the Faith were present as well.

\[20\] Muhammad-Valí Khán, the Nasru’s-Saltanih (who later received titles of Sipahdar A‘zam
and Sipahsalar A‘zam), was a native of Tunukabun in province of Mazandaran. For some
time he was the governor of Tunukabun and in 1885 became Brigadier-General. He received
the title the Nasru’s-Saltanih in 1887. After several other posts, he became governor of Rasht
in 1899, a post that he held for 4 years and 4 months until his dismissal. He later achieved
prominence as a leader of the Constitutional Movement. In February 1909, he was the leader
of the Nationalist forces, as they took the town of Rasht. He headed the march on Tehran,
entering it in July 1909 and thus forcing Muhammad-‘Alí Shah’s abdication. In the new
regime, he served several times as Prime Minister until his death in January 1926 in Tehran.
The French diplomat A.L.M. Nicolas reports that in his meeting with him in 1912, the
Nasru’s-Saltanih was very sympathetic to the Báb’s movement; (The Bábí and Bahá’í
Religions, p. 534). The Nasru’s-Saltanih met ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in 1913 in Paris.

\[21\] The original term, hikmat, is often translated as wisdom. In context of many primary
historical source documents of the Bábí and early Bahá’í period it refers to dissimulation of
one’s faith as means of self-preservation.

At first, Áqá Mírzá Muhammad Khán Bahá’í spoke. Afterwards, using
the Holy Bible, Monsieur Marcar produced proofs, evidences and arguments in
support of this Revelation. Observing that the evidences presented had
completely defeated him, with great vehemence and fervor, Monsieur Schuler
rose and protested, “I must go home and bring another Bible,” when a Bible
was already available at the meeting. When Monsieur Schuler objected so
strongly, Monsieur Hambarson, a Christian merchant who through Áqá
Shu‘a’lláh – a merchant from Milan – had learned about the Faith in Tiflis
[Tbilisi, Georgian], rose and pulled his pistol to shoot him. However, the
Mudabbiru’l-Mamálik quickly seized the pistol and removed it from Monsieur
Hambarson’s hand. Vociferous protests and complains of Christians
intensified. The confirmations of Sanctified God poured forth, however, and
the meeting concluded. Since my residence was near the government house, the
governor became thoroughly aware of the details of this incident and raised no
objections to the believers.

Because of the priest’s inability to respond [to Bahá’í arguments] at that
gathering, several Christian attendees accepted the truth of this mighty Cause
[i.e. became Bahá’ís]. Therefore, from then on, each week a number of
Christians would attend the Bahá’í gatherings and meetings – some held in the
home of Áqá ‘Alí Arbáb and some in my residence. The believers at that time
were at utmost safety and security.

Cleric Opposition to the Governor
In the year 1319 AH [1901], the following ‘ulamá in Rasht rose against the just
government of lieutenant-general Nasru’s-Saltanih Tunukábuní: Mullá
Muhammad [known as] Hájí Khummámí; Hájí Siyyid Yúsuf Mujtahid; Hájí
Mullá Muhammad Síqlání; Hájí Áqá Ridá; Mullá Mihdí Sharía‘tmadár; Hájí
Siyyid ‘Abdu’lláh; Mullá Muhammad Kadú-Sará’í; Mullá Sagharí-Sázání; Shaykh
Muhammad-‘Alí Sígár-Vadí; Hájí Bahru’l-‘Ulúm Najafí; Shaykh ‘Alí Sígár-Vadí;
Shaykh ‘Alí Vayksará’í; Mullá Yúsuf Dabílí; and some 20 other antagonistic
clerics – all outwardly accomplished and spiritually lifeless. They gathered in
Chahar-Mahal22, and for a while planned and connived on ways that would
bring about the governor’s dismissal from office – thinking that after his
dismissal, they would implement their evil plots and injure and harm the
innocent and meek friends of God [i.e. Baha’is].

At that time, because of Governor Nasru’s-Saltanih’s considerations and
support, Bahá’ís of Rasht would freely organize gatherings and with utmost joy
and felicity were engaged in teaching the Cause of God. In fact, in nine

\[22\] Lit, four neighborhoods. The present translator is uncertain whether it refers to a specific
location or four different neighborhoods in Rasht.

neighborhoods, without any fear or worries, and without any dissimulation,
they were engaged in service to the Faith. The enemies and ill-wishers learned
of these things and reported the details to the concourse of the ‘ulamá. In their
report they emphasized that several new Bahá’í teachers had recently arrived
and would include all the specifics and particulars in these reports so that a
pretext could be created for tumult. The believers though continued with their
activities with much pride and no secrecy23.

Bahá’í Photographers
Several months passed. During their period a multitude were awaiting turmoil
and troubles. It was then that two Bahá’ís, Áqá Mírzá ‘Alí Khán ‘Akkás [“the
photographer”] and Áqá Mírzá Áqá Khán ‘Akkás-Báshí, arrived in Rasht. After
meeting several times with the friends and believers, they started emphasizing
their photography craft in order to advance their business. Each day, Baha’is
being completely enchanted with this novelty, would invite the two newly-
arrived believers. These two distinguished photographers, however, carried
their intentions to extreme and suggested that a group photo of the entire
Bahá’í community be taken. After a few days, this matter was taken to the
Spiritual Assembly, which did not deem it advisable, stating, “[The conditions
in] these days are not conducive for this request and we must wait another
time.”

The Picture
However, since God – Sanctified and Exalted be He – always tests His
servants, after a few days, through another mean, they secured the Assembly’s
permission. That it, as the day of Declaration of His Holiness the Primal Point
[i.e. the Báb], which coincided with the anniversary of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s birth, was
approaching, the Spiritual Assembly granted its consent for a group picture be
taken on that auspicious Day. The honored Colonel Jahán-Bakhsh Khán, who
was the chief-of-staff of the governor, Qásim Khan, invited all the friends to
gather in his house for lunch where a community photograph would be taken.
He was a member of the Spiritual Assembly and because of his request, it was
agreed that on the Day of Declaration a feast be held in his residence and a
photograph be taken that would include a portrait of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Afterwards,
12 copies of this picture were to be prepared and the glass-negative be kept by
the Assembly to ensure bounds of prudence were observed.

\[23\] The author refers to bí hikmatí which literally means “lack of wisdom”, but in this context
the phrase is understood by the translator to mean lack of secrecy in holding Bahá’í
gatherings.

On the Day of festivities, all Baha’is gathered and before lunch, a group
picture was taken. Afterwards, everyone had lunch and the gathering was
concluded.

After some time, the evildoers reported this event to the assemblage of
the ‘ulamá which afforded them the pretext [they were looking for]. Each one
rose in a different way and manner, with schemes and conspiracies, to harass
the friends [i.e. Bahá’ís] and cause tumult.

Distribution of the Picture
A month after the picture was taken, the two photographers made a copy of
the picture and sold that copy to a certain Mashhadí Luft-‘Alí Bandar-Chí
Pírbázárí. The latter, had pretended to be a member of the Bahá’í community
and took the picture, decoratively framed it and hung it in his house. His shop
was located in the Pírbázár quarter and as such, he instructed his carriage-driver
with a written instruction to go to his residence and fetch that picture for
transference to Pírbázár. The carriage-driver did as bidden, but on the way
stopped at the Caravansary Mutasham, when the frame fell from his hand and
broke. Several people that were there came over quickly and picked up the
picture. The hollered a few obscene words to the carriage-driver and took the
picture with them. The carriage-driver returned to Pírbázár.

That night, one of the merchants whose office was in the same
Caravansary, had a Rawdih-Khání [“prayer vigil”] in his house. His name was
Áqá Siyyid Ridá Sayf-Sádát. This Qazvíní merchant took the picture and hid it.
When the Rawdih-Khání was concluded, the picture remained with him.
Several days later, Áqá Sayf-Sádát consulted with several hostiles and
antagonistic Twelver Shí‘I and together they went before the concourse of the
‘ulamá and presented the picture.

Through the plans of the assemblage of the ‘ulamá, that very picture
became the cause of turbulences – and [the stage of quiet planning] was from 7
Jamádíu’th-Thání [11 September 1902] until 11 Dhi’l-Hajjih 1320 AH [11
March 1903].

Their first step was to give the picture to Mírzá Táhir, the son of
Mustawfí, one of the prominent citizens of Rasht, in order for him to
reproduce 50 copies, one for each of the city’s ‘ulamá. In turn, each cleric, on
his own accord, was to disperse the picture across the province of Gilan, so
turmoil, disturbances and mischief could precipitate.

Igniting the Protests
In that same year, a certain Mashhadí Taqí Zargar with his brother Mashhadí
Ridá, who were both goldsmiths, were engaged in their profession. These two

were brothers of Áqá Mashhadí Qásim Zargar who was mentioned earlier [in
these pages]. These two brothers were working in their shop when a woman,
sent there on the instigation of the ‘ulamá, came in for purchase of some gold
jewelries. After the usual discussions, she procured the item, paid and left.
When she was leaving, [she looked at the picture-frame] and according to
instructions that she had been given previously, raised the cry of “Our religion
is lost!”

It is well evident what a mighty clamor resulted. As she cried hysterically,
the other shopkeepers in the bazaar rushed into the shop of two [Bahá’ís], and
with utmost severity and cruelty dealt with those two wronged brothers. At last,
they dragged the men to the home of Mullá Muhammad Khummámí, the
renowned Hujjatu’l-Islám. It must be clear what befell the two men; to such
extent, that pen is unable to recount more. Moreover, given the situation
described, it must be evident the manner that the ‘ulamá of Rasht behaved as
they strongly opposed the governorship of the Nasru’s-Saltanih. The governor,
on the other hand, was proud, brave and courageous, though he could not
change the course of events.

The ‘ulamá connived some more and this time wrote a statement with
large lettering, pretending that it is from the much wronged Bahá’ís of Rasht.
This letter was addressed to the renowned Hjujjatu’l-Islám and contained every
manner of insult, offense, obscenity, and unseemly accusations. This document
was their instrument for further agitation and turmoil.

Shortly, the governor sent instruction to Áqá Shaykh Mihdí
Sharí‘atmadár to urgently send Áqá Taqí and Áqá Ridá Zargar to the
government house. When they were sent there, they were dismissed [from
captivity].

A Death and Planned Burial
Subsequent to the release of those two distinguished men, Ustád Hashim
Banná Qazvíní, the brother of Dervish Báqir who was known as Dervish
Mas‘úd, was stricken with paralysis and passed away two days later. In short,
day by day, the concourse of the ‘ulamá were getting closer to their objective.
When Dervish Mas‘úd learned of the death of his brother, Ustád Hashim, he
began arrangements for the funeral procession, which would include marching
and howling demonstrators, rising of standards, and the sound of drums and
trumpets. Ustád Hashim’s father-in-law, Siyyid Hasan Baqqál [“grocer”], who
was one of the mischief-makers and ruffians of Rasht, urgently learned of the
funeral details and informed several of the troublemakers. Together they went
to the home of the Bahru’l-‘Ulúm and reported the details. In turn, the Bahru’l-
‘Ulúm informed very seminarian student and akhund in Rasht with instruction
that they should impede the funeral.

The governor learned of this plan. He sent several of his farrashes and
their chief, the Muntasru’d-Dawlih, to ensure that the deceased would have a
funeral procession.

Attack on Bahá’ís
When this information reached the assemblage of the ‘ulamá, they decided to
attack and plunder the home of Bahá’ís and massacre them. For this purpose,
during the night they hung the letter that they had forged from Bahá’ís
containing all manners of insult and obscenities heaped on the Hujjatu’l-Islam
Hájí Khummámí, on the entrance of the Hujjatu’l-Islam’s home.

Mullá Muhammad Hájí Khummámi himself was not aware of this plan
and early in the morning came out of his house to find a large placard hung on
his house’s entrance, all containing insults, abuse and curses, while his other
door was covered with filth and refuse. He also was deeply perturbed that
several passer-bys were standing there loudly reading the letter. Quickly, he [i.e.
the Hujjatu’l-Islam] informed the bazaar for the shopkeepers to close their
shops and raise the cry, “Our religion is lost!”24

\[24\] According to The Bábí and Bahá’í Religions, pp. 375-376, on 16 May 1903, Alfred Churchill
sent a dispatch in the care of Major Archibald Douglas, who was Military Attaché to Tehran
Legation, to Sir Arthur Hardinge (Churchill to Hardinge No. 28, 16 May 1903: FO 248 792):

I am taking advantage of the departure of Major Douglas to
> communicate to your Excellency the latest news respecting the Babi
> agitation, which is if anything more acute, owing to an obscure placard
discovered this morning on the door of the Mujtehed Haji Hummami.

This placard, purporting to have been written by a Babi, heaped the
> foulest abuse on Haji Hummami and his female relatives. The Ulema were
> held up to contempt for being powerless and Syed Assadullah, the head of
> the Transport Company, the Ferrash Bashi and Haji Mirza Mohamed Arbabi
> were praised as being the high protectors of Babis and members of the
glorious community.

It requires little perspicacity to recognise that the offending
> document was not composed by a Babi but by some evil-disposed person
> anxious to cause trouble. The Mollahs however insist that it was the work of
> the Babis and a meeting took place in the house of Haji Hummami this
morning.

The wildest rumours are current throughout the town. The latest
> information I have is that two of the principal Babis were called to
> Government House this afternoon and that a Jew who has in turn been
> Mussulman, Babi and then Mussulman again was sticked this afternoon by
> order of the Nasres Saltaneh in connection with the placard incident. This
> shows that the Nasres Saltaneh's hand has been forced to a certain extent but
> it is difficult to obtain reliable information.

In light of his responsibilities, the governor also moved quickly to
restore order throughout the city. He gave instructions for the troops, cavalries
and artilleries to be stationed around the government house and to remove the
insurrection, and to ensure that no harm would come to the wronged believers
– perchance that the God’s lambs would be secure from the vicious wolves.

The situation grew intense when the ruffians, hooligans and hoodlums
launched their attack. However, when the ‘ulamá saw the guns and artilleries
and realized that the tumult and uprising would result in their own uprooting,
they withdrew their hands from bloodshed, mischief and sedition, relinquishing
their earlier plans and hopes.

On that day, however, the ‘ulamá sent the aforementioned picture to all
parts of Iran, causing all manner of cruelty and brutality. In every town, the fire
of incitements and seditions rose high, particularly in Yazd, Nayriz and Isfahan,
in such wise that even the field of Karbala had not witnessed such incidents.25
Even the foreign governments became aware of brutalities of this tyrannical,
bloodthirsty [Shí‘i] sect and testified to the meekness of this party [Bahá’ís].26

Siyyid Mutivalí
There was a certain Áqá Siyyid Husayn, who was from Mazandaran and had
been entangled in troubles [and some time ago] had fled to Rasht. He was in
that same picture mentioned above, seated with great dignity. To observe
wisdom, he had enrolled as one of the special attendants of [the Hujjatu’l-
Islam] Hájí Khummámí to the point that he was entrusted with administration

Some days ago a dervish was arrested for reviling Babis in the
> Bazaars. The Governor General caused his head to be shaved and expelled
> him from the town. This gives rise to much talk to the effect that dervishes
> singing in praise of Ali and true-believers who dig up the corpse of a
renegade Mussulman are sticked, shaved and have their ears cut off.

I am told that a telegraphic petition complaining of the conduct of
> the Governor General has been sent to Menjil for despatch to Tehran from
the Telegraph office there.

I will not fail to communicate to your Excellency any further
occurrences which may take place.

\[25\] Karbala is the scene of the martyrdom of Imam Husayn and his companions and marks
one of the most significant events in the entire Shí‘i history.

\[26\] In the summer of 1903, a widespread persecution of Baha’is in Isfahan led to a pogrom of
Baha’is in Yazd and surrounding towns. By September, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had written a long
treatise detailing the occurrences and had a copy translated into English and published in the
West, which resulted in many Americans and Europeans becoming aware of the intense
persecution of Baha’is in Iran. For a history of this incident (and a new translation of this
watershed document), see, Ahang Rabbani, “’Abdu’l-Bahá’s Treatise on the Persecution of
Bahá’ís in 1903”, http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com/persecutionin1903.

of some religious endowments. Because of this, he was referred to as, Áqá
Siyyid Husayn Mutivalí [“custodian of endowments”].

Without being aware of the occurrences, near noon one day during the
course of upheavals, he attended the Rawdih-Khání of the Hujjatu’l-Islam.
After the prayer session was concluded, Áqá Hájí Khummámí instructed one of
his attendants, “Remove Siyyid Mutivalí’s turban, beat him over the head, and
expel him from the gathering.” After this, the endowments were also removed
from his administration. Of certainty, it must be clear what befell that wronged
and debilitated believer, who after a few days left Rasht.27

According to The Bábí and Bahá’í Religions, pp. 373-374, the British Consul at Rasht,
Alfred Churchill, reported on these episodes in a dispatch dated 8 May 1903 to Sir Arthur
Hardinge, the British Minister at Tehran (Churchill to Hardinge, No. 22, 8 May 1903: FO
248 792):

I have the honour to report that a disturbance took place on Sunday
last, the 3rd instant, between a Babi jeweller and some Mussulmans.

The indirect cause of this disturbance was a photograph of a section
> of the Rasht Babi community which through the bad faith of a photographer
> has been circulating throughout the town. Two individuals passing by the
> jeweller's shop in the Bazaar made some jocular remarks in regard to this
> photograph, whereupon the owner of the shop is reported to have roared
out that he was a Babi and would allow no one to insult his religion.

This resulted in a dispute followed by a general melee in which
> students from a neighbouring college took part. No great harm however
> appears to have been done, the combatants, Gileks[peasants of Gilan]
> inordinately afflicted with cacoethes loquendi,[a mania for speech] having no
doubt exhausted themselves during the preliminary clamour.

The Governor General sent for the Babi and his brother and
> detained them until the next day in order to keep them out of harm's way.
> On Monday the jeweller opened his shop and has not been molested in any
way since.

A copy of the photograph found its way into the hands of Haji
> Hummami, one of the principal and perhaps the most learned of the Resht
> Ulema, who was astounded to see that a Syed,[footnote this that it is Siyyid
> Husayn Mutivali] his trusted henchman and Mutevalli [custodian] of a Saint's
> tomb near Sangar, was one of the group of Babis. The Syed had timely
> warning and has prudently kept out of the way of the Mujtehed who
> threatens to beat him severely. I am told that the Haji and others of the
> Ulema have decreed that the Syed and other Babis must divorce their
> Mussulman wives but that the Nasres Saltaneh has intimated to them that no
> interference will be allowed as it is the desire of H.M. the Shah that religion
> should be free. I am also told that the Nasres Saltaneh has sent for a further
> detachment of one hundred soldiers who are to come from Kasvin and I
> may mention that since last Sunday the small force stationed at Resht has
> been served with ball cartridges.

The Funeral
[To return to the funeral account], after three days and nights, through the
insistence of believers and instructions of the esteemed governor, the
Muntasru’d-Dawlih, the chief of farrashes picked up the remains [of Ustád
Hashim]. He sent word to Dervish Mas‘úd who came with his followers and
buried the body of Ustád Hashim near Bagh Shah, at a location known as
Khalbásh-Kallih.28

This news reached the ‘ulamá. The next morning the ‘ulamá and the
local thugs marched to Bagh Shah and exhumed the remains of that
distinguished man from his grave. They tore it into pieces and set it on fire.

There has been some talk on the part of the Mollahs of boycotting
> the Babis, who it was proposed, should not be allowed to enter the public
> baths but I trust that the firm and sympathetic attitude of the Governor
> General will prevent the execution of any plans which the Mollahs may have
> formed with the object of creating disturbance at the expense of the
community at Resht.

I am informed that the Babis here amount to about one thousand
persons of both sexes including at least one Greek and some Armenians.

\[28\] According to The Bábí and Bahá’í Religions, pp. 374-375, on 10 May 1903, Alfred
Churchill dispatched the following report (Churchill to Hardinge No. 24, 10 May
1903: FO 248 792):

With reference to my despatch No. 22 of the 8th instant, I have the
> honour to report a further incident created by the demise of a Babi mason
yesterday.

The relatives proposed the customary obsequies according to
> Mussulman rites but the arrival of the usual paraphernalia in the shape of bier
> and wooden sweetmeat trays caused some excitement in the neighbourhood
> which speedily resulted in the gathering of a large mob from all parts of the
town.

A disturbance being feared, the Governor General requested the
> Shariat Madar to arrange matters. The Mujtehed did so in a very
> commendable manner as, although the crowd remained in the vicinity of the
house during the whole of the day, no breach of the peace occurred.

During the night the corpse was secretly taken in the direction of the
> Boosar Toll Station by some soldiers, farrashes and two servants of the
Shariat Madar, who dug a grave and interred the body.

Nothing further of importance has occurred but there can be no

the recent disturbances at Meshed due to the same cause.

It is certain that the dearness of the common necessities of life is
> much felt at Resht and, with your Excellency's permission, I will on a future
> occasion revert to the question.

This news reached the governor. Immediately he sent his men to seize
the evildoers and without trial to punish them appropriately. The instigators
were beaten severely with sticks and the thugs had their ears and noses cut off,
and as an admonishment to others, were paraded throughout the city.

Public Uprising
As result of this incident, a public uprising took place. Some rushed to the
government house, some went towards the home of the Mudabbiru’l-Mamálik,
some towards the home of Mírzá Ibráhím Ibtiháju’l-Mulk and some attacked
the home of Áqá ‘Alí Arbáb. The roar of “Our religion is lost!” and “O
Muhammad!” and “O ‘Alí” had filled the entire city. However, they were not
able to injure or hurt the believers.29

For three days this upheaval continued. The Sharí‘atmadár, who was a
capable and competent man, quickly came to the government house and
commenced discussions towards diffusing this mighty uproar which on one
hand was witnessing the attack of hooligans and on the other, the unrest
throughout the city.

In short, after three days, it was determined that the way to subdue the
uprising was for several of the Baha’is to leave Rasht. It was believed that with
their exit, the situation would be calmed. The group [to leave town] was to
consist of: the Ibtiháju’l-Mulk; the Mudabbiru’l-Mamálik; Hájí Mírzá Ahmad

\[29\] According to The Bábí and Bahá’í Religions, pp. 374-375, on 15 May 1903, Alfred Churchill
reported (Churchill to Hardinge No. 26, 15 May 1903: FO 248 792):

With reference to my despatch No. 24 dated the 10th instant, I have
> the honour to further report that a number of malefactors exhumed and
> mutilated the body of the Babi mason, which they subsequently proceeded to
burn with naptha.

For this outrage many arrests were made and two rogues lost an
> auricle apiece besides being sticked. The executioner was also bastinadoed
> for being implicated as were likewise the other persons who had been
arrested.

A servant of the Mujtehed Haji Hummami was arrested in
> connection with this outrage and was, I understand, well sticked but he was
> released in consequence of the threatening proceedings of the Haji in his
> mosque. The Mujtehed stopped the 'Rozeh' which was being held and sent
> for the religious students for the purpose, it is said, of releasing his servant by
force.

The release of this man, however, smoothed matters over for the
> time being but I fear that at the present juncture it will require little to cause
an explosion if the Mollahs do not keep quiet.

It is generally suspected that the Nasres Saltaneh is himself a Babi.

> Whether this is the case or not there can be no doubt that he is helping them

Qazvíní; Mírzá Ibráhím Jadíd Siyáh-Kulí; Dervish Mas‘úd; Mírzá Husayn Khán,
the son of Rafí‘u’l-Mulk; Colonel Jahán-Bakhsh Khán, the chamberlain of the
Governor Qásim Khán; Karbalá’í ‘Abbás ‘Alláf; Mashhadí Ridá; Mashhadí Taqí
Zargar; Siyyid Husayn Mutivalí; Mírzá Áqá Sárimu’l-Atibbá; the I‘tidáu’l-
Vizarih, the chief of the post office; ‘Alí Dá’í; Mírzá Tarázu’lláh; and this lowly
servant, Yahyá. The Sanctified Lord looked upon Áqá ‘Alí Arbáb and his family
with the eye of compassion since there was no mention of them in the
discussions.

When the above-named were about to be expelled from town, Siyyid
Mutivalí, who previously had left town, arrived back in Rasht. The
troublemakers learned of his arrival, seized him, removed his turban and placed
a paper hat on that wretched soul and unclad, throw him out of the house. In
streets and bazaar that illustrious man suffered bitterly at the hand of ungodly
and did not have a moment of rest nor comfort. Eventually, Mírzá Ibráhím
Jadíd gave him room in his house for a few days and protected him.

The troubles in Rasht began to spill to other towns as well. In Lahijan,
Áqá Mashhadí Ghulám-‘Alí Tájjir [“merchant”] was expelled from his residence
and twenty other believers were harassed, tormented and beaten.

Even in such places as Siyáh-Kul and Langar-Rúd, and any other
location where the lamp of divine Faith was lit, they tried to extinguish its light.

The news reached the governor. He charged someone to see to the
protection and support of the divine friends. However, that wretched soul, who
was bereft of knowledge of God, arrived like a Shimr30 in Lahijan and
commenced searching for the reminder of the companions of the Prince of the
Martyrs so he would slay them too.31 That tyrannical and bloodthirsty man,
whose name must be preserved for posterity, was the Jalílu’l-Mamálik. His
older brother, Mu‘ín Humáyún had rendered great services in Shiraz to the
friends of God.

Soon the upheavals and tumults reached Port Anzali, which is Iran’s
large port. Several of Bahá’ís lived there, including Áqá Mírzá Áqá Tihrání, and
some others. They too were engulfed in the persecution and maltreatment of
the bloodthirsty people.

It was about that time that it was heard that Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí had
arrived from the Holy Land in Port Anzali, bearing a world of tidings and soul-
stirring news. The people there, however, attacked the customhouse [to injure
him], but two or three of the believers were able to protect him. The Hájí
inquired from Rasht what he should do to remain safe. In turn, the Spiritual

\[30\] Shmir was the persecutor of Imam Husayn on the field of Karbala.

\[31\] Meaning the officer in charge of protecting the Bahá’í community instead turned into its
persecutor.

Assembly contacted the governor and inquired about the means of his
protection. The instruction was for Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí to arrive at one of
the friends’ homes under the cover of darkness. He was then to be conveyed
confidentially to Tehran. In accordance with this plan, Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí
came to Rasht and then proceeded to Tehran.

Banishment of Bahá’ís
In Rasht, subsequent to discussions between the concourse of the ‘ulamá and
the governor, it was decided to exile a number of friends, whose names were
recorded previously, in order to clam the uproars and turbulences. The
governor sent his men in the early morning of 27 Rabí‘u’th-Thání [23 July
1903] to summon those intended to exile to the government house. This
included: Mírzá Ibráhím, the Ibtiháju’l-Mulk; Colonel Jahán-Bakhsh Khán;
Mírzá Ibráhím Jadíd; Ghulám-‘Alí Khán, the Mudabbir [u’l-Mamálik]; and this
humble servant.

When we had arrived at the government house and seeing each other,
the honored Ghulám-‘Alí Khán the Mudabbir commenced dispute and protest
with the governor’s chief of farrashes. Through the urging of Colonel Jahán-
Bakhsh Khán, Mírzá Ibráhím and I decided to go before the governor and
beseech him to annul and withdraw the order for our exile. However, when we
came before the governor and he saw us, particularly the wretched Áqá Mírzá
Ibráhím, he shouted, “Take them outside and beat them with sticks until I
come myself!” They took Mírzá Ibráhím, but Colonel Jahán-Bakhsh Khán and
I escaped through another door and were deprived of the great bounty of being
beaten by sticks!

However, the honored Mírzá Ibráhím bountifully partook of this bounty
and while beaten would cry out, “Yá Hadrat ‘Abbás, Yá Hadrat ‘Abbás!” From
another entrance of the government house, I reached him and at that point,
they stopped beating him because in those days I carried some influence and
was esteemed by those that worked in the government offices and for this
reason, they decided to abandon further corporal punishments. They took him
to prison instead.

Quickly I left the government house to see what had befallen my friends.

A carriage was immediately summoned and I boarded the Mudabbiru’l-
Mamálik and the Ibtiháju’l-Mulk and conveyed them to Idarih Ráh-Choussée
[Highway Office] which in those days was in the lease of Áqá Siyyid Asadu’lláh
Barát-Báz, who in those days owned the transportation system. I asked for a
half of an hour reprieve from an officer who had arrived to conduct the men

[on their exile] to Tehran so a change of clothing could be brought from their
residences. They were then sent off to Tehran.32

After this occurrence, the Nimrod-like fire caused by the ‘ulamá,
troublemakers and ruffians was extinguished.

Colonel Núru’lláh Khán, who was among the staunch and steadfast
Bahá’ís, came to the government house in company of ten of his cavalry
soldiers, so they could accompany the exiled men from Rasht to Sanjil. Several
of the governor’s officers brought the following believers to the government
house as they were supposed to be seen by the ‘ulamá before being sent on
exile. The governor intended for their exile to commence once they had arrived
outside the city limit, but the ‘ulamá insisted that they must be conducted
through the bazaar so everyone would be certain of their fate and thus grow
quiet. In short, the men that were brought were: Áqá Mírz´Husayn Khán, the
son of the Rafí‘u’l-Mulk; Karbalá’í ‘Abbás ‘Alláf; Mashhadí Ridá Zargar;
Mashhadí Taqí Zargar; Áqá Mírzá Báqir Dervish, known as Dervish Mas‘úd;
Áqá ‘Alí Dá’í Babbágh; Áqá Siyyid Husayn Mutivalí; Áqá Ustád ‘Abdu’lláh
Qannád; Áqá Mashhadí ‘Alí Qahvih-Chí Isfahání; and Áqá Mashhadí Husayn
Qazvíní, who had a shop near Kháhar-Imám. These named believers attained
the honor of service to the Faith by being banished.

The following believers, however, were deprived of this mighty bounty
and were not exiled: Mírzá Ibráhím Jadíd Siyáh-Kalí; Colonel Jahán-Bakhsh
Khán; Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí Khán Tihrání, who worked in the telegraph
office; the I‘tidáu’l-Vúzará; Hájí Mírzá Ahmad Tájjir Qazvíní; Monsieur
Kalaws33; Mírzá Ishaq Khán Kashání; Áqá Mírzá Áqá Tabíb, known as the
Sáramu’l-Atibbá; and this ephemeral servant. In consideration of their

\[32\] The Bábí and Bahá’í Religions, p. 376, records that on 19 May, Alfred Churchill
reported [Churchill to Hardinge No. 29, 19 May 1903: FO 248 792]:

In continuation of my despatch No. 28 of the 16th instant, I have the
> honour to report that the Vezir Nizam, who arrived from Europe last week,
> has not yet left for Tehran having been instructed to remain at Resht to
> cooperate with the Governor General so long as the agitation against the
Babis continues.

Two prominent Babis, the Ebtehaj ol Mulk and the Mudabber el

> favourable aspect giving rise to the hope that the agitation will gradually
subside before more harm results.

\[33\] The present translator is uncertain of the correct spelling.

professions and occupation, these individuals were not pursued any further by
the governor or by the ‘ulamá.

Continued Harassment of Bahá’ís
After these occurrences, it was decided that the Bahá’ís – both men and women
– would not be permitted to use public baths. Moreover, instead of shaving the
Bahá’í heads, the barbers were cutting their scalps.

In short, two months later, the wretched Siyyid Mutivalí, who had been
hiding in various places, came out one day, without turban [which would be the
sign of his lineage], for the purpose of earning a living. However, he
encountered two of the ‘ulamá who ruthlessly had forced him to their own
residence. The two were: Áqá Siyyid Ismá‘íl Mujtahid Rashtí and Áqá Siyyid
‘Abdu’lláh Rashtí, who was related to the Hujjatu’l-Islam. There he was told,
“Either you must deny and curse [the Bahá’í Faith] or we will tear you into
pieces.”

This news reached the new governor, the Hakímu’l-Mulk. [It should be
noted that] he had been installed in office when two months after the
upheavals caused by the ‘ulamá, then governor, the Nasru’s-Saltanih, was
dismissed from the office.34

I am not sure how Siyyid Mutivalí had managed to escape from the two
clerics after all his cloths had been torn and he had been stripped of every
garment. Nevertheless, he had ran into the street and a Muslim – who
apparently was not a Muslim but was one of the believers to this Mighty Cause
– had found him and covered him with his own thin, black summer ‘abá and
shown him the path of flight.

In utmost state of wretchedness, injuries and fatigue, Siyyid Mutivalí
came to the residence of my brother, Áqá Mírzá Nabí – a home that belonged
to a non-Bahá’í. It was midnight when they informed me, so I went and
brought him to my own home where he stayed in secret. Two days later, I took
him to his own residence and after consulting the friends, a week later he was
sent to Badkubih and then to ‘Ishqabad.

At that time, Áqá ‘Alí Arbáb lived in a caravansary located behind the
town’s large-square. Half of this building belonged to Áqá Siyyid Asadu’lláh,
who was [one of the] Sádát Khams, and although he was a believer, he would
hide his allegiance and strenuously avoided all the Bahá’ís of Rasht. One of the

\[34\] According to Momen, The Bábí and Bahá’í Religions, p. 376, “the agitation died away
gradually, but the courage and efficiency of Nasru’s-Saltanih was not rewarded. Indeed a
short while later he was removed from his Governorship and left Rasht on 1 June 1903;”
(reference is made to correspondence between the British Consul in Rasht, Alfred Churchill
to Sir Arthur Hardinge No. 31, 6 June 1903: FO 248 792).

rooms in this caravansary was occupied by Áqá ‘Alí Arbáb. Several other
residents of this caravansary where among the ruffians and agitators and they
sternly told Áqá Siyyid Asadu’lláh, “You must expel ‘Alí Bábí from this
location.”

That distinguished man obeyed and informed Arbáb that he was to
vacate the premise. It must be clear what strain was placed on him until he left
that caravansary. After he had left that location, through the intercessions of
Mírzá Ibráhím Jadíd and the Mafákhiru’l-Mulk, he found a room in Saráy-
Kamrániyih, which was located behind the government house. This room
though was so foul that no one could stand even an hour in there. However,
through the payment of a large sum, this was the only room he could acquire.
Áqá ‘Alí Arbáb, Áqá Mírzá Tarázu’lláh and Áqá Ghulám-‘Alí lived in that
room.

Arbáb was owed a few thousand tumans in Rasht. A few days after he
had transferred his residence to the new location, Hájí Khummámí proclaimed
that all that owed money to ‘Alí Bábí were excused from paying him even a
small coin and that this debt was forgiven to everyone much the same that
mother’s milk was free to the babe. He added that only if Arbáb had a son and
the son was a Muslim, then the money was owed to the boy. For a long time
Arbáb tried to negotiate with those that owed him money, but at the end he
was not able to collect even a single coin.

Mention of Áqá Mírzá Áqá Tabíb, the Sarámu’l-Atibbá, was made
earlier. That desolate soul one day had gone to the public bath known as
Hammám Hájí Mírzá Nasír. He had not started his bath and had not gone into
the pool when this news was taken to Hájí Khummámí. The Hujjatu’l-Islam
sent a gang of his evildoers, who were his seminarian students, to the bath and
they dragged him outside, unclad, wearing only a torn towel. In such a way, he
was paraded in the streets and bazaar. I saw him when this incident was
occurring and through expenditure of a considerable sum was able to win his
ransom and save him from the claws of those bloodthirsty wolves.

From the beginning of the turbulences on 11 Dhi’l-Hajjih 1320 AH [11

March 1903] until its conclusion was two months. During this period, the
wretched, wronged believers were seized in the hands of ferocious tyrants and
each day they were tormented and tortured through a new excuse. Praise unto
God that this wronged community shone brilliantly on the field of trial and
emerged steadfast and sincere. Although outwardly the Baha’is of Rasht did not
suffer martyrdoms, alas, each hour of day was like drinking from the chalice of
self-renunciation. The martyrs of other towns in Iran suffered only once as a
martyr; but the believers of Rasht, despite their fewness, were to suffer
unabated and most bitterly over a long period.

It was three days after the passing of the Hakímu’l-Mulk, who was the
governor of Rasht and had died suddenly through a heart attack, that I bid my
friends goodbye and left for Talish.

A Tablet from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
After these incidents, I have nothing worthy of readers to present. Therefore, I
conclude with the text of a Tablet that I received during the course of those
upheavals which I include in these pages of history.

Rasht. The honored Mírzá Yahyá Khán, the ‘Amídu’l-Atibbá, upon
him rest the glory of God!

> He is God!

O firm servant of God! Even though clouds of tribulations repeatedly
> poured forth rains of afflictions, the field of suffering was spread, the ensemble
> of trial was readied, the chalice of persecution was disseminated and the friends
> drank their fill and became target of oppressions and cruelties – this servant
> too was a partner and participant in each of these ordeals, and a denizen of
> the corner of this territory of calamity and difficulties. Do not be sad. Do not
> grieve. Whatever occurs, of certainty, is ordained and appropriate. This is the
> prerequisite of faithfulness in the love of God. It is decreed and ordained for
the friends of God.

Days pass away. Continually every day and night witnesses new
> events. All created things are target of the arrow of destiny and subject to every
> calamity. It is by this reason that the contingent world is subject to change and
revolution, and subordinate to hardships and adversities.

The difference is that all others suffer trials in path of self-desires,
> while the divine friends accept the dart of trials in the path of God. The first is
> futile, while the latter will bear results more precious pearls and jewels.
> Therefore, give thanks unto Lord that in the path of God you suffered
difficulties.

The hope of the faithful is that from His infinite bounties, this
> hardship will transform into blessings, and this anguish will become the
mighty recompense and the greatest bestowal.

> Upon thee be salutations and praise,
> ‘A. ‘A.35

\[35\] Present translator is grateful to Adel Shafipour for bringing to his attention that this Tablet
also appeared in Makátíb ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, vol. 6, pp. 112-113. The current rendering has
benefited from an eloquent draft translation posted by Dr. Khazeh Fananapazir on
Tarjuman internet discussion group on 18 February 2007.
