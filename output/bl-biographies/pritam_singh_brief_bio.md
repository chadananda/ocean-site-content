He is believed to be the first member of the Sikh community in India to accept the Bahá'í Faith, and the first to publish a Bahá'í weekly magazine in India. He was born on November 16th, 1881, in Punjab.

Prof. Pritam Singh obtained his B. A. degree in History, Economics and Political Science with distinction. In 1905, he became a teacher in Achison College, Lahore. He received his Master's degree in Economics from the university of Calcutta. He was appointed Professor of Economics and joined the University of Punjab. He was a Linguist and knew Hindi, Urdu, Gurmukhi, Persian and English.

He received the message of Bahá'u'lláh from Mirzá Mahmud soon after his graduation in 1904. He undertook teaching trips alone, and with Ms Martha Root and Dr. G. Y. Chitnis. He resigned from his profession to work for the Cause of God. He had simple habits. For the last few years of his life he pioneered to Amritsar where there were no other Bahá'ís at that time. He was one of the earliest secretaries of the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma. He passed away peacefully in his sleep on August 25th, 1959.
