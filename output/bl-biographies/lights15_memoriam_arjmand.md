                   Mahboubeh Arjmand

(d. 2013)

Mahboubeh Arjmand was born in the City of Hamedan in
Iran. She was the second child of Mr. Habiboullah Arjmand and
Mrs. Monireh Khanum Mobin Arjmand. Unfortunately, she lost
her mother at the age of ten and soon became the surrogate
mother of all her siblings. One can imagine how difficult this
must have been at a time when young children became seriously
ill frequently. She did not have any children of her own, but she
took care of all the children in the family as if they were her
own children. All the children in the family have very fond
memories of her, especially of the gifts and souvenirs she would
bring them every time she travelled.

Mahboubeh was a very talented person. She was a dress
designer and her specialty was bridal gowns, for which she had
earned a good reputation in Tehran. She studied hair styling and
skin care in Italy and had a good working knowledge of Italian

and French languages. She was extremely hospitable and
generous. Her home was always open to everyone. Family and
friends would often gather there, where there was always an
open invitation to enjoy her delicious Persian cuisine and her
pastry. She had a good sense of humor and often entertained the
family with her witty remarks.

Mahboubeh was a very devoted Bahá’í and, in her youth, was
actively engaged in Bahá’í activities in Tehran. She was proud of
her grand-father Haji Mehdi Arjmand who was a prominent
teacher of the Bahá’í Faith. She had memorized many of the
Tablets revealed in honor of her grandfather and would recite
them often. Mahboubeh Arjmand, after a period of failing
health, passed away peacefully in her own home in San Diego,
California, on September 14 2013.
