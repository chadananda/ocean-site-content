A transcript of audio-cassette from series

WINDOWS TO THE P A S T
by Darius K. Shahrokh, M.D.

No introduction more befitting, no words more expressive for opening
this window other than these awesome words of Baha'u'llah uttered
in the Book of Certitude about Mulla Husayn -
"But for him, God would not have been established upon

> the seat of His mercy, nor ascended the throne of
> eternal glory."      (Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 223)

In another tablet, Baha'u'llah has asserted that the Bab pronounced
Mulla Husayn to be the return and resurrection of Muhammad because
he was invested with the command of God the same way that Muhammad
was. Then Baha'u'llah states,
II
This station is sanctified from every limitation and name,
and naught can be seen therein but God."

(Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 185)

Now we can understand why, with praises given to Mulla Husayn by
his teacher, Siyyid Kazim, the other disciples suspected him to
be the promised Qa'im which was the station of the Bab. (God Passes
BY, P . 50)

He was eighteen when he went to Karbila, a holy city in Iraq, and
in those nine years he spent at the feet of his illustrious teacher,
Siyyid Kazim, one wonders if he had any idea about the glorious
mission awaiting him.

As you recall, Siyyid Kazim was the second and the last luminary
who appeared before the Declaration of the Bab, foretelling the
nearness of the advent of the promised Qa'im.

Although the doctrines of these two teachers were clearly in
accordance with Islamic holy writings, some prominent divines in
Iran contested them and showed indication of withdrawing their
support, bordering on open opposition. One such divine was in
Isfahan, once the capital of the Safavid dynasty in Iran.

Siyyid Kazim, in his lectures, made references to those divines,
and once he said if only a capable student of his could rise to
the occasion and convince those divines of the truth of his
teachings. You would guess that Mulla Husayn would be the one
who raised his hand, but his humility surpassed his greatness.
This paradox of greatness in humility has been repeatedly seen
in the history of the Faith.

The task was challenging and even dangerous since each of those
divines had a large number of followers who believed in them and
could not tolerate anyone challenging them.  Of all the disciples
who wished to rise to the occasion, one student rose up and
volunteered his services. Siyyid Kazim appreciated the offer,
but said, "This task is like playing with the lion's tail. Only
an equal could tackle these divines." Another day he gazed into
the eyes of frail Mulla Husayn, then twenty-seven years old, and
said, "Of all my disciples, only you have the capacity for such
a task, and I will choose no one but you."

Soon Mulla Husayn left for Isfahan, where in a short time he
disarmed and convinced that influential divine, carrying his written
testimony to other parts of the country. He communicated his
successes to his teacher who showered him with boundless praise,
but alluded that they would not meet again in this mortal world.

Then on that 31st day of December 1843, the year before the
Declaration of the Bab, as predicted by himself, Siyyid Kazim passed
away. About three weeks later Mulla Husayn, unaware of the passing
of his teacher, arrived in Karbila only to receive the shocking
news.

Being the most prominent disciple of Siyyid Kazim, he was visited
by high and low who offered their condolences. Then he gathered
the students and inquired about the last words of their departed
teacher, which were to disperse and find the promised Qa'im; that
there would not be another teacher to succeed him.

As soon as he heard the expressed wishes of their teacher, he asked,
"Why haven't you left?" Acknowledging their failure, they said,

\[11\] Such is our confidence in you that should you claim to be the
Promised One, we will all accept your claim.''

You see, their excitement and reverence for PIulla Husayn temporarily
blinded them to the features specified by their teacher for the
Qa'im. Mulla Husayn was thirty-one years old and was not a siyyid
which means a descendant of Muhammad.

Two of the egotistical disciples excused themselves under the
pretext of one wishing to protect the vacant seat of the departed
teacher, and the other felt obligated to stay in Karbila to care
for the children of the teacher, but really they had their eyes
on successorship.

All the devoted disciples and Mulla I-Iusayn's brother and nephew,
who had recently accompanied him from Iran, followed his example
and retired to a mosque where they fasted and prayed for forty
days. Then Mulla Husayn, his brother and nephew entered Iran
through the southern port city of Bushihr.

Mulla Husayn never married.    His sister and mother stayed in
Karbila. As you know, Tahirih was also an admirer of Siyyid Kazim
by correspondence, but arrived ten days too late to see that
illustrious teacher. She stayed with the wife of the teacher and
later converted her.

Now we find Mulla Husayn and two relatives in the southern part
of Iran directing their steps towards Shiraz, or shall we say their
steps were directed to a i r a z by the and of Providence. How else
could it be? The Bab was near the gate of Shiraz to greet Mulla
Busayn upon his arrival. The two were apparently total strangers,
but spiritually connected.

Now the memorable day is at hand, and the momentous hour ready
to strike. The birth of a new Dispensation, the exact account
of which as related by Mulla Husayn shall be treasured by
generations to come. On that beautiful twenty-second day of May,
1844, a few hours before sunset, Mulla Husayn and company arrived
at the gate of Shiraz, when he sent his brother and nephew to go

to a certain mosque for lodging, promising that he would join them
later.

Outside the gate, his eyes fell upon the radiant face of the Bab
who greeted him. He embraced Mulla Husayn as if they had been
lifelong friends. His first thought was that the Bab was another
disciple of Siyyid Kazim.       The exact details of the Bab's
Declaration have been graphically mentioned by Mulla Husayn and
recorded in The Dawn-Breakers, but in the interest of time, only
its highlights will be recounted.

Mulla Husayn's concern over joining his companions was overcome
by the gentle but compelling invitation of the Bab to follow Him
to His home. At the threshold of the door, Mulla Husayn prayed
that the first house he visited in a i r a z would be the instrument
to lead him to the object of his quest. If he only knew that that
was the House.

Friends, this was not an ordinary hour approaching. It was the
culmination of the six thousand years Cycle of Prophecy, and the
opening of the five thousand centuries of the Cycle of Fulfillment,
the two greatest religious cycles known to mankind.             The
significance of that hour demanded no less capacity and character
than that of Mulla Husayn, without whom the Dispensation would
not have been born. (Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 223)

Unaware of what was awaiting him, he followed his Host and entered
that modest House. Remember! Mulla Husayn still considered his
Host to be another disciple of his departed teacher. Answering
the inquiry of his Host, Mulla Husayn told Him what were the last
wishes of his teacher, and how he was searching for the Promised
One. Further, he enumerated the distinguishing features of the
Promised One. The Bab paused for awhile like the calm before the
thunder. Then the silence was broken with the vibrant voice of
the Bab proclaiming, "Behold, all these signs are manifest in Me!"

Thunderstruck, Mulla Husayn could not believe his ears. Not quite
convinced, he referred to the vast and innate knowledge of the
Promised One and his unsurpassed holiness repeatedly specified
by his late teacher. Suddenly he was struck with fear and remorse.
Upon the start of his search, Mulla Husayn had set two standards

that the Promised One must fulfill. The first was an explanation
of the mysteries of a long treatise written by himself, and the
second was producing a commentary on the chapter of Joseph in the
Qur'an, unasked. You see, during Mulla Husayn's days with his
teacher, Siyyid Kazim, once he asked his teacher to write a
commentary on the chapter of Joseph, but the teacher said, "This
is way beyond me. A commentary unlike any one before will be
revealed by the Promised One without being asked.

Mulla Husayn, with trepidation, gave his own treatise to the Bab
for perusal. The Bab glanced at certain pages, and in a short
time unravelled all the various mysteries in that treatise, the
like of which Mulla Husayn had never heard. Can you imagine Mulla
Husayn's state of mind? His heart surely was ready to leap out
of his chest. Whether speechless or not, we do not know, because
he did not have to utter a word when the final bolt of lightening
from Heaven struck. Friends, this was not just another ordinary
man-to-man talk. It was the power of the Holy Spirit giving birth
to a new cycle, a new dispensation.

The Bab said, "Now is the time for Me to reveal a commentary on
the chapter of Joseph." The impact of release of that force would
have crushed any mortal, but Mulla Husayn was blessed with fortitude
to withstand it. Mulla Husayn states, "He took up the pen and
with incredible rapidity revealed the first chapter of that
commentary. The overpowering effect of the manner in which He
wrote was heightened by the gentle intonations of His voice which
accompanied His writing. Not for one moment did He interrupt or
pause until it was finished." Then, when Mulla Husayn begged the
Bab to be permitted to leave, the clock registered two hours and
ten minutes after sunset. The Bab smilingly said, "Should you
leave in such a state surely whoever sees you will say, 'This poor
youth has lost his mind.'"

The Bab told him, "I am the Bab (meaning the Gate) and you are
the Babu'l-Bab" (meaning a gate to the Gate.)   It is interesting
that the Bab did not declare to Mulla Husayn that He was the Qa'im
which was obvious. Right then and there, by adopting the title
of the Gate, He alluded to the coming of a greater Manifestation.
After supper they sat up all night with Mulla Husayn taking in
every word uttered by the Bab. At dawn Mulla Husayn was dismissed.

That night the Bab instructed Mulla Husayn not to breath his
discovery to anyone until seventeen more people would independently
discover and recognize the Bab. He alluded to His oncoming trip
to Mecca after the completion of the first eighteen disciples,
and also instructed Mulla Husayn to go to the mosque which he had
chosen for lodging and teach Islamic courses.

It took forty days before the next person discovered the Bab, and
in about three months, their number reached eighteen.       These
eighteen disciples were called the Letters of the Living, one of
whom has a woman named Tahirih.

On several occasions, the Bab sent His servant to the mosque to
invite Mulla Husayn who joyously accompanied him, and every time
sat up all night in the presence of the Bab until the break of
day. In those forty days Mulla Husayn's lectures were like a magnet
to the divines and theological students, not knowing what the source
was. Of course, when the Bab's Faith came to open, his fame became
a liability for him a couple years later when he returned to Eiraz.

It is safe to assume that with Mulla Husayn's depth in Islamic
holy writings he was expecting another Manifestation, and the Bab's
assuming the title of the Gate further confirmed it. Did he ever
wonder if that Manifestation was born or not?    No one knows, but
he did not have to wait too long to find out.

The seventeenth Letter of the Living was a woman called Tahirih.
The last one, called Quddus, was also a student of Siyyid Kazim
and nine years younger than Mulla Husayn. Being the last disciple
or younger is meaningless in the realm of spirit. His discovery
of the Bab was as exciting as was his life, superior rank and
martyrdom. After the seventeenth disciple was accepted by the
Bab, He said, 'ITomorrow the eighteenth will join us." The next
day as Mulla Husayn was following a few steps behind the Bab, he
met the twenty-two-year-old Quddus who just had arrived from a
long journey. Knowing each other from school days, they embraced.
Quddus asked Mulla Husayn, "Have you found the object of your
quest?" Mulla Husayn was not at liberty to reveal the secret, so
he gave a vague answer. Suddenly the traveller said, "Why do you
try to hide Him from me. He is no one but that Man," and pointed
to the back of the Bab who by then had walked a little distance.

Mulla Husayn pleaded with him to calm down until he could enlighten
him. Mulla Husayn hastened and joined the Bab. When he reported
what Quddus said, the Bab said that in the world of spirit, He
had been communing with that youth, and to go and summon him.

For your information, only three of the disciples or followers
of the Bab during His ministry recognized the identity of
Baha'u'llah.   They were Mulla Husayn, Tahirih and Quddus. All
drank the cup of martyrdom, but their short and extraordinary lives
adorn the pages of history.

Before opening the next chapter in the life of Mulla Husayn, the
following information is timely. Baha'u'llah was two years older
than the Bab, and lived in the capital city of Tehran. His given
name was Mirza Husayn- Ali, the middle son of a prominent and noble
man. The mysterious and spiritual connection between Baha'u'llah
and the Bab, although the two never physically met, is beyond
explanation and our comprehension.

To continue the story, soon after the eighteenth disciple joined
the Letters of the Living, the Bab revealed a tablet for each,
and instructed them to disperse and spread the Word. The first
and the last had the bounty of the greatest honor; one to accompany
Him for pilgrimage to Mecca where He would declare His Cause
publicly, and the other on a special mission to Tehran. I let
you guess for a couple seconds which one He chose to be with Him
on His long journey to Mecca.

One clue might help or mislead you. Do you remember at the night
of His Declaration, the Bab told Mulla Husayn about His oncoming
pilgrimage after the eighteenth person would complete the Letters
of the Living, and Mulla Husayn was counting on being His companion.
Well! The following statement addressed to Mulla Husayn by the
Bab will give us the answer, ''Grieve not that you have not been
chosen to accompany Me on My pilgrimage to Hijaz (meaning Arabia.)
I shall, instead, direct your steps to that city which enshrines
a Mystery of such transcendent holiness as neither Hijaz nor a i r a z
can hope to rival." Hijaz and a i r a z in the last sentence referred
to Islam and the Bab's Faith. Also He had told Mulla Husayn,
"A secret lies hidden in Tehran. When made manifest, it shall
turn the earth into paradise. My hope is that you may partake

of its grace and recognize its splendor." As we shall see, later
Mulla Husayn did recognize Baha'u'llah and partake of His grace.

Mulla Husayn left Shiraz with the assignment to visit a few cities
on his way to ~ e h G n ,and then to proceed to his native province
of Khurasan. The thoughts of "I wish He had chosen me to go to
~ e c c 7or "I wonder what happened that the Bab chose Quddus as
His companion" never troubled Mulla Husayn.    Absolute faith means
absolute submission. May we all attain to some degree of it.

At his first stop in Isfahan, where a few years earlier he had
gained the support of a prominent clergyman for his teacher, the
situation was different. His words not only fell on deaf ears,
but antagonized some fanatics, who fortunately were unable to harm
him. His first convert was the lowly sifter of wheat who was
immortalized by his steadfastness and heroism. Bahalu'llah praises
him in the Kitab-i-Aqdas.

After going through couple more cities and converting a number
of people, he arrived in Tehran, the mysterious city. You should
know that the Bab had sent with Mulla Husayn a package containing
His commentary on the chapter of Joseph to be delivered to the
person for whom it was intended. No name or address on it.
Remember, one of the Babls final words was, "I shall direct your
steps." Mulla Husayn had full confidence in the force which guided
him to Shiraz, and now to the mysterious receiver of the package.
All he had to do was his day-to-day best decisions and leave the
rest to God. If all of us do the same, we will be content and
happier beings.

Well! What better place to lodge than a theological school where
the leader of the -    - community was an instructor. -
Shaykhi                                     -

Shaykhis
were the followers of the two great teachers, -       - Ahmad and

Shaykh
Siyyid Kazim. Visiting the instructor in his room at the school,
Mulla Husayn gave him the news of the advent of the Bab and brought
forth valid arguments and proofs to which the instructor gave
evasive answers. When he found himself at the dead end, he became
abusive by telling Mulla Husayn, "Instead of protecting the best
interests of the followers of Siyyid Kazim, you have betrayed his
cause, and with such subversive claims you easily could destroy
what is left of the -    - community in Tehran."

Shaykhi                           Mulla Husayn
assured him that he had no intention of staying long in Tehran.

During those days of his stay in that city, Mulla Husayn would
leave his room early in the morning and would return after sunset,
keeping a low profile. The Hand of Providence had placed everything
in the right place for the accomplishment of his mission.

There was a man by the name of Mulla Muhammad-i-Mu allim, residing
in that school who was a native of Nur, Baha'u'llah's ancestral
hometown.   Mulla Muhammad was very closely associated with the
arrogant instructor. Matter of fact, his room was next to the
instructor's room, and he had overheard the whole conversation
of Mulla Husayn and the instructor.    Being deeply touched by the
sincerity, fluency and learning of Mulla Husayn, he ventured to
meet Mulla Husayn at the hour of midnight when everyone else was
asleep. He states, "Mulla Husayn did not expect me, but responded
to my knocking at his door and received me with kindness and
courtesy. I found him sitting by a lamp, reading. I was so dis-
appointed and upset with the behavior of my friend, the instructor,
but until that moment I had concealed it. I unburdened my heart
to him, and as I spoke tears flowed from my eyes which I could
not repress."

Mulla Husayn said, "Now I know why I have chosen this school for
lodging." No, the recipient of the package is still a mystery
to Mulla Husayn. He told the visitor, "Your teacher strongly
rejected the message. My hope is that his student may recognize
the truth." Now we are getting close! Mulla Husayn asked him,

\[11\] What is your name?" He answered, "Mulla Muhammad, but I am known
as Mu allim (meaning teacher.)   My home town is Nur in the province
of Mazindaran." Well, well, how perfect!      Mulla Husayn, who had
heard about Baha'u'llah's father who was a famous man of nobility,
became curious. He asked Mu allim, "Tell me, among the family
of the late Mirza Buzurg from Nur has anyone manifested the traits
of that illustrious man?" The answer was, "Yes, among his sons,
one son, Mirza Husayn-Ali, has distinguished himself with such
qualities that characterized his father." He questioned Mu allim
further about that son's position, activities and age. Every answer
caused such a delight in Mulla Husayn which surprised Mu allim.
His face beaming with joy, he asked Mu allim if he saw Mirza Husayn-

Ali often. Mu'allim said he frequently visited their house. Then
Mulla Husayn reached for the scroll, and asked him if he would
deliver it to Mirza Husayn- Ali at the hour of dawn the next day.

As you know from the details in other talks, it was done, and
Baha'u'llah accepted the Faith of the Bab, and sent gifts through
Mu'allim for Mulla Husayn. Upon the return of Mu allim, Mulla
Husayn jumped to his feet and listened to what transpired. With
bowed head, he received the gift and fervently kissed it. Then
he kissed Mu allim's eyes which had beheld the face of the Mystery
which the Bab had alluded to. He asked Mu allim for complete
secrecy about what transpired, lest any harm might come to Mirza
Husayn-'Ali. Mu'allim became a believer, and later on, as one of

Shaykh
the defenders of the Fort -   - Tabarsi, was martyred.

Meanwhile, the Bab had delayed his departure for pilgrimage until
Mulla Husayn's report on this mission reached Him. Mulla Husayn
immediately left for his home province, and from there sent the
report the Bab had been waiting for. The Bab was with Quddus in
Shiraz when He received the letter. With joy, He told Quddus,
"The Cause of God is in capable hands; therefore, we can start
our journey." Such spiritual connection and interaction not only
stagger's one's mind, but also makes us realize the greatness of
the station of Mulla Husayn who was the chosen instrument in the
hands of the Almighty.

His coming that close to Baha'u'llah fortified Mulla Husayn. His
converts in Khurasan were the most learned divines, none of whom
could challenge his arguments. One such influential man dedicated
his home for debates between Mulla Husayn and the divines of
Mashhad, the capital of that province. After the tragic death
of-~ulla Husayn, Quddus appointed this man to become the leader
of the defenders of the Fort which ended with his martyrdom.

While Mulla Husayn was actively teaching in Mashhad a communique
had reached all the Babis from the Bab that H    Ywould return to
Iran by way of Karbila. Such a message brought joy to those who
were in Karbila, such as Tahirih, Mulla Husayn's mother and sister
and others. Other believers, such as Mulla Husayn, took advantage
of it for reunion with their Beloved, the Bab. After all, it had
been a year or more since he saw the Bab. Then a letter from the
Bab reached the believers, that due to circumstances, His plan
was changed and they should all go to Isfahan and wait for further
instructions.

Mulla Husayn, while travelling towards Karbila, did not know about
the new instruction. At one stop, he heard about the change in
plan from believers, and joined them in their travel to Isfahan.
Mulla Husayn advised the large number of believers to enter the
city in small numbers to avoid suspicion and alarm of the
authorities. A few days after their arrival in Isfahan, a shocking
news came that the city of Shiraz was in a state of violent
agitation, and all manner of communication with the Bab was cut
off.   The message warned them about the danger awaiting the

Shiraz.

followers who tried to enter -

Mulla Husayn, quite undaunted by such news, decided to go to g i r a z
and confided his intentions to a few trusted companions. He
discarded his turban and robe and put on layman's clothes and hat.
As he, his brother and nephew were approaching the gate of airaz,
he sent his brother in advance, so at the dead of night he would
reach the Bab's uncle and inform him of Mulla Husayn's arrival.
Several times at night Mulla Husayn attained the presence of the
Bab at His uncle's house.    As you recall, the Bab was under house
arrest at His home which adjoined His uncle's house. As before,
the meetings would last until the daybreak.

Mulla Husayn's layman's disguise worked when passing through the
gate, but he was well-known in the circle of divines, who for three
months had listened eagerly to his inspiring lectures until they
discovered that he was a follower of the Bab.     The clamor of the
people against him intensified to such a degree that the Bab
instructed him to return to his province of -   Khurasan, which he
did.

In Mashhad, the provincial capital, his untiring teaching efforts
brought row upon row of high and low under the banner of the Cause.
Now the winter of 1847 was approaching, nearly three years after
the Declaration of the Bab. The Bab was imprisoned in the fortress
of Mah-Ku, and in Mahhad, Mulla Husayn's prestige and influence
became well-known. During those days, because of corruption and
ineptness of the central government, uprisings of strong men were
common across the country. One such uprising occurred in that
year in -

Khurasan under the leadership of a strong man called Salar.

Soon Mulla Husayn sensed that Salar was planning to approach him

for recruiting him and the rest of the followers in rebellion
against the government. Mulla Husayn's sudden and unannounced
departure from Mashhad took place in the middle of the night when
he and his attendGt, Qambar- Ali, left the city on foot.         They
directed their steps towards Tehran with eventual destination of
the Fortress of Mah-Ku, where the Bab was incarcerated. The next
morning when the believers found him gone, they took the main road
on their horses, and overtook Mulla Husayn.      Seeing him and his
attendant walking, they offered horses and provisions, but he told
them his pledge was to walk those hundreds of miles all the way.

In different towns, Mulla Husayn was enthusiastically received
by the believers.     In Tehran he was visited by Baha'u'llah's
brother, Mirza Musa, who secretly ushered him into the presence
of Baha'u'llah.    Just imagine the joy and palpitation of Mulla
Husayn's heart! His title was Babu'l-Bab, or the gate to the Gate.
He was the first to recognize the Gate, or the Bab. Now he was
going to actually see the Mystery beyond the Gate. He did not
know who his host was when he accompanied the Bab to His house
where the Declaration took place, but this time, he knew who Mirza
Husayn- Ali really was. No doubt Mulla Husayn's knees felt weak
under the immensity of that momentous visit. One can easily assume
that the secrecy of the visit was to keep the identity of
Baha'u'llah concealed. Mulla Husayn, at that time, had the highest
rank among the Babis, and Baha'u'llah was only a distinguished
nobleman. If some believers had been present in that meeting and
had seen Mulla Husayn prostrate at the feet of Baha'u'llah, it
could have prematurely revealed the identity of Baha'u'llah.

Soon after that visit, he and his attendant walked towards
Mah-Ku. The total distance they walked from Mashhad to Mah-Ku was
approximately 900 miles or about 1,500 kilometers. The steep
mountains and mud and snow did not slow them down. The night before
Naw-Ruz of 1848, that memorable year, Ali-Khan, the mellowed warden
of the fortress of Mah-Ku, saw a delighgul dream. He states,
"In my dream I was startled by the sudden message that Muhammad,
the Prophet, was soon to arrive at Mah-Ku, and directly go to the
fortress to visit the Bab, and offer His congratulation on the
advent of Naw-Ruz. With such a message, I ran out to meet Him,
and, at a distance from town, saw two men walking towards me.
I thought one was Muhammad and the other a companion. I bent to

kiss the hem of His garment, when I suddenly woke up. The vividness
of that dream left no doubt that it was a true vision."

Immediately he got up, did his ablution and prayer, put on his
finest attire and perfumed himself. It was before sunrise when
he began to walk to the spot which he had seen in his dream. His
stableman, as instructed, saddled three of his best horses, and
followed him. The sun was just rising when he reached the bridge,
and, with throbbing of his heart, he saw the same two people he
had seen in his dream walking towards him.      He relates, "I fell
on the feet of the one whom I thought was the Prophet and kissed
his feet. I begged him and his companion to mount the horses which
I had prepared for them but the answer was 'No, I have vowed to
accomplish the whole of my journey on foot. I will walk to the
summit of this mountain, and there will visit your Prisoner."'

With this experience, Ali-Khan's devotion to the Bab increased
immensely, and he followed the two on foot. Maybe this was the
first and last climbing for him as he was not used to climbing
the mountain on foot. There, at the gate was a sight to behold.
The Bab was at the gate to receive Mulla Husayn, as if He had
received the message of his arrival. As you have witnessed in
the histories of the Bab and Baha'u'llah, their knowledge was all-
encompassing with no need for physical communication.

Mulla Husayn bowed before his Lord, and stood motionless as the
Bab opened His arms and embraced him. Then the believers staying
in the town were summoned to the chamber to celebrate, in the
presence of the Bab, the fourth Naw-Ruz after His Declaration.
Dishes of cookies and fruit were spread before them which the Bab
Himself handed to the believers one by one. Food from heaven!

Up to that time, only the Bab's scribe and attendant, who were
brothers, were staying day and night with Him. After the mellowing
of the warden, Ali-Khan, through the will of the Bab, the followers
had access to the ~ a c d u r i nthe

~ day. On that Naw-Ruz day, however,
Ali-Khan told the Bab that he had no will of his own, and if the
Bab desired, Mulla Husayn could spend the nights there as well.

One day from the roof of the castle, the Bab looked towards the
west, and as He saw the Araxes River winding its course, He told

Mulla Husayn, "This is the river that the poet Hafiz referred to
a few centuries ago. Didn't he say, ' 0 zephyr! Should you pass
by the river Araxes, kiss the earth and make your breath fragrant."'
Then the Bab stated that by the influence of the Holy Spirit words
such as these flow from the tongue of poets, the significance of
which they themselves oftentime do not comprehend. Then the Bab
referred to another poetry stating, "Shiraz will be thrown into
a tumult, a youth of sugar tongue wil'i-appear. I fear that the
flow of his words will agitate Bahdad." In retrospect we easily
can tell that this was referring to the Declaration of the Bab
in Shiraz and Bahalu'llah in Ba&dad.        However, at that time,
the T a b told Mulla Husayn, "The mystery within this poem is now
concealed. It will be revealed in 1852."       It was in 1852 when
Baha'u'llah received His intimation in the Siyah-gal dungeon,
and in a couple months was exiled to Bahdad.

Another interesting incidence was the wish of Ali-Khan, the warden,
to have the Bab marry his daughter. Ali-Khan h a d a beautiful
daughter whom the crown prince wished to marryas one of his wives.

-
Ali-Khan  did not favor the idea, and said the relatives of his
wife, who were Sunni, would be so furious about that idea that
they immediately would kill him and his daughter. You should know
that in Mah-Ku area, everyone was of the Sunni sect of Islam, a
minority only in Iran and Iraq. The hatred between the two major
sects of Islam, Shi'ih and Sunni, began right after the passing
of Muhammad. The Bab was of the Shi'ih sect, and that was the
reason he was imprisoned there by the prime minister, so no one
would have mercy on Him or His followers.

A number of times he begged the Bab, who was about twenty-eight
years old, to honor him with acceptance, but the Bab did not
consent. Now while the esteemed Mulla Husayn was there, Ali-Khan
asked him to intercede on his behalf. Again the Bab deniedhis
request. His beloved wife, Khadijih Bagum, in Shiraz, was in
constant anxiety, not knowinr what was happeninr to the Bab.
As you recall, on His last day in airaz, arrested by the police,
the Bab was not given the opportunity to say farewell to His wife
or mother.

Well, the final day which was the ninth day after Naw-Ruz, and

- was planning to host
the last hour arrived. No doubt, Ali-Khan

Mulla Husayn in his fine home, and offer his two best horses and
all provisions needed for their comfortable ride home. However,
the Bab told Mulla Husayn these parting words, "You have walked
on foot all the way from your native land, and on foot you shall
return. For the days of your horsemanship are yet to come. You
are destined to exhibit such courage, such skill and heroism as
shall eclipse the mightiest deeds of the heroes of the past. Visit
many towns and cities on My behalf, and convey the expression of
My love to all. From Tehran direct your steps towards Mazindaran
where God's hidden Treasure will be made manifest to you and the
nature of your task will be revealed to you."

Mulla Husayn started out at once, and refused the kind invitation
of Ali-Khan as there was no time to be wasted.         Ali-Khan, the
formerly stone-hearted and ruthless warden, had never experienced
such spiritual light, but he had to be tested. First was the Bab's
refusal to marry his daughter, now Mulla Husayn declined to spend
a few days as his guest, but worse was yet to come in eleven days.
As the Bab had foretold to Mulla Husayn, twenty days after Naw-Ruz
by the order of the desparate prime minister, He was transferred
to a fortress on another mountain.      The ice cold heart of that
tyrant warden within nine months had melted, and while pulsating
with the love of the Bab, it had to break.       Through what other
power except the Holy Spirit, could the Bab have influenced the
people. Matter of fact, the officer in charge of his short transfer
from one fortress to the other became a dedicated believer.      One
can say it was like a miracle, but to attribute a miracle as a
proof of a Manifestation, according to Baha'u'llah, is degrading
His station, so let us obey His injunction and ponder in our hearts.

Mulla Husayn inspired the hearts of the believers on his walk
towards Tehran. There, for the second time, he had the bounty
of attaining the presence of Baha'u'llah.   That was the needed
spiritual charge for his upcoming mission to face the fierce
assaults in the closing months of his life.     All along during
his long walk, his soul was in constant communion, his thoughts
occupied with one question, what would God's hidden Treasure be,
the Treasure which would guide his steps. Hadn't the Bab said,
I'

You will find it in Mazindaran." After Tehran he proceeded to
Mazindaran. The only one he knew there was Quddus, then about
twenty-six years old. Was it possible that during those months

of Quddus's companionship with the Bab, the Bab had given him His
writings for what was yet to unfold?       What could that treasure
be? He had no doubt about its unfoldment before his eyes, but
his legs could not carry him fast enough on the rough roads,
climbing the mountain range north of Tehran. As the slopes towards
the Caspian Sea began, lush vegetation and trees surrounded the
road, and the air was perfumed with various blossoms.            He
approached the city of Babul where Quddus was residing.

Finally, he reached the house of Quddus.   What a sight! The first
and the last Letters of the Living embracing each other. Quddus
affectionately welcomed Mulla Husayn, and washed his blistered
feet with his own hands. That evening Quddus invited the believers
to his house to meet the honorable Mulla Husayn, and hear the glad
tidings of his recent visit to the Bab. As you recall, Quddus
never saw the Bab again after their pilgrimage. The parting words
of the Bab to Quddus three years earlier were, "The hour of
separation has struck, a separation which no reunion will follow,
except in the Kingdom of God in the presence of the King of Glory."
The Bab also assured Quddus that he would attain the presence of
Him Who is the object of our adoration and love, meaning
Baha'u'llah.

As the believers arrived, they found Quddus at the threshold
ushering them into the presence of Mulla Husayn, occupying the
seat of honor. He truly was a fresh spirit to those longing to
hear news of the Bab. After the believers left, Quddus asked Mulla
Husayn if the Bab had sent any of His writings with him. Although
this was the customary treasure that visitors would carry back,
this time the answer was no. Upon hearing this, Quddus handed
a manuscript to Mulla Husayn and asked him to read a few passages.
As soon as Mulla Husayn had read a page, a sudden change of
admiration and surprise appeared on his face. With utmost praise,
he laid the manuscript down and said, "This is way beyond ordinary
learning." Soon, from the silence of Quddus when questioned about
the writer, Mulla Husayn realized that his host, Quddus, was the
writer. Mulla Husayn arose, and with bowed head declared, "The
Hidden Treasure lies before my eyes. Though my Master is confined
in a fortress on the mountaintop, I find the reflection of His
light in you. "

Mulla Husayn, that matchless man of great learning, with the highest
station, well-respected by all , knew how his learning was nothing
when he saw the Bab on the day of His Declaration, and now again
disregarding his own seniority and erudition, appreciated the
significance of God-given virtues and knowledge manifested in
Quddus. He pledged his undying loyalty to Quddus who so powerfully
mirrored forth the radiance of the Bab. The remaining months of
Mulla Husayn's life were spent in obedience to Quddus, constantly
striving to ensure his safety and welfare.

How fascinating to see the absence of ego, pride and arrogance
in those chosen ones of God. May we strive to attain some degree
of it. As the essence of greatness is humility, Mulla Husayn was
the embodiment of it. The next morning when the believers came
to visit, to their surprise, they saw the honorable Mulla Husayn
standing at the threshold in an attitude of humility, and Quddus
was in the seat of honor. The first assignment given to Mulla
Husayn, in the presence of the assembled believers, was to pay
a visit to the notorious and tyrant divine, Sa idu'l-Ulama, a bitter
and vocal enemy of the Cause, and try to open his eyes to the truth
of the Cause. Then Mulla Husayn should proceed to Khurasan, his
home province, and in Ma&had,   its capital, build a h G s e for both
a private residence and to serve as a teaching center.

The next day at dawn Mulla Husayn visited that arrogant priest,
who in learning was no match to the great ones Mulla Husayn had
challenged a few years earlier. Before the assemblage of the
divine's disciples, Mulla Husayn defeated every argument which
he presented to refute the truth of the Cause. Fearful that all
of his disciples should unanimously rally around Mulla Husayn,
he stooped to the meanest device of foul and abusive language.
Mulla Husayn, having done his duty, left with these words, "My
deeds will, in the days to come, prove to you the power of the
Message you have chosen to despise." The divine became speechless
and utterly confounded.

Mulla Husayn immediately left for Maahad, and soon bought a piece
of land on which he built a house, and gave it the name llBabiyyih."
Shortly after it was completed, as promised, Quddus arrived in
Mashhad, and together they lived in that house. A steady stream
ofTisitors whom Mulla Husayn had prepared for the acceptance of

the Cause, poured in to attain the presence of Quddus, and
acknowledging the truth of the Cause, willingly enlisted under
its banner. The combination of the efforts of these two greatest
stars of the Faith brought ever-increasing number of believers
into the fold, and gave rise to a wave of enthusiasm which swept
over the entire city of Mashhad, with its effect spreading rapidly
beyond the province. The Babiyyih house became a rallying center
for a multitude, fired with the love of the Bab. Well, friends,
such an achievement is not beyond our reach.          May we arise
resolutely, and with trust in Baha'u'llah's unfailing assistance,
raise such centers and make each city or town another Mahhad.

Now the summer of 1848 is approaching, with excitement filling
the air.    To name a few major events, there was the Bab's
examination in Tabriz in front of the leading divines and the crown
prince, where He boldly pronounced, "I am, I am, I am the promised
Qa'im," eliminating any doubt as to His claim. Another one, the
conference of Badasht, hosted by Baha'u'llah,           where Tahirih
appeared without a veil, and under Baha ' u ' llah ' s leadership, all
ties with Islam were torn away. And, of course, the remarkable
events in Fort -    - Tabarsi. The first two events are mentioned

Shaykh
in other talks, but this one is all about the indomitable Mulla
Husayn and the defenders of -   - Tabarsi.

Shaykh

Such fervor and enthusiasm in the city of Mashhad could not escape
the attention of the clergy and the authoritiG who became alarmed.
Its prolongation could have meant total conversion of the holy
city of Mashhad, the province of -Khurasan, and, who knows, probably
the whole yountry and beyond.      It had to be checked at once.
Unfortunately, for ages, new concepts and ideas have always been
faced with physical suppression which ultimately fails.

To intimidate Mulla Husayn, the police chief decided to deliver
a severe blow to him and the followers as a warning to curb their
activities. His men arrested Mulla Husayn's servant, called Hasan,
pierced his nose, pulled a cord through the hole and with that
halter, paraded him on the streets with jubilant mob following
and cheering. Hearing about such insult, the indignation and rage
of the followers knew no bounds.    Mulla Husayn, quite concerned
about the reaction of the new believers and the serious
consequences, tried to reason with them and calm them, but to no

avail. The first group of followers, heading to rescue Hasan,
raised the cry of "Ya Sahibu'z-Zaman," meaning 0 Lord of the Age,
referring to the Qa'im.    This was the first cry which would be
repeated numerous times in the months ahead....          Their cry
reverberated in the city, and soon cries from various corners shook
the people. In a short time, Hasan was rescued and the enemies
were struck down.

You remember from earlier part of this talk that the rebellious
Salar wished to recruit Mulla Husayn and his men, which was a
reason for his leaving on foot to see the Bab.   Well! That uprising
was put down by Prince Hamzih Mirza, the governor general of
-
Khurasan, whose camp was still standing in the outskirts of Mashhad,
ready to act. Hearing all about what happened that day could not
be tolerated by the prince, who decided to nip it in the bud.
He issued an order for immediate arrest of Mulla Husayn and to
be brought to his presence. A little too strong! The prince had
witnessed heavy bloodshed ending Salar's uprising.      Now, no one
could be spared in order to keep peace and quiet.

Could the prince's act be considered rash, or was it guided by
the Hand of Providence? The captain of the prince's artillery,
a badly needed man, became the instrument. His name, which history
shall remember, was Abdu'l-'Ali Khan Marahiyi.        He told the
prince, "I consider myself a devoted admirer of Mulla Husayn.
You should take my life before contemplating any harm or even
disrespect to him. " The prince, greatly embarrassed, said, "I,
too, have met Mulla Husayn and cherish the utmost devotion to him.
All I wish to do is to quiet the unrest while protecting his
person."   Then the prince, in his own handwriting, wrote an
invitation to Mulla Husayn, and ordered his own ornamented tent
to be raised for the reception of his guest.

When the letter was delivered to Mulla Husayn, he read it and handed
it to Quddus for his advice. Quddus said, "Accept the invitation,
but for myself, tonight I will leave Mashhad   for my home province
of Mazindaran. By God's will you, too, later on at the head of
a large3 company of the believers, under the Black Standard, will
leave Mashhad to join me. " The mysterious interconnection here
is fascinating. In those days telegram and instant electronic
communications were not available, but the world of spirit

superceded them all.   When Quddus said those words about the Black
Standard, a messenger had already left the fortress of Chihriq,
where the Bab was imprisoned hundreds of miles away, with the same
message from the Bab to Mulla Husayn.

As the course of history shows, Quddus was informed about
Baha'u'llah's intention to go to the resort village of Badasht,
and therefore he joined Baha'u'llah and Tahirih there.

Prince Hamzih Mirza, in whose camp Mulla Husayn was graciously
hosted, later became the governor general of Adhirbayjan and refused
the order to execute the Bab. He was an honorxle man.

It was in July of 1848, when after a short stay, Mulla Husayn left
the camp with a plan that in one week he was to proceed to Karbila.
The prince offered money for his expenses which he declined, asking
the prince to spend it on the poor. The devoted captain of the
artillery, Abdu'l-'Ali Khan, also expressed eagerness to pay for
the expenses of Mulla ~ y s a ~and

n whoever he decided to take with
him. Also, he sent a sword and a horse as a gift.      Mulla Husayn
declined the money, but kept the sword and the horse. This sword
became the most unique in history, and the horse, practically
indestructible. With Mulla Husayn's fame and popularity, his house
was besieged by eager people wishing the honor of accompanying
him.

Suddenly, the explicit command from the Bab in the mountain prison
arrived. A messenger from the Bab arrived bringing the Bab's own
turban and the new name of Siyyid Ali for Mulla Husayn with this
message, "Adorn your head with My green turban, the emblem of My
lineage, and with the Black Standard unfurled before you, hasten
to Mazindaran and lend your assistance to My beloved Quddus."
You see, Quddus at that time was at Badasht, but the Bab, weeks
before, knew that Quddus soon would be arrested and confined.
What else except the all-encompassing knowledge of a Manifestation
of God!

Mulla Husayn, at once, arose to execute the wishes of his Master.
He left Maahad, and, a few miles away from the city, hoisted the
Black Standard, put his Master's turban on his head, and gave the
signal to his two hundred and two companions to march towards

for the great trials ahead should return now."  At another stopping
point he gave stronger warning with these words, "I, with seventy-
two of my companions, shall suffer death for the sake of the
Well-Beloved." Twenty of those men chose to return.

Another time he told his companions, "Leave behind all your
belongings except your swords and horses, so all may witness that
you have no desire for your property, or that of others." The
allegiance of the men was unconditional, and their obedience without
hesitation. The father of Badi who had a small sack of choicest
turquoise opened it, and flung the precious stones on the roadside.
The rest followed his example.

As you shall see, the number of companions increased to over three
hundred, because after the conference of Badasht, most of the
participants joined Mulla Husayn.

You might wonder why they had a black flag waving over their heads.
There is a prophecy from Muhammad which states, "Should you see
the Black Standard proceed from Burasan, hasten to it, even if
you have to crawl on snow, because it proclaims the advent of the
Promised One."   It is awesome to realize that Muhammad appeared
in Arabia more than twelve hundred years earlier when Iran was
an independent, prosperous nation enjoying the prestige of the
Sassanid Dynasty. At that time, no one could fathom its defeat
by the nomads of Arabia under the banner of Islam, and yet Muhammad
mentioned the Black Standard from -

Khurasan, a province in Iran.

You need to know that soon after the conference of Badakt, Tahirih
was arrested and sent to Tehran, and Quddus was captured and
confined at the house of the leading clergy in the city of Sari.

The mandate the Bab gave to Mulla Husayn stated, "Go to the
assistance of My beloved Quddus." Obviously by this time, Mulla
Husayn had learned about the confinement of Quddus in Sari, and
that was where he and his companions were heading. They had to
bypass Quddus's home town of Babul.

The news of their approach to Babul alarmed the notorious Sa'idu'l-
Ulama who was in a rage. The popularity of Mulla Husayn in Mashhad,
the discipline and large number of his companions under the-lack

Mazindaran.   That memorable date was July 21, 1848, when it all
began.

Wherever they stayed or passed through, fearlessly the message
of the New Day was proclaimed, which brought new recruits, and
selected people joined them. The father of Badi, who was a notable
merchant and the son of the prestigious owner of the choicest
turquoise mine, also enlisted under the banner of Mulla Husayn.
The story of Badi and his father are recounted separately in the
talk titled "The Mystery of Martyrdom." It is easy to say he joined
Mulla Husayn, but only the fire of love and understanding was
capable of detaching him from all worldly honors, wealth, and
material comfort to take that step towards a destination, the altar
of sacrifice.

Arriving at a place where the road divided, Mulla Husayn decided
to camp for a few days. They used the shade of a very large tree
by a running stream.     He told his companions, "We shall await
the Bab's decree as to which road to take."    It was on the fourth
day of September when a fierce gale struck down a large branch
of that tree, whereupon Mulla Husayn said, "The tree of the
sovereignty of Muhammad Shah was uprooted." Three days later a
messenger, on his way to Mashhad, reported the death of the king.
The next day the company mounted their horses.

Well, friends, the name of this game is not fame or fortune. The
road's name is submission; its color, scarlet; and the destination,
the sacred altar of sacrifice. The mystery of the mission, not
simply the rescue of Quddus, but to leave an imperishable lustre
on the pages of history about the literal force released by the
power of the Holy Spirit. And, finally the most critical, the
demand on those who took the road, an absolute and unshakeable
conviction....   Are you ready to take the road, or rather watch
those heroes through this window?

Leading the men, Mulla Husayn pointed in the direction of
Mazindaran, and said, "This is the way that leads to our Karbila."
For your information, the desert of Karbila was the site where
Imam Husayn and seventy-two companions were defeated by Sunnis
and brutally martyred.  It happened more than ten centuries before.
Then Mulla Husayn repeated several times, "Whoever is unprepared

Standard, were more than he could bear. So he dispatched criers
to call all the people of Babul to attend the mosque for a vital
and crucial announcement. An immense crowd of men and women packed
the mosque. The fiend climbed to the pulpit, flung his turban
on the ground, and tore open the neck of his shirt.    He shouted,
"Wake up! The wreckers of Islam are coming to our very doors to
wipe out all that we cherish as pure and holy in Islam.      It is
your sacred duty that tomorrow at dawn, fully armed, confront them
on the road, and exterminate them all."

The next day a few miles from Babul, Mulla Husayn and company
encountered their enemies blocking the road. The multitude was
fully equipped with arms and ammunition. The fierce expression
of their faces and their foul language indicated their hostile
and savage mood.

You can set the stage in your mind. Three hundred horsemen against
a hostile crowd stretching as far as they could see. The companions
reached for their swords, but Mulla Husayn commanded, "Not yet."
He barely had given that order when the enemy began to fire at
them. The companions became restless as six of them were hurled
to the ground. Mulla Husayn told them, "The time has not yet come,
the number is as yet incomplete." When a bullet pierced the chest
of one of his devoted supporters who had walked all the way by
his horse, Mulla Husayn raised his eyes to heaven and prayed, ending
with these words, "I now arise with my companions to defend our
lives against the assaults of the enemy."

It was as if Mulla Husayn was awaiting the countdown before the
Holy Spirit blessed him with that mysterious superhuman power.
He drew his sword and charged his horse into the midst of the
crowd and downpour of bullets to pursue the man who shot the last
companion. This man took refuge behind a tree, holding his musket
gun to shield himself. With a single stroke of his sword, he cut
across the tree, the barrel of the gun, and the body of that man.
This is the truth, without exaggeration. When later the commander
of the large royal army suffered a disgraceful defeat at the hands
of a small band of Babis, and was reprimanded by the prime minister,
he sent the half of the barrel of the gun cut by Mulla Husayn's
sword, stating, "These are the kind of people our forces had to
face." The prime minister, dumbfounded by receiving that evidence,

realized that even their cannon power was unable to break what
he called a "handful of young and contemptible students."
Therefore, he stooped to treachery and fraud to destroy them.
The story of that shameful betrayal will shock the world.

Anyway, the crowd witnessing that force, panic-stricken, fled and
scattered out of sight into the forest.      The forementioned force
of Mulla Husayn has also been reported by non-Baha'i historians
who tried to minimize it by claiming that Mulla Husayn had excessive
training in the use of sword and horsemanship during his youth.
For your information, Mulla Husayn, a student of theology, spent
his years acquiring true knowledge. His mastery, which won the
admiration of the leading divines, even while a student, was his
deep knowledge and sincerity of his expression.

According to a childhood friend, Mirza Muhammad-i-Furuai, who
also fought shoulder to shoulder with him, but miraculously survived
the final massacre, the weight of a pen was too much for the frail
Mulla Husayn. Furu&i     relates, "I have known Mulla Husayn from
childhood. I have never known him to be possessed of such strength.
I even considered myself superior in strength. His hand trembled
as he wrote, and he often expressed his inability to write as fully
and as frequently as he wished. He was greatly handicapped in
this respect, and he continued to suffer from its effect until
his journey to Mazindaran. The moment he drew his sword to repulse
that hostile crowd, a mysterious power seemed to have suddenly
transformed him. He always was the first one to spring forward
on his charger to face the combined forces of the opponent, and
achieve the victory. His name, alone, was sufficient to strike
terror into the hearts of the enemy, who panicked and fled. We,
the companions, all were convinced that he had ceased to be the
same Mulla Husayn we knew."

Furu&i   continues, "Mulla Husayn, after that memorable blow,
disappeared from our sight. His attendant, who had followed him,
later related that Mulla Husayn charged forward amidst the multitude
of enemies, with bullets raining from all directions, and with
strokes of his sword, he mowed down whoever was in his way ." He
headed unharmed for the city of Babul, and straight to the home
of that despicable fiend, Sa'idu'l-Ulama.      Mulla Husayn circled
his house three times and cried out, "Let the coward who incited

the holy war against us come out, and by example prove the sincerity
of his appeal and the righteousness of his cause. Has he forgotten
the requirement for the one who declares a holy war to be at the
forefront of his followers?"    What a sight!

Soon the inhabitants surrounded Mulla Husayn, and begged for peace.
At this moment, the followers were galloping towards Mulla Husayn.
The cry of "Ya Sahibu'z-Zaman, shouted at the top of their voices,
struck fear into the hearts of everyone. Heaven knows in what
hole in his house that frightened mouse was hiding. When the
followers saw Mulla Husayn unhurt, with a feeling of joy, they
dismounted and kissed his stirrups.     Now it was in the afternoon
when Mulla Husayn granted peace, telling the crowd, "Now you witness
the ascendancy of the Faith of God. Except for a scratch on my
face, I and my horse were protected by God from your brutal attack."

None of the companions had anything to eat or drink since dawn.
Mulla Husayn led his men to a caravanserai. He sent a few men
to get water and bread, but they came back empty-handed. They
were denied both. Mulla Husayn assured them to put their trust
in God, and ordered the gates of the caravanserai closed.

As the hour of sunset approached, he asked one of the companions
to go on the roof and chant the customary call for prayer, called
Adhzan. A youth gladly responded. No sooner had he uttered the
£=st words, he fell by the fire of the enemy.    Mulla Husayn said,
"Let another one among you arise and finish the Adhan." Another
youth chanted a few more words, and suffered the same   .  When the
third youth finished the call, he also was struck down.

Mulla Husayn ordered the gates opened. Leaping on horseback, he
and his companions mowed down the assailants outside the gate,
and made them disappear. No doubt left in their minds, the notables
of the city, with the Qur'an in their hands, walked towards Mulla
Husayn, who still was on his horse. They begged for mercy, and
asked Mulla Husayn to permit them to say a few words. Mulla Husayn,
observing their sincerity, dismounted his horse and invited them
to sit with him, and ordered tea for them which none of the
companions yet had. Mulla Husayn said, "We, unlike the people
of this town, know how to receive the stranger."      The notables
blamed everything on the notorious divine, and requested that by

morning they leave for the next town. Then two of them arose,
and swearing by the Qur'an which they brought, declared their
intention to regard them as their guests that night, and the next
day under heavy guard they would be escorted to the next town.

The attendants of the notables had already gone to fetch food for
the companions and feed for their horses. The clock registered
four hours after sunset when the companions, by permission of Mulla
Husayn, broke their fast.   That had been a long day, only an intro-
duction to what was yet to come.

At midnight, that cowardly divine summoned the commander of one
hundred guardsmen. His name was Khusraw. He confided in him that
at any time or place which he found right he must massacre the
Babis, leaving no one alive to tell the story.   Khusraw obected
to the plot, and said that these are godly peoplewho sacrificed
three people trying to say the call to prayer.     The shameless
man said, "I command you to slay them. The matters of religion
are for me to decide. I will stand answerable at the day of
judgment."
The sun anxiously arose to witness another eventful and exciting
day. The notables summoned Khusraw and told him that he must
exercise utmost considerationa n d courtesy towards Mulla Husayn
and his men, and refuse any reward. He pretended total submission,
and assured them that he would bring a written note from Mulla
Husayn as to his satisfaction about his services.    The notables
took Khusraw and his men to the caravanserai to introduce them
to ~ul% Husayn.

Mulla Husayn told Khusraw, "If you do well, great shall be your
reward, but if you a c t treacherously, severe will be your punish-
ment. We commit our Cause only to God, and are wholly resigned
to His will." Mulla Husayn mounted the charger, and gave the signal
for departure. His attendant, the one who had walked with him
all the way to Mah-Ku, raised the call of his master, "Mount your
steeds, 0 heroes of God!" a summons which would be raised over
and over in the months to follow.

To implement his plan, Khusraw took them through forest. On that
narrow road a few guardswere in front, followed by Mulla Husayn
and    Khusraw riding side by side. As soon as the forest was

Khusraw gave the code signal which was relayed to the
guards at the tail end of the long line of the horsemen. Soon
a few of the Babis were killed, and some captured.       As soon as
the cry of agony reached Mulla Husayn's ears, he halted, dismounted
and protested Khusrawls treacherous behavior.    Mulla Husayn said,

\[11\] It is way pasrnoon, and yet there is no sign of our destination
which you promised us to reach at noon. I refuse to go any farther
with you, and can dispense with your guidance and men."        Then
Mulla Husayn told his attendant to spread his prayer-mat. Khusraw
had also dismounted his horse.      As Mulla Husayn was doi! his
ablution, Khusraw told one of his men to tell Mulla Husayn that
if he wishTd to reach his destination he should deliver to him
his sword and horse. Mulla Husayn received the message, but refused
to answer and proceeded to offer his prayer.

Meanwhile, one of the companions, a man of erudition and courage,
sensed the intrigue. He went to one of the attendants of Khusraw,
who was preparing the water-pipe for &usraw, and asked if he could
have the honor of taking it to &usraw.       He took the water-pipe
to Khusraw who was resting by a tree. Pretending to bend and fix
thecharcoal, he swiftly pulled out &usraw1s dagger, and killed
him on the spot. Mulla Husayn was still in prayer when the cry
of "Ya Sahibu'z-Zaman" was raised again, and in a short time all
of the guards who were fully equipped with guns were struck down.
The attendant of -

Khusraw, who had given the water-pipe to a follower
of Mulla Husayn, threw himself at the feet of Mulla Husayn, begging
to be spared. Mulla Husayn accepted his plea and said, "One should
live to tell the story."     He kindly gave him the jewel-studded
water-pipe of Khusraw, and told him to tell the notables that
Khusraw had foolishly demanded his sword and horse, not realizing
that their work had just begun.

As the night was approaching, they camped in an open spot nearby.
Next sunrise Mulla Husayn told his men, "We are approaching our
Karbila," which they understood its meaning. It meant the altar
of sacrifice. When he saw some men carrying belongings of Busraw
and his fallen men, he instructed them to discard them. He took
a road no one was familiar with, but they all followed him on foot,
leading their horses. In half an hour they reached the shrine
of an Islamic saint called -    - Tabarsi. His resting place for
centuries has been reverently visited by Moslems of the area.

You will find its photo on the insert with the photo of the famous
sword of Mulla Husayn. The shrine is about fourteen miles or
twenty-two kilometers from Babul where the road block was made.

The night before their arrival the custodian or caretaker of the
shrine saw a very revealing dream. In it, he saw Imam Husayn,
the third Imam, martyred centuries ago with seventy-two warriors,
arrive at -    - Tabarsi with a number of companions. He saw Imam
Husayn engaged in most heroic battles there, triumphant every time;
and, to the custodian's amazement, Muhammad, the Prophet, Himself,
the maternal grandfather of Imam Husayn, joined them at the shrine.

Mulla Husayn, all along, had been praying for his steps to be
guided, and here was the answer. The custodian at once recognized
him as the hero in his dream, so he threw himself on his feet and
kissed them. Somewhat startled about such a welcome, Mulla Husayn
asked him to sit by his side, and listened to him relate his dream.
Mulla Husayn told him, "All that you saw in your dream will come
to pass, and the glorious scenes will be enacted." The custodian
begged Mulla Husayn to be accepted as one of his companions, and
eventually he was martyred there.

On the day of their arrival, Mulla Husayn gave instructions to
the notable believer, who had built the Babiyyih in Maahad, to
start plans for building a fort for their defense. They already
were attacked twice, and nearly ambushed by the guards. The future
was clear and ominous to Mulla Husayn who had come so close to
rescue Quddus, but it wasn't to be a simple operation.

As the evening approached, they found themselves surrounded by
a multitude of horsemen preparing to open fire upon them. They
claimed to be inhabitants of the home village of Khusraw, the
treacherous guard commander, and they had come to avenge his blood.
The companions drew their swords again in self-defense, raising
the cry of "Ya Sahibu'z-Zaman" and leaped onto their horses. So
tremendous was the shout that the horsemen vanished as suddenly
as they had appeared from the forest.     This defense was led by
a companion who requested the honor from Mulla Husayn.      Fearing
the return of the enemy, they pursued them until they reached a
village which they thought was -

Khusraw's village.   In the darkness
of the night and with the confusion that ensued, the mother of
the owner of the village was accidentally killed.         Soon the
companions learned that it was not the village of Kusraw.       The
leader ordered a halt, and when he ascertained that he and his
men were led to the wrong village, he became agitated. His distress
mounted when he heard about the death of the mother of Nazar m a n ,
the owner of that village. This was quite heavy on his mind.
The companions kept apologizing for the unfortunate mistake, but
the leader decided to go to the home of Nazar &an        to explain
everything, and by assuming the responsibility, offered himself
to take any punishment. After all, the honor of Mulla Husayn and
the rest of the followers of the Bab was at stake.

Before I tell you how everything was destined to happen for the
unfolding of this drama, a clarifying comment is necessary. By
hearing some of the details of this episode, some, particularly
in the West, might consider the companions as a bunch of wild and
sword-happy hoodlums who had fun engaging in war under the name
of religion. No, not at all. Mulla Husayn and his companions
were clerics, craftsmen, merchants and the like. They were more
familiar with pen and paper than sword and horse. Carrying a sword
in those days in Islamic tradition was not unusual, particularly
when going on a mission and riding a horse. The Bab's Faith in
its fourth year had not forbidden the use of sword in self-defense,
but in 1863 Baha'u'llah, on the day of His Declaration, forbade
it. Lastly, at no time did these defenders attack offensively
to gain property or territory.

Only when they felt dangerously hemmed in, they unleashed their
forces and repulsed the enemy. Matter of fact, during the siege
of the fort at a later time, Quddus told the defenders that with
the ascendency they had demonstrated over the massive royal army,
people of that area were seeing the power of their Cause, and
becoming willing to join them. He said that if he wished to
declare a holy war, without doubt, they could conquer the whole
country and beyond, but theirs was only to defend themselves against
the onslaught of the enemy, and promote the Cause of God.

As the story unfolds, one cannot believe how intertwined the events
were. You see, Mulla Husayn, on the day of their arrival at the
shrine, instructed a believer to start building a fort.        They

had discarded all their valuables at the beginning of the journey.

To build a fort for protection as the first step, even before
thinking of rescuing Quddus, was a big undertaking, particularly
when they had no money, food or other provisions.     What they had
was the most important asset, and that was their trust in God.

The last event in the story was that night when the leader of the
companions went to the home of Nazar Khan, the owner of that
village. He explained to Nazar Khan what had transpired, including
the treachery of nusraw, and horthe people from his village were
trying to avenge his blood. Although grief-stricken about his
mother's death, Nazar &an  was so moved by what he heard that he
invited the leader to spend the night at his home, and the next
day take him to meet Mulla Husayn.  He also showed great interest
to learn about a Cause which could enkindle such fervor in the
hearts of its followers.

At the hour of dawn, the leader, accompanied by Nazar Khan, arrived
at the shrine, and found Mulla Husayn leading the congregational
prayer. Nazar m a n , without hesitation, joined the worshippers,
and repeated every prayer that Mulla Husayn uttered. Now the leader
had to tell Mulla Husayn about the tragic death of Nazar Khan's
mother.   Mulla Husayn expressed deepest sympathy on beha-        of
himself and all the followers to Nazar Khan. Just a few words
from Mulla Husayn transformed Nazar Khan to the point that he told
Mulla Husayn, "Had I one hundred so%,     all of whom I would have
joyously placed at your feet as a sacrifice to the promised Qa'im."
He pledged his undying loyalty to Mulla Husayn, and rushed home
to return with whatever provisions were needed.

Amazing, how submission to the will of God works.       One should
do his best, but resign to the will of God, and be content with
the outcome. The best wealth is that of happiness and contentment.

One wonders how those three hundred men, having no architect,
engineer or power tools, built a fort within a span of two months
which could sustain the poundings of the army.       To add to the
obstacles was the shorter days of fall which retarded drying of
the mud used between the trunks of the trees. But everything worked
like clockwork. The worst obstacle, which could have been the
interference of the armed forces, was resolved by a major crisis

in the capital, Tehran. In those countries, the transfer of power
did not and does not take place smoothly. After the death of the
king, the power struggle of ambitious princes and politicians had
to take place before the crown prince could claim the throne.
The dust finally settled on October 20 1848, when the coronation
of the young king, less than twenty, took place.

While constructing the fortress, the annoyance of hostile acts
of nearby villagers riled up by the enraged divine had to be dealt
with by a flyswatter. No doubt, the strenuous and long hours of
labor strengthened those determined arms for the critical days
ahead.    The construction progressed well.      As it was near
completion, one day a believer arrived with the marvelous news
that Baha'u'llah and Nazar Khan would be arriving in the afternoon,
and Baha'u'llah had invitz everyone for dinner that evening.
Furu&i,   who survived the final massacre, related that he saw a
beaming joy on Mulla Husayn's face upon hearing of the arrival
of Baha'u'llah, but Furu&i  had not recognized the station of that
nobleman.

Under Mulla Husayn's instruction, everyone frantically began to
tidy up the place and themselves for the reception of Baha'u'llah,
and even Mulla Husayn himself joined them in sweeping and sprinkling
water on the approaches to the shrine. As soon as Mulla Husayn
saw Baha'u'llah approaching, he rushed forward, embraced Him and
conducted Him with reverence to the seat of honor. Furu&i    states,
1'

The rest of us were too blind in those days to recognize the One
Whom our commander treated with such love and humility. Mulla
Husayn was so lost in admiration that he became totally oblivious
of the three hundred of us standing waiting for permission to sit
down. It was Baha'u'llah Himself who finally permitted us to sit
down. "

Baha'u'llah, in the course of that visit, inspected the fort and
expressed his satisfaction with the work, and then said, "The only
thing missing is the presence of Quddus which would make the fort
complete and the company perfect."    Baha'u'llah instructed Mulla
Husayn to send a certain believer with six men to Sari to demand
Quddus's release from confinement. After supper, Baha'u'llah left
the fort, counseling them to be resigned to the will of God. Then
He stated that, God willing, He would visit them again, and come
to their assistance.

Mulla Husayn, a t o n c e , s e n t t h e s e v e n men t o S a r i f o r t h e release

Mulla Husayn's message, h e u n c o n d i t i o n a l l y honored t h e i r r e q u e s t .
The name of Mulla Husayn had t o t a l l y disarmed him.                         He s a i d , "I

Here comes one t o u c h i n g p a r t of t h e s t o r y . Mulla Husayn, t h e s u p e r -
human commander, g a t h e r e d h i s men t o p r e p a r e them f o r Quddus whose
s t a t i o n was n o t known t o them. He t o l d them, "You s h o u l d o b s e r v e

c o n v e r t s from Islam and were used t o s u c h e x p r e s s i o n s of r e v e r e n c e .

The news of t h e impending a r r i v a l of Quddus b r o u g h t a j o y f u l
t i d i n g s , r e l e a s i n g added s t r e n g t h and courage.       You c a n f e e l t h e

enveloped t h e f o r t and t h e f o r e s t .           Mulla Husayn gave two c a n d l e s
t o e a c h f o l l o w e r and l i t them h i m s e l f , and t o l d them t o proceed
and g r e e t Quddus.              They surrounded Quddus on h i s h o r s e , and on
f o o t f o l l o w e d him t o t h e f o r t w h i l e c h a n t i n g t h e hymn o f
g l o r i f i c a t i o n , "Holy, h o l y , t h e Lord o u r God, t h e Lord of t h e a n g e l s

which t h e company r e s p o n d e d , and it echoed t h r o u g h o u t t h e f o r e s t .

Some of Quddus's w r i t i n g s were r e a d t o t h e companions.                                      His
r e v e r e n c e t o t h e Bab and T a h i r i h were e a s y t o u n d e r s t a n d by t h e
b e l i e v e r s , b u t h i s p r a i s e of B a h a ' u ' l l a h was n o t a p p r e c i a t e d s i n c e
B a h a ' u ' l l a h appeared i n t h e r i c h g a r b of t h e n o b i l i t y .                  Being
r i c h was n o t a n a d m i r a b l e q u a l i t y i n t h e i r t r a d i t i o n .

The n e x t morning Quddus asked Mulla Husayn f o r a head c o u n t .                               Mulla

Husayn ordered every one out of the fort, and when they returned,
he counted them. The total, including himself and Quddus, came
to three hundred and twelve. Before the gate was closed, Mulla
Husayn heard a youth running in the distance and calling. He had
come all the way from Babul, and flung himself at the feet of Mulla
Husayn, pleading to be accepted as one of the companions. His
wish was granted, and the number rose to three hundred thirteen.
When Quddus was informed about the result of the head count, he
made a reference to a prophecy from Muhammad regarding the
assemblage of three hundred thirteen chosen ones as a sign of the
advent of the promised Qa'im.

The knowledge and resourcefulness of Quddus gradually removed the
doubts of the companions who still considered Mulla Husayn of higher
station. Many times in the middle of the night, Mulla Husayn was
seen to circle around where Quddus was sleeping, and utter words
of praise.    Quddus's new writings were regularly read to the
companions which filled them with wonder, and justified his
leadership in their limited minds.

With the fort completed, some curious and friendly visitors were
permitted in. They marvelled at what was done in such a short
time. Through word of mouth, the depraved divine of Babul heard
of its praise and smouldered with jealousy.   He constantly preached
to the neighboring villagers to refuse to sell provisions to them,
which some did. He also sent a petition to the young king for
the elimination of what, in strong language, he called a menace
and a threat to the throne. He could not tolerate the Black
Standard raised above the fort, the banner which had been hoisted
in Mashhad in July 1848, and waved continually above the heads
of those heroes for eleven months until May 1849.

The young king referred the matters to the officers in the province
of Mazindaran where the fort was. They reported back to the king
that the handful of frail-bodied students would require only a
fraction of the army that his majesty had contemplated. They
maintained that the men in the fort were utterly unworthy of the
king's concern and consideration, and that a small detachment of
the army could easily wipe them out within two days.      The king
agreed, and assigned an officer to recruit whatever was necessary
for the simple job. Trying to impress his king, in a short time

that officer put together an army of twelve thousand men equipped
with guns and necessary ammunition. They camped at the village
of Nazar Khan overlooking the fort. They stopped any traffic in
and out ofthe fort.

With such control, soon a shortage of bread and water prevailed.
At sunset Quddus and Mulla Husayn were viewing the army barricades
outside the fort. Quddus told Mulla Husayn, "God willing, this
very night a downpour of rain followed by heavy snowfall will assist
us to repulse their contemplated assault." It exactly happened.
It ruined the enemy's gunpowder supply, and the combination of
rain and snow supplied the companions with adequate water for a
long time. The snowfall was unusual for that season, and was so
heavy, the like of which that region had never experienced even
in the depth of winter. Friends, if so far you have not seen
the Hand of Providence at work, in the course of the coming events,
you shall.

The date was December lst, 1848, when Quddus decided to scatter
the enemy which was preparing for attack. Two hours after sunrise,
Quddus, flanked by Mulla Husayn, on their horses, led the companions
on foot through the gates of the fort with the cry of "Ya Sahibu'z-
Zaman." The roar of their voices and the glitter of their drawn
swords stunned the armed soldiers who, panic-stricken, scattered
in every direction. Those who stayed were put to blade. Within
forty-five minutes the shout of victory was raised. Within that
short span of time, the army commander, two of his officers, and
four hundred thirty soldiers had perished. Not a single casualty
among the companions. Only one man was wounded. As commanded,
they only took the swords and horses of the fallen, ignoring the
valuables.

Quddus ordered his men to dig a moat around the fort as a safeguard
against any future attack, which took them nineteen days to
complete. It was during this first siege of the fort by the army
that Baha'u'llah's attempt to join them ended in His arrest and
being bastinadoed, which means the beating the soles of the feet.
It definitely was not God's will for Him to reach the fort.
Do you remember His parting words were "if it be God's will, I
will visit the fort again, and come to your assistance." You will
know why it was not God's will when you hear the ending.

Soon a f t e r t h e moat was dug, t h e news a r r i v e d t h a t a p r i n c e was
advancing towards t h e f o r t a t t h e head o f a l a r g e army.                     Apparently
t h e o v e r z e a l o u s new prime m i n i s t e r , who l a t e r o r d e r e d t h e martyrdom
of t h e Bab, became v i o l e n t l y a n g r y a t t h e news of t h a t d e f e a t .
T h e r e f o r e , t h a t p r i n c e was g i v e n a f r e e r e i g n t o f i n i s h t h e j o b .

o r usurp t h e a u t h o r i t y of t h e king.                H e wished t o a s s e r t t h e

and Babul a t t h e f o r t i n t h e p r e s e n c e o f t h e p r i n c e .             He s a i d ,
"Let t h e h o l y book of Qur'an d e c i d e between t r u t h and f a l s e h o o d .
The p r i n c e s h o u l d be t h e j u d g e , and I would welcome any punishment
s h o u l d I f a i l t o prove my c a s e . "           The messenger, moved t o tears,
promised t h a t i n t h r e e d a y s s u c h a meeting would be a r r a n g e d , b u t
t h e p r i n c e wanted t o u s e t h e o p p o r t u n i t y t o i m p r e s s t h e k i n g w i t h
h i s t a c t i c s , and n o t n e g o t i a t i o n .

Now h e had t h r e e r e g i m e n t s of i n f a n t r y and s e v e r a l r e g i m e n t s of
c a v a l r y under h i s command. T h i s d e f i n i t e l y was a much l a r g e r army
t h a n t h e d e f e a t e d t w e l v e thousand f o r c e . Tension was h i g h , and
t h e l a r g e army restless f o r t h e s i g n a l , but... A d i f f e r e n t s i g n a l     ...
The day had n o t y e t broken when a t t h e s i g n a l of "Mount your s t e e d s ,
0 h e r o e s of God," Quddus o r d e r e d t h e g a t e s opened.                   Mulla Husayn
and o t h e r men f o l l o w e d Quddus. Undaunted by t h e f o r c e s t h a t
surrounded them, o r t h e mud and snow on t h e r o a d , t h e y charged
towards t h e h e a r t of t h e camp, t h e p r i n c e ' s h e a d q u a r t e r s .          With
t h a t s u r p r i s e a t t a c k , l i k e a b o l t o f l i g h t e n i n g , t h e companions
r e a c h e d t h e r e s i d e n c e of t h e p r i n c e . The proud p r i n c e , n o t w i s h i n g
t o be c u t i n h a l f , jumped o u t of t h e back window, and escaped
barefoot.           The army went i n t o t o t a l c h a o s , h a v i n g l o s t t h e i r
commander.

Two o t h e r p r i n c e s and t h e s o l d i e r s who showed r e s i s t a n c e were s t r u c k
down.       The companions found cases f i l l e d w i t h g o l d and s i l v e r i n
t h e p r i n c e ' s room, b u t a l l t h e y t o o k w a s a c a s e of gunpowder and
t h e p r i n c e ' s f a v o r i t e sword as e v i d e n c e o f t h e i r t r i u m p h f o r Mulla
Husayn.         Mulla Husayn had s t a y e d behind w i t h a number of men t o
check any unexpected move by t h e enemy. When t h e companions r e a c h e d

him, they found he was using Quddus's sword because a bullet had
struck his own sword.

After the men reached Mulla Husayn with the prince's sword, he
led the company towards the camp headquarters where Quddus was.
Mulla Husayn returned Quddus's sword, and ordered the companions
to surround Quddus for safety. He remained at full vigilance,
surveying the enemy's move. Still there were a few regiments
remaining in the field. All of a sudden, he observed from left
and right a mass of soldiers charging from two sides towards them.
With the cry of "Ya Sahibu'z-Zaman," the companions pressed forward
towards the coming host. Some followed Quddus, and the others
followed Mulla Husayn in another direction. The oncoming enemy,
seeing Mulla Husayn wielding his sword, deflected their direction
and charged towards Quddus.
The thunderous sound of thousands of bullets fired filled Mulla
Husayn with apprehension. Disregarding the shower of bullets,
he sped towards Quddus, and found the companions repulsing the
attack, but to his horror, he found Quddus bleeding profusely from
his mouth. Dismounting his horse, he ran towards Quddus, and seeing
what happened to his beloved chief, he raised his hands to beat
upon his own head when Quddus signaled him to desist. A bullet
had broken several of Quddus's teeth and lacerated his tongue and
throat. Mulla Husayn obeyed his chief who had remained on his
horse; however, he asked Quddus for his sword. Mulla Husayn mounted
his charger, and with Quddus's sword in one hand and the prince's
in the other, swept through the lines of the enemy. The charger,
being given a free reign, like a chariot of fire, tore through
the lines of the enemy, allowing his master to mow them down right
and left.    What a sight to behold! With such unmatched heroism,
within thirty minutes, the entire army fled with no trace except
the dead.
Back at the fort, Quddus wrote an appeal to all who were
disheartened by his injury. He told them to be resigned to the
will of God, and if they loved him, to not spoil the joy of that
memorable day by their lamentation.       He wrote, "Muhammad also
lost his teeth by the stone of the infidels."
That unforgettable engagement took place on December 21, 1848,

when a handful of inspired heroes disgraced and defeated a large
and well-equipped royal army.      Truly, beyond any explanation,
miraculously, a few swords silenced thousands of guns.

It took more than a month before the demoralized and scattered
forces of the prince recovered and began to prepare for the final
decisive blow.    By this time, several additional regiments of
infantry and cavalry under two brave and seasoned commanders had
arrived.   Another Goliath against little David. Their combined
forces set up a series of barricades.  To intimidate the occupants
of the fort, they engaged in exercising maneuvers, firing their
guns constanty for a few days.

While you are watching these childish practices, let me go inside
the fort and tell you what is transpiring there. The scarcity
of water compelled the men to dig a well.          As it was near
completion, Mulla Husayn told his hard-working comrades, "Today
we shall have all the water we require for our bath. Cleansed
of all earthly defilement, we shall seek the court of the Almighty,
and shall hasten to our eternal abode. Whoever is ready to partake
of the cup of martyrdom, let him prepare himself, and be ready
to scatter the dark forces surrounding us." I wish I had a cheerful
report to give you, but that is the way it was on that February
lst, 1849, within the fort of -   - Tabarsi.

Mulla Husayn washed and did his ablution, put on a new garment,
and adorning his head with the turban of the Bab, prepared for
the approaching encounter. Let us not get sad. Alluding to the
hour of his departure, his face was beaming with joy. Alone he
sat up all night at the feet of Quddus, who so powerfully reminded
him of his beloved Master, pouring forth all that was in his heart.

After midnight, way before the daybreak, he mounted his charger,
and commanded the gates to be opened.        At the head of his
companions, with the powerful cry of "Ya Sahibu'z-Zaman" which
vibrated the fort and the forest, they charged towards the enemy
lines. The first barricade Mulla Husayn dealt with was commanded
by the enemy's bravest officers. Soon he disposed of its commander
and scattered the soldiers. With the same speed and swiftness
he cleared the second and third barricades. Undaunted by the shower
of bullets, they pressed forward until the remaining barricades

had been all overthrown. In the confusion that ensued and fearful
of his life, one of the commanders climbed a tree.

The horse of Mulla Husayn suddenly became entangled in the rope
of a tent, and before it could free itself, Mulla Husayn's chest
was pierced by the bullet of the officer in the tree. However,
the officer had no idea whom he had shot. Mulla Husayn, who was
bleeding profusely, dismounted his horse, staggered a few steps
and collapsed. Two of his companions carried him back to the fort.

Friends, this is too much for me to recount. Two believers, one
of whom was Furu&i,    have related the following account: "We were
among those who had remained in the fort with Quddus. As soon
as Mulla Husayn, who seemed to have lost consciousness, was laid
down in the presence of Quddus, Quddus dismissed us and said, 'Leave
me alone with him. There are certain confidential matters which
I wish him alone to know. "' Then he bade his attendant, a strong
believer, to close the door. Furu&i    continues, "As we sat outside
the door, we were amazed to hear the voice of Mulla Husayn answering
Quddus. For two hours they continued to converse. I had never
seen that brave and strong attendant of Quddus so agitated. He
later told us that he was watching them through a crack in the
door. As soon as Quddus said, 'Mulla Husayn,' he arose, and seated
himself on his knees facing Quddus. With bowed head, he listened
to every word of Quddus, and answered his questions. Then Quddus's
final words were, 'You have hastened the hour of your departure,
and abandoned me to the mercy of my enemies. Please God, may I
join you soon, and taste the sweetness of heaven's delight.'
...These were the final words of Mulla Husayn, 'May my life be
a ransom for you. Are you well-pleased with me?"'     Quddus, unable
to speak, nodded his head. Mulla Husayn, that indomitable hero,
with a gentle smile on his lips, closed his eyes to this world.

Furughi states, ''A long time passed before Quddus permitted us
to enter. Quddus participated in the preparation of his body for
burial, and put his own shirt on him.   As Quddus gave the parting
kiss on his eyes and forehead, his lamenting final words were so
intense, which made all of those in attendance to weep. Quddus
laid the body with his own hands at a site within the shrine near
the site where -   - Tabarsi had been laid to rest. He cautioned
those of us who were within the shrine to keep the site of burial

a secret and conceal it, even from the rest of the companions.
Mulla Husayn was thirty-six years old when he passed on to the

..."

kingdom of eternal glory

The Bab, in the Tablet of Visitation revealed for Mulla Husayn,
has asserted that the dust of the burial site of Mulla Husayn has
the potency to bring joy to the grief-stricken and healing to the
sick. Matter of fact, after the events were over, He sent a
believer to do a pilgrimage on His behalf to the site of the fort,
and bring Him a handful of dust from the graves of Quddus and Mulla
Husayn. (God Passes By, page 50) Let us pray that the days of
emancipation will be hastened so the pilgrimage of the Baha'is,
from all corners of the world, to that fort and Quddus's resting
place will become possible.

Since most of you are anxious to learn how it all ended, a brief
account will be presented. For details, please refer to The Dawn-
Breakers.

On that second day of Februrary, the day of the martyrdom of Mulla
Husayn, the casualty among the companions was heavy. Ninety of
them were seriously wounded and died later. From the date of their
arrival to that tragic day in February, the number of companions
martyred reached seventy-two, as foretold by Mulla Husayn. The
days of Mulla Husayn's heroic deeds numbered one hundred sixteen
days, which dwarfed and eclipsed all of the heroic deeds of the
past. It was the mandate and the will of the Bab, so expressed
in His parting words when Mulla Husayn left Mah-Ku a year earlier.

The disgraceful defeat of that massive army, and the loss of forty-
five experienced officers was a severe blow to those in charge.
It took one and a half months to recover, particularly with the
intensity of cold in that winter. However, that hiatus did not
relax their prevention of any supplies reaching the fort. With
exhaustion of all supplies, Quddus opened the last supply of rice
which Mulla Husayn had stored. As Quddus distributed the rice,
he warned them about the unbearable trials ahead, and excused
whoever wished to leave while the enemy's siege was broken.

That very night one traitor defected, and informed the enemy that
Mulla Husayn was dead. Another Judas. He told the commander that

on February 2nd, had they persisted, the fort would have been
conquered. Up to that time, the enemy did not have that information.
It gave them a new resolve.

Here are the highlights of the remaining three months. With the
loss of Mulla Husayn, the confident enemy was preparing and counting
on their final deadly assault. But again, the magic cry of "Ya
Sahibu'z-Zaman" by only nineteen charging companions scattered
the enemy. We can easily see that it was not the strength of
numbers of men or arms, but the power of the animating spirit.
After Mulla Husayn's death, all defensive sorties were led by Mirza
Muhammad Baqir, the stout builder of the fort, whom Quddus appointed
to replace Mulla Husayn. The defeat of the commanding officer
was both embarrassing and humiliating. While escaping, he fell
from his horse with one of his boots stuck in the stirrup. The
victory under the new leader brought fresh spirit to those hungry,
but not broken, heroes. They ate the flesh of horses taken from
the enemy.    In the rank and file of the enemy, each defeated
commander was a consolation to the other disgraced ones.

Finally, a desparate request was made to the capital for a shipment
of cannons and artillery power.    Meanwhile, at the fort, the last
Naw-Ruz in the life of Quddus and the companions was celebrated.
Disregarding hunger, they sang the hymns of praise with which Quddus
had been welcomed to the fort. Their daily spiritual sustenance
was the new writings flowing from the pen of Quddus.

On the ninth day of Naw-Ruz, artillery shells began to pound the
fort. Quddus, calmly walking in the open, rolled a cannon ball
with his foot and assured the followers. The photo of one such
cannon ball is on the insert. With continuation of shelling by
the enemy and expectation of unconditional surrender, they were
badly surprised by the loud hymns of joy and regular calls to prayer
reaching their ears from the fort. One wonders how many soldiers
saw the power and greatness of the Cause, and later embraced it.
Meanwhile, the food of the companions was reduced to grass, boiled
water and chewing on the leather of their saddles and belts.

Frustrated with the fervor of the companions, a tower was erected
by the army, from the top of which they directed their shelling
at the heart of the fort. Quddus summoned Mirza Muhammad Baqir

and said, "Go and inflict a humiliation on this new commander,
no less than the previous one.   Let him know that although hungry,
the lionhearted heroes can still roar."      Again, he and eighteen
companions, with     the cry of     "Ya Sahibu'z-Zaman," toppled
the tower, and demolished the barricades with none of the believers
scratched.

companions, with the final cry of "Ya Sahibu'z-Zaman," toppled
the tower, and demolished the barricades with none of the believers
scratched.

For one month attacks were halted due to an explosion in the
ammunition depot where a number of officers and soldiers died.
Once again the cannons began their fire, but were silenced with
another counter-offensive. Now has passed about five months of
siege with no sign of progress, even with their big guns. The
only weapon left was treachery.       At first they stopped all
offensive.   Then a Qur'an, signed and sealed by the prince
commander, was sent to Quddus, swearing a safe passage for everyone
with their expenses paid to return to their home towns. Quddus
honored the holy book, and the gates for the last time were opened.

As the companions came out of the fort, they were taken to the
army's headquarters and separated into groups, but soon the foul
play of barbaric and brutal massacre ensued, blaspheming the Qur'an
upon which they had falsely promised peace.      Quddus was handed
over to Sa'idu'l-Ulama, the blood-thirsty priest of Babul, who
was impatiently awaiting his precious trophy to assure his own
eternal damnation.     That fiend had sadistically planned the
prolonged parade of Quddus in chains and despicable torture on
the way to the main square. As Quddus reached the square, he raised
his voice, "Only if my mother could be here to watch the splendor
of my wedding night." At his final moments, before he was struck
down by the axe of that priest, he prayed for his tormenters.
Then those ravenous beasts fell upon him, cutting him into pieces,
feeding the parts into a blazing fire prepared and planned by that
fiend.
Quddus was only twenty-seven years old, and the date was May 16,
1849\. Past midnight when everyone was gone, under the direction
of a compassionate and pious divine, Haji Muhammad- Aliyi-Hamzih,
the charred remnants were buried at a site not too far from that
square.

You should also hear the special circumstances surrounding the
martyrdom of Mirza Muhammad-Baqir, whom Quddus appointed as the
leader of their counter-offensive sorties after the death of Mulla
Husayn. Mirza, a distinguished and learned man, was the one who
built the Babiyyih in Ma&had,  and later the fort at Bay& Tabarsi.
He and another companion were sent to the town of Amul, where six
months before, Baha'u'llah, after being intercepted on His way
to the fort, had been confined and bastinadoed. Upon their arrival,
the horrible tortures inflicted upon his friend threw Mirza into
a fit of rage. When the executioner approached them, Mirza freed
his tied hands, and snatched the sword from the executioner. He
struck the executioner with such force that his head rolled about
fifteen feet away. The crowd rushed towards him, but he mowed
down all who came within his reach. Finally, they had to shoot
him which was a more merciful death. In his pocket they found
a dry piece of roasted horse flesh, a proof of what he and all
those heroes had to endure for their faith.

Those thick walls and gate of that fort, still vibrating with the
cry of those heroes, were meticulously razed to efface the least
evidence of the army's repeated humiliations and their final
treacherous blasphemy.    How naive! How ignorant! The spilled
blood of the martyrs could never and shall never be silenced.

That month of May, 1849, that part of northern Iran on the shores
of the Caspian sea, witnessed the bloody end of so heroic and so
tragic events of Fort -     - Tabarsi. Let the resonating, earth-
shaking cry of "Ya Sahibu'z-Zaman," and the hymns of those valiant
heroes fill the air and reverbrate until the end of time.
