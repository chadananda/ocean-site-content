Foreword

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, currents of religious
> change long perceptible in the west became far more pronounced. Long es-
> tablished religions lost adherents to agnosticism on the one hand and, on the
> other, to newer, more individualistic religions which were less institutionally
> and liturgically oriented. From as early as the mid-eighteenth century, women
> had bulked increasingly large in the church congregations of the west as men
> tended to stand aside from religion and dedicate themselves to a more and
> more secularised public world of work and politics. This trend too became
> more pronounced in the late nineteenth century, but a new feature now came
> to the fore: women rose to striking public visibility in organised religious
> activity, assuming organisational and leadership roles on a scale surpassing
> even that of the radical religious turmoil associated with mid­-seventeenth
century Protestantism.

Against this European background I want to take up the story of Margaret
> Dixson in Australia. Her shift from Anglicanism, via numerology, astrology
> and commitment to the world ideals implicit in Esperanto, to the teachings of
> Bahá’í, on the one hand reflects the widespread change occurring in western
> Protestant religion we have noted. But beyond that it also traces out a far from
> uncommon pattern the historian is able to discern among Australian religious
women of her time.

My grandmother Margaret Dixson was born Margaret Bertha Shann on
> Wednesday, 11 July 1877 at 12.50 pm (her horoscope, 1926) and died at the
> age of sixty two in Melbourne, 1939. My grandmother’s life, and that of my
> father, was deeply shaped by the circumstances of my great-grandfather’s story,
above all by the breakup of his marriage somewhere in the 1880s.

My great-grandfather Frank Shann, Margaret’s father, was the twelfth
