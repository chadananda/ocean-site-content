                     In Memoriam

Houshang Arjmand

1930-2015

Mr. Houshang Arjmand, the grandson of the illustrious
Bahá’í scholar and teacher Haj Mehdi Arjmand and the fourth
child of Habibullah Arjmand and Monireh Mobine, was born in
Tehran, Iran on March 20, 1930. He finished his high school
education in Tehran, and thereafter, pursued a higher education
in engineering in Germany, France, and the United States.

Upon his return to Iran, he partnered with his brother-in-law
Mr. Yadollah Mahboubian and together they founded the “Iran
Electric Company,” which became the largest importer,

distributor, and manufacturer of electrical cables and
equipment in Iran. After the Iranian revolution in 1979,
Houshang’s life changed drastically when his partner and
brother-in-law, Mr. Mahboubian, was arrested and imprisoned
by the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for his belief
in the Bahá’í Faith, and ultimately martyred in the path of the
Blessed Beauty. This tragic loss affected Houshang greatly. With
unconditional love, he looked after his sister Parvin
Mahboubian, the widow or Mr. Mahboubian, and selflessly
took on the guardianship of their daughters, Shiva and Nikoo
Mahboubian.

Mr. Houshang Arjmand had a commitment and dedication to
promote the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. In 1993, through his
ardent efforts, he created the Háj Mehdi Arjmand Memorial
Fund at the Bahá’í National Treasurer’s Office in the United
States as a tribute to his grandfather who as part of his scholarly
work authored the book Gulshan Haqayiq. This book, which was
approved by ‘Abdul-Bahá through a Tablet addressed to Haj
Mehdi, is a study on the fulfillment of the prophesies mentioned
in both the Old and New Testaments with the coming of
Bahá’u’lláh. The ‘Irfán Colloquium was established in 1993 and
has been mainly supported by the Haj Mehdi Arjmand Memorial
Fund. The aim of this colloquium is to encourage and support
scholarly studies of the sacred writings, verities, and
fundamental principles and the belief system of the Bahá’í Faith.
This Colloquium is also an attempt to encourage and support
studies aimed at correlating Bahá’í teachings with intellectual
schools of thought, the scientific perspective, various religious
traditions and current challenges in human society.

In a message conveyed to Mr. Arjmand’s family, the
Universal House of Justice states, “His generous support for a
wide range of Bahá’í activities bears testimony to his
magnanimity and ardent desire to promote the interests of the
Cause.” Additionally, in a letter of condolence from the
National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States
to Mrs. Mahboubian, the Assembly writes: “As we call to mind

Mr. Arjmand’s devoted efforts through the Haj Mehdi Arjmand
Memorial Fund to provide needed resources to worthy Bahá’í
initiatives and enterprises, our hearts are moved to gratitude
and warmest appreciation.” The Fund’s assistance has enabled
the Irfán Colloquium, for one, to carry on with its noble, far-
sighted, knowledge-building conferences and publications. The
Universal House of Justice welcomed and encourages this
initiative and, following the guidance received from the
Supreme Body, it became one of the activities affiliated with
the Bahá’í National Center of the United States.

During the past twenty-two years Irfán Colloquium has
convened one hundred thirty-five times in North America and
Europe. At these sessions of the Irfán Colloquium a total of
one thousand five hundred research papers were presented in the
English, Persian, and German languages by scholars, and fifty
volumes containing those research papers have so far been
published. All these achievements are due to generous support
of Houshang Arjmand, his sister Mrs. Parvin Mahboubian and
his brother Mr. Sohrab Arjmand. Houshang Arjmand always
insisted that no mention of gratitude and appreciation of
himself and his other family members should be made at Irfán
Colloquium sessions and in Irfán publications, to avoid giving
the impression of any pretensions. This was not the only project
that received Mr. Arjmand’s munificent care and attention

Well known for his generosity, discretion and humility,
Houshang lived his life according to the Bahá’í Principles. He
passed away on 20 August 2015 in San Diego, California, He is
survived by his sisters Mahin Banayan, Parvin Mahboubian, and
Minou Manuchehri; and his brother Sohrab Arjmand. Although
he did not have any children of his own, he was undoubtedly a
devoted father to all his nieces and nephews, as well as an
affectionate grandfather to their children. He will always be
remembered as a true humanitarian who selflessly dedicated his
life to love, kindness and friendship towards all.
