_Dr. David S. Ruhe_ |

**HAIFa,** Israel, 7 September 2005 (BWNS) — Dr. David S. Ruhe, former member of the Universal House of Justice, died Tuesday, 6 September 2005, near his home in Newburgh, New York, following a stroke in mid-August. He was 91.

Dr. Ruhe became a Bahá'í in Philadelphia in 1941, subsequently serving on numerous Local Spiritual Assemblies and national Bahá'í committees. Elected to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States in 1959, he served as its secretary from 1963 until 1968, when he was elected to the Universal House of Justice. His service on the Bahá'í Faith's supreme governing council here extended for five terms of five years each until 1993.

A medical doctor, Dr. Ruhe was also an accomplished film-maker, painter, and author. Graduating from Temple University School of Medicine in 1941, Dr. Ruhe began his medical career during World War II as a malaria researcher in the United States Public Health Service where he was promoted to the rank of Medical Director.

In l954, Dr. Ruhe was named the first professor of Medical Communications at the University of Kansas Medical School. Among the innovations he introduced there were the use of optical fibers for endoscopic cinematography, the projection of high-definition images in surgical theaters, and videotaping of psychiatric sessions for peer review.

He made scores of medical films, winning the Golden Reel award, the Venice Film Festival award, and the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain award for his productions. In the course of his work in medical education he was appointed Director of the Medical Film Institute for the Association of American Medical Colleges.

Dr. Ruhe was a prolific writer. In his medical career, he authored many papers and two books on aspects of medicine and medical audiovisual communication.

During his years at the Bahá'í World Centre, Dr. Ruhe researched and wrote _Door of Hope,_ detailed explanation of the history and significance of Bahá'í holy places in Israel, published in 1983. Later, he wrote _Robe of Light,_ a historical account of Bahá'u'lláh's early years, published in 1994. Dr. Ruhe was also an accomplished painter who was trained in the Lehigh Valley school of impressionism.

Upon his 1993 departure from the Universal House of Justice, Dr. Ruhe and his wife, Margaret, returned to New York State where he produced a series of documentary TV programs about the Bahá'í Faith.

Dr. Ruhe is survived by his wife, Margaret, and two sons, Christopher and Douglas, and their families.

To the American Bahá'í Community

Dear Bahá'í Friends,

We received with heavy hearts news of the passing from this earthly life of
beloved and respected retired Universal House of Justice member,
Dr. David S. Ruhe. To us, he was much more than an erudite Bahá'í scholar
and a veteran and expert administrator of the Faith’s affairs; he was an
esteemed advisor, a cherished colleague, and a dear friend. We join the
entire Bahá'í world in mourning his loss and in celebrating his stellar
achievements in the service of God and of humanity.

Physician, educator, writer, and painter, Dr. Ruhe was all these, and as
such, was one who could accurately and deservedly be described as a
“Renaissance man.” A graduate of Temple University’s School of Medicine,
his career as a physician and medical educator charted a distinguished
course from posts as Senior Surgeon with the U.S. Public Health Service
and Director of the Medical Film Institute for the Association of American
Medical Colleges, to Chairman of the Department of Medical
Communication at Kansas University’s School of Medicine. His creativity
and aesthetic sense were exercised not only in his direction of numerous
award-winning educational films, but in his love for painting natural
scenes—expressed in his accomplished watercolors, which reflected his
training in the Lehigh Valley school of impressionism.

Notwithstanding his many and varied professional and personal interests,
the focal point of Dr. Ruhe’s life was always the Bahá'í Faith, and his efforts
on behalf of its divine Originator followed a similar trajectory of steadily
increasing responsibility and progressively more distinguished service. The
years succeeding his enrollment as a Bahá'í in 1941 saw him serving on a
host of national committees, including two different Regional Teaching
Committees and committees focusing on Bahá'í activities at the United
Nations, at the Green Acre Bahá'í School, and at the Bahá'í House of
Worship—to mention but a few. A homefront pioneer to the city of Atlanta,
a former stronghold of the vanquished Confederacy, he fearlessly
championed the oneness of humanity—as he did throughout his life—even
in the face of threats to his safety. First elected to the National Spiritual
Assembly in 1959, by 1963 he had become its Secretary, effectively bringing

September 6, 2005                                                           Page 2

to a close his professional career and setting in motion a three-decades-long
period during which his life would be entirely dedicated to service on the
Faith’s senior institutions—first, for five years, at its national headquarters
in the United States; then, following his election in 1968 to the Universal
House of Justice, for 25 years, at its World Center.

Though his absorption in the stewardship of the Faith’s affairs afforded
him little time for leisure, Dr. Ruhe’s creative impulses remained strong
and found new expression in his writing, which ultimately led him to
publish two popular books concerned with Bahá'í history: Door of Hope,
published in 1983, which presents a detailed explanation of the history and
significance of the Faith’s sacred sites in the Holy Land, and Robe of Light,
published in 1994, which focuses on the early years of Bahá'u'lláh’s life,
prior to His exile from Persia in 1853. Retiring from the Universal House of
Justice in 1993 after five five-year terms as a member, Dr. Ruhe returned to
the United States, settling in upstate New York. Though advanced in years,
he remained vibrant and active, producing a series of documentary
television programs about the Faith and attending various Bahá'í
conferences, at which his always stimulating presentations were received
warmly and with rapt attention.

Throughout his exemplary career—forever to remain a bright star in the
firmament of Bahá'í history—Dr. Ruhe’s beloved wife, Margaret, was his
strong anchor, his most trusted advisor and confidante. She and their
cherished sons, Christopher and Douglas, together with their wives and
children, were, without doubt, the light of his life. We extend our heartfelt
condolences to them and to all his many loved ones and friends, assuring
them of our prayers, offered in the serene stillness of the sacred and
luminous Bahá'í House of Worship, that his precious soul may continue its
eternal journey through “worlds, holy and spiritually glorious” that are even
now being unveiled before his astonished eyes. May “days of blissful joy, of
heavenly delight” truly be his, lovingly bestowed by the grateful King of
Glory Whom he served so consummately, for so long, and with such
complete devotion.

In loving remembrance,

> Robert C. Henderson
> Secretary-General
