0 Ahmad! F o r g e t

of f i r e t o My enemies and a r i v e r of l i f e e t e r n a l t o My loved o n e s ,
and be n o t of t h o s e who doubt.''

Was Ahmad t r u l y a flame of f i r e and a r i v e r of l i f e e t e r n a l ?
Indeed, he was t h e embodiment of both.                    How else c o u l d it be?
When B a h a ' u ' l l a h u t t e r e d t h e word BE, he became.  The combination
of f i r e and w a t e r , t h a t unquenchable f i r e was t h e magic of Ahmad.

The p h r a s e "flame of f i r e " c o u l d m i s t a k e n l y g i v e t h e i m p r e s s i o n
of a d e s t r u c t i v e power given by B a h a ' u ' l l a h t o Ahmad. H e d i d n o t

Moses brought t o t h e E g y p t i a n s .            B a h a ' u ' l l a h , on H i s D e c l a r a t i o n
day a few y e a r s b e f o r e t h e r e v e l a t i o n of t h e T a b l e t of Ahmad,

f o r b a d e t h e u s e of t h e sword. Those a l l e g o r i c a l words of t h e T a b l e t
of Ahmad made him t h a t unique b e l i e v e r whose l i f e s t o r y you are
going t o h e a r .

The flame of f i r e was n o t h i n g b u t t h e f o r c e of h i s unshakeable
f a i t h and f i r e of h i s z e a l w i t h which he b u r n t away t h e v e i l s of
i g n o r a n c e , and when subdued, he warmed t h e i r c a l l o u s e d and c o l d
h e a r t s w i t h t h e warmth of h i s l o v e .

you are a b o u t t o h e a r is mostly e x t r a c t e d , a n d , i n p a r t , d i r e c t l y

Isma'il, e n t i t l e d by B a h a ' u ' l l a h a s B a b i h , meaning S a c r i f i c e ,
and a l s o Anis, meaning Companion.                           This brother, Isma'il, w a s t h e

According t o B a h a ' u ' l l a h , Abraham was going                             t o sacrifice his
f i r s t b o r n , Ishmael, a s a proof of h i s f a i t h .                       It i s i n t e r e s t i n g

to see in the history of religion three Isma'ils whose names are
associated with sacrifice.

We were talking about Mirza Jani of Ka&an whose one brother stayed
a Muslim, one was Isma'il, and the third one was Ahmad who went
to Ba&dad,    and attained the presence of Baha'u'llah.       When
Baha'u'llah left Ba&dad  after His Declaration, He left one Ahmad
behind and chose the other Ahmad to accompany Him to Istanbul.
You shold also realize that Siyyid Muhammad-i-Isfahani, the mind
behind Mirza Yahya's evil deeds, also accompanied Baha'u'llah.

When our star, Ahmad, begged Baha'u'llah to go with Him, he was
told by Baha'u'llah that He was taking some followers with Him
to keep an eye on them. The unfortunate Ahmad, in the storm of
tests and trials, departed from the right path and sided with Mirza
Yahya. That is when Baha'u'llah revealed the Persian Tablet of
Ahmad for him to warn him against such evil deeds which he was
committing, causing great suffering for Baha'u'llah and His family.
The miserable Ahmad stayed unchanged and went back to Ba&dad  where
he found his old associates. He lived a wicked life. One of his
worst habits was to insult and curse people in the most bitter
and foul language. In one of his disputes with his evil friends,
he lashed them with his sharp tongue, and so one night they got
rid of him by killing him.

Now we go to the Ahmad in whose honor the well-known Tablet was
revealed in Arabic. He was born in Yazd, a southern city in Iran,
about 1805 to a very noble and rich family. His father and uncles
were the chieftains of the town, but Ahmad, even at the age of
fourteen, showed a great inclination toward mysticism and endeavored
to find new paths to truth. When he was fifteen, he had already
started his investigations during which he heard from some of the
people that there are saints or holy men who knew special prayers,
which if read and repeated so many times and in accordance with
certain rituals, would definitely enable the reader to behold the
countenance of the Promised Qa'im.

This flared up the fire of his ever-growing longings. He began
to practice an ascetic life with long prayers, successive days
of fasting and secluding himself from people and from the world.
His parents and relatives never approved of such practices, nor

d i d t h e y p e r m i t him t o c o n t i n u e t h i s s e c l u s i o n which was c o n t r a r y
t o t h e i r ways o f l i f e and a m b i t i o n .               Such o p p o s i t i o n c o u l d n o t
b e t o l e r a t e d by a man l i k e Ahmad who was w h o l e h e a r t e d l y s e a r c h i n g

It was i n Ka&an where t h e rumors a b o u t a p e r s o n c l a i m i n g t o be

"When I r e a c h e d t h e h o u s e , I knocked a t t h e d o o r and t h e s e r v a n t

H i s p i l g r i m a g e and p r o c l a m a t i . i n Mecca. The h o s t , Mulla S a d i q ,
was a very d i s t i n g u i s h e d Babi, well-known                             f o r h i s erudition,
a u d a c i t y and s t e a d f a s t n e s s .        During B a h a ' u ' l l a h ' s        m i n i s t r y he

meaning t h e most t r u t h f u l , upon him.

Ahmad, now a b o u t f o r t y y e a r s o l d , who f o r twenty-five y e a r s had
been wandering i n t h e v a l l e y of s e a r c h and had nowhere found even
a drop t o quench h i s t h i r s t , found h i m s e l f on t h e p a t h t o t h e main
spring.       Three s e s s i o n s were s u f f i c i e n t , and he embraced t h e F a i t h
w i l l a l l h i s h e a r t and s o u l .    So e l a t e d and o v e r - e n t h u s i a s t i c he
looked t h a t Mulla Sadiq a d v i s e d him t o calm down, r e t u r n t o K a a a n ,
and i n s i s t e d t h a t he s h o u l d n o t mention t h e F a i t h t o t h e p e o p l e ,

not even to his own wife. You see, those days were the days of
extreme danger to the newly-born Cause of God. Those who embraced
the Cause were forever the target of many atrocities. Even the
air was imbued with suspicion, spying, and slander. Therefore,
the believers had to be very careful.     Quddus, Mulla Sadiq, and
a third person were the first ones in the history of the Faith
who endured torture at the hands of the enemies.      Mulla Sadiq,
knowing how Ahmad had suffered and realizing that he had no money
to return home, gave him money and small gifts for his family,
and again stressed wisdom and discretion.

Commenting on his return to Kashan, Ahmad recounts, "When I reached
Ka&an   everyone asked what h z happened that I left everything
so abruptly. I told them, 'My longing for pilgrimage was too great
to resist, and I was right. "' Here I wish to let you know that
the city of Mashhad where he met Mulla Sadiq is the holiest Islamic
city in Iran where the shrine of the eighth Imam is located, and
people go there for pilgrimage, so his answer had double meaning.

In Kashan he resumed his work, but longed to teach the Faith.
He heard rumors that a man in Kashan by the name of Haji Mirza
Jani had changed his religion and-had     become the follower of a
new and obscure religion. Ahmad searched for him and when the
two found each other their joy had no bounds. They became constant
companions and were the only two Babis in Ka&an.      Mirza Jani had
been converted by Mulla Husayn when he visited Kashan on his way
to Tehran to deliver the scroll from the Bab to ~aha'u'llah.

Here with your permission I will digress to a side story. The
guards who were taking the Bab from Isfahan to Tehran had strict
orders to bypass every village and town.          For disguise, they
replaced the Bab's green turban with a merchant's hat so no one
would recognize Him. It was the eve of Naw-Ruz of 1847 when they
were approaching Kashan. The night before, Haji Mirza Jani dreamt
that as he was staaing by a certain gate of the city he saw the
Bab, escorted by the guards, was approaching. The Bab told Haji,
1'

For the next three nights We will be your guest, prepare yourself."

He woke up, and though he had never seen the Bab, he considered
it to be a true dream. He cleaned the house and prepared a room
for the Bab. He went by the same gate, and to his surprise his
dream came true. As they approached, Haji went to kiss the Bab's

s t i r r u p s , b u t t h e Bab p r e v e n t e d him and s a i d t h e e x a c t words h e a r d
i n h i s dream. The g u a r d s t h o u g h t he w a s a n o l d f r i e n d of t h e Bab.
The c h i e f guard had no o b j e c t i o n f o r p e r m i t t i n g t h e Bab t o e n t e r
t h e c i t y , b u t t h e o t h e r g u a r d s s t u b b o r n l y r e s i s t e d t h e i d e a of
disobeying t h e i r s t r i c t orders.               F i n a l l y , w i t h p e r s u a s i o n of t h e
c h i e f , they consented.             Haji wished t o h o s t t h e g u a r d s a s w e l l ,
b u t t h e Bab t o l d him, "I, a l o n e , w i l l b e your g u e s t . "

During t h e v i s i t , one day Haji went t o Ahmad and w i t h g r e a t
e x c i t e m e n t t o l d him, "Would you l i k e t o behold t h e countenace of
your Lord?" Ahmad became o v e r j o y e d and immediately a r o s e and asked
how and when. H a j i broke t h e overwhelming news of h i m s e l f h o s t i n g
t h e Bab and i n v i t e d Ahmad t o h i s house.                A t t h e a p p o i n t e d hour
Ahmad a r r i v e d a t H a j i ' s house, and beheld t h e countenance o f t h e
promised Qa'im f o r whom h e had yearned a l l h i s l i f e .                        H e saw a
young S i y y i d s i t t i n g w i t h s u c h meekness, m a j e s t y and g r a n d e u r ,
t r u l y r e f l e c t i n g t h e l i g h t of God.       Some of t h e d i v i n e s and
d i g n i t a r i e s of town were s e a t e d on t h e f l o o r and t h e s e r v a n t s s t o o d
a t t h e door.

One of t h e m u l l a s f a c e d t h e Bab and s a i d , "We have h e a r d t h a t a
c e r t a i n young man from a i r a z h a s claimed t o be t h e Qa'im.                           Is

"Yes, " answered t h e Bab

\[11\] .
Does he r e v e a l verses?'' asked t h e same m u l l a .

The Bab responded, "We r e v e a l v e r s e s , t o o . 11
Ahmad s t a t e s , "This c l e a r answer w a s s u f f i c i e n t f o r anyone t o f i n d

humble s e r v a n t came t o Ahmad and d e p l o r e d t h e s t u p i d i t y of h i s
master.          With a l i t t l e e x p l a n a t i o n a b o u t t h e s t a t i o n of t h e Bab,
h e embraced t h e Cause, and t h e i r number grew t o t h r e e .

A t t h i s j u n c t u r e , I c a n ' t h e l p b u t t o d i g r e s s a g a i n and t e l l you
t h e s t o r y of c o n v e r s i o n of Muslims supposedly by s e r v i n g t e a , d a t e s
and s o on.            S i n c e s o many Muslims became B a b i s , and l a t e r o n ,
B a h a ' i s ; t h e c l e r g y , i g n o r a n t of t h e t r u t h of t h e F a i t h , s u s p e c t e d
tea s e r v e d i n f i r e s i d e s t o be t h e f a c t o r .         So d r i n k i n g of tea by
Muslims i n s u c h m e e t i n g s was s t r i c t l y f o r b i d d e n by t h e s o - c a l l e d

doctors of religion for their spiritual health. This remedy proved
to be unsuccessful. If anything, the number of converts to the
Faith increased, a very serious and disappointing side effect!
As simple as these firesides were, the believers used to serve
dates. Being blind to the real truth, the clergy concluded that
it must be the dates. So it was added to the forbidden list.

The final comedy was the statement of a high clergy in Tabriz at
the presence of the crown prince, Muzaffaru'd-Din Mirza, the son
of Nasiri'd-Din Shah. This was related by Varqa, the martyr.
Varqa, having knowledge of many sciences as well as being a gifted
poet, the crown prince used to enjoy his company in different
gatherings. In one of these gatherings Varqa states this clergy
got up and boasted about his new discovery about how Muslims become
Baha'is.   To the audience eager to hear about his masterpiece,
he stated, "I was prompted to do my research when we all realized
that forbidding of eating dates has not cured the conversion
problem." Now the audience is all ears. He said, "Baha'is have
made extract from dates and have made them in form of small pills.
In their meetings as their teachers speak and people's jaws drop,
these speakers, like sharp-shooters, using their fingertips shoot
the pills into the mouths of the innocent Muslims." Varqa, after
being granted permission by the crown prince to speak, deflated
the clergy by stating he was a physician and knew of many extracts
in pill form, but never had heard about extract of dates; and for
a teacher to become a sharp pill-shooter, it would take so much
practice that no time would be left to become an awe-inspiring
speaker. Finally, even if all the above is refuted, the act of
swallowing the pill should be felt, but no one so far has mentioned
it. The clergy boiled, but the crown prince was amused. No wonder
Varqa was not so popular among the clergy, and he, together with
his twelve-year-old son, Ruhu'llah, drank the cup of martyrdom.

Now we go back to the story of Ahmad. After the visit of the Bab,
this nucleus of only three believers in Kashan began to grow.
The rapid increase in the number of believersVangered the divines
who used everything in their power to stop the flow.          They
instigated the cruel, ignorant mob to plunder, confiscate, and
kill all those who bore the name of the Bab.  Every day they would
go to a house, break its door and windows, loot the contents and
destroy the building. In the evening one would find the bodies

of the believers in the streets, or even scattered over the
neighboring mountains and the plains. This continued, and Ahmad 's
house was no exception.    Ahmad had to hide in a draft tower where
friends would take food to him. The draft towers, call bad-gir,
were common in that part of Iran to produce air current in summer.
After spending forty days in that tower and hearing that Ba&dad
had become the point of attraction, he decided to leave.

Time-wise, we are about six years after the martyrdom of the Bab,
and midpoint of Baha'u'llah's stay in Ba&dad.       In the darkness
of night, Ahmad came out of hiding and escaped by climbing the
city wall on his way to Ba&dad.      As he traveled on foot he came
across another man travelling in the same direction.        Both of
them pretended that their destination was the holy city of Karbila.
The subject of religion was well-avoided for fear of further
molestation. On arrival in Ba&dad      they separated, but soon to
see each other walking in the same direction on streets of B d d a d ,
and the joyous surprise came when they found each other in the
house of Baha'u'llah.   It was a breathtaking experience for Ahmad
to look at Baha'u'llah's countenance for the first time, a face
full of charm and freshness with penetrating powers.    Well, Ahmad
was overwhelmed and came to his senses only when he heard
Baha'u'llah stating, "He becomes a Babi, and then hides in the
tower." Baha'u'llah allowed Ahmad to remain in Ba&dad,     and have
his residence near His.         Ahmad immediately assembled his
cloth-weaving frame and went to work, and was the happiest man
on earth. What else does one expect? To live at the time of the
Supreme Manifestation of God, adore Him, be loved by Him, and be
so close to Him in heart, soul, and residence.

When once asked about the events of the years he spent in such
proximity to Baha'u'llah, with tears in his eyes, Ahmad said, "How
innumerable and great were the events of those years. Our nights
were filled with memorable episodes and days with joyful and, at
times, sorrowful events. For example, one day as the Blessed Beauty
was walking with us behind Him, a government officer approached
Him, stating that one of His followers had been murdered and his
body was thrown by the river. Baha'u'llah replied, 'No one has
killed him. Through seventy thousand veils of light We showed
him the Glory of God to an extent smaller than a needle's eye,
and he could no longer bear the burden of his life, so he offered
himself as a sacrifice.'"

"Another time, when the Caliph's decree was conveyed to Baha'u'llah,
and He had to leave Ba&dad    for Istanbul, He left the city on the
thirty-second day after Naw-Ruz for the Ridvan Garden. On that
same day after He crossed the river it overflowed, but on the ninth
day it was possible for His family to join Him. Then the river
overflowed for the second time, and on the twelfth day it subsided,
and all the people went to Him."

Ahmad begged Baha'u'llah to be allowed to accompany Him in His
exile, but Baha'u'llah did not accept his request. He chose some
followers, and instructed the rest to remain and teach. He
emphasized that this would be better for the Faith.        At the
time of His departure, those who were left behind stood in a row,
and all were so overcome with sorrow that they burst into tears.

"Baha'u'llah again approached us stating, 'It is better for the
Cause of God. Some of these people who accompany Me are liable
to do mischief, therefore I am taking them with Me. ' Then He
mounted His horse, and one of the friends placed a sack of coins
in front of the saddle, and Baha'u'llah started to give coins to
the crying poor who were standing by.    When they began to push
one another, He plunged His hand into the sack and emptied the
sack by pouring the coins on the ground, saying, 'Gather them
yourselves. "'

Ahmad saw his Beloved disappear from his sight never to see Him
again in this mortal life. Very sad and distressed, he returned
to Ba&dad   which to him seemed devoid of any attraction. The sun
was reaching its zenith in Adrianople. He tried to keep himself
busy and happy by gathering the friends and encouraging them to
disperse and teach the Faith which just had been declared. Though
actively serving the Cause, he was not happy.

After a few years, in 1865 Ahmad again left his home and work,
and set out on foot to Adrianople, the city of his love and desire.
When he reached Istanbul he received a Tablet from Baha'u'llah
which is known to us as the Tablet of Ahmad. He describes receipt
of this Tablet in these words, "I received the Tablet of the Night-
ingale of Paradise, and reading it over and over I realized that
my Beloved desired me to go and teach His Cause. Therefore, I
preferred His wish above mine." Ahmad was specially commissioned

to travel throughout Iran, and give the glad tidings of
Baha'u'llah's declaration to as many Babi families as he could
find.
Now you know why such glorious reference to the Bab in this Tablet.
The task was arduous beyond description, and therefore such exhorta-
tions as "Be thou as a flame of fire to my enemies and a river
of life eternal to My lvoed ones, and be not of those who doubt."
The path to be walked by him was thorny and filled with
tribulations, thus these comforting words, "And if thou art
overtaken by affliction in My path or degradation for My sake,
be not thou troubled thereby."       To understand the meaning of
sincerity in the following promise, "By God! Should one who is
in affliction or grief read this Tablet with absolute sincerity,
God will dispel his sadness, solve his difficulties and remove
his afflictions," one can find the answer in an earlier verse in
the same Tablet.      In this earlier verse, the condition for
Baha'u'llah's above promise is revealed in these exalted words,
"...and be thou so steadfast in My love that thy heart shall not
waver, even if the swords of the enemies rain blows upon thee,
and all the heavens and the earth arise against thee." It means
a believer can reach to such heights of certitude and faith that
when facing martyrdom his heart shall not waver. That is the stage
of absolute sincerity which is achieved only by truly recognizing
the station of Baha'u'llah.
With this Tablet in the handwriting of Baha'u'llah in his
possession, a Tablet invested by Baha'u'llah with a special potency,
and clad in the simple garment of a beggar, Ahmad made his way
back to Iran. He entered the country through the province of
Adhirbayjan where most of the captivity and the Martyrdom of the
BZhad taken place. He was like the breeze of life to many
disheartened Babis in that region and enabled them to see the Sun
then shining from Adrianople. Even many Muslims embraced the Faith
wholeheartedly. Ahmad became the embodiment of his own Tablet.
Such undaunted spirit, tenacity, and steadfastness were difficult
to match. He would not easily give up even when facing affliction
and degradation, but to return again and again to finish what needed
to be done.
For example, when traveling in the province of -

Khurasan he went
to the house of a well-known Babi family, the head of which was
no less a person than Furu&i,  one of the survivors of the Tabarsi
upheaval. Ahmad went in and gradually opened the subject in a
frank and emphatic manner. He told them that the One promised
by the Bab was none other than Baha'u'llah Who was then in Adrian-
ople. Furu&i,    who had so audaciously fought in Tabarsi, started
to fight here, too. The discussion became more intense as the
hours went by, and in the heat of discussion, Furu&i   punched Ahmad
in the mouth and broke one of his teeth and physically threw him
out of his house.     Ahmad left broken-hearted, but his resolve
unshaken, he returned later and told them that he would not leave
until the subject was fully discussed and concluded.       We should
bear in mind that in those days, the Babis were in such danger
that even a piece of paper with writings of the Bab was sufficient
enough for the house to be demolished and the occupants sent to
prison or to the executioner. Therefore, many of the believers
did hide their books and writings in the walls of their houses
or under the ground. When Ahmad went to Furu&ils      house for the
second time, he said emphatically that the Greatest Name of Baha
had often been mentioned by the Bab in His writings. Furu&i
challenged him and to prove to Ahmad that he was wrong, he tore
a part of the wall open and brought out a bundle containing the
writings of the Bab, and promised not to say a word against the
explicit text. Ahmad states, "The very first one we opened referred
to the name Baha."    As promised by Furu&i,     he and all of the
members of his family accepted the Faith of Baha'u'llah and became
overzealous defenders and outstanding in its propagation and
protection. Furu&i   is one of the Nineteen Apostles of Baha'u'llah
so designated by the Guardian.

After covering the whole large province of Burasan with its holy
city of Mashhad blessed two decades earlier by the footsteps of
Quddus and Mulls Husayn, Ahmad decided to go once more to Ba&dad
and convey the message of love and greeting on behalf of Baha'u'llah
to all his friends. Unfortunately, while on his way he became
ill and could not reach Ba&dad.

In addition to Tehran, some of the divines of Kashan recognized
him and filed complaints against him at the courrof the king,
Nasiritd-Din Shah, who was ever ready to inflict hardship on the
followers of t h e new Faith. Ahmad was consequently arrested and

committed to the hands of a young officer whose orders were to
investigate the case, and if the victim proved to be a heretic
to put him to death at once. The young officer did not wish to
kill Ahmad so he tried to persuade Ahmad, of all people, to recant
his Faith. Ahmad states, "I was at the height of my faith and
enthusiasm and not even for one moment the thought of recantation
had crossed my mind." He told the officer that he was not a Babi
but a Baha'i, meaning the follower of the Supreme Manifestation.
He was kept in prison, and there he heard that a sudden and serious
illness had struck the officer's wife. In extreme distress, the
officer came to Ahmad and said, "Should my wife recover, I will
release you!"   After three days the young officer, heedless of
severe consequences to himself, took Ahmad to the gate of Tehran
and set him free. If that intervention was not from the Power
behind that tablet, what else could it be?

Free as a bird, he went to nearby villages where the Babis showed
him hospitality, and in return he guided them to the right path.
One source states that Ahmad resided in Kashan until his wife died.
Then he went to the province of Fars with airaz, its capital.
He remarried in Shiraz and lived in that province for twenty years
or more. He became the companion and comforter of the oppressed
and the afflicted which were many in view of never-ending
persecutions. His humble abode was open to the downtrodden as
well as to many travel-teachers. One of the most touching incidents
as related by himself is as follows, "One day a travel-teacher
barely clad and barefoot came to my door.     He was truly exhausted
and his clothes were stiff and brownish with the mixture of sweat
and dust. He happened to be Haji Mirza Haydar- Ali, named by
Abdu'l-Baha .the Angel of Carmel. I fed him and asked him to go
to rest while I washed his clothes and spread them in the sun to
dry. At evening the friends were invited so they could meet such
a great believer and listen to his inspiring words."

Many eventful years passed and when, again, the wave of persecutions
spread all over Iran, Ahmad's life became in danger. The believers,
full of love and admiration for Ahmad, suggested to him to leave
that forsaken corner of the country at once and head for a more
populated area. He was so well-known that he could not be anywhere
throughout the country without being recognized.      After changing
many residences, he decided to settle in Tehran which had been

the wish of his daughter all along.   His daughter was married and
had settled in Tehran for years.

After having lived a century and always enjoying good health, he
passed away in 1905 in Tehran.    He never wavered, nor was he ever
anything but the flame of fire and a river of life eternal. That
was his mandate and identity with which he passed on to the presence
of his Beloved.

You might wonder what happened to the original Tablet of Ahmad
in the handwriting of Baha'ullah which Ahmad carried close to his
heart all the time. The rest of the story might have the answer.

From his first marriage in KaBan, Ahmad had two children. A son
called Mirza Muhammad and a daughter, Khanurn Gowhar. When Ahmad's
house was ransacked in Kashan, his son, who was married and had
a five-year-old son, decided to take his family from Ka&an        to
Tehran. The little boy's name was Jamal. On the way to Tehran,
he and his wife died and the little Jamal remained all by himself.
The mule-drivers who used to take food from provinces to Tehran,
not knowing that Jamal was from a Baha'i family, took pity on the
helpless boy, placed him on one of the loads and took him to Tehran.
In that large city Jamal was all alone until his aunt, manum
Gowhar, the daughter of Ahmad, arrived in Tehran. In process of
searching for any trace of her brother and his family, luckily
she found Jamal. She and her husband raised Jamal until Ahmad
came to settle in Tehran and took his grandson, Jamal, under his
wing. Jamal grew to become an excellent Baha'i.        His two most
outstanding characteristics were iron determination and untiring
energy.
Towards the end of his life, Ahmad entrusted the original Tablet
to Jamal, who, in turn out of the purity of his heart and devotion
to the Faith, offered it as a gift to Jinab-i-Valiyyu'llah-i-Varqa,
the late Hand of the Cause and the trustee of Huququ'llah. Jinab-
i-Varqa was the son of Varqa, the martyr, whose name was mentioned
earlier and the father of Jinab-i- Ali-Muhammad-i-Varqa, the present
Hand of the Cause and the trustee of Huququ'llah. Jinab-i-Varqa,
who had received the original Tablet from Jamal, under the instruc-
tion of the Guardian, attended the opening ceremony of the House
of Worship in Wilmette in 1953. He brought with him this most

precious Tablet as his offering to the Archives of the Baha'is
of the United States.

May you and I, the believers in these United States of America,
who have the privilege of being the present trustees of such a
potent Tablet written by the Pen of Glory, be infused with the
same vigor, fire, and love which infused and transformed its
original trustee and bearer, the immortal Ahmad.

I know you only wanted to hear the story behind the Tablet of Ahmad
and its recipient. Well, that was the main course. The menu will
not be complete without saying a few words about Ahmad's glorious
daughter, Khanum Gawhar. She was a very daring woman for her time
and was blessed with a mirror-like pure heart. During the lifetime
of Baha'u'llah there were some outstanding teachers who were almost
worshipped by the believers. One of them, who had so many exalted
tablets from Baha'u'llah, often went to Banum Gawhar's house.
She respected him to the point of cleaning his shoes. Such respect
and adoration by the believers, together with the tablets from
Baha'u'llah, went to the head of some of them who thought of
assuming an independent rank in the Cause.

After the Ascension of Baha'u'llah, one day this teacher visited
-
Khanum Gawhar who, as usual, brought tea and sweets and stood at
the door with folded arms in absolute humility. She noticed that
the teacher was quite gloomy and bitter, so she asked for the
reason. He said, "I must go to the Holy Land and see to the affairs
of the Cause myself. The Faith is left in the hands of a young
man. 'I The last phrase was stated with indignation and pride.
You like to know that when Baha'u'llah ascended, Abdu'l-Baha was
forty-eight years old.     Khanum Gawhar, contrary to the usual
protocol, raised her voiceand said, "Do you think Baha'u'llah
did not know who to appoint after Himself?" With these words she
took the refreshments away, and ordered the arrogant man to leave
her house and never come back.   She warned all of the neighboring
Baha'i families about his attitude and cautioned them to wait until
they hear from Abdu'l-Baha.   It did not take too long before that
man ws cast out as a covenant-breaker, and all who had adored him,
abandoned him. What a miserable ending!

H e i s t h e King, t h e All-Knowing, t h e Wise!

V e r i l y , t h i s i s t h a t Most Great Beauty, f o r e t o l d i n t h e Books of
t h e Messengers, through Whom t r u t h s h a l l be d i s t i n g u i s h e d from

H e is t h e T r e e of L i f e t h a t b r i n g e t h f o r t h t h e f r u i t s of God, t h e
E x a l t e d , t h e Powerful, t h e G r e a t .

0 Ahmad! Bear thou w i t n e s s t h a t v e r i l y He is God, and t h e r e i s
no God b u t H i m , t h e King, t h e P r o t e c t o r , t h e Incomparable, t h e
Omnipotent.   And t h a t t h e One Whom He h a t h s e n t f o r t h by t h e name
of A l i was t h e t r u e One from God, t o Whose commands w e a r e a l l
conforming.

Say: 0 people be o b e d i e n t t o t h e o r d i n a n c e s of God, which have
been e n j o i n e d i n t h e Bayan by t h e G l o r i o u s , t h e Wise One. V e r i l y ,
He i s t h e King of t h e Messengers, and H i s Book is t h e Mother Book,
d i d ye b u t know.          Thus d o t h t h e N i g h t i n g a l e u t t e r H i s c a l l u n t o
you from t h i s p r i s o n .     He h a t h b u t t o d e l i v e r t h i s c l e a r message.
Whosoever d e s i r e t h , l e t him t u r n a s i d e from t h i s c o u n s e l , and
whosoever d e s i r e t h , l e t him choose t h e p a t h t o h i s Lord.

0 p e o p l e , i f ye deny t h e s e v e r s e s , by what proof have ye b e l i e v e d
i n God? Produce i t , 0 assemblage of f a l s e o n e s . Nay, by t h e One
is Whose hand i s my s o u l , t h e y a r e n o t , and never s h a l l be a b l e
t o do t h i s , even should t h e y combine t o assist one a n o t h e r .

0 Ahmad!       F o r g e t n o t My b o u n t i e s w h i l e I am a b s e n t . Remember My
days d u r i n g t h y days and My d i s t r e s s and banishment i n t h i s remote
prison.      And be thou s o s t e a d f a s t i n My l o v e t h a t t h y h e a r t s h a l l

not waver, even if the swords of the enemies rain blows upon thee,
and all the heavens and the earth arise against thee. Be thou
as a flame of fire to My enemies and a river of life eternal to
My loved ones, and be not of those who doubt.

And if thou art overtaken by affliction in My path, or degradation
for My sake, be not thou troubled thereby. Rely upon God, thy
God and the Lord of thy fathers. For the people are wandering
in the paths of delusion, bereft of discernment to see God with
their own eyes, or hear His Melody with their own ears. Thus have
We found them, as thou also dost witness. Thus have their
superstitions become veils between them and their own hearts and
kept them from the path of God, the Exalted, the Great.

Be thou assured in thyself that, verily, he who turns away from
this Beauty hath also turned away from the Messengers of the past,
and showeth pride towards God from all eternity to all eternity.

Learn well this Tablet, 0 Ahmad. Chant it during thy days and
withhold not thyself therefrom. For verily, God hath ordained
for the one who chants it the reward of a hundred martyrs and a
service in both worlds.

These favors have We bestowed upon thee as a bounty on Our part
and a mercy from Our presence, that thou mayest be of those who
are grateful.

By God! Should one who is in affliction or grief read this Tablet
with absolute sincerity, God will dispel his sadness, solve his
difficulties and remove his afflictions.

Verily, He is the Merciful, the Compassionate.   Praise be to God,
the Lord of all the worlds.
