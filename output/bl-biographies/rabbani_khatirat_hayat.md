Memories of My Life
Translation of Mírzá Habíbu’lláh Afnán’s Khátirát-i-Hayát1

Ahang Rabbani
Houston, Independent Scholar

In the name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Luminous.

Recently, I received a letter from the National Spiritual Assembly of the
Bahá‟ís of Iran – may God always sustain its pillars. It urged me to write an
autobiography detailing what I have witnessed in life and to present it to that
sanctified Assembly.

What I have written below is a brief sketch of the 74 years of the Bahá‟í life
of this ephemeral servant, Habíbu‟lláh Afnán-i-A`lá‟í. My purpose is to
offer, from memory or notes I have kept, a summary of my recollections and
of what I have heard or seen. This particularly relates to the period during
which I was reared through the loving-kindness of the illustrious wife of the
Báb and her sister [Zahrá Bagum], and the hallowed time that I spent in the
presence of the Blessed Perfection and the Center of His Covenant.

God willing, I will endeavor to offer a short history of the Blessed House of
the Báb – the site of pilgrimage for all the denizens of the Supreme Ark.

Childhood and Early Life in Shiraz

My name is Habíbu‟lláh2 and I am the fourth child of Áqá Mírzá Áqá, who
was honored by Bahá‟u‟lláh with the title Núri‟d-Dín [the Light of
Religion]. I was born on 1 Muharram 1292 A.H. [7 February 1875], in the

respect, Núri‟d-Dín asked Bahá‟u‟lláh to give his young son a different name, so that he would not be a namesake
of Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s son, Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí (1853-1937). Granting his wish, Bahá‟u‟lláh named the young
pilgrim, Habíbu‟llah [Beloved of God]. From then on, he was known by this name and it was used in all
subsequent Tablets by Bahá‟u‟lláh and `Abdu‟l-Bahá.

city of Shíráz, and raised by the loving and compassionate hands of the wife
of the Báb3.

I was no more than four years old when Shiraz was plunged into turmoil as
a result of the martyrdom of the illustrious [Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-
Husayn], the Mahbúbu‟sh-Shuhadá [the Beloved of Martyrs], and [Áqá
Mírzá Muhammad-Hasan], the Sultánu‟sh-Shuhadá [the King of Martyrs],
in Isfahán.4

At that time, the Qajar prince Farhád Mírzá, the Mu‟tami‟d-Dawlih, was the
governor-general5 of Fárs, and he was especially antagonistic towards the
Cause. There was great commotion in Shiraz. The merchants in the bazaar
and custom offices, as well as the shopkeepers and traders, spoke constantly
of the events in Isfahán. The elders of the Bahá‟í community were
particularly concerned since, only a short time earlier, three believers in
Shiraz had been martyred by the enemies. A number of friends gathered and
consulted about the difficult situation. They concluded that, among the
believers, my father, Áqá Mírzá Áqá, was the most renowned as a Bahá‟í.
Therefore, if the foes plotted to commit injustices against the community,
they would certainly be directed against him. They said, “From the very
beginning, because of his devotion to the Faith, Áqá Mírzá Áqá has allowed
everyone to learn of his attachment to this Cause. Should trouble now be
directed against him, others would suffer as well.” Each one of them spoke
in a similar manner, until they unanimously resolved that it was best for my
father not to remain in Shiraz, but to leave immediately for Búshihr and
head to Bombay [India].

Afterwards, the entire consultative body6 came to our house and informed
my father of its decision. They noted that, in light of the turmoil in Shiraz
and all the talk among the people, it would be wise for him to depart
immediately for Búshihr.

Within 24 hours, my father left for Bombay. He entrusted our mother and
sister, and us five brothers, to the joint care of Hájí Mírzá Abdu‟l-Qasim-i-

The martyrdom of these two brothers took place on 17 March 1879. For details see: Ishráq Khávarí,

The term governor-general will be used throughout to refer to civil ruler at the provincial level.

On the election of the first Spiritual Assembly of Shiraz in 1908, see In the Land of Refuge,
(forthcoming), chapter 16. Before this Assembly was formed, as bidden by Bahá‟u‟lláh, the community benefited
from an unstructured consultative body, where the elders and prominent believers discussed local affairs and
advised the friends. For example, see Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s Tablet to Núri‟d-Dín dated 4 Rabí`u‟l-Avval 1301 A.H. [2
January 1884] in Núri‟d-Dín Collection of Tablets, p. 70, in which each locality was asked to form a consultative
body to assist the believers.

Afnán, the older brother of Khadíjih Bagum, and our paternal grandmother
[Zahrá Bagum], a sister of the aforementioned Hájí.

Khadíjih Bagum

The wife of the Báb was a maternal aunt to my father and a paternal aunt to
my mother [Maryam-Sultan Bagum]. As such, she was intimately concerned
with our upbringing. She tried her utmost to ensure that, from the earliest
age, we would flourish under the canopy of God‟s Cause. This was the
greatest blessing of our lives. Whatever spiritual perspicacity I may possess,
the faith that I consider to be the source of my salvation, the blessing of
beholding the Countenance of God [Bahá‟u‟lláh], and all the other blessings
of this life that have unfailingly been the lot of this lowly servant are all due
entirely to the favors and care of the esteemed wife of the Báb. That link to
the Most Great Infallibility [the Báb] remained faithful to the Covenant of
God until her final breath. I beseech her to intercede on behalf of this
servant for the confirmations of the Concourse on High.

At the age of seven [circa 1882], I was sent to the traditional elementary
school in Masjid-i-Naw7, Shiraz, along with my older brother, the late Hájí
Mírzá Buzurg-i-Afnán. There, we were taught by the respected Hájí Mírzá
Muhammad-Sádiq, who was a great admirer of the Báb and ranked among
the most esteemed of the city‟s recognized citizens.

During this time, the wife of the Báb became severely depressed due to her
disappointment over not being able to visit Bahá‟u‟lláh. Shortly after, as a
result of contracting dysentery, she passed on to the Abha Kingdom, thus
depriving us of her infinite loving-kindness and unsurpassed spiritual
qualities. After the ritual washing [of her body] at the Hammam-i-Khayri
(otherwise known as Guldastih), her earthly remains were interred in a
sacred shrine.

Addressing my late father, Áqá Mírzá Áqá, Bahá‟u‟lláh revealed a special
Tablet of Visitation in the ever-brilliant memory of Khadíjih Bagum, which
extols her exalted station and bestows the grace of God upon her. ... 8 From
these exalted Words [of Bahá‟u‟lláh], her brilliant station is most evident.

A prominent mosque constructed during the rule of Ibn-i-Zangi of the Atabakan dynasty. This
classroom is located on the eastern corner of the mosque.

At this point, Mírzá Habíb quotes portions of this Tablet of Visitation. However, the Bahá‟í World
Centre has indicated that they will publish a translation of this Tablet in due course. Bahá‟u‟lláh. “Lawh-i-Ziyarat-

The Báb at the Masjid-i-Vakíl

Several years after Khadíjih Bagum‟s passing, when I was 13 years old and
still studying under the tutelage of the late Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Sadiq-i-
Mu`allim, the honored `Andalíb9 arrived in Shiraz from Yazd. I remember
well how that `Andalíb would set out for his afternoon walk around [my
school at] Masjid-i-Naw. Because he was a poet, calligrapher and
accomplished gilder, and had become renowned throughout Shiraz, our
teacher invited him to our class one day. As was customary at the time, upon
arrival, he sat next to the Hájí on the floor. Because of our close kinship to
the Báb, our teacher treated my brother and I with the utmost consideration
throughout our school years, and he used to seat us near him in the front row
of the class. As a result, we could hear clearly everything that was said. On
that day, I was particularly attentive to what passed between the honored
`Andalíb and my late teacher.

Our teacher lit the waterpipe and offered it to `Andalíb, and the conversation
between the two of them began. For a while, they spoke of various topics.
At first, their discussion revolved around the art of poetry and the late
Mu`allim, [as a sign of respect], insisted that `Andalíb should teach the
science of prosody and rhyme to his son Mírzá Muhammad, who was
talented in calligraphy and occasionally composed verses as well. `Andalíb
showed humility, however, and eventually directed the conversation to
teaching the Faith. On that day, I realized that our teacher had a particular
fondness for the Báb and referred to Him reverently as the Jináb-i-Mírzá
[the honored Mírzá].

Our teacher then related the story of the day when the Báb arrived at the
Masjid-i-Vakíl. He stated:10

`Andalib [Nightingale] (d. 1920) was the sobriquet of Mírzá `Alí-Ashraf of Lahijan in the Caspian
province of Gilan. `Andalib was a poet of superb accomplishment and an eloquent teacher. A collection of his poems,
filling over 760 pages, was published in 1969 `Andalíb, `Alí Ashraf Láhíjání, Mírzá. Díván-i-`Andalíb. [Tehran]:

After relating this story, our late teacher commented, “I still have not
understood the implications of His saying, nor comprehended the reality of
His meaning, „I say the same that My Forefather, the Prophet, has said.‟”
“That is rather surprising,” `Andalíb responded, “as you yourself testify that

In numerous places, the Báb identifies the Day of Resurrection with His own Advent; see, for
example, The Persian Bayan 2:3 The Báb. Inna al- bayán. [Tehran?, s.n., 1947]. [Kitáb-i Bayán-i Fársí].

He and his father, Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí, the first Mushiru‟l-Mulk, were the viziers of Fars, in
succession, over a period of 40 years; see Afnán, Mírzá Habíbu‟llah. Tarikh-i Amri-yi Shiraz: History of the Cause

also.‟ Consider that the same sufferings that Muhammad endured were
indeed sustained by the Báb, and that the same Call that the Messenger of
God raised was also proclaimed by the Báb.”

Leaving Shiraz

In 1307 A.H. [1890], my maternal grandmother, Zahrá Bagum, the sister of
the Báb‟s wife, passed away. Only a few months later, Bahá‟u‟lláh
instructed our family to proceed to the Holy Land. My father wrote to us
[saying] that our oldest brother, Mírzá Jalál, was to remain in Shiraz to
protect, and serve at, the august House of the Báb. The rest of the family
was to join him in Port Said, where he was engaged in commerce [and from
there, to proceed to `Akká]. As a result, Mírzá Jalál married and established
himself in a residence next to the sacred House of the Báb.

At the beginning of the month of Safar 1308 A.H.17, we left Shiraz with a
caravan, traveling on horses and mules. Our group consisted of the
following: my mother, Maryam-Sultan Bagum; the mother of Áqá Mírzá
Hadiy-i-Afnán [Zivar Sultan Khánum]; my brothers, Áqá Mírzá Buzurg and
Áqá Mírzá Diya‟u‟llah; my sister, Tuba Khánum; myself; and an attendant
named Áqá Muhammad `Alí, who was a Bahá‟í from Káshán. At that time, I
was 16 years old.

Experiencing great hardship, we traveled the near-impassible and difficult
roads and arrived in Búshihr. The weather was oppressively hot and we all
fell ill. My sister was seriously ill and her condition was worse than the rest.
We languished like this for over 30 days, until a ship arrived from London
destined for Port Said. During our time in Búshihr, we stayed at the house of
one of our relatives, the late Hájí Mírzá `Abdu‟llah-Khán, the uncle of the
Múvaqqaru‟d-Dawlih. He was the Governor of Búshihr and the southern
ports, and the representative of the British government for commerce and
political affairs. He had been instrumental in freeing Muhammad Khán-i-
Balúch from trouble in Shiraz.18

After we left Búshihr and were on the high seas, difficulties intensified and
we were assailed from every direction by tremendous hardship, distress and
suffering. At one time, near the port of Masqat, we faced severe storms that
lasted about ten hours and our ship had to weather the huge waves of an
angry sea. That incident was not quite over and we had not had any rest,
when a hole developed in the side of our ship, which nearly caused her to
sink. And then, for the third time, the ship‟s engine caught fire. But
eventually, through the infinite grace and bounty of the Ancient Beauty, we
reached Port Said unscathed and our ship anchored.

Circa 16 September 1890

See In the Land of Refuge.

When we disembarked, we did not know where to go or what to do, so we
stood perplexed in a corner and occupied ourselves in conversation. Then
my older brother, the late Áqá Siyyid Áqáy-i-Afnán, who was fluent in
English and Arabic, arrived and greeted us warmly. After several years of
separation, we were seeing each other again. He took us to his home and, on
the way, we saw our father, who was on his way to welcome us. Tenderly, he
embraced each one of us and showered us with his love and affection. At
long last, the grace of God had surrounded us and the hardship of the
journey was over.

First Pilgrimage: In the Presence of Bahá’u’lláh

We stayed in Port Said for seven months, until my late father wrote to
Bahá‟u‟lláh seeking permission for us to attain His presence. Permission
was granted.

Arrival at Haifa

We left Port Said on 7 Dhi‟l-Hajjih 1308 A.H. [14 July 1891], spent the next
day aboard the ship and, that evening, arrived at the port of Haifa. At dawn
on 9 Dhi‟l-Hajjih, the ship anchored at the port of Haifa, and, with intense
eagerness and anticipation, we got ready to disembark. [The prospect of
fulfilling] our life-long desire to place our brow at His Most Holy Threshold
and gaze on the Countenance of the Beloved of the world overjoyed us. The
thought of being able to kiss the ground He walked on - an act that was the
highest aspiration of the bygone Prophets and saints - caused our beings to
tremble with extreme delight. With great humility, we called to mind that we
were about to set foot on a land that the spirit of the Holy Ones, Prophets of
old, and Manifestations of past ages circumambulated in adoration. Tears of
joy flowed uncontrollably from our eyes. My brother [Áqá Siyyid Áqá],
who, along with our father, had attained the presence of Bahá‟u‟lláh19
before, was constantly counseling us about how we should behave in the
presence of the Blessed Perfection. He emphasized that, at His Threshold,
we must be the essence of submissiveness and reverence.20

Eventually, the first believer to welcome us came on the boat. It was the late
honored Manshádí21. In accordance with the Blessed Beauty‟s instructions,
he arranged for our landing, guided us through customs and, from there, led

served in many capacities.

Carmel. For this unique visit and as a sign of respect, a special Arabic
custom was prepared for us. But there was no time to change and we went
along in our European-style clothing. I well remember that the sun had not
quite come up over the crest of the mountains, and the air was particularly
fresh and vivifying. [As we waited by His tent], the honored Manshádí was
asking about Shiraz and the friends. Suddenly, Mírzá Mustafa, [later] known
as Abu Hurayrih22, an attendant of Bahá‟u‟lláh who in later years broke the
Covenant23, appeared and guided us to His house24 and to the blessed
Presence. Our one ardent wish was realized! He held aside the curtain and
we saw the Blessed Beauty standing in the middle of the room. When we
saw His sacred Figure and luminous Visage, we became utterly oblivious of
all else, as tears poured from our eyes. Overwhelmed, we circumambulated
His blessed Person.

Bahá‟u‟lláh invited us to sit. He sat on the mandar. With the utmost respect,
we four brothers sat on the floor on our heels. On our right, Mírzá Áqá Jan
was in attendance and the samovar was brewing tea in front of him.
Bahá‟u‟lláh said, “Pour tea for the young Afnáns. They have just come
ashore.” Then the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these sweet words, “O flowers
of the rose-garden of the honored Afnán! You are welcome; you are
welcome. Your departure from Shiraz was very difficult and tiring. The
divine will and the resoluteness of the honored Afnán brought you to this
threshold of holiness. During your sea journey, dangers beset you and God
protected you. Consider, this very day several thousand people are treading
the ground between Safa and Marwih [on one foot].25 The Beloved of the
world of being is present in this land, but they are oblivious. All are
heedless; all are unaware; all are uninformed. You are the true pilgrims.”
Three times He repeated, “You are the true pilgrims!” At that moment, as I
sat enraptured and listening attentively to the utterances of the Desire of the
world, these lines of Rúmí26 came to my mind:

> O pilgrims on pilgrimage, where are ye, where are ye?

the Beloved is here, come hither ye, come hither ye.

> The Beloved is your neighbor, wall by wall;
> why in the wilderness lost are ye all?

Named after a fickle follower of Prophet Muhammad. He was the son of Mírzá Mustafay-i-Naraqi (d.
1867), who became a martyr in Tabriz; see Balyuzi, Bahá‟u‟lláh: The King of Glory, pp. 204-5 and 237-8.

After the ascension of Bahá‟u‟lláh, he became a follower of Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí. He lived towards the
end of his life near Tiberias, on a property belonging to Mírzá Majdi'd-Din (d. 1955), a nephew of Bahá‟u‟lláh.

During Bahá‟u‟lláh's sojourns in Haifa, houses in the German Templer colony would be rented for Him.

The Festival of Sacrifice (`Id-i-Qurban) occurs on the tenth day of Dhi‟l-Hajjih. Part of the rites of
pilgrimage includes traversing seven times the distance between two mounds where, according to traditions, Hagar ran
back and forth seven times, seeking a spring to quench her son‟s thirst.

At that very moment, the blessed Countenance turned to this servant and
said, “The mystics have also had something to say on this matter.” Once
again, He ordered more tea for us. After that, we left His presence.

With Bahá’u’lláh in Haifa

The house next to His blessed residence was rented for us. We lived in close
proximity to the house of the Abhá Beauty. Attaining His blessed threshold,
meeting the believers living in the Holy Land and consorting with the
veterans of the Faith had blotted everything else from our minds. The
sweetness of living and the spiritual ecstasies that we experienced in those
days lie beyond description. The pen is unable, and the words inadequate, to
convey those feelings.

Haifa was hot during these days. We were not familiar with, or accustomed
to, its climate and had a very difficult time, often falling ill. But the bounties
of our beloved Lord were measureless and the sea of His grace and
munificence was ever billowing. I remember well one day when we were
called to His presence at three o‟clock in the afternoon. I had a very bad
fever. My brothers dressed and prepared to attain His presence. I also got up
[from my bed] to accompany them, when my oldest brother tried to stop me
from going. He said, “Perhaps you are not allowed to attain Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s
presence in such a feverish condition.” I replied, “He is aware of my
condition.” I went into His presence. The Blessed Perfection turned to me
and said, “You have a fever,” at which I bowed my head. He continued,
“Fever is a product of this land. Whoever comes here must suffer from it.”
Then He ordered tea to be given to us. Immediately I began to perspire so
much that my clothes were soaked. Then the Blessed Perfection said, “Go
and change your clothes. Fever will not trouble you again.” Throughout the
remaining nine months we spent in the Holy Land, I did not suffer from
fever again.

After 15 days, my brother [Áqá Siyyid Áqá] returned to Port Said and my
father came [to Haifa]. My father was the recipient of infinite bounties and
kindness from the Blessed Perfection.

During these days in 1308 A.H. [1891], the episode of the seven martyrs of
Yazd took place. When the news was brought to Bahá‟u‟lláh, it caused Him
tremendous sorrow and anguish.27 For nine whole days, verses were not
revealed from the heaven of divine knowledge and no one was allowed into
His presence.

For a discussion of this tragic event, which was brought about by Mas`ud ibn Nasiri‟d-Din Zillu‟s-Sultan
(1949-1918) and his son, Husain Mírzá, Jalalu‟d-Dawlih (1870-1913), in the spring/summer of 1891, see: Bayda,

Accounts. Oxford: George Ronald, 1981, pp. 301-5.

On the ninth day, the friends were all summoned, and we had that honor too.
The deep grief that surrounded His Blessed Person was indescribable. He
spoke extensively about the Qájárs and their misdeeds. Afterwards, He
mentioned the events of Yazd. Sternly, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke of the
Jalálu‟d-Dawlih28 and Zillu‟s-Sultan: “Zillu‟s-Sultan29 wrote Us a letter in
his own handwriting and gave it to Hájí Sayyah 30 to bring. He asked Us to
help him, with [the support of] the Bábís, to destroy his Sháh-Bábá31. „If
You do this‟, he wrote, „I will give You liberty; I will give You official
recognition; I will help and support You; I will make amends for the past.
Whatever Sháh-Bába did, I will do just the opposite.‟ The entire letter was
full of such statements. The answer We gave him was this: „Praying for the
Sháh is obligatory for both you and Us. Never again write to Us in this vein.
Never again put such requests to this Wronged One. We have arisen to
improve the morals of a number of people wronged in this world. If We
were after leadership, what authority would have been better than holding
the position of a minister in Iran?‟ When he received this answer from Us,
he despaired of Us, and is now behaving in this manner. Were We to send
his letter to Nasiri‟d-Din Sháh, he would skin him alive. But God is the
Concealer. He draws veils over the deeds of His servants.” Then He said,
“Do not be sad; do not be downcast; do not let your hearts bleed. The sacred
tree of the Cause of God is watered by the blood of the martyrs. Unless
watered, a tree does not grow and bear fruit. Before long, you will see the
name of the Qájárs obliterated, and the land of Iran cleansed of the filth of
their existence and the odor of their names.”

Regarding the Jalálu‟d-Dawlih, the Blessed Perfection said, “This
ungrateful one has done what has caused the eyes of the denizens of the
Supreme Concourse to shed tears of blood.” Just 32 years from that day, the
rule of the Qájárs came to an end and they were overthrown. After nine
days, the first Tablet revealed from the heaven of divine will was the Lawh-
i-Dunyá [Tablet of the World]32, with which our father was honored. That
reference to the oppression of the Jalálu‟d-Dawlih can be read in this Tablet:
“The tyrant of the land of Yá (Yazd) committed that which has caused the
Concourse on High to shed tears of blood.”33 That night, Bahá‟u‟lláh gave a
copy of the Tablet of the World, in the handwriting of Zaynu‟l-Muqarrabin,

Sultan-Husayn Mírzá, the eldest son of Zillu‟s-Sultan, was made the deputy governor of Fars at the
age of 13. In 1888, he was appointed the governor-general of Yazd and, to amass a personal fortune, killed a large
number of people, including seven believers. He was dismissed from the office in 1892, but re-appointed to it in
1903 when, once again, he launched a Bahá‟í pogrom in which nearly 100 believers perished. During the
Constitutional Revolt of 1905-11, he sided with the revolution and the despotic Muhammad-`Alí Sháh (1872-
1925) imprisoned him for a while, ordered him stripped of his estate, and eventually exiled him to Europe. For a
biography, see Sharh-i Hal-i Rijal-i Iran 2:77-80.

For a biography, see In the Land of Refuge.

Hájí Muhammad-`Alíy-i-Sayyah-i-Mahallati (1836-1924) was an attendant of Zillu‟s-Sultan and his
autobiography is published under the title, Khatirat Haji Sayyah, edited by Hamid Sayyad.

His father, Nasiri‟d-Din Sháh (r. 1848-1896), had not selected Zillu‟s-Sultan as the heir to the throne.

to my late brother, Hájí Mírzá Buzurg. He commented, “At the beginning of
this Tablet, mention has been made of your father, the Afnán. We therefore
bestow it upon you.”

With Bahá’u’lláh in `Akká

Fifteen days after my father arrived and the days of our attainment were
drawing to a close, an epidemic of cholera broke out in Syria and Lebanon.
The government set up quarantine around the borders. My father asked for
permission to leave, but Bahá‟u‟lláh did not grant it, remarking: “While the
epidemic rages, you are not to leave.” For us, this was the supreme felicity.
Autumn came and the air of Haifa and `Akká improved. The Blessed
Perfection moved from Haifa to the Mansion of Bahjí. We were provided
with a small house next to the blessed Mansion34. Our house was situated so
that we had a good view of His blessed chambers. When we got up at dawn
to say our prayers, most of the time we saw that His chamber was lit and
Tablets were being revealed. The Blessed Perfection was pacing the room
and the amanuensis was busy writing. I do not remember anyone other than
Mírzá Áqá Jan taking down the revealed Words in those days.

During that time, the late Mírzá Yúsuf Khán-i-Vujdání35 and the late Áqá
Siyyid Asadu‟llah-i-Qumí36 were tutoring the Aghsán in the Mansion. The
Blessed Perfection instructed my brothers, Hájí Mírzá Buzurg, Hájí Mírzá
Diyá‟ and myself to attend their lessons too. The late Mishkin-Qalam taught
us calligraphy. Every day, we went to the room on the ground floor of the
Mansion set aside as a classroom. There we received our tuition, and we
passed our precious days oblivious of all our blessings. Our father
constantly admonished us, so that we would never act improperly in the
presence of the Blessed Beauty or in the Mansion.

On the first day of Muharram 1309 A.H. [7 August 1891], the Blessed
Perfection celebrated the festival [of the anniversary of the birth of the Báb
by the lunar calendar]. He called together all the friends, and we attained
His presence as well. My father was corpulent and suffered from
rheumatism. He could not sit on the floor. The Blessed Perfection said,
“Bring a chair for the Afnán,” and one of the attendants provided a chair for
him. Bahá‟u‟lláh then said, “Bring chairs for his sons as well,” and so we
were all seated on chairs. The entire company of resident believers and
pilgrims were in His presence.

The date of Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s first arrival at the Mansion of Bahji is given as September 1879 in
Bahá‟u‟lláh: The King of Glory, p. 362. However, in a Tablet dated 11 Rabí`u‟l-Avval 1298 A.H. [11 February
1881], Bahá‟u‟lláh tells Núri‟d-Dín that it had been only a month since He arrived at the Mansion; see Núri‟d-
Dín‟s Collection, p. 43.

Previously, a mystic of the `Alí-Allahy order (also known as Ahl-i-Haqq). He was a renowned
teacher of the Faith from Kirmanshah.

A trusted believer who served in the Holy Land with distinction during the ministry of Bahá‟u‟lláh
and `Abdu‟l-Bahá.

On that day, His blessed utterances mainly concerned division and disunity
in religion. He stated, “Islam was a good religion, but they destroyed it.
Differences arose from the beginning of the Dispensation and, after the
ascension of the Prophet, the foundation of Islam was shattered. Division
first appeared in the house of the Prophet. When the Messenger of God
[Muhammad] was ill and His companions37 gathered about His deathbed,
He asked for a pen and paper to write His Will. `Umar said, „He is
delirious.‟ His Holiness `Alí responded, „Sickness and fever have no effect
on the condition of the Prophets; they are always inspired. Present Him with
writing materials and see what guidance He gives.‟ `Umar responded, „The
Book of God is sufficient unto us.‟ Those same words became the cause of
division, and the world and Islam have suffered since. The same words „the
Book of God is sufficient unto us‟ broke the back of the Prophet‟s daughter.
The same words „the Book of God is sufficient unto us‟ resulted in the
slaying of `Uthmán. The same words „the Book of God is sufficient unto us‟
brought about the Battle of Camels38. The same words „the Book of God is
sufficient unto us‟ split `Alí‟s forehead. The same words „the Book of God is
sufficient unto us‟ precipitated the episode of the land of Taf and the
martyrdom of Husayn ibn `Alí. The same words „the Book of God is
sufficient unto us‟ sent the House of Immaculacy39 into slavery and scattered
it in all directions. The same words „the Book of God is sufficient unto us‟
ultimately assailed the holy breast of the Exalted One [the Báb]. He then
raised His hand and stated, „Our enemies are also in Our sleeve.‟”

Afterwards, the Blessed Perfection, Himself, distributed baqlavá [baklava]40
to the friends present. He said, “This is the day on which Hadrat-i-
Mubashshir41 set foot in this nether world and illumined it with His dazzling
brilliance. There is every reason to rejoice.” He then dismissed us all. After
that, the friends gathered in smaller groups in the surrounding grounds of
the Mansion beneath the Spruce and fir trees and, with tremendous
excitement, repeated Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s words to ensure that they remembered
them accurately.

The next day, the second day of Muharram, was the anniversary of the birth
of the Lord of Days and the World of Being42. In the morning, all the
pilgrims, visitors and resident believers were summoned to the presence of
the All-Knowing One. Bahá‟u‟lláh spoke about the sublimity of His advent,
the power of the Most Exalted Pen, the circumstances of His exile, and the
arrival at the Most Great Prison. Then He spoke extensively about the

The Islamic traditions maintain that four believers were present: Abu Bakr, `Umar ibn Khattab, `Uthman
ibn Affan and `Alí ibn Talib; see Taherzadeh, Adib. The Covenant of Bahá‟u‟lláh. Oxford: George Ronald, 1992., p.

aggression and transgressions of the tyrants and divines. He said, “Nasiri‟d-
Din Shah and `Abdu‟l-`Aziz both transgressed against Us and harmed the
body of the Cause of God, but the tyranny of `Abdu‟l-`Aziz was by far the
more severe, because he banished, without any reason, the Wronged One of
the worlds to the Most Great Prison. Nasiri‟d-Din Sháh, however, because
of the ignorant action of the believers in the early days of the Cause,
whenever he strokes his limbs and feels the pellets under his skin 43, is
roused in anger to commit these harsh deeds and adopt tyrannical measures
against the friends, spilling the blood of innocent people. Notwithstanding
all these injuries inflicted upon them by the Sháh and the government, the
friends do not stop practicing their Faith openly and do not observe wisdom.
You cannot blame them, because two great festivals have been joined into
one44, foreshadowing a brilliant future for the Cause of God in all corners of
the world.” Then the Blessed Perfection spoke these two verses45:

> “These times more bitter than venom shall pass,
> And once again, times as sweet as sugar shall come our way.”

When He finished His blessed words, He graced us with sweetmeats and we
left His presence.

The glad tidings uttered on that day by the Author of the Cause were
realized not long after, when the hand of His believers raised the banner of
God‟s religion in various corners of the world: the Western countries, the
provinces of India, `Ishqábád, and many other territories of the globe. In the
early years of the ministry of the Center of the Covenant, the first group of
American pilgrims, with utmost humility and indescribable gratitude,
arrived in the Holy Land and attained the presence of the Appointed Beauty.

I have already mentioned that our house was adjacent to the blessed
Mansion. Our practice was to wake at dawn to carry out our devotions,
recite Tablets of Visitation and perform our daily obligatory prayers. One
morning, before sunrise, an attendant came with the news that the Blessed
Perfection was coming to our house. In this way, He placed the crown of
everlasting honor upon the heads of these humble servants. The tiding made
us weep uncontrollably with joy and we hurried out [to welcome Him]. We
saw His blessed Person coming towards our house with great majesty and
glory. We all prostrated, kissed His feet and made the earth trodden by His
blessed feet the kohl of our eyes. Each one of us in turn was favored with
His tender blessings and was given a share of His infinite generosity. He
went inside our house and, in doing so, conferred upon us an everlasting
honor. I offered Him a cup of tea. The Tongue of Grandeur stated, “Well

done!” He drank half of it and gave the rest to me. He also gave me a black
rosary made of dark olive-wood that He was carrying. I kissed His hands.
That rosary, which has been as dear to me as life itself, is now placed in the
Archives of the House of the Báb in Shiraz.

Again, I have mentioned that His blessed chamber was visible from our
house. We saw Him several times at dawn and early morning while He
spoke the revealed Word. Mírzá Áqá Jan wrote it down as He uttered it.
Mírzá Áqá Jan used to have several reed pens well cut and pointed, with ink
and paper ready. The flow of divine verses from the heaven of Revelation
was swift. It was like a surging ocean. Mírzá Áqá Jan wrote as quickly as he
could - so quickly that, at times, the pen slipped out of his hand. He would
promptly take up another pen. There were times when he could not keep up
and would say: “I can‟t write.” Then the Blessed Perfection would repeat
what He had spoken.

The Blessed Perfection instructed my brother, Hájí Mírzá Buzurg, to make a
copy of Qasídiy-i-`Izz-i-Varqá‟íyyih46. When he had finished the task and
presented it, he received much commendation and praise from Bahá‟u‟lláh,
and was favored with a pen-case made in Isfahán, which held a silver
inkstand. That pen-case is now held in the Archives of the Blessed House
[of the Báb].

On another occasion, Bahá‟u‟lláh called me by myself and, after showering
His indescribable blessings on me, stated, “We have asked Mírzá Yúsuf
Khán and Siyyid Assadu‟llah to pay particular attention to your lessons and
instructions.” I bowed down. With His blessed hands, He gave me a bottle
of rose-water saying, “This rose-water comes from Qamsar of Káshán. It
has taken 40 days to reach this land. God has created this rose-water for
such a day as this, which is the Prince of days.” He then dismissed me. I had
the bottle of rose-water until not long ago, and some of the friends would
use it to perfume their faces and hairs. Now I deeply regret not having saved
what was given to me by the Hands of the divine sovereignty of the Blessed
Perfection.

One evening, Abu-Hurayrih announced that the Beloved of the world had
decided to visit the Garden of Junaynih47 on the following morning and had
asked all pilgrims and resident believers to accompany Him. I speak the
truth when I say, the joy of knowing that we would be in the presence the
Blessed Beauty for several hours the next day kept me awake that night until
morning. At times, I was rapt in supplication and prayer, and at other
moments filled with euphoria and excitement. The night passed in this way
and, at early dawn, I faced His blessed chamber offering prayers of

thanksgiving and praise. Before sunrise, we all gathered by the gate of the
Mansion. An hour later, Bahá‟u‟lláh came downstairs. A white donkey was
brought for Him to ride on it. This donkey was a gift of the late Áqá
Ghulam-`Alíy-i-Kashi and Áqá Muhammad-Hashim-i-Káshí. The rest of the
friends followed Him on foot towards Junaynih. Hájí Khavar48, a resident of
the Holy Land for many years and a fairly tall man, held an umbrella over
the head of Bahá‟u‟lláh to protect Him from the sun. The air was extremely
fresh and invigorating. We sensed that, from the pleasant air of `Akká, the
spirit of the poet of Shiraz had soared with the verse:

> The morning breeze is fragrant as ambergris today,
> As my beloved moves towards the meadow.

Eventually, we reached the Garden, which had been prepared by attendants
and believers. They had assembled all the items necessary for receiving the
Blessed Perfection and the other friends. The Garden paths were very
charming and attractive. The trees, grass, flowers and orchard danced with
joy in the breeze, while the sweet-singing birds were crying out in ecstasy
and merriment, all praising the grace and blessing of the presence of their
Beloved. On that day, the Countenance of the Blessed Perfection radiated
with the greatest joy and He paid tribute to and commended each of the
friends. In such an atmosphere, lunch was served.

After lunch, all the believers were present at yet another spiritual gathering
in Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s presence. It was then that `Abdu‟l-Bahá arrived from the
city [of `Akká] and the Ancient Beauty commanded us: “The Master 49 is
coming. Hasten to welcome Him.” I should note that a similar event
occurred on several other occasions. I will describe the details at a later
stage. It was evident that, from that time, the Blessed Perfection was
planting in the spirit and hearts of the friends seeds of humility,
submissiveness, mindfulness of the Covenant and faithfulness towards Him
Whom God hath purposed [`Abdu‟l-Bahá]. He would always teach the
believers about the exalted station and hidden reality of the beloved Master.

And so we went out to welcome `Abdu‟l-Bahá and, in His company, once
again attained the presence of Bahá‟u‟lláh. With extreme humility and
attention, `Abdu‟l-Bahá sat in His presence and gave permission for the
pilgrims to sit as well. Then, the Tongue of Purity spoke words with this
meaning: “The garden was not pleasant enough this morning. But now, with
the arrival of the Master, it has become most pleasant.” Then, turning
towards `Abdu‟l-Bahá, He observed, “It would have been exceedingly good
if you had come this morning.” `Abdu‟l-Bahá replied, “The Mutasarrif
Pasha and some other of the city‟s inhabitants sent word that they were
coming. On Your behalf, I had to receive them and offer them hospitality.”

An attendant of Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s household.

The word „Áqá‟ has been used throughout the original as the term Bahá‟u‟lláh used to refer to `Abdu‟l-
Bahá. This has been rendered as „the Master.‟

The Blessed Perfection smiled and said, “The Master is Our shield and the
shield of everyone else. All live at ease, all know utmost comfort and
tranquility. Associating with men such as these is very, very difficult. It is
the Master who stands up to everything and supplies the means for the well-
being and peace of all the friends. May God preserve Him from the evil of
the envious and inimical.” “One day in Baghdad,” Bahá‟u‟lláh continued, “a
beggar asked for alms. We gave him one majídí50 and he told Us: „Go in
peace, young man; may Hadrat-i-`Abbás51 give you support.‟ He prayed for
Us – it was a good prayer.”

In short, on that day, the blessings of Bahá‟u‟lláh towards all [of us] were
extremely generous. About an hour before sunset, the Sovereign of the
world decided to return to the Mansion and, as in the morning, we all
walked back. At the gate, we were dismissed from His presence.

The distance between the city of `Akká and the Mansion is about four to
five kilometers. The Bagh-i-Jamál is one of the gardens on the outskirts of
the city, near the Mansion. When you pass by this garden, one comes within
full view of the Mansion. The door to the chamber of the Blessed Perfection
opened this way. Whenever `Abdu‟l-Bahá approached by this route on a
steed, He would dismount as soon as the Mansion came into view and walk
the rest of the way to the Mansion with the utmost humility and reverence.

One day, all the friends and the Aghsán were in Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s presence. I
well remember that among them were the following: Nabíl-i-A`zam, Afnán-
i-Kabír, Áqá Ridá [Qannád] Shírází, Ustád Muhammad-`Alíy-i-Salmání52,
Mishkin-Qalam, my late father, and attendants such as Áqá Muhammad-
Hasan of the Pilgrim House. Suddenly, the Blessed Perfection turned round
to look at the plain and, seeing `Abdu‟l-Bahá approaching the Mansion,
said, “The Master is coming; go and welcome Him.” We all hurried out and
attained the presence of “Him round Whom all names revolve”53 and, in His
company, went back to the presence of the Blessed Perfection.

On that day, Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí54, the other Aghsán, Mírzá Áqá Jan,

During Bahá‟u‟lláh's ministry, Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí was known by the title Ghusn-i-Akbar (the Greater
Branch). After he broke the Covenant, believers referred to him as the Naqid-i-Akbar (the Arch-Covenant-breaker), a
title Mírzá Habíb uses for him throughout the text. However, for clarity, his given name is used in this translation.

time, however, these same people were among the Covenant-breakers and,
with the greatest vehemence and infidelity, rose against the Cause of God.
After the ascension of the Blessed Perfection, this servant himself witnessed
their treachery, betrayal, hypocrisy and imposture. During that period, which
outwardly constituted Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s final days in this nether world, His
words mostly focused on the issues of the protection of the Covenant and
firmness in the divine Testament. On that occasion, He fervently
admonished the people of the world to remain loyal to the Covenant and not
to raise the standard of discord in the Cause of God. Then He raised His
blessed hand and, pointing to the Aghsáns and Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí, said,
“Should one of Our Aghsán ever for a moment pass out from the shadow of
the Cause, he will cease to be of any consequence.” These words, emanating
from the Source of compassion and the Heaven of divine will, were spoken
so forcibly and with such a strong resonance that all in His presence were
thunderstruck and shaken to their very core.

Another day, when we were in the presence of the Blessed Perfection, Mírzá
Diyá‟u‟lláh56 came in to ask, “Áqá seeks permission for us all to go with the
friends to the Garden of Junaynih.” “Who has said this?” Bahá‟u‟lláh
inquired, to which Mírzá Diyá‟u‟lláh replied, “Áqáy-i-Ghusn-i-Akbar.”
Sternly, Bahá‟u‟lláh said, “There is only one Áqá; all the others have names.
That one Áqá is „Him round Whom all names revolve‟, the Ghusn-i-
A`zam.”57 Throughout those days, the blessed Person of the Ancient Beauty
used various statements and means to educate the friends on the sacred
station of `Abdu‟l-Bahá and warn them against breaking the divine
Covenant. He constantly affirmed the unique and exalted station of the
beloved Master so that the satanic whispers and intrigues of the enemies of
God‟s Cause would not lead those clinging to the Sure Handle58 away from
the straight path, or cause the inhabitants of the Crimson Ark to drown in the
sea of neglect and ignorance.

One late afternoon, we were in the presence of Bahá‟u‟lláh in the Garden of
Ridván. The air was very fresh and redolent, and it was raining lightly. He
spoke about the days in Baghdad and the harm inflicted upon the Cause of
God by the Azalis59. He said, “Consider how unfair and truly void of faith
they are. Because of the Mu`tamu‟d-Dawlih‟s supplications in Isfahán, the
Primal Point took the sister of Rajab-`Alí [Qahyir] as a wife so that she
could look after His household needs. After the great Martyrdom and the
most mighty Tragedy60, notwithstanding the explicit Text forbidding

An allusion to the religion of God; see, for instance, Bahá‟u‟lláh, The Kitab-i-Aqdas, pp. 61-62.

The text refers to the followers of Mírzá Yahya Azal (1831-1912) as “Yamutiha” (literally: the dead).

The martyrdom of the Báb took place on 9 July 1850.

marriage with the Báb‟s wives61, with utmost impudence, Azal at first took
her as a wife and then, having absolutely no sense of shame or compunction,
gave her to Siyyid Muhammad-i-Isfahání.62 This act resulted in the mother
of the Báb refusing to give her allegiance to the Faith for some time.” As He
spoke these words, the sorrow on His Countenance was evident and the
friends, especially my father, were greatly affected and wept bitterly. Then
the Blessed Perfection said, “Do not grieve. Praise be to God, the mother of
that Blessed Being came to believe at the end. Their station is well above
the conception of peoples and the understanding of Our servants.”

Then, He continued to recall the days of Baghdad: “One day, several of the
clergy came to visit Us. One of them asked, „Where are you from?‟ „We are
from `Amá63,‟ We responded. He asked further, „Where is `Amá? What sort
of place is that?‟ We replied, „`Amá has a pleasant, heavenly air; the trees
are fruitful; the plain is lusciously green; the rivers are flowing; its
inhabitants are spiritual people.‟ He asked, „Is it possible for us to go there?‟
We responded, „No, it is impossible. Your place is not there.‟”

He then related, “The day We left Baghdad, We moved to the Garden of
Najíb Pasha and stayed there for 12 days. Each day, scores of the city‟s
inhabitants came to visit Us and bid Us farewell. One day, among those who
came was a group of the learned theologians. After attaining Our presence,
one of them said, „We were anticipating the appearance of the promised
Mihdí, and the Siyyid-i-Shirází came forward with a claim. A number
became His followers, gathered around Him, and did certain things. After
that, we expected the manifestation of Husayn, and now You claim that
Station. What are we to do now?‟ On that day,” Bahá‟u‟lláh continued, “We
told them what they were to do and said to them, „You are to continue
reading Sharh-i-Lam`ah and Saybawayh64 until you return to where you
belong.‟”

The Text of the Báb‟s injunction has not been located so far. However, there is a Qur‟anic verse
(Surah al-Ahzab) that provides for this restriction: “Nearer of kin to the faithful is the Prophet, than they are to
their own selves. His wives are their mothers.”

During the Báb‟s six-month sojourn in Isfahan, He married Fatimih (1822?-1916), the sister of Mulla
Rajab-`Alíy-i Qahir, a prominent Bábí of that city. Some time after the Báb‟s martyrdom, she traveled to Baghdad,
where she came under the influence of Siyyid Muhammad Isfahani and Mírzá Yahya Azal. Despite the Báb‟s
injunction forbidding marriage with either of His wives after Him, Azal married her. A month later, however, after
protests from his other wives, Azal divorced Fatimih and gave her in marriage to Siyyid Muhammad. She died in
December 1916 in Tihran, aged 84. For further details, see Balyuzi, Hasan M. Edward Granville Browne and the
Bahá‟í Faith. London: George Ronald, 1970, pp. 34-5 n. 3.

Rendered typically as „eternal,‟ „immortal,‟ or „divine,‟ this term has many connotations, which all
mean „that which pertains to God‟. An Islamic hadith maintains that Muhammad was asked, “Where is God?” and
He responded, “In `amá.”

Both texts are used in the Shi`i seminarian training. The complete title of Sharh-i-Lum`ah is ar-Rawdat
al-bahiyyah fi sharh al-lum`ah al-Dimashqiyah and was authored by Shaykh Zaynu‟l-`Abidin Shahid ath-Thani
(1506-1559). It is an exposition of al-Lum`ah ad-Dimashqiyya by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Makk Shahid al-Awwal
(1333-1380). The text is used today in the madrassihs for teaching jurisprudence (fiqh) at the secondary (sutuh)
level. The second reference, Saybawayh, is named after a Shirazi jurist whose resting-place is located in Sang-i-Siyah,
near the Masjid-i-Mushir (see Fasa‟i, Tarikh Farsnamih-i-Nasiri, vol. 2, pp. 1021-3).

On another day, the Blessed Perfection mentioned the days of Baghdad and
the tyranny and oppression of Shaykh `Abdu‟l-Husayn [Tihrani]65, saying,
“With the aid of Nasiri‟d-Din Sháh and [Sultan] `Abdu‟l-`Aziz, Shaykh
`Abdu‟l-Husayn tried hard to extinguish the light of God‟s Cause. But the
effulgence of the Faith of God has illuminated the East and the West, and
the vengeance and victory of the religion of God has made the necks of
sovereigns bow down in humility. Before long, you will see all systems
rolled up, and the peoples and nations of the world gather under the shade of
the canopy of the Cause of God.”

He then said, “Another day in Baghdad, a learned divine came to see Us. He
had a tall, heavy frame and thick beard, was quite corpulent and was
wearing a large turban. He greeted Us with a guttural tone and, when he sat
down, began to recite convoluted and incomprehensible Arabic verses. We
said to him, „Kindly introduce yourself so that We might learn something
about you.‟ He said, „I am the seal of the ecclesiastics.‟ We responded,
„Insha‟lláh, insha‟lláh.‟” On that day, the Blessed Perfection was extremely
joyous and smiled frequently. He said, “Pray that God does not create
another sect like the Shi`i.”

On another day, Bahá‟u‟lláh spoke of Mullá `Alíy-i-Sabzivari66, saying,
“When Mullá `Alí was led to the place of his martyrdom, he instructed the
executioner to open one of his veins. When a bit of his throat was cut, with
his own sacred blood, he dyed his white beard red, calling out to the crowd,
„O people! On the day of His martyrdom on the field of Karbalá, Husayn
ibn `Alí spoke these words: “Is there anyone truly capable of dispensing
victory who will come to aid me?” But I say unto you, “O people, is there
anyone truly capable of seeing who will come to behold me?”‟” Bahá‟u‟lláh
repeated several times: “What weighty words did that man speak, and how
he bore witness to the truth of this Faith with his precious blood! People
witnessed it but were not moved, and barbarously put to death that innocent
soul.” He then added, “All these strange events support the greatness of this
blessed Cause. They will all be recorded in the pages of history and future
generations will feel proud of them.”

The late Hájí `Abú‟l-Hasan [Bazzaz] Shirází67 was present and asked
Bahá‟u‟lláh, “After the martyrdom of Husayn ibn `Alí, the sovereignty of

Known as Shaykhu‟l-`Iraqayn (d. 1869), he was a close ally of Mírzá Taqi Khán, the Amir-Kabir (d.

1852). He was sent by Nasiri‟d-Din Sháh to the `Atabat to regild the dome of the Shrine of Imam Husayn and to
cause trouble for Bahá‟u‟lláh.

One of the seven Bahá‟ís martyred in May 1891 in Yazd. Earlier, he had asked Bahá‟u‟lláh for this high
station and, in a Tablet, was told to seek his heart's desire in Yazd. Forty days later, he attained his wish. For details, see
Malmiri, Tarikh-i-Shuhaday-i-Yazd, pp. 32-56.

In 1844, he had traveled on the same vessel with the Báb and Quddus, when They were going on
pilgrimage to Mecca. He later recounted many details of that historic journey to Mírzá Habíb; see Rabbani, “The Báb in
Shiraz: An Account by Mirza Habibu‟llah Afnan”, Bahá‟í Studies Review, 2004, 91-127 (See also Afnán, Mírzá
Habíbu‟llah. “The Báb in Shiraz.” Translated by Ahang Rabbani. Translations of Shaykhi, Bábí and Bahá‟í Texts
(East Lansing, Mich.) no.11 (January 1998). ) . He attained full certitude during the Báb‟s appearance at the Masjid-i-
Vakil. He was the father of Mírzá Muhammad-Baqir Khán-i-Dihqan, a very influential Bahá‟í in the administrative
apparatus of Fars (see In the Land of Refuge).

Yazid lasted no more than three years. Why is it that, 50 years after the
martyrdom of the Exalted One, Nasiri‟d-Din Sháh still rules with full
powers, inflicting day and night much injury on the Faith; and God has
[seemingly] spared him?” Bahá‟u‟lláh replied, “God has given him this
clemency because of the error of some believers in the early days and their
assassination attempt on him. But he too will have his day. You will see.”

Departure from the Holy Land

Our stay in the Holy Land had been nine months long. Each day, we had
been showered with new favors without deserving them. The infinite grace
of God had surrounded us. The happiness of our good fortune was the wish
of all the Prophets and saints of the past. The spread of cholera and illness
had subsided and the day for us to leave was quickly approaching.

One afternoon, we were summoned to the presence of the Blessed
Perfection in the Mansion of Bahjí. His blessed Person was standing in the
middle of His chamber when we entered. Immersed in deep grief and
sorrow, we circumambulated His Person and prostrated ourselves at His
feet, as tears like spring-showers streamed uncontrollably from our eyes.
With our emotions and words, we expressed our heart-felt gratitude for the
glorious days we had in His presence. Then the Tongue of Purity spoke
these sacred words: “Do not be sad; do not lament. If you attained Our
presence once, your attainment was complete. Be assured that, under all
conditions, We are with you. Why are you downcast? Port Said is very near.
Whenever We call, you will hear Us. Do not be sorrowful; do not grieve. Be
confident. The divine favors have surrounded you and will continue to
envelop you.” Again, He repeated, “If you attained Our presence once, your
attainment was complete.” Then He added, “For no other pilgrims were the
blessings and circumstances as complete as they were for the Afnáns. Be
happy; be thrilled; be radiant. The grace of God has surrounded you and will
continue to embrace you everlastingly.”

He sat down and invited us to sit also. With His blessed Hand, He passed to
us the sacred Tablets that He had revealed for each one of us.68 We
reverently kissed His fingers and read the Tablets. They venerated and
glorified each one of us. After nine months of being in His presence, we
were now bidden farewell with these words: “God be with you.”

From there, we went to `Akká and attained the presence of `Abdu‟l-Bahá.
With tearful eyes and hearts set on fire, we anticipated our coming
separation. We prostrated at His feet and, clinging to the hem of His robe,
begged for His help with divine favors and confirmations. His blessed Being

The Tablet bestowed upon Mírzá Habíb on that occasion is in Bahá‟u‟lláh, INBMC, Majmu`ih

translation appears as the frontispiece of the publication.

lifted us from the ground and, kissing the brow of each of us, bid us
farewell.

While these ephemeral servants were in `Akká, the Blessed Beauty called
our mother and sister into His presence and showered them with much
admiration and untold praise. As they were leaving, my mother kissed His
blessed hand. The thought came to her that, if His ring were given to her as
a means of attracting divine blessings and as a source of healing, all her
wishes in this world would be realized. Shortly after, when they were in the
presence of the Greatest Holy Leaf, one of the maidservants came in to
present the ring as a gift, saying, “Bahá‟u‟lláh told me to present you with
this ring.” For this divine favor, my mother cried out in joy and gratitude.
She then bid farewell to the Khánum, the other Varaqát69, and the wife of
Bahá‟u‟lláh70. The ring of the Blessed Perfection is now held in the
Archives of the House of the Báb. It has been a source of pride and joy for
this family and our descendants.

Afterwards, my mother and sister attained the presence of `Abdu‟l-Bahá one
last time. Then, filled with deep sorrow, we all left the sacred city of `Akká
for Haifa.

Outside the city gate, our much-loved companions, who had been friends to
my father and our spiritual comrades for nine months, had gathered. With
deep affection we all embraced and kissed each other farewell. They helped
us board our carriage and we left for Haifa. In Haifa, the late Manshádí,
along with our father, secured our boarding pass from the Namsavi Shipping
Company. About an hour before dusk, accompanied by the honored Áqá
Siyyid Taqí, we were on our way by boat to the destined ship. Our ship left
[the Bay of Haifa] at about sunset. It is impossible for me to describe the
feelings we experienced at that time and how the fond memories of those
days overwhelmed us.

This was a brief summary of the memories of the days we beheld the
countenance of God, which have remained with me after 50 years. God
willing, I will now give my recollections of visiting `Abdu‟l-Bahá and what
I observed next.

One thing we came to realize after the ascension of the Blessed Beauty was
that, at the moment we left, He had twice said to us, “If you attained our
presence once, your attainment was complete.” The meaning of this blessed
utterance was now clear: we would never be worthy to see His blessed

countenance in this world again; outwardly He would be hidden behind
veils, and His passing was near.71

Education and Commerce in Egypt

The headquarters of my late father‟s commercial enterprise was in Cairo and
he also had a branch office in Port Said. The late Áqá Ahmad [Yazdí]72 and
my older brother, the late Áqá Siyyid Áqá, were responsible for its affairs
and supervised the branch office.73 A few days after arriving in Port Said,
we traveled to Cairo, where my late father had a room in Saray-i-Jawahiri.
In that city, once again, he was immersed in business activities. While we
assisted him in his daily work, we also continued our education, to develop
a strong command of the Arabic language.74

In those days, several of the eminent friends in Cairo were engaged in
commerce. This included men such as the late Hájí Mírzá Hasan-i-
Khúrásání, Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-i-Afshár75, Mírzá `Alí-Muhammad-i-
Shirází, Hájí `Abdu‟l-Karim-i-Kaziruni, Hájí Lutf-`Alíy-i-Namaziy-i-
Shirází, Hájí Muhammad-i-Yazdí76, the late Hájí Niyyaz77, and several
others that were either related to these individuals or worked in their place
of business. The Iranian Consul-General78 at that time was the late Mírzá
Ridá Khán, the Bananu‟l-Mulk79, the father of Áqá Mírzá Fadlu‟lláh Khán-
i-Banan80.

Before the ascension of the Blessed Beauty, Mírzá Hasan-i-Khúrásání and
Hájí Niyyaz were given permission to go on pilgrimage and had left for the
Holy Land.

Though the date of the Afnáns‟ departure is not noted, it is estimated to be in late March 1892. The
ascension of Bahá‟u‟lláh occurred on 29 May 1892.

The fourth and youngest son of Hájí `Abdu‟r-Rahim-i-Qannad-i-Yazdi, he had married Munavvar
Khánum, the youngest daughter of `Abdu‟l-Bahá. Years later, both husband and wife broke the Covenant.

When he arrived in Egypt, Núri‟d-Dín established an import-export company called Shirkat-i-
Ruhaniyyih.

In a Tablet, `Abdu‟l-Bahá instructed Mírzá Habíb: ”At nighttime, you must put effort into your
studies and learning languages. Likewise, make an effort to learn as much about sciences and literature as you can.
Since the divine confirmations render the Afnán victorious and triumphant, soon you will advance in all
areas”.Abdu‟l-Bahá. Majmu‟ih Makatib-i-Hadrat-i-`Abdu‟l-Bahá. Vol. 52, Iran National Bahá‟í Manuscript

middle of 1892, he was appointed to the consulate in Cairo. After a while, he was dismissed from office and

News of Bahá’u’lláh’s Ascension

The great calamity and the supreme tragedy of the ascension of the Blessed
Beauty – may my life be a sacrifice to the dust of His Sacred Threshold –
happened two months and a few days after we left the Holy Land. With
broken hearts and spirits and consumed by the fire of His separation, tears
of sorrow, anguish and lamentation poured from the eyes of every denizen
of the Crimson Ark and dweller beneath the tabernacle of His Cause. He
Himself is my witness, I can never describe the unbearable pain brought on
by knowing that I could not once again behold His blessed Countenance on
this plane of existence! God alone knows that this pen is utterly incapable of
recounting what happened during those dark days!81

The late [Mírzá Hasan] Khúrásání and Hájí Niyyaz were in `Akká at the
setting of the Sun of Truth in the Holy Land. Also present was the honored
Áqá Mírzá Taraz-i-Samandari, son of the illustrious Samandar, who had
been among a group of pilgrims from Iran. He had arrived in the Holy Land
a few months before the ascension and remained there for a while after that
event. As a token of Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s grace, the bonds of our friendship and
fraternity, first established during our days together in the presence of the
Blessed Perfection, has grown ever stronger with the passage of these 55
years.82

In the days after the ascension of the Blessed Perfection, hearts were melted,
spirits were downcast, and eyes cried bitter tears of anguish. It was a
particularly unbearable and sorrowful time for those who had been in His
presence and had beheld that mighty Sovereign of the world of being. Many
of the friends, men and women alike, gathered at night or during the day, in
various homes, raising the cry of “Yá Bahá‟u‟l-Abhá!” and supplicating for
the honor of martyrdom and self-sacrifice in the path of His glorious Cause.

The month of Dhi‟l-Qa`dih passed and, on 10 Dhi‟l-Hajjih [6 July 1892],
the `Id-i-Qurbán (the festival of Sacrifice) was observed. As was customary
in those days, all the Iranian merchants would go to the Iranian Consulate,
visiting the Consul-General and wishing him well. Typically, on such
occasions, they would be served lunch and would stay until late in the
afternoon. Because the Bahá‟í merchants and Muslim merchants associated
very little, each would occupy a different side of the reception hall in the
course of their visits.

Because of his age and prominence in the community, my late father was the
senior member and leader of the Bahá‟í merchants. Consequently, we went

A detailed and poignant description of Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s ascension is given in Mazandarani, Tarikh
Zuhuru‟l-Haqq, vol 5, pp. 433-72.

See Samandarí, Taráz Alláh. Moments with Bahá‟u‟lláh, Memoirs of the Hand of the Cause of God
Tarázu‟lláh Samandarí, translated by Mehdi Samandari and Marzieh Gail. Los Angeles: Kalimát Press, 1996.

to the Consulate led by him. [Because we were mourning Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s
ascension], our intention was to leave after visiting for a few minutes, and
not participate in the celebration.

When we arrived at the Consulate, as was customary, we sat on one side. At
that moment, however, the Bananu‟l-Mulk [Consul-General], without
realizing that a number of Bahá‟ís had arrived, said, “According to a report
in a recent issue of the Hikmat Newspaper, the Prophet of the Bábís has
passed away.” He made this comment with such a mocking tone that it
greatly offended the friends [the believers]. With a quick signal from my
father, the Bahá‟í group left the gathering without the least
acknowledgement to the host or bidding anyone farewell.

Noting our departure, the Bananu‟l-Mulk was greatly surprised by the turn
of events. Later, we heard from other Iranian merchants present [in the
gathering] that they had all reproached him, saying, “This place is not Iran
and you cannot say things that are not civil or good mannered. Those people
who left the gathering are not ordinary and commonplace people. They rank
among the most respected merchants and should be seen as a source of pride
by the Iranian government. If an amiable reconciliation is not brought about
immediately, this incident will become a cause of great inconvenience,
directly affecting you.” This warning from the Muslim merchants, coupled
with the powerful effect of our departure, left the Consul-General terrified
of its possible consequences.

From the consulate building, we all went to my father‟s commercial office.
We gathered in a room adjacent to his office where all the Bahá‟í meetings
took place. This room was decorated with a very large and unique
calligraphy by Mishkin-Qalam, depicting two ornamented birds that made
up the words of the Greatest Name. There was also a large circular table in
the middle of the room. Most of us gathered around this table to discuss the
event that had just taken place in the Consulate.

Some of the friends thought that our departure had insulted the Iranian
Consul and that he had unwittingly acted in an impertinent way. I remember
vividly that my late father was very upset and cried out in a raised voice,
“He has erred greatly on something that he should have known better! I
know him very well from our days in Shiraz and we have been friends ever
since. However, we acted in the name of the Blessed Beauty and out of
respect for the Greatest Name. I am prepared to have my blood spilled in
this path! Mark my words: the Bananu‟l-Mulk is now greatly repentant and
ashamed [because of our departure].”

While this discussion was taking place, Hájí Sayyah83, who lived in Egypt at
the time and was a confidant to both the Bahá‟ís and the Muslims, entered
the room. He related that the Bananu‟l-Mulk had asked him to convey, with
great reverence, his apologies for what he had said and further begged the
Bahá‟ís to return to the festivities so that the Consulate‟s traditional
celebration could continue amiably. Hájí Sayyah added, “The Consul must
send a report of the event to the Iranian Embassy in Istanbul. If you do not
participate, it is possible that certain ill-wishers will connive and cause
trouble for the Consul.” My father replied, “Inform the Bananu‟l-Mulk on
our behalf that, as he has noted, we are currently mourning the departure of
our Beloved and cannot participate in the festivities. Our visit this morning
was only for the purpose of meeting him. However, we expect that, from
now on, he will show proper respect to everyone with his remarks. This
country is not Iran, where one can say and do as one pleases.”

This warning and the gathering of the friends had greatly frightened the
Bananu‟l-Mulk. Hájí Sayyah had also added his own flavor to the message
by reporting [to the Consul], “They have all gathered in Áqá Mírzá Áqá‟s
office and are deliberating on plans to unseat and impeach the Consul.”
Consequently, before we had ended our discussions, Hájí Sayyah returned
and, once again, on behalf of the Bananu‟l-Mulk, fervently implored
everyone to return to the Consulate and participate in the festivities. My
father reiterated, “The Bahá‟ís will not take part in your celebration,” and
repeated what he had said earlier.
Ultimately, the result of this incident was that the Bananu‟l-Mulk became a
loyal friend of the Bahá‟ís and would not make the slightest decision
without consulting my late father or Hájí Mírzá Hasan-i-Khúrásání. The
friends enjoyed full freedom to do as they saw fit and became the envy of all
the Muslim merchants.

Núri’d-Dín Departs for Iran in 1894

Two years passed. As before, we were carrying out our commercial
activities from Cairo, Port Said and Alexandria, when my late father was
called by `Abdu‟l-Bahá to return to Iran. As a prelude to this, a Tablet was
revealed in his honor and he was instructed to go to the Holy Land. Before
leaving for Iran, he set up a company with Áqá Ahmad [Yazdí], Hájí
Muhammad-i-Yazdí and Hájí Siyyid `Alíy-i-Yazdí.84 Consequently, I was
working in his office in Cairo under the supervision of Áqá Siyyid `Alí and

In a second copy of this manuscript, the following parenthetical comments are recorded: “This was the
same Hájí Sayyah who had attained the presence of Bahá‟u‟lláh and had been the bearer of letters from the Zillu‟s-
Sultan and the Mushiru‟l-Mulk-i-Shirazi.” And, in the margin, it is written “Hájí Muhammad-`Alíy-i-Sayyah-i-
Mahallati.” Although I have been unable to confirm the identity of this carrier, it is clear from Khátirát Hájj Sayyáh that
Hájí Sayyah Mahallati was imprisoned in Iran throughout the period under discussion and the intended person is
someone else. Sayyáh, Muhammad-`Alí. Khátirát Hájj Sayyáh. Edited by Hamíd Sayyáh. 3rd ed. Tehran: Amír
Kabír, 1359 [1980].

The Yazdi brothers had previously formed a company known as Société Ruháníyyih. However, because
of some misfortunes, they now needed fresh capital and new partners; for details, see Yazdi, Blessing Beyond Measure,
pp. 12-14. At this time, Núri‟d-Dín was very affluent and was able to bankroll his fortune into this new joint venture.

my late brother, Hájí Mírzá Buzurg, and in Alexandria under the supervision
of Hájí Muhammad. Even though some of the friends were not optimistic
about the prospects of this business merger, my late father did not heed their
warnings and left for his pilgrimage. On this journey, my late brother, Hájí
Mírzá Buzurg, and I did not have the honor of attaining the presence of
`Abdu‟l-Bahá. My father went with my mother, older brother Áqá Siyyid
Áqá, younger brother Áqá Siyyid Diyá‟, and sister Tuba Khánum.85

After attaining the presence of `Abdu‟l-Bahá, and gaining further spiritual
sustenance and insight from Him, they left for Búshihr by sea. En route, my
father visited the renowned cleric [in Baghdad], Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-
Hasan-i-Shírází, the Hujjatu‟l-Islam (known as the Mírzáy-i-Shírází), at the
cleric‟s request. He was a close relative of the Báb. I have recorded the
details of this visit elsewhere.86

Regarding his visit with the above-mentioned person, my father received a
Tablet from `Abdu‟l-Bahá during his stay in Baghdad. In that blessed Tablet,
He wrote:

> To the attention of the illustrious Afnán, Áqá Mírzá Áqá, upon him
> rest the Glory of God, the Most Glorious.

He is the All-Glorious.

> O thou twig, who hath excelled in propagating the Word of God!
> From what hath been heard, thou didst travel from Baghdad to
> Sámarrá for the purpose of conversing in utmost wisdom with the
> desired person87. Even though that person is physically weak and no
> doubt hath little strength and joy for discourse and communion,
> however, the divine fragrance bringeth immeasurable vigor, and the

> everything delightful and verdant.

> I hope that, in that region, thou wilt succeed in disseminating the

In a Tablet (INBMC 52:329-30, no. 368) addressed to Núri‟d-Dín‟s son, Mírzá Jalal, who had stayed
in Shiraz to serve at, and protect, the House of the Báb, `Abdu‟l-Bahá speaks of the imminent arrival of Núri‟d-
Dín. The Master recounts the bounties showered upon Núri‟d-Dín during the days of Bahá‟u‟lláh, and how he had
stayed in Egypt at His behest. He further states that Núri‟d-Dín was now travelling to Iran in order to propagate
the divine teachings and raise the banner of God‟s Cause.

See In the Land of Refuge, Chapter 11.

A reference to Mírzáy-i-Shirazi.

His Glory rest upon thee and all who stand firm in the Covenant.

`Abdu‟l-Bahá `Abbás.88

My late father related, “The Hujjatu‟l-Islam had declared his belief in the
validity of the Báb‟s claim, the truth of the Blessed Beauty‟s Manifestation
and the greatness of `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s station. I asked him, „When did you
learn about the Faith?‟ He responded, „During the days when I was busy
with my studies as a student in Isfahán. Your maternal uncle, Mírzá Siyyid
Hasan (the Afnán-i-Kabír), was a student there as well. His Holiness [the
Báb] had come to Isfahán and, one day, at the home of [the Sultanu‟l-
`Ulama,] the Imam-Jum`ih, one of the divines asked Him a scientific
question. He gave a sufficient answer, but the akhund [cleric] spoke most
unfairly and inappropriately. The injustice of the divine and the
impeccability of the Exalted One awakened me to the truth of His blessed
Cause.” The details of this meeting have been written in a separate
volume89.

Arrival of Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl

In 1311 A.H. [1894], in accordance with `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s instructions, Mírzá
Abú‟l-Fadl90 came to Cairo. The Master instructed the prominent Bahá‟ís
not to associate openly with him so that he would not attract undue attention
and notice.91 After he arrived, he moved to an apartment with two furnished
rooms, situated above my father‟s business in Saray-i-Jawahiri. He began
teaching philosophy and logic at Al-Azhar University and meeting and
associating with the learned and accomplished men of his time. He
organized and taught classes in various branches of knowledge and
philosophy. Among his students were Shaykh Faraju‟llah Ziky-i-Kurdi92,
[and his brothers,] Shaykh Muhay‟d-Din and Shaykh Badru‟d-Din.

When he had been in Cairo for a while and had become acquainted with
certain of its inhabitants, Mírzá Abú‟l-Fadl would occasionally allow a few
of the friends to attend his classes. I remember vividly one day, when I was
present in his class, the important philosophical question of life and the
nature of the soul was being discussed and explained. He quoted
extensively, and cited many references, from well-known scholars and
learned men and, employing solid reasoning and indisputable evidence,
totally rejected the position of the naturalists and the theologians. On that

INBMC 52:315 no. 353, Khándan-i-Afnán 16-7 and Ma‟idih-i-Asimani 5:261-2. Although Mírzá
Habíb quotes only a portion of this Tablet, the full text is given here for ease of reference.

A reference to Tarikh Amri Fars va Shiraz (forthcoming In the Land of Refuge).

The text, and most other Persian sources, refer to him as Abu‟l-Fadá'il, but this translation uses the more
commonly recognized transliteration.

Mírzá Habíb means that Abdu‟l-Bahá did not want the public to know that Mírzá Abu‟l-Fadl was a
Bahá‟í, so that he could freely pursue his contacts among the intellectual circles of Cairo.

He published the first series of Bahá‟í books in Egypt, including the first compilation of `Abdu‟l-Bahá's
Tablets. „Abdu‟l-Bahá. Makatib-i-`Abdu‟l-Bahá. 3 vols. Cairo: Matba‟a Kurdistan al-„Ilmiyya, A.H.1330 [1910-
1921].

day, all his students testified that Jináb-i-Mírzá‟s [Abú‟l-Fadl‟s] deductions
were perfectly correct.

Mírzá Abú‟l-Fadl then continued, “During my stay at Bukhara and
Samarqand, I saw a commentary by Bahá‟u‟lláh that adequately clarified
this problem and resolved all questions.” His students asked, “Who is
Bahá‟u‟lláh?” “The Leader of our honored guests,” he replied [pointing to
us]. With real excitement, all students said, “Well, we will secure a copy
from them.” But Mírzá Abú‟l-Fadl responded, “Our guests are among the
ordinary people and laity. Such texts and commentaries are in the possession
of their learned and scholars. I must contact them for copies to be sent
here.” And so, he concluded this subject and began discussing another topic.
With every subject, Mírzá Abú‟l-Fadl would do the same as described
above, helping his students to grow receptive to hear [the Divine Call] and
sowing the seeds of the Word of God in their hearts.

A month later, he told them that the commentary he had mentioned had
arrived. His students eagerly competed with one another to see and read the
Text, which they took home and spent countless hours discussing with one
another. After all the discussion, he would often remind them, “Without a
trace of religious prejudice, study the scientific and rational arguments of
these Texts, and correlate them with your own deductive and intellectual
understanding. Consider the ease and facility with which they resolve all
complex issues. As for me, the more I study and ponder them in the light of
logic and reason, the more convinced I am that the contents of these
Commentaries are alone sufficient for all seekers of truth and only these
Writings contain undeniable proof.”

In this manner, he taught the Word of God. As a result, a number [of his
students] enrolled under the banner of the Cause. Those who did not
convert, such as Shaykh Muhammad-i-`Abduh, who was among the
professors of Al-Azhar University, became sympathizers. Such was the way
that Mírzá Abú‟l-Fadl taught and served the Faith in Egypt.

The Greatest Holy Leaf in Egypt

I have mentioned earlier that, during the time of the most great calamity of
Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s ascension, the late Hájí Mírzá Hasan-i-Khúrásání and Hájí
Niyyaz-i-Kirmaní were in the Holy Land and later returned [to Egypt].
Afterwards, the believers were not given permission to go on pilgrimage or
were very rarely given the privilege. This was because of the faithless
behavior of the Covenant-breakers and the manifold tests besetting the
friends in the Holy Land, or for reasons that remain concealed in the divine
knowledge. Consequently, we remained deprived of meeting the denizens of

the Crimson Ark and those circumambulating “Him round Whom the names
of God revolve”.93

During this year [circa 1894], our late father returned to Shiraz and this
servant and my late brother were busy with our commercial activities in Port
Said and Alexandria. We would mostly spend the rest of our time in the
honored presence of Mírzá Abú‟l-Fadl. To a certain extent, and according to
our abilities, we were able to benefit from his fellowship.

It was this very year, as well, that the Remnant of God, the Greatest Holy
Leaf, honored Egypt with her footsteps. She stayed at the residence of the
late Khúrásání. As a result of her visit, a rejuvenating breath of life was
breathed into the spirit of the friends, and a marvelous bliss and enthusiasm
developed among the community.94 Each one of us sent to her glorious
presence letters expressing our humility and absolute nothingness, and
asking for her intercession and confirmations. For the most part, they were
answered verbally.

The Effect in Egypt of the Sháh’s Assassination

Not long after the Greatest Holy Leaf returned to the Holy Land, Nasiri‟d-
Din Sháh was assassinated.95

One morning, Mírzá Abú‟l-Fadl came to our office greatly perturbed and
agitated. Until that day, he had concealed his belief [in Bahá‟u‟lláh]. He
said, “Last night, I had a frightening nightmare. Since then, I have not had a
moment‟s rest and fear that great trouble lies in store for the friends in Iran
or the Holy Land.” He proceeded to describe his dream: “I dreamt that I
stood in a vast field and a ferocious lion was chasing me to the point where I
was thoroughly exhausted and could no longer escape his vicious grasp. I
sensed that, at any moment, I was about to be devoured by this wild beast. I
despaired and could find no way to save myself. Amidst this, a small door
appeared before me, and I entered it trembling with fear. Then I woke up
filled with terror and did not sleep a wink for the rest of the night.”

He had not quite finished his description when we heard the cry of the
newspaper boy from the streets, “The Iranian King is slain; the Iranian King

That is, the believers in `Akká and companions of `Abdu‟l-Bahá.

The following was revealed by `Abdu‟l-Bahá on the occasion of Bahiyyih Khánum‟s departure for
Egypt (Bahíyyih Khánum: The Greatest Holy Leaf: A Compilation. Haifa: Bahá‟í World Centre, 1982., pp. 14-15).
For a considerable period - that is, from the day of Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s ascension - my sister had grown so thin and
feeble, and was in such a weakened condition from the anguish of her mourning, that she was close to breakdown.
Even though it was her dearest wish to drain her cup and wing her way to the realms where the Divine Essence
shineth in glory, still this servant could not bear to see her in that state. Then it occurred to me that, God be
thanked, I have such an unfailing comforter as Jinab-i-Hájí [Hasan-i-Khúrásání], and it would be well to make him
my partner in distress. I therefore determined to send her to Egypt, to provide her with a change of air. Although
this will certainly cause thee trouble and inconvenience, still, I trust that, out of God‟s bounty, it will also bring
thee joy and good cheer.

See Balyuzi, Bahá‟u‟lláh: The King of Glory, pp. 430-55.

is slain!” Mírzá Abú‟l-Fadl immediately said, “Now I understand the
meaning of my dream!” We bought a copy of the Hikmat Newspaper, which
had devoted its lead column to this subject. It said in part, “Yesterday, while
the Royal Court was preparing for the festivities of the anniversary of the
50th year of the Sháh‟s ascent to the throne and the monarch was on a visit
to the Shrine of Hadrat-i-`Abdu‟l-`Azim, an Iranian Bábí by the name of
Mírzá Ridá Kirmaní shot and killed him.” Since this news was being
disseminated by Siyyid Jamalu‟d-Din [Afghani]‟s sympathizers, with gross
exaggeration and embellishments, it was obvious that they were trying to
attribute the Sháh‟s murder to the friends in Iran and the Bahá‟í community
there. These accounts were aimed solely at provoking public reaction
against the Faith and its adherents.

Soon the news spread throughout the city and all the friends gathered in our
office, fervently supplicating divine protection for the Bahá‟í community of
Iran, so it would stay safe from the claws of the barbarous wolves. They
further prayed for celestial intervention, so that this event would not become
a situation where the innocent friends‟ blood would be spilled and a number
of them martyred. In truth, all the believers were profoundly disturbed and
anticipated imminent tragedies.

At any rate, resigned to the will of God and submitting to His good-
pleasure, we waited for news from Iran. The other newspapers and
magazines were reporting the assassination of the Sháh in the same way, and
discussed its implications in a provocative fashion. They inflamed the fire of
enmity and hatred among the Iranians living in Egypt, preparing the ground
for massive disturbances and convulsions [for the Bahá‟ís] in Cairo.

During that period, the Consul-General of Iran was Mírzá Ishaq Khán96, [the
Mafkhamu‟d-Dawlih,] who was from Kurdistan and a Sunni. Incited by
Mírzá Mihdí, the Za`im‟d-Dawlih97, who was the secretary of the Consulate
and one of the followers of Siyyid Jamalu‟d-Din [Afghani], the Iranian
merchants appealed to the Consulate. They reportedly said, “Now that the
Bábís have killed the Sháh, all the Bábís in Iran are [or will be] massacred
in reprisal. Therefore, we must also kill all those that live in this region and
completely uproot their community.” They further noted, “We have arranged
for each of us to kill the Bábís from his native town. For instance, the
Shírází Muslims are to kill the Bahá‟ís from Shiraz, and Khúrásánís will do
likewise with Bahá‟ís from that region, and so forth.”

From 1894, he was the Consul-General in Egypt for five years. Afterwards, he was the Iranian
Ambassador to Washington for six years; see Bamdad, Sharh-i Hal-i Rijal-i Iran, vol 1, pp. 108-11.

A native of Tabriz, he was the publisher of the Hikmat (wisdom) Newspaper in Cairo and the author
of an Arabic polemic against the Faith, titled Miftáhu Bábí‟l-Abwab (the Key of the Gate of Gates). Initially, he
had written this attack to extract money from `Abdu‟l-Bahá, but failed in his purpose. See Browne, Edward G. The
Press and Poetry of Modern Persia: Partly Based on the Manuscript Work of Mírzá Muhammad-`Ali Khán
“Tarbiyat” of Tabríz. Reprint. Los Angeles: Kalimát Press, 1983., p. 18.

From the outset, the late Mírzá Isháq Khán admonished them by saying,
“This is not Iran where one can commit such heinous acts with impunity and
spill the blood of people for no reason. Whoever has murdered the Sháh is
now in prison and will be killed. In accordance with Islamic jurisprudence,
one cannot kill another in place of a murderer.”

The more he reasoned in this way, the less effect it had on them, and they
rejected his arguments by advancing further threats. Eventually, Mírzá Isháq
Khán replied, “The people that live in Cairo and are known by this name
[Bahá‟í] are not ordinary and commonplace folk. They are all among the
best known and most respected merchants and are engaged in business
activities in all corners of the world. How are you going to deal with
companies and merchants that they trade with and how will you compensate
their customers?” They said, “We stand ready to provide a guarantee that we
will settle all their accounts and are willing to sign a surety to this effect.”
Mírzá Isháq Khán finally managed to still their fury by saying, “I will
telegraph [the Amínu‟s-Sultan,] the Atabak98 [and find out the identity of the
Sháh‟s assassin]. Should he be a Bábí, you are free to do as you please and
neither you nor I will be held responsible before the government. However,
if he is not a Bábí, there is no reason to inflict injuries upon innocent people.
Give me three days. If I haven‟t received a reply by then, do as you please.”

On the third day, a memorial service was organized in the Consulate for the
fallen monarch, and no response [to the telegram] had been received from
Tihran. I remember well when the Bahá‟í group, led by the honored
Khurasani, arrived at the gathering. The Za`imu‟d-Dawlih snapped, “The
rascals have killed the Sháh and now occupy the seat of honor too!” This
comment greatly offended the illustrious Mírzá Abú‟l-Fadl and he rose to
defend the friends. The Za`imu‟d-Dawlih asked, “Jináb-i-Mírzá, it seems
that you are a Bábí as well?” To which Mírzá Abu‟l-Fadl responded, “I am a
Bahá‟í and what harm is there in that?” That gathering was the occasion
when, without the least hesitation, Mírzá Abu‟l-Fadl openly and publicly
declared himself to be a Bahá‟í and, with his characteristic courage,
heroically defended the Bahá‟ís.

However, the Consul-General, fearing that the [Iranian] Muslims would
commit an unseemly act, was extremely perturbed and worried. He was
thoroughly unmindful of the representatives of various governments and
officials of different embassies [who were there to pay homage]. With an
agitated face that betrayed his inner turmoil, he sat in his designated
position. Most people, however, thought that the loss and death of the
monarch had brought about deep grief. The worry did not last very long
however. At the final hour of the gathering, a telegraph arrived from the
Royal Court in Tihran to the effect that the murder of the Sháh was
committed by a certain Mírzá Rida of Kirman, who was a follower of Siyyid

During the reign of Nasiri‟d-Din Sháh, the Prime Minister carried the title of the Atabak.

Jamalu‟d-Din-i-Afghani and who was wholly unconnected with the Bábís or
Bahá‟ís. [The telegram further emphasized that] Iranian subjects, wherever
they lived, must remain unmolested and protected.

After reading this telegram, the Consul-General was elated. He instructed
the Za`imu‟d-Dawlih to read its entire text out loud to the gathering. He
read it once. The Consul ordered him to read it so emphatically that even
pedestrians outside would hear him. So, he read it a second time. And
likewise, a third time!

The Consul-General then got up from his seat and greeted the distinguished
guests. He said to the Iranians, “Now you understand that Bahá‟ís are not
killers. Rather, they are supportive of the government and the Sháh. It is
important that you now recognize the identity of the true enemy of the
monarchy and our nation.” In such a way, this potential disturbance was
diffused.

Second Pilgrimage: In the Presence of `Abdu’l-Bahá

Departure from Egypt

In the year 1314 A.H.99, I sought permission to attain the sacred presence of
the Center of the Covenant and visit the Holy Threshold of the Shrine of
Bahá‟u‟lláh. This request was graced with acceptance and I was invited to
the Holy Land. Together with my brother, Hájí Mírzá Buzurg, we left Port
Said.

In Cairo, there had been occasional talk of the faithlessness of Mírzá
Muhammad-`Alí and his collusion with the Holy Family and the widow100
of Bahá‟u‟lláh against [the provisions of] the Kitab-i-`Ahdi and `Abdu‟l-
Bahá. However, since `Abdu‟l-Bahá had not yet disclosed this secret, none
of the believers was sure it was true or knew any of the details. Those that
had gone on pilgrimage were told by the Master, “When you return, leave
whatever you have heard or seen by the sea.” As such, the friends heard
some things about what was going on, but did not dare repeat them. In
particular, this subject was discussed by the elders of the [Bahá‟í]
community in Cairo. They would say things like, “If `Abdu‟l-Bahá is in debt
and has not been able to pay the expenses incurred during the days of the
Blessed Perfection or associated with the funeral of the Ancient Beauty, why
are the Aghsan living so luxuriously and lavishly?” Others would say, “Why
do the Aghsan have excessive expenses, such as maintaining carriages,
horses, and multiple servants, and incur the exorbitant cost of entertaining
government officials, nobles, and influential citizens, especially at this time
of widespread terrible financial recession when the Bahá‟ís have very little

means? Beyond the expenses [in the Holy Land], the critical obligations of
the Cause in Iran must also be met! The actions of the Aghsan directly
conflict with the interests of the Faith!” In short, there was talk like this
about the news and events in the Holy Land.

Shortly before we left Cairo, I attained the presence of the honored Mírzá
Abu‟l-Fadl. After graciously welcoming me, he said, “Surely, you are
familiar with some of the concerns expressed by the pilgrims returning from
the Holy Land. When you have attained the presence of the beloved Master,
reverently relate [this] on my behalf: „The fragrances of love and fellowship
do not show in the comments of some pilgrims returning through Cairo.
Some say that `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s sanctified heart is not happy with the actions
and activities of certain individuals. The illustrious Aghsan do not attain the
august presence of the Master and, in turn, His blessed Person does not visit
the Mansion. Others say that the sacred Figure of `Abdu‟l-Bahá has not
been able to repay loans incurred during the period of Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s illness,
nor have the expenses associated with His ascension been paid. However,
we are told that the honored Aghsan spend excessively and live in great
luxury. And yet, `Abdu‟l-Bahá is obliged to pay for all of this. Inevitably,
when the pilgrims say such things here, they will repeat them elsewhere as
well. Consequently, the Master‟s sufferings will surely multiply. If the
blessed Person of `Abdu‟l-Bahá considers it wise to announce these issues
openly, perhaps the apprehension the friends experience when they hear
such hearsay would be alleviated.” Mírzá Abu‟l-Fadl particularly
emphasized, “Open your ears well and find out all that you can [about what
is going on in the Holy Land]. Pass on these things when no one besides
yourself is in the presence of the beloved Master.”

In `Akká

Once again, after the passage of five years, I was returning to the Holy
Land.101 Memories of our last pilgrimage during the Days of God, and
beholding the Countenance of the Blessed Beauty, and our nine-month stay
under His blessed shadow were coming back and setting my heart and soul
on fire. The beloved Master had recently returned to `Akká from the cave of
Elijah.102

When we arrived, we attained His blessed presence. He showered us with
His measureless favors and infinite bounties and asked after the friends in
Cairo. He then warned, “This region is beset with turmoil. The gale of tests
from the Blessed Beauty blows in every direction. Calamity‟s tempest has
agitated the sea of the world of being. You must exert yourself and be

Though the exact date of Mírzá Habíb‟s second pilgrimage is not known, from the text‟s internal
evidence, it is estimated to be in the spring of 1897.

Finding the situation in `Akka intolerable, `Abdu‟l-Bahá had moved to Haifa‟s Retreat of Elijah on
Mount Carmel for two months.

vigilant lest, God forbid, the dust of rancor, enmity and infidelity to the
divine Covenant should sully your pure hearts.”

The beloved Master‟s comment left me very sad and pensive, as I thought
about the subject that had been discussed in Cairo. I was certain that
something ominous was stirring. Some of the resident believers, whom I had
known during the time of the Blessed Beauty and who had served with great
humility and sincerity, were no longer radiating the same spirituality and
reverence. It occurred to me to discuss my perplexities and questions with
two of my close friends in that land. Perhaps they could help alleviate the
storm that had unexpectedly engulfed my heart and had caused the sacred
city of `Akká to become like a cage to me.

What the Master said to us had profoundly saddened my heart, withered my
spirit and paralyzed my whole being. I asked myself: what has happened
that the One designated by both the Kitab-i-Aqdas and the Kitab-i-`Ahdi,
and Who is the focus of adoration for the people of Bahá, must now warn
the pilgrims in this way? I remembered vividly that every day during our
pilgrimage at the time of the Ancient Beauty, we attained the presence of
`Abdu‟l-Bahá [and, as such, I knew His personality well]. Now I wondered:
what had robbed Him of His strength and vitality? What had diminished His
radiance and those heavenly smiles? His hair and beard had turned white;
His luminous cheeks were now full of lines; and His blessed eyes, which at
the time of the Ancient Beauty were full of life and brilliance, now looked
bitterly tired. He seemed very sad and grief-stricken. At times, I thought
perhaps it was the Blessed Perfection‟s ascension that had so profoundly
affected the Master and aged Him so much. But then I would reason: the
supreme Spirit of the Ancient Beauty prevails over all things and envelops
the world of being. Therefore, it could not cause such sorrow in `Abdu‟l-
Bahá. He knows best that Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s ascension was His own will – a fact
not only alluded to, but clearly enunciated in His sacred Writings – and this
truth is one of the divine attributes.

Overwhelmed by anxiety and unable to resolve any of these perplexities, I
would pace the streets like a crazed man and talk to myself. Eventually, I
went to see one of my old friends, the late Áqá Rida Shirazi103, whom I truly
loved like a father. I began to discuss these things with him, but being a wise
and experienced man, he responded in such a way that I did not understand
his meaning and was not enlightened any further.104

He embraced the Faith in Baghdad, where he owned a confectionery shop with Mírzá Mahmud-i-
Kashani. He accompanied Bahá‟u‟lláh in all stages of His exile and served the Master until his death in 1912. In
the early 1880s, he penned a stirring account of Bahá‟u‟lláh, which remains unpublished. See „Abdu‟l-Bahá.
Memorials of the Faithful, translated by Marzieh Gail. Wilmette: Bahá‟í Publishing Trust, 1971,pp. 39-41.

In accordance with the Master‟s instructions to all resident believers and in order to protect the
young Afnán, the wise and veteran believer had refused to share any details about the events of `Akka and the
rebellion of the Aghsan against `Abdu‟l-Bahá.

Several times in the streets, I saw Mírzá Áqá Jan105, whom I knew
Bahá‟u‟lláh had expelled106. He expected me to show him respect, bow
down in deference to his station and greet him warmly, the same way that I
esteemed him during the time of Bahá‟u‟lláh. But I did not take any notice
of him, even though I knew he resented my discourtesy. One day, he asked
me about my father. I pretended I had not heard him. He said, “Jináb-i-
Afnán, what sin have I committed that you hold me in such contempt? Such
acrimonious behavior is not in keeping with the quality of the Afnáns‟ holy
lineage.” I responded, “I dislike you and do not want to talk with you. From
now on, please do not converse with me and agitate my fatigued soul.”

All strength and confidence seemed to have been drained from me. I was
very frightened and consumed with the thought that the talk circulating in
Cairo would become a divine test for this unworthy soul as well.

Eventually, I went to see another of my old friends, Mírzá Jalál107, the son of
the Sultánu‟sh-Shuhadá [the King of Martyrs]. We were very close during
the period that had he lived in Cairo. One time, he came down with
dysentery and was near death. The Master had instructed that he be sent to
the Holy Land. However, none of the believers dared to take him to Port
Said so that, through Siyyid Yahya [Nahri], the brother of `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s
wife, he could be sent to the Holy Land. Even though I was discouraged
from doing so by the honored Khurasani, I volunteered to take him, arguing
that he might pass away in Cairo and `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s wish would remain
unfulfilled.108 Because of this incident, he developed a particular fondness
and affinity for me. As such, I went to visit him and asked him the truth of
the matter.

At first, he was reluctant to answer and said to me directly, “Such
speculations will harm you and it is best to disregard them. Focus your

The original word is „tard,‟ which, in this context, means excommunication. During Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s
last years, He banished Mírzá Áqá Jan from His presence because of certain acts and attitudes. However, through the
intercession of `Abdu‟l-Bahá, he was forgiven and resumed his services. He was finally expelled two months before
Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s ascension.

He had married Rúhá Khánum, `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s third daughter. This marriage produced two sons, Muníb
and Hasan, and three daughters, Maryam, Duha and Zahrá. The family name was Shahíd [martyr]. Mírzá Jalál and his
family eventually lost their faith.

Mírzá Jalal arrived in `Akka severely ill and at death‟s door. Abú‟l-Qásim Afnán relates that he
heard the following story from his father, Mírzá Habíb, on numerous occasions. His father deeply believed in
`Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s ability to work miracles. “Sometime after Mírzá Jalal had been sent to `Akka desperately ill, I saw
him well and in perfect health. He told me, “I have no memory of how I came from Cairo to Port Said and from
there to `Akka. I remember, however, that when I arrived in `Akka, I was laid up unconscious in bed and `Abdu‟l-
Bahá would come to visit me each day. One day, all of a sudden, I noticed that I had become very light, soaring in
the air and completely conscious. In that condition, I saw my body lying in bed while my mother and sister were
pulling a white sheet over me and sobbing profusely. After they left the room still weeping, they met the Master,
who asked them, „What happened?‟ They answered, „Mírzá Jalal has died.‟ `Abdu‟l-Bahá came into the room,
removed the sheet from my face, and began to chant certain verses. Instantly, I returned to my body, opened my
eyes and saw His luminous Countenance. The Master asked, „Mírzá Jalal, what do you desire?‟ With a hushed
voice, I replied, „Yogurt.‟ `Abdu‟l-Bahá went outside and told my family, „Mírzá Jalal is well. He wants some
yogurt. Give him some.‟ After I was fed a few spoonfuls, I began a full recovery and, in no time, was thoroughly
well and strong.”

thoughts instead on the Threshold of the Ancient Beauty. Such affairs are
not worthy of mention or your consideration.” I insisted on my request.
There was no one in the room except the ever-present God and the two of
us. He made me take an oath on the hair of the Master that I would not
divulge to another soul what he was about to share, not even to my brother.
Then he proceeded to recount all that had happened since the night of the
ascension, when `Abdu‟l-Bahá had noticed that the Aghsan were busy
searching the papers and Tablets [of Bahá‟u‟lláh]. From beginning to end,
he described to me everything he had seen or heard. At the end, he
emphasized, “It is `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s wish that the believers not know these
things and you should pretend to be ignorant of them as well.”

The world turned dark before my eyes. Uncontrollably, I went by the
seashore and, facing the Shrine of Bahá‟u‟lláh, began to weep and
supplicate: “Yá Bahá‟u‟l-Abhá! Is it possible that Your religion, planted so
firmly through the Covenant that You have established with each of Your
servants, is now divided and fragmented? Is it possible that different sects
will now appear in it? And if so, what was the good in the Sacred Blood of
the Báb [being spilt] or the sufferings endured by the resplendent Person of
„Him Whom God shall make manifest‟109? How is it that the blood of the
martyrs of the Cause has come to naught so quickly?” I would say such
things and shed bitter tears. After several days of anguish, my sobbing and
tears calmed my heart and stilled the storm that raged in my soul. I was
afraid to speak with anyone or associate with any of the old friends.

As the grace of God always surrounds us, several pilgrims arrived from Iran
at that time who were without equal in their humor and always made
everyone happy. These were: Mírzá `Abdu‟llah Khán110, the father-in-law of
the martyred Varqa; the late Mírzá `Azizu‟llah Khán, a son of the martyred
Varqa; the honored Dr. [Yunis Khán] Afrukhtih111; and Áqá Mírzá
Fadlu‟llah Kandí112, known as the Mufsidu‟l-Mamalik. Mufsid [corrupt]
was a title that Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí used for the thabityn113. When Áqá
Mírzá Fadlu‟llah arrived in the Holy Land, it was said, “Another mufsid is
added to the mufsidyn!” `Abdu‟l-Bahá humorously would refer to him as
the Mufsidu‟l-Mamalik114 and, thereafter, he was known by this name
among the friends. Often in the Pilgrim House, Mishkin-Qalim, Zaynu‟l-
Muqarrabin and Áqá Rida [Qannad] Shirazi would entertain the friends with
witty stories and, as such, lessened the pain of our hearts.

That is, Bahá‟u‟lláh.

The father of Mírzá Ashraf Khán and Fu‟ad Ashraf.

The thabityn [the steadfast] were those who had remained faithful to `Abdu‟l-Bahá. They, in turn,
referred to the followers to Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí as naqidyn (the Covenant-breakers).

Literally, Corrupt in all realms.

The day after Mírzá Jalal told me the details and, to some degree, clarified
the situation for me, I was thinking that the friends were not aware of these
events. They did not know that the Aghsan had broken the Covenant of the
Cause of God and were raising a rebellion against the Wronged One of the
world [`Abdu‟l-Bahá]. Further, despite the emphatic injunction [of the
Master], the pilgrims leaving the Holy Land would, sooner or later, tell
others what they had found out, and this would sprout seeds of doubt in all
hearts. And I further reflected that perhaps an inner agitation, similar to
what had engulfed me during these few days, might overwhelm others as
well. I thought that perhaps it would be better if His blessed Person allowed
the friends to be generally acquainted with the details. At the least, the kind
of rumor that was current among the believers in Cairo would subside. They
would know how the Master was suffering daily at the hands of His jealous
brothers and other enemies inside and outside the Cause, and how He bore
the enormous expenses of the Mansion, which had become the center of
sedition and the headquarters of His ancestral enemies. Each day, a long list
of food and other necessities – from hay and barley, to meat and poultry -
was sent from the Mansion to be bought. Áqá Rida [Qannad-i-Shirazi] was
in charge of the expenditures and knew better than anyone else about the
unwarranted expenses demanded by the Aghsan. Each day he had to borrow
a sum to administer the affairs and `Abdu‟l-Bahá concealed all these
activities.

I did not sleep the whole of that night. Early in the morning, without telling
any of my companions where I was going, I set out directly for His blessed
House115. En route, on a street corner, I saw His sacred Figure coming
towards me. I bowed down and kissed His feet. He raised me from the
ground and showered me with His infinite kindness, saying, “Were you
coming to visit Me? I too was coming to see you. Today, I want to visit the
poor and needy. Come, so we may be together.”

I began to follow behind His blessed Temple. I knew that He was fully
aware of one‟s inner thoughts and, therefore, knew my condition as well.
The resident believers were called on not to disclose what had happened
[regarding the Covenant-breaking], and the pilgrims were instructed to leave
behind by the seashore whatever they had heard or seen, and return home.
Surely, [I thought,] He was well aware that Mírzá Jalál had described all the
details for me. Also, I had heard some other things from Áqá Rida and
Mishkin-Qalam. He must certainly know the kind of whispers that
circulated among the believers in Cairo and the thoughts they commonly
had.

He asked after the honored [Mírzá] Abu‟l-Fadl, “How is Jináb-i-Mírzá and
how is his health?” He continued with the same theme and asked about the
friends in Cairo and their ways and thoughts. Characteristically, He

showered me with so much kindness that I found the courage to say, “My
Master, it has been rather difficult for some of the friends in Cairo to accept
that Your blessed Person should be under the burden of so much debt, and
yet the Aghsan live luxuriously, spending their time merrymaking.” Before I
could continue, His countenance was filled with rage and He exclaimed,
“How is that?!” and proceeded to walk on. I no longer had the strength to
follow Him and started to tremble uncontrollably. It was as if soul had left
my body. All I could do was lean against a wall. He had taken about 20 steps
before He realized that I was not following behind. Seeing my condition, He
returned, touching this servant on the shoulders. He said, “Tell Me, what has
happened?” He poured out so much kindness and offered such favors and
cheers that I gradually came to myself and began to follow Him.

At His bidding, I explained all that I knew and had heard. I also gave my
own assessment about the sort of talk that was circulating among the friends
and what the Jináb-i-Mírzá [Abu‟l-Fadl] had said, namely, “If the believers
were to know the details, such concerns would surely be alleviated.” The
beloved Master exclaimed several times, “Well said!” He then added, “Until
now, I had not wanted this talk to go beyond `Akká. But now it is clear that
it is already too late and that the foul odor of the Covenant-breaking has
reached the nostrils of the entire world.116 What you see or hear, you are to
share with the friends, but descriptively, not complainingly.” He then
explained many things about the Covenant-breaking of Mírzá Muhammad-
`Alí and the sufferings that He had been forced to endure, adding,
“Recently, a Commission of Inquiry has arrived from Istanbul. Each day, I
go to the government office and they interrogate Me. My brother has filed
an official complaint. If I were to tell you the details, you would be grieved.
Surely, you have heard and seen certain things here, or will hear of them.
You must never complain. Tell the friends about them, but descriptively, not
complainingly.” (I will tell the rest of this story when I recount the
subsequent events in Egypt.)

That day, His blessed Being visited the homes of several of the town‟s poor
and destitute. At each place, with His own hand, He provided them with a
sum of money. He caressed all the small children, hugged them tenderly in
His bosom and kissed them affectionately. Several of those visited were ill
and He ordered their medicine. It was about midday when we returned. Near
the Khán [Avamid] I was given leave from His presence.

The following, by Dr. Yunis Afrukhtih (Khatirat-i-Nuh Salih, pp. 51-2), further explains the effort
that `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s brothers went to spread the news of their split with Him: “`Abdu‟l-Bahá often used to say,
“One day, Mírzá Diya‟u‟llah came to see me. I noticed he was looking at his fingers, which were stained with ink,
expecting Me to comment on them. I did not say anything, so he volunteered the information, saying, „Last night
until the early hours of the morning, we were engaged in writing letters and gelatin printing. Consequently, my
fingers are stained. My brother [Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí] had written a letter, and we printed several copies and
sent them away this morning.‟ I asked him, „Did you really write and dispatch them?‟ And when he answered that
he had, I said, 'I swear by the Righteousness of God! A day will come when Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí will wish that
his fingers had been cut off so that he could not have taken the pen to proclaim his break with the Covenant. For
four years, I have concealed this matter so that the beloved of God may not learn of your unfaithfulness to the
Covenant. It is now beyond My power to hide it any longer. You have announced it yourselves to the believers.‟”

The agitation of the past few days had now completely evaporated. My heart
was assured. I had no worries. I would converse, laugh and not avoid my
companions, knowing that if I divulged anything [about Mírzá Muhammad-
`Alí and his followers], I had the permission of the beloved Master and that
I need not feel repentant about it. Also, [I felt elated] since, on that day, I
had spent several magnificent hours in His presence, benefiting enormously
from His utterances. It was a meeting that transforms even bitter venom into
sweet honey.

When I joined my companions again, they asked me where I had been that
morning. I told them that I had been in the Master‟s presence. Each of them
expressed his joy for my good fortune in his own way and jested with me,
especially Jinab-i-Mufsidu‟l-Mamalik and Dr. Yunis Khán [Afrukhtih], may
my spirit be a sacrifice to their dust.

The Dream of Salih Áqá

Salih Áqá had been a devoted, black slave and one of the eunuchs of Cairo‟s
royal court. After the Khedive117 of Egypt, Isma‟il Pasha, fell from office,
all the slaves and eunuchs of his household that had been taught correct
manners and etiquette were freed. At the time when the Greatest Holy Leaf
came to Cairo, this black slave was introduced to her. As he possessed a
pure and luminous heart, and had mastered all manners and etiquette
[related to serving a royal audience], he had the good fortune of being
employed to serve the Greatest Holy Leaf and to return with her from Cairo
to the Holy Land. In his new capacity, he served the andaruni118 of the house
of the Master as well as His guests and pilgrims.

One day, all the friends, both pilgrims and residents, were in `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s
presence in the biruni when Salih Áqá came in and said, “My Master, last
evening I had a dream that I would like to recount for You.” With utmost
compassion and infinite loving-kindness, `Abdu‟l-Bahá responded, “Do so.”
Salih Áqá spoke an eloquent and engaging Arabic and always stood in a
punctilious manner before the Master. As he related his dream, his words
and expressions revealed the emotion that had prompted him to share his
thoughts. Salih Áqá recounted:

Last night, I dreamt that a very large legion of soldiers had camped on the
plain between `Akká and Haifa. [They were garrisoned so densely that]
passing through them was almost impossible. I stood at the top of a small
rise and, wherever I looked, I saw nothing but soldiers and munitions.
Armaments of all kinds were ready at the camp. I stood in wonder at their
order and discipline and how thoroughly they prepared. At the very heart of

Empire from 1867 to 1914.

reception hall is known as the biruni.

the camp, a magnificent and enormous tabernacle was raised as the
headquarters for the army‟s Commander.

Your blessed Person [`Abdu‟l-Bahá] summoned me to Your presence and
instructed me to saddle a horse. I brought a wonderfully large, white horse
and the Effendi [`Abdu‟l-Bahá] rode towards the camp, while instructing
me, “Come, let us go and meet the Chief of this compound. This army has
come to help us.” On foot, [I followed You], passing by the tents, where all
the soldiers would immediately salute You and stand to attention in
accordance with military custom. We came before that glorious tabernacle,
erected in the midmost heart of the camp, with majestic, golden lanterns
displayed above it. You dismounted and gave the horse to me and, with
extreme reverence, entered the tabernacle. I was lost in bewilderment. Who,
I thought, could the Commander of this army be that He could invoke such
profound veneration in You? I followed You inside and saw inside the
tabernacle a Person whose countenance I could not look upon. His beard
was black and His eyes brilliant.

Salih Áqá then proceeded to describe all the features of the Ancient Beauty.
He then continued:

When Your blessed Person went in, You prostrated and kissed the dust, and
then offered declarations of praise and glorification to that Commander. He
[came forward,] embraced You affectionately, showered You with His tender
kindness, and began to converse with You. Battle plans and maps hung on
the walls of the tabernacle and all were placed at Your disposal. You were
viewing them, conferring with One another on the battle strategy. It was
then that I woke up.

As Salih Áqá was describing his dream, tears streamed from `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s
eyes. The friends too were deeply moved. The tongue of grandeur then
spoke these sweet words: “Blessed is your pure heart and luminous is your
spirit. You serve the sacred Threshold of the Ancient Beauty so faithfully
and are, indeed, among the near ones and His noble servants! The army in
your dream is the Army of God and represents the confirmations of the
Blessed Beauty. The Commander of the army that you saw in the world of
dreams is none other than the Greatest Name, the Person of Bahá‟u‟lláh, and
the Author of this Cause. Those maps and charts that hung on the walls were
plans for the edification and reconstruction of the world.”119 `Abdu‟l-Bahá
then gave a detailed explanation of the importance of the divine Covenant,
the magnificent future of the Cause, and its distinguished and superior
feature over the Dispensations of the past. Afterwards, we left His presence
[for the day].

Actions of the Covenant-beakers

At that time, a Commission of Inquiry had arrived from Istanbul and was
causing enormous anxiety for the Master, the pilgrims and the resident
believers. It was investigating the constant barrage of false and calumnious
reports that Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí had sent to the Sublime Court120 and
the string of lies and deceptions that he had woven.

[Yahya] Tabur Aghasi was [`Akka‟s] Chief of Police and a constant
companion and close friend of Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí. He frequently
visited the Mansion [of Bahjí], and, together with Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí,
Siyyid `Alíy-i-Afnán, [Mírzá] Majdu‟d-Din, Mírzá Áqá Jan and some other
Covenant-breakers, was a principal figure in designing schemes against
`Abdu‟l-Bahá. These people occupied the Mansion like a beehive – a place
that once witnessed the revelation of Tablets and was the seat of God‟s
Supreme Manifestation.

In the early hours of every morning, `Abdu‟l-Bahá would leave His house
and return about one hour after noon or perhaps a bit later. As the Master
was leaving, Salih-Áqá would stand with the greatest dignity and reverence
by the entrance door and leave it open until `Abdu‟l-Bahá returned home.
His attention to his duties and sense of responsibility towards his Master
were indescribable. I well remember on one occasion, the entrance had been
left open as several of the friends were awaiting `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s return.
Strong winds began to blow dust inside the house and one of the servants
decided to close the door. With an agitated face, Salih-Áqá roared in protest,
admonishing him, “How dare you close the entrance to the house of a
Person Who desires to have it open to the entire world!”

When `Abdu‟l-Bahá returned home that day, His blessed visage betrayed
His deep inner turmoil and it was clear that He was very tired.
Consequently, the friends were excused from His presence. That afternoon
when we were summoned, He informed us:

These honored persons121 have sent a report to the Commission of Inquiry,
which has resulted in the Commission‟s head moving with a vengeance to
eradicate the Cause of God. He is now raising a tumult by saying, “The
claims of Your Father and Yourself are at variance with Your deeds and the
objections of Your brother. We have a Hadith that states: „The Messengers
and Prophets do not inherit and have no heir.‟ Your Father claimed the
station of Prophethood and gave You His successorship. Your brother states
that You have confiscated the estate of the Shaykh-i-Kabir122 and deprived
them of their inheritance.”

A reference to Istanbul, the capital of the Ottoman Empire.

That is, the Covenant-breakers.

That is, Bahá‟u‟lláh.

I realized that, with such slanders, they sought to shatter the foundation of
the Cause. However, at that moment, the confirmations of the Supreme
Concourse poured down and the sun of the favors of the Blessed Beauty
shone upon me. I said to him, “The Shaykh-i-Kabir has left a Will and
Testament in His own hand and seal, and defined in it the inheritance of His
heir:

„Although the Realm of Glory hath none of the vanities of the world, yet
within the treasury of trust and resignation We have bequeathed to Our heirs
an excellent and priceless heritage. Earthly treasures We have not
bequeathed, nor have We added such cares as they entail. By God! In earthly
riches fear is hidden and peril is concealed. Consider ye and call to mind
that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur‟an: „Woe betide every
slanderer and defamer, him that layeth up riches and counteth them123.‟”124

`Abdu‟l-Bahá then added, “I said this to him and the words choked his
breath!”

In those days, certain mischievous and disingenuous individuals125 often
frequented the gatherings of the friends, and were also present in that
meeting. `Abdu‟l-Bahá therefore said, “Inform my brother that I am not
`Alí, nor is he `Umar. I am much greater than `Alí and he is much slighter
than `Umar.”126 Then He smiled and talked about many subjects, none of
which I have remembered. Afterwards, we left His presence. After we
returned to the Khán [Avamid], each of us was filled with grief and sadness
over the actions of the Covenant-breakers and their lack of faith.

Mírzá Áqá Jan

At that time, the Covenant-breakers could generally be divided into two
groups. One group consisted of those who had completely severed their
relationship with the thabityn and, having crawled into a corner, spent their
days and nights in close companionship and fraternity of Mírzá
Muhammad-`Alí. The other group consisted of those who associated with
the friends and the thabityn. This latter group would [openly] attend the
presence of the beloved Master. But they were really agents of Mírzá
Muhammad-`Alí and Mírzá Madju‟d-Din, and were told to try and
undermine the confidence of the friends, agitate their hearts and cloud their
thoughts. This group was extremely insidious and dangerous. For instance,
when a new pilgrim arrived [in the Holy Land], they would befriend and
engage him, presenting themselves as deeply devoted to `Abdu‟l-Bahá, so

world Centre, 1982, p.219.

Qur‟an 104:1-2

Allusion to the agents of Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí.

Dr. Afrukhtih reports a slight variation of this story: “On numerous occasions, He [`Abdu‟l-Bahá]
sent word to the Naqid-i-Akbar [Arch-Covenant-breaker], „Neither are you `Umar to shoulder such a mighty
Cause, nor am I `Alí to cry over your doings in the palm-grove.‟” (Khatirat-i-Nuh Salih, p. 235)

that the unsuspecting visitor would think that they were sincere and loyal to
the Covenant and Testament. However, their motive was, through whatever
means possible, to plant seeds of discord in the heart of their victims, poison
their soul and undermine their faith. [These agents] would attend the
gatherings of the friends in the Pilgrim House [of `Akka] and participate in
their conversations, which they would gradually begin to dominate. They
would talk of the days of the Ancient Beauty and express their
disappointment over the events subsequent to His ascension. They would
describe the state of affairs in the Mansion, the condition of Mírzá
Muhammad-`Alí, the anguish of [Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s] widow and others, thereby
causing sincere believers to be uncontrollably moved with sorrow.

For example, after 40 years of being in the presence of Bahá‟u‟lláh, serving
as amanuensis for the Divine Revelation, and in the end losing both this
world and the next, the faithless and wicked Mírzá Áqá Ján would attain the
presence of the Master, [falsely displaying] humility and reverence. He
would stand at the threshold of the room, by the spot where shoes were
removed. After receiving `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s permission, he would sit at the
very back of the room pretending to be in rapture and consumed with
adoration for the beloved Master. And, outside of the gathering, he would
engage the friends with the utmost consideration and charm. However, this
abominable man was in constant contact with the Mansion and the
Covenant-breakers.

And so it was until the events of the commemoration of Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s
ascension [in May 1897]. On this day, his malicious nature and sinister
character surfaced and became evident. The following is an account of that
day.

A few days before the anniversary of Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s ascension, evidence of
grief and deep sorrow were apparent on the Master‟s countenance and the
friends visiting the Holy Land were pensive and heartbroken as well. The
Master‟s appearance was such that the resident believers like the late Áqá
Rida [Qannad] and Mashkin-Qalam, who had been with `Abdu‟l-Bahá [for
many years], expressed bewilderment over His condition. They said that
they had never seen so much despondency on His face. Everyone thought
that `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s heart was heavy with anguish and sadness because of
the approaching eve of [the anniversary of] the Blessed Beauty‟s ascension.

These few days passed with great difficulty and gloom, until the 70th day
after Naw-Ruz127. The friends were gathered at the Pilgrim House and
`Abdu‟l-Bahá was present in that meeting as well. We remained there until
about two hours before the time marking the ascension. At that time, His

Bahá‟u‟lláh's ascension occurred 70 days after Naw-Ruz, on the eve of 29 May 1892, at 3 a.m. It is
customary to recite the Tablet of Visitation at that time. Bahá‟u‟lláh. “Tablet of Visitation.” In Bahá‟í Prayers: A

blessed Person summoned all the believers and gave each a candle and a
bottle of rosewater. With unreserved grief and sorrow, we proceeded
towards the Mansion of Bahjí and Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s Shrine, following His
blessed Figure.

[Along the way,] `Abdu‟l-Bahá called on several of the friends to chant
prayers. Áqá Fadlu‟llah began to chant Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s Mathnavi128 and, in
such a meditative atmosphere, we arrived at the Shrine. `Abdu‟l-Bahá
instructed us to pour the rosewater on the inner garden of the Shrine and to
plant the candles in the same soil. With His heavenly and soul-stirring tone,
`Abdu‟l-Bahá chanted the Tablet of Visitation. Tears were streaming from
His eyes and the mourning of the friends soared heavenwards. The sound of
sobbing and yearning filled the court of the Shrine of Bahá‟u‟lláh. Until
morning, each person was occupied offering prayers and supplications to the
Threshold of the Beloved, oblivious of his surroundings.

At `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s bidding, we returned to the Pilgrim House of the
Mansion, had tea and rested. His blessed Being went to an adjacent room
next to the Shrine. After tea, we visited the Shrine once again. Later, we all
gathered in the building of the Pilgrim House under the shadow of the
Mansion of Bahjí.

On that day, Mírzá Áqá Jan, who, over the span of 40 years, had partaken
immeasurably of Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s ocean of favors and munificence, had asked
the friends to be his guests for lunch, so that the feast on that occasion
would be marked in his name. This invitation was accepted by `Abdu‟l-
Bahá. Mírzá Áqá Jan had prepared bread and broth for lunch. A few hours
before sunset, while some of the friends were sleeping in the Pilgrim House
and some were awake, he came to the Pilgrim House and started saying, “O
ye believers in the Blessed Beauty! Today is not a day to rest. Because of
this calamity [the ascension of Bahá‟u‟lláh], today the world and its
inhabitants are in lamentation. Today, the denizens of the Supreme
Concourse are fervently sobbing and are bitterly grief-stricken. Arise!
Arise!” So, everyone got up and gathered about.

Mírzá Áqá Jan ascended a stool - that same Khadimu‟llah, that same `Abd-i-
Hadir129, that same person who, because of countless favors bestowed on
him by Bahá‟u‟lláh, had attained a great station and possessed an
unequalled prestige in the Faith, to the point where the most prominent
believers were humbled before him. He spoke like this: “In a dream, the
Ancient Beauty bequeathed the station of divine revelation upon me,” and
then proceeded to belittle and speak disparagingly of the sacred station of
`Abdu‟l-Bahá. After voicing only a few sentences, the thabityn and the

believers were so greatly enraged that they decided to slay him. Two of
them, Habíb Áqá130 and Taraz131, the son of Áqá Mírzá Muhmud-i-Kashi,
who were stronger than the rest, rose to their feet, grasped his throat and
pulled Mírzá Áqá Jan from the stool. They started to punch and kick him,
with the intention of taking his life. [Through Mírzá Áqá Ján‟s death,] the
plan of Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí and the other Covenant-breakers was about
to be fulfilled and their malicious desires realized. However, before it was
too late, Mírzá `Alí-Akbar, son of the honored Mishkin-Qalam, rushed to
the presence of `Abdu‟l-Bahá and told Him the situation. `Abdu‟l-Bahá
came quickly. He pulled Mírzá Áqá Jan from beneath the hands and feet of
the friends and took him to the Shrine of Bahá‟u‟lláh.

The author of this scheme, Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí, had invited [Yahya]
Tabur Aghasi, the Chief of Police, and a number of other notable enemies of
the Cause to the Mansion. He hoped that, when Mírzá Áqá Jan made his
accusations, it would provoke the believers into a violent response and
result in a brawl between the two sides. He expected that the Police would
be forced to intervene and the situation would end in their favor. However,
with `Abdu‟l-Bahá arriving on the scene [and rescuing Mírzá Áqá Jan], their
plans came to naught and the officers had no reason to intervene.

In `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s company, Mírzá Áqá Jan was taken to the Shrine. The
Master locked the Shrine‟s entrance from inside. There, this abominable
man, who had been freed from the grasp of the friends [by `Abdu‟l-Bahá],
made an attempt on the Master‟s life. Furious and deeply upset, the friends
stood outside the Shrine and the Holy Family waited in the adjacent rooms,
while `Abdu‟l-Bahá remained inside. We were truly distressed and agitated,
until the Master opened the Shrine‟s entrance. He instructed Mírzá Habíb
and Taraz to take Mírzá Áqá Jan to a stable near the Mansion. He
confiscated all the papers he had hidden inside his pockets and returned only
his seal to him. Mírzá Áqá Jan had wrapped large handkerchiefs containing
seditious papers around his waist and under his `aba, and had many similar
materials stuffed in his side pockets as well. `Abdu‟l-Bahá then dismissed us
from His presence and we returned to `Akká.132

Through this scheme, the Covenant-breakers intended to create an
unfavorable situation, so that police officers would interfere in the affairs of
the Cause and seize control of the Shrine. Even though the divine plan has
always been, and will always be, more powerful than their sinister schemes,
they didn‟t stop. They used cash, gifts, [Chinese] ceramic vessels 133, and

Better known as Mírzá Habíbu‟llah. He was a son of Áqá Ridá Qannád-i-Shirazí and the father of
`Abbas Huvayda, a long-time Prime Minister of Iran during the rule of Muhammad-Reza Sháh Pahlavi.

In the latter years of `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s ministry, he broke the Covenant.

With some minor variations, another eyewitness account of this event is recorded in Khatirat-i-Nuh
Salih, pp. 80-84.

The Afnán family had extensive trade with China and the Far East, and several of them had offices in
these countries as far as Shanghai. Throughout Bahá‟u‟lláh's ministry, they presented the Holy Family with many pieces

Persian carpets from the days of Bahá‟u‟lláh that were used by His sacred
Person, to bribe government authorities, political officials and anyone else
associated with the State, hoping to win their sympathy. They either
presented them with these gifts or sold the items at a nominal price until,
eventually, their activities resulted in the Commission of Inquiry coming [to
the Holy Land] and the amazing events that then happened.

O dear readers, who may one day peruse these notes! I swear by the oneness
of the Author of the Cause, that no pen, save the august pen of the Center of
the Covenant Himself, is able to convey a thousandth part of the calamities
and tribulations that beset the blessed Person of `Abdu‟l-Bahá in those days.
They were filled entirely with pain and sufferings. Innumerable Tablets
revealed in honor of friends throughout every corner of the world bear
witness to this humble statement.

The papers discovered in the pockets of Mírzá Áqá Jan, or hidden elsewhere
on his person, were found to be all written in the style of Revelation Writing
and addressed to different friends, particularly prominent believers
throughout the Bahá‟í world. Each was given a mission and a [new] title.
According to their scheme, Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí and [Mírzá] Madju‟d-
Din hoped that the letters would confuse the friends and undermine their
confidence [in `Abdu‟l-Bahá]. Such was the lifelong harvest of a man who
had been singularly favored by the Almighty, but now had lost both this
world and the next. I beseech God, through His subduing Might, omnipotent
Authority, encompassing Favors and ever-present Grace, to protect all
believers from the whisperings of evil-doers and worldly passions, and to
guard the friends throughout all ages within the stronghold of His Covenant
and the shelter of His Cause.

The following day, when we attained the presence of the beloved Master in
His house, we noticed that He had spread all of Mírzá Áqá Jan‟s papers on a
table and was looking through them. On seeing us, He laughed and handed
us a blue sheet of paper, saying, “Look, one of these tablets was addressed
to your illustrious father!”

In short, the atrocities committed by the Covenant-breakers against the body
of the Cause was so heart-wrenching and harrowing that they truly defy
description. The heat and flames of this fire engulfed and encircled the
pilgrims and visitors alike. At last, due to the uncertainty in the Holy Land,
the constant agitation of the Covenant-breakers and the arrival of the
Commission of Inquiry, the entire company of pilgrims was dismissed.
`Abdu‟l-Bahá specifically instructed me to keep all correspondence,
received from the believers in Iran or other corners, in Port Said. It was not
to be forwarded to the Holy Land, as danger was always present. After that,

Places in Haifa and `Akka, such as the House of `Abbud.

the Iranian pilgrims returned to Iran and the pilgrims from Egypt traveled to
Port Said.

Departure from the Holy Land

One day, the custodian of the Pilgrim House, Áqá Muhammad-Hasan, came
and informed us that the beloved Master had instructed us to leave the Holy
Land within a week. The next morning, `Abdu‟l-Bahá called this servant
and my late brother into His presence and said, “Because of the
uncertainties in this land, return [to Egypt] aboard next week‟s ship. The
Covenant-breakers have reported to the Commission of Inquiry that, in
addition to the luxury of our lives in this House, the Pilgrim House has
become very crowded because, day and night, we are entertaining a large
number of pilgrims and resident believers. They claim that, with a large
salary, we have hired for our own service a eunuch from the court of the
[Egyptian] Pashas. Although I do not want to part with Salih-Aqa, there are
compelling reasons for him not to remain here. It is best for him to return to
Cairo as your guardian.” We both bowed down in respect [and obedience].

The following day, we were once again called into His presence, and Salih
Áqá was there as well. After showering His infinite kindness upon this
fortunate black slave, who was the envy of all whites, the beloved Master
said, “Salih Áqá, I did not want to send you away and had desired for you to
remain in the Holy Land and continue serving the friends here. However, I
am in a quandary. These two youth are very dear to me and are the trust of
one of my closest friends. I wish now to commit this trust to your care and
pray that you will do your best to look after them.” Though not a believer,
Salih Áqá profoundly adored the Master and, in tears, implored Him,
“Effendi, I desire to remain close to this Threshold and serve it until my last
breath. Would it be possible for the request of this servant to find acceptance
in Your sight? Had it been Effendi‟s wish, in a single moment, a hundred
guardians would have been found for these two.” The Master responded,
“Would you allow these two youth, whose father has entrusted them to me,
to travel to a strange land? No one is more trustworthy than you.” At last,
with tears pouring from his eyes, this noble black man said, “Whatever is
Your blessed will, I shall obey and resign myself to Your good-pleasure.”
`Abdu‟l-Bahá consoled him, “I will summon you back here as soon as these
honored youth have established themselves in Cairo, started a business and
familiarized themselves with the Arabic language.”

Because the time to leave the presence of the Center of the Covenant was
near, we were particularly depressed and downcast during the last few days
of our pilgrimage. In this period, all His blessed utterances centered on the
activities of the Covenant-breakers, the hardship of the Baghdad period and
the sufferings that the Blessed Perfection had endured at the hands of the
followers of Azal.

During this pilgrimage journey, immeasurable divine favors and bounties
were showered upon this undeserving servant. I considered myself
thoroughly unworthy of these, as I found nothing but shortcomings and
neglect in my deeds. With His own hands, the Master graciously bestowed
upon me His Arab `aba, which I thankfully received, kissed and placed to
my brow. That `aba is now kept among the sacred relics of the Archives of
the House of the Báb in Shiraz.

In those days, each morning, the blessed Person of `Abdu‟l-Bahá had to go
to the government house and would not return until late afternoon. Many of
the days, the pilgrims and resident believers could not behold His heavenly
countenance or attain His presence. The exception was when they saw Him
on the streets and en route. Then He would briefly greet the friends and
quickly go on His way.

With `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s permission, the day before our departure, we visited
the Shrine of Bahá‟u‟lláh and offered our last homage. The next morning,
the Master called us into His presence and, with a world of sadness, we bid
Him farewell. We traveled to Haifa and, from there, to Port Said.

Back in Egypt

As mentioned earlier, the veil concealing the deeds of the violators of the
divine Covenant was not yet lifted. They continued to associate with some
of the friends. Through various means, they sought to spread their polemics
and tried to undermine the believers‟ confidence and confuse their thinking.
`Abdu‟l-Bahá had instructed me to share [with the friends] all I had heard
[while on pilgrimage] in a descriptive way.

In Cairo, the same rumour and speculation as before was still circulating.
When this servant arrived, the friends gathered at our house and Mírzá
Abu‟l-Fadl came as well. [During our discussion,] the subject of the Holy
Land and the afflictions surrounding the beloved Master came up. I
explained all that I had seen or heard and the sufferings that beset `Abdu‟l-
Bahá. I called the Ghusnu‟llah Akbar [the Great Branch of the divine Tree]
by his given name Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí. Similarly, I referred to Mírzá
Badi`u‟llah and Mírzá Diya‟u‟llah by their names only and did not refer to
them as the Aghsan of the Tree of Holiness. Suddenly, quite angrily and
with fury, Mírzá Abu‟l-Fadl addressed me, “How dare a youngster like you
be so presumptuousness towards the Branches of the Tree of Sanctity and
insult the text of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas! The spirit of the Prophets and
Messengers circle in adoration around these sacred figures and no one in the
world is permitted to belittle them. The explicit text of the Kitáb-i-`Ahdi, the
Will and Testament of the Blessed Beauty, states that the entire world must
respect Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s widows, the [members of the] Holy Household and the

Aghsan.”134 He voiced his views with such passion and indignation that I
felt paralyzed. The more I repeated, “I saw and heard `Abdu‟l-Bahá relate
these things and do not share them on my own accord,” the more he roared
back that, “I do not accept hadith.” Finally, I was forced to say, “Write to
His sacred Threshold. What He favors with a reply is verily the essence of
truth.” He replied, “Of course I shall write!”

Mírzá Abu‟l-Fadl immediately sent a supplication to the Holy Land. In
response to his letter, a Tablet similar to the Lawh-i-Hizar Bayti135 was
revealed in 16 pages in `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s own hand. It started with these
sweet words: “He is the Most Glorious. O thou who hath devoted thy life to
the propagation of the Word of God!” This Tablet detailed the deeds of the
Covenant-breakers and the jealousy and enmity of the people of rancor.

In short, this is how the efforts of the Covenant-breakers [to subvert the
Cause] became known to the friends throughout Egypt. [The believers]
immediately severed all connection with them.

After receiving this Tablet, Mírzá Abu‟l-Fadl showered this servant with the
greatest kindness. He apologized so frequently that, to this day - some 50
years later – I am embarrassed [by his extreme generosity]. Later, he gave
that Tablet to Áqá `Abdu‟l-Husayn Samandari136, who was in Egypt at the
time, to make a copy for him, and gifted me the original Text as a momento.
That Tablet is currently in a safe place.137

As instructed by `Abdu‟l-Bahá, I related the events of the Holy Land and
the activities of the Covenant-breakers to my father [in Shiraz]. He informed
the friends throughout Shiraz, Abadih, Sarvistan and Nayriz. As a divine
favor, during the Days of God, the seeds of firmness and faithfulness had
been planted in the hearts of the friends in [the province of] Fárs.
Throughout the ministry of the Center of Covenant, all the believers [in
Fárs] were immune to the temptations and satanic whisperings of the
Covenant-breakers. The sole exception was a certain Mullá Husayn-`Alí
Jahrumi138, who fell under the influence of the violators of the Covenant in

The two injunctions of the Kitab-i-`Ahdi are: “It is incumbent upon everyone to show courtesy to, and
have regard for the Aghsan...”, and “Ye are bidden moreover to respect [My wife,] members of the Holy Household, the
Afnán and the kindred.” (Bahá‟u‟lláh. “Kitáb-i-„Ahd (Book of the Covenant).” In Tablets of Bahá‟u‟lláh Revealed
after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. pp. 222-3).

Revealed in the same year, 1897, for Mírzá Jalil-i-Khu‟i. Because of its length, it is known as the Tablet
of One Thousand Verses. The original is found in INBMC 52:551-605. „Abdu‟l-Bahá. “Lawh-i-Hizar Bayti.” In

The older brother of Tarazu‟llah Samandari.

The original text of `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s Tablet remains among the Sacred Writings and other Holy relics
in the Archives of the House of the Báb. Mírzá Habíb left instructions with his sons to publish the text of this
Tablet with his memoirs. The Bahá‟í World Centre has advised the present translator that they will publish a
translation of this important Tablet in due course.

In his memoirs, Hájí `Alíy-i-Yazdi states that Jahrumi was influential in the Covenant-breakers‟
scheme to use Mírzá Áqá Jan against the Master. For a summary translation, see, Taherzadeh, The Covenant of
Bahá‟u‟lláh, pp. 184-5.

India and became wayward. When he returned to Jahrum, he was shunned
by all, near and far, and died in the utmost poverty.

A Pilgrim from Mecca139

During the time that my brother and I were engaged in commerce at Port
Said, the Consul-General of Iran gave us the seal of the Consulate in Egypt
so that we could stamp the passports of the Iranian pilgrims returning from
Mecca. This was to prevent them from proceeding to Cairo and further
burdening the Consulate Office in that city. One of the pilgrims who came to
us to process his passport was a tall and corpulent Siyyid who appeared to
be a dignified man. He said to us, “I do not wish to return to Iran with my
fellow travelers so soon [after our pilgrimage]. I want to journey in this
region.” However, his traveling companions were adamant that he should
return, saying, “We have paid all his travel expenses so that, throughout the
h.ajj journey and our return home, he would be our prayer-guide and
example, informing us of our religious duties. Now that we are returning
from the House of God [in Mecca], it is unfair of this Siyyid to leave us
stranded and unguided in mid-journey. Furthermore, we have taken an oath
in the name of his illustrious Ancestor to pay for his return [to Iran] and we
do not want to betray our promise.”

In private, they had earlier asked me to convince the Siyyid to comply with
his solemn agreement. Therefore, I said to him, “This is a foreign country
and you have no friends or acquaintances here. In addition, you do not speak
the vernacular Arabic or its Egyptian dialect and may find yourself
inconvenienced. Reason dictates that you not hurt the feelings of your
traveling companions and comply with their request. Further, this country is
not like Iran, where it is customary to organize passion plays and Siyyids are
paid for their sermons. If you stay in this region, I am certain that you will
be disappointed.” With a face flushed with anger, he responded sarcastically,
“I am responsible for myself. Should I come to your house, you may refuse
me hospitality!” I had nothing more to say. Since their ship was ready to
pull anchor, the other pilgrims left and the Siyyid stayed.

The following day, the Siyyid came to my office in the same state and said,
“The reason I didn‟t want to return to Iran with my fellow pilgrims is
because I want to visit `Abbás Effendi in `Akká.” The enmity of the
Covenant-breakers in those days had reached its peak. The Holy Land was
in turmoil and many perils surrounded the blessed Person of `Abdu‟l-Bahá.
I didn‟t consider it prudent for such a Siyyid to visit `Akká at that time and
offered many excuses. I said, “Attaining His presence is not an easy task.
First, one must receive His permission and it may well take over a month for
the post to deliver your letter and bring back a reply. It is best if you go back

to Iran and leave this visit for another opportune time.” “How do you make
a visit?” he inquired. I responded, “We first pray fervently and focus our
thoughts on His sacred Being. Then, with the utmost sincerity and humility,
we send a request. After that, we wait for His response. If we are given a
favorable reply, with utter elation and yearning, we attain His presence and
stay for however many days He allows. Upon leaving, we [once again] pay
homage at the Shrine of Bahá‟u‟lláh and return home.” He responded, “I
will not go in this manner. I will join whoever is traveling to `Akká.” I
finally surrendered, “The route to `Akká is known. Travel as you think
best.”

Immediately, I sent a telegraph to Áqá Siyyid [Muhammad-] Taqi Manshadi
in Haifa, warning him that such a person was arriving and giving him the
vessel‟s details. Áqá Siyyid Taqi went by the ship and took the Siyyid first
to Haifa and, from there, sent him to `Akká on a hired coach. He also
telegraphed `Abdu‟l-Bahá about the matter. Mishkin-Qalam related the
details of his visit for me:

> When the Siyyid arrived at the Khán-i-`Avamid, he called out in a

The Siyyid was in the Holy Land for 15 days. `Abdu‟l-Bahá paid his travel
expenses to Beirut and wrote to Áqá Muhammad-Mustafa Baghdadi to
ensure his comfort and arrange his travel to Iran.

[Some years later], I asked Áqá Muhammad-Mustafa about this Siyyid and
what had become of him. He replied, “When he arrived by boat, I went to
welcome him and brought him home. After we began to converse, I asked
him, „Now that you have spent 15 days in the presence of `Abbas Effendi,
what have you learned and what impression did this meeting leave with
you?‟ He replied, „In truth, and between us and God, `Abbas Effendi is the
most accomplished of men. He is knowledgeable in all branches of learning
and knows of divine truth hidden from us. However, when it comes to the
science of Islamic jurisprudence, He appears wanting.‟” Áqá Mustafa
continued, “I said to him, „He has left the science of “unclean and clean”140
and such unworthy things for people such as you to ponder and devote your
time to.‟ After a few days, the Siyyid was sent to Iran through Damascus.”

Siyyid `Alíy-i-Afnán

Siyyid `Alíy-i-Afnán141 was the second child of Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Hasan,
known as the Afnán-i-Kabír. As a result of supplications [to Bahá‟u‟lláh]

`Ilm-i nájasat is a sub-branch of Shi`i jurisprudence.

The writings of the Guardian record that a son-in-law of Bahá‟u‟lláh, Siyyid `Alíy-i-Afnán, was an
entrenched enemy of `Abdu‟l-Bahá and that he had previously caused the untimely death of Khadíjih Bagum by
abandoning his promise to escort her to the presence of Bahá‟u‟lláh. The following telegraph from Shoghi Effendi
refers to this: “Inform National Assemblies that God‟s avenging wrath having afflicted in rapid succession during
recent years two sons, brother and sister-in-law of Arch-breaker of Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s Covenant, has now struck down
second son of Siyyid `Alí, Nayer Afnán, pivot of machinations, connecting link between old and new Covenant-
breakers. Time alone will reveal extent of havoc wreaked by this virus of violation injected, fostered over two
decades in `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s family. History will brand him one whose grandmother, wife of Bahá‟u‟lláh, joined
breakers of His Covenant on morrow of His passing, whose parents lent her undivided support, whose father
openly accused `Abdu‟l-Bahá as one deserving capital punishment, who broke his promise to the Báb‟s wife to
escort her to Holy Land, precipitating thereby her death, who was repeatedly denounced by Center of the

from the wife of the Báb, Khadíjih Bagum, and `Abdu‟l-Bahá, he was
honored with becoming a son-in-law to the Blessed Beauty.142 At first, he
promised the illustrious wife of the Báb that, should she intercede on his
behalf by sending a letter to the sacred Threshold of Bahá‟ulláh, he would
come to Shiraz and travel with her to the Holy Land. His father also wrote
to her in this vein. The wife of the Báb longed to attain the blessed presence
[of Bahá‟u‟lláh] and behold the countenance of the Sovereign of the world.

Therefore, in order to enlighten the reader further, it is best that I now share
a letter written by the wife of `Abdu‟l-Bahá [Munirih Khánum] to the
honored wife of the Báb. It illustrates the extent of the latter‟s intense desire
to attain the presence of Bahá‟u‟lláh and her eagerness to share in the
blessings of such a pilgrimage:

> ... In short, you had written, “On every occasion [that you are] in the
> presence of the Divine Effulgence [Bahá‟u‟lláh], may my spirit be a

> through the blessings of the pure souls, this remoteness will pass and

Covenant as His chief enemy...” (Shoghi Effendi. Messages to the Bahá‟í World, 1950-1957. Wilmette: Bahá‟í
Publishing Trust, 1971, pp. 24-25) In this chapter, Mírzá Habíb records some of the details associated with Siyyid
`Alí‟s broken promise and its devastating effect on Khadíjih Bagum.

Siyyid `Alí married Furughiyyih, a daughter of Bahá‟u‟lláh from His third wife, Gawhar Khánum.

Presumably, Shaykh Salman, the courier of Bahá‟u‟lláh.

Munirih Khánum visited Shiraz on her way to `Akka to marry `Abdu‟l-Bahá and recorded the
following (Khándan-i-Afnán, pp. 165-6): “...The wife of the Báb said: „Please supplicate the Blessed Perfection to
grant two wishes of mine. The first, one of the exalted leaves of the Blessed Family may be permitted to join in
wedlock with a member of the Family of the Báb, so that even outwardly the two Holy Trees may be knit together.
The other, to grant me permission to attend His presence.‟ I conveyed this message when I attained the presence of
Bahá‟u‟lláh. He readily assented to both her requests.” An additional request of Khadíjih Bagum was for the
House of the Báb to be renovated and this was also accepted.

> with the joy of your mention. We beseech Him Who does what He
> wills to gather all the Leaves of His divine Lote-Tree in one spot, so
> that all will raise their voice in His praise and glorification and quaff
> the sweet wine of union from the chalice of immortality passed from
> one to another.” ...145

> The supplication of the wife of the Báb was accepted into the
> presence of the Lord of the world of being. In a letter written by
> Munirih Khánum to the blessed wife [of the Báb], the following was
> noted:

> You wrote about the matter that we had agreed.146 Know, then, that
> your request was presented in the Sacred Presence and considered
> with favor. Praised be God and glorified be His name! The grace of
> God has surrounded your esteemed self in such wise that even such a
> tremendous petition has found acceptance before His throne!147

After Bahá‟u‟lláh consented to this union, Siyyid `Alí went to Simnán for
his commercial activities. His father remained in Yazd and his older brother,
Siyyid Mírzá, went to Bombay. The illustrious wife of the Báb passed on the
news of the blessed permission [of Bahá‟u‟lláh] to [her brother,] the Afnán-
i-Kabír. She also expressed her extreme excitement and eagerness to take
part in this journey. She further wrote, “Day and night, I expectantly look
for your arrival [in Shiraz].”

After waiting a considerable time, she received a letter from the Afnán-i-
Kabír148 and Siyyid `Alí, saying:

> Since the means for our journey to Shiraz are not available at this

Numerous letters are extant from them on this subject. However, we must
content ourselves with quoting just one as evidence, so that the reader can
plainly see how unfaithful the Covenant-breakers were to the blessed wife

This letter is also quoted in Khándan-i-Afnán, pp. 175-6.

Reference to the confidential agreement about the marriage of Siyyid `Alí with Furughiyyih Khánum.

Quoted also in Khándan-i-Afnán, pp. 175.

The term „Afnán-i-Kabir‟ was originally bestowed upon the uncle of the Báb, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid
Muhammad (see Bahá‟u‟lláh; Collection of Tablets revealed in honor of Áqá Mírzá Áqáy-i-Núri‟d-Dín; MS, n.d.,
p. 60). However, in later years it became a designation for Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Hasan.

He embraced the Faith during the Báb‟s sermon at Masjid-i-Vakil and, subsequently, was taught the
Faith through the loving-kindness of Khadíjih Bagum. He became a resident in the House of the Báb after the
Báb‟s martyrdom and Khadíjih Bagum‟s departure for the home of the martyred uncle. He passed away around
1897\.

of the Báb. She had suffered so long and so bitterly in the path of the Faith,
and the one solace for her broken heart would have been attaining the
presence of the Blessed Beauty. Siyyid `Alíy-i-Afnán, in a letter dated 19
Ramadan 1299 A.H. [14 August 1882], writes from Simnán:

> Humbly submitted to the presence of that honored noblewoman, may
> she be blessed with a long life:

> Your blessed letter spoke of your perseverance and health, and this
> caused us to raise our voice in praise and gratitude to the threshold of

> However, your blessed letter was bereft of kind sentiments towards

> God willing, the Almighty will fulfil our arrangements in a splendid

> At the time of my departure from Simnán, I was not fully apprised of
> my father‟s travel arrangements, and did not know whether he

Parenthetically, Mírzá Habíb has added, “my older brother.”

> And should this [suggested] arrangement fail to please you, then,
> God willing, I will come from there [the Holy Land] and we will
> travel together. ...”

In a letter to the wife of the Báb, the Afnán-i-Kabír, expresses the following
sentiments:

> Again I submit that, concerning the travel of that exalted lady
> [Khadíjih Bagum], Áqá Siyyid `Alí has written to the honored Hájí
> Mírzá Buzurg. God willing, arrangements for your departure will be

> to the desired destination [the Holy Land].

One after another, the blessed wife of the Báb received communications
from Áqá Mírzá Muhsin and others that thoroughly dashed her hopes of
ever attaining the presence of Bahá‟u‟lláh.152

During that time, my late father was doing business in Bombay, and my
paternal grandmother, [Zahra Bagum], told him in writing what had
happened. Each week, my late father would write to the wife of the Báb. He
was filled with gratitude to her for affection governed their relationship. On
this occasion, too, my father wrote a letter describing some of the misdeeds
and the infidelity of these kinsmen. I quote a portion of this letter here:

> To the presence of that honorable and exalted lady, may my life be a
> sacrifice unto you:

> My sole supplication at the Threshold of the All-Glorious Lord is
> your well-being and health. Through the grace of the Exalted God,
> may happiness ever surround you!

> Previously, the details were recorded for your kind consideration and
> submitted in a humble letter. God willing, it has been perused by
> your good self. On this occasion, I humbly note that your cherished
> and most gracious letters of 9 Sha‟ban [26 June 1882] and 2
> Ramadan [10 July 1882] were received. Through your most kind and
> benevolent letters, I learned of their [the Afnán-i-Kabir and Siyyid
> `Alí‟s] departure for Mecca and their unfulfilled promises. Their
> misdeeds are not surprising; what bewilders me is that your esteemed

> That honorable lady must not be sad, nor should you dwell on what

> of this task [to accompany you] was not to be theirs. God did not

> I will forward your letter to the presence of Bahá‟u‟lláh, and will
> write separately to Áqá Siyyid Mihdi153.

In short, my father wrote extensively to console the wife of the Báb. Even at
the end of this letter, he noted:

> I have now sent the letter of that esteemed lady [to Baha‟ullah] and I
> have also informed Áqá Siyyid Mihdi. Do not give way to despair.
> God will decree what is best for all. Of a certainty, His Holiness the

became seriously ill through acute depression and she contracted dysentery.
Within two months of hearing the news from her brother and faithless
nephew, she left this transient life for her eternal abode within the
everlasting divine paradise and for perpetual consort with the sacred spirits
of the Prophets and His chosen ones. Her unique and exalted station is
evident from the Tablet of Visitation revealed by Bahá‟u‟lláh in her honor,
which adorned these pages earlier.

I wish, also, to quote a letter of the late Hájí Mírzá Abú‟l-Qásim-i-Afnán,
the older brother of Khadíjih Bagum. He selflessly and devotedly served his
noble sister until her last breath. This letter is addressed to my late father in
Bombay. In it, he describes the events during and after the passing of
Khadíjih Bagum.

Bahá‟u‟lláh notes in a Tablet addressed to Núri‟d-Dín that the wife of the Báb always longed for the
privilege of pilgrimage: “O My Afnán! My Glory of God be upon thee, as well as My Bounty, My Peace, My
Favor and My Mercy! Day and night, that esteemed and late lady wished to attain Our presence and desired to
behold Our Countenance. This was the object that her heart longed for, her tongue spoke of, her eyes searched for
expectantly and her whole being yearned for; and yet, the divine decree prevented.” INBMC 51:332-3, no. 338

Qur‟an 3:73

This letter does not give the exact date of Khadíjih Bagum‟s passing. However, Mírzá Habíb has
noted that it was in the month of Dhi‟l-Hajjih; see In the Land of Refuge, Chapter 9. This is consistent with Mírzá

Abú‟l-Qásim‟s statement that her death occurred on the second of the month, which is a Monday. Therefore, it
seems clear that she passed away on 2 Dhi‟l-Hajjih 1299 A.H. (16 October 1882). Based on this evidence, the
dates given in Khadíjih Bagum, p. 35 (15 September 1882) and Khándan-i-Afnán, p. 179, (29 Dhi‟l-H.ajjih) must
be incorrect. The latter date must also be incorrect because it falls after Mírzá Abú‟l-Qásim wrote this letter.

Named after its owner, Khayr, this public bathhouse is otherwise known as the Hammam-i-

Hájí Mírzá Abú‟l-Qásim was unaware that, some time earlier, the title of the House of the Báb was
lost in a robbery at the home of Mírzá Zaynu‟l-`Abidin (Núri‟d-Dín‟s father).

A reference to the sons of the Afnán-i-Kabir, who lived in Yazd.

During the early days of the Afnán family, there was considerable competition within certain
quarters of the family over the House of the Báb. On several occasions, the issue was brought to Bahá‟u‟lláh. He
consistently reaffirmed the hereditary custodianship of Zahra Bagum and her descendants. By the time of `Abdu‟l-
Bahá‟s Ministry, only a few family members questioned the custodianship rights. However, to ensure complete
unity, the Master reaffirmed the hereditary right of Núri‟d-Dín and, thereafter, Mírzá Habíb. Before his passing,
Mírzá Habíb passed the custodianship to his oldest son, Abú‟l-Qásim Afnán.

This was a portion of a letter of the late Hájí Mírzá Abú‟l-Qásim, who wrote
it shortly after the passing of the wife of the Báb in Shiraz. [I have] included
it in these pages to acquaint us with the details.

In accordance with Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s instructions, in 1308 A.H. [1891], Mírzá
Muhammad-`Alí169 went to Bombay to publish some of the Holy Tablets. As
the Blessed Beauty instructed, he purchased a gravestone for the resting
place of the wife of the Báb. The following verse, revealed from the heaven
of divine will, was engraved on it: “He is the Everlasting. Verily this exalted
leaf hearkened to the Call of the Tree beyond which there is no passing and
winged her flight towards it. 1299.”170 This stone was left as a trust in the
home of the late Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-`Alíy-i-Afnán (a son of the

A coded reference to `Akka, where Bahá‟u‟lláh resided.

The following Tablet of the Báb addressed to Khadíjih Bagum is quoted in Eminent Bahá‟ís During
the Time of Bahá‟u‟lláh, pp. 216-17: “Do not expect any assistance from thy brothers. They will not help; it is
enough that they refrain from insults. Overlook their faults. Even Our enemies have not caused the like of what
resulted from the acts of Siyyid 118 in Isfahan. God grant that when the light of thine eyes Mírzá Áqá reacheth
maturity, he will be thy help and support. O God! Preserve him from all the evil of the envious and the
contumacious.” It should be noted that “118” is the numerical equivalent of Hasan. All evidence indicates that
Siyyid Hasan, the Afnán-i-Kabir, was never supportive of his sister, Khadíjih Bagum, or other family members.

Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s son

In a Tablet (Núri‟d-Dín‟s Collection, p. 91), Bahá‟u‟lláh revealed for Núri‟d-Dín: “The other matter
is that, at thy previous request, three verses were revealed and sent specially for the gravestone of the illustrious
exalted leaf, upon her rest the Most Glorious of the Glorious and the Most Exalted of the Exalted. Any of these
that thou consider to be in accord with wisdom and deem prudent may be engraved.”

illustrious maternal uncle of the Báb, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad). Áqá
Mírzá Abdu‟l-Vahhab (a son of the late Áqá Mírzá Aqa, son of the late Hájí
Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí) brought it to Shiraz when he returned from the
Holy Land through Bombay in 1327 A.H. [1909]. At present, it is in my
safe-keeping in the House of the Báb. When God‟s will decrees the time is
right, it will be placed on her grave.171

In summary, Siyyid `Alíy-i-Afnán grieved the wife of the Báb and prevented
her from attaining the presence of Bahá‟u‟lláh. With his parents and brother,
he traveled to the Holy Land through Mashhad, Russia [Ishqabad] and
Istanbul. When he arrived, he arranged the wedding ceremony, which took
place in the presence of Bahá‟u‟lláh.

On our [first] journey to the Holy Land [in 1891-2], the Afnán-i-Kabir was
still alive. Shortly after that, perhaps within only a few months of the
ascension of Bahá‟u‟lláh, he too passed away. Subsequently, Siyyid `Alí and
his brothers, Siyyid Mírzá172 and Siyyid Muhammad, who were in Bombay,
began to collaborate with Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí, [Mírzá] Majdu‟d-Din and
other brothers of `Abdu‟l-Bahá. They rose up fiercely to oppose Him. Using
various schemes and deceitful methods, they tried to cause division among
the friends. His brothers in India were particularly involved in undermining
the confidence of the believers by disseminating polemic papers.

This same Siyyid Mírzá had a son named `Abdu‟l-Husayn, who was my
first cousin on my mother‟s side. He lived in Yazd and was firm and
steadfast in the Divine Cause. He wrote to his father with great conviction,
“If you return to Yazd in this state, I will not accept you in my house and
will shun you!” During the days of the Ancient Beauty, Siyyid Mírzá had
observed, and knew about, the singular spiritual bond that connected
Bahá‟u‟lláh to His Center of the Covenant. He had witnessed the pilgrims
pleading with Bahá‟u‟lláh, “We have been deprived of beholding Your
blessed Countenance for several days,” and Him telling them, “When you
attain the presence of the Master, it is as though you have beheld My
Countenance.” On many occasions, Siyyid Mírzá had heard the Tongue of
Grandeur say, “The only Master is the Greatest Branch and all others dwell
beneath His shadow.” Siyyid Mírzá had been the recipient of infinite favors.
And yet, this same Siyyid Mírzá rose up to dispute with, and oppose,
`Abdu‟l-Bahá in the most vehement manner and caused tumultuous storms
in the Faith. With satanic schemes he would make his way into the
gatherings of the friends, acquaintances, Holy Family and other kinsmen
and deceive them for his own ends.

After hearing the news of the Covenant-breaking, the very first letter that
my father wrote to my brother and I contained certain glimpses of the evil

deeds they perpetrated during the days of the wife of the Báb. It gave us a
better idea of their activities. A section of this letter follows:

> Concerning Siyyid Mírzá and his schemes and aims, I am very
> familiar with the situation. In Bombay, I spent over 10 years, day and
> night, with him and never perceived him to be firm in the Faith of
> God. All his thoughts were focused on worldly matters.

> In one instance, he had received a sum of money from Hájí Siyyid
> `Alí-Akbar [Dahaji], and the two of us173 were discussing this
> situation with Hájí Muhammad-Ibrahim, the Muballigh174. The latter
> was speaking to him and offering friendly advice, “You must never
> use this money without the owner‟s permission, as this sum has been
> placed with you in trust. The best course is to deposit it in a bank and
> earn interest on it. This way, whenever Hájí Siyyid `Alí-Akbar asks
> for the principal to be returned, it is readily available. Otherwise, you
> ought to forget about this capital.” But Siyyid Mírzá roared back,
> “What are you saying?! We are the heirs to the Throne and
> Sovereignty of the Báb!” This ephemeral servant replied, “But the
> Báb detested you and disavowed any relation with you!”175 In no
> time, we were arguing heatedly and Hájí Muhammad-Ibrahim had to

> If you remember well, when His blessed Temple [Bahá‟u‟lláh] lived

> revealed in her honor by her illustrious Husband during His

Similarly, in a letter dated 1 Dhi‟l-Hajjih 1314 A.H. [3 May 1897], my
father wrote from Shiraz to my late brother Hájí Mírzá Buzurg and myself
in Port Said:

This suggests that early steps for the expulsion of Siyyid `Alí had been initiated by Bahá‟u‟lláh and
later confirmed during the ministry of `Abdu‟l-Bahá.

Third Pilgrimage: 1898

My late brother, Hájí Mírzá Buzúrg, and I [lived] in Cairo while our late
father remained in Shiraz. Months and days went by, each filled with
priceless, yet momentous and pregnant, events. A year and a half passed in
this way, from the time the goings of the believers to the Holy Land had
increased somewhat and the intensity of the calamities and upheavals had
subsided to some extent.

When petitions intended for the Holy Land were received, I immediately
submitted them to the presence of `Abdu‟l-Bahá. They were not delayed in
Port Said with Áqá Ahmad [Yazdi], as was done previously. The sun of the
Covenant and its life-giving rays shone very brightly, and these ephemeral
servants sent supplications to the blessed presence of the Master freqently
and also corresponded with each other. We also corresponded with the
honored [Siyyid Muhammad-Taqi] Manshadi and Áqá Rida [Qannad-i-
Shirazi]. Whenever supplications were received from our late father, these
were forwarded at once to the threshold of `Abdu‟l-Bahá as well.

Toward the beginning of 1316 A.H.181, we sought permission to attain His
Holy presence for a second time. Our request was readily accepted and we
were invited to the Holy Land. On this journey, we were accompanied by
the honored Shaykh Salman, who had been the courier of the Merciful, the
late `Alí Aqay-i-Khayyat [the tailor] Shirazi and several believers from
Sarvistan and Shiraz. There was also Áqá Mírzá `Inayatu‟llah Isfahani 182,
who I remember fondly, but I haven‟t known his whereabouts for many
years.

With incredible joy and felicity, we left Port Said. The extent of our bliss
none can fathom except God. He alone knows the profound heavenly
ecstasy that overwhelms the heart of pilgrims. In truth, you lose all
consciousness and find yourself in a flower-filled paradise of happiness,
intoxicated with the breezes of spirituality and fragrances of bliss – the very
thought of which is well nigh impossible.

We arrived in `Akká and beheld the Holy Land. When I attained the
presence of the Master, my unworthy eyes were illumined once more by the
beauty and divine radiance of the Center of the Covenant. My whole being

was spellbound by His sweet and soul-stirring melodies. By now, the tumult
of the Covenant-breakers had subsided somewhat and was not as evident as
it was before. The majestic station of `Abdu‟l-Bahá and His august
sovereignty had humbled the necks of the skeptics and reduced the evil of
the mischief-makers. Now, everyone, such as the Mufti183, the Qadi [the
judge] and other influential members of society, clearly saw how Mírzá
Muhammad-`Alí was enveloped in the wrath of God. No matter what he
planned, only he was caught in his web of intrigues. It was an amazing
scene and in no way comparable to our previous pilgrimage after the
ascension of Bahá‟u‟lláh. Then the violators of the Covenant associated
closely with the believers. Now there was a complete break and the
foundation of discord and division uprooted. Those here and there who had
tried to betray the Cause were now well known and it was clear to pilgrims
who they could associate with. `Abdu‟l-Bahá was devoting most of His time
to revealing Divine Verses and meeting with the friends.

One day in an afternoon, a large number of resident believers, pilgrims,
friends and non-Bahá‟ís were gathered in the biruni [the outer apartment] of
the Master‟s house. He was engaged in revealing the Lawh-i-Nuh-Sha‟n
[The Tablet of Nine Modes]. The Mufti of `Akká was sitting next to the
Master. He was a man of remarkable qualities. He had a pleasant nature and
was deeply devoted to `Abdu‟l-Bahá; he was sitting next to the Master. Next
to him was the Qadi of the city of `Akka, and seated after him was the
Mutasarrif184 of the city. The Master was busy revealing verses. His pen
moved extremely rapidly across the page. Meanwhile, He was conversing
with the Iranian believers in Persian, with the Mufti and the Qadi in Arabic
and with the Mutasarrif and several of the Pashas in Turkish. All the while
His pen never stopped moving. The divine spirit had enveloped the
atmosphere and anyone who ventured a question was favored with an
answer until that blessed Tablet was completed and `Abdu‟l-Bahá sat the
pen down.

Thereupon the Mufti implored the Master to read what He had written.
However, [`Abdu‟l-Bahá] responded, “Mufti Effendi, this letter is an answer
to a letter from one of My close friends. As such, it is not possible for Me to
comply with your request.” The Mufti asked for a second time and the
response was, “You are asking for a difficult thing.” Again, the Mufti
insisted, “All the dwellers on earth are close friends of the Effendi and Your
blessed Person considers them all in the same light.” The Master [still not
wishing to read the Tablet] answered, “But portions of what has been
written are in Persian, while other segments are in Turkish; not everyone

In Islamic law, the mufti is the trained jurist who writes opinions (fatwa) on legal subjects for
private clients, or assists judges in deciding cases. Only fatwas given in the areas of marriage, divorce and
inheritance make binding precedents. Fatwas on other subjects may be set aside. In the Ottoman Empire, the
muftis were state officials, responsible also for civil administration at a given level. The mufti of Istanbul was the
highest of these. The British retained the institution in some Muslim areas under their control. They gave the office
of Hussayni, the grand mufti of Jerusalem, great political importance.

The highest ranking provincial military commander.

will understand.” The Mufti replied, “The Qadi Effendi knows Turkish and
others speak Persian.” Eventually, he beseeched the Master in the name of
the Blessed Beauty and insisted so much that `Abdu‟l-Bahá consented and
read the first three Modes, which were revealed in Arabic. With extreme
humility, the Mufti asked the Master to continue and He recited the whole of
Tablet.

God knows that every time I think of that magnificent day, my entire being
trembles with wonder and joy. After `Abdu‟l-Bahá had finished reciting the
Tablet, the Mufti patted the Qadi on the hand, saying in Arabic, “Did you
understand? Did you understand? Do you now see that the Effendi‟s
knowledge is innate and ours is acquired? I have studied the science of
religious jurisprudence and the doctrines of faith and its laws at the Al-
Azhar University, which has allowed me to gain an ijtihad and I am now the
Mufti of `Akka. Likewise, you have studied in the various schools of
Istanbul and Egypt and acquired the advanced degrees bestowed upon you
by others learned in the field of law. And, after much exertion, you have
become the Qadi. The Mutasarrif Pasha also started as a soldier in the
service of the government, participating in many battles and campaigns.
Today, he has risen to the office of chief command and been confirmed as
the Mutasarrif of `Akka. As such, our attainments are acquired, whereas the
Effendi has never studied in a school, nor has He received tuition from
anyone. The knowledge He possesses is God-given and most extraordinary.
The source of His innate erudition is God and its origin the fount of the
invisible world.”

That day, we realized that the Qadi had been antagonistic towards the Faith
and that the Mufti was an honorable man and deeply devoted to `Abdu‟l-
Bahá. His purpose in being so bold in the presence of the Master had been
to impress upon the Qadi the innate character of the Master‟s knowledge.

In short, those were wonderful days. Previously, this same Mufti had taken
ill and was sent to Beirut for treatment. `Abdu‟l-Bahá wrote to Áqá
Muhammad-Mustafa Baghdadi185 urging him [to look after this man].
Baghdadi received the Mufti with the utmost compassion and consideration.
He housed him in his own home, arranged for all his medical treatment and
saw him through to a full recovery.

One morning, during the first days of our arrival in the Holy Land, the
Master called one of the resident believers and me, informing us, “This
morning I want to visit the Mufti, who has recently returned [to `Akka].” We
followed in attendance. `Abdu‟l-Bahá reached the entrance to the Mufti‟s
home and called out, “Mufti, where are you?” [The Mufti] immediately ran
out to throw himself in prostration at `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s feet. `Abdu‟l-Bahá

prevented the Muftí and, instead, raised him and kissed his face as He
entered the room. We followed inside as well. That day [as a sign of
respect,] the Muftí would not sit in the Master‟s presence and stood by the
threshold of the room.

After `Abdu‟l-Bahá insisted several times that he should sit, he finally sat on
a chair at the lowest part of the room [by the entrance]. Addressing those
present, the Muftí said, “Gentlemen of Haifa and `Akká! You have come to
visit me and inquire about my health. I have been granted a new life through
a favor bestowed on me by [`Abbás] Effendi. He wrote a few lines to one of
His subjects in Beirut asking him to accept me and care for me. As a result,
despite my being a total stranger and unknown to them, I was received by
that family with such warm hospitality. I have never experienced [anything
like it before], even at the hand of my own children and kinsmen!” In short,
it is impossible to describe his expressions of appreciation and gratitude and
the way that all those present showed humility and submissiveness before
the Master.

On another occasion, we were in the presence of `Abdu‟l-Bahá when one of
the Turkish Pashas arrived to visit Him as well. He spoke Persian in a sweet
manner and was very knowledgeable about Persian literature. He was also
profoundly devoted to the Master and loved Him dearly. As a token of his
affection, the Pasha said, “No words can adequately express our thanks to
the Iranian monarch, or the government, and the people of that land for
exiling with their own hands this priceless Treasure, the blessed Person [of
`Abdu‟l-Bahá], and sending Him to our land. What extraordinary bliss and
exhilaration has surrounded us and how truly we pride ourselves in this
stupendous blessing! As the Shaykh-i-Shirazi186 has written:

> The candle must be removed from home and extinguished,
> so neighbors remain unaware that thou art among us.”

`Abdu‟l-Bahá smiled and replied in verse:

In fear of rivals, quenching the candle is of what use?

when the radiance of thy beauty tells that thou art hither.

Surely, in whatever world the spirit of Sa`di is dwelling, he must have been
filled with pride and ecstasy!

Among the events that I remember vividly from this journey is the
following. One day, `Abdu‟l-Bahá spoke of His Holiness the Primal Point,
referring to the ways He conducted His business transactions as a merchant
and associated with people. He related:

A reference to Sa`di, one of the foremost literary figures in Iranian history.

> During the time that His Holiness the Exalted One lived in Bushihr
> and was in the trading business, a few merchants bought some
> Prussian blue dye from His blessed Person. When their negotiations

> in former days. When the transaction was concluded, the buyer
> would dismiss the contract and begin renegotiating, in order to get a

> how hard they tried, their plea was not accepted. The Báb told them,
> “I will arrange for the blue dye to be brought back from your office.”
> They replied, “But then our credit will be ruined among the merchant
> community!” “We have concluded the transaction and made a
> contract,” the Báb responded. “Whether the terms are favorable or
> disagreeable, you must now pay the full sum.” “But it is the custom
> of the realm,” they said. To which He replied, “Soon many of these
> ignoble customs will be changed.”

> The Báb did not give in and eventually the Prussian blue dyes were
> brought back to His office. After a while though, one of the uncles of
> the Báb arrived in Bushihr and the merchants complained to him,
> “Your Nephew has thoroughly ruined our credit and you must advise
> Him to be more considerate in dealing with us.” The uncle of the Báb
> reported the matter to the Latter, Who replied, “Even now, if they
> wanted to conclude an agreement and then abandon it, I would not
> agree to it.”

On that occasion, the blessed Person of `Abdu‟l-Bahá noted, “The ways of
His Holiness the Báb in Bushihr caused many of the old and sterile
traditions to be changed.”

`Abdu‟l-Bahá also related:

> One day in Baghdad, very early in the morning, Mullá Baqir, one of
> the Letters of the Living, attained the presence of Bahá‟u‟lláh. He
> asked him, “What were you doing last evening?” “I was reading the
> Ahsanu‟l-Qisas187,” he replied. Bahá‟u‟lláh queried further, “How
> much did you read?” and he replied, “I read several chapters of the
> Ahsanu‟l-Qisas.” Then He asked, “What did you understand [of it]?”

The Báb‟s Qayyumu‟l-Asma is a commentary on the Surih of Joseph of the Quran, where the story
of Joseph is referred to as the “Best of the Stories,” (Qur‟an 12:3). The commentary of the Báb is typically referred
to by the same title. The Báb. “Excerpts from the Qayyúmu‟l-Asmá‟” In Selections from the Writings of the Báb.

> In a state of extreme joy and ecstasy, Mulla Baqir whirled as mystics
> are wont to do, snapped his fingers in rapture and replied, “Every
> word announces, „I long for My Beloved!‟”188

That day the Master was extremely cheerful and happy and bestowed upon
us His infinite generosity and benevolence.

{One day my brother, Hájí Mírzá Buzurg, and I accompanied `Abdu‟l-Bahá
in His carriage from Haifa to `Akka. `Abdu‟l-Bahá sat in the front next to
the driver and we sat in the back of the carriage. It was raining gently and
the sea was turbulent. Occasionally, the drops of rain sprayed the carriage
and `Abdu‟l-Bahá was whispering this verse:

> Gentle sprinkles are joy for the drunkard,
> Divine absolution is bliss for the sinner.

A few strands of `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s hair had fallen on His blessed shoulders, so
I gathered them very gently from behind. Now they are kept in the Archives
of the House of the Báb in Shiraz.}189

On this trip, we were honored to stay for only a short time - perhaps two
weeks. When it was time for us to leave, `Abdu‟l-Bahá said, “I have
summoned your father and he will arrive soon. At that time, you will attain
Our presence once again, in his company. For now, return to Port Said and
keep working at your business.”

As instructed by the Master, we returned and continued our commercial
activities in Port Said and Cairo as before. Eventually, because of
accounting improprieties in the Ruhaniyyih Company190, `Abdu‟l-Bahá sent
a message [instructing us to] write to our father and tell him, “Your accounts
and business transactions have become entangled like a hairball. It is
imperative that you return in order to fix the problem.” In accordance with
the Master‟s direction, we wrote to Shiraz and told our father the exact
message of `Abdu‟l-Bahá. Along with it, we forwarded a Tablet revealed in
our father‟s name.191

The Báb had told Mulla Baqir that he would attain the presence of the Promised One of the Bayan.

For details of his historic mission on behalf of the Báb, see The Dawn-breakers, pp. 504-6. Tarikh Zuhuru‟l-Haqq
5:5 notes the following extract from a treatise of Mulla Baqir addressed to Yahya Azal: “His Holiness the Báb
placed all the Mirrors, Witnesses and believers under the command of the Letters of the Living. Therefore, you
and those like you, who claim the station of Mirrorship, must obey my behest. Now I testify and confess that the
promised „Him Whom God shall make manifest‟ in the Bayan and the One lauded in the Tablet revealed in my
honor has indeed been made manifest. Since I [received] that assurance from the Báb, I have attained unto His
august presence. And you too, as you are under my shadow, must recognize Him and believe in Him.”

The bracketed section is based on notes kept by Hasan Afnán. Mírzá Habíb intended for them to be
inserted at this point. (private communications, August 1991)

In a Tablet (INBMC 52:302-4, no. 345) to Núri‟d-Dín, `Abdu‟l-Bahá says that He reviewed the
accounts of the company and concluded that the partners had committed improprieties and owed money to Núri‟d-

arrangements for his landing and stay. He arrived with my mother, my
youngest and late brother, Mírzá Diya‟, and our sister, Tuba Khánum.
Without contacting his business partners, he instructed my brother, Hájí
Mírzá Buzurg, and I to establish a separate office in Port Said. Given that
we were thoroughly fluent in Arabic and Italian, we did not need any
assistance in seeing to the needs of the business.

Fourth Pilgrimage: 1898

After receiving permission from the presence of `Abdu‟l-Bahá, we left with
our father for the abode of the Beloved in the month of Jamádíyu‟l-Avval
[September 1898]. When we arrived, we attained `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s sacred
presence, and received His many favors and were showered with His love
and generosity. A house next to the Master‟s residence was prepared for our
stay and, each day, we were able to benefit from His blessed utterances.

The Remains of the Báb

One day, several elders among the resident believers were in the presence of
`Abdu‟l-Bahá when He informed us, “Certain [good] news has been
received from Iran. If divulged, the old would dance with joy. But the time
for its announcement has not yet arrived.” The illustrious Zaynu‟l-
Muqarrabin and the honored [Hájí] Mírzá Haydar-`Alí, who were present,
asked, “Is the time for proclaiming this good news near?” `Abdu‟l-Bahá
answered, “God willing.”

During the following week, `Abdu‟l-Bahá informed us, “The good news
that I had promised is this: the sacred remains of the Exalted Báb have
safely left the soil of Iran and just arrived in the Ottoman land. They are
now completely out of danger.194 After 50 years, what the Blessed Beauty
promised has come to pass. In gratitude for this most great divine blessing,
lives must be sacrificed! Soon will the effulgence of the Shrine of the Báb
attract the attention of the denizens of the world and the blessed prophecies
of Bahá‟u‟lláh will be clearly fulfilled.195”

On that occasion, `Abdul-Baha‟s blessed countenance beamed with joy and
excitement. Truly, all the friends were deeply affected by this radiance and
were in a state of utmost ecstasy and rapture. `Abdu‟l-Bahá spontaneously
and repeatedly kept reciting this verse:

Meeting with Siyyid `Alí

During this period, the violators of the Covenant were not quiet. From one
corner or another, each tried to spread intrigue through various means.
However, unlike the past, far fewer of the friends were gullible and taken in
by their vague promises and innuendoes.

Siyyid `Alíy-i-Afnán was informed of my father‟s arrival and sent a
message saying he wanted to visit him. After my father consulted with the
Master and received His permission, Siyyid `Alí came to visit. At the start of
the conversation, even before the customary exchange of pleasantries, he
launched into a complaint and began listing grievances against me. He said,
“Mírzá Habíb has acted presumptuously towards my brother, Siyyid Mírzá.
He has said to him, „Because of your actions, I have to cut off my relations
with you!‟ During his previous visits to the Holy Land, he has acted most
disrespectfully [towards me], as if I was his most determined enemy or had
committed a shameful act! Such base behaviors are the antithesis of the
Bahá‟í qualities we must possess. You must admonish him to stop this
contemptible conduct and these repulsive deeds. Bahá‟u‟lláh has stated,
„Henceforth everyone ... should refrain from ... whatever causeth sadness in
men.‟197 I also have a complaint against your own self. I have written
several letters and messages to you, and have forwarded a number of tablets
penned by the Ghusn-i-Akbar198, which have all gone unanswered.”

My father knew him and his family well. This was not only because they
were first cousins and had corresponded during the lifetime of Khadíjih
Bagum, but because for some ten years my father had been a business
partner of Siyyid Mírzá in Bombay. In addition, he was thoroughly familiar
with their recent deeds and Covenant-breaking activities. At the same time,
my father was extremely intense, law-abiding, and hot-tempered when it
came to the affairs of the Faith and its protection.

I noticed that my father‟s face was flushed with anger over this man‟s
hypocritical ways and I feared that, at any moment, they would end up in a
heated quarrel. Therefore, I intervened by gesturing for my father to remain

A decade later, in Naw-Ruz 1909, simultaneous with the interment of the remains of the Báb on
Mount Carmel, 19 believers were martyred in Nayriz and, as such, `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s prophecy that such a sacred act
required sacrifice came to pass. See In the Land of Refuge, Chapter 16.

calm. After [taking] a few minutes to compose himself, my father began to
answer him. First, he recited from memory the whole of the Will and
Testament of Bahá‟u‟lláh. Then he opened the Kitab-i-Aqdas and recited a
number of verses from it. He followed this with recollections of what he had
seen or heard during the days of Bahá‟u‟lláh. Siyyid `Alí confirmed all that
he heard, but would surreptitiously add, “There is no need for a mujtahid in
the Faith. God has rendered everyone capable of discernment.199”

When my father finished, Siyyid `Alí endeavored to expand on his own
false views. However, my father cut him short and interjected, “What you
have related concerning Habíb‟u‟llah‟s impoliteness towards Siyyid Mírzá
is unknown to me. As such, I have no opinion on the matter.” At this point, I
ventured to explain to my father: “One day in Egypt, Siyyid Mírzá came to
our office and asked after you. I did not reply and occupied myself with
some work. Several times he asked, „Where is my cousin?‟ „Whose cousin?‟
I finally replied contemptuously. „My cousin,‟ he said. I answered, „My
father is not your cousin, since your connection was spiritual and that bond
is now broken.‟ He started shouting, „My son `Abdu‟l-Husayn writes that
should I, as a violator of the Covenant, go to Yazd, he would not admit me
to his house.‟ I laughed and answered, „If truth be known, `Abdu‟l-Husayn
is not your son; his father is the Holy Spirit.‟ After that, I did not pay him
any further attention. This was the sum total of my rudeness towards him.200
And, as for not visiting Siyyid `Alí during my pilgrimages to the Holy Land,
in all my previous journeys, he lived in the Mansion [of Bahji] and was
always a close confidant and an intimate companion of Mírzá Muhammad-
`Alí. I, therefore, broke off all connection with him. Moreover, I cannot
fathom how it is that Áqá Siyyid `Alí is so intimately familiar with the verse
[of the Kitab-i-`Ahdi], „Henceforth everyone ... should refrain from slander,
abuse and whatever causeth sadness in men,‟ but has conveniently forgotten
the verse, „...turn your faces toward Him Whom God hath purposed, Who

A strategy of the Covenant-breakers was to undermine `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s station by suggesting that
Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s Texts were clear and everyone could adequately understand them without the need for an
authoritative interpreter. For a similar situation in Islam that led to divisions, see Chapter 2 above. It is also
referred to by `Abdu‟l-Bahá in the following Tablet (INBMC 52:304-5 no. 345): “In this day, should a person pay
attention to the insinuations of the doubters by a needle‟s eye, of a certainty he would fall, in such wise that there
would be no remedy. Among the sayings of such insidious people is their claim that, „One must return to the
Divine Verses and deduce for oneself.‟ By this they mean to suggest, „All are able to discern what they need and
no Interpreter is required.‟ Consider how their claim can truly weaken the Cause of God and how it will bring
about divisions and differences. Even though the Book of the divine Covenant is evident and the appointed
Interpreter stands manifest, yet such things are spoken. This manner of reasoning was first proposed by `Umar at
the time when the Messenger of God, may the spirit of all be a sacrifice unto Him, was on His death bed. He said,
„Bring me a pen and paper.‟ `Umar responded, „Do not give Him writing papers as He is delirious,‟ and then he
added, „Sufficient unto us is the Book of God.‟ Now that same saying of `Umar has been changed into, „God has
created all competent of discernment. Read the Writings.‟ By this they mean to imply, „Do not ask the Interpreter
and do not pay attention to His words. Seeking His good-pleasure and following His instructions and example are
not necessary. Be your own judge.‟ Their purpose is naught but to turn all against the Covenant and the
Testament.”

In a Tablet to Núri‟d-Dín (INBMC 52:307 no. 347), `Abdu‟l-Bahá speaks very critically about
Siyyid Mírzá and states that everything he has written should be considered lies and calumnies. He also says that
Siyyid Mírzá is beyond all guidance, admonishment or reasoning and such efforts are fruitless. He traces Siyyid
Mírzá‟s rebellion to the time of Bahá‟u‟lláh, when the Latter emphatically forbade him from using opium and yet
he refused to obey.

hath branched from this Ancient Root. The object of this sacred Verse is
none other except the Most Mighty Branch.‟201”

Addressing Siyyid `Alí, I further added, “Not only have we, who are
outwardly blood-relations, severed all ties with you, but rest assured that all
faithful believers and those remaining firm in the Covenant of God will do
likewise and disassociate from you. If you want to receive the same
consideration as before, then you must go before `Abdul-Baha‟s blessed
threshold and, with great sincerity and absolute truthfulness, repent [your
misdeeds]. You must seize the hem of His garment and implore His
forgiveness. If the Head of the Faith accepts you, then count us among your
lowliest servants. Otherwise, it is best for you to take your leave.”

My father never thought that I could speak with such force, vigor and
resolution. I said all that he had wanted to say, and he was elated and praised
[me] aloud, “Well said!” “He got his answer from me,” I replied. My father
went on to tell him, “Two years ago, the news of the Covenant-breaking of
Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí and others reached us in Shiraz through Mírzá
Habíbu‟llah and Mírzá Buzurg. Ever since, I have sent all your
communications, and those received from your comrades, unopened to the
presence of the Center of the Covenant. As soon as I saw that a particular
communication was from you or your associates, without even opening the
envelope, I would send it to the presence of the Master.”Siyyid `Alí grew
very agitated and apprehensive by this discussion. Now he could plainly see
that all his plans had come to nothing and had had no effect on us. My father
added further, “Mullá Husayn-`Alíy-i-Jahrumi202 had also written and I have
also destroyed his letter.”

This was our first and last meeting.

My late father related what happened to the presence of `Abdul-Baha. After
showering us with His infinite favors and kindness, He stated, “From this
one incident, you can well imagine the hardship and injuries heaped upon
me and calculate the extent to which I must be occupied watching over the
friends and how, day and night, I must see to their spiritual health and other
needs.”

The Company’s Finances

After a few days, `Abdu‟l-Bahá appointed several of the friends to assess
the accounts of our commercial enterprise [the Ruhaniyyih Company]. This
investigation committee included the honored Áqá Mírzá Hadi, Áqá Mírzá
Muhsin, Áqá Mírzá Mahmud-i-Kashi, Áqá Mírzá Husayn-i-Hájí and Hájí
Sayyid Javad. After this committee had studied and examined the

Tablets of Bahá‟u‟lláh, The Kitab-i-`Ahdi, p. 221

He lived in Bombay and was a contact for Mírzá Muhammad-`Alí and other Covenant-breakers.

company‟s accounts and books for a few days, it concluded that our partners
had embezzled our father‟s fortune and bankrupted his principal capital.

Through the late Muvaqqaru‟d-Dawlih, my father had already obtained an
official writ from the office of the Iranian Prime Minister, instructing the
Iranian ambassador in Istanbul to order its consulate in Egypt to arrest the
Yazdi brothers203 in Cairo. This arrest warrant, which was written in an
extremely strong and unusual tone, went on to say that, if the Consulate
could not evaluate all the business books in Egypt, it should immediately
send these partners to Iran by way of Bombay for [criminal] prosecution.

The esteemed believers in charge of the investigation sent the report with
their findings to the sacred presence of the Master. One day, very early in
the morning, `Abdu‟l-Bahá came to our house. After bestowing His
immense favors and infinite consideration upon us, He addressed my father,
“The gentlemen charged with investigating your accounts have completed
their task and forwarded their audit report. They have rendered their
decision thoroughly in your favor.204 What do you intend to do now?” My
father immediately replied, “I have no will of my own and am wholly
resigned to Your instructions. Whatever You order, I shall obey instantly.”
He then submitted the decree of the Iranian Prime Minister to the presence
of the Master.

`Abdu‟l-Bahá studied the royal writ. Putting His blessed hand on His
forehead, He stood there in deep thought for a full ten minutes. We were all
transfixed during His contemplation. He then lifted His blessed head and
addressed us aloud, “According to this writ, you can strip them of all their
possessions, but hearken to your qualities as an Afnán.”205 [In immediate
obedience,] my late father moved to burn all the papers right there in the
presence of `Abdu‟l-Bahá, when the Master sternly forbade him, saying, “If
you destroy these papers, then they can launch a counter suit. You must
preserve these papers.” In the presence of `Abdu‟l-Bahá, my father
immediately placed all the papers in a box and nailed it secure and
instructed that none of us were to ever open that box. At the present time all
the books and papers are preserved in the same way that were assembled in
the presence of `Abdu‟l-Bahá and my father never complained about the
misconduct of our business partners – not even to us, his own sons. He
further wrote separately to each of the former partners and assured them that
from that point he had relinquished all claims against them.

For a Yazdi family tree, see Yazdi, Ali M. Blessings Beyond Measure: Recollections of `Abdu‟l-
Bahá and Shoghi Effendi. Wilmette, Ill.: Bahá‟í Publishing Trust, 1988., p. xv.

In a Tablet (INBMC 52:303 no. 346), `Abdu‟l-Bahá confirms in writing that Núri‟d-Dín had been
wronged by his partners and that he was owed the principal plus interest.

`Abdu‟l-Bahá was urging Núri‟d-Dín to forego his claims and the criminal investigation against the
partners.

Return to Egypt

The abundance of the generosity of the Blessed Beauty and the infinite
benevolence of `Abdu‟l-Bahá has forever sustained these meek and helpless
souls. In the course of this journey, we were honored to remain in the Holy
Land for nearly a month and each day were graced with beholding the
countenance of the Beloved of all hearts, may my spirit be a sacrifice for
His favors, and were rendered joyous as we partook of His generosity and
loving-kindness.

After one month we were dismissed and commanded to proceed to Port Said
where we would start our business activities afresh.

Final Years in Egypt

In those days, we were thrilled every month to meet a group of pilgrims who
had returned from circumambulating the Most Sacred Court206. During that
period, `Abdu‟l-Bahá issued instructions that, under no circumstances, was
the Cause of God to be proclaimed or propagated in Egypt. The pilgrims
who came through Port Said were told when they arrived not to teach the
Cause and, if they were asked about the Faith, not to offer a response.

Ibrahim Effendi

We had become intimate friends with one of the natives of Port Said – an
extremely kind and spiritual man by the name of Ibrahim Effendi207. We
associated with each other freely and without any of the customary
ceremonies. On one occasion, a group of Yazdi and Hamadani pilgrims
arrived in Port Said on their way to the Holy Land and this group included
the honored Nush208. We had neglected to tell him [about the Master‟s
instructions] and that he was to conceal his destination.

One day, it so happened that Ibrahim Effendi was visiting us. With a few
Persian words he had recently learned, he ventured to ask about the purpose
of Jinab-i-Nush‟s visit. “Each month,” Ibrahim Effendi asked, “a large group
of Iranians arrive at Port Said and leave here for an unknown destination. A
month later, that same group returns and another one leaves in its stead.
Where do they come from and what is their destination, and why do they
wait in Port Said?” Without the least hesitation or effort to disguise his
purpose, the honored Nush began to teach him about the Faith. At this point,
I happened to enter the room and, realizing what was happening, motioned
the honored Nush to end the discussion. He immediately complied.

The Shrine of Bahá‟u‟lláh

He served in the Egyptian Custom Office as an inspector.

A renowned Bahá‟í teacher from a Zoroastrian background.

At this moment, Ibrahim Effendi turned around and saw me standing
[there]. As such, he was deeply agitated. With tears streaming down his
face, he protested, “Indeed, you do not have any consideration for our deep
bonds of friendship. You possess such wonderful news and do not divulge
any of it. And when another one begins to share this truth, you prevent him
from continuing.” I realized at that point that it was already too late and
hesitantly engaged him in a teaching discussion. After a few meetings, he
declared his belief in the blessed Faith and, consequently, became the first
native believer of Port Said. In a Tablet addressed to my late father, `Abdu‟l-
Bahá, may my life be a sacrifice for His gracious generosity, urged us to
show him every consideration.209

In short, this believer was greatly favored by `Abdu‟l-Bahá and, truth be
told, it was the honored Nush who taught him the Faith in the first instance.

After his recognition [of Bahá‟u‟lláh], Ibrahim Effendi became a celestial
source of light and inflamed with the fire of the love of God. When it came
to propagating the Word of God or proclaiming the Cause, he could never
stay still and, putting aside all caution, would teach at every opportunity that
presented itself. Although many a time he was advised to be more prudent in
his ways, he could never conceal what burned within his soul.

Praise be God, he eventually had a family and his children are firm in their
faith and have become staunch believers. His oldest son is the honored Dr.
Bashir, who I have heard is the chairman of the Local Spiritual Assembly of
Alexandria. I met his second son, Fadlu‟llah, sometime ago in Iran, where
he lived for a while.

The First Western Pilgrims

One of the important events that took place in those days was the arrival of
the first contingent of American and European friends. They arrived in Port
Said to go on pilgrimage to the Shrine of Bahá‟u‟lláh and attain the presence
of `Abdu‟l-Bahá. This happened in 1317 A.H. [1899]210. Nearly a month
before they arrived, my father received a Tablet revealed in his honor by
`Abdu‟l-Bahá, in which we were told the good news of the arrival of the
pilgrims from America. The Master instructed us to look after the needs of

`Abdu‟l-Bahá (INBMC 52:272-3, no. 322) mentions this in the following Tablet:The illustrious
Afnán of the sacred Lote-Tree, the distinguished offshoot Áqá Mírzá Aqa, upon him be the Glory of God, the
Most Glorious.He is God.The illustrious Afnán of the divine Lote-Tree! In accordance with the unconditioned
will: since the honored Ibrahim Effendi is among those who have newly entered the religion of God and have
arrived at the shore of the sea of oneness, his heart is illumined by the effulgence of Divine Guidance and his soul
verdant with the sweet fragrance of the paradise of the Lord‟s benevolence. Therefore, you are to use every means
possible to increase his faith and spirituality and to multiply the fire of the love of God in his bosom. To be sure,
you are to ensure that he is contented and grateful.May glory and luster, praise and salutations be upon him and his
kinsmen. Verily, he is remembered in the hearts of the Holy Household and other friends.`Abdu‟l-Bahá. In peace.

According to Stockman, Robert H. The Bahá‟í Faith in America. Vol. 1, Origins, 1892-1900.

Wilmette: Bahá‟í Publishing Trust, 1985, 36-57, the first group of pilgrims arrived in the opening months of 1899.
The year 1317 A.H. corresponds with May 1899 to April 1900.

these friends while [they were] in Port Said. In His blessed Tablet, `Abdul-
Baha enjoined upon my father, “The Western friends will arrive; provide
Eastern hospitality.”211 In a later Tablet, the Master wrote, “When the
American believers arrive in that realm, show them every consideration and
greet them lovingly on my behalf. `A `A.”212

In those days, Port Said was not developed much and there were no hotels.
Although there were a number of streets designed in square and
perpendicular fashion, very few houses had been built. Our residence was an
apartment on the second floor of a three-story building belonging to a Greek
man named Dimitri, who showed great respect towards my father. Our
business offices were on the first floor and we lived on the floor above
them. Dimitri and his wife lived on the third floor and, on the rooftop, there
were a few more rooms used mostly for storage and drying clothes. My
father asked me to meet with Dimitri and ask him to rent the rooftop rooms
for our use, so that we could let the western pilgrims occupy our own
apartment. I conveyed my father‟s inquiry to him. As soon as he understood
his request, he responded, “God forbid! My wife and I will move to those
rooms and your friends can stay in our apartment. And I will accept no
additional payment.” No matter how much I insisted, it did no good. I went
to my father with the story and he said, “This is all due to the sovereign will
of `Abdu‟l-Bahá, Who removes all obstacles.” He then went to Dimitri‟s
apartment and thanked him for his immense kindness.

We waited until the ship carrying the pilgrims arrived at the port. My father
instructed my two brothers and I, along with Áqá Nuru‟llah Isfahani, who
worked in our office at the time, to go and welcome the visitors.

When [they arrived and] we saw each other, the sound of “Allah-u-Abha”
was raised all throughout the Custom Office. And as we tenderly embraced
and kissed one another, tears of joy streamed from our eyes because this was
the first time that we had met Bahá‟ís from the western countries. They
numbered fifteen and came to our home.

The following is recorded in Ru‟yáháy-i-Sádiqih, p. 32 (compiled by Mihrangiz Khursrawi):In 1898

when the late Mírzá Aqay-i-Afnán, surnamed Núri‟d-Dín, was engaged in business in Port Said, he received a
cable from `Abdu‟l-Bahá, stating essentially, “Port Said. Nur. Western friends will arrive. Provide Eastern
hospitality.” This telegram confirmed for the honored Núri‟d-Dín a prediction of the Master made two years
earlier during His conversation with Hájí Muhammad-Isma`il-i-Yazdi. That is, two years earlier, `Abdu‟l-Bahá
one day humorously said to the Hájí, “I had a dream and you must interpret it for me.” The Hájí responded, “But
how am to interpret my Master‟s dream?” For the second time, in humor, `Abdu‟l-Bahá insisted that the Hájí was
to give the meaning of His dream, but the Hájí yet again kept his tongue. Thereupon, the Master related His
dream: “Last night the Ancient Beauty appeared in my dream and said, „I have guests that have never been here
before. I want you to receive them most befittingly.‟ I related Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s command to the Greatest Holy Leaf.
Together, we went to the storage [area] and retrieved the set of fine china that the Khal‟s son (that is, the honored
Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-`Alíy-i-Afnán) had sent from China and got it ready.” After jesting with the Hájí some
more, `Abdu‟l-Bahá explained the meaning of the vision: “The standard of the Faith has been raised in America. A
number in that country have embraced the Faith and will come here soon for pilgrimage to the Sacred Shrine of
Bahá‟u‟lláh. These friends have never outwardly been here and will now come and share in this blessing.”It was
only two years later that the Master‟s prophecy was fulfilled and the first group of American pilgrims, joined by
British and French Bahá‟ís, came by way of Europe to Palestine for Bahá‟í pilgrimage.

Postscript to the Tablet in INBMC 52:319 no. 356.

Without delay, my father telegraphed the Master informing Him of the
arrival of the [western] friends. `Abdu‟l-Bahá instructed that they be divided
in three groups of five. Each group was to leave for the Holy Land only
after the previous one had arrived back in Port Said.

I distinctly recall that, one day at lunchtime, Mrs. Lua Getsinger 213 (who
was accompanied on this journey by her husband, Dr. [Edward] Getsinger)
suddenly began to weep very loudly. We were amazed, and perplexed as to
what had caused her sadness and brought about this condition. After a few
minutes, with intense emotion, she said, “If, at every moment, we were to
offer a thousand thanks at the threshold of the Blessed Beauty, it would not
suffice. See how the promises of the Bible and the prophecies of the New
Testament and all other Holy Books of the Divine Messengers have come to
pass. Consider how it has enabled the cobra to play with the babe, sparrow
to dwell in the same nest as the hawk, and the bloodthirsty wolf to graze the
same pasture as the lamb.214 Where is the discerning eye and the hearing
ear? Consider how each of us is from a different race, religious background
or nationality. And yet, with utmost peace and affection, we have come
together under the shadow of God‟s Sacred Tree, dwell within the tabernacle
of unity raised by the Blessed Beauty and sit at the same table spread in the
name of oneness. I am from America and of Christian background, while
you are Iranian and of Jewish, Zoroastrian or Shi`ah backgrounds 215, and
still this Ibrahim Effendi is Egyptian and of Sunni descent. And consider
how, because of our divers backgrounds, we are supposed to be ready to
shed each other‟s blood and to try to destroy one another; and yet, the Word
of God has healed our hearts. This is none other than the miracle of the
teachings of Bahá‟u‟lláh and the result of His regenerative and life-giving
revelation.”

We spent many wonderful hours and days in the presence of these western
pilgrims until, eventually, the preparation for their journey was complete.
After their visit to the Holy Land, with spirits brimming with affection and
enamoured with love for the Master, they returned to Egypt. Truly, they
were made a new creation, each the essence of joy and felicity, yearning to
teach the Faith of God day and night. In such condition, they returned to
their homeland. Dr. Getsinger gave my father his own photograph, which is
now kept safe with my father‟s papers. Later they sent photographs taken in
the presence of the illustrious [Mírzá] Abu‟l-Fadl and Hájí `Abdu‟l-Karim-i-
Tihrani216.

For the Biblical prophecies, see the Book of Isaiah, chapter 11.

Parenthetically, Mírzá Habíb adds: “At that time, other Iranian and Indian pilgrims from Jewish and
Zoroastrian backgrounds were also present and were waiting for a sea vessel to take them to the Holy Land.”

At `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s instruction, he had gone to Chicago to encourage and deepen the believers.

One of the other ladies who came on pilgrimage was Miss Sarah Farmer,
with whom my brother, Hájí Mírzá Buzurg, remained in communication
over the years.217 I should note that, in addition to Miss Farmer, Hájí Mírzá
Buzurg was in constant contact with a number of other western friends until
the end of his life.

Several Tablets were revealed by `Abdu‟l-Bahá in honor of my father, Áqá
Mírzá Aqa, about meeting with the western believers. It was revealed,
“Concerning the other matter, the consideration you have shown to the
American visitors has brought immense joy and felicity to my heart. Naught
short of this is to be expected of your exalted station.”218 At the conclusion
of the same Tablet, the Master writes, “However, about your return to your
beloved land, I had wanted you to remain in these parts [that is, near to the
Holy Land] and for the affairs [of the Cause] to pivot round the desired
goals. In this way, you could shoulder some of `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s hardships,
even if you are in that region - much like your efforts during the visit of the
American ladies.”

Departure from Egypt

For two years, affairs passed in this way. During this time, certain
communications arrived from Shiraz that worried the Master and brought
concern to His pure heart. In a Tablet addressed to my father in Port Said,
`Abdu‟l-Bahá wrote:

> ... You had written regarding the blessed Threshold of the Sacred
> House [of the Báb] – may my soul be a sacrifice unto its dust. From
> the letters arriving here, we continually hear the supplication of that
> sacred city. Were I to expand on the details, it would surely bring
> sadness and sorrow to that honored person and be a source of

The following is the text of the first letter that Mírzá Buzurg received from Miss Farmer (private
communications from Abú‟l-Qásim Afnán, May 1992):Hotel Chateau-Durieux et des AnglaisAix-lex-Bains,
France July 24th, 1900 To: Mírzá Bozorg Afnán Dear Brother in the Truth:Your kind letter was most gladly
received. Miss Wilson and I both had desired to write and thank you for all the very generous way in which you
had received and cared for us, but we waited to learn first from you the address to which to send it – you
remember you promised it to us.When it did come, it found me recovering from a serious attack of Roman fever. I
am much better but am not permitted to write much yet. Consequently I have much time to think of you all and
pray for you, which I do constantly.God was so good to open the doors of His Holy Temple to us, to permit us to
come into the presence of our blessed Lord (Rouhi fedah) and to visit the Sacred Tomb that life itself will not be
long enough to pour forth our praise and thanksgiving. Miss Wilson and I spend our time reviewing the scenes
through which we have passed and the teaching which we have received, meanwhile studying the Old and New
Testaments and the Koran. It is a continual feast and we permit nothing to draw us away. We have the opportunity
also to unfold the Truth to hungry souls whom we meet, one, a Swedenborgian, confirmed it from the mouth of the
Swedish seer, who proclaimed that the next and the fullest revelation of God would be found in Persia and would
harmonize all that is true in all other scriptures.I could write for hours but must not. Keep on with your English. If
you desire it, I will help you by correspondence and point out any little mistakes which happen to come in. Miss
Wilson and I desire to be remembered to all the believers in Port Said, but especially to the dear mother and the
other members of your family. We shall never forget your loving-kindness to those who were strangers after the
flesh but who in the blessed Spirit are and always will be one with you! We rejoice in the inestimable privilege
you are all enjoying in the presence of our blessed Lord to whom be glory forever!With all good wishes,Your
sister in the Faith, Sarah J. Farmer

Several more Tablets on the same theme were revealed in honor of my late
father.220 Reading these over, my father realized that, to achieve `Abdu‟l-
Bahá‟s purpose, he would have to go to his native town in a hurry.
Therefore, he wrote about this proposal in a supplication to the Master. In it,
he asked whether [his plan] met with `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s good pleasure. If so,
he was ready to wind up all his business interests in Port Said and return to
Shiraz with his family.

This petition was looked on with favor. After the passing of two years, we
were once again permitted to visit the Holy Land and pay our respects.
Immediately, we closed our commercial office and ended all financial
transactions in Port Said. Our entire family traveled to the Holy Land.

Fifth Pilgrimage: 1901

After arriving in the Holy Land, we went [first] to pay our humble respects
at the Shrine of Bahá‟u‟lláh. The next day, the blessed Person of the Center
of the Covenant called our entire family into His presence. Having
showered us with His infinite blessings, He said, “It had been my earnest
wish for you to stay in this region and to see to affairs related to the Holy
Land. In particular, now that I am busy with the construction of the Shrine
of the Báb, I had intended for you to help me in every aspect of the raising
of this Sacred Edifice. However, as I think about it some more, I note [that
there are] certain difficult undertakings; that is, an important task and a
befitting service in Shiraz. Therefore, I have decided to send you there.
When you arrive in Shiraz, I will give you the complete instructions221. This
task entrusted to you is the most important of all services and worthy of the
greatest reward before the Divine Court. Truly, future kings and monarchs
will long to have been present on this day and been numbered among the
servants and attendants of that Sanctified Threshold.” He then proceeded to

this undertaking.

give instructions on the way to receive visitors and pilgrims at the House of
the Báb and how to conduct the management of its affairs. “Now is only the
emergence of the dawn of the Sun of Truth,” His blessed Person told us.
“Soon it will envelop the whole earth.”

Our pilgrimage lasted a total of 40 days. For us, the passage of those days
was agonizing and filled with anguish, because we knew that we were about
to leave for a far off land, which gave us no further opportunity to attain the
presence of the Master.

Among the gifts that we had the privilege of carrying to the presence of the
Master on this journey was a piece of marble that the honored Áqá Siyyid
Mustafa [Rumi] had sent from Rangoon in the care of my father, intended
for the Holy Land. This was a sample of the marble that the sarcophagus for
the blessed remains of the Primal Point was to be made from. One day,
while contemplating this marble specimen against the sunlight, `Abdu‟l-
Bahá said, “Observe how you can see the sun‟s rays through this stone. It is
the finest piece of stone excavated from the mine and purposed for this
sacred sarcophagus. In quality, it truly is peerless in the entire world.” The
late Mishkin-Qalam was present and entreated, “If it meets with the
Master‟s good pleasure and should He grant persmission, I will draw the
designs of the Greatest Name that would adorn this sarcophagus and present
them to Your august Self. And should You wish, I am prepared to journey to
India to arrange for them to be carved on the side of the sarcophagus.” In
accepting this request, `Abdu‟l-Bahá said humorously, “You want your
name to be preserved for as long as the earth and the heavens endure!” “It is
entirely possible,” Mishkin-Qalam responded, “if I am favored by the
Master‟s boundless grace.”

As proposed, this illustrious person prepared the calligraphic pieces and
signed each, “The servant of `Abdu‟l-Bahá, Mishkin-Qalam.” I was present
when he offered them to the Master. When He saw them, His blessed
countenance showed signs of deep indignation and, with great disapproval,
He addressed Mishkin-Qalam, “Who told you to sign them in such a way?! I
do not wish for anything to be written at all!” With tears pouring forth,
Mishkin-Qalam began to implore the Master. He took hold of the hem of
His garment and, with great fervor and intense wailing, begged forgiveness
for his misdeed. He sobbed and pleaded with much intensity until the ocean
of absolution of his compassionate Master was aroused and `Abdu‟l-Bahá
said, “If you sign your name in the same manner that you did during the
time of the Blessed Beauty, then I will accept.” Mishkin-Qalam complied
and changed his signature to “The servant of the Threshold of Bahá,
Mishkin-Qalam.”222

Throughout His ministry, `Abdu‟l-Bahá greatly disapproved of believers composing verses about, or
glorifying, His Person in any way. He would admonish them to focus their praise on Bahá‟u‟lláh.

In short, in those days, wonderful news about the immense victories of the
Faith throughout the world, the vast proclamations of the Cause in the East
and the West, as well as very pleasing reports from other corners of the
globe, were arriving constantly. Because of this, the heart of the beloved
Master was brimming with joy and signs of immense elation were evident
on His blessed face. At times, He would go to Mount Carmel and allow
some of the friends to accompany Him on such visits. The land for the
construction of the Shrine of the Báb, which was designated in the days of
the Blessed Beauty, was now purchased and the neighboring grounds had
also been acquired. The sacred remains [of the Báb] were also now in the
Holy Land. Even though the Covenant-breakers persisted in their evil-
plotting and mischief-making, and corresponded day and night with the
Ottoman Court in an attempt to pollute people‟s minds, by the divine favors,
the Cause of God was prevailing over all its adversaries.

Jamalu’d-Din-i-Afghani

In those days, Siyyid Jamalu‟d-Din-i-Afghani lived in Istanbul. From there,
he tried his best to extinguish the Cause of God because he believed that the
only obstacle in the way of achieving his evil-minded purpose was the
impenetrable fortress of the Faith of God. Therefore, in order to increase his
popularity and influence among the Shi`ahs and the Sunnis, and also to
attain his ultimate objectives, he rose up to create a situation designed to
uproot the Faith of God in Iran and the Ottoman realms.

One night, the beloved Master called Husayn-i-Aqay-i-Khadim [the
attendant] and instructed him, “Light the lantern a little later tonight as I
want to talk with the friends.” In those days, it was customary for a lantern
to be lit at night in the biruni [the outer apartment] of the house and His
blessed Person would meet with those of the town‟s inhabitants who wanted
to attain His presence and listen to His utterances. That night, He instructed
that the lantern be lit later so that non-Bahá‟ís would not be present [as He
wished to talk confidentially with the believers].

He told us, “Recently Siyyid Jamalu‟d-Din has announced that the Bahá‟í
Faith intends to destroy the foundation of the world and aims at obliterating
all religions. For instance, he has alleged that, „The religious beliefs of
Bahá‟ís and the teachings of Bahá‟u‟lláh are: the destruction of all Islamic
mosques, Jewish synagogues and Christian churches; the annihilation of the
Baytu‟l-Haram223 and the Baytu‟l-Muqaddas224; the burning of the Qur‟an
and the Bible; the eradication of all evidence of religious attainments; and to
dislodge the Qajar and the Ottoman dynasties. These are the ordinances of
their Books and the religious beliefs of Bahá‟ís.‟ He has further suggested,
„If you want to stop these things from happening and to ensure that none of

particularly sacred by Muslims.

these teachings is ever realised, then you must demolish `Akká, slay
`Abdu‟l-Bahá, Who is the Center of their Faith and the fount of their inner
confidence, and massacre all the Bahá‟ís, whether they live in Iran or the
Ottoman Empire.‟ Such are the intentions of this evil man.”225

`Abdu‟l-Bahá then added, “However, this man does not know that even if
`Akká is destroyed or `Abdu‟l-Bahá slain or Bahá‟ís martyred, he can never
extinguish the Faith of God. „Leave them to their inventions.‟226 Soon you
will witness how God deals with the tongue that has spoken in this way and
so dishonestly uttered such lies and slander.” Then `Abdu‟l-Bahá asked for
the lantern to be lit and for various people to attain His presence.
Subsequently, they were dismissed after having received their fill of His
bounties.

Not long after that, the veracity of `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s prediction about Siyyid
Jamalu‟d-Din was demonstrated. Of course, it is now common knowledge
that, in order to carry out his plans, Siyyid Jamalu‟d-Din went from Iran to
Istanbul and gathered around him a number of disciples. Sultan `Abdu‟l-
Hamid was disturbed and horrified by him and his partisans. He instructed
that a palace be assigned to him and arranged a haram, where [Afghani]
engaged in a life of luxury and indulgence. At the same time, the Siyyid
busied himself with making plans for sedition and revolt. However, a short
time after `Abdu‟l-Bahá spoke about him, a small growth appeared on the
Siyyid‟s tongue. The Sultan‟s special physician was sent to attend him. [In a
number of operations,] his tongue was cut several times until none was left
and, soon after, he died. This was the end of a person whose tongue had
spoken presumptuously towards the Cause of God and had committed such
slander and calumny against the Faith!227

Letters from Iran

On another occasion, while we were in the presence of the beloved Master,
the package of correspondence from Iran arrived. In it was a letter from
Yazd sent by the late Hájí Mírzá Mahmud-i-Afnán, the honored son of Hájí
Mírzá Muhammad-Taqi, the Vakilu‟l-Haqq. He had written two pages in
small script, all devoted to the excellence of the Jalalu‟d-Dawlih and his
very many services to the friends. [It mentioned] such things as his intention
to participate in the Feast in Mihdi-Abad228 and his profound humility and
submissiveness towards the Cause of God. `Abdu‟l-Bahá read the letter
closely, pondered for a moment, and then said, “Because of his pure heart,
the honored Afnán harbors no malice, is void of bitterness and radiates

Afghani‟s efforts to assault the Faith.

nothing but truth and spirituality. He imagines that the Jalalu‟d-Dawlih also
tells the truth. The Afnán conflates this man with his own self and is
unaware that the Qajars have no faith. The Jalalu‟d-Dawlih is a liar and
merely wants to use the Afnán and the believers for his own purposes.”

`Abdu‟l-Bahá then opened another envelope that contained only a blank
piece of paper. The beloved Master smiled and said, “The servants want to
test us. Woe betide them of the day when God decides to test His servants!”
Immediately, He picked up the pen and revealed a Tablet on that very same
paper and sent it back by the post. This piece of paper was sent by Áqá
Siyyid Muhammad-Sadiq, the husband of Fa‟izih Khánum. As a result of
many teaching discussions, he had decided to formulate a number of
questions in his own heart and to send a blank piece of paper before
`Abdu‟l-Bahá. He had resolved that, if the Master answered his heart‟s
questions on that very same paper, then he would recognize the truth of the
Faith and accept it. Finally, when this Tablet arrived, his questions were
answered and he attained the shore of certitude.

Return to Port Said

I am at a loss to know what else to write about our time [in the Holy Land]
until the beloved Master sent us to Iran. To this day, whenever I think of that
time, I am stirred with profound emotions and reduced to bittersweet tears.

Eventually, for yet a second time, `Abdu‟l-Bahá bestowed His
immeasurable favors upon us and admonished us in this way, “Prepare
yourselves for the services and mighty tasks that lie ahead of you. God
willing, they will be accomplished through your perseverance.” This
promise of the Master was the consolation of our heart. That is, if we were
to be outwardly deprived of the unfathomable grace of beholding His
blessed countenance and could no longer visit the sacred places of the Holy
Land, praise be unto God, we were propelled forward, instead, with His life-
regenerating promise!

After bidding farewell to our friends in Haifa, we went directly to Port Said.
We completed the remainder of our commercial activities and left for Shiraz
soon after.

Restoration of the House of the Báb

It was now over ten years since we had last seen Iran. Clad in Arab clothes,
we may even have been more fluent in the Arabic language than in Persian.
We arrived in Bushihr first, then traveled to Shiraz with a caravan led by
one of my late father‟s assistants. When we arrived, we went directly to the
House of the Báb. After visiting that Holy Threshold, my late father
designated his ancestral home - situated next to the Masjid-i-Jami` and
blessed by the footsteps of the Exalted One - as the place for meeting the

friends. A steady stream of believers gathered to hear the good news of the
Holy Land. My late father spoke of the progress and victories of the Cause
of God in America, which brought great joy and delight to the friends.

During the first two years we were in Shiraz, two important incidents
happened that affected my late father. The first was that a rock was
deliberately hurled at his head from a rooftop, which injured him badly and
forced him to stay in bed for a long period of time. The second incident was
that he was badly stabbed in the foot one night as he was passing through
Shamshirgarha Street229. The injury never healed during the remainder of his
life. However, the confirmations of Abdu‟l-Baha poured out like spring
showers and he remained thoroughly fearless - nay, thankful - before all
adversaries and under all conditions and was completely resigned to His
good pleasure.

My brother and I resumed our trading business in Iranian carpets. In the
month of Rabí`u‟th-Thání, 1321 A.H. [July 1903], my late father was
honored with a Tablet from `Abdu‟l-Bahá. In it, he was asked to begin
rebuilding the House of the Báb in its original style. Therefore, it may be
helpful to document here a short history of the Blessed House of the Báb.
This will explain the reasons for the changes made to it previously, and the
efforts made during the Ministry of `Abdu‟l-Bahá to convert it back to its
original state, so that there will be no room for unwarranted speculation in
the future.

History of the Blessed House

The House of the Báb was an ancestral inheritance of Áqá Mírzá
Muhammad-Rida,230 the father of the illustrious Exalted One. The title for
this property was stolen, along with other goods and articles, from the house
of the late Áqá Mírzá Zaynu‟l-`Abidin, a brother-in-law of the Báb and my
paternal grandfather. The Báb grew up in this House until the passing of His
father, then He moved to the house of the martyred-uncle [Hájí Mírzá Siyyid
`Alí]. After His sojourn in Bushihr and pilgrimage to the `Atabat, the Báb
returned to Shiraz. He took up residence in this House and married His
mother‟s paternal cousin, Khadíjih Bagum. From this union, a child was
born by the name of Ahmad, who died in infancy.

The declaration of the Báb took place on 5 Jamadiu‟l-Avval 1260 A.H. [22
May 1844] in the upper chamber of this Blessed House. There the Báb
announced His mission for the first time, to Mulla Husayn-i-Bushrú‟í.231

The House of the Báb was located on this street.

Taherzadeh, Adib. Revelation of Bahá‟u‟lláh, Vol. 4, Mazra`ih & Bahjí 1877-92. Oxford: George
Ronald, 1987.,429 and Khándan-i-Afnán, p. 204, state that the Báb‟s father bought the House. However, the
family records show that it was an inheritance (Abú‟l-Qásim Afnán, private communications, September 1995).

At this point in the narrative, Mírzá Habíb notes: “Even though this might not be relevant, I would
like to relate a dream that the wife of the Báb had after she was married for only a short time.” He then relates a

After His declaration, the Báb left for Mecca. He performed the hajj
ceremony and proclaimed the divine Cause to the entire Islamic world, the
Sheriff of Mecca and others, and returned to Shiraz. The account of the
journey to His native town and His stay there is extensive. As instructed by
the beloved Guardian, this has been recorded in detail and is available
elsewhere.232

After arriving in Shiraz, the Báb at first took up residence in the house of
the illustrious uncle [Hájí Mírzá Siyyid `Alí]. Previously, the Letters of the
Living would gather there. Later, however, He moved to the Blessed House,
where He lived until the time of His departure for Isfahan.

The Governor-General of Shiraz had been told that a group of believers
regularly gathered in the House of the Báb. Therefore, one night, he sent to
the House `Abdu‟l-Hamid Khán, the Darughih, and Mir Mu`min-i-Iyzad-
khasti, with a few guardsmen and night prowlers. Mir Mu`min-i-Iyzad-
khasti was influential in government affairs and particularly antagonistic
and spiteful [towards the Cause].

Unannounced, this group entered the House from the rooftop at a time when
the Báb and His wife were resting inside and the mother of the Báb was
sleep in the courtyard.233 When these men entered, the Báb sent His wife to
His mother and both women went into the adjacent room where His
declaration had taken place. He asked `Abdu‟l-Hamid Khán, “Why have
you intruded into My House without prior notice?” The Darughih
responded, “The Governor has received reports that a group of men have
assembled in Your residence. Therefore, we were sent to investigate the
matter.” The Báb said, “Now that you are satisfied that no men are here, you
may leave and inform your superior.” The Darughih insisted on receiving a
bribe, but the Báb refused to give him one. The officer took the Báb‟s
cashmere shawl, cut it in half and took a half. Without allowing the Báb to
dress properly, he arrested Him and took Him to the residence of the
Governor-General. At dawn, however, the Báb was released from custody.
That night, His blessed Person spoke vehemently against the Governor, the
Darughih and the `ulamas, and with great power addressed the Governor
and his men as ignorant and apostates.

Here I will include a small section of a letter from Hájí Mírzá Abú‟l-Qásim-
i-Afnán, a brother-in-law of the Báb, to the Khal-i-Akbar234, which gives an

dream that indicated Khadíjih Bagum would be with the Báb for only two-and-a-half years. Since this dream
appears in In the Land of Refuge, Chapter 2, and Rabbani, “The Báb in Shiraz”, it is not included here.

See In the Land of Refuge, chapters 1-4, and Rabbani, “The Báb in Shiraz”.

To enjoy the night breeze of the summer months, many Iranian families sleep outdoors under
mosquito nets.

outline of that eventful night [11 September 1846]. The letter is dated 20
Ramadan 1262 A.H. [11 September 1846]:

This letter makes it clear that the Báb was arrested on the night before this letter was written;
namely, on the evening of 10 September 1846. On the authority of Tarikh-i-Jadid, The Dawn-breakers, p. 195 n.1,
incorrectly placed this event on 23 September 1845.

The Dawn-breakers, p. 195, states the house of the Báb‟s uncle was targeted for this attack.
However, this document shows that the Báb was at His own residence when He was arrested.

It is believed that the Imam Husayn was slain by Shimr ibn Dhu‟l-Jawshan on the plain of Karbala.

I have no inclination to write anything further.

[Dated] 20 Ramadán 1262 A.H.

Because of the great transgressions committed by `Abdu‟l-Hamid Khán, the
Báb cursed him and eventually he was killed, [dying] from a cut in the
stomach. It was the same `Abdu‟l-Hamid Khán who, on instruction from the
Governor, Husayn Khán-i-Ajudan-Bashi, imprisoned the Báb in his house.
When the cholera epidemic was spreading in the city and his two sons fell
ill, `Abdu‟l-Hamid Khán‟s wife was convinced that her sons‟ illness was
caused by her husband‟s cruel and unjust treatment of the Báb. She forced
him to release his illustrious Prisoner. Upon freeing Him, the Darughih
pleaded for the life of his sons. The Báb prayed for them and gave [him] a
sweet pomegranate that he had with Him, with this instruction, “Give this to
them and I will pray for their recovery.” At last, the Báb returned home from
the house of `Abdu‟l-Hamid Khán and subsequently left for Isfahan.

After the Báb left Shiraz, His wife, mother, and maternal grandmother, a
black servant named Mubarak, and a black maidservant named Fiddih were
living in the Sacred House.238 When the news of the martyrdom of the Báb
reached Shiraz, Fatimah Bagum, the mother of the Báb, having previously
consulted with her Son about the journey to the `Atabat, decided to leave
Shiraz. She wanted to put behind her the constant barrage of insults aimed at
her family by the city‟s divines. Before she left, it was decided that Khadíjih

Bagum would live with her half-sister in the house of the martyred-uncle of
the Báb and the Blessed House be entrusted to Mírzá Muhammad-Husayn-i-
Bazzaz, son of Mírzá Asadu‟llah. He was not a believer in the Báb but a
native of Shiraz and a close acquaintance of the family. This [decision]
ushered in a period where the House was in the hands of non-believers.239
Gradually, two brothers, Samad and Ibrahim, took over all the affairs of the
House and claimed sole ownership.

At the time when my late father reached the age of maturity, he was deeply
saddened over this matter and appealed to Khal-i-Akbar, “You are the
closest relative of His Holiness the Báb and, therefore, have responsibilities
towards this House. You must try to extricate the House from the grasp of
non-believers, who currently occupy it.”240 “I can‟t do it now,” the
illustrious Khal-i-Akbar replied, “since all my sons are engaged in
commerce elsewhere. However, you have my permission to take all the
necessary steps to resolve this situation as you see fit.”
My father took advantage of his influence and prestige241 and, during his
conversations with the tenants, said, “As you know, this House has belonged
to the infidels and non-believers and, as such, your prayer offerings will not
be accepted from such a place. In addition, because of the recent
earthquakes, some parts of the House have been structurally damaged,
making it unsuitable to live in. Indeed, it is life threatening. Should you
agree, we are willing to purchase or lease another house in your name and
you can stay there while we renovate this one. When we have completed the
repairs, if you still prefer to live here, we will abide by your decision.” The
tenants saw the opportunity to become homeowners and agreed immediately

Abú‟l-Qásim Afnán notes the following in “Baytu‟llahu‟l-Akram”, p. 19: A year after Fatimih
Bagum left, a severe earthquake destroyed many homes and buildings in Shiraz, killing a third of the population
and forcing a vast multitude to live in the fields and wilderness and dwell in tents or makeshift camps.
[Farsnamih-i-Nasiri, vol. 1, reports that this massive destruction took place on the night of 25 Rajab 1269 A.H./4
May 1853. It destroyed many homes and killed several thousand citizens. It also demolished the majority of the
schools and mosques, including the one next to the House of the Báb. Translator. Fasa‟i, Hasan ibn Hasan. Tarikh-
i-Farsnamih-i-Nasiri. Tehran: Intisharat-i Kitabkhanah-i Nisa‟i, 1312-1314 [1895-1897]). Two volumes.] During
this incident, the House of the Báb was severely damaged and the mosque next to it was completely demolished.
Khal-i-Akbar came to Shiraz from Bushihr to look after the family‟s interests and business. One action he took
was to secure a written lease from Mírzá Muhammad-Husayn, who was occupying the House with no written
documentation. This lease is dated Rabí`u‟l-Thání 1270 A.H./January 1854 and reads: In the presence of the
esteemed Mírzá Muhammad-Husayn, son of the late Mírzá Asadu‟llah-i-Shirazi, it is known and rightly recorded
that the house located in the Kuchih-i-Shamshirgarha belongs in its totality to Siyyidih Fatimih Bagum, daughter
of the late Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Husayn. This residence was entrusted to the aforementioned Mírzá to dwell
there upon her [Fatimih Bagum‟s] departure from Shiraz. Since an earthquake has caused considerable damage
and the tenant wishes to make certain repairs, he is permitted to do so at his own expense. This will not be
reimbursed by the owner, who may claim possession of the residence at any time with due notice.This legal
document was signed and witnessed by the appropriate jurists and Shaykh Abu-Turab, the Imam-Jum`ih of Shiraz.
After this document was signed, Mírzá Muhammad-Husayn realized the cost of the repairs was prohibitive.
Consequently, he leased the House to two brothers, Samad and Ibrahim, who were bakers. They took up residence
with no formal documentation. Afnán, Abú‟l-Qásim; “Baytu‟llah-i-Akram”, `Andalib, pp 16-27.

Abú‟l-Qásim Afnán suggests that Núri‟d-Dín‟s interest in the security and renovation of the Blessed
House stemmed from his reading in the Persian Bayan about the supreme station of this Dwelling; see
“Baytu‟llahu‟l-Akram”, p. 20.

At that time, Núri‟d-Dín‟s father, Mírzá Zaynu‟l-`Abidin, was alive. He was closely related to two
prominent clerics, Mírzáy-i-Shirazi and Áqá Siyyid Javad-i-Shirazi, the Imam-Jum`ih of Kirman, and enjoyed
great influence with the divines of the city.

to the arrangement. Quickly, a house was leased for 100 tumans and the two
brothers moved there.242

In this way, the House of the Báb was recovered from the hands of non-
believers. After some minor repairs, a believer named `Abdu‟r-Razzaq lived
there for three years. After him, it was occupied by the late Hájí Abu‟l-
Hasan [Bazzaz], who had accompanied the Báb on His hajj journey to
Mecca and was one of the first believers of Shiraz.243 Afterwards, the House
was leased to Mulla Áqá Buzurg-i-Zarqani, who was a Bábí but not known
as one.244

During this period, Shiraz sustained a number of severe earthquakes, which
destroyed many homes and public buildings that had not been damaged
previously. Many people were forced to take refuge in the city‟s outskirts
and live in tents.

The First Renovation of the House of the Báb – 1289 A.H. [1871]

During Dhi‟l-Qa`dih 1288 A.H. [January 1872], Munirih Khánum, who was
travelling to the Holy Land to marry `Abdu‟l-Bahá, arrived in Shiraz from
Isfahan. During her 15-day sojourn, she stayed in the house of the martyred-
uncle, where the wife of the Báb was living [with her maternal sister,
Hájíyyih Bibi Jan-jan]. During her stay, Munirih Khánum was a constant
companion of Khadíjih Bagum and the two were always in each other‟s
company.

One day, during their conversation, the wife of the Báb asked her guest to
supplicate on her behalf at the Threshold of Bahá‟u‟lláh for permission to
renovate the Blessed House so that she could transfer her residence to that
sacred location. This request found ready approval in the presence of the
Blessed Perfection. He asked my father to restore the House in whatever
manner that Khadíjih Bagum saw fit.

After Bahá‟u‟lláh gave permission to renovate the House of the Báb in
accordance with Khadíjih Bagum‟s wishes, she instructed her nephew (my
father), “If the House is renovated in its original style, the memories of the
days of His Holiness and my profound sadness over His loss will prevent

According to A.Q. Afnán, this house was located on Zanburak-Khánih Street; see “Baytu‟llahu‟l-
Akram”, p. 20.

Although Hájí Abu‟l-Hasan had accompanied the Báb on His pilgrimage journey and observed all
the events of that voyage, it was the proclamation of the Báb at Masjid-i-Vakil that finally convinced him of the
truth of the new Dispensation. Hájí Abu‟l-Hasan lived in the House of the Báb with his wife and two sons, Mírzá
Muhammad-`Alí and Mírzá Muhammad-Baqir, who later adopted the surname Dihqan. His wife was a relative of
the Imam-Jum`ih Abu-Turab and, consequently, the family enjoyed some measure of protection. After five years
of living in the Blessed House, his wife passed away and the protection of the `ulama was withdrawn. Because he
was known as a Bábí, Hájí Abu‟l-Hasan was forced to leave the city in the middle of the night, taking his two
young sons with him. See “Baytu‟llahu‟l-Akram”, p. 20.

With Zarqani‟s departure, in January 1872 a mother and daughter of Nayriz, who were brought as
captives to Shiraz after the battles of 1853, occupied the House in order to preserve it. They remained there until
1289 A.H./1872. See “Baytu‟llahu‟l-Akram”, p. 20.

me from ever living there. Certain changes must be made to the House.”
Therefore, substantial changes were made to the structure of the House.
These included making two of the rooms part of the expanded courtyard and
moving the small pool. {The initial cost of this reconstruction was met by
Bahá‟u‟lláh.

To protect the House further, a small house next to it on the eastern wall was
bought. It belonged to a certain Hájí Muhammad-Ja`far-i-H.adíd. The elders
of the Afnán family asked Hájí Mírzá `Abdu‟l-Hamid to live there. He was
one of the early believers in the Báb and married to the daughter of Hujjat-i-
Zanjani. From the first day Hujjat‟s daughter arrived in Shiraz, she was a
close companion of Khadíjih Bagum, who had a particular affinity for the
families of the Bábí martyrs. An underground passageway was constructed
connecting the two homes. It was used as the main entrance for the House of
the Báb so that the neighborhood would not take notice of the occupants.}245

After these changes [were made], the esteemed Khadíjih Bagum took up
residence in the Blessed House. She lived there for the next nine years, until
her noble soul took her flight to the immortal abode in the month of Dhi‟l-
Hajjih, 1299 A.H. [October 1882].

After her ascension, as instructed by Bahá‟u‟lláh, her sister, Zahra Bagum,
moved her residence to the Sanctified House. She lived there until her

The Custodianship of the House of the Báb

In the year 1302 A.H. [1884], the following instructions were issued for the
custodianship of the House of the Báb from the heaven of Divine Will,
exalted be His utterance, in honor of the wife of the Báb, her sister and her
descendants. In this way, solely by divine grace, this honor was placed upon
them:

> This honor and benevolence hath been bestowed upon the ukht246
> and her descendants, from her Lord, the Merciful. He is the
> Munificent and the Compassionate, and He is the Generous and the
> Bounteous.247

Akram” article.

Lit. sister. It refers to Zahra Bagum, the sister of Khadíjih Bagum.

A Tablet of Bahá‟u‟lláh revealed in 1292 A.H./1875, which bears His seal reads: “The custodianship
of the Blessed House has been granted to the exalted leaf, the wife of the Primal Point, and her sister, upon both be
My Glory of God, My Bounty and My Favor. Before God, we have conferred this custodianship on the House and
thus have We adorned it with Our Benevolence, and arrayed Our command with the evidence of His Might and
Compassion. Solely on the ukht [Zahrá Bagum] and her issue has this honor and favor been bestowed from the
heaven of the Lord, the Giver, the Compassionate, the Bestower, the Forgiver, the Merciful.”

Years passed and the House of the Báb was left as described above. When
Zahra Bagum passed away, my mother [Maryam Sultan Bagum], two
brothers, sister and I left for pilgrimage to the Holy Land and reunion with
my father in Port Said. We had not seen him since 1296 A.H. [1879]. The
details of this visit have been recorded earlier.

During my father‟s stay in Port Said, he was honored to receive several
Tablets from the beloved Master that spoke about the importance of the
friends visiting the Blessed House of the Báb under all conditions and the
harm [that would result] if this was neglected. One such Tablet addressed to
him said in part:

> Port Said. The illustrious Afnán of the Sacred Lote-Tree, Áqá Mírzá
> Áqá, upon him rest the Glory of God, the Most Glorious.

> ... You wrote about the Eminent House and the Point of Adoration of
> the world, may my life be a sacrifice unto its dust. This issue is most
> important; nay, it stands as the most momentous of all matters.
> According to your letter, it is currently impossible for people to visit
> the House. This is surely a source of great sorrow for the faithful
> friends and those who long to circumambulate the Blessed House.

> Certainly, in whatever way possible, a way must be found for some
> of the friends to occasionally gain access [to the House] and at least
> be able to visit that Spot. Otherwise, neglecting to visit will become a
> norm and the sacredness of this act will be diminished. The friends
> who live in Shiraz must consider it absolutely obligatory and binding
> to visit the House at least once a month. If this servant lived in the
> province of Fars, assuredly he would circumambulate that Sanctified
> House once a week, even if the enemies rained blows of stones upon
> him.248

> You are the protector and custodian of this House and must make
> every effort in this important matter.

> Upon thee be the Glory of God.

`Abdu‟l-Bahá, `Abbas.249

Eventually, in 1319 A.H. [1901], as asked by `Abdu‟l-Bahá, my parents,
brothers and sister and I left for Shiraz. At the time we left the Holy Land,
His blessed Person said to us, “You have been sent to Shiraz for the most
important of all duties. I pray that you will be effective in carrying out this
responsibility.” However, the Master did not divulge the nature of the
entrusted task and our sole wish was that, whatever the duty, we would be

In a Tablet (INBMC 52:300 no. 344), the Master instructs Núri‟d-Dín to make a complete and
befitting visit to the House of the Báb once a year on `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s behalf.

able to carry out His wish and win His good pleasure. Things passed in this
way until 1321 A.H. [1903].

The Second Renovation of the House of the Báb – 1321 A.H. [1903]

Iran was in disarray and immersed in turmoil. In the face of sustained
persecution and unrelenting oppression, the Bahá‟ís of Isfahan had taken
refuge in the Russian Consulate. In Yazd and its environs, the believers were
martyred and those who survived were forced to flee to far away lands. 250
Shiraz was also in disorder and the friends were despondent and distressed
over the fate of their brethren and the gloomy news reaching them from
other sectors.

At this time, a Tablet was revealed by `Abdul-Baha in honor of my late
father. In it, he gave instructions to rebuild the House of the Báb according
to its original structure and design, without a moment‟s delay. The following
week, a second Tablet on this matter was received from the pen of the
Center of the Covenant and, the following week, yet another Tablet was
received that further admonished: “Not a moment of lassitude must be
allowed, since a delay will cause a colossal catastrophe.” In this Tablet,
`Abdu‟l-Bahá sternly ordered:

> The Blessed House of the Exalted One must be restored without a
> hair‟s breadth change from its original form, and this must be carried
> out with absolute cleanliness, elegance, delicacy and firmness.251

In one of these Tablets, the Master gave explicit instructions concerning the
speedy renovation of the Blessed House of the Báb:

> Although at present the horizon of the world of humanity is darkened
> with turmoil, its foundation shaken to its core, the portals of hardship
> and trials are flung wide open, and the tempests of trials and
> difficulties are everywhere, it is in such a state of tumult that the
> reconstruction of the renowned House must be carried out, as it will
> bring joy and comfort to every desolate heart.252

Having received these sacred Tablets, my father asked me to gather some
prominent friends on his behalf. I invited a number to the House of the Báb,
including such people as Prince Mu‟ayyadu‟s-Saltanih, the late
Muvaqqaru‟d-Dawlih, Mírzá Muhammad-Baqir Khán-i-Dihqan, the
Bashiru‟s-Sultan, Áqá Siyyid Husayn-i-Afnán, `Andalib, Mírzá Aqay-i-
Mi`mar-Bashi and Mírzá Aqay-i-Afnán. However, when they heard the

Tablets of `Abdu‟l-Bahá, each of the assembled notables voiced his concern
that the reconstruction of the House was an untimely endeavor, particularly
during such a turbulent period. After considering their views, my father
responded, “The Head of the Faith has issued a command to rebuild the
House of the Báb without a moment‟s delay. Surely, there is wisdom hidden
in this instruction that is not currently clear to us and we don‟t understand its
insight. I have not invited you to consult on the matter, as the Master‟s wish
is clear and no one can speak contrary to His will or even question its
advisability. We are subjects and He is our lord. I have invited you to hear
the sacred Tablets that have recently been received and to tell you that I plan
to start construction immediately. I only wanted you to know about the
situation.” When everyone heard him speak in this way, they readily agreed
with his views.

With `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s confirmations, on Saturday253, 5 Jamadu‟l-Avval 1321
A.H. [20 July 1903]254, the late Mi`mar-Bashi began the renovation project.
He was one of the most devoted believers and the love of the Faith burned
brightly in his bosom. My late father supervised every step.

At first, they demolished the whole structure. My father was present during
the first reconstruction and had supervised the work. Therefore, he knew the
original architecture of the House. He instructed that the ground under the
building be excavated until the original foundation of the House was
uncovered. The workers began to raise the walls and rebuild the House on
the same foundation and following the original design. Each day, in this
small area, over 30 construction crew labored devotedly. Within two
months, as `Abdu‟l-Bahá had commanded, the structural walls were
completed in exactly the same design as that of the time of the Báb. Soon
the rooms were finished and the doors and windows added, much as it was
in the old days.

At the beginning of Sha`ban [23 October 1903], my father fell ill and, day
by day, his condition grew worse. However, until a week before his passing,
he would come each day to the site of the construction and, although
suffering from illness, spend the day supervising all the work. He passed
away on 24 Sha`ban 1321 A.H. [15 November 1903] after completing the
task entrusted to him by `Abdu‟l-Bahá. It was then that the wisdom of the
Master‟s statement “delay will cause a colossal catastrophe” became clear,
as my father was the only one of all the kindred who knew the original
design of the House. After his passing, the rest of the work, consisting of
painting and decoration, was completed.

According to the calendars available to the translator, 5 Jamadi 1321 A.H. fell on a Thursday.

This day corresponded with the anniversary of the Declaration of the Báb.

Renovation of the Adjacent Mosque

A mosque is located next to the House of the Báb. Originally, it was a
Jewish synagogue. Later, it was converted to a mosque named Khizr, and
now it is known as Masjid-i-Shamshirgarha. After the Muslims took
possession of the property and converted it into a mosque, the Báb would,
before His Declaration, frequently visit this Masjid and perform His
obligatory prayers. However, because of severe earthquakes, the building
sustained serious damage. By this time, it had become a site where the
neighborhood deposited its waste and where thieves, after having robbed
people‟s homes, would hide and rest most evenings. During my late father‟s
time, he blocked the entrance to the mosque and the neighborhood
protested, “It is not appropriate to block the entrance to a mosque.” To that
my father replied, “My home and possessions are otherwise at the mercy of
thieves roaming this ruined building.”

During that time, a Tablet255 was revealed in honor of my late father. It
contained important directions about this mosque. A section of this exalted
Tablet reads:

> ...You wrote that the renovation of the House [of the Báb] might
> produce a great tumult. Indeed, the illustrious Áqá Mírzá Aqay-i-
> Afnán, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, pointed
> out that the provinces of Fars and Yazd have sustained multiple
> calamities. Concerning this, he has beseeched prayers at the Holy
> Shrine of Bahá‟u‟lláh.

> The purpose of this servant was to alleviate these trials in order to
> further promote the Cause of God and proclaim the Word of the
> Almighty. Therefore, I accepted the [financial] obligations of this
> important task so that, once the House [of the Báb] is renovated and
> the Point of Adoration of the jewels of creation is rebuilt, these
> calamities would completely disappear. Until now, no other in any
> past Age has so readily and manifestly pledged such a commitment.
> The intention was to fulfill the divine proof and reveal the honor and
> excellence of that sacred and mighty House. Now that the people of
> rancor have incited rebellion, wisdom must be observed.

> As such, a plan must be found to reduce and decrease the persecution
> so that, God forbid, these difficulties do not continue. Indeed, that
> design is this: it must be said that a holy person who is
> knowledgeable in the science of Jifr-i-Jámi`256 has calculated that,
> when the ruined mosque is renovated, these persistent calamities will

While Mírzá Habíb was in Egypt, `Abdu‟l-Bahá wrote to his father in Shiraz about the importance
of rebuilding the adjacent mosque and how this would alleviate the trails and tribulations besetting the inhabitants
of Fars; see INBMC 52:288 no. 339.

My late father never had the opportunity to renovate this mosque. It was not
until after the hallowed House of the Báb was completely restored and its
true majesty and exquisite beauty laid bare that the Muslim neighbors
thought to themselves, “Though there is only a few of them, the Bahá‟ís
have built their Temple258; and yet, we are so wanting in commitment to our
Faith that we have allowed our mosque to become ruins!” Consequently,
they assembled and sought the advice and involvement of Mírzá Ibrahim-i-
Mahallati, a very influential cleric and a prominent mujtahid. They said to
him, “This mosque is surrounded on three sides by the homes of these
people [the Afnáns] and, on another side, it shares a wall with the Jewish
homes. After sometime, the Bahá‟ís have built their Temple and a steady
stream [of believers] comes for pilgrimage to this Site. However, in its
present condition, this mosque is a disgrace to the Muslim community.”
“You must go and discuss this matter with these people,” the Ayatu‟llah
responded. “If they agree, I expect that rebuilding this mosque will be an
easy job; otherwise, it would be very difficult.”

One night, a neighbor of ours, Hájí Ahmad-i-Mahut-chi [the crinoline
merchant], sent word that he wanted to meet with us and I named a time for
this meeting. We met at the house next to the House of the Báb. After the
customary exchange of pleasantries and sharing of refreshments, he
ventured to say, “You have raised a beautiful and most delightful House.
Nevertheless, it seems wanting in one respect. Once that is also taken care
of, it will be the essence of perfection.” Imagining that he was about to be
presumptuous towards the House of the Báb, I sternly said, “What is the
defect that has come to your notice?” “There is a ruin next to your House,”

In a Zoroastrian or Jewish context, „Ma`bad‟ is a place of worship.

he replied, and I said, “It is a mosque and must be rebuilt.” Taken by
surprise, he reiterated, “So, you agree with rebuilding the mosque?” I
answered, “I agree only to rebuilding the mosque and not to any other use
for the building.” With great satisfaction, he exclaimed, “The mosque will
be built!”

Later, he went to Mahallati and reported that the Bahá‟ís had agreed, and
would help with the reconstruction. The Shaykh rejoiced, “In that case, there
is no problem.” To this day, I am puzzled as to why Mírzá Ibrahim-i-
Mujtahid was apprehensive of us at that time and wanted our consent. In
short, he prepared a written petition for all who stood identified with the
sacred religion of Islam, requesting financial contributions toward the cost
of renovating the mosque. He instructed his agents to take this petition to all
the Muslim homes in the neighborhood, and each was to mark his pledge on
it. Then, he added, “You are to take the petition to these gentlemen [the
Afnáns], but should they decline to make a contribution, do not constrain
them.”

The Muslim neighbors were each content to make a small contribution.
After all the donations were collected, they came to us. After reviewing the
sheet, this servant said to Hájí Ahamd, “Perhaps the esteemed supporters
don‟t know the true cost of such a construction, as this small amount is
certainly not enough.” “Everyone has pledged according to his own ability,”
Hájí Ahmad replied. “Whatever you give is in the path of service to your
illustrious Ancestor and will show your lofty purpose.” Since it was my
desire to help realize `Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s wish to have the mosque rebuilt, I
pledged a sum of 300 tumans on behalf of my brothers and myself, to be
paid in three installments. When they brought this promise to the attention
of Shaykh Mírzá Ibrahim, he raised his voice and cried, “O ye the faithful!
You claim that these people have no religion, don‟t believe in the Prophets
and Imams, and don‟t obey divine laws and ordinances, [but] they have, for
no reason other than the love of God, given 300 tumans! But consider, the
Sadru‟l-Islam, with all his wealth and affluence, has contributed a trifling
three tumans! Theirs is the true demonstration of faith! If these people are
indeed Bábís, I only wish that you were all Bábís!” One of the confidants of
Mírzá Ibrahim, who was a Bahá‟í, reported all their discussions to us.

Soon the construction work began and a certain Nur-Muhammad was
appointed to supervise the task. He was one of the residents of
Shimshirgarha Street and had recently converted to Islam. From the
beginning, he defrauded and embezzled the funds and was soon discovered
by one of his co-workers – a righteous and religious man and a faithful
friend of ours. He reported the matter to Mírzá Ibrahim. After it was
determined that Nur-Muhammad had indeed committed theft, Mírzá
Ibrahim reproached him, “O infidel garbed in Muslim‟s clothing! How
ironic that the Bábís should pay for the construction of the mosque and you,
who claim allegiance to Islam, would steal from the endowment fund!

Should the Bábís find this out, I will never be able to look them in the eyes
because of this shame!”

In short, Hájí Muhammad-Rahim, another new convert to Islam, was
appointed to the task this time and he invited me to the mosque and
consulted about the repairs. Frequently, I would go and help with the
planning and discussions. When the work had progressed to the point where
a well and an underground cistern were to be built, Hájí Muhammad-Rahim
said to me, “You have earned every right to this mosque. The existing well
and tank are situated behind the wall of your House and the repairs would
cause damage to your Dwelling. Therefore, we think it is best for the well,
cistern and sewage lines to be moved to the south-eastern quarters. In its
place, we will raise the pulpit and prayer-court.” I thanked him very
cordially. The promise of `Abdu‟l-Bahá that “This mosque will be the
landing and portal of the blessed House” was now fulfilled. As the
construction continued, they needed straw and wood to complete the work
and I contributed the required sum. Later, when they tried to reimburse me, I
refused, saying, “What I gave was in the path of God and my reckoning is
with Him.”

When the mosque was completed, we also donated a pulpit that was
ornamented with silver domes and calico figures, which we had inherited
from the time of Hájí Mírzá Abú‟l-Qásim. This donation was reported to
Mírzá Ibrahim and he expressed great eagerness to meet us.

On the day the mosque was inaugurated, I attended with my two brothers,
Hájí Mírzá Buzurg and Hájí Mírzá Diya‟. Mírzá Ibrahim had extended a
special invitation to us. He presided over the ceremony. Beforehand, he had
particularly admonished the people and the clergy present to ensure that no
one acted in a presumptuous or insulting manner towards us. When we
entered, the crowd welcomed us with cheers and praise. They had arranged
for our seat to be next to Mírzá Ibrahim himself – the seat of honor – and we
were led to the designated spot by Hájí `Abdu‟l-Rahim. When Mírzá
Ibrahim saw us, he stood full figure as a sign of utmost respect and greeted
us very affectionately. Refreshments and water-pipes were served and then
the Mírzá ascended the pulpit. For well over an hour, he sang our praises
and complimented us. He even pointed to us and noted, “Had it not been for
the efforts of these gentlemen, this mosque would have never been raised.
They contributed in every way, from offering money to wood to
consultation, until this house of God was erected in such a wonderful
manner. Indeed, this very pulpit on which I stand today, and from which the
remembrance of God and the sufferings of the Five Immaculate Ones 259 will
be recounted from now on, is just one of their generous donations. They,
surely, are the true Muslims. One can only wish that a few more Muslims
like them were found in this town!”

A reference to the principal Shi`ah figures, Muhammad, `Alí, Fatimih, Hasan and Husayn.

In short, his expressions of acclamation knew no bounds. At the end, he
offered a prayer for us, supplicating that, in the future, we would attain even
greater success in the service of God. When he descended the pulpit, another
eulogist ascended the altar and spoke at length and in the same vein about
us.

A period passed and, because of the above-mentioned events, we were not
disturbed. Eventually, conflict among different political factions started and
the democrats, constitutionalists and royalists began to dispute.260 In no
time, this mosque became a beehive for all the worthless elements. It
ushered in an era of injury and torment for us and witnessed a great surge in
our persecution, which continues unabated to this day. This is particularly
bad during the commemorations of `Ashura, the month of Ramadan, or any
other significant occasion, such as the marking of a martyrdom or a festivity.
[We are even persecuted] simply to raise a political clamor, as the sole target
remains the House of the Báb. However, God is the All-Powerful, the
Almighty and the Self-Sufficient. In Him we trust.

[As an example of God‟s all-preserving protection,] about a year-and-a-half
ago, one of the caretakers of the mosque negligently allowed the heater to
explode. It sat behind the wall of the House of the Báb. Soon the roof of the
mosque‟s sleeping quarters was in flames and it seemed imminent that the
fire would spread to the Blessed House as well. However, the friends who
lived in Shamshirgarha Street and pilgrims visiting at the time helped and
extinguished the fire.

Later that day, however, the Muslims claimed that the Bahá‟ís had
intentionally set fire to the mosque. {Since we were friends, I immediately
called the chief of police, the Brigadier General Qavami, the Furughu‟l-
Mulk. He instructed Captain Iyzadi to come at once and to bring several
officers, as well as the district attorney and Muhammad Nimruzi, the
inspector general of the city.}261 After a thorough investigation and
examination of all the evidence, they prepared a written report concluding
that the fire had started due to the negligence of someone in the mosque.
Fortunately, their report prevented the incident from erupting into an attack
on the Faith.

On that day, Siyyid Muhammad-i-Razavi, one of the influential clerics of
the city, came to the mosque to inspect the situation for himself. The city‟s
officials were, however, able to convince him that the fire was accidental
and that the Bahá‟ís had no hand in it. It so happened that Mírzá
Muhammad-Baqir-i-Khalili arrived as well. He was a friend to the Siyyid
and me, and he spoke with the Muslims to ensure that no disturbance

resulted from the accident. Khalili was a deeply devoted Bahá‟í, though he
never registered as one. On that day, without being asked, he volunteered to
pay for all the repairs, which drew the admiration of the Siyyid and other
Muslims. God works in wonderfully mysterious ways.
