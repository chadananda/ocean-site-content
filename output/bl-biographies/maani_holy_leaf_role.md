 The Greatest Holy Leaf’s Unparalleled Role in
Religious History and the Significance of the

Arc, the Site of Her Resting Place

Baharieh Rouhani Ma`ani

The year 2013 marks the hundredth anniversary of `Abdu’l-
Bahá’s return to the Holy Land from His historic trip to Egypt
and the West. He left Haifa for Egypt in September 1910 and
returned there three years later. The person “invested … with the
responsibility”’ to attend “to the multitudinous details arising
out of His protracted absence from the Holy Land” (Bahíyyih
Khánum, the Greatest Holy Leaf [henceforth, “BK”], p. 39) was His
honoured sister, Bahá’íyyih Khánum,1 the Greatest Holy Leaf. In
the words of Shoghi Effendi: “At the time of His [`Abdu’l-
Bahá’s] absence in the western world, she was His competent
deputy, His representative and vicegerent, with none to equal
her” (BK 28).

The centenary of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s return to the Holy Land
after His protracted absence coincides with the fiftieth
anniversary of the establishment of the Universal House of
Justice. As we gather to celebrate these landmarks, we take time
to ponder upon the life of a most remarkable woman in the
history of religion, focus attention on the outstanding services
she rendered and on the significance of the site Shoghi Effendi
chose for her burial place. It was his choice of a specific spot on
Mount Carmel that determined the location of the Arc, around
which are built the institutions of the world administrative

centre of the Faith, the Seat of the Universal House of Justice
occupying its centre top.
Born in Tihran to Bahá’u’lláh and Ásíyih Khánum in 1846,
she was named Fatimih at birth. She was later called Bahá’íyyih.
In a Tablet revealed in her honour, Bahá’u’lláh confirms that she
appeared in His name. “Verily she is a leaf that hath sprung
from this preexistent Root. She hath revealed herself in My
name and tasted of the sweet savours of My holy, My wondrous
pleasure” (BK p. v). The full text of Bahá’u’lláh’s original Arabic
of the above is inscribed around the circular dome of the
Greatest Holy Leaf’s monument on Mount Carmel (Ibid).

Varaqiy-i-`Ulya is the original Arabic title Bahá’u’lláh
bestowed on Bahá’íyyih Khánum’s mother. After Ásíyih
Khánum passed away, He bestowed the title on their daughter,
Bahá’íyyih Khánum. To avoid confusion, Shoghi Effendi
translated the title as the Most Exalted Leaf for Ásíyih Khánum,
and the Greatest Holy Leaf for Bahá’íyyih Khánum.

During Bahá’u’lláh’s Ministry

Bahá’íyyih Khánum’s life of service began at the age of six,
when Bahá’u’lláh was imprisoned in the Siyah Chal in late 1852.
At that time His House in Tihran was plundered. His wife,
Ásíyih Khánum with her three children took refuge in two
rented rooms in an obscure corner of the city. To obtain news
of Bahá’u’lláh and His condition, she was forced to leave early
in the morning and return after dark. Her son, `Abbas, who
later adopted `Abdu’l-Bahá as His title, then eight years old,
would accompany His mother. The six-year old Bahá’íyyih
Khánum would stay behind together with her two-year old
brother, Mírzá Mihdi, later titled the Purest Branch. This is how
she describes those frightful days:

The Greatest Holy Leaf                                            201

> How well I remember cowering in the dark, with my
> little brother, Mírzá Mihdi, the Purest Branch, at that
> time two years old, in my arms, which were not very
> strong, as I was only six. I was shivering with terror, for
> I knew of some of the horrible things that were
> happening, and was aware that they might have seized
> even my mother. (The Chosen Highway, pp. 42-3)

Referring to this episode, Shoghi Effendi says:

> As far back as the concluding stage of the heroic age of
> the Cause, which witnessed the imprisonment of
> Bahá’u’lláh in the Siyah-Chal of Tihran, the Greatest
> Holy Leaf, then still in her infancy, was privileged to
> taste of the cup of woe which the first believers of that
> Apostolic Age had quaffed. (BK 3-4)

After four months imprisonment in the Siyah Chal (Black
Pit), Bahá’u’lláh was released on condition that He leave His
homeland. Bahá’íyyih Khánum was among the members of the
family who accompanied Him. She had to part with the beloved
brother whom she had carried in her delicate arms during
Bahá’u’lláh’s four-month imprisonment and to whom she was so
attached. She also left her extended family and the country she
so loved, never to see it again.

During a ten-year sojourn in Baghdad, “she grew into a
beautiful girl, very much like her lovely mother in grace of body
and character, a gentle, slender maiden with large grey-blue eyes,
golden-brown hair, and warm, ivory-colored skin. Her sense of
humour was keen and her intelligence remarkable.” (Chosen
Highway 69)

Lady Blomfield who interviewed Bahá’íyyih Khánum writes
about her decision to remain unmarried and the reason behind
it: “As she grew up, she implored her father to allow her to
remain unmarried, that she might the better devote herself to
her three dearly loved ones.2 And so it was.” Lady Blomfield

202                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

then recounts what she had heard from an old man, a friend of
Bahá’u’lláh, Who had once said to him: “I know no man worthy
to marry such purity as my daughter.” In response to her
question, “Khánum must have been very lovely?” The man had
said: “I have been told so; naturally, I never saw her.” (Chosen
Highway 69)

The human perfections that Bahá’íyyih Khánum exemplified,
the heavenly attributes that she embodied, the laudable services
that she rendered during the ministry of Bahá’u’lláh and her
tremendous capacity for selfless service throughout her life won
her from the Supreme Pen the appellation of the Most
Distinguished Heroine of the Bahá’í dispensation:

> Verily, we have elevated thee to the rank of one of the
> most distinguished among thy sex and granted thee, in
> My court, a station such as none other woman hath
> surpassed. Thus have We preferred thee and raised thee
> above the rest, as a sign of grace from Him Who is the
> Lord of the throne on high and earth below … How high
> is the testimony of the Sadratu’l-Muntaha for its leaf;
> how exalted the witness of the Tree of Life unto its
> fruit! (BK 3-4)

Life in exile for a sensitive and conscientious child like
Bahá’íyyih Khánum, who was deeply concerned about the
difficulties that her parents faced, was particularly onerous. She
was ever ready to help in whatever manner she could.

The responsibilities that she undertook at a young age
amazed everyone. She was so busy with acts of service that she
had little or no time to receive instructions in the arts of
reading and writing. Her conversation with Lady Blomfield
confirms this:

> ‘My mother,’ she said, ‘sometimes gave lessons to my
> brother `Abbas, at other times Mírzá Musa would teach
The Greatest Holy Leaf                                            203

> Him, and on some occasions he would be taught by His
> father.’

‘And your lessons? I asked.

> ‘But I never had any time for studies,’ she said, in a tone
> which spoke volumes of absolute self-effacement, and
> this is the keynote of her whole life, no thought of her
> unselfishness entered her mind. (Chosen Highway 69).

Yet her communications with Bahá’ís throughout the world,
when she was required to step forward and take on a leadership
role, testify how well she met the challenge. Her letters in
Persian have been published in Dastkhathay-i-Hadrat-i-Varaqiy-
i-`Ulya. The English translation of a large selection of her letters
was published in 1982 in Bahíyyih Khánum, the Greatest Holy
Leaf on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of her passing.

What we know of Bahá’íyyih Khánum’s services during the
ministry of Bahá’u’lláh is confined to her spoken chronicles
recorded by Lady Blomfield and Shoghi Effendi’s messages. The
situation of the women in the nineteenth century Middle East,
historians’ focus on the Person of the Manifestation of God and
the events revolving around Him, His sons and male followers,
to which they had easy access, as well as their respect for
tradition, which generally excluded women and their services
from historical treatment, are responsible for the dearth of
information about her and other early prominent women related
to Bahá’u’lláh and the Bab.

Shoghi Effendi makes it clear that Bahá’íyyih Khánum

> shared the imprisonment, the grief, the banishment of
> the Abha Beauty, and in the storm which broke out in
> Iraq — because of the plotting and the treachery of the
> prime mover of mischief, the focal centre of hate — she
> bore, with complete resignation and acquiescence,
> uncounted ordeals.3 (BK 26-7)
204                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

He confirms that when she was in her teens, Bahá’u’lláh
entrusted her “with missions that no girl of her age could, or
would be willing to, perform.” He also explains how with
“spontaneous joy she seized her opportunity and acquitted
herself of the task with which she had been entrusted!” (BK 33)

Extolling Bahá’íyyih Khánum’s outstanding attributes that
distinguished her from others and which manifested themselves
after arrival in `Akká, Shoghi Effendi says:

> Not until … she had been confined in the company of
> Bahá’u’lláh within the walls of the prison-city of `Akká
> did she display, in the plenitude of her power and in the
> full abundance of her love for Him, those gifts that
> single her out, next to `Abdu’l-Bahá, among the members
> of the Holy Family as the brightest embodiment of that
> love which is born of God and of that human sympathy
> which few mortals are capable of evincing.

> Banishing from her mind and heart every earthly
> attachment, renouncing the very idea of matrimony, she,
> standing resolutely by the side of a Brother whom she
> was to aid and serve so well, arose to dedicate her life to
> the service of her Father’s glorious Cause. Whether in
> the management of the affairs of His Household in
> which she excelled, or in the social relationships which
> she so assiduously cultivated in order to shield both
> Bahá’u’lláh and `Abdu’l-Bahá, whether in the unfailing
> attention she paid to the everyday need of her Father, or
> in the traits of generosity, of affability and kindness,
> which she manifested, the Greatest Holy Leaf had by that
> time abundantly demonstrated her worthiness to rank as
> one of the noblest figures intimately associated with the
> life-long work of Bahá’u’lláh. (BK 34-35)
The Greatest Holy Leaf                                       205

During the Ministry of `Abdu’l-Bahá

The ascension of Bahá’u’lláh on 29 May 1892 brought to the
fore deep-rooted resentment in the heart of Mírzá Muhammad-
`Ali, the half-brother of `Abdu’l-Bahá and the Greatest Holy
Leaf. Mírzá Muhammad-`Ali, envious of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s
matchless personality and His high standing in the Bahá’í
community, also in society, had tried to undermine Him
through various schemes even during their Father’s lifetime.
Now that Bahá’u’lláh had passed away, Mírzá Muhammad-`Ali
imagined vainly that he could enjoy a station on par with
`Abdu’l-Bahá and share with Him the authority bestowed on
Him in Bahá’u’lláh’s Book of the Covenant.

Before His Ascension, Bahá’u’lláh had entrusted a sealed
document written in His own hand to `Abdu’l-Bahá. In that
document, known as the Book of His Covenant, Bahá’u’lláh had
appointed His Most Great Branch (`Abdu’l-Bahá), His Successor
and the authorized Interpreter of His Writings. In the same
document He had made it clear that the station of Mírzá
Muhammad-`Ali, the Greater Branch, was beneath that of
`Abdu’l-Bahá’s. When the document was unsealed and its
contents read in the presence of selected believers including
some family members, Mírzá Muhammad-`Ali’s hopes were
shattered. Therefore he resorted to mischief and treachery to
achieve his goal. He and his supporters, including almost all
members of Bahá’u’lláh’s family, started a campaign to
undermine `Abdu’l-Bahá, to confuse the faint in heart and
divide the community. The Greatest Holy Leaf during that
crucial juncture in the early history of the Bahá’í Faith stood
firmly by the side of her illustrious Brother and fearlessly lent
Him her full support. In the words of Shoghi Effendi, “in the
midst of that storm of violation, the countenance of that rare
treasure of the Lord shone all the brighter, and throughout the
Bahá’í community, her value and high rank became clearly
perceived” (BK 28). He also says:

206                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> With the passing of Bahá’u’lláh and the fierce onslaught
> of the forces of disruption that followed in its wake, the
> Greatest Holy Leaf, now in the hey-day of her life, rose
> to the height of her great opportunity and acquitted
> herself worthily of her task … but for her sleepless
> vigilance, her tact, her courtesy, her extreme patience
> and heroic fortitude, grave complications might have
> ensued and the load of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s anxious care
> would have been considerably increased. (BK 37-8)

When the Covenant-breakers’ widespread activities climaxed
and affected `Abdu’l-Bahá’s health, He withdrew to Tiberias,
where He stayed for weeks. During that time the Greatest Holy
Leaf for the first time in her life had to shoulder the kind of
responsibility never before she had been required to undertake.
A significant event took place during `Abdu’l-Bahá’s absence
from `Akká in 1895. The marriage of Diya’iyyih Khánum, the
eldest daughter of `Abdu’l-Bahá and Munírih Khánum, with
Mírzá Hadi, a great nephew of Khadijih Bagum, who had come
from Iran for the purpose took place at that time. Mírzá Hadi
had been to the Holy Land toward the end of Bahá’u’lláh’s
ministry and his proposal to marry Diya’yyih Khánum had
received His approval. His return to the Holy Land for the
purpose of finalizing arrangements for the wedding coincided
with the time `Abdu’l-Bahá had withdrawn to Tiberias. His
approval for the marriage to take place at that time was sought
and received. However, He was not physically present at the
ceremony. A Tablet He revealed at that time lays open the depth
of His sorrow occasioned by the Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh and
the immense hardships sustained by members of His family:

> Now because it is the day of separation, and the time of
> mourning, the fire of anxiety is flaming, the heat of
> burning sorrow is, as it were, shriveling up the universe!

> The calamities of my family are beyond endurance, and
> the troubles of those sorrowful leaves (sister, wife,
> daughters) are without end.

> From all directions the arrows of hardship are being
> showered upon them, like rain-drops in spring, and the
> spears of the unfaithful are being hurled upon them
> without ceasing….

> Oh, family of this sorrowful one, all is sacrifice. No
> pleasure is desired by you.

I know your sorrows.

> The Mufti may be asked to chant the Marriage Chant at
> the Holy Shrine on Sunday. (Chosen Highway 113-114)

Despite the immense suffering that the sedition and mischief-
making of Mírzá Muhammad-`Ali and his kindred had caused
the Centre of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant and His family, the
Greatest Holy Leaf, the person in charge in `Abdu’l-Bahá’s
absence, invited them to the wedding. Tuba Khánum4 says: “My
aunt invited the family of Muhammad-`Ali to come in the
evening. They came and jeered at the simplicity of the wedding
with great ridicule.” (Ibid 114)

The stringent restrictions imposed upon women prevented
them to personally carry out functions outside the home. By
doing so they would have risked being seen by men who were
not their close blood relatives. Women of good repute did not
appear in public in those days without an immediate male
relative. The marriage of Diya’iyyih Khánum and Mírzá Hadi
during `Abdu’l-Bahá’s absence in Tiberias was fortuitous in that
the family now had a close male relative, who could undertake
what needed to be done beyond the confines of the house. This
arrangement made it possible for the Greatest Holy Leaf to
discharge her responsibilities inside and outside the home until
`Abdu’l-Bahá returned to `Akká.

208                                          Lights of Irfán vol. 15

Another trip of weeks’ duration that `Abdu’l-Bahá undertook
for health reasons was when He visited Haifa and stayed in the
cave of Elijah. The presence of Bahá’íyyih Khánum in `Akká
made it possible for `Abdu’l-Bahá to take such trips, when it
was necessary.

The Covenant-breakers’ constant agitation and intrigues
caused the Central Government, whose seat was Constantinople
(Istanbul of today), to dispatch twice a Commission of Enquiry,
to investigate fabricated charges against `Abdu’l-Bahá, and
submit a report. “In the days of the Commission of
Investigation,” Shoghi Effendi says, “she [Bahá’íyyih Khánum]
was a staunch and trusted supporter of the peerless Branch of
Bahá’u’lláh, and a companion to Him beyond compare.” (BK 28)

When His life was in imminent danger, `Abdu’l-Bahá wrote
His Will and Testament. In it He appointed Shoghi Effendi,
then a child, as the Guardian of the Cause of God. His situation
being very grim and investigators most intent on keeping
everything under surveillance, He buried the document under
ground, lest it be discovered and its contents disclosed
prematurely. It was to Bahá’íyyih Khánum, His well-beloved
sister and confidant, that He divulged the secret of Shoghi
Effendi’s appointment to lead the Bahá’í world after Him.

There is yet another instance pointing to the complete trust
`Abdu’l-Bahá had in the Greatest Holy Leaf’s ability to
discharge delicate responsibilities. When the casket containing
the remains of the Bab and His fellow-martyr reached the shores
of the Holy Land, she was the person entrusted with that
precious trust. The remains were kept in her room in the House
of `Abdu’lláh Pasha until a safe venue could be found.

Then came the revolution of the Young Turks, which was the
outward cause of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s release from years of
confinement in 1908. Instead of enjoying with members of His
family a life of relative ease, He first completed the Mausoleum
He was building on Mount Carmel since 1900. On Naw-Ruz
1909, He entombed the remains of the Bab, and immediately

began preparations for His historic trip that “in pursuance of
God’s inscrutable Wisdom”, He had conceived “in the darkest
hours of His confinement…” (BK 39) In a Tablet revealed in
honor of the Greatest Holy Leaf on the day He embarked on
His historic trip, `Abdu’l-Bahá says:

O thou my sister, my dear sister!

> Divine wisdom hath decreed this temporary separation,
> but I long more and more to be with thee again. Patience
> is called for, and long-suffering, and trust in God, and
> the seeking of His favour. Since thou art there, my mind
> is completely at rest.

> In recent days, I have made a plan to visit Egypt, if this
> be God’s will. Do thou, on my behalf, lay thy head on
> the sacred Threshold, and perfume brow and hair in the
> dust of that Door, and ask that I may be confirmed in
> my work; that I may, in return for His endless bounties,
> win, if He will, a drop out of the ocean of servitude. (BK
> 13)

Referring to the magnitude of responsibilities that the
Greatest Holy Leaf discharged during `Abdu’l-Bahá’s trip to the
West, Shoghi Effendi says:

> And when … the ban on `Abdu’l-Bahá’s confinement was
> lifted … He with unhesitating confidence, invested His
> trusted and honoured sister with the responsibility of
> attending to the multitudinous details arising out of His
> protracted absence from the Holy Land. (BK 39)

The responsibilities that the Greatest Holy Leaf discharged at
various stages of her life, especially during `Abdu’l-Bahá’s
protracted absence in the western world, achieved purposes far
beyond what was considered the need of the hour: Serving as
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ‘competent deputy, representative and
vicegerent’ (BK 28) familiarized the Bahá’í world with her unique

210                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

personality and leadership ability. As a result, the believers
turned to her unhesitatingly, when He passed away unexpectedly
after a brief illness. It also prepared her to fill an apparent void
immediately after `Abdu’l-Bahá’s ascension and discharge even
greater responsibilities several times during Shoghi Effendi’s
ministry.

After `Abdu’l-Bahá’s Ascension and During Shoghi
Effendi’s Ministry

`Abdu’l-Bahá passed away very early in the morning of 28

November 1921. Shoghi Effendi, the person He had appointed
in His Will and Testament as the Guardian of the Cause of God,
was then studying at Oxford University in Great Britain,
completely unaware that he had been chosen to lead the Bahá’í
world after His Grandfather’s ascension. Equally unaware were
the believers that Shoghi Effendi was the distinguished Branch
appointed by `Abdu’l-Bahá to lead the Bahá’í world after Him.
Mírzá Muhammad-`Ali, whose opposition to the Centre of the
Covenant, had cost him the loss of the right to succeed Him,
was hard at work to present himself as the leader of the Bahá’í
community. At that crucial juncture in the history of the Faith,
the Greatest Holy Leaf, `Abdu’l-Bahá’s competent deputy
during His protracted absence from the Bahá’í World Centre,
stepped forth and guided the believers throughout the world
until Shoghi Effendi returned to the World Centre, exactly one
month after `Abdu’l-Bahá’s ascension.

Shoghi Effendi received the news of his Grandfather’s
ascension at about noon on 29 November. The Greatest Holy
Leaf had sent a cable to the address of Major Tudor Pole in
London. It reached that office at 9:30 in the morning on 29
November. It read: “His Holiness `Abdu’l-Bahá ascended Abha
Kingdom. Inform friends” (BK 114). Amatu’l-Bahá Rú˙íyyih
Khánum believes Major Pole “must have telephoned Shoghi
Effendi, asking him to come at once to his office…” (The Priceless
Pearl, p. 39). When Shoghi Effendi learned the shocking news, he

began preparations for the voyage to Haifa. Heartbroken and
grief-stricken he travelled by boat to Alexandria, Egypt, then by
train to Haifa, where he arrived a month later. The Covenant-
breakers during this time had renewed intense activity to install
Mírzá Muhammad-`Ali as the rightful successor of `Abdu’l-
Bahá. The Greatest Holy Leaf, fully aware of their schemes,
despite the tremendous loss she had suffered, prevented Mírzá
Muhammad-`Ali from entering `Abdu’l-Bahá’s House where
mourners were received, and ensured that the Covenant-
breakers’ efforts and propaganda were in vain. She warned the
friends in America on 14 December 1921:

> Now is period of great tests. The friends should be firm
> and united in defending the Cause. Nakeseens
> [Covenant-breakers] starting activities through press
> other channels all over world. Select committee of wise
> cool heads to handle press propaganda in America. (BK
> 114)

Bahá’íyyih Khánum’s acute alertness, constant vigilance and
ceaseless efforts during that short critical period after `Abdu’l-
Bahá’s ascension, when He was gone and the person He had
appointed as the Guardian of the Cause of God and authorized
interpreter of Holy Writings was away, protected the believers
from the mischief of evil-doers and their fresh intrigues.

On 21 December 1921, Bahá’íyyih Khánum assured the
Persian and American believers that `Abdu’l-Bahá had left “full
instructions in His Will and Testament” (Ibid). On 29 December,
though herself bereaved and heart-broken, she received the
grief-stricken 24-year old Guardian of the Cause of God.
Referring to the boundless love with which she received him and
the tender way she treated him, he says:

> After the ascension of `Abdu’l-Bahá to the realm of the
> All-Glorious, that Light of the Concourse on High
> enfolded me, helpless as I was, in the embrace of her
> love, and with incomparable pity and tenderness,
212                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> persuaded, guided, and urged me on to the requirements
> of servitude. The very elements of this frail being were
> leavened with her love, refreshed by her companionship,
> sustained by her eternal spirit. (BK 29)

On 7 January 1922, Bahá’íyyih Khánum sent two cables to
Iran, announcing the dispatch of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and
Testament and of Shoghi Effendi’s appointment as Centre of
the Cause (Priceless Pearl 47). On 16 January 1922, she informed
the friends in the United States: “In Will Shoghi Effendi
appointed Guardian of Cause and Head of House of Justice.”
(Ibid 48)

Legal Challenge to Shoghi Effendi’s Authority

A month after his return to the Holy Land, Shoghi Effendi
faced a legal challenge to his authority as the Guardian of the
Cause of God. Mírzá Muhammad-`Ali, the Greater Branch, had
he not brought himself to naught through active opposition to
the Centre of the Covenant, would have succeeded `Abdu’l-
Bahá, the Most Great Branch, according to the Book of
Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant. However, he had lost his legacy due to
his misdeeds and wicked doings, and been excommunicated
during the ministry of `Abdu’l-Bahá, Who, in His Will and
Testament appointed Shoghi Effendi as the Guardian of the
Cause of God. Mírzá Muhammad-`Ali nonetheless tried to
establish his authority through legal action. According to
Amatu’l-Bahá Rú˙íyyih Khánum,

> … [Mírzá Muhammad-`Ali] applied to the civil
> authorities to turn over the custodianship of
> Bahá’u’lláh’s Shrine to him on the grounds that he was
> `Abdu’l-Bahá’s lawful successor. The British authorities
> refused on the grounds that it appeared to be a religious
> issue; he then appealed to the Muslim religious head and
> asked the Mufti of `Akká to take formal charge of
> Bahá’u’lláh’s Shrine; this dignitary, however, said he did

> not see how he could do this as the Bahá’í teachings were
> not in conformity with Shariah law. All other avenues
> having failed he sent his younger brother, Badiulláh, with

The shock of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s sudden departure from this
world, the immense grief occasioned by not having been with
Him during the last days of His ministry, the utter surprise of
being required to take on the mantle of leadership of the Bahá’í
world, and the intensity of opposition by the Covenant-
breakers to his appointment, all of which affected his health,
convinced Shoghi Effendi of the necessity to spend some time
in a quiet place to recuperate, also to gain “strength, self-
confidence and spiritual energy.” (BK 21) Therefore, just over
three months after his arrival, he appointed the Greatest Holy
Leaf as his representative and head of a committee established
to look after the affairs of the worldwide Bahá’í community,
both at home and abroad, and left the Holy Land. The letters
that he wrote to the Bahá’ís of the world in English and Persian
conveyed this information. In effect, as Bahá’íyyih Khánum had
deputized for `Abdu’l-Bahá during His travels in the West, she
was now called upon to deputize for His Chosen Branch. As we
will see, she performed this task with competence, self-
abnegation and absolute loyalty. Indeed, the members of that
committee, except for the Greatest Holy Leaf, at various stages
during the ministry of Shoghi Effendi broke the Covenant. She
stood firm till the last breath. No other woman in religious
history has played a comparable role.

The issue of the legal custodianship of the Shrine of
Bahá’u’lláh had not been resolved when Shoghi Effendi left on 5
April 1922. On that day, he wrote to Colonel Symes, the
Governor of Phoenicia:

> As I am compelled to leave Haifa for reasons of health, I
> have named as my representative during my absence, the
> sister of `Abdu’l-Bahá, Bahíyyih Khánum. To assist her
> to conduct the affairs of the Bahá’í Movement in this
> country and elsewhere, I have also appointed a
> committee of the following Bahá’ís [eight men of the
> local community, three of them the sons-in-law of
> `Abdu’l-Bahá] … The Chairman of this Committee, to be
> soon elected by its members, with the signature of
> Bahíyyih Khánum has my authority to transact any
> affairs that may need to be considered and decided
> during my absence. I regret exceedingly to be unable to
> see you before my departure, that I may express more
> adequately the satisfaction that I feel to know that your
> sense of justice will safeguard the interests of the Cause
> of Bahá’u’lláh whenever called upon to act. (Priceless Pearl
> 276)

The legal action that Mírzá Muhammad-`Ali took resulted in
Bahá’íyyih Khánum being declared by Shoghi Effendi in his
official communication with the governor of the area as his
representative with the right of signature. This was no doubt
the first time in his career that the governor had to deal with a
woman at the head of a religious community, in a land revered
by several religions and among people so steeped in tradition.
Had anything like it happen previously in the annals of religion?

In the first letter that Bahá’íyyih Khánum sent in April 1922

to the believers after Shoghi Effendi’s departure, she said:

> According to a letter written by his own hand, which is
> enclosed, he has appointed this prisoner to supervise and
> manage the affairs of the Cause, through consultation

> with the Holy Family, during his absence. Therefore, this
> perishable one, temporarily, has organized an assembly
> to act according to the advice of the souls who were
> appointed and nominated by him — His Holiness Shoghi
> Effendi. (Quoted in Leaves of the Twin Divine Trees, p. 189)

The enclosure mentioned in Bahá’íyyih Khánum’s letter, a
letter written in Shoghi Effendi’s hand, reads:

> This servant, after that grievous event and great
> calamity, the ascension of His Holiness `Abdu’l-Bahá to
> the Abha Kingdom, has been so stricken with grief and
> pain and so entangled in the troubles created by the
> enemies of the Cause of God, that I consider that my
> presence here, at such a time and in such an atmosphere,
> is not in accordance with the fulfillment of my
> important and sacred duties.

> For this reason, unable to do otherwise, I have left for a
> time the affairs of the Cause both at home and abroad,
> under the supervision of the Holy Family and the
> headship of the Greatest Holy Leaf until, by the Grace of
> God, having gained health, strength, self-confidence and
> spiritual energy, and having taken into my hands, in
> accordance with my aim and desire, entirely and
> regularly the work of service I shall attain to my utmost
> spiritual hope and aspiration. (BK 21)

In May 1922, Bahá’íyyih Khánum informed the believers
throughout the world of the incessant activities of the
Covenant-breakers, apprised them of the details of the seizure
of the key of Bahá’u’lláh’s Shrine and directed them to send
requests to the British authorities in Jerusalem confirming that
Shoghi Effendi was the legitimate leader of the Bahá’í world
community, appointed by `Abdu’l-Bahá in His Will and
Testament. This course of action was based on what the

216                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

government had suggested. The full text of the letter is quoted
in Bahíyyih Khánum, the Greatest Holy Leaf, pages 117-120.

Several months passed and there was no response. Wishing to
know what actions the governor had taken regarding the
restoration of the key to the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh to its original
caretaker, Bahá’íyyih Khánum in a letter dated 15 October 1922
enquired from him about the case. In response she received a
letter, dated 30 October. It reads:

Dear Madam,

> In reply to your letter of the 15th instant I regret that I
> cannot throw any very new light on the subject. As has
> been stated publicly the Government feel that the
> custody of the Shrine at Acre as well as other important
> questions affecting the Bahá-ist organization should if
> possible be settled by a Congress of representatives of
> Bahá’í opinion throughout the World. To judge from
> messages received from a number of Bahá-ist Centres it
> would appear that they endorse and uphold the
> provisions of the Will of the late Sir Abdul Bahá Abbas,
> and as soon as the Congress aforementioned has actually
> met and given its decision the Government will be
> prepared to entertain its final recommendations. In the
> meantime if it is possible to find an individual whose
> provisional custody of the Key of the Shrine will be
> offensive to no section of Bahais I shall be only too glad
> to hand over the key to him until such time as the
> Congress has met and made its final recommendations in
> the matter. (Leaves, p. 193)

Shoghi Effendi returned to the Holy Land in mid-December
1922 and continued efforts to satisfy the requirements and
convince the authorities to return the key of the Most Holy
Tomb to its original caretaker. Finally, fourteen months after
the key had been forcibly seized, the Sub-Governor at Acre was
instructed by the District Governor, G.S. Symes, ‘to return the

key of the Tomb of Bahá’Ulláh to Es Saiyid Abu’l-Kassim’, the
original caretaker of the Shrine. The date of that letter is 14
March 1923. (Leaves, p. 193)

The Eruption of Hostilities in Iran

While dealing with the issue of the seizure of the key to the
Most Holy Shrine by the Covenant-breakers, another significant
crisis erupted. The fanatical elements in Iran, vainly imagining
that with `Abdu’l-Bahá’s ascension the friends in that land had
been left defenseless, took advantage of political instability in
the country, stirred up trouble and incited the inhabitants to
renew their attacks on the Bahá’ís in that land. Bahá’íyyih
Khánum’s letter of 20 July 1922 to the Bahá’ís of America
explains:

> Sad news has come to us out of Iran in recent days, and
> it has intensely grieved the entire Bahá’í world: they
> have, in most parts of that land, set bonfires of envy and
> malevolence, and hoisted the banner of aggression
> against this much wronged community; they have left no
> means untried, no plot or strategy neglected, and have
> arisen with extreme hostility and spite to pull out by
> their very roots the trees of this garden of God. (BK 165)

In the same letter she asks that assemblies act urgently,
contact the Iranian embassy in their country and seek justice on
behalf of their persecuted Bahá’í brothers and sisters in Iran.
She explains what the petition was to include, even asks the
assemblies to “make this same representation through your own
ambassador in Tihran, so that he may direct the attention of the
Iranian authorities to these persecutions, and awaken that
government to the possibility of divine retribution and to the
shameful stigma occasioned by such actions directed against this
innocent community by the heedless and ignorant amongst the
mass of the people…” (BK 169)

218                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

The beloved Guardian, after his return to the Bahá’í World
Centre on 22 December 1922, left again for health reasons in
early summer 1923 and in 1924, each time for several months.
The Greatest Holy Leaf’s presence in Haifa to supervise the
work of the Faith in his absence was indispensable. Every time
she performed most conscientiously and faithfully the
responsibilities entrusted to her, and each time after Shoghi
Effendi returned, she bowed before his authority and continued
supporting his work to the end of her life. What she did stands
in clear contrast to other members of the family, most of whom
at various stages of Shoghi Effendi’s ministry turned against
him and broke the Covenant.

For a glimpse of the scope of the services Bahá’íyyih Khánum
rendered joyfully to the community at large during World War
I, we have this testimony from Shoghi Effendi:

> The outbreak of the Great War gave her yet another
> opportunity to reveal the true worth of her character
> and to release the latent energies of her heart. The
> residence of `Abdu’l-Bahá in Haifa was besieged, all
> throughout that dreary conflict, by a concourse of
> famished men, women and children whom the
> maladministration, the cruelty and neglect of the
> officials of the Ottoman Government had driven to seek
> an alleviation to their woes. From the hand of the
> Greatest Holy Leaf, and out of the abundance of her
> heart, these hapless victims of a contemptible tyranny,
> received day after day unforgettable evidences of a love
> they had learned to envy and admire. Her words of cheer
> and comfort, the food, the money, the clothing she
> freely dispensed, the remedies which, by a process of her
> own, she herself prepared and diligently applied — all
> these had their share in comforting the disconsolate, in
> restoring sight to the blind, in sheltering the orphan, in
> healing the sick, and in succouring the homeless and the
> wanderer. (BK 40)

And the following from Dr. Habib Mu’ayyad, who at `Abdu’l-
Bahá’s behest, served in the Holy Land for some time:

> Poor and shelterless orphans were the recipients of her
> special care and affection. She sheltered them in the
> house of the Master and loved them dearly … regardless
> of whether they were Arab or non-Arab, black or white,
> Bahá’í or non-Bahá’í. She taught them good manners, the
> art of relating to others, dawn prayers, reading and
> writing, home management, embroidery, sewing,
> cooking, studying the verses of God, fear of God and
> human perfections. She adorned them with the ornament
> of knowledge, good character, perfection and fear of
> God. She turned them into fruitful trees, led them to the
> highway of guidance, prepared them for living the life,
> made them prosperous and delivered them to society.

The Greatest Holy Leaf’s Station and the Significance of
the Arc, the Site of Her Resting Place

Bahá’íyyih Khánum passed away in Haifa on 15 July 1932. In
a cable sent on the day of her passing, Shoghi Effendi says:
“Humanity shall erelong recognize its irreparable loss.” In the
same cable he refers to her as his ‘sole earthly sustainer’, his
‘affectionate comforter’, ‘the joy and solace’ of his life.
Regarding her burial place, He says, “Her sacred remains will
repose vicinity Holy Shrines.” As an evidence of the unique
station she occupies and a mark of appreciation for the
unprecedented services she rendered during her life, Shoghi
Effendi had chosen a significant spot on Mount Carmel as the
site for her resting place. In the same cable he says: “So grievous
a bereavement necessitates suspension for nine months
throughout Bahá’í world every manner religious festivity.’5 He
directs “Local Assemblies and Groups hold befitting manner
memorial gatherings, extol a life so laden sacred experiences, so

220                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

rich imperishable memories…” He further advises that
“additional commemoration service of strictly devotional
character” be held “Auditorium Mashriqu’l-Adhkar.”6 (BK 22-3)

Shoghi Effendi had made the decision to bury Bahá’íyyih
Khánum’s remains in a specific spot on Mount Carmel, before
she passed away. The instructions he had left for her burial, if
she winged her flight to the world beyond while he was away,
make this conclusion clear. The spot he had chosen was in close
proximity to the Mausoleum built by `Abdu’l-Bahá for the Bab,
where `Abdu’l-Bahá’s body has also been entombed. Certain
known factors help us grasp the significance of his choice:

Bahá’íyyih Khánum’s unique station as the Most Outstanding
Heroine of Bahá’u’lláh’s dispensation warranted a burial place
that symbolized her exalted rank. It was also to be a place, to
which the remains of her mother and martyred brother, the
Purest Branch, could be transferred. For they, too, enjoy special
station bestowed upon them by Bahá’u’lláh, and the Greatest
Holy Leaf had expressed the wish to be buried close to her
mother.

The spots on Mount Carmel ennobled by Bahá’u’lláh’s
footsteps during His several visits to Haifa were, as far as we
know, confined to an area facing `Akká, the Qiblih of the
people of Bahá. The most favored spot was the one He had
chosen for the Bab’s Sepulcher. The areas surrounding that
exalted edifice are regarded sacred precincts.

In the Lawh-i Karmil (the Tablet of Carmel), the charter for
the development of the Bahá’í World Centre, addressing the
mountain of the Lord, Bahá’u’lláh has revealed: “Ere long will
God sail His Ark upon thee, and will manifest the people of
Bahá who have been mentioned in the Book of Names” (TB 5).
This statement clearly designates Mount Carmel as the place
where the Seat of the Universal House of Justice, “the supreme
legislative body of the Bahá’í world” (Messages to the Bahá’í World,
1950-1957, p. 21), would be established. However, it does not
specify a specific area of Mount Carmel.

The three significant sites identified on Mount Carmel are:
The site for the Shrine of the Bab chosen by Bahá’u’lláh
Himself, the site where He revealed the Tablet of Carmel,
designated by Shoghi Effendi as the site for the future
Mashriqu’l-Adhkar, and a site on Mount Carmel for sailing of
the Ark of God (the Seat of the Universal House of Justice). The
determination of the exact spot on Mount Carmel for the Seat
of the Universal House of Justice seems to have been made by
Shoghi Effendi. That determination has a direct link to his
choice of a spot for the Greatest Holy Leaf’s resting place.

The Significance of Mount Carmel Arc and Its Link to the Ark
of God Revealed in the Tablet of Carmel

Shoghi Effendi envisaged an Arc in the heart of Mount
Carmel, upon which the Ark of God was destined to sail. He
considered the base of that Arc a most befitting place for the
resting place of the Greatest Holy Leaf. The link between ‘Ark’
(ship) and ‘Arc’ (a semi-circle, or bow-shaped) goes back to the
time of Noah: The rebelliousness of his followers caused a
devastating flood and threatened everyone’s life. Noah built an
ark (ship), which saved from annihilation those who entered it.
When the storm and flood subsided, a rainbow appeared “As a
sign that the earth will no longer be destroyed by flood” (Gen.
9:8-16; Ezekiel 1:28). Rainbow is “the token of the covenant which
God made with Noah when he came forth from the ark.”
(Smith’s Bible Dictionary) What links ark meaning ship to arc
meaning bow-shaped or semi-circle, is the rainbow that
appeared when the storm subsided. Rainbow has since become
the sign of the covenant that God will protect from destructive
storms and flood those who enter His Ark and abide therein.
Shoghi Effendi has referred to the Universal House of Justice as
“the last refuge for a tottering civilization.”

When Shoghi Effendi determined the site of the Greatest
Holy Leaf’s resting place, he clearly had in mind an elaborate
plan, which included transferring the remains of Ásíyih
Khánum, the Most Exalted Leaf, and Mírzá Mihdi, the Purest

222                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

Branch, from `Akká to the same spot on the slope of Mount
Carmel. This plan materialized in December 1939, seven years
after the passing of Bahá’íyyih Khánum. When all was done, he
conveyed the exhilarating news by cable to the friends in North
America:

> BLESSED REMAINS PUREST BRANCH AND
> MASTER’S MOTHER SAFELY TRANSFERRED
> HALLOWED       PRECINCTS     SHRINES   MOUNT
> CARMEL. LONG INFLICTED HUMILIATION WIPED
> AWAY. MACHINATIONS COVENANT-BREAKERS
> FRUSTRATE PLAN DEFEATED. CHERISHED WISH
> GREATEST HOLY LEAF FULFILLED. SISTER
> BROTHER      MOTEHR      WIFE    `ABDU’L-BAHA
> REUNITED ONE SPOT DESIGNED CONSTITUTE
> FOCAL    CENTRE       BAHÁ’Í  ADMINISTRATIVE
> INSTITUTIONS AT FAITH’S CENTRE.7 SHARE
> JOYFUL NEWS ENTIRE BODY AMERICAN
> BELIEVERS. (BK 60-61)

Referring to the significance of what had been accomplished,
he writes in his history of the first Bahá’í century:

> The conjunction of these three resting-places, under the
> shadow of the Bab’s own Tomb, embosomed in the heart
> of Carmel, facing the snow-white city across the bay of
> `Akká, the Qiblih of the Bahá’í world, set in a garden of
> exquisite beauty, reinforces, if we would correctly
> estimate its significance, the spiritual potencies of a
> spot, designated by Bahá’u’lláh Himself the seat of
> God’s throne. It marks, too, a further milestone in the
> road leading eventually to the establishment of that
> permanent world Administrative Centre of the future
> Bahá’í Commonwealth, destined never to be separated
> from, and to function in the proximity of, the Spiritual
> Centre of that Faith, in a land already revered and held

> sacred alike by the adherents of three of the world’s
> outstanding religious systems. (GPB 348)

In several of his messages Shoghi Effendi explains the
significance of conjoining the resting-places of the Greatest
Holy Leaf with those of her brother and mother. In a message to
America, after the transfer of the remains of Ásíyih Khánum
and the Purest Branch from `Akká to Mount Carmel, he says:

> … the conjunction of the resting-place of the Greatest
> Holy Leaf with those of her brother and mother
> incalculably reinforces the spiritual potencies of that
> consecrated Spot which, under the wings of the Bab’s
> over-shadowing Sepulcher, and in the vicinity of the
> future Mashriqu’l-Adhkar, which will be reared on its
> flank, is destined to evolve into the focal center of those
> world-shaking, world embracing, world-directing
> administrative institutions, ordained by Bahá’u’lláh and
> anticipated by `Abdu’l-Bahá, and which are to function
> in consonance with the principles that govern the twin
> institutions of the Guardianship and the Universal
> House of Justice. Then, and then only, will this
> momentous prophecy which illuminates the concluding
> passages of the Tablet of Carmel be fulfilled: “Ere long
> will God sail His Ark upon thee (Carmel), and will
> manifest the people of Bahá who have been mentioned in
> the Book of Names.” (Messages to America 1932-1946, 32-3)

And speaking of the link between the site of the resting-
places of the Greatest Holy Leaf, her mother and brother on
Mount Carmel in Haifa and the Mother Temple of the West in
North America, he says:

> And now, while the Bahá’í world vibrates with emotion
> at the news of the transfer of the precious remains of
> both the Purest Branch and of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s mother to
> a spot which, watched over by the Twin Holy Shrines
224                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> and in the close neighbourhood of the resting-place of
> the Greatest Holy Leaf, is to become the focus of the
> administrative institutions of the Faith at its world
> centre, the mere act of linking the destiny of so far-
> reaching an undertaking with so significant an event in
> the Formative Period of our Faith will assuredly set the
> seal of complete triumph upon, and enhance the spiritual
> potentialities of, a work so significantly started and so
> magnificently executed by the followers of Bahá’u’lláh
> in the North American continent.8 (Ibid, p. 37)

In designing the beautiful monument built over the resting-
place of the Greatest Holy Leaf, Shoghi Effendi had in mind for
it not only “to evolve into the focal centre of those world-
shaking, world-embracing, world-directing administrative
institutions, ordained by Bahá’u’lláh” (MA 32) but also for it to
symbolize the institutions of the Administrative Order: the
steps symbolize Local Spiritual Assemblies, the pillars the
National Spiritual Assemblies and the dome the Universal House
of Justice.

By a happy coincidence, the construction of the Seat of the
Universal House of Justice was complete by the time the Bahá’í
world commemorated the Fiftieth anniversary of the passing of
the Greatest Holy Leaf on 15 July 1982. At the Bahá’í World
Centre the friends visited her resting place at the early hours of
that morning, the exact time when she had passed away. Later
that day the friends residing in the Holy Land gathered in the
Reception Concourse of the Seat of the Universal House of
Justice for a memorial gathering with a program befitting her
station. Her memorial service was the first gathering to be held
in the Reception Concourse of the Seat.

The significance of Bahá’íyyih Khánum’s high station and the
uniqueness of the services she has rendered are eloquently
described in Shoghi Effendi’s statements about her. The
following is a sampling:

> Only future generations and pens abler than mine can,
> and will, pay a worthy tribute to the towering grandeur
> of her spiritual life, to the unique part she played
> through the tumultuous stages of Bahá’í history, to the
> expressions of unqualified praise that have streamed
> from the pen of both Bahá’u’lláh and `Abdu’l-Bahá, the
> Centre of His Covenant, though unrecorded, and in the
> main unsuspected by the mass of her passionate admirers
> in East and West, the share she had in influencing the
> course of some of the chief events in the annals of the
> Faith, the sufferings she bore, the sacrifices she made,
> the rare gifts of unfailing sympathy she so strikingly
> displayed — these, and many others stand so inextricably
> interwoven with the fabric of the Cause itself that no
> future historian of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh can afford to
> ignore or minimize. (BK 32)

> To this bear witness the Company on High, and beyond
> them God Himself, the Supreme Lord of all the heavens
> and the earths: that during all thy days, from thine
> earliest years until the close of thy life, thou didst
> personify the attributes of thy Father, the Matchless, the
> Mighty. Thou wert the fruit of His Tree, thou wert the
> lamp of His love, thou wert the symbol of His serenity,
> and of His meekness, the pathway of His guidance, the
> channel of His blessings, the sweet scent of His robe, the
> refuge of His loved ones and His handmaidens, the
> mantle of His generosity and grace. (BK 56)

> O thou solace of mine eyes, and beloved of my soul! Thy
> grace to me was plenteous, it can never be concealed; thy
> love for me was great, it can never be forgotten. Blessed,
> a thousand times blessed, is he who loves thee, and
> partakes of thy splendours, and sings the praises of thy
> qualities, and extols thy worth, and follows in thy
> footsteps; who testifies to the wrongs thou didst suffer,
> and visits thy resting-place, and circles around thine
226                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> exalted tomb, by day and by night. Woe unto him,
> retribution be his, who disputes thy rank and station,
> and denies thine excellence, and turns himself aside from
> thy clear, thy luminous and straight path. (BK 57)

Conclusion

Religion has always been heavily dependent on women for its
promotion and for the salvation of human beings. Through
their adherence to revealed laws and principles, they have passed
on cherished values and instilled in future generations standards
of decency necessary for carrying forward an ever-advancing
civilization. This pattern is traceable in all religions in spite of
religious history largely ignoring their services. One of the
unfortunate outcomes of the restrictions imposed on women in
the past has been making it impossible for them to scale
summits readily available to men. Among the handful women
whose names religious history has recorded none played a
leading role through a mandate conferred on her by the center
of authority. Bahá’íyyih Khánum, the Greatest Holy Leaf, is the
first woman in religious history deputizing for the Person
Bahá’u’lláh appointed as the Centre of His Covenant. She
played a crucial role during `Abdu’l-Bahá’s absence in the
western world. She also played a vital part after His Ascension,
and served as Shoghi Effendi’s representative during his early
absences from the World Centre of the Faith in the Holy Land.

The site of her resting place is a significant spot on Mount
Carmel, as stated in a cable from Shoghi Effendi:

> DESIGNED CONSTITUTE FOCAL CENTRE BAHÁ’Í
> ADMINISTRATIVE INSTITUTIONS AT FAITH’S
> CENTRE. (BK 60-61)

> place of the Greatest Holy Leaf, but at a lower elevation.
