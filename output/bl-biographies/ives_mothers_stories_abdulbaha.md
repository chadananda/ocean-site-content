Introduction

These stories were recorded by my mother, Muriel Ives Barrow Newhall, in the late 60's. They are her
personal recollections of events related, in most part, by those directly involved.

Mother met Abdu'l-Baha in 1912, when she was 15 years old. He told her that she would grow like a
tree and have many branches. Years later she realized, as so often happens, the meaning of this prediction. It
was twenty years before she declared her belief in Baha'u'llah, and she has observed many times 'it takes a tree
20 years to mature'. She had four children, fifteen grand children, and a couple of dozen great grand children.

In the early 30s Mother, who was divorced from her first husband, Theodore Obrig, married the
Reverend Reginald G. Barrow. The wedding ceremony was performed by her father Howard Colby Ives. It is
family history that they spent their wedding night on a park bench, as they could not obtain a room in a hotel
in Boston. Bishop Barrow, was a man of color, who was born in the West Indies.

Rev. Barrow was a Bishop of the African Orthodox Church. He had been ordained an Anglican Priest
on Barbados, and when he learned, upon coming to the United States, that the Episcopal Church was segregated
, he ultimately decided to work with the African Orthodox Church. The African Orthodox Church had similar
origins to the Greek and Russian Orthodox churches. Dad retired as the Archbishop of the African Orthodox
Church for North America.

In addition to raising her children, mother was an active Baha'i. She served on assemblies, lived in a
cooperative house with other believers, was a homefront pioneer in Santa Fe, New Mexico, pioneered to Madera
for several years; and practiced her faith in her daily life.

As you will see, these stories are, in most cases, her recollections of events which the participants
related to her. There are slightly different versions of some of them published elsewhere. We are not offering
these as alternatives to other versions, but as what one person, Mother, remembered in her early seventies.

What we feel is important in these stories is the message and feelings they bring, not the historical
facts. We will leave the facts to researchers and historians. We offer the images and emotions which shaped the
path for one Friend of God and which may point out a direction to others.

While we have changed the spelling of some names to conform to the current Baha'i Dictionary, we
have not edited the stories, as we are presenting Mother's Stories for you to savor as she wrote them.

Reginald Grand Barrow Jr.            Shawnigan Lake, BC        March 1998

O Thou help me...

It was in 1912 that Dr. Ali Kuli Khan - preparing for the visit of Abdu'l-Baha to Washington - began
to consider the questions he would ask Him upon His arrival. And, thinking it over, Dr. Khan realized that the
one thing he wanted most to know was some prayer he might utter quickly and from deep within his heart,
when the moment came when, as the representative of his country (then Persia) in Washington he must make
some instant diplomatic decision. When these moments came, as they did frequently - Dr. Khan felt that while
he always sincerely did his best, his wisdom was very limited and finite. If only he might have a prayer that
would draw to him a greater wisdom Ah, if he only might have such a prayer.

So the day came when Abdu'l-Baha was to arrive and Dr. Khan, accompanied by the Washington
believers, drove to the station to meet Him. The greeting was warm and deeply moving, and Khan's heart was
still filled with this one question he wanted most to ask the Master. And they were perhaps halfway back,
driving up Pennsylvania Avenue, when Abdu'l-Baha suddenly told Khan this story:

It had happened when Baha’u’llah had been gone from Baghdad for some two years. At that time no
one knew where He was and all hearts were sick with the fear that they never would see Him again. At this
time Abdu'l- Baha was a small boy, and the continued absence of His Beloved Father had become unendurable.
So, one night, all night long, the little boy (whom, even then, Baha'u'llah referred to as The Master) paced
restlessly up and down saying, shouting, beseeching, Ya Allah el Mustaghas! Ya Allah el Mustaghas! all night
long. And in the morning, when dawn was breaking, a messenger came to the door to say that a stranger was at
the city gate and had sent word to the Family that He wished them to bring to Him fresh raiment and water to
bathe in... So Abdu'l-Baha knew His beloved Father had returned.

And Dr. Khan knew the cry that he, too, might utter in his moments of need Ya Allah el
Mustaghas (which I am told means Oh, Thou help me in my extremity! ).

This was told me by Ali Kuli Khan

at Green-Acre in 1933 MIBN

I am doing ...

In the early days ( 1901 to '05), Abdu'l-Baha sent to the United States the beloved and most radiant
Abu'l-Fadl. The purpose was to travel and teach and Ali Kuli Khan was asked to accompany Abu'l-Fadl as
interpreter. This was arranged and the two gentlemen started off. The trip was a wonderful success. It was during
the period when teachers (Hindu, Zoroastrian or Buddhist) were greeted eagerly all over the country and these
Baha'i teachers. shared the wave of popularity., It was in one of the middle western cities that this experience
occurred.

The local Opera House had been rented for Abu'l-Fadl's talks and it was packed. Probably more than a
thousand people had come. And, before this crowd Abu'l-Fadl rose to speak. For a moment, he stood there, his
eyes roving over all the lifted, waiting faces, and suddenly he thought 'This trip is proving very successful! I
am doing very well, this is a cause for great pride and satisfaction and when I return to Acca the Master will be
well pleased with me. Truly I am doing well.' And, with this thought, the mind of Abu'l-Fadl went completely
blank. He did not know who he was or why he was standing on this platform with all these people looking at
him or what he was supposed to say. Then, instantly he realized what had happened. He had taken it upon
himself to feel that it was HE who had accomplished this success; it was HIS words that would reach the hearts;
it was HE - HE - HE - who had been proud. And, as he realized this he turned, in abject shame, to Baha’u’llah,
imploring His forgiveness and begging Him to fill his heart once more with His Light to move his lips again
with His Word. And immediately Abu'l-Fadl's prayer was answered, and the talk went forward.

Later, Abu'l-Fadl asked Dr. Khan how long it had been that he stood there tongue-tied and blank - for it
had seemed to Abu'l-Fadl that he must have disgraced himself before that great audience. But Khan assured him
that it had been no time at all that there had been no break in the discourse.

But it is to be noted that - many years afterward - Abdu'l-Baha particularly praised Abu'l-Fadl
for being one of the very rare souls who never used the pronouns 'I' or 'me' or 'mine'.

This was told to me by Ali Kuli Khan

in New York City c. 1934

What really happens...

It was at the end of this same teaching trip that, one day, Dr. Khan reminded Abu'l-Fadl that, day after
day, he had offered service to the best of his ability and, in view of this, would Abu'l-Fadl answer just one
question: What really happened to the soul after death? Abu'l-Fadl looked at Khan very thoughtfully - and
changed the subject.

A few days later, as they were nearing Washington, Dr. Khan repeated his question - "Please tell me -
what does happen to the soul after death?" Abu'l-Fadl glanced at Khan and changed the subject.

Finally they reached Washington and the day before Abu'l-Fadl was to return to Acca. Dr. Khan asked
the question for the third time. Abu'l-Fadl smiled. and went away.

Two or three years went by and one day Khan was sitting on a beach, looking at the sea. On the
horizon was a ship, and as first the hull and then the sails slipped out of sight - suddenly, gloriously, Khan
knew what happened to the soul after death. For, to those on board that ship nothing had happened - they were
still on their familiar ship sailing the same sea.

So, some time later when Ali Kuli Khan met Abu'l-Fadl in Acca he told him of this experience and
added - ""Why was it you refused, when I first asked you, to answer my question? Abu'l-Fadl said, lovingly,
"If, my dear friend, you would have been able to understand my answer, you would never have asked the
question."

Told to me by Ali Kuli Khan

in New York City c. 1934

Tea in Paris...

In the very early days Loulie Mathews came into the Faith while Abdu'l-Baha was yet imprisoned in
Acca. She came in very quickly immediately, really, upon hearing of it, and she came in aflame with
enthusiasm. She had been told that Abdu'l-Baha had expressed the wish that the Faith might be growing more
rapidly in Paris, so, to Paris Loulie went. She made speedy and elaborate preparations for this expedition and
when she had installed herself in a luxurious suite, she made further preparations, buying herself elaborate tea
gowns that floated elegantly and had long fringe that swung as she moved. She also furnished herself with a
silver tea service and many delicate cups and saucers. Then, she considered that she was prepared to teach the
Faith she loved so well - and she sent out many invitations to tea.

Several weeks went by. Loulie continued to give her teas, but her success was not marked. Guests
came, chattered, listened a moment, nibbled her delicious cakes, drank the delicate tea, and left. Then, one
afternoon a man came, robed in soft gray with a turban on his head and he introduced himself by saying that he
had come from Abdu'l-Baha. So Loulie welcomed him warmly and gave him tea. But, as he reached out to
accept the cup, his sleeve fell back and exposed deeply bitten scars on his wrists. Loulie gasped, "Oh! You have
been hurt."   The man smiled radiantly, "But these are the scars from the chains put upon me when I was in
prison with my Lord," "Oh", said Loulie glancing at her own delicate wrists, "How you must have suffered!"
The man looked at her, astonishment and a kind of radiant amusement in his eyes. "Suffer? When I was in
prison with my Lord? Oh, but every moment was a blissful joy."

After the man had gone, Loulie meditated long and gravely upon these things he had said and she
concluded - looking at her chiffon tea gowns and the silver service - that, apparently, there were things about
this Faith of which she knew little. So she wrote to Abdu'l-Baha telling him this and adding that she was going
to return to New York and study and learn. if she could, some of the things she evidently needed to learn. This
letter to Abdu'l-Baha was put, with other out-going mail, on a small table to be picked up. And while it was
still lying there, waiting to go out, a Tablet came from Abdu'l-Baha in which He said, He was most happy to
know of her decision to go home and study, but she must not be discouraged, for the time would come when
she would be a 'lion roaring through the Cause of God.' ...and of course that time did come and she was that
lion.

Told to many of us by Loulie Mathews

at Temerity c. 1946.

Pamphlets...

In the days when steamships, such as the Mauritania and Franconia, made round-the-world trips,
Loulie went several times for the sole purpose of stopping at each port-of-call to make whatever contacts she
might to proclaim the coming of Baha'u'llah. The Captains of these ships always proved most cooperative,
making every possible effort to be of assistance. So one time when the ship was approaching Manila he came
to her very disturbed. It seemed that because of various delays the stop at Manila would be very much shortened.
In fact, they would dock there only for an hour.

Loulie, who had planned for at least a day or two, at once began to pray for guidance. What, in her
precious hour, could she do that would reach some hungry seeking soul in this city? Finally, when the ship
docked, Loulie rushed to a library but when she asked permission to place books on the shelves she was
refused. There was no place in that library for a new and strange religion. So, in despair - time was passing so
swiftly - she begged that she might go into the shelves and tuck a few pamphlets here and there. This was,
reluctantly, granted her - so back she went to tuck her pamphlets.

Time passed and Loulie returned to New York. Then months later came a letter from Manila her
parnphlets had been discovered; the man who found them had interested friends and where could he get more
literature? Loulie, delighted, sent him more - and more. Then came the war and these new believers were
scattered and, Loulie feared, lost. But no - when Peace came, they found each other, they got in touch with
Loulie again and, once more the Baha'i Community of Manila was thriving. All because Loulie had tucked
pamphlets in a library during one precious hour of pioneering.

Told to us at Temerity
by Loulie Mathews c. 1946

Teach, Teach, Teach...

Dear Elizabeth Cheney tiny, plump, copper haired was one of the first to answer the call to pioneer
in South America. Dedicated and radiant, she went forth to plant the standard of Baha'u'llah, and from the first
she was beset by difficulties. Everything in the world seemed to happen to her. She was ill, funds she had
counted on failed to materialize, the various methods of transportation that were scheduled were either detoured
or failed entirely - but. nothing daunted her. With determination and great courage, she continued to press on.
Finally, she reached the last leg of her journey - a river boat that was to take her to her destination. With relief
and joy, she boarded the boat, only to be awakened close to midnight - the boat had struck submerged rocks and
was sinking. Elizabeth had only time to get out of her stateroom, run on deck and, with the water rising nearly
to her waist, plunge over the rail and into the river. It was pitch dark, moon less, and no stars. The water was
cold. Elizabeth floundered, went under, rose, prayer on her lips and in her heart - and grasped a log that was
floating. A moment later she realized she was not alone grasping the log - another woman spoke to her out of
the darkness. And there, with muddy river water smacking against her face, thick darkness pressing around her,
the wrecked boat sinking lower and lower and the cries of the drowning echoing around her, Elizabeth gave the
Message that she had come pioneering to give - and at the other end of the log her first contact listened.

Told to me by Elizabeth Cheney
during the 1944 Convention at the Temple in Wilmette.

Interactive Guidance...

When Elizabeth Cheney finally reached the end of her journey, further disaster awaited her. She had
been given letters of introduction to various people political leaders, editors, and so on - who, it was hoped,
might be of assistance to her. But, during the course of this delayed journey, there had been a revolution - and
all of the men to whom Elizabeth carried her letters were either in prison or in exile or hiding. She met with
nothing but shrugs and smiles and closed lips. No doors were open to her; she was blocked at every turn. So,
once again, she retired to pray and to meditate.

Then, knowing that prayer must be followed by action, she went out to walk the streets, praying as
she walked for guidance. Her steps were slow and hesitant in order that, when guidance came, she might not be
distracted by her own haste. At last - still with no answer to her prayers that might guide her - she found herself
away from the heart of the city and in a broad avenue lined with spacious lawns and gardens surrounding
beautiful homes. Here her steps slowed and she became aware of her own sharpened attention as if the time had
come for her to listen carefully. And finally her steps stopped completely. There was no further urge to go on.

She stood quite still and looked around her. She was standing beside a tall wrought-iron fence, and
beyond the fence, beyond a low hedge, there was a man, kneeling beside a bed of flowers. Elizabeth - not
knowing what else to do - stood quietly and watched him. She saw him start, as he realized he was being
watched, then he stood up, dusted his knees and walked toward her. And in her halting Spanish Elizabeth heard
herself mentioning the name of one of the men to whom she'd been given a letter. The man showed great
surprise, but Elizabeth went on talking, telling him why she had come - giving him the Message. Finally,
bowing and smiting he left her - and Elizabeth waited. In a few moments the man returned to open the gates
and usher her into the house, where the man to whom her letter was addressed was in careful hiding and was
waiting to receive her. This was the turning point for Elizabeth - from then on her way was easier and her
teaching successful.

Told to me by Elizabeth Cheney
during the 1944 Convention at Wilmette.

Interactive Guidance II

Many years ago, Mable Rice-Wray Ives lived in Baltimore. It was in the far away days of streetcars,
and in order to reach the down-town shopping district, Mable had to ride the streetcar for a long way from the
residential part of the city where she lived. Part of this journey was down a very long hill that, treeless and drab,
was lined with small shops and poor houses.

For years, as a growing girl, Mable had been taking this trip and then, one Spring, she began to be
aware of a strange impulse to get off the trolley car when it was half way down the long hill. This was, of
course, ridiculous. Why would she want to get off the car? There were no cross-streets; she knew no one in the
neighborhood, why would she get off and what would she do if she did get off? So - trip after trip she reasoned
with herself, talking herself out of it and feeling really very foolish. The feeling persisted - she should stop the
car half way down the hill and get off. Finally, after this had been going on for many weeks, she lost patience.
All right - she would stop the car and get off! So, the next time she had occasion to go shopping she did just
that. And, as she stood on the curb watching the trolley car slide down the rest of the hill out of sight, she felt
very silly. So now what she supposed to do? She turned from the curb and found herself facing a small shop
that sold newspapers and magazines and stationary with, maybe, penny candy. Mable, not knowing what else to
do, went over to the shop and walked in.

Behind the counter, there was an older woman with a gentle face and beautiful eyes. She asked Mable if
she might help her. Mable said, helplessly, "I don't know. I don't know what I want. I don't know what I came
for" - and then she found herself telling the woman all about the curious experience she'd had for so long as she
came down the hill on a trolley car. When Mable had finished the woman smiled "I can tell you what you came
for," she said. "Come into my sitting room with me, and I'll tell you the whole wonderful story." And that
was how Mable Ives received the first word she'd ever heard of the wonderful Cause to which, for so many years
and with such selfless courage, she gave her life.

Told to me by Mable at
Green Acre, Summer, 1933.

Character development...

Mable Ives, after she married Howard Colby Ives (my father) became known to many who loved her as
Rizwanea. For very many years, after they were married, my father and Rizwanea traveled and taught the Faith.
It was their entire life. They traveled through the New England states, through Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois,
New York and many many more - always teaching, always leaving an established Assembly behind them. It
was a gypsy life. It meant that never once, during all the years, did they realty have a home; no place where they
might be surrounded by their own things, where they might put down roots. Always they lived surrounded by
strange and alien furniture, by the bare wall and arid atmosphere of barren hotels, boarding houses, and
cubbyholes where they might sleep while, during their waking hours, they earned their living and taught their
beloved Faith.

At last, after many years, with her health failing, Rizwanea felt she could endure no more. She had
come to the end. She must have a home. She needed it with every atom of her being - needed it as a bird needs
to make a nest in the springtime or as anyone, weary and spent, needs to rest in the sun. At this time they - she
and my father were living in a particularly difficult situation. It was a furnished room and the landlady was
constantly complaining of everything they did. They used too many lights, they took too many showers using
up too much water, and the clacking of Father's typewriter was driving her crazy. So, one morning, Rizwanea
told Father how she felt: She had come to the end; she could endure no more; she was unable to go one step
farther. They had a long period of consultation, and at the end, Father told her that, of course, he would do as
she wished, but would she, in turn, do one thing for him? Would she wait just one more day before making a
truly final decision - and would she spend this day in prayer? She agreed. So after Father had left her to go out
and attend to his business details, she kept her promise. She began to pray. And as she prayed, it came to her
just what, in its depth and beauty, submission, detachment, and servitude really meant. And it came to her that
submission - true and complete submission to the Will of God - was the first basic step. So she began to pray
for submission - she prayed and prayed, and finally, submission came to her - but with it came the realization
that submission was not enough.

Well, then, what was enough? What should she pray for now? And she remembered that Baha'u'llah had
written that we must be grateful for the circumstances to which we were submitting. Grateful? Grateful for this
horrid little room? Grateful for the beastly, complaining landlady?

Well, all right - if Baha'u'llah said so she, Rizwanea, would be grateful. But it wasn't easy. She was
pacing the room, thinking, praying, fighting and now she went to the window to stare out into the street.
'Teach me to be grateful! Teach me to be submissive! I will be grateful! I will be submissive! She clenched
her small fists. She fought and she suffered. And, finally, the first warm touch and then the warmer flow of
submissive gratitude surged over her. But, the next moment, she realized that even this was not enough. Not

enough? When she'd fought so hard and she was so tired. What then was left? What should she pray for next?

And it came to her that now she must pray for love. love for her nerve-wracking circumstances; love
for her harsh landlady; love for the whole situation that had led to the crisis - the blessed crisis that had forced
her to learn this lesson. So, now, Rizwanea prayed that she might love that she might be filled with love that
she might be able to pour out this love.

And her prayers were answered. When Father returned to her, it was to meet a radiant woman - a
woman filled with the glory of complete submission to the Will of God - a woman rich with the glory of
gratitude for tests - a woman overflowing with the clear crystal waters of the love of God.

And, for many years more, she poured out these waters for the glory of the Cause she loved so well.

and Howard Colby Ives c. 1936

Gift...

Elizabeth Greenleaf was a tall, aristocratic and very lovely lady who, for very many summers, occupied
the cottage at Green Acre that was known as the tea house. It was in the living room of this cottage that she
told this story. It seems that for a great many years she had longed for a white Baha’i ring-stone. She had never
mentioned this to anyone nor had she mentioned it in her prayers, since it would not have occurred to her to
pray for anything so material as a ring stone, but the wish had been in her heart always. One day, she had
occasion to open an old trunk in her attic that had, for a long time, been closed and locked. And there, lying on
the very top - the first thing to catch her eye as she lifted the lid, was her white ring stone. She had no idea how
it had gotten there - she had never seen it before nor, upon inquiry, had anyone else, but she had it set and wore
it on her slim finger all the rest of her life.

Service...

There are many stories about beloved Grace Robarts Ober who, for so very many years, dedicated every
moment of her life to the service of our glorious Cause. And this experience, she felt, was the 'first small step' -
to use her words, that set her feet on the path.

Grace had been introduced to the Cause by that early dedicated soul, Lua Getzinger, and Grace had, at
once, recognized Baha'u'llah and become a Baha'i. Not long afterward, Lua came to Grace and told her that very
soon Abdu'l-Baha was to arrive in New York and she, Lua, had been asked by Him to go to Chicago and prepare
a place there in which he might stay when he arrived in that city. Would Grace like to go to Chicago with Lua
and help with this preparation? Of course Grace would! So, together, they went to Chicago from Los Angeles,
found a suitable apartment, prepared it and, eventually, Abdu'l-Baha came to live in it.
When His stay in Chicago was nearly over, suddenly one morning Grace realized what it would mean to go
back to the dead stuffiness of her former life and leave this clear and radiant glory in which she'd been living
while she helped Lua keep house for the Master. So she went to Abdu'l-Baha and begged that, when he returned
to New York, she might help with that household too, as she had been privileged to do in Chicago. Abdu'l-Baha
looked at her very searchingly and said, "Greece (His loving nickname for Grace) Greece, are you SURE you
wish to serve ME?" Grace said, with great enthusiasm, "Oh, YES! More than anything else in the world!"
Abdu'l-Baha made no answer but walked away. The next morning this scene was repeated. On the third morning,
Grace, frantic at the realization that this was the last morning before He was leaving to go farther West, went to
Him a third time - and this time He became very stern. Are you VERY SURE you wish to SERVE ME? Grace
was startled at the sternness but she didn't waver. "YES I am VERY SURE." So then he nodded. "Very well
go, settle up your affairs, and we will meet in New York." Jubilant and radiant, Grace settled up her 'affairs' -
which consisted of subletting a cottage she had taken at Greenacre for the summer and doing a few other things.
Then, with wings on her feet, she went to New York. Lua was already there and together they prepared for
Abdu'l-Baha's return. The day came. Many Baha'is had gone to meet Him, though Lua and Grace had remained at
the house to welcome Him. The door opened, He came in. He welcomed Lua warmly, glanced at Grace as at a
complete stranger, and turned away. Grace was appalled, shocked. Hadn't He recognized her? Had He forgotten
her? Had she misunderstood the permission to come to New York? Or had she displeased Him and was this
punishment?

Whatever it was, it continued with no let-up. During all the days that followed Abdu'l-Baha never
showed by word or glance that He recognized her in any way - except to put her to work. Whenever she relaxed
at all throughout any day, word would come at once, through Lua, setting her to work harder at some new task.
She worked in that household until long after midnight - cleaning, cooking, scrubbing, and then she would rise
at five in the morning to begin all over again. She worked as she had never worked before in all her life and
Abdu'l-Baha ignored her completely. If they ever chanced to meet he would draw aside His robe for her to pass

and his glance would go through her as if she were not there.

At last came the day when the movies of Abdu'l-Baha were to be taken over in Brooklyn at the home
of Howard MacNutt. And Grace thought, wearily, "at least I will be included in THIS since EVERYONE
in the household is to go." But, an hour before the several carloads of people were scheduled to leave, Lua
came to Grace to say that Abdu'l-Baha felt that someone should remain at the house to welcome two ladies who
were expected that morning, and Grace was to be the one to stay behind. So when the cars left - Grace stood at
the top of the flight of brownstone steps and watched them all roll away. Then, she turned and went into the
empty house. For a moment she stood there, fighting the feeling of desolation and abandonment and loneliness,
and then she thought of the white roses that had been delivered that morning, as they were daily, for Abdu'l-
Baha's room. The one bright spot in these dreadful days for Grace had been that she was the one to arrange these
roses each morning. So, with the long florists' box in her arms, she climbed up to Abdu'l-Baha's room at the
top of the house, where He had wished to be. She reached the top of the third flight - and found the door not
only closed, but locked against her. And always before it had stood wide open! This, for Grace, was the last
straw. Overwhelmed by all the hurt and bewilderment of all these days, she sank down on the floor and wept
with the fallen roses scattered around her. At last, the sobs faded, her tears spent themselves, and, exhausted, she
gathered up the roses and went back downstairs.

The expected ladies had not arrived, nor did they ever arrive. But Grace - it was now past noon - was
hungry. So, she went down to the kitchen to get something to eat. And in that house that fed, each day, so
many dozens of people, there was nothing to eat but one egg and a small piece of leftover bread in Abdu'l-Baha's
bread-box. (this bread was especially baked for Him by a Persian believer who had begged to come on this
journey just so he might cook Abdu'l-Baha's food). So Grace boiled her one egg and put her small portion of
bread on a plate. Putting the egg in an egg cup, she chipped the shell - and the egg, as bad as an egg can get,
exploded in her face. She cleaned up the mess and returned to her bit of leftover bread. And, as she crumbled the
bread, eating it crumb by crumb she realized, suddenly, exactly what she was doing - she was, blessedly, eating
the crumbs of the bread of life from Abdu'l-Baha's table. She began to eat even more slowly as the spirit of
prayer came to possess her.

Not long after this the household returned from Brooklyn - and that evening Lua came to Grace and
said, "The Master has asked me to tell you that He knows you wept." And this was the first time it had
occurred to Grace that all this dreadful experience might have a reason, a pattern. And - if this were true she
must find out what the reason could be. So she went up to her room to pray about it. To pray for illumination
and wisdom and the selflessness to understand. And as she prayed she heard a small voice saying 'Are you as
happy scrubbing the garbage pails as you are arranging the roses?' And she suddenly realized what the spirit of
true service was. It was to rise to selfless joy in offering the service, no matter what form that service might
take.

And as this truth swept over her, suffusing her, illuminating her, the door opened, and Abdu'l-Baha
walked into the room. His arms were outstretched; His dear face was glorified. "Welcome!" He cried to Grace,
"Welcome to the Kingdom!" And he held her close, embracing her deeply. And never did He withdraw Himself
from her again.

Told to me by Grace Robarts Ober at Green Acre c. 1933
Grace Ober is the aunt of Hand of the Cause of God John Robarts.

Marriage...

It was not long after this that Lua came to Grace and told her that it was the wish of Abdu'l-Baha that
she marry Harlan Ober. Grace was shocked. 'Why I don't really know that man! I've only met him a few times
and that very casually. Besides - I'm almost engaged to someone else. He's asked me and I'm I'm making up my
mind. How could I think of marrying Harlan Ober? Lua smiled, "I'm only repeating Abdu'l-Baha's request,"
she said gently. So Grace quickly put the idea out of her mind. The next morning Lua came the second time to
deliver the same message. Again Grace dismissed it all as being utterly fantastic. The third morning when Lua
came she added her own remarks to the message. "You'd better really consider this, Grace Abdu'l-Baha does not
make suggestions lightly." Grace, this time, realized how serious this was. 'But what does He want me to do?
Write to Harlan Ober, whom I scarcely know - and propose to him? How could I? Oh, Lua I do want to be
obedient but how on earth can I? Lua hugged her and patted her consolingly. "Ill do it," she said. "I know
Harlan very well - it was through me he came into the Faith. I can do this easily." So Lua wrote to Harlan -
and Harlan, radiant at the thought that he was obeying a suggestion of his beloved Master, took the next train to
New York from Boston where he lived. He came at once to see Grace and together they went walking through
Central Park where he proposed and Grace, still. dazed.and uncertain, accepted - because it was the will of
Abdu'l-Baha.

The next morning they were called into Abdu'l-Baha's bedroom. And. Abdu'l-Baha was there, with one
or two others, waiting to perform the marriage ceremony. Grace remembered, afterward, entering the room. She
remembered the look of warm love on Abdu'l-Baha's face; she remembered the bands of sunlight on the floor and
the bowls of roses on the tables and the next thing she was aware of was lying on a couch with Harlan bending
above her asking if she felt better. She then discovered that the marriage had been performed - a marriage that,
with no faltering, she had gone through with Harlan at her side then, when it was over, she had swayed a little
and they had suggested she lie down. Abdu'l-Baha, smiling and serene, was watching her with great love
knowing perfectly well how overcome with the spiritual force of these great moments she had been and
knowing that the whole experience only proved her great spiritual susceptibility and capacity.

So were Grace Robarts and Harlan Ober married by Abdu'l-Baha. Later that same day they were married
again by the laws of New York when Howard Colby Ives performed the legal ceremony.

Wheel chair Pioneer...

Five years after Grace told me these stories she went on an extensive teaching trip through the near-
southern states. For three of these five years she had been very ill - most of the time very close to the Open
Door. Finally, when she was beginning to convalesce, she was sent, by a generous and devoted sister-Baha'i, to
a large convalescent home. This was at the time of our beloved Guardian's first call for pioneers to South
America - a call that Grace, until this time, had been too ill to comprehend. But now she did comprehend, and
all the way to the convalescent home she prayed from the depths of her hungry soul that she might, in some
way, be able to respond to the Guardian's call.
She arrived at the home and discovered that, that very evening, a masquerade was planned to celebrate
Valentine's Day. Grace at once began to plan a costume for herself. She was very ingenious and clever about
such things, and she was delighted that, so soon, she might have an opportunity of meeting her fellow guests -
and maybe giving the Message- who knew? Eagerly she began to dress. She was powdering her nose in the
bathroom when she fell. Whether she slipped or whether she fainted she herself was not sure. But when they
found her she was lying unconscious - and unable to walk. She was put to bed and there was no party for her
that night. And the next day when she finally went down stairs to meet people she met them from a wheel
chair. And the people she met were from Chile and Argentina and Peru and Brazil! All the countries she had so
longed to pioneer in - all the countries her beloved Guardian had said should be given the Message. So Grace
being Grace, saw the beautiful joke that had been played on her - and she began to laugh. And all the people
said, "Why, Mrs. Ober, how can you laugh when this dreadful thing has happened to you?" And Grace said,
"Because I am a Baha’i do you know what that means?" Of course they didn't so she told them. And from her
wheel-chair she did her pioneering in South America and these people from Chile and Argentina and Peru and
Brazil, took the Message home with them together with all the literature Grace gave them.

To The LIGHT. . .

It was a short time after Grace told me this story that she went on the teaching trip through the near-
southern states that I mentioned above. The teaching trip ended in time for her to reach Wilmette and attend the
Convention in the spring of 1938. It was a very radiant Convention and the report Grace gave of her teaching
trip was one of the high points of it because Grace herself was so radiant and filled with the glory of the great
privilege of teaching. She stood there, before the crowded hall in the foundation of the temple, filled with the
great glory that shone from her and, closing her report, she uttered a tremendous clarion call for pioneers and for
teachers. Then she walked down to resume her seat amongst the delegates. But on her way she paused beside
Harlan, who had just been reelected to our National Spiritual Assembly. "I want to congratulate you now" she
whispered, "I may not have time later", They smiled at each other with the perfect understanding that had
always existed between them. Then Grace slipped into her own seat. As she sat down her head drooped slightly
and those glancing at her assumed she was lost in prayer. But when she made no movement for many moments
someone touched her someone realized something was wrong Edris Rice-Wray and Katherine True both moved
forward - and Grace was gone - gone through her Open Door - gone on her beautiful journey to the arms of
Abdu'l- Baha - (Both Edris Rice-Wray and Katherine True are doctors).

Unstated invitation...

Harry Randall, the brother of Loulie Mathews, was a man of wealth and affairs. He had been a
classmate of Harlan Ober at Harvard and so, when Harlan learned of the Faith and became a Baha'i, he very soon
gave the Message to Harry, only to discover that, busy and occupied as he was with his manifold affairs, Harry
Randall's interest went no farther than a polite and courteous response, which was far from satisfactory to
Harlan. He persisted in trying to interest Harry further and when Abdu'l-Baha was to come to Boston, Harlan
grew more and more pressing: Harry must go to hear Abdu'l-Baha speak; Harry must meet Him; Harry really
owed it to himself not to miss this wonderful opportunity. Finally, Harry still uninterested, but courteously
anxious to please this eager friend of his, agreed to go with Harlan to hear Abdu'l-Baha.

Ruth - Harry's wife would not be able to go with him since she was a semi invalid, in and out of
sanitariums for tuberculosis a great part of the time. Just then she had come home from one of these hospitals
but she was far too frail to do anything but rest quietly at home.

Harlan and Harry Randall went to the meeting together and after it was over, Harlan insisted upon taking Harry
to meet Abdu'l-Baha. Harry. still uninterested but always courteous, did as Harlan wished, and what was his
astonishment when Abdu'l-Baha warmly accepted an invitation to have tea the following afternoon at Harry's
home! An invitation Harry had in no way extended. Appalled, Harry asked Harlan what on earth he should do
about it? Harlan said. "Give a tea for Him what else can you do?" "But how can I? Ruth is ill. I'm busy. How
on earth - ?" Harlan laughed, "You don't know Abdu'l-Baha or you'd know there's some sort of reason for this,
and it'll get done. You have a houseful of servants - let them brew a cup of tea for the Master and invite a few
friends in to share it." So this is what Harry did and the next afternoon when Abdu'l-Baha arrived at the lovely
suburban home he found quite a group of people assembled on a wide verandah to receive Him. Ruth Randall,
delicate and lovely, was also there, seated in a far corner where she might be safe from any draft. And it was to
her, ignoring all the others, that Abdu'l-Baha strode, His white aba billowing with the swiftness of His tread;
His beautiful eyes filled with light and love. Reaching her He bent above her, murmuring "My daughter My
dear daughter" and lovingly He rested His hands on her shoulders Then He turned and, smilingly, met all the
other guests.

The following day, Ruth had an appointment with her doctor, who had examined her the previous week
and had said that it might be necessary for her to return to the sanitarium for further treatment. He would be
sure after he had seen her again. Ruth went to this appointment fearfully she was so longing to remain at
home, so very reluctant to be sent again to the hospital. The doctor examined her - and was amazed. What had
she been doing? What could have happened to her? She was healed. There was not the least trace left of the
tuberculosis. Of course, this was an experience that neither Harry nor Ruth could ignore, so it was the
beginning of their long and glorious life-time of teaching and serving the Cause they came to love so well.

Interactive guidance III

Harry Randall, once he had leaped the hurdle and become a Baha'i was a very enthusiastic one. When
Harlan told him about 'guidance' - what a mystery it was, and how earnestly Harlan himself was trying to
understand and live under it Harry, too, began to try to apply it. One afternoon he started out to take a walk
and, in an effort to understand this guidance that Harlan talked about, Harry paused at each cross street and corner
praying that he might be urged in whatever direction it might be that God wished him to take. He walked and
walked, the city streets gave way to country roads and still he walked. At some corners he was moved to turn; at
some he went straight ahead. But he felt no urge to stop he felt strongly that he should keep going. Finally, at
the end of the afternoon, he came to a small white house surrounded by a picket fence - and here, with his hand
on the gate, he knew this was the house he had been led to; this was the end of his walk. So he opened the gate,
went up the short path and knocked at the door. A woman opened the door and, giving him one look, called
back over her shoulder, 'John, John he's come!'

It seems that the night before, this woman had had a dream in which she had gone to open her door to
one who knocked - a man who had come into her house and told her something that was so exciting and
wonderful that when she woke up - though she couldn't remember what the exciting and wonderful thing had
been - she was still so excited she'd told her husband about it. And then Harry had knocked - Harry had come
into her house and Harry had told her about Baha'u'llah and given her the wonderful Message for the New Day.

If Poverty...

Harry Randall, for all the years of his life, was a devoted servant of the Cause, giving generously of his
great wealth, and giving as much time as he was able to, with his tremendous duties and responsibilities
connected with his world of finance and business. Then came the Wall Street Crash in 1929 - and Harry's wealth
was largely swept away. But Harry, struggling to rise above this tidal wave and to recoup his fortune from the
ruin was still very busy with his affairs. Then, a few years later, he became paralyzed and was confined to a
wheel chair. And now, stripped of his wealth and all forms of activity, Harry Randall became entirely a man of
soul and spirit. The last summer he spent at Green Acre was a summer of light and radiance and glory. He sat
on the wide verandah radiating all the illumination with which he was filled and to those privileged to be there
that summer, the mere sight of Harry Randall. was a bounty indeed. It was, as Grace Ober said, "An
unforgettable experience it was like looking at the pure spirit of all the Prophets." It was the beautiful
preparation for his death which came not long after.

O SON OF MAN!

Hidden words of Baha'u'llah Arabic # 53.

Green Acre...

The story of Green Acre itself is intensely interesting. The beautiful property the rolling meadows, the
dear wide-verandahed Inn and, now, all the cottages surrounding it, together with the Tea House at the entrance
leading from the highway and, farther down the road, the gracious Fellowship House - rises above the Piscataque
River, the River of Light. And it was originally owned by Miss Sarah J. Farmer who was present at the
Chicago Exposition in 1893 when, as we all know, the first mention of the Baha'i Revelation was made at the
Congress of Religions. Miss Farmer became deeply interested in this matter of comparative religions and from
that time was inspired to establish a summer school on this property of hers which became later our beloved
Green Acre. In the summer of 1904 the brilliant and deeply loved Persian teacher, Abu'l Fadl, taught there and,
of course, Abdu'l-Baha was there for some time during the summer of 1912.

But before this, before the property became definitely Baha'i property, there had been a good deal of
contention and difficulty. Miss Farmer, after a few years spent in listening to the various speakers she brought
to her summer school, realized that what the world longed for and what all peoples needed was One Universal
Faith - and the Baha'i Revelation was the only answer to this problem. So, radiantly and with great certainty,
she became a Baha'i. And this was all very well until she announced that she had made her will leaving her
property to the Baha'is. Then her family rose in outrage and fury. They demanded that she change her will in
their favor. She refused. At which they declared her insane and clapped her into an insane asylum.

When the Baha'is heard of this, there was great consternation and horror and grief. That such a dreadful
thing could happen to this great and wonderful woman was simply past all belief. But it had happened and
something, certainly, must be done about it. They tried to have her released but her family had consigned her,
and only her family could release her, and this they refused to do. Then, an appeal was made to have Miss
Farmer examined by atieniate to establish her sanity but this, too, could not be done. Other attempts were made
- but there was no step that was not balked at by the Farmer family. Finally, in desperation, three Bahais
(Harlan Ober and Montfort Milts were two of them) engineered a most dramatic rescue involving a ladder that
took them over the high wall surrounding the insane asylum where Miss Farmer was incarcerated and then
another tall ladder leading to her room. She had been told what to expect and she was waiting to be carried down
and away.

In the Ober home, Grace also was waiting for the return of the rescuers and the rescued. In the dark
hours of the early morning they all arrived and there was great rejoicing.

Eventually, of course, there was great hubbub and fury raised by the Farmer family and finally, they
dragged the Baha'is into court to have the matter legally settled. The case was brought by John Mitchell who

was a most brilliant lawyer and who, at that point, had never lost a case. The Baha'is were represented by
Montfort Mills, and the Bah'is won. They won the freedom and safety of their radiant and devoted sister Sarah
Farmer and they won Green Acre.

Deserving boots...

It was at the home of the Kinneys that Abdu'l-Baha stayed the second time he came to New York and it
was from this home that He left to return to Haifa. The day before He was to take ship to leave He asked Mr.
Kinney if there was something amongst His belongings that He might offer as a gift of farewell. At first, Mr.
Kinney was reluctant to choose, but finally he admitted that well, might he be given a pair of Abdu'l-Baha's
boots? Those boots that had sheltered the feet that walked with such serene certainty upon the Path of God? Mr.
Kinney would cherish these above all else.

So, with smiling love, Abdu'l-Baha gave a pair of His boots to Edward Kinney. Reverently and
joyfully, Mr. Kinney laid them in a bureau drawer in his bedroom, carefully wrapped in a nest of tissue paper.
Very rarely - since the boots were such an intimate and precious thing, were they shown to anyone though Mr.
Kinney touched them frequently as he prayed.

Then one day, he did wish to show them to someone. He went to the bureau, pulled out the drawer -
and the boots were gone - completely gone. No sign of them in the tissue paper, no sign of them in any other
drawer, no sign of them in any part of the room which was searched carefully. There simply were no boots
anywhere.

So Dad Kinney (he bacame 'Dad to all the hundreds who loved him) began to pray and he prayed,
shaken, from the depths of his troubled soul. Why had the beloved boots been taken from him? Where had they
gone? What could have happened? Was he had he become - unworthy to possess them? And, at last, he knew
this was it. He was no longer worthy to hold the precious boots. Then why was he no longer worthy? What
had he done between the time when he had last held the boots in his hands and the moment when he had
discovered their absence?

It had been, he estimated, some two, possibly three weeks. So in deepest meditation, he went back,
day by day, hour by hour, moment by moment over this period. He remembered his actions; he analyzed his
motives; he reviewed his thoughts. And suddenly, in a blaze of illumination, he knew what it was. Deeply
selfish materialism; clouded hypocritical motives; unjust actions. He had been guilty of all these. But he had
deluded himself by calling them such fair and pretty names. No wonder the boots had been taken away. In all
justice he had proved himself in no way worthy to hold such treasure. Humbled and ashamed, he prayed abjectly
for forgiveness - and then, mournfully, he went to the bureau drawer - just to touch the tissue paper that once
had protected the boots. And lo! the boots had returned. They were there, real and tangible; the leather soft
beneath his fingertips, the well-worn soles smooth to his touch. They were there, but the warning was never
forgotten - the lesson was well learned.

Told to me by Edward Kinney in New York 1937

May waits for Thomas...

One of the most beautiful stories we have is the one of May Maxwell (the mother of Ruhiyyih
Khanum) and Thomas Breakwell. This was in the very early days, when Abdu'l-Baha was still a prisoner in
Acca and May Maxwell was a young girl probably (judging by the dates available to me) 1905. The story was
told to me by my father and by May Maxwell herself, but in this account, I am paraphrasing May Maxwell's
own words to be found in the Star of the West.

She herself is not certain of the exact date though she will never forget the details. It happened in the
Spring when May's mother and brother were planning to leave Paris for Brittany and of course they wished May
to accompany them. But Abdu'l- Baha had requested that she remain in Paris so, upon her mother's insistence,
she wrote to Abdu'l-Baha for His permission to leave. This was refused. He wished her to remain in Paris. So,
finally May's mother and brother left without her and she went to stay with a friend.

It was not long after this that a Mrs. Milner, who had just arrived from America, brought a young
man whom she had met on shipboard to meet May. In May's own words:

"I shall never forget opening the door and seeing him standing there. It was like looking at a veiled
light. I saw at once his pure heart, his burning spirit, his thirsty soul, and over all was cast the veil which is
over every soul until it is rent asunder by the power of God in this day."

Mrs. Milner introduced him as a young man interested in spiritual things, who was at the moment a
Theosophist. They stayed only a short time, but as he was leaving, he said that Mrs. Milner had mentioned
some teaching that May was interested in and might he call again to hear about it? He returned the next morning
and May, realizing his great capacity, gave him the full Message - which he accepted completely and instantly.
Three days later he wrote to Abdu'l-Baha saying with great simplicity, "My Lord! I believe; forgive me. Thy
servant, Thomas Breakwell."

"That evening", writes May, "I went to the Rue du Bac to get my mail and found a cablegram which
had just arrived saying, 'You may leave Paris.' and signed Abbas."

May continues, "I could write you pages about the beloved Thomas Breakwell; of the fire of love
burning in his heart when he returned from Acca; of the penetrating spiritual power in our midst; of the light of
servitude and sacrifice which burned so brilliantly in his soul... I only want to add that his kindness and love to
my mother... produced a great effect on her... before she understood the glory of this Cause."

And, in the same issue of Star of the West, is Abdu'l- Baha's tablet to Breakwell which follows:

"Do not lament over the departure of my dearly-beloved Breakwell. For verily, he has ascended to the
Luminous Rose-Garden of the ABHA Kingdom, near the mercy of his Lord, the Almighty, and is crying out
with the loudest voice, 0 thee my people know how my Lord hath forgiven me, and made me one of those who
have attained the meeting of God!"

"0 Breakwell! my beloved! Where is thy beautiful countenance and where is thy eloquent tongue?

Where is thy radiant brow and where thy brilliant face?"

"0 Breakwell! my beloved! Where is thy enkindlement with the Fire of the love of God, and where is
thy attraction to the Fragrances of God? Where is thy utterance for the glorification of God, and where is thy
rising in the service of God?"

"0 my dear! 0 Breakwell! Verily thou hast abandoned this transitory world, and soared upward to the
Kingdom, hast attained to the Grace of the Invisible Realm, and sacrificed thyself to the Threshold of the Lord
of Might!

"O my adored one! 0 Breakwell! Verily thou hast left behind this physical lamp, this human glass,
these earthly elements and this worldly enjoyment."

"0 my adored one! 0 Breakwell Then thou hast ignited a light in the Glass of the Supreme Concourse,
hast entered into the Paradise of ABHA; art protected under the shade of the Blessed Tree, and hast attained to the
meeting (of the True One) in the abode of Paradise.

> "

0 my dearly-beloved! 0 Breakwell.' Thou hast been a divine bird, and forsaking thy earthly nests thou
hast soared toward the Holy Rose-Gardens of the Divine Kingdom and obtained a Luminous Station there! "

"

0 my dearly-beloved! 0 Breakwell! Verily thy Lord has chosen thee for His love, guided thee to the Court of
His Holiness; caused thee to enter into the Rizwan of His Association and granted thee to behold His Beauty!"

The Meeting...

Howard Colby Ives (my father) first heard of the Faith through Clarence Moore (the father of Emily
Kalantar) and, from the very first mention, he was skeptically reluctant to put such faith in this wonderful
Message. For years he had put his faith in various things and in the end, found that faith betrayed. In his
search, he had become a Unitarian minister and was, at the time of his meeting with Clarence Moore,
becoming, as he had before with other beliefs, disillusioned and unhappy within the confinement of a dogma.
So he was not about to pin this tattered hope of his to any new masthead only to have it torn down once more.
He and Clarence had many hours of discussion, but Father, longing so desperately to find the Truth that would,
for all eternity, prove itself to be unflawed and real, refused to be moved from his stand of doubt and fearfulness.
'It is a beautiful Message", he told Clarence, "It is a beautiful dream. It is good that you and others are able to
dream it. But I - I have dreamed too much and too often and the awakening has always been too bitter. I cannot
dream again and wake again." It was too painful for him even to contemplate.

Then came the Spring when Abdu'l-Baha was arriving in New York. And, Clarence, radiant, said,
"Howard, you must meet Him and I am sure all will be well with you." Father refused. "What good would it
do?" he asked. "We would be lost in a vast crowd of people. He would be wholly concerned with his audience I
would be lucky if I glimpsed the top of his turban. What would be the use? Now if I might meet Him face to
face - if we might commune heart-to-heart - alone with no one to interrupt, Ah, then we might truly meet."
Father's tone betrayed his hope - but Clarence sighed and shook his head. "No one meets Abdu'l-Baha alone - it
is necessary that all His words be recorded; He is always accompanied by His secretaries and friends."

But, in spite of this attitude of Father's Clarence persisted, and finally he brought Montfort Mills to
add his persuasion - and between them they finally managed to bring Father to the Hotel Ansonia, where at that
time Abdu'l-Baha was staying. And it was exactly as Father had imagined it to be. The living room of the suite
was crowded, there was barely room to stand and the air was filled with chatter. Father, disgusted that he had
permitted himself to be talked into such a hopeless hubbub and realizing a fresh the absurdity of even thinking
he'd discover any truth in all the confusion, walked over to a window and looked down on the Broadway traffic.
It was then he heard a door open and turned. A door had opened and in the doorway stood a Persian who, as he
caught Father's eye, beckoned to him. Father hesitated         this was not possible, the man was, of course,
beckoning to someone else. But he beckoned again, unmistakably, and Father moved across the room and
entered the doorway.

It was Abdu'l-Baha's bedroom that he stepped into and, as Father crossed the threshold, everyone in the
room left by another door, Father and Abdu'l-Baha were alone. For a moment they stood and looked at each
other then Abdu'l-Baha opened his arms and Father walked into them, "My son my very dear son" - murmured
Abdu'l-Baha and embraced him deeply. Then He motioned to a chair and Father sat down. Abdu'l-Baha sat down

close by. Nothing at all was said, The moments flowed by. Occasionally Abdu'l-Baha reached out and patted
Fathers knee, gently and lovingly. And Father sat there. Later he said, "I knew then that I had found all and
more than I was seeking - I had found a Man for the first time in my life who was truly possessed of the Pearl
of Great Price, I had found flowing all around me and pouring through me, the infinite peace of which I had
dreamed for all my life long." In that long sweet silence in the presence of the Master my Father had been given
the bounty of deep, unshakable, unquestioning, everlasting Faith.

And for all the remaining years of his life he dedicated every breath he drew to sharing this Faith with
everyone he met.

Told to me by Father first in 1912

and countless times later.

Stories of Abdu'l-Baha as told by Mother

Introduction

Abdu'l-Baha, in appearance, was a man of medium height though to all who met Him, He gave the
impression of such majesty that He seemed much taller. His beard was flowing and white; His head covering,
whether a turban or tarboosh, was white also. But, meeting Him, none of these details were even noticed. It was
only the spirit one felt and the outpouring love. Love filled Him and flowed out from Him to bathe and
encompass everyone in His presence.

He was, as we all know, the Mystery of God. His Station is unique. There has been no one like Him in
any past religious era, nor will there ever be such in the future. Baha'u'llah had bestowed upon Him the
assurance of God's guidance in His explanations of anything in the Teachings that needed clarifying for the
believers and, when He was but ten years old, His Father, Baha'u'llah, addressed Him and referred to Him as 'the
Master.'

He was the perfect Exemplar of the Baha'i Teachings: He lived by prayer and wished only to be known as
'Abdu'l-Baha the servant of the servants. He made no mistakes.

Yet, with all this, He needed, as we all need, the constant attitude of prayer to renew and revivify Him,
and, urging us ever upward. His constant adjuration was, "Do as I do. Be as I am.

Stories of Abdu'l-Baha as told by Mother

Repetition

When He was here in America in 1912 He spoke in many places and, as we read these talks in the
Promulgation of Universal Peace, it is very often noticeable how much He repeats Himself, approaching the
point He wishes to make from many angles. One evening a woman, after telling Him how much she had
enjoyed His Talk, complained of this. He smiled at her gently.

"And what is it I repeat?" He asked.

Of course she couldn't tell Him.

Golden rain...

Abdu'l-Baha was so filled with love and the reflected Glory of God, the heritage from His Father,
> Baha'u'llah, that it radiated from Him like light from a lighthouse. Sometimes this was visible. Nina
> Mattieson told this story that Lady Blomfield had told her. Abdu'l-Baha was speaking from the pulpit of a
> church in London and Lady Blomfield, sitting toward the back of the congregation, clearly saw broad rays of
> golden light pouring from Him over the people. But she noticed a strange thing: The Golden Rain - as she
> thought of it afterward - avoided some people completely, while others it flooded in illumination.

Not yet known.

At the time of Abdu'l-Baba's second visit to Newark, He spoke in my Father's Brotherhood Church in
Jersey City. My father had begged Him to do this, and at once Abdu'1-Baha had consented, but He would set no
date. Father was eager and anxious that a date be definitely set, partly because the Master was to leave New
York again - this time for California, and partly because he knew from experience that to have a successful
meeting required publicity and announcements and invitations, all of which took time. So he began pressing
Abdu'1-Baha for the date. Each time the Master would smile gently, pause a moment (to consult some inner
knowledge?) then, shaking His head, would murmur "It is not yet known." Father, a not-too-patient man, urged
in every way he could but he got nothing more. And the date of 'Abdu'1-Baha's departure was approaching.
Suddenly, early in one week, He announced He would speak the following Sunday. Father was frantic. Only
four or five days to publicize such an important event. But, to his astonishment, there was plenty of time.
Doors opened swiftly, one after the other, and when that Sunday evening came the large hall that Father had

Stories of Abdu'l-Baha as told by Mother

rented for his Brotherhood Church was completely filled with the overflow standing along the back.

Of course 'Abdu'l-Baha spoke about brotherhood. True- brotherhood that transcended national boundaries
and religious customs and practices and paid no heed to the unimportant surface differences of skin color. For of
what importance were these when it was the Soul of a man that mattered in its relationship to the Spirit of
God? And if this true brotherhood were practiced throughout the world if each man truly loved his brother more
than he loved himself, considering his brother's welfare far more than his own, Mankind would truly become
mature, and the Kingdom of God on earth would become a fact. And wasn't this the essence of Baha'u'llah's
Message? Wasn't this the reason why He had endured the persecutions, the exiles, and the imprisonments? To
announce to mankind the dawning of this great New Day - the rolling up of the Old World Order and the
glorious unrolling of this New World Order under the aegis of Baha'u'llah - the Glory of God?

Translation...

And sometimes this great love and glory was strongly felt. There is the story of the coal miner in
> California who had walked many miles to meet Abdu'l-Baha Who, of course spoke that evening as He always
> did through an interpreter. The coal miner became more and more impatient. Finally, unable to stand it any
> longer, he leaned toward the man sitting next to him. "Why does that man continually interrupt the Master?"
> he asked. The man explained, "Abdu'l-Baha is speaking in Persian it must, be translated." "Translated!" the
> coal miner was outraged. "Nothing Abdu'l-Baha says needs translating - anybody can understand Him."

Dedication

> Then there is the story about our dear Fujita his wiry little Japanese-American body so radiating joy and love -
> his smile like a veritable explosion of the spirit. Fujita met 'Abdu'1-Baha in Cleveland, Ohio. At that time
> Fujita was a medical student but the moment he met the Master he was one no longer. He dropped his studies,
> his former life, everything to follow Him. He followed from Cleveland to Chicago and finally to California
> and eventually to New York and Haifa where, for fifty years, he made and kept those beautiful gardens even

At the zoo

When Abdu'l-Baha was first in Chicago it, was Spring and He was eager to go to the zoo. He had never
seen a large city zoo, and He was very merry over the prospect. Then it was explained to Him that, this being

the Spring of the year, most of the animal-mothers would be bearing litters and, at the first approach of a
stranger, they'd rush their babies into safe hiding. This did not perturb Abdu’l-Baha at all. He wanted to go
anyhow. So a group of five or six of the Friends took Him. He motioned to them to stay a little behind and He
went forward all alone. And, as He approached each cage, the small animal-mother brought out all her babies to
show Him, then hurried them back to safety and protection from the following Friends.

Questions not asked...

Once Abdu'l-Baha asked His Father, Baha’u’llah why it was He had never clearly designated the language
that was to become universal. And Baha'u'llah said, very simply, "Because no one ever asked Me." This answer
has always filled me with a sense of frustrated awe. To think that the opportunity was given mankind to learn
the answers to questions that had puzzled him since the beginning of time to have the mysteries of the universe
solved! If only he had asked the questions and known the right questions to ask.

Books

A Pilgrim once told me that she had asked the Guardian why so few of the books of Baha'u'llah had been
translated into English. Shoghi Effendi smiled at her lovingly and said it would be many years before the books
we of the West had would be truly and deeply studied - when that happened more would be given us.

Study, study, study

Which brings to mind the story told me of a newly declared believer, radiant and eager to serve. He wrote
Abdu'l-Baha asking what he should do. Abdu'l-Baha told him to study the Teachings. Eighteen years later the
man wrote again to the Master saying that for several hours each day for the eighteen years he had studied the
Teachings and what should he do now? Promptly Abdu'l-Baha wrote and told him to go and study the
Teachings. This was an East Indian Baha’i where, now, the Faith is truly roaring.

Sow the seeds...

And there is another story concerning India. Once, in the early days, Abdu'l-Baha sent an eager believer
there to 'sow the seed, deliver the Message.' The man went, and two years later returned very discouraged. "I
have sown the seed. I have delivered the Message through the length end breadth of India and they will not
listen. Not one single soul has declared his belief in Baha'u'llah! What shall I do now?" And Abdu'l-Baha.said
rather sternly, "Go back and sow the seeds. I did not tell you to gain believers. I told you to sow the seeds,"

A book

On one of His visits to New York He stayed with Juliet Thompson on West 10th Street not far
from Fifth Avenue. Two or three doors away and across the street, the poet Khalil Gibran was staying with
friends. He and Abdu'l-Baha had met in Syria so now they met again. Gibran said that he believed in everything
Baha’u’llah had taught, but that he would never declare himself as a Baha'i because he had his own message to
give to mankind and he wished this to remain clearly his. However, said Gibran, he would like to do something
for Abdu'l-Baha - so what might he do? "Abdu'l-Baha was pleased and said, very good - go write me a book and
the famous Jesus, Son of Man by Khalil Gibran's was that book. . . .

This story was told to me by Hammideh Khan whose father, Ali Kuli Khan had been told it by
Abdu'l-Baha, Himself.

Obedience and trust

Every thing He did or said taught someone something: but He warned, "Listen to and obey the first
thing I say - for that is what is best for you. If, however, I find you reluctant, I soften and reduce My request till
I arrive at a burden that, you feel, suits the strength of your shoulders. But My first request would not have been
beyond your strength - if you had only trusted Me." Shoghi Effendi repeated this and it seems the Universal
House of Justice functions on the same principle.

Charity

With all of His spiritual knowledge and vision Abdu'l-Baha was extremely practical. On His third
visit to New York He stayed with the Kinneys at their home on West End Avenue. This was only one block
from Riverside Drive, where, often, He would walk. One late afternoon He came back with his snowy 'aba'
wrapped close around Him and He was laughing. It seemed that on the Drive, he had come across a poor man
whose trousers were literally in rags. So Abdu'l-Baha had taken him behind some thick shrubbery where quickly
He had taken off his own trousers, stripped the rags from the man, and got him decently clothed. How amazed
that poor man must have been. And how amused Abdu'l-Baha, who, with his aba wrapped tight around him to
hide his trouser less condition came home laughing.

Lover of truth

It was some years before this, when Abdu'l-Baha was in Paris, that a group of men from Teheran came
to Him deeply troubled, They had walked all the way from their homes in Persia - since traveling on foot was
the only proper way to meet their Master - to make what they considered a most vital request. In a village, there
was a Baha'i who was causing a great deal of trouble because of the lies he told. He lied about everything with

the result that misunderstandings, distrust and confusion reigned. This dreadful situation, Abdu'l-Baha would,
they begged, have to do something about. Abdu'l-Baha agreed; indeed it was a most dreadful situation and
certainly He would do something about it. He would write the man a letter. And the salutation at, the heading of
this letter was, "0 thou great lover of Truth" (Sadly there is no record I have seen of the balance of this Epistle -
which must have been priceless.)

Detachment

As an example of the methods of Abdu'l-Baha's teaching: My father was having difficulty
understanding this matter of Detachment. Just what were we supposed to become detached from? We were taught
not to become isolated and detached as were the monks in a monastery. It was also an obligation to work and
support those dependent upon us. So where did detachment fit into this picture? One day Father asked Abdu'l-
Baha about all this. They were walking up Broadway after a meeting and Abdu'l-Baha made no answer. After
walking a few blocks, Father repeated his question. Still no answer. They reached 76th Street, where the
Kinneys lived and turned left to West End Avenue. As they mounted the outside steps, Father asked for the
third time. Abdu'l-Baha reached the front door, opened it, and started up the inner stair to His room, Father
pattering along after. They reached the second floor, and turned on up to the third, Father following doggedly.
Abdu'l-Baha entered His room with Father close on His heels. And there the Master turned. "Mistair Ives," He
asked gently, "Are you interested in detachment?" Father, his face scarlet, was silent. He couldn't say he was
and he wouldn't say he wasn't.

In His foot steps

There are many stories of Lua Getsinger. This one was told me by Grace Ober, who heard it from Lua
herself. It happened on one of Lua's several visits to Acca and Haifa when she and Abdu'l-Baha were walking
together on the beach. Lua dropped behind slightly and began fitting her small feet, into His much larger foot
prints. After a few moments the Master turned to ask what she was doing. "I am following in your footsteps,"
said Lua. He,turned away and they walked on. A few moments later, He turned again, "Do you wish to follow
in my foot steps?" He asked. "Oh, yes," said Lua. They walked on - and Abdu'l-Baha turned again, "Lua! Do
you wish to follow in my foot steps?" His tone was louder and stern. "Oh, yes," said Lua again. Then, the third
time he stopped and faced her. "Lua!" it was almost a shout, "Do you wish to follow in My foot steps?" "Oh,
yes!" said Lua for the third time - and with that, a great tarantula jumped out from a hillock of sand and bit her
ankle. Abdu'l-Baha saw this and paid no attention, turning away and again walking. Lua followed, still fitting
her footsteps into His. Her ankle swelled, the pain became excruciating, till, finally, she sank down with the
agony of it. Then Abdu'l-Baha picked her up and carried her to the ladies quarters, where the Greatest Holy Leaf
put her to bed. The agony increased. Lua's temperature flamed; delirium set in. Finally, the Greatest Holy Leaf
could stand it no longer and she implored Abdu'l-Baha to heal her. He examined her carefully then laid His

hands gently on her forehead. The temperature drained away, her head cleared she was healed. And it was only
later that it was explained to her that she had been suffering from a strange and virulent condition of her blood
which the bite of the tarantula had cured.
