Introduction

This collection began as extended research for a play composed in draft
> form five years ago. The play was inspired by the story of Fred Murray as
> told by Howard Harwood in a pamphlet. It resulted in a short poem and a
> correspondence with Howard Harwood, which lasted right up until his passing.
98                                                   Australian Bahá’í Studies, Vol. 2, 2000   Uncle Fred Murray Extracts from a compilation of tributes, photographs and stories   99

It also resulted in a few kind Bahá’ís sending me their stories, an interview
with Madge Williams, meeting Betty Hindson, and being in touch with her
on a regular basis.

Several times I have tried to write the script of Fred Murray’s life, and
ended up wanting to research more of the history of his life. As a result I have
ended up with a compilation of memories, of stories gathering in the process
of the desire to bring such a story to life- and several unanswered questions.

The image I have of this play is that it will consist of the people whom
Uncle Fred had touched, entering a museum. Into that museum comes a big
light that indicates such a story does not belong in an archive or in a few
peoples unrecorded memories but they must tell the story. They then escape
the museum to live and tell us the story.

So out comes the foster mother, the young George, brother of Fred, the
Crowder brothers, Tindale, Howard and Myrtle, Collis, his wife Winnie, his
son Fred Junior and others characters as well as Fred himself, to help build
a picture for us.

Enacted before us are some of the scenes of these stories, we are in the
outback, along the River, in Rome, Paris, London, Murray Bridge, the House
of Worship….

Excerpts from the text of this compilation were performed at the Schol-
arship Institute at Yerrinbool in 1998. Howard, Fred, David, and Margaret
“told” their stories. It was moving to hear those accounts. The play will one
day happen, but the process of collecting the stories is ready to be shared
now and if more stories should come forth perhaps there will be a second
edition of this one day.

The script is writing itself, and if it should ever come to a movie screen
or theatre near you, that will be wonderful, but for now it has life as a book.
And also in the work of those Aboriginal Bahá’ís who wish to continue the
work of Fred Murray and Howard Harwood, and Harry Carter and others
who wanted to share the message of Bahá’u’lláh with the Aboriginal people
of Australia.

“Something Regal”

He loved to watch Westerns. He would cover his eyes when there was a
lot of violence and ask whoever was sitting next to him to tell him when it
had stopped.

There was something regal, about Uncle Fred. He was the sort of person
who would say, “Could you please get me a cuppa”, unlike his friend Harry,
who would get up and ask everyone, “well who’d like a cuppa, I’m about to
make one”

So different, yet great mates. Petite Fred, tall and large framed Harry
Carter.

These are some of the memories of Madge Williams, who was present
when Uncle Fred became a Bahá’í.

His life, like a dramatic movie, had rousing crowd scenes in which the
central character gets to speak before hundreds of people, sacred spaces like
the House of Worship, travel across the land and continents. He lost a family
and found a family.

Many people have said, “I was touched by a small pamphlet about his life.

It made me want to know about the Bahá’í Faith. “ Sue Obah, states ”it was
the reason I became a Bahá’í” That small pamphlet has enabled Uncle Fred’s
spirit to walk the dreaming tracks of this land.

It was his mate Howard Harwood, who served as a Member of the Conti-
nental Board of Counsellors for Australasia, who helped him put it together.
Uncle Fred couldn’t read or write, but he could tell stories, and he had a life
that made a great story.

Anywhere where his story is told, you can sure his spirit is there. Maybe
he is adding incidentals, smiling, and happy that he can continue to reach
people through its rich tapestry. This collection of stories, is a development
of that pamphlet- a filling in of some details and pictures to illuminate more
the mystery of one human soul.

Howard Harwood a friend of Uncle Fred’s, close to the next life and recently
having passed on, spoke of Uncle Fred and the hardships he had throughout                      First Aboriginal Bahá’í Conference (From National Australian Bahá’í Archives)

these accounts provide some moving moments from Uncle Fred’s life.

Howard recalls his first meeting with Uncle Fred, at the Aboriginal settle-
> ment of Gerard, which was situated on the River Murray South of the Fruit
growing area:

“We went to Gerard seeking pure souls and we found Fred. He was in

Howard then explains how he went to out to get Fred, and found him

Aboriginal, the journey before he became a Bahá’í are mostly recorded for us
by Howard Harwood.

In scribing Fred’s story for him Howard recognised a bridge builder and
wanted to help him build that bridge.

Fred Murray, was born “beneath a shady tree somewhere along the coast
of Esperance Bay in West Australia” in 1884. His mother was of the Minen
people. When he was around two years old and his brother was one, their
parent died in a measles epidemic. They were orphaned... He and his brother
were fostered by a European women, the wife of a sheep station manager who
lived in the area”.

It is a mystery to Howard why Fred and his brother were not fostered by
the tribe. At the time a lot of Aboriginal children were being taken from their
parents, and a lot of Europeans felt that Aboriginal people couldn’t care for their

survived the rest dying of gastroenteritis.

Fred’s family lived a tribal life. What Winnie, Fred’s wife, went through
as he went up and down the river, and she lost child after child one can only
wonder at. She passed away well before her husband. In fact, a short time
after Uncle Fred retired from working and just after they had moved to Gerard
settlement. The settlement had been a model reserve once, but gradually it
had become an unpleasant place to live.

In 1998 Howard mentioned that one daughter of Uncle Fred’s could still
be alive and living at Gerard Settlement.

Life was challenging for Uncle Fred’s children with the Australian laws
the way they were and the effects of alcohol in Annette’s family. More de-
tails about Fred Junior reveal that he had two sons but the government took
them.

Apparently, Howard thinks Fred junior’s children were raised in European
homes, but eventually left to go and live in the bush again.

It seems a source of sorrow that the descendants of Uncle Fred’s family
for the moment remain away from the new family their father had found for
them. And maybe one day these children will come home too.

Uncle Fred, loved to share the spirit of the Bahá’í Faith, he went travel
teaching with Dr Muhajir and Howard and Myrtle and his great friend Harry.
Uncle Harry and Uncle Fred would sit having long chats with Dr Muhajir. One
wonders how wonderful it would be to have listened to those conversations.

He also met Rúhíyyih Khánum at the dedication of the House of Worship
in Sydney and at Murray Bridge as well. Rúhíyyih Khánum was quite taken
with Fred Murray, she sent a photograph of him at the World Congress, and
requested that the National Spiritual Assembly place it at the House of Worship
